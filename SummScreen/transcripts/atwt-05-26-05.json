        "Katie: Henry?",
        "Margo: Either you overbooked or there's trouble in paradise. I'm going for door number two.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Margo: 'Cause you were twirling that ring like you're afraid you're gonna lose it.",
        "Katie: I think I already have.",
        "Margo: Does this, by any chance, have anything to do with you barging in on Mike and Jen's wedding?",
        "Katie: I was not going to try and stop the wedding. I sat in the back. And I didn't say a word.",
        "Margo: And I'm guessing that Henry just didn't really see it that way.",
        "Katie: I lost him, Margo. He's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hello, darling, I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Will: Well, I'm not staying. Paul not even expecting me. I just need to talk to him for a minute.",
        "Barbara: Why, is something wrong? You can talk to me.",
        "Will: No, nothing's wrong. Just tell him I'll catch him later.",
        "Barbara: Honey, honey, I want you to be able to talk to me. I miss hearing about what's going on with you. Is everything all right? Is something wrong?",
        "Will: No, nothing's wrong, okay? I'm fine.",
        "Barbara: Will, I miss hearing about the good things in your life. I miss talking to you. If it wasn't for your Aunt Kim, I wouldn't even know about prom. I'm just so glad that you've reconnected at school. You're making new friends. So, tell me about this lucky girl you're taking.",
        "Will: I'm not sure who I'm taking yet.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you don't have to be embarrassed about it. I already approve.",
        "Will: Of my going to the prom?",
        "Barbara: No, of your date. I think Celia's a lovely girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Okay, so now we need to choose colors.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Celia: Hey.",
        "Gwen: You looking for me?",
        "Celia: Actually Casey. Have you seen him?",
        "Gwen: Actually, no. But I am looking for you.",
        "Celia: Me, why?",
        "Gwen: We need to talk. There's something you need to know about. Come on, let's go somewhere private.",
        "Casey: Hey, what's up, guys?",
        "Celia: Gwen's being all mysterious. She has something important to tell me, in private.",
        "Casey: Oh, really? And what's so important you need to tell her in private?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: I'm serious, Holden. Listen to me now. All it takes is a moment's hesitation to create a whole lifetime of regret.",
        "Holden: You're not going to give up on this, are you?",
        "Emma: I'm telling you not to give up on it, Holden, for whatever reason. For guilt, for fear, for pride. I mean, you're giving up on Lily, and I know, I know in your heart that you don't really want to do that.",
        "Holden: Lily has already given up on me. She proved that when she brought Keith into her life.",
        "Emma: Holden, she's not proving anything but how vulnerable she is right now. I mean, someone is telling her that she's attractive and that she's desirable, and she just can't say no to that. I mean, you know, why don't you just turn the tables so she can't say no to you?",
        "Holden: How?",
        "Emma: Well, just -- I don't know, sweetheart, just stop thinking so much and start feeling. Holden, I know, I know that you still love Lily. You haven't denied that. So fight for her. I mean, just fight for your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Am I scaring you?",
        "Lily: No. No, I'm not scared.",
        "Keith: What's the matter?",
        "Lily: I just want to look in your eyes and be sure.",
        "Keith: About me?",
        "Lily: About myself.",
        "Keith: I don't understand.",
        "Lily: I just want to look in your eyes and know that this is what you want. That I'm what you want.",
        "Keith: You are what I want. In fact, I didn't realize how much until this moment. I love you. I love you so much. Kind of hurts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Faith: Daddy.",
        "Holden: Hey, sweetie. Oh, how's my girl?",
        "Faith: I knew you'd come back. Luke said you never would, but I didn't believe him.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, where's Mommy? Can you do me a favor and go get her?",
        "Faith: She's not here.",
        "Holden: Where is she?",
        "Faith: Down in the cabin with Uncle Keith.",
        "Holden: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I'm coming on to strong, right?",
        "Lily: No, no. Do you really love me?",
        "Keith: Yeah, I do. I mean, I might have a hard time explaining. You've brought me back from this dark, dismal place that I've been living in. And I actually think that maybe I might even have a chance to be happy.",
        "Lily: I don't know what to say.",
        "Keith: Well, you don't have to say anything. Just as long as you don't run for the door.",
        "Lily: Oh. I won't do that. But I will do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Chill out, Case, it's a girl thing. Come on, C.",
        "Casey: No. I need to talk to you, too.",
        "Gwen: So get in line. What I have to say cannot wait.",
        "Casey: You know what, I bet it can, all right? Just, let's go to Al's or something.",
        "Celia: Stop it, both of you. Its okay, Gwen, just tell me right here. Casey and I have no secrets. Right?",
        "Gwen: Okay, fine. You've been nominated for prom queen.",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Gwen: Go check it out for yourself if you don't believe me.",
        "Celia: This has to be a joke.",
        "Gwen: No, I don't joke about stuff like that. Especially with my friends.",
        "Celia: Oh, my God. This is amazing. Can you believe it?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, case, can you?",
        "Casey: Of course I can.",
        "Celia: But why me? Hardly anybody knows me at this school.",
        "Casey: Well, you've obviously made a good impression. Hey, listen up. You see this girl right here? She's about to be the next prom queen of Oakdale. By the way, she's my girlfriend.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Hey, how 'bout that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Who told you Celia was going to be my prom date?",
        "Barbara: Well, no one had to tell me. I saw the two of you together at your sister's wedding. It was obvious that you like each other.",
        "Will: We're friends.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's great. Prom will be a good way to test the waters.",
        "Will: No, I'm not taking her to the prom, okay? It wasn't even a possibility. So once again, you're way off base.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, I -- I mean, I saw the two of you together and you looked nice together. And I had a nice conversation with her and she said nice things about you. And I just made an assumption, which is always a dangerous thing to do.",
        "Will: Yeah. It never stops you, though, does it?",
        "Barbara: So, who are you taking?",
        "Will: You don't know her.",
        "Barbara: I'd like to.",
        "Will: Why? So you can decide if you approve of her or not? Make it into more than it should be if you do? Scare her off if you don't?",
        "Barbara: I just want you to have a good time, that's all. Have this prom be a wonderful memory for you.",
        "Will: It's just a stupid dance.",
        "Barbara: Honey, don't say that. It can be magic if you let it be. And you are going to look so handsome in your tux. I can help you pick it out, if you'd like.",
        "Will: No, the only help I need from you, is to leave me alone. How many different ways do I have to say that before it finally sinks in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I didn't mean to hurt Henry. I would never, ever do that.",
        "Margo: No, of course you wouldn't. Not intentionally. But let's hop over into his boots for a second here. You didn't even make it to the airport, Katie. You ditched him by the side of the road, with a cop and a traffic ticket. And you hightailed it back to town as fast as you could just to make it to Mike and Jen's wedding.",
        "Katie: I was supposed to be the matron of honor. I didn't want to let Jen down. She was counting on me.",
        "Margo: But, Jen didn't need you. She was fine.",
        "Katie: I was trying to honor a promise.",
        "Margo: What about your promise to your husband, huh?",
        "Katie: I didn't stop the wedding.",
        "Margo: Not because you didn't want to. Man, the only reason you kept your mouth shut is because you know that Mike would never, ever walk away from Jen. Can you admit it?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Margo: Stop lying to yourself.",
        "Katie: I'm not.",
        "Margo: Yes, you are. If you thought for one second that Mike would pick you over Jennifer, oh, you would've hopped out of your seat like there was a fire and stopped that wedding in a heartbeat. Am I right?",
        "Katie: Maybe.",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, it's me. I need to see you. I'll pick you up. How soon can you be ready?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Student #1: Way to go, Celia. I hope you win.",
        "Student #2: We'll campaign for you.",
        "Casey: You don't need to campaign for her. She's got this thing nailed.",
        "Celia: Casey, stop.",
        "Casey: But you do. You're gorgeous.",
        "Student #3: And you're prejudiced, dude. Also, way lucky.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I am the luckiest guy in the room. Hell, I'm the luckiest guy in town.",
        "Student #1: We're going to have so much fun.",
        "Student #2: It's going to be great.",
        "Student #3: It's going to be awesome.",
        "Celia: I'll be right back.",
        "Casey: You all right?",
        "Celia: Fine. I just feel a little weird. I'm going go freshen up.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you better learn to trust people a little bit more. Otherwise, you could end up with some enemies.",
        "Casey: All right, come here. The last thing I want to do is get on your bad side, but I need to know where you stand with this, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I told you, I wasn't going to say anything about us sleeping together.",
        "Casey: And I want to believe that, but the thing is, you just keep playing me on it.",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about?",
        "Casey: First, you're all getting in good with my parents. And now, all of a sudden, you're my girlfriend's best friend. And I'm just trying to figure out why.",
        "Gwen: Maybe because she's cool and I like hanging out with her.",
        "Casey: Or maybe you like hanging our one night of sex over my head.",
        "Gwen: And why would I do that?",
        "Casey: Because you get off on watching me squirm.",
        "Gwen: Oh, like I ever think about you.",
        "Casey: Listen, just tell me what you want, Gwen. 'Cause I need to make sure you're going to be cool about this.",
        "Gwen: No, you first.",
        "Casey: Okay, I've been out of line, jumping to conclusions about you. I'll admit it. But, man, you gotta understand, I've got something good going with Celia and I want it to last. I don't want one night from the past to blow it.",
        "Gwen: You're the one who keeps coming back to it.",
        "Casey: I know, I know, I'm sorry. I was getting the wrong vibe from you, so I was giving you grief about it. But, I don't know, can we just rewind and start over? As friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You know, you really ought to find a new hiding spot. I've got dibs on this one.",
        "Celia: So put up a sign.",
        "Will: Would that work?",
        "Celia: Nope. I like it up here.",
        "Will: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Celia: You okay?",
        "Will: No. But what's your excuse?",
        "Celia: I just wanted some air.",
        "Will: Me, too.",
        "Celia: She got to you again, huh?",
        "Will: Who?",
        "Celia: Your mom.",
        "Will: Is it that obvious?",
        "Celia: Guess I'm good at figuring you out.",
        "Will: Well, if you are, then you're the first.",
        "Celia: Ladies and gentleman, here he is, the most misunderstood boy in the world. So, what happened?",
        "Will: My mom wishes I was still 10 and that what she says to me still matters.",
        "Celia: And doesn't?",
        "Will: No. Well, you'd have to know my mom to understand.",
        "Celia: I know you've told me stuff about her, but she seems really nice to me.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's only because she --",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Will: Nothing. Forget it. I don't want to talk about my mom. So, what are you doing up here?",
        "Celia: I told you. It's good for my health.",
        "Will: Right. So, did something happen with Casey?",
        "Celia: Yeah, kind of, I guess.",
        "Will: Bad?",
        "Celia: Weird. Stuff's just happening really fast. And I was just wondering, what would happen if Casey and I weren't together. What if we weren't going out? How different things would be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, what am I supposed to do? What do I do? I mean, yeah, I will always have feelings for Mike. I will probably always love Mike. But Ilsa went with Victor, not Rick.",
        "Margo: Are you using \"Casablanca\" to guide you through your life?",
        "Katie: Well, it's Henry's favorite movie. So if anyone should understand, he should. He's Victor Lazlo. He gets the girl.",
        "Margo: This is not Hollywood. This is not a movie.",
        "Katie: Okay, but I'm sure we're not the first couple in the real world to be slightly off balance. So, Henry gives a little more than I do. It's not the end of the world. We can still be happy.",
        "Margo: But you won't have Paris.",
        "Katie: I don't want Paris. I want Henry.",
        "Margo: Oh, baby. As much as I hate to say this, I think that you're too late. I think that you have to let Henry go. At least just give him some space to think. To heal. [Cell phone rings] Hey, Hal. Yeah, I guess I can be there in about 15 minutes. All right, I'll see you then. Sorry, I got to get to the station. I hate to leave you like this.",
        "Katie: I'll survive.",
        "Margo: Katie, I'm really very sorry.",
        "Katie: It's not your fault. It's mine.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it is. Call me.",
        "Katie: I will. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Lily: Oh, gosh. It's been so long since I felt so at peace.",
        "Keith: Well, that's because you've been carrying all that bad stuff around with you for some time now.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Keith: Why you thanking me?",
        "Lily: For making me feel like myself again.",
        "Keith: You're a very, very strong girl.",
        "Lily: Am I, really? Sometimes I don't think so.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, sometimes it's very hard to bounce back from tragic situations. But you did.",
        "Lily: You know what? I have an idea.",
        "Keith: You do?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Keith: Well, as long as it doesn't involve putting our clothes back on.",
        "Lily: No, actually, it doesn't. Stay here. I'll be right back. Hold that thought.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Holden: Sorry. Did I wake you?",
        "Keith: Um, no --",
        "Holden: I'm looking for Lily. Faith said she was down here, but I guess she's not.",
        "Lily: Hey, Keith, I was thinking maybe \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: I don't think we should hold off on the divorce. If you're ready to go ahead with it, well, then so am I.",
        "Katie: Hey, take your hands off my husband. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Something wrong? Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, fine. Faith -- she told me that you were down here, and I just came by. I didn't think.",
        "Lily: Oh. Are the kids okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, they're fine. Listen, maybe we should do this some other time. Maybe tomorrow.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, no. I mean, you're here. Why don't you just say what you want to say?",
        "Holden: I just wanted to come by and say that I think that you're right. I don't think we should hold off on the divorce. If you're ready to go ahead with it then -- well, then so am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know, it's kind of cool I got you so scared.",
        "Casey: I'm not scared. And you're not hearing me.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no, I'm hearing you all right, like a sound check. Be friends with Gwennie so she doesn't blow my cover.",
        "Casey: I'm not doing this for myself, all right? I'm doing it for Celia. Celia cares about you, and I care about Celia. So, I still want to make sure that it's cool that we all hang out.",
        "Gwen: Then stop freaking out every time you see me alone with her. If you want some trust, you gotta come up with some yourself.",
        "Casey: All right, fine, you're right. I've been a jerk. I'm sorry. But it's over now. You're looking at the new me.",
        "Gwen: Am I? You're lucky I'm in a good mood.",
        "Casey: So, are we cool?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. For now. Tell Celia I'll check her later.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Barbara: Hi, Casey.",
        "Casey: Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: That was a very interesting looking young woman you were talking to. Is she a friend of yours?",
        "Casey: Her name's Gwen.",
        "Barbara: Gwen, Gwen. Didn't I see her on the wait staff at my daughter's wedding?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess. You know, everyone's gotta make ends meet. Would you excuse me? I've gotta go find someone.",
        "Barbara: Are you looking for Will? Because so am I.",
        "Casey: No, actually, I don't even know where he's at, sorry.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Well then, maybe you can help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I didn't know that you and Casey were having problems. I thought things were good.",
        "Celia: They are. Better than good.",
        "Will: Well, then why are you wondering what it would be like if you guys weren't together?",
        "Celia: I didn't mean the way it sounded.",
        "Will: Oh.",
        "Celia: It's just I got nominated for prom queen and I --",
        "Will: Really? That's great. Congratulations.",
        "Celia: Total surprise. I never expected anything like that to happen to me.",
        "Will: Why not? You think you don't deserve it? You definitely deserve it. I'll bet you'll win.",
        "Celia: You think?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Celia: You don't think I only got nominated because of Casey?",
        "Will: What do you mean?",
        "Celia: He's so popular. Everybody knows him and likes him.",
        "Will: No, you got nominated because you deserve to be nominated. This has nothing to do with Casey.",
        "Celia: How do you know? I'm new to the town, new to the school. I don't have a lot of friends and some of the girls, like Lia and Ann -- they've hated me since day one.",
        "Will: Because they're idiots.",
        "Celia: Still. If Casey weren't in the picture, then maybe I wouldn't be, either.",
        "Will: Oh, Celia, don't sell yourself short. And don't worry about girls like Lia and Ann. They're just jealous of you.",
        "Celia: Come on.",
        "Will: No, I'm being serious. You're smart, you're funny and you're great to be around.",
        "Celia: You're just trying to make me feel better.",
        "Will: No, I'm not. And besides --",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Will: You're beautiful.",
        "Celia: For someone so misunderstood, you sure know all the right things to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Margo: I think you have to let him go. At the very least, give him some space to think. To heal.",

        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: Why do I like martinis? Well, the good ones, they taste like a beautiful cloud. They're ethereal. It's mist in your mouth.",
        "Ivy: You've got quite a way with words.",
        "Henry: I've got quite a way with a lot of things.",
        "Katie: Except for your memory.",
        "Henry: Hey, Katie! Hey, what are you doing here? Are you -- you looking for Mike?",
        "Katie: I need to speak with you.",
        "Henry: Oh, well, now's not a good time. I'm trying to drink this while it's still ice cold.",
        "Katie: Yeah, your martini's not the only thing in here that's ice cold.",
        "Henry: What? I don't get your meaning.",
        "Katie: Can we talk about this at home?",
        "Henry: Whose home? Yours or mine?",
        "Katie: Henry, please.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Where are my manners? Let me introduce you. This is my dear friend, Ivy Churchill. Ivy, I'd like you to meet Katie.",
        "Katie: Katie Coleman. As in Henry's wife.",
        "Henry: We'd ask you to join us, but we don't want to. I do have something for you, though. Here it is. Yeah, it's a ticket that that cop gave me for speeding. You remember that? And I figured, since I was out of the airfare for Hawaii that the least you could do is cover this. Thanks. Now, if you'll excuse us.",
        "Katie: Hey, whatever-your-name-is -- Ivy? Take your hands off my husband. Now.",
        "Henry: Why don't you find us a nice secluded table where we can, you know, be alone and uninterrupted.",
        "Ivy: Are you sure?",
        "Katie: I liked your suggestion about leaving much better.",
        "Ivy: Then I guess I'll go find us a nice secluded table.",
        "Katie: Why are you doing this?",
        "Henry: Why am I doing what, sweetheart? Moving on with my life after being left in the dust by a woman who claimed that she loved me?",
        "Katie: I do love you.",
        "Henry: Not enough.",
        "Katie: So, this is how you drown your sorrows?",
        "Henry: Oh, we're just -- we're having some drinks.",
        "Katie: Here. Not at the Lakeview, not at a million other places. 'Cause you knew I was going to be here and you're trying to make me jealous.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Katie, that's it, because everything I do has to be in relation to you. You know what? You know what? I'm not going to beg and plead for your love. And I'm not going to stand in the mighty Kasnoff's shadow any more. Not any more. It's a big shadow, Katie, and I'm afraid of the dark.",
        "Katie: Please, don't do this, Henry. Let's go home. Let's talk. I will prove to you that there is no shadow of Mike in our house. Not anymore.",
        "Henry: You can't kid a kidder, okay? And I'm not talking about myself.",
        "Katie: What does that mean?",
        "Henry: It means you are kidding yourself if you think that Mike wouldn't be in bed with us, every night, forever.",
        "Katie: That is not true.",
        "Henry: He's in your heart, sweetie. He always will be. You proved that yesterday. So, I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry, but one day you'll understand.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. That's Bogie's line, that's not your line. Don't you get it? I'm Ilsa. You're Victor. I get on the plane with you.",
        "Henry: You didn't, though. You didn't get on the plane. You left as soon as you could. You ran -- you ran back to Mike. Always back to Mike. I can't do this. No, I can't it anymore. Okay, that's it. I'm sorry. My date is waiting, I've got a couple of drinks here that are getting warm.",
        "Katie: You're not wearing your ring anymore.",
        "Henry: I don't have a marriage anymore. I'm not sure I ever did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Don't worry. You're not in trouble. I just want to ask you a question.",
        "Casey: About what?",
        "Barbara: About Will.",
        "Casey: I already told you, I haven't seen him.",
        "Barbara: This is about the prom. He won't tell me who he's asked.",
        "Casey: Maybe he doesn't want you to know who he's taking.",
        "Barbara: Casey, your mom knows who you're taking, doesn't she? I mean, it's not a crime. It's not a big deal. And I promise you, you can trust me, I will not reveal my source.",
        "Casey: You know what? Will's my friend and I'm not going to go behind him like that.",
        "Barbara: Well, I do admire your loyalty, but I will find out what I want to find out. I always do.",
        "Casey: It's kind of funny how that works out, huh? Excuse me.",
        "Gwen: Oh gosh, I'm sorry, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's quite all right. Um, Gwen, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You remember me from the wedding?",
        "Barbara: I certainly do. You were serving drinks at my daughter's wedding, weren't you?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Well, you know what? I am parched. Would you be a dear and get me a glass of water, no ice?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, sure.",
        "Barbara: Mr. Jacoby? Barbara Ryan. Will Munson's mom.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Oh, yes, of course, yes. How are you?",
        "Barbara: I'm well, I'm well. Thank you for asking. I certainly approve of the venue that you and the students have chosen for this year's prom.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Yeah, I think it's going to work nicely, yeah.",
        "Barbara: How's Will doing?",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Well, I'm glad you asked. I've been trying to arrange a parent/teacher conference for some time now and Will keeps on telling me that you're too busy to fit it into your schedule.",
        "Barbara: Really? Will said that?",
        "Mr. Jacoby: I really think it's important we should all touch base at some point.",
        "Barbara: I couldn't agree more. There's not a better time than now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: No way were you freshening up that whole time.",
        "Celia: No. I went for a walk.",
        "Casey: You okay?",
        "Celia: Yeah. It was just kind of strange, all that attention.",
        "Casey: You better get used to it, 'cause after you win prom queen, there's going to be a lot more.",
        "Celia: Well, even if I don't win, I still need a dress. Something special.",
        "Casey: Hey, you look good in everything.",
        "Celia: I still need to get something special. Gwen said she'd go look with me. Have you seen her?",
        "Casey: No. What do you need Gwen for? I'll watch you try on dresses.",
        "Celia: I bet you would. But I want you to be surprised when you come pick me up for the prom. Besides, I promised Gwen.",
        "Casey: So what? She'll get over it. I mean, you know, why are you hanging out with her so much, anyway?",
        "Celia: She's my friend.",
        "Casey: All right, whatever. All I'm saying is just watch out.",
        "Celia: Why? Casey, I don't understand what you have against her.",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Celia: Then why don't you want me to be around her?",
        "Casey: You want to know the truth? All right, fine, I'll tell you the truth.",

        "Keith: I'm going to go finish whatever it was you were doing in the kitchen.",
        "Lily: Okay. Okay. I'm sorry that it had to happen this way, I really am.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. I'm sorry. I was an idiot to think that -- you're free to live your life, Lily. You're free to do whatever you want.",
        "Lily: That's true, I am.",
        "Holden: So, let's make it official.",
        "Lily: The divorce?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'll have my lawyers call your lawyers tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Well, I think that's best.",
        "Holden: Okay, then.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Keith: Lily? You all right? That's a stupid question. Tell me how you're feeling, okay? I can handle it. I can take it.",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know how I feel.",
        "Keith: Well, tell me that your heart's breaking. That you're still in love him. I mean, I'd be a fool to think that after a long relationship like that that you would feel nothing.",
        "Lily: I remember the exact moment when I knew that I had lost Holden to Julia. When I saw them together it was so devastating. I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. At that moment, my whole world just fell out from underneath me and I felt so lost.",
        "Keith: Why wouldn't you feel lost?",
        "Lily: Do you understand if I close the door, I'm closing the door on a 20-year relationship.",
        "Keith: That's rough.",
        "Lily: Lilies? Why would he bring me flowers when he came here to ask me for a divorce?",
        "Keith: Sometimes people do stupid things when they're upset.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Yeah, I guess they do.",
        "Keith: Do you think he was lying about why he came here in the first place?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Keith: There's only one way to find out. Go ask him.",

        "Celia: But I had to come back.",
        "Will: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Celia: Nothing. Everything's right. I lied to you before. When I said the only reason I was wondering about being with Casey was because of the prom.",
        "Will: There's another reason?",
        "Celia: Yeah. You. You're the one I want, Will. Not just at the prom, but always.",
        "Will: Dream on, Munson. 'Cause it ain't ever going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: It's not that I have anything against Gwen, all right? I mean, she's fine. She's cool, whatever, but she's always there. Like, she's here. She's at Al's. She was at the wedding.",
        "Celia: She works at Al's, she was working at the wedding and she's here because she's my friend.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'm sorry, fine, you're right. I'm not trying to trash your friends or push 'em away, or anything like that, but when you're spending all your time with her, that means less time with me and that bums me out.",
        "Celia: Oh. So it's about me?",
        "Casey: Always. You're the only person I want to hang out with.",
        "Celia: Yeah, but you can't be jealous of my friends.",
        "Casey: Man, I'm jealous of the clothes you're wearing. I'm jealous of that bracelet.",
        "Celia: Happy?",
        "Casey: Better.",
        "Celia: I hope you're not asking me to stop being friends with gwen.",
        "Casey: No, no. No, not -- it's just -- don't spend all your free time with her, all right? Just save a little bit for me.",

        "Katie: When we got married, you knew I still had feelings for Mike. I never kept that from you. But I have never acted on them.",
        "Henry: You acted in your heart. 24/7. How in the hell am I supposed to compete with that?",
        "Katie: I can't lose you, Henry. Please, I love you. Just -- just tell me what to do and I'll do it. Just put me to a test. I will prove to you I --",
        "Henry: Stop it, stop it, stop it! You can't prove something you don't believe, all right? It is over. We made a terrible mistake. If it -- if it helps, I blame myself. I'm sorry. All right, I was the fool. I loved you so much that I thought I would be okay with being the second best. But I couldn't, Katie, I can't. I cannot, I won't do it. And I know that hurts you and I'm sorry, that breaks my heart, it really does, but you've got to face reality here.",
        "Katie: You are my reality.",
        "Henry: I wish that were true. I got to go. Here's looking at you, kid.",
