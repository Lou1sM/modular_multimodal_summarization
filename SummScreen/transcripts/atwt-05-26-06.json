        "Lily: Damian.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry I couldn't give you any warning. In your condition, you should not have too many surprises. Congratulations.",
        "Lily: What are you doing here?",
        "Damian: May I come in?",
        "Lily: No, no, you may not come in.",
        "Damian: Lily, please.",
        "Lily: The last time we said good-bye, it was supposed to be forever. I will not let you hurt this family again.",
        "Damian: I am a part of this family, Lily. And when you understand why I'm here, you'll want me to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Merry Christmas. Or should I say happy graduation?",
        "Will: Are they --",
        "Jade: The answers for your Calculus final. Nate and I spent some quality time together after he took the test, and he said that section two is really tricky. So that would be a really good place for you to make some mistakes. And then no one's gonna know that you had help. Take it, Will. It's a gift.",
        "Will: Forget it, Jade. I'm really not interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: What do you mean, you resign?",
        "Nick: I'm through here, Hal.",
        "Hal: Well, what the hell happened?",
        "Nick: I'm sorry I gotta leave you short.",
        "Hal: Is this about the Galaxy investigation? Or are you still steamed about your cousin Mike?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Hal: Well, maybe you better start from the beginning and bring me up to speed.",
        "Nick: What, do I have to draw you a picture? I mean, I never got off on the right foot here. And now with my cousin being investigated, it's gone from bad to worse. I need a new start. And I'm sorry I couldn't give you a couple more weeks' notice.",
        "Hal: And why can't you?",
        "Nick: Because I've already got something lined up.",
        "Hal: Uh-huh. Tell me, Nick. Why are you so hot to get out of town?",
        "Jack: Your lieutenant asked you a question. I'd like to hear an answer, too.",

        "[Mike remembering]",
        "Mike: All right, when you left, where'd you go?",
        "Nick: I went to the closest bar I could find and then hitched my way to another one.",
        "Mike: You never came down as far as Oakdale?",
        "Nick: What do you think? You think I went to your empty house, grabbed some girl I never met, killed her and buried her in your basement?",
        "Mike: Katie? Hey, you home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What did you just say?",
        "Del: What's it worth to you?",
        "Katie: The man that killed your girlfriend, Maya Gold, you're absolutely positive his name was Nick?",
        "Del: Nick Kasnoff.",
        "Carly: Then it was Nick's DNA on that St. Christopher medal, and that's why he stole it from the evidence room.",
        "Katie: Call Jack.",
        "Del: Who's Jack?",
        "Carly: I can't call anybody. This jerk whacked the phone box with his pickaxe.",
        "Del: Let me go. I didn't hurt nobody.",
        "Carly: Shut up!",
        "Katie: I have my phone, I have my phone! What's Jack's number at the precinct?",
        "Del: What precinct?",
        "Carly: Don't call the precinct. Just call his cell phone. It's always on.",
        "Del: You're gonna call a precinct? Hey, you two attacked me.",
        "Katie: I'm not getting service. Do you have your phone?",
        "Carly: No, I don't have it. I don't know where it is. All right, here, you hold this on him. And I'll go call a neighbor, okay?",
        "Del: Hey, calm down, calm down. Let me go and we'll call it even.",
        "Carly: You stay where you are! I'll come right back.",
        "Katie: Just hurry.",
        "Carly: And when I do, you're gonna tell the cops everything!",

        "Damian: Lily, no one is in danger.",
        "Lily: Since when? Last I heard, you were going underground where no one could contact you. Believe me, I tried.",
        "Damian: I know.",
        "Lily: How do you know?",
        "Damian: My people got word to me.",
        "Lily: Oh, those people -- the same people that kept you hidden all these years?",
        "Damian: Yes.",
        "Lily: So now what? Where are the bad guys? There're always bad guys when you're involved.",
        "Damian: My enemies are not a problem any longer.",
        "Lily: Oh, and I'm just supposed to take your word on that?",
        "Damian: I swear. And I wish I could have contacted you sooner.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you? We were desperate when Luke was sick.",
        "Damian: I just didn't find out in time.",
        "Lily: Would it have mattered to you?",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Damian: I love Luciano. You know that. I'd give my life for him.",
        "Lily: No, I don't that. I don't know that. Not anymore.",
        "Damian: By the time I was ready to travel -- I was free to travel -- Luke had already had his surgery.",
        "Lily: No thanks to you.",
        "Damian: But he is well now, yes?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Damian: No complications?",
        "Lily: He's had a few setbacks.",
        "Damian: But he did not reject the new kidney.",
        "Lily: No, thank God.",
        "Damian: An answer to my prayers. The boy looked well, but I couldn't be sure.",
        "Lily: You've seen Luke?",
        "Damian: Only from a distance.",
        "Lily: How far of a distance?",
        "Damian: Lily, don't worry, I made sure he didn't see me.",
        "Lily: Oh, it was you? You were the one that was stalking Luke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Grandma? Grandma, Grandma?",
        "Lucinda: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Hi.",
        "Luke: So, I take it your party's over?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, the party is definitely over. It's over.",
        "Luke: Well, I got you this. It's tea. Loose-leaf, hibiscus. You like that, right?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I love that.",
        "Luke: Well, you can get it directly from the supplier. Java told me it's on their website, so --",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. I don't know that I'm gonna do that, but thank you so much. Paul crashed Jennifer's party. What crashed your party?",
        "Luke: Can I ask you a question, Grandma? Do you think I'm crazy?",
        "Lucinda: No more than the rest of us.",
        "Luke: No, no, I'm serious. Do you think there's something like messed up in my brain because I'm gay?",
        "Lucinda: Of course you're not crazy.",
        "Luke: Mom wants me to see a shrink.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Things haven't been going well with the talks?",
        "Luke: She wants me to go to therapy.",
        "Lucinda: Well, darling, that's not necessarily a bad thing.",
        "Luke: Well, she's the one that needs therapy. I'm just gay. I'm not disturbed, I'm not confused, I'm not anything. And she can't control it, so she's freaking out. She's having me followed.",
        "Lucinda: She's having detectives follow you?",
        "Luke: Someone's checking up on me.",
        "Lucinda: That's not her style, honey.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe her style is changing.",
        "Lucinda: My darling child, everything is changing. Everything is changing! And her heart just hasn't caught up yet, that's all.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe it never will.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I don't believe that.",
        "Luke: No. Mom grew up in a bubble. She met Dad when she was my age. She thinks they're this all-time romantic couple with the perfect house, perfect family and -- I just ruined that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I'm not sure that you're accurately describing your mother's life, darling. But another time on that. You think -- you think you're destroying some image your mother has of herself?",
        "Luke: Well, growing up -- growing up, my mom told me that I could tell her anything, anything, and she would always love me and support me. I guess she just forget the \"unless you tell me that you're gay\" part. And at first I thought maybe she just needed some time, you know? But I've given her time. And she still doesn't accept me. And I'm beginning to think that maybe she never will.",

        "Jade: I thought you said you were in serious danger of failing Calculus?",
        "Will: It's not my best subject.",
        "Jade: And how much does the final count for your grade?",
        "Will: I'll manage, okay? Just leave me alone right now.",
        "Jade: The test is in, like, an hour. What do you expect to happen between now and then? An act of God? I'm sorry, I'm just trying to help.",
        "Will: And you did help, with the Biology paper. But now I gotta help myself.",
        "Jade: Don't throw your life away because of a Calculus test, all right? People do worse things everyday. And besides, you're doing it for the right reason. You love your wife, and you want to have a future with her.",
        "Will: What good is graduating if I can't look Gwen in the eye? I want her to be proud of me for real, not because I cheated my way to a diploma.",
        "Jade: How is she going to be proud of you if you flunk out of high school?",
        "[Gwen laughing]",
        "Gwen: You were so not going to buy that shirt.",
        "Maddie: Why not?",
        "Gwen: 'Cause it's like $200.",
        "Maddie: Yes, but it looked like a million on.",
        "Gwen: Hey there.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Gwen: What's going on? I thought you were studying.",
        "Jade: It's my fault.",
        "Will: I just came in for a cup of coffee.",
        "Jade: And I was pestering about job openings at the hospital.",
        "Gwen: Well, I've got news.",
        "Maddie: Great news.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, Mrs. Grimaldi's throwing a party at Crash.",
        "Will: She throws a party every night.",
        "Gwen: No, a graduation party for the entire class. The whole school is invited, not just seniors. And every girl there is gonna be jealous, because I'm married to the smartest guy in the whole room.",
        "Will: Gwen, maybe we should rethink the whole graduation thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: There's an opening downstate. They need it filled tomorrow.",
        "Hal: Where downstate?",
        "Nick: I'll let you know.",
        "Jack: And you're okay leaving your cousin in the middle of this mess?",
        "Nick: I'll still keep in touch with Mike.",
        "Hal: From how far away?",
        "Nick: I'll let you know.",
        "Hal: Let me know now.",
        "Nick: See? This is the garbage I'm sick of. I never cut it here. I've been resented ever since the first day, when I took on Jack's caseload.",
        "Hal: Jack is back. All is forgotten. Why leave now?",
        "Nick: Because his wife made it personal.",
        "Jack: Don't put Carly in the middle of this.",
        "Nick: She's still making it personal.",
        "Jack: That is enough, Nick!",
        "Hal: All right, cool down, both of you.",
        "Nick: See? This is the trouble I don't want on my next job.",
        "Jack: What kind of trouble?",
        "Nick: She won't quit, Hal. If she wants to ruin someone else's life, then fine. But she's not ruining mine.",
        "Hal: I want an address, I want phone numbers, I want contacts where you can be reached.",
        "Nick: You have my cell number. And as for Mike, if he needs me, I'll be here.",
        "Hal: 48 hours, Nick. If I don't have the information by then, I come looking for you. And you won't be hard to find.",
        "Jack: You think Hal bought any of that?",
        "Nick: What's it to you, Snyder?",
        "Jack: Mike's case isn't close to being solved.",
        "Nick: What, because you hit a wall? Don't sweat it. I'm sure your wife will solve this one for you, too.",
        "Jack: You always say that you and Mike are like brothers. Does he know you're leaving?",
        "Nick: What's your point?",
        "Jack: You came back to Oakdale for family. To leave him in a jam doesn't sit right.",
        "Nick: Mike's not in a jam. Not unless you got enough to put him in custody. And as for me being gone, he and Katie will finally get a little peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Come on, Katie. Hey, it's me. Look, call me as soon as you can. We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Carly, are you okay?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I think so.",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Carly: When he was swinging that pick-axe around, he must've gotten a pretty good chunk out of whatever was holding up the stairs.",
        "Katie: Oh, can you walk?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. I think so, yeah. The pick-axe, Katie!",
        "Katie: Don't move!",
        "Del: Looks like we better get friendly, girls. Seeing as we're stuck down here.",
        "Carly: We gotta get out of here. We gotta get help. The window -- I'll get help if I can get up there.",
        "Katie: It's small, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, I can fit. I just gotta get up there.",
        "Katie: It's so high.",
        "Carly: Just keep an eye on Mr. Personality here, all right?",
        "Katie: Are you sure? You're hurt, I'll go.",
        "Carly: I'm fine, I can do it.",
        "Katie: Can you reach it?",
        "Carly: Just keep it on him, Katie! It's stuck!",
        "Katie: Try and break it.",
        "Carly: Come on!",
        "Del: Need a man's help?",
        "Katie: You know one?",
        "[Carly shouts]",
        "Carly: I got it. All right, I'm gonna go for help. Don't panic. Just keep that axe where he can see it. And I'll come back, and I'll bring the cops.",
        "Katie: Okay. Wait, Carly, my phone! Take my phone!",
        "Del: Who the hell is wonder woman?",
        "Katie: Don't move.",
        "Del: So you'll slice open my other leg, huh?",
        "Katie: I mean it!",
        "Del: No, no. Relax, I'm not going anywhere. So Nick -- he's family, huh?",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about Nick.",
        "Del: Yeah, same name, Kasnoff. Yeah. Like Mike, that you were telling me about. He's your hubby, right?",
        "Katie: Mike's his cousin.",
        "Del: So Nicky hung his own cousin out to dry? Let him take the rap while he left Maya to rot here like a dead dog.",
        "Katie: Do I have to duct tape your mouth?",
        "Del: I'm just keepin' it real, baby.",
        "Katie: What are you doing? [Cell phone ringing] Don't move, or I swear I will use this thing! Hello? Carly?",
        "Mike: Hey, it's me.",
        "Katie: Mike? Mike? I can't hear you!",
        "Mike: Where are you?",
        "Katie: I'm trapped at Carly's.",
        "Mike: You're what?",
        "Carly: I'm trapped in Carly's basement. Get this -- we found this man --",
        "Mike: Where? Katie, say it again.",
        "Katie: I'm in Carly's basement. He said --",
        "[Katie screams]",
        "Mike: Katie! Katie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, but graduation is a big deal. I want to celebrate that, don't you? Look, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry that I get carried away. But when I think about how hard you worked to get here --",
        "Will: You know, I didn't do anything special.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you did. And it's okay if I brag about it, right? I mean, I am your wife. And I love you.",
        "Will: I love you, too.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Hey -- what's wrong? Ever since your sister's engagement party, you've been -- you've been really down.",
        "Will: Well, this whole day is supposed to be about Jen and Dusty, you know? And then Mom's gotta go and tell Paul exactly when and where the party was going to be, and it all falls apart.",
        "Gwen: Well, Jen and Dusty aren't going to let some stupid little party get in their way. They're crazy about each other, anybody can see that. And they're crazy about Johnny. They already have a family. No one's gonna change that. Not your mom or Paul or anyone.",
        "Will: Don't you get scared ever when you see the kind of people that I'm related to?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. A little bit, a little -- but you're nothing like Paul, and you're nothing like your mom, who has to get what she wants. You're the most totally upfront person that I know. So, listen, let's not think about anybody else, and let's enjoy this time. 'Cause it's not any old graduation that we're looking at. This is our life together starting, completely independent from anyone else.",
        "Will: I want that. I want that so much. And, if I ever lost you --",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. You're never going to lose me. Babe, we're almost there, okay? One more test and we're home free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You know, you can read that at the library for free pretty soon.",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah, but it'll be old news by then. And I like to keep up on things.",
        "Casey: Hey, did you hear the news?",
        "Maddie: Hey, yeah, about the graduation party?",
        "Casey: Pretty cool of my grandmother, don't you think?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey: Hey, how's it going? I don't think we've met.",
        "Jade: Hi. Casey Hughes, right? I've seen you at the club.",
        "Maddie: Case, this is Jade Taylor.",
        "Jade: Hi.",
        "Casey: Cool. Hey, is Gwen here?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, she's over there.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Maddie: So, it's pretty cool, huh? That it's not just seniors invited.",
        "Casey: Yeah, anyone can come.",
        "Maddie: So people can bring guests? Like dates?",
        "Casey: I guess, yeah. All right, I'll be right back. Break it up, you guys.",
        "Will: What do you want?",
        "Casey: Your wife. We've got a party to plan.",
        "Will: Did you finish your finals today?",
        "Casey: Yeah, this morning. Man, Calc was a monster.",
        "Will: Yeah, you're in Nate's class, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah, dude, he was, like, the first one done. The rest of us barely finished.",
        "Gwen: Hey, don't listen to him.",
        "Casey: You've got it this afternoon, right?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "Will: I better go.",
        "Gwen: Okay, good luck.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Casey: You're gonna need it.",
        "Gwen: Hey, knock it off.",
        "Will: So, I'll meet you back here.",
        "Gwen: Okay, later. Bye.",
        "Jade: Its zero hour. What's it gonna be? Party on or party over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I am not stalking anyone.",
        "Lily: What would you call it?",
        "Damian: Showing concern for my son.",
        "Lily: You've been out of his life for years.",
        "Damian: How can I argue with you? You're even more beautiful when you're expecting. I remember when you carried Luciano.",
        "Lily: Okay, that's it. Don't! Please, please, don't.",
        "Damian: Lily -- listen, I just -- I just wanted to tell you how happy I am for you and Holden. Truly. Is he here?",
        "Lily: No. No, he's not. He's away on business. And he's going to be very upset when he hears that you've decided to just pop in.",
        "Damian: He has nothing to fear from me, Lily. I have great respect for Holden's position as Luke's father.",
        "Lily: This is how you show respect? Spying on our son? Hiding behind trees and bushes? Luke is spooked. He thinks I have a private investigator following him.",
        "Damian: Why would he think such a thing of his own mother?",
        "Lily: He's a teenager.",
        "Damian: I don't understand.",
        "Lily: No, you don't understand. You don't understand who Luke is and what he's going through right now.",
        "Damian: That was never my choice.",
        "Lily: You made a promise back in Malta, that you would never interfere in our lives again.",
        "Damian: To keep Luciano safe. And I've kept my promise, Cara.",
        "Lily: Do you have any idea what that boy has been through the past few months?",
        "Damian: I can only imagine.",
        "Lily: No, you can't imagine. He's missed months of school. He's trying to fit in with his friends.",
        "Damian: Surely he fits in. He's smart, handsome --",
        "Lily: He sees himself quite differently than the rest of the world does. It's a confusing time.",
        "Damian: Yes, I remember. But also a very exciting time, too, no? Discovering life, discovering love, beautiful girls --",
        "Lily: Well, he has not had time for many relationships, because he's been in the hospital so much. It's hard to catch up when you've been away as much as he has.",
        "Damian: He will catch up. He'll be fine. He's my son.",
