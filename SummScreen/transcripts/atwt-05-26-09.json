        "Larry: Alison, are you okay?",
        "Alison: What are you doing here?",
        "Larry: You invited me.",
        "Emily: No, no. I'm -- Larry, I'm sorry. There's been a huge misunderstanding.",
        "Larry: Oh. Oh, I under -- stand. You -- you didn't expect me to come. And that's entirely my fault. But, hey, I'm here, Honey. So congratulations on graduating from nursing school. And with an award, no less. I am so proud of you.",
        "Alison: I didn't ask you here. I would never invite you to anything.",
        "Larry: But I got an e-mail invitation. That's the only way I would ever know to come here.",
        "Alison: Well, who would have done that?",
        "Hunter: That would be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna, come on. All I'm asking is for you to put a roof over our heads, give us a little bit of food, and then we'll be out of your hair as soon as possible, I promise.",
        "Rosanna: You promise?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: How many promises have you broken to me in the past?",
        "Paul: Rosanna, come on!",
        "Rosanna: No, you come on. I came here to start my life over. I deserve that. And I'm not gonna give it all up to get involved in your drama.",
        "Paul: And you used to say you loved what you called then my \"Unpredictability.\"",
        "Rosanna: Well -- we were very different people back then. But I have been through a lot, and some of it's been because of you. So if you could just leave me alone, just let me have a little peace.",
        "Paul: I -- I get it. I -- [Paul sighs] Yeah, peace. If Eliza and I had a place where we had no problems and no worries, I wouldn't let anybody jeopardize that. I would never let anybody take that away from us.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you for understanding.",
        "Paul: I do. I understand. Eliza -- she's gonna be mad at you for the rest of her life, but -- okay. Good-bye.",
        "Rosanna: Good-bye, Paul, for good this time.",
        "[Eliza cries]",
        "Rosanna: Hey. Is she okay? Why is she crying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hunter, why would you do that to me?",
        "Hunter: I thought you would like it.",
        "Alison: Do I look as if I like it?",
        "Hunter: Not so much. I had no idea the situation with your father was that bad?",
        "Emily: Because you don't listen, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Alison, I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help you --",
        "Casey: Okay, forget it. It doesn't matter. Alison, what -- what do you want to do now?",
        "Larry: If everybody could just calm down. Uh, I can see that my being here is a result of a mistake. But maybe we can make something good come out of this.",
        "Emily: Yeah, like turning dysfunctional lemons into lemonade?",
        "Larry: Something like that. [Larry clears throat] Alison did not choose to include me tonight. I get that. But I'm here. And I would really appreciate a chance to tell my daughter just how proud I am of her accomplishments.",
        "Alison: Is that supposed to mean something to me, that you're proud?",
        "Larry: I know it might seem too little, too late --",
        "Alison: I'll tell you what would mean something -- if you had ever once taken any interest in my life at all, if you had just called me on one stupid birthday!",
        "Larry: I know I missed a lot, Alison, and I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Alison: You want to know what I'm sorry about? The fact that you thought that I would be desperate enough or pathetic enough to want you to be here today. Because I will never be that desperate, and I never want to see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Eliza cries]",
        "Paul: It's nothing. She's probably just hungry, you know? It's been a -- a while since lunch. Isn't that right, Eliza?",
        "Rosanna: You have a bottle for her?",
        "Paul: Well, there's some left of the bottle that you were so generous in giving me before.",
        "Rosanna: Give me the bottle. I'll fill it up.",
        "Paul: Yeah. She's probably just on a growth spurt, you know, 'cause she's just -- she's eating more with -- with every feeding.",
        "Rosanna: Don't say I never did anything for you.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Paul: Look, do you mind if I just, uh, feed her here. 'Cause, you know, the car is all the way over there. She's -- she's obviously starving.",
        "Rosanna: I don't suppose that would do any harm.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: Wow. [Rosanna laughs] She really is hungry.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. Look at her. She eats like a wrestler. In fact, she's gonna grow up to be a sumo wrestler -- with a PhD, of course, because she's strong and she's smart. And she's just so beautiful.",
        "Rosanna: She is so beautiful.",
        "Paul: You want to hold her?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I don't know. I mean, I -- I don't want to disturb her.",
        "Paul: No, it wouldn't be disturbing her. Not at all.",
        "Rosanna: Edna, hi. Um, I was just wondering if I, uh, could take your shift today, and then maybe we could switch over tomorrow to get the schedule back on track?",
        "Edna: That's fine with me.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, great. Oh -- oh, that's, uh, just somebody I knew from before. He stopped by to say hello, and his baby started fussing, so he's feeding her. What?",
        "Edna: There's something about him I don't like.",
        "Rosanna: Right. Don't worry, okay? Um, he'll be gone soon.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Paul: Who was that?",
        "Rosanna: Just one of the members of the co-op. It was her shift, but I'm -- I'm taking it today.",
        "Paul: Yeah? Just one big, happy family around here, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Yeah. It's really nice to be part of a community where people actually enjoy helping each other out.",
        "Paul: Really? Didn't think a place like that existed. I can understand why you feel so safe here. Look, would you please just let us stay?",
        "Rosanna: Paul, you promised.",
        "Paul: I know, but I'm asking you to reconsider, for my daughter's sake.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: You must think I'm an idiot.",
        "Paul: No, I don't think you're an idiot.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really? You're using every trick in the book -- trying to get me to hold your daughter, uh, talking about old times. What are you trying to prove?",
        "Paul: I am trying to prove that you are not as disconnected from your past as you would like to think that you are! Because the Rosanna that I know would never let an innocent child come in harm's way.",
        "Rosanna: Do you mind? Stop trying to make me feel like I'm a heartless person for not trying to help your daughter? I can see that you love her, okay?",
        "Paul: Yes, I do.",
        "Rosanna: I can tell that you're devoted to her.",
        "Paul: I would do anything on earth to keep her happy and healthy. That's why she needs to stay with me.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then, let her stay with you. But you can't stay here, okay? I'm not letting all of your confusion and chaos back into my life.",
        "Paul: I'm not asking you to.",
        "Rosanna: You don't have to even ask me to, because it just surrounds you. Chaos follows you everywhere you go. Even a complete stranger like Edna can pick up on it.",
        "Paul: What did she say?",
        "Rosanna: Nothing. She said nothing, okay? She just sensed a vibe. Please, I'm putting my whole life here in jeopardy with you just being here. Please leave.",
        "Paul: All right. You know what? I understand. I do. I don't want to, but I do.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, if you -- if you need milk or food or anything like that, I would be happy to give you plenty -- everything that you need. But you have to leave after that.",
        "Paul: There's a cop. There's a cop.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. That's just Len. He -- he comes here every day around this time.",
        "Paul: Len. Yeah, I don't care. He's a cop. I need to get out of here, or I need to hide. Is there someplace I can hide?",
        "Rosanna: Um, yeah. Give -- give me her. Um, just go over there and pretend like you're doing something useful. Hey, Len! It's good to see you. You're looking well.",
        "Len: Well, if looks mean anything, you're doing mighty fine yourself.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Len: Who's the baby?",
        "Rosanna: That's, uh, Edna's granddaughter. Isn't she a cutie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do you see what you started? Next time, stick to your computer!",
        "Hunter: I should -- I should probably go.",
        "Emily: Yeah. That -- that is the best idea you've had all day.",
        "Susan: Emily, I'm so sorry. I had an emergency. What the hell are you doing here?!",
        "Casey: Ali. Ali, wait. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I don't know. Should I have stayed and talked to him, to Larry?",
        "Casey: No, no. Not if you didn't want to.",
        "Alison: I just keep remembering his face that night I went to his home in Chicago, the way that he just looked through me like I wasn't even there.",
        "Casey: Don't think about that, okay? He's not worth it. And he doesn't deserve a daughter like you.",
        "Hunter: Alison, I am so sorry.",
        "Casey: Hunter, please -- please, not now.",
        "Alison: Case, its fine. Listen, there's no way you could have known that things were this messed up between my father and me, but for the future, could you please just stay out of my business?",
        "Hunter: Look, I only wanted to make you happy.",
        "Casey: Oh, bull, man! We -- we all know you wanted to score points.",
        "Hunter: \"Points\"?",
        "Casey: Yes. You have a thing for Ali.",
        "Alison: Casey --",
        "Hunter: I wouldn't call it a \"Thing\" exactly.",
        "Casey: Whatever it is, you need to get over it now, okay? You wanting to help her is only hurting her.",
        "Hunter: Alison, I never meant to hurt you. I was just trying --",
        "Casey: Listen! This is the deal. I love Alison, okay? And any help she needs, she's gonna get it from me. Come on. Let's get out of here. You don't need to deal with strangers right now. Let's go to my house.",
        "Larry: The only reason that I came here was because I was invited. I had every reason to believe that she wanted to see me, too.",
        "Susan: Well, she didn't! She didn't. So don't let the door hit you on the way out.",
        "Larry: Well, I can't just disappear, Susan. Alison and I need some time to just work this through.",
        "Susan: You've had years to work this through. It's too late now.",
        "Larry: It is not up to you!",
        "Susan: It's certainly not up to you!",
        "Emily: It's not up to either one of you!",
        "Susan: Who -- whose side are you on?",
        "Emily: Alison's! How the hell is any of this supposed to help her? That poor girl was just blindsided, and all the two of you can focus on is who hurt whom!",
        "Larry: Look, all I want to do is talk to my daughter!",
        "Susan: Who obviously doesn't want to talk to you!",
        "Emily: You know, at this point, Alison doesn't even know what she wants.",
        "Susan: What she doesn't need is you back in her life!",
        "Larry: And what I don't need is any of this! Clearly it was a mistake to come here.",
        "[Susan scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, he's just temporary. He's helping us restock the shelves. Hey, Bill, can you go to the back and get some more, uh, canned beans, please? Thank you.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Len: I, uh, had fun at the movies last week.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Thank you. So did I. That was great.",
        "Len: Would you care to join me for another tomorrow night?",
        "Rosanna: Tomorrow night? Um -- you know what? I have community hours I have got to catch up on tomorrow, but I would love to. Can you give me a call next week?",
        "Len: I will do just that.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Thanks, Len. I'm looking forward to it.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Don't thank me. I have no idea why I just did that? I just want you to be straight with me, okay? Why would a court return Eliza to Meg if -- if they're already declared Meg an unfit mother?",
        "Paul: Well, Meg claims that I might have manipulated the situation a little bit, that I -- that I may have lied to, uh, make her seem unfit.",
        "Rosanna: Is there any truth in that?",
        "Paul: The only truth is that Meg does not deserve to have custody of our little girl.",
        "Rosanna: Because she's not the person you thought she was?",
        "Paul: Because I thought that Meg and I were very happy, but it turns out that I was just buying whatever fairy tale I needed to believe in, because in the end, she betrayed me with Dusty.",
        "Rosanna: So you're saying that after she cheated on Craig with you, she cheated on you with Dusty. I'm -- I'm shocked, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I was, uh -- I was a little angry when I found out. I went a little nuts. I admit it. I was a little crazy. I -- I spent -- I spent some time in a padded cell, and --",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Paul --",
        "Paul: No, I'm fine now. But after we started to split up, we started to fight over custody. And do you know what Meg did then? She tried to make it impossible to me to have a relationship with my own little girl.",
        "Rosanna: Why would she do that?",
        "Paul: I don't know. She insisted that I have supervised visits, like I was some kind of twisted freak who -- who couldn't be trusted to spend time with his own little girl. And I couldn't -- I couldn't stand that.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, what did you do?",
        "Paul: What? I -- I pulled some strings.",
        "Rosanna: What kind of strings?",
        "Paul: I -- well, maybe some money changed hands.",
        "Rosanna: Which resulted in Meg being declared unfit?",
        "Paul: And now she's figured out a way to fight back. Which is why I can't let the police find me.",
        "Rosanna: Because you kidnapped Eliza.",
        "Paul: No! I couldn't let Meg take my daughter away from me! I couldn't -- I couldn't let that happen!",
        "Rosanna: Oh, boy.",
        "Paul: All I have ever wanted is a family!",
        "Rosanna: I --",
        "Paul: No. Meg -- she and I, you know, we were gonna do that. I was gonna have a life with Meg -- she and I and our little girl.",
        "Rosanna: I know how much you wanted that, Paul, probably more than anybody else.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, she's made that impossible now, okay? So you want to blame somebody for what's happening, you blame Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Look, even -- even if it's true -- why should I do anything more to help you?",
        "Paul: Because you owe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Larry: We meet again.",
        "Hunter: Oh, Dr. McDermott. Excellent timing. \"Please accept my sincere apology for having interfered in your family relationships.\"",
        "Larry: What are you doing?",
        "Hunter: Apologizing.",
        "Larry: There's no need to apologize to me. Your e-mail was a real wake-up call. It's long past time I make amends with my daughter. Hopefully it's not too late. Do you have any idea where Alison might have gone after she left the Lakeview?",
        "Hunter: I'm very bad at lying, so please don't make me answer that question.",
        "Larry: Alison and I should try to connect at least once more before she writes me out of her life entirely.",
        "Hunter: Maybe you should wait until she gets in touch with you.",
        "Larry: Hunter, you sent me this invitation because you thought it was a good idea.",
        "Hunter: It wasn't.",
        "Larry: What if it was? What if Alison's just figuring this out now that she's had time to process things?",
        "Hunter: Okay. She went home with Casey -- with her boyfriend, Casey. Um, I can give you the GPS coordinates to his house, if you like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm -- I'm sorry your celebration turned into such a disaster.",
        "Alison: Which had nothing to do with you and your wonderful idea.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it kind of did. If I hadn't had that wonderful idea, the prince of dorkness wouldn't have invited your father. What? What was that for?",
        "Alison: For trying to make me feel better.",
        "Casey: You know what I bet will make you feel better? A little food. I know I can't give you a filet mignon like the Lakeview, but I make a pretty awesome peanut butter and jelly sandwich.",
        "Alison: Ooh! I love peanut butter and jelly.",
        "Casey: Good.",
        "Alison: Wow. I was gonna get a filet mignon?",
        "Casey: The sky was the limit. I wasn't footing the bill.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Casey: What kind of jelly do you want?",
        "Alison: What kind do you have?",
        "Casey: Hmm. Strawberry, grape --",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Alison: Casey --",
        "Casey: Um, uh, jelly. Yes, we have s --",
        "Alison: That was my father at the door.",
        "Casey: He's hurt you enough for a lifetime. Don't let him keep doing it.",
        "Alison: Thank you, but I can handle this. Wait. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, I'm really happy for you that you could build this whole new life for yourself, but not everybody is so lucky.",
        "Rosanna: Why don't you just get to the part where I'm supposed to owe you?",
        "Paul: Look, the point is that -- that your brand-new life doesn't automatically erase your past, okay? I don't need to remind you that we are all guilty of making mistakes.",
        "Rosanna: No, Paul, you don't.",
        "Paul: You paid off a lab technician to make sure that I didn't find out that I was the father of Meg's baby.",
        "Rosanna: And why was I driven to do something like that? Did it come out of nowhere?",
        "Paul: If I had known that that child was mine, I never would have let Meg stay with Craig. I never would have fought with Craig. Meg and I would never have lost our baby.",
        "Rosanna: Don't you blame that on me. I'm not the one who made Meg fall. That was you!",
        "Paul: I'm not trying to heap all of the blame on you. I know I had my own -- my own culpability here. But -- but put yourself in my shoes, okay? I have a chance to be a father again, okay? And you -- you have a chance to make up for everything that you cost us. Come on. You're gonna give that up. You say that you want to make a brand-new life here. Don't you want to wipe the slate completely clean? I'll tell you what. You help me now, and we're even.",
        "Rosanna: It's not that simple.",
        "Paul: Yes, it is that simple. I could lose my child again, and this time, you can do something about it. I'll tell you what. You do this for me, and I'll keep your little secret, and you can stay here and have this life, such as it is, for as long as you choose.",
        "Rosanna: Wow. That sort of sounds like a threat.",
        "Paul: All I'm asking for is a few days of anonymity. It's the same thing you've been enjoying here. Seems like a pretty fair exchange to me.",
        "Edna: You still here?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Edna, uh -- my friend would like to stay for a few days. Can you make that happen?",
        "Paul: My daughter and I -- we're not looking for any handouts. We'll work for anything that we use.",
        "Edna: We don't take in strangers.",
        "Rosanna: I know. But he's not asking to stay with us permanently. Just -- just for a few days. I know you're gonna have to run this by the committee, but I'm sure if you say that its okay, then the others will, too. I wouldn't even ask if -- if it wasn't for his daughter. I mean, look at her. She's been stuck in a car seat for God knows how long, and they just need a -- a few days of shelter to -- to rest up, and then they'll be on their way, I promise.",
        "Paul: We will. And we are so grateful for any compassion that you can afford. We recently lost her mother.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Paul: We're just trying to leave -- you know, go somewhere and start a new life away from all of the bad memories. We're just looking for someplace to rest up for a few days before the rest of the trip.",
        "Edna: I'm not promising anything.",
        "Rosanna: I really appreciate you considering it. Thank you so much.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "[Rosanna groans]",
        "Rosanna: Please. I didn't do this for you.",
        "Paul: Well, Eliza would thank you if she could.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you tried to guilt me just a second ago into letting you stay here, and then you -- when that didn't work, you resorted to blackmail. So just save the hearts and flowers until we find out what the committee decides.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: \"Please accept my sincere apology --\"",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Hunter: \"-- For having interfered in your family relationships.\"",
        "Emily: You're kidding me.",
        "Hunter: No, I'm apologizing sincerely. Did you miss that part? \"Please accept my sincere apology for having interfered in your family relationships.\"",
        "Emily: You are really bad at this.",
        "Hunter: Which is why I wrote it down. Will you please wait till the end? \"My actions were inexcusable, and I deeply regret --\" I'm not finished.",
        "Emily: Yes, you are! Who does this? Who -- who recites an apology wrote on a napkin?!",
        "Hunter: Look, when I'm upset or nervous or generally emotional, I find it easier to write my thoughts down than just say them. It -- it's important to me to make it really clear how so sorry I am that I invited Alison's father to town.",
        "Emily: I can see that. I can see that, and I'm sorry that I was so hard on you. [Emily sighs] Look, my family has a -- a lot of issues. And maybe if -- if things had been handled in a better way, and Ali's father -- he might have been able to repair some of the damage. But -- I don't know. It's too late now.",
        "Hunter: Not necessarily.",
        "Emily: Why not necessarily?",
        "Hunter: Oh, God. Please don't make me answer that question.",
        "Emily: What have you done now, Hunter?",
        "Hunter: Okay. I ran in to Alison's father at Java, and I told him where to find her.",
        "Emily: What part of \"Mind your own business\" didn't you understand?! [Emily groans] You know what? You're gonna be needing this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'll leave you two with some privacy.",
        "Alison: You don't have to. I mean, it's your house.",
        "Casey: Which is why I'll be in my room just a few feet away in case you need me. Okay?",
        "Larry: I'm sorry my surprised appearance spoiled your celebration.",
        "Alison: It's okay.",
        "Larry: You're -- you're just saying that because you know that's far from the worst thing I've ever done to you.",
        "Alison: It's not like I expected much.",
        "Larry: But you have a right to. People should expect things from their fathers.",
        "Alison: Oh, so now you're my father.",
        "Larry: I haven't acted like one over the years.",
        "Alison: That day I showed up on your doorstep, a stranger would have made me feel more welcome.",
        "Larry: And I have never stopped kicking myself for that.",
        "Alison: You have no idea what it feels like to feel like your own father doesn't want you.",
        "Larry: Ali --",
        "Alison: When I was little, I would tell myself, \"Daddy just lost our address. That's why he didn't send a card. Or Daddy just, you know, forgot our phone number, and that's why he never calls.\" But then I got too old to tell myself that, and after a while, I had to say that maybe he just forgot about me.",
        "Larry: But I didn't. I never forgot about you.",
        "Alison: That day in Chicago, you took my hope away. You made me see that I don't matter to you at all.",
        "Larry: But that's not true. That will never be true. I thought about you every single day. Honey, I -- I let you believe that I didn't love you. And for that, I'll never be able to forgive myself.",
        "Alison: Then why did you do it?",
        "Larry: I didn't mean to. Look, in the years before you came, there was a lot going on in my life.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. Your new family.",
        "Larry: Yes. I remarried. We had children. They never replaced you. We went through some -- some difficult times. And when those times were over, it had been so long since we had talked, and I -- I couldn't just pick up the phone and whatever. What if you hung up on me or -- or told me you hated me or told me you never wanted to see me again.",
        "Alison: How could that have been worse?",
        "Larry: You talked about my taking your hope away. You turning your back on me would have taken mine away. I -- I couldn't bear it. Ali, when I got that e-mail, I thought, \"Here's my chance. Finally, I have a chance to tell my daughter how proud I am of her.\"",
        "Alison: Well, maybe it's a good thing you never got that chance before, because a couple of years ago, you wouldn't have liked me, let alone been proud of me.",
        "Larry: Oh, that's not true. I would have loved you. Look at you. You're beautiful. You're accomplished. Y -- you have a young man in there who would tear me apart to protect you. That's the kind of devotion you deserve.",
        "Alison: You're right. I do deserve that.",
        "Larry: Whatever you've done in the past, you have more than made up for it. There is no way that I can make up for the time that I have lost with you.",
        "Alison: No, there isn't.",
        "Larry: But I want you to know you have always had a place in my heart -- always -- even when you didn't know it. And I can only hope that one day, I could have a place in yours.",
        "Alison: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Larry: You don't have to say anything. Look, I -- if the day comes when you do want to say something, call me, anytime. Whenever we see each other again -- if we see each other again, it'll be entirely up to you. So long, Alison.",
        "Alison: So long. Bye.",
        "[Ali cries]",
        "Casey: Ali, are you okay? What -- what did he say to you? I'm sorry. I should never have left you.",
        "Alison: No, I'm fine, Case. I'm better than fine. At least I -- I would be better if I had a tissue.",
        "Casey: Yes, of course. Yes, this is free of charge. No --",
        "Alison: It's funny. All those years, I thought of my father as this heartless monster, but seeing him today, I realize that he's not. He's just this scared, unhappy man.",
        "Casey: Of course he's unhappy. Anybody losing you -- they got to be unhappy.",
        "Alison: I mean, he was the one looking for my approval. Can you believe that?",
        "Casey: About time he wised up.",
        "Alison: You want to know the weirdest thing?",
        "Casey: Opposed to all the perfectly normal things that happened today? I don't know.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Yeah. The minute I realized that he actually accepted me, it didn't matter anymore. I didn't need his approval, and I just -- I felt myself let go. Do you think it's possible that it could be that simple?",
        "Casey: Knowing you, no.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Fair enough. He gave me his card and said it was up to me if and when we would see each other again.",
        "Casey: Are you gonna call him?",
        "Alison: I have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Look, you said yourself it might be a good idea if Alison talks to her father.",
        "Emily: Yeah, if she wants to. That's her decision to make, not yours. Why can't you just stay out of it?",
        "Hunter: It seemed like the right thing to do.",
        "[Emily groans]",
        "Alison: Hey, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hey. Honey, Hunter told me he sicced Larry on you again. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: I'm fine.",
        "Emily: Are you sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Actually, I was glad he came by. We, uh, cleared the air about a lot of things, and I -- I feel pretty good about it.",
        "Emily: He's not standing there holding a gun to your head, making you say those things, is he?",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: No. No gun. But listen, can I call you with the details later?",
        "Emily: Yeah, you'd better.",
        "Hunter: Well?",
        "Emily: She's okay. So you're off the hook, this time. But don't push your luck.",
        "Hunter: I won't. Helping people is entirely too stressful.",
        "Emily: Uh, what's -- what's in the bag?",
        "Hunter: Sandwich.",
        "Emily: What kind?",
        "Hunter: Roast beef.",
        "Emily: Mustard or mayo?",
        "Hunter: Mustard. Why?",
        "Emily: I'm starving, and thanks to you, I didn't get to eat.",
        "Hunter: Am I supposed to offer you half my sandwich now?",
        "Emily: Good boy, Hunter. There's hope for you yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, how about that PB&J?",
        "Alison: In a minute. Um, right now, I want to ask you a question.",
        "Casey: Shoot.",
        "Alison: Remember when we were in Oldtown and -- and we ran into Hunter, and he said that he wanted to help me?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: And you said that you would be the one to help me --",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: -- Because, um -- because you love me?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Did you say that just to get rid of him, or did you mean it?",
        "Casey: It just kind of slipped out. I -- I wasn't trying to make you feel uncomfortable. I -- I wasn't expecting you to answer back, either.",
        "Alison: Shut up, Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well?",
        "Rosanna: Committee had a lot of questions about you.",
        "Paul: So what did you tell them?",
        "Rosanna: Don't worry. The last thing I'd tell them is the truth.",
        "Paul: And -- and what about Edna? You said that she didn't trust me.",
        "Rosanna: She doesn't. Lucky for you, she trusts me. So based on my word, they're gonna let you and Eliza stay, just for a few days. There's a room in the back with a cot, and we can set up a crib and feed you guys for the next few days. But then after that, you have to leave.",
        "Paul: Thank you. How can I thank you? Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.",
        "Rosanna: You know, if I were you, I wouldn't waste a whole lot of time thanking me. This isn't gonna be a picnic, you know?",
        "Paul: Okay. Hey, look, I'm up for whatever, you know? Early to bed, early to rise. I get it. You know, \"Do unto others,\" all that jazz.",
        "Rosanna: These people are helping you. Don't make fun of them.",
        "Paul: I'm not.",
        "Rosanna: You're gonna be expected to pay for everything that you use.",
        "Paul: Okay, I am maybe a little. I'm sorry. I will.",
        "Rosanna: Don't make me regret this.",
        "Paul: Aw, don't worry about it, okay? I'm not gonna -- I'm not gonna tell anybody your secret.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, these people have been good to me. They helped me. They took me in when I had nothing.",
        "Rosanna: What is your problem? What are you smiling about?",
        "Paul: What? I can't just be happy?",
        "Rosanna: You're never just anything, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe I am, you know? Look at me. I'm in this beautiful place with my beautiful little girl. I have a few days to figure out what to do next. And it's really -- it's all because of you. And I can't help but think that maybe, maybe, it's destiny that has brought me here with you.",
        "Rosanna: \"Destiny\"?",
        "Paul: Yes. Maybe I'm seeing you now for some larger purpose.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. Cut it out.",
        "Paul: You said so yourself before. It's happened. Look, you -- you said that I woke you up from your coma. And in a way, you're bringing me back to life now.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you got what you wanted, so you don't have to sweet-talk me anymore.",
        "Paul: I'm not sweet-talking you. Hey. You and I -- we loved each other once in a way that few people understand. And no matter what's happened since, that will always connect us.",
        "Rosanna: Honestly, Paul, I don't know if I believe in mystical connections anymore. But, one thing I do know is that if you betray me or bring any harm to this community whatsoever, love or no love, you're on your own.",

        "[Casey mumbles]",
        "Casey: Hold up.",
        "Alison: Where are you going?",
        "Casey: I'm -- I'm gonna make that sandwich I promised you.",
        "Alison: I'm not in the mood for a sandwich anymore.",
        "Casey: How about a burger at Al's?",
        "Alison: Am I acting like I want to go out and get a burger at Al's?",
        "Casey: I just thought you'd be hungry. I know you would want to get something to eat before I took you home.",
        "Alison: I'm not hungry anymore.",
        "Casey: So does that mean you want to go straight home?",
        "Alison: Where are your parents?",
        "Casey: They're in Chicago at a concert. They're gonna be there all night.",
        "Alison: What happens if I decide I want to stay here tonight?",
        "Casey: Are you sure?",

        "Susan: As long as that's all it takes.",
        "Larry: You were right.",
        "Susan: I'm listening.",
        "Larry: I walked out of our discussion at the Lakeview because I didn't like the mirror you were holding up. Didn't show me in a very flattering light.",
        "Susan: Go on.",
        "Larry: You're not making this very easy.",
        "Susan: What do you want me to do, disagree with you?",
        "Larry: Look, um, I have to face some very difficult things about myself, one in particular that I've been a terrible father to our daughter.",
        "Susan: I am not the one you should be saying that to.",
        "Larry: I already apologized to Alison.",
        "Susan: When was that?",
        "Larry: A little while ago. And while I probably don't deserve it, I'm hoping that she will find it in her heart to forgive me. And if she does, then perhaps you could, too.",
