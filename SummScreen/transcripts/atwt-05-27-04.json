        "Margo: So these are from you?",
        "Doc: Granted, you deserve a lot more for getting my ex off my back. I just figured tickets to Rio might be a little premature.",
        "Margo: Ya think?",
        "Doc: Mm-hmm. I tell ya, I had to jump in a cold shower watching you do pushups the other day. So I figured a few dumbbell curls might really spice up our relationship.",
        "Margo: What relationship? You know what, I oughta throw you out right on your dumbbells.",
        "Doc: Oh, you won't. And you know why? Let me tell you, because you want something to happen between us just as much as I do.",
        "Margo: Doc, what could possibly happen? I'm a married woman. I'm an officer of the law. Why are you pushing your luck?",
        "Doc: 'Cause you intrigue me. Tough as nails -- soft as silk -- and I told you, I don't wanna bust up your life. I just want to be alone with you.",
        "Margo: And you think that's gonna happen?",
        "Doc: Indeed, I do. 'Cause I go to bed thinking about you. When I wake up, you're still right there on my mind. Now, unless I'm losing my touch -- which I doubt -- I'll bet good money I've been on your mind, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What's all this?",
        "Chris: It's an anniversary surprise for Mom and Dad.",
        "Nancy: We just thought they deserved a little celebration after all -- let's see -- I don't know -- it's been so long, I've forgotten how many years it is.",
        "Chris: Hey, Ali, no pressure, but you didn't happen to finish that new anniversary plate, did you?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it's not gonna look quite exactly like the other one.",
        "Chris: I'm sure it'll be just as beautiful. And I told Mom and Dad I'd pick them up. So, I'll see you later.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Nancy: Did you make a plate, really, Alison?",
        "Alison: Aaron was gonna buy me another one, but I guess he couldn't come up with the money. And who would've ever thought this plate would be so expensive? So, I had to make one. But --",
        "Nancy: It's --",
        "Alison: It's a disaster, I know.",
        "Nancy: Well, you did misspell \"anniversary.\" Don't you think it's time you told Chris the truth? It'll be all right, darling. He loves you.",
        "Alison: Sure he does now. But not after he finds out what a phony I am.",
        "Nancy: Well, I'm afraid that's a risk you're just gonna have to take.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Are you Annabelle Fettle?",
        "Annabelle: Who's askin'?",
        "Jennifer: The person you're supposed to meet.",
        "Annabelle: Sorry, cookie, I'm meeting Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Jennifer: No, you're not. I'm the one who called you. You and I need to have a conversation about Jordan Sinclair.",
        "Annabelle: You've got a lot of nerve tricking me into a meeting. I don't even know you.",
        "Jennifer: My name is Jennifer Munson. The chief of detectives is my father. I think you might have met him on one of your trips to Oakdale? Now, would you like to have a seat and tell me why Rosanna Cabot is trying to coerce Jordan into adopting her baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: This is insane, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I've been called worse.",
        "Walker: You're leaving the hospital early as it is. You should be going straight home.",
        "Barbara: And I will. As soon as you make a little stop along the way.",
        "Walker: Do I have to remind you you're recovering from brain surgery? Why choose a time like now to make it a mission to see your ex-husband?",
        "Barbara: Because James is up to something, and I have to find out what it is.",
        "Walker: What kind of trouble could he cause from a federal prison?",
        "Barbara: You obviously don't know the man. But whatever is involving Jordan Sinclair affects my family. And I have to nip it in the bud -- now.",
        "Walker: I can't allow it.",
        "Barbara: Well, guess what? You should have noticed something by now -- when I set my mind to a task, I generally get it done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: What a treat. What a treat. My favorite ex-wife. I see you survived surgery. Your eyes are dazzling, sparkling --",
        "Barbara: Enough, James. You know what I risked by coming here.",
        "James: Yes, I do. And I'm touched. I'm really touched. I mean, you could have chosen -- after a brush with near blindness, to feast your eyes on the sunset, the smile of your youngest child. But yet, you chose to come and see me.",
        "Barbara: You're playing puppet master with Jordan Sinclair, Rosanna Cabot and her baby. Why?",
        "James: I'm sorry, darling. I don't see how any of this concerns you.",
        "Barbara: If it concerns Jordan, it concerns me, my company, my daughter and my son. So whatever you're trying to do? Stop it, James! Right now.",
        "James: Too late for ultimatums, Barbara. What's done is done -- and cannot be undone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Paul: I got your message. What's going on? This is the DNA test?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it's awful. It turns out that Jordan is Cabot's biological father. James was telling the truth all along.",
        "Paul: Jordan has no idea that he's fathered a child, right? Let alone that it's Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: No. He said that he's always been extremely careful.",
        "Paul: Not careful enough. So, now what?",
        "Carly: What do you mean \"now what\"? Obviously, Rosanna is gonna tell Jordan the truth. Aren't you, Rosanna? Aren't you?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Doc, there is a big difference between thinking and doing.",
        "Doc: But, you do think about me?",
        "Margo: Yes. I mean -- no! I mean --",
        "Doc: Time out. Time out. Time out. Your cheeks are turning the most delicious shade of peach.",
        "Jessica: Margo --",
        "Margo: Jess.",
        "Jessica: I can come back later.",
        "Doc: No. Madame attorney, why don't you stay? I was just leaving.",
        "Margo: I'll be right back. I just wanna make sure that Mr. Reese finds his way out.",
        "Doc: Wait, wait, wait, wait -- you are not getting off that easy.",
        "Margo: What? This is easy?",
        "Doc: Listen, I'm going to the Lakeview to have a drink. Meet me in the lounge in about half an hour. I'll get a room, leave you a key. It'll be discreet. Just you and me -- alone.",
        "Margo: What, Doc? What is it about \"no\" that you don't understand?",
        "Doc: I understand the word \"no.\" I just haven't heard you say it. See you at the Lakeview.",
        "Margo: Jess -- don't say a word!",
        "Jessica: I wasn't. About doc? I wasn't. I just need to talk to my friend.",
        "Margo: Oh, jess -- I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Jessica: I will be if I can cry on your shoulder. Margo, you're the only person I can talk to right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Let me guess. Gin?",
        "Annabelle: Make it a double. So what's it to you if Jordan Sinclair has to adopt Rosanna Cabot's baby?",
        "Jennifer: He is a co-worker of mine. And he's also my friend.",
        "Annabelle: That better be all he is. He's a married man, you know.",
        "Jennifer: Which I fully respect. But Jordan didn't expect to be forced to sign papers making him Cabot's father. I need to know who's behind that? And why.",
        "Annabelle: I told you I'd let you buy me a drink. I didn't say I'd talk.",
        "Barbara: Tell me, James. Why are you trying to reconnect with me while this drama about Rosanna Cabot's baby is raging? This little production has your fingerprints all over it.",
        "James: For once, darling, I'm immersed in something that has very little to do with you. Are you jealous?",
        "Barbara: Paul is Rosanna's friend. My daughter is very fond of Jordan. Jordan has become indispensable at B.R.O.",
        "James: And I've done nothing wrong. In fact, I've been quite benevolent.",
        "Barbara: You helped Rosanna get her baby back?",
        "James: Yes, which was not an easy task after our reckless son caused her to lose the lad in the first place. But then, as I told Paul and Rosanna --",
        "Barbara: They were here?",
        "James: You're an exciting woman.",
        "Barbara: What did they want?",
        "James: They want the same thing that you're pretending to want. The fact is, I've been very interested in Jordan since he was a child. I'm very proud to say that I had a hand in educating him.",
        "Barbara: You knew Jordan?",
        "James: His parents have a very sentimental place in my heart -- all of this, of course, is unbeknownst to Jordan.",
        "Barbara: Why have you involved Rosanna?",
        "James: I couldn't miss the chance to reunite Jordan and his child and provide him with two perfect parents to raise the child. You, of all people know what it's like --",
        "Barbara: Wait, wait, wait a second! You're saying that Jordan is Cabot's father?",
        "James: Oh, I do miss our talks, Barbara. How you never let a word slip by --",
        "Barbara: Wait a second! Does Jordan know this? Does he know he's been forced to claim a child that's actually his?",
        "James: That's one of the mysteries of life, darling. How we resist what already belongs to us. No. Jordan doesn't know. But guess who does.",
        "Barbara: Rosanna and Paul?",
        "James: This is more fun than the Sunday crossword! You and I are still an unbeatable team, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I don't think for one minute that this has anything to do with your desire to reunite a father and a son.",
        "James: Regardless, Jordan will find out about his offspring soon enough. It's amazing how the truth does reveal itself -- drop by delicious drop.",
        "Barbara: So what is the \"truth\", James? Who is Jordan to you? Who are his parents? And what's the real intrigue behind this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna, you can't keep the truth from Jordan. He has a right to know his son! A child should know his father. It's just wrong.",
        "Rosanna: Don't presume to instruct me on morality.",
        "Carly: Paul, will you tell her? She's not thinking straight.",
        "Paul: Look, I don't know what Rosanna is thinking, but I'm sure that she's thinking clearly.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan doesn't want to be Cabot's father!",
        "Carly: He doesn't even know the kid is his, Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: He knows that he doesn't want to be in this marriage. He wants his freedom so he can be with Jennifer. And I have promised to give him that.",
        "Carly: By having some attorney draw up papers that deny him access to his own flesh and blood. Rosanna, this can't possibly be legal. And when the truth comes out --",
        "Rosanna: It won't! It won't come out, because you won't tell.",
        "Carly: Don't do that. Don't put me in this position.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on! It's only temporary.",
        "Carly: You can run. You can change your name. You can hide in some other country, Rosanna. But the truth will come out. Paul, will you help me out here? You can't possibly think what she's doing is right?",
        "Paul: Look, I'm not going to sit in judgment, Carly, and I don't think you should either.",
        "Carly: You know that your father arranged this insanity! And if Rosanna keeps the facts from Jordan, she will only get in deeper.",
        "Paul: Not necessarily --",
        "Carly: For some sick, twisted reason, James went to a lot of trouble to make sure that Rosanna married the man who is Cabot's father. Do you honestly think he's going to sit back and watch her mess with that arrangement?",
        "Paul: I support Rosanna. If this is what she thinks is the right thing to do, then that's what I'm going to help her with. But you do have to move quickly, before James finds anything out.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rosanna: Hello? Thank you so much. Okay, bye. The new agreement is ready.",
        "Carly: Doesn't a judge have to sign off on that?",
        "Rosanna: No, my lawyer took care of it all. All we have to do is move to the courthouse, have a meeting there -- Jordan shows up and he signs the papers and this whole nightmare is over.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, don't do this. You can't do this. If you think about it, you'll realize --",
        "Rosanna: Stop it. Stop telling me what I can't do! I'm doing it. I'm claiming my son for myself.",
        "Carly: Paul, don't you see that this won't work?",
        "Rosanna: Paul has vowed to be with me on this. I'm begging you to do the same. Please, Carly. I need my sister on my side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: You are not a loser. You're simply not a potter.",
        "Alison: Well, either way Chris is gonna hate me. And his parents -- they're gonna be disappointed in me also. What are they gonna say when they see that the only thing I can make on that pottery wheel is something that looks like a pancreas?",
        "Nancy: Hopefully, they'll understand, too.",
        "Alison: They just started to like me, and the only reason they accepted me was because I was actually good at something.",
        "Nancy: Bob and Kim accepted you because you're you. They didn't fall in love with your accomplishments.",
        "Alison: Bob and Kim don't love me.",
        "Nancy: I have some errands I have to run. I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Alison: Wait! You can't leave me alone with them!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I really don't mean to make this sound like a life or death situation, but Ben and I wanted this baby so badly. And when the test came back negative --",
        "Margo: Jess, I know that's disappointing. But, really, aren't you being kind of impatient? You guys haven't been trying that long.",
        "Jessica: But we have been doing everything by the book, which, by the way, is as romantic as it sounds. You know, Ben doesn't complain, but I know it's starting to wear on him. I mean -- you know, we're used to connecting -- having a little music, some wine, relaxing. Having sex like it's some sort of exercise routine, well --",
        "Doc: Keep it going. Don't stop now. Let me spot you, baby. There you go. Nice and slow. Nice and slow. Work it. Work it for me. Looking good. Just keep working it. Let me see what you can do. Hmm? Good?",
        "Jessica: I am trying to be patient. I really am, but what if patience isn't the answer. I mean, what if we need to be doing something more, like fertility drugs, or in vitro? I mean, I can't spend the next two years trying to get pregnant naturally, when scientifically we -- Margo? Hello? Am I boring you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You couldn't have a family with Paul and me, so you assembled another?",
        "James: Yes. At a distance, of course. My mobility is a bit challenged at the moment.",
        "Barbara: And what do you get out of this madness?",
        "James: Satisfaction, Barbara. I've reunited Rosanna and her child. Paul should be grateful to me. He caused her to lose the lad in the first place. I had to make things right.",
        "Barbara: I don't believe that any of this has anything to do with Paul.",
        "James: No, I also married off a poor but very promising young man to the richest woman in Oakdale.",
        "Barbara: You toyed with the man's life!",
        "James: He's young, unseasoned, but he'll survive. He's not spineless. Not like our Paul. No. Jordan has an enriched life in front of him. He and Rosanna have a vested interest in the same child, and I presented them the opportunity to raise that child. He is the father by nature, and she's the mother by nurture. It's masterful. It's genius. Pure genius on my part.",
        "Barbara: You call it what you like, but you're growing your experiment in my back yard! Jordan works for me and for Paul, and my daughter's very fond of him. None of this is a coincidence!",
        "James: I'm sorry, darling, if my interests rub up against yours.",
        "Barbara: Take your hands off my life.",
        "James: Don't be afraid, darling.",
        "Guard: Time's up.",
        "James: I've sent you a present -- sentimental. Very sentimental.",
        "Barbara: I don't want it.",
        "James: I think you'll enjoy it, darling. Au revoir, mon ch\u00e9rie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, its Rosanna. Would you come to the suite, please? I have good news. Okay. Bye.",
        "Carly: Please don't think that I'm not on your side.",
        "Rosanna: Will you check on Cabot for me while I get ready for the courthouse?",
        "Carly: Sure.",
        "Paul: Come with you?",
        "Rosanna: I can't tell you how much it means to have you in my corner again.",
        "Paul: Carly's right about something, you know?",
        "Rosanna: What's that?",
        "Paul: My father. I'm sure he already knows that you've worked on the DNA. He has ways of watching, even from prison. He's waiting now to see what you do, now that you know the truth about Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Well, once Jordan signs the papers, Cabot and I will disappear. And by the time James figures out that I'm gone, nobody will know where I am.",
        "Paul: Where are you going?",
        "Rosanna: I think its better that you don't know that.",
        "Paul: You know, I feel like I just got my friend back. There's a lot that I want to talk to you about.",
        "Rosanna: I know.",
        "Paul: Promise me you'll be careful?",
        "Rosanna: I will.",
        "Carly: Well, he's awake -- what is this, a good-bye? Rosanna? Please don't do this.",
        "Rosanna: I may --",
        "Carly: Please don't disappear.",
        "Rosanna: I may have to. Please understand.",
        "Jordan: Got the message. What's up? I thought you said the news was good.",
        "Rosanna: It is! I promised to deliver, and I have. With the consent of both parties, the marriage and the adoption agreement can both be annulled.",
        "Jordan: Okay. Great.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. All we have to do is get to the courthouse, and we're set. Are you ready to be a free man, Jordan Sinclair?",
        "Jordan: Absolutely. No hard feelings, right, little guy?",
        "Carly: Rosanna? Please --",
        "Jordan: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As the World Turns --",
        "Walker: Who is Jordan Sinclair really? And what's the connection to your ex- husband.",
        "Barbara: I don't know, but obviously James wants me to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I'm approving this agreement.",
        "Rosanna: You mean I have sole custody?",
        "Judge: Pending Mr. Sinclair's signature.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You're safe, I got you a plate.",
        "Alison: Fantastic. But didn't you have to pay your rent and your water bill and --?",
        "Aaron: Don't worry about that.",
        "Alison: You're the best. You saved my life. Thank you.",
        "Aaron: Hey. What the hell's that?",
        "Alison: Don't worry, no one's ever gonna see that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Look, if you have something else on your mind, I can --",
        "Margo: No, no. I heard every word. It's just that I -- sometimes it's, you know, the squad room can get really distracting, and find if I close my eyes, I can focus. So -- honey, I really wish I could help. I don't see how.",
        "Jessica: I don't know, I thought maybe you could give me some insight. Tell me what to do.",
        "Margo: Wait, now -- didn't you say that this was a step-by-step process, and you weren't even going to explore more aggressive therapies until you've exhausted your first option?",
        "Jessica: But I am exhausted. And so is Ben.",
        "Margo: To be exhausted from too much sex --",
        "Jessica: It isn't the sex, okay? It's the pressure. Take my temperature every morning. Note it on my chart. Look for six highs over three lows. Careful of spikes. Calculate the optimum time of day. Now, what if all this just turns Ben off the idea? I mean, what if all this perfunctory sex makes him decide that he doesn't wanna have a baby? Our life is good the way it is. What if he thinks all this strain just isn't worth it?",
        "Margo: Well, has he actually said that?",
        "Jessica: No, he says he's in for the long haul.",
        "Margo: Well then what's the problem, Jess?",
        "Jessica: I am not interested in a long haul. Now, there's this new fertility drug, its called clomiphere citrate --",
        "Doc: You've had a good workout. Now, it's time to stretch.",
        "Jessica: And so the doctor said that I could come and see him today. Margo? Are you okay? You're all flushed. You're not having a hot flash, are you?",
        "Margo: Jessica! No, I'm so far from a hot flash stage. So, this doctor -- they wanna put you on fertility drugs right away? Well, what does Dr. Schiller think?",
        "Jessica: Well, she doesn't recommend it at this point.",
        "Margo: And Ben?",
        "Jessica: He doesn't know.",
        "Margo: Well, that doesn't sound right.",
        "Jessica: Well, I haven't even seen the doctor yet. I'm just thinking about it. What's harm is there in not telling your husband something that you're just thinking about?",
        "Margo: There's, um -- there's no harm at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Jordan, it's a good thing you showed up when you did. The sisters are having a little tiff.",
        "Jordan: About what?",
        "Paul: Teething. It doesn't look it now, but you know, Cabot's pretty uncomfortable, and, I mean, it's two schools of thought -- do you go to the doctor or you just kind of ride things out?",
        "Rosanna: And we've agreed to wait and see. Right, Carly? Listen, Jordan, why don't you just meet us at the courthouse, okay? Hearing room A.",
        "Jordan: Fine.",
        "Rosanna: Great. Thank you. See you. Hey -- shh, shh. Thank you so much for not telling Jordan. I know how hard this is for you. I do.",
        "Carly: Its Jack I'm worried about. What am I supposed to tell him, Rosanna, huh?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know, but can't you just tell him -- tell him that Cabot is mine now. Okay? And that no one is gonna take him away from me again.",
        "Carly: I wanna protect you, Rosanna. I do. Just not like this. Okay, fine. I won't say anything for now, but if I am pressed, I will not lie. I can't.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Okay.",
        "Jordan: Hey, Jen. Got great news. I'm headed to court right now. Ice the champagne.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Check please?",
        "Annabelle: Hey, I want another drink?",
        "Jennifer: I don't need you anymore. Jordan's going to court to sign away custodial rights. It's over.",
        "Annabelle: I wouldn't count on it, sweet pea. Some things can't be signed away.",
        "Jennifer: What are you talking about?",
        "Annabelle: Biology, honey. Pure and simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Its Chris and his parents!",
        "Aaron: I'm out of here.",
        "Alison: No, no -- go, go -- happy anniversary!",
        "Kim: Oh!",
        "Bob: Wow, what a surprise.",
        "Kim: Oh, this is lovely. Alison, thank you so much.",
        "Alison: Nancy decorated everything.",
        "Bob: Is she here?",
        "Alison: She just went to run an errand, but she'll be right back.",
        "Chris: What's that?",
        "Alison: It's a new plate, but I didn't have time to wrap it.",
        "Chris: Okay, no, no problem. Mom, Dad?",
        "Kim: Yeah?",
        "Chris: Alison has a surprise for you.",
        "Kim: Oh. Oh, Allie.",
        "Bob: Oh, wow.",
        "Kim: Oh, sweetie, it's beautiful, just beautiful. Honey, look at this.",
        "Bob: It's really something.",
        "Kim: Look at that glaze. Isn't it gorgeous?",
        "Bob: You know, everything you do is better than the one before.",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Bob: Hey, I'm going to take a picture of this. Don't we have one of those plate stands or something?",
        "Kim: Ah, yeah. You know what? In the credenza, I think. Try the bottom drawer.",
        "Bob: Okay.",
        "Kim: So, we've got to have a celebration. I mean, not just because it's our anniversary, 'cause of your brilliant work. Let's see.",
        "Chris: Thank you, Allie. You have made this so incredibly special for them.",
        "Kim: Oh. Oh, for heaven's sakes, Happy Anniversiry, I-R-Y. Where did this come from?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: So, was it worth it? Seeing James?",
        "Barbara: Well, he did have a lot of riddles.",
        "Walker: Well, I like riddles?",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. He told me something interesting, though, that I don't know if it's true or not.",
        "Walker: Your blood pressure's returning to normal.",
        "Barbara: Can I trust you with a confidence?",
        "Walker: You already know the answer to that.",
        "Barbara: James told me that Jordan Sinclair is the biological father of Rosanna Cabot's baby.",
        "Walker: Is that so?",
        "Barbara: I mean, they're gonna have to run a DNA test, if they haven't done that already. You don't seem very surprised by this, do you? You know something about this, don't you?",
        "Walker: I can't say.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God, it's true. Jordan is Cabot's father. What has Jen gotten herself into?",
        "Walker: Apparently a relationship with a man who doesn't know he's a father, and even in a more complicated scenario involving your ex-husband. I don't blame you for being concerned.",
        "Barbara: And so you understand why I had to go see him.",
        "Walker: Not really. All he gave you was a bad case of nerves and more questions than when you started.",
        "Nurse's aid: Excuse me, but this arrived for Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Oh.",
        "Nurse's aid: It's from a Mr. Stenbeck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: And you understand that signing this document reverses your custodial rights?",
        "Jordan: I do, your honor.",
        "Judge: The same is true of Mr. Sinclair's responsibilities to the named child.",
        "Rosanna: I completely understand.",
        "Judge: I'll take a brief recess to review the agreement in chambers.",
        "Rosanna: Well, another few minutes and you're off the hook.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You know, for such a little guy, you sure have caused a great big fuss. [Knock at door] Oh. I wonder who that could be, huh? Let's see.",
        "Jennifer: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi, Jennifer.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, you did, I'm sorry. Is something wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Um -- Rosanna confides in you, doesn't she?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Jennifer: Then you know that Jordan was named Cabot's father in the adoption agreement?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I know about that. What? You might as well spit it out.",
        "Jennifer: You know that woman, Annabelle Fettle?",
        "Carly: Um, yeah. I don't know too much about her. Why?",
        "Jennifer: She said something to me about biology, and that certain things can't be undone by a contract?",
        "Carly: Why would she say something like that?",
        "Jennifer: Do you know something about Jordan and this baby?",
        "Carly: I gotta put the little fella down. I can't help you.",
        "Jennifer: You know what this says, don't you? Does Jordan know that he's that baby's biological father? He doesn't, does he?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jennifer: And Rosanna wasn't going to tell him.",
        "Carly: Jordan said flat out that he didn't want to be that baby's father. He wants to be unencumbered.",
        "Jennifer: He didn't want to be tied to a fake marriage for two years, or be forced to be father to a child that wasn't his. This is -- this is different. It changes everything.",
        "Carly: Yes, it does.",
        "Jennifer: Carly, he's a decent man. He would want to do the right thing.",
        "Carly: I know. And if he does, he will become that baby's daddy and be tied to Rosanna forever. Is that what you want? If I were you, I would think long and hard about that before I rushed off to spill my guts.",
        "Jennifer: But it's not fair for him not to have a choice. If I don't tell him, then I'll be lying just like Rosanna.",
        "Carly: And if you do tell him, you'll change his life and yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: Oh, I see Alison has already shown you her joke plate.",
        "Kim: Yes, as a matter of fact. She was just explaining it to us.",
        "Nancy: Well, she took me in on it, too. And she said once you had seen that, that you would really appreciate what she has made for the real plate.",
        "Alison: Nancy, Nancy --",
        "Nancy: Don't be shy, Alison. Take it -- give it to Kim. Go on, go on, go on.",
        "Kim: Oh, for heaven's sakes, where did you get that?",
        "Nancy: At Alison's school. She was busy here setting up the anniversary party, and I thought the least I could do was to pick up her plate. This child has worked night and day to be sure that this plate would be ready for you on the day.",
        "Bob: Oh, there you are, Mom.",
        "Nancy: What's that?",
        "Bob: Oh, this is a gift that Alison made for our anniversary. It's a masterpiece.",
        "Kim: I'm just a little confused. You made this plate and this plate?",
        "Chris: And what about this one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Just promise me that you will be straight with Ben, huh?",
        "Jessica: I'm not keeping any secrets. Are you?",
        "Margo: What do you mean?",
        "Jessica: So, what was going on with Doc when I came in?",
        "Margo: He bought me a gift, dumbbells -- don't ask.",
        "Jessica: You've got that funny look in your eye again. Look, you don't have to baby-sit me if you're not feeling up to it.",
        "Margo: No, I'm fine.",
        "Jessica: You're sure this isn't a bad time?",
        "Doc: Meet me in the lounge in about a half an hour, I'll get a room, leave you a key. It'll be discreet. Just you and me alone.",
        "Margo: This is perfect timing.",
        "Jessica: Great. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: What does it mean?",
        "Barbara: I don't know.",
        "Walker: Well, there's more. A lock of hair. Baby teeth.",
        "Barbara: James likes to assemble a puzzle one piece at a time.",
        "Walker: Lucky for you I'm good at puzzles.",
        "Barbara: Why would he send me a picture of Cabot?",
        "Walker: Are you sure that's Cabot? The photo's pretty old. And the building she's standing in front of --",
        "Barbara: Home for orphaned and abandoned children. Do you think that this could be Jordan?",
        "Walker: Well, you said he was an orphan. Why would James have his photo?",
        "Barbara: He said that he's been interested in Jordan ever since he was a little boy.",
        "Walker: So the question is, who is Jordan Sinclair really? And what's the connection to your ex-husband?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. But, obviously, James wants me to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know you've been a saint, Jordan. You've done more for me than I could have ever expected.",
        "Jordan: You know I told myself that I would let this go, but I can't. It still bothers me. Why James Stenbeck would choose me of all people to name as Cabot's father.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we don't know that he's behind it.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, but we don't know that he isn't.",
        "Rosanna: I don't mean to sound callous, but my only concern right now is Cabot. So, I think that we should accept that we may never know.",
        "Jordan: Well, I don't know if I can do that. I've never encountered a situation this strange in my entire life.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Jordan, forget the past, you have a very bright future ahead of you. Celebrate it.",
        "Judge: I'm approving this agreement.",
        "Rosanna: You mean I have sole custody?",
        "Judge: Pending Mr. Sinclair's signature.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, don't sign that! Not until you know the truth.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lucy: I'm leaving town with Mom, right after graduation.",
        "Jennifer: She did a paternity test on Cabot and his father.",
        "Jordan: So, you know who the father is? Who is it?",
        "Carly: I know who's been pulling the strings behind this weird arrangement with Cabot. James Stenbeck."
