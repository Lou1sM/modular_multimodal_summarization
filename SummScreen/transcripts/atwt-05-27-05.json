        "Henry: Hello.",
        "Alison: Oh. Henry. I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you with the hat.",
        "Henry: I'm meeting a client. The dispatcher said to wait for him here. Where is he?",
        "Alison: Well, like I said, we're not open yet --",
        "Katie: Sorry, I'm late. Hi.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Katie: Can we get two regular coffees to go? Extra sugar for Henry. I'm so glad you were free -- I have loads of errands to run today.",
        "Henry: No, no and no.",

        "Celia: Look at this. J-lo wore something just like it at the south beach fling last April. It was in all the magazines.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, J-lo can afford it.",
        "Celia: Casey's grandmother owns the store. She'll work something out with us.",
        "Gwen: Whatever.",
        "Celia: You and Will belong together.",
        "Gwen: What do you mean?",
        "Celia: He always says that. \"Whatever.\"",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he would.",
        "Celia: What is with you today?",
        "Gwen: Nothing.",
        "Celia: We're shopping. For the prom. It's supposed to be fun?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I don't know how much fun it's gonna be.",
        "Celia: Why? Did you and Will have a fight?",
        "Gwen: Look, there's no me and Will, okay? And besides, it's not even about that.",
        "Celia: Then what is it about?",
        "Gwen: Look, I overheard you and Casey talking. About how he doesn't want us hanging out? And I think you should know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Casey remembering]",
        "Gwen: I thought I was your friend.",
        "Casey: You're not. You know what, I'm starting to think I don't even like you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah? Well, you liked me enough to sleep with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, sorry. Wasn't expecting to see you up here.",
        "Casey: No, its fine, man. I just need a little time.",
        "Will: You want me to go?",
        "Casey: No, man, I'm glad you're here.",
        "Will: What's going on?",
        "Casey: I can talk to you, right? I mean, we're friends.",
        "Will: Yeah. Whatever you're going through, I'm there for you.",
        "Casey: The thing is, you can't tell anyone.",
        "Will: Sure, not a problem.",
        "Casey: Cause, I mean, I don't know what to do -- if anything. But, I don't know, I just need to talk to someone, you know what I mean?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Casey: All right, well -- man, if this got back to Celia, though, she'd never understand.",

        "Jack: Emma? Hey, where's your mom?",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Is your mom here?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, Keith is letting J.J. stay with us indefinitely.",
        "Carly: Isn't that great?",
        "Jack: Yeah. So, we wanted to know if Emma maybe could help us throw a little party.",
        "Holden: She's not here.",
        "Carly: Oh. Okay. Well, we were just thinking that because J.J. likes the farm so much --",
        "Jack: Yeah, and the horses. I mean, he's always talking about how you taught him how to ride a horse.",
        "Carly: And we're so glad that he can stay. We thought that Keith was gonna be heading back to Chicago --",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's staying. Believe me, I get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So you'll pick up Faith from ballet? Great. Thank you, Sally, you are truly a life saver. Oh! Oh, no, no. Just a big, old cat. Yeah, thank you. Okay, bye-bye. You almost got me in trouble.",
        "Keith: Well, I waited till the coast was clear.",
        "Lily: Just because you don't see any children here -- maybe the plumber could've come by, or the vet or the guy from the pharmacy.",
        "Keith: That kid? That 12-year-old kid? You trying to make me jealous?",
        "Lily: He's not 12, he's, like, 16, and he's my son's very good friend.",
        "Keith: Well, then he's in school. You see, I waited till the coast was clear. I missed you.",
        "Lily: You've been away from me for a couple of hours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I know all about Keith's decision to stay, and trust me, it's got nothing to do with what's best for J.J. But I'm happy for you, Jack. I'll tell my mom that you stopped by.",
        "Jack: What the hell was that?",
        "Carly: It has nothing to do with you, sweetheart. It has everything to do with Keith and Lily.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm wondering about that, with Keith staying here --",
        "Carly: It complicates things. I'm gonna go. Why don't you stick around? I'm gonna visit with Lily, and then I'll meet you at the Lakeview?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. Bye, Holden.",
        "Holden: Why are you still here?",
        "Jack: Thought I'd stick around, wait for Emma.",
        "Holden: Suit yourself. Coffee?",
        "Jack: Sure. Good muffins. Are you worried that Keith is spending too much time with your kids, given his friendship with Lily?",
        "Holden: His friendship? They're sleeping together.",
        "Jack: That was fast.",
        "Holden: Yeah, tell me about it. I went over there -- don't ask me why, but it was pretty obvious that I was interrupting something.",
        "Jack: Sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: She didn't care. She just looked at me like it didn't matter. Like we were past all that and that maybe the next time I should call first, or maybe just fall off the face of the earth and let her live her life.",
        "Jack: And Keith?",
        "Holden: Don't even get me started, Jack.",
        "Jack: Emma was right, then.",
        "Holden: Yeah, she was. She saw it coming. I just don't know what she sees in this guy. I mean, I'm not perfect, but never went to a loan shark for money.",
        "Jack: Holden, I know you don't want to hear this, but I have a feeling, and don't get angry, okay? I have a feeling, no matter who it was, you would've been upset about it because the truth is you still love your wife.",
        "Holden: Yeah. You're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I would just have imagined you'd have more discrimination or discretion not to hang out with this guy that you know almost nothing about.",
        "Keith: Ahh, here we go again.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. Actually, because of you and your team of private investigators, I know everything there is to know about Keith.",
        "Lucinda: All right, you know about the lying part, the gambling part, the in- debt-to-the-mob part?",
        "Keith: Ah, come on, you got anything new? We've already run that up the flagpole.",
        "Lucinda: You've got a lot of nerve, thrusting yourself on my daughter. Exposing my grandchildren to your sordid past.",
        "Keith: But that's not why you're here, is it? She thinks I'm a murderer.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Keith: We had a little chat yesterday. She thinks that I killed my sister. Forget the fact that I loved my sister.",
        "Lucinda: And you wanted her money.",
        "Keith: Yep, I wanted J.J.'s trust fund. All I had to do was turn my sister in. She had an outstanding warrant. I would've been given guardianship of him, you know? But, instead -- no, no, -- I went and I put my hands around my sister's neck and I choked her to death.",
        "Lily: Are we done here?",
        "Keith: Yeah, I'm done.",
        "Lily: Good-bye, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: You're asking me to leave?",
        "Lily: No. I'm telling you to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Gwen, what's going on?",
        "Gwen: Casey thinks I'm trash.",
        "Celia: No, he doesn't.",
        "Gwen: Celia, I live in a room at a body shop. Have you ever been to Burt's garage?",
        "Celia: I just moved here a couple months ago, so --",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it's a great place. You should visit it sometime. There's nothing like looking out your window at a sign that says, \"collisions our specialty.\"",
        "Celia: That doesn't mean anything.",
        "Gwen: Would you like to live there?",
        "Celia: It's not your fault.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but it's who I am. At least to Casey it is.",
        "Celia: That's not true. Besides, if Casey really cared about stuff like that, he'd never be dating me. My mother is a cook.",
        "Gwen: For Sierra Esteban, the former president of Montega. And hello? Now you live at the Walsh's.",
        "Celia: Well, it's not like I own the house. And, besides, once my brother starts making enough money, we're getting an apartment, which, trust me, will be small. Besides, Casey doesn't count up how much money people have. He's a really good person. You two just don't know each other very well.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm sure that's it.",
        "Celia: And now that you're hanging out with Will and me, it'll change.",
        "Gwen: I can't wait.",
        "Celia: Look, that stuff that Casey said about not hanging out with you so much? It wasn't about you. Casey just wants us to have some time alone. You know, so we can --",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I know.",
        "Lisa: Hello, ladies. Have you found something that you would like? Please forgive me. I've been so busy today. The shop has just been hopping. How are you doing, sweetheart?",
        "Celia: We're having the best time. I'd like you to meet my friend, Gwen. She's going to the prom with Will.",
        "Lisa: Oh, Will, Will Munson? Mr. Tall and Handsome? Hey, you two girls have really snagged the cutest boys in town.",
        "Celia: We think so.",
        "Lisa: Well, let me tell you -- they are the lucky ones. Just looking at you, my goodness, you're two of the prettiest young women to come into my shop in I don't know when. I just would like to put you in the window and display you as being the \"oomph\" people. So, what do you want? What can I interest you in?",
        "Celia: Isn't this perfect for Gwen. You know, with her coloring?",
        "Lisa: Yes, yes, yes. Oh, you'd just be smashing. And what about you, darling? What did you find?",
        "Celia: What do you think?",
        "Lisa: Oh, yeah. For you that's just perfect. Perfect.",
        "Gwen: Oh, my God, $500 for a dress?",
        "Lisa: Oh, yeah, well, I know it's expensive, but you see, this is a Marie St. Clair and all of these, you see, all this handwork.",
        "Celia: Mine's even more.",
        "Customer: Lisa, does this come in a six?",
        "Lisa: Yes? I think it does in the back -- would you ladies excuse me? Look, why don't you go -- oh, it's that rack over there. It's a sale rack. Go over there and look. I'll be right back.",
        "Gwen: I could never pay $500 for a dress.",
        "Celia: Like I even have $500.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You tricked me.",
        "Katie: No, I hired you.",
        "Henry: You can't hire me. I'm your husband.",
        "Katie: Exactly. And when a wife wants to talk to her husband and he refuses, she has the right to use any means possible, including hiring him to drive her around all day.",
        "Henry: Well, find yourself another chauffeur, honey, because I quit.",
        "Katie: You can't quit. We need the money.",
        "Henry: We?",
        "Katie: Yes, we.",
        "Alison: I'll be in the back if anyone --",
        "Katie: You can't just un-we us because you're mad at me.",
        "Henry: Mad at you? Katie -- this is ridiculous.",
        "Katie: No, this is normal. It's what couples go through. It's called a period of adjustment. And news flash -- I chose you, I married you, and we're happy. Henry, please, I missed you so much last night.",
        "Henry: Well, that's interesting, because I didn't miss you at all.",
        "Katie: Because of Ivy?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Katie: You're lying.",
        "Henry: Well, be that as it may, we're history, honey. What do I have to do, get a restraining order on you?",
        "Katie: You were not with Ivy last night. You were not with anyone last night. You love me. I can feel it.",
        "Katie: You love me --",
        "Henry: See, that's the projection, Kathryn. You love me, so you assume that I must love you, but I've been cured. I don't think about you. I don't dream about you. I don't long for -- for anything. I've got my life back. And I intend to keep it that way. So back off, baby, I'm a free man.",
        "Alison: He's gone?",
        "Katie: For now.",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry, Katie, I know how much you wanted this to work.",
        "Katie: Oh, it'll work. It's just going to take a little bit longer than I thought.",
        "Alison: But I thought that he said it was over.",
        "Katie: Alison, let me tell you a little something about men. Don't ever listen to them. Really. They don't know what they want. Have you ever seen a guy shopping for a shirt? \"Red, yellow, blue, hmm?\" They're clueless. Why? They don't know who they are. They don't know what they want. They don't know what they need. But they need us -- to figure out their lives for them. Henry wants me. He's just -- he's hurt because I panicked when Mike got married. Not that Mike knows what he wants either, but that's beside the point. I love Henry and Henry loves me, he's just too hurt to admit it.",
        "Alison: Right. Only from my experience, which is nothing compared to yours -- when men get their pride hurt, they tend to do what Henry did last night.",
        "Katie: You mean the bimbo at the bar last night? That just proves that he misses me.",
        "Alison: But if he's all wrapped up with her --?",
        "Katie: How am I going to get near him? Good point. If he sees me coming, he's going to run. So -- he can't see me. Which means -- I can't be me.",
        "Alison: Say what?",
        "Katie: Watch and learn, Alison. It's time to bring out the big guns.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Celia's just always going on about how great of a guy I am. The thing is, dude, I'm not perfect, you know? I do things too. Like, maybe, sometimes it seems okay at the time, but later, it just --",
        "Will: Like what?",
        "Casey: I don't -- you know when my parents split up?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Casey: That was a really rough time, man, and even after they got back together, you never knew if it was solid, like if I could actually lean on it.",
        "Will: I know how that feels.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I bet you do, man. I don't know, I was just feeling sort of lost, I guess. I mean, I was home alone. My mom, she was pulling the late shift. My dad, he was working late. They were avoiding each other, whatever, I get it, but I would be home alone at nights, and I'm not making excuses, man. I'm just saying sometimes I'd go out.",
        "Will: By yourself?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I don't know, I'd just go drive around, and if I ran into anyone, then we'd hook up. I don't know, hang out, go see a movie, whatever.",
        "Will: Okay, so what does that have to do with Celia?",
        "Casey: That's the thing, man. It has nothing to do with Celia. She didn't even live here then, you know? I didn't even know her. I mean, you know Celia. She goes to church, she's -- I don't know, she's just --",
        "Will: A really nice girl.",
        "Casey: Exactly, she's a really nice girl, and I don't want to hurt her.",
        "Will: Wait, why would you be hurting her?",
        "Casey: I wouldn't.",
        "Will: Well, then what are you talking about? Celia's the best thing that's ever happened to you -- she's amazing.",
        "Casey: I know, man.",
        "Will: All right, then what are you saying?",
        "Casey: Nothing. I'm not saying anything.",
        "Will: All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "Casey: No, dude. I'm sorry. I'm not even making sense.",
        "Will: All right, so what's this thing with Celia?",
        "Casey: Nothing, man. It's just -- I promised her I was going to take her to this concert, the next time Beyonce came around Chicago, and I totally forgot. I didn't get tickets. What?",
        "Will: It just seemed like a lot more than that.",
        "Casey: She really wanted to see her.",
        "Will: Okay --",
        "Casey: All right, I've gotta go, man. I need to make some calls.",
        "Will: Hey, Case? Celia really likes you, man. I'm sure everything's going to be fine.",
        "Casey: Or not. We'll deal. Hey, can you do me a favor? Pick her up at Fashions and take her to Metro? We're having the prom committee meeting.",
        "Will: Sure. Hey, don't worry about all this.",
        "Casey: I'm not. Who knows, if I go home right now and get online, maybe I'll be able to score a couple tickets, and she'll never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Mine didn't fit, thank God.",
        "Celia: Mine fits, but -- please tell me it's not me.",
        "Gwen: No, it's your grandmother, and that's the problem. These dresses are for, like, 40-year-old women.",
        "Celia: Well, we'll just keep looking. I know there has to be something here that works. Come on.",
        "Lia: My mother has an account here.",
        "Ann: My dad said I could spend whatever it takes.",
        "Lia: Look who's here.",
        "Ann: What is she doing here?",
        "Lia: It looks like she's picking through the sales rack for a prom dress? As if.",
        "Ann: You know, that is so unfair. You should have been nominated for prom queen instead of her. And what Casey Hughes is doing with her --",
        "Lia: I know exactly what he's doing with her.",
        "Ann: You think so?",
        "Lia: Please. Look what she's wearing.",
        "Ann: It's beyond hideous.",
        "Lia: No, you're wrong. It's perfect. Come on, let's go have some fun. Celia! This is so great. Are you shopping for the prom? Ann, tell me that dress does not look perfect on her.",
        "Celia: Well, actually I --",
        "Lia: You have to get it. It looks fabulous on you. Ann, doesn't it? When everybody sees you in that dress, they'll just never get over it.",
        "Ann: You know, she's is so right. It looks perfect, Celia. And look at this price. Such a steal. Take it.",
        "Celia: You're right about the price --",
        "Lia: Oh, you have to get it. You won't be sorry. Ann, we've got to dash. I promised Mommy that I'd meet her at the dermatologist. Besides, Celia got the best dress here. I'm just gonna have to come back another time. Bye, hun.",
        "Celia: Maybe it's not so bad.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, for dumpster diving.",
        "Celia: They liked it.",
        "Gwen: Honey, they were playing you so you'd buy it and show up at the prom looking like road kill.",
        "Celia: I know. It's ugly.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Celia: But it's okay. I know we'll find something.",
        "Gwen: You're not going to find anything like that one, though.",
        "Celia: No. It's okay. It's not the first time I couldn't afford something I wanted. But that doesn't mean I can't try it on.",
        "Gwen: No, don't.",
        "Celia: Oh, come on, that's the whole fun of shopping. You should try yours on, too.",
        "Gwen: Never.",
        "Celia: Come on, please?",
        "Gwen: Look, there're plenty of things in this life I can't have. I'm not gonna add a $500 dress to the list.",

        "Lucinda: Until you get the divorce, you are a married woman. You've got three children. You can't get involved. It's too soon. And particularly not with this fly-by-night who's got more problems than even you can handle. Darling, you're too vulnerable. He can make you happy",
        "Lily: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Lucinda: But in the long run, it won't work. Okay.",
        "Lily: You done? Good. Good-bye.",
        "Lucinda: Good-bye, dear.",
        "Lily: I am so sorry about that.",
        "Keith: It's not your fault.",
        "Lily: It's my mother. Anybody will tell you that knows her -- she will zero in on your biggest fear, make it blow up in your face, and embarrass you in the worst way possible.",
        "Keith: Well, it was because of this conversation we had yesterday where I told you that I was going to stay in town, and make you a permanent part of my life.",
        "Lily: That's what set her off. I'm glad you did that.",
        "Keith: Now, I think it's a bad idea. I think I should go back to Chicago.",

        "Katie: Do I know my husband, or do I know my husband? Okay, do what you have to do.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Back to Chicago? You can't.",
        "Keith: Listen, Lily, getting to know you and spending the night with you last night, it opened up these feelings that I thought were dead and gone. So I'm always gonna be grateful --",
        "Lily: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on. Don't say that, please. And don't let my mother poison this. Come on, you're a wonderful man.",
        "Keith: Your mother, I know. She can insult me upside down. It's just that she does have this point.",
        "Lily: Holden and I are getting divorced. And I don't care what my mother thinks or her friends.",
        "Keith: Yeah, but you do care about your children. So you see, getting mixed up with me before you straighten things out --",
        "Lily: I'm not saying that this would be easy. But, if you can't handle my mom or my kids, then I understand. I will just hate you for the rest of my life for making me feel so wonderful and then taking it all away.",
        "Keith: I would never take anything away from you.",
        "Lily: We can work it out. If you still want me.",

        "Keith: On the floor.",
        "Lily: I love the floor.",
        "Keith: You do?",
        "Lily: What's wrong with the floor?",
        "Keith: I got a better idea. We go to the cabin down there --",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Keith: And we take the phone off the hook, and we just disappear. And you hang out with me for -- some time. If you can handle that.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Lily: I think I can handle that.",
        "Keith: All right, all right. Tell you what then. Let me just keep you up to speed here. Here's what I want to do. I want to cash that check that you gave me. I'm gonna straighten out all those debts, so that when I see you it's a clean slate.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Keith: Okay? Okay. Then I'll see you at the cabin in a little while then, okay?",

        "Lily: You gathered? Or you knew?",
        "Carly: I guessed. I saw Holden. He didn't say anything, but he looked miserable.",
        "Lily: I -- I guess he didn't realize that Keith and I were moving so fast. But I guess he had to find out sooner or later, right?",

        "Holden: I loved her when I left her. That will never change.",
        "Jack: I don't know what that means. But then again, you and I have always looked at things a little differently.",
        "Holden: That's not true. It's a decision you have to make. It's about the plusses, it's about the minuses.",
        "Jack: No, not for me. See, if I added things up at the end of the day, I'd be walking out the door more often than not. But for me, it's Carly. She's the one, for good or for bad. Just keep fighting through it.",
        "Holden: We tried that.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not saying that you didn't. And I'm not advocating --",
        "Holden: Yes you --",
        "Jack: No, no, I'm not. I'm really not. I think you just need to sit back and maybe think things through. Given what you now realize, you know, what it all means. Can you live with Lily moving on?",
        "Holden: More to the point, do I have the right to stop her.",
        "Jack: You have the right to tell her how you feel, that you love her.",
        "Holden: She knows how I feel. But you're right, I do need to think long and hard about the situation, because like it or not, Lily has moved on, and I need to learn how to deal with it.",

        "Celia: Thank you, Ms. Grimaldi. That's so sweet of you. But I still couldn't afford it. I just tried it on for fun.",
        "Lisa: I know. I know what you mean, because when I was, well, a kid, I remember trying on things for fun. And I guess that's why when I grew up, I had to buy my own dress shop. Oh, yes, that's -- that's just precious. That's beautiful.",

        "Katie: No, but she could have. And what I'm doing with the number is what's important. Fixing Henry's life -- that's worth it.",

        "Katie: And I love him. I do. Okay, it's not the same as it was with Mike, but Henry's a different person, so it makes sense that my feelings for him would be different. Henry's funny. That's just him. Mike's not. He's intense and very tender. Not that Henry's not tender, it's just that Mike --",
        "Alison: -- Is married.",
        "Katie: Is that what you think this is? That I only want Henry because I can't have Mike, or that I'm just too afraid to be alone? Alison, that's not it. Henry and I are best friends. We love the same movies, the same ice cream, the same -- let's just say there's no problem in the bedroom. We just have fun together, make each other happy. And if anything ever happened to him, I -- I don't know what I would do. I mean, when I thought he had a heart attack --",

        "Jack: Two separate subjects.",
        "Holden: Well, it is, and it isn't. If I try to run him out of town, he might retaliate, and you're my cousin.",
        "Jack: He's not taking J.J. away from me.",
        "Holden: That's because I'm not gonna let him.",
        "Jack: I appreciate that, but I don't want you to shortchange yourself when it comes to your wife.",
        "Holden: I'm not gonna do that. Besides, she's not my wife, not anymore. And I can't stand the fact that she's with some dead-beat, but it's her decision, and it's really none of my business.",
        "Jack: All right, listen, but you got to leave the channels open, okay? You have every right to spend time with those kids. Don't forget that.",

        "Carly: About his past you mean?",
        "Lily: About anything. Thanks to my mother, Keith and I have had to work out some things that he kept to himself, understandably. I mean, why? Why should he have to expose every little piece of himself when he doesn't really know what he wants yet? I mean, most people get to date for a little while, they get to know each other, and then these things come out slowly. But thank you, to my mother, with her team of private investigators.",
        "Carly: No, she didn't --",
        "Lily: Oh, she did. But strangely enough, it actually brought us closer.",
        "Carly: So when you say no doubts --",
        "Lily: Doubts, that, well -- its Julia's brother. Holden slept with Julia, and now I'm with her brother.",
        "Carly: Yes, there is that. There's also the case. I don't want to point any fingers. Keith has been kind and generous. He told us yesterday that J.J. could stay with us.",
        "Lily: Well, that's wonderful news. That must make Jack very happy. But?",
        "Carly: It's just so tragic, isn't it? It's hard to shake. I just hope that you're happy and that -- and that --",
        "Lily: Oh, please. My mom was just here with these crazy ideas that Keith was the one that murdered his own sister. Come on, it's nonsense. I mean, you know, if he wanted to get rid of Julia, he could have just called the El Paso police and taken her away. There's Les, all this evidence against him, running into a burning van. I mean, if that's not an admission of guilt. The guy basically committed suicide.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you're right.",

        "Alison: I'm not. I'm just, you know -- if Ivy wants to know why, because that's the way women are. They want to know answers to everything. They want to know how and why and why not. I need to know what to tell her if she just breaks down crying in the middle of Metro.",

You were happy, too. And I know it's not fair that you were cut down in your prime. I'm really sorry about that -- really, really sorry. But your life is over.
