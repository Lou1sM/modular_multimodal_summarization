        "Margo: What? Why don't you just tell me what your mom said?",
        "Tom: Because all she said was that it had something to do with Casey.",
        "Margo: And it's so awful, she can't tell us on the phone. She's got to come here to tell us in person?",
        "Tom: Margo --",
        "Margo: I've got a bad feeling, Tom. It's starting all over again, isn't it?",
        "Tom: Why don't we just wait and see what he has to say?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Tom: Hey, Mom.",
        "Lisa: I hope this is not a bad time.",
        "Margo: Lisa, please, just tell us!",
        "Lisa: Honey, I don't know if I'm really doing the right thing or not, but --",
        "Margo: What did Casey do?",
        "Lisa: He stole from me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Its okay, Casey. Everything's going to be all right. Casey, Casey -- stop, stop. I meant what I said. It's not going to happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: It wasn't very much money.",
        "Margo: You know, he just got out of jail for stealing and he's doing it again.",
        "Tom: But you weren't sure that it was Casey when this actually happened?",
        "Lisa: Oh, no, I didn't find out until tonight, and I didn't suspect him. He wasn't working when it happened.",
        "Margo: Of course, you didn't suspect him. You-- who would conceive that he would do something so stupid again! He didn't want you to tell us, did he?",
        "Lisa: Uh, Darling, he was very apologetic.",
        "Margo: Oh, yes, he's good at that. He's very convincing.",
        "Lisa: He paid me back.",
        "Margo: He did? Where did he get the money from? Did he get the money from you?",
        "Tom: No.",
        "Margo: Where is he? Maybe he didn't get it from anybody. Maybe he, he -- Lisa; Margo, now stop. He got the money from Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Emily: That's right.",
        "Casey: It's just being with you is the only thing that makes me feel better.",
        "Emily: No, it doesn't make you feel better, it just makes you forget. Casey, you have to go. Really, really.",
        "Casey: No. Not yet.",

        "Natalie: Mom!",
        "Faith: Mom --",
        "Lily: Shhh. Shhh.",
        "Faith: Sorry, but the TV and all the lights went out just now.",
        "Lily: I know, I know.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "Lily: Well, what happened was we gave an outrageous amount of money to the electrical contractor, and he fixed it so the lights don't work.",
        "Faith: So we have to go back to the farm?",
        "Lily: No, we have to find a circuit breaker box.",
        "Faith: You can't fix this on your own.",
        "Lily: Want to bet?",

        "Carly: Hey, where's Parker?",
        "Sage: Upstairs, being weird.",
        "Carly: Weirder than usual?",
        "Sage: He keeps changing his shirts, like a million times.",
        "Carly: Sounds like a desperate cry for help, doesn't it? Hey, Parker! It's just the three of us. I thought we'd go out for supper. Would you like Mexican or Al's?",
        "Sage: Al's!",
        "Parker: I can't go. I have plans.",
        "Carly: You have -- you have plans? What kind of plans?",
        "Parker: I'm going to the movies.",
        "Carly: What movie and with whom?",
        "Parker: We haven't decided yet.",
        "Carly: And who's the other half of we? Charlie? Alex?",
        "Sage: Yeah, like he'd change his shirt for Charlie. Mom, he's going out with a girl. Obviously.",

        "Holden: Hello?",
        "Lily: Hey, it's me.",
        "Holden: Hey, what's up?",
        "Lily: Well, the girls are really enjoying this. All the lights are out in the house, and I told them -- actually, I bet them that I could fix it. I lost that bet.",
        "Holden: Did you try the circuit breaker?",
        "Lily: Yeah, they're all lying that flat way, but the house is still out. I don't know what to do.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll be right over.",
        "Lily: Holden, I wouldn't have called, but no electricity means no security system, either.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'll be right over.",
        "Lily: I really appreciate this.",
        "Holden: It's not a problem. I'll just get the backup generator going, then see if I can figure out what happened.",
        "[Holden arrives at Lily's]",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Holden: Where are the kids?",
        "Lily: Sleeping, girls are out back catching fire flies.",
        "Holden: Place looks nice. You did a great job.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Decorator was great. I'm not sure about the electrician.",
        "Holden: Don't worry. I can fix anything.",
        "Lily: I really hope that's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: A girl, huh?",
        "Parker: You know, people don't like people with really big mouths.",
        "Carly: Come on, now, you know me. You weren't getting out of here without telling me where you were going and who you were going with anyway. So who is it, is it Liberty?",
        "Sage: Parker and Liberty, sitting in a tree.",
        "Parker: It's not Liberty. You're going to pay, I mean it --",
        "Carly: Don't threaten your sister, it's her job to annoy you. So, if it's not Liberty, who is it?",
        "Parker: Just this girl from school. Ashley Davis.",
        "Sage: No way!",
        "Carly: You know her?",
        "Sage: She's like so out of his league.",
        "Carly: Hey. Now you're starting to annoy me. No one is out of your brother's league, do you understand me? So what's this girl's number?",
        "Parker: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Oh, gee, well, all right, too bad for you then.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Carly: Because you are not leaving this house until I have a conversation with her mother to make sure it's okay with her.",
        "Parker: You can't do that!",
        "Carly: Look, either I talk to the mother or you can talk to Ashley and cancel the date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You really can fix anything.",
        "Holden: No, not really. I got the generator going, but I don't know what happened to the circuit breaker.",
        "Lily: I'll make sure to get the electrician here tomorrow.",
        "Faith: Couldn't Dad come back and fix it?",
        "Holden: No, no. We need somebody who really knows what they're doing.",
        "Lily: You sure seem like you do. You are a really handy man to have around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker, this is non-negotiable. I talk to the mother or you don't go.",
        "Parker: Mom, we're just going to the movies.",
        "Carly: Sorry, Pal, given everything we've been through the last few weeks -- believe me, my own behavior as a teenager -- I just can't take a chance that you're not telling me the truth.",
        "Parker: I am.",
        "Carly: Parker, just give me her number. I'll talk to her mother. I promise you, I won't embarrass you.",
        "Parker: Fine. What?",
        "Carly: It's just hitting me. You're grown up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm not ready to go home. It's going to be just like, when they found out I stole those bonds from Crash. And my mom's mad money.",
        "Emily: Maybe your parents don't know what happened.",
        "Casey: No. My grandma's going to tell them. I mean, she kind of has to, doesn't she?",
        "Emily: Or --",
        "Casey: Or what?",
        "Emily: You tell them yourself.",
        "Casey: I know you're not going to believe this, but I --",
        "Emily: Try me.",
        "Casey: It's not that I'm afraid of getting in trouble. I just don't think I could handle hurting them that much all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I just don't understand why Casey would do something like this.",
        "Lisa: He had just gotten out of --",
        "Tom: Out of his mind! Did he forget why he was in prison in the first place? And what about this money? Did he say why he needed this?",
        "Lisa: I didn't ask.",
        "Margo: Well, I hope it's for a good reason --",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Margo: Does it ever occur to you that he just steals just for the thrill of stealing?",
        "Tom: If that's the case, we'll figure it out, we'll get help.",
        "Margo: No, you know what scares me even more?",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Margo: He went with Emily so he could get away with it. Not only does he steal and lie and cover everything up, he finds the perfect accomplice, someone who's been breaking the rules her whole life just because she can get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know. The time to worry about hurting my parents was before I stole the money.",
        "Emily: Casey, tell them. It will be so much better than when they hear it from Lisa. At least they'll see you're trying to be up front with them.",
        "Casey: Because I have to. Because I might be found out.",
        "Emily: Well, that's one way to look at.",
        "Emily: Casey, Casey, do this. Talk to them. Do it before the guilt ends up eating you alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, Sweetie. We'll call for some take-out. I'm not sure we can trust the stove tonight.",
        "Holden: What do you guys think about going to Al's Diner?",
        "Natalie: Mom, can we please?",
        "Lily: Sure, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah!",
        "Lily: Shhh, your brother.",
        "Natalie: I know, I know.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: I should have cleared it with you first before I asked the girls to go.",
        "Lily: Holden, its okay. It's fine.",
        "Holden: Want to come along?",
        "Lily: Ethan and I have a lot of unpacking to do.",
        "Holden: Okay, how about we bring you something back?",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Faith: I call front seat!",
        "Holden: On the way there. Nat gets it on the way back.",
        "Faith: Can we listen to something other than classic rock? Maybe something that's not a million years old?",
        "Lily: Old man.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hi. Holden, we crossed paths. He's not taking the girls to the farm --",
        "Lily: No, they're just going to dinner. You got my message. We're ba-ack.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, I just have one question. Who the hell do you think you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I really don't think Emily's the issue here.",
        "Margo: Oh, you're not going to defend her to me?",
        "Tom: I'm not defending her, I'm saying that Emily doesn't matter. That Casey matters, and I'm sorry you have to go through this again. I know it's been a tough year.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know this hasn't been a walk in the park for you, either.",
        "Tom: Well, we're still going to have to do it again. We have to put our heads together and figure out what is best for our son.",
        "Lisa: Um, Margo, Darling...",
        "Casey: You know.",
        "Lisa: I'm really sorry, Casey --",
        "Casey: No, no, you had to. You had every reason to believe I wouldn't tell them myself.",
        "Margo: Lisa, could you --",
        "Lisa: I'm -- no, no, I'm going. Uh, I just want to say that I love everyone in this room, and I know that this family can certainly get through this.",
        "Casey: I am so --",
        "Tom: I know that you're not about to say that I am sorry.",
        "Casey: I get that.",
        "Tom: I think that's about the only thing you get. What were you thinking, or do you even think? My son was in prison, and when he gets out, he goes and does the exact same thing.",
        "Casey: Okay, this isn't an excuse --",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, it better not be.",
        "Casey: But the money wasn't for me.",
        "Tom: I don't care about the money! If you needed money, why didn't you come to your mom or me? What is it inside you that makes it okay to steal from your grandmother?",
        "Casey: I don't know, I just -- Mom, Mom, please don't cry. I know --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Okay, you can go now.",
        "Carly: Aw, you don't want us to hang around and meet Ashley. Parker, that's too bad, because I brought along some little baby pictures when you were so naked cute. I wanted to show her.",
        "Parker: I'm so lucky to have such a funny mom.",
        "Carly: All right, we'll go. You call me if you need a ride or anything, okay?",
        "Sage: Parker --",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Sage: You look really nice. You picked the right shirt.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Carly: I think I'm going to faint dead away. Did you just say something nice to your brother? Come on, Honey. Now you have fun on your date.",
        "Parker: It's not a date. What was that for?!",
        "Liberty: That was for ratting me out to my parents, jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Do we really need to do this?",
        "Lucinda: No, we don't. Come on. Go back to your husband and this discussion is over.",
        "Lily: And how do you really feel about how I live my life?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I think I know I'm seeing you throw away everything that you ever wanted, and I just don't see why.",
        "Lily: Why is this so hard for you to understand? Things weren't working with me and Holden, not the way that I want them to.",
        "Lucinda: This is Holden we're talking about. Whatever his faults, he stood by you, Honey, the worst year of your life, and your response to that is to walk out and take the kids?",
        "Lily: I'm doing what I think is best for my children. Don't you dare imply I don't think about my children.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, stop that, Darling. Can you for one second make me believe this is what they want?",
        "Lily: Nobody wants this! But you think they can't sense the strain of us tiptoeing around each other in the same house day after day, the constant tension?",
        "Lucinda: It's called family life.",
        "Lily: No, Mother, there was something wrong, and I will not pretend that there wasn't - isn't. And living here, without Holden, this - this may be our only shot at getting back together again, in a real way.",
        "Lucinda: I can say one thing about you, Baby, when you are wrong, you are really, really wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, we meet again.",
        "Carly: Hello. Um... Oh, Natalie, your shoes are so cute, aren't they, Sage?",
        "Sage: I love them. Can Faith and Natalie and I get our own table?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, please, Dad?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Faith: Come on, you want to hear us talk about the Jonas Brothers all throughout dinner, did you?",
        "Holden: Fine, grab a table. Have a ball.",
        "Carly: Not to worry. I know that after yesterday afternoon, you definitely do not want to be in my company. I will eat with the girls.",
        "Holden: No, don't.",
        "Carly: But they're going to talk about the Jonas Brothers!",
        "Holden: Don't make me eat alone. Save me the embarrassment.",
        "Carly: You're sure?",
        "Holden: Sure. Who are the Jonas Brothers?",
        "Carly: Beats the heck out of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I didn't rat you out to anybody, okay? I'm not like that.",
        "Liberty: No? How about when I ran you off your skateboard, when I cut school, when I --",
        "Parker: Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired of getting in trouble because of your stupid ideas.",
        "Liberty: So how were you going to get in trouble because I was making out with Dylan?",
        "Parker: I didn't tell anyone about that.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, Parker, you did.",
        "Parker: Liberty, you were in the middle of Old Town. Only about 200 or 300 people could see what you were doing.",
        "Liberty: You, you are so lame. Who could see what you were doing, you can't even say \"Making out,\" let alone -- that's it, isn't it?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Liberty: You have never kissed a girl before, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: So, you have to ride horses?",
        "Faith: Yeah, it's the best thing about the whole camp. You go out twice a day --",
        "Sage: You have to? Like, they make you?",
        "Faith: You don't want to? Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Something wrong?",
        "Carly: Just that look on Sage's face. They must be talking about horseback riding.",
        "Holden: Ah! One of the reasons Faith can't wait to get to camp. Sage not so much?",
        "Carly: Well, believe it or not, there is a Snyder who is afraid of horses.",
        "Holden: No way.",
        "Carly: Way. I used to think her biggest problem was she wasn't afraid of anything.",
        "Holden: Well, you know, I happen to be a pretty good teacher, so if you want to bring her out, hang out with me, I can teach her how to feed a horse, how to use a curry comb. By the time she's ready to take a ride, piece of cake.",
        "Carly: You'd be willing to do that?",
        "Holden: That's what family's for, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know, I'm not like you. I don't think of kissing as a spectator sport, or any of your business.",
        "Liberty: So, you haven't. Hmm?",
        "Parker: Okay, would you just be quiet?",
        "Ashley: Hey, Parker.",
        "Parker: I got to go.",
        "Liberty: Oh, is that your girlfriend or something? Because I've never seen her around here. She's a real [squeals].",
        "Parker: Maybe if you went to school once in a while, you would have. Okay? Bye. Hey.",
        "Ashley: Hi. I'm really psyched about this movie. My friend said it had a lot of deep meaning.",
        "Parker: Wow, I can't wait then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I needed the money to pay back the guard who arranged for me and Matt to get that early release. If I had come to you, let you in on it, I would have put your jobs at risk.",
        "Margo: Yeah, like now? What are we supposed to do with that information now, Casey? Ignore it? Turn my back on an oath of office because my son had a pretty good reason for stealing? Knowing what we know now --",
        "Casey: No, no.",
        "Margo: Knowing that you lied, that you violated the terms of your parole just to cover it up until your grandmother, your own grandmother, the victim, made that no longer possible?",
        "Casey: I came here to tell you --",
        "Margo: Do you know that if you were any other person in the world, you would be in booking right now --",
        "Casey: Then do what you have to do! If that's where I should be, arrest me!",
        "Margo: I can't take this again.",
        "Casey: I -- I know I'm not supposed to say I'm sorry, but that's all I can think of saying right now.",
        "Tom: How about this. How about you say you're going to change? How about you say you're going to start to grow up?",
        "Casey: I think what I say isn't going to mean much for a really long time. Only what I do.",
        "Tom: I think you've got that right.",
        "Margo: I'm not going to arrest you.",
        "Casey: Mom, I, I --",
        "Margo: Here's the deal. You are going to go back to college and you're going to go back to college full time. If you mess up one more time, I arrest you.",
        "Casey: You can't do that.",
        "Margo: Yes, I can. Don't you dare tell me what I can and cannot do.",
        "Casey: Didn't you just say you wanted me to grow up? How am I going to grow up by going back to college, by a threat?",
        "Tom: Oh, I think we can postpone the discussion about your personal path to maturity given the situation.",
        "Casey: If you just make me do what you think is right, what's the difference between that and prison?",
        "Tom: I'm not about to debate this with you, Casey. Your mother has given you a choice. And it's the last one you're going to get for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you think that this latest rule of yours gets you and Holden that one last shot?",
        "Lily: Maybe our only one.",
        "Lucinda: How much patience do you think the guy's got before he just accepts the fact that he no longer has a wife?",
        "Lily: How unusual, you have all the answers. It wasn't working when we lived together. Holden needed me to back off --",
        "Lucinda: All the way across town?",
        "Lily: I don't care if you don't understand. Okay? I'm not just doing this for me, I'm doing it for Holden.",
        "Lucinda: Ooh, but does Holden know it? Does he know it? Because it looks to other people as if you're throwing in the towel, Darling, and we don't want him to think that.",
        "Lily: Don't go messing in this. Do not go interfere.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm supposed to just stand around looking pretty and twiddling my thumbs.",
        "Lily: Mother, if I can live without Holden, I sure as hell can live without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: I just think the kids at camp are going to laugh at me because I'm scared.",
        "Holden: Well, the thing about horses, it makes sense to be afraid of them, especially if you don't know what you're doing.",
        "Sage: They're so big.",
        "Holden: But the great thing about horses, once you get to know them, once you learn how to treat them, there aren't any surprises, and once they sense that you know what you're doing -- you're probably going to laugh at this --",
        "Sage: I won't.",
        "Holden: You can be friends with them. So why don't you come on out to the stables, I'll help you get comfortable. You and I, we can ride Coltrane. By the time you get to camp, you'll know what you're doing.",
        "Sage: I'd like that. Thanks.",
        "Holden: How about tomorrow?",
        "Carly: It's okay with me if it's okay with you.",
        "Sage: Mom, can Faith and Natalie come over to our house and hang out for a while? They want to hear my new CD.",
        "Carly: Fine by me. How about you, horse whisperer?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Sage: I'll go tell them.",
        "Carly: Coltrane?",
        "Holden: Yeah, very smooth, very cool. Like me.",
        "Carly: [Laughs]",

        "Parker: The cartoons are over. You can leave now.",
        "Liberty: Made you look, sucka!",
        "Parker: Wow, so mature. Get a life.",
        "Ashley: Who is that?",
        "Parker: A royal pain in the butt. Pretend she's not here.",
        "Ashley: She doesn't make it easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: The thing is, I think I've found something that I am really good at and I don't need school.",
        "Margo: You're going back to school full time because you need structure and you need discipline.",
        "Casey: I have that at work!",
        "Margo: Your boss gave you the money, Casey, Lisa told us. She gave you the money to cover up your crime, and that in and of itself is a crime.",
        "Casey: So this is about Emily.",
        "Margo: No! This is about you, Casey! This is all about you because I am scared for you, because you are going down a very dangerous road, and no one, no one is more dangerous to be with than Emily Stewart.",
        "Casey: Maybe you're right. Maybe this is the last decision I get to make for a very long time, but I'm going to make it myself. I'm not going to be blackmailed to live my life the way you want me to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You look awful.",
        "Casey: It was awful. They knew when I got there. I couldn't even make them believe I was planning to tell them the truth. They didn't believe anything I was saying.",
        "Emily: Okay, whoa, whoa, tonight, but that could change.",
        "Casey: Emily, they gave me one choice -- no negotiations. I quit and go back to school full time or I go back to jail.",
        "Emily: Well, I understand. I understand. I'm going to miss working with you, but I get it.",
        "Casey: No, I won't do it.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Casey: My mom, she just wants me away from you. But I'm not going to let her. Both of them, blackmail me like this. I'm not quitting and I'm not going back to school.",
        "Emily: Casey, have you lost your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here you go.",
        "Holden: Thanks.",
        "Carly: So, I want to say how lovely I think it is that you're going to help my daughter learn to ride.",
        "Holden: Not a big deal.",
        "Carly: I think it is, considering that you're still ticked off at me, and I appreciate you not letting that get in the way of helping my kids.",
        "Holden: How about we forget about what happened yesterday?",
        "Carly: I love that idea so much.",
        "Holden: Right after I apologize. I came down on you pretty hard. What I said about you and Jack, I shouldn't have made that crack.",
        "Carly: Well, come on, I left myself wide open. My giving out domestic advice is like your cousin Brad preaching moderation.",
        "Holden: Always got the one-liner, don't you?",
        "Carly: My stock in trade.",
        "Holden: Wouldn't be your defense mechanism, would it?",
        "Carly: And here I thought I was so complex and you figured me out just like that.",
        "Holden: I don't think anyone's ever really figured you out, ever.",
        "Carly: You're probably right. That includes me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What is wrong with you? Why are you doing this?",
        "Casey: I'm trying to do what's right.",
        "Emily: And so are your parents. And in case you haven't noticed, they're the ones calling the shots, Casey. They get to.",
        "Casey: Why, like I'm their property?",
        "Emily: They don't treat you like that, and you know it. They bend over backwards to be fair.",
        "Casey: Not to you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and your mother's so way out of line because I know I've never done anything to her, right? Would you stop? Your parents are throwing you a lifeline, Casey. Take it.",
        "Casey: Even if that means the end of us?",
        "Emily: Casey, we had sex, not a relationship. There is no us to end.",
        "Casey: You keep saying that.",
        "Emily: And now I'm acting on it. Okay? I'm walking out of here, and out of your life --",
        "Casey: No, no, no, no.",
        "Emily: Just live it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: If I don't follow through on this, he'll think I'm a pushover again and we'll lose what little respect he might have left for us.",
        "Tom: Well, I don't think this is going to make it any easier, then, but I've got to tell you, I think he was telling the truth.",
        "Margo: Tom, how'd it ever get this far? How am I gonna do this, huh? How am I going to walk into the station and give orders to people when everybody's looking at me thinking that my son -- my son's --",
        "Tom: Hey, we're going to get through this.",
        "Margo: How?",
        "Tom: We have to. We have no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: So, you really liked the movie?",
        "Ashley: I told you I did.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I liked it, too.",
        "Ashley: You said that. Okay, my mom's here. I've got to go.",
        "Parker: Right. Ashley, um, I had a really great time, so maybe if you want to do this again some time.",
        "Ashley: Sure, maybe.",
        "Liberty: Smooth move, Dude. Surprised you didn't reach out and shake her hand.",
        "Parker: Go away.",
        "Liberty: She should have at least kissed you. After all, you did pay for her ticket. Ooh, you didn't pay for her ticket, did you?",
        "Parker: I thought she'd want to pay for herself.",
        "Liberty: Oh, you are clueless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'll sign up for a full load of summer session.",
        "Margo: Good.",
        "Casey: I -- I know you're just watching out for me. It's something I don't do very well for myself.",
        "Tom: So maybe when we're talking, you won't storm off without a word.",
        "Casey: Right. I just needed some time.",
        "Margo: So what made you change your mind?",
        "Casey: Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Now she distances herself from her mother.",
        "Lily: Not unless you interfere with my life. Mother, you don't know. You have no idea how bad it's gotten. When I reach out to Holden, he pushes me away. It makes me feel horrible.",
        "Lucinda: Of course it does, Honey.",
        "Lily: I just -- I'm trying so hard to get back what we had.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Lily: And I'm really afraid. I'm really afraid it may be too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, it's true, isn't it? You have a kid who hasn't said a word in like a week, and then you get him in the car where you can't look at each other, and then he starts telling you things you're not sure you want to hear.",
        "Holden: You're right. I hadn't really thought about it. Hey, you're shivering.",
        "Carly: No, I'm fine.",
        "Holden: Here you go.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you. Thanks.",
        "Holden: You know what I hate?",
        "Carly: What's that?",
        "Holden: Driving in the car alone. I kind of like listening to all the chatter in the back seat.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Oh, good Lord, was there ever a Snyder man born who actually said two sentences in a row?",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Carly: Holden, you are going through hell, I know it. Now, I swear to you that I'm not going to interfere. I won't even offer my opinion, but talk to me. Talk to somebody.",
        "Holden: I just didn't see it coming. Because I really just didn't know how bad it really was.",
        "Carly: Maybe -- sorry, I'm just going to listen.",
        "Holden: Yeah, right. Tight-lipped Carly.",
        "Carly: I was just going to say maybe things had to get this bad before they could start to get better.",
        "Holden: The thing is, I just don't, just don't connect with Lily anymore. I don't see how her moving out is going to really change anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Okay, I forgive you.",
        "Parker: For what?",
        "Liberty: For telling my parents I was making out with Dylan.",
        "Parker: I didn't tell them. They figured it out. Believe it or not, you're not that hard to figure out, Liberty, so go and do whatever weird thing you want to do next and leave me alone.",
        "Liberty: Hey, I can't. You need me.",
        "Parker: No, I don't. Go away.",
        "Liberty: Okay, fine, but just so you know, your next date with Ashley, uh, if there is one, will end exactly how this one did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You want another beer?",
        "Holden: No, I'm okay. I should probably get the kids home.",
        "Carly: Hey, if you want to get out of teaching Sage to ride --",
        "Holden: Why would I want to get out of it? I like doing it. I'm not that busy this week.",
        "Carly: I'm glad we ran into you. And I'm really glad that we talked about yesterday.",
        "Holden: We said we were going to forget about it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, right.",
        "Holden: Faith, Nat? Time to go! Thanks for listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do we have to do this again?",
        "Margo: I think you're going to like this. Thank you. Apparently, you're the only one who can get through to Casey.",
        "Emily: No, I actually think that you got through to him. I just gave him that last little shove.",
        "Margo: Okay, well, thank you for that. Now we have Danny to think about, so from now on, I'm going to try to back off a bit.",
        "Emily: I know things can get pretty intense when it comes to your kids.",
        "Margo: Yeah. I'm pretty scared about Casey. I mean, I don't know if he's --",
        "Emily: Margo, Margo, Casey's going to be okay, honestly. What happened, it's over. Casey's not the kid he was, okay?",
        "Margo: I hope you're right.",
        "Emily: Can I say something? Can I ask you something, as a mother? Were you really going to send him to jail?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Emily: Okay, I need to say something. He knew you meant it, but I don't think Casey's going to school to avoid going to jail. He's doing it because he loves his parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Do you need to see someone?",
        "Casey: Like a shrink or --",
        "Tom: I don't know, a counselor, anybody?",
        "Casey: Dad, I will never do that again. I swear to you.",
        "Tom: Well, listen, before your mom gets back, there's something that I want to say. Now, she has been pushed for a very long time, not just by you --",
        "Casey: Yeah, Adam, I --",
        "Tom: You're my son, and I love you, and I will always love you, but I will not let you sacrifice who your mother is as a person to protect you one more time.",
        "Casey: I get it.",
        "Tom: I hope you do. Because if something like this happens again, you're out of here.",

        "Lily: Hey, Guys!",
        "Faith: Sage had this new CD so I'm gonna go download it right now.",
        "Lily: Okay, then to bed. You too, Monkey.",
        "Faith: Thanks, Daddy. Night!",
        "Holden: Night, Sweetie.",
        "Lily: Looks like you all had a great time. You went over to Carly's?",
        "Holden: We ran into her and Sage at the diner. A little cold.",
        "Lily: I'll nuke it. I can't unpack anything else. I was just going to make some coffee. Want to join me?",
        "Holden: I really should get going. I have an early day tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Yeah, life on the farm. Some other time?",
