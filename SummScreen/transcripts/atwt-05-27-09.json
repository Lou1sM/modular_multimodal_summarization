        "Craig makes sure that Carly goes to her AA meeting, as Carly is annoyed. Craig walks Carly to her meeting, but she ducks out early and tells one of the people involved that this isn't for her, as the man sees himself in her, but Carly blows it off. Parker steals from Craig's wallet. Craig and Parker have another tiff because Parker is into self-pity again. Craig then calls him on his wallet being gone, but Parker denies it, as he stomps out. Parker then comes across Carly secretly pouring vodka into her coffee and lets her know he saw. When Craig finds his wallet hidden, he calls Parker on it, but Parker manipulates Carly into lying for him. Craig is no fool and calls Carly on covering for Parker, who denies it and tells Craig she wants some space. Janet gets an offer for a free four day trip to Florida and is excited to tell Jack, who doesn't think it is feasible with all that is going on. However, when he sees her face, he changes his mind. Craig bumps into them and asks to speak with Jack. Craig tells Jack what happened with Carly and Parker and they both admit that Parker stealing is bad, but it is more worrisome that Carly lied for him. Meanwhile, Carly is having it out with Parker about what he did, as Parker feels justified, but Carly is incited that he would pull that. Jack arrives to confront them and orders Parker to show the contents of his wallet. An angry Parker does and Jack tells him that he knows what he did. He then tells Carly that she had her chance and since she won't tell him the truth, Parker is coming with him. Jack shows up with a furious Parker telling Janet that she has a new busboy until he pays back what he spent. Janet realizes that they aren't going on their vacation anymore. Carly goes to drink again but has no alcohol so she sees Craig's belongings on her couch and packs them up instead. She then interrupts a business meeting to tell him to get out of her life. Meg is at a loss as to what to do about Paul kidnapping Eliza, as Lily tries to help. Luke is frustrated with Damian thinking he made it worse on Meg, but Noah and Damian come up with a plan to have Meg post a video plea to Paul to get his, as well as Eliza's and Meg's face out there. Meg agrees and with the support of Damian, Lily, Luke and Noah, Meg makes an emotional plea to Paul. Lily and Luke thank Damian, who is busy showing a lot of support to Meg. Damian promises her that Paul will be affected by her words. Meanwhile, Rosanna's employee sees the video and realizes what Paul has done."

        "Lily: You're up.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I couldn't sleep much.",
        "Lily: Holden says they have some new leads that they're gonna track down.",
        "Meg: That's it?",
        "Lily: For now.",
        "Meg: Why is this taking so long? I'm going crazy sitting here.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. That's why I that that we should go somewhere and do something.",
        "Meg: I don't know.",
        "Lily: I know it sounds self-indulgent, but just sitting around here worrying isn't gonna bring Eliza home any faster.",
        "Meg: Lily, look, I -- I know you're trying to help.",
        "Lily: \"But be quiet.\"",
        "Meg: No, no, no.",
        "Lily: It wasn't my brightest idea.",
        "Meg: I appreciate the thought.",
        "Lily: I just want to do something. We all feel so helpless.",
        "Meg: You've all been so good to me.",
        "Lily: You're our family, Meg. And I promise you no matter what it takes, we are gonna find Paul and bring your baby home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Hey. What's up?",
        "Luke: Hey. We just found out that we can postpone the cruise without taking a hit.",
        "Noah: It's a good thing we didn't start recruiting kids.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I wouldn't do this if I knew it would upset people, but it just feels so wrong to take off now when my little cousin's missing.",
        "Noah: They still have no idea where Paul went, do they?",
        "Luke: It's like he disappeared from the face of the earth.",
        "Noah: Don't worry. He's got to pop back up on the grid sometime soon.",
        "Luke: Have you been watching \"Bourne\" movies again?",
        "Noah: The first one. It was on cable last night. But it's really hard for someone to just disappear, especially a man alone with a baby.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I guess that does have to stick out.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Pretty soon, he'll run out of cash or transportation, or food. They'll get him.",
        "Luke: I hope so.",
        "Damian: I wish I caught him at that airfield.",
        "Noah: Damian, you should have given that information to the police.",
        "Damian: Well, at the time, Meg and I thought we could faster than they could.",
        "Luke: Instead, you just made sure that he wouldn't call his mother again.",
        "Noah: Um, Luke, you're no stranger to going off on your own.",
        "Luke: I know. And you're the first person to tell me that I just make things worse. Which is exactly what you've done right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You don't have to put that away. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Carly: Well, you're not staying here.",
        "Craig: Mm. Sorry to disappoint, but until further notice, that couch is my home.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Craig, I told you, I'm going to a meeting.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. Today.",
        "Carly: Yes, sure, today. So you don't have to be my babysitter.",
        "Craig: Maybe, once I see you walk into that room.",
        "Carly: You're not going with me.",
        "Craig: Oh, but I am. Well, what do you know? There's a meeting in -- 15 minutes.",
        "Carly: You got a schedule?",
        "Craig: You ready?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Craig: You'll be fine. But we really should get going.",
        "Carly: Craig, you're not going with me.",
        "Craig: How do I know you'll go without me?",
        "Carly: You just have to trust me.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Carly: You're being ridiculous.",
        "Craig: Carly, you got into this hole on my watch. I'm just gonna make sure you get out of it.",
        "Carly: You're not in charge of my life, Craig.",
        "Craig: Until you prove you can take over that job again, yes, Carly, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Jack.",
        "Jack: Hmm? What is it?",
        "Janet: It's called French toast. And you're supposed to eat it, not sleep on it.",
        "Jack: It looks great, Honey. I just don't have an appetite.",
        "Janet: Are you sick?",
        "Jack: No, no. Just too tired to eat.",
        "Janet: Didn't you get any sleep last night?",
        "Jack: I got a couple hours. I had some crazy dreams.",
        "Janet: Mm. About what?",
        "Jack: My kids. And each one of them started with a phone call from Craig Montgomery.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, that's not a nightmare. That's your life.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Yeah, right.",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm. What was he calling you for?",
        "Jack: Uh, Parker crashed his car. Uh, J.J. fell off a cliff during a class trip.",
        "Janet: Sage?",
        "Jack: Sage was in there, too. I don't quite remember the details about her being stranded and Carly not picking her up.",
        "Janet: No wonder you're exhausted.",
        "Jack: Carly was too drunk. That's why she never showed up.",
        "Janet: Oh. Well, that's an easy one to interpret.",
        "Jack: I know. I just can't get my mind to shut off.",
        "Janet: It's our job. We're parents. We're supposed to worry. You know, I don't think that I've had a good night's sleep since Liberty was born.",
        "Jack: Well, I've been there. It's not that, though. It's like my -- my subconscious is sending me an S.O.S., telling me that Parker and Sage staying with Carly is a terrible mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, we really should get going.",
        "Carly: I'm -- I have to check on Parker.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Carly: Because he hasn't come down from his room yet.",
        "Craig: He'll be there when you get back.",
        "Carly: I just want to find out what he's doing.",
        "Craig: I can tell you. He's up there trying to throw away his life, which you can't help him with until you stop doing it yourself. Now come on. Let's go.",
        "Carly: All right! I can walk on my own.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Anyone here?",
        "[Parker picks up Craig's wallet on the table and looks in it and takes the money]",
        "[Parker sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I know you're worried, but that D.U.I. bust was the ultimate wake-up call for Carly.",
        "Jack: Oh, I hope so.",
        "Janet: She said she's gonna get her act together, and Craig's gonna help her do that.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Jack: How? If anyone told me that I'd be relying on Craig Montgomery to be looking after my kids --",
        "Janet: People change.",
        "Jack: No. I really -- I really don't believe that.",
        "Janet: Well, you're gonna have to count on it with Carly.",
        "Jack: I do, don't I?",
        "Janet: Yes. Maybe Craig's changed, too.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but will he get better or worse?",
        "Janet: He wants to help her. He cares about her.",
        "Jack: He says.",
        "Janet: Hey, he's getting her to go to the meetings. And -- and nobody in our family's been busted in the last three days or so.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: There's -- there's that.",
        "Janet: There's that. Got to give it some time, Jack.",
        "Jack: Don't really have a choice, do I?",
        "Janet: No. And this brooding that you're doing is not gonna make it go any faster.",
        "Jack: Who says I'm brooding?",
        "Janet: Okay, whatever you call it, it's not helping! It's making you crazy.",
        "Jack: What am I supposed to do? My family is falling apart. My ex-wife is trying to pull herself out of a death spiral with the least trustworthy person in town.",
        "Janet: Relax.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Janet: I'm serious. Parker and Sage are tough cookies.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Janet: They take after their daddy.",
        "Jack: They have never dealt with anything even remotely like this.",
        "Janet: I know, but they love her. They can handle this. You've got to give yourself a break.",
        "Jack: I wish I could, believe me. Carly drinking and Parker dropping out -- if I could just be sure that in a few weeks or a year, two years that we'd be past this, I'd be fine. But I -- but I -- I'm not sure. There's no guarantee that we will be past this.",
        "Janet: We will. I promise you. And in the meantime, you just try and worry about yourself for a change.",
        "Jack: I thought that was your job.",
        "Janet: So let me do it.",
        "Jack: Come here. I'd love to. Believe me. But unless you have some way of making sure that my kids are gonna be safe and happy, there's not much you can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meeting's in here.",
        "Carly: Does that mean you'll let go of my arm now?",
        "Craig: Okay, but I'm still gonna watch you go through that door. You okay?",
        "Carly: What do you think?",
        "Craig: You said you wanted to do this.",
        "Carly: Only because you wouldn't let it go.",
        "Craig: Okay, use me as an excuse all you want.",
        "Carly: Don't get all psychological on me. I couldn't bear it.",
        "Craig: Just go in there and see what it's like.",
        "Carly: I don't care what it's like. I got stopped for a D.U.I. once. I'm totally functioning. I'm totally in control of what I'm doing.",
        "Craig: I know you're scared.",
        "Carly: I'm not scared. I just don't see how it'll help me to stand up in front of a bunch of strangers and say, \"Hello, I'm Carly. I'm an alcoholic.\" I'm not an alcoholic!",
        "Craig: Well, then, you have nothing to worry about.",
        "Carly: And you have no reason to ask me to embarrass myself in front of a bunch of drunks!",
        "Craig: You know what they say -- \"One day at a time.\"",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Craig: I'll wait for you right out here.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no. Please don't do that.",
        "Craig: I don't mind.",
        "Carly: No. Check on Johnny or check on the business. I think I'm probably gonna want some time alone after this.",
        "Craig: Okay. You'll call my cell when you're done?",
        "[Carly groans]",
        "Carly: If I'll get rid of you by doing that, yes, I will.",
        "Craig: You'll never get rid of me. Good luck.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You're right, Luke. I had a chance to bring Meg's daughter home, and I failed. But I'm not giving up.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Damian: Because I know what it's like to be cut off from a child.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Meg didn't do anything to deserve it?",
        "Noah: Okay, what is this about?",
        "Luke: Look, I am just trying to figure out why this means so much to you.",
        "Damian: Because she's part of your family.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but she's not part of yours.",
        "Damian: Your family is my family, as long as you allow me to be part of your life.",
        "Luke: Okay. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just really worried about the baby.",
        "Damian: We all are.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm gonna go home, see if there's anything I can do to help.",
        "Noah: Want me to come?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no. It's okay. And, Damian, I know you're trying to help, but maybe it would be better if you just -- just back off a little bit.",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Luke: See you.",
        "Damian: There's a lot of unfortunate history between us.",
        "Noah: I thought you two were getting past it.",
        "Damian: Yeah. So did I.",
        "Noah: Seems like its always two steps forward and one step back or --",
        "Damian: Well, that's better than no steps forward at all.",
        "Noah: I guess. Listen, I know you're trying to help.",
        "Damian: I knew it could backfire on that airfield. I just thought it was a try.",
        "Noah: Hey, nobody came closer to catching him than you did.",
        "Damian: I thought if Paul saw Meg, if they came face-to-face, she might get through to him. I still think that. There's just no way to make that happen now.",
        "Noah: Maybe there is.",
        "Damian: Paul's gone. He could be anywhere.",
        "Noah: Maybe he doesn't have to be here for you to get in his face.",
        "Damian: What do you mean?",
        "Noah: Well, the internet is everywhere. I mean, if we make a tape of Meg talking straight to Paul and post it on us tube, if it goes viral, there's a chance Paul could see it.",
        "Damian: \"Viral\"?",
        "Noah: Well, when things spread on the internet, it's like a virus. I mean, a little video clip can be seen all over the world.",
        "Damian: Wonder when you can make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Duff: I haven't seen you in a meeting before.",
        "Carly: Uh, this is my first one. Just came to check it out, see what the deal is.",
        "Duff: Well, it's good to have you.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Carly: You know, I don't -- I don't think I'm gonna stay. I mean, I really respect what you all do in there. It's just I don't think it's for me.",
        "Duff: Well, I used to tell myself the same lie when I first came.",
        "Carly: It -- it's not a lie.",
        "Duff: Sure.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna get going.",
        "Duff: Well, which way are you walking?",
        "Carly: No, I'm not. I mean, I'm -- I'm meeting someone. So good luck with the -- whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Don't you have your own place?",
        "Craig: Your mother needs me right now.",
        "Parker: What about Johnny? Doesn't he need you?",
        "Craig: Johnny's in school.",
        "Parker: Poor kid.",
        "Craig: Well, some people prefer not to go through life stupid.",
        "Parker: And some people aren't old enough to know that their parents are full of it.",
        "Craig: That's right. I forgot how mature you are for your age.",
        "Parker: Craig, what -- what do you want from me?",
        "Craig: Seriously? I'd like us to be friends again.",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Craig: I know you're still angry at me about the car.",
        "Parker: You had no right to trash my car.",
        "Craig: Just fixing the mistake I made when I let you buy it in the first place.",
        "Parker: Is that supposed to make me want to be friends with you again?",
        "Craig: Okay, you know, you need to dial back the self-pity. It's really very unbecoming.",
        "Parker: Oh, thanks. You've -- you've really changed my life.",
        "Craig: I'm trying to help you, Parker.",
        "Parker: No, what you're trying to do is score points with my mom. And you think that handling me is gonna do just that. But that's your game, Craig, okay? Not mine.",
        "Craig: Where are you going?",
        "Parker: What part of this conversation made you think that that's any of your business?",
        "Craig: Did you see my wallet?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Craig: I left my wallet on the desk. Have you seen it?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Craig: There's no one else here.",
        "Parker: Well, maybe you just left it someplace else.",
        "Craig: No. I left it right there.",
        "Parker: Well, I haven't seen it, okay? If you don't believe me, you can call the cops.",
        "Parker: Hey, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: How were your tilapia crepes, Mr. Vogel?",
        "Mr. Vogel: Even more delicious than usual.",
        "Janet: Oh, good! Vienna's using a new recipe. She is using wild-caught fish instead of farm-raised, and a whole-grain batter.",
        "Mr. Vogel: Give her my compliments. You look tired, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Janet: Family problems. I'll get you your change.",
        "Mr. Vogel: I have a better idea. Would you like to spend four days in Florida, free?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What are you doing here?",
        "Damian: I know you asked me to stay out of this, but Noah had a wonderful suggestion. Stop us if we're intruding, but I think you should hear his idea.",
        "Meg: Sure.",
        "Noah: We were talking about how we could reach out to Paul, even though we don't know where he is. And I was thinking we could use the internet.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Noah: We post a video of Meg just asking Paul to bring Eliza home.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Why would he care what I have to say?",
        "Lily: He's always cared about you -- too much.",
        "Meg: So you think it'll work?",
        "Lily: I think it's worth a try.",
        "Noah: We need photos a -- and home videos -- whatever you have, especially of Paul with the baby so people know what they look like.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but they already showed photos like that on TV.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but on TV, things just flash by. Online, you can really stop and look at them. But the main thing is to shoot a direct appeal from you to Paul just -- just asking him to bring her home.",
        "Lily: I think it's a great idea.",
        "Meg: So do I. Thank you both.",
        "Noah: Okay. So, um, you get the photos and the videos, and, uh, I'll go pick up the equipment that Damian rented, and we'll meet you at Fairwinds.",
        "Meg: Wait, wait, wait. Why there?",
        "Damian: Noah thinks, and I agree, that it would be more effective if we see you where your baby lived.",
        "Lily: You can't ask her to do that.",
        "Meg: I think I'm gonna have to.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Meg: No. But I have to do something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey!",
        "Janet: I have the most incredible news. Do you remember that customer of mine, Mr. Vogel?",
        "Jack: The fish pancake guy.",
        "Janet: That's the guy. That's the guy. Well, he is a travel agent, and he just gave me two free vouchers to Florida, four days -- airfare, hotel, the whole ball of wax, free!",
        "Jack: You're kidding me.",
        "Janet: I'm not kidding! We can finally take our honeymoon.",
        "Jack: When?",
        "Janet: As soon as possible. They're only good till the end of the month. Can you imagine, the two of us on the beach, all alone -- no job, no stress, no family?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Janet: No bathing suits.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Janet: Huh?! How does that sound?",
        "Jack: It sounds -- it sounds fantastic. There's just no way I can go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, hello. How'd you get in there? That's how. Hey. You survived.",
        "Carly: Barely.",
        "Craig: How was it?",
        "Carly: Interesting.",
        "Craig: Good.",
        "Carly: But, um, it's not for me.",
        "Craig: Carly.",
        "Carly: Craig, I -- I know what you think.",
        "Craig: Yeah, that it works.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe. But I -- I would have to believe in it.",
        "Craig: Why don't you?",
        "Carly: Because I'm not like the people at that meeting. I'm not broke and depressed.",
        "Craig: Or in denial.",
        "Carly: No. No, I admit that on several occasions lately, I've had too much to drink. But I can stop on my own. I don't need some new religion to get me there.",

        "Carly: You're wrong.",
        "Craig: Carly, you could have gotten yourself killed the other day.",
        "Carly: But I didn't.",
        "Craig: That's because a cop pulled you over.",
        "Carly: It's not gonna happen again.",
        "Craig: That's not the point. Jack is only letting the kids stay here because you promised to go to meetings.",
        "Carly: Jack just wants me to take proper care of those kids, and I will. I don't need help from some group, and I don't need help from you.",
        "Craig: You think Jack would go along with that?",
        "Carly: He'll be happy if I can get my act together and get you out of here.",
        "Craig: You didn't answer my question.",
        "Carly: I already have one cop in my life, Craig. I don't need another.",
        "Craig: Parker. Guess what? I found my wallet.",
        "Parker: Good for you.",

        "Parker: So?",
        "Craig: You know what else I found there -- or didn't find?",
        "Carly: Wait. What's going on here?",
        "Craig: $300 are missing.",
        "Carly: From -- from your wallet?",
        "Craig: Any idea where that went, Parker?",
        "Parker: How would I know?",
        "Craig: You were the only one here.",
        "Parker: Oh. So now I'm a thief.",
        "Craig: I think that's been well-established. What's in the bag?",
        "Parker: Stuff.",
        "Craig: Expensive electronic stuff?",
        "Parker: I didn't take your money.",

        "Parker: What you did with his money.",
        "Carly: He's right. I -- I did take the money.",
        "Craig: Is that so?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I needed some cash. I didn't have time to stop at the bank.",
        "Craig: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Carly: I guess I forgot with everything that's going on, you know? I'll pay you back as soon as I can get to an ATM, okay?",
        "Craig: Why did you hide my wallet?",
        "Carly: I didn't.",
        "Craig: Well, someone put it under the sofa.",
        "Carly: I -- I suppose I could have dropped it.",
        "Craig: And then kicked it?",
        "Carly: I suppose it's possible, accidentally. I certainly don't have a reason to hide it.",
        "Craig: No, I don't suppose you would.",
        "Parker: Are you still gonna call the cops on me, teach me another lesson?",
        "Craig: Why bother? You don't seem to learn a thing.",
        "Carly: Craig --",
        "Parker: I'll be upstairs.",
        "Carly: What?!",
        "Craig: That was interesting.",
        "Carly: What was?",
        "Craig: The Texas two-step you just played with Parker.",
        "Carly: I don't have any idea what you're talking about.",
        "Craig: You think I didn't see the signals you sent back and forth? You two should work at the airport.",
        "Carly: Craig, you know what? It's -- it's time for you to go, okay?",
        "Craig: Not until I find out what's really going on.",
        "Carly: What's really going on is that you're smothering me! I need you to give me some space!",
        "Craig: Don't change the subject.",

        "Craig: I'm trying to help you, Carly.",

        "Craig: My son's in school.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, then, go to work. Don't you have a company to run? Go and do something useful. Because you're not doing anything useful here.",
        "Craig: Okay, fine. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Much later, I hope.",
        "Craig: In the meantime, you and Parker can get your stories straight.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Will you stop acting like we're some sort of crime duo? It's ridiculous.",
        "Craig: I'm starting to see why he's such a bad liar.",

        "Jack: Not right now.",
        "Janet: Well, I figured that since you already had the search in place, maybe you could have somebody else watch the shop for a little while. Just a few days.",
        "Jack: It's not just Eliza.",
        "Janet: Carly and the kids.",

        "Parker: Found it.",
        "Carly: Don't lie to me.",
        "Parker: It was just $300. And after what he did to my car, he owes me a lot more than that.",

        "Parker: Yeah, well, you're pretty good at it.",

        "Jack: Just get to the point.",
        "Craig: Parker stole $300 from my wallet, and then Carly lied to cover for him. I'm not making it up.",
        "Jack: You're sure that Parker stole it?",
        "Craig: The money was there, and then it wasn't and Parker was the only one in the house. See, that doesn't bother me as much as --",
        "Jack: As much as what Carly did.",
        "Craig: Right. I don't know why she would lie to cover for him, Jack, but I've got a really bad feeling.",

I know you love our little girl as much as I do. And I know you took her because you're scared of losing her. I still remember your face the first time you saw her. I know a lot has changed since then. But we both love Eliza, and I don't want to lose her, either. Neither of us will be happy without her, and she won't be happy without the both of us. Nothing can change that, not -- not lying, not -- not fighting, not running away. She needs you, and she needs me. You're a good father, Paul. And there have been times where I may have forgotten that. And that wasn't fair to you, or to her. [Voice breaking] So I am asking you to do what you know is the right thing for her. And I promise I will, too. [Meg sobbing] Did you get what you wanted?",

        "Jack: Listen. When I agreed to let the kids stay here, it was because I didn't want to disrupt their lives any more than we already have and because you said you were gonna stop drinking and get some help. If you're gonna add lying to the mix, I'm not really sure that's an improvement.",
        "Carly: I went to a meeting.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know, and I think that's outstanding! I'm happy for you. But you're not the only one who needs help. And if you're gonna continue to cover for Parker, you're making matters worse.",
