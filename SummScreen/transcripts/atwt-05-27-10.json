        "[Molly clears throat]",
        "Holden: What's wrong?",
        "Molly: There's -- I have something caught in my throat. I'm gonna get a glass of water downstairs.",
        "Holden: I'll go.",
        "Molly: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Holden: You sure?",
        "Molly: Yeah. You stay here and keep the bed warm.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Molly: And I'll be right back.",
        "Holden: Hurry back.",
        "Molly: Aah!",
        "Silas: I knew I could get you to come down and see me.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. Let go of me, you creep!",
        "Silas: I love a woman with a temper.",
        "Molly: Were you spying on us?",
        "Silas: I want you back.",
        "Molly: Why would you ever think that I would find a peeping tom attractive?",
        "Silas: You're here, aren't you?",
        "Molly: My God. Were you inside the house?",
        "Silas: That would be trespassing. Besides, the view is much better from the backyard.",
        "Molly: You make me sick.",
        "Silas: Maybe. But from what I could see, things with us were a lot hotter than they are with your farmer.",
        "Holden: Molly!",
        "Molly: There are shotguns in that house, Silas, and believe me when I tell you no one is afraid to use them. So if you leave right now, I won't tell Holden you were here.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Molly: Yeah, I'm on the porch. You have about five seconds to decide how you want this to play out.",
        "Silas: I'm going -- for now. But I'm not giving up.",
        "Holden: Hey. What's going on out here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Hey. How long you been here?",
        "Liberty: Not long. Sorry I couldn't come sooner.",
        "Gabriel: It's not a big deal. I mean, I look like a mess anyway with all these tubes sticking out of me.",
        "Alison: I know the feeling.",
        "Gabriel: So you brought my mom's pearls from the hotel?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I was afraid you weren't gonna wake up, and I heard stories about people in comas knowing what's going on around them, and so I thought if I put them in your hand, you might know you have something to come back to.",
        "Gabriel: Thanks.",
        "[Liberty chuckles]",
        "Gabriel: You probably shouldn't be hanging around a hospital. I mean, uh, your immune system's not back to normal. You could catch something.",
        "Liberty: I got good news, actually. I don't have to have radiation anymore.",
        "Gabriel: That's awesome.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Lily: Hey, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Lily: Hello, Gabriel. You're looking so much better. I just spoke to your doctor. He said that you can be released as long as you have somebody to look after you.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, I, uh -- I can take care of myself.",
        "Lily: I don't know if you know how serious your condition was after the fire.",
        "Gabriel: Well, the coma kind of clued me in.",
        "Liberty: You had a head injury and a collapsed lung, and you were on a respirator. You can't stay by yourself.",
        "Lily: My offer's still open. You can stay with me as long as you'd like.",
        "Gabriel: Why the hell would I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: Hey. I didn't know you were coming over.",
        "Faith: I don't have time to hang out, Sage. I need to see Parker.",
        "Sage: Parker, Faith's here.",
        "Parker: Hey. Sorry. I didn't hear the door.",
        "Sage: That's 'cause I got it. You're welcome.",
        "Parker: Thank you. What's up?",
        "Faith: I heard Margo had to let you go.",
        "Parker: Yeah, it actually turns out Craig was at Monte Carlo right before the fire, and he saw Gabriel after I did, so technically I'm not responsible.",
        "Faith: You must be so relieved.",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah. I'm glad I'm not being charged with attempted murder. But --",
        "Faith: But what? This is great news. Why aren't you happy?",
        "Parker: I'm not going to jail, but I still did what I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Everything was destroyed, huh? I haven't even had time to think about it or these pictures.",
        "Jack: Are the kids okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Kids are fine. I really thought we were gonna lose our son.",
        "Jack: So did I.",
        "Carly: Thank God Gabriel's injuries were not Parker's fault.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Things definitely could have turned out differently. That's for sure.",
        "Carly: But they didn't. Parker's not in any trouble. We're gonna be okay. So I was thinking that tonight would be a really good night to have a family dinner -- uh, a celebration, you know? Sage and I have been cooking all afternoon, all your favorites.",
        "Jack: Well, it's Parker's celebration, Carly, not mine.",
        "Carly: Well, luckily, you two have the same favorites.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: So, what do you say, Jack? Will you come?",
        "Jack: Carly, I know what you're doing. And do you really think that after everything we've been through that a pot roast is gonna make it all better?",
        "Carly: No, I don't think that one dinner is gonna fix everything. But at least we'll be together.",
        "Jack: Carly, we can't ignore the last few days. You convinced Parker to lie to me.",
        "Carly: Jack, to save him.",
        "Jack: And lies are our problem, Carly. They always have been.",
        "Carly: I was afraid for him, and so were you. Be honest with me, Jack. Would you have turned Parker in if he hadn't confessed?",
        "Jack: I -- I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. But I'm proud of what he did. He took responsibility knowing the consequences.",
        "Carly: Well, he's a terrific kid. There's no doubt about that. So, we must have done something right.",
        "Jack: Three things.",
        "Carly: Okay. Here we are. Parker is safe. And I'd like you to come home for dinner.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: You have to eat. And I really need to be with my family tonight. I think we both do. Jack, we worked so hard to get back to where we were before that fire. Do you really want to give that up?",
        "Jack: No. That's not what I want.",
        "Carly: Me neither. These last couple of days have been a nightmare. We both said things that -- that we didn't mean. Not just me.",
        "Jack: No, I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: And I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry for keeping secrets. But I'm not going to apologize for doing everything I could to keep our son safe.",
        "Jack: Carly, we were on the same side.",
        "Carly: It didn't feel that way to me.",
        "Jack: Well, it would have if you had just trusted me.",
        "Carly: Jack, I was scared. And you know me when I'm scared. I don't think things through. And I made a bad choice. I know. But it worked out. Parker's fine. But you -- you and me -- do you think that we can get past this?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Can we at least try? Can you come to dinner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Why would I want to live with people who denied my existence my entire life?",
        "Lily: I know what I did was wrong, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: It's too late.",
        "Lily: No, it's not too late. Your father wants to get to know you.",
        "Gabriel: He's not my father, okay? He's never done anything for me.",
        "Lily: That's because he didn't know about you.",
        "Gabriel: Do you have anything new to tell me? Because I am sick of people telling me how sorry they are, all right? It doesn't change anything.",
        "Liberty: Maybe you should hear her out.",
        "Gabriel: Whose side are you on?",
        "Liberty: Yours. You came here to find out about your dad, right? You don't know what went down before you were born, and Lily does, and it can't hurt to listen.",
        "Gabriel: It does, actually. But talk if it's gonna make you feel better.",
        "Lily: Gabriel, when your mother found out she was pregnant, she was adamant about Craig not finding out. She made all of us promise not to tell him. And as far as I knew, that never changed. She thought that you were better off without Craig in your life.",
        "Gabriel: So no one would find out that your sister's husband cheated on her with the maid?",
        "Lily: No. Sierra's not like that.",
        "Gabriel: All rich people are like that.",
        "Liberty: Gabriel --",
        "Gabriel: Come on. You know it's true.",
        "Liberty: No, you can't just lump people together like that. That's not fair.",
        "Lily: It's all right, Liberty. You don't need to defend me. What I did was terrible, and I am sorry, and I know that it's too late to ask your forgiveness.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. You're right.",
        "Lily: But I can try to help you in any way that I can. I have plenty of room, and there's always somebody around if you need anything.",
        "Gabriel: Great.",
        "Lily: Look, you're not healthy enough to be on your own, and with Craig in jail --",
        "Gabriel: What, like I'm -- I'm gonna live with him?",
        "Lily: The room is yours. No strings attached. Whatever you do after that is up to you.",
        "Liberty: Can I talk to Gabriel in private for a minute?",
        "Lily: Sure. I'll be right outside.",
        "Liberty: I think you're making a big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Sorry it took so long. I just wanted to go outside and have a breath of fresh air.",
        "Holden: Thought I heard voices out there.",
        "Molly: Yeah, me too. Um, I mean, it -- it sounded like they were right out there. And then when I got out there, it stopped. Maybe it's some of Faith's friends from high school playing pranks like we used to.",
        "Holden: No. It didn't sound like kids to me.",
        "Molly: Well, who else would -- would be sneaking around here? You know, but they're gone now. So why don't we go upstairs and pick up where we left off?",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm sorry, Molly. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey. You know, my mom and dad were back together before I got myself into this mess. They still love each other.",
        "Faith: Everyone knows that.",
        "Parker: But they don't agree on how to handle bad news, which is why my dad almost had to choose between being a cop and me.",
        "Faith: Being a cop is just a job. You're way more important.",
        "Parker: You don't get it. It's his whole life. It was the same for my real dad. And the only easy way to be the kid of a cop is to do the right thing all the time, and I'm not so good at that.",
        "Faith: My parents are just as complicated. Everyone knows they should be together except them. But it's not my fault, and whatever happens with your parents is not your fault either. They're just dense.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, I seem to have inherited that a little bit, because I've been a complete jerk to Liberty lately.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Faith: Speaking of parents. Hi, Dad.",
        "Holden: Where are you?",
        "Faith: At Parker's.",
        "Holden: I want you to come home. We need to talk.",
        "Molly: Hey, don't do this, okay?",
        "Faith: What did I do?",
        "Holden: We'll talk about it when you get here.",
        "Parker: Everything okay?",
        "Faith: I don't know. My dad had that voice. I'll call you later.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Good luck.",
        "Sage: You want to I.M. later?",
        "Faith: Uh, yeah, sure. See ya.",
        "Sage: So, everything's okay now and you're not going to jail?",
        "Parker: No, I'm not going to jail. And look, I -- I really appreciate you worrying about me, okay, but everything's fine. Gabriel woke up. He told Margo that it wasn't my fault. And aside from not having my trust fund anymore, everything's fine.",
        "Faith: Even Mom and Dad?",
        "Parker: Yeah. They're fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, I've got to take these back to forensics, and then I'll take you home.",
        "Craig: Uh, that's my ex. Can I just say hello? I'm handcuffed in the middle of a police station. What am I gonna do?",
        "Cop: All right, make it quick.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Hi.",
        "Carly: What do you want, Craig?",
        "Craig: I assume you heard that my son has accused me of trying to kill him.",
        "Carly: I did.",
        "Craig: Look, I'm glad that Parker is free, but I didn't do this, and you know that as well as --",
        "Jack: Keep walking, Montgomery.",
        "Craig: I'm just saying hello, Detective.",
        "Jack: Are you gonna take him to the courthouse, or do I have to get somebody else to do it?",
        "Cop: No, Sir. Yes, Sir.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Gabriel's lying, and you know that, Jack.",
        "Carly: Don't waste your breath, Craig.",
        "Craig: I didn't do this. Everyone knows that -- everyone who counts, that is.",
        "Carly: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I understand why you resent Lily, and I would probably feel the same way. But you got to trust me when I tell you she's a good person, okay? She's just trying to make up for what she did. And I think you should let her.",
        "Gabriel: I can take care of myself.",
        "Liberty: No one's saying you can't. But you don't have to. Craig is a really good dad, and if you just give him a chance, you have no idea how much he wants this.",
        "Gabriel: Look at what he did to me. The only one of his kids that he talks to is Johnny. Lucy's AWOL, and Bryant's dead.",
        "Liberty: Okay. I don't know all the history. But -- but I do know that as far as Johnny goes, Craig would do anything for him. He didn't abandon you growing up any more than my dad did. They just didn't even know we were born.",
        "Gabriel: So, what's your point?",
        "Liberty: But I get it, okay? I came here with a chip on my shoulder. I half expected my dad to reject me, so I was defensive. But I was totally wrong about him, and I loved getting to know him. But then he died. So I guess what I'm saying is if you give people a chance, they might surprise you.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, or they won't.",
        "Liberty: Then you can go back to hating him. Besides, they're not gonna let you out of here unless you have some place to stay, so take Lily up on her offer. She's not gonna hold you prisoner, and it's got to be better than this place.",
        "Gabriel: You're right.",
        "Liberty: I know.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, I'll stay with you. But I don't want to talk about my dad, and I don't want to see him. As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist. So if you're thinking about ambushing me --",
        "Lily: I wouldn't do that. Besides, Craig is in custody.",
        "Gabriel: Good.",
        "Lily: Good. Why don't you, um, gather up your things, and I'll take care of the discharge papers?",
        "[Gabriel sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: It was just kids making noise. No harm done.",
        "Holden: Yeah, this time. What if Faith is hanging out with a bad crowd?",
        "Molly: I really don't think she is.",
        "Holden: You know, I can't take that chance. I know you want to give her the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Molly: Because she's earned it. Faith has been really responsible ever since she moved in here.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you know how manipulative teenagers can be.",
        "Molly: I also know that if you question every move a teenage girl makes, you're asking for trouble. Holden, please let this one go, just this one time. We didn't even see anybody. And if there was a trespasser, maybe they had nothing to do with Faith. Maybe it was some hunters that turned around in the woods.",
        "Holden: Hunters? What? This time of the year? No.",
        "Faith: I'm here. What's up?",
        "Holden: We, uh, thought we heard some of your friends sneaking around the house.",
        "Faith: I don't have any friends.",
        "Molly: There. See? So whoever it was had nothing to do with Faith.",
        "Holden: Okay. So if they weren't your friends, maybe they were your customers.",
        "Faith: Are you accusing me of dealing drugs?",
        "Holden: I hope not, but under the circumstance, I have to ask.",
        "Faith: I can't believe this! I'm used to Mom being on my case all the time, but I thought you trusted me.",
        "Molly: We do.",
        "Faith: If you did, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Whatever. At least I know where I stand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: This is a nice place. You sure you don't want me to use the servants' entrance?",
        "Lily: No. It's just a house, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: Well, it's a hell of a lot nicer than any place me and my mom ever lived.",
        "Lily: Must have been hard for you growing up.",
        "Gabriel: Actually, we did okay. We were pretty happy.",
        "Lily: Good. Listen, I want you to make yourself feel at home here. You can stay as long as you'd like, and if you need anything, just ask.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, I don't really want your charity.",
        "Lily: Okay. Think of it as, uh, a repayment of a debt. Now, you must be starving after all that hospital food.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, no, actually, I'm not hungry.",
        "Lily: Well, you got to eat. How about some homemade chicken soup?",
        "Gabriel: Okay, I guess I could take that down.",
        "Lily: Good. Liberty, can I get you some?",
        "Liberty: No thanks. I can't stay.",
        "Lily: Okay. Be right back.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, you sure you can't stay? I just got here.",
        "Liberty: I got a ton of schoolwork to catch up on. If I don't finish, I won't graduate. But you can call me later, okay?",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, yeah, go work. I'll tell Lily you said goodbye.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden groans]",
        "Holden: I messed up, didn't I?",
        "Molly: You're worried about your daughter, and you jumped to conclusions because I suggested that her friends might be skulking around outside.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I had her tried and convicted before I even had one shred of evidence.",
        "Molly: Holden, there's something that I need to tell you.",
        "Holden: No, Molly, you know what? I've been so trusting, that's almost as bad as not trusting at all though.",
        "Molly: You're wrong. Holden, you believe in people. That's one of your most endearing qualities. There's too much cynicism out there. I'm telling you. People think its hip and it's funny, but it's really just depressing. I love that you always believe the best in people, and I hope that never changes.",
        "Holden: It's not always easy.",
        "Molly: Especially with people like me, who keep letting you down? There's something that I need --",
        "Holden: No, you know what? You've -- you've apologized enough. Why don't we go back upstairs while it's still quiet in this house?",
        "Molly: I would really love that. But you know what? I -- I think that you should call Lily, because I think that she could help you make up with Faith.",
        "Holden: No, no. This was our afternoon to be together.",
        "Molly: It's okay. Your kids come first. And I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Can I get you some more soup? Oh, dessert? You know what? When you're feeling better, I, um -- I could take you shopping for some new clothes.",
        "Gabriel: Actually, my clothes are just fine.",
        "Lily: Yeah. You just didn't bring that much with you, and it's starting to get warm outside.",
        "Gabriel: Back off, lady, okay? I already had a mom.",
        "Lily: I'm just trying to be your friend, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: I just need some air. I'm gonna take a walk around the estate.",
        "Lily: It's just a yard.",
        "Gabriel: Whatever. Hey, Faith.",
        "Faith: What is he doing in our house?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: This was really good, Mom. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Even Sage had seconds.",
        "Sage: It was really good, but I ate too much.",
        "Jack: Me too. I'm never gonna get out of this chair.",
        "Sage: Then go. I'll go get your coffee.",
        "Jack: No, Darling, you know what? I think I'm -- I'm even too full for coffee right now.",
        "Carly: Hmm. Then my work here is done.",
        "Sage: Parker was right. Everything really is okay now.",
        "Carly: It's getting there. At least we're all together.",
        "Sage: And we're gonna stay that way from now on, right, Dad?",
        "Carly: We have a lot to work out, Sage, but we're trying.",
        "Sage: So when is Dad moving back in?",
        "Jack: Sage, I'm gonna be staying at the farm till your mom and I can figure something out.",
        "Sage: Why? You're getting back together, right? Don't you want to be a family anymore?",
        "Jack: Honey, we are always gonna be a family no matter what.",
        "Sage: But it's not the same if you don't live here.",
        "Carly: Hey, uh, you know what? It's still early. And that movie that you wanted to see, Sage -- it just came out. Maybe, Parker, would you mind taking her to see it?",
        "Parker: What do you say? Do you think you can be seen with me in public?",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Sage: I don't know if I feel like a movie.",
        "Parker: Well, what if I throw in a hot-fudge sundae at Al's?",
        "Sage: I guess.",
        "Jack: Wha -- I thought you said you ate too much.",
        "Sage: There's always room for ice cream.",
        "Carly: Yes, that's true. There's always room for ice cream.",
        "Parker: All right.",
        "Jack: Here you go.",
        "Parker: Let's go, Squirt.",
        "Sage: Do not call me \"Squirt\" in public.",
        "[Parker laughs]",
        "Sage: I mean it.",
        "Carly: So -- it's just the two of us.",
        "Jack: Yes. Yes, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Gabriel is gonna be staying with us until he gets back on his feet.",
        "Faith: So you kicked me out of the house for being a bad influence, and you're letting a thief move in?",
        "Lily: Faith, I didn't kick you out. You wanted to move back to the farm, and I supported your decision.",
        "Faith: Because you didn't want me corrupting Natalie and Ethan, I heard you say.",
        "Lily: No, that is not how it happened. I was heartbroken when you moved out. But I thought if we had some space, maybe we'd be able to work through our issues.",
        "Faith: Guess not.",
        "Lily: Baby, your room is upstairs just the way you left it. Gabriel is staying in the guest room.",
        "Faith: But I bet if I asked you and Dad to move back in, you wouldn't let me, but you let a complete stranger move in no problem.",
        "Lily: I thought you and Gabriel were friends.",
        "Faith: That was before he stole Parker's money and got him arrested.",
        "Lily: Gabriel's confession is what got Parker off the hook.",
        "Faith: He's still a liar and a thief!",
        "Lily: I think you're being a little too harsh.",
        "Holden: Faith, you're here. We never finished our conversation.",
        "Faith: If you're here to continue the lecture, I don't want to hear it.",
        "Lily: What was that about?",
        "Holden: I don't even know where to start.",
        "Gabriel: Real nice place you got here.",
        "Faith: Save the sucking up for my mom, and don't take anything that doesn't belong to you. I know you have a habit of doing that.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, look, I don't want to be here either, all right? But I got no money, and my car's been repossessed, okay, so I'm stuck here until I decide my next move.",
        "Faith: So if you had a car, you'd leave?",
        "Gabriel: Hell yeah.",
        "Faith: My mom leaves the keys in her glove compartment, but you didn't hear it from me.",
        "[Gabriel chuckles]",
        "Gabriel: Thanks.",
        "Faith: Don't thank me. Just get out.",
        "[Gabriel chuckles]",
        "Gabriel: I got to see someone first. You're a good kid.",
        "Faith: I'm not a kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: I knew you'd come looking for me.",
        "Molly: Would you just stay the hell away from me?! How many times, how many different ways do I have to say that before it penetrates that thick, sleazy skull of yours, huh?",
        "Silas: Oh, come on. I knew you were mad at me for what happened back in New York.",
        "Molly: Oh, you think?",
        "Silas: But it's ancient history. I left my wife.",
        "Molly: No, she dumped you.",
        "Silas: The point is that I am available, I'm single, and I'm ready. We can have a life together just the way we planned.",
        "[Molly chuckles]",
        "Molly: And you think spying on me and my boyfriend in bed is gonna make me come running back to you with open arms?",
        "Silas: Isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Faith said she doesn't know anything about any kids coming around the farm, but you'd better watch just in case.",
        "Lily: I haven't seen anybody lurking around. I mean, Gabriel's outside taking a walk.",
        "Holden: Gabriel? What's he doing here?",
        "Lily: I offered him a place to stay.",
        "Holden: Why would you do that? The kid's been nothing but trouble since day one.",
        "Lily: Maybe if I'd done the right thing, things would have turned out differently.",
        "Holden: I doubt it. He's trouble. It was probably him running around the farm.",
        "Lily: No, it wasn't. I brought him right here from the hospital. Holden, before you start lecturing me, too, I wouldn't have brought him here if I thought he was dangerous.",
        "Holden: Lily, it's not just him. I'm worried about you being in the middle of this whole Craig thing.",
        "Lily: Craig can't do anything while he's in jail.",
        "Holden: Yeah, assuming he stays there, which would be a first.",
        "Lily: Holden, I appreciate you worrying about me, but I have to do this. And I would like for you to understand, but if you can't, please, stay out of my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I hate what's happened to us.",
        "Jack: I didn't want to leave. You kicked me out.",
        "Carly: No, I -- I asked you to leave for Parker's sake, and yours.",
        "Jack: Yes, because you didn't want me grilling him about what happened with Gabriel.",
        "Carly: I knew if he found out, you would have to choose between the law and your son. And that's exactly what happened, isn't it?",
        "Jack: That's not what you had me -- had me believe. Carly, look, you played -- you played into my concern with Janet, told me that you felt like I was choosing them over you and that you didn't want to compete for me.",
        "Carly: Well, that's the truth.",
        "Jack: Carly, that is not why you had me leave. You lied to me.",
        "Carly: Yes, I did. And I am sorry.",
        "Jack: Well, you may be sorry, yes, but the fact still remains that Janet is pregnant with my child.",
        "Carly: I am aware of the situation.",
        "Jack: Yes, and I still feel responsible for them, and that is never gonna change. So I need you to be honest with me, honest with yourself. I love you, but it is not gonna be just the two of us for a very long time. Are you sure you're gonna be able to live with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Your life is a mess, Silas. Deal with it and stop harassing me.",
        "Silas: My life is a disaster. And whose fault is that? I lost everything because of you -- my career, my family, my reputation. There's nothing left.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Molly: You promised you were gonna leave your wife for me, and you didn't.",
        "Silas: And you broadcast it to the world.",
        "Molly: Yeah, because you were running for office, and I thought that people should know who they were voting for.",
        "Silas: You wanted revenge. Simple -- plain simple.",
        "Molly: And you tried to kill me, and the fact that you're not in prison right now doesn't change that.",
        "Silas: You little tease. You think you can destroy everything I worked for and just walk away? Well, you think again, Darling. You are so going to regret this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I know you feel bad about lying to Craig, but that does not make him a good guy. And Gabriel -- he's following in Craig's footsteps without being under his influence.",
        "Lily: Why can't you give him the benefit of the doubt?",
        "Holden: Because he blackmailed his own father. He stole money from Parker. He didn't own up to who he was.",
        "Lily: Yes, he made some terrible mistakes. But he had reasons. He's had a really rough life. He's lost his mother. Now he's all alone in the world. He came here looking for a connection.",
        "Holden: He was looking for revenge.",
        "Lily: You don't know that.",
        "Holden: Lily, come on.",
        "Lily: Holden, Gabriel grew up without a father because of me!",
        "Holden: Bryant had Craig in his life. Look what happened to him.",
        "Lily: Do you really think Craig would let something like that happen again?",
        "Holden: It almost did. Look, this kid -- he turned out bad without ever knowing Craig. Imagine what he would have been like under Craig's influence.",
        "Lily: Oh, are we supposed to just cut Luke loose then? Just no matter what we do, he's doomed to turn out like Damian?",

        "Liberty: Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: Get in.",
        "Liberty: Whose car is this?",
        "Gabriel: I borrowed it. I was actually about to come looking for you.",
        "Liberty: You could have just called. I would have come back to Lily's.",
        "Gabriel: No, I had to get out of there. She was all over me, trying to prove what a good person she is. I think she apologized over 300 times already.",
        "Liberty: She's really sorry she lied to you.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, I get it. It just doesn't change anything. You should have seen the look on Faith's face when she found out I was staying here. I mean, she basically begged me to take the car and get out of town.",
        "Liberty: You're piling one wrong thing on top of another. Lily's trying to make things up to you.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, which is why she's not gonna report the car missing, okay? Because she's the reason that I'm a thief.",
        "Liberty: And you're okay with that?",
        "Gabriel: Look, I just want to get out of town and start over with you.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Gabriel: Come with me, Liberty. Teach me how to be a better person.",
        "Liberty: I can't just leave. I -- I've tried that before anyway, and it doesn't work. Trust me. It was a huge mistake.",
        "Gabriel: I'm not Parker.",
        "Liberty: If you really want to be a better person, take Lily's car back and stay.",
        "Cop: Were you aware that you have a broken taillight?",
        "Gabriel: No, Sir, but I'll get that fixed as soon as possible.",
        "Cop: Not before I give you a ticket. License and registration.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, about that, uh, it's a funny thing, actually. I don't have it on me.",
        "Cop: Whose car is this?",
        "Gabriel: What's with the third degree, okay? I said I'll get the taillight fixed. Isn't that what this is about -- public safety?",
        "Cop: Both of you, out of the vehicle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Hi, Guys.",
        "Sage: Hey. We're going to the movies. Do you want to come?",
        "Faith: Better not. My parents don't even know I'm gone. I just needed a break from the constant drama.",
        "Parker: What's going on now?",
        "Faith: My dad's all up in arms about some nonexistent friends coming over to the farm to buy drugs from me or something. Don't look at me like that, Sage. I'm not a drug dealer. It's in his imagination.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Faith: Don't tell me you don't believe me either.",
        "Parker: No, I do. It's -- it's just --",
        "Faith: What is it gonna take to convince people that I'm not a criminal? And get this. Every time I turn around, my mom suspects me of doing something I didn't do, and yet she invites Gabriel, who actually is a criminal, to come live with her.",
        "Parker: Wait. He's staying with your mom?",
        "Faith: Yep.",
        "Sage: Why?",
        "Parker: Well, he probably just needs a place to stay. I mean, he did get hurt pretty badly.",
        "Faith: Stop feeling guilty about it. Anyway, he took my mom's car, so hopefully he's out of town by now.",
        "Sage: He stole her car?",
        "Faith: He borrowed it. Just without her permission.",
        "Parker: Well, do you think he'll really leave?",
        "Faith: You'd like that, wouldn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I understand how you feel about Janet and the baby. I just thought it would be easier for me to deal with.",
        "Jack: That's honest.",
        "Carly: I hate it when I need you and you're not there, and I resent Janet. I wish I didn't. I wish you didn't have so much damn integrity. You always do the right thing. You expect me to do the right thing all the time, no matter what it costs us. But I'm selfish. I don't want to share you. I want you to myself. I'm jealous of an unborn child. How pathetic is that?",
        "Jack: No, Carly, it's not pathetic.",
        "Carly: Just let me finish. This is so much harder than I thought it would be. I want you to come home to me. As hard as it is for us to be together, it's a thousand times harder to be apart. I love you too much to let you go.",
        "Jack: I love you, too. We are so very different, and that scares me sometimes. But, Carly, we both know that I've tried to live without you. We know how that's worked out.",
        "Carly: So, here we are.",
        "Jack: I think it's time to face the fact that for better or worse, we're meant to be together. All I ask is that we try to be more better than worse.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I promise to try. But I'm -- I'm not more better than worse.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, no. Stop. You are -- you're absolutely perfect. And what's more is that we are perfect together.",
        "Carly: So does this mean you're coming home?",
        "Jack: Try and keep me away. What time are the kids coming home from that movie?",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, the movie hasn't even started yet, so I figure we have at least a couple of hours alone.",
        "Jack: It's good to be home.",

        "Parker: You know, it wouldn't break my heart if Gabriel left town.",
        "Faith: Because Liberty has a thing for him?",
        "Parker: Well, she doesn't, okay? She just feels sorry for the guy.",
        "Faith: It's way more than that. You've done everything for her. If she wanted to be with you, she would. I'm just saying.",
        "Sage: If we don't leave now, we'll be late for the movie.",
        "Parker: Yeah, okay. Let's go.",
        "Sage: Bye, Faith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: We're calling the owner of the car right now.",

        "Holden: You brought it up.",
        "Lily: Look, Holden, I'm not asking you to give him an unlimited number of chances. Just one. He deserves that.",
        "Holden: I just don't understand why you think it's your responsibility to take on.",
        "Lily: Because he's never had a real family. If -- if I can give him a taste of that, I need to try.",
        "Holden: So you're gonna bring him into your own home?",
        "Lily: Yes. And I could really use your help.",
        "Holden: All right, all right. I admire you for trying to do the right thing. And who knows? Maybe I'll, uh -- maybe I'll be surprised.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
