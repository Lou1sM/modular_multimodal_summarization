        "Jessica: Good morning, handsome.",

        "Jessica: Hey. Or should I say, \"Good Afternoon\"?",
        "Ben: Oh, man, already?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ben: Ah -- must be getting used to this couch. Makes my bed feel like a bed of nails, you know? Plus, I'm right down there next to the Kitchen, so I can raid the refrigerator in the middle of the night, and I don't wake you.",
        "Jessica: You don't have to do this anymore, Ben.",
        "Ben: Do what?",
        "Jessica: Camping out on my sofa -- well, that might be agreeing with you, but it's doing absolutely nothing for me. And I'm not gonna let you spend one more night down here.",

        "Lily: Hi. How's it going?",
        "Rose: Um, just putting a couple of Paul's things away and just -- he left so much stuff here, that guy. I miss him.",
        "Lily: Are you sure you're ready to do that now?",
        "Rose: Yeah, it -- it seemed right, you know, having his stuff around here when he's not coming back. Knowing that I disappointed him, knowing that this was all my fault.",
        "Lily: Rose, I'm not gonna let you blame yourself for Paul's -- it's amazing, how two people's lives can become so entwined.",
        "Rose: Yeah. Going through all his stuff, and I'm thinking, was this mine, or was it his? I mean, he gave me so many presents, it's just -- don't open that, Lily.",
        "Lily: Your engagement ring. I'm sorry, Rose. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.",
        "Rose: No, it's okay. Certain things like that just set me off. I'm okay.",
        "Lily: You should come stay with us.",
        "Rose: I couldn't.",
        "Lily: Sure you could. I can always use the help with Natalie. Around those three kids, you won't have time to cry. You need to be around people who care about you that can help you get through this.",
        "Rose: Thank you. What would I do without you? But I've got ample shoulders to cry on. I'm kind of cornering the market. I've got my Mitzi.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you've got Mitzi, and you have Lucinda, and you have me. But Holden and I would love to have you.",
        "Rose: Look, you're gonna hear about this from somebody else. I would just like to be the one to tell you.",
        "Lily: Tell me what?",
        "Rose: Dusty's gonna be staying in town for a while.",
        "Lily: Are you serious? Why?",
        "Rose: Because I asked him to.",

        "Dusty: Sorry to bother you, Mrs. --",
        "Nurse: Ms. Lawson.",
        "Dusty: Dusty. How you doing?",
        "Nurse: It's a pleasure, Dusty. How can I help you?",
        "Dusty: I'm supposed to have lunch with Dr. Dixon, but if he's not around, I don't know, maybe you and I could have lunch.",
        "[Nurse laughs.]",
        "Nurse: Dr. Dixon I believe was called into emergency surgery, but I can check.",
        "Dusty: That'd be great.",
        "Nurse: Okay. I'll be back.",
        "McCann: So what's a punk like you doing in a place like this?",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "McCann: No, see, that's my question. It's come to Spangler's attention that you haven't left town yet. He was wondering why that is.",
        "Dusty: You my keeper now?",
        "McCann: Looks like you need one, but I'm not applying for the job.",
        "Dusty: So why are we talking?",
        "McCann: When I was in school, the teacher thought I was daydreaming. But all the time, I had my ears and eyes wide open. I hear information, it sticks in my head.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for sharing.",
        "McCann: You know, some things from school, they stay with you. For instance, one quotation, how's it go? \"A Rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\" For some reason, I just can't get that one out of my head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna (to Carly): Where's it gonna end? When are you gonna realize the damage you cause?",
        "Emma: You never did tell me how it happened.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I was slogging through the woods this morning.",
        "Rosanna: You said you could get Jack Snyder off my back, Craig? Let's hope to God you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come with me to the farm, watch the search.",
        "Craig: Let you watch me watch you? No thanks.",
        "Margo: I think the point is, Craig, that you'll be able to see with your own eyes that the search is legit.",
        "Jack: Hey, and if we find the item we're looking for, then you'll know your wife was hiding information -- information that could mean life or death to Carly.",

        "[Cell phone rings.]",
        "Craig: Hello?",
        "Rosanna: So what's going on over there? Any new developments?",
        "Craig: Plenty, but I can't go into details right now.",
        "Rosanna: Well, just tell me that you've put a stop to Jack's witch hunt. Tell me this has all been an embarrassing mistake and that they've found Carly and I can breathe again. Craig, say something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Hey, you guys. How's it going?",
        "Teen 1: It was going okay.",
        "Bonnie: Would you guys like to maybe --",
        "Teen 2: We wouldn't, okay?",
        "Teen 1: Look, we didn't come here to get hassled.",
        "Bonnie: Look, I'm not trying to hassle you, okay? I just want --",
        "Teen 2: Hit the mute button.",
        "Teen 1: She won't disappear.",
        "Teen 2: Looks like it's up to us.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, no, wait, you guys. Come on. I just wanted to talk or -- not talk.",
        "Isaac: Bonnie?",
        "Bonnie: Hey, Isaac. Didn't they tell you out front that you might be a little too old for this place?",
        "Isaac: Yeah, but I'm just right for you, and I know you're not going to pass up an iced coffee, are you?",
        "Bonnie: Thanks. You're a godsend. Exactly what I need.",
        "Isaac: This place is a little emptier than I thought it would be. I figured it'd be crawling with kids, and you'd be up to your eyelids --",
        "Bonnie: Oh, no, no, no. That's just the afternoon lull, honey. I mean, for the most part, the kids are just off having lunch, and you know, doing other projects. You know, things like that.",
        "Isaac: So things are going great?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, please. I don't know what the big deal is, you know, working with kids. All you have to do is relate to them on their level. That's the trick. And making a difference in their lives? Well, that's the real motivation. You know, it's the greatest feeling in the world.",
        "Isaac: I'm so glad to hear you say that. Because, to be honest with you, when this thing started, I had some doubts.",
        "Troy: Bonnie, can I see you for a minute?",
        "Bonnie: Uh, yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Sure, Troy. What's up?",
        "Troy: We've had a few complaints about you.",
        "Bonnie: Complaints?",
        "Troy: A lot of the kids think you're, well, kind of pushy.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I was just trying to get through to them, Troy. You know, that's okay. I will try harder.",
        "Troy: But that's just the problem.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, then I will try harder not to try so hard.",
        "Troy: Well, listen, one of the things about working here is knowing when to reach out to a kid and when to wait, let them reach out to you.",
        "Bonnie: So you're saying I'm not being a very good judge of that?",
        "Troy: Well, it's not that we don't appreciate the effort. But as overworked and understaffed as we are here right now, I'm afraid I have to tell you, I'm not sure this is the right place for you.",
        "Bonnie: What?",
        "Troy: Think about it. Think about it. We'll talk later. I'm sure there are dozens of places out there that would love to have you.",
        "Isaac: Bonnie, am I hallucinating or something? You just got finished telling me how well everything's going. Why didn't you just tell me the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "McCann: It's true, then? You're sticking around town to --",
        "[McCann sniffs.]",
        "McCann: Smell the roses?",
        "Dusty: How does it feel to be so stupid? I'm here to see a man who's practically a father to me. I'm not leaving town without saying good-bye to him.",
        "McCann: You're sure this delay has nothing to do with your friend, Rose?",
        "Dusty: Rose does her own thing, I do mine. My work's done here. You understand?",
        "McCann: Try again. See, I've been keeping my ear real close to the pavement, and I got a good tip about the real reason you're still hanging around.",
        "Dusty: Oh yeah?",
        "McCann: Yeah. You could even call it a \"$50 tip.\" See you around, Donovan.",
        "Dusty (to Rose): He left a tip. And you must have made a good impression. 50 bucks.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Dixon will be busy for a while, but I thought we could --",
        "Dusty: That's all right. I'll see you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Let me get this straight. Dusty is staying in town indefinitely because you asked him to?",
        "Rose: All right, go ahead, just say it. It's the lamest idea ever. I'm completely out of my mind.",
        "Lily: What I'm saying is that if Dusty's gonna help you get through these emotions that you're going through about Paul, then I'm not gonna stop you. You have the right to make your own decisions.",
        "Rose: Thank you, Lily.",
        "Lily: Hey, you know, I had a couple of ideas about Paul's memorial service. You want me to tell you about them?",
        "Rose: You do? Thank you. But I really want to keep this simple. You know, just in Paul's honor. Maybe a very simple memorial service. He wouldn't want anything big. You know him, you know? No shindig, just something really low- key. And Barbara's gonna be back in town soon and turn everything into a three-ring circus.",
        "Lily: You know, she's probably going to want to do something for Paul herself.",
        "Rose: Of course, and she should. But you know, that wouldn't stop her from horning in on anything that I'm doing.",
        "Lily: Barbara loved Paul. In her own strange way, she loved him.",
        "Rose: What a way to show it.",
        "Lily: He was her little boy, Rose, her son. It's not right for a child to die before a parent. I understand exactly what she's going through.",
        "Rose: See, that's the difference between you and me, Lily. I want her to suffer. I want her to feel pain like I'm feeling. I want her to feel like her heart has been torn out of her. He loved me so much. He didn't care about my past, he didn't care about my flaws. All he wanted me to do was love him, but I couldn't love him the way that he deserved to be loved, and I just don't know if I'm ever going to be able to forgive myself for that.",
        "Lily: Rose, it's gonna be okay.",
        "Rose: No, it's not, all right? 'Cause I thought I'd have time -- time to get him to forgive me, time to make him understand. But it's over. He loved me more than I deserved to be loved, and he's gone, forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, you promised me that you would make Jack understand.",
        "Craig: I'm working on it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what does that mean exactly?",
        "Craig: It means exactly that. I'm working on it. Now, listen, I will call you as soon as everything is settled. Just try to relax. I'll call you soon.",
        "Rosanna: Well, how exactly am I supposed to do that? Hello, Craig? Craig?",
        "Jack: I couldn't help but notice you didn't tell Rosanna about the search warrant for Emma's farm. Smart move.",
        "Craig: That's because I didn't want to bother her over nothing. Because nothing is what you're gonna find, Jack. And then you're gonna owe my wife a very sincere apology, because when Carly comes marching home --",
        "Jack: Yeah, and you'd better pray that she does.",
        "Craig: You will come crawling to Rosanna on your hands and knees begging for forgiveness.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we'll see.",
        "Craig: Yes, we shall.",
        "Jack: Whatever, let's go. Time's a wasting.",
        "Craig: Margo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: He said he'll call back, he'll call back. He promised me. I trust him.",
        "Mike: Hey. The maid let me in, told me I could find you here.",
        "Rosanna: What are you doing here, Mike?",
        "Mike: Well, I came to get some answers about Carly.",
        "Rosanna: What are talking about, answers?",
        "Mike: Well, the hospital called my place. I don't know, I guess they think that Carly still lives there. It seems she missed her ob appointment. And I've left her a few messages, but she didn't -- I don't know, she must have her phone turned off or something. I thought Craig might know where she is.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, isn't that just typical?",
        "Mike: I beg your pardon?",
        "Rosanna: Anytime anyone wants to find Carly, they come looking for Craig, and then I get to hear all about it.",
        "Mike: Hey, do you know where she is? I mean, you all are sisters, after all.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, that's a mistake of nature. Carly and I haven't gotten along for years, Mike. Unfortunately, a fact which you should be painfully aware of, since you're the reason she and I despise each other.",
        "Mike: Seems like you two were getting along fine the day of your wedding.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we fell prey to a sudden attack of civility, which I assure you did not last.",
        "Mike: That's a shame.",
        "Rosanna: In the past few days, I have learned in the most difficult way possible that Carly and I will never have any peace between each other until \u0096",
        "Mike: Until what?",
        "Rosanna: Until she is gone. And that's what she is. She's gone.",
        "Mike: Okay, but where is she? That's the question.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can't answer that for you, Mike.",
        "Mike: Well, she's not just gonna leave town, not without Parker, not without saying good-bye. There's something else going on -- something you're not telling me.",
        "Rosanna: Are you accusing me of something? Because you're beginning to sound an awful lot like Jack.",
        "Mike: Jack was here asking questions about Carly?",
        "Rosanna: I don't -- I don't have to take your insulting insinuations. Why don't you just both just leave me alone!",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait a second. Why don't you just tell me what Jack said to you?",
        "Rosanna: He thinks I killed her. He thinks I killed Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: You know, I'm -- I'm having a little trouble with something over here.",
        "Jessica: Well, let me see what I can do. Don't tell me these surgeon's hands can't tie a tie.",
        "Ben: Well, actually, I was cool with the tie, but don't let that stop you.",
        "Jessica: Just tell me where it hurts.",
        "Ben: Well, a little earlier, you said you didn't want me sleeping down here on the sofa anymore. So where exactly did you envision me sleeping?",
        "Jessica: At home -- you know, that place you lived before you appointed yourself my bodyguard and protector.",
        "Ben: Well, I don't mind.",
        "Jessica: Well, I do. I mean, I don't mind you being here. I love \u0096 love you being here. But you know, I just think it's time for me to start, I don't know, transitioning out of Jessica the rape victim, Jessica the gunshot victim to just Jessica, you know?",
        "Ben: Well, you're not just Jessica, you know? We are engaged.",
        "Jessica: Yes, I know that. Of course, but you don't have to be my bodyguard 24 hours a day.",
        "Ben: You think I'm camping here because I'm trying to prove what a great Boy Scout I am?",
        "Jessica: Well, are you?",
        "Ben: Believe it or not, I am here because I like being with you, as close to you as I can get every chance I can get.",
        "Jessica: Well, what about your patients, doctor? I mean, your obligations at Memorial. And what about your son, Curtis? Curtis needs you more then I do.",
        "Ben: Curtis is away at camp, and when he gets back, I will be there for him. But right now, I am enjoying being here with you.",
        "Jessica: Well, I am on the road to Wellsville, or haven't you heard? I mean, the doctors say I can start driving, I can do some light exercise. I'm good as new.",
        "Ben: Well, I am happy to hear that. I want to hear that more than anything -- us getting back to normal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Jack, you're not gonna believe this. I was just thinking about you. I hope you haven't had any lunch, because -- something tells me this is not a friendly visit.",
        "Jack: I've got a search warrant for the farm, Emma.",
        "Emma: A search warrant?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry about this.",
        "Emma: Don't be sorry. Just tell me what this is all about.",
        "Cop 1: Where do you want us, detective?",
        "Jack: Uh, take the upstairs. Ramirez, cover the ground floor. I'm really sorry about this.",
        "Emma: Sorry for what? That -- that you're tearing up my house or that you don't have the decency to tell me what this is all about? What do you expect to find here?",
        "Jack: Among other things, I'm looking for a scarf -- the scarf that is going to link Rosanna to Carly's disappearance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Jack can't think you'd kill anyone.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no?",
        "Mike: Tell me he didn't use that word.",
        "Rosanna: He didn't have to. He searched my car, Emma's house. He insulted me with one accusation after another. He did everything but arrest me for murder, and if he has his way, he will.",
        "Mike: What's gotten into that guy?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Why don't you tell me? He's the reason you're here, isn't it?",
        "Mike: What are you talking about?",
        "Rosanna: He brought you here to get me to open up and confess, right?",
        "Mike: Look, no one sent me here. But now that I am here, you'd better believe I'm going to straighten out this situation. Look, Rosanna, I don't know how Jack got on this track, but I mean, this has got to be some big misunderstanding, right?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. What do you think, Mike?",
        "Mike: I don't think you're capable of murder.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thanks. I'm flattered.",
        "Mike: Why don't you ease back a little bit? Now, we used to be able to completely talk to each other and be open and honest.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Carly put an end to that, didn't she? We both know why you're here. You're worried about Carly, and you think something awful has happened to her, and you want to be the one to rescue her, just like every other man in Oakdale who thinks with something than his brain.",
        "Mike: I'm just trying to help out.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I don't need your help, so why don't you just do me a favor and leave?!",
        "Mike: Fine, relax! I won't bother you anymore, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Come on, Craig, don't hang up on me this time.",
        "Craig: Hello? Hello? I'm not hearing anything.",

        "Craig: You there? Hello?",
        "Rosanna: Craig, it's Rosanna.",
        "Emma: But how on earth can a scarf mean that Rosanna is mixed up in all this mess?",

        "Troy: It shouldn't be too hard to find a place that's more up your alley.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I don't think I'm going anywhere, Troy. I'm staying right here.",
        "Isaac: Well, you're gonna have to tell me the truth sooner or later. You can't just avoid me all day long.",
        "Bonnie: Isaac, when did you become such a pest?",
        "Isaac: Around the same time I met you.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, fine. I didn't want to tell you what was going on here at the shelter because I wanted it to work out, and I guess I was hoping for things to change. But I haven't really been here that long, isaac, and I just -- I think it takes time for people to adjust and to fit in.",
        "Isaac: And things aren't going too well. Give it time. You'll be fine.",
        "Bonnie: You know, I don't really think I have that much time left. You heard Troy. He wants me gone. And maybe I should petition the court to place me somewhere else. But with my luck, they'll have me picking up trash along the side of the highway trying to beautify Oakdale. What do you think?",
        "Isaac: I think that you'll make the right decision.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, I just wish I knew what that was.",
        "Isaac: You'll figure it out. You always do. All right, I've got to get to work. So I'll see you later?",
        "Bonnie: Okay.",

        "Rose: I haven't really thought about that, but yeah, I guess. I don't know.",
        "Dusty: You already broke the ice with your first client, right?",
        "Rose: Yeah. How about that, huh? Wow, that was a fluke. And a $50 tip to boot. You don't see that much.",
        "Dusty: What was his name again?",
        "Rose: I don't know. But I will never forget him. 'Cause a stylist, we're supposed to be the ones with the big shoulders, you know? \"Tell us all your problems.\" Here I am, telling him mine. He was nice. He was good looking, too.",
        "Dusty: Yeah?",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Your kind of guy, huh? What did he look like?",
        "Rose: He was tall, salt and pepper hair. You know, good-looking and mysterious, like in a James Bond kind of way.",
        "Dusty: Spangler.",
        "Rose: What? What was that?",
        "Dusty: Nothing.",
        "Rose: That's a lie. 'Cause I know when you're lying to me now.",

        "Jack: It's a black chiffon scarf with tiny sparkles on it. Have you seen anything like that around?",
        "Emma: No, no, I haven't. And I don't see how anything as simple as a little scarf could be so important.",
        "Craig: Jack, are you suggesting Rosanna strangled her sister with a scarf?",
        "Jack: Carly was wearing that scarf at the fashion show. She had it with her afterwards at the police station. I have reason to believe that Rosanna now has that scarf in her possession.",
        "Cop: Detective, there's something out back I think you should see.",
        "Jack: Excuse me, Emma.",
        "Emma: I don't understand what's happening here.",
        "Craig: Well, I'll see what I can find out.",
        "Rosanna: I don't believe this. Jack is here with all of these cops and a search warrant, and you're riding shotgun, helping him to bury me?!",
        "Craig: What? I would never help Jack bury anything.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. I know nothing about you anymore. You say one thing, you mean another. You say you're gonna help me, you say you're gonna get me out of this, and I listen to you!",
        "Craig: Hey, Rosanna, Rosanna, Rosanna -- Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: I trust you, and you betrayed me! I hate you, I hate you! I hate you so much!",
        "Craig: Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: You've ruined everything!",
        "Craig: Hey, hey.",

        "Bonnie: Hi. Come on in. Come on, you caught me. I remember you. You were actually the first person that was even close to being nice to me. You helped me pick up the food the other day when I spilled it. Sarah, right? Well, thank you again, Sarah. You absolutely saved my life. You like this? It's a great shade, isn't it? Would you like to try some on? Oh, come on, come on. You'll love it, you really will. Do your lips like this. I promise, if you don't like it, you can wipe it off, okay? Oh, nice. It's beautiful. It's just enough color and just enough gloss. Go like this. Mm, perfect. Do you want to take a look? Come on, I think you do. Ah.",
        "Sarah: Wow.",
        "[Bonnie laughs.]",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. See how a little lipstick can make you look even prettier?",
        "Sarah: I'm not pretty.",
        "Bonnie: Don't say that. Of course you are.",
        "Sarah: I gotta go.",
        "Bonnie: Wait, wait. Sarah, wait.",
        "Troy: Hey, I was wondering if you'd given any more thought to my suggestion.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. Yes, I have.",
        "Troy: All right. It shouldn't be hard to find a place that's more up your alley.",

        "Jessica: Ben, I've been thinking about what you said, and I'm sorry if it feels like I'm pushing you away. That's -- that's not what I mean to do.",
        "Ben: So, you're not having second thoughts about us?",
        "Jessica: Of course not. But you know what I have been thinking about? I've been thinking about getting back to work.",
        "Ben: Already?",
        "Jessica: Already? It's been long enough. I mean, I miss getting up in the morning and going to the office, you know? I miss the voir dires and the subpoenas and the depositions, and you know, making money.",
        "Ben: Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, wait. If you are worried about making money, don't. We're getting married. Now, I understand that marrying Oakdale's finest neurosurgeon isn't the answer to all of your dreams, but it will allow you to take some time off.",
        "Jessica: You know, I've had enough time off. I'm a lawyer. It's what I do.",
        "Ben: I understand that, and that's one of the things I love about you. But there will be plenty of time to practice law.",
        "Jessica: After when?",
        "Ben: After we take some time for us. Look, work can wait. I think we have been through enough rough patches that we owe ourselves some time to get close to each other again, to get our stride back away from the courthouse, away from the hospital. Hey, I know exactly what we need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: So what is it? Is it something that I said to you? I don't understand.",
        "Dusty: No, it was nothing.",
        "Rose: No, that's a lie. What did that customer from last night have to do with anything?",
        "Dusty: He made me nervous, all right? You're working late by yourself with some guy you don't even know.",
        "Rose: I can take care of myself.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to take care of yourself. After everything that happened with Paul, I -- I owe you. Come here, come here. Nothing's gonna happen to you as long as I'm around.",
        "Rose: Nothing's gonna happen.",
        "Dusty: Everybody needs somebody, right? I'm gonna take care of you.",
        "Barbara: Well, well, well. A regular den of thieves, isn't it?",
        "Rose: Barbara, what are you doing here?",
        "Barbara: When I couldn't find Paul in Europe, I decided to come back here and pick up his trail again and to ask you if you had any important information about my son's whereabouts. My mistake. Obviously, you have more important things on your mind than my son's well-being.",
        "Rose: No, that's -- that's not true.",
        "Barbara: Save it, Rose. Where's my son?",
        "Dusty: Barbara, you don't understand.",

        "Barbara: Oh, I do, all too well, Dusty.",
        "Rose: Just sit down, please. Just sit down.",
        "Barbara: Why would I care about anything that you have to say to me? You are disgusting, Rose. And I will tell Paul all about this sleazy little affair that the two of you are carrying on, and maybe it will be a wake-up call for him, and he will finally understand that everything that I have ever done has been for him. And you will be out of his life forever.",
        "Dusty: Barbara, listen to me. You don't understand. You're not gonna tell Paul anything.",

        "Craig: Hey, hey, you want to throw a tantrum, you wait till we get home. But right now, we have to talk.",
        "Rosanna: Where's Jack? I need to talk to Jack.",
        "Craig: Jack doesn't matter! Right now, we talk!",
        "Rosanna: No! I am listening to you ever again! So why don't you at least try to be helpful to me and tell me what's going on here, why the officers are here. How long have they been here? What does the search warrant say?",
        "Mike: Where's Jack?",
        "Craig: What is he doing here?",
        "Rosanna: Well, isn't it obvious? He's here for the same reason all the rest of you are here -- to help Carly, to come to her aid. Well, I'm sorry, but the damsel has left the building.",
        "Mike: I just saw the cop cars outside. Now where is Jack?",
        "Craig: He's out -- he's out back. They're all outside there.",

        "Rosanna: Help me what, get locked away for life?",
        "Craig: Jack had this asinine idea that he'd find something out here that would connect you to Carly's disappearance, all right? I came along to make sure he didn't try any funny stuff, but he's not going to find anything, because you have nothing to hide, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Take the flower bed, Ramirez. I want you to cover the cellar and the perimeter of the house, okay?",
        "Mike: What's going on, man?",
        "Jack: Police investigation.",
        "Mike: I can see that.",
        "Jack: And as such, it's none of your business.",
        "Mike: Hey, if Carly's missing, it is my business. Now, do you want to tell me why Rosanna is a suspect in Carly's disappearance?",
        "Jack: I really don't have time for this.",
        "Mike: Look, then make time. All right, if Rosanna did something to",

        "Cop 1: I saw these flowers had just been planted, so I was checking the soil around them, and I found this.",
        "Mike: That's Carly's scarf.",

        "Ben: You know what I would like to do? I would like to take you away from all the -- the court cases and the stress and everything -- away to a little tropical island with a luxury hotel and sandy beaches and this blue, blue sea. Just the two of us.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Say again?",
        "Jessica: Sounds like a dream.",
        "Ben: Sounds like a dream as in you're interested?",
        "Jessica: Why not?",
        "Ben: All right! Well, I am just the man to make your dreams come true.",
        "Jessica: All right.",
        "Ben: In fact, when I get to work, I'm gonna get on the Internet and see what's happening --",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no, no. I have a better idea. Why don't -- why don't I call my friend Joanna, the travel agent, and put her to work. I mean, I'm sure she can dig up a couple of round-trip tickets to somewhere in paradise.",
        "Ben: All right. Well, that is a better idea.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ben: I actually thought I was gonna have to twist your arm to get you to even think about taking a vacation.",
        "Jessica: No, you're gonna have to twist my arm to get me back on that airplane to come home.",
        "Ben: All right then. So go ahead and call your Joanna.",
        "Jessica: Joanna.",
        "Ben: Joanna. All right.",

        "Ben: All right. This vacation is going to be just what the doctor ordered. You'll see.",

        "Barbara: And why is that?",

        "Rosanna: It's nothing! You are imagining things, just like Jack. Do you want to accuse me? Why don't you just go ahead and ask me something?",

        "Evelyn: And you are my friend, and that's why it's so difficult for me to say this, but working in the district attorney's office is no longer an option for you.",
