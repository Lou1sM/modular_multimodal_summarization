        "Kim: Bless your heart. You made two \r\nanniversary plates? ",
        "Chris: She made all three. ",
        "Kim: But they're so -- different. ",
        "Bob: Alison, maybe you should tell us -- how \r\nthis all happened. ",
        "Nancy: I'm sorry, dear. ",
        "Alison: It's not your fault. You were just \r\ntrying to help. ",
        "Kim: Help with what? ",
        "Alison: Help me lie, okay? The only plate \r\nthat I made is the one that you guys hate. Those two were bought in a store.\r\n",
        "Chris: But -- I don't understand, Alison. Why \r\ndid you have to lie? ",
        "Alison: Because I'm not a potter. I'm not \r\nanything. I'm just me. But that's not good enough, so I lied! ",

        "Lucy: Did Mom say what time she was meeting \r\nus? ",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey. You know how your mother \r\nis. Her eminence. She's got to pull herself together before she can make the big \r\nappearance. ",
        "Lucy: Well, maybe I should go see if she \r\nneeds help or something. ",
        "Lucinda: Please, don't do that, darling. \r\nShe'll never get down here. Sit down. And I will expire from lack of nourishment \r\nand annoyance. Waiter! Make it another one. ",
        "[Lucinda sighs] ",
        "Lucy: It's just been so long since I've seen \r\nher. So much has happened. ",
        "Lucinda: Don't you two talk all the time?\r\n",
        "Lucy: No, we do. ",
        "Lucinda: Oh. ",
        "Lucy: I told her about Cabot and Rosanna and \r\nPaul. I even talked to her about Daddy. ",
        "[Lucinda laughs] ",
        "Lucinda: What did you say about him? \r\n",
        "Lucy: Just that it seems that he's falling \r\napart. It's hard to describe on the phone. Mom's been really great about it, \r\nthough. She mostly just listens. ",
        "Lucinda: Sierra has mellowed. ",
        "Lucy: The thing about her is she's just -- \r\nshe's always the same. You know, same perfume, same smile. Same look in her eyes \r\nevery time she sees me. It's just so comforting, you know? ",
        "Lucinda: I'm sorry that I haven't been much \r\nin the comfort department, darling. ",
        "Lucy: No, no. You know what I mean. You're a \r\nwild woman, and I love that about you. But Mom -- she's just Mom. ",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it's so good -- it's so good to \r\nsee you smiling. I haven't seen that in quite awhile. ",
        "[Cell phone ringing] ",
        "Lucy: Maybe that's her. ",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, tell her to get herself \r\ndown here before both of us expire from lack of nourishment. ",
        "Lucy: Hello? ",
        "Aaron: Lucy -- look, it's me. Don't hang up.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Aaron? ",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Look, I'm sorry to call you, \r\nokay, but you have to make it to Metro as soon as possible. It's your dad. He's \r\nin a bad way. ",
        "",
        "Dusty: Did you finish the inventory? \r\n",
        "Aaron: No, I'm sorry, Dusty. ",
        "Dusty: Don't say \"sorry.\" \"Sorry\" is for \r\nlosers. ",
        "Aaron: Look, I tried, okay? But your \r\npartner's camped out in the supply room. He's not letting anybody in. \r\n",
        "Dusty: My partner, Craig? ",
        "Aaron: He's got his cot. He's got his \r\nbriefcase, his suitcase. ",
        "Dusty: He's sleeping down there? ",
        "Aaron: Sleeping? Dusty, I think he's living \r\nthere. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey. Came over as soon as I got your \r\nmessage. What's -- you here by yourself? ",
        "Carly: Cabot's asleep in the bedroom. \r\n",
        "Jack: He's Jordan Sinclair\u2019s son? You're sure \r\nof that? ",
        "Carly: Rosanna had the DNA test done. \r\nJordan's the father. ",
        "Jack: What're the odds of that? She adopts a \r\nkid in Canada, gets married to this guy she hardly even knows, and they end up \r\nrelated? ",
        "Carly: Well -- she's not happy about it. \r\nThat's for sure. But I guess it makes sense. Considering that part of the deal \r\nwas that Rosanna had to marry Jordan in order to get Cabot back. ",
        "Jack: \"Part of the deal\"? ",
        "Carly: Jack -- I haven't exactly told you \r\neverything. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. I figured your sister had \r\nsworn you to secrecy. ",
        "Carly: You knew? ",
        "Jack: What was that for? ",
        "Carly: Well, I've been going crazy about \r\nlying to you, and you knew? ",
        "Jack: Oh, so you're mad at me for not being \r\nmad at you? ",
        "Carly: You're not? ",
        "Jack: Carly, she's your sister. He's her kid. \r\nOr a kid she's in love with. What're you gonna do? All right, fine. Tell me \r\neverything you know, and I might just forgive you. ",
        "",
        "Judge: I'm approving this agreement. \r\n",
        "Rosanna: You mean, I have sole custody?\r\n",
        "Attorney: Pending Mr. Sinclair's signature.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, don't sign that! Not until \r\nyou know the truth. You don't know what you're signing. ",
        "Jordan: No, no, Jen, it's all right. The \r\njudge nullified the original agreement. As soon as I sign this, I'm gonna be \r\nfree and clear. Rosanna will be the only parent. ",
        "Jennifer: No, but that's just it. She's not \r\nthe only parent. ",
        "Paul: Jennifer, this is exactly what you and \r\nJordan wanted all along. ",
        "Jennifer: No, she doesn't care about Jordan. \r\nAll she cares about is getting sole custody of Cabot. You have no right to him!\r\n",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, the judge is waiting. \r\n",
        "Jennifer: She's lying to you. Look -- she \r\ndidn't want you to see that. ",
        "Jordan: What is it? ",
        "Rosanna: Jennifer, please. ",
        "Jennifer: You are the most self-centered \r\nperson. You won't even trust the man who turned his life upside-down to help \r\nyou. ",
        "Jordan: This is a laboratory report. These \r\nare DNA results. ",
        "Jennifer: She did a paternity test on Cabot \r\nand his father. ",
        "Jordan: So you know who the father is. Who is \r\nit? ",
        "Rosanna: Look -- after you and I were married \r\nand after Cabot was back with me, there were rumors that started circulating. \r\nAnd I didn't know if they were true. I couldn't be sure. And I couldn't tell \r\nanybody until I was sure. So I had a test done. ",
        "Jordan: Well, whoever you suspected obviously \r\nagreed to it, so who was it? ",
        "Rosanna: He wasn't aware of the situation. \r\nBut he had made it perfectly clear he wanted to move on with his life. So I just \r\ntook him at his word. ",
        "Jennifer: Because it suited you. She lied to \r\nyou, Jordan, and after you sacrificed everything to help her. You are the most \r\nselfish, unethical -- ",
        "Paul: Jennifer, don\u2019t. ",
        "Jordan: Look, I don't understand. Who is the \r\nfather? ",
        "Jennifer: It's you. You are Cabot\u2019s father. \r\nAnd she wasn't going to tell you. ",
        "",
        "Kim: Ali, honey, I'm so sorry if you felt \r\npressured. If you weren't ready to share your work with us, you just -- \r\n",
        "Alison: I'm not taking a ceramics class. I \r\ndon't even know a pot from a pan. I just said that I was taking a class because \r\nI needed an excuse to get out of the house. ",
        "Kim: I don't understand. ",
        "Nancy: Why don't we let the kids talk? I'll \r\nfill in the blanks. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. It was just a little fib. \r\nBut it kept getting bigger and bigger, and I didn't know how to tell you. \r\n",
        "Chris: That you needed to get out of the \r\nhouse? ",
        "Alison: No! No, it's fine here. It's your \r\nhome, and it's great when we're together. ",
        "Chris: So this is about me working nights?\r\n",
        "Alison: No, this -- is about me working \r\nnights. ",
        "Chris: But I got you the job at the clinic, \r\nAlison. You didn't want it. ",
        "Alison: That's because I already have a job \r\n-- at Metro. I never stopped working there. ",

        "Lucy: What's this about my father? \r\n",
        "Aaron: Lucy. I'm -- I'm so sorry. I didn't \r\nknow who else to call. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's fine. Just tell me what's \r\ngoing on. ",
        "Craig: I am part owner of this part dump.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey, hey. Easy, cheetah. This \r\nisn't some flophouse. You understand? I'm running a business here, remember?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Daddy? ",
        "Craig: Ah, sweetness, what are you doing \r\nhere, huh? ",
        "Lucy: What happened to you? No, never -- \r\nnever mind. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. I just wanted to let you know \r\nthat I -- I'm leaving town with Mom right after graduation. ",
        "",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you look wonderful! You look \r\nwonderful. It's so good to see you. ",
        "Sierra: It's good to be here. Where's Lucy?\r\n",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, sit down. Lucy got a call \r\nabout her father, so she went dashing off to save the day. I could really wring \r\nCraig\u2019s neck. Just when the child gets the gumption to strike out for \r\nindependence, he pulls another one of his stunts. ",
        "Sierra: Well, I fell for his stunts more than \r\ntwice. ",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but, dear, you were a grown \r\nwoman. She's a little girl. ",
        "Sierra: She's not so little anymore. I think, \r\nfrom what she's told me on the phone, that she has a very clear view of the \r\nsituation. ",
        "Lucinda: Darling, call her. I mean, call her. \r\nAll she was doing was talking about you, you, you, until Craig intervened.\r\n",
        "Sierra: I will call her. In a minute. You \r\nknow, actually, I'm grateful to have a second to chat with you alone first.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: How wonderful. What about? \r\n",
        "Sierra: Well, I haven't really spoken to Lucy \r\nabout this, and I -- I hate to catch her off guard. ",

        "Carly: Rosanna was going crazy. She was \r\ndesperate about Cabot, but she wouldn't let me help her unless I promised not to \r\ntell you. ",
        "Jack: I figured. ",
        "Carly: And you're really not mad? ",
        "Jack: Carly, I knew if you weren't telling \r\nme, you had your reasons. ",

        "Carly: You could surprise me tonight. \r\n",
        "Jack: Mm. You know I will. ",
        "Carly: Mm, and just for the record, I didn't \r\nactually lie to you. I just withheld information. ",
        "Jack: Listen, I understand that you have to \r\nrespect your sister's privacy. But, you know, when her problems cross the line, \r\nthat's when you and I have to have a little talk. What? ",
        "Carly: I think we've crossed that line, Jack. \r\nI know who's been pulling the strings behind this weird arrangement with Cabot. \r\nJames Stenbeck. ",
        "Jack: No wonder you were scared to open the \r\ndoor. Stenbeck -- are you sure? ",
        "Carly: And then he double-crossed her. And \r\nRosanna\u2019s terrified. ",
        "Jack: How terrified? You think she'll grab \r\nCabot and run? ",
        "",
        "Jordan: No, this is -- this is impossible. I \r\ncouldn't have fathered a child. Because of what happened to me, growing up in an \r\norphanage, I always took every precaution -- ",
        "Rosanna: Well, now, Jordan, sometimes our \r\nplans fail us, despite our best intentions. Nobody's blaming you. You weren't \r\naware of the situation. I certainly wasn\u2019t. And, in fact, when these rumors \r\nsurfaced, I -- I thought it was a lie. ",
        "Jordan: But you insisted on running a test?\r\n",
        "Rosanna: Well, of course. Of course I did. I \r\ncouldn't let anybody derail the adoption. I wanted proof. The truth didn't come \r\nout until this morning. And, quite frankly, given your feelings on the subject, \r\nI didn't think that it mattered. ",
        "Jennifer: His feelings? What do you know \r\nabout his feelings? ",
        "Rosanna: He made them very clear, Jennifer. \r\nHe wanted to be free so that he could be with you. ",
        "Paul: Judge is waiting. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, he can keep on waiting, \r\nbecause Jordan needs time to think about this. ",

        "Paul: Jennifer, don't make this worse than \r\nyou already have. ",
        "Jennifer: She was going to let him sign his \r\nrights away without ever knowing that he had a living, breathing child. How much \r\nworse could it get? ",

        "Alison: I know! And I know that was the wrong \r\nthing to do. I should have just told you, \"too bad, Chris. I'm gonna work there, \r\nanyway.\" But I didn't want you to get mad, so I lied. But I only did that \r\nbecause I knew that that was the fastest way that I could make that money back \r\nfor you that you lost. ",
        "Chris: But I told you that wasn't necessary.\r\n",
        "Alison: Chris, just because you tell me \r\nsomething doesn't mean that that's how I feel, okay? I just want your mother to \r\nthink that I was good enough for you. ",

        "Alison: No, I'm not! And I've got everyone I \r\nknow covering up for me. Even your grandmother. And she's out on the town, \r\nbuying plates. And so is Aaron.

        "Rosanna: That's just it, Jordan. Cabot was \r\nyours. Ever since we got back from Las Vegas and we found out that both of our \r\nnames were on the custody agreement, Cabot was yours. And you wanted no part of \r\nhim. ",
        "Jordan: But that was because -- I assumed \r\nthat we were going to get an annulment and that you wanted full custody. \r\n",

        "Rosanna: The birth mother? The name on the \r\npapers, I think, was Jane Currier. ",

And \r\nI'm not the type of person who just, you know, would meet someone and -- I mean, \r\nwell, obviously, it had to have happened within the last year, year and a half. \r\nI did do some traveling in the past year, but -- for business, but -- \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Don't torture yourself, okay? Look \r\n-- for whatever reason, she decided not to notify you. Who knows? I mean, maybe \r\nbecause she didn't want Cabot to be a burden on you. Or maybe because she wanted \r\nto know that Cabot was gonna go to a home where he would be loved \r\nunconditionally, as he is by me. ",
