        "Luke: Couldn't Coyle pick a nice, quiet place to meet us?",
        "Noah: I know. It's so James Bond, right? You'd think the guy was with the CIA, not the state department. Is this the right corner?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Noah: Thanks for coming. I'm really, really glad you tracked me down.",
        "Luke: Of course. And New York is great. Find Ameera and get out of here.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, I think Coyle will help with that.",
        "Luke: I'm not so sure about that. He seems to think that Ameera ran off on her own.",
        "Noah: She didn't. My dad took her.",
        "Luke: I know, but if he did, they could both be long gone by now.",
        "Noah: I don't think so.",
        "Luke: Noah, he has all that military training. Plus he's an escaped convict. Don't you think that he'd want to be as far off the grid as humanly possible?",
        "Noah: Yeah, but there's another way he can go, and that's to hide in plain sight. You know, just stay here until he can score enough money to leave the country.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but why would he take Ameera, then? Wouldn't she just be another headache for him?",
        "Noah: Wherever they are, I really hope she's still just playing along with him.",
        "Luke: You think he'd hurt her?",
        "Noah: To protect himself? Luke, I think he'd hurt whoever got in his way.",

        "Colonel Mayer: Ameera? Ameera, wake up. Can you open your eyes? Come on. I made you some tea. Sit up. That's it. Come on, sit up.",
        "Ameera: I'm so sleepy.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Yeah, you're coming down with something. You feel warm. Now, drink this. You'll feel better. Come on, sit up. I hope it's not too hot.",
        "Ameera: Mmm. It's -- it's just right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Are you sure this is the right intersection?",
        "Luke: I'll double check. Wait for me?",
        "Noah: Always.",

        "Sailor Sam: I have a message from Coyle.",
        "Noah: What? Coyle was here? When?",
        "Sailor Sam: Do you want to hear the message or not?",
        "Noah: Yes, I'm sorry. What did he say?",
        "Sailor Sam: I'll tell you, but first, you got to ditch your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey. My clothes were kind of wrinkled, so I rinsed them out and put them in the dryer. I hope its okay that I borrowed a shirt.",
        "Aaron: Sure. Coffee?",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Did you sleep okay?",
        "Alison: No, I've been up for a while. Didn't really want to leave yet.",
        "Aaron: Trying to ditch school?",
        "Alison: No, nursing school I really like. I mean, I passed my exam. Not by much, but I at least I passed.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you don't want to see Chris.",
        "Alison: I don't want to think about him for a while.",
        "Aaron: Okay. So, then, why don't you help me make a late, late, late breakfast?",
        "Alison: But you can't cook. And I really can't cook.",

        "Meg: It's good to be back. Oh, you don't look too good.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I was a real jerk to Alison yesterday. I should been more patient with her, but I lost it, shot off my mouth.",
        "Meg: Oh. That's too bad. Hope it works out.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I need to apologize. I don't suppose you've seen her around.",

        "Chris: But you have seen her? Meg?",

        "Alison: Wow, that was almost edible.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, and I got my cardio digging the shells out of your scrambled eggs.",
        "Alison: Well, I got my 32 ounces of water from your runny pancakes. Thanks for doing this. And for last night.",
        "Aaron: I didn't do anything.",
        "Alison: Which was exactly what I needed.",
        "Chris: Were you ever gonna tell me, Alison? Or was I just supposed to figure it out on my own?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, you're here.",
        "Mike: I guess you had to work late.",
        "Meg: I can't find my dress. I had it right here in my locker in a garment bag when I started my shift, and it's gone.",
        "Mike: Well, have you looked in all the other lockers?",
        "Meg: I looked everywhere! Who would take a dress that didn't belong to them? And I was so looking forward to tonight.",
        "Mike: So I'll drive you out to the farm.",
        "Meg: No, no. By the time we get there, I change, I drive back -- you know, whoever did this, I'm gonna wring their neck.",
        "Mike: You could do that. Or you could let me do what I do best.",
        "Meg: And what are you gonna do, Mr. Construction man? Build me a dress?",
        "Mike: A man's got to do what a man's got to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How is that? What? What is this?",
        "Sofie: You and Paul have been so wonderful doing all this for me.",
        "Barbara: It is our pleasure. Now, you listen -- the room is all set. And now we have to take care of you.",
        "Sofie: Keycard?",
        "Barbara: A 21st century version of my magic wand. You go up to my suite. There's a stylist waiting there for you. Hair and makeup -- whatever you need.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I did not expect --",
        "Barbara: You, my little Cinderella, are gonna look spectacular tonight.",
        "Sofie: All I need is a prince.",
        "Stylist: I guarantee you'll turn heads tonight.",
        "Sofie: There's only one guy that I want to impress.",
        "Paul: He's a lucky guy.",
        "Sofie: I was hoping you'd say that. Help me with my dress?",
        "Paul: Beautiful.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Barbara: Hi. Have your cufflinks on?",
        "Paul: Yes, I do. I have my Sofie Duran originals on.",

        "Barbara: Sofie?",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm not going in there with you.",
        "Mike: But it is a simple solution. I'll buy you a dress at Fashions, and we'll be right on time for the party.",
        "Meg: Great idea, except the part where you buy me the dress.",
        "Mike: Oh, you can pick it out. I'll just pay for it.",
        "Meg: Look, I only go into Fashions when there's a sale.",
        "Mike: I can't hear you.",
        "Meg: Why are you doing this?",
        "Mike: Because it's fun, Meg. Come on. Have a little fun with me tonight.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh, you're not planning on making a scene tonight, are you?",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mom. Do you ever plan to make a scene? It's something that just kind of happens.",
        "Barbara: Okay, what's going to happen when Meg shows up with Mike?",
        "Paul: I don't know. We'll see.",
        "Barbara: This night is very important to Sofie.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it's very important to me, too. I stand to make a great, big profit.",
        "Barbara: The biggest profit will be if there's a great deal of success that comes Sofie's way so she stops fixating on you. Now you have to be very careful tonight. Make sure you don't do or say anything around Meg that you'll regret. Could end up being a win win night for you.",
        "Paul: Well, you know me. I do love to win.",
        "Sofie: Oh, oh, I'm -- I'm -- sorry.",
        "Paul: Uh, yeah. Uh, my mom's real busy with the -- with the caterer and she -- she asked me to get the price list. And I'm really sorry.",
        "Sofie: It's all right. It's all right. Um, Paul, could you -- could you do me a favor? Could you, uh, help me with my dress? Zip me up?",
        "Paul: One second. There you go.",
        "Sofie: How do I look?",
        "Paul: You look absolutely beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Uh, wow. Wow, let's get it.",
        "Meg: Excuse me. How much is this?",
        "Mike: Ring this up.",
        "Meg: Wait a second. I need to know how much it is so I can pay you back.",
        "Mike: It's a gift, Meg.",
        "Meg: How much?",
        "Mike: It doesn't matter. If it makes you feel any better, you can donate it to charity after the party, but tonight, I get to enjoy showing up in public with the most beautiful woman in Oakdale. Deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Paul: What for? Have you seen -- that's the price list, yeah?",
        "Sofie: For the dress. You bought it for me.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Sofie. I wasn't even there when you chose it. It's a business expense.",
        "Sofie: It still meant a lot to me. Paul, this is the most important night of my life, and it's all because of you.",
        "Paul: No, it's all because of my mother. It was her idea to back your jewelry line. I'm just -- I'm just an investor.",
        "Sofie: You believe in me, though, right?",
        "Paul: Yes, I do. I really do. Of course. Should we get going? Hey. You all right?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. My hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why did you come here, Chris?",
        "Chris: I'd like to speak to Alison alone.",
        "Aaron: Not a chance.",
        "Alison: Just say what you came to say.",
        "Chris: Just tell me why. I mean, why? You -- you willingly come over to my place, you lead me on, and then run out, you end up over here? If this is the guy you want, fine, but why -- why mess with my head?",
        "Aaron: You want me to kick him out?",
        "Alison: No, I want to -- I want to finish this. You're right. Aaron was here for me last night. But that was just last night. Over the last few days, I've been with, oh, at least 85 guys. Total strangers, and with cameras rolling! Just like you said. So why is it, Chris, that you are the only person I cannot sleep with?",
        "Aaron: Alison --",
        "Alison: No, no, no. If Chris wants to think I'm a slut, I am fine with that. I do not give a damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Excuse us. Hi.",
        "Barbara: Hi. So, how do I look?",
        "Paul: You look radiant.",
        "Barbara: Well, thank you very much, but the stylist said I looked pale.",
        "Sofie: Well, then the stylist is blind because you're gorgeous.",
        "Barbara: Oh, thank you, Honey. And look at you. Look at your jewels with your dress. They're prefect. My, don't you think the jewels look eye-catching? Paul? Paul?",
        "Paul: She looks incredible.",
        "Barbara: Well, I, um, don't think we should wait any longer. I think you need to introduce Sofie.",
        "Paul: You're right. Uh, excuse me. Hi. I just want to welcome all of you, and I'm hoping that you've had a chance to glimpse at the work of a talented young artist. And I'm sure you agree with me that it's all very innovative and distinctive work, and yet it remains classic and timeless. But the lady herself is simply a star. And it's an honor to introduce Miss Sofie Duran.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Sofie: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Paul: I'm glad you two made it.",
        "Meg: Well, we almost didn't.",
        "Paul: Champagne?",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Paul: And when you're done with that, there's more champagne and hors d'oeuvres and even more jewelry in the other room. Enjoy.",
        "Mike: We will.",
        "Paul: You look great. That's a nice dress. It's new?",
        "Meg: Very.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Hey, explain. Why should I ditch Luke?",
        "Sailor Sam: That's the only way Coyle will meet you.",
        "Noah: How do I know this is for real?",
        "Sailor Sam: Your wife's missing, right?",
        "Noah: How do you who Coyle is?",
        "Sailor Sam: Just go to the corner of Greenwich and Chambers. But go alone, or the deal's off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: If you're feverish, you should rest.",
        "Ameera: Okay. Just for a little while.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Colonel Mayer: Yeah. Are we set? Don't worry about my son. I'll take care of him. I know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Were you just talking to that guy?",
        "Noah: Oh, more like he was talking to me. New York's pretty crazy, you know? Did you find Coyle?",
        "Luke: Uh, no. No sign of him. But I'm sure this is the right spot. Maybe he got hung up somewhere.",
        "Noah: Well, maybe we should try you staying here and, you know, I'll walk around. Maybe he wants to talk to you alone.",
        "Luke: Why would he want to do that?",
        "Noah: You know, it's worth a try. We'll see what happens. You know, give me a call if he comes.",
        "Luke: Noah, what's going on?",
        "Noah: All right. Worrying about Ameera, it's getting to me. And I know it sounds silly, but I feel like if I'm walking around, at least I'm doing something.",
        "Luke: Well, then, I'll go with you.",
        "Noah: Just give me some space.",
        "Luke: Okay, fine. I will, as long as you tell me what that guy said to you.",
        "Noah: He was delivering a message from Coyle. He said I have go downtown and meet Coyle alone or he won't show up at all.",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds like a setup.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, we're here to find Ameera. And if that's the only way to do it --",
        "Luke: Okay. Fine. Go ahead and meet Coyle. But I'm not letting you out of my sight.",
        "Noah: You can't go with me. Coyle's instructions were clear on that.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but if I go with you, then we can find them together.",
        "Noah: If you go with me, Coyle won't come anywhere us. And where will that leave Ameera?",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, if you go by yourself, something bad could happen to you. You could get hurt, and I couldn't live with myself if that happened.",
        "Noah: I'll be careful. I promise.",
        "Luke: Careful is not gonna do anything against a gun.",
        "Noah: Okay. Why don't we do this -- I'll text you if there's even a hint of danger.",
        "Luke: Text me? And then what? You'll wait for like half an hour while I get a subway or find a cab to come down and stage my brilliant rescue?",
        "Noah: You have to let me do this my way. You have to trust me. I won't let anything happen to me, okay? I love you too much.",
        "Luke: Okay, fine. Fine. Go. But text me at the first sign of trouble, okay?",
        "Noah: I will. And I'll see you back here, hopefully with Ameera.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: What took you so long?",
        "Noah: Dad?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Come on, let's go. Come on.",
        "Luke: Ameera?",
        "Ameera: Luke.",
        "Luke: What happened? Are you all right?",
        "Ameera: Where's Noah?",
        "Luke: Just first, tell me how you got here.",
        "Ameera: I don't know. I don't know where I am.",
        "Luke: You're in New York. Look, did Colonel Mayer do something to you? Did he bring you here?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You should never have come to New York, Noah.",
        "Noah: Yeah, and you should never have escaped from prison, but here we are. Where's Ameera?",
        "Colonel Mayer: She's safe.",
        "Noah: So take me to her.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You don't have to worry about Ameera, Noah. She's like a daughter to me. I'd never hurt her.",
        "Noah: Oh, even if that's true, you ran from the cops. How can she possibly -- how can you escape from the police with Ameera slowing you down?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Things are already in place. I'm gonna get as far away from here as I possibly can, and I'm taking Ameera with me.",
        "Noah: Wait a minute. You can't do that. The police will think that she helped you escape from prison. She'll be like an accomplice to a crime she had nothing to do with.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'll take good care of Ameera like I always have. And once I'm gone, once we're gone, you're free, Noah. You'll never see or hear from me ever again.",
        "Noah: Wait, if you really care about Ameera, you won't force her to become a fugitive for the rest of her life. I mean, how can she possibly help you?",
        "Colonel Mayer: It's a price I have to pay for my freedom.",
        "Noah: What? I don't understand.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I know you don't. And that's why I'm telling you, leave us alone.",
        "Noah: And if I don't?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Are you gonna stand in my way, Noah? I'm a soldier, and you're --",
        "Noah: Right. I'm weak. I'm nothing. That's what you think gay means.",
        "Coyle: Oh, no. Stop with the word games, Noah. Let's tell the truth. The truth is, you're not man enough to stop me. So don't even try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Nice to see you here.",
        "Meg: Well, I'm glad I came. You know, I did have my doubts at first, but I'm having a really nice time.",
        "Barbara: Good. And is Mike? I mean, he and my son don't exactly get along.",
        "Meg: Well, actually, Paul was the one who insisted on Mike and I coming together.",
        "Barbara: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah. A nice gesture, actually. A way to thank me for lifting the restraining order.",
        "Barbara: Which I appreciate as well.",
        "Meg: I have no regrets. Seeing him here, it's like he's a different person.",
        "Barbara: Yes, my son behaving himself is quite a shock, isn't it? And what about you and Mike? Is it serious?",
        "Meg: No, we're just friends. Good friends. Excuse me, Barbara. Hey.",
        "Mike: Hey. There's an emergency at the construction site. I have to go.",
        "Meg: Is it serious?",
        "Mike: Not if I take care of it right now. Do you want me to drive you home?",
        "Meg: No, no. I'd like to stay a little bit longer, show off this nice dress. I'll take a cab later.",
        "Mike: Okay, so it was a good thing that I made you get that dress?",
        "Meg: Absolutely. You promised we'd have fun and we did.",
        "Mike: I'll see you.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Did Mike have to leave?",
        "Meg: Yeah, it was a business thing.",
        "Paul: Oh. But you're gonna stay?",
        "Meg: I haven't seen all the jewelry yet.",
        "Paul: No? Well, then, I hope you will allow me to be your own personal jewelry tour guide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Just explain things to me. Tell me why you led me on.",
        "Aaron: She doesn't have to explain anything to you.",
        "Chris: I helped you because I cared. This is how you pay me back?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. Guess you're gonna have to find another charity case. I'm obviously not what you want.",
        "Chris: Obviously.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So, how do you think it's going?",
        "Meg: I think everybody loves Sofie's work.",
        "Barbara: Good.",
        "Paul: I think you've done a great job, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Meg: Yes, you have. But there is a limit. How are you doing, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Truth be told, I'm wiped out. I'm absolutely exhausted and I don't feel very --",
        "Paul: You want me to call someone?",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. I'm fine. I just think I need to take my meds.",
        "Meg: You know what? I'll help you with that.",
        "Barbara: Would you?",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course. Let's go upstairs.",
        "Barbara: Great. Thank you. And you, you keep this party going and keep an eye on Sofie, okay? And fix your collar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Try and get some sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, thanks, Meg. Thanks for everything.",

        "Barbara: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Hey. Is my mom okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah, she's fine. She just wore herself out. She'll be fast asleep before her head hits the pillow.",
        "Paul: I'm thinking something silly.",
        "Meg: Well, that's not like you. You have devious thoughts, sinister thoughts, but rarely silly.",
        "Paul: So, do you think my mom is plotting to get you and me alone?",
        "Meg: I could see how you would think that, but we're not alone. Barbara's just in the next room.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. Good point.",
        "Meg: And she didn't ask you to come up here with us. You followed on your own.",
        "Paul: Right, another good point. You got me there.",
        "Meg: Should you be getting back downstairs?",
        "Paul: I'm thinking something else.",
        "Meg: Another silly thought?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me. I was thinking about how nice it would be to kiss you. Unless you think it's a bad idea.",
        "Paul: We should get downstairs.",
        "Meg: You're not pushing it. That's a first.",
        "Paul: You know, Meg, if you give me a chance, I'm full of surprises.",
        "Paul: Would you like another glass of champagne?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I can get it myself. You have guests to tend to.",
        "Paul: You're the only one I care about. But you're right. I have a job to do.",

        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Sofie: Hi. I've been looking all over for you. Where's -- where's Barbara?",
        "Paul: She was feeling a little tired.",
        "Sofie: Oh, so you were with her?",
        "Paul: You know, I think it's time for you said a few words.",
        "Sofie: No, no. I don't have to.",
        "Paul: Yes, you do. And don't worry about it. You know, all these people, they're already half in love with you and your work. Uh, hi. Sorry to interrupt. If I could have your attention, I'd like to once again introduce the lovely and talented Sofie Duran.",

        "Aaron: How are you doing?",
        "Alison: Oh, I ran, but I couldn't hide.",
        "Aaron: Chris was pretty rough on you. Why didn't you set him straight?",
        "Alison: Why bother? Chris looks at me and he sees what he expects to see.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but if you explained --",
        "Alison: No, waste of time. And you know why? Even when he was defending me to his parents, deep down I always knew he thought that I was less than him. Not good enough.",
        "Aaron: Well, if he treats you that way, then you don't need him.",
        "Alison: You're right. I'm better off without him.",

        "Luke: Ameera, wait!",
        "Ameera: I have to find Noah. The Colonel left, and I tried to follow him, but I don't know where he went.",
        "Luke: First, tell me why the Colonel brought you here. What is he planning?",
        "Ameera: He said he needed my help.",
        "Luke: And you went with him? Just like that? Ameera, he just broke out of prison.",
        "Ameera: Luke, I owed him for everything he did for my family and for myself. But we have to find Noah. Something's really wrong. The Colonel said that --",
        "Luke: What, what, what? What did he say about Noah?",
        "Ameera: Maybe I misunderstood. I must have misunderstood.",
        "Luke: What's going on? You're acting really strange.",
        "Ameera: The Colonel drugged my tea to make me sleep.",
        "Luke: He drugged your tea. Why?",
        "Ameera: I don't know. But when I found out, I stopped drinking it. And I heard him on the phone when he thought I was passed out. He said something about delivering me to someone. I don't know. I can't think.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, try to remember. What else did he say?",
        "Ameera: Um, something -- something about travel papers, maybe for both of us. I don't know.",
        "Luke: And what did he say about Noah?",
        "Ameera: He knows Noah is here. He told whoever was on the phone he had to get him out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Ameera can't help you. All she can do is slow you down. You've got to let her go.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Negative. Plans are already in the works. They can't be changed.",
        "Noah: Who do you have plans with? And what do they have to do with Ameera?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Stay out of it. Take your fairy friend and get back to Oakdale.",
        "Noah: Luke and I aren't going anywhere. Not without Ameera.",

        "Ameera: Are you texting Noah? Are you telling him to come here?",
        "Luke: Noah, come on.",
        "Ameera: What's wrong?",
        "Luke: He's not answering. He must be in trouble. And I don't even know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: My whole life you pushed me to be tough, to fight for what I want. So believe me when I say this, Dad. I will do everything in my power to keep you from messing up Ameera's life. If you don't believe me when I say that, then you don't know what kind of man you raised.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Don't you dare go against me, Boy.",
        "Noah: Where's Ameera? Tell me where she is!",
        "Colonel Mayer: She's where you will never find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: We have to find Noah.",
        "Luke: He would have called. If he was all right, he would have called.",
        "Ameera: What can we do?",
        "Luke: We have to go to the police.",
        "Ameera: No. The police will send me back.",
        "Luke: You're technically still married to Noah. They can't do anything.",
        "Ameera: But if they think I was involved in Colonel Mayer's disappearance --",
        "Luke: Look, Ameera, we have to do this. It's the only way to help Noah. It's the only way to keep you safe. We don't know where Noah's dad is, but we've got to find him.",
        "Ameera: I won't do it. I won't go to the police.",
        "Luke: Excuse me, Officer. Fight me, and we'll both end up in jail. And then how will we help Noah?",
        "Officer: What's the problem?",
        "Luke: My friend needs help.",
        "Luke: Noah! I was so worried about you.",
        "Noah: My phone kept dying --",
        "Luke: Where were you?",
        "Noah: I saw my dad.",
        "Luke: Where is he?",
        "Noah: He got away. He said he would take care of Ameera, that she'd be safe, but I don't believe him. Luke, we've got to find her and get her away from him.",
        "Luke: I already found her.",
        "Noah: Where?",
        "Luke: Your dad was drugging her to keep her with him, but she realized and ran away.",
        "Noah: That's good. That's great. Well, why isn't she with you?",
        "Luke: I was so worried about you. I -- I thought we should go to the police. Ameera's in police custody.",

        "Meg: Well, thank you for inviting me.",
        "Paul: I'm glad you came. Can I give you a ride home?",

        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: Wait. You're not gonna press the issue?",

        "Meg: Good night, Paul. I really had a nice time.",
        "Paul: So did I. Good night.",
        "Sofie: That was incredible. I've never had so much attention in my life.",
        "Paul: Sofie, you deserve every wonderful word they're saying about you.",
        "Sofie: Thank you. I'll drink to that. But only if you're doing the buying.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm gonna have to take a rain check. I really got to head home. I got a -- well, we have a very busy day tomorrow.",

        "Noah: You know how scared Ameera is of being sent back to Iraq. And you turn her over to the police?",
        "Luke: Your dad was drugging her, Noah. Who knows what he would he would have done? He could have killed her or used her as some sort of bargaining chip. I thought she needed protection.",
        "Noah: You shouldn't have let her out of your sight.",
        "Luke: What about you? What did your dad do to you?",
        "Noah: I'm fine, okay? We have to find Ameera.",

        "Aaron: Good.",
        "Alison: You know, watching him walk out, it hit me that nursing is something I want because I want it. It has nothing to do with Chris. I'm gonna be a great nurse no matter what he does.",

        "Brenda: Oh.",
        "Chris: Oh, sorry, Brenda.",
        "Brenda: I was just going over the lab scores. Alison's work is really subpar. The written tests are one thing, but I don't know how I can justify a passing score for the lab work.",
        "Chris: Well, if that's the way it is --",
        "Brenda: Dr. Hughes, are you saying I should drop Alison Stewart from the nursing program?",

        "Aaron: Well, Meg will be glad to help you whenever you need her.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I can study with other people in the class, too. It just -- it feels good to have this whole Chris thing settled. Like the pressure's off and I can finally concentrate on school in a whole new way.",
        "Aaron: I'm so proud of you. You want to hang out later?",
        "Alison: Sounds like a plan.",

        "Chris: You're in charge of the nursing program. It's your call.",
        "Brenda: If it were up to me, I'd fail Alison right now. But you've been so adamant that she should remain in the program.",
        "Chris: You and I gave her a chance, but we can only go so far.",
        "Brenda: So you're not standing up for her anymore.",
        "Chris: You know, it was wrong of me to interfere in the first place. It's your decision to make. Just do what you think is right.",

        "Meg: Uh, I don't know.",
        "Mike: Don't tell me you're too tired. It's still light outside.",
        "Meg: I'm, uh, making a mistake probably, and possibly I'm insane. But at the party earlier, I realized something important. I just can't fight it anymore. I'm still in love with Paul.",

        "Paul: What are you doing here, Sofie?",
