        "Mike: So how's it feel to be back home?",
        "Jennifer: Like a dream.",
        "Mike: Honeymoon was supposed to be a dream. Home's supposed to be the letdown.",
        "Jennifer: No, never. I mean, don't get me wrong. I loved being away with you. Every day was like a dream. But I don't think anything could compare to coming home with my new husband.",
        "Mike: Same place we've lived for months.",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. It's different now, though. It seems cozier, more peaceful.",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: You better enjoy that peace, 'cause a few months, that little bundle of joy is gonna be turning our lives upside down.",
        "Jennifer: Can't you stand a little excitement?",
        "Mike: You know I can. Can you?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, well now, you know I can't pass up a challenge. I'll can still show you some excitement, Mr. Kasnoff.",
        "Mike: Oh, yeah? Me first. Me first.",
        "Jennifer: What? No! Oh, Mike, you're gonna drop me.",
        "Mike: Babe, you're always safe in my arms. Welcome home, Mrs. Kasnoff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come on, Alison. Out with it.",
        "Alison: Out with what?",
        "Henry: Why are you so gung-ho to have me hook up with a woman you don't even know?",
        "Alison: This isn't about me. It's about you. This Ivy chick -- she sent you a letter asking you to join her. It would be totally rude of you to just blow her off.",
        "Henry: Okay. I'll send this \"Ivy chick\" flowers and a letter of apology. But I'm just not interested.",
        "Alison: Because of Katie?",
        "Henry: Brilliant. Give the girl a gold star.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, if you're still hung up on Katie, then what's the big deal? Just pick up a phone and --",
        "Henry: Katie and I are finished, okay?",
        "Alison: Great. Then what's the problem? You could spend some time with Ivy. Just pick up the paper and reclaim your life, Henry. You owe it to yourself. Just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Thank you, thank you. You're the best. It's exactly what I wanted. The most beautiful dress I've ever seen!",
        "Casey: Thanks for the thanks, but I'm serious. I didn't have anything to do with it.",
        "Celia: Yes, you did. Tell me the truth. Your grandmother called you and she told you I wanted it. And you made it happen.",
        "Casey: Celia, as much as I'd like to take the credit for this --",
        "Celia: Did he swear himself to secrecy? Tell me, Will.",
        "Will: I'm staying out of this.",
        "Casey: Well, whoever sent it, I'm just glad to see you're happy.",
        "Gwen: You know, it's gorgeous. You should see her in it.",
        "Celia: I thought things like this only happened in movies, and here I am, and it's happening to me. I just remembered. There's something I have to do. Wait for me here? I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad, I was thinking -- what's up? What do you got?",
        "Holden: I -- I just signed the divorce papers.",
        "Luke: Just like that?",
        "Holden: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.",
        "Luke: It's good to know that signing away your family wasn't just a walk in the park.",
        "Holden: Hey, wait a minute. I didn't sign you away. Look, your mom and I realize that we don't belong together anymore. But that has nothing to do with you or the girls. I will always love you guys.",
        "Luke: Yeah. But when we have to make appointments to see each other, it's not gonna be the same, is it Dad? It'll never be the same again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Keith: Hey, I paid off my debt. Free as a bird. I can do whatever I want. And what I want to do -- I want to be with you.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Les: Ask him about that bee pollen. Ask him why he planted it in my car. Now, he framed me. He set me up.",
        "Lily: You're back so soon.",
        "Keith: I can't stand to be away from you. It's your fault.",
        "Lily: Oh, but I'm not ready. I have things that I have -- I have some things to drink, some things to nibble on.",
        "Keith: I've got you to nibble on. I can't even think about food.",
        "Lily: Wouldn't it be nice to have some music and candlelight?",
        "Keith: No. All I need is you. Nobody's ever done what you've done for me, like this. And it means a lot to me. And I just want to show you how much it means to me.",
        "Lily: No, please, don't.",
        "Keith: What's wrong?",
        "Lily: Ah -- I have this horrible migraine. It's awful. I have pain in the back of neck. My eyes are just killing me.",
        "Keith: Oh. Why didn't you tell me that when I came in?",
        "Lily: Well, I was trying to ignore it, but I can't seem to make it go away. So I'm sorry.",
        "Keith: I didn't know you got migraines.",
        "Lily: Now and then, once in a while. But I just need some time. It will be okay.",
        "Keith: All right, I'll give you a little massage. You know --",
        "Lily: No, it's okay. I just need to go back to my own bed, lie down and pull the shades, dim the lights. And it always makes things a lot better, so I'm just gonna have a couple of aspirin and call you in the morning, okay?",
        "Keith: You know what? You're not a very good liar.",
        "Lily: Why do you think I'm lying?",
        "Keith: Because you just get a headache out of the blue like that? Something has changed between last time I saw you and now. I want to know what it is. You're not going anywhere until you tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So when did you sign the papers?",
        "Holden: Just now. Before you got here.",
        "Luke: And did you sign them because you think it's what mom wanted? Or did you sign them because it's what you wanted?",
        "Holden: There's not an easy answer to that. First, I wanted the divorce and your mother didn't. And now she's pushing for it. And I'm not as sure as I used to be.",
        "Luke: So you thought it was over, but now you feel different? Well, then maybe that's what will happen with Mom. Maybe she'll feel completely different from the way she feels now.",
        "Holden: I don't think so.",
        "Luke: It could happen. I mean, if things changed once, then they could change again. Just give it some time to turn around.",
        "Holden: Luke, you got to know when to let go. Your mom, she's with Keith now. And I'm not about to stand in her way. Especially not after what I put her through with Julia.",
        "Luke: I'm not saying that you should tell her to dump him. I'm saying that you should be patient and maybe she will do it on her own.",
        "Holden: She hasn't given us any hope that that might happen.",
        "Luke: Maybe it won't. But, Dad, this thing with her and Keith -- it happened out of nowhere. And when things happen that fast, it's usually not a good sign that they'll last.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Lily? Honey? Anybody home? Darling? I'm here, and I'm not back to fight with you. I'm here to do an uncharacteristic thing. I'm here to make an apology. Come on out and get it. Where is everybody? [Lucinda scoffs] Okay. $100,000? What in the name of --? Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Katie: It's open.",
        "Henry: Look, Ivy, I don't think this is such a good idea. I'm really sorry.",
        "Katie: You were saying?",
        "Henry: No. This -- this is not happening, okay? Not today. This is not happening any time in the future. No, all right?",
        "Katie: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. If you think I'm gonna let you go, you don't know me as well as you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: To the happy couple, blah, blah, blah.",
        "Jennifer: Whoa, whoa. You can't \"blah\" your way through the card. Who's it from?",
        "Mike: Katie.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe we should start with the smaller ones and work our way up. This looks promising.",
        "Mike: Why not this one?",
        "Jennifer: Well, you know they say the best things come in small packages.",
        "Mike: Something tells me you don't want to open it because it's from Katie. You mad at her?",
        "Jennifer: Mad? No. Confused and a little irritated? Definitely. But you know what? We're having a great time, all right? So let's not ruin a perfectly good day.",
        "Mike: Is it because of what she did at the wedding?",
        "Jennifer: Of course. Mike, I ask her -- I go out of my way to ask her to be my matron of honor, and then the day of, she doesn't call. She leaves me hanging. She comes crashing into the ceremony halfway through. I mean, she should have either shown up when she was supposed to or not come at all. She didn't even have a decent excuse. Traffic -- please.",
        "Mike: You didn't buy that?",
        "Jennifer: No one else was late. And I didn't hear anything about a multi-car pile-up or trees fallen in the road or major construction. And I mean, please. How much traffic could there be? No, I don't buy it. And I doubt you do, either. So in the interest of starting our marriage off on the right foot, maybe you should tell me what the heck was going on with her.",
        "Jennifer: What's the real reason that Katie showed up late to the wedding?",
        "Mike: She wasn't sure that she had any business being there. Or if she even wanted to be there.",
        "Jennifer: She told you that?",
        "Mike: And she also said that she wants us to be happy. And we are. We're married. We have a baby on the way. Your career is on track. We have everything that we wanted. Nothing else matters.",
        "Jennifer: Well, not quite. There is something that I need, Mike. Something that I need from you.",
        "Mike: Anything.",
        "Jennifer: Food. [Laughter] I'm starving for two.",
        "Mike: All right, I'll see what's in the fridge.",
        "Jennifer: No, I threw everything out before we left.",
        "Mike: What would you say to some takeout?",
        "Jennifer: I would say, takeout, I love you. And I love being married to you. And I'm really happy that Katie and Henry are married.",
        "Mike: Why do you say that?",
        "Jennifer: Well, when Katie says that she wants us to be happy, I know that her heart is in the right place. But, I think Henry helps keep it in that place. So as long as they're together, Henry will keep her grounded. And, let's hope that they stay married, because a single Katie is a dangerous Katie.",
        "Mike: Dangerous?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, yeah. The last thing we need is a footloose, fancy free, divorcee on the prowl.",
        "Mike: Well, we don't have to worry about that. Because Katie and Henry are very happy and that's the way they're going to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You can't leave me. I'm lost without you, Henry. Worse than lost. Life's not worth living without you there. I'm yours. I'm your wife. Make love to me, Henry. Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away. You want me. You love me.",
        "Henry: Of course, I love you. I've always loved you. I've always, always wanted you. Always.",
        "Katie: And, there's nothing standing in our way, now. We can make things right, starting now.",
        "Henry: No. No.",
        "Katie: No?",
        "Henry: No. I know it's what you want. I know it's what we both want, okay? But, I -- I just -- I need more than this, Katie.",
        "Katie: Well, whatever you want, it's yours.",
        "Henry: I need more than just your body and a couple of unforgettable hours in bed. I need -- I need your -- honey, I need your heart, and your mind, and your soul. Without those things, this is -- it's worthless, okay? Your heart and soul belong to another man.",
        "Katie: Wait, don't you see what you're doing? You're not giving us the time to grow. We have so much potential, Henry. We haven't even scratched the surface yet. Please do not walk away from this. Don't walk away from our marriage, please. I love you so much.",
        "Henry: If you love me, you'll let me go. Let me go. Let this end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Good news guys, and girls.",
        "Casey: What's up?",
        "Zach: The committee got us access to the Lakeview to put up decorations the night before the prom. Which means we get to pull an all-nighter. You guys up for it?",
        "Casey: Definitely.",
        "Zach: Good. Then, bring your sleeping bags and be ready to get down, and take care of business.",
        "Casey: What about chaperones?",
        "Zach: What about 'em?",
        "Casey: Free and clear?",
        "Zach: If you don't squeal, I won't. You up for it?",
        "Casey: Sign me up, man. And count Celia in, too.",
        "Zach: What about you, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Zach: What about you, Will?",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Zach: Right this way to the sign-up sheet.",
        "Casey: All right, sit tight man, I'll sign you guys up.",
        "Gwen: Did I ever tell you I can read minds?",
        "Will: You think so?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm. And something tells me that you know more about Celia's dress than you're letting on.",
        "Will: Oh, please.",
        "Zach: Come on, Will. You were at Fashions right after we finished trying on the dresses.",
        "Will: Yeah, nice try Miss Cleo. I told you, I was picking Celia up because Casey asked me to.",
        "Gwen: Right. She's a -- she's a lucky girl, you know? A few months after she waltzes into town, not only does she get nominated for prom queen, she gets the dress of a lifetime dropped right into her lap. I wish I had a fairy Godmother looking out for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Celia, there you are.",
        "Celia: Hi, Mrs. Grimaldi.",
        "Lisa: Hey, how are you? What can I do for you?",
        "Celia: It's the dress.",
        "Lisa: Oh. Oh dear. I hope nothing's wrong with it.",
        "Celia: No, it's perfect. Exactly what I wanted.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well that's wonderful.",
        "Celia: I just can't accept it.",
        "Lisa: Oh, yes you can. It's all ready been bought and paid for by your secret admirer, and you said yourself how much you loved it.",
        "Celia: Do you remember my friend -- the girl who came in with me to try on the dresses?",
        "Lisa: Oh yeah, sure I do.",
        "Celia: Well, we're sort of in the same boat, you know? And, we didn't have a lot of money to spend so we promised to help each other put something together that we could afford. And if I have the dress that I want, and she doesn't -- it just doesn't feel right.",
        "Lisa: Oh, honey, that is just one of the sweetest, most unselfish things I have ever heard.",
        "Barbara: And I agree. I'm sorry, honey, I couldn't help but overhear. That's quite a sacrifice you're making.",
        "Lisa: Yes, and for all you know, your friend may want very much for you to wear that dress. This is if she's as good a friend to you as you certainly are to her.",
        "Celia: Well, maybe, but I think I need to stick to my end of the bargain. Besides, I can always come back and find something else for prom, something that's on sale.",
        "Barbara: This friend of yours -- she wouldn't happen to be Will's date, would she? I've been dying to know what this girl is like. If she's as lovely as you are, then I'd be the happiest Mother on the planet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: There's nothing to tell. I just need to go, to be alone. Just for a little while.",
        "Keith: No, no. Wait a second, wait. I'm not gonna let you get away with an excuse like that.",
        "Lily: Please, just let me go. Please.",
        "Keith: You're shaking. Is this because of me?",
        "Lily: No. Of course not.",
        "Keith: What's going on? What did I do?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Nothing's going on. It's just -- it's all too much, that's all. It's just, so much.",
        "Keith: Alright, I'm coming on a little to strong in this situation. And when I paid off vin, all I wanted to do was come back and tell you -- thank you, for you know, having all that faith in me. And I wanted to show you that I'm going to be the guy that you believe I am.",
        "Lily: I gave you that money because I wanted to. The money, it has -- has nothing to do with anything!",
        "Keith: Well, then what has to do with something here? Something is going on.",
        "Lily: Okay. There's bee pollen -- a bottle of it, in your drawer. Why?",
        "Keith: I've taken bee pollen for years.",
        "Lily: For what?",
        "Keith: It's great, you know, to keep my energy up, you know, on those long flights that I had to make. And it's also good for allergies and stuff. Which is ironic, because Julia was allergic to it.",
        "Lily: Yes. Allergic enough to die from it. And Les accused you of planting bee pollen in his car to make him look more guilty.",
        "Keith: I'm gonna ask you a question, Lily. And it's gonna affect the course our lives, here, all right? Now, who do you believe? That bum, Sweeny? Or me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lily: I'm as foolish as you think I am.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, are you beginning to realize?",
        "Katie: Oh Henry, I knew you'd come back. Henry, I \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Of course, I believe you.",
        "Keith: You're sure about that?",
        "Lily: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Keith: I just -- you were just so scared when you asked me about the bottle of bee pollen.",
        "Lily: Well, can you blame me for being curious?",
        "Keith: No. I don't care what anybody else thinks about me, but if -- if I ever thought that you doubted me, it would really upset me.",
        "Lily: I wouldn't be here if I didn't trust you. I guess I'm sorry if you felt that I was grilling you, it was just kind of a surprise, you know, the bee pollen/Julia connection. But I guess people do use bee pollen, ginseng, all kinds of home remedies like that. It's no big deal.",
        "Keith: Well, for centuries people have thought of it as sort of an aphrodisiac.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Keith: Yeah. So I got an idea. Why we don't we dim the lights, get some champagne, and I'll show you what I'm talking about.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: I need to get that.",
        "Keith: Oh, okay.",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I'm so glad I found you.",
        "Lily: So am I.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you may not be after you've heard what I want to say.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Lucinda: I'm here. I'm in your house. Now, I only let myself in because I thought that you were not answering the door because you were still cross about the conversation we had earlier. I came to apologize.",
        "Lily: That's not necessary.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I came over to your desk to write a nice, charming, little note and I found this stub for a cashier's check for a sizeable about of money. Is there some financial emergency?",
        "Lily: No. No emergency.",
        "Lucinda: Well, honey, you know that anything you need, you just come to me.",
        "Lily: I can't really get into that right now, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Why not? Is there something you don't want me to know?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Nothing. Everything is under control. Really.",
        "Lucinda: Lily, you're not fooling me. You're not fooling me for an instant. It's something you don't want to tell me because you think I'm going to disapprove. Honey, I'm not going to do that. I don't want to do that anymore. It's your life, it's your money.",
        "Lily: Well, if you insist, then I will come up and talk to you about it right away.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I'm not insisting that you do anything.",
        "Lily: I'm on my way. I'm sorry. That was my mother, and she wants to talk to me about the kids, and will not take no for an answer, so --",
        "Keith: Oh, okay. Well, then you should go ease your mother. But I'll hang around waiting for you if you're gonna come back. You are coming back?",
        "Lily: Of course, I'll come back. Wish me luck.",
        "Keith: Hey, listen, you know what? I don't think you should mention the bee pollen to your mother. She's already suspicious enough of me, you know, I don't think we need to add fuel to the fire.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm. Okay.",
        "Keith: Okay? All right. And also, you know, I mean I just don't want anybody hating me anymore than they already do, because I plan to be apart of your life for a long, long time.",
        "Lily: I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Luke, your mother is doing what she thinks is gonna make her happy. I haven't been able to make her happy for a very long time.",
        "Luke: You do still love her, don't you?",
        "Holden: Always will.",
        "Luke: Well, then --",
        "Holden: Look -- your mom and I, we will always love each other. We've been together for most of our lives. Sometimes when people are together for as long as we have been together, they grow apart. It's just one of those sad facts of life.",
        "Luke: I just don't get it. I thought you two were --",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know. So did I. That's why it's taking so long to get used to it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, like the rest of my life. I think it's even harder for Faith. What if --",
        "Holden: What if what?",
        "Luke: What if you held off giving the papers to Mom just for awhile? For a week?",
        "Holden: Why? What'd you have in mind?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe you could spend some more time with Faith and Natalie, you know, get them to understand. You don't have to drop the bomb this quick. You know, just seven days, please?",
        "Holden: Okay. One week. But you do realize --",
        "Luke: I know, I know, I know, I know. It's killing me, and I hate it. But I know it's gonna happen whether I like it or not.",

        "Mike: Hey, Henry. What's up, man? Whoa. I haven't seen you in awhile, man. We've been on the honeymoon.",
        "Henry: That's great.",
        "Mike: What's up? Is everything okay?",
        "Henry: Couldn't be worse if I had the plague, Mike. But thank you for asking, really.",
        "Mike: What's the problem?",
        "Henry: I don't know, my marriage is circling the drain to begin with.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Henry: Why? You have the nerve to ask me why? I worship the air that she breathes, my life began when we got married, and Katie is still madly in love with you, Mike!",
        "Mike: Henry, Katie and I have been over a long time.",
        "Henry: Are you saying that to convince me or to convince yourself? She's in room 707. She's all yours.",

        "Mike: I ran into Henry downstairs.",
        "Katie: What did he say?",
        "Mike: He said you two are in trouble. He said the marriage was over. I know how Henry exaggerates, so I --",
        "Katie: No, no. No exaggeration here. He left me. He left me.",
        "Mike: What happened?",
        "Katie: You. He knows that I still love you. Even though I'm trying so hard not to, because it's wrong. Mike, I know it's wrong and I have to stop. And, you know what? If there was a pill or a patch or something, I would be the first in line for it. 'Cause the last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt Henry or our marriage.",
        "Mike: Well, then you have to make him understand that.",
        "Katie: I've tried. But your wedding was the last straw. And I don't blame him. I should have just stayed away. I should have stayed with Henry and gotten on that plane. We were on our way to Hawaii.",
        "Mike: I asked you after the wedding, and you sort of avoided the issue --",
        "Katie: Asked me what?",
        "Mike: Well, when you showed up late to the ceremony --",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about that.",
        "Mike: No, no, no. I need to know this. Were you -- were you going to try to stop us from getting married?",
        "Katie: Honestly? The thought crossed my mind a couple hundred times. But what I told you that day was the truth. I know how much you love Jennifer -- how happy she makes you, and happy you make her, and how much she needs you. I know that because I know what it's like to be loved by you, to want to wake up next to you in the morning, to have you by my side when I go to bed at night. And however much I love Henry, I can't forget what you and I were. How much fun we had and the plans we made. How much we meant to each other. I know it's too late for us. I know that now. But -- man, it just feels like nothing is ever going to go right for me again.",
        "Mike: Oh, Katie, I --",
        "Katie: No, no, no. Don't, I'm fine. I'm fine. You need to go home. I'm sure Jennifer's waiting for you. I will be all right.",
        "Mike: Are you sure?",
        "Katie: No. Go home. That's where you belong.",

        "Celia: Anyways, about the dress -- if my friend can't afford the one that she wants, then I won't be happy wearing this one. And I can always come back and look for something on sale.",
        "Lisa: No, that's absolutely out of the question. Now look, this is against my policy, but I think sometimes rules are made to be broken. And I think especially in this circumstance. How would it be if I loaned your friend the dress that she likes? That way you can keep this dress. You will both be the belles of the ball.",
        "Celia: You'd really do that?",
        "Lisa: Yes. And I know the dress. I know the one that your friend likes. So I'll put it right up.",
        "Celia: This is incredible. I can't believe it. Thank you so much.",
        "Lisa: You are so welcome. Who says dreams can't come true? Let me tell you, I think that you are a very true friend. And I hope this young lady knows how lucky she is.",

        "Lucinda: Lily! You gave it to him. You gave it to Keith. He's already moved from your bed into your wallet.",
        "Lily: That's enough! I warned you, enough!",
        "Lucinda: I can't take it. After all we know about him. After all we know what he did. You're driving me crazy, Lily. I cannot stand by passively while this criminal plays you for a fool!",
        "Lily: I'm not as foolish as you think I am.",
        "Lucinda: Is that what I heard in your voice? Oh, not the usual reflexive -- are you beginning to realize?",
        "Lily: Let me tell you what I realize. That despite your low opinion of me, I am more than capable of handling my money and my life. I thought you came over here to apologize to me. You have a very funny way of showing it. Would you please go? You know where the door is.",
        "Lucinda: All right, darling. You know where I am. If you need me, you know where I am. And I'll make you a promise. I won't say \"I told you so\" when your eyes are finally open. I do hope they're going to open sooner rather than later. Before he takes something much more precious than just money.",
