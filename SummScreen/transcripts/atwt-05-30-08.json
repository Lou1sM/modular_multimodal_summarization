        "Paul: Sofie, this is not -- no, stop. This is not gonna happen. You need to put your clothes on, you need to go home.",
        "Sofie: But I belong here with you.",
        "Paul: No, you don't. Look, am I -- am I not being clear?",
        "Sofie: No. I heard what you said, but you would never have done all those things for me, investing in my business, throwing a party for me tonight.",
        "Paul: It's my job.",
        "Sofie: No, it's not just that. It's not just that. You have feelings for me. The same feelings I have for you.",
        "Paul: We're friends, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: No, Paul. Paul, I love you. Let me show you how much.",
        "[Sofie takes her dress off]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You're in love with Paul? Well, I have to admit, this isn't how I expected our date to end.",
        "Meg: I didn't expect it, either. And I didn't mean to lead you on.",
        "Mike: I know you're not like that.",
        "Meg: Sorry.",
        "Mike: Why? You're being honest about how you feel. I just hope that you think long and hard before you act on it.",
        "Meg: Eh, what does that mean?",
        "Mike: It means that every time you get close to Paul Ryan, it ends in disaster. You told me that yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Do you know how long it's been since we've been out together, just the two of us?",
        "Brad: Too long. Pre-Liberty, definitely.",
        "Katie: I know. I feel so liberated!",
        "Liberty: Oh, hey. Nice dress.",
        "Katie: Yes, hello. I did not know you were home.",
        "Liberty: Ninja skills.",
        "Brad: We were just headed to dinner. You want to come?",
        "Liberty: No, thanks. I'm actually kind of allergic to the third-wheel thing, 'cause it's awkward.",
        "Brad: Well, you shouldn't be. You're my kid. I want you around.",
        "Liberty: Hey, no. Seriously. I want to hang out and watch TV if that's okay with you guys.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it's good. Just, um -- there's tons of food in the fridge. Have a good time. We should get going.",
        "Brad: Yes.",
        "Katie: I don't want to be late for our reservation.",

        "Liberty: Hello?",
        "Janet: Hey, Sweetie. I'm getting off work here pretty soon, and I was just checking to see if you wanted to grab some dinner with me, and maybe we could have a little girl's night. What do you say?",
        "Liberty: Sorry, Mom. I'm going out to eat with Brad and Katie. I hope you have fun.",
        "Brad: I thought you said you were staying home.",
        "Liberty: I am, alone.",
        "Brad: All right. This has got to stop now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay, look. I know Paul's not high on your list, and why should he be, after everything I've told you?",
        "Mike: He treats women like dirt.",
        "Meg: Okay, so he doesn't have a great track record. It's true. But there's something different with him right now. No one's more surprised than I am. I didn't think that he would ever change, Mike, but he has.",
        "Mike: And there's not part of you that's worried about repeating old mistakes?",
        "Meg: Can you try and give me a little bit more credit than that, please?",
        "Mike: I'm sorry. I'm just being protective.",
        "Meg: Thank you. But I can take care of myself.",
        "Meg: Look, it's not like I have forgotten all the bad things that happened, but I just want Paul back in my life. And I know -- I feel that if we work together, then we could really have a future together.",
        "Mike: Fine. But what about the present?",
        "Meg: What are you talking about?",
        "Mike: Sofie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I want you, Paul, and I know that no matter what you say, the last thing you want is for me to walk away, so why fight something that would make us both so happy?",
        "Paul: Sofie. I can't be what you want me to be. Listen to me. Hey. You are a beautiful and talented, very sweet, young --. Sofie, stop. Stop, stop! Stop it! Look, you need to get dressed, and you need to go.",
        "Sofie: Paul, why are you being such a hypocrite? I know you want me as much as I want you.",
        "Paul: What reality are you living in?",
        "Sofie: I felt it. I felt it when you kissed me.",
        "Paul: I didn't kiss you! Sofie, I didn't kiss you, okay? You kissed me. I had nothing to do with that. I don't want to kiss you or make love with you or any of that.",
        "Sofie: The look in your eyes --",
        "Paul: I feel sorry for you.",
        "Sofie: No, no. No, that's not the truth.",
        "Paul: Look, whatever feelings you think that I have for you, they're -- it's your imagination. I don't -- I don't want you.",
        "Sofie: That's a lie. That's a lie.",
        "Paul: Look, we made love once. We had sex. It was a mistake. I told you that.",
        "Sofie: Then why can't you stay away from me?",
        "Paul: Because my mother, who has cancer, asked me to plan you a party. I did that for her, and I wanted to protect my investment. Look, I don't know how you got the wrong idea about me. I have gone out of my way to keep from leading you on.",
        "Sofie: You can't just -- you can't just will me to stop loving you.",
        "Paul: Loving? Sofie, I don't love you.",
        "Sofie: Because of Meg. Because even though she wants nothing to do with you, you still have hope. Even though she's told you a million times that she's not interested. You're just like me.",
        "Paul: No. No, there's a difference. Meg loved me once. The question for me is whether Meg has stopped loving me.",
        "Sofie: How many times and ways does she have to hurt you before you realize there's no hope?",
        "Paul: Oh geez, Sofie, I don't know. You tell me, how many times does somebody have to be told?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Sofie wants Paul, and I think she'll do anything to get what she wants.",
        "Meg: Well, she's already tried that.",
        "Mike: Well, sure, she slept with him, but there's still a whole playbook she hasn't even cracked yet.",
        "Meg: It doesn't matter what Sofie does. Paul's not interested in her.",
        "Mike: And do you think he figured that out before or after he had sex with her?",
        "Meg: He made it quite clear that it was a one-night stand.",
        "Mike: Oh, nice.",
        "Meg: He wasn't cruel about it.",
        "Mike: Well I don't think Sofie got the message. The girl's nuts about him. It was all over her face at the party. And she's not going to give up just because Paul says so. For a lonely girl like Sofie, it only makes Paul more attractive.",
        "Meg: That may be true. But as much as she doesn't want to admit it, she does know that Paul was using her to get over me.",
        "Mike: And is that what you were doing with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: There you are, hungry man.",
        "Bud: Oh, saut\u00e9ed onions.",
        "Janet: Is that a problem?",
        "Bud: No, you read my mind.",
        "Janet: I thought I pegged you for a guy who liked a little something extra.",
        "Bud: My name's Bud.",
        "Janet: I'm Janet. Nice to meet you.",
        "Bud: What time do you get out of here, Janet?",
        "Janet: Actually, I'll be out of here pretty soon, but I --",
        "Bud: You have a boyfriend. All the beautiful women do.",
        "Janet: Not all of them. I'm single.",
        "Bud: That's a crime.",
        "Janet: I know! You're telling me.",
        "Bud: I've got a great idea. Why don't we go for a drink after you get off, and we'll see what we can do to rectify the situation?",
        "Janet: Oh, thanks. But I'm -- I'm kind of taking a break from the dating world right now. I have a new job, and I have a kid to worry about.",
        "Bud: Lucky kid.",
        "Janet: I'm not so sure she'd agree with you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Have you forgotten everything your mother's done for you?",
        "Liberty: No. But I have a feeling you're going to remind me.",
        "Brad: She raised you all by herself. Hey, that's not easy. That's challenging. Katie and I, we got you full-grown.",
        "Liberty: Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was that much of a problem.",
        "Katie: You are a handful, but you're great. That's not what Brad was saying.",
        "Brad: She basically sacrificed a huge part of her life to give you what you need. I mean, she wasn't much older than you when she had you.",
        "Liberty: You know, I don't mean to be obnoxious here, but I do know the whole sob story way better than you do. And all I can say is she's not the mom of the year you think she is.",
        "Brad: You turned out pretty good.",
        "Katie: Why? What did she do to make you so mad?",
        "Liberty: You know, it just doesn't matter.",
        "Brad: You're right, it doesn't. So, whatever she did, she's still your mother, and she loves you like nobody's business.",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brad: You should have heard her defending you when I was going off about you making out with that boy.",
        "Liberty: Wow, she's good.",
        "Brad: Listen to me. I mean, she's going through growing pains, too. 16 years, a single parent, and all of a sudden I'm in the picture. She misses having you all to herself. I mean, so maybe she said something wrong.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, well, she did.",
        "Brad: Well, give her a break. She's trying to make up. That's why she called.",
        "Liberty: How do you know that?",
        "Katie: Well, she wanted to do something with you, right?",
        "Brad: She misses you. You miss her. You're both just too proud to admit it. I mean, that phone call, I mean, that was her way. That was her way of reaching out. Now stop being such a tough guy. Just meet her halfway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I wasn't using you, Mike. When I said I would go to the party with you --",
        "Mike: You didn't realize that you were still in love with Paul?",
        "Meg: You don't believe that?",
        "Mike: No, I -- I do. I just -- can't help but be a little bit disappointed. I kind of thought that you and I --",
        "Meg: I kind of thought that, too. It's just --",
        "Mike: Don't worry about it, you know? The last thing that I need to do is become involved with someone who's in love with someone else. Friends?",
        "Meg: I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, look. It's been a -- it's been a big night full of excitement, and I think you just got carried away. But, really, it needs to stop. Okay, I'm not in love with you, I'm just -- I'm investing in your business. That's all.",
        "Sofie: Would you admit it if you were?",
        "Paul: Would I admit that I was in love with somebody? I have no problem admitting that I'm in love with somebody. I'm in love with Meg. It's not that you're not terrific, really. You're -- you're -- you're amazing. You just don't realize it yet. Okay? But once you get your business up and running and you're taking orders and you're meeting buyers and you're going on fashion shoots, you will realize that you don't need anyone in your life to have that life be good. You don't need a guy like me or Cole or anybody else to be happy.",
        "Sofie: You don't understand, Paul. Tonight, the party, everything leading up to it, it was all for you. It was all for you. I wanted you to see me in a different light, and I thought if -- I thought if I did something special and that other people realized that, that you would realize it.",
        "Paul: You don't need to prove to me how amazing you are. I know how talented you are, and I think that, you know, the show was a big hit.",
        "Sofie: So what? So what? All the success in the world doesn't matter if you're not there to share it with me.",
        "Paul: Hey. I can't be that person for you. I can't. And I can't possibly love you the way you deserve to be loved. I'm just a friend. Please tell me you understand that.",
        "Sofie: You don't love me. I got it.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: I'll leave you alone on one condition.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Sofie: Make love to me one more time.",
        "Paul: Did you hear anything that I just said to you?",
        "Sofie: We're good together. You have to admit that.",
        "Paul: Sofie, I am not going to ha -- I don't want to have sex with you.",
        "Sofie: Why not? It won't mean anything.",
        "Paul: Why would you do that to yourself? Why would you -- what would be the point of something like that?",
        "Sofie: Because I want -- I want one more chance to prove to you --",
        "Paul: I just told you that I'm in love with somebody else. Don't you have any pride?",
        "Sofie: No. Not where you're concerned.",
        "Paul: You need to leave right now.",
        "Sofie: Paul. Paul, please don't be angry with me.",
        "Paul: It's too late for you to say something like that to me. Get your clothes, and get the hell out of my house! Fine. You won't leave, I will. Don't be here when I get back.",
        "Sofie: Aah!",
        "[Shattering]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Thanks for being honest with me, Meg, and I wish you the best. But for the record, Ryan is not it.",
        "Meg: Well, I hope Paul and I can prove you wrong about that.",
        "Mike: So, have you told Paul about how you feel?",
        "Meg: I was just going to before you came in.",
        "Mike: Well, don't let me stop you. Go get him.",
        "Meg: Thank you for everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: We have great pie. Here you go. You need some change?",
        "Bud: Keep it.",
        "Janet: Thanks.",
        "Bud: It's my pleasure. I'll be at the Lakeview if you change your mind about that drink.",
        "Liberty: I can see you're real broke up about not hanging out with me, aren't you, Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I'm sorry I was so weird at the movies.",
        "Ashley: No big deal. Everybody's weird sometimes.",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Gabi: Ash, I'm so glad I found you. You have to see the new summer dresses that are out. You'll die.",
        "Ashley: See you later?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Whew. Now, that was lame.",
        "Parker: Are you stalking me?",
        "Liberty: I don't have to. You're always around, and, Boy, do you need my help.",
        "Parker: Why would I need your help? Your life's a train wreck.",
        "Liberty: Well, at least I know how to handle the opposite sex. And the way you're going with Trashley, you're never gonna get to first base.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey. What you doing? I thought you were gonna have dinner with your dad and Katie.",
        "Liberty: I changed my mind.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay. How you doing, Parker?",
        "Parker: I'm good.",
        "Liberty: That's debatable.",
        "Janet: Are you guys -- is there --",
        "Parker: We're cousins.",
        "Janet: Right. But just technically. I mean, that's what you said, Libby, right? Technically.",
        "Liberty: Mom, stop. Seriously.",
        "Janet: All right, sorry. Okay. So, listen. Since you're not having dinner with your dad, I am starvin' Marvin. How about we go and get something to eat, the two of us? Hmm?",
        "Liberty: Well, are you sure you can fit me in?",
        "Janet: I just asked you.",
        "Liberty: Okay, don't worry about it. 'Cause Parker and I, we have to work on a school project, so --",
        "Janet: Oh. Okay. Great, well, all right. Great. If you need anything, I'll be at the hotel. So just call me. All right?",
        "Liberty: Okay, I will.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Parker: I guess I'm not the only one who has issues with their mom.",
        "Liberty: We do not have issues. As long as we just stay very, very far apart from each other, we're fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I really think you got through to Liberty about Janet.",
        "Brad: Yeah. You know, I'm thinking that they're sitting down to a double order of fries, talking about what a great guy I am.",
        "Katie: I'm sure. Oh, think again.",
        "Janet: Hi. Is this seat taken?",
        "Bud: It is now.",
        "Katie: She doesn't look upset. Maybe she and Liberty made peace.",
        "Brad: Then why is she picking up strange guys in a bar instead of spending the evening with our kid? Excuse me. I'm sorry. Can I talk with you for a second?",
        "Janet: Uh --",
        "Brad: Please.",
        "Janet: I'll be right back.",
        "Brad: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I thought I was better off without my mom, too.",
        "Liberty: I'm not in the mood for a lecture, Dr. Freud.",
        "Parker: I'm just saying --",
        "Liberty: Parker! Parker, read my lips. I am not interested in talking about the maternal unit because I am here to make sure you get some action before you turn 50.",
        "Parker: Like you just said, I'm not interested.",
        "Liberty: Liar.",
        "Parker: Okay, what are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. Give me that back. Give me that. Okay.",
        "Liberty: There you go. You're all set.",
        "Parker: For what?",
        "Liberty: Operation Ashley.",
        "Parker: Are you trying to ruin my life?",

        "Paul: What are you doing here, Mike?",
        "Mike: I was invited. What can I do for you, Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm looking for Meg. What's that face? Where is she?",
        "Mike: It's just -- it's funny. Actually, she just left to find you.",
        "Paul: Oh. Bummer for you.",
        "Mike: I'll get over it, but you should probably go. She's halfway to your house by now.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Mike: But just -- answer one question for me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What happened?",
        "Sofie: I guess Paul and I got a little carried away.",
        "Meg: Sofie, you're bleeding. I can help. Let me look at your hands.",
        "Sofie: No, I don't want your help. I don't need your help. All I need is Paul. All he needs is me. And we don't want you here. Why do you look so confused, Meg? You saw us at the party together. We're a couple now. I thought you'd have figured that out.",
        "Meg: No, I didn't. I don't believe you.",
        "Sofie: Why not? What more proof do you need? You already caught us in the act once?",
        "Meg: Well, that didn't mean anything. Not to Paul, anyway.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, of course he told you that. He didn't want to hurt you. But you have to face the facts, Meg. You lost him.",
        "Meg: You're wrong. Paul still loves me.",
        "Sofie: If he did, he would never have made love to me the way he did tonight. Over and over and over again.",
        "Meg: Nothing happened between you and Paul.",
        "Sofie: Do you need me to describe it in detail?",
        "Meg: You obviously have a very vivid imagination --",
        "Sofie: You saw us together. That's obviously no one-time thing.",
        "Meg: You're lying.",
        "Sofie: Am I? You're lying, Meg! You're lying to yourself! You're lying to yourself! Paul loves me! And he wants to be with me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Have you changed, Ryan? Have you turned into someone that Meg can count on to go the distance this time?",
        "Paul: I don't need to answer to you, Mike.",
        "Mike: Well, Meg has been hurt enough. Don't make her sorry for trusting you again.",
        "Paul: Hey, I was just trying to call you. You're looking for me?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I was. But I bumped into Sofie, instead.",
        "Paul: Why -- what did she say?",
        "Meg: That you made love to her tonight.",
        "Paul: She's lying. She's lying. She's delusional. Oh, Meg, please, you've got to believe me.",
        "Meg: I don't know, Paul. After everything that's happened, I don't know if I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: What are you so bent out of shape about?",
        "Parker: You just sent Ashley a text message from my phone.",
        "Liberty: Pretty good, huh?",
        "Parker: Meet me in front of Al's for a big surprise? Are you kidding? What if she actually shows up?",
        "Liberty: Well, you like her, don't you?",
        "Parker: So what?",
        "Liberty: So, I gave you an opening. Thanks to me, you're going to get some quality time with the girl.",
        "Parker: That's great. She's on her way. You are the worst thing that has ever happened to me.",
        "Liberty: You'll thank me later.",
        "Parker: When? Before or after she finds out that there is no big surprise? So I'm just standing there like a weirdo, which she already thinks I am, thanks to you. Oh, my God, I hate you, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Oh, you have to hate me later because Trashley's on her way.",
        "Parker: Stop calling her that!",
        "Liberty: You've got to be creative. Come on --",
        "Parker: Okay, genius, this was your idea. So, you tell me exactly what to say when she asks what the big surprise is?",
        "Liberty: You don't say anything, you just do it.",
        "Parker: Do what?",
        "Liberty: Do I really have to explain this to you? Okay, when she shows up, you just haul off and kiss her.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Liberty: Okay, lay one on her.",
        "Parker: I can't do that!",
        "Liberty: You're physically incapable or are you just chicken?",

        "Janet: Since when is it a crime to have a drink after work?",
        "Brad: What about Liberty?",
        "Janet: What about her?",
        "Brad: Well, she came to find you. Did you see her or are you too busy cozying up to strangers in a bar?",
        "Janet: Oh, for your information, yeah, I saw Liberty. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner with me, but she blew me off. She didn't want to have anything to do with me. And as far as Bud goes, he is not a stranger.",
        "Brad: When did you meet him?",
        "Janet: Today.",
        "Brad: Where?",
        "Janet: At the diner.",
        "Brad: What's his last name?",
        "Janet: I don't know.",
        "Brad: Stranger.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on, what business is it of yours what I do or who I do it with?",
        "Brad: You're Liberty's mother. You need to set a good example.",
        "Janet: Oh, please, that ship sailed long ago when I got knocked up on prom night. And another piece of information for you, neither one of us are very good role models, so there!",
        "Brad: Look -- I am trying to clean up my act.",
        "Janet: Oh, oh, you really want to go there with me right?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I really do want to go with you right now --",
        "Katie: No, he doesn't -- no, he doesn't -- you are totally free to date, isn't she?",
        "Janet: That -- it depends.",
        "Katie: He does not look like an escaped convict.",
        "Brad: Well, they never do. That's how they avoid capture, Katie --",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Janet.",
        "Brad: Look, do not apologize for me.",
        "Katie: Don't act so crazy and I won't have to. Have a good night. Let's go --",
        "Janet: I'm sorry about that.",
        "Bud: Old boyfriend?",
        "Janet: Oh, how'd you guess?",
        "Bud: I can spot a jealous lover a mile away.",
        "Janet: Really? Do you think Brad's jealous?",
        "Bud: Not him. Her. She couldn't drag the poor guy out of here fast enough. And I thank her, from the bottom of my glass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, Meg, you're right to not believe me. I have lied to you. I've lied to you about Sofie. But I swear to you, I am not lying now.",
        "Meg: I really don't know what to believe anymore.",
        "Paul: Well, if I wanted to be with Sofie, I'd go be with Sofie. I -- she's really confused.",
        "Meg: Yeah, she's not the only one, Paul. She was half-naked!",
        "Paul: Yeah, because after the party, she showed up at my house and she threw herself at me. She thought because I invested in her business that I had some kind of feelings for her.",
        "Meg: And you don't?",
        "Paul: No, none. None. And I made that clear to her. And she wouldn't listen, so I left. I thought maybe if I gave her some time to cool off, that she would figure out what was really happening. It was either that or I was going to throw her out with no clothes on. Meg, I swear to you, I am telling you the truth.",
        "Meg: I believe you. I don't know why I do --",
        "Paul: Hey, I don't ever want to lie to you again.",
        "Meg: So, what are you going to about Sofie?",
        "Paul: It's done. We're over. I -- I've done everything that I was going to do.",
        "Meg: I wouldn't be so sure about that. After seeing her tonight, I don't think she's going to go peacefully.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Meg: When I walked into the living room, she was on the floor. No clothes, the whole place was destroyed --",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: There was glass everywhere -- and she had cuts on her hands. She was bleeding.",
        "Paul: On her hands or her wrists --",
        "Meg: Do you really think I would have left her alone if she had cuts --",
        "Paul: No, no, you're right -- I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. You're --",
        "Meg: Look, she was being dramatic. I offered to take a look at the cuts on her hands, but she -- she didn't want me to touch her. She said all she needed was you.",
        "Paul: I have made it perfectly clear to her that I am not an option for her.",
        "Meg: I don't think that matters. She's obsessed. And after the way she was acting tonight, I don't think she's going to have a problem going to extremes to get whatever she needs.",
        "Paul: I better get back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sofie -- Sofie -- hey, Sofie! Sofie! Sofie! Sofie, wake up! Sofie, wake up! Hey -- come here. Hey --",

        "Paul: Meg's the reason that I came back.",
        "Sofie: What are you talking about? You came back for me.",
        "Paul: She said that you cut your hands and she was really worried about you.",
        "Sofie: No, I'm fine. Just get her out of here.",
        "Meg: You're not fine, Sofie. You need medical attention.",
        "Paul: You are an artist. You're on the verge of this huge career. You need your hands to make jewelry.",
        "Sofie: I don't care about the stupid jewelry.",
        "Meg: Sofie, look, you've had a long day, okay. Let's get you cleaned up and dressed so you can go home and get some rest.",
        "Sofie: No, I'm not going anywhere with you. How could you do this to me? How could you hurt me like this? Do you really hate me that much?",

        "Liberty: You are so pathetically freaked out, Dude.",
        "Parker: Okay, why are you still here?",
        "Liberty: To cheer you on. In silence, of course.",
        "Parker: You know what, you're the biggest pain in the butt.",
        "Liberty: Oh, you're really going to thank me she's like kissing you and --",

        "Brad: I shouldn't have caused a scene, just -- I don't know, just seeing Janet with that guy, just really threw me.",
        "Katie: That's funny, cause it made me feel great seeing Janet with another guy other than my husband. Look, I'm going to ask you something, Brad, and I want a straight answer, okay?",
        "Brad: Okay, shoot.",
        "Katie: All right, back at the Lakeview, when Janet asked you why you care who she dated, you said it was because of Liberty. But that's not the whole truth, is it?",

        "Paul: No, she took off -- across that field. I think she's going to get home okay.",
        "Meg: You know what happened here tonight was not just about you.",
        "Paul: Why, what are you saying?",
        "Meg: I think she's been putting up a front for a very long time now and she just couldn't take it anymore. And it just came crashing in on her.",
        "Paul: It probably didn't help, seeing us together.",
        "Meg: Yeah, especially since she thought we were over months ago.",
        "Paul: You saying we're not?",
        "Meg: You know -- I -- I don't think this is a good time to be talking about you and me right now.",
        "Paul: Well, probably -- probably not, but -- Mike told me that you were looking for me 'cause you wanted to talk to me. Hey, is there something you wanted to tell me?",
        "Meg: I wanted to say -- I love you.",
        "Paul: If you can say you love me after everything that I've put you through - - Meg, it's more than I ever hoped for.",
        "Meg: I tried not to, but I do. I love you. I do more than ever.",

        "Janet: Uh, thanks but I think that you've already had enough, and gosh I'm really tired, so I think that, really it's time for you to go.",

        "Janet: Actually, I did. Good night.",
        "Bud: Aw, come on, beautiful. Just one kiss. If you still want me to go after that, I will.",

        "Brad: Look, I don't know what it is, but there is something about Janet that makes me worry about her, I can't help it.",
        "Katie: She's a grown woman. Brad, she got along fine without you all these years.",
        "Brad: That's debatable. You don't know her the way I do.",
        "Katie: True, I don't.",
        "Brad: I mean, she acts all tough, like Liberty, but underneath all that is the same trusting, naive girl I knew back in high school.",
        "Katie: Naive?",
        "Brad: No she is, she is, okay. She's always had horrible judgment when it comes to men. Myself included. And when I saw her with that guy at the Lakeview, gave me a real bad feeling.",
        "Katie: Maybe you're jealous.",
        "Brad: What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I just -- you know -- no. I just don't want Janet to feel like she can let down her guard because she's in a nice small town like Oakdale and a guy like that comes around and it gets ugly. And let's just face it, she wouldn't be here if not for me. I feel responsible.",
        "Katie: What happened between the two of you was a long time ago. And just for the record, Janet is far from naive. You, on the other hand are acting very naive.",
        "Brad: What are you saying?",
        "Katie: That maybe giving Janet the benefit of the doubt shouldn't be your go- to reaction to everything she does.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm just trying to be honest with you here and you're getting all defensive. I'm doing the best that I can.",
        "Katie: Sorry, I just want some one on one time with my husband. So when I saw Janet with another guy, I thought -- great, this is good for all of us. She's got a job, now maybe a boyfriend. And you and I have each other. Which is how it should be.",
        "Brad: You're right. You're right, Janet is a grown woman. And she can take care of whatever comes her way.",

        "Bud: What's your problem, Lady? All I wanted was a kiss.",

        "Bud: No wonder you're alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I thought that when you let me kiss you before, it was like a one -- a one-time offer.",
        "Meg: I wanted to tell, but I got scared. I thought if I did --",
        "Paul: You thought something would go wrong?",
        "Meg: I guess I just wanted to avoid the trouble. I should have just spoken up.",
        "Paul: No trouble. There's no trouble. Trouble's behind us. I love you too. And now no one can get in our way again.",
