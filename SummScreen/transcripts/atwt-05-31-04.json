        "Lucinda: Three generations of Walsh women.",
        "Sierra: Congratulations again, sweetheart. I am so proud of you.",
        "Lucinda: Beautiful! Okay. Now, let's take a picture of the child with the diploma.",
        "Sierra: Let me hold the flowers. They're beautiful.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, they are.",
        "Sierra: Rosanna sent them, since she wasn't able to be here herself.",
        "Lucinda: She was probably afraid she'd run into Craig. He was otherwise engaged. Can you imagine any decent man living in the same town with his daughter who doesn't come to the graduation?",
        "Sierra: Mother, not today, really. Lily? Why don't you and Holden join us for this next one?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. Just one big happy family. All right. Here we go. On three. One, two --",
        "Craig: Wait. Wait for Daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hi, Susan. Emily.",
        "Emily: Any word yet from Alison?",
        "Chris: Nothing.",
        "Susan: I was awake all night, driving myself crazy, wondering what to do next.",
        "Kim: I'm going to be late -- oh, sorry. I didn't realize we had company. Good. Did you stop by to pick up Ally's potting wheel?",
        "Susan: No, Kim. We stopped by because Alison is missing. Thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Alison!",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: What are you doing?",
        "Alison: I was starving and there was nothing to eat in your refrigerator except for some butter and pickles. So I found some money and did some shopping.",
        "Aaron: You're cooking?",
        "Alison: Breakfast burrito.",
        "Aaron: Wow. This is like real food.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and it tastes really good, too. Eat up.",
        "Aaron: Don't you have a job to go to?",
        "Alison: I took the day off.",
        "Aaron: Where is everything? Where's my stuff?",
        "Alison: I cleaned up. Think of it as thanks for letting me crash here. You're the best.",
        "Aaron: Oh, okay. You know, I'm really sorry you got busted over that whole pottery thing.",
        "Alison: Well, it was all going to end sometime. I couldn't keep coming up with more lies, it was too exhausting. How's the burrito?",
        "Aaron: Oh, awesome.",
        "Alison: Great! And I almost forgot to tell you, I cleared out some space in your closet, and I took a shelf in your bathroom.",
        "Aaron: For what?",
        "Alison: After all the pottery you bought me to cover up for my lies, I figured that you would need some help with your rent. Here's another burrito. Roomie. It's on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Hello? Russ, I've already told you, I can't talk. I got you out of jail, didn't I? I'll be in touch when I can. Stop calling! Michael, you didn't have to do that! I was going grocery shopping later today.",
        "Mike: No problem. Who were you talking to?",
        "Pilar: No one.",
        "Mike: I thought I heard you on the phone.",
        "Pilar: No. Let me put those away --",
        "Mike: Don't worry about it. I've got it. You can finish getting dressed now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: I fed Snickers -- and the other one.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Simon: Are you still cold?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I just can't seem to shake it.",
        "Simon: A warm bath used to do the trick.",
        "Katie: That's a good idea.",
        "Simon: No, no, no, please, you stay there, let me run the water for you.",
        "Katie: You don't have to do that.",
        "Simon: I want to. I miss taking care of you.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess I've gotten used to taking care of myself.",
        "Simon: But I'm home now.",
        "Katie: Are you?",
        "Simon: What have I got to do to prove that to you?",
        "Katie: I keep having this dream. I had it again last night. Where I'm standing on the wrong side of that chain link fence.",
        "Simon: That fence isn't between us anymore.",
        "Katie: I couldn't move, I couldn't scream. And I knew that even if I could you wouldn't be able to hear me. I just have to stand there and watch you walk away, get swallowed up by the fog.",
        "Simon: The headshrinkers at that place you were in probably say that dream means that you don't trust me.",
        "Katie: I don't, Simon.",
        "Simon: Well, listen, after everything I've put you through, I don't blame you. But I promise you, time will heal us.",
        "Katie: I don't think anything can heal this. I don't know if I'll be ever able to trust you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Lullaby? I am so proud of you.",
        "Lucy: Thank you, Daddy.",
        "Craig: Listen, I got you a little something. Happy graduation. No, open the box first. He was hoping to get it to you the night before the graduation so you could wear it to the ceremony. But after your mother dropped that marriage bomb on us and rushed you out of here so quickly --",
        "Sierra: I didn't rush her anywhere. I haven't seen Lucy in months, and I wanted to catch up with things.",
        "Craig: Yes. Catch up. I don't think I've congratulated you on your nuptials to Adam here.",
        "Sierra: It's Alan. And no. No, you haven't. But you have a lot of nerve pointing fingers. At least I showed up at my daughter's graduation.",
        "Craig: I was there. I stood at the back because I didn't think I was welcome in your group.",
        "Sierra: But you feel comfortable crashing the brunch.",
        "Lucy: Mom -- Daddy -- don't do this, please. I want him here. And thank you for the pearls. They're incredible.",
        "Craig: You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.",
        "Sierra: Except save her from embarrassment.",
        "Craig: I have an idea. Why don't we order some mimosas?",
        "Sierra: Perfect. I'll be back.",
        "Lucy: Were you really at the graduation?",
        "Craig: Of course. I wouldn't have missed that for anything. Are you kidding? To see you walk across the stage like -- get your diploma? If I could have found the brass band, they would have played.",
        "Lucy: Daddy.",
        "Craig: I've never been so proud in my life.",
        "Lucy: I'm really glad you were there.",
        "Craig: I'm always there. I'm always there. Well, listen, why don't you open the card?",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Craig: Huh? What do you think?",
        "Lucy: A membership to the country club?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Just because you're going off to college doesn't mean our summer doesn't have to happen.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, you know I'm going back to Montega with Mom for the summer.",
        "Craig: Still? I thought -- I thought that now that your mother has, you know, a husband and all you might reconsider.",
        "Donna: I feel sorry for Craig.",
        "Lucinda: Shut up, Donna. He isn't worth the powder to blow him to hell.",
        "Donna: That's really nice. He's Lucy's father.",
        "Lucinda: You know how she is, she's always rooting for the underdog.",
        "Donna: That's not true.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no?",
        "Donna: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Well, then why didn't you tell the IRS about your crooked partner when you found out he was using the foundation to launder money?",
        "Molly: Darling. Dusty? Dust Dusty's money laundering?",
        "Molly: He got involved with some sleazy people from his past. It's not worth going into. I told you. Didn't I warn you?",
        "Molly: He's out of our lives for good. End of story. Nice of you to show. The chef and I have been waiting for you to get here so we can meet with the appliance guy.",
        "Donovan: You've got a half hour. Don't get your panties all twisted up. You hate me. I get that. I'm not your biggest fan, either. But if you can't have some respect for me, at least have some for Sal. And maybe you can find some left over for yourself.",
        "Donovan: All I was saying is I wasn't that late! Miss sensitive. Ready to talk, Donovan?",
        "Donovan: Not here. Not in my place of business. If you don't make good on what you owe me, your business might become my business. Now, the way I see it, you can either call the cops on me -- or you can buy me a beer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I can understand how upset you must be, but to blame me for Ally's disappearance is --",
        "Chris: We're not saying she disappeared forever. She's not gone forever. She probably just checked out for a while until things settle down.",
        "Susan: But where? She didn't come home.",
        "Emily: Does she have any money?",
        "Chris: No. She has to give back most of what she makes at Metro and to buy back all that pottery she pretended to make.",
        "Susan: She borrowed from whom?",
        "Chris: From Aaron. Who else?",
        "Susan: Poor kid. Having to make up all those stories. She must have felt so pressured to go to such extremes.",
        "Kim: Nobody pressured her to make those stories up. She did that all on her own.",
        "Susan: Only because she still feels guilty about the money Chris lost on the condo. She's just trying to make it up to him.",
        "Kim: Maybe she shouldn't have pressed him to buy a condo he couldn't afford in the first place.",
        "Chris: Mom, that's not fair --",
        "Susan: No, it's not, but it's what she really thinks. No wonder Alison felt that everything was her fault that she had to go to such extremes to make people happy.",
        "Kim: Well, she did a bang-up job of that, didn't she?",
        "Susan: My daughter is out there -- God knows where? Because of your impossibly high expectations! You let her know that she just didn't measure up, that she would never fit in here. So she left.",
        "Kim: No. She ran away. Because that's what she always does when things get tough. That's the way she escapes her problems. She lies and then she runs.",
        "Emily: You know what? That is enough. I think we could all use a little restraint right now.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I second that. Let's not do this.",
        "Kim: Fine, fine. You said you want to find your daughter? There's the door. Feel free to use it.",
        "Susan: Good idea. I could use a little fresh air. That's probably why Alison left. You can hardly breathe in here.",
        "Chris: Emily, I'm really sorry about this.",
        "Emily: Yeah, me too.",
        "Chris: Thank you for coming by.",
        "Kim: This is really getting to be ridiculous. Alison has always lied. It didn't just start when she moved in here.",
        "Chris: Look, she's gone, okay?",
        "Kim: You know, it wasn't bad enough that I had to walk into my kitchen this morning and find the entire Stewart family attack machine lined up waiting to blame me for anything that Ally ever did or said, but now you've joined them. As far as I'm concerned, you all owe me an apology.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I can't go back to the Hughes' house. And there's no way I'm moving back in with my mom.",
        "Aaron: What about Chris? Are you guys still cool or what?",
        "Alison: Well, that's the craziest part of all. I confessed everything, every moronic stunt that I pulled, and I was expecting him to freak out and call me a loser, but he forgave me.",
        "Aaron: Good for him.",
        "Alison: I don't know how he does it. No matter what I do he still loves me.",
        "Aaron: Well, great. It doesn't sound like you guys are broken up.",
        "Alison: No, he forgave me, he loves me.",
        "Aaron: All right, Alison, then please explain to me again why I just spent the night at my house.",
        "Alison: Because his family hates me. They didn't want me there in the first place. And after they found out my talent as an artist is totally fake, I'm like poison. I can't go back there.",
        "Aaron: Okay, you can't go back there Alison, but you can't stay with me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It feels so good to be home. To be able to soak in my own tub for as long as I like. How can I ever thank you for springing me from that hospital?",
        "Simon: By trusting me again.",
        "Katie: What do you expect, Simon? You can't just walk back into my life on and on and on again and just expect me to welcome you with open arms.",
        "Simon: I never left you by choice, baby.",
        "Katie: You never just left me, either. You left me broke, you left me believing you didn't love me anymore, you left me believing you were dead.",
        "Simon: Listen, things are different now. Okay? I'm no longer in danger. The guilty are behind bars. I don't have to protect you from them anymore. Listen, I'm home.",
        "Katie: And you'll never leave me again.",
        "Simon: No, I won't. I couldn't stay away from you for one reason, pure and simple. I love you.",
        "Katie: Simon, those are just words. They don't mean anything anymore.",
        "Simon: \"I love you\" means nothing?",
        "Katie: You've said it before. Right before you left.",
        "Simon: And I will continue to say it over and over again. Until you start believing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You don't understand. Even if they did wipe the slate clean, I couldn't go back.",
        "Aaron: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because the place is like a museum. It's like I'm always afraid that I'm going to say the wrong thing or I'm going to sit on the wrong piece of furniture or I'm going to talk too loud.",
        "Aaron: It couldn't have been that bad.",
        "Alison: No, it was worse. I always felt like I was auditioning for a ace in their family and I never got the part.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, that's a bummer.",
        "Alison: So does that mean that I can move in with you?",
        "Aaron: No, I mean it's a bummer. I'm sorry. It stinks. I wish I could help you. What are you doing?",
        "Alison: You're supposed to be my friend.",
        "Aaron: We are friends, Ally. Why don't you just move back home with your mother?",
        "Alison: Yeah, and have her lecture me 24/7? I don't think so.",
        "Susan: Aaron? It's Susan Stewart.",
        "Emily: And Emily.",
        "Susan: Anybody home?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Just a second.",
        "Alison: I guess we'd better go face the music.",
        "Susan: Honey. Oh, thank god you' all right.",
        "Alison: You're not mad?",
        "Susan: I completely understand. Kim is a shrew. I want you to pack your bag and come back home where you're wanted and loved and safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Good morning. Metro.",
        "Chris: Hi, Molly. It's Chris. Have you heard from Alison? I know that she's been working at Metro for a while.",
        "Molly: Well, yeah, she called to ask for the night off, actually.",
        "Chris: What about Aaron?",
        "Molly: He's off, too.",
        "Chris: That's what I thought. Thanks.",
        "Molly: Trash day was yesterday, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Right.",
        "Molly: He's leaving.",
        "Dusty: So much hostility. Why can't we all get along?",
        "Molly: Let me tell you something. I told you I'd handle my end of the bargain straight up. And you stay away from the club, right?",
        "Dusty: What about --",
        "Man: Enough! And you stay away from the club. Your time is running out, my friend.",
        "Dusty: Your threats are so clich\u00e9, so old. You want to kill me? You and your crew? Do it, man. I'm here. Ready.",
        "Man: I'm not a violent person, Donovan. But I can get there real fast. All I'm asking is that you stick to the agreement. If you can't, we'll have to make other arrangements.",
        "Dusty: You know what? I told you, I'm handling it. And that's it. Your courteous reminders don't speed things along. Get out of here.",
        "Man: We'll see.",
        "Dusty: Get out of here.",
        "Man: We shall see.",
        "Molly: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I don't want to talk about it. Don't you and Sal have an arrangement with a plains guy or something like that?",
        "Molly: Well, at least if I'm late, I won't have both of my legs broken.",
        "Dusty: Don't be a drama queen.",
        "Molly: The liquor delivery's in the rear. Make yourself useful.",
        "Dusty: I always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Here you go, Craig. What would a celebration brunch be without Maimosa?",
        "Craig: Actually, I think I'd like something with a little more oomph.",
        "Sierra: Hemlock's out of season.",
        "Craig: Well, vodka isn't.",
        "Sierra: Is everything all right?",
        "Lucy: You know, Mom, I was thinking maybe I should postpone the trip to Montega, to give you and Alan some time to yourselves.",
        "Sierra: And where would my brilliant daughter get that silly idea?",
        "Lucy: I'm serious, Mom. You're practically still honeymooning.",
        "Sierra: Would you stop? We can't wait for you to come home! In fact, Alan is a master yachtsman. He's sailed all over the world, he even owns Hoinz charter business. I didn't want to ruin the surprise, but we're going to take you cruising around the Caribbean for a few weeks before you head up to Williams.",
        "Alan: Were my ears burning?",
        "Sierra: I was just telling her about our plans for the Caribbean.",
        "Alan: Sierra told me you love the water. I thought maybe a boat trip would be a good way to get to know each other better.",
        "Lucy: It sounds really nice, but I'm sure you'd appreciate the time to yourselves.",
        "Alan: Nonsense. We planned the whole thing with you in mind. You have to come.",
        "Craig: Listen, skipper, I think you should focus on your new wife and stop trying to pressure my daughter into something she doesn't want to do.",
        "Alan: I'd never dream of --",
        "Lucy: They're not pressuring me, Daddy.",
        "Sierra: She's old enough to make her own decisions, Craig.",
        "Alan: I see a big pile of gifts over there with your name all over them. Shall we?",
        "Craig: No, no, skipper, listen. But you can take a couple of pictures later of the proud papa and his beautiful graduate daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Two days of the cold shoulder? I've been treated better by strangers.",
        "Mike: So have I.",
        "Pilar: What did you say? Why are you being so cold?",
        "Mike: I don't like being lied to, and I don't like keeping secrets.",
        "Pilar: You think I'm keeping secrets?",
        "Mike: I know I am. Curtis and Ben didn't come here last night like I said. It was Margo and Henry.",
        "Pilar: Why would you lie to me about that?",
        "Mike: Let's just put all our cards on the table. I know all about your trip to Deerbrook to see Katie. I know you showed her that picture you took of the two of us in bed together. What I don't know is why you'd go out of your way to do something so hateful to a woman who's already locked away. I'm beginning to wonder if I even know who you are anymore. So let's hear everything. The truth this time. What the hell are you up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: And I swore to myself, if I ever got the chance to kiss you again, if I ever got the chance to be with you again, I'd never let you go.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. You're home. Hey, and you're home! This is terrific! I knew you'd bust out of that place! Give us a hug, huh? Look at you. Look at you. God, you're beautiful. Isn't she beautiful?",
        "Simon: She is perfect.",
        "Henry: She's perfect.",
        "Henry: And you, you sly dog, you. How'd you manage to free her from that funny farm?",
        "Katie: Actually, that's a good question. How did you know I was there?",
        "Henry: He saw my ad. Yes, you did. You saw my ad in \"Soldier of Fortune.\" My brilliant ad. The one I put in code. Letting him know you were in trouble, where to find you -- and it worked! I'm so good sometimes I scare myself.",
        "Simon: I've got to hand it to you, Henry. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have known my wife was in trouble.",
        "Henry: Well, I'd do anything for Bubbles. You know that, don't you, Katie?",
        "Katie: Yes, I do. Thank you so much. That place was awful. No one would listen to me, no one believed me -- I thought I'd never get out. I am never going back.",
        "Katie: Margo! What are you doing here?",
        "Margo: Dr. Tanner was wondering where his favorite patient had gone. My, how embarrassing. I guess my invitation to the homecoming party got lost in the mail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\"",
        "Chris: I was up half the night worried sick about you. Glad to see you're doing just fine. I'll never let anything bad happen to you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Daddy, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't go back to that hospital, Margo! Please don't make me go back there!",
        "Margo: Wait. First things first, okay? Thank God you're all right.",
        "Simon: Listen, Margo, they were pumping her full of drugs. There was absolutely nothing wrong with her. I had to get her out of there.",
        "Margo: I hope that it's good to see you again, Simon. I kind of thought we said good-bye for the last time last time.",
        "Simon: I came back for Katie.",
        "Margo: Henry, I guess your ad in \"Soldier of Fortune\" magazine paid off.",
        "Katie: You knew about that? That means you wanted Simon to save me! That means I'm not going back to Deerbrook. Please.",
        "Margo: Baby, I'm sorry, I'm obligated by the state to return you to full-time care. But in light of Henry's information, I don't know that Deerbrook is the place for you.",
        "Katie: What information?",
        "Margo: Long story. Short version? Katie's not safe in that booby hatch.",
        "Simon: Why isn't she released into my care? Come on, I'm still her husband, right?",
        "Margo: Do we even know how long you'll be staying this time?",
        "Simon: We, we do. I'm here legally now, Margo. The threats are gone. The danger's gone. Here. My passport. You hold on to that because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Margo: Are you okay with this?",
        "Katie: Could I be released into your care?",
        "Margo: I'll check into it. But I think because Simon is your husband it's going to carry more weight.",
        "Katie: It would just be for the remained of the 30 days, right?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Katie: Okay. All right. I'll do it.",
        "Margo: Okay. I'll see what I can do. I love you.",
        "Katie: I love you. Thank you. I'll go make us something to drink.",
        "Simon: I'll give you a hand.",
        "Margo: Hey, wait. Not so fast. It's so good to see you. And we need to have a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Henry talked with your friend Russ.",
        "Pilar: He isn't my friend -- you know that.",
        "Mike: It doesn't seem like he's your enemy, either, or your ex.",
        "Pilar: That's ridiculous!",
        "Mike: Henry's the one who tipped me that you went to Deerbrook with that picture. How would he even know about that picture if you never showed it to anyone?",
        "Pilar: I don't know! I don't understand!",
        "Mike: Maybe you can explain why Margo saw your name on the sign-in sheet the day Henry says you were there?",
        "Pilar: Michael --",
        "Mike: The truth, Pilar!",
        "Pilar: All right. You're right. Henry is right, Margo is right -- I was there. I showed Katie the picture.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Pilar: I did it for you!",
        "Mike: For me?",
        "Pilar: Did Margo check your phone logs as well? Because if she had, she would have seen that Katie called here after she was admitted. She wasn't supposed to make contact with anyone, but she was still calling you, still torturing herself and you -- I thought if I showed her that picture of us together, then maybe she would finally see for herself that you had moved on and she would stop trying to drag you into her madness.",
        "Mike: Katie isn't mad.",
        "Pilar: The doctors think she is. And her sister agrees. You saw her attacking me at the motel -- I suppose you're doubting that now, too?",
        "Mike: I'm trying to make sense of this.",
        "Pilar: I've told you the truth. I can't stay here, being interrogated, having every move second-guessed! I won't live that way.",
        "Mike: Good. Maybe it's time for you to go.",
        "Pilar: At least we agree on something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I would love to have you back home with me. I have missed you so much.",
        "Emily: Mom, come on. Would you just let her breathe? All right? Maybe she wants to talk to Chris.",
        "Alison: Actually, maybe I should move home again. Till things cool down and I figure out what to do next.",
        "Susan: That's a wonderful idea. You just let me take care of you for a while.",
        "Emily: Wait a minute. What about Chris?",
        "Susan: Yeah, I think Emily's right. Maybe you should talk to Chris about this.",
        "Emily: I'm going to call him. I will.",
        "Susan: Great. I'll just take your bag and I'll go get your room ready.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Susan: I'll see you at home.",
        "Aaron: I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Alison: What did I just do? Am I out of my mind?",
        "Aaron: Alison, it's not going to be that bad. Moving back in with your mom might be the best thing if you and Chris want to stay together.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Aaron: Think about this. Chris hates me, hates the fact we were friends. How do you think he would feel if he knew you stopped living with him to come live with me? You know, you think you don't care the way he feels.",
        "Alison: You're right. What is wrong with me?",
        "Aaron: Hey. Don't beat yourself up. Okay? You know why?",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Aaron: I'll tell you why. Because that is my job.",
        "Alison: No!",
        "Aaron: That's not even right.",
        "Chris: I was up half the night, worried sick about you. Glad to see you're doing just fine.",

        "Lucy: Looking forward to spending time on the courts with you. Congratulations. Alan. Thank you.",

        "Holden: Hey, Craig, why don't you lighten up on the vodka?",
        "Craig: Oh, Holden. Thank you. Thank you for thinking of me. Means the world. Cheerio.",
        "Lucy: A diamond tennis bracelet! It's beautiful. Look at it, Mom!",
        "Sierra: You like it?",
        "Lucy: Are you kidding? It's beautiful. Thank you.",
        "Sierra: Let me help you put it on.",
        "Craig: Diamonds before five? Why don't you put on the pearls I bought you?",
        "Lucinda: Not right now, Craig.",
        "Craig: Why not now? Gargoyle. I'm her father.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, do keep reminding us you're her father.",
        "Craig: Put them on. Show the world.",
        "Sierra: Lucy, I put your father in a cab.",
        "Lucy: Do you know where he went?",
        "Sierra: No, but -- has anyone seen my purse?",
        "Lucinda: Don't tell me you're going after that father of yours, please.",
        "Lucy: I can't let him leave thinking everyone's abandoned him.",
        "Lucinda: Lucy, your father is not your responsibility. He's a grown man --",
        "Lucy: He's my father. Right or wrong. And he wouldn't do any less for me. I'll see you later. Thank you for the lovely gifts and the brunch. See you at Grandmother's. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Chris, I am so sorry! I was going to call you, but Emily and my mom were just here and -- I guess I wasn't -- I just didn't know exactly what to say.",
        "Chris: I just wanted to see with my own eyes that you were safe.",
        "Aaron: Ali actually slept on the couch. I slept on the floor. Wow, look at that. I'm late for my run. So I'm going to -- you cool? You know how to lock the door, right? The little -- okay.",
        "Alison: Thanks, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: No problem.",
        "Alison: I was so unbelievably sad when I left you last night. But Aaron made me feel a lot better about things.",
        "Chris: I should have known that you'd come here. You always turn to Aaron when things get tough.",
        "Alison: Do I?",
        "Chris: Yeah. And if he's the guy you turn to when you need cheering up, how do I make you feel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I've got to hand it to you, man. Finding the clue in that magazine and saving Katie from the nuthouse -- you really went above and beyond.",
        "Simon: Well, she is my --",
        "Margo: But if you break her heart again, I'll kill you.",
        "Simon: It won't happen again, because I'm here now. For good.",
        "Margo: Does Katie know that?",
        "Simon: I've told her. She doesn't believe it yet, but she will. She's been through a lot.",
        "Margo: You've put her through a lot.",
        "Simon: I know, and I'm sorry about that. I'll spend the rest of our lives making it up to her. I promise. She just needs time.",
        "Katie: I made some iced tea and -- I forgot the cookies.",
        "Simon: That's fine. I'll grab them.",
        "Katie: An ad in \"Soldier of Fortune,\" huh?",
        "Henry: It seemed like a good idea. At the time. I thought you'd be over the moon to see the old sheep shearer again. Did I do the wrong thing? If you want him gone, he's gone, on the next plane.",
        "Katie: That's fine, Henry. But at least Simon knows I'm not crazy. That's more than I can say for Mike.",
        "Henry: Maybe in order to sort these things out I should give you two a little alone time.",
        "Katie: No, you don't have to leave.",
        "Henry: I'll see you later, huh?",
        "Katie: You're not going to tell me what I'm supposed to do?",
        "Henry: You know what to do, you invented it. Follow your heart. I was just thinking about you. Are you decent? Because I'm on my way over as we speak. Great. I'll see you in five.",

        "Alison: Do you remember how happy you were when I said I was taking night classes and how embarrassed you were when I said they were ceramics?",
        "Chris: What does it matter? It was all a lie anyway. And that has nothing to do with why you turned to Aaron instead of me.",
        "Alison: This has nothing to do with Aaron. You know, maybe this has to do with Aaron, because the only reason that I lied about taking the class is because I wanted to work at Metro and the only reason you didn't want me to work at Metro is because Aaron works there. But Aaron is my only true blue friend and --",
        "Chris: Aaron's your best friend in the world? That's who I'm supposed to be. And you wonder why I'm jealous of the guy.",

        "Margo: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Russ? I need a favor. I'm sorry I couldn't talk before, but I was in the middle of something important. Yes, you're important, too. Just do me this favor and I promise I'll get you everything you need.",

        "Mike: I don't know what to believe anymore!",
        "Margo: I can tell you this. If you're looking for the truth, you won't hear it from Pilar.",
        "Mike: Then I'll go to Deerbrook and see Katie myself.",
        "Margo: That's not a good idea.",
        "Mike: The only reason I was staying away is because I thought it was the best thing for her. I won't upset her, I just want to talk to her.",
        "Margo: She's fine, Mike. But she's not there.",
        "Mike: Where is she?",

        "Simon: Here we go. Just the way you like them. Careful. They're hot.",
        "Katie: I'll let them cool then.",
        "Simon: Good idea. So -- you don't have to tell me what happened with Mike, but it must have been pretty big, huh? If you end up in a mental institution nowhere to be seen.",
        "Katie: It's -- complicated.",
        "Simon: He swore he was going to take care of you. He didn't.",
        "Katie: Well, it's not all his fault.",
        "Simon: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: There was this woman. She was trying to use Mike, and I was trying to warn him although every time I tried to do something she would just make it look like I was having delusions or something. Pretty soon after a while everybody thought I was going crazy.",
        "Simon: No. He's the one who's crazy if he didn't believe you. He's the one who's crazy if he pushed your love away.",
        "Katie: You did, too.",
        "Simon: Yeah, but I'm back. I'm here. I'm home. Just look at me. Look at me. I love you so much. I'll never let anything bad happen to you again.",

        "Sierra: Why would Craig pick the most important day of his daughter's life to prove what little consideration he has for himself and others?",
        "Lucinda: It's Craig's nature to disappoint, darling. Which is why he will always find himself friendless, loveless and alone.",
        "Sierra: I hope he doesn't make Lucy feel guilty for coming back to Montega.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I think Lucy needs to leave Oakdale for a while. I'm with you on this. Okay? Leaving would be good for her.",
