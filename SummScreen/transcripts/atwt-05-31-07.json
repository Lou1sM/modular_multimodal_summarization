        "Meg: No!",
        "Meg: So, you want me to marry Craig so you can get your company back?",
        "Lucinda: It wasn't my idea, it was his.",
        "Meg: Not even you are that selfish.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I'm thinking of you.",
        "Meg: Me, me?",
        "Lucinda: Well, right from the start of this, you wanted to do something, absolutely heroic to bring Craig down. Well, my heavens, if you marry him, now you make his life a living hell.",
        "Meg: While you get a multi-million dollar company in the bargain.",
        "Lucinda: It is my company.",
        "Meg: And it is my life. And I'm not selling it to Craig or anyone else.",
        "Lucinda: All right, all right, fine. If you can live with that.",
        "Meg: Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Are you trying to make me feel guilty now?",
        "Lucinda: Don't be naive, Dear. Don't be naive. This is war.",
        "Meg: And I surrender.",
        "Lucinda: Fine. Give me back the coffee cup. Give me the coffee. I'll take over and I'll marry Craig.",
        "Meg: Now who's being naive? He's already threatening to go to the police.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but he has no evidence. Unless you're going to turn me in.",
        "Meg: Susan did a tox screen.",
        "Lucinda: Well, apparently, my drug of choice is the drug that Craig has been taking. And he told Susan it was an O.D. now, he can't go back on what he said. Because if he does, no one will believe a damn word he says.",
        "Meg: He could just say he was trying to protect you.",
        "Lucinda: That's laughable. That won't wash.",
        "Meg: Okay, so, what? You're going to try and kill him?",
        "Lucinda: We don't need to have this conversation.",
        "Meg: I can't let you do that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Meg. Oh Darling, heavens, you really do have feelings for him. So, why not marry him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Tom: Damn it, Craig. When they told me a patient needed to see me right away, now, if I'd known it was you --",
        "Craig: Boy, you would have stopped at the florist? Don't worry about it. I'm getting discharged.",
        "Tom: You were admitted? You know what? Make my day. Tell me it was a colonoscopy.",
        "Craig: No, but I appreciate the sentiment. No, my heart stopped. But there's no damage. I'm going to be fine.",
        "Tom: Heart attack?",
        "Craig: Well, Susan said it was a cardiac arrest, brought on by meds, which they've adjusted. So, I'll be fine. Tom, I'm surprised. You look concerned.",
        "Tom: Honestly? No. But you know what? Have a nice day.",
        "Craig: Tom, excuse me, please. Just wait. I do need your advice. Both as an attorney and my brother-in-law. I've drawn up a little document.",
        "Tom: Look, I know how you feel because nothing says mortality like your heart conking out on you. I mean, I should know. But I will not be drawing up your will. But I can recommend an estates attorney.",
        "Craig: This isn't about my estate. It's about our family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Co-star. Missing in action.",
        "Kim: Okay, okay, she'll be here.",
        "Brad: Well, she's late. This is totally unprofessional, Kim.",
        "Kim: Actually, you are early. For a change. Now, why don't you take a look at this, grab a cup of coffee, I'll call you when she comes.",
        "Brad: Kim, I'm not trying to tell you what to do.",
        "Kim: Oh, good.",
        "Brad: I'm just pointing out the fact that I'm here, I'm ready to go. Where's Katie? Shouldn't she be here trying to get a head start on the day? Trying to make the show just a little better? I mean, what's more important than that? Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You hungry?",
        "Jack: Maybe later. I haven't felt this relaxed -- since I don't know when.",
        "Katie: Me, too.",
        "Jack: I didn't think it was still possible, Katie. To be happy. We spend the day like this. I like to think of myself as a simple man, not expecting too much -- I don't know, maybe I do. But everybody should have someone they can feel close to. Even Snickers, seriously.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Sitting on the couch, a little conversation --",
        "Katie: Don't get too attached to this couch, okay?",
        "Jack: What, you're kicking me out already?",
        "Katie: No, I'm kicking myself out, I think. I've been here a long time. I know it's a great little place, but I think I need a fresh start. Someplace new with good energy and no bad memories --",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know what -- I know what you mean. I was out at the Milltown house with a realtor and I hadn't been there in months. I didn't like being there.",
        "Katie: It's weird, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Katie: So I think I'm going to look for a new house.",
        "Jack: Well, good. Good, whatever you need, I'll help you. I'll help you move, set up --",
        "Katie: You're unbelievable, you know that?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Life of a cop.",
        "Katie: With kids.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Who is it?",
        "Jack: Carly, what can I do for you?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry to bother you, Jack. I waited as long as I could.",
        "Jack: If this is about last night.",
        "Carly: No. No, of course not. And please apologize to Katie for me again.",
        "Jack: Done. What do you want?",
        "Carly: It's about the kids, Jack. I need to see you right away.",
        "Jack: What's wrong with the kids? Did something happen?",
        "Carly: No, everything's fine, Jack. It's just -- I was here last night and -- I was going through their things, trying to straight up -- and I miss them, Jack. I really want to figure out a schedule so I can spend some time with them.",
        "Jack: And this is why you're calling me?",
        "Carly: Well, you said that we would talk about it today. And it's important. I'm still their mother.",
        "Jack: Fine.",
        "Carly: Okay, so you'll meet me here?",
        "Jack: I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Carly: I'll bet.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: I'll get their school calendars, it won't take long. Should I meet you at the farm?",
        "Jack: No. I'll meet you at the house. It'd be better. Um, I'll see you in a little bit.",
        "Carly: Okay, I'll be here. And thanks, Jack -- [Dial tone] Jack --",
        "Jack: Sorry.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Jack: I don't want to spoil this time that we have together, okay -- it's just she wants to set up a schedule for the kids.",
        "Katie: Hey, I fell for a guy with three kids and a demanding job and an ex- wife. Things are going to come up, I guess. So, we'll just deal with them. It's not big deal. You'll meet with her, and set up a schedule -- and then, the next thing will come up and we'll roll with that.",
        "Jack: Okay. I would give anything to stay right here. You know that.",
        "Katie: Well, I have to work. And you have to work and see Carly and -- live our lives, that's what makes us so fascinating, right?",
        "Jack: Yes, that is us. Fascinating.",
        "Katie: I have a question and please feel free to say no.",
        "Jack: Please feel free to ask.",
        "Katie: The plan was that I was going to work, shoot a couple promos, and then maybe stop by and watch J.J.'s baseball game. I'd still like to stop by, but if that's a problem --",
        "Jack: Why? Why would it be a problem?",
        "Katie: Because you're going to be with Carly.",
        "Jack: Katie, that's not going to change -- okay, listen, J.J. still needs a cheering section. And Parker still needs a friend. And Sage still lights up whenever you're near.",
        "Katie: Yeah, we kind of bonded. It's a hair thing.",
        "Jack: Well, okay, so they're expecting you. And if you take to baseball like you took to ice hockey --",
        "Katie: Oh, I'll bring a helmet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Okay, you want my advice? Whatever it is, don't do it.",
        "Craig: Look, Tom, please -- take a look at this. I need to know what you think. You know all the players. You are a brilliant lawyer.",
        "Tom: And I am not for hire. Not by you.",
        "Craig: This will not compromise your ethics. It just might win you some points at home. Please.",
        "Tom: You're kidding, right?",
        "Craig: I've never been more serious in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, I didn't know you'd taken a room here.",
        "Paul: I haven't. I haven't moved in, it's just for a couple of days.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's wonderful. I'm going to enjoy having my son as my neighbor.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm not here to socialize.",
        "Barbara: Then, what are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I had some trouble sleeping and I thought, you know, a neutral environment. I called downstairs, they said they were going to send up some extra pillows, but you know, they're taking their sweet time with about it. I really got to go.",
        "Barbara: Insomnia? That's a little far fetched, Paul.",
        "Paul: What does it matter?",
        "Barbara: Okay --",
        "Paul: I got a room for a couple of days. It's really none of your business.",
        "Barbara: You know what? You know what? You are trembling. If you don't tell me what's going on, I'm going to call Meg and find out what it is --",
        "Paul: No, no, you can't call Meg.",
        "Barbara: Why not?",
        "Paul: All right, this is what's going on. Meg's going to be hurt.",
        "Barbara: How?",
        "Paul: The details don't matter.",
        "Barbara: How do you know that? Are you having a vision?",
        "Paul: Yes, and there's no mistaking it. Meg's going to be hurt.",
        "Barbara: I believe you.",
        "Paul: I need to protect her.",
        "Barbara: Who's going to hurt her, Paul?",
        "Paul: Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, just because I don't want him dead, doesn't mean I'm in love with him.",
        "Lucinda: Well, nobody wants you to fall in love with him. Who could love Craig anyway?",
        "Meg: I'm not marrying a man I don't love.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, this is a man who encouraged Lily's addiction. That's another point. Let's bring that up, all right. Your brother, Holden -- your brother? Is having a horrible time with Lily and with Faith. Now, if you could put Craig out of commission, that will do a great deal to restoring Lily's faith in herself once again.",
        "Meg: So, I'm supposed to sacrifice my whole life so that Lily --",
        "Lucinda: Your whole life? No. Six months --",
        "Meg: Six months? Six?",
        "Lucinda: Tops. Okay, he cedes the company back to me. I'm in the boardroom, and you're free. You can get a divorce. And you and Paul can live neurotically ever after.",
        "Meg: I am not going to lie to Craig about loving him.",
        "Lucinda: You're lying already. You lie about everything. You lie about the bug that you had in the bra. You say you were his friend and you loathe him. You lie about the fact that you really love Paul.",
        "Meg: I'm not going to pretend to love him.",
        "Lucinda: You have already told the man that you don't love him, right? That doesn't faze Craig. What we got here, he's making an offer. He's offering you something in return. So, all you have to do is just accept the offer.",
        "Meg: I can't do it, I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Meg, let's talk turkey, okay? I can guarantee you that Craig will lose whatever charm he may have now, the moment he sees you and Paul, outed together, in public. And he will use his position as chairman of the board of Worldwide or Montgomery Enterprises, whatever you want to call it. He will use that to ruin you -- ruin your lives. And you know that. You know that. Okay, so what you've got here is -- you haven't got a choice. It's an either or. Either or. Either you marry Craig or you kiss your happiness good-bye.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay -- so you think if I marry him, and then divorce him, he won't come after us?",
        "Lucinda: He won't have the resources. He won't have the power. Probably he'll be humiliated. He'll slink off to the Bahamas. Maybe he'll drink himself to death.",
        "Meg: I can't do that to him.",
        "Lucinda: Hey. Hey.",
        "Meg: What? What?",
        "Lucinda: He deserves it!",
        "Meg: No one deserves it. That's the problem here. You and Lily didn't deserve what he did to you and he doesn't deserve what you did to him. This needs to stop.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it will stop when you marry him.",
        "Meg: That's why I think the best thing to do is to turn him down. Then maybe -- maybe he'll understand. Look, I'm trying to reach out to that little piece of goodness he might still have left in that heart of his.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, St. Meg of the lost causes.",
        "Meg: Lucinda, he wants to start over. He wants a family.",
        "[Lucinda scoffs]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Meg. Meg -- he's a criminal. He's a criminal. Rosanna is lying in a hospital bed, I mean -- if he had any decency, he wouldn't be divorcing her, you know? He has to divorce her if you say yes and marry him. I mean, he -- oh, I just had a thought. I'm surprised that he hasn't had someone put a pillow over Rosanna's face.",
        "Meg: Lucinda, stop that!",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll stop it. I'm scaring myself. Darling, this is dangerous. It is dangerous -- but it's the only way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Okay, I think I'm ready to guess. You've done something stupid and underhanded and you're about to be caught.",
        "Craig: I sure hope not. No, seriously, I haven't done anything except raise the numbers in the second quarter. Montgomery Enterprises is thriving.",
        "Tom: So you're not about to be sued? You've paid your taxes?",
        "Craig: No, everything is shipshape. Everything's fine. I've even put it in writing. If you will check paragraph 14, you'll see it -- the results of the June 1 audit -- they indemnify the signatories. I don't even have to explain this to you. It's very straightforward.",
        "Tom: Straightforward? I doubt Meg's going to agree with that.",
        "Craig: Meg already understands the terms.",
        "Tom: Oh, so she approves this?",
        "Craig: Well no, I didn't want to show her the document until you signed off on it.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm not signing off on anything.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. That was a bad choice of words. Until you've approved the language -- then I'll show it to her.",
        "Tom: Then you'll spring it on her.",
        "Craig: No, Tom -- I'm not trying to hide anything. Feel free -- show this to whoever you want. Whoever you think this might impact, including Margo. As a matter of fact, please, show this to Margo. I would like her to know I'm turning over a new leaf.",
        "Tom: Not that many trees in the forest, Craig.",
        "Craig: It's a gesture, Tom.",
        "Tom: Gestures stop at around $1,000. This is a multi-million dollar transaction.",
        "Craig: Which is worth it to me. I have done an awful lot of things wrong, and I am trying to make amends. I want my family back. I want you to know that this is a serious effort to make up for the things that I've done. I would like my sister to be proud of me.",
        "Tom: That's a nice story. I don't buy it.",
        "Craig: I don't blame you. I've done a lot of things to disappoint you, Margo, a lot of people. I don't blame you for being skeptical, I'm just asking -- is the document legal?",
        "Tom: Well, I don't know. I just skimmed it.",
        "Craig: Please. Would you please examine this?",
        "Tom: I'll take a closer look.",
        "Craig: Thank you. And, you know, I can make any changes that you see fit. And after this is vetted to your satisfaction, would you please just send it over to the folks at Worldwide?",
        "Tom: Don't you mean Montgomery Enterprises?",
        "Craig: You've got to admit, the logo kills.",
        "Tom: If the document checks out, I'll send it to the legal department.",
        "Craig: The board, I think.",
        "Tom: Well, I'll leave that little chore to you if and when the time comes. Oh, and by the way, Craig -- if you are trying to involve me in something underhanded, any chance that you may have had for a rapprochement with my wife will be history.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Good morning.",
        "Brad: About time you showed up.",
        "Katie: Oh, I like that shirt. Is that wardrobe's, or is it yours?",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Katie: It's a winner.",
        "Brad: Yeah? It's a winner?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I like the shirt, Brad.",
        "Brad: Thank you. So why are you so cheery? Something wonderful happen?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Brad: Yes? Care to share?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: No. I always tell you about my good news.",
        "Katie: You always tell everyone. I have a private life.",
        "Brad: Oh, okay. So this is private. Excuse me.",
        "Kim: Oh, good, good. Oh, good morning.",
        "Katie: Good morning. You look great. I love your hair.",
        "Kim: Oh, thank you very much. Actually, you're looking fabulous yourself. All kind of relaxed and rested.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Wonder why.",
        "Katie: I slept like a baby last night.",
        "Kim: Oh, terrific. Well, I'm glad, because we got a lot of promos to shoot here. Can't wait to see all that sunshine on camera.",
        "Brad: How did it go with Jack last night?",
        "Katie: Great. Thanks for asking.",
        "Brad: No worries? Full steam ahead?",
        "Kim: All right. Camera rolling.",
        "Katie: Hi, I'm Katie Peretti, and we hope you'll join us on the next \"Oakdale Now.\" It's June, that means its wedding season. And we are devoting the next week to true love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi. Thanks for coming by, Jack. I'm sorry for the call, and again, I'm sorry for barging in on you last night.",
        "Jack: No, forget it. Where're the calendars?",
        "Carly: Um, they're right over here.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: About last night, Jack -- your brother really got me going. He's the one who told me about Katie.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I didn't think you were speaking to Brad.",
        "Carly: Anyway, that's why I stopped by. I know that I should've called. But I made a mistake, Jack. It really sort of threw me, and I wasn't thinking straight. What's new there? So anyway, I stopped by to see for myself, and it hurt. And I know you're not trying to hurt me, it's just a lot to take in. I'm not used to seeing you with someone else.",
        "Jack: I don't want to discuss Katie.",
        "Carly: Right. I understand.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know how you feel about her, Carly.",
        "Carly: It's not about how I feel, Jack, it's about how you feel.",
        "Jack: How I feel is none of your business.",
        "Carly: Would you just stop it! I'm trying to say something nice here. You looked happy, Jack. And it made me feel better about things, seeing how she makes you feel.",
        "Carly: I'm not saying it's easy seeing you with someone else. It isn't. But I'm happy for you.",
        "Jack: Okay, so what is this? You hand me a visitation schedule and you try to butter me up?",
        "Carly: No. No, I just wanted to --",
        "Jack: You're just giving me your blessing? No thanks.",
        "Carly: I'm not going anywhere, Jack. So we can either do this as friends, or we can make each other miserable.",
        "Jack: Then let's just stick to days and dates. Sage has an after school program that she likes.",
        "Carly: With Mrs. Santos. I know.",
        "Jack: Well, if you know everything, then why are we here?",
        "Carly: Tuesdays. The boys have practice, right? I'd be happy to take them. Isn't that your late night?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, Emma does that, but I'm sure she'd be happy if you wanted to pitch in.",
        "Carly: Good. I will. I'll drive on Tuesdays. Wednesdays?",
        "Jack: Wednesdays. I will e-mail you my work schedule.",
        "Carly: I'll e-mail you mine.",
        "Jack: You're working?",
        "Carly: Well, I will be. I'm looking.",
        "Jack: Fine.",
        "Carly: And you should know that I stopped by the farm last night.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I was looking for you.",
        "Jack: You have my cell phone, right? You have phone numbers?",
        "Carly: I wanted to see the kids, Jack. They weren't there. Emma took them camping. Although I did see Parker, briefly.",
        "Jack: So Parker knows that you're out?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Oh --",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Okay, no --",
        "Carly: It won't happen again. I really felt the need to see them.",
        "Jack: Let me make this very clear to you. You do not see the kids without clearing it with me first, okay?",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "Jack: We stick to a schedule. We make a schedule, we stick to it. They have been through enough without you disrupting their lives every time you get an impulse. It's about them, Carly. You understand? Their needs, not yours.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Of course.",
        "Jack: I'll talk to them today after school, and I'll try to explain everything.",
        "Carly: May I see them tonight?",
        "Jack: J.J. has a baseball game.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. Is he still playing shortstop?",

        "Katie: You're in charge of garters.",
        "Brad: Well, I don't understand what the point is, since 50% of marriages end in divorce, anyway.",
        "Katie: Which means that half our population needs to find love.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well you know what, and divorcees. The rate is even higher.",
        "Katie: Somebody throw this guy a bouquet! Lighten up, Brad. Haven't you heard? Love is in the air.",
        "Kim: Okay -- cut! And that's a wrap. Thanks very much. It was wonderful. I'm going to go to editing and get this on the air right away.",

        "Brad: What?",
        "Katie: That I'm happy.",
        "Brad: I'm trying to make sure that you stay happy. And with Carly back in town and out of jail --",
        "Katie: Oh. Carly is Jack's ex-wife, the mother of his children. She would've been a factor whether she was here or not.",
        "Brad: A factor? A factor? She is a force of nature.",
        "Katie: And that's exactly what Jack is sick of.",
        "Brad: Don't count on it.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. You're not doing this to me today. Not today. You are not ruining my mood.",
        "Brad: Ow. Okay, I'm not trying to ruin your mood, Katie. I am trying to protect you.",
        "Katie: From your brother?",
        "Brad: From Carly. I can only imagine what her face looked like when she saw you two together.",
        "Katie: How do you know she saw us together?",
        "Brad: Because -- we ran into each other at Lakeview and we just got to talking.",
        "Katie: So you're the one who told her that we've been seeing each other?",
        "Brad: She asked.",
        "Katie: And you just had to stick your nose in where it doesn't belong?",

        "Brad: Ow! Thorns! Thorns, okay?",
        "Katie: Oh, good thing we're not promoting steakhouses, otherwise you'd have a knife in your gut. How could you sic Carly on me?",
        "Brad: But see, that's the point. I didn't. She sicced herself and she will continue siccing herself until Jack gives in. And he will.",
        "Katie: Oh, you are -- you know what? You're just -- sad. You're just a sad boy.",
        "Brad: Okay, will you just listen to me just for a second? Okay, just for a second? Okay, I know. I admit it, I was jealous. And I'm childish, immature, all those things. But this is friendship talking, pure and simple. I am worried about you.",
        "Katie: All right. Jack and I are together, whether you like it or not. And yes, we are going to encounter some problems -- some because of Carly, and some because of just normal relationship stuff. But we're going to get through it together, because Jack and I know what we want and we found it. And no one is going to get in the way of that -- not you or Carly or anyone. So just get out of my way.",

        "Barbara: You've also told me that they're not always perfectly accurate. Maybe you had a vision, but it was someone else, not about Meg.",
        "Paul: In the vision, it was just the two of us. And I was putting the ring on her finger.",
        "Barbara: Where are the rings? These are the rings that you bought for your wedding -- of course that upset you. That was a terrible day for both of you.",
        "Paul: It was not a high point.",
        "Barbara: Look, why don't you exchange these? Take them back to the jeweler and exchange them. I don't know why you've held onto them all this time. They cause you so much misery.",
        "Paul: It was supposed to be a second chance.",
        "Barbara: It's a new beginning. The bride will have a new gown and you'll have new rings. Take them back to the jeweler and the visions will go away. I guarantee it.",

And we are going to make sure that she knows all about your play and your dance recital and your baseball games. And you're gonna spend a lot of time with her out at the old house. But we are going to stay where we are at the farm.",

        "Brad: Well, it's Katie. She was so full of herself today. You know, \"Love is in the air\" and all that hogwash. Look, I'm just saying that once Jack gets back with Carly, she's going to come down so hard, you know? And no more smiles. No more of that cutesy stuff that you love that she did today. We're going to have one really depressed co-star. And that's going to affect the work. And the work is what's important, right? Right?",

They wouldn't leave with me even if I wanted them to, Jack. They love you. Please, I just want to read them a story and tuck them in. I'll bring them back to the farm by breakfast, if that's what you want.",
