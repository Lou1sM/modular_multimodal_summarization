        "Henry: Emily, please.",
        "Emily: Henry, gimme the phone.",
        "Henry: I don't have it.",
        "Emily: Henry, I'm going for the pants next.",
        "Henry: What, you have no dignity, woman?",
        "Emily: Gimme your phone. Henry!",
        "Henry: It's dead. It's dead.",
        "Emily: Even a prisoner gets one phone call. The phone!",
        "Henry: Oh, you would -- you would know about that? Listen, there are rules, cell phones, hospitals --",
        "Emily: No, there are not. Not in this ward of the hospital. Give me the phone, Henry!",
        "Henry: There should be a rule, because you're trying to call the guy who put you in here.",
        "Emily: I'm trying to take control of my future.",
        "Henry: How long will that last, Emily? When Paul starts playing Svengali again, you're gonna start ordering the bondage gear off the internet again when we're done.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's nice. Thanks. Thanks for all the faith in me.",
        "Henry: I have faith in you. I have tremendous faith in you, baby. I know that with a little bit of help, you're gonna see that you and Paul are not going down the yellow brick road of life.",
        "Emily: Part of my healing is facing my demons.",
        "Henry: Facing them, yeah. Having them drop in on you is a big mistake.",
        "Emily: You're right. No, you're right. You're right. It is. Calling Paul's a bad idea, it shows weakness, it gives him the upper hand.",
        "Henry: That's my point. That's my point exactly.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you know, the smart thing to do is to make him think it was idea. I mean, that's true empowerment, right. But I'm not the one who can get Paul to come over here. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, I'm really sorry about Jen.",
        "Paul: Look, I should know better, you know? In my family, if you don't get excommunicated five or six times, you're doing something wrong.",
        "Meg: You don't have to act brave for me.",
        "Paul: I'm not acting brave. I am brave. You know why? Because I have you. You know, this baby is gonna grow up with all those little Snyder cousins if I don't blow it and get voted off the island.",
        "Meg: Oh, you'll never be voted off my island. And you know, once mama sees that little baby in her arms, she's gonna melt.",
        "Paul: Does that mean I have to do chores on the farm?",
        "Meg: How are you with a hoe?",
        "Paul: That seems like a very personal question. [Meg laughs] I am sorry. I'm sorry. That was lame.",
        "Meg: That was lame, yeah.",
        "Paul: So lame. All right, you're right. I'm gonna stop whining and I'm gonna celebrate our future together.",
        "Meg: With champagne?",
        "Paul: With champagne.",
        "Meg: Oh.",
        "Paul: And you in my arms.",
        "Meg: Ooh.",
        "Paul: Hey, I just got an idea.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: You wait here.",
        "Jennifer: Yep, that would be mine.",
        "Meg: Oh, it's beautiful.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks. Thanks.",
        "Meg: Ah, you know, Jen, Paul won't admit it, but he keeps dreaming that he's gonna see you get married.",
        "Jennifer: Well that's not gonna happen.",
        "Meg: You know, it's kind of strange, after everything we've been through, we've ended up in the same place.",
        "Jennifer: We have?",
        "Meg: Well, Dusty's raising Craig's child and I'll be raising Emily's with Paul. The kids will be cousins, family. Isn't that enough to keep you from cutting Paul out of your life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I wish I had a camera.",
        "Dusty: Well, I never thought I'd --",
        "Lucy: Run into your old girlfriend? Doesn't that happen to you at least twice a week?",
        "Dusty: Who you staying with? Lucinda?",
        "Lucy: No. I haven't seen her yet. How does she look?",
        "Dusty: Good. So what's this, summer break?",
        "Lucy: No, Dusty, I'm back in Oakdale to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Let's get you up to bed.",
        "Katie: I'm fine.",
        "Mike: No, you need to rest.",
        "Katie: I can rest down here.",
        "Mike: You sure?",
        "Katie: Yeah, the doctor said I'm fine. You don't need to worry so much.",
        "Mike: That's my job.",
        "Katie: Besides, I want to be wide awake in case we hear anything about Carly. I know if it wasn't for her, Nick would still have a gun on me right now.",
        "Mike: I hate that he did that. But Nick would never use that gun. You know that.",
        "Katie: No, I don't know that. He's not the person you thought he was, Mike. He had us all fooled. Now that I see what he's like when he's pushed to the wall, I just pray that Jack finds Carly before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You found the ring right by this rock?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I tried to lift footprints to get a trail, but it stops just past the bushes there. Just too much stone and rock.",
        "Jack: Anything from the air?",
        "Margo: No, I checked with the choppers. We got two teams covering the southern quadrant. But Jack, all we found was the ring.",
        "Jack: She knew what she was doing when she dropped it, Margo. She's trying to lead us to her.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I always figured that, you know, Williams would be too cold for you. Since you were raised in the tropics.",
        "Lucy: Well, Oakdale winters aren't much better.",
        "Dusty: So why don't you go back to Montega?",
        "Lucy: I did. The university accepted my credits and I got into an accelerated program --",
        "Nurse: Here are the forms, Dr. Montgomery.",
        "Dusty: Doctor, huh? What did I miss? You haven't been gone that long. Have you?",
        "Lucy: It's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't spend all your time at the beach. It's been school pretty much year round, weekends, summers. I flew to Paris after my last semester and got into a four-week, ten-hour-a-day clinical. Am I boring you?",
        "Dusty: No, you never bored me. You know that.",
        "Lucy: Well, they had an opening at Memorial and with my grandmother's illness, I thought it was a good time to come back to Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: Does Lucinda know?",
        "Lucy: No, I haven't told her. I asked Dr. Hughes not to tell anyone. I want to surprise her.",
        "Dusty: So you're here alone?",
        "Lucy: Not at the moment.",
        "Dusty: You still with that guy from Williams?",
        "Lucy: No. No, Ned got tired of waiting for me to come out of the bio lab. I've been on my own, Dusty, for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Wow, well if you and Paul want to raise his child, I certainly can't stop you. But that doesn't mean I have to accept you as part of my family.",
        "Meg: But I thought you had forgiven Paul.",
        "Jennifer: I have come to terms with what he's done, but it doesn't mean that I want him in my life.",
        "Meg: That's Dusty talking.",
        "Jennifer: That's my decision.",
        "Meg: Your brother loves you, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, well, we'll see if you feel that way after Paul goes behind your back or lies to protect you or makes decisions about your life and calls it love. Then maybe you'll see how I feel.",
        "Paul: I didn't sense a thaw.",
        "Meg: I tried.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Meg: And I'll keep on trying.",
        "Paul: It's hopeless.",
        "Meg: No, nothing is hopeless.",
        "Paul: I'm in love with an optimist.",
        "Meg: Some people find you irresistible, Ryan. Um, so where's my champagne?",
        "Paul: In the wine cellar.",
        "Meg: Well, you know, if we want, we can pop the cork sooner rather than later, I haven't checked out of my room yet.",
        "Paul: Interesting.",
        "Meg: Yeah, we don't have to drive all the way across town.",
        "Paul: What a great idea. Why don't you go upstairs and I'll wait here for the sommelier. You know, the wine guy.",
        "Meg: I love you.",
        "Paul: I won't be long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You okay?",
        "Mike: I'm the one who's supposed to be taking care of you, remember?",
        "Katie: We're married. We take care of each other. Remember?",
        "Mike: I haven't done a very good job on my end lately.",
        "Katie: Mike, this is not your fault.",
        "Mike: Nick was a wild kid. We both were. But he's got a good heart.",
        "Katie: He buried a girl in a wall and kept it secret for years. Do you have any idea what her poor family has been through over the past 13 years?",
        "Mike: Whatever happened with Maya Gold had to have been an accident. Nick is not a cold-blooded killer.",
        "Katie: Honey, you see the best in people, and I love that about you. But Nick took advantage of that.",
        "Mike: Katie, when I went halfway around the world, I trusted Nick to look after you. You, the most important person in my life, the woman I love more than my own life. I don't know what happened with Maya, but I couldn't be that wrong about Nick. I just couldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did they go over the perimeter again?",
        "Margo: Yes. Jack, Nick is very good at covering his tracks.",
        "Jack: She's close, Margo.",
        "Margo: You don't know that. Depending on when she dropped that ring, they could be halfway to Canada by now. Come on, Jack, why don't you come back to the station with me?",
        "Jack: No, I'm not leaving the field.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Margo: Hold on. Hughes. Yeah.",
        "[Jack remembering]",
        "Carly: You're my true north, Jack.",
        "Margo: Okay, they're putting together another team to cover the western sector.",
        "Jack: Fine. I'm gonna head north.",
        "Margo: I'll go with you.",
        "Jack: No, Margo, I have to do this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm coming home, Jack. [Carly groans] I feel these tingling sensations",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry it didn't work for you and your boyfriend. I thought it was serious.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I did, too. But I realize that breaking up with him was the best thing that ever happened to me. Second best.",
        "Dusty: Does he agree?",
        "Lucy: If I wasted any more time trying to figure what makes him happy, I would never have figured out what makes me happy. And I might never have become a doctor.",
        "Dusty: You really love it, huh?",
        "Lucy: I really do.",
        "Dusty: Well, that makes sense. You were always the smartest nerd in your class.",
        "Lucy: Is that a compliment?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's a compliment.",
        "Lucy: You know what I really learned these past few years? How to be alone and like it. I guess I've finally grown up.",
        "Dusty: I'm glad you're happy.",
        "Lucy: You are, too, I hope.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, very.",
        "Lucy: You want to fill me in over coffee?",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, I can't. I've got an appointment.",
        "Lucy: Are you okay?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. It's not for me.",
        "Kim: Ooh. Here's Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Come here, little buddy.",
        "Kim: There ya go.",
        "Dusty: How are ya?",
        "Kim: Lucy, hi! Bob said you were back.",
        "Lucy: It's so good to see you.",
        "Kim: Oops. I'm sorry I dropped it. Well, you know what, I'm gonna leave all his stuff with you. I'm so glad to see you. You look wonderful.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, thank you.",
        "Dusty: I was just asking for directions.",
        "Kim: Oh, a man who asks directions?",
        "Lucy: I'm impressed.",
        "Kim: I don't believe it.",
        "Dusty: Heads up, Johnny, they're ganging up on us.",
        "Lucy: So who is this little charmer? What's he doing in your arms?",
        "Kim: Oh, you two haven't been introduced yet, I guess.",
        "Lucy: No, no, we haven't. He's adorable.",
        "Dusty: Johnny, this is Lucy. Lucy, this is John Dustin. He's Jennifer's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'll take this upstairs.",
        "Waiter: Thank you, Mr. Ryan.",
        "Henry: Impressive. You gonna drink that all by yourself or are you and Meg celebrating something?",
        "Paul: I don't think that's any of your business.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on let a guy for live vicariously here. You've got imported champagne and a leggy brunette.",
        "Paul: Henry, get a life.",
        "Henry: Some of us are too busy cleaning up after your messes to get a life, Paul.",
        "Paul: Oh, you've been speaking with Emily?",
        "Henry: Oh, just left her.",
        "Paul: How is she?",
        "Henry: Well, she's not swilling $300 champagne.",
        "Paul: But she's okay?",
        "Henry: Okay? She's a little down, actually. But I hear that's normal after a major psychotic break.",
        "Paul: What did the doctors say?",
        "Henry: I don't know. Why don't you ask them? All 20 of them, actually. She sees more doctors than the golf pro down at the country club.",
        "Paul: Henry, what do you want?",
        "Henry: I don't want anything. And don't worry about Emily. Don't give her a second thought. You know our Em. She's gonna bounce out of that hospital bed and squeeze those lemons until she gets something good to drink.",
        "Paul: Look, I'll call her tomorrow.",
        "Henry: Okay, I understand. You've got more pressing matters than checking in on the mother of your child.",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Meg: I was wondering what was taking so long.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry. Blame the warm champagne on me.",
        "Paul: Henry just came from Emily.",
        "Henry: She's fine, Meg, thank you for asking.",
        "Paul: He thinks that I should go see her.",
        "Henry: I never said should.",
        "Meg: Maybe Henry's right.",
        "Paul: No, we have plans.",
        "Meg: Our plans can wait. If something's going wrong with Emily and the baby, I don't want to hear it second hand. Besides, Paul, this is our baby now. I think you should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly? You okay? Carly! Oh, God. Please be all right. Carly. Carly. Carly, honey. Honey, oh, hey.",
        "Carly: Jack.",

        "Carly: Nick -- I tried to stop him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know, its okay. It's okay. You're safe now. He can't hurt you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I want Carly home safe just as much as you do. But I don't want Nick hunted down like an animal. Can you understand that?",
        "Katie: Of course I understand. I think I am gonna go up to bed, and I'm gonna take a nice long bath first, okay?",
        "Mike: You're mad?",
        "Katie: No, I'm not mad. I'm just exhausted, okay? It's so good to be home.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Mike: Hello.",
        "Nick: Mike, it's me.",
        "Mike: Nick, where are you?",
        "Nick: Man, I am so sorry.",
        "Mike: Just tell me.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry about Maya. I didn't mean for you to take the blame.",
        "Mike: We can figure this out, I've just gotta know where you are.",
        "Nick: I gotta go.",
        "Mike: Nick, don't hang up.",
        "Nick: They're probably tracing the phone call.",
        "Mike: I'll help you through this, I promise you, Nick. Just trust me.",

        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Dusty: It's the way we want it, and it's the way it's gotta stay.",
        "Lucy: We?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer and I. We're getting married.",
        "Emily: Looks like today's a big day for decisions. Would you like to hear mine?",
        "Carly: Jack, please forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Mike, you can't help me. I've got to keep moving.",

        "Nick: I'm safe for now.",
        "Mike: Nick.",
        "Nick: Mike, I don't have enough time. I want you to know about Maya. I never meant to hurt her, I swear.",
        "Mike: I know that. Nick, you're family. We can fix this.",
        "Nick: It's gone too far. Carly's messed up. And Katie -- oh, God, man, you must hate me.",
        "Mike: I don't hate you.",
        "Nick: I never meant for it to get so out of control.",
        "Mike: I know that.",
        "Nick: But Carly went nuts. She hit a tree. She could've killed us.",
        "Mike: Just tell me where you are. So I'll come and we'll talk.",
        "Nick: Mike, no. No cops.",
        "Mike: Just me. I won't bring cops. It'll be me and you. Nick, you're like my brother. I am not out to punish you. I am the best chance you've got. Please, let me help you.",
        "Nick: I'm in a fishing shed. About four miles north of route 23.",
        "Mike: Near Myers Lake?",
        "Nick: Yeah, on the east side.",
        "Mike: Where we used to go when were kids.",

        "Jack: You did the right thing.",
        "Carly: Katie --",
        "Jack: Katie's fine. You don't always have to be so brave, you know.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: No, not brave.",
        "Jack: You are the bravest person I know. You know, in my business, they give out --",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "Jack: I know, I know -- honey, honey -- I know, I know. Shh, shh, shh. I have to put a little pressure on it, that's all. I'm sorry. They give out medals for what you did. Okay. I know. I know. That should be good for now. All right, listen. I've gotta call Margo. I'll be back in a second, okay? Here's the water right here.",
        "Carly: Don't go.",
        "Jack: No, no, honey, honey. I can't get a signal in here. I gotta go outside, okay? I promise you, just a minute. Just a minute. Yeah, Margo, I found her. She's alive, but she's in bad shape, part of her leg's pretty chewed up. We're in a cave exactly nine-tenths of a mile due north of the furthest perimeter marked by Taylor and his team. She's gonna need to be MedEvaced to Memorial. Yea, but you gotta get here fast. She's -- she's not in good shape. Thanks. Okay. It's all right.",
        "Carly: Jack. Nick --",
        "Jack: No, don't worry about him. Don't worry about him. The entire force is out looking for him. He's not gonna get very far. Okay, you just worry about getting back to Parker and J.J. and Sage. They love you so much.",

        "Dusty: What do you think, J.D.? Huh? Yeah, he says it's cool. [Johnny fusses] Here, yeah. Meet Lucy.",
        "Lucy: So you speak baby talk now?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's my second language.",
        "Lucy: You are Dusty Donovan, right?",
        "Dusty: That's what it says on my license.",

        "Nick: No.",
        "Mike: Nick, why didn't you call for help?",

        "Mike: I told you, I could never hate you.",

        "Emily: A child deserves a mother and father.",
        "Paul: I agree. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that that happens. Believe me, I'm as surprised by this decision as you are.",

They run down -- they run down the driveway alongside a shaky two wheeler bike waiting for their child to learn how to ride a bike. But I'm not going to be there for any of that. Because you want me to give -- you want me to carry this child and give birth and hand it over to you and Meg?",
