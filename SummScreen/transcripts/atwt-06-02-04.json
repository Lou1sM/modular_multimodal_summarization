        "Chris: Well --",
        "Alison: Oh! I get it. You wanted to carry me over the threshold. Chris, you're so sweet! Even though this is, like, our third threshold. Take me away!",
        "Chris: Uh -- that's a great idea, Alison.",
        "Alison: Did you change your mind?",

        "Tom: Hi. I am.",
        "Jill: I served her not too long ago. In fact, I was looking for her myself. She forgot to sign her check.",
        "Tom: Ah, I'll take care of that. Did you happen to see where she went?",
        "Jill: I'm pretty sure she's still changing.",
        "Tom: Oh, good. Then I'm gonna go find her.",
        "Jill: No. You'd better let me do that. No men allowed in the ladies' locker room.",

        "Dusty: Well, I don't know what else to say. You have everything you need for your police report, right?",
        "Hal: Right, with a description that basically amounts to generic goons one and two, dusty.",
        "Molly: Why are you letting Starziak get away with this?",
        "Hal: Who's Starziak?",
        "Dusty: Nobody. You have no idea what you're talking --",
        "Lily: Starziak is responsible for what happened to Lucy?",
        "Hal: What do you know about this guy?",
        "Dusty: She knows nothing, 'cause we know --",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Let me speak. Starziak was laundering money through the rose foundation. One of Dusty's old friends.",

        "Lucy: Well, Daddy, I was planning on going back to Montega tomorrow, anyway. What does it matter if I leave this afternoon with Mom?",
        "Craig: But you said -- I thought -- oh, excuse me.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, are you all right?",
        "Craig: No, I have to make a call.",
        "Lucy: He seems pretty upset. Maybe I should just go talk to him --",

        "Jordan: I wanted to arrange to see Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: When?",
        "Jordan: Today.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you can't see the baby today. We're moving to Fairwinds today.",
        "Jordan: That's why I thought it would be a good idea. You'll be organizing the move, and the baby doesn't need to be in the middle of all that.",
        "Carly: Don't fight him on this. If he wants to see Cabot, let him see Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Cabot is napping right now. Perhaps we could arrange a time for you to see him tomorrow.",
        "Jordan: Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I will be coming to see my son today, within the hour.",
        "Rosanna: All right, then. I can delay my plans until your visit is over.",
        "Jordan: No, no. That's not necessary. I want to spend some time alone with Cabot. I don't want you there.",

        "Alison: What happened with my mom?",
        "Chris: Well -- when I walked in, I think she was a little surprised to see me.",
        "Alison: Oh, that's my fault. I didn't get a chance to tell her that you were coming.",
        "Chris: Susan doesn't know that I'm moving in here with you?",
        "Alison: Well, I left her a note, but I guess she didn't get a chance to read it. But don't worry. She's not gonna care, Chris.",
        "Chris: You wanna bet?",
        "Alison: Chris, my mom loves you! And it was her idea for us to move in there, anyway.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, that was before.",
        "Alison: Before what? Chris, whatever weird thing my mom said to you, we'll deal with it, okay? Come on. Mom! Mom?",
        "Susan: Hi, sweetie. Did you just get here?",
        "Alison: Mom, you know that we didn't just get here. You talked to Chris.",
        "Susan: No, I didn't.",
        "Alison: Yes, you did.",
        "Susan: No, I didn't.",

        "Susan: Honey, I wasn't expecting anybody except you. So when he walked in, I certainly didn't mean to be --",
        "Alison: To be what?",
        "Susan: -- Naked.",

        "Rosanna: Jordan, you don't know anything about handling a baby.",
        "Jordan: Well, then I guess it's time I learned.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you're not gonna practice on my son.",
        "Jordan: Whose son?",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. You know what I meant. Look, I'll wait in the other room. You can have your visit, and then I'll come out. I mean, I promise I won't interfere.",
        "Jordan: Given everything that's happened, I think it's best if I see as little as possible of you right now. I am not asking you for the damn moon, Rosanna. Fathers do spend time alone with their kids.",
        "Rosanna: But --",
        "Jordan: This is not negotiable.",
        "Rosanna: Give me a minute. I can't -- I can't do this.",
        "Carly: All he wants is a little time with his son. With any luck, Cabot will tinkle on his wingtips and throw up on his Armani, and you'll never have to go through this again.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, I'm sorry. I was just afraid you wouldn't be able to handle it if Cabot started crying or needed changing. That's all.",
        "Jordan: I think I can handle it.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Good-bye. [Rosanna sighs] I don't like this.",
        "Carly: You don't have a choice. Jordan is Cabot's father, right down to the DNA.",
        "Rosanna: Paul and I never should have kept that information from him. He was so angry on the phone.",
        "Carly: Well, now's your chance to make nice.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I don't know. I don't have a good feeling about this.",
        "Carly: What are you so afraid of? Rosanna, there's a guard posted down the hall. It's not like Jordan can steal the baby.",
        "Rosanna: No, that's -- that's not it. That's not what I'm afraid at all.",

        "Jordan: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: So we're back to being discreet?",
        "Jordan: Well, until I can get you alone, yes. Thanks for meeting me.",
        "Jennifer: Sure. You look tired.",
        "Jordan: Ah, well, I spent the night at B.R.O., and I didn't get much sleep.",
        "Jennifer: So you're putting some space between you and Rosanna?",
        "Jordan: Yeah, I didn't wanna go back to that suite. I needed some time alone to think about -- everything.",
        "Jennifer: Well, did you make any decisions?",
        "Jordan: A few. You know, I'm still pretty ticked off about what Rosanna and Paul did, but that's really not what's important here. I have a son, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: I know. This is huge.",
        "Jordan: It's overwhelming.",
        "Jennifer: Yes. But you'll get the hang of it.",
        "Jordan: I'd better.",
        "Jennifer: Did you -- never mind. Never mind. You don't need me grilling you. You have enough to think about.",
        "Jordan: Look, I don't want you to ever think that there's something that you can't say to me. I might be a little shell-shocked right now, but I'm really glad that you're here. And I'm really glad that I don't have to go through this alone.",
        "Jennifer: Me, too.",
        "Jordan: So, what did you want to ask me?",
        "Jennifer: Did you remember anything else about Cabot's birth mother?",
        "[Jordan sighs]",
        "Jordan: You know, I mean, I practically stared at that birth certificate all night. And the name \"Jane Currier\" means absolutely nothing to me. I don't know how that could be. I made a baby with the woman.",
        "Jennifer: Well, she might not have given you her real name.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, but, you know, I've always been really careful. You know, I don't know how this could've happened. I guess I'm not the first guy to say that.",
        "[Jordan laughs]",
        "Jennifer: So what are you gonna do now that you have this little baby in your life?",
        "Jordan: I don't know yet. But I want to get to know him. I'm gonna go head over there in a few minutes, actually.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Oh, I thought that --",
        "Jordan: Oh, did you think we were having lunch? Oh, I should have said --",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay, yeah. Don't worry. You go see your son and have a good time.",
        "Jordan: Do you want to come with me?",
        "Jennifer: You -- Jordan, you don't have to say that just because --",
        "Jordan: No, that's why I -- that's why I asked you to meet me. I want you to be there when I see Cabot.",
        "Jennifer: Are you sure?",
        "Jordan: I'm meeting my son basically for the first time. I mean, how many moments in life are bigger than that? I want you to be there with me.",
        "Jennifer: Really?",
        "Jordan: I wouldn't have known about any of this if it weren't for you. And I don't know how I'm ever gonna be able to repay you for it.",
        "Jennifer: Do you think that Cabot will mind if I kiss you when we get there?",
        "Jordan: My son would probably think that's a great idea.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then, let's hurry up and get there.",

        "[Knocking at door]",

        "Margo: Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.",

        "Margo: Yeah, yeah!",
        "Jill: You had me worried. I was about to call security.",
        "Margo: No, no, there's no need to do that. I'm fine.",
        "Jill: I had this image of you being attacked or --",
        "Margo: No, no. I just -- you know, I guess I locked the door by accident. And then I couldn't hear you over the hair dryer.",
        "Jill: Oh. Are you okay?",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",
        "Jill: Okay, um -- [Whispering] There's -- there's a man in here.",
        "Margo: Yes, there is. There's no need to do that. I -- its fine. He's a friend of mine.",
        "Jill: Mr. Reese.",
        "Doc: Oh, my apologies. I really didn't mean to frighten you.",
        "Jill: Oh, no, no. No, you didn't. It was just a little odd finding you here in the ladies' locker room.",
        "Margo: Well, I can explain that.",
        "Doc: Oh, actually, it's my fault. I needed some legal advice on the qt, of course. And I'm sure you can discern that, me being a celebrity, there's some things I can't really discuss in public.",
        "Jill: Sure.",
        "Margo: So, Jill, you wanted to see me?",
        "Jill: Uh, yeah. Oh! You forgot to sign your check and --",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm so sorry. All right. Well, I'm out of here.",
        "Doc: But our conversation --",
        "Margo: I think that we've said everything we need to say to each other. And this never needs to happen again. Um -- there.",
        "Jill: Maybe you should go, too. I mean, some of the older ladies might have palpitations if they walk in and see you.",
        "Doc: And the younger ladies?",
        "Jill: Would wonder how they got so lucky.",
        "Doc: Mm. Jill, is it? I do hope I can count on your discretion in this situation. In fact, I'll consider it a personal favor. A personal favor I'd be more than happy to return someday.",
        "Jill: Well, then I won't say a word. In fact, I mean, nobody even knows I'm here except -- oh! Oh, I forgot to tell her.",
        "Doc: What?",
        "Jill: Her husband's here.",
        "Tom: Hi.",
        "Margo: Tom! Oh. Where'd you come from?",
        "Tom: What's wrong?",
        "Margo: I didn't expect to see you. I thought you were still in court.",
        "Tom: Well, honey, you're shaking.",
        "Margo: I'm so dehydrated. I just finished playing the tennis and -- where's the bartender? We've gotta pay the bill. I'm late.",
        "Tom: For what? I thought you had the afternoon off from work.",
        "Margo: I do. It's just -- I've got a lot to do at home. Where is he?",
        "Tom: Hey, I already took care of the check. Didn't the waitress tell you?",
        "Margo: You saw Jill?",
        "Tom: Yeah, I saw Jill. I'm the one that sent her out to find you. Didn't you see her?",
        "Margo: I did, yes. I forgot.",
        "Tom: Honey, you are shaking like a leaf. There's obviously something wrong. Tell me what happened.",

        "Chris: It could have happened to anybody.",
        "Alison: Not your mom, not in your house.",
        "Susan: That's because Kim hasn't been naked in her living room since 1956. No offense.",
        "Chris: None taken. Ali, look, this is really no big deal. Right?",
        "Alison: Mom, do you have to say that word?!",
        "Chris: Look, once I move in here, we'll --",
        "Susan: Once you move in here?",

        "Alison: Oh, this is a nightmare!",
        "Susan: What did the note say?",
        "Chris: We decided to take you up on your offer to move in here -- I mean, if it's still okay.",
        "Susan: Oh, that's terrific! I've been so lonely, just rattling around this old house.",
        "Alison: Wearing nothing but a towel?",
        "Susan: Well, after you move in, I'll only do that every other Tuesday.",
        "Alison: Mom, that's not funny.",
        "Susan: Chris, how about some taco salad?",
        "Alison: Mom!",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Alison: Clothes!",

        "Susan: Welcome. Oh.",
        "Alison: Why does this keep happening to us?!",
        "Chris: It's not that bad.",
        "Alison: Chris, you used to be my sister's boyfriend. Now you're my boyfriend. Now you just saw my mom naked. That's not normal. And what is your mom gonna say when she hears about this?",
        "Chris: Alison, I'm not gonna take out an ad. It's --",
        "Alison: No, this is an omen.",
        "Chris: There you go again with the omens. Look, every bad thing that happens to us is not an omen.",
        "Alison: Then why do we have all this bad luck?",
        "Chris: Because we're -- interesting.",
        "Alison: No, we're cursed. And do you know what that means?",
        "Chris: Do I want to know?",
        "Alison: It means that we have to do something huge so we can undo all of this bad luck that we keep getting.",
        "Chris: Like what?",
        "Alison: Maybe we should decide that the best thing to do is just not to live together.",

        "Lily: It's not Craig's fault.",
        "Lucy: Try telling her that. She's definitely not buying anything he's saying.",
