        "Casey: Mom -- Mom. All right, fine. Cool? Or cooler?",
        "Margo: Oh, it doesn't matter. Just show me that beautiful smile.",
        "Casey: Mom, I'm a guy, all right? I'm not after beautiful. I'm after smooth.",
        "Margo: Okay, okay. Well, give it up for camera, Mr. Smooth.",
        "Casey: Mom, all right, fine.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, oh --",
        "Casey: You know what? Give the video camera a rest. Gosh.",
        "Tom: All right, I got provisions.",
        "Margo: Good. It's about time. Say, honey -- is it nice and sunny out there?",
        "Tom: Ah, no.",
        "Margo: Then why do you suppose our son wants to wear his sunglasses to the prom?",
        "Tom: Well, there's a good reason for that. The paparazzi is already camped out in the front yard.",
        "Margo: Oh, but then they'll miss these beautiful eyes and this face. Oh, this face!",
        "Casey: Don't you two have stuff to do for the party? I mean, people are gonna be here any minute.",
        "Margo: People, or Celia? [Casey laughs mockingly] All right, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: Alison, is Celia ready to go?",
        "Alison: Lip gloss -- oh, just one more second. Prepare to be amazed.",
        "Sierra: Are you sure it's a good idea to break the news to her tonight on her prom? It's such a big night for --",
        "Rafael: I know, but what are my choices?",
        "Sierra: I just don't to see her upset.",
        "Rafael: I'll make her understand.",
        "Alison: Presenting Oakdale Latin's next prom queen, Celia Ortega!",
        "Rafael: Celia. Que bella.",
        "Sierra: You look beautiful, sweetheart. Really beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Burt.",
        "Burt: What now?",
        "Gwen: Could you -- could you -- could you help me out a little bit? I've been trying to do it myself, but I can't get the top button going.",
        "Burt: I'm busy. Besides, I've got motor oil all over my hands. Fancy dress.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, there's this big dance at my school tonight.",
        "Burt: Funny you can find the cash to buy something like that when you're two months behind on your rent.",
        "Gwen: You know, it's borrowed.",
        "Burt: Maybe you should think about borrowing some money, too. That way you can keep a roof over your head.",
        "Gwen: Look, can we not do this right now? Look, I'm gonna be late if I don't get this button, so can you just help me out so I can get out of here, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Wow! Look how handsome you look.",
        "Will: Thanks. And thanks, by the way, for being really cool about the decoration party.",
        "Barbara: Well, it was my pleasure. You mind if I take a picture of you looking so handsome?",
        "Will: I guess not.",
        "[Camera beeps]",
        "Barbara: There you go. So, where's your date?",
        "Will: I'm picking her up, and then we're going to Casey's.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Oh, Tom and Margo are having a pre-prom party for you guys?",
        "Will: Yeah, but it's really not that big of a deal.",
        "Barbara: Okay. In that case, you won't mind if I tag along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey, waiting for Will?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "Emily: You don't know if you're waiting for Will?",
        "Paul: I don't know if Will's in there or not. I just -- I needed a minute.",
        "Emily: Oh, no. Oh, no. You were feeling so good just that little while ago, and then Jennifer showed up, and now you're back to brooding. What happened?",
        "Paul: I've been processing it all day, and I don't know what to make of this.",
        "Emily: Make of what? What happened? Did Barbara do something?",
        "Paul: Rosanna's back.",
        "Emily: What? Why? What does she want?",
        "Paul: Apparently, me.",

        "Mike: You okay?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Oh, I was dreaming, I guess. When did you get home?",
        "Mike: Just now. Did you see Dr. Schiller today?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, yeah. I had my check-up right before I came home.",
        "Mike: Everything all right?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I'm fine. The baby's kicking up a storm. I'm just so tired. I must have conked out.",
        "Mike: I wonder why? You barely slept last night.",
        "Jennifer: That was in my dream. I dreamt I was humming and rocking it, and then I looked inside, and there was nothing. There was no baby, nothing.",
        "Mike: Seeing Rosanna yesterday got you all riled up.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. I can't help feeling that she -- she was in touch with Craig.",
        "Mike: But didn't Paul say there's no chance Craig could come back? All right. So you're worrying over nothing",
        "[Jennifer sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rosanna: Phyllis, is that you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, I really don't think it's such a good idea that you come to the party.",
        "Barbara: Well, honey, you just said that --",
        "Will: But it's being called a before-party, but it's really just a big photo op. And besides, Dad and Emily are gonna be there. I just don't think that --",
        "Barbara: Okay, well, sure, sure, sure. I understand. Besides, I need to stay here with my chaperone duties. And I can get plenty of pictures during the dance.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Barbara: Is that for your date, that corsage?",
        "Will: Yes, it is.",
        "Barbara: You have grown into such a wonderful young gentleman. I'm very proud of you. And I will be here when you get back. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I'm sorry. I try not to bother you that much, but I can't get it buttoned, and I don't want to tear the dress.",
        "Burt: Don't worry about it. I've got four girls at home, and I go through that with them all the time. Just let me clean up my hands, and I'll be with you in a second.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Gwen: Hello?",
        "Will: Hey, Gwen. So, I was gonna pick you up, and then I realized I don't know your address.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no. Don't worry about it. You don't have to pick me up. I'm on my way. I'll just meet you at the prom.",
        "Will: You didn't forget about Casey's party, did you?",
        "Gwen: Right. No, no.",
        "Will: You know he's on pinewood?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. No, I remember. I'll see you there.",
        "Burt: Clean.",
        "Gwen: Be careful.",
        "Burt: It's a little tight. There you go.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. Look, I'll give you the rent as soon as I get it. I'm working a lot of jobs right now, and my band even gets a gig every now and then.",
        "Burt: Well, you better make it snappy. Otherwise, you're gonna have to find someplace else to live.",
        "Gwen: I'm working on that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, you all set?",
        "Casey: Yup. Just making sure I have all my cuts.",
        "Tom: Okay. So, what is the drill? The limousine picks you up here at the house, takes you to the prom, and then what?",
        "Casey: Well, we already talked about this. The after-party is at Braden's parents' lake house. His mom's having breakfast catered for us. And then, we'll probably just do a bonfire on the dunes and chill all night.",
        "Margo: Yeah. So that sounds really romantic.",
        "Casey: Whatever.",
        "Margo: And Celia's brother is okay with this?",
        "Casey: She talked to him about it. I guess he trusts me now.",
        "Tom: Well, what's not to trust? Listen, you need to act responsibly. I know prom night's a big night, and all that --",
        "Casey: Just calm down, guys. You don't have to give me the big talk.",
        "Tom: Okay, I guess we'll move to item two. What is next on the nagging parents' checklist, honey?",
        "Margo: Drinking and driving.",
        "Tom: Yeah, don't do it. Be careful.",
        "Casey: I will.",
        "Tom: Be very, very careful.",
        "Casey: I will, all right? And for the record? For nagging parents, you guys are pretty cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Where does that woman get the nerve to come back to this town, much less to worm her way back into your life?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Emily: Well, you're not gonna go see her, are you?",
        "Paul: I went by Fairwinds, okay? And I was gonna storm in there and blast her, tell her to stay out of my life. But I'm not so sure that I can handle that, you know, right now -- seeing her face-to-face. What are you doing?",
        "Emily: We're gonna nip this right in the bud.",
        "Paul: Who are you calling?",
        "Emily: Hal. I'm gonna tell him Rosanna's back, and I want to press charges.",
        "Paul: Oh, Emily, please. Please, don't that.",
        "Emily: Well, you think I'm gonna let her get away with this?",
        "Paul: I just -- I shouldn't have said anything. You've got to give me some time to think about this. The last thing I need right now is you confusing things and making things more complicated.",
        "Emily: What, me? You're gonna let her get away with what she did to us? What the hell is it gonna take to get that woman out of your system once and for all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I thought I told you to stay in Bangkok until I called you.",
        "Craig: You've told me lots of things over the years. If only enough, though, you know. My passport worked, and immigration didn't even look at me twice.",
        "Rosanna: How's that possible?",
        "Craig: I'm fine now. So, aren't you moderately happy to see me?",
        "Rosanna: Well, sure I am. I'm just surprised. That's all.",
        "Craig: You seem sad.",
        "Rosanna: I am. I was looking at this photo album, and I ran across some pictures of Cabot.",
        "Craig: Agency place him?",
        "Rosanna: No. Well, I don't know, actually. I don't know where he is. I just know that he's in a safe home, that's all. And that's all that matters.",
        "Craig: Well, apparently, that's not all that matters. Otherwise, you wouldn't have run out on me in Bangkok. Did you come back for Paul Ryan?",
        "Rosanna: So what if I did?",
        "Craig: That's a mistake. He doesn't deserve you, you know?",
        "Rosanna: Well, he didn't deserve to have his heart ripped out. I think I could at least try to make it up to him.",
        "Craig: Well, knock yourself out, but be careful.",
        "Rosanna: Why? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Craig: Amongst all his other sterling qualities, he's a Stenbeck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Forget it. I can't -- I can't do this now. Tell Will -- tell Will that I'll catch up with him later.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. Wait, you can't! We can't go. It's Will's big prom night. Come on.",
        "Paul: Well, Hal will take pictures.",
        "Emily: We need to talk about this.",
        "Paul: Not here.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine, I'll call Hal from the car. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: You're not changing your mind about letting me stay out tonight, are you?",
        "Rafael: Something's come up, Celia.",
        "Celia: I knew it was too good to be true.",
        "Alison: Rafael, all the kids go to the after-parties. They all stay out all night. It's like a tradition.",
        "Sierra: Why don't you let Rafael finish? This is -- this is difficult for him.",
        "Celia: Something's wrong, isn't it? Look at me, Rafael. Has something happened to Mami?",
        "Rafael: No, no, Mami's fine. Everybody's fine. It's about me. I got reinstated. I can professionally box again.",
        "Celia: That's great! Isn't it?",
        "Rafael: Yeah, I even have my first few fights lined up already.",
        "Celia: Then how come you look so sad?",
        "Rafael: I have to start from the bottom. That means traveling all over again.",
        "Celia: Starting when?",
        "Rafael: Tomorrow morning.",
        "Celia: Oh. That's why you don't want me to stay out late, but I can come home before you go, Rafael. I can skip the breakfast in the morning. Just --",
        "Rafael: There's more, Celia. Once I'm gone, you're gonna have to move, too.",
        "Celia: No. You can't send me back to Montega. My life is here now, Rafael. I have friends, a new school.",
        "Alison: What if Celia stays with me? We can be roommates while Aaron's gone. I can find her some work she can do around here after school.",
        "Rafael: Wait a minute.",
        "Sierra: Listen, you're all getting ahead of yourself. Listen, Celia, I've spoken to your mother, and she said that she will allow you to stay here with us at my mother's, if you want to.",
        "Celia: If I want to? Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Hello?",
        "Zach: Dude, where are you? We're ready to do a sound check.",
        "Casey: Chill out, man. I'll be right there.",
        "Josh: Dude, ask him about plan \"B.\"",
        "Zach: Did you talk to your lady yet about, you know, after the prom? That arrangement we made?",
        "Casey: No, she's not here yet, but I'm gonna -- I'm going to. Actually, dude, I think she's here right now. I've gotta let you go. Bye.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Casey.",
        "Casey: Where's Will?",
        "Gwen: Oh, gee, thanks. You look really nice, too.",
        "Casey: Sorry. I don't know. That's a nice dress.",
        "Gwen: Well, forget about it.",
        "Casey: So, where is Will?",
        "Gwen: He's on his way. I told him he didn't have to pick me up.",
        "Casey: Well, you're the first one here. You can go on in if you want.",
        "Gwen: Alone?",
        "Casey: My parents are in there. What's the big deal? You had a good time being friends with them at the wedding.",
        "Gwen: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Casey: Nothing. I just don't get why, all of a sudden, you're afraid to be alone with them.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I don't get you, Casey. I thought that ever since the wedding, we were gonna try to be friends, so how come you act like you just want me to drop off the face of the planet whenever you look at me? I just want to talk.",
        "Casey: Again?",
        "Gwen: Get over yourself. I'm not a stalker.",
        "Casey: Then you know what? Why don't you just say what you have to say, and stop with all the mystery?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I think I'm gonna have to start shopping for some new clothes.",
        "Mike: Don't you run a fashion house?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, but not for maternity clothes. And how am I gonna look pitching to investors wearing your old shirts?",
        "Mike: Pretty sexy, if you ask me. And they're not old. They are comfortable.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, they are very, very comfortable. Especially for something made in the stone ages.",
        "Mike: So, maybe we need to add a line of preggie-wear to your label.",
        "Jennifer: \"Preggie-wear\"? Yeah, I'm sure Dusty would love peddling jeans with expansion panels in the tummy. God, it feels good to laugh after that nightmare.",
        "Mike: It was just a dream. This baby's gonna be fine.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, especially if Craig stays away. Rosanna showing up makes me afraid of Craig showing up. And we don't even know why he left town in the first place. What makes us so sure that he's not gonna come back?",
        "Mike: For Craig to disappear after being so bound and determined to be in our baby's life, whatever sent him packing must have been pretty bad. I don't see what could bring him back here after that, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I'm not afraid of Paul's anger.",
        "Craig: All right.",
        "Rosanna: Paul has every right to be angry with me. He believes I hated him so much that I tried to destroy him. He believes I drugged Emily and forced her to haunt me.",
        "Craig: And you didn't?",
        "Rosanna: No, of course I didn't. It was Barbara all along.",
        "Craig: You took the fall?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, because James had Cabot, and he told me that couldn't get Cabot back unless I got Barbara off the hook.",
        "Craig: So, you will tell Paul it wasn't you who broke his heart after all, and hope that maybe he'll be a man. He'll take you back.",
        "Rosanna: Except that I can't tell him it was Barbara.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: Because, if anybody finds out the truth of the whole situation, it'll go public, there'll be a trial that'll compromise Cabot's safety, and his secret adoption. I will not put Cabot in danger.",
        "Craig: But who put you in danger in the first place? It was Mommy and Daddy Paul. Why involve yourself in that family?",
        "Rosanna: Because I love him. Because I never stopped loving him. You're not gonna say anything to anyone?",
        "Craig: Oh, no. No, I owe you.",
        "Rosanna: You owe me? Why? I thought you saved my life?",
        "Craig: You saved me from a lonely life of exile.",
        "Rosanna: What happened in Bangkok, anyway? I mean, how did you get the charges dropped?",
        "Craig: I don't think any were filed in the first place.",
        "Rosanna: You're kidding? That's why Jennifer was so confused when I mentioned it to her.",
        "Craig: No, she is confused, but maybe not so much. Anyway, I'm gonna find out.",
        "Rosanna: What are you doing? You're not going to go over there right now, are you?",
        "Craig: Why, yes. There's no time like the present.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Craig, don't be an idiot. You can't go over there right now. If you go over to Jennifer's now, you're gonna blow everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Craig: They are not gonna steal my child.",
        "Rosanna: We won't let them.",
        "Craig: We?",
        "Paul: I have no right to ask you not to act. But I'm asking you -- all right, not to protect Rosanna, but for my family. One of whom is a member of your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: If you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you remember that time that we got stranded with the car, and we were lying under the stars?",
        "Mike: Of course.",
        "Jennifer: That was pretty special.",
        "Mike: You saying you wish we could go back in time?",
        "Jennifer: Maybe. If I could, I sure would do a few things differently. What about you?",
        "Mike: Ah, right here, only five years in the future. That cradle would be filled with our third child.",
        "Jennifer: Third?",
        "Mike: Why not? It's been pretty easy so far.",
        "Jennifer: That's 'cause I'm doing all the work!",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Jennifer: If I'm not nauseous, then I'm eating everything in sight. And I can't get comfortable in bed at night, because I feel like I'm taking up the whole bed. And don't tell anyone, but I think my feet are growing. You may think its funny, but I have a serious shoe collection.",
        "Mike: Hey, I know how many pairs of shoes you have.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's a good thing it's sandal season soon, except --",
        "Mike: Except what?",
        "Jennifer: Soon I'll be too fat to reach my toes. I can just forget about painting my toenails.",
        "Mike: Hey, I know my way around a paint brush. You forget you're married to a handyman?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I just flew all night to reclaim my life and my child.",
        "Rosanna: I understand that. But you need to be judicious.",
        "Craig: I got crossed! You know what that feels like.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I do. Of course I do. That's why every move you make has to be well-calculated. Trust me.",
        "Craig: For some reason, you just professed love for Jennifer's brother. So how do I know you're not trying to protect her just to get Paul back in your life?",
        "Rosanna: All right, Craig. You and I have been through a lot together. I know that. I haven't forgotten we adopted Cabot together. And even though we weren't destined to raise him together, I saw how much it hurt you to watch me give Cabot away. I'll never forget that. And I think that's why you're so determined to keep Jennifer's baby in your life now.",
        "Craig: No. No, I never said that.",
        "Rosanna: You didn't have to. I know how you feel more than anyone does, I think. Especially around this issue. That's why I want you to be smart, okay? Know who your enemies are.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, right now, to name a few -- Jennifer, Mike Kasnoff, Barbara.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. And all those enemies are people that are in your baby's life. You're gonna have to learn how to deal with them.",
        "Craig: They are not going to steal my child.",
        "Rosanna: No, they're not. We won't let them.",
        "Craig: We?",
        "Rosanna: I'm in this with you. I promise. Until you get what you want. It may be too late for me, but it's not too late for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do you mind explaining to me what I'm doing here with you, instead of going to Fairwinds and giving Rosanna a piece of my mind?",
        "Paul: I'm asking you not to.",
        "Emily: That woman made my life a living hell. I went to jail because of her. I lost time with my son. Why shouldn't I go over there --?",
        "Paul: Because you love your family. And because I love my family.",
        "Emily: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Paul: Look, what Rosanna did, it was horrible. I'm not trying to minimize it. But if you storm over there making allegations, if you try and get hal to press charges against Rosanna, you will be dredging up all of that pain for all of us.",
        "Emily: Yeah, or maybe I'll lay the foundation for a new beginning.",
        "Paul: How? All you're gonna do is drag us all back to a very dark place. You won't be able to spend any time with Daniel. I'll be forced to testify about Will and about Barbara at a time when they are just beginning to get along again. We will all have to relive Cabot's death, all of my father's really sick games. Look, I have no right to ask you not to act, but I'm asking you, all right? Not to protect Rosanna, but for my family. One of whom is a member of your family.",
        "Emily: All right. I'll do it. I'll back off for now. But I'm only doing this for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I have something to say. You remember that party?",
        "Casey: Yeah, Gwen, I remember that party. With you bringing it up every freaking ten minutes, how could I forget? Is somebody there?",
        "Will: Yeah. Oh, hey, sorry. I dropped this. It's for you.",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Will: It's a little old school, but, you know, it matches the dress.",
        "Gwen: No, I love it.",
        "Margo: Hey, what's everybody doing outside? The food's inside. Free food. You look very nice tonight, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Oh, really? Thank you.",
        "Will: Yeah, you look great.",
        "Casey: Right, yeah. Really good. [Doorbell rings] Oh, sweet. Wow.",
        "Celia: Hi, Casey. Sorry I'm late.",
        "Casey: Come in, you.",
        "Celia: Hi, guys.",
        "Casey: Wait. Hold on, hold on. I have something.",
        "Celia: Casey, it's beautiful.",
        "Margo: Hey, hey, hey. Turn around, let me get that. Come on, give it up. Oh, nice. Do you want to pin it on her? Here, let me get that. Okay. Everyday I see all kinds of people with diabetes.",
        "Celia: Wow, I can't believe all the decorating we did turned into this. It's so beautiful.",
        "Casey: So are you.",
        "Celia: You really mean that?",
        "Casey: All you need is that crown. And you're gonna blow the competition away.",
        "Barbara: Well, look at this gorgeous group over here. Hello, everyone. Hello, Gwen. How are you?",
        "Gwen: Fine, thank you.",
        "Barbara: Good. That's a knockout dress you're wearing. Why are you covering it up with that shawl?",
        "Will: Mom, come on.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm a designer. Gwen doesn't mind. Come on, let's pull this down over here so we can see that great body of yours. Look at that. Fabulous. Now, everybody scootch together, all right, so I can get a picture. You ready? Gwen, you ready? Everyone? Say cheese.",
        "All: Cheese.",
        "Barbara: There you go.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll see you guys in a couple minutes.",
        "Celia: Me, too.",
        "Ann: Wow. Looks like you two found something you could afford after all.",
        "Lia: Yeah, what happened to the dresses we saw you guys in?",
        "Gwen: Oh, the ones you said looked so awesome? Yeah, we knew you were playing us, that's what happened.",
        "Lia: Come on, we were just teasing. Can't you guys even take a joke?",
        "Gwen: Honey, you and your friend are the joke. And I could take you anytime. Just say the word.",
        "Celia: Forget it, Gwen. They're not worth it. Tonight's a special night. Can't we all just try to have a good time?",
        "Lia: Don't worry. We're gonna have a great time.",
        "Lisa: Ah, Barbara, I'm so proud of you.",
        "Barbara: Why? Have I done something right for a change?",
        "Lisa: It's what you didn't do that was so right. You didn't press Will into going over to tom and Margo's. And I saw Will look at you like he was seeing his mom again.",
        "Barbara: Well, I guess I have you to thank. I've taken your advice. In fact, I've been getting along better with all of my children lately.",
        "Lisa: That's the whole idea.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, thanks. Although I am a little surprised about Will's choice for a date for tonight. I mean, I thought he had his eyes on Celia.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, that's exactly what I thought, too. Especially since Will is the one who bought Celia her prom gown.",
        "Barbara: Will bought Celia's prom gown?",
        "Lisa: Yes, he did. And I thought, well, they'd be coming to the prom together tonight. But then he said no, but he assured me that they were just friends.",
        "Casey: So, you're taking Gwen out to Braden's cabin, right?",
        "Will: Yeah, that's the plan, isn't it?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe you two would take the limo up before Celia and I.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Casey: Well, I'm on dj duty, you know? I might -- I might be breaking down equipment, stuff like that. You know, I don't wanna hold you up, man.",
        "Will: Are you trying to ditch us?",
        "Casey: No, why would you say that?",
        "Will: I don't know, man. I've been getting a pretty weird vibe from you all day.",
        "Casey: What are you talking about?",
        "Will: Well, earlier when I showed up at the house, it seemed like there was definitely something up between you and Gwen. Why don't you tell me what's going on -- what's really going on?",

        "[Jennifer giggling]",
        "Mike: Would you hold still? I'm almost done.",
        "Jennifer: I can't help it.",
        "Mike: God, are you really that ticklish?",
        "Jennifer: Are you really painting my toenails? How can you keep a straight face?",
        "Mike: Hey, when I do a job, I do it right. [Jennifer laughs] Seriously, come on. You used to be a model. You're supposed to be able to hold still and not let things distract you.",
        "Jennifer: You should talk. You whined through your entire Street Jeans photo shoot.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Jennifer: The whole time. \"Can I move now? I'm hot. I'm thirsty.\" But it just goes to show you that men can dish it out, but they can't take it. That's probably why women have to bear the children.",
        "Mike: Oh. You're not comparing childbirth to painting nails, are you?",
        "Jennifer: No, but since you can't experience childbirth --",
        "Mike: No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Seriously, no. It's not happening.",

        "Rosanna: I want to see things work out for you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: I think because throughout all the things you've ever done, and all the mistakes you've ever made, you loved your children. You wanted to be a good father.",
        "Craig: So, you think I deserve a second chance?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I do. And I've never needed to believe in second chances as much as I do now.",
        "Craig: Well, then, I guess we're best buds.",
        "Rosanna: \"Best buds\"?",
        "Craig: Sure.",
        "Rosanna: Well, stranger things have happened, I suppose.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah. Like the rocket scientist who thought they could frame me by putting cocaine in my blue jeans. Payback's a bear.",
        "Rosanna: But you're going to take it slow, right?",
        "Craig: There's other people with a stake in this.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about? Who?",
        "Craig: Margo put herself on the line for me. She -- she let me go. I wouldn't be surprised if she was the one who kept those bogus charges from being filed.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, maybe you should go and see her and thank her.",
        "Craig: Maybe I will. Maybe I will. And then maybe I'll come back here, if that's okay with you.",
        "Rosanna: That's fine, bud. [Rosanna sighs] Maybe I have some reconnecting of my own to do. The only question is, how am I gonna do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Look, I can't tell you how to live your life. But I hope to God you've learned something from all this.",
        "Paul: How am I gonna learn anything from any of this? None of this makes any sense. What Rosanna did doesn't make any sense. How she left me -- it doesn't make any sense that she's back. I can't figure any of this out.",
        "Emily: Who cares? Why do you have to? I mean, do you honestly think she's gonna give you an explanation for what she did, how she acted?",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Alison: I'm not interrupting, am I?",
        "Emily: No, no. What's up?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I guess I'm kind of lonely. Do you feel like having company at your house tonight?",
        "Emily: Oh, sure, honey. We'll do girl -- we'll do girl's night.",
        "Paul: You talk to your sister. Thanks for your advice.",
        "Emily: Oh, wait, wait. Paul, where are you going? Wait a minute, where are you going?",
        "Alison: I interrupted something important, didn't I?",
        "Emily: I don't think it makes any difference.",

        "Casey: Gwen's cool, it's just that sometimes, she gets a little intense.",
        "Will: Okay, whatever.",

        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "[Celia giggles]",
        "Will: Excuse me. I'll be right back.",
        "Casey: Celia, can I talk to you a sec?",
        "Celia: Sure, what about?",
        "Casey: Josh and Zach rented a suite upstairs.",
        "Celia: A hotel room? How come?",
        "Casey: So we could chill before we go out to the lake. Are you cool with that? I mean, I thought, you know, maybe we could get a little alone time.",
        "Celia: I'm not sure.",
        "Casey: If you're worried about Rafael, he does not have to know.",
        "Celia: I guess not.",
        "Casey: I mean, he did say you could stay out -- stay out all night, right?",
        "Celia: Yeah, he did. But there's something you don't know. Rafael's leaving town tomorrow morning.",
        "Casey: What? Why?",
        "Celia: The boxing commission said he could fight again. Only thing is, he has got to go back to Montega and start all over with this new manager and everything. So, if I stay out all night, then I won't be able to say good-bye to him. And I can't let him go without saying good-bye.",
        "Casey: All right, fine. I'll make you a promise. If you say yes about going up to the suite, I swear, no matter where we end up tonight, I will make sure you get back to say good-bye to your brother. Come on, just think about it.",
        "Celia: Okay, I will.",
        "Casey: All right. All right. I'd better go check on the music, okay?",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Well, I can trust you girls to handle the ballot box, can't I?",
        "Lia: Of course you can, Mr. J.",
        "Ann: We do it, like, every year.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Okay, make sure everybody gets a ballot, and that everybody votes. And we'll count the results, and announce the prom queen. All set and ready to go?",
        "Ann: Absolutely.",

        "Will: It's my money, so I can do with it as I see fit.",
        "Barbara: That is true, but Celia's dress was very expensive.",
        "Will: So?",
        "Barbara: So, she's not even your girlfriend, and spending that kind of money sends the wrong message to someone.",
        "Will: Mom, I was doing something nice for a friend.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you were. Because you're the generous young man that I raised you to be.",
        "Will: Okay, so then drop it. Buying Celia's dress was my business, not yours. Just let it go.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm just trying to be a part of your life. That's all.",
        "Will: I get that. I really do. I get it, Mom. But I also think it would be best if you weren't here. See you later.",
        "Will: Hey. So, you want your picture taken?",
        "Celia: You bought my dress? Why would you do that?",

        "Ann: Casey, tell your girlfriend to make sure she looks picture perfect for tonight.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and why's that?",

        "Mike: You didn't know too many men who'd let a woman cut up their jeans either, and look what that got you. That was an international sensation.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, that is a great idea. Nail lacquer for men! We'll could call it masculinity -- for the man who's sure he's a man. Think it would sell?",
        "Mike: No. Seriously, how long does it take for this to dry?",
        "Jennifer: Um, surface dry, about 20 minutes. And fully dry, about two hours.",
        "Mike: We have to stay here for two hours?",
