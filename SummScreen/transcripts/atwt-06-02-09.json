        "The Hughes family is shattered when a box of Adam's things is sent home and a state department official informs them that Adam died when a suicide bomber hit the supply house where he was distributing food and medicine to the people. Casey blames himself because he wished for his brother's death many times. Casey regrets that he will never have the chance to make things right with Adam. Tom and Margo regret that Adam didn't get a chance to come home and be part of the family now that his life was back on the right track. Tom and Margo decide to have a memorial service with just family and friends to celebrate the good in Adam.",
        "Katie thinks that Brad is having an affair with a woman named Gina when she sees a card with Gina's name and a box with a bracelet in it. Vienna spies on Brad and Gina and sees Brad give Gina a kiss on the cheek and a bracelet. Gina also wonders when Brad plans on telling his wife. Vienna gives Katie the details and Katie plans to leave without ever telling Brad she is pregnant because she doesn't want him to come back to her out of pity. Vienna packs to leave with Katie and tells Henry Brad is having an affair. Henry goes to Brad's house and punches him. Brad explains to Henry that Gina is a woman who planned to give her baby up for adoption and he was trying to persuade her to give the baby to him and Katie. Henry tells Vienna to keep Katie from leaving because this has been a big misunderstanding. Brad explains everything to Katie and she tells him they are going to have a baby of their own so they don't need to adopt. Henry and Vienna are happy for Brad and Katie but are still mourning the loss of their own child. Henry and Vienna donate the $10,000 to a fund for adoption because it is a good way to remember their child."

        "Hunter: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I mean, it -- it's not something that I necessarily wanted to do, but I'm -- I'm glad it happened. You know, it helped me get past a lot of stuff that was dragging me down. And -- and that's why I came here -- to thank you.",
        "Hunter: Well, hey, you probably would have made up with your dad eventually, anyway.",
        "Alison: I don't know about that. But -- but it didn't just change things with my father. It helped me get closer to Casey -- much closer.",

        "Tom: He said he would make a few calls, Honey, but that's a long shot. Now, the state department can't know everything that's going on in a war zone. Mr. Fipps, this is my wife, Margo Hughes. Thank you for meeting with us.",
        "Margo: Hi. Is there anything you can tell us?",

        "Casey: Hunter?! Are you kidding me?!",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I feel bad for him! He's obviously been kicking himself about inviting my dad the other day, so I just wanted to show him that there's no hard feelings. Besides, he doesn't --",
        "Casey: -- Know anyone yet. He doesn't really know how to make friends.",
        "Alison: Right. So I invited him. I mean, he is the reason that I made peace with my dad, among other things.",
        "Casey: I know. But still --",

        "Jade: For what?",
        "Hunter: I don't know. She said that I helped her and Casey get closer.",
        "Jade: Oh. You're the one that got them over the hump.",
        "Hunter: What hump?",
        "Jade: What was the question?",
        "Hunter: Oh. Um, should I bring anything?",
        "Jade: Yeah. How about condoms?",
        "Hunter: That hump.",
        "Jade: Yeah. You catch on fast.",
        "Hunter: Yeah. I'm usually not too good at picking up signals.",
        "Jade: You hide it well.",
        "Hunter: Um, so do you -- do you have any suggestions?",
        "Jade: Yeah. Why don't you bring a date?",
        "Hunter: Alison suggested that, too, but, you know, who's gonna go with me?",
        "Jade: What about me?",
        "Hunter: You don't even like me.",
        "Jade: True. But I've been wrong about people before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It's not possible. Adam's not dead. I would know. No, no, I'm -- I'm his mom. I would know. And how the hell could they not tell us before they sent home his personal effects?",
        "Tom: Fipps said they screwed up.",
        "Margo: How could they not get that right? And -- and what the hell was Adam doing in Afghanistan?",
        "Tom: Sounds like he was trying to do something worthwhile.",
        "Margo: How is that possible? He's never done anything worthwhile in his life. How could he die for it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Mm.",
        "Alison: Mmm. You taste like barbecue.",
        "Casey: Is that a bad thing?",

        "Jade: If you guys wanted a private party, you shouldn't have invited other people.",

        "Hunter: Hey, you said I could bring a date, right?",
        "Casey: Wait. You're his date?",
        "Alison: That's great. That's great. We're glad you could come.",

        "Hunter: Let me help.",
        "Casey: Are you serious?",
        "Hunter: Yeah. I did some research on the web, and I think I know what I'm doing now.",
        "Casey: You did barbecue research?",
        "Hunter: Outdoor preparation of animal flesh is as old as human civilization. They found remains of barbecue pits dating back to the Paleolithic era.",
        "Casey: I don't -- I don't think that's the secret to make a better-tasting burger.",
        "Alison: Let him try.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Let me just put, uh, the fire department on speed dial real fast.",

        "Casey: Paleolithic losers. Let's show them how it's done! Yeah!",
        "Jade: I'm just as surprised as you are. He begged me to come. I felt sorry for him.",
        "Alison: Well, I guess he just felt uncomfortable, you know, coming alone.",
        "Jade: Yeah. Third wheel usually does.",
        "Alison: Well, it was really nice of you, Jade, because I know you're not his biggest fan.",
        "Jade: Well, I heard about you and Casey hooking up. I wanted to be here to celebrate.",
        "Alison: What? Man, he is such a blabbermouth.",
        "Jade: What's the big secret?",
        "Alison: It's just it's, you know, personal. That's all.",
        "Jade: Well, he didn't say anything.",

        "Alison: Okay. Well, I just, you know, want things to be okay between us.",
        "Jade: They are! I mean, I'm not saying I'm gonna go have a slumber party anytime soon. But we're cool.",

        "Vienna: So how do you know this is not innocent?!",
        "Katie: Cookies are innocent. Jewelry's not innocent.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no, no. Brad's crazy about you. He's not cheating on you. I'd bet my life on it.",
        "Katie: He's with her right now. I heard him tell her to meet him at Al's.",
        "[Vienna chuckles]",
        "Vienna: Katie, he's not gonna meet his secret lover at Al's. Everybody knows him there.",
        "Katie: But they're not gonna stay there. He told her that they would go from there.",
        "Vienna: He said that?",
        "Katie: How could he do this to me? I'm pregnant with his child.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but he doesn't know that.",
