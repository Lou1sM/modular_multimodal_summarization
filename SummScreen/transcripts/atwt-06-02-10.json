        "Silas: Its okay, Molly. It's just me.",
        "Molly: What are you trying to do?",
        "Silas: I'm just trying to talk to you. But you are tough to get a hold of. If I were a less confident man, I'd think you were avoiding me.",
        "Molly: Of course, I'm avoiding you. What don't you get, Silas? I don't want to have anything to do with you. How many times do I have to say it?",
        "Silas: Until you finally hear what I keep saying to you.",
        "Molly: That you want me? Too late.",
        "Silas: You can't walk away from me.",
        "Molly: Well, good thing I have a car then. Leave me alone.",
        "Silas: Don't brush me off, Molly. You'll regret it.",
        "Molly: Is that some kind of threat?",
        "Silas: No. I'm a lover, not a fighter. I'm not threatening you.",
        "Molly: Then what the hell is this supposed to be?",
        "Silas: Me giving you a chance to reconsider. You see, I think that your little farmer's got you all twisted --",
        "Molly: Would you stop calling him that?",
        "Silas: And you've lost touch with who you really are.",
        "Molly: Because the real me would still be into you?",
        "Silas: Or someone like me. He's too dull for you, vanilla. I know the real Molly. I know your passions. I share your passions.",
        "Molly: What do you want?",
        "Silas: Stop pretending that I repulse you.",
        "Molly: Will that get you to go away and stay gone?",
        "Silas: It's a start. Have dinner with me tonight. That could cinch the deal.",
        "Molly: No.",
        "Silas: Well, shouldn't you at least hear my plans before you shoot me down?",
        "Molly: I don't want to eat with you. I don't want to be anywhere near you. I love Holden. You and I are over.",
        "Silas: You're making a mistake.",
        "Molly: By staying away from a guy who used me and then tried to kill me? Sounds like a pretty good decision to me.",
        "Silas: Don't underestimate me, Molly. If you think I'm making things difficult for you now, you have no idea how bad it can get.",
        "Molly: I want to go home. Please let me go home.",
        "Silas: Have dinner with me tonight.",
        "Molly: Why? What is that going to accomplish?",
        "Silas: If you don't, I have mementos, Molly, of our time together. You're in a hurry. I understand that. Give me a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm just making an observation about the mistakes I've made, Holden, and I'm not expecting you to fix anything.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Lily: We've been together since we were kids, and that's all you have to say?",
        "Holden: Well, we're not together anymore. That's why I don't know what to say.",
        "Lily: Point taken. Well, it's a relief that Damian's gone and that chapter of my life is finally over.",
        "Holden: I'll drink to that.",
        "Lily: Let's do that. Let's celebrate my divorce. Let's drink to the beginning of summer and to Gabriel being okay.",
        "Holden: You want us to have drinks together?",
        "Lily: I want to have a party, a family dinner. We could do it tonight to show Gabriel how the whole family intends to make him feel welcome.",
        "Holden: Tonight? That doesn't give you a lot of time to put things together.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on. It's just a dinner. We could invite Jack and Carly. And -- and what about your mom and Meg?",
        "Holden: No, Meg -- she's not doing so well. She spent the night in the hospital.",
        "Lily: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, me too.",
        "Lily: But you'll be there, right? And Faith and, of course, Molly.",
        "Holden: Are you sure about that?",
        "Lily: I've invested a lot of my life in loving you, Holden Snyder. I'll be damned if I'm going to lose our friendship at this point. Anyone you love is welcome in my house.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right. We'll all be here. And in the meantime, uh, I guess you can move on, huh?",
        "Lily: Indeed I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Oh that kiss --",
        "Alison: God, stop talking about that kiss. No wonder Katie got out of here as fast as she could.",
        "Chris: Katie, tell me you think about me as much as I think about you, hmm?",
        "Alison: Chris, listen. Look at me. Focus. I'm Alison.",
        "Chris: Alison.",
        "Alison: Yes, finally.",
        "Chris: Stop playing with me. Just tell me. Tell me -- tell me how you really feel about me.",
        "Alison: You don't want to know.",
        "Chris: Yes. Yes, I do. Would you kiss me like you kissed me before, please?",
        "Alison: Shut up. Just sleep it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't let you keep lying to Henry. He's my best friend.",
        "Vienna: But he'll be happy in the end. Isn't that what matters most?",
        "Katie: What if he finds out you're lying to him?",
        "Vienna: Do you remember the old days, when you, me, Henry, and Brad got together and had so much fun? That was the happiest time in my life, Henry's, too.",
        "Katie: Mine too. I miss Brad so much.",
        "Vienna: And I miss Henry. I missed the way he used to look at me and the way he used to reach for me. And I know -- I know that he loves me, and I know how much he loved the baby we lost.",
        "Katie: So you're going to let him fall in love again with this fantasy baby? Don't you see how wrong that is to do to him?",
        "Vienna: Not if pretending for a little while will make him commit to being with me -- if it gives him the life he truly wants, a happy life with me and -- and the babies we'll make. Please, Katie, help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Vienna had a miscarriage last year. It was really rough on her.",
        "Casey: I remember what it did to Katie, too.",
        "Henry: Yeah. It's -- it's the worst. So I told her that we would try again. We'd have lots of babies one day.",
        "Casey: So you didn't mean it?",
        "Henry: Deep down -- I know that I never wanted to have to go through that pain again. And yet here I am.",
        "Casey: Tough spot to be in.",
        "Henry: Yeah. What are you talking about? You don't know anything about this stuff. You're just a young man.",
        "Casey: Um, I got Gwen pregnant when we were still in high school.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Henry: I forgot about that.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Didn't you deny that the baby was yours?",
        "Casey: Yep.",
        "Henry: Yeah, okay.",
        "Casey: Dumb.",
        "Henry: I -- I feel you. I feel you.",
        "Casey: But what's holding you back? I mean, you're working. You have money. You love Vienna, right?",
        "Henry: Yeah. She's a remarkable woman.",
        "Casey: Well, then, the two of you are set. Why not have a baby?",
        "Henry: Look, my biological father was a psychotic, and -- and the guy that raised me was never around. What the hell do I know about raising kids?",
        "Casey: But you do want a baby?",
        "Henry: I want the baby to have a good dad, and that's not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Will you at least help me keep my secret until I'm pregnant for real and help keep Casey away from Henry and me?",
        "Alison: Whoa. When did you guys get here?",
        "Katie: A while ago. I thought you and Chris were long gone by now.",
        "Alison: Um, he's sleeping. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Vienna: I should get going. Please. See you later.",
        "Katie: Bye. So, how's the patient?",
        "Alison: He'll survive. I'm glad you're back. You can take over the nursing duties once again. I need to leave, uh, but Chris is too out of it to be left alone.",
        "Katie: I thought you said he was sleeping.",
        "Alison: And talking too much. Um, I want you to stop trying to set me up with him.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Alison: I mean it, Katie. Just no more dates, no more setting us up to accidentally on purpose run into each other.",
        "Katie: But Chris really likes you.",
        "Alison: As a friend. And that's as far as it goes. Nothing more than that is ever going to happen between us.",
        "Katie: Why not? What did he do?",
        "Alison: Nothing, except fall for you.",
        "Katie: No. Chris does not feel that way about me.",
        "Alison: Yes, he does, Katie. He told me so himself.",
        "Katie: I'm sure you just misunderstood him.",
        "Alison: I don't know how I could misunderstand \"Katie, I can't stop thinking about you.\"",
        "Katie: He could have been talking about work or, you know, when he's on the show.",
        "Alison: No, he kept saying how beautiful you are, how he adores you, and he couldn't shut up about this kiss you shared on Lisa's show.",
        "Katie: Oh, that was just acting.",
        "Alison: Not according to him.",
        "Katie: He's on painkillers with beer. He didn't know what he was saying.",
        "Alison: He didn't know who he was talking to, but he definitely knew what he was saying, Katie. He has feelings for you, and he thinks that you have feelings for him, too.",
        "Katie: I do not.",
        "Alison: Whatever. I have to get to work.",
        "Katie: Wait. No, Alison, hold on, hold on, hold on. Listen to me. There is nothing going on between us. We are just friends, nothing romantic.",
        "Alison: There is, Katie.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Alison: Katie, there is. And it's fine. It's okay. I'm not angry. I'm not upset. I'm just glad that I found out before I got any more involved with Chris, okay? Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I was married before, you know.",
        "Casey: To Katie.",
        "Henry: To Katie. Yeah, wonderful woman. But she was in love with Mike, and -- and she dumped me for Mike. Anyhow, that's the thing about Vienna. Uh, since she met me, there was no one for her but me. And, um --",
        "Casey: Yeah, actually, yes.",
        "Henry: Uh man, I'm sorry, Casey. I didn't mean to bring up aborted wedding memories.",
        "Casey: No. I mean, I'm over it. Really, it's fine. It's fine.",
        "Henry: Fine, right. You're over it. You do not get over your fianc\u00e9e sleeping with another man while she's your fianc\u00e9e. Sorry, it's just -- what a slime ball that Mick guy is. What -- what kind of guy does that?",
        "Casey: I don't know. It happens. I mean, like, everyone already knew they were still together.",
        "Henry: Yeah. We live in this town the size of a postage stamp. Everybody knows everything about everybody.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Henry: How is Alison?",
        "Casey: I mean, we're cool. She's actually helping me out with something that I got going on right now.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah? What's that?",
        "Vienna: I thought you might be -- here.",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Vienna: What are you doing here, Casey?",
        "Casey: Just shooting some pool, having some drinks.",
        "Henry: Several.",
        "Vienna: You're drunk. You're both drunk.",
        "Henry: We've had quite the chat. We have been talking about life and love, fatherhood, you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I have arrived!",
        "Lily: Mother, I completely forgot you were coming.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, that's not the welcome that I was expecting. Honey. What? Oh! Well, this makes up for the state of Illinois. We are finally free of the Maltese connection.",
        "Lily: Funny.",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Lily: I thought I was the only one married to Damian.",
        "Lucinda: Oh but, Darling, I was the one that suffered through the whole thing with Damian. You know that now. Now we have an opportunity to put the family back together again. First thing, tell Holden.",
        "Lily: He already knows.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, how proactive. So you've already given him the news?",
        "Lily: He delivered the news. He's the one that found the papers outside.",
        "Lucinda: Talk about the hand of fate!",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, no. You're confusing fate with coincidence. He's doing quite well without me, Mother. I think it's time for both of us to accept that.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no. Doing quite well is not the same thing as being deliriously happy, which is what the two of you were.",
        "Lily: Occasionally.",
        "Lucinda: More often than not. And there's absolutely no reason why you cannot be again.",
        "Lily: Here's a reason. He doesn't want me.",
        "Lucinda: But you still want him.",
        "Lily: Mother, let's change the conversation.",
        "Lucinda: You do. You do want him. I know you do.",
        "Lily: All right, all right, all right! Yes, Mother, I want Holden back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey. I was just about to call you.",
        "Molly: What were you going to say?",
        "Holden: Since you're here, let me add this to your message. You happy to see me?",
        "Molly: Always.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Molly: Long day.",
        "Holden: Want to talk about it?",
        "Molly: Yeah, I do. But first, uh, I'm going to take a bath, and then we can have dinner, a little wine, and talk, okay?",
        "Holden: Well, that will work, but we've been invited out for dinner.",
        "Molly: By who?",
        "Holden: Lily. She wants us both there. I just tried to call Faith, but she's not answering her phone.",
        "Molly: So Faith's invited, too?",
        "Holden: Yeah. It's kind of a family thing. You want one?",
        "Molly: When did this happen?",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Molly: This, uh, invitation to dinner?",
        "Holden: I went to check on Gabriel.",
        "Molly: So you were at Lily's?",
        "Holden: Yeah. He's been giving her some trouble, and uh, I just wanted to see if I could help out.",
        "Molly: And this dinner with Lily is her way of showing her appreciation?",
        "Holden: Well, she wants to show Gabriel that he has a support system.",
        "Molly: Well, that makes sense.",
        "Holden: Plus, it's kind of a celebration. Lily -- she got her divorce papers from Damian.",
        "Molly: She did?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Molly: Oh, wow. That -- well, that's good. Good for her. She -- she's back on the mend.",
        "Holden: Well, she's not really ready to latch onto anyone quite yet. She just wants to get her life back.",
        "Molly: Yeah. I can see that.",
        "Holden: Molly, I hope you don't mind. I accepted for both of us. I know I probably should have asked you first.",
        "Molly: No, no, it's okay. It's all good.",
        "Holden: I want you to be part of this family.",
        "Molly: Holden, I wouldn't miss it.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Holden: Who is it?",
        "Molly: Uh, I'm not going to take this call.",
        "Holden: Why not? Who is it?",
        "Molly: It's just work.",
        "Holden: Well, go ahead. Answer it.",
        "Molly: No, I don't want to get stuck on a business call. We should be getting ready to go to Lily's.",
        "Holden: Molly, I don't want you to miss a story because of me.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Molly: Molly Conlan.",
        "Silas: So formal. We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.",
        "Molly: This really isn't a good time.",
        "Silas: We'll have more time at dinner. I've made a reservation. You want to write this down?",
        "Molly: Yeah, I told you that, uh, I can't do that.",
        "Silas: You need to make time for me, Molly. Or I might be forced to release some of those photos and videos I have of us together.",
        "Molly: That would be a waste of time.",
        "Silas: Are you saying that you don't care? That you're beyond embarrassment?",
        "Molly: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Silas: Maybe I'll just send them to your farmer. I'm sure he'll find my collection most interesting.",
        "Molly: It's my producer. Yeah, I -- I'm sorry. Uh, there's just no way I can make it tonight.",
        "Silas: You're apologizing to me? Oh, I get it. Farmboy's with you. Put him on. He can give me his e-mail address so I can send him those photos.",
        "Molly: I'm not trying to be difficult.",
        "Holden: If you need to go to work --",
        "Molly: No. I'm having dinner with my family tonight.",
        "Silas: Even better. I'll show up wherever they are with some home movies for entertainment. I bet your new little family would just love to see you before you became so repressed and dull. They should be exposed to your more provocative side.",
        "Molly: Can we do this another time? Any other time?",
        "Silas: I thought you wanted me to leave town right away. Did you change your mind?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: Hello.",
        "Molly: Why can't you leave me alone?!",
        "Silas: That is what I'm offering to do, Molly. You finally got through to me.",
        "Molly: You -- you're leaving Oakdale finally?",
        "Silas: If you meet me for dinner tonight, we eat, talk things through, then at the end of the night, if you still don't want to be with me, I'll walk away.",
        "Molly: You keep making these promises.",
        "Silas: I'm planning to keep this one. But if you cast me aside again --",
        "Molly: I can't do it tonight, okay?",
        "Silas: I'll be waiting for you at the Old Mill restaurant on Route 23. Don't disappoint me.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Molly: Hey.",
        "Holden: That sounded kind of intense.",
        "Molly: Yeah, it was.",
        "Holden: What did they want you to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I knew, I knew, I knew you'd never give up on -- on Holden.",
        "Lily: I wish I could. What is this pull I have for him called?",
        "Lucinda: Love, Honey. It's called love.",
        "Lily: If it's not reciprocated, it's called \"Delusion.\"",
        "Lucinda: Sit down. How can you say it's not reciprocated? How can you say -- how can you even think that this man doesn't still love you?",
        "Lily: Because he told me, Mother. He -- we're not married. He's moved in with somebody else. Any more questions?",
        "Lucinda: Why did he come over today?",
        "Lily: To help out with Gabriel.",
        "Lucinda: He claimed.",
        "Lily: Oh, Mother, this conversation is over.",
        "Lucinda: Why?!",
        "Lily: Because it's bordering on ridiculous, Mother! I am not going to let you talk me into having hope when there isn't any.",
        "Lucinda: But how can you be so sure?",
        "Lily: Because Holden can be judgmental and harsh, like he was when he first got back from the accident. And when he's like that, it's -- it's easy to see that there's nothing left between us, I mean, except a -- a mutual love and concern for our children.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, he was hurt, horribly, horribly hurt, because you married so precipitously. That's why he was angry. And you know that!",
        "Lily: I know. I know, Mother. And -- and now he's turned back into the man that I've loved all my life. And -- and ever since Gabriel came back into town, I've been dealing with Craig and my guilt about what we did.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, forget about Gabriel.",
        "Lily: Don't you try to justify it, Mother!",
        "Lucinda: I am, yes.",
        "Lily: We kept a man from his son, okay? And that was the wrong thing to do. The point I'm trying to make is that during this, Holden has been more supportive and caring and helpful than anyone.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I get it. You mean than me.",
        "Lily: I mean anyone. He makes me feel safe.",
        "Lucinda: Safe? Is that all?",
        "Lily: Yeah, safe. That -- that's it.",
        "Lucinda: Safe? Really, safe?!",
        "Lily: All right, all right. I admit it, okay? I still care about him as much as I did the day I thought I lost him in that accident. And if -- if I could go back in time and change everything that's happened since then, I would, all right? So yes, yes. Are you happy now?",
        "Lucinda: No, Honey, not quite yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What are you trying to do?",
        "Casey: I didn't say anything.",
        "Henry: That's not true, Casey. You said quite a bit. You have got some explaining to do.",
        "Vienna: I -- I'm pregnant with your baby, and that's all that matters. How could you?",
        "Casey: I -- I didn't do anything.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but Henry just said that --",
        "Casey: No, I -- I didn't tell Henry anything he didn't already know.",
        "Henry: Yeah. \"Life is hard. Fatherhood is hard.\" There's no breaking news there.",
        "Vienna: So what is it I have to explain?",
        "Henry: You are pregnant. What are you doing in a bar?",
        "Vienna: I was looking for you. And now I've found you, and I'm going to bring you home.",
        "Henry: What did I tell you? She adores me.",
        "Casey: When does your shift get over?",
        "Alison: Do you need to talk?",
        "Casey: Can we get a cup of coffee or something?",
        "Alison: It's really crazy here, Casey. Um, just tell me quick what happened. Did you ask Vienna about why she gave you the wrong name for the doctor?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, but she keeps insisting that the baby's Henry's. And then I ended up talking to Henry.",
        "Alison: What did he say?",
        "Casey: He thinks it's his baby.",
        "Alison: This is turning into a huge mess. What are you going to do?",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Casey: What -- what can I do? Everyone involved has -- has already decided it's Henry's baby. Where do I get off messing that up? I mean, I should just accept the situation and back off.",
        "Alison: Okay. I've got to go.",
        "Casey: Because that's the -- the right thing to do. I mean, I should just walk away from this and stop thinking about Vienna and the baby, and everything will be better off, right?",
        "Alison: You're right.",
        "Casey: I know you keep saying that, but what are you really thinking?",
        "Alison: This could be your baby, Casey. So no matter how much sense it makes, I just can't see you walking away from your son or your daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: You know what I'm thinking?",
        "Henry: Yeah. No bedroom games tonight, Liebchen. I've had one too many martinis.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but I'm thinking that we should call off the formal wedding.",
        "Henry: You want to call off the wedding?",
        "Vienna: I want to call off the fuss and the frills. That's not our style anyway.",
        "Henry: Simple you want, simple it is.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, that way we can just get married right away.",
        "Henry: Right away?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, forget about the wedding planner, the flowers, the caterer, the band.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah. How right away is \"Right away\"?",
        "Vienna: We can do it at Al's. That's where we've -- we've been our happiest.",
        "Henry: Yeah. So many nights, so many booths at Al's. Happy, happy, happy.",
        "Vienna: Oh, yeah, but I just want to make you happy. I just want to love you. I just want to put the wedding plans out of your mind. So what do you say? Let's get happy.",

        "Katie: Are you still in pain?",
        "Chris: Well, my back has not spasmed anymore. Feel a little achy, but --",
        "Katie: So you can walk?",
        "Chris: Yeah. Where are we going?",
        "Katie: You're going home.",
        "Chris: Okay, well -- little hungry. Want to, uh -- want to eat something first?",
        "Katie: I'm not going to cook for you.",
        "Chris: Katie, I didn't expect you to. I thought maybe we could order in. Chinese maybe.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. I can call you a cab though. I have the number in the other room.",
        "Chris: What's going on?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Chris: Did I do something weird while I was high on those meds?",
        "Katie: I have no idea what you did.",
        "Chris: Then what's with the attitude? I mean, how did I manage to tick you off while I was asleep?",
        "Katie: Maybe you woke up and said some stuff.",
        "Chris: Like what?",
        "Katie: You don't remember?",
        "Chris: No. I -- I remember I had a back spasm. I took some pills, with beer. Stupid.",
        "Katie: Well, you were in a lot of pain.",
        "Chris: And then -- and then I just went to sleep, right?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Alison was the one watching you. I don't even know -- you don't remember that?",
        "Chris: No. I mean, what else happened?",
        "Katie: I don't know, I don't know. I don't care. I -- I felt bad for almost running you over, but I have to get on with my life.",
        "Chris: Right, right. Of course. You want to get back to your life. And I just want to tell you that I apologize. Thank you so much for letting me use your bed overnight. And I will not inconvenience you any further, so --",
        "Katie: Well, no. I mean, it's not like you -- thank you.",
        "Chris: Is that the number for the cab company? 'Cause I can call.",
        "Katie: No, I'll -- I'll call. I said I was going to call.",

        "Katie: He's not even here. He's with the babysitter.",
        "Chris: Okay, what did I do, huh?",
        "Katie: You don't remember? I mean, if it was that important, you would think that you -- I got to go. Here. Here's the number for the cab. I'm sorry. Good- bye, Chris.",

        "Alison: I do understand.",
        "Casey: It's not like I have anything going with Vienna, you know? I hardly even know her anyway. You know, I just went into this thing thinking, you know, what the hell? You know, have some fun. You know how it is.",
        "Alison: No, I don't.",
        "Casey: I thought we were being real with each other.",
        "Alison: I never had sex just for fun, Casey. It always meant something to me.",
        "Casey: Really? What did it mean to you when you slept with Mick Dante?",
        "Alison: Look, that was wrong, but it wasn't frivolous, at least not for me.",
        "Casey: Good to know.",
        "Alison: Casey, I would never do that just for -- it wasn't just for fun.",
        "Casey: When I was talking to Henry at Yo's, I was tempted to tell him that I think the baby could be mine.",
        "Alison: Why didn't you?",
        "Casey: Because I don't want it to be.",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Casey: No. At least not like this. This whole situation made me realize that I do want to have kids. But I want to have them with someone I love, someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with.",

        "Vienna: Yes. You can be the sailor who got me pregnant.",
        "Henry: But I'm also the dad, and I don't want to do anything that could hurt the baby. You can't be too careful, baby.",
        "Vienna: Oh, but I talked to the doctor, and he said it was fine!",
        "Henry: Really? I would like to talk to him. That would make me feel better. Why don't I call him, see if I can make an appointment?",
        "Vienna: No. I'd love to do that, but he's away. He'll be back next week.",
        "Henry: I'm sure he has someone filling in for him.",
        "Vienna: No! I don't want to see another doctor. I don't want to see any doctor. I just -- I want to make love to you, and you act as if you -- you don't want me at all!",

        "Lucinda: May I still hold out for a happy ending on a drink?",

        "Katie: See for yourself.",
        "Vienna: A garter?",
        "Katie: It's the one I wore when I married Brad. I know it sounds silly, but we were so happy together, I thought it might bring you luck. And it can be your something borrowed when you marry Henry.",
        "Vienna: No. That's not silly at all. That's wonderful. You really understand.",
        "Katie: I do. I know what it's like to want to be loved. And now that Brad's gone, I'm scared that I'm never going to find that kind of love again.",

        "Casey: Listen, I -- I know the smart thing to do is to leave Vienna alone and let her sort out her own life, and I should figure out the same with mine.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but?",
        "Casey: I just keep remembering what I did to Gwen, how I turned my back on her when she was pregnant, denied the fact that I was the father, and how much it hurt later on when we lost the baby.",
        "Alison: Case, you were a lot younger then.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and I'm a lot smarter now, and I can't pretend it doesn't matter. I need to know the truth about Vienna's baby.",
        "Alison: I had a feeling you would come to that.",
