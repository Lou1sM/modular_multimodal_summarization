        "Rose: Come on! Mitzi, step on it! We've got to leave in two minutes!",
        "[Phone rings] [Rose sighs] hello?",
        "Dusty: Rose, don't --",
        "Rose: Good-bye. Hey, hey! You're not ready to go yet?!",
        "Mitzi: Ten minutes.",
        "Rose: Ten minutes? I've got Nancy Hughes waiting for a shampoo and a set. I've got to leave here right now if I want to get there in 20 minutes.",
        "[Phone rings] [Rose groans] I can't talk to you anymore. I've got to go. You know what? Just meet me there. Listen, if Dusty calls back, you tell him -- are you listening? You have no idea where I am. Am I speaking your language? You got it?",
        "Mitzi: I got it.",
        "Rose: No screw-ups like last night. Thank you.",
        "Mitzi: I got it. Sheesh.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[phone rings]",
        "Mitzi: She's done talking to you.",
        "Dusty: Mitzi? Listen, this is urgent. Put Rose on the phone.",
        "Mitzi: I've got to go.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey, hey. Hold on. Don't hang up. If you hang up, I'm just gonna keep calling back until I talk to her.",
        "Mitzi: Well, you do that, smart guy, okay? And you can call and call and call, 'cause you know what's gonna happen? Nobody's gonna answer, 'cause there's nobody here. Some people have to work for a living.",
        "Dusty: That's all I need to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No Rosanna?",
        "Margo: Oh, she's already at the courthouse.",
        "Jessica: Probably with her own dream team, I'm sure.",
        "Margo: Well, no, actually. She didn't hire anyone too high-profile. She didn't want to have, you know, national media attention. So she asked Tom to represent her.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, he's a wonderful lawyer.",
        "Margo: Yes, he's a wonderful lawyer, but he's swamped, so he couldn't take it.",
        "Jessica: So Rosanna doesn't have a lawyer yet?",
        "Margo: You up for the challenge?",
        "Jessica: What, are you kidding? Margo, the D.A. has nothing. So Rosanna was the last person to see Carly before she disappeared. So what? And these statements? Purely conjecture. And the forensic evidence? Please. I mean, can you spell \"circumstantial\"?",
        "Margo: Yes, I can. Welcome back.",
        "Jessica: It's good to be back. Let's go say hello to my new client.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ah, T. Marshall Travers. Thank you again for agreeing to represent my wife on such short notice.",
        "Marshall: Well, I'm anxious to get back into the fray. My hiatus from work was a little longer than I would have liked.",
        "Craig: I understand you could have done without being on trial, but at least it ended without a conviction, which is the outcome I want for my wife. I want whatever it takes to bring Rosanna home.",
        "Marshall: Not to worry. When I'm done, your wife won't need a lawyer.",
        "Craig: Oh?",
        "Marshall: But Jack Snyder will.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Marshall: Exhibit a -- proof that the good detective was filing for a divorce. Could have been messy, but we'll never know, now that his beloved wife has conveniently disappeared.",
        "Craig: Well, I like the way you work. Let's go meet your client.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Rosanna. Hello, hello.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, hello.",
        "Emma: How are you, huh?",
        "Rosanna: Why don't you ask your nephew here?",
        "Emma: Hello, Jack.",
        "Jack: I know this -- this isn't easy for you, Emma. But I think Carly would want me to do my job.",
        "Emma: Here's the change of clothes you asked for.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much. Has Craig gotten here yet?",
        "Emma: I haven't seen him, but you know, he spent the night -- most of the night in the kitchen. When I woke up, he was gone. I assumed that -- I assumed that he went home for a change of clothes also. Shall -- shall we go in?",
        "Jack: No. You know what? Um, if I could just have a moment alone with Rosanna.",
        "Emma: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: What?!",
        "Jack: Last chance to come clean maybe?",
        "Rosanna: For the 100th time, I cannot tell you what I don't know!",
        "Jack: Rosanna, if we walk through those doors, you're up against me, Evelyn and the state of Illinois. Tell me where Carly is. We'll -- we'll turn around, we'll walk out of this building, charges will be dropped, chop the whole thing up to a misunderstanding. What do you say?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I repeat, I don't know where Carly is. You are attacking the wrong person. If Carly is missing, it's because she wants to be, which would appear to indicate that she doesn't want to be with you. Which is not my fault, Jack. It's yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: You didn't touch it.",
        "Carly: I'm not hungry.",
        "Hannah: You have to eat something.",
        "Carly: I will -- later.",
        "Hannah: That's what you said this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Could you guys possibly take more time to choose between a tuna melt and grilled chicken? I already know what I want.",
        "Susan: Burger and fries?",
        "Alison: I thought I was unpredictable. [Alison sighs] you know what? I'm gonna order my lunch at the counter.",
        "Susan: Alison --",
        "Rick: Shh. Are you crazy? We finally have two seconds alone together.",
        "[Susan laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Guess who.",
        "Chris: Alison.",
        "Alison: Whatcha doing?",
        "Chris: Just having lunch.",
        "Alison: Oh, me, too. Do you want to eat together?",
        "Chris: Actually, I'm working later, and I need to bone up on pseudomonas infections.",
        "Alison: I can't even spell that or say that. So you're becoming an expert on infections, huh?",
        "Chris: Trying to.",
        "Alison: So how's your dad?",
        "Chris: He's fine.",
        "Alison: So his medication's working okay?",
        "Chris: Well, he just started taking them, but they should kick in pretty soon.",
        "Alison: It must be really weird for him not to -- to be able to deal with patients one-on-one.",
        "Chris: Yeah, being a full-time administrator is gonna take some getting used to, but --",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, yeah. I -- I mean, that's really great. But, um, you know what I really wanted to talk about?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "Alison: Last night?",
        "Chris: Last night.",
        "Alison: Well, when we were alone, and this sort of kiss almost happened.",
        "Chris: Alison, you know what? I -- can I get the check, please? I'm gonna be late.",
        "Alison: Chris, what is with? It's like you don't even like me anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig laughs] ll...",
        "Rosanna: Emma, you wouldn't mind giving me a moment with my husband, would you?",
        "Emma: No, no.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Mr. Travers, would you mind joining Mrs. Snyder outside, please?",
        "Marshall: Of course not, but don't be too long. We need to talk before your arraignment.",
        "Rosanna: Right.",
        "Emma: Since we have a little time left, I'm -- I'm gonna go and see if I can find my nephew. Excuse me.",
        "Marshall: Oh, Detective Hughes. Always a pleasure. And Jessica, you're not back to work so soon, are you?",
        "Jessica: I'm here for Rosanna Cabot's arraignment.",
        "Marshall: On behalf of the state? I thought Evelyn was prosecuting.",
        "Jessica: She is. I'm here for the defense.",
        "Marshall: Well, what a coincidence. So am I. It's gonna be a pleasure to be on your team, counselor.",
        "Margo: I have no idea what he's talking about.",
        "Jessica: Are you telling me that Rosanna Cabot retained you as counsel?",
        "Marshall: Not personally, no --",
        "Jessica: Well, then I suggest you go back to your office, because I have work to do. And I assure you, it's not going to be teamwork.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Ah, Mrs. Hughes, just be five minutes late. That's all I need is five minutes. I gotta make coffee. I gotta make -- where's the coffee? Where did I put the coffee? Mrs. -- Get out!",
        "Dusty: Hey, we've got to talk.",
        "Rose: You've already lost that privilege. You've got to go. I've got a very, very busy day today. I'm all booked up.",
        "Dusty: You better start canceling your appointments, because you've got to pack up right now and get out of town. [Rose laughs] no, I'm not kidding.",
        "Rose: Why? Why, because of that guy that you're working for? He doesn't scare me.",
        "Dusty: He should scare you.",
        "Rose: What, he sent you over here to get me shaking in my boots? It's not gonna work.",
        "Dusty: No, I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Rose: Forget it.",
        "Dusty: Listen to me. Hey, do you remember your ugliest days in Atlantic City? Do you remember the lowest guy perhaps you ever came across? Charley Spangler is ten times worse.",
        "Rose: I am thinking about Atlantic City, you know? And I'm thinking about the scum that used to take a grandmother's last dime. You're getting low with those guys -- really low.",
        "Dusty: This isn't a con. I don't want your money. I'm trying to keep you safe. You think I'm kidding you? You've got to get out of town right now.",
        "Rose: You -- why don't you go? Maybe Mr. Dangerous will follow you out of town. Wasn't your plan in the first place to leave town?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you know what? It was my plan until yesterday, when you decided to make a very dangerous man look very small. Spangler is not gonna let you get away with that.",
        "Rose: Are you lying to me again?",
        "Dusty: You're gonna risk your life to call me out on a bluff? Hey, never bet -- never bet on something you can't afford to lose.",
        "Nancy: Oh, I -- I'm sorry. Am I early?",
        "Rose: No, Mrs. Hughes, you're just on time. Come on in the back. We'll get you all shampooed and get your gown on in the VIP room.",
        "Nancy: Oh, the VIP room? I feel like a very important person, spending a lot of time pampering myself.",
        "Rose: Pampering is us. That's what I always say. You've got to go.",
        "Dusty: I'll go. I'll go. Not until you're safe.",
        "Mitzi: Rosie? Oh, man. Too late. Listen, why can't you take no for an answer. Rose, I did not tell him that you were here. He -- he took a wild guess, I swear.",
        "Rose: Don't worry about it. Mrs. Hughes is in the back. She's ready for her shampoo and a set. Could you get her started?",
        "Mitzi: Sure, you bet. I'll use that coconut creme rinse. It came in yesterday.",
        "Rose: You're supposed to be gone.",
        "Dusty: Look at this. You're supposed to be the girl who tells the truth. Mrs. Hughes is your only appointment today. Why don't you pack up Mitzi and all her coconut cleanser and get the hell out of town?",
        "Rose: You got some really weird ideas going on with you, like you have the right to tell me what to do.",
        "Dusty: You've got to trust me when I tell you, as God is my witness, I'm just looking after your life, which is -- it's a lot on my conscience, you know, with Paul's death and everything. Now you're gonna make me --",
        "Rose: How dare you. How dare you. You got some scam going on, and you can do whatever you want, but you leave Paul out of this.",
        "Dusty: This is not a scam. I'm trying to open your eyes, damn it, so you don't end up in some cold storage room with a tag on your toe. Well, if you're too stubborn to close up shop, I'll do it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Alison, I'm sorry if it sounded like I was blowing you off, but I really just came here to study.",
        "Alison: Okay, so you're, like, the smartest person I've ever met. Why do you need to study so hard?",
        "Chris: Because if a physician comes to me and asks what the symptoms are, I can't just say, \"oh, yeah, you know, fever and a rash.\" I'd say, \"a fever of 102.5 and a rash with purple and black areas 3/8 of an inch in diameter.\" You think I carry around these medical books for the fun of it?",
        "Alison: Okay, okay, okay. You need to study. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Sure, I'll check on her. I'll be right there. I've got to pop back to the hospital for a few minutes. Apparently, Fennerman needs my expert opinion on one of his post-ops. Go ahead and order for me. I'll be back before it gets here.",
        "Rick: Grilled chicken sandwich?",
        "Susan: You can read my mind. Cheer up, cutie.",
        "Rick: You didn't wave back.",
        "Alison: He was only trying to be polite.",
        "Rick: Polite? No, I don't think so. I think he likes you.",
        "Alison: Right, the way that you like your little sister.",
        "Rick: No, not that way. I've seen the way he looks at you.",
        "Alison: When?",
        "Rick: When you don't know he's looking.",
        "Alison: Are you serious?",
        "Rick: Believe it or not, I was Chris' age once. I think that I know when a man is smitten.",
        "Alison: Well, he doesn't act whatever you just said.",
        "Rick: Well, he may not realize it yet, but he will. And in the meantime, he's fighting it, but why spend all that energy fighting it unless whatever it is you're fighting for is pretty hard to resist?",
        "Alison: Well, I don't know. The last guy who resisted me didn't have much trouble sticking to it.",
        "Rick: But he was involved though, wasn't he?",
        "Alison: Thank you, mom, for sharing my entire private life with the entire public universe.",
        "Rick: Chris, he doesn't have a girlfriend. It's just a matter of time -- if you play your cards right.",
        "Alison: But I'm not quite sure what those cards are supposed to be exactly. I mean, Chris isn't like most boys I've met.",
        "Rick: Maybe that's because he's not a boy. Now, he's a little older than you are, which means you have to make a few adjustments.",
        "Alison: What do you want me to do?",
        "Rick: I'll keep it simple -- grow up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Where is Tom Hughes?",
        "Craig: He's in family court all day today, tomorrow and the next day. I had to move fast, but I didn't think you'd object if I found one of the most brilliant strategists around to plead our case.",
        "Rosanna: Brilliant? How brilliant is it to get yourself accused of rape?",
        "Craig: Well, it's brilliant not to get convicted. He's cagey, Rosanna, and cagey is what we need right now. So if Marshall wants to point the fickle finger of suspicion at, say, Jack Snyder, I say we let him.",
        "Rosanna: Jack? Marshall is planning to accuse our favorite detective of killing his own wife?",
        "Craig: It's -- it's reasonable doubt. That's all. He's gonna use it to your advantage. He's gonna use everything he can. If you think you can turn up your nose at that, you've got another think --",
        "Jessica: Or you can have a real defense from someone who believes in you.",
        "Margo: Hi, Craig.",
        "Craig: My wife and I are in the middle of something here.",
        "Margo: Rosanna, Tom was so upset that he was unable to represent you. I took the liberty of contacting Jessica for you. Now, I hope that you hear her out before you make a decision that you might regret.",
        "Craig: She has a lawyer.",
        "Jessica: Rosanna, I've read the police reports. The words \"circumstantial evidence\" were invented for a case like yours. Now, I might be able to get this thing thrown out before it even goes to trial.",
        "Marshall: You might, but you were not retained by Ms. Cabot's husband to serve as her attorney. That would be me, and since my client's arraignment will be starting momentarily, I'd like to confer with her if you don't mind.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not your client yet, Mr. Travers. I have some reservations about you.",
        "Marshall: Well, if those reservations have anything to do with Ms. Griffin's unfortunate charges --",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Marshall: -- Brought against me some time ago.",
        "Rosanna: When she told the court that you raped her.",
        "Marshall: It's my hope that instead of dwelling on my personal life, you would consider my record in the courtroom. When I fight for people, I win, Ms. Cabot. And I'd like the opportunity to win for you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Travers. Can you give me a better reason?",
        "Jessica: Rosanna, you and I have a lot in common right now. I, like you, have a great deal to prove. And I just want to ask you one thing.",
        "Rosanna: Please, go ahead.",
        "Jessica: Did you do it?",
        "Rosanna: No, of course not.",
        "Jessica: Good. That's all I need to know.",
        "Marshall: Why do you want to know? Does it matter? Because it doesn't to me. If you're innocent, that's fine. It's my job to see that you're acquitted. I'll do that regardless.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I've made my decision.",
        "Craig: Good, because I don't think I can handle another sales pitch here.",
        "Rosanna: I choose Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Just be careful, all right?",
        "Rose: I don't need you for anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I want you home, back where you belong, but when is that gonna happen?",
        "Craig: I hope this isn't just some feminist stand here.",
        "Rosanna: My decision is not political, it's practical. So if you'd please allow me to confer with my lawyer, as is my constitutional right. Now. Thank you.",
        "Jessica: First of all, thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, I meant what I told my husband. This is not about solidarity. I need to win, and you'd better be able to make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I was getting her a lawyer. Why'd you have to get Jessica Griffin?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'd like an answer to that myself.",
        "Margo: What do you want, a resume? This woman was our district attorney for years. I don't have to justify her to either one of you. Jack, Rosanna needed a lawyer, Jessica needed a job. As far as I'm concerned, it's a win-win situation.",
        "Jack: Yeah, great. Everybody wins, Margo -- except for Carly.",
        "Bailiff: All parties in the state versus Rosanna Cabot Montgomery, please assemble inside.",
        "Marshall: Sorry things didn't work out.",
        "Craig: Don't -- don't go anywhere. I'd like you to stick around.",
        "Marshall: Why?",
        "Craig: We may still need you.",
        "Marshall: Fine. I wouldn't mind the opportunity to see Jessica Griffin fall apart in the courtroom. I wouldn't mind that at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: All I'm saying is, Chris is older than you are, and he might relax a little if he saw a little more maturity in you.",
        "Alison: Fine, I'll get a fake I.D.",
        "Rick: Case in point. When someone says something that you don't agree with or you're not sure of, don't turn on the sarcasm and act like you don't care. Just take a minute and listen to what they're getting at.",
        "Alison: Well, what are you getting at? How am I supposed to morph into an older woman? Special effects?",
        "Rick: Well, sure, I mean, there are the external things, like clothes and hair.",
        "Alison: What's wrong with my clothes? [Rick sighs] I'm -- I mean, I'm -- I'm sure you're not saying that there's anything wrong with the way I dress, so -- so then, what the heck are you saying?",
        "Rick: That's better. The answer is, I love your clothes. You're always trying something new. I never know quite what to expect, which is healthy. But if you want Chris to see you with different eyes, why don't you try experimenting with something a little more sophisticated?",
        "Alison: I could ask Katie for fashion advice. I mean, she's closer to Chris' age.",
        "Rick: Sure, but as I said, it's not all about clothes. You have to think like an adult, too. That's what's going to impress Chris.",
        "Alison: There was a way that he looked at me when I finally stopped fighting the whole thing with going to jail. But -- I don't know. He -- it was like he was really proud of me for accepting responsibility, and I felt really close to him then. And I -- I think he felt the same way because -- I'm not sure I should be saying this, but we kissed once.",
        "Rick: There's nothing wrong with that.",
        "Alison: The only thing wrong is he said it would never happen again unless mistletoe was involved.",
        "Rick: Well, Christmas is six months away.",
        "Alison: Exactly.",
        "Rick: Well, there has to be a way around this somehow. Maybe we could have a florist make a special order.",
        "Alison: Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Rick: Maybe one day you'll understand.",
        "Alison: Well, I think I'll take a rain check on lunch. I'm -- I have to do some sophisticated things. Later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna tell Mrs. Hughes you don't feel well, that we're closing up shop and that she's gonna have to reschedule.",
        "Rose: Are you -- excuse me. You can't do that. This business is like the only thing that I've got left. I'm not gonna kick it off by kicking nice ladies out into the street with wet hair.",
        "Dusty: What are you gonna do? You're gonna be a sitting duck here. When Spangler comes back, he's gonna bring much more than a $50 tip this time, kid.",
        "Rose: Hey, Mrs. Hughes. Everything going all right?",
        "Nancy: Oh, it's going beautifully. Mitzi is a delightful conversationalist.",
        "Mitzi: I was telling her all about being a hostess at the casino. [Nancy laughs] she had no idea it was such hard work. Right up here.",
        "Nancy: All right.",
        "Man: Hi. Do you cut men's hair?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm afraid we're closed.",
        "Rose: Yes, we do, actually, and we have a cancellation. If you don't mind waiting till my other customer is finished.",
        "Man: No problem.",
        "Rose: Well, then have a seat. I give a great haircut. Ask one of our satisfied customers. Mr. Donovan, so good to see you again. You come back any time you need a trim. That is the last time that you try to get rid of a customer for me. You want to help me, you leave town. Understand?",
        "Dusty: Just be careful.",
        "Rose: I don't need you to say that to me. I don't need you for anything.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Dusty: You never needed me more in your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What happened to Alison?",
        "Rick: Are you afraid that I drove her away?",
        "Susan: Did you?",
        "Rick: Well, I -- I hope I inspired her. She's out searching for mistletoe as we speak.",
        "[Susan laughs]",
        "Susan: Mistletoe? It's June.",
        "Rick: Well, if you want an explanation, ask your daughter. Oh, I -- I must congratulate you. You've raised a very enterprising young woman.",
        "Susan: Well, I have to congratulate you, because you've got x-ray vision. You can see through all that stuff that keeps other people from getting to know her. No wonder she's getting so fond of you.",
        "Rick: Well, I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Susan: Well, I'm fond of you.",
        "Rick: Well, I hope so. Otherwise, I'd be in big trouble. You know, why don't we take the rest of our lunch out and spend it at your place, huh?",
        "Susan: Could we? What if -- what if we get home, and Alison is there? I mean, what we have is so great, but I -- I just don't want to flaunt it in front of her, you know?",
        "Rick: Hmm. Well, I think she might be oblivious. She's wrapped up in her own love life right now.",
        "Susan: Alison never misses anything, and her love life unfortunately has this tendency to blow up in her face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evelyn: And so I ask that bail be denied. Rosanna Cabot Montgomery is a very wealthy woman with countless resources to help her flee this jurisdiction. And she's violent, your honor. The aggravated assault that she's charged with, it's not just against anyone. It's against her own sister -- her pregnant sister. And we're not even sure if that's where the violence ends. Before you, you have the affidavit of a number of people who heard the defendant say that she wanted to get rid of her sister. Now right there, that's motive and probable cause.",
        "Jessica: And miles and miles of speculation, your honor. Ms. Hart is sounding like she's suggesting that we escalate the charge to murder, which is difficult to do without a body, don't you think?",
        "Judge: You'll get your turn, Ms. Griffin. Are you finished, Ms. Hart?",
        "Evelyn: For the moment.",
        "Jessica: I apologize for the interruption, your honor, but I can't sit here and listen to descriptions of my client characterizing her as some sort of thug. Rosanna Cabot Montgomery is a contributing member of this community. She was recently married, and she has established strong ties to this community. That, coupled with the fact that she is innocent, gives her no reason to flee. As far as her problems with her sister, which of us can say that we have never been at odds with a family member? The only thing that Rosanna Cabot Montgomery is guilty of is having an argument in public. That's all anyone has witnessed. Everything else in front of you is purely circumstantial.",
        "Judge: Bail is to be set at $250,000. The defendant is released on her own recognizance.",
        "Jessica: One other thing, your honor. We request that there be a gag order that would prevent any discussion of this case in the media by the prosecution or the defense, of course.",
        "Judge: Granted.",
        "[Gavel slams]",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Jack: $250,000? That's pocket change to Rosanna. Hope she's not too put out.",
        "Margo: Jack --",

        "Dusty: Stanley! What's cracking, kid? Oh, I'm sorry to spill your coffee. Come here. There, it's like new.",
        "Stanley: What do you want, Donovan?",
        "Dusty: Well, I don't want to share doughnuts with you. I want to know what you do in your free time when you're not sticking a knife in my throat. Oh, yeah, I also want to know what you're doing staking out Rose D'Angelo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: Rose, you have just found yourself a steady customer. You are an artist.",
        "Mitzi: She is, isn't she?",
        "Rose: Oh, it's all in the comb-out I always say. [Thunder crashes] how are you getting home, Mrs. H?",
        "Nancy: Uh, Kim brought me, but then she had a luncheon appointment, so I'm going to call a cab.",
        "Rose: No, you're not gonna call a cab. You're not gonna get one with the rain coming and everything. Mitzi will take you home.",
        "Mitzi: Yeah!",
        "Nancy: Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't ask you to go to that trouble, dear.",
        "Mitzi: No trouble. I love to drive. And I have never gotten a speeding ticket, I've never gotten a parking ticket, I've never even run --",
        "Rose: Mitzi, you're gonna get a congressional medal of honor. How about now you take Mrs. Hughes home, okay? And then, you know what? I'm gonna close up after this next customer and go home and take the rest of the day off.",
        "Mitzi: Oh, okay. Do you want me to come back and help you lock up?",
        "Nancy: Thanks again, Rose.",
        "Rose: No, you don't have to come back. I'll be fine.",
        "Mitzi: Okay.",
        "Rose: All right. Bye.",
        "Nancy: Bye-bye.",
        "Rose: Oh, I'm sorry it took so long. Thank you so much for your patience. I apologize. What are you doing?",
        "Man: Making sure no one bothers us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey, that was quick. Finish all your errands?",
        "Alison: I was looking for Katie, but she had the early shift today. I'm gonna track her down though. Don't worry. Do you mind if I take one?",
        "Susan: Didn't you have lunch?",
        "Alison: No, but I -- I changed my mind though.",
        "Rick: She had more sophisticated things to do. Finish them. We have to go to a meeting.",
        "Alison: Oh, you guys are leaving me all alone?",
        "Susan: Oh, yeah. You really want to hang out with your mom and her --",
        "Alison: Her boyfriend? You can say it, mom. I'm not gonna freak out.",
        "Susan: Hey, boyfriend, did you bribe her or something? Come on, fork it over.",
        "Alison: No, cash was not involved, but if you would like to hand over a couple hundred dollars so I could go shopping at fashions for something sophisticated, I wouldn't say no.",
        "Susan: What is all this sudden emphasis on sophistication?",
        "Rick: Well, now, that's between us. Right, Alison?",
        "Alison: Whatever you say. Well, have a fun time at your meeting.",
        "Susan: Okay, thank you very much.",
        "Susan: My daughter is turning into little Mary Sunshine, and it's all your fault. Whatever you're doing, it's beginning to scare me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Katie, I was looking for you at the hospital, but Krebs told me you weren't going to be in until later. I have an emergency, that's why. I have to find some mistletoe. Yeah, that's -- that's what I said. Um, I -- I know, but I need it really, really, really bad, and I kept asking myself, \"who would know where to find mistletoe this time of year?\" And -- and then the name just popped into my head, Katie Frasier. You will? Oh, I -- I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. Oh, thank you so much, Katie Frasier. You are the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, you did a very fine job, Jessica. There is no doubt I made the right decision today. Thank you.",
        "Margo: You're welcome.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. Margo, thank you so much for bringing Jessica in on this.",
        "Jessica: Yes, thanks, Margo. Listen, we're off to a good start, but we have a lot of work to do. We need to get together and discuss strategy, so where can I reach you?",
        "Rosanna: Um, I'll be staying with Emma out at the farm. But I'm sure she's anxious to get home. So excuse me.",
        "Jessica: Of course.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Craig: You weren't even gonna say good-bye?",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's not like I'm going to another continent.",
        "Craig: I was only trying to do the best for you.",
        "Rosanna: And why is it that you always assume that you know what is the best for me?",
        "Craig: Look, I don't like Marshall Travers much either. Heck, he's a lawyer, all right? But so what? But if he was gonna guarantee your freedom, right? I want you home, back where you belong. Now, when is that gonna happen?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I can't answer that.",
        "Craig: All right. I'm not gonna stop asking.",
        "Marshall: Kind of nice being in the audience for a change. I got to watch you strut your stuff without having to scramble for a rebuttal.",
        "Jessica: I was doing my job, Marshall, but you managed to make it sound like I was getting out my pom-poms at halftime.",
        "Marshall: Look, Jessica, I --",
        "Jessica: It wasn't a show, and it certainly wasn't for you.",
        "Craig: You don't look so good.",
        "Marshall: I should have left while I had the chance.",
        "Craig: Jack -- I know how you feel. I'm worried about Carly, too. But you're wrong about Rosanna. You need to start questioning somebody else.",
        "Jack: You think Rosanna was the only person I questioned in Carly's disappearance? I've taken so many statements, I can't see straight, Craig. I talked to everybody who attended Carly's fashion show at the Lakeview -- waiters, parking lot attendants, Rose, Emily, Will, Parker.",
        "Craig: You talked to Parker?",
        "Jack: Of course I talked to Parker. Next to Rosanna, he was the only person to see Carly before she took off.",
        "Craig: Oh?",
        "Jack: Where are you going?",
        "Craig: I've got an appointment with an old friend.",

        "Hannah: Vegetable soup. And I'm not taking no for an answer this time.",
        "Carly: I have no appetite. It's not my fault.",
        "Hannah: Oh, it's not for you. It's for that kid you're carrying. Now, I can either spoon it into you, or you can feed yourself like a big girl. But one way or another, you're going to eat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Right, right. Out of all the places to get a cup of coffee in this town, you would pick the place right across from Rose's beauty shop. I mean, it's the exact same place that Spangler staked out himself.",
        "Stanley: You're kidding? Charley was here?",
        "Dusty: Oh, you know damn well he was. So what's the plan, Stanley? Rose is gonna come out of the shop. You will have fixed her car so it won't turn over. And you're gonna mosey up to her and ask her if she needs a ride to a fueling station. And then somewhere along the way, a wrong turn is made, and you're in Chicago, with your boss.",
        "Stanley: You got it wrong. I'm just waiting for someone.",
        "Dusty: Waiting for who? That guy who needed a haircut? [Grunting] is that who we're waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: You know what's gonna happen when my assistant comes back? I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen. She's gonna do two things. She's gonna scream bloody murder, and then she's gonna call the cops. And when she does, you are gonna be a dead man -- a dead man. Do you hear me?",
        "Man: You told her not to come back, remember?",
        "Rose: No!",
        "[Rose screams]",
