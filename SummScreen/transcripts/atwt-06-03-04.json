        "Barbara looks through the box of baby items James sent, questioning everything James had told her when she visited him. Carly comes in and asks about the box, Barbara excusing it and giving her a large bonus check. Carly sees the picture that was in the box and asks about it, Barbara telling her it was an idea for screenprinting vintage photos onto shirts for the teen line. Carly believes her and leaves, Barbara phoning Paul. Roseanna is at the coffee shop/deli when Paul finds her, Roseanna telling him she's not good company and needs to be alone. He tells her she looks like she needs a friend and she welcomes him to sit with her. They discuss Jordan and she cries on Paul's shoulder, Paul reassuring her that she needs to become friends with Jordan and everything will be fine. He asks if he could be her friend again, Roseanna taking his hand and stating she counted on it. His mother calls and they both leave.",
        "Jordan and Jennifer are with Cabot, Jordan having changed his diaper. Jennifer offers to get him some dry clothes, Jordan leaving Cabot with her and getting them himself. Roseanna comes in and freaks out, accusing Jordan of just leaving Cabot with Jennifer. They argue, Roseanna finally apologizing. Jordan tells her he'll call before he comes over tomorrow, Roseanna distressed at his statement. Later, she dreams that it's Cabot's first birthday Jordan and Jennifer are married and Jennifer saying she's Cabot's mommy. Roseanna cries out that she's Cabot's mommy, James escorting her out the door as she pounds on it weeping. Paul and Barbara figure out that Jordan is James' son, but worry that either he's Paul's twin or that Paul isn't Barbara's son. Jordan tells Jennifer that James Stenbeck is behind his marriage to Roseanna, Jennifer becoming worried and urging him to call the cops. He assures her that whatever James is up to, he's not concerned \u0096 James has given him the family that he's always wanted. Jennifer is slightly miffed, telling him that she hopes he gets what he wants and he tells her that only she can give him what he really wants. They go back to Jennifer's room in Barbara's suite and make love.",
        "Dusty warns Starzyak at gunpoint to quit sending his goons over to Metro, Starzyak saying he never did. Dusty again tells him that it's all over, Starzyak threatening him that he can't tell him it's over. Once back at Metro, he presses Lucy (who's saying goodbye to Craig) for any information she can remember, Craig telling him to leave his daughter out of it. Craig asks Lucy to let him see her off at the airport tomorrow, Lucy agreeing. Meanwhile, Dusty goes over what happened, his mind focusing on the dragon tattoo on one of the attackers arms and that one of them said, \"Donovan screwed everything up.\" On the other side of the club, Carly tells Jack that she loves him so much and gifts him with a brand new corvette. They leave the club, happy."

        "Barbara: Who did you belong to? Our Lady of Mercy Home for Orphaned and Abandoned Children.",
        "[Barbara remembering]",
        "James: You want to know about Jordan Sinclair and his heir apparent.",
        "Barbara: Why does he interest you so much?",
        "James: I sent you a present of a very sentimental nature.",
        "Barbara: I didn't want it.",
        "James: You'll find it very interesting. Au revoir, Mon Cherie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: All right. I'll have to figure it out myself.",
        "Carly: Figure out what?",
        "Barbara: Oh! Oh, for Pete's sakes, don't sneak up on me like that.",
        "Carly: You left a message on my phone. You told me to meet you at the office. Here I am. I thought you'd be expecting me.",
        "Barbara: I am. Of course I am. I'm sorry. I'm just a little -- a little shaky. Too much caffeine, you know?",
        "Carly: That's cute. Whose stuff is that.",
        "Barbara: Don't get me started.",
        "Carly: Are you sure you're ready to come back to work? It's great to see you here and all, but you seem a little on edge.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. It's just that I've been gone for so long, there are a million things to do, including this.",
        "Carly: Oh. Oh, there's got to be some mistake.",
        "Barbara: No, Carly, no mistake. Accurate down to the last zero.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi. Paul, I'm not really great company at the moment. I need to be alone. I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: That's funny, 'cause from where I'm standing, it looks like you could use a friend. I was kind of hoping that you might give me a shot at that.",
        "Rosanna: How did you know I was here?",
        "Paul: I saw your car out front. I didn't expect to see you sitting here by yourself, though.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Carly was here a minute ago, but your mother called, wanting her to go by the office.",
        "Paul: I meant Cabot. I kind of pictured him sitting there on your lap, you know, drooling on a cookie.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan has him.",
        "Paul: Oh. You okay with that?",
        "Rosanna: I don't really have a choice. He wanted to road test fatherhood.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I had really hoped that you and Cabot would be gone just to avoid all that. I'm sorry.",
        "Rosanna: I know. You tried. I really appreciate everything you did.",
        "Paul: So, how long is Jordan's visit?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I'm just trying to wait long enough for him to become completely overwhelmed. Is that awful of me?",
        "Paul: No, that's great. That's brilliant. [Rosanna laughs] Make him put his money where his mouth is. A lot of guys can't handle being with a baby.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. And no matter how clever Mr. Sinclair was at business school, I doubt diapering was part of his MBA program.",
        "Paul: He's brilliant. You know, he's gonna be begging for mercy. He'll be throwing rose petals at your feet when you walk through the door.",
        "Rosanna: That's what Carly thinks.",
        "Paul: Is that what you think?",
        "Rosanna: No, not at all.",
        "Paul: It's okay. Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: See, there's all kinds of games that you can play with a ball. Maybe one day, I can teach you how to play. Huh? What do you say, Cabot? You gonna be a baseball fan, just like your dad? That's who I am. I'm your dad.",
        "Jennifer: And looking very much up to the task.",
        "Jordan: Hey, Jen. It just hit me. I'm this guy's father.",
        "Jen: And that's a good thing, right?",
        "Jordan: It's getting better all the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I hate the fact that you're living here.",
        "Craig: Why, what's so bad? I get a craving for olives during the middle of the night, I come down right at the bar.",
        "Lucy: It's not funny. Your life is out of control.",
        "Craig: Well, that's what happens when you lose everything that matters.",
        "Lucy: No guilt.",
        "Craig: Guilt? No. Responsibility, maybe, but I don't do guilt. No?",
        "Lucy: You would do anything to get what you want. But it doesn't matter, because it's not going to change my mind. I am going back to Montega tomorrow. I -- just --",
        "Craig: You what?",
        "Lucy: I need to make sure that you're okay before I go.",
        "Craig: I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Lucy: You got wasted at my graduation party, and you're so broke that you're living in the back room of a club. You are a lot of things, Daddy, but \"fine\" is not one of them!",
        "Craig: Hey, come on. I own part of this club.",
        "Lucy: I think you should sell it.",
        "Craig: If I wait, I'll get double what I paid.",
        "Lucy: Dusty is in with some dangerous people, two of whom attacked me.",
        "Craig: Thank God they -- they didn't hurt you. That's all I can say.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, I don't want you caught up with Dusty Donovan's problems. Get out of this club, and get out now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starziak: Let's hit the steam room.",
        "Attendant: Excuse me. You have a phone call, sir. Just right over there.",
        "Rocco: Meet you at the juice bar later. It's Rocco. What's up? Hello?",
        "[Rocco grunts]",
        "Starziak: Rocco?",
        "Dusty: You wish. If you think you're sweating now, Starziak, just wait. You make me feel love.",
        "Starziak: Where's Rocco?",
        "Dusty: Rocco is taking a nap.",
        "Starziak: You stupid son of a -- you just made a big mistake, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: No, you did, moron. You got a problem with me? You come and see me. You don't send two idiots over to my club to have them grab an innocent girl. That you don't do. That's stupid, and that's crossing the line.",
        "Starziak: What girl?",
        "Dusty: Lucy Montgomery. P.S., her father's my partner.",
        "Starziak: I never heard of her, and I sure as hell didn't send anybody to your club, so back off.",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you one more time. It's done, it's over. The shakedown, the laundering through the foundation itself -- it's all shut down. What does this equate to? You do not get another dime from me.",
        "Starziak: Maybe I didn't make myself clear.",
        "Dusty: And if you ever send somebody over to my club, my place of business one more time, I'll put a bullet between your eyes.",
        "Starziak: You got a hearing problem? I told you I didn't send anybody to your two-bit club. But if you find out who did, let me know. I'd like to shake the guy's hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Dusty's a little rough around the edges.",
        "Lucy: He's a crook.",
        "Craig: Well, he has a vivid history, but it's not gonna be a problem in the future.",
        "Lucy: How can you know that?",
        "Craig: Because I don't like what happened to you. I don't like what's happening here. I'm gonna make that clear to him.",
        "Lucy: It -- it's not about me. I'm going away. I'm gonna be fine. You're the one who's living in a place where people show up with brass knuckles in the middle of the afternoon.",
        "Craig: Well, I have to improvise. Everyone else is bailing on me.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.",
        "Craig: I -- I know. I know. I've taken a lot of losses in the last few years -- your mother, Bryant, Cabot, Rosanna, and now even you.",
        "Lucy: Isn't that part of what's supposed to happen when you grow up?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Yes, it is, and I don't want to talk anymore about Dusty. I want to talk about you, okay?",
        "Lucy: What about me?",
        "Craig: You are the thing I am most proud of in my life. I've screwed up a lot of times in my life, not for lack of effort. But somehow, you managed to turn out like an angel.",
        "Lucy: Thanks, Daddy.",
        "Craig: I know that I may not have a right, but I'd like to ask a favor. Just don't go away hating me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You know, B.R.O., we've had huge, huge orders. That check is just the first of many.",
        "Carly: You gave me an incredible chance, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Who knew, huh? Who knew that we'd be such good partners?",
        "Carly: Life is full of surprises, isn't it?",
        "Barbara: I was thinking that same thing before you walked through the door.",
        "Carly: This -- this is one of the best surprises in my entire life. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, let me get that for you.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Carly: I get it, I got it. Oh, who's that cute kid?!",
        "Barbara: Oh, no one. No one. It's just an idea that I was running through my head for the teen line. Silk screening vintage photographs on t-shirts.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's a good idea. I hope it's okay if we talk about it later, though. I have some money to burn. [Barbara laughs] Bye.",
        "Barbara: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't think he's trying to take your son away from you.",
        "Rosanna: He had a policeman posted at my front door. He doesn't trust me. I know, you think, \"why should he?\" If I still had half a chance, I would grab Cabot, and I would run. I would do it.",
        "Paul: I just think that it would be a mistake for you to make an enemy out of Jordan right now.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can't help it. I had this really bad feeling when I left him with Cabot -- the same feeling I had when I lost Cabot the first time.",
        "Paul: I'm with Carly on this. I don't think Jordan wants to be tied down with a kid right now. I'm sure that he would be more than happy to let you raise Cabot as your own son. And I know it must feel like Jordan has all the power right now, but a way around that for you is to make Jordan your friend.",
        "Rosanna: If Jennifer just kept her mouth shut --",
        "Paul: Jennifer was just making sure that Jordan knew that he had choices.",
        "Rosanna: You could help me. You could talk to Jennifer, convince her that Cabot is just gonna complicate her life, that she and Jordan won't have any time to get to know each other like a couple usually needs --",
        "Paul: Okay, I will scare the living daylights out of her, I promise.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, good. And then I could contact my lawyers, and I'll see if I can get them to put something on paper.",
        "Paul: That's great. And in the meantime, you make nice with Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: Right, I'll try. Show him I can be trusted, right?",
        "Paul: Right. It's all gonna be fine, Rosanna, I promise.",
        "Rosanna: You almost have me believing it.",
        "Paul: That's me. Look at me, Mr. Positive attitude.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: If you hadn't sat --",
        "Paul: You didn't even want me to sit down.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: I know. But if you hadn't have sat down, I don't know, I'd probably be out of my mind right now. Thank you.",
        "Paul: I'd really hoped that you would be off my father's radar by the time that Jordan found out that he was Cabot's father, and I -- I failed. Is there anything I can do to make up for that?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. You -- you did a lot. You've done so much. I'll never forget it.",
        "Paul: We can salvage something.",
        "Rosanna: Like what?",
        "Paul: As long as you can stay in Oakdale, I was kind of hoping you'd let me be your friend again.",
        "Rosanna: I'm counting on it. [Phone rings] [Rosanna laughs] Oh, I'm just a little stressed here. Whoo-hoo!",
        "Paul: Hello.",
        "Barbara: Paul, I'm at the office. I need to see you right away.",
        "Paul: I can't right now. I'm with Rosanna.",
        "Barbara: This concerns her.",
        "Paul: On my way. That's my mom. Seems she's a little stressed, too.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead. I'll be fine.",
        "Paul: Yeah? You're a liar.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I think you're right. I need my baby. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go get him. You want to walk out with me?",
        "Paul: My pleasure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: See what Daddy got you? It's for all those big, strong teeth you got growing, and you can chew on it.",
        "Jennifer: And if you put it in the freezer for a couple minutes, it will be even better.",
        "Jordan: Really?",
        "Jennifer: Really.",
        "Jordan: Huh. How'd you learn all this stuff?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you know, I have a little brother. [Jennifer laughs] And a makeup and clothing addiction that started in high school. I had to find a way to support it, now, didn't I? So, you are looking at what was once Oakdale's most sought-after babysitter.",
        "Jordan: Oh. Only the best for you. Well, I have to say, we didn't have anybody at the orphanage looking like you taking care of us. If we had, I might still be there.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Then you'd be missing out on so many things.",
        "Jordan: Cover your eyes, kid. [Cabot baby talks] I know. You are so incredible. If it wasn't for you, I would have signed away all my rights to be Cabot's father.",
        "Jennifer: So, what do you think about parenthood?",
        "Jordan: Well, I have never felt like this before. My life is upside down, my ten-year plan has been knocked sideways. I don't know anything anymore, but whatever happens, I will never leave my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're lying to me.",
        "Starziak: Think about it, Donovan. I send muscle when I want to send a message, so why would I send somebody and then deny it? It makes no sense.",
        "Dusty: Don't let me find out that you sent those guys over.",
        "Starziak: You won't. And by the way, you threaten me again, that'll be the last thing you ever do.",
        "Dusty: Don't forget to pick up your boy on the way out. He should be asking for his mom right about now. If you didn't send those guys over, who did?",
        "Starziak: That's a good question. I'd watch my back if I was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: Hey, babe. When are you getting home?",
        "Carly: Very late. And so are you.",
        "Jack: I'm already home.",
        "Carly: Not for long. Now, you listen closely.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: Go upstairs, and you put on your very best suit. The babysitter's going to be there soon, and in exactly 20 minutes, you go outside, and you get into the limo that's gonna be waiting for you.",
        "Jack: Limo? Are you taking me for a ride, Mrs. Snyder?",
        "Carly: Not just any old ride. This is gonna be the ride of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Diapers have a front and a back. You got it?",
        "[Jennifer laughs]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, where does Rosanna keep his dry pajamas? I'll get him a pair.",
        "Jordan: Oh, no, no. I'll get them. You want to hold him?",
        "Jennifer: Love to. Hey, there.",
        "Jordan: I'll be right back.",
        "Jennifer: Oh! Oh, you are so adorable. Now, let me see all these famous teeth that everyone keeps talking about.",
        "Rosanna: Give him to me. Give him to me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: All right, Mother, what's going on?",
        "Barbara: I'm not really sure.",
        "Paul: You said it had to do with Rosanna.",
        "Barbara: Indirectly. It concerns her son.",
        "Paul: There was a DNA test. It turns out Jordan is Cabot's father.",
        "Barbara: I already know.",
        "Paul: You'd think a doctor would be more discreet.",
        "Barbara: No, I didn't hear it from Walker. I heard it from your father.",
        "Paul: You went to see James?",
        "Barbara: I had to.",
        "Paul: Okay, Mother, what's going on?",
        "Barbara: He told me he was interested in Jordan, and then he announced to me that Jordan is Cabot's father, then he said he was going to send me a gift. It arrived.",
        "Paul: What is this, baby teeth? \"Our Lady of Mercy Home for Orphaned and Abandoned Children\"? Is that Cabot?",
        "Barbara: Well, that was the conclusion I jumped to in the beginning, but look at the photograph. It's gotta be more than 25 years old.",
        "Paul: It's Jordan.",
        "Barbara: That would be my guess.",
        "Paul: Well, so James says he has an interest in Jordan, and then he sends you all of this stuff to -- to prove what?",
        "Barbara: I think if a DNA test was done on this lock of hair, it would prove to be Jordan's.",
        "Paul: For what? What would the payoff be? There isn't any. It -- it's just Dad. He's just bored with all the books in the prison library.",
        "Barbara: Yes, but Jordan is married to a wealthy, beautiful woman. That's the payoff.",
        "Paul: Why would James care who Jordan was married to, unless -- Jordan is James' son?",
        "Barbara: I think it's a distinct possibility.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Dusty: Please, you gotta tell me everything you can remember. It's a matter of life and death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You never even had a father. You don't know anything about being one.",
        "Jordan: But I am going to learn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: He's been shaping Jordan since he was born and turning him into some kind of a weapon, and now he's got that weapon pointed directly at us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: He doesn't even have any clothes on. He could catch a cold.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan is getting his dry pajamas.",
        "Rosanna: I never should have left you two alone with him.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you didn't have a choice.",
        "Rosanna: You should have stayed out of it. If you had minded your own business, I would have --",
        "Jordan: You would have skipped town with Cabot, and I would have had you arrested, Rosanna. Some people would say that you owe Jennifer a thank you.",
        "Rosanna: When I gave you permission to let her stay while you visited him, I did not give you permission to let her take care of him.",
        "Jordan: You didn't have to. Cabot is my son, remember? I know that that's a new idea, but it's one that you're gonna have to get used to pretty quick, 'cause if this comes down to a fight, I'll win.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. It's just when I didn't see you here, I thought maybe you left him.",
        "Jordan: Look, even if I had, I don't know, run to the store for some diapers, Cabot would have been perfectly fine. It's not your call to make. Rosanna, Cabot is a beautiful little boy.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know.",
        "Jordan: And I don't want him raised in a war zone. Look, I understand how threatened you must feel right now.",
        "Rosanna: If you understood, you would sign the papers and let me have full custody.",
        "Jordan: I -- I'll call tomorrow before I stop by.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean you're stopping by tomorrow?",
        "Jordan: I'm gonna stop by whenever I want to.",
        "Rosanna: You never even had a father. You don't know anything about being one.",
        "Jordan: That's true. But I am going to learn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This doesn't make any sense at all. You know, James is an egomaniac, especially about his children. There's no way he would -- he would give a kid up to be raised in an orphanage.",
        "Barbara: Unless there's some compelling reason we don't know.",
        "Paul: Like what? Call Walker, let him do another DNA test. That will prove whether or not this stuff belongs to Jordan.",
        "Barbara: No, honey, James knows that Rosanna already ran a test. He's not going claim that that hair and those little teeth belong to Jordan unless they really do.",
        "Paul: You know this makes Jordan my brother?",
        "Barbara: Come on, don't go there yet. Don't go there yet, okay?",
        "Paul: No, this -- we'll go to our lady of mercy or whatever, and we'll look at the birth certificate and see that the names of both the parents on the birth certificate -- this is James. He's just been waiting to spring this on us.",
        "Barbara: This is my fault. I hired him here at B.R.O. I brought him into our lives.",
        "Paul: You may have brought Jordan into B.R.O., but James brought him into our lives. And he's been shaping Jordan since he was born and turning him into some kind of a weapon, and now he's got that weapon pointed directly at us.",

        "Lucy: Don't make this sound like I'm choosing her over you. I'm not. I just need to spend some time with her. I'm going away to college in the fall. Can we just leave it at that?",
        "Craig: Yeah, sure. What will you be doing on your vacations?",
        "Lucy: It depends.",
        "Craig: Montega's a long way from Massachusetts. You think maybe you could come over to Oakdale some of these vacations?",
        "Lucy: Grandmother already made me promise that.",
        "Craig: Ah! You think you might come and see -- see me on some of those?",
        "Lucy: Of course.",
        "Craig: Yeah?",
        "Lucy: I do love you. You know that.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Lucy: Do you need some money? I could get some from my trust fund. You could have an apartment.",
        "Craig: Hey. I am fine. Thanks.",
        "Lucy: You promise me you'll take care of yourself while I'm gone, okay?",
        "Craig: You, too. You, too.",
        "Dusty: You okay, sweetheart?",
        "Lucy: I'm fine. No thanks to your buddies.",
        "Dusty: They're not my buddies. In fact, I don't know them, and I can't figure out who sent them, so I need you to tell me everything you can remember so you and I can compare notes, you know?",
        "Craig: She's made a statement to the police, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Just allow me to speak to your daughter, please? You gotta tell me everything you can remember. It's a matter of life and death.",
        "Lucy: I don't know what kind of details you're looking for. It's like I told Hal Munson. I don't remember much.",
        "Craig: Dusty, leave my daughter out of this. She's already been manhandled by your two associates. You will not involve her any further.",
        "Dusty: \"Any further\"?",
        "Craig: This discussion is over. Now, what time does your plane leave tomorrow? I want to come to the airport and say good-bye. Hmm?",
        "Lucy: I'll look at my ticket and call you.",
        "Craig: Is that a yes, hmm? All right. I love you. Enjoy yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: When she calls in for the ticket information, could you get some details for me?",
        "Jack: Dusty, hey. Carly here yet?",
        "Carly: Stick 'em up, g-man.",
        "Jack: Oh, that -- that dress is illegal, ma'am.",
        "Carly: Well, you're just gonna have to arrest me later. We have a big night ahead of us. Champagne, please? Bottle of your best.",
        "Jack: New dress, champagne -- something tells me you're blowing our monthly budget.",
        "Carly: Sky high. Good thing Barbara Ryan gave me a big, fat check.",
        "Jack: Oh. You didn't tell me that.",
        "Carly: I also haven't told you how we're gonna spend it.",
        "Jack: We're not! That money's going in the bank.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, that is very sound advice, Jack. Too bad I'm not gonna take it.",
        "Jack: You're not? Honey, we gotta come up with a plan, or we're gonna nickel and dime our money away.",
        "Carly: Oh, I have come up with a plan, Jack. And it starts with you and me dancing.",
        "Jack: You gonna let me lead this time?",
        "Carly: Nope.",
        "Jack: At least you're honest.",
        "Carly: Most of the time. I've got to thank you for cutting me some slack with that. You know, it wasn't easy keeping Rosanna's secrets from you.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Carly: And it wasn't easy putting on a fashion show, being a Mommy at the same time.",
        "Jack: But you did it.",
        "Carly: Because of you. You're the reason that I can do it all, Jack. You're the reason that I didn't give up. And that night at the show in Vegas, when I was taking my bow, all I could think of was that half that applause belonged to you. The show is over and the audience is home, so I managed to get you the next best thing.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: If you really want to know, search me.",

        "Jordan: Did you see the way that Cabot looks at everything, like he's trying to figure out what he wants to say?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, he is definitely alert.",
        "Jordan: His smile -- oh, his smile, it just blows me away.",
        "Jennifer: Well, what do you expect? You've got a pretty great smile yourself, Mr. Sinclair.",
        "Jordan: Yeah? You think we look alike?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you're completely adorable and you know it.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, he does have a little bit of red in his hair, though. You know, if people see us together, they might think that you're his mother.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, well, I don't know about that. Did any of your other girlfriends have red hair?",
        "Jordan: Not that I can remember.",
        "Jennifer: Wow! You've had quite a few then?",
        "Jordan: No -- no, no, no. It wasn't like that. Jen, I'm telling you, if it wasn't for the DNA -- I wouldn't think that this was possible.",
        "Jennifer: I know. Well, someone has to have the answers.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, I have to talk to him somehow.",
        "Jennifer: Him? You know who's behind all this?",
        "Jordan: Apparently, but not definitely, it's Paul's father.",
        "Jennifer: James Stenbeck?",
        "Jordan: Yeah.",
        "Jennifer: Oh -- you have to go to the police!",
        "Jordan: And tell them what? That James Stenbeck committed the unspeakable crime of reuniting me with my son?",
        "Jennifer: No --",
        "Jordan: No, I mean -- I'm pretty grateful actually.",
        "Jennifer: No, Jordan. He is a sick and dangerous man.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, and thanks to him, I now have a family. Do you how long I've wanted that?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, my gosh -- no, Jordan -- I don't care what he gave you. There are strings attached, I guarantee it! He will make you pay for this for the rest of your life!",
        "Jordan: Look, you grew up in a family. I grew up in an orphanage. You don't understand.",
        "Jennifer: Then help me understand.",
        "Jordan: Once a year, a group of volunteers would come and take us to the circus. But I hardly watched the show. I was so busy looking at the families, the kids on their dads' shoulders, the moms making sure the other kids weren't lost. What was happening in the ring didn't matter to me at all. It was the families -- that was the greatest show on earth. And I wanted to be part of one so badly. And now I have one.",
        "Jennifer: With Cabot and Rosanna? Well, that's great. I hope you get everything that you want.",
        "Jordan: Good, because one of the things I want most of all, only you can give me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's all speculative at this point. We need to go back to the beginning.",
        "Barbara: The orphanage?",
        "Paul: No, no, no -- before that. Is there anybody -- anybody that father could have had another child with, besides you and whoever David's mother is?",
        "Barbara: Well, no. If he'd had a child by someone else, he would have thrown that baby in my face.",
        "Paul: Unless he wanted, for some reason, to keep it a secret. But why -- why would he send a kid to be raised in an orphanage?",
        "Barbara: Maybe to punish the mother. Maybe she disappointed him, so he took the baby away -- to hurt her. Honey, how many times did he try to take you away from me, when you were a little boy? What? What is it?",
        "Barbara: You know everything --",
        "Paul: Now, Mom, come on. You know what I'm saying.",
        "Barbara: Okay. James didn't know I was pregnant with you. I gave birth in secret, and I was very frightened for you. I wanted to protect you. So, I gave you to another couple to raise for about a year, until I was sure it was safe, and I could come and get you.",
        "Paul: Were you awake when I was born?",
        "Barbara: Awake? I was under a twilight anesthesia. I mean -- I don't remember anything. But honey, I would have known if I'd given birth to twins. James couldn't have taken Jordan away from me -- this is insane! No, Paul -- don't!",
        "Paul: Insane, huh? You ever hear of Rose D'Angelo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Okay, step by step. Lucy's here, and then --",
        "Man: Donovan messed things up.",
        "Dusty: I messed things up? What things? What things? Maybe it's not about you. Maybe they were after Lucy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hmm. What's this? A key to a brand new corvette?",
        "Carly: No, it's a key to your brand new corvette. Parked outside, ready to rock and roll.",
        "Jack: You're crazy.",
        "Carly: About you, I am. When Barbara gave me that check, I kept thinking about all the wonderful things you've done for me. I wanted to do something nice for you.",
        "Jack: I -- I don't know what to say. I --",
        "Carly: How about, \"hey, good-looking, you want to burn some rubber?\"",
        "Jack: Damned if you didn't think of everything.",
        "Carly: Now, what are you waiting for? You know how the song goes. Hit the road, Jack!",

        "[Sound of people laughing]",
        "Paul: Rosanna, what are you doing here?",
        "Rosanna: Well, its Cabot's first birthday. I thought maybe --",
        "Paul: You thought wrong.",
        "Rosanna: Wait, Paul -- no, please don't -- just let me give him his present. Please?",
        "Paul: All right, but then you really gotta leave.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Then I'll leave.",
        "Jordan: Hey, come on, everybody. Let's get together for a photo of Cabot's first birthday.",
        "Barbara: I had to get --",
        "Jennifer: The cake! It's our son's first birthday!",
        "Rosanna: Cabot is my son!",
        "Jennifer: I was never so happy as when I said \"I do.\" I became Mrs. Jordan Sinclair, and Cabot's Mommy all in one happy moment.",
        "Rosanna: No. I'm Cabot's Mommy!",
        "James: Cabot never belonged to you, only Jordan. Thank you for the gift. Now you must leave.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm not leaving without my son!",
        "James: Jennifer has married Jordan, and now she's going to adopt Cabot. Just face it, you have no rights here. Bye-bye.",
        "Rosanna: No! No, let me in! Let me in! Cabot is mine! Let me in! Please, let me in! Give me my baby! Let me in!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh, no. No, no, no. It is not possible! I could not have given birth to Jordan. Not even James could cover that up.",
        "Paul: This is Dad we're talking about. I think it's safe to assume the worst.",
        "Barbara: I would have known if I was carrying two babies!",
        "Paul: What if there was only one baby, and James did some kind of a switch?",
        "Barbara: You're saying you think that Jordan's my --",
        "Paul: No --",
        "Barbara: No, no, Paul! You are my son!",
        "Paul: I'm just saying --",
        "Barbara: You are my son!",
        "Paul: What if Jordan is the baby that you and James conceived?",
        "Barbara: No, no -- no! I will not think about this!",
        "Paul: You need to think about this, Mom! I mean, if we're right about this, then Jordan is Jennifer's brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: My life is very complicated right now.",
        "Jennifer: I don't mind.",
        "Jordan: Your mom might not be too happy about it.",
        "Jennifer: She won't even know that you're here. There's a separate entrance over there.",
        "Jordan: Oh, very nice.",
        "Jennifer: Very.",

        "Jordan: You know, if you were just plain old gorgeous, I could walk away.",
        "Jennifer: Could you, now?",
        "Jordan: Maybe. But you are just so much more than that, Jen. You are brave, generous, smart, sexy -- I'm falling, Jen. And if you don't want what I want, now is the time to push me out the door.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Katie: All my good jewelry! All my rings, my gold bracelet! My pearl necklace, it's gone!",
        "Rosanna: What's to stop him from marrying her, and taking Cabot?",
        "Paul: Jordan is not going to marry Jennifer.",
        "Rosanna: How do you know that? Have you seen them together?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
