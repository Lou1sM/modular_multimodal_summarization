        "Alison: I'm not a princess. I'm a nurse's aide.",
        "Gordo: That's right. The nurse's aide with the eyes of jade.",
        "Alison: My eyes are hazel, Gordo.",
        "Gordo: Dr. Gordon, Alison.",
        "Alison: You hope. Katie!",
        "Katie: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: So did you find the mistletoe?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, well, if plastic works, then I've got it.",
        "Alison: I don't care what the material is, as long as it gets a certain \r\nperson to kiss me.",

        "Chris: It's an observation admit. You'd do that for me?",
        "Gordo: Why not? Your hands are full. Consider it an apology for the \r\nother day. My little comedy routine about your dad was out of line.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I was probably a tad oversensitive. If my dad had \r\nseen your imitation, he probably would have laughed.",
        "Gordo: No, it was my bad. What do you say I take this patient, and we \r\ncall it even?",
        "Chris: Cool.",
        "Mrs. Krebs: Katie? I need you two to set up down in four north.",

        "Chris: Alison? No way. We're just friends. Besides, she's just a kid.",

        "Gordo: What do you have there?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I would tell you if I could pronounce it. It must \r\nhave been some of Mrs. Scott's medicine. I'll report it to Nurse Krebs.",

        "Molly: Craig, Jack is a cop, and he's on the case. What makes you think \r\nyou can do better?",
        "Craig: Because you're gonna help me. There's one person I need to \r\nquestion, and you have to help me arrange that.",
        "Molly: And who would that one person be?",

        "Molly: Absolutely not.",
        "Craig: I just need a little conversation with him, that's all.",

        "Craig: Yeah.",

        "Rose: You could have been killed!",
        "Dusty: Listen to me. I want to know what happened before I got here. \r\nDid he hurt you or what?",
        "Rose: No, he didn't have a chance. He was dragging me into the back \r\nroom, and then you showed up.",

        "Dusty: Okay. All right. I'll put some plywood on the door, and then I'm \r\ngonna find this guy.",
        "Rose: What are you, crazy? You're gonna go after a guy with a knife? \r\nLook at you. You're still bleeding. You're gonna need stitches.",

        "Rose: Let me get you something. Who was that guy, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: That guy works for Spangler.",
        "Rose: How do you know that?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause he had a car waiting for him. They got away. I mean, \r\nthat's what he does. He uses intimidation. That's how the guy operates. Why \r\nare you looking at me like that?",
        "Rose: How am I supposed to know what's true and what's not true with \r\nyou? Because you've been lying to me since the first day that I met you.",

        "Rose: You were almost killed. Trying to save my life. I know you're not \r\nlying to me.",

        "Gordo: But you didn't find meds. You found an empty bottle. Throw it \r\nout.",
        "Katie: Is that what the residents do now? Because as a nurse's aide, I \r\nhave a certain protocol to follow. If I find a medication vial in a \r\npatient's room, I'm supposed to report it to Nurse Krebs. It could be on the \r\npharmacy escaped drugs list, okay? That's the rule. I'm sorry.",
        "Gordo: And it's obsessive bull.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'll remember that for when I'm, like, the head of the \r\nnurses' aides. But for right now, I have to do my job.",
        "Gordo: Right, and get some poor nurse fired?",
        "Katie: I'm a nurse's aide. I can't get anyone fired.",
        "Gordo: You report that you found a vial on the ground with even a spec \r\nof medicine in it, and krebs will track down whoever left it behind and get \r\nrid of that person.",

        "Mrs. Krebs: This contained a powerful drug. Why weren't you going to \r\nreport it?",
        "Gordo: Because there was no way to determine how long it had been \r\nthere. Katie only found it by accident. For all we know, that thing was \r\nlying under the bed for months. Excuse me, I have a patient.",

        "Molly: Well, what would you want me to tell her?",
        "Dr. Schiller: That I'd be happy to forward her medical records to \r\nanywhere she needs. It's important that whoever delivers her baby \r\nunderstands how complicated her pregnancy is. She's gonna need all the help \r\nshe can get.",
        "Molly: I'll keep you posted. Thanks, Dr. Schiller.",
        "Craig: And we do want Carly to have all that help, don't we? And the \r\nbest way to do that is to let me talk to Parker.",

        "Rick: Bob's mental clarity had nothing to do with those patients' \r\ndeaths. Now, I know his medical condition, and there's nothing that would \r\nlead him to make those kind of mistakes. Now, Ben and I, we've got a \r\nconsultation tonight. I'll see you later.",
