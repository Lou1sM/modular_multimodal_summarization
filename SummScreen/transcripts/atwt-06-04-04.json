        "Simon: Aw, what are doing up? I was gonna \r\nsurprise you. ",
        "Katie: I got scared. I woke up and you \r\nweren't there, and I thought I'd dreamt the whole thing. ",
        "Simon: Ah, no. You didn't dream a thing. It's \r\nall real. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "Katie: It's just gonna take some getting used \r\nto, you know? Being able to trust the whole situation. ",
        "Simon: Listen, why don't we take this little \r\nparty upstairs? ",
        "Katie: Ooh, breakfast in bed? Yum. \r\n",
        "Henry: Katie? Katie, hey! Did you take my \r\nstickpin and my watch? ",
        "Katie: Why would I take your stickpin? \r\n",
        "Henry: I don't know. Somebody did. \r\n",
        "Simon: Why don't you go check again, Henry?\r\n",
        "Henry: Look, there's only so many times a man \r\ncan empty his underwear drawer, all right? They're not there. ",
        "Simon: Underwear drawer? Come on, mate. \r\nThat's the first place a robber looks. ",
        "Katie: A robber? ",
        "Simon: Not that you've been robbed. \r\n",
        "Henry: Well, then where is my stickpin? It's \r\nsolid gold. It's got a -- got a diamond on it the size of an olive. And then the \r\nwatch -- the watch is a Rolex. A real one. ",
        "[Katie screams] ",
        "Katie: Look, it's all gone! All my good \r\njewelry! All my rings, my gold bracelet, my pearl necklace -- it's gone! \r\n",
        "Henry: Then it's official. We've been robbed.\r\n",
        "",
        "Russ: Pilar? ",
        "Pilar: You're a pig, you know that? \r\n",
        "Russ: Nice to see you, too. ",
        "Pilar: What are you, living in your car?\r\n",
        "Russ: Well, if you paid me the money you owe \r\nme, then maybe -- ",
        "Pilar: I don't have any money. ",
        "Russ: Okay, so where'd the five grand come up \r\nto bail me out? ",
        "Pilar: What do you care? I scraped it \r\ntogether. ",
        "Russ: So scrape together what you owe me.\r\n",
        "Pilar: I can\u2019t. ",
        "Russ: Why not? ",
        "Pilar: Because my friend isn't here yet, \r\nokay? I need a favor. [Russ groans] Katie's sister, and that guy she lives with \r\n-- somehow, the two of them have gotten to Mike. He's starting to pull away from \r\nme. ",
        "Russ: Yeah, you're breakin' my heart. \r\n",
        "Pilar: Mike goes back to Katie, the deal's \r\noff. ",
        "Russ: Oh, hey. I thought that you slept with \r\nthe guy. Wow, he's bored already? [Russ chuckles] ",
        "Pilar: You want to go back to jail? Keep it \r\nup. ",
        "Russ: Fine. What do you want? ",
        "Pilar: Some fireworks. You need to remind \r\nMike that you're still a danger to me. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Oh, wow. ",
        "Carly: You like that car? ",
        "Jack: What, are you kidding me? Flying around \r\ntown with a gorgeous blonde in a beautiful red corvette -- I felt like I was 18 \r\nagain. ",
        "Carly: That explains last night. ",
        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Carly: Too bad they don't have back seats in \r\nthose sports cars. ",
        "Jack: Ah, see, that's the beauty of not being \r\n18. We always have the Lakeview. ",
        "Carly: We still have to buy gasoline for that \r\ngorgeous car. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Carly: And diapers for our gorgeous daughter.\r\n",
        "Jack: So you're telling me you blew the \r\nentire wad on your husband? ",
        "Carly: If a gal can't buy something special \r\nfor the man she loves every once in a while -- ",
        "Jack: Baby, you're all I need. ",
        "",
        "Barbara: Oh, thank god you're here. I've been \r\nup this entire night going over everything I know on Jordan Sinclair, his \r\ncontacts, his references -- ",
        "Paul: Mom, slow down! Mom, you've just had \r\nbrain surgery. Calm down. ",
        "Barbara: How can I calm down? He could be my \r\nson. ",
        "Paul: How's that even possible? ",
        "Barbara: When your father's involved, \r\nanything is possible. Why else would he imply that there's a connection if there \r\nis none? ",
        "Paul: To make you crazy. The guy's got a lot \r\nof time on his hands. ",
        "Barbara: You know what? The guy has never \r\nforgiven me for leaving him, so he does everything that he can to retaliate \r\nagainst me. And if he has kept a child from me for over 25 years, well, that \r\nwould just take the cake, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Have you spoken to Jennifer? \r\n",
        "Barbara: No, I haven\u2019t. She's still asleep.\r\n",
        "Paul: 'Cause I did a little digging. \r\n",
        "Barbara: I just can't believe that she has \r\ntaken this time to get involved with Jordan. He's married. He has a baby. \r\n",
        "Paul: Okay, let's not assume anything. \r\n",
        "Barbara: She could be his sister. Maybe I'd \r\nbetter wake her up, huh? ",
        "Paul: Wait, whoa, whoa. Hold on. And say \r\nwhat? \"Jen, please don't date with your maybe brother\"? Let's just find out \r\neverything we can find out, first. ",
        "Barbara: And in the meantime? If they decide \r\nto get intimate? ",
        "Paul: Okay, I don't think even Jordan can \r\njuggle Rosanna and James and Cabot, and Jennifer. Let's not borrow trouble. All \r\nright? Jordan isn't gonna start anything with Jennifer. Not yet. ",
        "",
        "Jennifer: Mm, you're still here. ",
        "Jordan: I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "",
        "Paul: Hey, here. You need to calm down and \r\ntake care of yourself, all right? You're still healing. ",
        "Barbara: I'm just worried about your sister.\r\n",
        "Paul: Well, so am I. You know, I went online, \r\nand I did some research on Jordan, and I think I have a really good place to \r\nstart digging. [Cell phone rings] Rosanna? ",
        "Rosanna: Hi. Can you come over? I'm really \r\nworried about what Jordan\u2019s gonna do next. Do you remember that crazy idea I \r\nhad, that leaving him alone with Cabot was gonna cure him of fatherhood? Well, \r\nit's backfired. He's besotted with Cabot. He's never gonna let him go. \r\n",
        "Paul: I'll get there as soon as I can, all \r\nright? Rosanna is frantic about Jordan taking Cabot. ",
        "Barbara: You see? It's classic Stenbeck. With \r\none move, he's thrown all of our lives into turmoil, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Okay. So don't give him the \r\nsatisfaction. Just calm down, all right? And take care of yourself. And before \r\nwe know for sure what's going on, don't say anything to Jennifer. ",
        "Barbara: Okay, you're right. I don't have to \r\nget her too upset. ",
        "Paul: All right. I'll be back in a little \r\nwhile. ",
        "Barbara: You see what Rosanna\u2019s found out. \r\nI'm sure she her people are working overtime. ",
        "",
        "Jordan: Hmm. I wish things were different -- \r\nI wasn't tangled up in this mess with Rosanna. ",
        "Jennifer: Mm, I don't care about that. \r\n",
        "Jordan: I do. Things are supposed to be \r\nspecial right now, discovering each other. Spending time along, just you and me.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Well, I don't know if that's in the \r\ncards. ",
        "Jordan: I'm not gonna let these complications \r\ntake over. And I don't want you to ever think that you're not important to me.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: How could I, after last night?\r\n",
        "Jordan: I loved making love to you. I just \r\nwant you to know, no matter how crazy things get, you can count on me. I want to \r\nbe with you. ",
        "Jennifer: I want to be with you. And if you \r\never need anything, I will help you. ",
        "Jordan: Thank you. I've never had that. And \r\nnow that I have you and a son, just -- ",
        "Jennifer: Now that you've had a night to \r\nsleep on it -- not that you had much sleep -- do you know kind of what you want \r\nto do? ",
        "Jordan: Well, I know that I still need \r\nanswers. You know, who is Cabot's mother? And why were Rosanna and I thrown \r\ntogether? I understand how she feels. She loves Cabot. And, I mean, I have \r\nfeelings for him, too. But what really matters right now is what's best for \r\nCabot. And for you and me. ",
        "[Knock on the door] ",
        "Barbara: Jennifer? Honey? I'm sorry to \r\ndisturb you, but this can't wait. ",
        "Jennifer: Can you give me a minute, Mom, \r\nplease? ",
        "Barbara: We really need to talk. ",
        "",
        "Margo: How is she? ",
        "Henry: Well, she didn't need this. And, \r\nfrankly, neither did I. ",
        "Katie: They took all the family jewelry. That \r\nbeautiful gold bracelet that Daddy gave Mama? It's gone. ",
        "Margo: Baby, I am so sorry. Do you have any \r\nidea when this happened? ",
        "Henry: Well, I didn't notice anything was \r\nmissing until this morning. But then again, we haven't checked them since before \r\nwe went to Deerbrook. ",
        "Margo: So it happened when the house was \r\nempty. ",
        "Henry: Yeah, there's a -- there's a neighbor \r\nthat lives about a mile down the main road. She came in to feed the bunnies once \r\na day. ",
        "Margo: How well do you know this woman?\r\n",
        "Katie: Oh, she's sweet, Margo. She would \r\nnever take anything. ",
        "Simon: Well, I looked around. There's no sign \r\nof a forced entry. ",
        "Henry: I don't get this. This place used to \r\nbe so safe -- used to be. ",
        "Margo: All right. Would you make a list of \r\nall the items that are missing, and make a description, any photographs you \r\nmight have for -- you know, insurance purposes. ",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. Actually, I have some \r\nphotographs at the bank in a lock box. ",
        "Margo: Good, good. ",
        "Henry: Yeah, uh -- you know, and don't forget \r\nthe pin and the Rolex. I won them in a poker game in Sausalito. ",
        "Margo: Why don't you have a look around \r\noutside? And Henry, Simon, would you look around the house? Make sure nothing \r\nelse is missing. ",
        "Henry: If they took my picture of Minnesota \r\nfats, there'll be hell to pay. ",
        "Katie: I'm never gonna see any of this stuff \r\nagain, am I? ",
        "Margo: You don't -- you don't know that for \r\nsure. Listen, I want to tell you how sorry I am about the whole Deerbrook thing.\r\n",
        "Katie: You mean, that you had me committed?\r\n",
        "Margo: Well, I really didn't have a choice, \r\ndid I? I mean, it was either that, or send you to jail. You were acting nuts, \r\nand you were obsessed with Pilar. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, I was. For good reason. \r\n",
        "Margo: Well, I just want you to know that I \r\nlove you, and I'd never do anything to intentionally hurt you. ",
        "Katie: I know. And I don't blame you for \r\nthinking the things that you did. That was the point, right? Pilar's one clever \r\ngirl, and I fell for her bait every time. ",
        "Margo: Well, she had Mike fooled. I think \r\nit's important that you know he was just as confused as I was. And everything we \r\ndid, Katie, we did out of concern and love for you. ",
        "",
        "Mike: \"I'm looking for a place to live. I'll \r\nbe back for my bags. Pilar.\" Hmm. ",
        "",
        "Pilar: You have to make Mike believe that \r\nyou're still a threat to me. ",
        "Russ: The last time we staged something for \r\nyour boyfriend's benefit, I went to jail. ",
        "Pilar: It doesn't have to be physical. Just \r\nlet him see how angry you are. ",
        "Russ: Okay, so, I threaten you, he goes to \r\nthe cops, they revoke my bail, and -- ",
        "Pilar: He goes back to Katie, we end up with \r\nnothing. We've come so far. ",
        "Russ: All right. This is the last time.\r\n",
        "Pilar: Absolutely. So I will be at the \r\ncottage, and I can't stay too long, because I'm supposed to be moving out. The \r\nsooner you can get there, the better. ",
        "Russ: Hey, I want my money. ",
        "Pilar: As soon as I can get it. ",
        "Russ: Yeah, that better mean by next week -- \r\nor else you won't have to ask me to threaten you. ",
        "",
        "Rosanna: I know I'm being silly. Cabot's \r\nperfectly safe in his crib. ",
        "Paul: Not to mention, there's an armed guard \r\nposted at your door. ",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I'm being irrational. I \r\nunderstand that. But I'm not, really, because Cabot\u2019s disappeared before. \r\n",
        "Paul: Cabot's not gonna disappear. \r\n",
        "Rosanna: But now that Jordan knows that he's \r\nCabot\u2019s father -- ",
        "Paul: You're the mother. ",
        "Rosanna: By adoption. And if Jordan \r\nchallenges that in court, I won't even have that. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, but if you don't panic, and you \r\nremain calm, and Jordan gets to see Cabot whenever he wants to, I don't see any reason why\r\nJordan would challenge the adoptive \r\nagreement. ",
        "Rosanna: You didn't see what I saw. Jennifer \r\nand Jordan are bonding. He could take Cabot, he could marry Jennifer, ride off \r\ninto the sunset with the court's blessing, a perfect little nuclear family. I \r\ncan't compete with that. ",
        "Paul: You don't have to. You don't have to \r\ncompete with any of it. ",
        "Rosanna: When I came home last night, \r\nJennifer was holding Cabot. She fed him, she changed him -- if I hadn't come \r\nhome when I did, she'd be rocking him to sleep. ",
        "Paul: Rosanna, so what? Come on. All that \r\nproves is that Jordan doesn't have a clue. ",
        "Rosanna: Exactly. He needs Jennifer to learn \r\nhow to take care of the baby. They like each other. What's to stop him from \r\nmarrying her and taking Cabot? ",
        "Paul: Yeah -- Jordan is not gonna marry \r\nJennifer. ",
        "Rosanna: How do you know? Have you seen them \r\ntogether? ",
        "Paul: Take my word for it. ",
        "Rosanna: You know something. You know \r\nsomething. Tell me. ",

        "Jordan: Barbara, I am so sorry. Neither one \r\nof us -- ",
        "Barbara: I would like to talk to my daughter \r\nalone, please! ",
        "Jennifer: It's okay. I'll be in a minute. \r\nLook, Mom, I know that this is weird, for the both of us. But I'm not 16, so why \r\ndon't we just take a deep breath, and start -- ",
        "Barbara: You want me to forget what I just \r\nsaw in there? You have made a terrible mistake. This is not possible. You cannot \r\nbe with Jordan Sinclair. ",
        "Jennifer: What are you talking about? You \r\nlove Jordan. You were the one who told me to go for it in the first place!\r\n",
        "Barbara: Then I will talk to him. I will tell \r\nhim that this is not possible. You cannot be involved with him. It is wrong.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Why? He is a wonderful man. \r\n",
        "Barbara: You have to trust me on this, Jen.\r\n",

        "Katie: Well, Mike knows that he doesn't have \r\nto worry about me anymore. ",
        "Margo: Because Simon is back. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, Henry told him. ",
        "Margo: So you didn't talk to him? ",
        "Katie: Well, we talked. It didn't change \r\nanything. ",
        "Cop: Looks like someone picked the lock on \r\nthe front door. ",
        "Margo: Did you check around for tracks?\r\n",
        "Cop: The ground's pretty hard, hasn't rained \r\nfor about a week. ",
        "Margo: Oh, that would be my fault. I prayed \r\nthat it'd be sunny for Casey\u2019s game. ",
        "Simon: Well, they didn't seem to touch \r\nanything else -- the TV, the DVD -- everything's still there. ",
        "Margo: All right, well why don't you take \r\nthis and check it for prints. Take it to the lab. Fortunately, I have all your \r\nprints on file. ",

        "Katie: Thanks. ",

        "Katie: Oh, thanks, but I'm really not that \r\nhungry. ",
        "Simon: I know it's a shock. Waking up, \r\nrealizing someone's broke into the house. I'm just glad you weren't here at the \r\ntime. ",
        "Katie: If I was here, it probably wouldn't \r\nhave happened. ",
        "Simon: All right, I tell you what. After we \r\ngo and get those photos from the bank, I'm gonna take you down to that little \r\njewelry store on Pearl Street and I'm gonna steal you whatever you want. \r\n",
        "Katie: You're sweet. But the things that got \r\nstolen? They're family heirlooms. They've been passed throughout my family. \r\nThey're irreplaceable. ",
        "Simon: All right. I'm gonna tell you right \r\nnow, they're not lost. 'Cause I'm gonna get you're jewelry back. ",
        "Katie: How? ",
        "Henry: Look, just because Simon rescued Katie \r\nfrom the nuthouse doesn't mean you're going to give up on Pilar, does it? You're \r\nstill going to arrest her. ",

        "Henry: Even if? Margo -- ",
        "Margo: Where's the proof? Where is the proof? \r\nSimon's back now, so Pilar isn't going to go after Katie now. We're not going to \r\ncatch her in the act. And besides, other than filing a false police report, what \r\nkind of crime did she commit? ",

        "Barbara: But when there's a child, you never \r\nknow. ",
        "Jennifer: Mother, the child is the whole \r\nreason that Rosanna wanted to marry him in the first place. She thought it was \r\nthe only way that she could keep Cabot. But it's not like she actually had \r\nfeelings for him. ",
