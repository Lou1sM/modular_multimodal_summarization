        "Meg: Paul, can you hear me?",
        "Paul: Meg? You're cutting in and out.",
        "Meg: Where are you? I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.",
        "Paul: I had to stop by the cabin. Pick up some stuff. You okay?",
        "Meg: I need to talk to you.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: I really need to talk to you.",
        "Paul: Where are you?",
        "Meg: At the Lakeview. Can you meet me?",
        "Paul: Sure, I'll be there as soon as I can. Look, don't leave until I get there, okay? I really want to talk to you, too.",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Meg: Craig -- you're here already?",
        "Craig: Well, we did agree to dinner, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. Of course.",
        "Holden: Hey, Guys.",
        "Lily: Hey.",
        "Meg: What are you two doing here?",
        "Craig: I hope you don't mind, but I've asked your brother and sister-in-law to join us this evening.",
        "Meg: No, I don't mind. I'm just -- surprised.",
        "Lily: No more surprised than we were when Craig called to ask us to dinner.",
        "Meg: I don't understand.",
        "Craig: Well, I just thought that your family should hear about my proposal.",
        "Lily: What proposal?",
        "Meg: Craig --",
        "Craig: I have asked Meg to be my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Rejected!",
        "Brad: Story of my life.",
        "Henry: What? What is this? This is not the Bradster I've come to know and love. Or at least to know anyway. Are you down?",
        "Brad: Who, me? No, never. What do you want?",
        "Henry: I'm just, I'm looking for Katie. I was just worried about her.",
        "Brad: Well, no need. She's great. She's just fine and dandy.",
        "Henry: Really? Really, 'cause the last time you and I talked, you, the self- proclaimed expert on Katie, told me that she would be in a puddle because Jack was getting back with Carly.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well thanks to advice from your non-wife, Katie fought for her man.",
        "Henry: She actually won?",
        "Brad: She's out on a date with my super-cop brother, so judge for yourself.",
        "Henry: That's great! That's great. Then I have nothing to worry about, I guess.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I guess so -- I mean, if you're a fan of those two.",
        "Henry: Come on, Brad, you win some, you lose some.",
        "Brad: Who said I lost anything?",
        "Henry: I don't know, but something's got your chin on the floor.",
        "Brad: I'm just -- I'm just worried about a friend, that's all.",
        "Henry: Is that friend blonde, and five two, and have a great sense of humor?",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Henry: Wow. That is definitely Katie-itis, you've got right there. I know the symptoms. Why don't you let Doctor Henry help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't want you talking about your mother like that.",
        "Parker: I'm only telling the truth. I do wish --",
        "Jack: It's disrespectful, Parker.",
        "Parker: Look, I don't want her here. I just want her gone. I don't care where. I just want her to leave.",
        "Jack: You may be upset, that's fine. But she's still your mother. The only one you have.",
        "Parker: And I'd trade her in a second if I could.",
        "Jack: She's made mistakes. I'm not going to pretend that she hasn't. But one thing I know, without a doubt, is that she loves you with all her heart.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. Look, I just want to move on like you're doing.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Parker: With Katie. You get to forget about Mom and just start something new. I wish I could.",
        "Jack: Your mother could have stayed away. She could have opted to not risk getting in trouble with the law and continue to live comfortably someplace else. But she couldn't. You know why? Because she loves you and your brother and your sister so much --",
        "Parker: If she loved us so much, she shouldn't have stolen those jewels. Because now she's a criminal. And when she ran away with Simon, she definitely wasn't thinking about us. And she wasn't thinking about you.",
        "Jack: Your mother and I were already --",
        "Parker: Divorced. Okay, I get that. But how can you even look at her? And now you're defending her. It's as if -- it's as if you still love her. I mean, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: A couple of pizza dates doesn't make you an authority on my children.",
        "Katie: I never said I was an authority. But a couple of pizza dates doesn't come close to describing my relationship with the kids either.",
        "Carly: Well, enlighten me.",
        "Katie: It took me a while to get them to trust me in the beginning.",
        "Carly: I wonder why?",
        "Katie: Because they were very suspicious after their mother abandoned them!",
        "Carly: We all know my sins, Katie. No need to harp.",
        "Katie: My point is, I've spent a lot of time with those kids. More then just a couple of take-out meals. In fact, I've spent more time with them in the last six months than you have.",
        "Carly: And that makes you exactly what to them?",
        "Katie: That makes me somebody that was happy to help Jack with the fallout after you skipped town.",
        "Carly: I'm sure you were all too happy to pitch in.",
        "Katie: He was having a hard time being both mother and father.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm glad that he had you to help him out.",
        "Katie: Somebody had to help him.",
        "Carly: He has plenty of family, Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh who? Emma? She has this farm to run. She had Holden and Lily's kids to worry about. And Brad wasn't any help, so any time Sage needed a costume, or needed someone to make her feel pretty or taken care of, and Jack was having a hard time with that, I was happy to help!",
        "Carly: I appreciate it. And I'm sure the kids do, too. But now that I'm back, your services will no longer be needed.",
        "Katie: No, no. It doesn't work that way, Carly. You think that just because you're back, I'm going to slink away and act like I'm not in Jack's life anymore? You're dead wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How could you? I haven't even given you my answer yet.",
        "Holden: You two are discussing marriage?",
        "Meg: Craig sprang it on me earlier. I told you I would think about it.",
        "Craig: Well, it's been some hours, so --",
        "Meg: So you decided to ambush me with a public announcement?",
        "Lily: I am totally lost. Why would you think of marrying Craig Montgomery?",
        "Craig: Wow. You know what Lily, I'm feeling so optimistic, I think I'm just going to ignore that insult.",
        "Meg: You and I need to talk.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry. I didn't mean this to feel like a surprise attack. It's true. I have asked Meg to marry me, and although she has not given me an answer yet, I am hoping I know what it's going to be.",
        "Holden: What is it going to be, Meg?",
        "Lily: You know, when you invited us to dinner, Craig, I knew you were plotting something.",
        "Craig: What plot? I'm not hiding anything.",
        "Lily: You're obviously backing Meg into a corner.",
        "Craig: Do you feel cornered, Meg?",
        "Meg: I think you and I need to talk privately.",
        "Craig: No, I want to be very open about this.",
        "Holden: About what?",
        "Craig: About how sincere I am. I love your sister, Meg, with all of my heart. I don't expect you to believe I'm a changed man -- but I am. Nothing wakes you up like a brush with death.",
        "Meg: Let's not go there, please.",
        "Craig: Oh, but I think it needs to be said, Darling.",
        "Holden: By all means, say it.",
        "Craig: I collapsed yesterday and your sister, Meg, single- handedly brought me back from the brink.",
        "Meg: I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.",
        "Craig: Oh, I think you're being modest. You saved my life. My heart had stopped.",
        "Lily: I didn't know.",
        "Craig: Because of Meg, the doctors got to me in time. As a matter of fact, your mother had just left my office.",
        "Meg: Stop it, Craig.",
        "Lily: My mother? What does --?",
        "Holden: Okay, so let me get this straight. Meg saves your life and you want our blessing to marry her?",
        "Craig: Overly simplistic, but yes. You are her closest family.",
        "Meg: Oh, please tell me mama isn't coming.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry, Darling, but Emma was out of town.",
        "Meg: Well maybe you should have waited until she got back.",
        "Holden: Meg, are you seriously considering this?",
        "Lily: You are going to turn down his proposal, aren't you?",
        "Meg: Well --",
        "Craig: Meg will make her decision. And I will live with it. As will she. I just wanted to let you know, and see that I'm being very upfront about this. I have no ulterior motives. I have not proposed in secret. Indeed, I have made Meg a very generous offer and I want you to know what it is.",
        "Holden: An offer? What offer?",
        "Craig: I would give Meg the world if I could. I love her that much. And the rest, we'll let you know about in due time. Once Meg has said, yes. Don't make me wait.",
        "Holden: I think you and I need to have a little talk.",
        "Lily: Can you please, please explain this madness to me?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, there you are. Sorry, Darling. Sorry. Sorry I'm late.",
        "Lily: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: I was asked to dinner.",
        "Lily: You're involved in this insanity, too?",
        "Craig: Oh, your mother is at the very heart of things. But I'm going to let her explain that to you. In the meantime, I think Lisa has a very nice, dry '89 champagne. I'm going to ask her to point that on ice.",
        "Lily: You know about Craig's preposterous proposal to Meg?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't think it's preposterous at all. I think it's sort of a match made in heaven!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Too bad I can't divorce her.",
        "Jack: Okay, I get that you're mad. I do. And I'm not going to tell you how to feel. But you cannot just say what ever you please because you're upset.",
        "Parker: Mom says what ever she pleases.",
        "Jack: She's a grownup, Parker. And again, we're talking -- we're talking about what you're doing -- nobody else. It's not okay to take things out on J.J. it's not okay to say things to intentionally hurt Sage. And it's definitely not okay to run away whenever something happens that you don't like.",
        "Parker: I didn't run away. I just came to Al's to get some space.",
        "Jack: Wherever you go, you have to let us know where you'll be and how long you're going to be there. Because believe it or not we love you, and it scares the hell out of us when you disappear. Do you understand? There's something else we've got to talk about, too.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Jack: J.J. and Sage, they want to be with your mom. And they have every right to see her.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, what if I don't want to? Do I just get lumped in with them anyway?",
        "Jack: Sometimes, yeah. That's just the way it is.",
        "Parker: But that's not fair.",
        "Jack: It's going to be tough on all of us. I can promise you this though, I won't -- I won't make you do anything that you're not ready for.",
        "Parker: Yeah well, what if I'm never ready?",
        "Jack: Well, then I guess that's your choice. Come on. Let's get you home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not trying to be the kids' mother, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well good. Because they only have one and it's me.",
        "Katie: But I am a part of their lives whether you like it or not. And I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable --",
        "Carly: No, you know something? You know what makes me uncomfortable is you rummaging around in my family trying to find some kind of substitute for your marriage.",
        "Katie: Look, I don't deny that things went wrong with Mike because of me. But you'll be happy to know that we are divorced now. Okay? But I am trying to make changes. I'm trying to learn from my mistakes so that I do things differently in the future.",
        "Carly: Well, practice in someone else's life.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I'm confused.",
        "Carly: What's confusing you, Katie?",
        "Katie: Well, you're acting like I broke up your family when I didn't get together with Jack until long after you were gone. And I thought we were talking about your kids, somehow but maybe I'm wrong.",
        "Carly: No, we are. My children are my only concern. And I really fail to see how a virtual stranger --",
        "Katie: I am hardly a stranger, Carly. It may be convenient for you to forget it, but I was there the day Sage was born. I've known her her whole life. You and I used to be friends.",
        "Carly: Well your insane obsession with trying to nail Simon ruined what ever friendship we may have had.",
        "Katie: My point is --",
        "Carly: I don't care what your point is! I am not going to let you try and turn my children against me!",
        "Katie: I would never try to do that. Carly, you're their mother. I couldn't if I tried. They love you. But there is a bottom line here, and it's that you've been gone too long to possibly know anything about their lives right now.",
        "Carly: Thank God I have you here to tell me that!",
        "Katie: If you weren't so busy trying to push me out of their lives, you would see that you started these problems the day you walked out on them.",
        "Jack: Okay, hey. Hey. What's going on here?",
        "Carly: Where's Parker?",
        "Jack: He's out on the porch, trying not to listen to you fighting with Katie.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: I asked what's going on.",
        "Carly: I'm not trying to interfere in your life. Obviously, you are free to have what ever relationship you may want. But please, Jack, for the sake of the children, let's draw a line and make it clear that I am their only mother. I'm here and I am back to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You think Craig marrying Meg is a good idea?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you know me, I just want everyone to be happy.",
        "Lily: What's in it for you?",
        "Lucinda: You are the one that asked me to deal with Craig more calmly. Now, I am attempting to do that.",
        "Lily: You know why Craig proposed to her.",
        "Lucinda: Of course I do. He's nuts about her.",
        "Lily: Yeah, he says that, but everybody knows that Meg loves Paul.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, who knows what goes on in young lovers' hearts? They change so quickly.",
        "Lily: How are you and Paul, Mother?",
        "Lucinda: Who says I am involved?",
        "Lily: Craig said you were involved and that you would explain. Now out with it. Is Meg pretending to be on the outs with Paul, so that you can topple Craig?",
        "Lucinda: Maybe.",
        "Lily: Why are so excited about this proposal? Mother?",
        "Lucinda: Craig is so in love with Meg, and he wants all the acceptance of the family. The whole family. He wants it so much, he's willing to give me back my company and overlook a certain minor infraction.",
        "Lily: Whoa, whoa. What minor infraction?",
        "Lucinda: Infraction -- well Darling, he had an encounter with something that was unforeseen and that's all.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about, the man collapsed. He collapsed. His -- his heart stopped. You had something to do with that?",
        "Lucinda: I refuse to incriminate myself.",
        "Lily: Mother! What? I -- I went to Craig and I tried to salvage the company and he turned me down. I said no more schemes. That is a -- that's horrible!",
        "Lucinda: I only do what I have to do.",
        "Lily: You're not even sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Who knew he would collapse?",
        "Lily: Mother --",
        "Lucinda: Honey, he's so crazy in love with Meg, and Meg's heroic CPR so influenced him that he wants to make this symbolic gesture of giving me back Worldwide just as soon as they are married.",
        "Lily: So you would sacrifice Meg just to get back your company?",
        "Lucinda: Stop it. Look at her. She's a big girl. Let her do it. Let her get back what you lost.",
        "Lily: I lost? Yes, I know. We all know that and I am very sorry for that. Meg should not have to pay for my mistakes. Or yours.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, this time it is not about you! Just let this happen.",
        "Lily: What if she turns Craig down?",
        "Lucinda: Then he will hang on to Worldwide. So you see, there really is no other choice here. Our Meg must say yes. And we must encourage her to do so.",
        "Meg: Just understand, if I say yes, I have my reasons.",
        "Holden: Yesterday in Mama's kitchen, you kept declaring your love for Paul.",
        "Meg: That hasn't changed.",
        "Holden: Well, then how can you consider doing this? You promised me that you were going to give up plotting against Craig.",
        "Meg: Well, it's not really plotting, exactly. It's more of a strategy.",
        "Holden: A strategy to do what?",
        "Meg: To make things right.",
        "Holden: What things?",
        "Meg: Look, just promise me that you'll go along with what ever I tell Craig, okay? Please don't interfere, Holden. Please?",
        "Holden: Meg, just, just talk to me.",
        "Craig: Meg! The waiter is opening the champagne.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm coming, Craig.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Holden: Meg, wait!",
        "Meg: Holden, I know what I'm doing.",
        "Holden: No, you don't!",
        "Lily: Just let her go.",

        "Brad: I don't want to be here.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. Brad, we're here to cheer you up, Man. Come on.",
        "Brad: Oh, Man. Look, I don't want to shoot pool, throw darts or arm-wrestle some drunk guy with a plaid shirt and mullet.",
        "Henry: Those are your three favorites, Brad. You really must be down. Come on, have a seat. We'll have a couple of beers. We'll talk, what do you say?",
        "Brad: You talk. I'm going to drown myself in ale. Two.",
        "Henry: Fine, fine, fine, fine. Why don't you take my advice?",
        "Brad: I'm going to take advice from the guy who couldn't figure out what to do with the hottest sausage this side of Sweden? Come on.",
        "Henry: Yeah, um -- well, I did finally figure it out, and since now I have the sausage, and you are sausage-less, I think maybe you should listen.",
        "Brad: I've never been this way. What happened to me?",
        "Henry: Katie. Katie happened to you, my man. She's a very special kind of woman. She gets right underneath your skin, and then she teases the heart right out of you.",
        "Brad: But it's not like we had anything really, like, you know, going on. But there was a lot of potential.",
        "Henry: You had a lot of potential with Vienna, too.",
        "Brad: Ah, Vienna.",
        "Henry: Is all mine. Find yourself another woman.",
        "Brad: Like I haven't tried? You don't have to rub it in. I know I am on a losing streak.",
        "Henry: No, you just, you need to get back up on the horse, Brad.",
        "Brad: I wasn't on the horse, Henry. That's the problem.",
        "Henry: Okay, bad analogy, all right. But you need to get back in the race.",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Brad: Why do you care?",
        "Henry: Why? For the thrill. For the sport, Man. For the chase! Look, you know, I'm pretty savvy at the track, right?",
        "Brad: So you've said.",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. And even though I usually pick a winner, every now and then, I go into some unexpected losing streak. Do you know what? I don't let it get me down. I look out on that field and I see that there's just another filly, a whole bunch of other fillies to choose from. Look around you, man, they're all over the place.",
        "Brad: Ugh.",
        "Henry: Well, maybe she's not here, right now. But she's out there somewhere. You're going to get through this, Buddy.",
        "Brad: How can you be so sure?",
        "Henry: Look at me. I'm living proof of life after Katie. You can do this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Are you okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry that you had to get caught up in my drama.",
        "Katie: Don't apologize, please. Obviously my being here is making things even more awkward and that's the last thing I want, so I'm going to go.",
        "Carly: I think that's wise.",
        "Jack: Carly, please.",
        "Carly: Katie, I admit that a lot of these difficulties are my fault. The kids have been on an emotional roller-coaster lately. And if I say one thing, and you say another, they could be confused. So I think it's the right thing to do. For you to leave.",
        "Jack: Well, I agree with Carly about the confusion. But I don't think its Katie that needs to leave. I think it's you.",
        "Jack: Thanks for putting up with all this.",
        "Katie: Thanks for letting me.",
        "Carly: Sage is asleep. I told J.J. that I won't be spending the night after all.",
        "Jack: That's good.",
        "Carly: Not for him. Actually, he's pretty upset about it.",

        "Craig: That's right. There I was, I'm sitting in my office in the tallest building in town and I don't have anyone to share my success with. And you reminded me. I have lost everyone I have ever loved. Wives, children, my friends. You were right.",
        "Holden: So, Meg found you. What else did she do?",
        "Craig: Your wonderful sister, Meg, did more than save my miserable life. She made me see that I could face up to my mistakes. She made me see that I could be responsible for my life. That I could change it.",
        "Holden: So that's what you want us to believe? That this transformation, that's what tonight is all about?",
        "Craig: Yes. I have changed, Holden. Your sister's the most principled woman I've ever met. And now, I shall live, and I will follow her example.",
        "Lucinda: Do I have to remind you that of your stupid scheme with that silly tweeker, Alison impersonating Rosanna? That -- it was a disaster? I will not let you ruin a perfectly sensible plan. Paul!",

        "J.J.: But Dad will get past that.",
        "Parker: Why should he? He's into Katie now. He'd be an idiot to go back to Mom after everything she did to him.",
