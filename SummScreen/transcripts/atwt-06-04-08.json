        "Katie arrives as Bud is calling the police on Brad. Allison hears the rumors about why she got kicked out of the Nursing Program. Bob overhears a conversation between Chris and Brenda and is worried about Chris' role in Allison getting kicked out of the Nursing Program; Chris back steps and claims his hands are clean; he only offered Allison support. Jack shows up and Bud wants to press charges; Janet admits that Bud didn't give her the black eye, but Brad is still arrested for assault. Liberty arrives to see Brad hauled off. Katie is worried and angry, as Brad still believes he did the right thing. Kim threatens Brad that his job is in definite jeopardy if the charges stick. Katie pleads for Kim to understand; the advertisers and investors won't understand the situation \u0096 only that Brad could have a record. Jack helps Katie. Bob tells Susan what happened according to Brenda. Susan suggests to Allison that she let this drop, as this angers Allison. Aaron confronts Chris. Katie thinks Janet enjoyed Brad defending her. Katie tries to get Bud to drop the charges; he agrees and all she has to do is pay for his pain and suffering and Brad has to apologize. Brad refuses to do that so Bud walks away. Allison refuses to go up against Chris because she has to work at the hospital with him and all of their colleagues. Katie appreciates why Brad won't back down, but that doesn't stop her from wanting to save his neck. She and Jack have an idea, as Janet watches them leave. Katie offers Bud twice the amount he wanted before minus the apology. Allison has to work on a patient of Chris', and they seem to handle it in stride, but soon after, Chris asks the hospital higher up to remove Allison from working in patient care. Allison is informed of this request and is infuriated to learn it came from Chris. Bob tells Kim that Chris was involved in a mess with Allison getting kicked out of the Nursing Program, but it is ok now. Janet tells Brad that Katie left with Jack. At first, Bud turns down Katie's money because he thinks it is a set up, but Jack convinces him this is his best offer. Bud finally agrees. Katie tells Brad that she got the charges dropped. They both agree to disagree. Liberty and Parker enjoy their time together. Janet wonders if Jack still has feelings for Katie. Jack hopes Janet isn't getting her hopes up just because of what happened. Kim hears the charges have been dropped against Brad; she tells him that he is safe - until next time. She wants to talk to Katie about her trip for the show now though. Katie is still upset, but Brad doesn't want them to fight the night before she leaves, as Katie relents, but warns there will be an issue if Janet causes trouble while she is gone. Aaron informs Susan of what Chris did. Susan is worried about Allison's battle, as Aaron strongly suggests that Allison needs Susan in her corner. Allison confronts Chris; she promises that he may feel like a big man to snap and get her barred from patient care, but big men fall hard."

        "Katie: What is going on? Why is he calling the police?",
        "Brad: Look, don't worry about it.",
        "Katie: Don't tell me not to worry about it.",
        "Bud: You want to know why, Sweetheart? Because this moron attacked me.",
        "Katie: You got in a fight with him?",
        "Janet: Look, don't be mad at Bradley. He was just trying to protect me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So, this is some green Chai herbal tea thing. I don't know. We don't serve this at the Lakeview. [Alison chuckles] Is that a smile I see? Yes, that's a smile I see.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, don't get used to it.",
        "Aaron: I know it doesn't seem like it's gonna get better, but it's going to. I promise.",
        "Alison: Well, I've sort of given up on happy endings. Getting kicked out of nursing school will do that to a girl.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Well, you're allowed to feel sorry for yourself, but not until you finish that drink in front of you.",
        "Alison: Fine. But I'm warning you, I'm going to drink it very, very slowly.",
        "Fay: Hey, I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Alison: Oh, you've heard.",
        "Fay: Heard? Please, it's all anyone's talking about. How you got booted out of class because you stopped putting out for Chris Hughes. Unreal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Are you sure you won't face any repercussions for dropping Alison from the nursing program?",
        "Brenda: Why? With her poor test scores and poor lab work, it was practically a no-brainer. And quite frankly, something I've wanted to do for a long time now. I just didn't feel comfortable with your position in the matter.",
        "Bob: Excuse me for interrupting, but why does Dr. Hughes have a say in this at all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Bud gave you that black eye?",
        "Bud: I did not. I barely touched you, and you know it.",
        "Brad: You are lying. You are lying, Man. When I came in, your hands were all over her!",
        "Bud: I was ticked off, sure, but I didn't hit her. Tell them!",
        "Brad: Oh, you're giving her orders now? Listen to me -- I'm telling you, Bud, you are done pushing her around. You are done! You are done, Man!",
        "Katie: Brad, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Are you crazy?!",
        "Jack: Oakdale police department. Open the door now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm gonna tell you what I've told you since the first day of class. I am not sleeping with Chris Hughes.",
        "Fay: Right.",
        "Alison: Okay, and you can tell the rest of the class that if you want. I give you permission.",
        "Fay: Fine, I will, but it's not like anyone's gonna believe you. Come on, we all know about the private tutoring sessions. You and doctor-without-borders steaming up the on-call room.",
        "Aaron: Who does she think she is?",
        "Alison: Well, she -- she thinks I'm a slut. But I think she's a big bitch, so I guess we're even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I was under the impression that Alison's dismissal was above board, that your personal feelings were not an issue here.",
        "Chris: It was above board, Dad. I was just as surprised as you were when I heard what happened. You know how bad I wanted her to succeed at this. Why would I do anything to interfere with that?",
        "Bob: Well, you told me that you two were having a rough time. Now, can you honestly tell me that your personal feelings didn't cross over into your professional relationship?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We're responding to a call about an assault. You okay?",
        "Bud: She's not the one who was attacked. I am.",
        "Brad: You had it coming.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right, all right. You did this?",
        "Brad: I hit him, not her.",
        "Bud: It's not the first time he'd come after me, either. He cornered me downstairs, told me to stay away from what's-her-name over there or else.",
        "Jack: Maybe he was onto something.",
        "Bud: Man, I didn't give her that black eye. Are you gonna say something or what?",
        "Janet: It's true. He didn't.",
        "Jack: So, then, why the hell are you running around throwing punches, Brad?",
        "Bud: Why do you think? He's got the hots for her, that's why.",
        "Brad: Hey, that is not just some random woman. That is the mother of my kid.",
        "Bud: I want to press charges.",
        "Brad: Are you kidding me? Jack, come on.",
        "Jack: You admitted to hitting him, Brad. I really don't have a choice.",
        "Brad: You gotta do what you gotta do.",
        "Jack: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Bradley, listen, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna grab my purse. I'm gonna go down with you. Maybe I can clear this up, and I might be able to afford bail.",
        "Jack: You have the right to have an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand --?",
        "Katie: No. You stay right here. You've done enough. Do you understand me?",
        "Liberty: Whoa, what's with the hardware? Mom, this is because of you, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Sit. Hanson, take his statement please.",
        "Hanson: You got it.",
        "Jack: Thank you. You want to tell me what the hell happened?",
        "Brad: I hit him. It felt good. I'm not sorry.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's terrific, Brad.",
        "Brad: He's a bully, Jack. He's a bully. I mean, he smacks a woman around, but the second he gets a taste of his own medicine, he calls the cops?",
        "Jack: Did you threatened him?",
        "Brad: Yes, damn straight I threatened him. Told him if he went near Janet again that he'd be sorry.",
        "Katie: Yeah, only you're the one who got arrested.",
        "Brad: Excuse me. I mean, you all saw Janet's black eye. I'm not without justification here.",
        "Katie: I also heard Janet say that Bud didn't hit her.",
        "Brad: Well, you know what I heard? I heard my daughter telling me she was worried that some guy was smacking her mom around.",
        "Katie: I gotta make a call.",
        "Brad: Katie. Katie! Where is she going?",
        "Jack: Hopefully to call you a good lawyer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: This whole thing is just a big misunderstanding.",
        "Liberty: Really? Because I thought I just saw my dad, like, taken away in handcuffs.",
        "Janet: Do you think this is funny?",
        "Liberty: No, Mom, not at all.",
        "Janet: Good, because he doesn't deserve this. He is a good man.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, well, you're not gonna get arguments there. I mean, not from me, not from Katie.",
        "Janet: Why did you have to say anything about Bud at all, huh? Why did you have to tell them anything? I could have taken care of this myself.",
        "Liberty: Okay, maybe I was worried, Mom. Maybe I was a little worried about my -- black-eyed mom and her inspiring taste in men.",
        "Janet: You were worried about me?",
        "Liberty: Oh, yes, Mom, I was. I was really, really worried about you until you found some way to get my dad arrested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Did you call a lawyer?",
        "Katie: No. I'm kind of in denial that you might need one.",
        "Brad: Are you really mad at me?",
        "Katie: Don't ask me that when you're wearing handcuffs.",
        "Brad: I'm fine, by the way.",
        "Katie: Your fist won't be tomorrow, but don't expect me to kiss it and make it better.",
        "Brad: Why can't you see this from my perspective?",
        "Katie: I do! I don't want to think about what could have happened in that room anymore than you do. But have you stopped to think about what could happen to you?",
        "Brad: No. The only thing I was thinking about was Liberty. To make sure she knows it's not okay for a man to treat her the way Bud treated her mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I am proud of you.",
        "Alison: For what?",
        "Aaron: The way you handled Fay. I mean, you -- you totally didn't lose your cool. I mean, you defended yourself. You didn't back down.",
        "Alison: Well, it's practice for when all the Alison's bedside manner jokes start.",
        "Aaron: You don't know that.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. I may not be in the nursing program anymore, but I still have a job at that hospital. I'm gonna have to see those people every single day. And every time I see them, I'm gonna know exactly what they're thinking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Do you realize what you've just admitted to me?",
        "Chris: Well, I don't think you do. Of course, my personal feelings for Ali affected me professionally. I wanted to see her succeed in nursing school.",
        "Bob: But you did go to her supervisor about Alison.",
        "Chris: Well, just to tell Brenda that despite the way Ali started, I thought she had the potential to be a great nurse.",
        "Bob: So you were just praising her abilities?",
        "Chris: I helped her study on occasion, ran a couple practice drills, but that's it, Dad. Come on. You know I have no say in who stays and goes in the nursing program.",
        "Bob: Brenda, is that true?",
        "Brenda: Yes, Dr. Hughes. Alison's work was really subpar. She just wasn't cutting it, so I made the decision to drop her from the program, just as I would have with any other student in her position.",
        "Jack: Well, thank you for your statement. We'll be in touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bud: But Snyder -- he's gonna get charged with assault, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it looks that way.",
        "Kim: So it's true?",
        "Jack: I'm afraid so, Kim.",
        "Kim: And where is he?",
        "Jack: Interrogation room.",
        "Kim: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Oh, Man. You called our boss? What were you thinking?",
        "Katie: I had to. We were supposed to work this afternoon, remember?",
        "Brad: Kim, I'm really sorry about this.",
        "Kim: Oh, I just bet you are.",
        "Brad: Look, as soon as I get out of here, then we'll be able to --",
        "Kim: As soon as you what? You don't get this, do you? You're totally oblivious to your responsibility to the show, to the studio.",
        "Brad: This has got absolutely nothing to do with the show, the studio.",
        "Kim: The hell it doesn't. You think you can keep pulling stunts like this and then come waltzing back into the studio and find your job waiting?",
        "Brad: What are you saying? Are you firing me?",
        "Kim: If the charge sticks, you bet on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Well, from what you tell me and what Brenda said, I don't think you've compromised any hospital policy. But next time, try to be a little more conservative.",
        "Chris: Deal. I have rounds. You're meeting Mom for coffee later?",
        "Bob: Mm-hmm.",
        "Chris: All right. Tell her I said hi.",
        "Bob: Okay. Oh, Susan, I had a talk with Brenda Manning about Alison.",
        "Susan: And? Is she on the \"Chris Hughes can do as he pleases\" bandwagon, too?",
        "Bob: Do you think possibly we could have a civilized conversation like two colleagues?",
        "Susan: Fine, I'm listening.",
        "Bob: Alison was dropped from the program because she couldn't keep up with the rest of the class. It had nothing to do with her relationship with Chris. My guess is that's not a surprise to you.",
        "Susan: No, it isn't. I knew she was having trouble with her studies. I just didn't know how much, as usual.",
        "Bob: Well, next time, do you think you can get all the facts before you put a fellow colleague's reputation on the line?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Kim, Kim, wait, please. I know you're angry with Brad, and so am I, but his job? Is it really in jeopardy?",
        "Kim: Katie, advertisers take exception to on-screen personalities with rap sheets.",
        "Katie: I understand that, but it's not like this is murder one. Janet met the wrong guy. He turned out to be bad news. I mean, I almost don't even blame Brad for hitting him.",
        "Kim: You know what? It's all gonna boil down to, did Brad throw the first punch?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Kim: Okay, then that's who the judge is gonna see. Not Janet, not her bad news guy. Brad. You better hope it doesn't happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Ali, I just spoke to Bob. And maybe it would be best for you to just put this whole thing behind you and move on.",
        "Alison: Meaning what, exactly?",
        "Susan: By your own admission, you were having trouble in class, right?",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't believe this.",
        "Susan: And -- and I should not have jumped to the conclusion that Chris was responsible for the dismissal.",
        "Alison: Oh, right, because I can mess things up on my own so well.",
        "Susan: No, no, I -- if you would just listen to me for a change.",
        "Alison: You know what, Mom? Can't. Thank you for the pep talk, but I took an extra shift at the hospital so I can go mess up some more things.",
        "Susan: I can never say the right thing to her.",
        "Aaron: No, she's not the one who needs to hear it.",
        "Aaron: You know, you're a piece of work, Hughes. Because Alison didn't want you, you had to take the one thing that she did want, and you ruined it.",
        "Chris: Back off, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: What you did to Ali was wrong.",
        "Chris: I didn't do anything! Not that I answer to you, but Alison got kicked out of the nursing program all on her own.",
        "Aaron: And you had nothing to do with it?",
        "Chris: No, I didn't.",
        "Aaron: Nothing?",
        "Chris: No, no.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's bull, okay? Because in the beginning, you bent over backwards to keep her in that program, okay? Tutoring her, getting her that make-up exam. And now, out of nowhere, she came to the farm, and you saw her with me. Suddenly she's not good enough anymore, for your program or for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey, where's my dad? I really want to see him.",
        "Katie: He's fine. He's fine. He's being booked.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God.",
        "Katie: Listen, I don't want you to worry, Liberty. He's gonna be fine. We're gonna work everything out, okay?",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Katie: Janet, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Parker: What are you doing here?",
        "Liberty: Oh, my dad got arrested. It's a total scandal.",
        "Parker: What happened?",
        "Liberty: Oh, you know, just my mother.",
        "Katie: Do you really think it's a good idea for Liberty to be here right now?",
        "Janet: She wanted to see her father.",
        "Katie: Because she saw him being dragged away in handcuffs, and it scared her.",
        "Janet: What, you think this is my fault? I didn't call the cops, Katie.",
        "Katie: No, but it was your honor that Brad was defending. And admit it -- you loved every minute of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You and Ali, you can think what you want, but she got kicked out of that nursing program on her own, Aaron. Running around with you, hanging out at Yo's, spending late nights out at the farm -- maybe if she spent a little more time studying, she could have seen this through, but she didn't. So this is what happened. It's classic Alison. And I'm done with it and her. She's all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, Parker, listen, I was wondering, it's probably gonna be a while before we hear anything about Libby's dad. Could you take her out for a while just to get her mind off things?",
        "Parker: I'll try, but what if she says no?",
        "Janet: Oh, who could say no to a handsome guy like you?",
        "Parker: Right, I'll see what I can do.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Parker: Let's get outta here. This is probably gonna be a while. Katie will call when it's over.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Besides, these fluorescent lights are stunting my growth. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, I get why you blame me for this. In fact, I blame myself. And I'm really embarrassed about this, so if there's anything I can do --",
        "Katie: Jack, hey. How is he?",
        "Jack: Oh, he's fine. Prettiest mug shot in history, don't you think?",
        "Katie: I can't believe Bud is actually pressing charges. Brad could lose his job over this. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Jack: Do you want me to answer that as a cop or as a friend?",
        "Katie: Cop first, so I can complain about you to my friend.",
        "Jack: Okay, well, the only thing that's gonna help Brad right now is if these charges just go away.",
        "Katie: And the friend?",
        "Jack: He's offering you help. Just don't tell the cop. We took down Bud's number when he gave his statement in case we needed to talk to him later. Whoops.",
        "[Jack lays Brad's file opened file on the desk and walks away]",
        "[Katie calls Bud's number]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Ali, Ali, I need to talk to you. Your mother's wrong.",
        "Alison: About what?",
        "Aaron: Chris is the reason you got kicked out of nursing school.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I don't want to do this.",
        "Aaron: Alison, just think about it. Really think about everything that he's done to help you before. Now all of a sudden, he's just washed his hands of the whole thing now.",
        "Alison: Because I don't cut it as a student. Even my mother thinks so.",
        "Aaron: That's not why, Alison. It's because he thinks that you and I are together. And that's why you didn't sleep with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh my God. What is he doing here?",
        "Katie: I'll handle this. Just stay here and don't say anything.",
        "Bud: What do you want?",
        "Katie: Well, first, I just -- I want to thank you for coming back here. I really, really appreciate it.",
        "Bud: Mm-hmm. You said that on the phone. So?",
        "Katie: So I want this mess to go away. I want these charges dropped. What will it take for you to make that happen?",
        "Bud: You're serious, huh? I thought I recognized you when I first saw you. And then I realized you and your punch-drunk boyfriend had that hokey wedding on TV.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Right, that was us.",
        "Bud: So, I guess, Mrs. TV star, the first thing I'd like is some money. You know, to compensate for my emotional distress.",
        "Katie: And second?",
        "Bud: And the second, I want Brad Snyder to look me in the eye and apologize.",
        "Katie: Brad, what are you doing?",
        "Brad: I'm not apologizing to this guy.",
        "Jack: Two words, Brad. Two words, and we're done.",
        "Brad: Okay, you want two words? I'll give you two words. No way.",
        "Bud: Hey, an apology was part of the deal.",
        "Brad: You made a deal with him?",
        "Katie: Yes, I did. To save your butt and your job, and you're ruining it.",
        "Brad: I don't care, Katie. He's not worth it.",
        "Katie: He didn't hit Janet, all right?",
        "Janet: She's right. Bradley, he didn't hit me. Listen to her.",
        "Brad: He pushed you around. In my book, there's no difference, okay? Listen to me, Janet. You're a lady, and you're somebody's mother, and this guy's nothing but a slime ball.",
        "Bud: That's it. Forget you and your deal. I'm outta here. You can rot in jail for all I care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, a lot of what you're saying is true. Chris was on my side for a really long time, and then things went bad and now he's not. But there's also a really good chance I got kicked out of the program 'cause my grades sucked.",
        "Aaron: You passed your exam.",
        "Alison: Barely.",
        "Aaron: It doesn't matter. You passed your exam. You did well enough for Chris to want to keep you in the program. Look, he went to Brenda. He's the one who talked you up. And then all that changed when he thought you and I were together. How can you deny that?",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Aaron: Okay, he did this to get back at you, and that's wrong.",
        "Alison: Look, maybe. But I work here, Aaron. With him, with everybody in the program. I can't -- I can't do this. I'm sorry.",

        "Brad: You have to know that I wasn't gonna apologize to that guy.",
        "Katie: Even to save yourself?",
        "Brad: I am going to be fine.",
        "Katie: You are going to be unemployed and locked up.",
        "Brad: I love you so much for trying, all right? But sometimes you have to stand up for the right thing, no matter what it costs you.",
        "Katie: You make it so hard to be mad at you when you do these asinine things for all the right reasons.",
        "Brad: I'm a complex type of guy.",
        "Jack: Hanson, can you take my brother into the interrogation room, please?",
        "Hanson: Mr. Snyder, if you'd come with me.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Katie: I understand what he's doing. I just wish that, for once, he could just swallow his stupid pride and let this go.",
        "Jack: Have you ever known a Snyder man to do something as smart as that?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Jack: You know the other thing about Snyder men? We never stop thinking. I might have come up with a way to help Brad out of this mess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bud: Whatever you want, you can look for it someplace else. I'm not interested.",
        "Jack: I think you might change your mind after you hear what she has to say.",
        "Bud: I've never met a woman who could change my mind, Pal.",
        "Jack: Well, then, clearly, you haven't met the right woman.",
        "Katie: Never say never, Bud. I'm giving you another chance to drop the charges against my husband.",
        "Bud: Ain't that sweet?",
        "Katie: And I'm still prepared to honor our original agreement, minus the apology.",
        "Bud: Not much of a deal left then, is there?",
        "Katie: Brad can be stubborn and pigheaded sometimes. You're a man. You know how they can be.",
        "Bud: You're winning me over by the minute, Sweetheart.",
        "Katie: It's Katie.",
        "Bud: Okay, Katie, if I'm not getting my apology, then what am I getting?",
        "Katie: Simple. You asked for two things. Since you're not getting one of them, I'll give you more of the other one. Double the other one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Patient's name is Tony Motsi. The doctor's in with him now.",
        "Alison: Got it. Thank you.",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Chris: Mr. Motsi, this is Alison Stewart, one of our nursing aides. She's gonna help you get back on your feet today. Mr. Motsi had a laparoscopic appendectomy.",
        "Alison: Fun.",
        "Patient: Luckily, I was out for most of it.",
        "Chris: Yeah, we need to get him mobile, so take him up and down the hall, couple laps. He should be fine. Run into any problems, just page me.",
        "Alison: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Chris: No need to thank me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So, I still can't believe your idea of a good time is bringing me to this schoolyard.",
        "Parker: I figured it would be someplace new for you.",
        "Liberty: Ooh, tough guy over here makes a funny.",
        "Parker: I guess you made up with your mom.",
        "Liberty: What makes you say that?",
        "Parker: I don't know. She gave me money to take you out to eat.",
        "Liberty: Oh, no. You mean get rid of me. I mean, I stick around, and it takes some of the attention off of her, and we cannot have that.",
        "Parker: That's harsh.",
        "Liberty: The truth usually is.",
        "Parker: So, what exactly happened with Brad? Why did he get arrested?",
        "Liberty: It's the same old story. My mom chooses the wrong guy again, makes a mess again, and my dad had to bail her out. You know, maybe in a few days everyone will just forget about it. Welcome to my world.",
        "Parker: My mom's like that, too. She does these things, and then people get mad at her, but then all of a sudden, they just act like it never happened.",
        "Liberty: Grown-ups rule.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What are you still doing here?",
        "Janet: Catholic guilt. My punishment is waiting it out with you.",
        "Brad: You don't have to. I don't blame you.",
        "Janet: Oh, please, you should. I do. I shouldn't have met that stupid guy Bud for a drink. I could have said no. I should have said no.",
        "Brad: Look, you're not responsible for what he did to you.",
        "Janet: But I could be responsible for getting you fired.",
        "Brad: No, I don't blame you.",
        "Janet: Katie blames me. And I don't blame her for blaming me.",
        "Brad: Don't worry about Katie. There's only one person that Katie's mad at right now, and you're looking at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bud: No thanks.",
        "Katie: You're turning me down?",
        "Bud: How stupid do you think I am? You're a cop, aren't you?",
        "Jack: Detective. Yes, Sir.",
        "Bud: Well, then, how do I know this whole thing isn't some kind of setup?",
        "Jack: It's not. You have my word. I'm strictly here as Katie's friend. And as her friend, I'm telling you, what she's offering you is a lot of money. If you're smart, you take it, and you make this whole thing disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Where is Katie? I mean, what is taking so long to post bail?",
        "Janet: Well, I probably shouldn't say anything, considering the amount of trouble I've already caused, but --",
        "Brad: But what?",
        "Janet: She's not here.",
        "Brad: Where is she?",
        "Janet: With your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You take this case to court, you won't get a settlement anywhere near what Katie's offering you. And Brad -- the worst he'll get is a couple months probation.",
        "Katie: Listen to Jack. If anyone knows how this is gonna go, it's him.",
        "Jack: You know, I think the thing that got hurt most in all of this, Bud, was your pride. I think that money goes a long way to help you healing that.",
        "Bud: Okay. You two got yourselves a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Maria, you got a minute?",
        "Maria: What can I do for you, Dr. Hughes?",
        "Chris: Well, I'm sure you're already aware, but the decision came down today to drop Alison Stewart from the nursing program.",
        "Maria: I was just informed of that by Brenda Manning, yes.",
        "Chris: Well, right. The thing is, I can't speak for the other doctors on staff here, but I'm not comfortable with having her interact with my patients.",
        "Maria: What exactly are you asking me to do here, Dr. Hughes? Remove Alison Stewart from this floor or take her off patient care entirely?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Yoo-hoo. As much as I love our coffee date, I'd much rather have your full attention.",
        "Bob: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drift away.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey. Well, maybe it's the company.",
        "Bob: Impossible.",
        "Kim: Could it possibly be your other true love? Lady Memorial?",
        "Bob: So intuitive.",
        "Kim: Lots of years of practice. You want to talk about it? I mean, I almost put you to sleep telling you about Brad at the police station. Now it's your turn.",
        "Bob: Alison Stewart has been thrown out of the nursing program.",
        "Kim: No. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I mean, that was really important to her, wasn't it?",
        "Bob: Yes, it was, and she's very upset about it.",
        "Kim: I thought Chris was tutoring her.",
        "Bob: He was occasionally.",
        "Kim: Oh, my gosh. Did he get in trouble with the hospital? I mean, because he's a doctor, and she's a student?",
        "Bob: No, no. It's nothing serious like that.",
        "Kim: But it could've been?",
        "Bob: Look, it's nothing to worry about. It's being handled.",
        "Kim: Well, I guess I'm glad that he has you on his side. Gosh, the last thing in the world he needs is another go-around with Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maria: Alison, could I talk to you in private?",
        "Alison: Oh, if this is about nursing school, don't worry. It's not exactly a secret here with my new status.",
        "Maria: A request has been made to have you removed from patient care and placed in an administrative position.",
        "Alison: What? But I was an aide before I ever even thought about the nursing program. One has nothing to do with the other. I don't understand.",
        "Maria: The request came from one of the doctors.",
        "Alison: Who? I'm sorry, but if there's been a complaint about my work, I think I have the right to know.",
        "Maria: It was Dr. Hughes.",
        "Alison: Bob?",
        "Maria: No. Chris Hughes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: It's about time.",
        "Jack: Yes, I'm sorry we were taking so long getting your charges dropped.",
        "Brad: How?",
        "Katie: Does it matter? It's over now.",
        "Brad: It matters to me. I'm the one being charged.",
        "Katie: You were the one being charged.",
        "Brad: You made a deal with that tool, didn't you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I did. And just like you, I'm not gonna apologize for it.",
        "Brad: Even though you know how I feel about it?",
        "Jack: I think what you mean to say is, \"Thank you, Katie. I really appreciate everything you've done for me, because now I'm a free man without a criminal record.\"",
        "Brad: Thank you.",
        "Katie: You're welcome. Now let's go. We gotta get to the studio and see if we can salvage what's left of your job.",
        "Brad: You got it. I just hope they have some doughnuts there. [Janet laughs] So, I'm gonna talk to Liberty, and then I'll have her give you a call.",
        "Janet: Oh, she's gonna be thrilled that everything worked out.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Jack, thank you for this.",
        "Jack: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Okay, I'm not much of a jock, but I know that's not the right kind of ball.",
        "Parker: Just go with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're still here?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Sorry, it's just been a crazy day, you know?",
        "Jack: Yeah. But you were telling the truth about Bud, right? He wasn't the one who gave you that shiner?",
        "Janet: Oh, God, no. Really, I mean, trust me. I am -- I am a total klutz. I can't even put one foot in front of the other without falling over myself. But I guess I owe you for going to bat for Bradley like you did.",
        "Jack: He's my brother. It's part of the job.",
        "Janet: And Katie, too. You went to bat for her. You know, between you and me and that coffee pot over there, it's obvious you still have feelings for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Parker: What is that?",
        "Liberty: Oh, it's my phone. Hello? Oh, hey, Dad. Oh. Yeah, you're a free man. Looks like dinner's on you. Okay, I'll see you at home. Bye. My dad's out.",
        "Parker: That's great.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. See you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Yeah, you kind of went above and beyond the call of duty for the average cop.",
        "Jack: Detective. And I was helping my brother. Not that it's any of your business -- Katie and I are friends.",
        "Janet: Hmm, friends with the ex. That's something I never quite understood. Well, except for Bradley, of course.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, having a kid together must have helped. They're happily married, Janet. You know that, right?",
        "Janet: Are you sure? 'Cause she was seemed really mad at him.",
        "Jack: Well, under the circumstances, I'd say that was understandable. But I wouldn't read too much into it, if you know what I mean.",
        "Janet: I gotta go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So the charges have been dropped? Oh, joy, oh, rapture. I'm ecstatic.",
        "Katie: So are we.",
        "Brad: So I still have a job?",
        "Kim: Well, for now, until the next time you make some bonehead move, which, for everybody's sake, I hope is never. Now, you and I still have to talk about your trip. You get settled and then come find me, okay?",
        "Katie: Will do. Thank you. Oh, no. Stop. You really think that's gonna work on me after what you've done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: We need to talk.",
        "Chris: I have patients to see.",
        "Alison: Your patients can wait.",
        "Chris: If this is more grief about getting you kicked out of the nursing program, I had nothing to do with it. So, now that that's settled.",
        "Alison: How about having me removed from patient care? You didn't have anything to do with that, either? You had no right to do that to me, Chris. I am a good nurse's aide. I have never had a single complaint until now, until you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Susan.",
        "Susan: What? I don't want to get into anything about Alison.",
        "Aaron: Susan, please just listen to me, okay? This is not Alison's fault. Chris did this. Chris is the reason she's not in nursing school anymore. This whole thing with the grades? That's bogus. She's out because she didn't sleep with him.",
        "Susan: You don't know that.",
        "Aaron: I do know this. And so does Alison. Chris even knows it. You know why? You know what he just did? He just had her removed from patient care.",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Alison just called me. She's not gonna let this go now.",
        "Susan: She's gonna fight the dismissal? Do you have any idea what that means? All the things that are gonna happen because of that?",
        "Aaron: Mm-hmm. Yes, and so does Alison. And she needs you on her side. And you'd better be there for her this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I thought you were better than this.",
        "Chris: You're judging me?",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you think you're the only one allowed around here to call it like they see it?",
        "Chris: Give me a break.",
        "Alison: You're a big man, aren't you, Chris? Using your influence to get me barred from every square inch of this hospital? You just snap your fingers, and you get whatever you want handed to you. Well, you know the funny thing about big men? When they fall, they fall real hard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Here's what I don't get. If I can overlook the fact that you and Jack worked out some deal with Bud, how come you can't overlook what I did?",
        "Katie: Because what I did didn't get me arrested and almost cost me my job.",
        "Brad: Is that really what you're angry about? Or are you mad the fact that I ran to Janet's rescue?",
        "Katie: Oh, Janet, who didn't need to be rescued? That Janet?",
        "Brad: Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. When I got there, he was roughing her up, okay? Now, I would have done the same thing if it was any other woman. If it had been you he was doing that to, it would have been much, much worse. Okay? I love you. I do not want to fight on the last night that we're together. So can we just please, please, Katie, can we please let this go? Please?",
        "Katie: Say it one more time.",
        "Brad: Please?",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. Fine. Fine. It's dropped.",
        "Brad: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Janet just better hope she doesn't get in trouble while I'm gone.",

        "Luke: I am staying here until I find Noah. I am not leaving without him.",
        "Noah: I won't let you use her, Dad. You'll have to kill me first.",
        "Chris: This is crazy. How does Alison think she can sue me for sexual harassment and win?",
        "Bob: Stay clear of Alison from now on, and that's an order.",
        "Lily: We'll talk when you drop your girls off. Catch up on things.",
