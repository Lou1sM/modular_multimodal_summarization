Katie faints during the taping and is rushed to the hospital. The doctor informs Katie that the baby is fine but her elevated blood pressure is an early sign of preeclampsia and she must be on bed rest for her entire pregnancy. Vienna finishes the reality show segment with Brad and he asks Kim if he can be the host of Oakdale now again. Kim tells Brad the show works best with a co- host so Vienna agrees to fill in for Katie. Katie thinks its a wonderful idea but Henry is worried that Vienna will be spending to much time with Brad. Vienna tells Henry she loves him and she must do the show for the sake of Katie's baby. Katie and Henry make up after Henry realizes that he would have felt terrible if Katie had lost her baby."

        "Brad: I know. And the only way it can is for you to take care of yourself. Now, are you sure that doing this taping is not gonna, you know, be too much stress on you?",

        "Henry: Sweetheart, you're not lis -- you're not listening to me. You're -- you're not. Listen. Honey. This reality TV show is not part of my reality, okay? And I'm not going, and I don't think you should, either.",

        "Edna: Well, don't expect me to take the blame. If you're planning on telling an officer of the law that that baby is my granddaughter, I'll say you're lying.",

        "Henry: Sweetie, the studio is where you fell. It's where we lost our baby. How can you even think of going back there?",
        "Vienna: I know it might be painful, but this might be the closure we need.",
        "Henry: It -- it might be. It might -- it might reopen the wound. I don't know about you, but it's still pretty raw for me right now. I'm not as angry as I was, okay?

        "Bonnie: Dusty, take it down a notch.",

        "Rosanna: Shh! Can you fix it?",
        "Paul: Can I -- no. But call a tow truck. We'll just -- might cost an arm and a leg.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I had to leave my purse behind. How much money do you have?",
        "Paul: Me? I'm broke.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Rosanna: You're broke? Wow. Great. Okay. So what do we do now?",

        "Dusty: She knows more than she's saying.",
        "Bonnie: You know what? It's time for a different approach. You're getting us nowhere. I am so sorry for my friend. He's -- I know he can be a little intense. But he's just worried sick about the baby.",
        "Edna: I don't know why he thinks I know where that child is. I have nothing to do with this.",
        "Bonnie: I'm so sure that that's true, but it's just once the police get involved, it gets kind of complicated. Actually, you know what? I'm a lawyer. So if you need any free legal advice, just call me anytime.",
        "Edna: I don't know why I would need a lawyer. I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Bonnie: No. I -- I don't want to pressure you, believe me. I just want to find this baby and bring her home to her mother. She's -- she's actually quite a fine young woman. She lives on this farm a lot like yours with her family.",
        "Edna: I didn't know that.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah! It's -- it's a really special place for a child. It's, um -- it's a lot of people surround her and love her a lot. And I'm just afraid if we don't track down Paul, she's never gonna see those people again. That would just be a terrible shame, don't you think?",
        "Edna: Yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah.",
        "Edna: Yeah, it would.",
        "Bonnie: Gosh. You know, once she's home and safe, I'll make sure that nothing happens to you. I promise. And I'm sure the police will leave you and your beautiful farm alone. But, Edna, could you -- I mean, could you just give us any clue to where you think Paul might have taken the baby?",
        "Edna: I don't know where they were headed, but they were going south on Route 6.",
        "Bonnie: Route 6. That could really help. Thank you. Thank you so much. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine.",
        "Len: I'm sorry, Edna. I do have to take you into town.",
        "Bonnie: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Where?",
        "Bonnie: Do you want us to find Meg's baby or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Okey-doke! Five seconds! And stand by. 5, 4, 3, 2 --",

        "Katie: I still can't believe it.",
        "Brad: I know, I know! It's amazing!",
        "Katie: We've been dreaming about this for so long, but we thought that I couldn't get pregnant, you know, the usual way. So Brad and I were trying to have the baby using surrogate mother.",
        "Brad: We also tried a couple times with the whole test-tube thing, but while the doctors were trying to make a baby in the biology lab, Katie and I ended up -- we ended up making one with old-fashioned --",
        "[Brad whistles]",
        "Brad: You know biology.",
        "[Brad laughs]",
        "Katie: It wasn't supposed to be possible, but it did happen. And you've been with us this entire time, so we wanted to share our good news with you. Um, trying to get pregnant has been a roller-coaster ride.",
        "Brad: With, uh, real -- real highs and real lows.",
        "Katie: We tried in vitro, adoption, and using a surrogate mother. As you know, Vienna, our friend, was willing to carry Brad's baby.",
        "Brad: And for a while there, we thought the baby was mine. But then --",
        "Katie: Uh, sadly, Vienna lost her baby. Vienna, I know that our audience would like to express their sympathy to you. Brad and I feel your loss so deeply, and we're so grateful for what you are trying to do for us.",
        "Vienna: I, um -- I really wanted to give my, uh -- my friends, uh, a baby. And -- and it just didn't happen. But now I'm just so happy that, uh, Katie is having a baby of her own with Brad, and it's just the perfect, happy ending, right, Katie? Katie?",
        "[Katie gasps]",
        "Brad: Katie. Katie!",
        "Kim: Cut, cut!",

        "Rosanna: So now what do we do?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I have no idea. But --",
        "[Eliza cries]",
        "Paul: Eliza's probably hungry.",
        "Rosanna: Aw. Paul, how are we gonna feed the baby with no money? I mean, maybe this is a sign. Maybe, uh -- maybe you should take the baby back to Meg.",
        "Paul: No! I am not -- not giving up my daughter. I'm not. I'll figure something out.",
        "[Eliza crying]",
        "Paul: You know what? Why don't we go to that diner back there and -- well, maybe they'll give us some milk.",
        "Rosanna: For free?",
        "Paul: Unless you got a better idea.",
        "Rosanna: Wait, wait, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Hi there. Hi. Um, I was wondering if you could help us with something. Did this man check in this afternoon with this baby?",
        "Dusty: There's an APB out on the guy.",
        "Innkeeper: Nope. I haven't seen him. I'd remember a cute kid like that.",
        "Bonnie: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: What'd I tell you? He's not gonna stop at a motel with the cops after him.",
        "Bonnie: Right now, the baby needs to sleep.",
        "Dusty: She can sleep in the car. He's trying to get as far away as he can.",
        "Bonnie: But he still needs to take a break. So unless he can master the art of sleeping while he's driving --",
        "Dusty: He's going south. Let's keep going until we find him.",
        "Bonnie: We can't do that?",
        "Dusty: Why not? You got a better idea?",
        "Bonnie: I -- I'm just feeling sick all of the sudden.",
        "Dusty: How sick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, we hate to impose on you, but, uh, our baby's hungry.",
        "Paul: Car broke down up the road, and we don't have enough money to fix it or buy baby food.",
        "Rosanna: We -- we lost both our jobs in Detroit.",
        "Paul: Right, 'cause of the -- the layoffs.",
        "Rosanna: And, um, we're -- we're on our way to visit my mother and stay with her for a little while until we can get back on our feet. She -- she's in Tennessee.",
        "Paul: Yeah. We -- we haven't seen her since -- since the wedding.",
        "Rosanna: Um --",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. We sold both our rings to buy the car.",
        "Paul: Which turned out to be a real lemon, you know? I mean, we thought we'd get to Memphis, but now we're stuck.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Do you think you could help us?",
        "Paul: We'll work for food.",
        "Mr. Kent: Sorry, I'm not hiring anyone right now.",
        "Paul: Really? 'Cause I saw a great, big pile of dishes back there in the kitchen. And, you know, I'd -- I'd wash the whole stack if you'll just help us out.",
        "Rosanna: Please. Please don't let our baby go hungry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why did I do this? I jinxed myself.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, relax. We got here in time. I'm sure everything is going to be okay. I want you to just meditate on good things.",
        "Vienna: Yes. You and your baby are in very good hands, okay?",

        "Vienna: I'm fine. It's Katie. She fainted, and we don't know why. We had to call an ambulance.",

        "Katie: You can see my history. You know what we've been through. So if it's bad, please, don't sugarcoat it. If I'm gonna lose my baby, just tell me now.",

        "Katie: Oh, thank God!",
        "Brad: So, why did she lose consciousness? I mean, is there -- is there a problem?",
        "Doctor: She has elevated blood pressure, which could lead to preeclampsia. To avoid complications, she'll need bed rest.",
        "Brad: For how long?",
        "Katie: I think she means the rest of the pregnancy, right?",
        "Brad: Okay, hold on. So that means she has to stay in bed for like what, 24/7?",
        "Doctor: And avoid all stress.",
        "Brad: Okay, so that means -- that means no work -- no arguing with her husband. Agreeing with everything he says. I like it. That's good.",

        "Brad: Take deep breaths and think positive thoughts.",

        "Kim: So now, Brad, tell me, what happens with Katie? Are they gonna keep her in the hospital for a while?",
        "Brad: No, no. She'll be able to leave by the end of the day. But she's got to go straight to bed the second she gets home.",
        "Vienna: Yes, and she needs to stay there.",
        "Brad: Right, right. The doctor says as long as she takes it easy that the pregnancy should progress as normal. But she absolutely cannot come back to work until the baby is born.",
        "Kim: Okay, okay. Whatever it takes to have a healthy baby. That's the most important thing. You know, we'll just put the show on hiatus, and when she's ready to come back, we'll start up again.",
        "Brad: Well, um -- I'm available. And you did say that if I did those reality segments, I could get my old job back, you know? So what do you say? You want to see what it's like for me to fly solo?",
        "Kim: Well, you know what? This has absolutely nothing to do with you personally, but the show works best with a co host.",
        "Vienna: Well, what if -- what if I do the show with Brad? You know, you said we worked good together.",
        "Kim: Oh, you did. You were wonderful. And the camera certainly loves you.",
        "Brad: Would you really be interested?",
        "Vienna: Of course! Absolutely!",
        "Brad: So, what do you say? What -- what do you think? Do you think it could work?",
        "Kim: I don't know. It certainly would be a different dynamic. But listen, let's do a trial show, and see if we get some sparks, hmm?",
        "Vienna: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. Hey, are you really sure about this?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, of course. You know, I said to Katie I would do anything for her, and I meant it.",
        "Brad: I just -- I just wonder how Henry's gonna feel about it.",
        "Vienna: Don't worry. Henry will not be a problem. I guarantee it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry, you didn't have to bring those over. I'm not gonna be in the hospital for long.",
        "Henry: Well, just bring them home with you, then. Tell Brad to change the water and throw this little packet of stuff in. It's -- I think it's plant steroids, though, so you make sure you stay away from it, all right?",
        "Katie: I'll be careful.",
        "Henry: You'd better be. Come over to your house and give you big trouble.",
        "Katie: Honestly, I didn't know if you were speaking to me yet.",

        "Katie: You know what I mean? For a while there, I thought I lost you.",
        "Henry: Vienna said you were in the hospital, just the thought of you losing the baby, I -- I got so worried, I think I broke the sound barrier getting over here.",
        "Katie: Must have been too close to home, though, with Vienna being here not that long ago. And I wouldn't blame you if you thought that I deserved what happened to her.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, don't say that. Don't say that.",
        "Katie: Well, it's a logical question. Why should I get to keep my baby when Vienna lost hers?",
        "Henry: You can't think that way, baby, okay? You can't.",
        "Katie: I just wish I could go back and change what happened.",
        "Henry: So do I. We got to put the past behind us, though, okay, and look to the future. This kid right here -- that is the future. So you hold on with both hands and don't let go.",
        "Katie: Just feels wrong to be happy when you're so sad.",
        "Henry: Happiness comes and happiness goes. Friendship is for keeps. As long as you're my best friend, all's right in my world.",
        "Katie: Mine too.",
        "Vienna: Well, I hope Henry's been taking good care of you.",
        "Katie: He's been an angel.",
        "Brad: Look what I've got. I got your release papers. Are you ready to go home, put your feet up, and take it easy until the baby comes?",
        "Katie: Not really, but if I have to do this bed rest thing, at least I can be in my own bed.",
        "Brad: Dr. Love is in the house.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Katie: So, how did it go at the studio?",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. It was amazing.",
        "Brad: Okay, I -- I know you hate it that you can't do the show right now, but there is good news. Kim made good on her promise. She gave me my old job back.",
        "[Katie gasps]",
        "Katie: That's fantastic!",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah. So, how does that work? Are you -- you're gonna do it alone?",
        "Brad: Actually, Vienna is gonna fill in for Katie.",
        "Henry: She what?",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. That's great!",
        "Vienna: I thought if being Brad's partner will keep the show going, I thought you'd want me to do it.",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "Brad: I mean, it's not -- it's not set in stone. We just -- we're gonna do a test show.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, they have to see if we have the chemistry.",
        "Henry: \"Chemistry\"? What does chemistry have to do with anything?",
        "Brad: That just -- I mean, that's just how they describe, you know, how two people kind of -- how they work together on camera.",
        "Henry: That's funny, because it doesn't sound like a work word to me.",
        "Katie: I think Vienna and Brad will have great chemistry.",
        "Vienna: Yeah! On air, okay? On the air. So, I promise I will take good care of him at the studio.",
        "Henry: What does that mean?",
        "Vienna: What's the matter?",
        "Henry: What do you mean what's the matter? I think you know what the matter is.",
        "Katie: Henry, is there a problem?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. No problem.",
        "Henry: Speak for yourself, Sweetheart.",
        "Vienna: Okay. Um, she doesn't need any stress right now. Katie needs to rest. So you know what? We're gonna go.",

        "Katie: Of course I am. You know how much it means getting your job back.",
        "Brad: I know, I know. It's just I promised that I was gonna be with you 24/7. And if I'm gonna be at the studio a lot, it's just gonna cut down on the time I have to wait on you hand and foot.",
        "Katie: You cannot spend every waking moment with me in bed.",
        "Brad: Well, I can if I'm lucky. Seriously, I can -- I can reschedule my TV comeback for -- for later on. The most important thing to me is -- is making sure you and the baby are healthy.",

        "Brad: Hey, Junior. Okay, hey, this is your manager/daddy speaking. When you're born, your mommy's up to it, we're gonna take you to \"Oakdale Now,\" and we're gonna put you on the show and teach you how to host the show.",
