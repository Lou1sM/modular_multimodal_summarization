Liberty tells Gabriel not to feel guilty because Craig tried to kill him and he belongs in jail. Parker tells Gabriel to stay away from Liberty but later Gabriel tries to kiss Liberty and she backs away from him. Liberty tells Parker she doesn't have time to worry about him and Gabriel fighting over her because she needs to concentrate on school so she can graduate with her class because she owes that to her mom and dad after everything they have done for her.

        "Carly and Jack continue to argue because Jack won't let the case go and she fears that parker could end up in jail if Jack keeps trying to find out the truth about the fore. Parker interrupts their fight and is tired of them fighting about him but Jack and Carly tell him they always have spirited discussions about what is best for their children. Carly goes to the evidence room and almost steals the glass angel that used to be on her desk at the office. Jack catches her before she can leave and she not so accidentally drops the glass figurine on the floor and it breaks. Jack tells Craig that he believes his story and will do his best to prove it so that he can get out of jail. Craig warns Jack that Carly is toxic to any man and that loving her made him do things that he didn't want to do. Craig tells Jack that Carly will make him do things that are against his moral code and he should get away from her before she pushes him to the edge. Jack tells Craig that all of this is his fault and leaves because he doesn't want to hear anything else Craig has to say about Carly.",
        "Faith makes Lily realize that she should tell Holden how she feels before things get serious between Holden and Molly. Holden saves Molly from Silas and ties him to a chair. Holden goes to call the police from his phone that he left in his car while Silas taunts Molly. Silas tells Molly that she will be happy living a normal life with a boring farmer because she was born to be a cheap and dirty prostitute. Silas also tells Molly that when he gets out of jail after serving his time he will find her and force her to be his prostitute forever. Molly can't take anymore and shoots Silas who is dead when Holden returns from the car. Holden tells Molly to tell the police everything Silas did to her so that they will know she shot him in self defense. Holden and Molly return to the farm where Holden feels like he let Molly down because she felt she couldn't come to him and ask him for help with Silas. Holden wants to prove to Molly how much he loves her and that she can trust him so he proposes to her. Lily hears the proposal from the pirch since she was going to tell Holden how she feels about him."

        "Jack: I don't want to fight with you, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, maybe you could have thought of that before you started to interrogate Gabriel at Lily's party.",
        "Jack: I wasn't interrogating him. I was asking him what happened when Craig supposedly attacked him.",
        "Carly: What do you mean \"Supposedly\"? Gabriel told the police that Craig is the one who knocked him out and left him there to die in that fire.",
        "Jack: And you know how Gabriel claims Craig did that? With that little angel figurine you kept on your desk.",
        "Carly: I don't understand why you have to question every single bit of his story.",
        "Jack: How much do you think that thing weighs? A pound? 18 ounces maybe? Ballpark?",
        "Carly: You're off the case.",
        "Jack: Technically.",
        "Carly: Officially. So just let it go, okay?",
        "Jack: I can't do that. Gabriel's story just doesn't add up.",
        "Carly: It's an open and shut case.",
        "Jack: If we take Gabriel's word for it.",
        "Carly: He was there!",
        "Jack: Okay. We're supposed to believe that Parker knocks Gabriel out, Gabriel wakes up, only to be knocked out by Craig holding this -- this angel figurine over him? I need to know the truth.",
        "Carly: The truth is that Parker is free, and we have a chance to have a fantastic life together, unless you ruin it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Gabriel: Hey.",
        "Parker: I see you're not in a coma anymore.",
        "[Gabriel scoffs]",
        "Parker: Look, I need to talk to you.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, I got nothing to say to you, man.",
        "Parker: It's about Liberty.",
        "[Gabriel sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Dude, this is a totally awesome dragon.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Liberty: Oh, I bet I know who that is. Relax, Dusty. Everything is cool.",
        "Craig: \"Cool\" works for me.",
        "Liberty: Craig, hi. How are you?",
        "Craig: I'll be better when I hear my son's voice. Could you put Johnny on?",
        "Liberty: Um, I'm not sure if Dusty would be okay with that.",
        "Craig: Liberty, I'd like to talk to my son. Would you put him on the phone please?",
        "Liberty: Hang on.",
        "Johnny: Daddy!",
        "Craig: Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Who's that guy who sounds so old on the phone? That can't be my little guy. That must be some humongous football player.",
        "[Johnny laughs]",
        "Craig: Oh, it's good to hear you laugh, Buddy. Hey, I just wanted to call and tell you that I miss you, and I hope you're having fun with Liberty. I wish I could be there with you. Hey, uh, listen, Son, um, you remember the other day when you came to see me and we talked about your brother Gabriel, and -- and I said you should go see him? Well, I want you to tell Liberty that you'd like to see him, and then you can talk to Gabriel, and you can tell him that you -- you want us all to be together as a family. Can you do that?",
        "Johnny: Okay.",
        "Craig: That's my boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Why didn't you go after Dad?",
        "Lily: You know what, Sweetie? I can take care of the rest of this.",
        "Faith: Seriously, you have this big kiss, and then nothing.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] It wasn't a big kiss, okay? It was just a -- a gesture of affection.",
        "Faith: You're not fooling anyone, Mom. You kissed him with your eyes closed. That always means something.",
        "Lily: All right. I still have feelings for your father. Are you happy now?",
        "Faith: So what's your next move?",
        "Lily: I will probably finish cleaning up and then go to bed.",
        "Faith: Alone?",
        "Lily: Enough, Faith.",
        "Faith: But you kissed him.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] Sweetie, listen to me. Yes, I kissed your father. He wasn't exactly thrilled about it. And it doesn't mean what you think it does.",
        "Faith: Really?",
        "Lily: Yes, really.",
        "Faith: So you're not trying to break up Dad and Molly?",
        "Lily: No, I'm not.",
        "Faith: Come on, Mom. You totally are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Let go of me!",
        "Holden: Get off her!",
        "[Molly sobs]",
        "Silas: But she loves it rough. Isn't that right?",
        "Holden: You stupid son of a bitch.",
        "Silas: Oh, I know. It's hard to play the hero when the girl begs me to give her what she wants.",
        "Holden: Shut your mouth.",
        "Silas: She loves a camera, and vice versa. I'm telling you, she gets all hot and bothered when she sees that little red light go off. Turns into a real spitfire.",
        "Molly: Holden --",
        "Holden: I've got you. I've got you.",
        "[Molly sobs]",
        "Holden: It's all right.",
        "Molly: Thank God you got my message.",
        "Holden: He didn't?",
        "Molly: But he would have if you hadn't gotten here. He was kind of okay when I first got here, but then he disappeared, and when he came back, he was high, and he wouldn't let me go.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry.",
        "Molly: I'm so glad you're here now.",
        "Holden: What were you doing here? Why did you come out here like this to meet him?",
        "Molly: I didn't know we were going to be alone. He said that he wanted to meet in a public place so I would feel safe, but it was just a lie.",
        "Holden: What about the other things he said, about the video of the two of you?",
        "Molly: I wish I could say that was a lie, too, but it's not. He said that he was going to send them to you if I didn't come, and I didn't want my mistakes to embarrass you any more than they already have. I really thought that I could handle it by myself. I am so sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay. It's over now. It's over.",
        "Molly: [Gasps] Holden --",
        "Holden: Its okay, Molly. I'm going to call the sheriff's department. They're going to come here. They're going to arrest him. And you're never going to have to see him again. I need your phone.",
        "Molly: He smashed it.",
        "Holden: All right. I left mine in the car. I'm going to have to go out there and get it.",
        "Molly: Okay.",
        "Holden: You going to be okay?",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Holden: I won't be long.",
        "Silas: Tell him to take his time.",
        "Molly: Don't talk to me. Don't.",
        "Silas: You think you've got this squeaky-clean, fresh start life on tap with your farmer. Sorry, Sweetheart. It doesn't work that way.",
        "Molly: Just shut up!",
        "Silas: I just can't leave behind what we had. It was special, hot. Videos don't lie. You know that naughty woman crawling all over me? That's the real you.",
        "Molly: Stop it, stop it, stop it.",
        "Silas: You can change your bedmates, Molly, but you can't change who you are.",
        "Molly: I'm not listening to this, Silas.",
        "Silas: You'll never be happy on that farm with that straight arrow, Holden Snyder, and his picket-fence family.",
        "Molly: That is not true. That is not true! Holden loves me.",
        "Silas: Loves you?",
        "Molly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Silas: [Laughs] You are fooling yourself. He doesn't love you. Now don't get me wrong. You've got a lot to offer a man. You sure do. But as a mistress, not a wife.",
        "Molly: I swear, Silas, if you don't keep your mouth shut --",
        "Silas: It's just the way you're built, Babe -- cheap and dirty. And I've got the footage to prove it.",
        "Molly: I said shut the hell up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, I know you don't think I deserve to get your father back, and you're probably right, given the fact that I married Damian so quickly after we thought we lost your father. But it's pointless anyway, because he's with Molly now, and he's happy.",
        "Faith: He's not with Molly right now.",
        "Lily: Don't even go there. What you saw between your father and me was -- was just a moment where I was feeling disillusioned and fragile, and your father was there for me, like he's been for most of my life. I don't expect you to understand it, and I really don't think I should have to explain myself to you. Some things, some feelings, are private.",
        "Faith: So I guess you'll just go back to finishing cleaning up and go to bed like you said, huh?",
        "Lily: Maybe not. I might curl up with a book first.",
        "Faith: You know, Mom, I do know what makes you happy, or should I say who, and I don't want you to be miserable -- most of the time.",
        "Lily: Faith Snyder, that's the nicest thing you've said to me in months.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: You want to talk? Go ahead. Do it.",
        "Parker: Okay. First of all, I'd say that we're even now.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, how do you figure that?",
        "Parker: Well, you stole a lot of money from my trust fund, and I got back at you, which kind of balances things out.",
        "Gabriel: You sucker-punched me, man. You think that makes everything cool?",
        "Parker: Okay, so we might not be exactly even. But at least it's all over now, right?",
        "Gabriel: [Scoffs] I thought you said you wanted to talk about Liberty.",
        "Parker: I do, okay? If you want to keep things cool between us, you'll stay away from her.",
        "Gabriel: Look, she can hang out with whoever she wants.",
        "Parker: Not when it comes to you.",
        "Gabriel: Why? 'Cause -- 'cause she likes me?",
        "Parker: No, no. She actually -- she feels sorry for you, and you take advantage of that.",
        "Gabriel: Really?",
        "Parker: Yeah. All that Liberty's ever done to you is be nice. And what do you do? You turn around and get her arrested for being in a stolen car. I don't want Liberty to get hurt the next time you do something stupid.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, man.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Gabriel: Your memory must be shot. 'Cause when I pointed my finger at Craig, I saved your butt, remember? Was that stupid, too, huh? You -- you should be thanking me, not threatening me. Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey. Johnny, take it easy. Don't knock the guy over. Sorry. He, uh, wouldn't leave me alone till I promised to help find you. Hey, Parker.",
        "Parker: Hi.",
        "[Gabriel sighs]",
        "Liberty: What's going on?",
        "Parker: Nothing. See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why do you act like you're the only person who hasn't Parker's interests at heart?",
        "Carly: Because sometimes that's exactly how I feel.",
        "Jack: Oh Carly, if I could just make you see that I am trying to help Parker, too.",
        "Carly: Oh, really? 'Cause it seems to me like you're bending over backwards to be sure he's put in jail again.",
        "Jack: How am I doing that?",
        "Carly: Because you're -- you're poking holes in Gabriel's story.",
        "Jack: And you don't think that Tom -- Tom Hughes is going to poke the very same holes in the story?!",
        "Carly: Maybe he will, but that's his job. Let him do it.",
        "Jack: Okay. This entire case hinges on one person's testimony -- Gabriel's. And he's made no secret of the fact that he hates Craig.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. And he got his revenge. He blackmailed Craig when he found out that Craig was stealing from Parker. That's why Craig tried to kill him.",
        "Jack: The only problem I have with that is how.",
        "Carly: How what?",
        "Jack: The angel, Carly -- the glass angel that Gabriel said Craig attacked him with. I saw it when they were gathering the evidence. It's still intact.",
        "Carly: So?",
        "Jack: So if Craig had used it to hit Gabriel with the amount of force it would take to knock him out, the thing would be in a million pieces!",
        "Carly: For Pete's sake, Jack, would you let it go?! For Parker's sake, for my sanity, would you let it go?!",
        "Jack: I can't do that.",
        "Carly: Of course you can't.",
        "Jack: No, Carly, and it's not because I'm stubborn or -- or obsessed or contrary. It's because I'm trying to do what's right here.",
        "Carly: The right thing to do is to protect our son. And if you don't understand that, we have nothing left to talk about.",
        "Parker: Great. You're fighting again.",
        "Carly: Parker, we're not fighting.",
        "Parker: Well, you could have fooled me.",
        "Carly: We're not. We were just debating where to have our family vacation this summer.",
        "Parker: That's a nice try. But I know you guys were fighting, and I want to know if it was about me.",
        "Carly: No, we -- honestly, we were having a heated discussion about where to have our vacation. And it had nothing to do with you, honestly.",
        "Jack: Your mother's right. It's nothing for you to worry about, especially with finals coming up.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You should be concentrating on -- on this, whatever this is. Your calculus. Jack, maybe you could help him study, okay?",
        "Jack: Calculus?",
        "Carly: Yeah. And I'll go to the library, and I'll get some information on whatever future vacation destination we're going to have. Okay? Bye.",
        "Parker: I hate it when you guys fight.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, there's an upside. It means that we really care.",
        "Parker: About winning the fight.",
        "Jack: No, about the three of you. Nothing means more to us than you guys.",
        "Parker: So this was about me?",
        "Jack: Okay, I can't really tell you that. What I can tell you is that whenever we do argue about you, it means we want what's best for you, Parker.",
        "Parker: If only you guys could agree on what that is.",
        "Jack: Hey, what about the -- what about calculus?",
        "Parker: Forget about it. You're off the hook, okay? I need to spend some time on U.S. History. Like they say, otherwise I'll repeat it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: What's that you got there? A turtle?",
        "Liberty: [Whispering] I think it's an alligator.",
        "Gabriel: What's he got in his hand or his paw, a banana?",
        "Liberty: Uh, a baseball bat.",
        "Gabriel: That's very cool.",
        "Liberty: Johnny, that reminds me, we should try to see a Cubs game this season. The three of us could even go maybe. Does that sound good? You want there to be four? Who's the fourth?",
        "Gabriel: Probably Parker.",
        "Johnny: I want my daddy to come because I miss him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Just what we need -- another jailhouse lawyer.",
        "Craig: Heaven helps those who help themselves.",
        "Jack: Tom's not going to appreciate second-guessing him in court.",
        "Craig: You want something, Jack, or you just came down to savor the sight of me in a glorified cattle pen?",
        "Jack: No. I've been thinking about your case.",
        "Craig: Any particular reason.",
        "Jack: I was thinking that it might not have to go to trial.",
        "Craig: Why? You know something I don't?",
        "Jack: More like the other way around. You see, there are some inconsistencies with what exactly happened on the day of the fire. And if you can clear them up for me, there's an outside chance that you might not need that.",
        "Craig: I'll take any chance I can get. Hit me with your first question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Carly: Hi, Kenny.",
        "Kenny: Hey. How have you been, Ms. Tenney?",
        "Carly: Oh, come on now. We've known each other for a lot of years. You should call me Carly. You are looking really good. You know that? So, um, listen. Actually, I'm here to do Jack a little favor. He was here yesterday. He was going through some evidence boxes. And I think somehow he lost his watch in the process. So I -- I was wondering if I could just take a look around, see if I can find it. It won't take long, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So that's why I haven't seen this in a while. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Holden will be back any second. Sheriffs are on their way. If you know what's good for you, you will keep your mouth shut.",
        "Silas: Oh, I know what's good for me. And so do you. Do you remember that night, the carriage ride through central park?",
        "Molly: Quiet!",
        "Silas: I like the gun thing. Very sexy in a film noir kind of way. We'll use it in our next video.",
        "Molly: There isn't going to be a next video, Silas. We're done. We've over. We've been over for a long time! I love Holden. You, my friend, are going back to jail where you belong. Sit still!",
        "Silas: I'll show you a magic trick. Ta-da.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God.",
        "Molly: Holden!",
        "Silas: Don't worry. I'm not going to try anything. I don't have to. I'm already thinking ahead. I'll go to jail, but just for little while, because I'll beat whatever I'm charged with. You know I have the connections to do that. And then I'll come back.",
        "Molly: No, never.",
        "Silas: You know what's going to happen, Molly. It's just a question of how. And if you need persuasion, I can always share our videos with your family and friends.",
        "Molly: No! No!",
        "Silas: And I'm hoping you'll realize all by yourself that you belong to me and no one else, and certainly not that pathetic farmer. He's too tame. You'll grow bored. He doesn't have what excites you -- money, power. You see, Molly, what you are is a whore. [Echoing] Whore. But you're my whore, then, now, forever. [Echoing] Whore.",
        "Molly: No!",
        "Holden: Molly \u0096",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Molly: He wouldn't stop! He kept -- he said he was going to -- and I didn't know what to do. And I -- I had to --",
        "Holden: Molly, give me the gun.",
        "Molly: Is he? No. No! No.",
        "Holden: Molly, look at me. He can't hurt you. Now, just give me the gun, okay?",
        "Molly: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: Its okay, it's okay. It's over now. It's okay.",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "Molly: We have to go.",
        "Holden: No, we can't. We can't. I called the sheriff's department. They know that we're here.",
        "Molly: What -- what do we do?",
        "Holden: We need to wait. We need to wait. We need to tell them what happened.",
        "Molly: We can't, Holden. They're not going to understand.",
        "Holden: You need to do that. They will understand, all right? Silas -- he stalked you. He tried to kill you. He was high. He was irrational. He wanted sex from you. You tried to reason with him. He wouldn't listen. He tried to rape you.",
        "Molly: That's not what happened.",
        "Holden: Molly, when I walked in, he was on top of you. He would have. You need to tell that to the sheriff. You did what you had to do. All right? You shot him. You had no choice. It was self-defense. You understand?",

        "Holden: This isn't good. You can't be doing housework on your wedding day.",
        "Lily: Wedding day?",
        "Faith: This is so cool, you and Daddy getting married again, and I'm the maid of honor. We really are a family again. Here.",
        "Lily: And you're happy about this?",
        "Faith: It's only the best day ever.",
        "Lily: You're not upset that your daddy is marrying me instead of Molly?",
        "Faith: No way. Molly was just his transitional female.",
        "Lily: His what?",
        "Faith: We learned about it in sex and human hygiene class. It's kind of like a substitute teacher, with privileges.",
        "Holden: Lily, I felt like I was dead without you. I can honestly say that when I came back from the grave and I saw you marrying --",
        "Faith: Don't say his name.",
        "Holden: I felt like I had died, and my heart, it was just broken. I knew then that you were the only woman that could ever make me feel alive, and I am so grateful to have a second chance with you. You and I are now and forever a part of each other. I love you.",

        "Lily: He's not with Molly right now. What you're thinking of doing is insane! What's the worst that can happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Johnny, your daddy misses you, too, and he loves you more than you can believe.",
        "Johnny: Then why isn't he here?",
        "Liberty: Because he's super-busy helping the police with something that's really important right now, okay? But he's not going to be gone forever. When that gets worked out, he will come back to be with you.",
        "Johnny: You'll come, too, right?",
        "Liberty: Hey, Johnny, look. Marsha's working today. Hey, Marsha.",
        "Marsha: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Do you think there might be a spare dish of ice cream over at the counter?",
        "Marsha: I bet I can find one with sprinkles.",
        "Liberty: Ooh, yeah! Go on.",
        "Marsha: Let me see that. I love that alligator.",
        "Liberty: And you thought it was a turtle. Look, I know what's going through your head right now.",
        "Gabriel: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Liberty: You feel bad for Johnny because he misses his father, and Craig's in jail because of what he did to you.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, can we please talk about something else?",
        "Liberty: Gabriel, Craig tried to kill you. He deserves to be locked up. And yeah, Johnny's hurting, and that totally stinks, but you can't feel guilty about it. All you did was tell the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: That's wrong.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Faith: This. It's Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys, not the Green Valley Boys.",
        "Parker: How do you know? You're not even taking the course?",
        "Faith: Go ahead. Look it up. You're welcome.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I'm sorry. Thank you. I ought to hire you as my tutor or something.",
        "Faith: I'll take the job. Now on to our next topic.",
        "Parker: The great depression?",
        "Faith: No, something a little more current -- letting Liberty go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Kenny, I don't want to bug you. I know you're a busy guy. But you should have seen Jack's face when he realized that he'd lost that watch. It was his grandfather's or his great grandfather's, whatever. I can't remember. But he was just devastated. He's so attached to it. I have to find it.",
        "Kenny: I'd love to help you, but rules are rules.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. I saw the -- sign on the door there. \"Authorized personnel only.\" But what do you say? Couldn't you, like, authorize me for 10 minutes? [Laughs] Just -- just maybe five? Oh! Monte Carlo. I mean, that's -- that's the case that -- that Jack was collecting evidence for. Could we just take a quick peek inside?",
        "Kenny: I never let you anywhere near this, okay?",
        "Carly: As a matter of fact, Kenny, I wasn't even here.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Carly: Phone's ringing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did you start the fire or not, Craig?",
        "Craig: I decline to answer on advice from counsel.",
        "Jack: Okay, see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. When I asked you about the arson charge, you -- you dance around the subject, refusing to give me a straight answer. But in the same breath, you absolutely deny that you attacked Gabriel and left him to die.",
        "Craig: That's right.",
        "Jack: With no hesitation, no waffling, no questioning whatsoever.",
        "Craig: I know what I did and didn't do. I leave it to you to read between the lines.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Craig: I know how hard this is for you, Jack. If you prove Gabriel's lying, that could put Parker in serious trouble. And for the record, that's the last thing that I want.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Me too. If I could only make Carly believe that.",
        "Craig: Not easy to be a dad.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Craig: That's all I want as far as Gabriel goes. I want to be a father to him and make up for all the missing years.",
        "Jack: Well, good luck with that. I'll let you know if there's any change.",
        "Craig: Jack -- to tell you the truth, before you came in here, I didn't have any hope. You gave me some. Thank you. I'd like to give you something in return.",
        "Jack: What could you possibly give me, Craig?",
        "Craig: A warning about Carly.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] Okay, I'm not interested in any of your warnings or any of your favors, especially where Carly is concerned.",
        "Craig: The funny thing about a jail cell, it gives you something you usually don't get otherwise -- time to think. And I've thought a lot about why I wound up in here.",
        "Jack: Well, that's an easy one. You broke the law.",
        "Craig: I mean what set the wheels in motion, why I made the choices I make.",
        "Jack: Yeah. My money -- my money is on greed, ambition, delusion.",
        "Craig: There's a much simpler explanation than that.",
        "Jack: Which is what?",
        "Craig: I fell in love with the wrong woman -- Carly.",
        "Jack: I think I've heard just about enough.",
        "Craig: No, I've really thought about this a lot, Jack.",
        "[Jack groans]",
        "Craig: You know, I still remember the first time I laid eyes on her. It was like something burst in my head. I went numb and hot at the same time.",
        "Jack: Uh-huh.",
        "Craig: And from that moment on, she's not only been in my life, she became my life. Yes, I call that love. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I was really just obsessed with her.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? I think you spent too much time in here.",
        "Craig: It's true. Loving Carly has just messed with my head and left me bankrupt, emotionally, financially, and morally.",
        "Jack: Assuming you ever had any morals.",
        "Craig: The day comes that I get out of here, Carly Tenney will not be my drug of choice. And that's exactly what she is, Jack. She gets under your skin, she alters your reality, and you get hooked. There's no other way to put it. She's toxic. And you start doing crazy things -- things that go against your nature.",
        "Jack: Okay, that's enough. Craig, I'm not going to stand here and listen to you blame Carly for everything you've ever dished out in your life. The only person who's responsible for the mess you're in right now, who landed you in this cell, is you.",
        "Craig: I defended her, too, Jack. I rationalized away the insanity for years. She counts on that. But in the end, she'll push you over the line, too, and you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, shoot. I really thought Jack's watch would be in there, and it's not. But thank you anyway. And I'll be sure to put in a good word for you with Jack. And you really are looking good, Kenny. I'll see you.",
        "Kenny: Wait. Hold it. There's something missing.",

        "Liberty: Gabriel -- Marsha, could you watch Johnny for just a second?",
        "Marsha: Oh, yeah. No problem.",
        "Liberty: Why did you walk out like that?",
        "Gabriel: I'm doing that kid a favor.",
        "Liberty: Johnny?",
        "Gabriel: Thanks to me, he's going to know exactly what kind of man his father is, all right? I'm saving that kid all that grief.",
        "Liberty: Look, I can't pretend Craig Montgomery isn't exactly what you thought he was growing up.",
        "Gabriel: A liar, a scammer, an all-around criminal?",
        "Liberty: But there's so much more to him than that.",
        "Gabriel: No. No, there isn't.",
        "Liberty: There is. He's such a great father to Johnny. He loves that little boy so much. Okay, despite everything, Craig isn't the total creep that you think he is.",
        "Gabriel: I wish I'd never come to this stupid town.",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Gabriel: Because I don't fit in here, okay? Living at Lily's house is a joke. I -- I have no idea how to be a brother, and I'm not being Craig Montgomery's son. No freaking way.",
        "Liberty: There's nothing you like about Oakdale? Whoa. What are you doing?",
        "Gabriel: What do you mean?",
        "Liberty: No. Gabriel, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea, but, like, I can't, okay? Right now I just --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Look, I am completely over Liberty, okay? I don't even think about her anymore.",
        "Faith: Uh-huh.",
        "Parker: No, seriously, okay? The only things on my mind right now are acing my finals and getting a good summer job. So don't even mention the word.",
        "Faith: Liberty? Okay. I won't ever mention the \"L\" word again. Uh, do you want me to quiz you on anything?",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm actually a little shaky on the American Revolution.",
        "Faith: Here we go. Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and John Hancock were part of a secret society of colonial patriots known as?",
        "Parker: Oh, the Sons of Liberty.",
        "[Faith chuckles]",
        "Parker: You're evil.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You want something to drink, something to take off the edge? Come here. I think the questioning went really well.",
        "Molly: Yeah, I think we gave them a really good story. Do you think they're going to need anything more than our statements?",
        "Holden: I think they're definitely going to want to talk to us again. You'll be fine.",
        "Molly: Where -- where did you get those?",
        "Holden: I found this --",
        "Molly: Holden, nobody can see those! If the police see those, they're going to know I didn't shoot him in self-defense.",
        "Holden: Don't worry about it.",
        "Molly: You got to burn them, get rid of them!",
        "Holden: Molly, I will. I'll take care of it.",
        "Molly: Please don't watch those.",
        "Holden: I won't. Why didn't you come to me? Why didn't you tell me you were going to meet Silas?",
        "Molly: Like I said, I really thought that I could handle it myself.",
        "Holden: Molly, he was threatening to go public with these things. He was threatening you, me, my family. The stakes don't get any higher than that, and still you felt like you couldn't come to me for help.",
        "Molly: 'Cause I thought if I told you I was going to see Silas that you'd think that I was just using him again to try to make you jealous.",
        "Holden: Come on. You're not serious, are you?",
        "Molly: No, I was afraid that you'd think it was a ploy to get you away from Lily and that dinner party.",
        "Holden: You honestly believe that I wouldn't take your word for it that you were in over your head with this guy?",
        "Molly: I didn't want to take the chance. I'm sorry. [Voice breaking] I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Wait. Liberty --",
        "Liberty: You're busy.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no, no. I'm not, I'm not. Faith just finished quizzing me on some history.",
        "Faith: I got to go. Good luck on your homework.",
        "Parker: Thank you. Hey, are you okay? You -- you look a little freaked out. Did Gabriel do something to you?",
        "Liberty: It's not about Gabriel. I take that back. It is about Gabriel, and it's about you -- you and Gabriel.",
        "Parker: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Liberty: Remember that amazing tug-of-war video we watched on ustube when I was in the hospital?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Well, I feel like the rope, the way you guys are fighting over me.",
        "Parker: Well, if he would just quit it --",
        "Liberty: I don't care whose fault it is, okay? I just want it to stop. Look, a couple of months ago, I didn't know whether I was going to live or die. But I made it, you know? My treatments are done. My hair is growing back. I finally get to be me again.",
        "Parker: I know, and it's great.",
        "Liberty: Except I have a lot of catching up to do if -- if I'm going to graduate with my class --",
        "Parker: But you will. I'm sure you will.",
        "Liberty: Then I need to buckle down and study for my exams. I owe it to my mom and even to my dad for everything they've done for me. So I really need to focus on that right now, and I don't want to have to worry about getting caught between you and Gabriel, okay? You understand?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.",
        "Liberty: Good. 'Cause I'll be honest. I don't like fighting with you, Parker. I kind of miss just being your friend.",
        "Parker: Yeah. No, I missed it, too.",
        "Liberty: Good. You should.",

        "Carly: I'm sorry. It -- it's not what you think. I mean, yeah, I -- I took it, and I know its evidence, and I know it was wrong, but it -- it means so much to me. This angel sat on my desk for years. It's been through a million ups and downs with me, and it's just -- it's a miracle that it survived that fire.",
        "Kenny: But it -- its still evidence.",
        "Jack: Yes, it is. I got this. What the hell are you doing here, Carly?",
        "Carly: Uh, trying to help.",
        "Jack: Help?",

        "Holden: This is all my fault.",
        "Molly: How can you say that? Holden, you didn't shoot him. I did.",
        "Holden: The only reason you were alone with Silas was because you didn't feel like you could come to me for help.",
        "Molly: I let myself get involved with him again, even though you warned me not to.",
        "Holden: I judged you, and that's not helping. I was spending all that time over at Lily's.",
        "Molly: Don't blame yourself, Holden, please. That's the last thing that I want.",
        "Holden: The whole time -- Molly, you were fighting off Silas, trying to protect my family, and I wasn't there for you. No wonder you doubted me.",
        "Molly: It's okay.",
        "Holden: No, it's not. I won't let it happen again.",
