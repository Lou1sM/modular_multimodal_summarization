        "Carly: Did you get Ethan settled in upstairs?",
        "Lily: Yes, Sage is reading him a story. Too cute. I can't believe that today is the last day of school.",
        "Carly: Yeah, the joys of summer -- all our kids all the time.",
        "Lily: And no husbands in residence. But at least we'll eat well. Why don't you fire up the grill, and I'll get going on the potato salad?",
        "Carly: Uh, I don't do the grill. I thought you did.",
        "Lily: Me? Are you kidding? No, Holden always does the grill.",
        "Carly: Well, what are we to do? We promised them a barbecue.",
        "Lily: Holden's getting back from his trip today. Maybe he'll come over and help us.",
        "Carly: No, you know -- listen. We are two capable, intelligent women. We can handle this. What, we just need a little charcoal and some of that lighter- fluid stuff. What could go wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Luke!",
        "Luke: Oh!",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling. Tell me that you have not been standing here all night.",
        "Luke: I kept hoping that Noah would show up.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you got to call your parents right now. Tell them where you are.",
        "Luke: No, no. We need to find Noah!",
        "Lucinda: Very well, Luke. I have brought help and some bad news, I'm afraid. My friend in the state department -- Ben Coyle. Ben Coyle, this is my grandson.",
        "Luke: Coyle? No.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Luke: No, no. I met Coyle a couple days ago. I introduced him to Noah.",
        "Real Coyle: I am Ben Coyle. Yesterday, a man claiming to be me took Ameera Ali Aziz out of NYPD custody. Now she's missing.",
        "Luke: That's the same guy that left with Noah.",
        "Real Coyle: When did you last see this man?",
        "Luke: Yesterday afternoon. Oh, my God.",
        "Lucinda: Is that when somebody knocked you unconscious?",
        "Luke: We have to find them.",
        "Lucinda: This has all been engineered by Noah's father. I'm sure of it. He's an escaped convict. He wanted to use Ameera and Noah as hostages.",
        "Real Coyle: Ms. Aziz would be a useful bargaining chip. What about the boy? Was he close with his father?",
        "Luke: No. No, his father hates him -- because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: No. You've kept me here all night. Now, you're just stalling for time.",
        "Captain: It's not my fault! We lost our contact at port security.",
        "Colonel Mayer: And you're telling me this now?",
        "Captain: We can't leave the harbor without identifying all passengers.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You better find a way.",
        "Captain: I've located a different boat, fake ids.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Get it here -- now! What's the matter, Ameera? What did you see?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Thanks for helping us with this, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you got me curious. You want to sue Memorial Hospital?",
        "Aaron: It's everything I talked to you about on the phone.",
        "Bonnie: Why don't you let Alison explain, since it's gonna be her case?",
        "Alison: Uh, okay. Uh, well, I was kicked out of the nursing-school program.",
        "Bonnie: And you think Chris Hughes engineered that?",
        "Alison: Uh, well, I can't prove it. Not really. I mean, of course, I didn't want to believe that Chris would ever do something like that.",
        "Bonnie: Well, Alison, if you don't have proof, you don't really have a case.",
        "Aaron: Tell her the rest. Tell her the rest, Ali.",
        "Alison: You know what? Why should I? She's obviously already made up her mind. You know, Chris is the perfect doctor, and I'm just no good.",
        "Aaron: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: And then -- then Alison started making wild accusations, saying that -- that she was taken off patient care because she wouldn't sleep with me.",
        "Tom: Well, that's a pretty serious accusation -- especially if it's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Why does the fire keep going out?",
        "Carly: Um, maybe it needs more of that starter stuff, huh?",
        "Lily: Wasn't that full a minute ago?",
        "Carly: Maybe the -- the charcoal's soggy or old or something.",
        "Lily: I think you better call Jack.",
        "Carly: No, I tried. He's out on assignment. I couldn't reach him.",
        "Lily: All right. I'm calling Holden.",
        "Carly: No, Lily. We can do this! Maybe we just need to light it in more than one place.",
        "Lily: Hey! It's me. How was your trip?",
        "Holden: It was good. Are you picking up the girls?",
        "Lily: Actually, I was hoping that you could pick them up and bring them over to Carly's for me.",
        "Holden: You know, I have some things that I need to catch up on, especially after being away and all.",
        "Lily: Well, we were really hoping that you could come over and help us with the grill. We're having a little grill emergency here. Please?",
        "Holden: Sure. I'll get the girls and I'll be right over.",
        "Natalie: Daddy's home!",
        "Lily: So I see.",
        "Holden: Sweetie, I'm just here to get the grill started. But I'll see you guys tomorrow for sure.",
        "Faith: You're not staying for the cookout? Why not?",
        "Lily: Got to eat. And after you get the grill started, we might even let you stay to cook.",
        "Faith: Please, Dad?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, Sage is really looking forward to seeing you girls. She's upstairs with Ethan.",
        "Faith: Please stay, Dad.",
        "Lily: It's all right. If you don't want to stay, you can -- you can just say so.",
        "Carly: Uh, I think I should go and turn down the heat on those, um, beans. You know they'll -- they'll burn.",
        "Lily: We sure know how to clear a porch.",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: It's all right, Holden. Don't feel obligated to stay. If you'll just get the grill started.",
        "Holden: What did you guys do to this thing? It looks like I'm gonna have to dump it and start all over again.",
        "Lily: So you'll stay for dinner?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "Lily: So, where did we go wrong? With the grill. Carly and me.",
        "Holden: Oh, um -- well, you didn't pyramid the charcoal. Well, you didn't let the lighter fluid seep into the coals.",
        "Lily: So that's all it takes -- a little time for the starter to soak through?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Time heals a lot of things.",
        "Lily: How was your trip?",
        "Holden: It was good. It was good. I bought some horses -- thought a lot about us.",
        "Lily: Reach any conclusions?",
        "Holden: I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Darling, you need -- you need sleep and rest. There's nothing more we can do here.",
        "Luke: I can wait for Noah.",
        "Lucinda: But we don't know. We don't know. What good will that do -- where -- where Noah is? All we know is that the Colonel has fled with Ameera. He's probably miles out to sea by now and Noah is either with them or --",
        "Luke: Okay, no, no, no, no, no. Don't even say it!",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: Look, I know that something bad could have happened to Noah, but it didn't.",
        "Lucinda: Luke.",
        "Luke: Look, Grandma. I am staying here until I find Noah. I am not leaving without him.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Okay.",
        "Real Coyle: All right. I've contacted port authority.",
        "Lucinda: Have they located Mayer's boat?",
        "Real Coyle: Well, according to the records, it never left the harbor.",
        "Luke: Wait. So they're still here?",
        "Lucinda: Well, you can track the boat and arrest them!",
        "Real Coyle: That's the plan. Let's hope it works.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: You saw something before, Ameera. What did you see?",
        "Ameera: I was just looking out at the horizon. That's supposed to help with seasickness.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Do what you can for now. Maybe when the captain gets back, he'll have something to help. Because we're gonna be at sea for quite a while.",
        "Ameera: You can't take me to Iraq! I won't go back there!",
        "Colonel Mayer: You have nothing to be afraid of as long as you cooperate.",
        "Ameera: Someone will help me. Someone will stop you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, you sound very confident, Ameera. Damn it. What have you done?",
        "Noah: Let her go, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Um, after we eat, will you push me on the swing?",
        "Holden: You bet.",
        "Natalie: Yes!",
        "Holden: Maybe we should talk about this later?",
        "Lily: Holden, if you don't want to be with me, I would rather know now.",
        "Holden: Lily, I want what I've always wanted -- for us to be a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hey, you can't run away from this.",
        "Alison: I'm just cutting my losses, Aaron. Put me up against Dr. Chris Hughes? Who's ever gonna believe me?",
        "Aaron: You're looking at him.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, we've got history, and you're a good guy.",
        "Aaron: Get real, Alison. Okay, I'm not perfect. I've got a lot to be ashamed of. And you know what? So do you. But in some ways, you're a lot better than me. I mean, look, you kicked meth. I mean, that takes all kinds of strength. And you've been honest about everything you've done. You're not hiding anything.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I think once people have watched you have sex on video, what's left to hide?",
        "Aaron: Hey, listen. When you were wrong, okay, you admitted it. You paid for your mistakes. What Chris Hughes did was just wrong. Don't let him get away with this.",
        "Alison: Where are you going?",
        "Aaron: Listen. This is your fight, okay?",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, let's start again. I need you to tell me everything.",
        "Alison: Um, I had this dream of becoming a nurse. And then Chris got mad at me, so he took that dream away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, how involved were you with Alison when she was in the nursing program?",
        "Chris: We were seeing each other for a while -- kind of dating, mostly not. She kept running hot and cold. Finally I just got tired of it, so -- so I ended things.",
        "Tom: Did the breakup coincide with her being released from the program?",
        "Chris: Yeah, it might have happened around the same time, but one thing had nothing to do with the other.",
        "Tom: Oh, really? And you're sure of this because?",
        "Chris: Well, because it's -- it's all about the numbers, Tom. Alison flunked out. That had nothing to do with me.",
        "Tom: But you were helping her study?",
        "Chris: Yeah, so I'm a lousy tutor. Sue me.",
        "Tom: She very well may. What other kind of help were you offering at the time?",
        "Chris: Okay, uh, maybe I shouldn't have done this. But I did speak to Brenda Manning a couple times.",
        "Tom: Brenda Manning?",
        "Chris: Yeah, she's in charge of the nursing program. I guess you could say I kind of got her to give Alison a makeup exam.",
        "Tom: You pressured one of Alison's teachers?",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no. It wasn't like that. I was just trying to be supportive of Alison. But in the end, you know, I told Brenda to use her own judgment, and cutting her from the nursing program was her decision, not mine.",
        "Tom: And will Brenda attest to this?",
        "Chris: Yeah, sure she will. You know, I had nothing to do with Alison getting kicked out. I would never intentionally hurt her. And if she says I did, she's lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: At first, Chris was great. He would quiz me on stuff, and -- and he was kind of like a -- kind of like my cheerleader. And he said I could learn it all, and then I'd be a great nurse.",
        "Bonnie: So, he was good to you?",
        "Alison: He saved my butt.",
        "Bonnie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: There was one time that I overslept, and I missed an exam, and he talked to the head of the department and got me to have a makeup test.",
        "Bonnie: Wow, that's above and beyond, isn't it?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was. And it's probably why I started thinking about maybe hooking up with him again.",
        "Bonnie: So, when did that change?",
        "Alison: Well, I passed my exam -- barely, but I passed, and, um, Chris took me out to celebrate, and we ended up going back to his room because he hurt his arm --",
        "Bonnie: And you slept together.",
        "Alison: We almost did, but I couldn't. I mean, I thought it's what I wanted, but when it came down to it -- I don't know. Anyway, when I bailed on Chris, he got really angry, and he said some things. And then I went to Aaron's, and I spent the night there. Nothing happened there, but Chris thought it did. And then, bam, I'm kicked out of nursing school.",
        "Bonnie: After you had passed your exam?",
        "Alison: I still didn't think Chris had anything to do with it. But then I got taken off of patient care. And when I went to my boss to ask her what happened, she said she had gotten a complaint about my work from Chris.",
        "Bonnie: Alison, what do you want?",
        "Alison: I want to be a nurse. And if pushing this is the only way that that's gonna happen --",
        "Bonnie: No, I think you have a really good case. I do. But if being a nurse at Memorial Hospital is what you really want, winning this case could be the worst thing that could ever happen to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So, what happens next?",
        "Holden: I think that we should, you know, keep things the way they are for a little while longer.",
        "Lily: You don't want to move back in with me?",
        "Holden: No, I do, but -- I think we just have some things that we need to work through.",
        "Lily: But we are going in the same direction. We want the same things.",
        "Holden: Yes. And I've even got the fire going.",
        "Lily: Yes. I'll go tell Carly. You were right about everything!",
        "Carly: I can honestly say I have never heard those words before.",
        "Lily: You told me to back off and give Holden space. And now he thinks that if we keep working at it, we have a chance at being a family again. So thank you.",
        "Carly: Yeah. It's about time I got something right.",
        "Lily: Maybe someday you and Jack can --",
        "Carly: Let's just get these kids fed, okay?",
        "[Children shouting]",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Carly: Now that sounds like a pillow fight. I'll quiet them down.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. I'll go. It's mostly my kids.",
        "[Shouting continues]",
        "Lily: Girls!",
        "Carly: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I still don't see why you had to call Dad.",
        "Tom: Dad is the chief of staff at Memorial. He has a vested interest in this case.",
        "Chris: There is no case.",
        "Tom: But there very well may be. Otherwise, we wouldn't be talking about this right now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Tom: Hey, Dad. How you feeling?",
        "Bob: Oh, not great. I was under the impression that this thing with Alison was gonna blow over.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I just wanted to bounce some things off Tom, head off any problems before they start.",
        "Bob: What do you think?",
        "Tom: Mistakes were made. Chris should not have pulled rank and had Alison removed from patient care.",
        "Chris: If Alison flunked out of nursing school, she shouldn't be tending to patients.",
        "Tom: But wasn't Alison working as a nurse's aide before she entered the nursing program?",
        "Chris: Yeah. What difference does it make?",
        "Tom: Well, did part of her duties include patient care?",
        "Chris: Yeah, sure, Tom. But she flunked out --",
        "Tom: Well, were there other complaints -- I mean, from doctors about her performance in this area?",
        "Bob: Actually, no. She gets high praise in her work with patients from just about everybody, including me.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Tom: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Chris: Well, I had a problem with Alison's job performance, Dad. What was I supposed to do -- just let it slide?",
        "Bob: You should have let me handle any official reprimand or any change in her duties. You just gave her ammunition that she can use against you.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I hear you, Dad, but I really don't think this is a big deal.",
        "Tom: Well, that was Bonnie McKechnie -- wanted to give me a heads up. She's representing Alison Stewart, who is suing Chris Hughes and Memorial for sexual harassment.",
        "Chris: This is crazy. How does Alison think she can sue me for sexual harassment and win?",
        "Tom: Well, she's feeling slighted and striking back, but if it's any consolation to you, most of these cases never make it to court.",
        "Chris: Yeah, because those companies usually settle out of court. We shouldn't have to do that. I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Bob: That may be true, but interfering with her assignments, that just sends out the wrong message.",
        "Chris: Dad, you warned me about getting involved with Alison. I should have listened to you. What happens now?",
        "Bob: Well, I'll try to do some damage control before this really gets out of hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Lisa? Got a minute?",
        "Lisa: Yes. For you, I have many minutes.",
        "Bob: I need a favor.",
        "Lisa: Oh, my goodness. Another fund-raiser. Is that coming up for the hospital? How much this time?",
        "Bob: No, no, I -- actually, I was hoping that, uh -- that you could have a chat with Bonnie about a very sensitive situation.",
        "Lisa: It's a legal matter?",
        "Bob: It's about Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I hate that every time I mess up at work, it bounces back on Dad. It seems like ever since I've been back in town, all I do is cause problems.",
        "Tom: Oh, don't worry so much. Dad has a way of smoothing things over. Besides, if what you say is true, and you've done nothing wrong, Alison has no case.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but she can make a lot of noise.",
        "Tom: Might be worrisome under certain circumstances, but her word is not very reliable. Her reputation precedes her.",
        "Chris: No, Tom. I don't want to use Alison's past against her.",
        "Tom: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So Bonnie thinks you have a good case here.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but a lot of people at the hospital like Chris, and once they find out I'm suing him and the hospital --",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey, listen. It's bad enough he has the clout to get you kicked out of school, okay? And then he goes and tries to stop you from working with patients? I mean, come on. You have every right to sue this guy.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but in the meantime, I have to work with him. Chris probably hates me right now.",
        "Aaron: Well, listen. If he's smart, he'll stay away from you. And if he doesn't, you let me know.",
        "Alison: Aaron, don't go after him. Promise me.",
        "Aaron: I won't let that guy hurt you anymore. That I promise. I'll talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: It's okay. I'm here.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, Son, I have to say I am impressed that you managed to get on this boat.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm more interested in getting off of it. And I'm taking Ameera with me.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, you can go. She can't.",
        "Noah: Why are you doing this? You've spent most of Ameera's life taking care of her and her family, and now you turn around and trade her freedom for yours? How can you do that?",
        "Colonel Mayer: It wasn't an easy decision, but, uh, there's a political group in Iraq that is very anxious for Ameera's return.",
        "Ameera: Those people want me dead.",
        "Noah: I thought she was like a daughter to you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You don't know this girl as well as you think you do, Noah. Does he, Ameera?",
        "Noah: I won't let you use her, Dad. You'll have to kill me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Well, what did Coyle say?",
        "Lucinda: They have the order to use deadly force to apprehend Noah's father.",
        "Luke: Well, what about Noah?",
        "Lucinda: We don't know that Noah's even on that boat.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm gonna find out.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Darling. You think that the police are gonna let you on the boat? They won't. It's too dangerous.",
        "Luke: Well, lucky for me, I'm not asking their permission, Lucinda, or yours.",
        "Lucinda: Hey! Hey!",
        "Real Coyle: What the hell are you doing? Get out of the boat.",
        "Luke: We're going with you.",
        "Real Coyle: Arrest them.",
        "Luke: You do that, and I swear I will be on the phone with every newspaper in this city. I'm sure they'd be thrilled to hear how you let an attempted murderer escape because you were too busy arresting a gay college kid and his poor, defenseless grandmother.",
        "Real Coyle: Talk sense into him.",
        "Lucinda: Do we have that kind of time?",
        "Real Coyle: Let's move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Colonel Mayer: Proving what, Noah?",
        "Noah: There's another way. There always is. You don't have to use Ameera to get out of here. You don't have to go back to Iraq. You don't have to hurt anybody. Why can't you just turn yourself in?",
        "Colonel Mayer: And go back to prison?",
        "Noah: What happened to the man who raised me? That guy who taught me about right and wrong? About protecting other people even if it meant making the ultimate sacrifice?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You dare to preach to me about integrity?",
        "Noah: I'm just reminding you of what you taught me. I won't let you sacrifice Ameera. I won't do it.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You'd fight me?",
        "Noah: I'd rather respect you. Why can't you just do the right thing?",
        "Colonel Mayer: I still love you, Son. Despite ev -- you're much braver and stronger than I ever gave you credit for.",
        "Noah: Then do this for me. Even if you can't go back to jail, at least let Ameera go. Let me take care of her and keep her safe and protect her the way you once did.",

        "Holden: Mmm. At least they won't taste like lighter fluid. You used a whole can, didn't you?",
        "Carly: Shut up and grill.",
        "Holden: Hey, there's my boy!",
        "Lily: I don't think he's feeling so high. He looks warm and flushed.",

        "Lily: Well, I took it. It's just a little bit above normal, but --",
        "Holden: I'll take him home.",

        "Bonnie: Wow, news travels fast. Lisa, you know I cannot speak to you about a client's case.",
        "Lisa: Well, of course. I'm not talking about the legal side at all. I want to talk to you about the human side. Honey, if this case goes to trial, just imagine what it would do. It would devastate the Hughes family and the Stewart family, and you do know the history between Chris and -- well, Emily and Alison. No one should want to have their dirty laundry just aired again, blowing in the breeze like --",
        "Bonnie: Including Alison. All she wants is justice done, and so do I, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: What I hope will happen is that everyone will work this out before it just goes too far. Honey, the hospital shouldn't have to -- they have to conserve their resources so they can use it to help people. And Chris -- think about him. Think about his -- he has a wonderful career ahead of him, a great future, and he has so much to offer.",
        "Bonnie: Well, Chris Hughes should have thought about that before he tried to ruin Alison Stewart's future and career because she wouldn't sleep with him.",

        "Alison: Why?",
        "Chris: Well, in the first place, I didn't get you kicked out of the nursing program. That wasn't my decision. And that will be the first thing that comes out in court.",
        "Alison: If you say so.",
        "Chris: And think about what else will come out.",
        "Alison: You'd do that to me? Intentionally embarrass me?",
        "Chris: No. No, but no matter what I say or what I want, our lawyers are not gonna play fair. You know that, Alison. Everything in your past is fair game. Your whole life is just gonna get dragged through the mud. Just think about that.",

        "Bonnie: Well, everything Chris said was true. If they're gonna pull out dirty laundry, so are we. It's all about damaging credibility here.",
        "Aaron: I thought it was about the truth.",
        "Bonnie: Hardly ever.",
        "Alison: Look, I can face the bad stuff, but I can't go through all this and then have it be for nothing. Bonnie, I need to know. Do we actually have a strong case?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, absolutely. In fact, I think our case just got stronger.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Bonnie: Well, what Chris did in there was completely inappropriate. He literally blocked your way, making it impossible for you to do your job. And add to that the verifiable facts that he interfered with your work assignments, turned on you when you wouldn't sleep with him, and he got you kicked out of your nursing program due to his influence. Alison, if you have the stomach for this, this is a case we can win.",

        "Noah: I was getting through to him, Luke. I had convinced him to let Ameera go and maybe even turn himself in, and you just show up with the cops?!",
