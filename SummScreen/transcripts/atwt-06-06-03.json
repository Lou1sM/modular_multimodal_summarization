        "Katie is working at the Nurses' Station since the hospital was short-staffed. Mike asks Katie if she wants him to wait so he can bring her home. She says yes, and while he's waiting, Mike gets a phone call from Molly, who says she has news about Carly. Mike goes to meet Molly and tells Chris on his way out to tell Katie to meet him there in case he needs rescuing. Katie arrives just in time, but not before Molly tells Mike that Carly is in Muscle Shells and Jack is on his way there. Molly leaves at the sight of Katie. Mike invites Katie to go to Montana with him.",
        "Jack arrives in Montana and enters the cabin Carly was staying in. He calls out and looks around, but he only finds her wedding rings. Carly opens the door and is shocked to see Jack there. He informs her that he just received her letter the night before. The two talk for a while and end up patching things up.",
        "Rose is worried about her twin sister, Lily. When suddenly, a phone call comes in. Rose's phone is tapped by the police. The call is from the kidnapper who demands ten million dollars in unmarked bills if they ever want to see Lily again. When Mrs. Welsh hears the recorded tape, she announces she's going to the bank, even though Margo advises her not to. Molly shows and tells Margo about the scheme Dusty had and says she also believes he has something to do with the kidnapping. Margo goes to confront Dusty, but he already left.",
        "Roseanna believes Carly is expecting Craig to go meet her in Montana when Craig tells Roseanna Carly has been found. He also says he wants to remarry her today, in one hour. Roseanna agrees after some persuading from Aaron. They get married, sort of. Roseanna was impatient. She and Craig basically performed their own wedding.",
        "Chris wants to talk to Alison but she says she can't because she has a date. Alison has rooted through her sister's closet but her mother catches her with the clothes and says they are \"too mature\" for a girl her age. Her mother clearly does not want her dating Gordo. Alison however pleads her case by saying Rick is too young for her mother. Her mother agrees to let her go on the date but to wear something more appropriate for a girl her age. Alison shows up later at the hospital looking absolutely gorgeous. Chris is stunned by the sight of her. Gordo appears in a suit and tie and the two proceed with their date."

        "Katie: No, Dr. Hughes is in a meeting right now. Can I connect you to his voice-mail? Okay, great, thanks. Hi!",
        "Mike: Hey. They're making you work?",
        "Katie: No, I just said I'd pitch in and answer the phones while I'm waiting to be questioned. Gordo's in there right now. And with Nurse Krebs -- not alive anymore, we're a little short staffed, even more than usual.",
        "Mike: So they haven't questioned you yet?",
        "Katie: No. But it looks like I'm next. Oh, and you know what? They said that they're gonna give me the next few days off. So, if you don't have to leave right now, would you stay, please? I know I'm being a needy female. And after you stayed with me all night last night, I just shouldn't be asking to hang on you again. But if I see another dead body, I'm really gonna freak out.",

        "Craig: Hello.",
        "Rosanna: I have marvelous news.",
        "Craig: Carly's alive, and the charges against you have been dropped?",
        "Rosanna: How did you know?",
        "Craig: Well, while Jack has been digging up half the town, I've been looking for Carly, who's in Montana, in a little town called Musselshell, which I guess you're familiar with.",
        "Rosanna: And when did you find this out?",
        "Craig: Last night.",
        "Rosanna: Last night? Well, why didn't you come and get me? Where have you been? Why didn't you call me?",
        "Craig: I was working out the details.",
        "Rosanna: The details of what? Your flight plan? Well, what time is Carly expecting you?",
        "Craig: I am not going to Montana. I have not talked to Carly, and I have been up all night haggling with the D.A. so that you and I wouldn't have to waste our time with some pro forma hearing. All right? You are off the hook, thanks to me, so I'd appreciate at least a kiss hello, and a thank you nibble would be nice.",
        "Rosanna: Why didn't you come and get me at Emma's?",
        "Craig: I just got home from the courthouse an hour ago. I showered and shaved, and I've been out in the gazebo assessing the damage.",
        "Rosanna: The gazebo? I think I'm a little bit more important than a gazebo.",
        "Craig: Well, no, no, no. We can't very well get married again if the gazebo's all dug up, now.",

        "Dusty: They're gonna call. Just be patient.",
        "Rose: Is this thing you got hooked up to this phone state-of-the-art? Because I don't want Lily to get hurt because this guy knows that the phone is bugged.",
        "Margo: Rose, we're taken every precaution -- here and at Lily's and at Lucinda's.",
        "Rose: Oh, Lucinda. She must be going nuts. What about Holden? Is -- is his plane -- is it on --",
        "Dusty: His flight's been delayed. We've been over this. You got to relax.",
        "Rose: I just thought this was about money, but obviously the money is not that important to this guy, because he --",

        "Margo: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [Phone ringing] ready? On three -- one, two, three.",

        "Chris: With Gordo?",
        "Gordo: You got a minute, Alison? Alone?",
        "Alison: It's okay. Chris knows everything. I was trying to be mature and keep things private, but since he already knows -- and you guys are friends, right?",
        "Gordo: Absolutely. So tonight still works?",
        "Alison: Absolutely.",
        "Gordo: 7:00?",

        "Hal: I was just telling John I've talked to everybody who was on duty last night. I've interviewed all the patients on the floor. Now I'm gonna need to talk to the custodial staff.",
        "Bob: That's no problem.",
        "Hal: It seems this wasn't the first unusual death. I should have been notified earlier.",
        "Bob: Hal, this is a hospital. People are born and die here every day. I just thought it would have been irresponsible to call in the police before I had double-checked each one of these cases. That's why I called Dr. Daniels. He's a forensic pathologist. And he's just completed his preliminary examination. Dr. Daniels?",
        "Walker: Well, I still have some tests to perform, but my initial findings confirm my suspicion. Nurse Krebs did receive some kind of injection before her death.",
        "John: So are we to assume that Nurse Krebs did not die of natural causes?",
        "Walker: Well, I'm waiting on the toxicology reports. But absent any other cause, I'd have to say that Nurse Krebs was murdered.",

        "Craig: Wasn't that the plan when you'd forgiven me? That we'd get married again? Have you forgiven me? I've forgiven you.",
        "Rosanna: So you've been out in the garden, assessing the gazebo, instead of coming to get me, because you assumed I would marry you again? When -- today?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: And you've set this up?",
        "Craig: Well, Lucy's going to help. And Aaron, both of them. I assumed you'd want them both there.",
        "Rosanna: Lucy and Aaron are going to help?",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes, they're both going to be there, because they both know how much I love you and how much that you and I belong together.",
        "Rosanna: Mm-hmm. And you are assuming I would want to marry you again.",
        "Craig: You love me. I love you. And life without me would be a bore.",
        "Rosanna: I can't count on you, Craig.",
        "Craig: That's not true. Told you I'd get the charges against you dropped. I did. Promised you a wedding -- in an hour, and you'll have that. Deal?",
        "Rosanna: Maybe. If you can get the gazebo in shape.",
        "Craig: Dress formal.",
        "Craig: Sweetness, it's daddy. What's the name of the gardener, the big one? Raoul. Right. Listen, I need you home. Yeah, I need your help. Because I'm gonna marry Rosanna in an hour.",

        "Carly: Then why are you here?",
        "Jack: Why did you leave?",
        "Carly: I just needed some time to think about what my life is gonna look like now -- that everything's different.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so you decided to do that all alone in the middle of nowhere with a baby on the way? What about the pre-eclampsia, Carly?",
        "Carly: I've got a midwife who's -- who's looking out for me.",
        "Jack: Really? And where would she be?",
        "Carly: Oh, she -- she looks in on me, like, 80 times a day, Jack. I'm taking care of myself. And the baby. I even saw a doctor, and he said that everything is just fine, so -- so unless there's some other reason that you're here --",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why did you take off like that?",
        "Carly: Oh, gee, I don't know, Jack. I was accused of -- of fraud. My career is over. I'm living with my ex-husband. My own sister tells me that everything I touch, I ruin. I guess I wasn't feeling very welcome anymore.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we all thought you were dead. Do you know that?",
        "Carly: What? No, I left a note.",
        "Jack: With Parker. We didn't find it until last night.",
        "Carly: Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know that, Jack. I wouldn't want to worry anybody.",
        "Jack: You said in the note that Hal and Emily were supposed to give me a message -- that you still love me. Then you don't take my calls. You don't answer my messages.",
        "Carly: No, I wasn't even checking --",
        "Jack: All right, so what is it, Carly? Do you love me or not?",
        "Carly: Does it really matter to you?",
        "Jack: No, I -- no. It -- it doesn't. I came all the way to Montana for the big sky.",
        "Carly: Well, nobody asked you to put yourself out.",
        "Jack: What the hell do you want from me?!",
        "Carly: Nothing. Nothing, if this is how you're gonna be. You may as well just go back home to Oakdale, Jack, if all you want is to be right.",
        "Jack: And what about these? Should I take these with me?",
        "Carly: Damn it, Jack.",
        "Jack: You're the one who took 'em off, not me.",
        "Carly: No, because my fingers are swollen, Jack. It happens when you're pregnant. I finally took them off. And of course I left them behind. That's why I came back. I was 50 miles down the road. I noticed my hand on the steering wheel, and it was empty, so I came back for my rings.",
        "Jack: So you still love me?",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course I still love you, Jack. But what does that matter if all we do anymore is fight? That's why I came here. So I could remember a time when everything was easy. When we fell in love -- we sat on the porch for an hour at a time, Jack, holding hands, watching the sun rise and fill the valley with light. And that's how I wanted to feel when this baby came -- filled with light, with you beside me, holding my hand. But all you want to be is mad. So you may as well go back home, Jack. Hey, I'll drop you a line when she's born.",

        "Margo: Let her in.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. Rose, what -- oh, what the hell is he doing here?",
        "Rose: He was here when the phone call came in, so I want him to be here.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, stay. All right, that figures. Now could somebody please tell me what happened, coherently? Has anybody spoken with Lily since this -- directly? Is she alive and well? Do we know?",
        "Margo: Lucinda -- this is a pre-recorded message.",
        "Mechanical voice: If you want the lady back, it'll cost you $10 million. You've got 48 hours to gather the cash in unmarked bills. You'll receive a package with instructions and proof she's alive.",
        "Lucinda: Fine. Well, that's pretty straightforward, isn't it? I'll go talk to my banker.",
        "Margo: The FBI would advise against paying the ransom.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, isn't that too bad? But the FBI is not Lily's mother.",
        "Rose: Can I come with you, Ms. Walsh?",
        "Lucinda: No, dear. Why don't you just stay here and wait, in case there's another call?",
        "Dusty: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely not. Dear, call me on my cell if there's anything at all.",
        "Rose: What do we do now? What do we do? What do we do?",
        "Margo: I'm gonna go check in with the station. If there is another phone call, don't pick up. Come and get us.",
        "Rose: Is this -- is this the Spangler guy? He sent somebody to my shop. That didn't work out. Now they took Lily? We've gotta tell Margo this information.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no, no. That's the one thing we're not gonna do.",
        "Rose: You know what Spangler looks like. You have his phone number. We call it, and Margo could trace the phone call --",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no. If you do that and it goes bad, you're sister's gonna end up dead.",
        "Rose: Is this because of what I did with Spangler? Because I went after him like that? Is this payback to me, for what I did?",
        "Dusty: No. No, this is business. This is how Charley sees it.",
        "Rose: Hey, where're you going?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna go to talk to the guy.",
        "Rose: No, you're not gonna do that. He's -- no! Look, we gotta tell Margo right now.",
        "Dusty: Hey, you tell Margo, and she's gonna think that I'm in on it.",

        "Aaron: Look, Rosanna -- look, I want to be real, real honest with you, okay? I don't know how anybody can marry Craig. Okay? But then I'm not totally sure why anybody would marry you, either. No, listen, listen. All right, you're a piece of work. You are. And I like you a lot. You've been nothing but great to Lucy and me. Craig may be a lousy husband and a lousy human being. And he even hates me so much. Doesn't matter how much he hates me. He loves Lucy -- so much. He loves her so much that he's letting her make me his best man.",
        "Rosanna: You're kidding.",

        "Carly: This baby is probably Mike's. Which means that's what you'll be thinking when she's born, and that's not fair to her. When she comes into this world, she needs to feel wanted and loved, and you can't give her that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I guess I can understand why you'd -- why you'd think that, given where I was when you left. [Jack sighs] I've been through hell, Carly. Like I said -- you know, we -- we thought that you and the baby -- we found that body. I died 27 times in 27 minutes. I swear. And then when it wasn't you -- whew -- it was like God gave me a second chance. That's why I'm here. 'Cause in those 27 minutes, I realized -- it doesn't matter whose DNA she has. That baby is mine. And I am gonna love her and protect her, just like I do her mother. 'Cause right or wrong, Carly, sane or smart, I love you. That's just the way it is.",

        "Alison: We had this discussion, mom.",
        "Susan: Honey, honey, you are not allowed to date him, and that's the end of it. He is a -- a sexually active, adult male, with who knows what values. You're a 17-year-old girl. No!",

        "Alison: And do you think that a 17-year-old boy wouldn't try something, mom? Wake up. I've stumbled over more dead bodies in the past few weeks than most people see in their entire lives. I think I can handle one stupid little date. Didn't it make you feel so good when Rick asked you out?",
        "Susan: Oh, honey, that's different. Rick and I are --",
        "Alison: No, I'm not gonna move in with Gordo. I just -- I just want to get dressed up and go out with someone who thinks I look nice. Okay?",
