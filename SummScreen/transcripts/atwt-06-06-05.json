        "Everyone is on edge at the fact Craig is back in town, however, nobody more so then Jen and Mike, especially when he shows up unannounced at their door. Jen is extremely upset by Craig's threats to promising to always being a part of his child's life. Mike tries to calm her down, but further aggravates Jen when he admits that Craig does have rights as the child's father. However, he promises to always protect her and their baby. Katie talks to Craig and convinces him to allow her to be his go between with Mike and Jen. When Henry finds out that Katie has involved herself in the Craig, Jen and Mike saga again, he is reminded of Katie's undying love for Mike. Paul tells Emily and Hal that he wants to press charges against Rosanna. He recites the story Rosanna told him of why she had to leave, but since Craig was involved with Rosanna, Paul is unsure what to believe. Hal questions cause Paul to wonder why he wants to drag everyone through this, but decides this is the only way to find out the truth. After Paul leaves, Hal forbids Emily to press charges against Rosanna. The pail of fake blood intended for Celia mistakenly hits Casey. He gets rushed to the hospital unconscious. Gwen and Will follow, and arrive just as Casey, who has now regained consciousness, and Celia profess their love to one another. Gwen ends up getting sick, and later confesses to Will that she is pregnant with Casey's baby. Keith can tell Lily is worried about a drinking something Keith made for her. He knows that she has taken the bee pollen to a lab for analyzing. She claims she has done that solely to prove her mother and the others wrong. Keith shocks Lily by admitting the bee pollen will match the bee pollen in Les' car. He explains he was worried that Les would get out of the charges against him, as he had done so many times in the past. He knew all the evidence was circumstantial, and he was worried Les would get off and go after JJ. Lily wants to know why he didn't just tell her. He explains he didn't want her seen as an accessory. He reminds her he never lied about how much he loves her, and leaves her to make a decision as to what she wants to do with this information. After Keith leaves, Lily calls Jessica to meet her to talk. Someone follows Lily as she leaves her home. In her car, she decides to cancel her appointment, and as she hangs up, she realizes her brakes are no longer working."

        "Craig: Surprised? You look well. Jennifer, you're even starting to show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Craig checked into the Lakeview, but they haven't seen him for hours.",
        "Margo: Well, maybe he's just driving around, blowing off steam, plotting another day.",
        "Katie: Have you ever seen him this mad before?",
        "Margo: No, never. Never when he felt so rightfully angry.",
        "Katie: Then you know where he'll go?",
        "Margo: Oh, no, no.",
        "Katie: What? Don't you think Mike and Jennifer deserve to be warned?",
        "Margo: Well, does it have to be you?",
        "Katie: You want to do it instead?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Katie: 'Cause you know what will happen if Craig sees you -- how happy will he be to see you again?",
        "Margo: All right, but Katie, you go in there, you warn them and you get out, right?",
        "Katie: Instead of what? Staying and moving in with Mike and Jen? I'm not that desperate.",
        "Margo: You seem really eager to jump in and help.",
        "Katie: I am. I would like to do one good thing this week. Maybe I can stop three people I care about from killing each other.",

        "Hal: Paul.",

        "Hal: Really? And you were going to tell me when?",
        "Paul: No, Hal, that was my idea. I didn't want Emily to say anything until I had a chance to think about it. And get my head straight.",

        "Lily: I just don't want to drink.",
        "Keith: You look like you could use one.",
        "Lily: I have a headache. I just took a pill. I really shouldn't have a drink.",
        "Keith: You going to be operating some heavy machinery later?",
        "Lily: You never know.",
        "Keith: Well, there's no reason why it should go to waste. Maybe the poison sunk maybe the poison sunk to the bottom. Let's just see.",
        "Lily: Oh, God, Keith --",
        "Keith: You know, maybe I've just drugged the wrong glass here, huh?",
        "Lily: Keith, don't. Please.",
        "Keith: Look, one of us should have fun, because it doesn't look like you're having any, as far as you and I together, it's too late for any fun there, huh?",
        "Lily: Don't be silly. I just don't want to drink.",
        "Keith: Right, you need to keep your wits about you.",
        "Lily: Yes, I do, because I have children in the house. I need to be alert.",
        "Keith: I know you took it, Lily.",
        "Lily: Took what?",
        "Keith: The bee pollen. And you sent it to the lab.",
        "Lily: How do you know that?",
        "Keith: Because I'm not the only one that notices when people are acting a little strange around here.",
        "Lily: I never thought you were acting strange.",

        "Keith: No. No, no, no, no. You don't believe that, because you're still waiting for the lab results.",
        "Lily: Not anymore.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, 'cause I cancelled the test. Yeah. That's right. The bee pollen that you found will match the bee pollen that was found in Sweeny's car. Because I planted it there. Now you know the truth.",

        "Josh: Come on, man, you got to know that movie. It's like a classic from the '70s or something. Freaky girl, with supernatural powers, gets set up by the girls in high school. They drop a bucket of pig's blood on her head.",
        "Zach: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Gwen: \"Carrie.\" The movie was \"Carrie.\" The girls who did it look a lot like your two dates.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah. Except they had a hard time getting away, in the movie.",
        "Zach: What happened to them?",

        "Will: The ambulance is out front. I didn't know what to tell them about the condition or anything.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: That's okay. Here they are.",
        "[Celia crying]",
        "EMT #1: What did this?",
        "Mr. Jacoby: It's not real blood. At least it's not this boy's. It was a prank.",
        "Will: I think the bucket was just supposed to fall and drop stuff on him. But it hit him in the head instead --",
        "EMT #2: And knocked him unconscious.",
        "Celia: I tried to wake him up, but he won't.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: All right, let's let them in here, dear, so they can help him. Come on. Come on.",
        "Gwen: He's still out?",
        "Celia: Who would do this? Everybody likes Casey.",
        "Gwen: Celia, think. That bucket was triggered to fall for when the prom queen stepped up on the platform. No way was that meant for Casey.",
        "Celia: This was meant for me?",
        "Gwen: It might be hard to prove. At least hard enough to get them suspended.",
        "EMT #2: I called it in. Memorial's ready.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute, the hospital? Is it that serious?",
        "Celia: Oh, my God. You guys can't get him to wake up either? Why is it taking so long? I want to go in the ambulance.",
        "EMT #1: Are the parents here?",
        "Mr. Jacoby: No, they're my next call.",

        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: Your best friend just got wheeled out on a stretcher. Don't you want to go to the hospital?",
        "Will: No, we should leave Celia and Casey -- you know, the guy said we'd be in the way.",
        "Gwen: Look, there's enough room at the hospital. Whatever, I'll get my own ride.",
        "Will: No, wait, fine, fine. We should be with them. Let's go.",

        "Emily: Let's go through this. I don't want you to make a move until you're sure.",
        "Paul: You were right.",
        "Emily: Was I? Because, I told you not to go see Rosanna. Obviously you didn't listen to me.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, you knew that I couldn't do that.",
        "Emily: What was her story? Why did she drug me?",
        "Paul: James Stenbeck made her do it.",
        "Emily: Oh, please!",
        "Hal: Whoa, time out. James Stenbeck is involved with Rosanna?",
        "Paul: James had Cabot, supposedly. Rosanna thinks that Cabot is still alive.",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Emily: How could that be?",
        "Paul: I don't know, but she swears that it's true. She says that James got Cabot out of the cabin before it exploded and that he was alive and well, and the price that Rosanna had to pay to get her kid back was to torture me.",
        "Hal: Oh, God help us, that sounds like James.",
        "Paul: Yes, it does.",
        "Emily: Did you see him? Did you see Cabot?",
        "Paul: No, I don't know where he is.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Paul: Because James double crossed Rosanna and moved Cabot -- now Rosanna doesn't even know where Cabot is.",
        "Emily: She comes back here with a story? That's it?",
        "Paul: Yes. I know!",
        "Emily: You don't believe it, do you?",
        "Paul: Well, who could make something like that up?",
        "Emily: Paul!",
        "Paul: Okay, never mind that -- never mind who, why would somebody make something like that up?",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. You believe it. Don't you?",
        "Paul: I did. Until Craig Montgomery walked into the room. Craig and Rosanna were together wherever they were -- and with Craig involved, this whole thing could be a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You.",
        "Craig: Yes, me. You didn't expect me, did you? You're pretty far along, the baby must be kicking by now.",
        "Jennifer: No.",
        "Mike: Hey, get away from her. How did he get in here?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know how -- I don't know why, when everyone said that he would never come here again.",
        "Craig: Yes. Well, I just want to see how the baby's doing. You must be pretty far along. I never did get the exact due date. I could count backwards or you could tell me.",
        "Mike: What do you want?",
        "Craig: I want to know how Jennifer is doing.",
        "Mike: That's none of your business.",
        "Craig: Jennifer's health affects my baby's health, which is very much my child's business.",
        "Mike: No, they'll both be great once you're gone.",
        "Craig: Yes, I was gone, wasn't I? You two have anything to say for yourselves?",
        "Jennifer: I can't. I can't do this. I can't.",
        "Mike: Look, he's going, he's not going to bother you.",
        "Craig: Now, I have tried to be nice, which is a lot more than you two deserve after the scams you have tried to run. But clearly, \"nice and reasonable\" doesn't work with you two. So if you think I'm going to be \"nice\" about my parental rights, forget it.",
        "Mike: Craig, we didn't have anything to do with you leaving town.",
        "Craig: Of course, not. You just sat on the porch, whittled a cradle while Jennifer told everyone she'd just be a basket case if she had to share the same zip code with me.",
        "Jennifer: I did no such thing.",
        "Craig: You even worked my own sister to turn on me.",
        "Jennifer: Which sister? What is he talking about?",
        "Mike: Look, we weren't part of it, but we were real glad you were gone.",
        "Craig: Because I was trying to be a father to my child.",
        "Jennifer: Craig, Mike and I are married. We are going to raise this child together.",
        "Craig: All together. You two can have each other, but I want my child.",
        "Jennifer: No, you can't take my baby away.",
        "Craig: Oh, yes, I can. And I will.",
        "Mike: Is that a threat?",
        "Craig: Yes, it is. I will go to court, because I am the father, and you cannot make that disappear.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry to bother you guys --",
        "Craig: Little sister. Were you part of my bon voyage party, too?",
        "Katie: Craig, I didn't even know you were gone until the whole thing was over.",
        "Craig: And you weren't even a little bit sorry?",
        "Katie: Craig, I'm your sister and I love you. That's why I'm here. I want to help you.",

        "Henry: Hi, just tell me she's all right.",
        "Margo: Katie?",
        "Henry: Yes, of course, Katie.",
        "Margo: Well, come on in, Henry. Katie's fine. I just saw her.",
        "Henry: Has Craig seen her? Margo, that's the point. What the hell is he doing back in town?! I come out of the elevator, he's buying a newspaper in the lobby. I thought he was gone permanently.",
        "Margo: Yeah, me, too. It's kind of a long story.",
        "Henry: Well, it is a story I've never heard in full, but I'm pretty certain that he did not leave town of his own volition.",
        "Margo: No, he didn't. Now, he's back, he's got a few scores to settle.",
        "Henry: Great! That's great. Which means, he's more determined than ever to go after Jennifer's baby. And Katie is smack-dab in the middle of it. I don't -- I don't like that, Margo.",
        "Margo: Well, Henry, I thought that you and Katie were over.",
        "Henry: We are, we are.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. Then why are you hyperventilating?",
        "Henry: I'm not -- I am not hyperventilating, Margo.",
        "Margo: Henry, if you were any more breathless, I would have to give you the kiss of life. You're still in love with Katie, aren't you?",
        "Henry: Just because a person is a little apprehensive about the well being of someone who they care about, does not mean --",
        "Margo: What, care about?",
        "Henry: I am just concerned --",
        "Margo: Don't give me that -- you still love her.",
        "Henry: -- That he might take out something on her that he didn't --",
        "Margo: You still love her. You still love her.",
        "Henry: Fine. Okay, fine. Fine. Officer, great, you win, I confess. I love her. Are you happy now?",
        "Margo: No, no, I'm not. 'Cause I was really kind of hoping that you guys would find a way to work it out.",
        "Henry: Well, we can't. And Katie and I understand that. And since I can't be around to take care of her anymore, I need your help okay? I need you to warn her about Craig.",
        "Margo: Oh, that's okay, she knows.",
        "Henry: Good, good. Okay, so she can lay low and keep out of the -- [Margo sighs] Hello, what?",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Henry: You what, what?",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Henry: I'm hyperventilating, you just stopped breathing. Come on, out with it, Margo.",
        "Margo: Um -- Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Okay. Excuse me. Katie went over to Mike and Jennifer's to warn them about Craig.",
        "Henry: Of course. She doesn't care about herself, she cares about Mike.",
        "Margo: No, no, I wouldn't put it that way.",
        "Henry: I would, I would. I don't know -- I don't know why I don't get it. She doesn't need me to be a watch dog when she is so hell-bent on making sure that all of Mike's interests are taken care of.",
        "Margo: Hey, hey! Henry, hey, wait, wait, wait. Okay, hear me, wait. Why don't you hang out here with me for a while, because Tom, he's off fighting bad guys and Casey's at the prom, so why don't just you and I hang out and we'll have some ice cream.",
        "Henry: Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, Henry. You don't understand, marshmallow, almond fudge.",
        "Henry: You don't seem to understand what I like about martinis. No marshmallows. Thank you, anyway, for the offer.",

        "Henry: Yeah, I'm fine.",

        "Celia: Please, Casey. Please wake up.",
        "Bob: Hi, there. I see our boy's not awake yet, huh?",
        "Celia: Dr. Hughes, I'm so scared.",
        "Bob: Don't you worry, we'll bring him around. This happened at the prom, huh? You know, you know, maybe he's just a lousy dancer and didn't want you to find out about it? Casey? I know he never liked to get dressed up, but red is his color, isn't it? [Celia laughs] Good, good. Casey? Casey Hughes?",
        "[Casey moans]",
        "Celia: Casey?",
        "Bob: Okay. Now, let's give him a little room. Casey, do you know where you are?",

        "Bob: Close enough. Do you know who I am?",
        "Casey: Grandpa.",
        "Bob: Dr. Grandpa to you. Do you know what day it is?",
        "Casey: The 6th?",
        "Bob: Hey, that's great. I don't know that I would have done that well. Good boy.",
        "Mr. Jacoby: Excuse me, I reached detective Hughes, she's on her way. I'll wait for her out front.",
        "Bob: Good.",
        "Casey: Mom's coming? Big trouble.",
        "Bob: What's this problem with trouble? You got a guilty conscience or something?",

        "Celia: Oh, it's nothing.",
        "Casey: Grandpa, she's hurt.",
        "Bob: No, no nobody's bleeding. This was somebody's idea of a practical joke. So listen, you just take it easy and I'm going to order some tests. If he tries to get out of here, you just holler.",
        "Celia: I will. Are you okay now?",
        "Casey: Yeah. As long as you're here.",
        "Celia: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Casey: I love you. Did you mean it about not going anywhere?",
        "Celia: Of course. I love you, too. I'll never leave you, Casey.",

        "Keith: Lily, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I won't touch you anymore. I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. Will you -- will you sit down? Please? Look, I planted the bee pollen in Sweeny's car, because I saw him starting to slip away, as he's always done before. Every time he beat my sister to a pulp, she would arrest him, he would go to jail and then he would get out. And I saw it happening again. The case against him was starting to melt away here. He hired Jessica. She's the best, right? She would have got a walk. No physical evidence -- they threw the phone out. He would have walked out of jail, he would have walked right -- right into J.J.'s life. And I'm not going to let that happen. I owed that to my sister. Sweeny needs to go away for life.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you just tell me?",
        "Keith: Tell you? Tell you that I planted bee pollen in the car? I would never ever put you in that position.",
        "Lily: I wouldn't have said anything.",
        "Keith: I know that. I know that you wouldn't have said anything. However, that would have made you an accessory and I would never do that to you. But now you are anyway. So, I am sorry. But if you want to turn me in, you have that right. It's your call.",

        "Paul: She wants me back. That's what she said.",

        "Paul: Because this whole thing was all about James. Which really makes sense, because my entire life, when you come down to it, has really only ever been about james. And this is exactly something that he would do. Leave me twisting in the wind. Make me think that I was responsible for a baby dying. And then take the kid and dangle it in front of Rosanna and tell Rosanna, \"the only way you get your kid back is to destroy Paul.\" It's vintage Stenbeck.",
        "Emily: So where does Craig fit in? I mean, obviously James did not bring him into the mix. That was Rosanna's doing.",

You know, it gives him a reason to fight with everybody. But what does it really mean to him? I mean, do we really think he's gonna do the hard stuff? Do we really think he did that any of his other kids?",

        "Mike: Then we'll deal with that, but for now, don't borrow trouble.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I just can't even stand the idea him visiting. It makes me want to just scream to think of him being around this baby!",
        "Mike: Yeah, you do. Literally. So, please, let me handle Craig.",
        "Jennifer: No. No. I can't -- hey, what happened to this \"we\" thing that you were so big on? It cuts both ways.",
        "Mike: Okay, we just have different jobs right now. Yours is to remain calm and take care of that baby. Which you cannot do if you're butting heads with Craig. So let me deal with him. I promise you, I will protect you and our baby.",
