        "It is graduation day at Oakdale High; Margo tells Casey she and Tom are allowing him to attend the University of Wisconsin in the fall again, but he declines wanting to stay at home and go to Oakdale U, which thrills Maddie when she overhears this. Will continues to avoid telling anyone the truth about not being allowed to graduate. When he misses the morning meeting with his principal, he is expelled. He still can't bring himself to tell Hal, Barbara or most importantly Gwen, who continues to heap praise upon him for graduating and doing so well the final couple weeks of school. Barbara presents him with his trust fund, and is extremely nice to Gwen. Hal's best friend from the police academy is shot and is in ICU, so Will coaxes Hal into going there since he wants less people around when he has to admit about not being able to graduate. Jade offers to help him out of this jam by suggesting blackmail, but Will decides to finally come clean. Jen is upset when she sees Lucy is observing Johnny's appointment. Lucy puts her two cents worth in when Jen has issues about Johnny's vaccinations, which really upsets Jen, who tells her that she shouldn't be involved in his case. Katie has a nightmare; Mike continues to keep her at a distance, as she tries to reach out to him. Mike wants to make arrangements for Nick alone. Katie shows up at the hospital later because he forgot his insurance card, and Mike lights into her about doing as he asked. He cuts himself off before he tells her he blames her for Nick's death, but Katie is devastated by how deep this goes with Mike. Jen tells Dusty about what happened with Lucy and how uncomfortable she is with Lucy's access to Johnny. Dusty tells her he got word Craig is trying to block him from adopting Johnny. Dusty promises that Jessica is working to stop him, but Jen can't help but wonder if Lucy was sent there by Craig to try to insinuate she is an unfit parent or maybe Lucy is thinking of taking Johnny away to raise him for her dad? Dusty promises to get to the bottom of this. He later confronts Lucy and tells her to stay away from Jen and their baby! When Will shows up at the graduation to talk to Gwen, and everyone is fussing over him to get his cap and gown on, they are stunned when the principal approaches him and tells him to get off the property since he was expelled for cheating."

        "Casey: Mom, take the picture. Today, please?",
        "Margo: You know, I don't know why your dad has to be such a technophile. I mean, I can't even see these buttons. Can't you just point and shoot?",
        "[Casey sighs]",
        "Casey: We'll wait 'till Dad gets here.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no. No, keep together.",
        "Casey: Mom --",
        "Margo: I told him I would take the \"before\" pictures because he can't make the ceremony.",
        "Casey: I'm going to look the same after the ceremony.",
        "Margo: Oh, I hate this!",
        "Casey: Here, I'll set it up.",
        "Margo: Sorry.",
        "Casey: Mom, there are people here.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. I promised I wasn't going to cry until after the ceremony, but I can't keep that promise. Oh, Casey, you're the best. I'm sorry. I guess you never thought you'd be hearing that from me after the last couple of months, but now you and Gwen have become such good friends, and you're just growing up.",
        "Casey: Nothing to it. Time passes. And you get taller.",
        "Margo: I'm really proud of you.",
        "Casey: It's all set. You've got to stop acting like this is such a big deal. I'm just one school year to the next, like always.",
        "Margo: You know, it's just that, you're going off to college -- I wasn't going to say anything until your dad got here --",
        "Casey: You got me new rims!",
        "Margo: Almost as good!",
        "Casey: Ah!",
        "Margo: No, listen -- your dad and I have been talking, and we've decided that since you've worked so hard and proven yourself so responsible, that, we've reconsidered our position on the University of Wisconsin. So, we called the administrator's office and worked everything out.",
        "Casey: So that means that I --",
        "Margo: That you're going to the University of Wisconsin this September with all of your friends! Happy graduation!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Will: Hello?",
        "Mr. Weber: Will? What are you doing at home? We had a meeting scheduled.",
        "Will: Hey, Mr. Weber.",
        "Mr. Weber: You and your parents were supposed to meet me in my office over an hour ago. I've been waiting for you.",
        "Will: I know. I'm sorry. I've been trying to get a hold of them. But my dad's a cop, so he's always, you know, in and out. And my mom and him are divorced, so getting them in the same place at the same time -- it's tough.",
        "Mr. Weber: But you've told them you weren't graduating today?",
        "Will: Is there some way, any way at all that we could work something out?",
        "Mr. Weber: Cheating can't be tolerated. And I set up this meeting so we wouldn't have to take more serious steps.",
        "Will: It can't get worse.",
        "Mr. Weber: I'm afraid it can. This meeting was your last opportunity to take make up classes here at Oakdale Latin. Now, unfortunately, you've left me no choice but to expel you.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Mr. Weber: You'll have to find some other way to finish high school. Were your parents planning to attend graduation?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Mr. Weber: Well then, you'd better hurry up and speak with them before they get here. Will? Will, are you there?",
        "Will: Yeah, I heard you. Thanks. Bye.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Incoming! I love today.",
        "Will: Oh, I can tell.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Hal: I got it!",
        "Gwen: And this is just the beginning. I'm going to love the day that we start to look for our own place, and the day we buy furniture, and go to college --",
        "Will: You know Gwen, my mom might not come through with the trust fund even if I do graduate.",
        "Gwen: If? Honey, we're like, minutes away from picking up our diplomas. And we don't need your trust fund. We have each other. And thanks to you, actually, it's in writing. We did it, together. And that's the way it's always going to be. Hey? Hey, baby, what's wrong?",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Will: I got it.",
        "Hal: Probably just another well-wisher. Hello? Oh, hey, Kim. Yeah, we should be leaving in a few minutes. And we'll see you there.",
        "Barbara: Well, there is my graduate! Hi, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Barbara: Oh, honey. Honey. All right. It's official. It's your trust fund. And, honey, you've earned every penny of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "[Katie screams]",
        "Katie: Mike? Mike! Mike!",
        "[Katie screams]",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey. [Katie sighs] I guess I overslept. What were you doing?",
        "Mike: I was packing.",
        "Katie: Packing?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Some of Nick's stuff was still here, and I -- I talked to his parents. They wanted everything sent over right away. They don't want to come here so --",
        "Katie: Oh, of course. I woke up a couple of times. You weren't here.",
        "Mike: I couldn't sleep.",
        "Katie: I keep hearing it. That feeling of the gun -- Nick's -- could we just spend the day together today? Just you and me?",
        "Mike: No, I've got a ton of stuff to do.",
        "Katie: Well, I can help you. And then later we could take a walk, or something.",
        "Mike: I'm heading out right now. They're ready to release Nick's body and I have to make arrangements to send him home to his parents.",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, I'll get dressed fast.",
        "Mike: No, I can handle this.",
        "Katie: He was your cousin, Mike. You loved him. I'm not going to let you claim his body by yourself.",
        "Mike: Don't you get this? Saying good-bye to Nick is something I need to do without your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Dr. Lake. We were just heading to your office.",
        "Dr. Lake: Hello, Jennifer. You're scheduled for another vaccination today, aren't you, big guy?",
        "Jennifer: Yes he is. And actually, that's something I want to talk to you about --",
        "Dr. Lake: Excuse me, Jennifer. One of our new interns is going to be observing today, so I'd like you and Johnny to meet her. Do you mind?",
        "Jennifer: Of course not. Of course.",
        "Dr. Lake: Jennifer and Johnny Munson, I'd like you to meet Dr. Lucy Montgomery.",
        "Lucy: It's good to see you again, Jennifer.",
        "Dr. Lake: You two know each other?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, we do.",
        "Lucy: Aww. How's this sweetheart? Hey, you're so precious.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Dr. Lake: Well, let's get back to my office, and we'll get Johnny his vaccine.",
        "Jennifer: Doctor, you know, I really wanted to talk to you about that. I had a concern after the last shot. He had bad reaction, you know, and I was wondering if it was possible to put off the next one?",
        "Dr. Lake: Well, you called about that. He had a fever?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, and a rash. And he was really restless. We were up all night.",
        "Lucy: But the symptoms were gone by the morning?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, they were --",
        "Lucy: Then, just thinking about what's best in the long run, it's more important to get Johnny protected against serious illness. Since his side effects were minor and disappeared quickly, I'd strongly suggest we go ahead and give him his shot today.",
        "Dr. Lake: As I recall, Johnny is completely up to date with his shots. Is that right, Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, yes, he is.",
        "Lucy: Well, that's good. You know some parents believe vaccinations are unnecessary or even bad for the child, but science suggests they're crucial.",
        "Jennifer: I agree. And I know that. And of course I want him protected --",
        "Dr. Lake: Irritability and a low fever are common reactions. But if Johnny's having a hard time with the shots, there's no reason why we should put you or him through it again at this time. We'll give you and your son a break before the next vaccination.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Dr. Lake: Bring Johnny back next week. No reason to rush.",
        "Jennifer: Great, great. Thank you so much, doctor.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. It's a new rotation for me. I can be a little carried away. If I'm a little overprotective maybe it's because the patient is my half brother.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, something that you obviously forgot to mention to doctor. Isn't there some law about not treating relatives?",
        "Lucy: I didn't treat him, per se. I'm sorry, Jennifer. I obviously offended you.",
        "Jennifer: Look, just because Johnny is Craig's son, it does not give you the right to --",
        "Lucy: How did my father get into this conversation? He has nothing to do with this.",
        "Jennifer: Right.",
        "Lucy: Jennifer, when I gave my opinion about the vaccination, I was only trying to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm sorry I snapped at you. I just -- I need to deal with Nick on my own.",
        "Katie: Why? There's so much to do. And there's two of us. It'll go so much faster if we do it together.",
        "Mike: I don't want it to go fast. I need time. I can't even believe he's gone.",
        "Katie: I can just be with you.",
        "Mike: I'll call you when I'm done.",
        "Katie: All right, I'll fix lunch.",
        "Mike: I don't know when I'll be back. This could take a while.",
        "Katie: Okay. Were you going to take that to the cleaners?",
        "Mike: Yeah, but I can do it.",
        "Katie: I can do it, honey. I'll do it for you. When's the funeral?",
        "Mike: They're not sure. They're still trying to figure out how this could've happened.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: I got to go.",
        "Katie: Mike, wait.",
        "Mike: Yeah?",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, what do you think?",
        "Casey: About U of W? I think it's great that you and Dad are starting to trust me again. And Dad said maybe in the spring but this fall? Wow.",
        "Margo: Is that a good wow?",
        "Casey: Well, I mean, this is a little out the blue, Mom. Can I have some time to think about it?",
        "Margo: Wow, yeah, I thought you'd jump at it. You know, you were so upset when we told you couldn't go.",
        "Casey: Well, yeah, that was after I already told everybody in the known universe that I was going.",
        "Margo: Are you no longer speaking to the universe?",
        "Casey: What if I want to stay here?",
        "Margo: Well, I would love that. You to go to Oakdale U, that would be great, but what about, \"I can't wait to get out of here. I can't wait to join a fraternity. I can't wait to date the dairy queens.\" Anything ringing a bell here?",
        "Casey: Yeah, but things change, you know. I've got a great job at Crash, doing the music. Who would give that up?",
        "Margo: Yeah who? Does it have anything to do with Maddie?",
        "Casey: No, I wouldn't stay because of Maddie.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on. It's got to have something to do with Maddie.",
        "Casey: Okay, it might have a little something to do with Maddie. Okay, a lot of something to do with Maddie. But, this is about being honest, right?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Casey: I don't need to think about it. I'm not going to Wisconsin. I want to stay here.",
        "Mr. Weber: Detective Hughes, I hate to interrupt, but the patrolmen we ordered for crowd control aren't here yet, and the students are getting a little carried away. We expected them to TP the faculty cars, but when it comes to spray paint on statues, we lose our sense of humor.",
        "Margo: All right, I'll see what I can do. You -- did you have anything to do with this?",
        "Casey: I've been right here with you. I'd have proof, but someone didn't know how to use a digital camera.",
        "Margo: You're such a smart boy!",
        "Casey: Doe-si-doe.",
        "Maddie: I'm so happy you're not going to Wisconsin!",
        "Casey: Yeah, me too. What's wrong?",
        "Maddie: Why can't she just leave him alone? It's Jade.",
        "Casey: Leave who alone?",
        "Maddie: Never mind. Don't worry about it.",
        "Jade: Excuse me. Have you seen Will Munson anywhere?",
        "Lily: Do I look like lost and found?",
        "Nate: And when I saw you walk in, I just assumed you'd be looking for me.",
        "Jade: Hi. Actually, I'm looking for Gwen, Will's wife. We've kind of gotten to be friends. But, anyway, have you seen her?",
        "Nate: Jade, what's the real reason you asked me about those questions on the Calculus test?",
        "Jade: I told you. I just wanted to see how much I could remember if I decide to take a course or something.",
        "Nate: Did you give those answers to Will?",
        "Jade: Why would I do that?",
        "Nate: Well, I've been hearing a bunch of rumors all day about how one of the seniors got caught cheating in Calculus and Bio. And now all of the sudden you're here looking for Will. Look, did you tell him what was going to be on the test?",
        "Jade: Why would I do that?",
        "Nate: Do you have any idea how much trouble I'll be in if they find out I gave you the answers to the test and then you help Will cheat? I could lose my scholarships, Jade.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I know. Which is why you should think about that before you start throwing around accusations. You're a smart guy, Nate. Do the smart thing and keep your mouth shut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Okay, now, if you have any questions about your trust, you can call my attorney, or you can simply ask me.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Hal: Hello. Yes, this is Hal Munson.",
        "Barbara: Will, honey, have you heard anything that I've said? Huh?",
        "Hal: What? Are you sure? Hold on a second. I'll be right back.",
        "Barbara: And all of this will come to be as soon as the commencement exercises have been completed.",
        "Gwen: So, I guess you heard that Will finished up the year with flying colors?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I did, and I am so proud of you.",
        "Will: Stop it, Mom! Be proud of Gwen. She did this all on her own. With no tutors and stuff.",
        "Barbara: I just didn't think this was going to work -- the two of you getting married. Living here. Going to school.",
        "Gwen: We're just full of surprises, aren't we?",
        "Barbara: Yes, you are. Now, I'm going to get on over to the school and get myself a good seat, okay? Gwen, honey, why don't you ride with me?",
        "Gwen: Will?",
        "Will: Yeah, go ahead. It's fine. I'm gonna hold for Dad.",
        "Gwen: You sure?",
        "Will: Absolutely.",
        "Barbara: I can get to know my daughter-in-law a little bit better.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'm gonna take these caps and gowns just so you don't forget, okay?",
        "Will: Yeah, that's good idea.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I love you.",
        "Will: I love you, too.",
        "Barbara: And I love you, too.",
        "Will: Hey, Dad. Is everything okay?",
        "Hal: No. And it started out to be such a great day.",
        "Will: That's just the way it is in this family. Stuff just goes wrong no matter how hard you try, right?",
        "Hal: Do you remember Teddy Brewster? We were best friends in the police academy. He was shot in the line of duty last night.",
        "Will: Oh, man.",
        "Hal: He's in critical condition, he may not make it. His wife says he's asking for me. I told her I couldn't come.",
        "Will: No, Dad, you gotta go.",
        "Hal: How many times does my son graduate from high school?",
        "Will: Dad, you're not gonna be missing anything. And besides, you know, between Mom and Jen, there's gonna be plenty of videotape and pictures to go around. It'll be just like being there.",
        "Hal: Nothing is like being there, Will. And I really haven't been there enough for you.",
        "Will: Sure, you have.",
        "Hal: That's a nice thing to say, but --",
        "Will: Dad, you know, I think I'm seeing things better now. Because I tried to do the right thing. You know, be the guy that everybody wants you to be. But sometimes you just can't do it.",
        "Hal: I love you, son. You've turned out to be such a fine young man.",
        "Will: Dad, no, I haven't.",
        "Hal: I know you don't like the sappy stuff. But this is my only shot at it, so I'm gonna take it. I underestimated you, Will. I really didn't think you could pull this off. Covering all that school work, and working a job at night, the same time. I didn't think you could handle the pressure, but you did. Congratulations. I'm gonna miss having you and Gwen around. Now, are you sure it's okay if I don't come to your graduation?",
        "Will: Yeah, Dad, I'm sure. I'll be fine.",
        "Hal: Have a great day, the both of you.",
        "Will: What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?",
        "Jade: Will, I saw you through the window. What's going on? Are you okay?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Jade: Why? Did the principal finally catch up with you?",
        "Will: He expelled me. And now Gwen's at school and she's waiting for me, and she thinks we're gonna walk across the stage hand in hand and get our diplomas. You know? And how do I tell her this? How do I tell her that I'm not gonna graduate?",
        "Jade: Maybe you don't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: There he is. My grandson, the graduate!",
        "Kim: Casey, come on out here. I want to get some videotape of you shaking hands with Councilwoman Shore.",
        "Casey: Who?",
        "Maddie: Keynote speaker.",
        "Casey: Oh, right, yeah. All right, cool. But why am I getting my picture taken with her?",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, because Kim is going to see to it that our grandson is seen on television on his graduation day.",
        "Casey: All right, sweet. Can Maddie come, too?",
        "Kim: Absolutely. Just come along, we don't have much time.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Nate: Hey, Maddie. Look, do you have a minute? It's really important.",
        "Casey: Actually, we were gonna go do this thing.",
        "Maddie: No, it's okay. I'll just meet you over there.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Maddie: It's okay.",
        "Casey: Nate.",
        "Maddie: What's up?",
        "Nate: Look, I think I'm about to be in big trouble because of Jade, and maybe Will. And I think you might know something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Wow. Yeah, I -- I really -- I don't know what to say.",
        "Barbara: Well, I knew that you'd love it. And I took the liberty of insuring it for you.",
        "Gwen: That's good, 'cause we wouldn't want it to get lost or anything. Well, thanks. And thanks for giving me a ride over here.",
        "Barbara: Well, I meant what I said in the car about us shopping -- having a shopping day.",
        "Gwen: You're kidding, right?",
        "Barbara: No, I'm not. I know that you and Will need things for your place, and I certainly know my way around the merchandise mart.",
        "Gwen: Well, actually, we already have plans.",
        "Barbara: Oh, well, honey, I'm free all next week. How about Tuesday?",
        "Gwen: Look, Ms. Ryan --",
        "Barbara: Honey, call me Mom.",
        "Gwen: I -- I don't know how to say this -- but you're gonna have to back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Mike: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: You forgot this.",
        "Mike: My insurance card? Why would I need that?",
        "Katie: You're supposed to have it with you all the time. Just in case.",
        "Mike: In case? In case of an accident? In case I end up in the hospital? We've had our share of hospital visits, so I think I'm safe.",
        "Katie: You're mad that I came.",
        "Mike: I told you that I wanted to do this alone.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: You know what? I'm tired of sorry. I want you to stay home and stop following me. If you hadn't have followed me, Nick --",
        "Katie: Finish it. If I hadn't followed you, Nick wouldn't be dead.",
        "Mike: Katie, I'm upset, and I don't want to say anything that --",
        "Katie: What, say what? What you're feeling? Are you scared that you're going to tell me what you're thinking? Because it would better than this silence.",
        "Mike: Thank you for the insurance card. I'll see you at home, okay?",

        "Dusty: That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Let's get him to the sitter. I don't want to be late for will's graduation.",
        "Dusty: What's going on? You look upset. What happened?",
        "Jennifer: No, it's nothing. I would like to take a swing at your ex- girlfriend, though.",

        "Jennifer: Yeah, she's assisting dr. Lake now.",
        "Dusty: Oh, since when?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. There's some sort of hospital rotation, and she was there when we got there. And basically, she made me feel bad about wanting to postpone the vaccination.",
        "Dusty: What'd she say?",
        "Jennifer: She just made me feel like it was a bad choice. Like I'm not a good mother.",
        "Dusty: Well, you know better than that.",
        "Jennifer: But it really got to me, you know? Because it -- it sounded like Craig talking. It sounded like Lucy was following his orders.",
        "Dusty: Did she mention Craig?",
        "Jennifer: No, I did. And maybe she's totally innocent in all this. But you know what? It really bothers me that she has -- she has total access to Johnny's records. She does. And maybe I'm crazy to be this paranoid since Craig's in prison. But with you trying to adopt Johnny and -- I'm overreacting, aren't I?",

        "Jennifer: No. Honey, Craig is Johnny's biological father. Legally, that means he has rights.",
        "Dusty: He has no case. He's locked up for crimes against you and Johnny. No judge is gonna take him seriously as a father.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but what if he tries to gum up the works, you know, slow things down. So that by the time that we do get a court date, he's out of prison and at our door.",
        "Dusty: Listen to me, Jessica's on top of it. She's filing things already to discredit his character. She's also pushing to get him -- you know, hopefully, ours within a couple of days.",

        "Jennifer: But what about Lucy, huh? What if Lucy -- what if this is all about Lucy? She's trying to build a case against me and paint me as an unfit mother?",
        "Dusty: And give Craig custody? It can't happen.",
        "Jennifer: But maybe the idea is for Lucy to someday get custody. Did you ever think about that? Maybe that's Craig's plan. To use Lucy to take Johnny away from me. Away from us.",

I mean, this was like big, goofy, sweet Nick who was so good to me when you were away. How could he possibly murder someone? And when that guy in Carly's basement told us that Nick was definitely the one who killed Maya, I didn't want to believe it -- I still didn't want to believe it. But when he hit you so hard that you fell to the ground -- you -- I was scared. I thought he was gonna hurt me and I had to stop him. And still to this day, when I think about the sound of that gun and I see Nick falling to the ground, I grieve for him. I grieve for that man who I thought I knew.
