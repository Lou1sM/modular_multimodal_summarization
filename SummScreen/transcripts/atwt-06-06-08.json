Carly looks disappointed but she tells Jack she has happy to have him there to watch Sage. Sage enjoys the ride so much she wants to try it without Jack holding the horse. Holden sends Jack and Carly with Sage on the trail and stays at the house. Carly confronts Holden about why he has been avoiding her, and he tells her she knows why, but Jack interrupts them before they finish the conversation. Jack thinks he interrupted a fight between Carly and Holden, but Carly tells him she intended to surprise Jack with the fact that Sage could ride a horse, but Holden ruined the surprise. Casey and Emily are forced together when they have to take Daniel to a concert in New York. Casey and Emily make love and are almost caught by Daniel when he returns from the concert. After Sofie presses rape charges against Paul, he is arrested when DNA evidence proves that he could be a possible suspect.

        "Carly: Hi, Sweetie. But the real question is what about you? Just say it, Katie. You're afraid.",
        "Carly: Hi, Sweetie. What do you think of this lip gloss? Do you like the color?",
        "Sage: It looks pretty, but why do you care? We're just going horseback riding with Holden.",
        "Carly: Right. But that's no reason not to look my best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: Not good. Not good. Just knock it off, you idiot!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Ohh -- you know, the last three hours of my shift, all I could think of was your hands doing exactly what they're doing.",
        "Paul: Really? Three hours, and I never got past your feet?",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Well, there's still time.",
        "Paul: Great.",
        "Meg: Have you heard anything from Sofie?",
        "Paul: No. Whatever you said to her must've worked.",
        "Meg: You know, if you keep doing that, I will be one happy woman.",
        "Paul: Okay. I think I've finally found my life's work.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Margo: Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't know that you had company.",
        "Paul: Hello, Lieutenant.",
        "Meg: Paul and I are back together.",
        "Margo: Congratulations.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Meg: Is everything all right?",
        "Margo: No, actually. Paul, I needed to speak to you privately, please.",
        "Meg: I'll be right upstairs.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no. Anything you have to say to me you can say in front of Meg.",
        "Margo: All right. Mike Kasnoff came to see me about Sofie Duran.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Margo: Sofie claims that she was raped -- by you. Care to comment?",
        "Paul: No. No, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daniel: Hey, Dude. Don't let Dad catch you goofing off.",
        "Casey: Hey, Buddy! Hey! I thought Dad was gonna pick you up?",
        "Daniel: No. Mom wanted to get breakfast with me before we go. It's not like she's not gonna see me all summer.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I missed you, okay? Sue me.",
        "Casey: Hey, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi, Case. Good to see you.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Daniel: Dude, I was so stoked when Dad told me you were coming to New York with us. The city's awesome.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty awesome.",
        "Daniel: And my friend Rob's dad got us tickets to the Noxit concert at the Highline. You heard of them?",
        "Casey: I don't live in a cave, Dude.",
        "Daniel: Well, if you want, I can try and scalp you some tickets off the internet.",
        "Emily: Whoa! Scalping? There will be no scalping. I'll talk to my music critic and see if he can get you some tickets.",
        "Casey: No, I'll pass, thanks. I'm gonna probably hang out with Dad during the show.",
        "Tom: Don't do me any favors, Case.",
        "Daniel: Dad!",
        "Tom: Hey! How you doing, Man?",
        "Daniel: So, what time are we leaving?",
        "Tom: Actually, there's been a complication.",
        "Daniel: No.",
        "Tom: Yeah, there's something going on over at Memorial Hospital, and I have to be available in case my dad needs some legal advice. And you didn't hear anything about that, Emily.",
        "Emily: Ah, code of silence. But I have a source there. I get a call, I'm running with it.",
        "Tom: Then the story's all yours. Just don't go down there and do any pre- emptive sniffing around, okay?",
        "Daniel: Well, what about the concert? Can Margo take us instead?",
        "Tom: She's working. The only way you could get there is if Emily decided to take you on short notice.",
        "Casey: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Did Sofie report this so-called crime?",
        "Margo: No, not officially.",
        "Meg: So, why are you here?",
        "Margo: Because I'm concerned. I went to talk to Sofie about what happened.",
        "Paul: What allegedly happened. She's delusional.",
        "Margo: Obviously, she's been traumatized.",
        "Meg: Paul did not rape her.",
        "Paul: No, I rejected her, which, last time I checked, was legal in the state of Illinois.",
        "Margo: Let's just say, for argument's sake, that there is some truth to Sofie's accusations.",
        "Meg: No. So, why discuss it?",
        "Margo: Because it's my job, so we will.",
        "Paul: Oh, so -- so, this is optional?",
        "Margo: Now, there are very many reasons why Sofie might not come forward -- fear, shame, worry about the future of her business.",
        "Paul: Well, she should be worried. Talk about how not to win friends and influence investors.",
        "Meg: Paul, let's just hear what Margo has to say.",
        "Paul: No, she's accusing me of rape!",
        "Margo: No! No, I'm not. I want us to just have a simple conversation. This is strictly optional.",
        "Paul: Well, I am opting to not volunteer, because Sofie Duran lives in a fantasy world, and there's no way I'm going to let her drag me down into her nonsense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Lieutenant Hughes is out. Do you want to wait?",
        "Mike: Sofie?",
        "Sofie: I need to report a crime.",
        "Cop: Have a seat. I'll let her know you're here.",
        "Sofie: This place creeps me out.",
        "Mike: You're making the right decision, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Thank you for coming with me. I really couldn't do this alone.",
        "Mike: What made you change your mind?",
        "Sofie: I don't know. I don't know. I couldn't let Paul get away with what he did to me. And then I kept hearing you in my head, asking me, \"What if he hurts someone else?\" And you were right. I can't -- I can't take that chance.",
        "Mike: Well, you're making the right decision. I just -- I hope it's not too late. The cops are going to need more than just your word if they're gonna make a case against Paul.",
        "Sofie: They'll have a case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Margo: Hughes. Really? Yeah, all right. I'll be right there. Change of plan. Sofie's down at the station. She wants to give a statement.",
        "Meg: Well, she's lying.",
        "Margo: Paul, I'm going to have to talk to you downtown.",
        "Paul: Doesn't sound so voluntary anymore.",
        "Meg: Paul didn't do anything wrong. Anyone who talks to Sofie for five minutes can tell that she's obsessed with Paul and this has spun way out of control.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, but I would like to hear Paul's side of the story.",
        "Paul: This is absurd. That's my side of the story. You can't prove that I raped Sofie Duran because I didn't.",
        "Margo: Good. Then you'll have nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Good morning.",
        "Holden: Morning. Hey, Sage, what do you think of this horse?",
        "Carly: Oh, this is Angie. I've met her.",
        "Holden: She's been around this place for a long time. I was there when she was born.",
        "Carly: Isn't she pretty?",
        "Sage: I guess.",
        "Carly: She's soft, too. Come on, Sage. Give her a pat.",
        "Sage: I don't want to.",
        "Holden: You know what? I have a better idea. Why don't you feed her this? She'll be your friend for life. Here's what you got to do. You just put it in your palm and you let her take it. And I promise you, she won't bite your fingers. She doesn't like fingers. They make her nauseous. [Carly and Sage laugh] But one important horse fact -- always approach a horse from the side, never from the front, 'cause it's their blind spot, okay? So, why don't you take this? You two get better acquainted, okay?",
        "Carly: You're good with her.",
        "Holden: Well, nobody should be afraid of horses. They'd be missing out on one of the greatest things in life.",
        "Carly: Oh, I packed some us some sandwiches. I thought we could stop someplace and have a picnic -- not that your lint-flavored beef jerky wasn't delicious. But I upgraded us to roast beef.",
        "Holden: Carly, there's something that -- I need to tell you.",
        "Jack: Hey, Sage, look at you!",
        "Sage: Daddy! Are you going to come riding with us?",
        "Jack: Oh, absolutely. I wouldn't miss it for the world.",
        "Carly: Jack -- I didn't realize you were coming with us.",
        "Jack: Holden called.",
        "Holden: I thought that Sage would be a lot more comfortable with her dad here.",
        "Sage: Yeah. It's gonna be even more fun with the three of us.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Carly: I thought you had to work.",
        "Jack: Oh, I took the day off. I didn't want to miss Sage's first time on a horse.",
        "Sage: Her name's Angie.",
        "Jack: Really? Angie? I'll have to remember that. You're not scared of her, are you?",
        "Sage: She likes to eat apples.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's good to know, too. Why didn't you tell me the two of you were giving Sage riding lessons?",
        "Carly: I guess it didn't come up.",
        "Jack: Well, thanks for asking me, Man.",
        "Holden: No problem. She's gonna be great. She's a natural.",
        "Sage: Thanks.",
        "Jack: I hope you don't mind me being here.",
        "Carly: No. It's fine. It's just not what I expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Casey, what's going on with you?",
        "Emily: You know what? I think he was looking forward to the male-bonding weekend thing, and he can't do that with me hanging around.",
        "Casey: Don't you have to work, anyway?",
        "Daniel: Mom, please come. I can't miss this concert.",
        "Casey: No, no, Man. She can't come. This was supposed to be a guys' trip. I could take him, Dad. We don't need any chaperones.",
        "Daniel: Yeah, that would be cool -- you know, just the guys, no grown-ups.",
        "Casey: I'm a grown-up, Daniel.",
        "Tom: Yeah, you're a grown-up.",
        "Emily: You know what? It's New York. Case, it's far away, and I don't like the idea of not being able to get to you if, God forbid, something happens. I've got to be there!",
        "Casey: I can handle it.",
        "Tom: Casey, you've never even been to New York City. You don't know your way around.",
        "Daniel: Please don't make me miss the show. Rob's dad said he might even be able to get us backstage to meet the band.",
        "Emily: Oh, backstage? How do I say no? Okay, fine. I'll take you. I've got to run by the office, pick up a few things, and I'll be back to come get you.",
        "Tom: Nice. Grab your bags. Besides, I want to hear all about finals. We haven't had all our finals at school.",
        "Emily: Don't you dare ruin this for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I should've known you were behind this.",
        "Mike: Back off, Ryan.",
        "Paul: Are you the reason Margo dragged me down here? Did you convince her to come up with this ridiculous story?",
        "Sofie: No, it was my idea. Mike came for moral support.",
        "Paul: Oh, that's an interesting choice of words.",
        "Margo: Sofie, I need you to come in the interrogation room.",
        "Mike: Do you want me to come with you?",
        "Margo: No, Mike. Sofie's got to do this on her own. Paul, you're next. Come on.",
        "Paul: You couldn't just leave everything alone, could you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, Sofie decided to make an official statement, and now Paul has been taken in for questioning.",
        "Barbara: He's at the police station? Why?",
        "Meg: Okay, try not to get upset, Barbara. This is why Paul didn't want to say anything, but I said we had to because I didn't want you hearing it from somebody else.",
        "Barbara: Okay, just tell me -- has he been charged with rape?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I don't know what's happening. Margo came by Fairwinds earlier, and she said she wanted to hear Paul's side of the story -- off the record.",
        "Barbara: Right, right. This isn't about Sofie. Margo was raped years ago. She's hardwired to give Sofie the benefit of the doubt.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Well, she's no fan of Paul's, and Paul didn't help himself. He gave her a lot of attitude.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm sure that he did. I mean, come on -- rape? You believe him, don't you?",
        "Meg: With all my heart.",
        "Barbara: Good. Good. I could wring Sofie's neck. I actually felt sorry for that girl, and so did Paul. And I knew that she was fixated on him, so I set her up in business to divert her attention. Instead, I just threw them together.",
        "Meg: Look, you were just trying to help her make something of her life, and you did. Thanks to you and Paul, she started her own business.",
        "Barbara: Right, and this is the thanks we get.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I never expected her to do something like this.",
        "Barbara: And neither did I. She played the whole innocent thing. I mean, I bought into the fragile act, even after what hell she put Will and Gwen through, and now she's moved on to my other son?",
        "Meg: She's unbalanced, Barbara. You couldn't have known that.",
        "Barbara: Unbalanced and desperately needy -- a very dangerous combination. There's no telling what she will do. She could ruin Paul's life.",
        "Meg: I will help Paul. I will get him the best lawyer I can find if it comes to that.",
        "Barbara: You can't wait. Time is of the essence.",
        "Meg: Well, I'll do that now, today.",
        "Barbara: No, I will do it.",
        "Meg: No. I don't want you getting worked up, Barbara, okay? You're not strong enough.",
        "Barbara: I am as strong as my children need me to be. And right now I'm strong enough to go see my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You treat women like trash, and it's about time somebody called you on it.",
        "Paul: I didn't treat her like trash. I believed in her talents. I encouraged her to use her skills. I gave her money to start her business.",
        "Mike: And you assumed that gave you rights.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Mike: You thought that she owed you, and you asked for payback and she refused, so you forced yourself on her.",
        "Paul: Is that what she said happened?",
        "Mike: She is a gullible kid. You took advantage of her in the worst possible way. But you will not get away with it. And I hear they hate rapists in prison.",
        "Paul: You're lucky we're surrounded by cops.",
        "Mike: Get used to it.",
        "Paul: She's playing you, Mike. I didn't do anything to Sofie, and soon the world will know that she's a liar and that you're a stupid idiot for believing her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul invested in my jewelry line with his mother. I don't know the exact amount.",
        "Margo: That's all right. What I really need are just the details of what happened the night in question. Now, you said the incident --",
        "Sofie: He raped me.",
        "Margo: Happened after you left the Lakeview, after you left the party?",
        "Sofie: It was the best night of my life, and I didn't want to just go upstairs, so -- so Paul invited me back to his place for a drink.",
        "Margo: And, now, you had been to Fairwinds before?",
        "Sofie: Many, many times. Many times to help Barbara while she was sick. And I didn't want to be alone, so I went. But Paul -- he wanted to --",
        "Margo: Sofie, I'm sorry, but you have to say the words.",
        "Sofie: He wanted to make love. Have sex. But I didn't. I wanted to keep the relationship strictly professional, and when I told him that, he got so angry.",
        "Margo: All right, it's okay. Take a deep breath, okay? Just relax. I know it's difficult.",
        "Sofie: I want to forget it, but I can't, 'cause it just keeps playing over and over in my mind.",
        "Margo: I totally understand. Please just keep breathing. [Sofie breathes deeply] Now, you know that Paul says that you're making this up.",
        "Sofie: I know. But I'm not. And these will prove it.",
        "Margo: You were wearing these the other night?",
        "Sofie: I put them back on after Paul -- just after \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, are you okay?",
        "Paul: I'm fine. This is all going to blow over as soon as I get a chance to tell Margo what really happened.",
        "Barbara: You're not going to get any justice from Margo. She was a rape victim herself. She'll be biased.",
        "Paul: Then I'll ask to speak to Jack Snyder.",
        "Barbara: Why? Because he's your best friend? No. You've got to keep your wits about you in this place.",
        "Paul: I will, Mom. What are you doing here? You should be home. You should be resting.",
        "Barbara: I can't possibly rest when you're fighting for your life here.",
        "Meg: I tried to get her to stay home, but she wouldn't have it.",
        "Barbara: No, I am not going to stay home. I am going to help you out of this. I'm going to find you an attorney, because you have to be prepared.",
        "Paul: At least humor me, please, and have a seat. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Can I have a word with you?",
        "Mike: Sure.",
        "Meg: Okay, what is really going on here?",
        "Mike: Sofie needed someone to come with her.",
        "Meg: Oh -- and it was her idea, or is this your way of getting back at Paul?",
        "Mike: We are talking about rape here. And if you think I would take advantage of Sofie's pain for my own personal reasons, then you don't know me very well.",
        "Meg: No, I guess I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Okay, maybe you can go back to New York with me, sleep in the room next door, and pretend like nothing's going on, but I cannot.",
        "Emily: You can, and you will, Casey. What choice do we have?",
        "Casey: Just say you have to work. That's the only excuse my parents are gonna believe. Every time --",
        "Emily: No! You heard my son. Daniel is looking forward to this. Come on, Casey. I don't get to spend a lot of time with my son. Don't take this away from me.",
        "Casey: Okay. Then maybe I shouldn't go.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Five minutes ago, you said you were going. How are you gonna explain your change of heart, Casey? You can't do that. We just -- we have to figure out a way to -- we've got to figure out a way to act normal around each other.",
        "Casey: Normal? Normal for me is throwing you on this couch --",
        "Emily: Stop it. Stop it, okay? Our families are connected. Situations like this are going to come up all the time. We have to figure out a way to act casually around each other. Stop it, okay? The more we practice, the easier it'll get, and we'll start to feel that way.",
        "Casey: Do you know how I feel when I'm around you? There's nothing casual about it.",
        "Emily: Casey, please do this. Please do this for me, okay? Let me have this weekend with my son. I'm begging you.",
        "Emily: Tom, change of plans. I am going to go to the office and finish things over there, and I will be back to pick up the guys.",
        "Tom: Terrific. Thanks.",
        "Emily: Bye, yeah.",
        "Tom: So, what is it with you and Emily? And by the way, put a shirt on when there's an older woman in the house.",
        "Casey: I don't know. It's weird. You know, to suddenly be traveling with Emily when I don't even work for her anymore. But Daniel really wants to go, so I'll deal.",
        "Tom: And I thank you for putting up with her. It's going to mean the world to Danny to have his big brother along.",
        "Casey: Hey, it's one night.",
        "Tom: Well, it's also very comforting to know that you and Emily aren't going to be BFFs, you know?",
        "Casey: BFFs?",
        "Tom: Yeah. I mean, technically, she's part of the family, but we don't need to be around her any more than we have to, right? Hey, Danny, you ready?",
        "[Casey sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Look at you up there, Baby. Like you were born to ride.",
        "Carly: Smile, Sage. Nice big smile.",
        "Holden: How you doing, Honey? You okay?",
        "Sage: I like it. Are the horses at camp like Angie?",
        "Carly: Well, every horse is different, Honey. But when Holden and I were at the camp --",
        "Holden: Yeah, we took a tour of the stables, and not one of the horses was as big as this horse. And you've got her wrapped around your finger.",
        "Sage: Good. Now can we go for a ride without you holding her?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. What horse do I get, huh?",
        "Holden: Well, I'm going to let you and Jack figure that out.",
        "Carly: You're not coming?",
        "Holden: No. Jack, he knows the trails as well as I do, so I'll let you guys go.",
        "Jack: You sure?",
        "Holden: Yeah, positive. You guys take all the time you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What is wrong with you, Sofie? After all the generosity that we have shown you, this is how you thank us? You ought to be ashamed of yourself.",

        "Barbara: Not without a lawyer present.",
        "Paul: No, Mom. It's fine. I've got nothing to hide.",
        "Barbara: Is she pressing charges?",
        "Sofie: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "Meg: Paul, your mother is right. You shouldn't say anything without representation.",
        "Margo: However, it does look better if you make a voluntary statement.",
        "Paul: Probably makes your job a whole lot easier, too, doesn't it?",
        "Margo: I would like to run a DNA test, but I cannot compel you to give a sample.",
        "Paul: No problem. Grab a swab.",
        "Barbara: No!",
        "Paul: Mom, this is a no-brainer. There's no way my DNA can be linked to any evidence that Sofie has. She's got nothing, because nothing happened.",

        "Daniel: Yeah, yeah. Just try not to call. Be cool, okay?",
        "Emily: Okay. I will try to be cool. Do me a favor, don't stand too close to the speakers. I don't want you to blow out your eardrums.",
        "Friend: My mom says the same thing. As if.",
        "Daniel: Right?",
        "Friend: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Did I just warn him about losing his hearing?",
        "Casey: I'm afraid so. I think he's scarred for life now.",
        "Emily: Yeah, so am I. When did I get old?",
        "Casey: You didn't.",
        "Emily: Listen, I know you really didn't want to come back here with us, so I took the liberty of changing your return ticket at the airport. You can leave tonight if you want. Your flight's in about two hours.",
        "Casey: What am I supposed to tell my parents?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Tell them you checked your e-mail. There was something online about registration for school.",
        "Casey: Like I could forget that?",
        "Emily: You're a great liar, Casey. You'll think of something. Here.",
        "Casey: Is this what you want? For me to go home?",
        "Emily: It's what you want, isn't it?",

        "Sage: Duh, Mommy. I heard it the first time.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Carly: That is one smart kid. She gets everything you say the first time you say it.",

        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Well, that's the Snyder stubborn streak.",
        "Jack: No, no, no. That there is 100% Tenney. I'm sorry I didn't get your message in time to help you with the grill the other night. But it sounds like Holden saved the day.",
        "Carly: It worked out.",
        "Jack: You okay? You seem a little distracted.",
        "Carly: I guess it's just hitting me that Sage is really going to sleep-away camp.",
        "Jack: She'll be fine. I mean, didn't you hear? She's going to give her horse another apple.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you're right. She'll be fine.",
        "Jack: So the problem is you.",
        "Carly: What do you mean by that?",
        "Jack: Well, it sounds like someone is worried about how much they're going to miss someone else.",
        "Carly: You're right. That must be what it is. Okay, it's getting late. We should go.",

        "Paul: Here's to having you back in my life. I just hope this charade is over soon.",
        "Meg: What if it's not that easy.",
        "Paul: The DNA tests -- the results will be back, and this whole thing will be a nonissue.",
        "Meg: I can't believe Sofie was willing to put you through that. I am so angry.",
        "Paul: Hey. Please forget about Sofie and her drama. But a life with you -- I never thought I'd have that again, and I'm not going to let anything mess it up.",
        "Meg: Neither am I.",
        "Paul: Okay, then we have a deal. A second chance like this, I'm going to do everything right.",

        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Margo: This is Margo. We have the test results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I had the lab run a preliminary stat test on the DNA samples we got from both Paul and from Sofie and compared them. Now, a stat test isn't a definitive I.D., but it does help to rule out someone or not.",
        "Barbara: And there was no match, right? Sofie is lying.",
        "Margo: No. According to the lab report, Paul falls within the suspect group.",
        "Paul: That's not possible.",
        "Meg: A suspect group? So there are others.",
        "Margo: Theoretically, yes. But taken together with Sofie's testimony, we do have probable cause. As we proceed, we'll be doing more extensive tests.",
        "Paul: I didn't rape anybody.",
        "Meg: He was telling the truth, Margo. I was there that night. I saw Sofie. She was out of her mind.",
        "Margo: However, the evidence is compelling.",
        "Barbara: She manipulated it somehow, then. My son is not a rapist.",
        "Paul: Look, I -- this is a mistake. Sofie, I know you're upset.",
        "Mike: Upset? Is that how you think this is?",
        "Paul: You're hurt, but, please, you have to tell the truth.",
        "Sofie: I stand by my story.",
        "Margo: Paul Ryan, you are under arrest for the first-degree rape of Sofie Duran. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided by the court. You have the right to have an attorney present during any and all questioning. Do you understand?",
        "Meg: Why are you doing this to us?",
        "Mike: This isn't about you, Meg.",
        "Meg: Of course it is! Sofie is jealous because Paul didn't want her. You felt hurt and betrayed. You know, Paul did try to let you down gently, but you didn't listen.",
        "Sofie: What the hell do you know about it? Were you there? Did you hear us? No, you weren't, and you didn't!",
        "Meg: You know, you have no right to destroy Paul's life just because you didn't get what you wanted.",
        "Sofie: What about my life? I'm never gonna be the same.",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe that's a good thing, Sofie! You stay here, make sure that Paul's taken care of. I'm going to get the attorney. I'm not going to have him spend the night in jail. This little plot against my son, it's not going to work, Sofie. When the truth comes out, you're going to have to answer to me.",
        "Mike: Don't threaten her.",
        "Barbara: That is not a threat -- it's a promise. You stay here. I'll get the attorney.",
        "Mike: Don't worry, Sofie. Barbara can't do anything to you. She's all talk.",
        "Meg: Why are you defending her? She doesn't deserve this. You say you love Paul. Then why are you doing this to him?",
        "Sofie: He hurt me.",
        "Meg: Not in the way that you say he did.",
        "Sofie: You don't know anything about it. A long time ago, I knew how to fight back when people did bad things to me. I could stand up for myself. Somewhere along the line, I forgot how. And then I met Cole, and he treated me like dirt. And I let him. I let him hurt me over and over again, and I still loved him, and I still went back, but I'm not gonna let anybody do that to me anymore. I'm not gonna let anybody use me and then throw me out. I'm never gonna do that again.",
        "Meg: Well, you heard her. Sofie's no victim. She's a scorned woman. And if you choose to see it in some other light, then you're dead wrong.",
        "Mike: I know how much you want to believe that, but it doesn't make it true.",

        "Carly: Oh, no. Here it comes.",
        "Sage: Can I get my own horse?",
        "Jack: Why? Why would you need your own horse when Holden has a whole stable full of them? You can visit anytime you want.",
        "Sage: It's just not the same.",
        "Carly: I think somebody's getting very tired. Jack, would you mind taking Sage home? I'm just gonna go up to the house and thank Holden for setting this up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What was that about?",
        "Holden: Did Sage have a good time?",
        "Carly: Why did you invite Jack without telling me and then bail on the whole thing? Holden, are you trying to put me in my place?",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: You're avoiding me. You dodge me every chance you get. What are you so afraid of?",
        "Holden: I think you know the answer to that.",
        "Jack: Got to hand it to you, Holden. Sage is completely over her fear of horses. She wants one of her own now.",
        "Holden: That's great.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure what I walked in on. Are you two fighting about something?",
        "Carly: No. [Carly clears throat] No, it's just the horseback-riding lessons for Sage -- it was supposed to be a surprise.",
        "Jack: A surprise?",
        "Carly: For you. I know that you're nervous about sending her off to camp. I thought if Holden could give Sage some lessons, then when it's time to drop her off, she and I would walk you over to the stables and she'd climb on some big, beautiful horse and you'd be completely wowed by her expertise. But Holden can't keep a secret, for which I am slightly peeved.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stir things up. I'm going to go and take care of the horses.",
        "Jack: Okay. Hey, listen, we watered them already, but we -- [Door slams] its okay, Carly. I'm plenty surprised, just not the way you planned it. Take it easy on Holden. He's got a lot on his plate.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: All this stuff between him and Lily -- it gets to him.",
        "Carly: I know, Jack. I'm not blind.",
        "Jack: Right. Well, I'm just saying, we've got plenty of reasons to cut him some slack. Want me to give you a lift someplace?",
