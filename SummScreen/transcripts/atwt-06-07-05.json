        "Emily and Hal argue about her getting involved in pressing charges against Rosanna. He is worried that Rosanna and her lawyers, with all her money, will make Emily look terrible. Emily will not back down, as Hal questions why she is once again, emotionally involved with another man other then her husband. When he brings up Chris, Emily is devastated to learn how little he still trusts her. Emily suggests that she stay with her mom for a while. Rosanna goes to see Paul to tell him she intends on fighting for him, to prove how much she loves him. She reiterates James manipulations with her and Cabot, but Paul isn't sure he believes her, and is further angry by the fact she turned to Craig over him. Rosanna pulls him into a kiss as Emily enters. Emily assures Rosanna that they aren't falling for her story about James and Cabot, and they will be pressing charges against her. Rosanna is concerned that Paul told people about Cabot, and warns Paul that he doesn't know what he has done, as she leaves. Paul almost goes after her, but Emily stops him, and ends up telling him about Hal's refusal to help them press charges. She tells them she is staying with her mom because of their fight. Paul offers her a place to stay, but they stop considering that when Emily's cell phone rings. Will and Gwen talk about her pregnancy, and when Will starts to believe Gwen, he tells her she has to tell Casey because he deserves to know. Later at Casey's home, Gwen notices a moment between Will and Celia, and she questions if Will is convinced she should tell Casey because he wants Celia for herself. As Casey and Celia profess their love, she can't help but think of a dance she shared with Will. Lily gets into a car accident thanks to her brakes failing. At the hospital she remembers conversations with the mechanic about the car being serviced and ok, Keith's confession about planting the bee pollen, and Jessica warning Lily what Keith may be capable of if he finds out she is investigating him. She calls Carly to have her pick up her children and meet her back at home. A frantic Lily is followed home, where she meets with Carly, who is very concerned with her after hearing what happened with her brakes, and how Keith admitted to planting the bee pollen. She convinces Lily to go upstairs and get rest while she talks to Jack, but after Lily goes upstairs, Carly tries to call Jack, and the phone goes dead. Carly is startled by a knock on the front door, but feels better when she hears Jack's voice. She goes to open it, but someone grabs her from behind, and puts his hands over her mouth to prevent her from screaming."

        "Emily: Excuse me while I shuttle back a few hundred years here. You forbid me to press charges against Rosanna after what that woman did to me, to our family?",
        "Hal: Emily, come on, I just want to get past it, end that chapter of our lives.",
        "Emily: My God, she drugged me, okay? She broke about a dozen laws.",
        "Hal: I remember, Em --",
        "Emily: Well, then remember you're a cop and go find her and arrest her!",
        "Hal: Yes, I am a cop, and I'm also your husband. And as your husband, I'm telling you to end this vendetta before it destroys us both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know Rosanna Cabot has a lot of money -- I was married to her. And I know she has an army of attorneys, and I don't care. [Doorbell rings] I'm getting off the phone now, and you call me back when you have an answer. What is so important that you couldn't just call me from downstairs?!",
        "Rosanna: Hi. May I come in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Okay, you're good to go. Home, that is.",
        "Casey: But the after-party --",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, you just had a concussion. I'm not letting you drive all the way out to the lake.",
        "Casey: But I'm not going to be driving. Josh, Zach, Will and I, we rented a limo, remember?",
        "Margo: That'll be restful.",
        "Tom: Sorry. You know what? These are doctor's orders.",
        "Casey: Doesn't mean you still can't go.",
        "Tom: You know, your mom and I came in separate cars. So she'll drive you home, I can drive Celia to the party.",
        "Celia: You don't have to do that, Mr. Hughes.",
        "Tom: Guess I can't compete with a limo. So you'd rather go with Will and Gwen?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Celia: No. I mean, I could stay with Casey.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Celia: If it's okay with your mom and dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So you're telling me you're pregnant, and Casey's the father?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I didn't plan it this way, believe me.",
        "Will: Well, that's the thing, Gwen, I don't believe you.",
        "Gwen: You think I'm making it up? Forget you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Even Lily is starting to suspect Keith, Jack.",
        "Jack: She told you that she thinks Keith killed Julia and let Les take the fall for it, and then did something to the transport van to get rid of him?",
        "Carly: Well, no -- no, not exactly, but she is bending over backwards trying to convince me that Keith is trustworthy.",
        "Jack: Oh, I see, and in Carly logic, that means she doesn't trust him at all?",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Jack: She's a big girl. Lily can take care of herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Tell Jessica I'll call her in the morning. Thank you. [Lily shrieks] The brakes! [Lily screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I don't know, Celia, you know, the doctor said that Casey has to take it easy the rest of the night, so --",
        "Celia: I understand. It's just that if Casey hadn't gone up on that stage, I would be the one in the hospital.",
        "Casey: Mom, come on. It's prom night.",
        "Tom: Come on, he took a bucket for her.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and we've been planning this for weeks.",
        "Tom: And we'd have 8,000 pounds of leftovers.",
        "Celia: And I'll be really quiet. I just want to make sure Casey's all right.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right. I'm outnumbered. Prom night continues at the house of Tom and Margo Hughes. Okay.",
        "Casey: Awesome.",
        "Celia: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, wait up.",
        "Gwen: Why? So you can tell me what a lying, scheming slut I am?",
        "Will: All right, I've seen the way you look at Casey. You obviously want him.",
        "Gwen: So I'm gonna make this up to get him to dump Celia to be with me? I didn't make this baby all by myself.",
        "Will: If there is one.",
        "Gwen: Feel that, genius? Does that feel like pizza weight to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do you even hear yourself? \"I'm your husband, and you'll do as I say\"? What planet are you from?",
        "Hal: I'm just trying to protect you.",
        "Emily: From what?",
        "Hal: From yourself. Don't you realize that if you -- if you press charges against Rosanna for drugging your tea --",
        "Emily: She could have killed me, Hal!",
        "Hal: And buying little baby dolls to haunt her, you'll be laughed out of court.",
        "Emily: Is that what you're worried about? That people are going to laugh at your wife?",
        "Hal: Best case, yes. Worst case, you'll get your butt thrown back in jail.",
        "Emily: Me? Rosanna's the one who drugged me.",
        "Hal: And in order to prove that, you'll have to admit that you tortured her.",
        "Emily: She admitted to making me do it, Hal.",
        "Hal: Oh, God. Do you hear how crazy this all sounds? Honey, Rosanna is gonna have the best legal minds in the country working overtime for one cause, and that is to make you look like a raving idiot.",
        "Emily: But my husband, the chief of detectives, will defend me, right? Yeah, right. Just like you defended me when this whole thing started.",
        "Hal: There was a lot of evidence.",
        "Emily: I told you I didn't do it. It should have been enough.",
        "Hal: Well, that was then, this is now. And we both have to move past it.",
        "Emily: How am I supposed to move past the fact that my own husband didn't have faith in me, hmm? That the man who swore to love me \"till death do us part,\" was ready to let me rot in jail? How am I supposed to move past the fact that the only man willing to even consider my innocence was the one person who had the most reasons not to?",
        "Hal: Paul.",
        "Emily: Yeah, Paul. You know, if it hadn't been for him, who knows what would have happened to me?",
        "Hal: I'm warning you, Em, for the last time. Walk away from this madness. And walk away from Paul Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You completely misunderstood my relationship to Craig.",
        "Paul: Relationship? Whatever. No, don't. I don't care. You two deserve each other.",
        "Rosanna: If Craig hadn't showed up when he did, I would have lost Cabot to James forever.",
        "Paul: Well, now that your hero's back in town to terrorize my sister into letting him play Daddy, I'm sure you will move heaven and earth to help him. Now, what do you want from me?",
        "Rosanna: Just your patience. I want to fight for you. I want to prove to you that I never stopped loving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Thanks. Sitter said everybody's tucked in. Why don't you pick out a movie, we'll sit in the back of the theater and act like a couple of teenagers.",
        "Carly: In other words, zip it about Lily and Keith.",
        "Jack: I care about Lily as much as you do. But I'm not going to go poking my nose in a case that's already been put to bed.",
        "Carly: Unless you have proof, right?",
        "Jack: What can I say? I'm a cop.",
        "Carly: Okay, what'll it be? Murder and mayhem, or a chick flick?",
        "Jack: Surprise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Hello? I couldn't, I was with a client. Lily can -- canceled? When? But she was so anxious to talk to me.",
        "[Jessica remembering]",
        "Lily: I need to know now, before I make any decisions. That's why I need to look at the report, so I can know, once and for all, that I am right about him. Or that I should just back off and go to the police. And please, don't ask me to go to him and talk to him, because I cannot do that again.",
        "Jessica: Call Lily back. I want to know why her urgent business isn't so urgent anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Truck driver: Ma'am, can you hear me? Oh, thank God. I thought you were a goner. Can you move?",
        "Lily: Oh. What happened?",
        "Truck driver: You lost control of your car.",
        "Lily: Oh. I tried to stop, but the brakes -- the brakes wouldn't work.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Burt: If you came about your car, I gave it the once-over myself. It all checked out.",
        "Lily: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Truck driver: Hey, take it easy. I radioed for the EMTs. They'll be here any minute.",
        "Lily: Would you help me get out, please? Ah!",
        "Truck driver: I don't know, ma'am. Maybe you shouldn't move until the ambulance gets here.",
        "Lily: No, no, I'm fine.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Jessica: And if he finds out you're investigating him? What do you think he'll do then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: If you were really pregnant, you wouldn't be doing that. Okay, so how do I know its Casey's?",
        "Gwen: 'Cause I said so, okay?",
        "Will: Well, that's real evidence.",
        "Gwen: Look, you remember that party at Sally Greco's house?",
        "Will: Mm-hmm. It was pretty crazy. Everybody was doing keg stands.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, including your goody-two-shoes friend, Casey.",
        "Will: And you.",
        "Gwen: Look, I never said I wasn't. Anyway, there were like 17 rooms there or something, and we found one.",
        "Will: Okay, well, you just said you were doing keg stands. So how do you know it was him?",
        "Gwen: I was lit, Will, not wasted. I remember, all right? Look, it was my first time, okay? Wouldn't you remember something like that?",
        "Will: Yeah, but --",
        "Gwen: But what? What? Just 'cause -- just 'cause I don't live in a fancy house and carry little zillion dollar bags around, I'm gonna hook up with every guy that I meet? I'm not like that. Casey's the only guy I've ever been with, I swear.",
        "Will: Okay, so what are you gonna do?",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Will: Well, you're gonna tell Casey, right?",
        "Gwen: It's not like I haven't tried.",
        "Will: Try harder. He's got the right to know.",
        "Gwen: Why, so he can hate me even more?",
        "Margo: Hey, there you are. I knew I'd track you two down.",
        "Will: Hey, so how's Casey?",
        "Margo: Well, he's okay. I guess a bucket upside the head is just what he needed, huh? Listen, he's got to take it kind of easy tonight, so we thought maybe we'd have an after-party at our house. You guys wanna come over? Celia's coming. Well, I mean, unless you have other plans --",
        "Gwen: No. No. I mean, we started out as a foursome, we might as well stay that way, right? Yeah, sure, we'll be there.",
        "Margo: Okay, great, great. So, I guess the perfect ending to a not-so-perfect night. Casey will be really happy you're coming. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Is that what this is about? You're mad because I'm involved with Paul?",
        "Hal: Are you involved with Paul? Don't look at me like that. It's not that it hasn't happened before.",
        "Emily: This needs to stop right now.",
        "Hal: Oh? Why, because I may bring up your thing with Chris Hughes?",
        "Emily: For the last time, there was not a thing.",
        "Hal: Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Yeah -- you stopped just short of sleeping with him. Good girl.",
        "Emily: Why are you doing this? Why are you dragging up ancient history? You just made this big speech about how the past was the past. Why now?",
        "Hal: Because it's happening again!",
        "Emily: Nothing is happening.",
        "Hal: Right under my nose!",
        "Emily: What is happening? Nothing is happening!",
        "Hal: Oh, sure! Paul comes in, you ask me to leave the room so you can be alone with him.",
        "Emily: What's wrong with you? Is it such a big deal that I asked you to go up and deal with my son for five minutes? Why are you so down on Paul? All right. Fine. Put it on the table. What exactly do you think Paul means to me?",
        "Hal: I have been nothing but faithful to you in every way. How come it's not good enough? How come I'm not good enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: A little late for declarations of love, don't you think?",
        "Rosanna: I don't believe that.",
        "Paul: You're wasting your time.",
        "Rosanna: And you don't believe that.",
        "Paul: What I don't believe is that you told me that you hated me. You served me with divorce papers. You threw me out of my own home.",
        "Rosanna: I'm telling you that James forced me to. He insisted that I do it so that you wouldn't find me.",
        "Paul: And now you've shown up in the company of someone that I loathe and expect what from me? What? You want me to just take you into my arms?",
        "Rosanna: Well -- no, of course not. But I can't tell you of how many times I've thought of it.",
        "Paul: From where, James' bed?",
        "Rosanna: No. Never. I never let him touch me.",
        "Paul: Well, there's a reason for me to believe that you're still in love with me. After you stomped on my heart, you didn't sleep with my father. How -- how big of you.",
        "Rosanna: Your father -- your father wanted me to marry him. He wanted to make a family with me and him and Cabot, and I would have done it. I would have done anything to save Cabot, but I couldn't. I couldn't love him, much less make love to him. The only person that I love is you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but that's what turns him on.",
        "Rosanna: Well, not in this case. In this case, it made him hate me. I tried to escape. I tried to get out. I got a hold of the phone, I called Interpol, I couldn't get through. He caught me. He locked me up, he took Cabot away from me, and he told me he had sold me to a work camp.",
        "Paul: A work -- God, Rosanna, come on! When is this fantasy gonna end?",
        "Rosanna: It's not a fantasy, it's true. I know it's outrageous, but it's true. And if Craig hadn't showed up in that club in Bangkok when he --",
        "Paul: So you think Craig showing up in a nightclub in Bangkok is some kind of a coincidence?",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't think it's a coincidence. I think its fate.",
        "[Paul scoffs]",
        "Paul: I don't believe in fate.",
        "Rosanna: Don't you think that fate has -- has played some part when it comes to me and you? When you think about it, you know, we -- when we first met, we both had a claim on this apartment. We both showed up here at the same day, at the same time. What was that if not fate?",
        "Paul: And you think Craig showing up is somehow part of our fate?",
        "Rosanna: Well, look, when you got Craig kicked out of the country, didn't that get the ball rolling? I mean, in a way, you're the one that saved my life. You sent Craig away. He showed up where I was. He helped me save Cabot, and it all brought me back here to you.",
        "Paul: Get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: You're a lucky woman. That airbag saved your life. Stiff neck?",
        "Lily: Yeah, a little bit. That man that brought me in, did he leave his name and address?",
        "Ben: I'm not sure. I can check with the front desk. He seemed pretty anxious to leave. You think he caused your accident?",
        "Lily: No. It was my brakes.",
        "Ben: Yeah, he said you told him they failed.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Ben: When was the last time you had your car serviced?",
        "Lily: Last week. And everything was fine, until --",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Keith: They canceled the test. The bee pollen that you found will match the bee pollen that was found in Sweeney's car, because I planted it there. Now you know the truth.",
        "Ben: Until what?",
        "Lily: I mean, it had to be an accident, right?",
        "Ben: Look, if you suspect that somebody tampered with your car --",
        "Lily: No, no. I don't know.",
        "Ben: You should go to the police.",
        "Lily: No, I can't. I can't yet. I can't do that.",
        "Ben: Lil, are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "Lily: No. I'm a little rattled from the accident. You need to do me a really big favor. Could you give me a phone that I could use? I need to check on my kids. Please?",
        "Ben: I'll see what I can do.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, I've got some bad news. We're a couple of guys short. I'm gonna have to take a rain check.",
        "Carly: Aw, come on, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, honey. I'll be as fast as I can. Instead of going out, we'll just pop in a DVD, okay?",
        "Carly: And make out under our own roof? What a concept. I'll see you later, g-man.",
        "Jack: Okay.",

        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Lily: Carly, it's me. Where are you?",
        "Carly: Hey, Lily, I'm at the police station. Are you all right?",
        "Lily: I can't explain now. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to go to my house, get Faith and Natalie and take them over to Holden at the farm right away.",
        "Carly: What's happening? Where are you?",
        "Lily: Look, I can't get into that right now. I just need you to pick them up, and don't let on that anything is wrong. Just do not let them out of your sight. Please.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, okay, but I want to know why you can't tell me what's going on.",
        "Lily: I'll explain everything later. I'll see you in my house. Just please, do as I ask.",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Ben: Since you're experiencing some disorientation, I'd like to run a couple of tests.",
        "Lily: I understand, but I can't. I can't. I have to leave. I have to go. My kids are waiting.",
        "Ben: No, no, no. Lily, I can't in good conscience release you.",
        "Lily: Look, I have to leave, okay? I take full responsibility, okay?",
        "Ben: You don't even have a car.",
        "Lily: I'll get a cab. Look, I have to go. My kids are more important than anything. I have to get to them. Sorry.",

        "Jessica: Hey, Jack, you got a minute?",
        "Jack: Just one. What's up?",
        "Jessica: I just want you to be aware. I have some real concerns about Lily's involvement with this Keith Morrissey guy.",
        "Jack: So does everybody, but like I tell them, her love life is none of my business.",
        "Jessica: This isn't about her love life. This is much more serious. She suspects Keith could be guilty of murder.",
        "Jack: She told you that?",
        "Jessica: Well, no, not in so many words. But I've been doing this long enough to trust my instincts. And, my instincts are telling me not to ignore it.",
        "Jack: She's got her antennae up. Isn't that what everybody wanted?",
        "Jessica: Except that now her antennae's up, Keith could sense that she doesn't trust him anymore.",
        "Jack: So lay it out for me, Jess. What are you afraid of?",
        "Jessica: I'm afraid of what Keith might do if he finds out she doesn't trust him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lily: Everything that my mother and Holden have been saying is true. This man that I let in my house, into my heart, he's a murderer.",
        "Emily: I am going to make Rosanna Cabot pay for what she did to you whether you like it or not.",
        "Hal: Who are you doing it for? Yourself, or Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Understand I'm just talking to you as Lily's friend here.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm her family, so I'm listening.",
        "Jessica: Lily came to me with questions about Julia's murder.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Jessica: She wants to believe that Keith had nothing to do with it, but still wants to hear the other side.",
        "Jack: Okay, what do you believe?",
        "Jessica: What I believe isn't the issue here. I was hired to defend Les Sweeney. And, from the very beginning, he insisted that somebody was trying to set him up. And as you know, the case against him was circumstantial.",
        "Jack: Right. So you got her to believe that Keith was the one that to kill his sister --",
        "Jessica: No, I didn't actually. She got to that on her own.",
        "Jack: Based on what, Jessica?",

        "Jack: Yeah, and why hasn't she come to me?",
        "Jessica: I told her to do that. She said she couldn't, because if she's wrong about Keith, then her suspicions could end their relationship.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Okay, what do you want me to do?",
        "Jessica: Talk to her. Like you said, you're family. Maybe you can get her to open up. And as a cop, maybe you can determine whether her suspicions have any substance or basis.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and whether or not Keith knows that she suspects him.",
        "Jessica: I'd rather be safe than sorry. Wouldn't you?",

        "Carly: Oh, my God, Lily. What happened to you?",
        "Lily: Where are the kids?",
        "Carly: I took them to the farm, just like you asked me to. What happened?",
        "Lily: I had -- I had an accident.",
        "Carly: What? Oh, God. Are you hurt?",
        "Lily: I'm fine.",
        "Carly: You are not fine. Did you see a doctor?",
        "Lily: The kids -- does anybody know that kids are at the farm?",
        "Carly: No, no. Nobody knows. I left them with Holden.",
        "Lily: Did you say anything to Holden?",
        "Carly: What could I possibly say to Holden? You won't even tell me what's going on.",
        "Lily: Keith -- he had bee pollen.",
        "Carly: He had what?",
        "Lily: He had bee pollen in the drawer at Cal's house. I'm having it analyzed by a lab right now.",
        "Carly: To find out if it's the same stuff that killed Julia? Does Keith know you found it?",
        "Lily: He confessed.",
        "Carly: To the murder?",
        "Lily: No, no. He confessed to planting the bee pollen in Les's car because he was afraid that Jessica would get an acquittal.",
        "Carly: Do you believe him?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to believe. He said he did it to protect J.J.",
        "Carly: Then why didn't he tell you before?",
        "Lily: Because he was trying to protecting me. He knew what he did was illegal. He didn't want to get me involved.",
        "Carly: This guy has an answer for everything, doesn't he?",
        "Lily: I know, I know, this looks bad, believe me.",
        "Carly: Admit it, Lily. You're not sure -- you don't know if Keith is telling the truth, or if he's covering up the fact that he killed Julia and framed Les for it.",
        "Lily: I can't -- I can't believe -- I just can't believe that.",
        "Carly: But you do believe it, don't you? And that's why you're so scared.",
        "Lily: I think someone tampered with my brakes.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Burt checked out my car last week, it was fine. I go to put my foot on the brake, and it doesn't work. It stopped.",
        "Carly: And you think that Keith --",
        "Lily: I don't want to think that way. I don't want to think that, because then I find this bee pollen, I find that he's planted this in Les's car. I call Jessica, I say I want to talk to her about something. Maybe he overhears me. What if he thinks I was going to turn him in?",
        "Carly: Well, then he would do something to stop you, like cut your brake lines.",
        "Lily: Carly -- what if everything my mother and Holden have been saying is true? This man that I let into my house, into my heart, is a murderer.",

        "Emily: Why I'd respond to a man who isn't always pushing me away?",
        "Hal: You had an affair.",
        "Emily: For the last time, it wasn't an affair.",
        "Hal: Okay, you were inappropriately close with your sister's fianc\u00e9. But tell me something -- how is it that that's my fault? Why am I the villain here?",
        "Emily: Why does there have to be a villain?",
        "Hal: What? You're defending what you did?",
        "Emily: You know full well I'm not defending anything. I tried to talk to you about it. I begged you to forgive me. Now, if you couldn't do that, you should have told me so. Because that way, we wouldn't be squaring off now over something that should have dealt with months ago!",
        "Hal: Do you know how full my plate was back then? My best cop and my best friend turned up missing --",
        "Emily: Oh, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Hal: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Emily: Always a crisis -- a crisis with Barbara. A crisis with Will. Crisis at work. Something always keeping you from dealing with me, from dealing with us. God, you know what's funny? I really believed that you had forgiven me. That you understood.",
        "Hal: Understood? Understood what?",
        "Emily: How, I might have felt like an afterthought in my own marriage. But, no, you couldn't understand that. How could you? Because, as usual, you were too busy. Too busy to talk. Too busy to feel the hurt. Well, guess what? Here's the hurt. Here's the jealousy that you shoved down to the bottom, it's bubbling up so you can throw it on me and Paul.",
        "Hal: Em, Em, Emmy. I know I play a part in all this.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you play a big part. You don't trust me.",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "Hal: Do you blame me?! I know that it's months after the fact, but you got in way too deep with Chris Hughes. And that first time, I was blindsided. But I got my eyes wide open now. And do you know what I see, hon? I see a situation where another man is now the most important figure in my wife's life. And how do you -- how do you think that makes me feel? So tell me again, em, how I can trust you? Go on, tell me, huh?",
        "Emily: I guess I'll go stay at my mom's for a while. I'm gonna go get my son.",
        "Hal: No. Leave him be. Let him sleep. Pick him up tomorrow.",
        "Emily: I am so sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.",
        "Hal: I never meant to push you away.",
        "Emily: You may not like what I'm doing, but I'm going to see it through. I'm going to make Rosanna Cabot pay for what she did to me, whether you like it or not.",

Even if I believed your ridiculous story about how you Craig happening to stumble into one another in a casino in Bangkok, tell me something -- explain to me why didn't it didn't even cross your mind to call me? Me, the man that you were supposedly in love with?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm here now, aren't I? There wasn't time. I couldn't call you because James was insane. He was completely unstable. I didn't know what he was thinking, one minute to the next.",
        "Paul: Okay, which one of you dreamed this whole story up? Because the exotic casino thing, that sounds like Craig. The work camp thing, I don't know, that's a toss-up.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: It doesn't make any sense!",
        "Rosanna: It's true!",
        "Paul: My father would give you back your long-lost son, but only if only you drugged Emily? You could drive a truck through the holes in this story, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: But it's true! Paul, it's true. I know it's insane. It's at least terrifying, it was 100% your father.",
        "Paul: But you didn't trust me enough to talk to me!",
        "Rosanna: Don't you think I wanted to? I mean, think about it. Your father, it was like he was reading my mind. Every time I wanted to tell you, he told me that if I trusted you, if I turned to you, that he was going to take Cabot away from me forever. Don't you remember what happened? Before, when you told me that you could protect me and Cabot. You couldn't. You just couldn't. Look, nobody could. I just couldn't let it happen again.",
        "Paul: All right. What do you want from me?",
        "Rosanna: I told you. I just want to love you.",

        "Rosanna: Oh, Emily, I just came to see Paul. I'm so glad you're here. There's so much I have to say to you.",
        "Emily: You know what? Save it. Save it for the courtroom.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: Paul didn't tell you? We're going after you. You're not getting away with what you did to me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's why I have to apologize. I was forced to do it.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's right. James Stenbeck, I heard.",
        "Rosanna: You told her?",
        "Emily: That Cabot's supposedly alive? But no one seems to know where? That James commanded you to drug me, but you have no decent explanation for that? What's wrong? Huh? Paul had to tell someone. I mean, you can only listen to so much insanity before you need a reality check.",
