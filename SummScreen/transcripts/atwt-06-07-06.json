        "Carly: Aww, look at you guys. You're all dressed up! This is for me?",
        "J.J.: Well, we would do anything for you.",
        "Carly: You, sir, are quite a charmer. Now, I wonder how long this is going to last? A day? Maybe two?",
        "Jack: Nah, they missed you a lot. Three days at least.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Hey, girl. How's my girl? So how was last night?",
        "Parker: Excellent.",
        "J.J.: All guy night on TV.",

        "J.J.: Yeah! Then everything will be perfect.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, it will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why are you so surprised I want you to stay away from Jen and Johnny?",
        "Lucy: I think you're overreacting.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: Stay away.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry if Jen was upset about the vaccination. I apologized for being so eager.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's a great mother. That's why her child's so healthy. He's in perfect shape. All you gotta do is look at his records.",
        "Lucy: I know. I have. Jen's obviously done a great job.",
        "Dusty: Then why are you trying to make her look like an unfit mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Weber: Will? Will Munson! Will Munson, stop!",
        "Casey: What's wrong?",
        "Mr. Weber: What are you doing with that gown?",
        "Will: Nothing. I just --",
        "Mr. Weber: Will Munson, you are to leave these premises immediately! You have been expelled for cheating and you are not welcome here.",
        "Tom: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Casey: I don't know.",
        "Gwen: Hey, who do you think you are, saying something like that in front of the whole school?",
        "Mr. Weber: I'm very sorry this has to be so public, but it's been very difficult to get Will's attention.",
        "Gwen: No, he worked his butt off ever since we came back to this school.",
        "Will: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: He earned every single one of those grades --",
        "Will: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: No, you should be giving him a prize, not calling him out. What's wrong with you?",
        "Mr. Weber: Let's not make more of a scene here.",
        "Gwen: Wait, what was it?",
        "Will: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: Huh? Some stupid kid? Some kid who doesn't like Will, thinks its real funny? Huh? We're easy targets, aren't we?",
        "Will: Gwen, stop!",
        "Gwen: No, you have to fight back. You can't let him lie about you, not like this. It's too big --",
        "Will: It's true! Gwen, I cheated. On my Biology paper. And the Calculus test. So it's all true. I can't graduate with you.",
        "Mr. Weber: I suggest you two take this someplace else. We have to get started soon.",
        "Margo: Hey, hey. Did you have anything to do with this?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Tom: Cheating is serious business.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know! I know. Dad, I didn't know.",
        "Barbara: Where did you learn that it was acceptable under any conditions to publicly humiliate anyone like that?",
        "Mr. Weber: My apologies for the bullhorn. But I told Will earlier this morning that he was expelled and could not graduate. Then I see him with a cap and gown, getting in line with the others.",
        "Barbara: Mr. Weber, obviously there is a terrible misunderstanding here. Now, there is still time for you to correct your mistake.",
        "Mr. Weber: My mistake?",
        "Barbara: Yes. I know that my son did not cheat.",
        "Mr. Weber: Did you hear his confession?",
        "Barbara: He is obviously covering for someone. Now, let him go through with the ceremonies, and then we can resolve this issue later.",
        "Mr. Weber: I already investigated. And I was both surprised and disappointed that Will would resort to something like this. But there are other students here today who deserve to graduate. We need to give them their ceremony. I'm sorry.",
        "Barbara: Do you have any idea how much financial support my family and friends and I have given this school?",
        "Jennifer: Mom. Mom --",
        "Mr. Weber: Diplomas from Oakdale Latin are not for sale, Ms. Ryan. I know this must be a shock, and I'll be available to process it with you, but right now, there is other business to attend to. If you'd like to talk further, we can make an appointment tomorrow.",
        "Barbara: \"He's available to process it?\" What kind of psychobabble is that?",
        "Jennifer: Mom.",
        "Barbara: I will have that man's head on a platter. Right next to his damn bullhorn.",
        "Gwen: Will, I don't understand --",
        "Jennifer: Mom, Mom, Mom -- let Will talk to Gwen --",
        "Barbara: Honey, I will take care of the principal --",
        "Will: Mom, stay out of this right now.",
        "Barbara: But you've got to tell me everything that happened. Let me help you, Will!",
        "Will: I need to talk to Gwen right now.",
        "Kim: Barbara, honey, come on. Come on, darling.",
        "Bob: Will, we'll be here.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, me, too, okay?",
        "Gwen: You did it. You cheated. I don't understand -- how do you cheat on a paper?",
        "Will: I bought it.",
        "Gwen: You -- what, like at the mall? You can buy a Biology paper?",
        "Will: I bought it online.",
        "Gwen: Did you buy the test answers, too?",
        "Will: Does it matter? I got them.",
        "Gwen: How? Will, I don't understand. You had help. Maddie was helping, I thought she was a good tutor. She seemed to know everything. She would've helped you. Wait, did she do this?",
        "Will: No. No, Maddie would never.",
        "Gwen: No, neither would you. You wouldn't even be able to think of something like this on your own, you couldn't.",
        "Will: You don't know that.",
        "Gwen: Who did this come from? [Gwen remembering] That little witch. Hey. Hey, it was you, right? You got Will into this? You're the reason he can't graduate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Now, don't you guys put your dad on the spot. You had all guy TV. And I bet he made you pancakes for breakfast.",
        "Jack: Yes, I did.",
        "Carly: Well, you see, I think we're spoiling these children, Jack. We ought to take them home, immediately, and put them to work.",
        "Parker: No!",
        "J.J.: No way!",
        "Jack: That is a very good idea.",
        "Carly: Yes. There's no reason why you shouldn't be sweeping the porch.",
        "Jack: Or cleaning slimy leaves out of the gutters.",
        "Carly: Right. Oh, look at you, he actually thinks that's a good idea.",
        "Parker: But we're all dressed up.",
        "Carly: Yes, you are. I see that. Is that all for me?",
        "Jack: Sort of.",
        "Carly: Or did somebody look at the calendar in the kitchen?",
        "Jack: Somebody looked at the calendar in the kitchen.",
        "Carly: Well, then you know that Gwen is graduating today. And she has worked so hard. And we are going to be there.",
        "Jack: Should you be on that leg, honey?",
        "Carly: Well, a little won't hurt.",
        "Jack: I know, but Carly, just don't push it.",
        "Carly: Jack -- this is big. This is huge. We have to be there, right, guys?",
        "Parker: It's going to be boring, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's going to really boring. But afterwards, we'll get pizza.",
        "J.J.: Sweet!",
        "Carly: Pepperoni. I still have sonar hearing. All right, so I guess we have to go home first. All right?",
        "Jack: No, that'll make us late.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, I have to get dressed. I need something to wear.",
        "Jack: What'd you have in mind?",
        "Carly: Not this! You know, a dress, something simple, something pretty.",
        "Jack: You think this will do?",
        "Carly: You didn't. Oh, Jack, you thought of everything. I'm so glad you're back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Wow. You know, I am not trying to make Jennifer look unfit. Why on earth would I want to do that?",
        "Dusty: Well, you shouldn't even be Johnny's doctor anyway. How'd you work that out?",
        "Lucy: Work what?",
        "Dusty: It's so obvious, isn't it?",
        "Lucy: But, what are you talking about?",
        "Dusty: I'm talking about you come coming back to Oakdale and finding yourself in the middle of Johnny's life, in the same week that Jen and I are filing for adoption to make him my son.",
        "Lucy: I didn't know any of that.",
        "Dusty: Big coincidence, huh?",
        "Lucy: I guess.",
        "Dusty: Tell your father next time to send someone less cute, and more effective.",
        "Lucy: What has gotten into you? You know better than that! Dusty, it's me. I don't sneak around. Have you completely forgotten who I am?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, just about. 'Cause I don't know where you've been. But I do know this -- you're definitely your father's little girl.",
        "Lucy: You think I came back to Oakdale to be my father's spy. Why?",
        "Dusty: To take Johnny. But I'll tell you something -- you and your father need to know that I'll never, ever let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly?",
        "Carly: Hmm?",
        "Jack: We really shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I just wanted to thank you for -- for everything.",
        "Jack: You know, maybe you shouldn't try to go to this graduation.",
        "Carly: I'm fine, Jack. You've made everything okay. You do that.",
        "Jack: You really look like you should go home and get some rest.",
        "Carly: No, I can't miss this. It's too important to Gwen.",
        "Jack: She'll understand, though. I'll take the kids. You know, that way she'll feel like she has a piece of you there, you know? So come on, just go home and rest, no big --",
        "Carly: I'm fine, really.",
        "Parker: Are you okay, Mom?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sweetie, I just need to get dressed and -- oh, we need a present. We definitely have to have a present for Gwen, right? What -- what is that? Who are you smiling at? Oh -- oh, sweets!",
        "J.J.: Uh oh. Don't cry.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: All right, I won't. I'll try not to.",
        "Parker: It's just a pretend present.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we stopped by the gift shop and we got a little frame. That's all, and the kids signed a card.",
        "Carly: Well, I think that is a wonderful present. So, Jack, if you want to give us a ride over --",
        "Jack: No!",
        "Carly: I'm sure that we could get a ride back.",
        "Jack: I'll drive. I'm going to the ceremony. I want to.",
        "Parker: Can we go?",
        "Carly: Yeah. [In goofy voice] Yes, we can go. Just let me get dressed, okay?",
        "Jack: All right, guys, come on, out. Vamanos, let's go. Here we go. Yes, we got it. Um, guys, here. Take your sister real quick, okay?",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: When did this happen?",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Lucy: When did you get so paranoid?",
        "Dusty: I know what your father did. I know what your father and Paul Ryan did. They stood by and watched as Jennifer lost her mind. They knew where her child was.",
        "Lucy: I heard. And it's horrible. That's why I don't even speak to my father anymore.",
        "Dusty: You're the perfect weapon.",
        "Lucy: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: All you gotta do is jot down a few notes in Johnny's chart and make it look like things aren't quite right at home, whatever. Whatever it takes to get your father to court.",
        "Lucy: That would never happen.",
        "Dusty: He already signed a petition.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Dusty: He filed the petition to block the adoption.",
        "Lucy: That --",
        "Dusty: You know!",
        "Lucy: That's ridiculous. He doesn't have a leg to stand on.",
        "Dusty: Unless you give him one. By making Jennifer look incompetent. Or me.",
        "Lucy: What does that mean?",
        "Dusty: It means, it's easy to point the finger at a guy like me.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, come on.",
        "Dusty: Over a rigged fight, kid. You were willing to throw me out of your life.",
        "Lucy: Just stop it! I don't want to hurt you or Jennifer or anybody! That's not me! I came to Oakdale to finish my internship. To spend time with my grandmother. That's it.",
        "Dusty: You were always willing to give your father another chance. You were the only one who thought he was worth it.",
        "Lucy: Your fianc\u00e9e is the one who slept with him and had his baby. So maybe I'm not the only one. I -- can't believe I just said that.",
        "Dusty: No, that's cool. That's okay.",
        "Lucy: How did this get so ugly?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause your father is so screwed up. He wants to take Johnny away from me and Jennifer.",
        "Lucy: This isn't about Jennifer or the baby. You're mad at me. You're still upset that I left Oakdale -- that I left you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey. It was your idea to buy the Biology paper, wasn't it? You got Will expelled.",
        "Jade: Get your hands off of me.",
        "Casey: This is why you hated Jade, she was a part of it.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Did you know the whole time?",
        "Maddie: No. No, I figured it out later, and I went right to Will and I tried to stop him, but he just wanted to get out of here. And he said it wouldn't even matter by tomorrow because they'd be off to college or whatever. And, I mean, I thought that he was right. What was I supposed to do? I didn't want to blow everything for him.",
        "Casey: No, it's fine. It was a no-win deal.",
        "Maddie: I mean, he didn't want to get left behind. But I didn't want him to lose Gwen.",
        "Casey: He looks like a zombie. Man --",
        "Margo: Hey, we're gonna take our seats. You should get in line, okay?",
        "Casey: But Will --",
        "Margo: He has been embarrassed enough, he really doesn't need a bunch of people standing around staring at him.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Margo: He's got his sister here if he needs anyone.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, let's just -- let's go.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Jennifer: Will doesn't want us here.",
        "Barbara: Will is not okay!",
        "Jennifer: Okay, Aunt Kim and Uncle Bob, you guys are gonna stay, right?",
        "Kim: Absolutely, we're here for Casey. Jennifer is right. We'll keep our eye on Will. At the moment, there's really nothing you can do except love him and let him handle it.",
        "Barbara: I don't believe you. My son is in a crisis, and you want me to stand back and do nothing? I can't do that.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, Mom, we're gonna go. Okay? We have to talk to Dad about this, you should talk to him and make some sort of plan.",
        "Barbara: Finally, someone who makes sense. Honey, whatever you need, okay?",
        "Will: Mom, I'm okay. Just go.",
        "Barbara: When she's through with you, it'll be my turn.",
        "Gwen: You were about to tell me where you bought the Biology paper.",
        "Jade: I'm not telling you anything.",
        "Gwen: Hey. What do you get out of it?",
        "Jade: Nothing.",
        "Gwen: I defended you. I'm the one who said, \"Give her a chance. I know what it's like being on your own.\" I'm an idiot. And you're not the same. You're a total user. You deserve to be exactly where you are.",
        "Will: I know you want to blame someone else, but it was me. I'm the only one to blame.",
        "Gwen: Why? Why would you do this?",
        "Will: For you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: If you were in trouble, why didn't you come to me?",
        "Dusty: I just wanted to tell her not to try anything with Craig.",
        "Jennifer: What'd she say?",
        "Luke: And you're still in love with Dusty?",
        "Carly: You have made me so happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You're a smart guy. Did you need more study time? Was the pressure too much?",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Gwen: You guess? Will, I need an answer.",
        "Will: It was a lot of things. It was school, it was my job, it was staying with Dad.",
        "Maddie: You might want to give them a minute.",
        "Gwen: And mostly being at your dad's? You could have told me?",
        "Will: I did.",
        "Gwen: But then in the next breath, you said that it was okay.",
        "Will: I wanted it to be.",
        "Gwen: Will, this was it. This was our whole life. And you said that you got that, you understood that it was just a few months that we had to suck it up.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know.",
        "Gwen: And focus.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Gwen: If we would have had to pay rent and work full time and go to school, we never would have made it. I've done it before, it's too much.",
        "Will: I know, and I didn't want you to have to go through that again.",
        "Gwen: So you let yourself drown? You had help, Will. I mean, not just from Maddie or tutors or whatever. You had me.",
        "Will: Had?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I was right there. If you were in trouble, why didn't you come to me?",
        "Will: Come tell you that I was a failure, when you're happier than anybody to see me getting good grades?",
        "Gwen: No, happy for you. I was already happy just being with you.",
        "Will: Yeah, for how long?",
        "Gwen: Oh, man, forever, Will. It didn't have to happen like this.",
        "Casey: Gwen, it's time.",
        "Gwen: I'm not coming.",
        "Will: Go, you deserve it.",
        "Gwen: I'm not -- I'm not finished here.",
        "Casey: You can talk to him later, right? All right.",
        "Will: Go, please, because the only thing that could make this day any worse is if you miss out because of me. So go graduate with everybody. You've earned it.",

        "Luke: Um, this is for Damian Grimaldi. I don't know his room number, I'm sorry.",
        "Desk clerk: We'll make sure he gets it.",
        "Luke: Thanks. Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Jade: It's a public place.",
        "Luke: That my mom co-owns.",
        "Jade: I didn't know that.",
        "Luke: Somehow I doubt that.",
        "Jade: Look, I'm just walking through the lobby, that's all. What did you think I came to do, rob the place?",
        "Luke: No, I just think you're looking for an easy mark.",
        "Jade: Do we have to do this every single time we see each other? I'm just walking through the lobby, that's all.",
        "Luke: Whatever.",
        "Jade: What's up with you?",
        "Luke: I was leaving a note for my father.",
        "Jade: Holden's staying here?",
        "Luke: No, Damian? My biological father? He's back in town.",
        "Jade: Oh, so, is that a good thing that he's here, or --",
        "Luke: Jade, why do you even care?",
        "Jade: I care about you, Luke. I know that you don't believe me, but I do. And really, all I ever wanted was a family.",
        "Luke: Well, it's a hell of a way to get one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I have no regrets. You went to school like you should've.",
