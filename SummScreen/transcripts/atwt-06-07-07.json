        "Lance: So, I'm guessing you might not want to share the latest entry on your resume, am I right?",
        "Alison: What's he talking about?",
        "Emily: I have no idea.",
        "Lance: Oh, yeah you do. So what's it going to be, Emily? Are you going to wish us well?",

        "Lance: We're going to Vegas, Baby.",
        "Alison: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Lance: Why? Because big sis doesn't approve?",
        "Alison: Because I'm done with all that, Lance. You want me to make movies, you want me to do drugs, knock yourself out. But I want something better for my life.",
        "Lance: You hear that? She thinks you're better than me. That's a laugh, isn't it?",
        "Emily: Alison, let's go.",
        "Alison: You know what? No hard feelings, but lose my number.",
        "Lance: So that's it? Bye-bye, Lance? Hello, Oakdale?",
        "Alison: I like it here.",
        "Lance: There's not much call for what you have to offer. Or maybe there is. What do you think, Emily? Could you hook her up?",
        "Emily: Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Lance: Maybe you guy could work as a team. Like a sister act. I think the men would really like that.",
        "Emily: Alison, please --",
        "Alison: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Emily: Come on. He doesn't know what he's talking about, all right. Let's go. We'll stop and see Mom.",
        "Lance: You can run but you can't hide, Em. Sooner or later, she's going to find what you really are. A high-priced whore.",

        "Kim: Can I have a word, please?",
        "Katie: Sure. Is something wrong?",
        "Kim: Um, there's been a complaint. It's the sort of thing I don't normally respond to. However, the allegation is that you were on the premises last night after hours and that you were -- how shall I put this? Um, the gist of it was that you were behaving unprofessionally and I think the word immoral was warped into it somewhere. I don't care. Don't make a judge of that.",
        "Katie: No one was never here!",
        "Kim: No one? You did that all by yourself?",
        "Katie: Well, I was here and Jack was here --",

        "Jack: The door was wide open.",
        "Carly: Yeah, it does that.",
        "Jack: You mean it doesn't shut itself and lock itself?",
        "Carly: Well, it used to just close. But now you sort of have to jiggle it. Excuse me. Jack, why are you here so early?",
        "Jack: It's after noon, Carly. We had an appointment.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, so I slept in. So what? I'm sorry. I forgot that you were coming over. I need some coffee, would you like some?",
        "Jack: No, thank you.",
        "Carly: Good. Okay. Refresh my memory -- why are you here?",
        "Jack: You asked me to come over so we could discuss visitation. Listen, if this is you making a case for letting the kids sleep over, you're doing a hell of a job. You all right in there?",
        "Carly: Fine, fine.",
        "Jack: What's my chair doing out on the porch?",
        "Carly: I'm redecorating.",

        "Carly: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: Well, I never thought you'd go down that road again.",
        "Carly: I'm not going down a road, Jack. I just ran into him at Yo's and he followed me home to make sure I was okay.",
        "Jack: And so you just, you downed a six-pack?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. And then he went home -- not that it's any of your business.",
        "Jack: You just can't stay away from the bad boys, can you, Carly? No matter what's at stake.",
        "Carly: What do you mean, what's at stake? He's your brother, Jack. He's the kids' uncle.",
        "Jack: So you just pick him up at Yo's and bring him home.",
        "Carly: Nothing happened!",
        "Jack: Do you even remember what happened?",
        "Carly: Why do you care?",
        "Jack: Carly, this is not what I want our kids to wake up to -- you passed out on the couch, beer bottles all over the floor, the door wide open.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'll fix the damn door, Jack.",
        "Jack: And that'll do it.",
        "Carly: Why do I bother?",
        "Jack: This is you bothering? Getting hammered at Yo's and picking up my brother? And don't tell me that Brad was acting as an uncle, okay. He was after what he's always after.",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't care what he was after.",
        "Jack: You don't care about anything but yourself.",

        "J.J.: Parker's picking fights as usual.",
        "Parker: You started it.",
        "J.J.: What is your problem? Now that Mom's back, things could be a lot better for us. You just have to ruin everything.",
        "Parker: Okay, how did I ruin anything? Mom's the one who ruined it.",
        "J.J.: Mom came back because she loves us. And she's sorry she left. She was trying to make it up to us last night. But you had to be a jerk and you had to ruin it for everybody.",
        "Faith: Wait, your mom's back?",
        "J.J.: Yeah.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and now we're supposed to all live happily ever after.",
        "J.J.: Well it could happen if you weren't such a pain.",
        "Parker: Okay, this family is never going back to the way it was. So get used to it.",
        "J.J.: See, this is what I'm talking about, Faith. He won't even give it a chance.",
        "Faith: Do you think he's mad at me?",
        "J.J.: He's mad at everybody.",
        "Faith: Maybe I should go talk to him.",
        "J.J.: He's probably halfway down the pond by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: Not your fault. J.J., he thinks he can plant this magic plant and everything will go back to the way it was. And no matter what I say to him, he won't hear it. And the truth is that our parents are divorced and this family's over.",
        "Faith: You're going to kill it.",
        "Parker: Wouldn't that be too bad. Look, he's got to stop trying to get me to believe that everything's going to be fine. Because it's not now and it's never going to be.",
        "Faith: I feel the same way.",
        "Parker: You do?",

        "Kim: Thanks, Dear.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "P.A.: Hi.",
        "Katie: Kim, excuse me. I would really, really like to know who lodged that complaint.",
        "Kim: Honey, I told you, whoever it was wanted to remain anonymous.",
        "Katie: Anonymous. I know, you said. But obviously they work here.",
        "Kim: Obviously that is the reason they wanted to be discreet. Which actually, is something that you should have thought of before you offered to give your date \"A tour\" of the studio.",
        "Brad: What was that about?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: Kim. She looked stern and serious. Something happen?",
        "Katie: No, nothing happened.",
        "Brad: Okay, well whatever you say. You want some coffee?",
        "Katie: I just had some, thanks.",
        "Brad: What's wrong? Come on, what's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing. Nothing's wrong.",
        "Brad: Sorry, you just seem -- I don't know. Forget about it.",
        "Katie: What? I seem --",
        "Brad: You seem on edge. What? You and Jack get into a fight last night? I warned you. Now that Carly's back --",
        "Katie: Jack and I are fine. We're better than fine. Actually, we're great.",
        "Brad: Yeah, that would explain the dark circles.",
        "Katie: What dark circles? I don't have dark circles.",
        "Brad: Well tell that to makeup. You know, just a little hint? You want to work on camera? You might want to think twice about these marathon sessions that you have with my brother and get a little sleep.",
        "Katie: What marathon sessions?",
        "Brad: Hey, I didn't say a word.",
        "Katie: But you did, didn't you? You're the one who complained!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What did you just say?",
        "Lance: Oh, sorry. It's not really my area. Maybe I'm not up on the lingo. What is it? A hooker? A call girl? A pro? What do you like to be called, Emily?",
        "Alison: Emily's not a hooker. What, are you crazy?",
        "Emily: Let's go. Okay, let's go. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Alison, let's go!",
        "Lance: You know, I've got nothing against working girls. I like a good whore.",
        "Alison: I'm not listening to this. Come on, Emily. I'm sorry my ex couldn't take no for --",
        "Emily: Let's just go. Let's go!",
        "Lance: Her friend Cheri said she had quite a following. Now that's quite something to be proud of, really. To have your pimp say that you're her top money-maker.",
        "Alison: Her what?",
        "Lance: Again, I'm not up on the terminology. What is it? Her boss? Her agent? Her madam?",
        "Alison: So you're saying this woman told you that my sister --",
        "Lance: Was her top earner.",
        "Alison: Who is this Cheri? Give me her number.",
        "Lance: Be my guest. Emily, I think you have the number, right? Why don't they have a little talk?",
        "Alison: Don't pay attention to him. I'll take care of this.",
        "Emily: What are you doing? Who're you calling?",
        "Alison: Dusty. He told me to call him if --",
        "Emily: No, you can't.",
        "Alison: Look, he'd want to know.",
        "Emily: Alison, you need to leave Dusty out of this.",
        "Alison: He would be the first person to defend you.",
        "Emily: Not this time. He can't defend me.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Emily: What Lance is saying --?",
        "Alison: Is garbage. Isn't it?",
        "Alison: Lance is lying. He has to be.",
        "Emily: No, he's not. Alison, there was a period of time, a very -- a very short period of time, I worked as a -- prostitute. But it's over. It's all over now.",
        "Alison: Wait a minute. You run a newspaper. You're an editor. You --",
        "Lance: They call that trash a newspaper? That's a stretch.",
        "Alison: Shut up! Just get out of here.",
        "Lance: You know, fine. I'm going. But my cell phone is on. And the offer's still open. I've got a ticket to Vegas should you change your mind.",
        "Alison: Tell me it isn't true. Emily, tell me it isn't true.",
        "Emily: I wish I could.",
        "Alison: You're a prostitute?",
        "Emily: No. No, I was. It's over.",
        "Alison: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Emily: Well it's not the kind of thing you just tell someone, Alison. You had just come home. You were coming off of a major drug addiction.",
        "Alison: I don't understand. You have a good job. You make money --",
        "Emily: It wasn't about -- it wasn't about money.",
        "Alison: Then why?",
        "Emily: Oh God, it's complicated. It's so complicated, Honey. I let a guy pick me up, here. We went up to his room and uh -- after he left, I found $1000 on the night stand. He -- he thought I was a -- anyway, I was stunned. In a weird way, I was flattered. It felt good. It felt good to be desired. So when he asked if he could give my name to a friend, I said, why not? When I think about it now, it seems like a dream. But it happened. It all really happened.",
        "Alison: How long did this go on?",
        "Emily: Just a few weeks. I swear to you. And then one night, a john -- asked if I could watch a movie with him. A porno.",
        "Alison: You saw me.",
        "Emily: I saw you. It was awful, Alison. I was stunned. I was so scared for you. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I quit that night and I started looking for you.",
        "Alison: So looking for me -- that was all about you.",
        "Emily: No. No.",
        "Alison: You got nervous. And you were just afraid your clients would connect us.",
        "Emily: No, Honey. That's not what it was about. I swear to you. Honey, after my baby died, I felt nothing. I hadn't felt -- my God, I was dead inside. And maybe that was part of it. I don't know. My God, I don't -- maybe I was out there testing myself, trying to make myself feel something. And I felt something all right. When I saw you in that video, I felt ashamed. I was horrified.",
        "Alison: If you were so ashamed of me, you should've left me alone.",
        "Emily: Honey, I was ashamed of myself, I wasn't ashamed of you. I knew I had to get out there and find you and bring you home and help you get your life back on track.",
        "Alison: Does Mom know about this?",
        "Emily: No. God no. Mom doesn't know. Dusty's the only one who knows.",
        "Alison: So that's the secret he can't forgive you for.",
        "Emily: I don't want to talk about Dusty, okay? It's not important. He's been a friend and he's been a big help. But all that matters is you.",
        "Alison: If you really cared about me, you would have been honest. But you lied to me.",
        "Emily: See, I knew this would happen. I was afraid of this. I knew that you'd push me away because you didn't respect me. That's why I didn't want to tell you.",
        "Alison: That's a crock. You didn't want to tell me because you don't want Mom to know. You were just protecting your secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You were spying on Jack and me? That's sick.",
        "Brad: You know, for your information, I spent a nice evening at Yo's in the company of a very sexy lady. Ask Carly if you don't believe me.",
        "Katie: You were with Carly?",
        "Brad: Yeah. We had a great time.",
        "Katie: I bet you did. Cause she would love nothing more than to team up with you against me and Jack to drive us crazy.",
        "Brad: Well, I thought that Jack was over Carly. Unless, I don't know, something changed. And if I was the one that tattled on you, and that's a very big if, it would've been for your own good.",
        "Katie: Please.",
        "Brad: Seriously. Seriously. Jack, he's a decorated detective at the Oakdale police station, you're a television star. You both have reputations to uphold.",
        "Katie: Yeah, a reputation that you would be only so happy to destroy!",
        "Kim: Okay, okay. We're going to shoot the promo for the bake-off contest. You ready?",
        "Brad: Kim, I was born ready. In case you wondering, you know, how you're looking -- that butt busting is really paying off. Now that is tasty. Hey, when do we get to sample some of these babies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: You see, the trouble is, you can never forget what happened. So you're going to worry when they fight. Is it over? What's going to happen? So, even though everything's okay, they're not the same, you're not the same. It's just not the same.",
        "Parker: Yeah. You see, that's one of the things that I like about you. You understand what I'm saying. J.J. -- J.J. doesn't get it.",
        "Faith: He's still hoping.",
        "Parker: Exactly.",
        "Faith: So you like me?",
        "Parker: Sure, why not?",
        "Faith: Well, I like you.",
        "Parker: What do you mean?",
        "Faith: What do you mean?",
        "Parker: I asked you first.",
        "Faith: Well, if you like me and I like you then -- I guess that means we're going out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker's lost faith, Carly. It didn't start with you. Losing his sister -- I don't think any of us realized how hard that hit him, Jennifer dying. And then losing Hal not so, not so soon afterwards. It's just -- so when you left --",
        "Carly: I proved that he can't trust anybody.",
        "Jack: Yeah. But we talk. He's got this therapist that he seems to like. Or at least tolerate. He's got his friends. He talks to Emma. Or Emma talks to him rather. But he's only going to let you in so close.",
        "Carly: How's he doing in school?",
        "Jack: When he goes? C's. Couple D's. He's failing history.",
        "Carly: He was on the honor roll when I left.",
        "Jack: Yeah, not too big on his list this semester.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm so sorry that I left you with all of this. And I know that it doesn't make it up to you, but I'm back. And I'm not going anywhere and I'm going to do whatever it is I have to do to help him. How are J.J. and Sage? They seem okay?",
        "Jack: According to Parker's therapist, because Parker's holding all the anger. When they see him acting out, they kind of go in the other direction. Maybe too far in the other direction. But yeah, their grades are consistent. They're good. J.J. can't stop talking about this baseball team as you know. And Sage, she's in the school play.",
        "Carly: Yeah, she told me.",
        "Jack: She really likes stuff like that. Being dressed up, carrying on.",
        "Carly: Yeah, she's like me in that, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah, she is.",
        "Carly: J.J. seemed happy to see me. I know that it was pretty chaotic. You know for Parker's sake -- and for Sage and J.J. too, you know I was thinking that, there might be something that you could do to help.",
        "Jack: Yeah, say the word.",
        "Carly: I'm glad you feel that way.",
        "Jack: Listen, I would do anything to get through to Parker.",
        "Carly: Good. Then do me a favor, Jack. Keep Katie away from him.",
        "Jack: I should have known not to give you the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Carly: No, no. I'm not saying that you should shut Katie out forever. And I'm certainly not saying that you should stop seeing her.",
        "Jack: Big of you.",
        "Carly: Jack, you're taking this all wrong. All I'm saying is that until the kids get used to me being home -- this is confusing. First they see me, and then they see her. It's a lot of pressure.",
        "Jack: The only one feeling pressure here, Carly, is you. You see Katie with the kids, they're happy. And that just reminds you of what you've lost, what you threw away. Katie was there for them when they needed a mother and you were nowhere to be found. She provided costumes, she was their cheering section. She's their friend, Carly. They trust her. And the last thing they need is for her to be yanked out of their lives just because someone they can't trust, and can't depend on is jealous. Get used to it. Katie's sticking around. Whether you like it or not.",

        "Brad: What did you do that for?",
        "Kim: Well isn't that just ducky? That pie was a prop we were going to use in promo.",
        "Katie: Kim, I'm sorry.",
        "Kim: And we don't have a replacement.",
        "Katie: I'll buy a new one.",
        "Kim: Yes, you will. You can give your money to Georgia, and you can run down, perhaps to the bakery in old town.",
        "Katie: No, I'll buy it. I smushed the pie.",
        "Brad: You smushed me.",
        "Katie: If only.",
        "Kim: You two, run your lines. Please.",
        "Katie: Wait, Kim. If I don't go now, the pie will be the least of his problems.",
        "Kim: Looks like she finally figured out who lodged that complaint.",

        "Parker: Look, what I said before -- you're about the only person that I can talk to. Except for Paul. But he's never around anymore. And I like you, I really do. But as a friend. The last thing that I need right now is a girlfriend.",
        "Faith: Gotcha!",
        "Parker: What do you mean?",
        "Faith: I was just kidding. I don't want to date anybody.",
        "Parker: You don't?",
        "Faith: It's stupid. Anyway, I'm supposed to go to this movie with my dad later. You want to come?",
        "Parker: Actually, I have to clean out the barn for Aunt Emma. I promised her.",
        "Faith: Lucky you.",
        "Parker: Anyway, I should get going.",
        "Faith: Yeah, I think I should start getting ready.",

        "Emily: Do I want Mom to find out what I did? No, of course not. Neither do you.",
        "Alison: So you thought you'd just polish up your halo just in case she found out? Bring home poor Alison to prove to Mom that you learned your lesson --",
        "Emily: Alison, that had nothing to do with it.",
        "Alison: You just admitted you didn't want Mom to know.",
        "Emily: Of course I didn't want Mom to know. She lives here, this is her home. She's a doctor. This would be the worst kind of embarrassment.",
        "Alison: Maybe you should have thought about that before you started turning tricks. At least I was in Vegas, Emily. Not right in front of Mom's face!",
        "Emily: Well, your video didn't stay in Vegas, did it, Alison? I saw it. I recognized you. It's only a matter of time before Mom gets a copy on her doorstep.",
        "Alison: When she finds out, I'm going to tell her all about you.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine. You do what you have to do.",
        "Alison: That's right.",
        "Emily: But it'll be a lot easier for Mom to take if you're sober and you're working.",
        "Alison: Don't worry, I'll be working.",
        "Emily: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Alison: I'm going back to Vegas. I'm going to be a star.",
        "Emily: Alison, just let me -- if you want me out of your life, fine. I will stay out of your life. But please, I'm begging you to stay. Please, do not go back there. You go back to Vegas and you'll be back on meth tonight. You'll be having sex with a stranger on camera tomorrow. Please. You want that? Just stay here, okay. You want to quit your job at the diner, fine. Quit your stupid job. I'll get you a job at the Intruder or the hospital. You want to move out of the house, I'll get you your own apartment, Alison. You can go back to school, whatever you want. I am begging you. Please, stay.",
        "Alison: So now you're bribing me? You must be really desperate.",
        "Emily: I am. You have no idea. I've been to the edge. I've done what you've done.",
        "Alison: I'm not a prostitute.",
        "Emily: You don't get paid for having sex?",
        "Alison: I get paid to perform. I'm an actor.",
        "Emily: Oh, you're an actor? So it's all simulated? That's not really you up there? It's not your body up there with some stranger putting his hands all over you?",
        "Alison: I have to go.",
        "Emily: Don't you remember what it was like getting off of meth? You want to go through that again?",
        "Alison: Who says I have to go back on meth?",
        "Emily: Can you perform without it, Alison? Can you?",
        "Alison: You're not my keeper, Emily. And you're not any better than me.",
        "Emily: Oh God, no. I know I'm not. I am no saint. But I have suffered. You have no idea how I've suffered. I'm trying to keep you from doing the same thing.",
        "Alison: That's just it, I'm not the suffering type. I'm not like you. I don't dwell on every little thing. I don't have to analyze every little thing. I just do what I have to do and then I get over it. So you know what? You don't have to approve of my life. That's fine. But when I'm in Vegas, I'm doing what I want and I'm having fun and I'm making a lot of money. And people liked me there. They weren't judging me about everything I did. So you stay here and you try to be perfect. But I'm going back to where I belong.",
        "Emily: You don't belong there and you know it.",
        "Alison: Just give me time.",

        "Parker: 20 minutes. What does it matter?",
        "Carly: So we have some time to talk then.",
        "Parker: I'm sorry, I can't. I promised a bunch of friends that I'd hook up with them. Um, Morgan!",

        "Jack: I'm sorry. Where is this coming from?",
        "Brad: You and Katie had your own private bake-off last night. And Kim found out and she's pretty mad. In fact, Katie's job could be on the line thanks to you.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Brad: You know, I think they call it -- what as cops that you call it a moving violation? Not that I don't understand. I mean, I personally, I like whipped cream. But this is a place of business, Jack, it's not your bedroom.",
        "Jack: How'd you find out?",
        "Brad: Oh, found out that you and Katie had sex right here on the set?",
        "Jack: Would you quiet down, please?",
        "Brad: This is television, Jack. It's our job to know. You know what surprises me the most, Jack? Is that you showed so little restraint, and so little respect for the woman that you claim to care about.",
        "Jack: Okay, you through?",
        "Brad: No, I'm not through. Cause you compromised my co-star, you embarrassed her and you put her --",

        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. I saw Jack earlier, and we discussed visitation for the kids.",
        "Katie: Oh yeah. That's something you should clear with him, not me.",
        "Carly: Absolutely. I know. I just -- there's something that I wanted to come clean with you about. We were talking about Parker, about the kids, how hard it was for them when I was gone. And how hard it's been for them since I've been back.",
        "Katie: Well, you couldn't have thought it'd be easy.",
        "Carly: No. That's true. I guess there was a part of me that was hoping that they were so happy to see me that we would race through all the hard parts and just get back to the way things were.",
        "Katie: The way things were?",
        "Carly: Well with me and the kids -- not with me and Jack. They're angry. And they're confused. And I suggested to him that he might ask you to keep your distance.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Carly: Right. I just, I meant just for a little while.",
        "Katie: I hope he told you where to get off.",
        "Carly: He did. He did and he was right. I shouldn't have suggested it. I just -- I don't know what to do. Anyway, we'll work it out. I just wanted you to hear it from me. I wanted you to know that I'm sorry, that I messed up.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. And I want to call a truce. Because Jack pointed out that you have been spending a lot of time with my kids, that they trust you and he suggested that I should be grateful to you for stepping in.",

        "Emily: Which is exactly why I need to go find her.",
        "Susan: No. You're not going to go anywhere until you talk me. Because he said you knew. That I should talk to you. He said you were turning tricks at the Lakeview. Now why would he say such a terrible thing?",
