    "Recap": [
        "Lily is set to pour out her feelings to Holden, but she is stunned when she walks in on a strangely emotional conversation between Molly and Holden; she is told that he just asked her to marry him, as Lily excuses herself quickly after offering her congratulations. Holden claims he wants to marry Molly for the right reasons, but Molly thinks he just wants to make sure he doesn't have to testify against her; she has to think about this because she doesn't think it is right to get married for that reason in her mind; she needs to go talk with Carly. Dusty admits to Janet that he is struggling with handling Johnny's day to day care while Craig still has legal guardianship, which is causing an issue for Johnny going swimming and needing permission the next day. Janet goes to see Craig to appeal to him about Dusty's situation and doing the right thing for Johnny, as Craig finally hears her pleas. Dusty later comes to talk with Craig about the same thing and is surprised to hear Craig already agreed \u0096 thanks to Janet. Carly breaks evidence and Jack is in disbelief; he can't believe the lengths she will go and how she justifies her behavior; he sees that Craig is right \u0096 they are toxic together. Carly firmly believes she has to protect Parker at all costs, but Jack thinks she pushes things too far. Later, they talk and Carly and Jack are at an impasse regarding whom they are while Jack doesn't think it is possible for them to work and so he leaves. Molly visits Carly and tells her that she killed Silas right before Holden asked her to marry him. Carly is stunned to hear her story, but thinks Holden is doing everything in his power to protect her, so she discounts Molly's belief that it isn't a good way to start a marriage. Carly lends Molly her support. Holden goes to Jack for help for Molly with the Silas situation. Jack is shocked to learn the details, but he agrees to talk with the Sheriff and give him some background on Silas. Jack asks for the timeline, and Holden omits some information. Janet goes to have an ultrasound expecting to be with Jack. Dusty shows up and offers his support, as they learn the baby is healthy and they bond over her helping him with Craig and his being there for her during the appointment since Jack was not able. Lily bemoans her situation to Lucinda about Holden, as Lucinda pushes her further at Holden because of what she learned that night about Molly killing Silas. Lily is in disbelief, but she thinks that will bond Holden and Molly together further, as he protects her. She wants Lucinda to leave because her suggestions and advice are just hurting her. Craig yearns for his family with Johnny and Gabriel. Jack wants to call Carly but instead takes a drink from his beer sadly. Carly wants to hear from Jack, but decides not to push him and goes to bed alone. Lily, hugging a photo of her and Holden, wishes things were different with she and Holden. Holden worries and waits for Molly to come home; when she does, she tells him softly that her answer is yes, as they kiss."

        "Lily: I can't fight it anymore, Holden. I still love you. I want our old life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Marry me, Molly. I'll keep you safe. I'll protect you. All right. That's probably the sheriff. They're probably gonna ask some more questions. Just let me do all the talking, okay?",
        "Molly: What if they ask me point-blank --",
        "Holden: Stick to the story. It was self-defense, right? Molly.",
        "Molly: Okay.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: Holden, I know it's late, and I'm probably a fool to show up like this, but I have to tell you how I -- Molly, I thought that --",
        "Holden: Molly's assignment was a bust, so she came home early.",
        "Lily: All that footage, and you couldn't use anything? Am I interrupting something?",
        "Molly: No.",
        "Holden: Actually, I just asked Molly to marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Dusty: I'm Johnny's father, as well. No, not officially, but -- he's living with me right now. Doesn't -- you know what? Never mind.",
        "Janet: Is there a problem with Johnny?",
        "Dusty: Well, his play group's going to the community pool tomorrow for swimming lessons.",
        "Janet: That's great. They've got a new water slide. He must be beside himself.",
        "Dusty: Well, he is. Now I got to tell him he can't go, at least not in the water.",
        "Janet: Why not?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause they need signed consent from his legal guardian. I'm not legal. Craig won't make me legal.",
        "Janet: Not even temporarily? What if, uh -- what if -- what if Tom and Margo talk to him about it?",
        "Dusty: I already tried that. You know what Craig said? \"No way.\"",
        "Janet: What is wrong with that man?",
        "Dusty: He's in denial. He thinks he's gonna be free soon.",
        "Janet: Is that a possibility?",
        "Dusty: Not from what I hear. I hear he's gonna do some serious time, and Johnny's gonna suffer for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey! Guard, I asked you for water a while ago.",
        "[Guard laughs]",
        "Craig: Tell you what, how would you like a nice, cushy job in private security? I know people. Lieutenant Hughes is my sister, you know.",
        "Guard: Eh, she's really pulled strings for you, huh?",
        "Craig: I also know Detective Snyder, who's due back here any minute with an eta on my release.",
        "Guard: Nope. Zero visitors scheduled.",
        "Craig: Jack always was slow to get the message. Kids learn faster. Hey, you know, I, uh -- I need to call my son.",
        "Guard: The one who put you in here?",
        "Craig: No, the 5-year-old. The one who needs me. Just let me make the damn call so he can hear my voice, and he knows I'm okay. You know what? I'm gonna remember this when I get out, and trust me, I will get out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I cannot believe you just did that.",
        "Carly: It slipped.",
        "Jack: You think this is funny, Carly? That glass angel was state's evidence in an arson, assault, and attempted murder investigation.",
        "Carly: What can I say, Jack? Accidents happen.",
        "Jack: Don't give me that. You knowingly just broke the law, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't care. The only thing I care about is protecting my son.",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea the position you just put me in, coming here with the sole purpose of destroying evidence?",
        "Carly: What are you gonna do to me? Are you gonna toss me in the cell with Craig? Or maybe we can wait, and I can share one with Parker.",
        "Cop: Jack, what happened?",
        "Jack: I'm an idiot. Carly gave me the glass angel, and I meant to put it back in the evidence box, but it slipped out of my hand. Can you get me a broom? Thanks.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Don't thank me.",
        "Carly: No. What I -- what I said before, I shouldn't have. I should have known that you would always look out for me, for Parker. You always have.",
        "Jack: Stop. Just please stop.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: I can't do this anymore.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. You know, I know it went a little far, but I was worried about Parker. You have to understand that.",
        "Jack: I have to understand?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'm looking out for him, Jack. That's what mothers do. That's what fathers do. We should be on the same side here.",
        "Jack: You're just proving him right.",
        "Carly: Who?",
        "Jack: Craig. When he said -- forget it.",
        "Carly: No. No, I want to hear it. I want to hear what pearls of wisdom fell from Craig's mouth. I can't wait.",
        "Jack: He said you're toxic.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] This from the man who stole our son's future and then burned down my business to cover it up.",
        "Jack: But he's wrong.",
        "Carly: Of course he is.",
        "Jack: Because the truth of the matter is, Carly, you're not the one who's toxic. It's us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I should be giving you the TLC.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, you can do me next, okay?",
        "Dusty: It wouldn't be enough. I want to do more for you, and for Johnny, and for -- just a little to the right.",
        "Janet: And for?",
        "Dusty: Nothing. It's not important.",
        "Janet: No, come on. Yes, it is. It is to me.",
        "Dusty: For the baby. I want to be there for you and the baby, you know?",
        "Janet: Dusty, you do so much for me. Don't ever doubt that.",
        "Dusty: Not just now. When the baby's born. I want to be there for the diapers, the feedings, little league, ballet.",
        "Janet: Well, hopefully you will be there. You will be there for that and so much more.",
        "Dusty: As Uncle Dusty, step-daddy Dusty.",
        "Janet: I had no idea it bothered you this much.",
        "Dusty: Nah, it doesn't bother me. I'm just in a bad mood, that's all. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: Don't apologize for the way you feel.",
        "Dusty: You don't need anything else to worry about. I'm sorry I said anything. I mean it. Turn around. Let me rub your shoulders.",
        "Janet: No, I got to go. I have a sonogram appointment.",
        "Dusty: Okay. I'll drive you.",
        "Janet: Nah, that's okay.",
        "Dusty: Am I pushing?",
        "Janet: No, no, no. It's -- it's not that. It's just, I have to make a stop first, and, Jack's meeting me at the hospital.",
        "Dusty: Enough said.",
        "Janet: But I promise I will call you afterwards and fill you in on all of the details, okay?",
        "Dusty: I need to visit a prisoner. Craig Montgomery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What, what? 20 lashes for mouthing off to you earlier? Is that camera on? I want this recorded!",
        "Guard: Put a lid on it. You have a visitor, after all.",
        "Craig: Oh, finally! Someone decided that I don't belong here. Well, who is it? My lawyer? It's got to be somebody with good news. Ms. Ciccone. What a pleasure to see you.",
        "Janet: Don't count on it, Craig. I'm here to make sure you do the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: This probably seems a little sudden to you.",
        "Lily: What does it matter? You didn't propose to me.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but, in a way, it does affect you.",
        "Lily: When you came by earlier for dinner, you didn't say anything about --",
        "Holden: I didn't know that I was going to propose then.",
        "Lily: Did something happen between then and now?",
        "Molly: It's not what you think, Lily.",
        "Lily: I take it you didn't expect this, either.",
        "Molly: No, I -- I didn't.",
        "Holden: I've been wanting to ask Molly to marry me for a long time, and then, tonight, it just -- just hit me.",
        "Molly: Yeah. What can I say? This night's been full of surprises.",
        "Lily: It certainly has. Well, I wish you both happiness, and I know Faith is gonna be thrilled. I mean, she likes you so much, Molly.",
        "Molly: Look, that's really sweet of you to say, but --",
        "Lily: I mean it, I mean it. And I promise you, I won't say anything. I'll let you break the news to her.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Lily: I'll just take off now so you two can celebrate.",
        "Holden: Lily, wait. You obviously came out here for a reason.",
        "Lily: I -- I just wanted a recipe from Emma. It can wait. Congratulations.",
        "Molly: You should go after her.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Molly: She's obviously upset.",
        "Holden: Lily's fine. It's you I'm worried about.",
        "Molly: I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Holden: Molly, I just asked you to marry me, and I'm still waiting for an answer.",
        "Molly: I know.",
        "Holden: So what's it gonna be?",
        "Molly: If you need that answer tonight, I'm so sorry. The answer's no.",
        "Holden: You don't want to marry me?",
        "Molly: That's not it, and it's not that I don't love you. I love you so much. I do, and I would love to be your wife.",
        "Holden: Then say yes.",
        "Molly: Would you have asked me to marry you tonight if I hadn't shot and killed Silas?",
        "Holden: Molly --",
        "Molly: No, you wouldn't have, and we both know it.",
        "Holden: Oh, you're a mind reader now?",
        "Molly: No. I'm freaking out here, and so are you, and I just don't think that's a good time to be making plans for the rest of our lives.",
        "Holden: Molly, listen to me. Everything I said to Lily was true. I've been wanting to marry you for a very long time.",
        "Molly: But the only reason that you proposed to me tonight is because you are desperate to protect me, and you feel guilty. I mean, you said it. You already said yourself that you feel like it's your fault that I wound up going to see Silas alone.",
        "Holden: Well, it is, isn't it? I've been spending so much time at Lily's, with the kids, that I neglected you. You didn't feel like I was there for you. That's why you wanted to go handle Silas on your own.",
        "Molly: Okay, but maybe when it started, I felt that way, yeah, but tonight? Tonight is on me, and what happened, that is not a reason to marry somebody.",
        "Holden: Molly, I want to marry you because I love you.",
        "Molly: Oh, God. Or because if, for some reason, I go on trial, as my husband, you can't be forced to testify against me.",
        "Holden: Why are you doing this?",
        "Molly: Because I messed up, not you! Nobody forced me to go see him tonight. Nobody.",
        "Holden: He did. He forced you.",
        "Molly: No. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I must have know that something was -- that's why I brought the gun with me.",
        "Holden: I don't believe that. There's no way you could have known that he was gonna be high on something, that he was gonna force himself on you.",
        "Molly: I knew he was sick. I knew he was dangerous. After all these years and everything I think I've learned, I still keep screwing up!",
        "Holden: It was self-defense.",
        "Molly: No, it wasn't! It wasn't! Silas was gonna plaster the tapes of me and him all over the internet. He was gonna make our lives a living hell, and I -- if Abigail and your mother saw those tapes --",
        "Holden: Molly.",
        "Molly: I saw a way to get rid of him, Holden, and I took it. I pulled the trigger, and I have to face those consequences, and I'm not about to take you down with me.",
        "Holden: Molly, you're right. Tonight is the reason that I proposed to you, but it's not the reason that you think.",
        "Molly: What other reason could there be? Why would you want to spend the rest of your life with me?",
        "Holden: When -- when I got here and when I held you in my arms, it just hit me. I knew it. I knew it right then and there that I really loved you, and that I didn't ever want to lose you, and I know you feel the same way about me.",
        "Molly: Yes, I do. Yes.",
        "Holden: Well, then marry me, and everything that's happened, we'll face it together. We'll face it together for the rest of our lives.",
        "Molly: I, um, can't make any decisions right now, Holden.",
        "Holden: I understand. You need time.",
        "Molly: Maybe if I go see Carly.",
        "Holden: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Molly: She knows me better than anybody, except you.",
        "Holden: What are you gonna say to her?",
        "Molly: I don't know. I just need to talk to her.",
        "Holden: Okay. I'm gonna drive you over there, though. You can't do it, not in the condition you're in. I need to get rid of these tapes first. Gonna put them someplace where nobody can find them. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hey! Hi, Honey. Here, here, here, here, here. I'm one step ahead of you. In more ways than one. I have news that is an answer to our prayers.",
        "Lily: I'm not in the mood, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Aren't you curious? Don't you want to know what I have to tell you?",
        "Lily: No, because I'm never listening to you again.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you've hurt my feelings.",
        "Lily: Because when I do, it just gets me into trouble. \"Go to Holden, Pussycat! Tell him how much you love him!\"",
        "Lucinda: It's still a bang-up idea, Darling. Even more so now.",
        "Lily: It's too late. I did it already. I just came from the farm.",
        "Lucinda: And?",
        "Lily: To say it didn't go well is a major understatement.",
        "Lucinda: Oh?",
        "Lily: Holden proposed to Molly tonight.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. What -- what is the man thinking?",
        "Lily: He's in love with her. That's what he's thinking.",
        "Lucinda: Golly. This is -- this is nothing that I was expecting.",
        "Lily: Yeah, that makes two of us.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. But if I think, it's natural. It's the way he would function, when he reacts to the kind of news that he's had.",
        "Lily: Reacted? What -- what are you talking about?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, I had a call this evening from one of my old stringers. Congressman Silas Whitman was shot and killed at the Old Mill restaurant outside of town.",
        "Lily: Silas Whitman?",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Lily: He's the congressman that Molly had the affair with. He tried to kill her. No wonder she was on edge.",
        "Lucinda: But I don't think she was grieving.",
        "Lily: Who was the shooter?",
        "Lucinda: I know, and so do you. You know very well.",
        "Lily: Who?",
        "Lucinda: Well, who was perhaps not acting like a lady in love swept off her feet, but more like a damsel in distress?",
        "Lily: Not Molly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: How much do you love your son?",
        "Craig: Johnny? He's my whole life. Next question.",
        "Janet: Why don't you act like it?",
        "Craig: Excuse me?",
        "Janet: You heard me.",
        "Craig: Oh. Dusty sent you. This is about the swimming lessons, isn't it?",
        "Janet: Dusty has no idea that I am here. I want you to explain to me this situation. Just -- just make me understand. Why is it that you don't want Johnny to have fun with the other kids?",
        "Craig: I want Johnny to have fun with the other kids and go swimming and have a great time, but I want to be the one to sign the release form. And the camp has an issue with that, given my present accommodations.",
        "Janet: Why is that so important?",
        "Craig: Because they're a bunch of small-minded morons who don't --",
        "Janet: No. That's -- that's not what I meant. I meant, why is it so important that you sign the papers? Why can't Dusty sign them?",
        "Craig: I am the boy's father.",
        "Janet: Do you really want to ostracize Johnny because you can't swallow your pride?",
        "Craig: What do you want me to do?",
        "Janet: I would like you to grant temporary guardianship to Dusty so that he can sign those papers and take care of those things, just while you're in here, and then, when you get out, you can rescind it. What's wrong with that?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Janet: What? Craig, what is wrong with you? Why not?",
        "Craig: Look at me. Look where I am. I've had everything stripped away. I don't want Johnny taken away, too.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no. It's not about taking him away. It's about taking care of him, which is something that you -- you can't do for him while you're here. You can't be there for Johnny right now, and Dusty can be.",
        "Craig: Yeah, gloating every step of the way, I'm sure.",
        "Janet: Craig, it's not a contest. You've already hurt Gabriel. You don't want to hurt Johnny, too.",
        "Craig: Well, you don't pull any punches, do you?",
        "Janet: Dusty and I tell Johnny every day how much you love him and miss him. He's not gonna forget about you, Craig.",
        "Craig: What did Dusty Donovan ever do to deserve you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you gonna come in?",
        "Jack: Do you want me to?",
        "Carly: Not if you're gonna call me anymore terrible names.",
        "Jack: Carly, I never said you were toxic. I said we were.",
        "Carly: Well, if that's true, then we can fix it together, right? Jack, look at me. I did what I felt I had to do.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and that's the problem, Carly. You always do.",
        "Carly: I get it. Same old, same old. You hold yourself up to this ridiculously high standard, and you expect everybody else to rise up with you, but some of us are mere mortals, Jack. Some of us happen to have flaws.",
        "Jack: I never said I didn't have flaws.",
        "Carly: I have seen the world from the bottom of a bottle, and I have had to learn to accept myself and all of my mistakes, past, present, and future.",
        "Jack: I know all that.",
        "Carly: And you know something? I'm okay with it. I'm okay with who I am. But you're not, are you? And you haven't forgiven me.",
        "Jack: I have forgiven you plenty, Carly.",
        "Carly: Have you? For everything I've put you through over the years? For making Parker cover for me when I was drinking? I see. It's true. And if you don't forgive me -- I'm a mess, and you love me, Jack. It probably makes you love me even more, and if you could just hold onto that, you would make our lives so much easier. I love you as you are. I accept you as you are.",
        "Jack: That is not true at all. You -- you want to change me, too, Carly, into the guy you just described, someone who will accept everything you do without question, and I'm sorry. This is not a fair expectation. I can't be that person for you.",
        "Carly: Well, if that's true, then where do we go from here? If neither of us is willing to give at all to make the other happy, then -- oh, I see. You didn't come back here with me to try to work this out. You came here to say good-bye.",
        "Jack: I thought when we got back together this time that things would be different. I mean, yeah, we'd still have the same issues and differences of opinion, but nothing would happen that would be so extreme that we couldn't see the other person's point of view and move through it. What you did tonight when you broke that piece of evidence, it's almost -- I don't know. It's as if you shattered any last hope I had for us, Carly.",
        "Carly: Don't say that.",
        "Jack: And now I know -- I know that things are never gonna change, because it's not about what either of us do. It's about who we are.",
        "Carly: There are worse things than loving someone so much you're willing to go through anything for them. We love each other, Jack. That's all that matters.",
        "Jack: I've got to go to the station, and then I've got to meet Janet at the hospital for a sonogram.",
        "Carly: Will I see you later? Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Guard, I said I'm ready to go back to my cell! Guard! Are you deaf?",
        "Dusty: I got a better question. Why are you so willing to hurt your kid?",
        "Craig: Let's go.",
        "Dusty: How long are you gonna make Johnny pay for your mistakes? The kid's dying to go swimming tomorrow.",
        "Craig: If he gets in my way again, it's assault.",
        "Dusty: I'm telling you your kid's in pain. Are you gonna listen?",
        "Craig: I don't have to. It's a done deal. Tomorrow, Johnny will go swimming with all the other rug rats, and you will be his legal guardian until I get out of here, which will be a lot sooner than you think.",
        "Dusty: What made you change your mind?",
        "Craig: Ask your better half!",

        "Nurse: The doctor will see you now.",
        "Janet: Oh, great, thanks. Could you just give me a few minutes? The father really wants to be here for the sonogram. I'm just gonna check and make sure he's on his way right now. Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I was in the neighborhood.",
        "Nurse: Whenever you're ready.",

        "Dusty: Did I miss something?",
        "Janet: She thinks you're the father.",
        "Dusty: Well, you got a hand that needs holding? I have one that fits perfectly. Did I tell you how amazing you are?",
        "Janet: What brought that on?",
        "Dusty: I can't tell you you're amazing?",
        "Janet: I -- you know, I really feel like I've been taking advantage of you.",
        "Dusty: You're not, but I can tell that you're uneasy. So let's go to plan \"A.\" I'll call you later, okay?",
        "Janet: Okay. Dusty. I think my hand needs a little holding, after all.",

        "Lucinda: We have a light at the end of the tunnel.",
        "Lily: You can't possibly be seeing this as an opportunity for me to get back with Holden.",
        "Lucinda: That's exactly what I see.",
        "Lily: He just proposed to Molly!",
        "Lucinda: Well, that was out of pity. He doesn't want to marry that -- that -- that tramp. He doesn't love her. You're his love. He loves you.",
        "Lily: His feelings seem genuine to me.",
        "Lucinda: He's worried about her. He's a good guy, you know. But sympathy is fleeting. Love endures, see? Absolutely nothing has changed.",
        "Lily: I doubt that's true. But even if it were, what do you suggest I do about this?",
        "Lucinda: I think you should go back to the farm, and you should tell him how you feel about him, that you love him and you want him, so he has a choice, and I guarantee you, he'll choose you.",

        "Jack: Okay. That's that. I'm out of here.",
        "Holden: Jack, I need to talk to you.",
        "Jack: Oh, can it wait? Janet's sonogram's right now, and --",
        "Holden: Molly shot and killed Silas Whitman tonight.",
        "Jack: She what?",
        "Holden: Yeah, it happened outside of town at the Old Mill restaurant. I gave Sheriff Dooley my statement, but I wanted you to hear it from me first.",
        "Jack: Hold on a second. You gave him your statement? Were you involved in this?",
        "Holden: Not in the shooting. I got there after it happened.",
        "Jack: Okay, start at the beginning, okay? Come here, please.",
        "Holden: Silas got out of prison. He was stalking Molly. At first, it was just annoying, but then it got pretty ugly.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why didn't you guys come to me? I could have got Molly a restraining order.",
        "Holden: Because we thought we had it under control. Then, he contacted her tonight, and Molly agreed to meet him at the Old Mill. She was gonna tell him to just leave her alone, to leave town.",
        "Jack: You went out there with her?",
        "Holden: No. She didn't tell me where she was going. I was at Lily's. You know how headstrong she can be.",
        "Jack: Runs in the family.",
        "Holden: But when she got there, she went into the Old Mill, and the place was empty. Silas locked the doors, and she couldn't get out. The guy, he was high on something, got pretty violent. Tried to force himself on her.",
        "Jack: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: It was self-defense, jack. You know the guy was bad news.",
        "Jack: Well, you don't have to tell me. I was driving the car he cut the brake lines on. So, Molly's okay?",
        "Holden: Well, she's pretty shaken up, but he didn't --",
        "Jack: Well, that's good. That's really good. So, you told Dooley all this?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Then that's that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I hope so.",
        "Jack: Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Holden: Well, you know what this thing can turn into. Some overzealous prosecutor could see it as an opportunity to make a name for himself. The media could get a hold of it, try and make up a bunch of stories. I don't want that to happen. I want it to go away, Jack. Now.",

        "Carly: You have no idea how good your timing is.",
        "Molly: I take it you haven't had your TV on tonight?",
        "Carly: No. No, I haven't. It would have been a good distraction, though. I've had a terrible night.",
        "Molly: Me, too.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I can see that. What's up?",
        "Molly: I don't even know where to begin.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, while you think about that, I'll start, okay? Everything with Jack and me was going really well earlier today. I mean, really well. And then -- well, let's just say I found something out that could mean trouble for Parker with the whole Monte Carlo investigation, so I did what I had to do to protect my kid, you know, and then Jack went ballistic. Mol?",
        "Molly: Sorry. \"Jack went ballistic.\"",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Forget about that. It's your turn. Pour your heart out, okay?",
        "Molly: Holden asked me to marry him.",
        "Carly: Could you -- could you say that again?",
        "Molly: Holden asked me --",
        "Carly: No, I heard what you said! That's fantastic! I'm so happy for you! Did he give you a ring? I got -- Molly, what on earth is wrong?",
        "Molly: Everything.",
        "Carly: Well, you said yes, didn't you? You didn't? Why? Why didn't you say yes?",
        "Molly: Because it's the worst possible timing.",
        "Carly: You love Holden. You've loved him all your life. You've been waiting to marry him for I don't know how long. The guy asked you to marry him, and you say no? Why?",
        "Molly: I couldn't say yes to Holden's proposal because -- I killed a man tonight.",

        "Dusty: Janet and the father would like to learn the sex of the child at the same time, together. Could you put that in her file for us?",
        "Doctor: Of course.",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: For what?",
        "Janet: Come on. I know this is awkward for you.",
        "Dusty: It's not about me. It's about you and the baby.",
        "Janet: And the baby's all right!",
        "Dusty: More than all right. The baby's perfect.",
        "Janet: Healthy, healthy. That is all I care about.",
        "Dusty: I owe you a thank you. I heard you paid a visit to Craig.",
        "Janet: Oh. Are you mad?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm not mad. I'm thrilled. I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.",
        "Janet: So, what are you saying? Did Craig come through?",
        "Dusty: I have guardianship of Johnny for as long as Craig's in the slammer.",
        "Janet: Oh!",
        "Dusty: How'd you talk him into it?",
        "Janet: I just appealed to his better nature.",
        "Dusty: Come on. How'd you do it? [Whispering]",
        "Janet: Money. I'm just kidding. No, really. Come on. You're not the only one who knows how to help people out, Mister, all right?",

        "Carly: Well, why wouldn't they? It's -- it's the truth, isn't it?",
        "Molly: Carly, if I tell you something, do you promise me that you won't breathe a word of it to Jack?",
        "Carly: That's just what we fought about earlier, but yes, of course. I promise.",
        "Molly: No, no, no. Forget it. I don't want to make things any worse for you guys.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Things couldn't possibly get worse. Really, I swear. I won't tell anybody.",
        "Molly: Okay. Things didn't go down exactly the way I told the police they did. Silas, he left the room for a minute at one point, and I was able to call Holden, and I told him where I was and what was happening and that I was in trouble.",
        "Carly: That's why he left Lily's so fast.",
        "Molly: He came, and he kicked the door down, and he saw Silas attacking me. He was on top of me. So Holden went after him, and he knocked him out cold. And then Holden went out to his car so that he could call the sheriff, and that's when Silas came to.",
        "Carly: And then it -- it happened like you said it happened, right? He came after you, and -- and you feared for your life.",
        "Molly: No, he didn't come after me. Not physically, anyway. He came after me with words. He said horrible things to me. He taunted me, how I was a whore, and I'd always be a whore, and how he was gonna destroy me and Holden and our families, and I lost it. I lost it, and I pulled the trigger.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. Oh, God, Molly!",
        "Molly: It wasn't self-defense, Carly.",
        "Carly: Now, yes, it was! Now, yes, it was! Maybe not the -- the legal kind, but it was, and if I was there, I would have shot him for you! You know I would have! I swear I would have!",
        "Molly: Honey, you never would have let it go as far as I did.",
        "Carly: Okay. You've done the right thing. Was it Holden who -- who came up with the story for the sheriff? Okay. Well, you just -- you stick with that, and you marry him so that he won't have to testify against you. You do everything that Holden tells you to do.",
        "Molly: That's not the right way to start off a marriage.",
        "Carly: It's a fantastic way to start off a marriage. Look at this. He's proving that he's gonna move heaven and earth to take care of you. What could be better than that?",
        "Molly: What if Silas is right? What if I don't deserve Holden's love?",
        "Carly: You do. When it comes to relationships, there's not a lot that I'm sure of right now, but I do know that.",
        "Molly: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Holden, what are you asking me to do?",
        "Holden: Molly needs all the help she can get.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but Old Mill, that's in LaSalle county. That's not my jurisdiction.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you know Dooley, right?",
        "Jack: He's a good guy, yeah.",
        "Holden: So talk to him. Let him know the background on Silas, that he rigged Molly's brakes in New York, that he was a dangerous guy.",
        "Jack: I can do that.",
        "Holden: That he got out of prison for attempted murder on a technicality, leaving him with a score to settle.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Holden: And then, when he came after Molly, she wasn't just afraid of being raped. She was afraid for her life. In the moment, it was either him or her. Dooley needs to understand that.",
        "Jack: He will. I'll make sure of it. Okay. Just, for me, I just want to get the timeline straight. So, the cops called you and told you what happened?",
        "Holden: No. Molly called me.",
        "Jack: Molly called you after the cops arrived on the scene and questioned her.",
        "Holden: While Silas held her hostage, she had a moment where she was able to make a call. She did, but then Silas grabbed the phone, and he broke it.",
        "Jack: Why didn't she call 911?",
        "Holden: I don't know, Jack. She wasn't thinking straight. I left Lily's, and when I got there, Silas was dead. Molly had just shot him.",
        "Jack: So, then it was you who called it in with your phone? 'Cause Molly's was already broken.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Jack: And Silas had been dead how long at that point?",
        "Holden: I don't know, Jack. A couple of minutes. It's hard to say. Do we need to talk about all the details right now?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get a picture in my head. That's all.",
        "Holden: The picture's pretty easy. Silas Whitman tried to kill Molly once before, and he was going to do it again. He ruined her life, and the last couple of months, she was trying to build herself back up.",
        "Jack: I get it.",
        "Holden: She's not gonna be able to do that if this story gets out, Jack. So, what I need from you is to just try and minimize all the damage.",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "Holden: Could you do that?",
        "Jack: Yes, I will. You have my word.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen. Tell, uh -- tell Molly I'm glad she's okay, and she's lucky to have a guy like you in her corner.",
        "Holden: I will.",
