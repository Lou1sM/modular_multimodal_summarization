        "Emily: That guy Ali is with -- is nobody. I don't know. He doesn't even know me.",
        "Susan: Then why did he say you were turning tricks? Why would he say that if he didn't know you?",
        "Emily: Mother, it's not important, okay? I need to find Alison.",
        "Susan: Hey -- he didn't force her to go. She was packed, she was ready to go. Now, you tell me what's going on here! What aren't you telling?",
        "Emily: Don't -- I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Susan: I think you do.",
        "Emily: I don't know.",
        "Susan: I think back to all those times you came home so late -- and you came home all beaten up at that night -- you weren't working on a story about prostitution. You were the story!",
        "Emily: That's -- that's crazy. That's crazy --",
        "Susan: When I think back to all those times, I couldn't explain your odd behavior, your odd clothes, your odd hours -- you were just lying to me, weren't you? You were having sex for money. Look at me, Emily. Tell me it's not true.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry --",
        "Susan: You're sorry? That doesn't explain it! How could you do that? How could that happen to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Are you sure this is the driver that took Lance Barton to the airport?",
        "Desk clerk: Positive. We use that car service all the time.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Driver: Dial-a-ride car 78.",
        "Dusty: Hey, this is Lance Barton's business partner. I'm wondering if he made his flight to Vegas.",
        "Driver: Barely because we had to make an extra stop.",
        "Dusty: Why is that?",
        "Driver: Had to pick up his girlfriend's suitcase.",
        "Dusty: His girlfriend.",
        "Driver: I can see why he didn't want to leave a hot blonde like her behind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: You have a headache?",
        "Carly: Oh, J.J.",
        "J.J.: Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Are you sick?",
        "Carly: No, no, I'm fine. Does your dad know you're here?",
        "J.J.: Well, I was next door at Joey Lebo's house and your car pulled up.",
        "Carly: Oh, it's so good to see you, Sweetheart. Oh, I miss you so much.",
        "J.J.: Me, too.",
        "Carly: What? Is something wrong?",
        "J.J.: Kind of.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "J.J.: Well, when you came back, we were all afraid you were going to have to go to jail and everything. And it was great when you didn't have to. But I -- I just wish that --",
        "Carly: What?",
        "J.J.: I wish that we could just all visit you as much as we want.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm sorry it's not the simple.",
        "J.J.: Yeah, all because of Parker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Morgan: Why don't you hang out for a little while? We can go check out those new phones at the video store. You know, the ones that download like a zillion ring-tones.",
        "Parker: Yeah, my aunt's probably wondering where I am.",
        "Morgan: She can wait a few minutes, can't she?",
        "Parker: Not really.",
        "Morgan: Faith told me you take care of the horses at your aunt's farm.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and the chickens and the cows and whatever else.",
        "Morgan: I love horses. Maybe I can come over sometime and help?",
        "Parker: Sure. That's fine.",
        "Morgan: Walking towards Washington Street?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Morgan: I have to go that way to meet my mom. I'll walk with you.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Why do you care what Carly does?",
        "Jack: Who says I care?",
        "Brad: The way you're jumping down my throat says you care. I had a few drinks with your ex-wife, so what?",
        "Jack: This is about the kids. That's the only reason I'm concerned about you bothering Carly.",
        "Brad: I live with your kids every day and I haven't managed to corrupt them yet. I think you're just using them as an excuse.",
        "Jack: An excuse? For what?",
        "Brad: You're jealous. You're jealous that Carly and I were together last night.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: You've got to be kidding me. This is not about jealousy, this is about knowing you're no good for her.",
        "Brad: You mean, I'm not good enough for her?",
        "Jack: After everything she's been through with Simon Frasier, you are the last person that she needs in her life right now --",
        "Brad: See? You're still saying that you don't care about her, but you know, I'm not buying it. And no one else will either.",
        "Jack: All I'm saying is, with Carly on probation and trying to reconnect with the kids, she's got a lot on her plate right now. Having you around, Brad, is a distraction. A complication, if you will.",
        "Brad: And Katie doesn't complicate things?",
        "Jack: Katie and I are none of your business. Katie has nothing to do with this.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi. You just get here?",
        "Katie: No, I've been here for a while. In fact, long enough to want to say something to your brother. Jack was right. Our relationship is none of your business. So, back off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker's going through a rough time. But he's not keeping me away. You have to think about what the last year's been like for him, J.J. You don't lose your father and your sister without showing the effects somehow.",
        "J.J.: But it's not like I haven't been through that bad stuff, too.",
        "Carly: I know. I know you have.",
        "J.J.: And I haven't been flunking my classes and I haven't been attacking everybody.",
        "Carly: I know. That's because you've learned to talk about your feelings. But it wasn't always that way. You may not remember very well, but there was a time that you and I did not get along.",
        "J.J.: But that was very long ago.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. But it was tough after your mom died. You barely spoke to me.",
        "J.J.: I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Ah, you don't have to be sorry. But maybe remembering will help you realize what Parker's going through right now. He has so many feelings inside him, he doesn't know what to do with them, so they come out as anger. And, you know, things will change. You just have to give it some time. [Doorbell ringing] Oh. Wonder who that is, huh?",
        "Lily: Surprise! Welcome back! It's so good to see you! Hi. Hi J.J. isn't it great to have your mom back?",
        "J.J.: Yeah. You know, I was going to go look for my baseball cards in my old room.",
        "Carly: Okay. He's gotten so big.",
        "Lily: Oh I know, it happens so fast. It is so good to see you! I heard all the charges were dropped?",
        "Carly: Yes, mercifully. Between Simon returning the necklace and Jack pulling some strings --",
        "Lily: I knew you couldn't stay away from your children.",
        "Carly: No, no I just -- I missed them too much.",
        "Lily: What about Simon?",
        "Carly: Well, I miss him, too. I guess I discovered that it's true -- that you can't have it all, right?",
        "Lily: We have to make choices. You came back. You made the right choice.",
        "Carly: Right. I know. But sometimes I miss him so much -- can I be honest with you?",
        "Lily: Of course. Of course you can.",
        "Carly: Well to tell you the truth, I think about Simon every minute. It's so hard being away from him, that sometimes I don't even know if I can stand it. But now that I'm back and I see Jack with Katie -- I can't stand that either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie, get a grip.",
        "Katie: I have a grip, Brad, on reality. And the reality is, you're not getting it. You don't change. You're still trying to drive a wedge between Jack and me and sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong.",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: I'm talking about the fact that when you saw me walk in, you started needling Jack about Carly. Hoping to back him into a corner so he would say something that would hurt me.",
        "Brad: Bro, I don't know where she gets this stuff.",
        "Katie: Don't think that just because Carly's back, you can use that to try to break us up. 'Cause it's not going to work.",
        "Brad: If you and Jack are so tight, then why is he acting so possessive of Carly? Why is he warning me --?",
        "Jack: Okay, Brad, we talked about this. You're crossing the line now.",
        "Brad: No. You've got to admit there's something seriously warped about that, Katie.",
        "Katie: What is seriously warped is the fact that you spied on us and then anonymously reported us to Kim.",
        "Jack: You reported us?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He saw us and then he called Kim.",
        "Jack: What are you a stalker now? What are you, some kind of peeping tom? Man, you are one sick puppy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Emily, I think Alison went back to Vegas with Lance. [Elevator dings] Do you know what happened? Call me. Cheri, I need to talk to you.",
        "Cheri: You do look a little uptight. I've got a girl who could help you with that.",
        "Dusty: I'm not interested.",
        "Cheri: Then I don't know what I can do for you.",
        "Dusty: You said you were going to get even with me for blowing your operation at the Avalon. What'd you do?",
        "Cheri: If I'd done something, do you really think I'd tell you?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Either tell me or you're going to be telling the D.A. downtown.",
        "Cheri: Well it wasn't illegal. I talked to a gentleman from Las Vegas. He was very interested to know that Emily was one of my girls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You sold your body? Why? You didn't need the money! Do you have so little self-respect?",
        "Emily: I have -- I have respect for myself. But at the time --",
        "Susan: And what about your health? What about your reputation? You have a son. Did you even think about Daniel?",
        "Emily: Mother -- it just happened, okay? I can't justify it. It just happened.",
        "Susan: No, Emily. Women don't become hookers by accident.",
        "Emily: You don't know what it was like for me after being used -- by Paul and Craig for the umpteenth time. My son was kidnapped, I lost my daughter. Then they take Daniel away from me. How much can one person take? I felt like nothing, okay? I felt less than nothing.",
        "Susan: So you found the first stranger who had $50?",
        "Emily: No, that's not what happened. Oh God. I met a guy at the Lakeview bar. Good-looking guy. Thought I was attractive. Didn't know who I was or what I'd been through. He seemed polite enough -- nice. So when he invited me back to his room, I said, yes. When he left, I found $1,000 on the nightstand. I know you're not going to understand this, Mom. But when I saw that money, I felt --",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Emily: I felt loved, and desired. I felt like I was in control of something. I mean, I wasn't in control of my life, but I could control what happened in that room.",
        "Susan: And that felt good to you?",
        "Emily: Yes, it felt good. It felt like I was running my life for once.",
        "Susan: Until some john beat the living hell out of you.",
        "Emily: Oh, just stop.",
        "Susan: Do you remember that?",
        "Emily: I don't want to think about that. Just forget about that night.",
        "Susan: But even after that -- did you go on? Did you keep on with other guys? Other clients? Why? Why didn't you stop?",
        "Emily: Why didn't you stop drinking?",
        "Susan: Well, I was in denial.",
        "Emily: So was I.",
        "Susan: Are you still doing it?",
        "Emily: No, I stopped.",
        "Susan: Then explain something to me. If you've stopped, why did that creepy guy know all about you? And what is he doing with Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why'd you tell Lance Barton that Emily worked for you?",
        "Cheri: The man said he needed ammunition. That you were bullying him to get out of town. It gave us a lot in common.",
        "Dusty: No rules about confidentiality in your business?",
        "Cheri: Sure, but you broke them when you had the cops shake me down at the Avalon. From that day forward, all bets were off, Dusty. I'm just sorry it took me such a long time to give you the bad day you deserve.",
        "Dusty: You think you're getting back at me for exposing Emily? Why would you assume I even care?",
        "Cheri: You're right. It was a gamble. But by the look on your face -- it seems I hit the jackpot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: His name is Lance Barton. He's a friend of Ali's from Vegas. He must have heard a rumor about me or something. I don't know.",
        "Susan: A rumor? Do I look like an idiot? Just tell me what's going on!",
        "Emily: Nothing.",
        "Susan: Don't give me that.",
        "Emily: Nothing. Mother --",
        "Susan: One minute she's fine, the next minute she's leaving town with that creep!",
        "Emily: Well maybe she didn't want to stick around after finding out what I was doing.",
        "Susan: Oh, Emily. She would never run away because of that.",
        "Emily: Oh, no?",
        "Susan: No! She always forgave you for everything. Even after you got involved with her fianc\u00e9!",
        "Emily: Well, she couldn't handle this.",
        "Susan: Why not?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Maybe, maybe she has her own problems. I don't know.",
        "Susan: Yes, you do.",
        "Emily: I don't know.",
        "Susan: Yes, you do! I didn't want to know that you were a prostitute, but I'm not lying dead on the floor. So hit me with it. What could Alison be involved in that's any worse than what you've been doing?",
        "Emily: Pornography.",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Emily: Oh, God. That guy, Lance Barton is a movie producer. And Alison's his latest star.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Carly, you should know that Jack was going to move on.",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course. I knew he was going to find somebody, but why'd it have to be Katie?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Well, apparently, she has really stepped to the plate when Jack was juggling everything.",
        "Carly: So I've heard. All I see is a woman who would not leave Simon alone. She did everything she could to see to it that we were arrested.",
        "Lily: You don't think that would have happened anyway?",
        "Carly: I think if she'd kept her nose out of it, we wouldn't have had to run. We could have built a life here. The kids liked Simon, Jack and I could have worked out some kind of custody arrangement, and it could have worked. But Katie would not stop. And the moment I was gone, she moved right in on Jack, didn't she?",
        "Lily: All right, no matter what went down, you have to get over it, if you want to get back to normal with your children.",
        "Carly: You're right. I know, and that's absolutely what I want to do.",
        "Lily: How do you plan on starting?",
        "Carly: With this house. Yeah. It needs a whole makeover.",
        "Lily: Oh, hmm.",
        "Carly: The curtains, the paint, the carpets, everything. And I have a lot of ideas, I want the kids' input, so we can make our new home together, you know?",
        "Lily: That's great. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Of course, that's going to take money.",
        "Lily: Did Simon give you money?",
        "Carly: Some. But it's not going to last forever. I will need to find a job.",
        "Lily: What do you want to do?",
        "Carly: Design is the only thing I know how to do.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you're great at that.",
        "Carly: Who's going to hire me? One look at my rap sheet, you think some headhunter's going to look at my resume?",
        "Lily: You're going to have to start your business yourself.",
        "Carly: Oh yeah.",
        "Lily: Yes you are.",
        "Carly: You know what that costs, don't you?",
        "Lily: You'll need backers, first.",
        "Carly: Yeah, the money guys. They're lined up to back a former fugitive who's going to be on probation the rest of her life.",
        "Lily: I know somebody who would do that. I do.",
        "Carly: You do?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Who's that?",
        "Lily: You're looking at her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You have done some twisted things in your day, but spying on Katie and me? What's the heck is up with that?",
        "Brad: I'm not the one who had sex in my place of business. Get a room!",
        "Katie: Get a life.",
        "Brad: You know what? By the way, I wasn't spying. When I left Carly's, I couldn't sleep. I came here to try to get some work done, but obviously that wasn't possible.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so you tattled on us.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm just trying to maintain some decency around here --",
        "Jack: Oh! You're going to play the decency card?",
        "Brad: Hey, I wasn't the one being inappropriate.",
        "Jack: Well, congratulations to you. You saw what he was doing and you called him on it.",
        "Katie: Well, I can be a pretty good troublemaker when I want to be. I know how they work.",
        "Jack: Well I'm just glad you didn't take anything he said seriously. Oh come on, you didn't, did you?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I did hear you talking about Carly.",
        "Jack: And?",
        "Katie: And it sounded like you still care.",
        "Jack: You and I made a pact to always be straight with each other, right?",
        "Katie: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Jack: Okay, then I don't have to pretend that I don't have a history with Brad and Carly.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Jack: But that's just it though, Katie -- it's history.",
        "Katie: I know -- at least a part of me does. But I just don't get why you have an issue with who she sees. And why do you care?",
        "Jack: I don't. I don't. But when Brad starts to goad me, I just remember what those two put me through. Nobody pushes my buttons like they do.",
        "Katie: Oh, I know. Carly pushed my buttons today when she confessed that she asked you to keep me away from the kids.",
        "Jack: Right, I told her she was out of line.",
        "Katie: I know, and she used that to try to get information about how the kids were while she was gone.",
        "Jack: Well, what did you tell her?",
        "Katie: I told her to ask you. She's playing games though. Just like Brad is. I mean, she didn't want to bury the hatchet any more than Brad wants decency in the workplace.",
        "Jack: See? That's why I don't want these two joining forces.",
        "Katie: I know, me either. But I just wish we could ignore them. Not care what they do.",
        "Jack: Okay. Let's work on that.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jack: Come here. I don't want you to worry, okay? I don't care who Carly sees. If she wants to see Brad, that's fine. But that has nothing to do with you and me.",
        "Katie: Convince me.",
        "Jack: You convinced yet?",
        "Katie: Mmm, you're getting there.",
        "Jack: I cannot get enough of you. [Cell phone rings] Hello? Yeah, I'll be right there.",
        "Katie: Station?",
        "Jack: No, it's Emma. Something's going on with Parker. I've got to get home.",
        "Katie: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Jack: No, I think I can handle it. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How could you even consider backing me? I'm a total liability. I would ruin your good name.",
        "Lily: Apparently, you're the only one in the world that doesn't know that my reputation is already shot.",
        "Carly: Well, how?",
        "Lily: I -- I invested in a baby food company and I didn't do the research. The food was tainted. And a lot of children were sick.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No, I hadn't heard about that.",
        "Lily: And as for Worldwide -- I signed it over to Craig.",
        "Carly: No, you didn't.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I did. After the parents were starting to file lawsuits for the sick children, Craig said he had a foolproof way to bail the company out. I signed the paperwork. I wasn't in a good place. I didn't read over the contracts and I signed over my mother's stock. The majority of it to Craig.",
        "Carly: What were you thinking?",
        "Lily: I wasn't thinking. I was hooked on diet pills.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Lily: The whole thing was a nightmare.",
        "Carly: When did you start with the pills?",
        "Lily: Oh, just little by little. I came out of the coma, and I had this new baby and I just wanted to lose a couple of pounds. But it got completely out of control. The good news is, I got into rehab. So, I am not one to pass judgment on anyone.",
        "Carly: I know what that's like. When you take a step and you don't know where it's going to lead you. 'Cause I've done it. And then I've taken the next step, and the next. And before I knew it, I was doing things I never dreamed I would do.",
        "Lily: That's exactly what happened to me.",
        "Carly: Well, at least you didn't leave your children behind.",
