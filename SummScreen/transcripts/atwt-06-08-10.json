        "Chris: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey. How's your back?",
        "Chris: Healing nicely. Thank you very much. Yeah. Not gonna be running any marathons anytime soon, but I can walk, I can drive, and I can even ask you out to dinner tonight.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Chris: Mm.",
        "Alison: Are you sure that I'm the one you want to ask?",
        "Chris: Is there any other Alison in the room? No.",
        "Alison: You really don't remember what happened yesterday.",
        "Chris: Other than Katie mowing us down with her car? No, and I hope that's a one-time thing, but what am I missing?",
        "Alison: Uh, a little conversation that you and I had afterwards while you were hopped up on painkillers and beer.",
        "Chris: Did I say something out of line?",
        "Alison: No, no, not at all. You were actually quite romantic. You said that you couldn't get me out of your head, that you thought that you and I were destined to be together forever.",
        "Chris: Alison, I am so sorry. I hope I didn't make you too uncomfortable.",
        "Alison: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Don't worry. Uh, you didn't really say it to me.",
        "Chris: I'm not following.",
        "Alison: Well, in your drugged-up state, you thought that I was Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Chris should be here really soon. I just have to run to the hospital real quick and pick up a prescription for Jacob, but as soon as I get back, we'll have time to run it before we go on air.",
        "Man: Sounds good. By the way, you make a great on-air team.",
        "Katie: You think so?",
        "[Remembering]",
        "Katie: No. Chris does not feel that way about me.",
        "Alison: Yes, he does, Katie. He told me so himself.",
        "Katie: I'm sure you just misunderstood him.",
        "Alison: I don't know how I could misunderstand, \"Katie, I can't stop thinking about you.\"",
        "Katie: He could have been talking about work or, you know, when he's on the show.",
        "Alison: No. He kept saying how beautiful you are and how he adores you, and he couldn't shut up about this kiss you shared on Lisa's show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hello?",
        "Casey: Hey! How was your trip?",
        "Tom: Fantastic.",
        "Casey: Really? Daniel's doing okay?",
        "Tom: He's better than okay. He's on the debating team. Look like they're gonna be competing against Exeter next month.",
        "Casey: Wow! That's impressive.",
        "Tom: Hey. Also, on the baseball team, varsity, shortstop. He's -- he's thrilled. So am I.",
        "Casey: That's it. Just keep rubbing it in. But I can still take him in arm- wrestling.",
        "Tom: This is not a competition. I'm proud of all your accomplishments, as well.",
        "Casey: Oh, really? Which -- which one's your favorite -- jail or my failed engagement? 'Cause I'm gonna go with jail.",
        "Tom: Cut it out. Your grades are improving. You've turned your life around. Stop being so self-deprecating. I'm proud of all my sons.",
        "Casey: Seriously, I'm happy for Daniel. He's doing okay without you and Emily raising him together.",
        "Tom: Now, that's an interesting side comment. What made you think to say that?",
        "Casey: Nothing. It's just -- it's -- you know -- a kid could be raised without having the traditional family, and he could still do well.",
        "Tom: Okay. You got my attention. What's on your mind?",
        "Casey: Nothing, nothing. We're just -- we're just talking.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, I don't buy that, 'cause I know you pretty well. What's wrong?",
        "Casey: I'm kind of in a jam.",
        "Tom: What kind of jam?",
        "Casey: I may have gotten some girl pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Is that a yes? I can come with you?",
        "Vienna: Well, the thing is, this doctor, it's -- it's -- he's notoriously slow. He always makes me wait.",
        "Henry: I'll wait with you.",
        "Vienna: You'll be really, really bored.",
        "Henry: As opposed to anxious and worried here?",
        "Vienna: Okay. How about this? I'll go there first, and then, when it's time for me to go in, I'll give you a call.",
        "Henry: You'll forget.",
        "Vienna: No, I won't. I swear. Okay?",
        "Henry: I guess it's gonna have to be.",
        "Vienna: Oh, stop being so anxious. Everything is gonna be fine this time. I promise, okay? I'll call you soon. I love you.",
        "Henry: I love you, too. [Sighs] This isn't gonna work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: [Remembering]",
        "Vienna: Let it go, Henry. Let go of the pain, the sorrow. That's not how I want to remember our baby, okay? You remember all our dreams, our hopes? Think about how happy we were and let the rest go, with love.",
        "Henry: I can't do this alone.",
        "Vienna: Okay. [Breathing heavily]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Henry.",
        "Henry: Aah!",
        "Barbara: Henry, what's wrong?",
        "Henry: Nothing. It's just my, uh -- just my allergies.",
        "Barbara: No, no. That's not allergies.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you're right. I'm, uh -- I'm having a panic attack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I had a feeling I'd find you here.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I came by to check on her, make sure she was doing all right.",
        "Emily: And?",
        "Paul: And she's still asleep, but the nurses said she had a really rough night.",
        "Emily: Well, that's not a good sign.",
        "Paul: I don't know what happened. I mean, she seemed to be doing so much better.",
        "Emily: Or maybe she was just pretending, and it just got too hard to keep up the charade.",
        "Paul: Or maybe something made her slip.",
        "Emily: Well, we may never know what that was. The point is, she did slip. You need to face facts, Paul.",
        "Paul: Really? What are the facts, em?",
        "Emily: Meg needs to go back to Deerbrook.",
        "Paul: Excuse me. I'm sorry, but do you or do you not know what's going on with Meg?",
        "Doctor: Yes, I think I do. Here's her toxicology report, and the results may surprise you.",
        "Paul: So, what's wrong with Meg?",
        "Doctor: There are high level traces of methadone in her bloodstream.",
        "Paul: Methadone? Why would she be taking methadone?",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Would that explain sudden mood swings, anxiety?",
        "Doctor: At these levels, definitely.",
        "Paul: But isn't methadone something you take so that you can get off of other drugs?",
        "Doctor: It can be, but addicts can abuse it, as well.",
        "Paul: Meg's not an addict. There has to be some other kind of explanation. This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Emily: Yes, of course it does! It would explain her -- her erratic behavior. The tox screen doesn't lie. Meg has been on drugs this whole time, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Oh, I can't believe I said all those things. I am so sorry. I hope I didn't make you feel too uncomfortable.",
        "Alison: It did a little, but, you know, it sort of clarified things, too. So, in the end, maybe it was a good thing.",
        "Chris: A good thing. How?",
        "Alison: Well, we now both know that we don't stand a chance as a couple.",
        "Chris: Hmm. Probably not, no. But good friends, right? I hope we can still handle that.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. The good friends curse. Will I ever escape it?",
        "Chris: Oh, Ali, there is a guy out there for you, all right? I am sure of it. Just -- just sit tight, 'cause he's a-coming.",
        "Alison: I don't know. I'm starting to wonder, you know, with my track record, maybe I'm safer being alone.",
        "Chris: Well, one thing's for sure -- I am safer staying away from beers and painkillers.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm glad you learned that lesson, Doctor.",
        "Chris: Yeah. So, did you tell Katie what I said?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I mean, I had to. She didn't say anything to you about it?",
        "Chris: Uh, no, no, but it explains why she threw me out of her house.",
        "Alison: She did? I'm sorry.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no. Um, I really don't blame her.",
        "Alison: She really didn't say anything to you about it?",
        "Chris: Not a word, and that is not a good thing.",
        "Katie: Excuse me. I'm here to pick up a prescription for my son, Jacob Snyder. The doctor said it would be ready.",
        "Nurse: Let me check.",
        "Katie: Thanks. Aah! Get a hold of yourself. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Are you sure you're the father?",
        "Casey: No, no. In fact, she swears I'm not.",
        "Tom: And you don't believe her?",
        "Casey: I want to.",
        "Tom: Well, you're still not sure. Why?",
        "Casey: It's a -- it's a gut feeling. It's stupid.",
        "Tom: No, no, it's not. I rely on gut feelings all the time.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I -- hey, it would be so much better if I was wrong about this.",
        "Tom: Well, this time, you need to be sure.",
        "Casey: Yeah, especially after what I did to Gwen.",
        "Tom: Hey, I'm proud of you, wanting to do the right thing.",
        "Casey: Even if she's making it difficult to do that?",
        "Tom: Well, maybe she thinks that you're not willing to step up.",
        "Casey: No. I've made it more than clear that I wanted to do that. I want to be involved, you know, as much as she wants, how she wants.",
        "Tom: Okay. So, is there anything I can do to help? I mean, we can file papers demanding a paternity test as soon as that's viable. I can even get started on that this afternoon.",
        "Casey: I just don't want it to come to that.",
        "Tom: Okay. Let me know if it does.",
        "Casey: Thank you. Thanks, Dad. I appreciate that.",
        "Tom: And for what it's worth, if you need to step into the role of dad, I think, uh -- I think you'll be good at it. I think you'd be a terrific father.",
        "Casey: Well, I had a great teacher, you know, the best.",
        "Tom: Yeah? Well, you didn't always make it that easy.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know, and that's why you are the best. And, um, I know I'll be a better man because of you.",
        "Tom: Casey, you've always been a good man. It just took you a little while to find it in yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: So, could you tell me a little bit about the success rate with artificial insemination? I mean, how long before I'd know if it worked.",
        "Nurse: That depends.",
        "Vienna: Of course. But what about how long the procedure takes? I mean, would I have to stay overnight?",
        "Nurse: Dr. Mitchell will answer all your questions, Ms. Hyatt. He'll be with you shortly.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Vienna: Katie. Wh-- what are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Never mind me. Artificial insemination? Are you crazy?",
        "Vienna: Katie, listen to me.",
        "Katie: No way. I am not gonna let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: It's okay. It's okay. I just need a minute. I don't want you to stick around watching me make a fool of myself.",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Henry. I've seen you in a superhero cape. Nothing can embarrass me. Not a paper bag. Besides, I owe you.",
        "Henry: You owe me?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, 'cause you were with me when I was having a panic attack of my own, waiting to find out if my cancer was back.",
        "Henry: This is different.",
        "Barbara: How so?",
        "Henry: I don't -- I don't feel comfortable talking to you about it.",
        "Barbara: Because of Vienna and the baby? Well, lucky for you, I'm over it.",
        "Henry: You are?",
        "Barbara: Well, yeah. You and Vienna are getting married. You're having a child, and I have to accept it and move on.",
        "Henry: That's, uh -- that's good for you.",
        "Barbara: Not like I had any choice, but -- I'm hoping we can still be friends.",
        "Henry: I hope so, too.",
        "Barbara: Then don't push a friend away when you're in trouble, even if it's just a panic attack.",
        "Henry: I really feel foolish.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't. Why don't you tell me what happened?",
        "Henry: I was -- I was on my way to the hospital to see Vienna. She's seeing her ob-gyn. I stopped by a baby store to get her something. A surprise, you know. And I was getting in the car, and I saw this park.",
        "Barbara: What about it?",
        "Henry: Well, when we lost the baby, Vienna and I came out here, and we, uh -- we let some balloons loose. It was a -- I don't know. It was a ceremony, sort of.",
        "Barbara: Like a goodbye.",
        "Henry: Like a goodbye. And I -- I don't know. I just stood out here and thought about all those balloons and them floating away.",
        "Barbara: It reminded you of what you lost.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Barbara. I got really scared, 'cause if it could happen once, it could happen again.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. Fate is not gonna be that cruel. It's not gonna take away your chance to be a father.",
        "Henry: I'm not so sure that it can't happen again.",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on. Come on. I mean, look at me. I beat all the odds when they weren't in my favor. You can handle this. I know you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: How dare you put Eliza's life at risk like that! What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Meg: What are you talking bout?",
        "Emily: We know about the methadone, Meg. The tox report came back in.",
        "Meg: Paul, what is going on?",
        "Paul: There were trace levels of methadone in your blood.",
        "Meg: What? That's not possible.",
        "Emily: Oh, don't. Don't -- don't try to lie your way out of this one.",
        "Meg: I am not lying. Paul, you know me. I would never take any drugs, especially not one so strong and addictive!",
        "Emily: It's in your bloodstream! It just didn't magically appear on the tox screen!",
        "Meg: Well, the tox screen is wrong!",
        "Emily: Of course you're gonna deny it.",
        "Paul: Okay. You know what, Emily? Do you think I could talk to Meg for a second by myself, please?",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine. Why am I not surprised?",
        "Meg: Paul, this is crazy.",
        "Paul: It's just the two of us here right now, okay? Tell me the truth. Did you? Did you start taking methadone?",
        "Meg: I did not take any kind of narcotic. I would never do that.",
        "Paul: Well, there's a toxicology report. So how do you explain that?",
        "Meg: Well, obviously they made a mistake in the lab. It happens.",
        "Paul: No, it doesn't. Not often.",
        "Meg: How can you even think that I would put Eliza in that kind of jeopardy?",
        "Paul: You've been under a lot of intense pressure. That's all.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and I'm trying to get better for my daughter. Why would I put that at risk? Paul, you know me. I rarely even take aspirin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, what are you doing here? Are you okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Meg, on the other hand, seems to be in a little bit of trouble.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Emily: Well, the tox exam found trace amounts of methadone in her system. A lot of it, actually.",
        "Alison: Methadone? That's interesting.",
        "Emily: Why? Why do you say it like that?",
        "Alison: Some was recently stolen from the hospital.",
        "Emily: When?",
        "Alison: A couple days ago.",
        "Emily: Did they catch who took it?",
        "Alison: No, not yet, but Meg was here on the day it was stolen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What a gorgeous day. It's hard to believe that anything in the world can go wrong when it's so beautiful like this.",
        "Henry: Yet they do.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, they do.",
        "Henry: Thank you, though, for trying to cheer me up.",
        "Barbara: Is it working?",
        "Henry: Eh, it's--",
        "Barbara: You know, you have no reason to be having panic attacks, because the baby's going to be fine, and you're gonna be a wonderful father.",
        "Henry: You think so?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I do. And trust me, I was married to the most loathsome father on the planet.",
        "Henry: James Stenbeck, daddy dearest.",
        "Barbara: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm just lucky that I didn't have to go through that.",
        "Barbara: You have no idea how lucky.",
        "Henry: Sometimes I feel for Paul. Trust me.",
        "Barbara: Well, Paul turned out okay.",
        "Henry: That depends on your definition of okay.",
        "Barbara: Paul's complicated.",
        "Henry: Mm.",
        "Barbara: But he's a good man. And so are you.",
        "Henry: Thank you. I mean that.",
        "Barbara: I mean it, too.",
        "Henry: Well, no more panic attacks for me. I'm, uh -- I'm done heaving for the day. It's time to get back to the real world.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, I guess we should. But one more thing. I don't want what happened between us to keep you from moving on. I want you to give everything you have to Vienna and that baby, 100%, because they deserve to be happy, and so do you.",
        "Henry: I hope you find what you're looking for, too, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I thought I had.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: No, Katie. I'm desperate. Henry doesn't even want to sleep with me because he's so afraid of hurting the baby. So, how else am I gonna get pregnant so there can actually be a baby?",
        "Katie: Why can't you just tell Henry the truth?",
        "Vienna: No, absolutely not, because if I do, he will leave me.",
        "Katie: No, he won't. He loves you. You can't trick him into staying.",
        "Vienna: How do you know?",
        "Katie: Because I've tried things like this a million times. It never works out the way you hope. And Henry loves you so much. You two belong together. When the time is right, you'll have a baby. Just let nature take its course.",
        "Vienna: No, I -- I can't trust nature. Nature hasn't really been cooperative with me in the past. So I think it's time to actually throw in a little bit of help.",
        "Katie: Chris, hey. I'm glad you're here. Listen, I have a couple things to talk to you about before we get started.",
        "Chris: Katie, I need to talk to you about something first.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Chris: Come here for a second.",
        "Katie: What's going on?",
        "Chris: Well, I know what happened. Alison told me everything.",
        "Katie: Everything about what?",
        "Chris: Katie, you know what I mean. Okay, I was drugged up. I thought she was you, and I told her how I felt about you.",
        "Katie: So? It didn't mean anything. Like you just said, you were drugged up. You didn't know what you were saying.",
        "Chris: No, but I knew what I was saying, Katie. Look, I may have said it to the wrong person, but I meant every word of it. I do have feelings for you, strong feelings, and I just cannot get that kiss out of my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Everything all right?",
        "Emily: Far from it. Meg has been doped up on methadone this whole time. That's why she's been acting so off-the-wall.",
        "Barbara: And how do you know that?",
        "Emily: The toxicology report came in. And here you've been painting me as the bad influence on Eliza.",
        "Barbara: What does Paul have to say?",
        "Emily: Well, naturally, he wants to give her the benefit of the doubt. So he asked the doctors to run a second test.",
        "Barbara: But you don't think that's necessary?",
        "Emily: Necessary? It's a complete waste of time, Barbara. It's obvious what's going on. The woman, she's under pressure. She was out of Deerbrook too soon. She's -- she's self-medicating.",
        "Barbara: Well, that theory certainly benefits you, doesn't it?",
        "Emily: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't play naive with me, Emily. You know exactly what I mean. Don't you find it incredibly odd that Meg has just started using drugs, especially when she's so close to getting her life back together?",
        "Emily: Well, the actions of mentally disturbed people really rarely make sense.",
        "Barbara: That's not an answer. Eliza was in the room when Meg had that episode. It was terrifying. Why would she do that in front of her daughter?",
        "Emily: Because she didn't know what she was doing. The episode was drug- induced, remember?",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Emily. It's methadone. Meg is a nurse. She would not risk her health like that.",
        "Emily: Well, maybe, but she is weak.",
        "Barbara: She cares too much about her daughter to put her through that. It was harrowing. I don't buy it.",
        "Emily: Okay. Well, I suppose you have a more plausible explanation?",
        "Barbara: As a matter of fact, I do. What if someone else was drugging her, someone else who has a vested interest in making her look bad?",
        "Emily: Are you speculating or are you making an accusation?",
        "Barbara: What do you think?",
        "Emily: I think you're way out of line.",
        "Barbara: Am I?",
        "Paul: Hi, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Hi, Paul.",
        "Paul: What am I interrupting?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Nothing at all.",

        "Vienna: Henry, I thought you were gonna wait for me to call you.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. I got so antsy in the hotel, though, and I just started driving, and the next thing I knew, I ended up here.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. Too bad you came all this way for nothing.",
        "Vienna: What happened?",
        "Vienna: My appointment got canceled.",
        "Henry: What? Why?",
        "Vienna: Well, the doctor had an emergency. So we'll, uh, have to reschedule.",
        "Henry: That's -- that's too bad.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. I was just about to leave.",
        "Henry: Well, then I came here just in the nick of time here. Come on. Come with me. I'm gonna buy you a latte. I have a surprise for you.",
        "Vienna: Really? What surprise?",
        "Henry: Well, that's why they call it a surprise, Sweetie. Come on. I'll show you. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You couldn't hear what they were talking about?",
        "Alison: No, but Vienna was definitely upset about something.",
        "Casey: Do you know where Katie is? Maybe you could go and ask her what they were talking about.",
        "Alison: Well, I think she left, but you would have a better chance with her than I would. She's your aunt.",
        "Casey: I can't talk to her about this. I mean, she'll freak out. And then she'll probably tell my mom. This whole thing is driving me nuts.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe Vienna's lying. Maybe you're not the father, and maybe she's upset about something else or with someone else.",
        "Casey: I-I want to believe that, but I'm not assuming anything about this. I have to know for sure.",
        "Alison: You deserve to know for sure.",
        "Casey: The question is, how do I find out? I mean, Vienna's stonewalling me, and I don't even know the real name of her doctor.",
        "Alison: I may know a way for us to find out.",
        "Casey: Really? How?",
        "Alison: Follow me. If Vienna's seeing a doctor here at the hospital, any doctor, there will be a record of it on file. So we just have to look it up.",
        "Casey: Is this illegal?",
        "Alison: Do you care?",
        "Casey: Right. Let's do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't do this right now. We have a show to do. Let's just concentrate on that.",
        "Chris: Katie. Katie, we need to talk about this first, please.",
        "Katie: There's nothing to talk about. You were stoned. You said some stupid things. You didn't even say them to me.",
        "Chris: These are words that you were meant to hear.",
        "Katie: They were ramblings by someone on painkillers and alcohol.",
        "Chris: And I'm standing you in front of you stone-cold sober. I'm willing to repeat word for word and mean every word of it. I am.",
        "Katie: No, please don't. Please don't do that.",
        "Chris: Why, Katie? You feel the same way about me, even though you won't admit it.",
        "Katie: No, I don't.",
        "Chris: Yes, you do, and you cannot get that kiss out of your mind. I know you can't.",
        "Katie: And you know me so well.",
        "Chris: I know you better than you think, and I know that you're hiding from your own feelings.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Chris: Yes.",
        "Katie: Why would I do that?",
        "Chris: Because you are afraid.",
        "Katie: Of what?",
        "Chris: Of letting Brad go.",
        "Katie: Stop it. I am not having this conversation. Not now, not ever.",
        "Chris: Fine. You can pretend whatever you want, okay. In fact, I can't force you to move on, even though I think it's time that you did.",
        "Katie: Well, you don't get to decide that for me, and you can't force me to have feelings for you that I don't have.",
        "Chris: Yes, you do, but you just can't face them. You're obviously not over Brad, but I'm not gonna try to compete with your dead husband.",
        "Katie: That's cruel. That is cruel and unfair.",
        "Chris: No. You know what is unfair? That you deserve to start over but you just won't let yourself.",
        "Katie: You don't know what you're talking about. You've never lost a wife. You've never lost the mother of your child, and you're talking to me like you know what I'm going through, but you don't.",
        "Chris: Fine. Fine. You know what? I will leave you alone, and I'm gonna make it real easy for you.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Chris: Today will be my last show, and you will never have to see me again.",
        "Katie: So, if you thought you were talking to me in that bedroom, what did you expect me to say back?",
        "Chris: Oh, probably expected you to be honest and admit that you feel the same way.",
        "Katie: But I don't. And what do you mean by probably?",
        "Chris: Well, it wasn't planned. I was drugged up, right? Just something I blurted out.",
        "Katie: Well, you must be pretty arrogant if you think that one little kiss would change my entire life.",
        "Chris: I thought this is something you didn't want to talk about.",
        "Katie: I don't. I just want to let you know that my life is very full. I'm very happy. I have Jacob. I have a job I love. I don't need that complicated by a relationship.",
        "Chris: Fine. You've convinced me I'm wasting my time. You just haven't convinced yourself.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't need convincing.",
        "Chris: You can pretend all you want, but I know that you are scared.",
        "Katie: Of what?",
        "Chris: Scared of falling in love again.",
        "Katie: Maybe I just don't want to fall in love again. Did you ever think of that? And I especially wouldn't want to fall in love with an arrogant, self- centered guy like you.",
        "Chris: [Laughs] If this is how you handle something you don't care about, I'm dying to see how you deal with something you do.",
        "Producer: Okay. We're ready to go in five, four, three, two.",

        "Alison: Well, I'll print it out for you.",
        "[Door handle rattles]",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll handle it. Dr. Forsythe, hi. Sorry about that. Uh, I was just putting away some files. Is there anything I can do for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Here. I got all of your favorite music. You can play it for the baby every day. They say it's good for them to hear it in the womb. I even heard of couples that actually play music in the O.R. while they're giving birth.",
        "Vienna: Well, as long as it's not punk rock or hip-hop.",
        "Henry: What? Where's your sense of fun? And there's more. There's more. That's the right one, isn't it? That's the one you had when you were a kid, yeah?",
        "Vienna: Yes, yes. Oh, my God. Where did you find this? It's perfect.",
        "Henry: You can start reading to the baby tonight.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I don't even know what to say.",
        "Henry: You don't have to say anything. I'm the one that has to say I'm sorry to you.",
        "Vienna: What do you have to apologize for?",
        "Henry: I've been so anxious and so scared. I want everything to work out right this time.",
        "Vienna: It will work out. It will work out.",
        "Henry: I'm starting to believe that. I can't wait to have a baby with you, Liebchen.",

        "Emily: Alison was here just a little while ago, and she told me that some methadone was taken from this hospital a couple of days ago.",
        "Paul: So?",
        "Emily: So? So Meg was here the very same day the methadone was taken at around the same time. Now, are you gonna tell me that's a coincidence?",
        "Paul: It could be.",
        "Emily: What -- what is it gonna take for you to open your eyes? She's more unbalanced than any of us ever thought.",
        "Paul: Just don't think that we should jump to any conclusions.",
        "Emily: Why not, Paul? You always do with me. Why is it you're always so willing to -- to think the worst of everyone but Meg?",
        "Paul: Okay. That's not true.",
        "Emily: No? It's not true?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: It's not true? Then for once in your life, prove it. Take your wife's side.",

        "Barbara: Hi. How are you feeling?",
        "Meg: Like someone who's being set up.",
        "Barbara: Things aren't looking up for you, are they?",
        "Meg: No. It was a mistake. A mix-up. Some lab technician messed up the results.",
        "Barbara: Listen. I have to tell you, your doctor's standing by the tox report.",
        "Meg: Well, then he's wrong.",
        "Barbara: Meg, Honey, no one would blame you if you slipped up. I know more than anyone else how difficult it is to -- to leave the protection, the security, of Deerbrook.",
        "Meg: I was ready to leave Deerbrook, Barbara. My doctor there even agreed.",
        "Barbara: But what if you weren't? It's hard to come back into the world and not be surrounded by the same --",
        "Meg: Okay, okay! Stop it, stop it! I did not slip up, and I did not do this to myself!",
        "Barbara: You know what? We all saw it. We saw at the christening how you screamed at Emily. You called her evil all in front of Eliza.",
        "Meg: I-I don't know why that happened.",
        "Barbara: So it was out of your control.",
        "Meg: Yes, but not because I'm taking drugs!",
        "Barbara: Okay. Look, I don't want to upset you any more, but I just heard something outside.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] What now?",
        "Barbara: It seems that some methadone was stolen from the hospital a few days ago.",
        "Meg: That doesn't prove anything. I certainly didn't steal any drugs. You can ask Emily.",
        "Barbara: Why would I ask Emily?",
        "Meg: Because she was here at the same time I was.",

        "Alison: This is strange.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: Well, according to her file, Vienna hasn't had a doctor's appointment since she lost her baby last year.",
        "Casey: Not even a regular checkup?",
        "Alison: Uh, no physician's checkup, no gynecologist visits, and definitely no ob-gyn.",
        "Casey: Maybe she's seeing someone else.",
        "Alison: Yeah, maybe, but then why did she tell you she was coming here?",
        "Casey: I don't know. Maybe because --",
        "Alison: She's hiding something?",

        "Henry: I have a confession to make.",
        "Vienna: What is it?",
        "Henry: Before I met you at the hospital, I went to Trinity Park.",
        "Vienna: Trinity Park? That's where we let loose all the balloons when we lost Sven.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: What made you go there?",
        "Henry: I felt compelled to go.",
        "Vienna: Because you're feeling anxious about this baby?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I wish I'd gone with you.",
        "Henry: It was, uh -- you know what it was? It was very cathartic. I went in really worried, and I came out calm.",
        "Vienna: Well, did something specific happen?",
        "Henry: No, nothing specific. Just being there in the place that we said goodbye to our baby, I, uh -- the past is the past, and I can't be scared of it anymore, and I can't let it stop us from thinking about our future.",
        "Vienna: Yes, our future.",
        "Henry: Our future. And I can't worry about things that I have no control over.",
        "Vienna: I'm so glad to hear you say that.",

        "Chris: Before we finish up today, I'd like to make an announcement.",
        "Katie: Oh, that sounds serious.",
        "Chris: Well, it is, but in a good way. This program has been an amazing run for me, and I hope that I helped some of you moms out there navigate the tricky waters of child-rearing with a little more confidence.",
        "Katie: He's been terrific, hasn't he, Ladies?",
        "Chris: But all good things must come to an end, and so it has for me. Today will be my final broadcast, but do not worry. I will leave you in Katie's very capable hands. She's a great mother, terrific friend, and I am lucky to know her, and you are all lucky to have her in your homes every day. So, I wish you the best. Goodbye.",
        "Producer: And we're out.",
        "Katie: Chris, wow. I don't -- I don't know what to say.",

        "Paul: I just don't think that Meg would take drugs. She's not that kind of a person. She's a -- she's a nurse. She's a mother.",
        "Emily: Well, people can surprise you. They change. Life messes them up, and they do things that you would expect them to do, and you, of all people, should understand that.",
        "Paul: I don't think that she would go that far.",
        "Emily: Because you won't allow yourself to believe it.",
        "Barbara: You said that Meg was here the day the methadone was stolen?",
        "Emily: Yes. Alison told me.",
        "Barbara: You didn't see her yourself?",
        "Paul: How could she have seen her?",
        "Barbara: Because, according to Meg, your wife was here that day, as well.",
        "Paul: Is that true?",
        "Emily: Yes, I ran into Meg that day. I was here with Eliza. Remember, your daughter had a checkup? Did Meg happen to tell you that, too? Because I know where your mother's going with this, and she's dead wrong.",
        "Paul: Really? Where's she going with this?",
        "Barbara: Well, it seems that since you're having so much trouble believing Meg on this, you should listen to this one.",
        "Emily: Don't you -- just back off, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: You know what? It makes as much, if not more, sense that maybe someone else is drugging Meg, someone who wants to make her look bad.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I suppose it's possible.",
        "Emily: What? You cannot honestly believe that I would drug her. Do you?",
        "Paul: Telling me you didn't?",
