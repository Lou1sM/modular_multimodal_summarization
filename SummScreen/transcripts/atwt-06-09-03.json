        "Hannah: Haven't found out \r\nofficially if you're brain \r\ndead? Good enough to kiss \r\nher sore, swollen feet? Man \r\nenough to say you're sorry, \r\nor you were wrong or just \r\nplain dumb?",
        "Jack: Now, wait a minute.",
        "Hannah: You've wasted \r\nenough time. You want Carly \r\nback?",

        "Walker: You see patterns, \r\nconnect the dots, same as I \r\ndo. Look at the facts, \r\nLieutenant. We have an \r\ninjection mark on Nurse \r\nKrebs and Myrtle Scott. We \r\nhave a phone message from \r\nNurse Krebs about an empty \r\nvial of medicine.",
        "Hal: The one that Katie \r\nFrasier found.",

        "Molly: It's unreal, isn't \r\nit? The way Dusty looks at \r\nyou like you're the only \r\nwoman in the world who \r\nreally understands him. And \r\nthen he gets that puppy dog \r\nlook in his eyes that makes \r\nyou just want to give him \r\nthe world, and you do. I \r\nunderstand, Rose, okay? I \r\nfell for him, too. And my \r\nbank account is a lot \r\nlighter because of it.",

Already made \r\narrangements to have the \r\nbaby delivered at Mercy \r\nHospital in town when the \r\ntime comes. The biggest \r\nproblem we're facing right \r\nnow is that Carly won't eat \r\nand can't sleep, so it's up \r\nto you to fix it. Which \r\nbrings us to foreplay.",
        "Jack: Come again?",
        "Hannah: She's nine months \r\npregnant. Her sex drive is \r\nlike her feet. It's there, \r\nshe just hasn't seen it for \r\na while.",

        "Jack: What water?",
        "Hannah: The water you're \r\ngonna pump for her bath. \r\nThere's a gorgeous old tub \r\nout back. If you can fill it \r\nup with water and lug it in, \r\nthen she can take a soak in \r\nit. Make it warm, not too \r\nhot. It'll relax her \r\nmuscles, and for the first \r\ntime in months, maybe she \r\nwon't feel like she weighs a \r\nton. There's salts and \r\nbubbles right there. Fresh \r\nlinens in there. I hope you \r\nbrought a gift. A nightie, \r\nsomething?",
        "Jack: Well, I thought the \r\nmountains were still chilly \r\nright about now, so I just \r\npicked up a red and blue \r\nflannel thing.",

So assuming \r\nyou've got some charm hidden \r\nin there somewhere, I \r\nsuggest you use it, all of \r\nit, and fast. Unless you've \r\ndecided you don't belong \r\nhere after all.",
