        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I didn't think those forensic guys would ever be done in here.",
        "Jack: I got it. Okay, stop, stop, stop. I'm a little concerned about you. Why don't you go upstairs and take a nap? You barely got any sleep last night.",
        "Carly: I did. I got some.",
        "Jack: Carly. Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm fine, Jack, really. Les is dead. For real this time. And it's over. That's all that matters.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's right. It's over. It's finally over. Come here.",
        "IA officer: Detective Snyder?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "IA officer: Ed Connelly, internal affairs. You got a minute?",
        "Jack: Yeah, sure.",
        "Carly: Internal affairs? Is something wrong?",
        "IA officer: Just a routine follow up, ma'am.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'll -- I'll handle it. Listen, I mean it. Go upstairs and take a nap while I take care of this.",
        "Carly: Well, I mean it. No. I'll go outside and get some air. I'm still a little congested from that smoke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly remembering]",
        "[Carly coughing] hmm. Try all you want, you ain't ever getting that spot out. See, that's the thing about blood. It just never goes away. Neither do I.",
        "Carly: You are not real. And I am not afraid of you anymore.",
        "Les: Wanna bet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hello.",
        "Craig: Oh, hello. Can I get you something?",
        "Rosanna: No, thanks, I'm not really hungry. I'm just gonna have little coffee.",
        "Craig: Rough night?",
        "Rosanna: What do you think?",
        "Craig: Paul Ryan is not worth losing sleep over.",
        "Rosanna: I went to his apartment last night. Emily showed up while I was there.",
        "Craig: Big surprise. Those two are up to something.",
        "Rosanna: She's pressing charges against me.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't worry about that.",
        "Rosanna: He told her Cabot was alive.",
        "Craig: He what?",
        "Rosanna: He told Emily my -- my son was alive. This is a disaster. I mean, if Emily tells Hal, he's gonna contact social services. Jordan could find out.",
        "Craig: No, Jordan is long gone. He's not gonna know anything.",
        "Rosanna: But, what about James? I mean, what if -- what if this to James and he gets out of jail, then he could find Cabot. I never should have come back here.",
        "Craig: The more you panic, the more mistakes you're going to make. Just -- just leave it to me.",
        "Rosanna: Why? How are you gonna handle this?",
        "Craig: Just leave Paul and Emily to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry, I was told that Dr. Stewart is working on this floor.",
        "Nurse #1: Oh, Dr. Stewart's still making rounds. She should be finishing up soon.",
        "Emily: Great. [Cell phone rings] Oh, excuse me. Thank you. Hello?",
        "Paul: Emily, its Paul. So, I just got off the phone with Tom Hughes' office, and we're gonna have a meeting there this afternoon. His office will call to confirm a time.",
        "Emily: Great, great. I'm at the hospital now, I'm trying to track down my mother.",
        "Paul: You think she'll be able to help you find you an expert witness that'll testify about the drug that Rosanna gave to you?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I hope so. I -- I think it's gonna be a tough sell. I tried to bring it up last night. It didn't go over so well.",
        "Paul: Well, give it your best shot. Because the more evidence against Rosanna that we bring to Tom, the better off we'll be. [Doorbell rings] I gotta go, Em. But, hey, good luck.",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Paul: Morning, Mike. Jennifer all right?",
        "Mike: No. Thanks to you, she's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Jennifer, hi.",
        "Jennifer: You look surprised.",
        "Katie: I just thought -- I didn't see your car.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I get it. So, jen's not home, so it's a great time to stop by and say hi to Mike.",
        "Katie: No, that's not it at all. I was just wanting to talk to both of you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Well, Mike's not here. He took my car to the shop. So I guess you'll just have to deal with me.",
        "Katie: I can come back.",
        "Jennifer: Why? After coming all this way? Whatever you wanted to say to us, why can't you just say it to me? Ah, I am in a bit of a rush, though. I have a doctor's appointment I still have to get ready for.",
        "Katie: Is everything okay with the baby?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. It's just a checkup.",
        "Katie: Oh, is this what you're working on? New designs?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. I don't think I could handle everything that's going on if I didn't have my work to hold onto.",
        "Katie: Oh, you have a lot more than work to help get you through the day.",
        "Jennifer: Right, I do. I'm very fortunate.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but, I know that doesn't always make things any easier to take. Like my brother, for instance. That's actually why I'm here, Jennifer. I just -- I feel like I know Craig probably better than anyone. So I think I should be the one to help you smooth things over with him.",
        "Jennifer: If by smooth things over, you mean tell him to stay out of our lives, then please, by all means, feel free.",
        "Katie: But why does it have to be so extreme?",
        "Jennifer: How did I know you'd say something like that?",
        "Katie: He just wants a chance, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: A chance to ruin my baby's life? No, thank you!",
        "Katie: No, a chance to prove that he can be a good father.",
        "Jennifer: You have to be a good person to be a good parent.",
        "Katie: Okay, you know what? I think everybody just needs to step back, take a deep breath and --",
        "Jennifer: No, no, stop. Don't even try! There is no way that Craig will ever be part of this child's life!",
        "Katie: You think he's gonna back off just because you ask him to? You know him better than that, Jennifer. Look, all I'm asking you to do is trust me enough to try and keep him at bay.",
        "Jennifer: That's just it, Katie. I don't trust you. And I certainly don't need you fighting my battles for me. So please, just back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I don't know what it was you and Dusty did to drive Craig out of town, and frankly I don't want to know. But whatever it is, it didn't work. 'Cause he's back and he's furious. He's blaming Jennifer, accusing her of being in on the plot.",
        "Paul: That's ridiculous.",
        "Mike: I know. But he's too angry to listen to reason.",
        "Paul: All right. Okay. I'll handle Craig.",
        "Mike: No, your idea of help has done more damage than good. You backed him into a corner, now that guy's out for blood.",
        "Paul: Well, Mike nobody thought that he'd be back into town.",
        "Mike: And that's exactly my point. Nobody stopped to think about the what ifs.",
        "Paul: Okay, you're right. Point taken. I -- so, what do you want me to do?",
        "Mike: I don't want you to do anything. Just -- just stay out of our lives.",
        "Paul: Okay, if you're thinking about going after Craig by yourself, don't do that. Mike, he'll obliterate you.",
        "Mike: I'm not afraid of Craig.",
        "Paul: Well, that's a mistake.",
        "Mike: Look, you had your chance and you blew it, okay? Now, please, step aside, and leave Craig to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rosanna: Why, what are you gonna do?",
        "Craig: I'll talk to Paul. I'll talk to Emily. I'll convince them that whatever they're feeling towards you, they cannot jeopardize Cabot's life. Okay? Just talk. Do you trust me that much?",
        "Rosanna: I suppose I have nothing left to lose.",
        "Craig: Lots to gain. I'll let you know how things come out. But --",
        "Rosanna: Good luck. Les Sweeney was shot and killed by detective Jack Snyder last night during a hostage situation at the Snyder farm? Oh, my God. Carly. --------------------------------------------------------------p",
        "Carly: Come on, Carly. Just pull yourself together. He's gone. You are so much stronger than this.",
        "Les: Sure, keep telling yourself that. But I'm right here, little lady. Right here, inside your head, like a tumor. And I ain't never goin' anywhere. You hear me?",
        "Carly: You shut up. I am done running from you. I'm done being scared.",
        "Les: What are you doin', talking to a ghost? Oh, come on, you don't really think you're gonna get rid of me, do you? You know better than anyone that sometimes the dead just don't -- they don't wanna stay dead. Sometimes you just can't keep them down. Can you, Carly?",
        "Carly: Go away. You're not real.",
        "Les: Oh, I'm real. At least inside that little head of yours, I'm real. Who else is up in there, haunting you, huh? I know I ain't the only one. You know it, too. What other ghosts are in there, spinning around, reminding you that you ain't never gonna run from your past.",
        "Carly: Stop it. Stop it. Just stop. I'm gonna close my eyes, and when I open them again you will be gone.",
        "Jack: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Carly: Everything's fine. Why?",
        "Jack: I thought I heard you talking to someone.",
        "Carly: No. No, who would I be talking to? So, are you guys just about finished in there, or what?",
        "Jack: Are you sure that you don't want to -- talk to someone about everything. Not just last night -- all of it?",
        "Carly: No, what do you mean, like a shrink? Why? Why, because some homicidal maniac locked me a trunk and set fire to my best friend's house with me in it? This is Carly Tenney Snyder you're talking to, the toughest chick you'll ever want to meet.",
        "Jack: You don't have to tell me that.",
        "Carly: So, you guys just about finished?",
        "Jack: No, they shouldn't be too much longer. Internal affairs is just dotting all the is, and I'm having a clean up crew coming in.",
        "Carly: Make sure they don't miss anything.",
        "Jack: I will see to it, then I was going to go check in on Holden.",
        "Carly: I was just thinking that I should check in on Lily, and see how she's doing.",
        "Jack: She could probably use the company, but do me a favor first. Go upstairs, and lie down, and get some rest. You'll feel so much better.",
        "Carly: All right, okay. Anything if it will shut you up.",
        "IA officer: Ah, Detective, I'm through here. Everything seems to have been handled by the book.",
        "Cop: Clean up crew's on its way.",
        "Jack: Great, all right. Hey, listen, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to call.",
        "IA officer: All right, thanks.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Case closed.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Good. Thank God it's over. Now maybe things will get back to normal for all of us.",

        "Luke: Dad.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Luke: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: Just trying to save what I can. You okay?",
        "Luke: I feel like I can't wake up from a bad dream.",
        "Holden: I know. Me, too. But, you know what? It's all just stuff. That's all it is. We're okay, your mom's okay. And Carly. That's what matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Are you in a lot of pain?",
        "Keith: No. Well, not yet. You should get out of here. You should get some sleep.",
        "Lily: I wanted to be here when you woke up.",
        "Keith: Thank you. It's just a flesh wound. It's not like I'm gonna die, or anything.",
        "Lily: I know, I just -- there's just a lot of things we need to talk about.",
        "Keith: Yeah. There are. But I think you should go home and spend some time with your family.",
        "Lily: I don't have a home any more. And I want to be here with you. Unless you don't want me to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mother, I've been looking everywhere for you. I've left you like a million messages.",
        "Susan: I know.",
        "Emily: What, are you avoiding me?",
        "Susan: I'm avoiding the fight I know we're gonna have.",
        "Emily: I need your help, okay? And I don't appreciate you blindly taking Hal's side without giving me a chance to explain myself.",
        "Susan: What's to explain? You're teaming up with Paul, against your husband, just to get back at Rosanna.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. Paul is my friend, and my husband is forbidding me to see him. Forget all of that. Rosanna deserves to pay for what she did to me.",
        "Susan: At the cost of your marriage?",
        "Emily: Hal's letting jealousy cloud his judgment, okay. He's treating me like a child.",
        "Susan: Well, maybe you should stop acting like one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You know, it just really upsets me that you would come here and plead your brother's case.",
        "Katie: He is the father of that child.",
        "Jennifer: As far as I'm concerned, Mike is the only father that this child will ever know. And the sooner that you, Craig and anyone else who thinks otherwise gets that through their heads, the better.",
        "Katie: Okay, listen, I understand your hesitation, but you need to --",
        "Jennifer: No, no, Katie. You don't. If you did, you wouldn't be here. Unless of course, that's not the reason you keep showing up at our doorstep.",
        "Katie: Oh, I thought we were past that, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, so did I. But maybe I was wrong.",
        "Katie: This is not about Mike.",
        "Jennifer: Then do us all a favor -- get a life and stay out of ours!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Oh. What do you want?",
        "Craig: I'm gonna offer you a little advice.",
        "Paul: I'm not interested.",
        "Craig: It's in your best interest. And Jennifer's. Because if you and Emily press charges against Rosanna, I will press charges against you, and Jennifer, and everybody else who tried to drive me out of town. The law's on my side. And I promise you, I will use it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Paul: You're sick, you know that? You are self-serving --",
        "Craig: Do we have a deal?",
        "Lily: Where do we stand?",
        "Keith: I don't know. After everything, do you think there still is a we? Oprah: Christopher reeve's wife",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's a nice bluff, Montgomery. But there's no way that you would put Jennifer through the stress of an accusation like that, knowing how risky it would be for the baby.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm giving you the opportunity to keep that from happening.",
        "Paul: Jennifer didn't have anything to do with you being run out of town. And you can't prove that I did, either. Or anybody else, for that matter. So stop wasting your time and get out.",
        "Craig: You're forgetting one person.",
        "Paul: Who's that?",
        "Craig: My sister, Margo. She told me everything. She's wracked with guilt, has a strong urge to confess.",
        "Paul: There's no way Margo would jeopardize her entire career just to help you.",
        "Craig: Don't underestimate the healing power of confession.",
        "Paul: Okay, Margo spilled. We took our chances. We knew the risks.",
        "Craig: And Jennifer?",
        "Paul: Jennifer didn't have anything to do with any of this, nothing at all.",
        "Craig: She's your sister, you'll protect her. For all I know, for all Margo knows, she masterminded this whole thing. Keep me from my baby, drive me out of town? My lawyers will have a field day. Or -- this whole mess could just go away. We go back to business as usual.",
        "Paul: You're sick, you know that? You are self-serving --",
        "Craig: Do we have a deal?",
        "Paul: I'll talk to Emily.",
        "Craig: I'm glad you see it my way.",
        "Paul: I'm only doing this for Jennifer.",
        "Craig: Sure, sure. And one other thing -- you told Emily Cabot was still alive. Rosanna told you that in confidence. She trusted you with that child's life. You put him at risk.",
        "Paul: I wasn't sure Rosanna was telling the truth. I'm still not.",
        "Craig: You thought she would lie about that child to -- to try to get you to forgive her for some -- you don't know her at all.",
        "Paul: Oh, and you do.",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes, I do. I saw her give up that child. I know exactly what this nightmare cost her.",
        "Paul: St. Craig to the rescue.",
        "Craig: It wasn't you, was it? If you really loved her the way you claim, you might've seen she was in trouble. You might have tracked her down, might've saved her. Instead, you chose your own bitterness? Lost her like Cabot. Like Rose. Who knows who else? You just never can save all these people you claim to love. Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I went to jail, falsely accused, because of what Rosanna did to me! Why am I the bad guy in wanting to see her punished for that?",
        "Susan: It's how you're going about it that troubles me.",
        "Emily: What, that I'm asking Paul for his help?",
        "Susan: Well, given his history, yes. And do you really want to see this go to trial? Rosanna's lawyers are gonna dig up all this stuff about you. You've made a few mistakes. The kind of mistakes that makes it hard for a jury to -- to see you as an injured party.",
        "Emily: I can't believe you're saying this to me. What, because I screwed up in my past, I don't deserve justice? That's insane.",
        "Susan: I'm not saying its right. I'm just trying to prepare you for what's going to happen!",
        "Emily: Will you stop it? This has nothing to do with the trial. You don't trust me. You're as bad as my husband.",
        "Susan: Hal Munson is the best thing that ever happened to you. He even took you back after that silly episode with Chris Hughes.",
        "Emily: Oh, oh, I see, of course. So if I'm asking my good friend Paul Ryan for help, then obviously I'm going to start sleeping with him, right? Because it only stands reason I just can't help myself, Mother, can I?",
        "Susan: Can you step outside yourself for a second, and think about your husband? Think about how he's feeling and how much the guy loves you?",
        "Emily: If he loved me, he would trust me. The truth of the matter is, Mother, my marriage never got back on track after what happened with Chris. And if Hal forgave me, it was in name only, because he sure as hell didn't forget. And obviously he's not the only one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hello? Hey, is anybody home? Emma? Hey.",
        "Carly: Holy smokes.",

        "Carly: Never mind me. Where the hell have you been? ---------------------------------------------------------------P",
        "Luke: I can't believe it. I've spent my whole life in this house. What happens next?",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Luke: Can we repair the house? Do we even want to? We're not a family any more, what's the point?",
        "Holden: Don't say that.",
        "Luke: This was the first thing you pulled out of this whole mess? How come?",
        "Holden: This is what matters most to me. Not the picture -- you guys. You're my family.",
        "Luke: Can we repair that?",
        "Holden: I don't know. When was the last time you spoke to your mother?",
        "Luke: She wasn't at Jack and Carly's house. I think she was at the hospital all night with Keith.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Holden: Hey. How's Carly doing?",
        "Jack: Well, she had a pretty rough night, but she's okay. How are you guys holding up?",
        "Holden: We've seen better days.",
        "Luke: Dad, is it okay if I -- kind of leave?",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure. Everything's going to be okay. We're gonna get through this.",
        "Jack: He's hit pretty hard, huh?",
        "Holden: Yeah. It's not the fire. It's everything.",
        "Jack: Have you talked to Lily?",
        "Holden: No, she spent the night at the hospital with Keith. I just needed to come over here and get the insurance papers.",
        "Jack: What's wrong?",
        "Holden: You know, this is funny. The house burns down, but the divorce papers, they're still intact. What does that tell you?",

        "Keith: Lily, I don't want you hanging around because you feel like you owe me something.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on, that's not why I'm here. But, you did save my life.",
        "Keith: I saw that look in your eyes when I kicked the door down. You were really scared of me.",
        "Lily: Yes. I was. I don't know what else to say about that.",
        "Keith: Well, you believed everything Sweeney wanted you to believe. That I was a killer. And I'd killed my own sister.",
        "Lily: There's no way I can expect you to forgive me for that.",
        "Keith: All that matters is that you're okay. Carly's okay. And Sweeney's dead. He can't hurt anybody again.",
        "Lily: You didn't look that surprised to see that Les was alive when he confronted us outside my house.",
        "Keith: Well, that's because I had a run-in with him at the guest house. He was bragging about how he cut the -- your brake cable, and how I'd be blamed for it, and that didn't happen, so he go pretty upset. He tied me up and he started the fire.",
        "Lily: It's horrible. Horrible day. But it's a new day, right? Fresh start?",
        "Keith: That's one way to look at it.",
        "Lily: So, where do we stand?",
        "Keith: I don't know. After everything, do you think there still is a we?",
        "Lily: You came into my life at a very difficult time. My marriage was falling apart. I was hurt and vulnerable. I was afraid to put the past behind me. I was afraid to move forward, and --",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, I was running from my past, too. I was telling lie after lie after lie so that you wouldn't find out about it.",
        "Lily: I don't know, it just -- it's horrible. I mean, how could I even think you were capable of killing Julia.",
        "Keith: Like I said, you believed what Sweeney wanted you to believe.",
        "Lily: All I know is I just wanna get past this, somehow. I mean, I don't know, if you can forgive me.",
        "Keith: Of course I forgive you. Lily, I love you. But I don't know if it's that simple. I know I not only lied to you, I lied to the cops. I planted that bee pollen in Sweeney's car. You know, I -- I -- I did the wrong things for the right reasons. And now I'm gonna have to, you know, turn myself in.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Keith: Well, I've gotta face the music here. I gotta -- I gotta do the right thing. I gotta, you know --",
        "Lily: No, no, you can't. No, I won't let you tell anybody anything.",
        "Holden: I guess everything has to come to an end at some point, huh, Jack?",
        "Jack: No. No, not everything. I don't believe that. Not the things worth fighting to keep.",
        "Holden: You know, Luke's was asking me what we were going to do about this house, and I couldn't give him an answer.",
        "Jack: Holden, it's just a house. It's not your life. And if I were you, I'd take a closer look at these divorce papers. Lily never signed them. What does that tell you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: The last I heard, you drugged Emily, you dumped Paul like yesterday's garbage and you split town without even telling me where you were going. And now you're saying that James Stenbeck was behind it?",
        "Rosanna: Well, yes. He wanted to hurt Paul. You know how vicious James can be.",
        "Carly: What made you go along with it?",
        "Rosanna: It doesn't matter.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, of course it matters. Have you seen Paul since you've been back?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Carly: And did you tell him everything you just told me?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Carly: And how did he react?",
        "Rosanna: He can't even look me in the eye. I -- I came back to try to make him understand.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's gonna be pretty difficult.",
        "Rosanna: I know.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, you can tell me. Does all this have something to do with Cabot's death?",
        "Rosanna: Why do you ask that?",
        "Carly: Because every other time that you've ever disappeared like that, it had something to do with Cabot. And the only thing that I can think of that would make you take orders from James Stenbeck --",
        "Rosanna: Carly, stop. I -- I -- I don't wanna talk about Cabot.",
        "Carly: Well, everybody is gonna be asking you these questions, Rosebud. And eventually, you're gonna have to answer them.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Cabot is at peace, now, okay? That's all anybody needs to know. It's all that matters. I've really missed you so much.",
        "Carly: I missed you, too.",
        "Rosanna: It sounds like you've really been through hell, as well, huh?",
        "Carly: My hell is over. Is yours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. Thank you. Well, my appointment's been moved up.",
        "Katie: I hate leaving things like this.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you know, what's left to talk about, Katie? All I need for you to do is respect my decision not to have Craig be a part of my baby's life.",
        "Katie: I just don't want to be your enemy.",
        "Jennifer: Then don't be. I have to go.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sorry if I've upset you. That is the last thing I came here to do.",
        "Jennifer: No, Katie, I just think you need to stop worrying so much about the well-being of my family, and focus more on your own. You have a wonderful husband who loves you very much. I'm sure he wants children. If you're so interested in babies, then maybe you two should start thinking about having one of your own.",
        "Katie: Henry and I aren't together anymore. We split up.",
        "Jennifer: What -- what happened?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter. I won't bother you anymore, Jennifer. I'm really sorry about this.",
        "Mike: Hey, Katie. What is it? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Emily: My mother refuses to help us.",
        "Paul: Why? What happened?",
        "Emily: Because Hal convinced that taking Rosanna to court is a bad idea.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Um, Emily, maybe she's right.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: Craig was just here.",
        "Emily: What did he say?",
        "Paul: He wants you to back off Rosanna.",
        "Emily: Don't tell me it worked.",
        "Paul: Well, I think maybe we should talk about this.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, am I losing my mind here? You let Craig Montgomery get to you. I don't believe this. You're worse than Hal you're worse than my mother. I thought I could trust you. You -- you are worse than all of them!",
        "Paul: Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey! Hear me out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Lily, I -- I don't know what kind of a future you and I are gonna have, but wherever we take it, whatever we do, we gotta start with a clean slate. You know, because, I don't want anything hanging over my head.",
        "Lily: They'll put you in jail.",
        "Keith: It wouldn't be for long. Would you wait for me?",
        "Lily: Oh, no. I'm not gonna let you do this. Come on, we've got a chance here to start over. The worst is behind us.",
        "Keith: That it is.",
        "Lily: Yes, it is. A new beginning. Let's think of it that way. A clean slate.",
        "Keith: Are you willing to give me one?",
        "Lily: If you're willing to give me one.",
        "Keith: Willing? I'm more than willing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not trying to stir up any trouble, Mike. I'm really not. I just want everyone to get along and it's tough, because I feel like I'm in the middle of everything.",
        "Mike: You mean Jennifer and Craig.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I know how this can work. I just want to help.",
        "Mike: How you gonna help?",
        "Katie: I can talk to Craig. He'll listen to me. I can keep him in line, make sure he doesn't do anything rash.",
        "Mike: Well, you certainly know him better than we do.",
        "Katie: So, you understand what I'm trying to say.",
        "Mike: Of course I understand. Look, I appreciate you trying to protect Jennifer.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, she doesn't quite see it that way.",
        "Mike: How does she see it?",
        "Jennifer: You're still here?",
        "Mike: Katie offered to smooth things over with Craig. Try to keep him out of our business.",
        "Jennifer: Is that a fact? Funny, I thought we already discussed this, and that I made myself perfectly clear. And which part of stay out of our lives didn't you understand?",

        "Rosanna: Wow, she's getting so big. She's so beautiful. Well, you sure must have your hands full.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, yeah. And with J.J. in the family now, there's never a dull moment.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Listen, why don't you bring them all by Fairwinds. You know, it'd just be so great to have the house full. To hear the sound kids laughing.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, just give Paul some time. He's hurt. He's angry and that's understandable. But I know how much he loved you. I don't think love like that just disappears.",
        "Rosanna: He despises me now.",
        "Carly: Give him a chance. He'll come around.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know, I -- I hope you're right. Anyway, I've got to take off.",
