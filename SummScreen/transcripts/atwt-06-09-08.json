        "Jack: Clearly, I'm tripping over your skateboard.",
        "J.J.: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Jack: Didn't your mother tell you that she was working at Metro tonight -- that I was coming over?",
        "J.J.: Um, yeah, I guess.",
        "Jack: What's going on with you? You seem a little out of it.",
        "J.J.: Well, I'm fine. It's just my throat hurts a little bit.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Nice try. Listen, put the video game away and the skateboard away. Start on the chores. All right? Now, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Cole, why are you here?",
        "Cole: I heard about how great you're doing. You got your own jewelry business and everything, right?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. Who told you that?",
        "Cole: It's not exactly a secret. You been hanging out with some pretty classy folks these days.",
        "Sofie: Who I hang out with is none of your business. Not anymore.",
        "Cole: Looks like you and Barbara Ryan are getting along. Never would've seen that one coming.",
        "Sofie: What -- what -- what are you doing here, Cole?",
        "Cole: Just wanted to say hi, congratulate you on how you're doing. Believe it or not, I'm proud of you, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Like hell you are. You want something. You always want something. What is it?",
        "Cole: I deserve that. And you deserve so much better than anything I could ever give you. I'm glad to see that you're finally getting it.",
        "Sofie: Okay, I'm not listening to this. I'm not listening. I -- I don't care why you're here. I don't care what you want from me, so get out.",

        "Barbara: Sofie? It's Barbara. I need to talk to you.",
        "Cole: Why don't you want to let her in?",
        "Sofie: Because she's the last thing that I need right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What if this isn't the first time she falsely accused someone? There could be a pattern here, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's kind of a long shot, don't you think?",
        "Meg: It's the only shot we have. We need to find out more about her -- where she comes from, if there's anybody else out there that she hurt.",
        "Paul: I guess nothing would be worse than hanging out here and waiting. I'll get started.",
        "Meg: No, no. No, you won't.",

        "Sofie: Get in the bathroom. Go, go! Now, now! Go, go! Hi, Barbara. Sorry it took so long to get the door.",
        "Barbara: Don't worry about it. What I have to say won't take long.",
        "Sofie: Do you want to get some tea?",
        "Barbara: What did you say?",
        "Sofie: Oh, we could go downstairs, talk over tea. I have some great ideas for some new, beautiful designs that I want to go over with you.",
        "Barbara: I don't think you understand, Sofie. I'm not here to have tea with you. I'm not here to make small talk with you. I'm here to make sure that you understand that our little business arrangement is finished.",
        "Sofie: You helped me set up my business because you believed in my designs. Nothing about that has changed, so why don't you go talk to Paul --",
        "Barbara: I already talked to Paul right after I finished bailing him out because of your phony rape charge! If you think that Paul wants anything more to do with you, you're more delusional than I thought! Paul hates you, and I sure as hell don't like you very much.",
        "Cole: Seems like I showed up at quite an interesting time.",
        "Sofie: Shut up. Get out and --",
        "Cole: Ooh, whoa, whoa. I don't think so. Not until I get up to speed. Sofie, what the hell did you do?",

        "Parker: Hi, Dad.",
        "Jack: What are you reading?",
        "Parker: Just a book.",
        "Jack: About?",
        "Parker: I don't know. I haven't really gotten that far into it yet.",

        "Janet: Hi, Cutie.",
        "Liberty: What's with the basket?",
        "Janet: This is a little homemade manicotti, a little chicken parm, extra sauce -- just how you like it. Who died?",
        "Liberty: Okay, thanks for the food, Mom, but I know you're really busy, so maybe this is just not really the --",
        "Brad: Hi, Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi. Oh, hi, Bradley. Listen, I just brought over a little homemade thank you for being so understanding about that whole Bud business the other day.",
        "Brad: You're welcome.",
        "Liberty: Okay, thanks, Mom. Bye, Mom.",
        "Janet: Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I just want to tell Katie how to heat this up, because if you nuke it, it'll die.",
        "Brad: Well, Katie's out of town for a few days, so why don't you tell me how?",
        "Liberty: Okay, if it involves a stove, I think you should stay away.",
        "Janet: Wait. Hold on. I got it. This will only take two seconds. Don't mind me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You have to stay far away from Sofie, from anyone who even knows her. The last thing you want is to be accused of intimidating witnesses.",
        "Paul: Witnesses? Witnesses to what? Nothing happened.",
        "Meg: You and I know that, but we have to prove it. So let me see what I can find out.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Meg: Excuse me?",
        "Paul: No. I don't want you anywhere near Sofie's insanity.",
        "Meg: Well, it's too late. You're involved, so I'm involved.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I don't want you any more involved than you have to be.",
        "Meg: You know what I have to be, Paul? I have to be absolutely sure that I have done everything possible to get you out of this mess that Sofie has dragged you in. So you either let me help you or I go behind your back and do it anyway. Which will it be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh! What did this kitchen ever do to you?",
        "Brad: I stepped away for a second to answer the phone. Next thing you know, code red.",
        "Janet: Oh, my -- well, I got to clean this up. I owe Katie at least that much.",
        "Brad: Well, I don't think she's really gonna notice.",

        "Janet: Get out! Out! Out! I need elbow room.",
        "Brad: Is she serious?",
        "Liberty: She's serious. Whenever she gets all Martha Stewart like that, you better just get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I meant it, Cole. I want you to leave.",
        "Cole: You can't blame me for being curious. When I left, I was the bad guy and you were poor little Sofie. So what changed?",
        "Sofie: Paul changed. He ruined everything.",
        "Cole: Oh, here we go again. It's never your fault, is it? Always the victim.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you get out right now! You can't talk to me like that anymore. Not anymore!",
        "Cole: Calm down. Just calm down.",
        "Sofie: I said get out.",
        "Cole: I will. But just calm down, okay? I don't like seeing you like this. I want to know what happened.",
        "Sofie: Why? It's not like you care.",
        "Cole: Of course I do. Look, I never stopped caring about you, and if Ryan did something, I want to know about it. It sounds like you could use a friend right now, Sofie. I know it's a little late, but maybe I can finally be one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This is kind of a crazy little fight. I'm angry with you because you want to help me.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and this little fight you're going to lose, so you might as well give in gracefully.",
        "Paul: Really? Okay, I give in gracefully.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Paul: No, thank you. Thank you for believing in me.",
        "Meg: I know you, Paul. I know you could never do what Sofie's accused you of. And I'm gonna prove it. There's something out there, and I know it. I just have to find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So they arrested him?",
        "Sofie: Barbara said he's out on bail now.",
        "Cole: Wow.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. He took advantage of me. He knew how I felt about him, and he led me on.",
        "Cole: Was it all about the money? So he could make a bundle off of you and your designs?",
        "Sofie: Well, obviously. And then -- and then when I finally figured out the truth, when I told him that I knew he was only using me --",
        "Cole: That's when he --",
        "Sofie: That's when he -- he raped me. He took everything from me -- my brand- new company, my heart, my hope. I -- I don't have anything left.",
        "Cole: Oh, sure you do.",
        "Sofie: No. No, I don't. Without him, I have nothing.",
        "Cole: Sofie, you have the whole world. You're still beautiful, still smart, still talented. Any man would be lucky to have you.",
        "Sofie: Then why doesn't he -- then why did you leave me?",
        "Cole: Because I was crazy. I couldn't see the best thing that's ever happened to me even when it was right in front of my nose.",
        "Sofie: And now you can, is that what you're saying?",
        "Cole: If it's not too late.",
        "Sofie: I don't know why I should believe you, Cole.",
        "Cole: Because maybe I can help you now. Maybe I can finally take care of you the way I should have all along. Will you at least let me try?",
        "Sofie: I don't know.",
        "Cole: Let me show you how sorry I am, huh? Let me make it up to you.",
        "[Sofie and Cole make love]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: That answers my question.",
        "Liberty: Talk to yourself much?",
        "Janet: You're still mad at me.",
        "Liberty: No, I wasn't. I came to do that whole kiss-and-make-up thing.",
        "Janet: Well, what stopped you?",
        "Liberty: Walking in on you with a black eye. You know, you, like, warn me about guys and about sex and you're all up on me to be responsible and smart, and then you go and pick up a guy who hurts you. Mom, your love life is a disaster area.",
        "Janet: Yeah. You're telling me something I don't know? Why do you think I am so worried about you, my dear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker, wait. Wait a second. If you have any questions about anything, you know you can always talk to me, right?",
        "Parker: No, I really do not want to talk about this right now.",
        "Jack: I think talking about it's a hell of a lot more helpful than reading about it. But if you don't want to talk about it, fine. I understand.",
        "Parker: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Just -- just so you know, odds are I had most of the same questions and worries when I was your age.",
        "Parker: I really doubt that.",
        "Jack: Oh, no. My friends and I, we used to refer to books all the time -- or magazines. Problem with that is books don't tell you how to deal with the real, live person. That only comes with experience.",
        "Parker: And that's the problem. I don't have any.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, this author -- what's his name? May I? Playa Dog? Really? Listen, whatever his experience was, I can guarantee you it's not gonna be your experience. And if you refer to that -- if you refer to that as some kind of, I don't know, guide, you could come off looking like a real jerk.",
        "J.J.: Hey, Dad, I'm gonna go to my room for a little while, okay?",
        "Jack: You feel all right?",
        "J.J.: Yeah, I'm fine. It's just -- just my throat.",
        "Parker: Dad, if I did have a question --",
        "Jack: Well, I can't guarantee you I'd have the answer, but I'd give it my best shot.",
        "Parker: It's about this girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah.",
        "Janet: Uh-huh. See? Now, this is what a kitchen is supposed to look, and smell like. Dinner will be ready in five minutes.",
        "Liberty: Thanks for the manicotti, Mom, but we don't want to keep you.",
        "Janet: Right. Okay. I got it. All right, cool. I'll just come back and pick up the pans later.",
        "Brad: Hey, Janet, you cooked, you cleaned. You should at least stay and eat with us, you know? Unless, of course, you have other plans, which I totally understand.",
        "Janet: No, really -- really?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh, yeah. I don't want to butt in or anything.",
        "Brad: Your mother's not butting in, is she, liberty? Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Okay, fine. Can we just eat, then, and get this whole thing over with?",
        "Brad: Hey, you could be a little more welcoming, okay?",
        "Liberty: Mom, would you please join us for a lovely dinner?",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, really? Of course, but just 'cause you asked me so nicely.",
        "Brad: Great. You cook, we'll set the table.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no! You don't set the table. Go in there and relax, and I'll let you know when everything's ready, okay?",
        "Brad: Well, I don't want you to go through so much trouble. I mean --",
        "Liberty: Okay, seriously, come on. If you want to eat within the next 24 hours, you will let her do it herself. Because whatever Janet wants, Janet gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Does this girl have a name?",
        "Parker: Does it matter?",
        "Jack: No, it doesn't matter. So, there's this girl --",
        "Parker: And I guess I like her, but I don't know if she likes me. I mean, I don't know if she really likes me. And, I mean, I'm a little afraid to do something because I'm thinking that maybe if I do and she doesn't like me, that I'm going to end up looking like a loser.",
        "Jack: Right. Parker, if you like this girl and you think she likes you, then just go for it. Take your chances.",
        "Parker: But what if I go for it and I mess it up and I come off looking like a lame little kid? I mean, I'm trying to make it look like I have some experience.",
        "Jack: Listen, I am -- I am far from an expert on women, and I can guarantee you that this Playa Dog isn't the expert that he claims to be. One thing I know for sure. If you pretend to be someone you're not, she's gonna know. And that's when you're gonna come off like a real loser.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Wow.",
        "Liberty: You really went all out.",
        "Brad: Wow.",
        "Janet: Well, I hope Katie doesn't mind I used her good china, but sometimes a meal doesn't feel like a meal to me unless you make a little fuss.",
        "Liberty: I thought you were kidding. We've never eaten like this at home.",
        "Janet: What -- yes, we have, on special occasions.",
        "Liberty: So how is this a special occasion?",
        "Janet: The three of us having dinner together under your father's roof. This must be a wonderful moment for you.",
        "Liberty: Okay, Mom, get off of it. This is not about me. This is completely about you, so stop pretending.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: We still got it, haven't we, Sofie?",
        "Sofie: It's just like I remembered it. Being with you like this -- I never thought it would happen again.",
        "Cole: I must've been crazy to give that up. Crazy to give you up. But I'm back now.",
        "Sofie: You have no idea what that means to hear it from you. Almost makes it all worth it.",
        "Cole: First thing I'm gonna do now that I'm back is help you fix this situation with Paul Ryan.",
        "Sofie: Fix it how?",
        "Cole: We have to think about this very carefully. Putting him in jail doesn't do us any good.",
        "Sofie: But that's where he belongs.",
        "Cole: But look at it this way. Wouldn't it hurt him just as much if we made him pay for what he'd done in a way that would help you? Sofie, you got him over a barrel.",
        "Sofie: This isn't about the money, Cole. It was never about money for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi, Mom. Are you okay?",
        "Barbara: I just came from seeing Sofie. I wanted to make sure that she realized that our business arrangement with her was over.",
        "Paul: Right. So, did she accuse me of something else now?",
        "Barbara: No, she offered me tea. I don't think she thinks any of this is real. I didn't realize till that moment how far gone she was. I almost feel sorry for the kid.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I would feel sorry for her if her craziness didn't put me in front of a judge.",
        "Barbara: Exactly. Now, I've got this attorney coming in from L.A. we'll meet with him tomorrow at the Lakeview to strategize. Does Meg want to be there?",
        "Paul: She's not here. I'll ask her.",
        "Barbara: Is she coming back?",
        "Paul: Okay, look, I understand why you would ask that, but Meg is 100% in my corner on this.",
        "Barbara: Of course she is. Of course she is. Now, when that attorney gets here, we're going to make sure that they realize --",
        "Paul: Mom, its okay. I'm okay.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, you are, aren't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. With Meg on my side, I feel like there's nothing I can't handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Thank you for coming.",
        "Mike: Yeah, sure. Is there some problem at the construction site?",
        "Meg: The only problem I have right now is Sofie's accusation.",
        "Mike: And you want to talk to me about that?",
        "Meg: I want to do more than talk to you, Mike. I want your help. Paul didn't rape Sofie, and I need your help to prove it.",
        "Mike: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Meg: Look, I know Paul can lie, and I know he's capable of bad things. But I also know he didn't do what Sofie said he did.",
        "Mike: Because you choose to believe him?",
        "Meg: Of course I believe him! Because Sofie's story doesn't hold water. I saw her that night, long before you did, Mike. And she didn't say a word about being raped. She said that she and Paul had made love.",
        "Mike: Probably because she was ashamed. She blamed herself.",
        "Meg: There was no shame. There was anger. A lot of anger. She tore Paul's place apart. You saw it. By the time I got there, her hands were bleeding from the glass she had broken. I tried to help her, but she didn't want me anywhere near her. She was vicious, Mike. She insisted that she was meant to be with Paul, and not me.",
        "Mike: The girl that I saw at the Lakeview that night was nothing like that.",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course not. 'Cause she had time to cool down and plot some kind of strategy by then. So she was back in her helpless mode.",
        "Mike: I think you're seeing what you want to see.",
        "Meg: No, you're seeing what she wants you to see. You're her victim, Mike, just the way Paul is.",
        "Mike: Do you really think I'm that stupid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Listen to me, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: I'm done listening. I'm not blackmailing Paul.",
        "Cole: I'm not talking about blackmail. I'm talking about payback. And don't tell me that isn't what you want, too.",
        "Sofie: I should have never let you in. I should have never let you in.",
        "Cole: But you did, 'cause you wanted to. Because you know I'm the only one who really gets you. I know where you came from.",
        "Sofie: Get out, Cole.",
        "Cole: Let's just tell the truth for once. Truth is, you're no better than I am.",
        "Sofie: Okay, get out of my life. Get out of my life and don't come back this time.",
        "Cole: You don't think things through, Sofie. That's why you needed me to look after you before and why you still need me now. Think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, I think you're a decent and honest guy, Mike. But you have no idea what this girl is capable of.",
        "Mike: She's capable of being hurt by Paul just like you are.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? Let's just focus on Sofie here. If what I'm saying is true --",
        "Mike: Which it isn'T.",
        "Meg: But if it is, she needs help -- serious mental help, because she doesn't know what's true or false anymore.",
        "Mike: And if you're wrong?",
        "Meg: Well, then the man that I love has committed an unforgivable crime and I could never look at Paul in the face again, let alone stay with him.",
        "Mike: What do you want me to do?",
        "Meg: Okay, we need to get personal information about Sofie. We need to trace her background, see if she has shown any kind of signs of mental disturbance in the past.",
        "Mike: And if she hasn't? If she's telling the truth?",
        "Meg: Well, then you won't have lost anything.",
        "Mike: But you will.",
        "Meg: That's a chance I'm willing to take.",
        "Mike: I'll think about it, Meg. That's all I can promise you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay, fine. Maybe it does mean more to me than it does you. But you know why? Because the three of us under the same roof together -- that is something that I was not -- I couldn't give that to you when you were growing up. So, yeah, this is very special to me.",
        "Brad: Liberty knows how much work you put in to making this dinner nice, don't you, Liberty?",
        "Janet: All right, fine. Fine. You don't want to call this a family dinner, let's just call it three people sitting down to eat some manicotti. Come on, let's go. Let's eat.",
        "Brad: Come on! Come on. It smells great.",
        "Janet: Here, hand me your plate. Crusty corner. Just how you like it, Sweetheart. There you go.",
        "Brad: You okay?",
        "Janet: It's the -- it's the onions.",
        "Brad: You chopped onions a while ago. What's wrong? You really do owe your mother an apology.",
        "Janet: No. No, no, no. You know what it is? I forgot dessert. I forgot dessert, and I can't believe how stupid I was to do that.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, if you want, there's a supermarket a few blocks away. I'll just run and go get some ice cream.",
        "Liberty: I'll get it.",
        "Brad: No, no, no. You sit down. I will go get it. Eat the dinner with your mom.",
        "Janet: Bradley, don't do that, because if you go, everything will be cold by the time you get back.",
        "Brad: Mmm. Oh. That tastes great. Oh, really good. Okay, I will be right back. Hold down the fort. That's so good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I'm not trying to act like a player. I just don't want to come off as being completely clueless.",
        "Jack: Then just go with your instincts, Buddy. Listen, if anything happens between the two of you, it's gonna happen on its own.",
        "Parker: But I'm the guy. I'm supposed to make it happen.",
        "Jack: One rule about relationships -- there are no rules. You don't do anything until you're ready. And, listen, maybe that's it. Maybe you're not ready. And that's no big deal. You got plenty of time. Listen, you're gonna be going off to camp soon anyway. Maybe by the time you get back, you'll have figured some things out, without Playa Dog's help.",
        "Parker: Another summer at an all-boys camp? It's not likely.",
        "Jack: Oh, are you kidding me? You've been looking forward to going to this camp all spring long. Once you get out there, you're gonna remember how much fun you had every single year. Don't you worry about it. That girl will still be here when you get back.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Is it good?",
        "Liberty: You know it's good, Mom.",
        "Janet: Yeah, I know. That's because when I cook for you, I cook from the heart.",
        "Liberty: Do you slap from your heart, too?",
        "Janet: I was wrong. I was wrong to do that. And I am so sorry, Libby. I can't tell you.",
        "Liberty: Don't tell me, Mom. Please. I don't want to hear it.",
        "Janet: But you have to know why I did it, right?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I totally know why you did it, Mom. Because you just do what you want to do when you want to do it.",
        "Janet: No, Baby, that's not true. I do what I have to do to protect you because you're my life.",
        "Liberty: Then why don't you talk to me like I'm someone who has half a brain?",
        "Janet: Oh, Baby, because when I see you getting in over your head, it scares me. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. You know what worse than getting manhandled by some guy? The thought that some jerk could come along and do the same thing to you someday. That I can't take!",
        "Liberty: Mom, don't yell. I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Janet: I hope so. I hope so, because you're my world, and I need you. Oh, Baby.",
        "Liberty: Mom, you drive me so crazy sometimes.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, I love you, too.",
        "Brad: Ice cream man is here.",
        "Janet: Oh, ice cream! Ice cream! Now I can eat the rest of my meal in peace. Bradley.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Janet: Butter pecan -- it's my favorite. I can't believe you remembered.",
        "Brad: No, actually, I just -- well, if it's your favorite, that's great. Yeah, I'm glad.",
        "Liberty: Janet scores again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: J.J.! Parker! The game's starting.",
        "Parker: J.J.'s not coming down. He's already asleep.",
        "Jack: Really? He was complaining about a sore throat. I guess if he's coming down with a cold, he's gonna need the extra rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, finally. Did you find anything out?",
        "Meg: No, not yet. But I'm hopeful. I asked Mike to help us get some information on Sofie.",
        "Paul: Mike was the one who convinced Sofie to go to the police in the first place!",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Paul: So Mike Kasnoff is the last person you should be talking to.",
        "Meg: Mike is the only one we know who can get close enough to Sofie to find out the truth.",
        "Paul: He's close enough to Sofie to tell her what we're doing, and then we'll never get anywhere. Meg, what were you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hi, Mike! I didn't expect to see you.",
        "Mike: I know Paul made bail. I wanted to make sure you were all right, that he didn't come by to try to harass you.",
        "Sofie: No. No, I haven't -- I haven't seen him. Come in.",
        "Mike: Thanks. And I wanted to say that if Paul bothers you, you pick up the phone, call the police, and then me, in that order.",
        "Sofie: I will. Thank you. It -- you don't know how much it means to me knowing that somebody cares what happens to me.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm sure I'm not the only one.",
        "Sofie: No, but you are. You are. I really don't have anyone else.",
        "Mike: No family out there?",
        "Sofie: No, not since my grandma died. She raised me, so when she was gone, that was it for me as far as family goes.",
        "Mike: Well, what about friends, people you grew up with?",
        "Sofie: I don't really talk to them anymore. I send a card to the nuns every once in awhile, but I haven't done that recently.",
        "Mike: You're a catholic school kid, too? I went to the Carmelite School.",
        "Sofie: Sacred Heart, Winnetka.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Janet, dinner totally rocked.",
        "Janet: Are you sure? I mean, really. Because the manicotti could have been a little bit under seasoned --",
        "Brad: Everything was great. It was great. But I hate to eat and run, but the game's about to start.",
        "Janet: Whoa, whoa, whoa! The Cubs game?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Are you a fan?",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? Don't you remember how much time I used to spend at baseball games when we were kids? I love baseball. You know, Brad, it might take me a little while to clean up the dishes, and by the time I get back to the Lakeview, I'll have missed the beginning of the game. Do you mind terribly if I stay here and watch just the beginning? Please?",
        "Brad: Yeah, sure. Yeah, whatever.",
        "Janet: Great.",
        "Liberty: Okay, then I am actually gonna go. I'm gonna go catch up on my summer-school reading.",
        "Brad: Good call.",
        "Liberty: And I did just remember that I left my textbook over at Al's, so I'm gonna go get it.",
        "Janet: Hey! Hey, it's starting. It's starting.",
        "Brad: Oh, great. Oh, yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh. Look who's --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, are you kidding me?",
        "Parker: Did you see that?",
        "Jack: I told you Zambrano was no joke. You got to listen to your old man. He knows what he's talking about. Listen, I'm gonna grab some popcorn. You want a refill on that soda?",
        "Parker: No, I'm good. You know what? I'm pretty tired. I think I'm gonna crash.",
        "Jack: What is going on with you and J.J.? What's going on? Are you coming down with something?",
        "Parker: I don't know. Maybe. But I should get some rest, like you said.",
        "Jack: Well, it's no fun watching it all by myself. I got no one to explode fists with.",
        "Parker: You can give me a play by play in the morning, okay? Are they putting Kerry in?",
        "Jack: No! No, no, no, no, no! Come on, you can't be pulling out Zambrano now, for crying out loud!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: That pitch was out.",
        "Brad: You don't know anything about the game.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? I know when a pitch is out, and that pitch was in freakin' Brookl",
        "Brad: Piniella knows what he's doing. Just watch. See! I told you!",
        "Janet: All right, when you're right, you're right.",
        "Brad: Damn right I'm right.",
        "Janet: I always had the best time watching the baseball with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Oh, well, hey, it took you long enough.",
        "Parker: Okay, so why are you so desperate to see me?",
        "Liberty: I don't do desperate.",
        "Parker: Okay, then you texted me because --",
        "Liberty: Because I knew you needed my help and you were too scared to ask, so I thought I would just make it easy on you.",
        "Parker: Okay, assuming that I was crazy enough to need your help in the first place, what exactly are you gonna help me with?",
        "Liberty: You need someone to keep you from having a totally lame summer vacation, right? So I thought we could start by going to the lake. You can swim, right?",
        "Parker: Of course I can swim, but aren't you supposed to be in summer school?",
        "Liberty: Not until you find a way to get me out of it.",
        "Parker: Okay, since when do you need my help getting out you out of school?",
        "Liberty: Since I've been told I will lose my e-access and my phone.",
        "Parker: Okay, I have a crazy idea, so brace yourself. You're actually gonna go to summer school. And then maybe if you go to summer school, you could actually graduate high school before you're 80.",
        "Liberty: Oh. Well, even when I am 80, I will still be having a hell of a lot more fun than you.",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah, because summer school is so banging.",
        "Liberty: What are your big summer plans?",
        "Parker: I'm going to camp.",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God. You're kidding, right? \"Make macaroni art, sit in a little circle and tell ghost stories\" camp?",
        "Parker: I'm not a camper, I am a counselor in training.",
        "Liberty: Dude, your life is even sadder than I thought.",
        "Parker: Look, I'm not gonna be away the entire summer, so maybe when I get back --",
        "Liberty: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You have a great time telling little rugrats how to sing the camp song, because when you're gone, Dylan will have a great time bringing me to the lake whenever I want.",
        "Parker: Great. So you'll spend the summer the way you want, and I'll spend the summer the way I want to.",
        "Liberty: Well, great.",
        "Parker: Fine.",
        "Liberty: Fine. And you know what? Maybe when you come back from camp, you can teach me how to make a lanyard.",
        "Parker: Probably be the only thing you learn all summer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: This game is no longer worth watching. Janet? Janet? I guess this means you're spending the night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: How's it going?",
        "Jack: Awful. Piniella screwed it all up. It's not worth watching anymore. I thought you were crashing.",
        "Parker: I had some last-minute stuff to do.",
        "Jack: Getting ready for camp?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I was thinking about that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I bet you were.",
        "Parker: I was thinking that maybe I was a little bit too old for it.",
        "Jack: What? You've been talking about being a C.I.T. ever since last summer.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I know. But I was thinking that --",
        "Jack: Is this about that girl?",
        "Parker: No. No. I just thought that it might be a good idea to get a job here because a lot of my friends are gonna be home for the summer, and I thought that maybe we could hang out.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen. Listen to me for a second. Just sleep on it. We'll discuss it in the morning, okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Oh, look. My mom is still here. Surprise, surprise.",
        "Brad: Did you get your book?",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm. I stole it back from those big, bad book thieves.",
        "Brad: You were gone an awfully long time.",
        "Liberty: I walked slow. Soaking in those Oakdale summer nights. Hey, don't you think we should give her the boot, tell her to go home?",
        "Brad: No, no. Let her stay on the couch. After she worked so hard to make us that dinner and clean up this place? You know, the least we could do is let her sleep.",
        "Liberty: Well, she sure knows how to make herself at home.",
        "Brad: Come on. It's no big deal. Let's go.",
        "Liberty: Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So, you're Winnetka born and bred?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. I don't want to bore you with my really, really dull past.",
        "Mike: You're not boring me.",
        "Sofie: Well, then, maybe we can talk about it again sometime when I'm not so sleepy.",
        "Mike: Yeah, of course. And remember, call if you need anything.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, police first, then you. I got it. Uh, Mike. Thank you again, really. It's -- it's so nice knowing that I can trust someone.",
        "Mike: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mike wouldn't tell Sofie what I asked him to do.",
        "Paul: Mike wants you. He'll do whatever he has to and he'll do whatever it takes to get you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Mike, hi.",
        "Mike: I found out something. I don't know if it'll be much of a help, but it's a start.",
        "Meg: Well, that's great. Listen, I'll come meet you.",
        "Mike: It's late. I don't want you to drive somewhere at this time, and I don't think I'm too welcome over at Paul's.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I think you're right about that. Okay, I will meet you tomorrow. Thanks, Mike. Mike thinks he's got something.",
        "Paul: Thinks. That doesn't sound very definite.",
        "Meg: Why don't we wait and see what it is?",
        "Paul: I don't like -- I don't like you even talking to this guy. Mike has a real incentive to not help me.",
        "Meg: You know, there's no chance for Mike and me, and he knows that. I already told him I love you.",
        "Paul: You did?",
        "Meg: Yeah. I do love you, Paul. I never really stopped.",
        "Paul: I guess nothing else matters.",
        "Meg: Come here. Oh. We will get you out of this.",
        "Paul: With you on my side, I can't lose.",
