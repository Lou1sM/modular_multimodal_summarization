        "Bob: Hey. Thanks for letting me stop by. It saves me some time.",
        "Luke: Well, of course. I was going to work from home anyways today. Uh, can I get you some coffee?",
        "Bob: No thanks. I'm hoping that you're available for a meeting today.",
        "Luke: About the new wing?",
        "Bob: Peripheral, yes. The, uh, hospital board is investigating the possibility of selling the hospital to a company called Invicta Health Corporation.",
        "Luke: You want to sell the hospital?",
        "Bob: Well, it's not a done deal. I mean, there's pros and cons. But we want to court this buyer, see what the deal is before we make a decision one way or the other.",
        "Luke: And -- where do I fit in?",
        "Bob: Well, I'm having lunch with the representative of Invicta.",
        "Luke: So what's the name?",
        "Bob: Mona Cross. Why?",
        "Luke: I'll do some research, look her up. Suit and tie?",
        "Bob: No, no. No, you can be casual. We'll just give her some information about the hospital.",
        "Luke: And the new wing.",
        "Bob: And you're a major donor, a charming guy. I thought you'd be an asset to the meeting.",
        "Luke: So, the pitch is \"Memorial is cutting-edge.\"",
        "Bob: Uh-huh, and with doctors like Dr. Oliver, we're -- we're looking pretty good. He has already said that he would attend.",
        "Luke: Wait. You want to leave this woman with a good impression?",
        "Bob: That's why I need your help. Uh, Dr. Oliver is brilliant.",
        "Luke: And abrasive.",
        "Bob: And then some.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Luke: So, where and when?",
        "Bob: Well, Ms. Cross didn't give me much notice, so uh, the Lakeview in about an hour from now.",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Bob: Great. Hey, listen -- do you think you could get Noah to drop by?",
        "Luke: Noah? Why?",
        "Bob: Well, he's kind of exhibit \"A\" to what the hospital and Dr. Oliver and -- and the new wing can accomplish.",
        "Luke: Dr. Hughes, I am sure that Noah would love to help you, but I don't think he'd be willing to help Reid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: You're continuing to show signs of improvement. I'm going to increase the dosage of your prescription. Use those drops I gave you on each eye four times daily. You can, uh, book another follow-up appointment with the nurse outside for two weeks from now. You have any questions?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I was curious about when you started having feelings for my boyfriend.",
        "Reid: Second or third time I laid eyes on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I cannot believe you just asked me that question.",
        "Paul: All I'm saying is that if the tables were turned and it was Tom Hughes in that hospital bed --",
        "Emily: No, Tom -- Tom Hughes hasn't had any psychotic breaks.",
        "Paul: If someone had accused him of taking methadone the same way somebody has accused Meg of taking methadone --",
        "Emily: Meg was here the day the methadone disappeared.",
        "Paul: So were you. And it's a reasonable question.",
        "Emily: No -- not if you know me. Not if you love me it isn't. Okay, you know what? I will answer your ridiculous question again. I did not drug Meg. Oh, so it's not enough that you asked the question? You don't believe my answer?",
        "Paul: Wait a second.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? In case you're having any more doubts, here's another truth for you. I love Eliza. You know how concerned I've been about Meg being around her.",
        "Paul: Meg is her mother.",
        "Emily: Meg is sick! Don't you understand?! She was released way too soon from that psychiatric hospital!",
        "Paul: The doctors would not have let her out of a psychiatric hospital if she wasn't prepared to spend time with her own daughter.",
        "Emily: I am trying to tell you, I know she's shaky. I know she is beyond shaky. Why would I do something like that? Why would I push her to the edge, knowing how it would affect Eliza?!",
        "Barbara: For that precise reason. You want Meg out of her own daughter's life, and you want her out of your life with Paul.",
        "Paul: This is a private conversation, Mother.",
        "Barbara: You knew that if you drugged Meg, there would be no judge that would let her near her daughter, and you could step right in and be Eliza's mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Meg, you all right? Should I get a doctor?",
        "Meg: You need to help me, please. Please.",
        "Alison: Okay. All right. Let's try to get you back in bed.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. She'll listen to you, okay? You need to talk to her. She'll listen.",
        "Alison: Who? Dr. Wagner?",
        "Meg: No. No, Emily, your sister. You have to talk to her.",
        "Alison: About what?",
        "Meg: You need to stop her from trying to destroy my life, from trying to take my baby away from me. Alison, please.",
        "Alison: Meg, I'm sure that's not what she's trying to do.",
        "Meg: She is! She is, and you have to help me. Emily's trying to make everybody believe that I stole the methadone and that I'm making myself sick. And, Alison, I would never, ever do something like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Could you please go away so I can talk to my husband in private?",
        "Barbara: Oh, of course, of course. Why don't you tell him, though, what you said about Meg?",
        "Emily: Oh, for God's sake, don't leave us hanging. What did I supposedly say to Meg?",
        "Barbara: She said that it might be helpful if Meg were locked up in a mental hospital.",
        "Paul: You said that?",
        "Barbara: Yes, she did.",
        "Emily: Yes, I said it. I said practically the same thing to you. Meg is sick. She needs help, okay? Maybe I shouldn't have had this conversation with your mother, but I did.",
        "Barbara: You know, you better stop trying to spin this and just admit what you've done.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? I -- we need to talk, but I'm not doing it in front of her, so I will see you at home.",
        "Barbara: Well, that sounded like a confession to me. Honey, I know how difficult it must be to think about the fact that Emily has done despicable things to Meg, drugging her, but -- you know, you got to take some action here. You don't want a woman like that raising your daughter.",
        "Paul: Emily's right. You need to stay out of our business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: How often have you done it?",
        "Reid: I've done lots of things with lots of people. You're going to have to narrow that one down for me.",
        "Noah: How many times have you hit on other patients' boyfriends -- or girlfriends for that matter? Maybe you don't discriminate, so long as they're vulnerable and in need of your medical help.",
        "Reid: You can think what you want, Noah.",
        "Noah: Is that why you specialize in blind patients? Must make it easier when the injured party can't see what's going on right in front of their noses.",
        "Reid: If we're going to continue our professional relationship, you need to drop this.",
        "Noah: We're not going to continue anything. I think I'll be able to go another day without your expertise.",
        "Reid: Is that official? Are we no longer a doctor and patient?",
        "Noah: That's official.",
        "Reid: Thank you. I've been looking forward to this day.",
        "Noah: So you don't have to face me and feel guilty?",
        "Reid: No, so I could finally tell you how many times I wished I'd been the blind one during this whole ordeal with you.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Reid: That way, I wouldn't have to watch you treat Luke like dirt.",
        "Noah: You don't know anything about Luke and me.",
        "Reid: It doesn't matter that he blamed himself for what happened. It doesn't matter that he bent over backwards trying to make it up to you. You still found ways to hurt him, to make him feel guilty and responsible. And in the end, you left him anyway.",
        "Noah: And when I came back, you made sure it was too late. I mean, actually telling us to stay apart during my treatments? I should have known something was up with you then.",
        "Reid: You can't pin that on me. I was trying to help you.",
        "Noah: Don't you mean yourself?",
        "Reid: You have yourself to blame. You acted like a spoiled brat every time the guy tried to do something to help the one he loved.",
        "Noah: Are we done?",
        "Reid: Yeah. Thanks to me, you can now see the door. Use it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Is there a problem between Noah and Reid? I mean, I would think after the successful surgery that Noah would be singing his praises.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm sure Noah would be if it hadn't been for --",
        "Bob: If what?",
        "Luke: Uh, nothing. It's just that Noah's been buzzing around 24/7 since he got his sight back, and he has so much work he has to make up for his film school, and I just -- I don't think he'd be able to make it on such short notice.",
        "Bob: That's too bad, 'cause he is living proof of Dr. Oliver's surgical skill.",
        "Luke: Well, you and I were there, and we can convince this Ms. Cross about that.",
        "Bob: Right. Uh, but, uh -- still, try to get a hold of Noah, will you? I, uh -- I think it would mean a lot.",
        "Luke: Yeah. We'll, uh -- I'll do my best to find him and run this by him.",
        "Bob: I appreciate that. See you at the Lakeview in, uh, just about an hour.",
        "Luke: Mm-hmm. Well, here goes nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Do you know who I might talk to about getting my old job back?",
        "Barista: You'll have to fill out an application.",
        "Noah: But I already worked here. All you have to do is -- I'm sorry. Um, it's been kind of a rough morning. I will take one of those applications, if you don't mind.",
        "Barista: You want some, uh, decaf with that?",
        "Noah: [Chuckles] Yeah, thanks. That'd be great.",
        "Luke: How's it going?",
        "Noah: It's fine. Thanks. Excuse me. I've got to fill out this application.",
        "Luke: Why don't you just talk to Frank?",
        "Noah: Long story.",
        "Luke: So, how'd your checkup go? Did it go well?",
        "Noah: Well, I've still got my sight, so I guess pretty well. I'm sorry. I've just been snapping at the wrong people today.",
        "Luke: Well, who are you mad at?",
        "Noah: What do you want, Luke?",
        "Luke: A favor. But I don't think you're going to want to do it. Bob Hughes is meeting with this corporation that's thinking about buying the hospital. He'd really like it if you would come and talk about your surgery.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Why wouldn't I want to do that?",
        "Luke: Reid is going to be there.",
        "Noah: I'm busy.",
        "Luke: Noah, come on.",
        "Noah: I'm not interested. Is that a better answer for you?",
        "Luke: You're not interested in helping out Bob Hughes?",
        "Noah: Not if it makes Reid look good. No, find somebody else.",
        "Luke: Well, there is nobody else, Noah. There's nobody like you. A few weeks ago, you couldn't even see, and now you can. And like it or not, that's because of Reid. All you have to do is go there, say that, and I -- I think it would really mean a lot to Bob.",
        "Noah: It would mean a lot to you, too.",
        "Luke: Seeing how my foundation's money is backing the new wing, yeah, I'd say it means a lot to me. Other than that, don't read into it.",
        "Noah: I am not making any assumptions here, Luke. I know what he did, and I'll be damned if I'm going to go out of my way to puff up Reid Oliver's ego.",
        "Luke: This is not about Reid Oliver!",
        "Noah: The whole time he was dangling medical cures in front of me, he was falling for you, trying to seduce you. And that's what this is about.",
        "Luke: Noah, he was single, and this is the part that you always seem to forget. By the time he made his first move on me, I was single, too. You know, what is wrong with you? You get your sight back, but you lose your memory?",
        "Noah: Some things I'd rather forget.",
        "Luke: Well, do you remember why I blackmailed Reid Oliver into coming here? Convinced him to do your surgery?",
        "Noah: I wanted to see.",
        "Luke: You didn't want to live your life as a blind person. And now, because of Reid, you don't have to.",
        "Noah: So tell them that, Luke. Tell Bob and whoever else is at that meeting. You tell them, because I can't.",
        "Luke: This is really funny. After everything that you've been through, I would think you, more than anyone else, would know the difference between \"Can't\" and \"Won't.\" Honey, that fish stinks!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Hey, sorry. I got held up. Did I miss the whole dog-and-pony show with the investor?",
        "Bob: No. Uh, Ms. Cross is not due for a few minutes yet.",
        "Reid: Why am I here early?",
        "Bob: I, uh -- I wanted to go over your presentation.",
        "Reid: Do you -- do you have a script or talking points, perhaps cue cards?",
        "Bob: No, I think you can do it without prompts.",
        "Reid: You're actually going to instruct me?",
        "Bob: Yes. I want you to smile, shake her hand, tell her you're thrilled to meet her, and keep your mouth shut.",
        "Reid: This is my project. Shouldn't I be able to tell her how I came up with the concept?",
        "Bob: Why don't you let others say how amazing you are? It sounds more sincere coming from other people.",
        "Reid: Oh, yeah? Like who?",
        "Bob: Hmm. Ms. Cross?",
        "Mona: Oh. Please call me Mona.",
        "Bob: Um, well, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Bob Hughes, and this is Reid Oliver.",
        "Mona: Hi.",
        "Reid: I am thrilled to meet you.",
        "Bob: Ah, good. Well, let's sit down.",
        "Mona: Oh, yes.",
        "Bob: Uh, Dr. Oliver, uh, came to us from Dallas. We snagged him about -- well, it was last fall.",
        "Reid: I wouldn't say \"Snagged\" so much as \"Lured and trapped,\" but that's neither here nor there.",
        "Bob: Luke. Uh, Luke Snyder, Mona Cross.",
        "Mona: It's a pleasure to meet you, Luke.",
        "Bob: Luke was a major donor to the new wing, which uh, Dr. Oliver will be supervising.",
        "Mona: Very generous.",
        "Luke: Well, the work is what's important. We're just glad to be in a position to help.",
        "Mona: Why did you choose to build the wing at Memorial? Couldn't you serve more patients at a larger, more metropolitan hospital?",
        "Luke: Well, other hospitals aren't run by someone I respect as much as Dr. Hughes and staffed with some of the best doctors in the country. Dr. Oliver.",
        "Reid: Yes, Memorial is the -- the little hospital that could.",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver came to us from a large hospital in Dallas, so he's had to make some adjustments. May I offer you a drink?",
        "Reid: That's a great idea. A drink. Let's get that waiter over here. Let me tell you something, Mona. I mean, when I first moved to this town, it was like taking a thousand steps backwards.",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver has had a lot of success here at Memorial. There was a client of his who was told by numerous specialists that he wouldn't be able to see ever again, and now he has his eyesight back thanks to Dr. Oliver.",
        "Mona: I've heard about that case. I would love to meet with that patient if I could. I find it helps to talk to --",
        "Reid: The little people? Yeah. That's not what I meant to say.",
        "Bob: Uh, were you able to reach Noah?",
        "Mona: That's the young man?",
        "Luke: Uh, yes, yes -- but unfortunately, he couldn't be here today.",
        "Noah: Changed my plans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Sorry. I didn't mean to lose it.",
        "Alison: It's okay.",
        "Meg: You know what it's like.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Meg: Well, you've done things in your past that you're ashamed of, and you worked hard to get better, and you have. That's what I'm trying to do.",
        "Alison: And -- and you will be, Meg. It just -- it takes time.",
        "Meg: Especially when you have someone who hates you like Emily hates me.",
        "Alison: She doesn't hate you.",
        "Meg: She doesn't want me to get well. She's trying to get rid of me. I didn't steal the methadone, Alison.",
        "Alison: Okay, okay. Why don't we get you back --?",
        "Meg: Look, why would I do something like that?! I'm doing great. I'm at home. I'm -- I'm spending time with my little girl. Emily is accusing me of this, and I -- I can lose everything.",
        "Alison: And maybe it'll all work out.",
        "Meg: [Scoffs] Alison, they found methadone in my system.",
        "Alison: Maybe it was an accident. You're taking several different medications. Maybe you got confused and you picked up the methadone by mistake.",
        "Meg: I didn't steal it, okay?!",
        "Barbara: Still defending yourself, huh? What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I'm helping my patient.",
        "Meg: Uh, it's okay. I -- I was upset, and Alison was being nice to me.",
        "Barbara: No, it looks like Alison was the one who was upsetting you. Defending your sister, perhaps? Did she set you up for this?",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: Did she send you over here to harass Meg, to accuse her of doing something she didn't do?",
        "Alison: No. She was upset, and I was trying to calm her down.",
        "Barbara: By accusing her of medicating herself with a dangerous drug, perhaps.",
        "Alison: I didn't accuse her. Meg, I honestly don't know what happened. I just want you to feel better.",
        "Barbara: She will, as long as we keep your sister away from her.",
        "Alison: Emily isn't a threat to Meg.",
        "Barbara: Isn't she? She's trying to have Meg recommitted. She stole a drug and somehow slipped it into something that Meg ate or drank.",
        "Alison: That's not true.",
        "Barbara: Everyone knows that it is, including Paul.",
        "Alison: I -- I know you're going through a lot, and I'm sorry, but there is no way that my sister would try to hurt you like this. Feel better, Meg.",
        "Barbara: I don't want you to worry about anything, all right? We're going to get to the bottom of this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I thought you'd be packing by now.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, two things stopped me.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You love me and you love me.",
        "Emily: Okay, three.",
        "Paul: Really? What were the first two?",
        "Emily: I couldn't stand the thought of leaving Eliza.",
        "Paul: What's the other one?",
        "Emily: I really couldn't stand the thought of moving back in with my mother.",
        "Paul: Come here. That thumping under there -- that's where you live. [Sighs] If you ever did leave me, it would require major surgery to get you out of there.",
        "Emily: [Sighs] God, did you really think I would risk our marriage -- that I would jeopardize my chance to help you raise your daughter by drugging your ex-wife?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Paul!",
        "Paul: Come on. This is us. This is you and me. This is obsessed and -- and more obsessed. I kidnapped Eliza, and then -- you know, for good measure, I kidnapped Eliza.",
        "Emily: You were desperate.",
        "Paul: And you kidnapped Dusty. You chained him up in a shack. You shot me. You married some guy that was like half your age.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, okay, I've had my moments, too. I get it.",
        "Paul: You know, if you compare everything that you've done to drugging Meg, it doesn't seem so extreme anymore.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. Why -- why would I do that? I'd be risking everything. And for what?",
        "Paul: For custody. Make sure we have custody of Eliza.",
        "Emily: We have custody.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and it was almost a done deal, except then you left her alone in a car.",
        "Emily: How many times are you going to make me have to apologize for this?",
        "Paul: Like a million. You're going to have to apologize a million times. A judge could declare you unfit. We could lose custody of Eliza to Meg, and you would do anything to stop that, wouldn't you?",
        "Emily: I didn't do this!",
        "Paul: And I know how you are with Meg. I asked you to give her some space. I asked you to be nice to her. You know, just give her a break. And all you did was insult her and pick at her.",
        "Emily: Okay, fine, fine, fine. I did all of those things. I'm guilty. I did not drug her!",
        "Paul: Having a baby is the number-one priority with you.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? Now you're patronizing me.",
        "Paul: You want me to yell at you, be all angry? What?",
        "Emily: No, no, no. I want you to believe me.",
        "Paul: And I want you to remember who it is that you're married to. 'Cause I know you. I know how passionate you are. I know how out there you can get.",
        "Emily: If you can't believe me, what does that say about our marriage?",
        "Paul: That I know you. I know you.",
        "Emily: I swear -- I swear on my life, I didn't do this. I swear on our marriage, on everything. I didn't do this. But obviously somebody is trying to make it look like I did.",
        "Paul: Really? Who would do something like that? Come on.",
        "Emily: Isn't it obvious? Your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I have stood up for you, I have defended you, and yet you look at me like you don't trust me.",
        "Meg: [Scoffs] Should I?",
        "Barbara: Yes. I am your ally. I have convinced Paul that you're innocent and that Emily isn't.",
        "Meg: Are you sure he's convinced?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I am.",
        "Meg: So, where is he? He's not here. He believes her, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: He will be here very soon -- as soon as he realizes how guilty that Emily looks.",
        "Meg: \"Looks\"?",
        "Barbara: Is. Any sane person knows that you wouldn't drug yourself when you're trying to show the world that you're fit to be a parent.",
        "Meg: I don't know why you're helping me or why you're even interested in what's happening to me.",
        "Barbara: Because you're the mother of my beautiful granddaughter.",
        "Meg: And you love Eliza very much.",
        "Barbara: Yes, I do.",
        "Meg: But you never liked me. So what has changed?",
        "Barbara: Well, if you want the truth, you're the lesser of two evils.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] You're trying to get rid of Emily?",
        "Barbara: You have a problem with that?",
        "Meg: If she's the one that drugged me, I want her punished.",
        "Barbara: And she will be. Now let's get to bed. Paul will be here soon.",
        "Meg: Are you sure?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I am sure.",
        "Meg: So, how exactly did Emily get on your bad side? Because I don't want to make the same mistake.",
        "Barbara: She just tries to run Paul's life and tries to run me out of it, and she thinks she has that right simply because she married him.",
        "Meg: But you gave birth to him.",
        "Barbara: Exactly. I'm Paul's mother, and you're Eliza's, and we're on the same team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't know. You really think that my mother is behind all of this?",
        "Emily: It had to be Barbara.",
        "Paul: I don't know. She wasn't in the hospital the day the methadone got stolen.",
        "Emily: Okay, just because no one saw her doesn't mean she wasn't there.",
        "Paul: It's just so convoluted, you know? I mean, my mother drugs Meg and then blames you for drugging Meg and then comes to Meg's defense? She doesn't -- she doesn't even like Meg.",
        "Emily: Okay, in a horse race between your former and current wives, your mother would pick your ex by like six lengths.",
        "Paul: Why? Why would she have it out for you?",
        "Emily: Because I have you. And anyone who has you is a threat. This is not news to you. You know this.",
        "Paul: That doesn't make any sense to me.",
        "Emily: She's moved into our home, Paul. She's jealous of every minute I spend with Eliza and you.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: And now she's pointing the finger at me, making you doubt me.",
        "Paul: She moved into our home because she was having problems with Henry.",
        "Emily: Exactly. Lost her boy toy. Wants her son back.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but you're the one who has me.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, Paul. Your mother has put a wedge between the two of us the size of Florida, and that is --",
        "Paul: You did that. You did that.",
        "Emily: Excuse me? I did that? What did I do? I didn't do anything! I did not drug Meg. But you -- you don't believe me.",
        "Paul: No, not at all. I guess really the only way for you to get out of this is just to admit it.",

        "Mona: So, did you enjoy working with Dr. Oliver?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Mona: And why is that?",
        "Noah: There was something I wanted, something I thought was more important than everything else.",
        "Mona: Being able to see?",
        "Noah: Yeah. And Reid could give that back to me. Or he could take it away. I just didn't like being so out of control.",
        "Bob: But Reid gave you what you wanted.",
        "Noah: He gave me my eyes. With Reid Oliver at Memorial, I'm sure the hospital will have no problems attracting other talented surgeons. I'm not sure that any of them will be able to match his success rate or his reputation.",
        "Mona: Well, it's been a pleasure and a privilege meeting you, Mr. Mayer. Thank you so much for coming. Oh!",
        "Bob: You all right?",
        "Reid: I'm used to it. Getting hit is just part of being me.",
        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Reid: You know, I'm -- I'm fine. You guys are both scaring the pants off of our potential investor.",
        "Mona: This is astonishing.",
        "Bob: I'm sorry about this.",
        "Mona: Mr. Mayer seemed like such a nice young man.",
        "Bob: Yes, he is. There seemed to be a lot of, uh, suppressed emotions going on. Why don't we have a drink?",
        "Mona: Oh, sure.",
        "Reid: Was this planned?",
        "Luke: You're going to have to ask Noah. I would wait a couple days, or a couple weeks. Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Reid: I don't know. It might be broken. I'm not sure.",
        "Luke: Well, let me drive you to the hospital.",
        "Reid: You go after Noah. I'm fine. I'll walk.",
        "Luke: I already checked. He's long gone.",

        "Paul: Maybe, yeah. No, it's a good question. I'd do anything for you.",
        "Emily: Then believe me. Can you do that for me?",
        "Alison: Emily, what's going on?",
        "Emily: Ali, Ali, this is not a good time.",
        "Alison: I was just with Meg, and Barbara showed up.",
        "Paul: Meg? What were you doing with Meg?",
        "Alison: I'm a nurse, Paul. She's a patient. And what's up with your mother making these crazy accusations against Emily?",
        "Emily: What did Barbara say?",
        "Alison: She said that you drugged Meg, and that's why methadone was in her tox screen.",
        "Emily: I told you. I told you she was out to get me.",
        "Alison: Well, you would never do anything like that.",
        "Emily: Tell that to my husband.",
        "Alison: You believe this?",
        "Paul: I'm going out.",
        "Emily: What?! Now? Why?",
        "Paul: Because I need to think. I don't --",
        "Emily: Hey, you know what? While you're out thinking, why don't you think about this -- your mother has tried to pry us apart from day one. That used to fuse us together. Please, just don't let her rip us apart.",
        "Paul: I -- I don't know what to believe.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Barbara's poisoning Paul against me. I'm going to lose him. I can feel it.",
        "Alison: You're not going to lose him.",
        "Emily: How do you know that? He just walked out on me. He won't even give me the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Alison: You can't give up, okay? Promise me you won't.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, what am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?",
        "Alison: Let's stop her.",
        "Emily: How, Ali?",
        "Alison: You're the editor of \"First Edition.\" What -- what would you do if you were investigating this story?",
        "Emily: I'd start at the beginning.",
        "Alison: Okay. So, the day that the methadone was stolen, both you and Meg were at the hospital.",
        "Emily: Yes, yes. And I was -- I was with her for each and every one of her crazy moods, her moments.",
        "Alison: You think she's faking?",
        "Emily: No. I mean, there was methadone in her system. The test proved it. But wait a minute. Hold on, hold on. Do they -- do they order those tests automatically? I mean, is it part of a routine screen?",
        "Alison: No, no, no. I mean, a test like that has to be specifically ordered.",
        "Emily: Well, then, that's it. Ali, that's it. We find out who ordered the tox screen, and that's who's behind all of this.",
        "Alison: Okay. All right. I'll -- I'll go check it out.",
        "Emily: Okay, wait a minute. Oh, you're the best. Thank you. All right, go.",
        "Alison: Okay.",

        "Luke: Is it broken?",
        "Reid: No. Think I still have a future as a male model.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Luke: You know, I have never seen a look of shock on your face until today.",
        "Reid: Oh, man, Noah has some right hook.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, he also knows how to use a gun, so consider yourself lucky.",
        "Reid: Oh, fantastic. I just happened to fall for a guy whose ex can pulverize me.",
        "Luke: Well, what can I say? I like them tough.",
        "Reid: You're pretty tough yourself. You kidnapped me, threatened me. What are you going to do with me now?",
        "Luke: I thought you said you didn't want to have anything to do with me.",
        "Reid: When you said that you and Noah were through --",
        "Noah: We are. Look, Reid, what do you want me to say?",
        "Reid: That that's true. Hey, Bob. How did things go with Mona?",
        "Bob: Luke, I -- I'd like a word with Dr. Oliver alone, please.",
        "Luke: Yes. Of course. I have stuff I have to do anyway.",
        "Reid: What do you need?",
        "Bob: To be wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What are you doing, Mother?",
        "Barbara: I was looking after Meg. She's sedated now.",
        "Paul: Well, then, she doesn't need looking after, does she? And that's not what I'm asking.",
        "Barbara: I see. So, Emily defended herself when she did that by accusing me, right?",
        "Paul: Well, given all the other rotten things you've done in the name of protecting me --",
        "Barbara: I had nothing to do with this, and I think you should look at your mother's example and protect your child.",
        "Paul: Eliza's fine.",
        "Barbara: Eliza is being taken care of by a woman who's trying to drive that baby's mother insane and has not shown a shred of remorse for it.",
        "Paul: Emily didn't do this.",
        "Barbara: And you're certain of this because she claimed she was innocent?",
        "Paul: Emily wouldn't lie to me, not about this.",
        "Barbara: Uh-huh. Did she cry while she was proclaiming her innocence? Did she swear on everything she holds dear? Yeah, thought so. And you bought it. You're more naive than you look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, everything's going to be all right, Eliza. Everything's going to be all right. Your daddy's going to realize how wrong he is. I'm always going to be here for you. You hear me? Nothing's going to come between us -- nothing. Not even your yucky grandmother. I prom -- I promise.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Emily: Ali, what'd you find out?",
        "Alison: Your hunch was right about the tox screen.",
        "Emily: Barbara's behind it?",
        "Alison: Absolutely.",
        "Emily: I knew it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You knew that I was arranging this meeting, and you knew it was important to the future of this hospital.",
        "Reid: Your point?",
        "Bob: My point is why didn't you tell me that you were having a personal relationship with Luke Snyder outside this hospital?",
        "Reid: I wouldn't call it that.",
        "Bob: Well, it certainly was a problem for Noah. And when I walked in here --",
        "Reid: Yeah, I didn't know Noah was going to be there at the meeting. I didn't know Luke was going to be there either, for that matter.",
        "Bob: It's inappropriate.",
        "Reid: Why?",
        "Bob: You have to ask?",
        "Reid: Luke isn't my patient. And unless he suddenly incurs a brain injury, he's not going to be. Noah terminated my services this morning, so I don't really see what the problem is.",
        "Bob: You really don't see that this situation could have grave consequences?",
        "Reid: Because Noah Mayer clocked me back at the Lakeview? How is that my fault?",
        "Bob: Because he clocked you in front of a potential buyer for this hospital. Ms. Cross represents a company that could pour millions of dollars into this hospital and save jobs and save God knows how many lives.",
        "Reid: And -- and somehow that's all in jeopardy because I'm interested in Luke Snyder?",
        "Bob: Well, if she puts two and two together and realizes that the main backer of the new wing and its supervisor are having a personal relationship, the whole thing could self-destruct.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: How dare you try and turn my husband against me.",
        "Barbara: I don't think I just tried. I do believe I succeeded.",
        "Emily: When he finds out that you're the one who's behind this whole thing, not only is he going to kick you out of my house, you will be lucky if he ever speaks to you again.",
        "Barbara: You're really trying to pin this on me.",
        "Emily: And if I have anything to say about it, you will never see your granddaughter again.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, we're all very fortunate that your tenancy in my son's life is about to come to an end.",
        "Emily: Because of your lies? I don't think so, Lady.",
        "Barbara: Why would Paul believe that I drugged Meg?",
        "Emily: For the same reason you ordered her tox screen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Stop, stop. I'm not -- I'm not crazy. I'm not.",
        "Paul: Meg, Meg, Meg, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's all right, it's all right.",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: It's just a dream.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Paul: You're all right. Tell me what's going on. What was that about?",
        "Meg: [Sighs] Emily -- she was trying to hurt me.",
        "Paul: Well, you're all right now, and I'm right here. Right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Wait. That's -- that's my heinous sin -- nepotism? This coming from you? Your grandson nearly married a staff nurse until the wedding tanked in a -- in infidelity and gunfire. Your son works at the hospital. Your mother volunteers here, and I bet she gets pretty prime parking spaces, too.",
        "Bob: None of my family is as involved in the new wing as you and Luke are.",
        "Reid: I bet you wouldn't be half so put off if this didn't involve two gay men.",
        "Bob: This has absolutely nothing to do with your sexual orientation.",
        "Reid: If you say so.",
        "Bob: It's a matter of ethics, pure and simple. If you are having a relationship or intend to have a relationship with a major donor to this hospital, it is unethical.",
        "Reid: Says you. Why don't we play it this way, Bob? You stay out of my personal life. I'll get involved with whoever the hell I want to. And if somebody at Invicta Corporation doesn't like it, tough.",
        "Bob: That's an interesting suggestion. Let me tell you how I think it's going to play out. The new wing will move forward under your leadership, or you will have a relationship with Luke Snyder. You can't have both. Choose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah, wait.",
        "Noah: What do you want?",
        "Luke: What happened back there?",
        "Noah: Did you miss the punch?! 'Cause I can go back and hit him again!",
        "Luke: No, what I'm missing is the reason. You say that you want nothing to do with me, and then you punch Reid? Why?",
        "Noah: I wanted to.",
        "Luke: All right. Well, let's get something straight. You ended this. That means you don't have the right to, uh -- to clock in or to punch in with your opinions on somebody else who's interested in me.",
        "Noah: Fine.",
        "Luke: No, but I -- I do have to ask you this. You're doing that. Does that mean that you care enough to react?",
        "Noah: That wasn't me caring. That was me being fed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Yes, I ordered the tox screen. It wasn't exactly a secret.",
        "Emily: Really? Because I didn't know. Paul didn't know.",
        "Barbara: So tell him.",
        "Emily: Why did you do it?",
        "Barbara: Because I had a hunch that you were behind Meg's condition, and I needed proof.",
        "Emily: Really? So you just jumped to the conclusion that I'm drugging Meg?",
        "Barbara: Something is making her behave irrationally, yes.",
        "Emily: I'm not going to let you set me up for this to take the fall.",
        "Barbara: You know what? It's such a shame that my son is so blinded by your skills in the bedroom, because I'll tell you something. The truth is --",
        "Emily: No, the truth is you are a twisted woman.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me?",
        "Emily: Whatever you had going with Henry failed, so you went back to your failsafe, your son.",
        "Barbara: What are you insinuating?",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not insinuating anything. I'm saying it straight out. You want to get close to your son. That's why you want me out of this house.",
        "Barbara: That is a ridiculous accusation.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, so you can cozy up next to him and enact this sick mother/son dynamic you do. But here's the truth. Your son loves me, and in his heart, he believes that I'm innocent.",
        "Barbara: Really? Then why is he at Meg's bedside right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Its okay, it's okay. You're safe.",
        "Meg: It was just so scary. [Sighs]",

        "Meg: No, no, no, no. Don't leave me. Uh, I'm just glad you're here.",
        "Paul: Can I get you something else? You want some water? Cup of tea?",
        "Meg: No, thank you.",
        "Paul: Meg, both of those times that you had those little breakdowns, did Emily give you tea just before?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Both times. [Scoffs] Why would she do that to me? Why?",
        "Paul: I'll take care of you.",
