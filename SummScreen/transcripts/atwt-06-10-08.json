        "Brad: Janet.",
        "Janet: Good morning, Bradley. Hey, I'm sorry I zonked out in the middle the game last night. But thanks for letting me sleep on the couch. That was really cool of you.",
        "Brad: Sure. I just -- I just -- I just figured, you -- you know --",
        "Janet: What, that I would leave and not say thank you, and not fix you and the kid a decent breakfast? No way.",
        "Brad: I think Katie has an apron or a robe you could wear.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's okay. I hope you don't mind, I just grabbed this out of the laundry basket. It's no big deal. Sit down. You ready for breakfast?",
        "Brad: No, I've got to get to work.",
        "Janet: No, you cannot get to work, not yet. Not on an empty stomach. You haven't had a taste of my sticky buns yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you think you can take some medicine? Bring down your fever.",
        "J.J.: My throat hurts.",
        "Carly: Parker!",
        "Parker: Sorry. I couldn't find them.",
        "Carly: They were in the medicine cabinet, right? Parker, where did you find this bottle? Where?",
        "Parker: They were shoved in a drawer. In the table next to J.J.'s bed.",
        "Carly: You please go upstairs and keep Sage occupied.",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Carly: She has a play date at Morgans' at 10:00. Would you walk her over, please?",
        "Parker: Mom?",
        "Carly: It's all right. It'll be all right. All right, Kiddo. Come on. Let's get you to the car, all right?",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Jack: Yeah. Snyder.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, J.J.'s sick.",
        "Jack: Oh, Man, Carly. I -- listen, I can't stay with him today. I'm working on this case, it's about the blow.",
        "Carly: I'm taking him to the emergency room.",
        "Jack: Okay, okay. I'll meet you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Did you honestly think that Holden and I would thank you for this?",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Honey, what would you have had me do? Abandon your kid in his moment of need?",
        "Lily: Don't play that with me. You could have picked up the phone and called me.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you and Holden have more than enough problems of your own that your children are well aware of.",
        "Lily: Where is Luke now?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, please don't. Don't -- please. Let them be alone. Give them some time. Noah needs Luke right now, and Luke, he wants to be there for Noah, all right? You understand? You got it? Or do I need to explain that?",
        "Lily: Here's Holden.",
        "Holden: What's going on? What happened to Luke?",
        "Lily: Tell him.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, well, it's a long story.",
        "Holden: Yeah? Well, shorten it.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, Luke has been in New York with Noah in the middle of an international incident.",
        "Lily: Which could have gotten him killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, what do you want first? Food or sleep?",
        "Noah: You don't have to stay.",
        "Luke: I'll make you some eggs.",
        "Noah: Eggs. My dad dies, he fixes me eggs. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: That's okay. Uh, I don't -- I don't know how to help you.",
        "Noah: Ameera's the one who needs help, not me. I shouldn't have left. I should have stayed in New York.",
        "Luke: There was nothing that you could have done for her there.",
        "Noah: Luke, I promised to help her. Instead I get on a private jet with you and your grandmother, I leave her in some jail.",
        "Luke: Not for long. My grandma has a lot of connections. She'll get Ameera the best lawyers.",
        "Noah: What if she gets sent back to Iraq?",
        "Luke: She won't.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm glad you're so sure. Just go home, Luke.",

        "Janet: Come on.",
        "Brad: No, I don't have time to eat anything. I got to find these notes. I'm working. Get out of here.",
        "Janet: Brad, just at least try one.",
        "Brad: All right. I'll eat on the way.",
        "Janet: Come on, they're fresh out of the oven. Oh.",
        "Brad: Mmm.",
        "Liberty: Dad, I found these! I found them in the bathroom.",
        "Brad: Oh, thank you! Thank you. Okay, bye. Have a great day.",
        "Both: Bye!",
        "Liberty: Wow, you really moved in, didn't you, Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How long has he been sick?",
        "Doctor: Well, I'm guessing several weeks. Strep is usually very painful. Were there no symptoms?",
        "Carly: None that I knew about. He's probably been taking these.",
        "Doctor: How many? How often?",
        "Carly: I'm not sure. But he would have followed the instructions on the bottle. I guess we should make sure.",
        "Doctor: Oh, we'll do that. We'll be bring down an x-ray to check his lungs and heart --",
        "Carly: His heart?",
        "Doctor: It's just a precaution. I'm going to have to ask you to wait out here for a little bit.",
        "Carly: No, no, I would prefer to stay with him.",
        "Doctor: Just let us get this done, and then you can come in and see him.",
        "Carly: Say it. I should have known. I should have seen it.",
        "Jack: Hey, what about me? He was complaining about a sore throat, I didn't even question it. That just -- what the hell what was I thinking? How's J.J.?",
        "Doctor: Well, we have confirmed the strep, and for now, that's all we need to deal with.",
        "Jack: For now?",
        "Doctor: Certain complications can develop with strep. Rheumatic fever, cardiac complications.",
        "Carly: How could it affect his heart?",
        "Doctor: Has anyone in your family had rheumatic fever?",
        "Jack: Uh, J.J.'s adopted. We're not sure of his genetic history.",
        "Doctor: Well, at this point, his x-rays are clear and there's no sign of anything more complicated than the strep. I'll send you home with a list of symptoms to look out for, just in case. And he's gonna need complete bed rest for the next 24 to 48 hours.",
        "Carly: Any medicine?",
        "Doctor: Antibiotics and an anti-inflammatory. I'll write those up for you, and get his discharge papers going, then you can take him home.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, listen, you know what? I can take a personal day and hang out with J.J. if you got to get back to Metro.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no, there's no way I'd leave him now.",
        "Jack: Let's go see him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm late. But I got this interview so covered. Okay, I read all the research on this golf guy. I practiced some of the stuff in his book. And I am all set for him to doctor my swing.",
        "Kim: Uh, the golf guy just canceled.",
        "Brad: Oh. Well, who did we get instead?",
        "Kim: Uh, Brad, I don't want you to be overwhelmed by this because you're gonna do just fine. You'll be just fine.",
        "Brad: Don't tell me that I'm not doing some chick topic.",
        "Kim: Actually, you're going to be interviewing a lovely woman who just wrote a book on being a single mother.",
        "Brad: Kim, have a heart. I mean, how am I going to interview somebody like that without Katie there to pick up the slack?",
        "Kim: Actually, I asked one of the interns to write some questions for you, so relax. You can do it.",
        "Brad: \"Is it true the nail salon is the best place for mother/daughter bonding?\"",
        "Kim: See? I told you, you could do it.",
        "Brad: Oh, I'm gonna look like a jerk, Kim! Come on! I can't talk about making cookies. And how to talk to your daughter about sex. Don't do this to me!",
        "Kim: It's been done, my friend. You're on camera in an hour.",
        "Brad: Is there any other way?",
        "Kim: Well, yes, there is.",
        "Brad: I'll do it. Whatever it is.",
        "Kim: Well, fine. All you have to do is find an expert on the same subject who'll come and do the interview with you. That's it.",
        "Brad: Like who?",
        "Kim: Well, I have no idea. But if you can't think of anybody, you'd better start bonding with those questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I did not move in. I simply fell asleep on the couch.",
        "Liberty: And mysteriously woke up wearing Dad's t-shirt?",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. I always fix breakfast in t-shirts. Right, sometimes I do. Stop it. Just drink your juice. Its fresh squeezed.",
        "Liberty: Okay. It's just, you're kind of laying it on, Mom.",
        "Janet: Libby, you have a very devious mind. All I wanted to do was fix a nice breakfast for you and Bradley.",
        "Liberty: He's married.",
        "Janet: I know that. And he and Katie make an adorable couple. And I would never do anything to come between them.",
        "Liberty: Uh-huh.",
        "Janet: What? You make it sound like I've got some big seduction thing going on here.",
        "Liberty: No, I've just seen you work your sticky buns before, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I can't deal with you right now, Luke.",
        "Luke: So you send me home? You dismiss me like I'm some sort of pet? You must have me confused with some other boyfriend, Noah.",
        "Noah: I'm kind of dealing with a lot right now.",
        "Luke: Look, I know. I was there. I got knocked out, thought you were dead --",
        "Noah: My father killed himself in front of me. You expect me to be -- just be over that? Just move past it?",
        "Luke: No, I expect you to treat me like somebody who cares what you're going through, who knows how hard this has hit you.",
        "Noah: My father drowned himself because he thought I betrayed him.",
        "Luke: No, he did it because he was afraid of the cops. He didn't want to go back to jail.",
        "Noah: And Ameera -- the person who lives here, who sleeps in this bed, is in jail right now because she's suspected of being a terrorist or something, and there's nothing I can do about it! I know it's a sham marriage, but she's still my wife, and you can't ask me not to feel this way.",
        "Luke: I'm not asking you to feel anything that you don't feel. I'm asking you to not forget who we are, Noah. I love you, and you love me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Mercifully, both boys emerged unscathed. Now, we should all be thankful for that.",
        "Holden: You should have told us what was going on. You shouldn't have kept us in the dark!",
        "Lily: That's exactly what I said.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my heavens, you finally agree on something. Why don't you hang on to that, because it'll be good for Luke to see it when he comes home again.",
        "Lily: Well, since he's sending all his messages through you, when will that be?",
        "Lucinda: Sooner or later. And don't be too hard on him, okay?",
        "Holden: I should go, too.",
        "Lily: Well, don't you want to be here when Luke comes home?",
        "Holden: We don't know when that will be.",
        "Lily: Well, God forbid you be alone with me any longer than necessary.",
        "Holden: Lily, I thought we said that we were gonna work things out.",
        "Lily: You know, what Noah's been through has been horrible, but I envy him. You know why? Because at least he knows he doesn't have to face it alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What are you thinking?",
        "Noah: I'm thinking that what you and I have is probably the best thing that's ever happened to me. And that I love you.",
        "Luke: I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Noah: And I'm sorry. Because with everything that's happened -- Luke, I think I need a break.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, that sounds good. You know, it's been a very, very stressful week. We can just get cleaned up, we can get some food. We can go out to the pond, and just --",
        "Noah: No. No, Luke, I need to take a break from us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Kim. Kim.",
        "Kim: Yeah?",
        "Brad: I know who can do the interview. All right, but it's gonna be tricky.",
        "Kim: Tricky?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Kim: How?",
        "Brad: Remember Janet?",
        "Kim: Janet, your ex?",
        "Brad: Well, she's not my ex, we do have a kid together. A kid that she raised alone.",
        "Kim: Oh. Well, I didn't think she was still around.",
        "Brad: She is.",
        "Kim: Oh, my gosh, she was terrific on the show, wasn't she?",
        "Brad: She was. She was. She definitely was.",
        "Kim: But I promised Katie there was no way in the world I had any intentions of bringing her back on the show again.",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah, right, Katie would hate it.",
        "Kim: Oh, boy, I'll say she would. But Janet is perfect, isn't she?",
        "Brad: Not if it would upset Katie.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but that never stopped you before.",
        "Brad: That's before we were married.",
        "Kim: But -- but if Katie understood that this was an emergency, maybe she wouldn't mind.",
        "Brad: You think?",
        "Kim: Well, I don't know, but try it. Call her, and, listen, call Janet first 'cause we got to get moving. And then call Katie, okay? Call, call, call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You can't be that annoyed that I'm here. You did a heck of a job on your breakfast.",
        "Liberty: I never said you couldn't really cook, Mom.",
        "Janet: You're lucky I love you. Otherwise, I'd eat you up!",
        "Liberty: Mom, no!",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Janet: Oh, wait, hold on. Ooh. Hi, Bradley. How's it hanging?",
        "Brad: Janet, hey. Look, I'm in a bind. Can you come down the studio right away?",
        "Janet: You couldn't get enough of my sticky buns, huh?",
        "Brad: No, no. My producer, Kim, she wants to see if you can fill in and do a guest interview thing.",
        "Janet: What? On camera? What kind of an interview?",
        "Brad: Well, I'll explain when you get down here. But you need to hurry. Get here as fast as you can. All right. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Yes? Oh, that was a terrific idea you had.",
        "Brad: Thanks. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite me in my sticky buns.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I'm going to do an interview with Bradley on \"Oakdale Now\"! Can you believe it?",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Does that mean you have to leave? Like exactly now?",
        "Janet: Yes! Yes!",
        "Liberty: Go! Go!",
        "Janet: Wait, wait! I need to find something to wear. What do I wear? I can't wear what I wore last night, and I don't have time to go back to the Lakeview. I don't know. I know! That blue sweater that you bought last week.",
        "Liberty: No! You are not wearing that, Mom!",
        "Janet: Didn't I teach you to share?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but you have a bigger share than I have. You stretch everything way out.",
        "Janet: Right, that's true. That's true. I can't be too sexy. I have to be -- I have to be soft and classy.",
        "Liberty: No, you are not going near Katie's closet.",
        "Janet: It's either hers or yours. You choose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Pain meds the doctor prescribed for him knocked him out. He's sleeping like a baby. Speaking of babies, check this out. Sage's baby monitor. When's the last time we used this? I set this up in his room, so if he needs anything, we'll hear him.",
        "Carly: He probably hasn't had a good night's sleep in weeks, Jack. He never let on.",
        "Jack: He didn't want us to know, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, when he wakes up, we're going to have a long talk with that boy.",
        "Jack: No, it's like he's afraid to make waves. It's like he wanted to be very, very careful so the rug didn't get pulled out from under him.",
        "Carly: I can relate.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen. Why don't you go grab a nap?",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: You couldn't have gotten much sleep last night.",
        "Carly: No, I'm too wound up to sleep.",
        "Jack: Okay, then go relax in the tub or something. Come on, I'll hear him, I promise.",
        "Carly: Jack, what if this turns into something terrible?",
        "Jack: It won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You don't want to be with me anymore?",
        "Noah: I need to think. You know, I can't do that with you here.",
        "Luke: You've never had that problem before.",
        "Noah: Well, I've never had this much going on before, Luke! It's not about you!",
        "Luke: Well, it kind of feels like it's about me since I'm the one being getting kicked out of your life!",
        "Noah: It's just for a little while. Okay, I'm trying to be honest.",
        "Luke: Honest, okay. Well, let me go full-on with this honesty thing, Noah. You blame me. Admit it.",
        "Noah: I don't want to fight with you about this.",
        "Luke: You blame me for Ameera being in custody, and, hell, maybe even blame me for what happened to your father because he jumped into the water right after I came up and called out to you.",
        "Noah: I know why you did what you did.",
        "Luke: Then why are you pushing me away?",
        "Noah: Because I wish you hadn't done it! Okay, I'll always wonder what would have happened if you hadn't come at that moment, if you hadn't said what you said, if my father hadn't heard you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Bradley! Hi! I'm here!",
        "Brad: Hey, aw, thank you so much for coming. I know its last minute.",
        "Janet: Oh, no problem. Look. I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Demille. I always wanted to say that!",
        "Brad: Okay, maybe you should calm down just a little bit.",
        "Janet: Oh, right. Right, I know. I'm working on it. I'm working on it.",
        "Brad: All right.",
        "Janet: I'm just really nervous. That's why I brought Libby here, so that I could look out into the audience and see a smiling face.",
        "Liberty: Okay, I will find some way to smile when the show starts, I promise. Oh, hey, how is my mom looking, huh?",
        "Brad: She's looking great. Katie has a dress just like that.",
        "Liberty: That is so funny that you said that --",
        "Janet: That's because we must have the same taste. What a co-inky-dinky.",
        "Kim: Janet, hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Kim: Good to see you again.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Kim: Welcome, welcome.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Well, Kim, you remember my daughter, Liberty.",
        "Kim: Sure.",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: Hi, Dear.",
        "Janet: Oh, you hanging out here now?",
        "Liberty: Sometimes.",
        "Kim: Okay, we have to get going, 'cause we're racing the clock here.",
        "Brad: Yes, yes, yes. You're going to sitting right here next to me, and our guest is going to be right there.",
        "Janet: Okay, what do I say? What do I do?",
        "Brad: Okay, well, we're talking about -- uh, single mothers.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, I know all about that.",
        "Brad: So you just have to be yourself.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You make it sound like there was a choice.",
        "Noah: I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to say these things now.",
        "Luke: I thought he was gonna kill you! I saw him reaching out to you. What did you expect me to do?",
        "Noah: I don't know! I don't have any answers, Luke. I just need a break from this.",
        "Luke: A break from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amy: Being a single mother, it's hard work. But it can also be empowering.",
        "Brad: Janet?",
        "Janet: Hmm?",
        "Brad: Well, as a real-life single mom, what do you think?",
        "Janet: Oh, oh. Yes, in my opinion, I think that Amy here is right on point. Being a single mother can be extremely rewarding, and my daughter and I share a very special bond.",
        "Brad: Right, but it is hard raising a kid on your own?",
        "Janet: No, not at all. Liberty's a really sweet girl. In fact, she's right here. Can we bring her on?",
        "Brad: Yeah, absolutely. Everybody, this is Janet's daughter. And mine, by the way. Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Janet: Sit down, Honey.",
        "Liberty: This is cool. Hey, your book sounds really cool.",
        "Amy: Oh, what a lovely girl.",

        "Liberty: Actually, Mom, I think you're kind of full of it.",
        "Brad: It's funny. She's a funny kid. She really is. She really didn't mean that.",
        "Liberty: Yes, I did. Okay, hi. Um, all of what my mom said since she got on here, it's like 99% of it is pure bull.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack? Is everything all right? Is J.J. okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah, he's sleeping. I just wanted to get the other thermometer.",
        "Carly: And you couldn't wait? You had to waltz in here while I'm naked?",
        "Jack: I didn't really think about it, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack, you can't do it anymore. Did you find the thermometer? Good. Get out.",
        "Jack: There's nothing in that tub I haven't seen before, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, that may be, but you're not seeing any of it today.",
        "Jack: I could wash your back.",
        "Carly: Get out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So you think your mom's been lying this whole time?",
        "Liberty: No, just more like pretending to be someone she's not.",
        "Brad: Why do you say that?",
        "Janet: Because she just likes being mean to her mom.",
        "Amy: Sometimes children raised in single-family households are resentful.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm not -- I don't resent my mom. But that is my point. I think most of the time, she kind of resents me.",
        "Janet: I do not!",
        "Liberty: Mom, all I'm saying is that you tell me how it's hard dealing with me on your own, and how sometimes, you know, you wish there was someone there to share the burden. Okay, hi, again. Um, don't get me wrong here, raising me is not a walk in the park, and she is a terrific mom. All I'm saying is, I think some of the time she's more exhausted than empowered.",
        "Brad: Sweetheart, I know it might seem that way sometimes, but I'm sure your mother loved having all that alone time with you.",
        "Janet: No, no. Liberty's absolutely right. The last thing I ever wanted was to be a single mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: That was good before. You made me laugh.",
        "Jack: And for my next trick, I'm gonna make you fall asleep. Come on, lie down.",
        "Carly: You know, we don't both need to be here. You can go back to work. I can handle this.",
        "Jack: Carly, I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving any more than you would. Don't fight me on this. Lie down, please.",
        "Carly: Fine. But I'm not gonna sleep. I'm too worried.",
        "Jack: Come on, he's a tough kid.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh, too tough. Did you hear something?",
        "Jack: No, he's fine.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: Please close your eyes. Thank you. Now, think of the late summer. August. J.J.'s completely fine. He's playing baseball, building a fort with sage.",
        "Carly: Fighting with Parker. The two of them screaming at the top of their lungs.",
        "Jack: Oh, that sounds nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Your grandmother just left. I can't believe what you've been through.",
        "Holden: I wish you had told us what you were doing.",
        "Luke: So do I. Then maybe it wouldn't have been such a disaster. But Noah didn't want me to say anything. So --",
        "Lily: How is Noah?",
        "Luke: Uh, he's making some changes. Like getting rid of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, don't get me wrong. Having Liberty was the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "Brad: Even when you told her that she was a burden?",
        "Janet: What I used to say was, I wanted somebody to share the burden and share the joy. The joy of your first step, her first word. I wanted somebody to be next to me, saying, \"Hey, Honey, Honey, did you see what she did? Look, she just took her first step! Isn't that cute?! Get the camera!\"",
        "Brad: What was the best day?",
        "Janet: When she discovered she loved shopping. I was so proud.",
        "Brad: What was worst day?",
        "Janet: The worst day? Oh, that look. Go ahead, Honey. Show them the look. The look you give, the eyes, the thing. See.",
        "Brad: It's worse than that. I know that look. Oh, I wish I could have been there.",
        "Janet: The biggest mistake I ever made was being so stubborn, thinking I could do it all by myself. I could've tried to find you, Bradley, but I didn't. And you missed out on all those moments because of me.",
        "Liberty: Don't do the ugly cry, Mom.",
        "Janet: No, no, Baby. It's -- no, no. This is -- these are misty tears of happiness, happiness because you found your dad now. And from now on, there are two people in your life to share the good times, the bad times, and who will love you no matter what. Together.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mom, he blames me for what happened.",
        "Lily: Why? His dad was the one that caused all of this.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Noah's still holding on to this fantasy that he could finally get through to his dad. He thinks that the Colonel was just gonna, I don't know, just turn over a new leaf, let Ameera free, turn himself in, and finally be what he never was -- a good, honest decent guy.",
        "Holden: There's no way that ever would have happened.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Noah never got a chance to see that because I barged in with the cops and I ruined everything. So -- I don't know what to do. I really love him.",
        "Holden: Well, then maybe you should pay attention to what Noah says.",
        "Luke: What, that he's dumping me?",
        "Holden: No, that he needs a break for a while. It's not forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I also have a little something for you ladies.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh. So, I get to get paid and have fun.",
        "Kim: You betcha.",
        "Janet: Wow, thank you.",
        "Kim: Thank you again. Now, see you soon.",
        "Liberty: Bye.",
        "Janet: Bye.",
        "Liberty: Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Janet: Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. Here.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Janet: Well, I have a little something special for you.",
        "Liberty: Mom, don't do that.",
        "Janet: Come on, yeah, you were a guest today, too. Now go buy yourself something special for the first day of summer school.",
        "Liberty: Really? Oh, thank you so much.",
        "Janet: Go. Get out of here.",
        "Liberty: I love you.",
        "Janet: I love you.",
        "Liberty: Bye. Mwah. See you.",
        "Brad: Hey, I know it was rough for a lot of years. But you got it right. She is an awesome kid.",
        "Janet: I am so excited that you asked. Thank you so much for giving me a ride back to the hotel.",
        "Brad: Well, it's the least I could do considering you saved my buns today.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's funny. I enjoyed every second of it.",
        "Brad: Okay, Janet. Well, I guess I'll -- is that guy still staying here?",
        "Janet: Uh, yeah, I guess so. Um, could you walk me up to my room, please?",
        "Brad: Has he been hassling you?",
        "Janet: I'd just think it's better if he knows that you're hanging around.",
        "Brad: Okay. Yeah, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Do you love Noah enough to give him what he asks for?",
        "Lily: Holden, you're making it sound so simple. Luke wants to know what if that doesn't work? I mean, what if while Luke is giving him space, Noah just moves further and further away?",
        "Holden: Well then what they had isn't worth that much, is it?",
        "Luke: Okay, well, I guess, you know what, you're both right. There's more than one way to handle this. I just -- I just hope I pick the right way.",

        "Parker: Sage is at the Morgan's. Does J.J. really have strep?",
        "Carly: Yep, he really does. Thanks for helping out today.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I just want J.J. to get better. I mean, we may fight and everything, but still --",
        "Carly: You know, you're allowed to say you love him.",
        "Parker: So am I going to have to like move out of my room and fumigate everything that he's touched?",
        "Carly: You know, that might not be a bad idea. He's gonna stay in bed for a while.",
        "Parker: Is he going to get better in time for camp?",
        "Carly: Probably not. Looks like you're gonna be doing that on your own this summer.",
        "Parker: Uh, do you still need me to help you? Like with J.J. or anything?",
        "Carly: No, your dad's here. Between the two of us, we've got things covered.",
        "Parker: Great, then I'm gonna go for a bike ride.",
        "Carly: Have a good time. Be careful.",

        "Janet: Hey, Brad. Before you go, could you just look up and down the hall, just to make sure that Bud's nowhere in sight, please?",
        "Brad: You're really freaked out that he's staying here, aren't you?",
        "Janet: I know it sounds stupid, and it's not it's not like he even really hurt me or anything, but he just he just got so mad so quick, you know. It just creeps me out.",
        "Brad: I'll have a talk with him.",
        "Janet: No. No, I don't want you to get arrested again. In fact, is there another hotel around here where I could stay?",
        "Brad: None that I would recommend.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay. You know, I'll be fine. There are hundreds of people around here. I've got three locks on the door. It's all good. You know, listen, just tell Liberty good night for me. Give her a kiss. Okay?",
        "Brad: I will. [Locks bolting] Janet, its Brad. Let me in.",
        "[Locks unbolting]",
        "Janet: Sorry it took me a while. I was moving some stuff.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I heard. Listen, you're so nervous about this guy Bud, why don't you come and stay at my place for one or two days? You know, maybe by then he'll be checked out.",
        "Janet: Oh, I don't want to be any trouble.",
        "Brad: Look, you cook, you clean, you'll be helping me out.",
        "Janet: Are you sure?",
        "Brad: You ask me again, I'm gonna change my mind.",
        "Janet: No, no, no. Good. I'm good. Just -- it'll just take me a second to pack my stuff. Hold on.",

        "Noah: I still need some time. But I let you think it was because of you, and it's not, Luke. Really, it's not.",
