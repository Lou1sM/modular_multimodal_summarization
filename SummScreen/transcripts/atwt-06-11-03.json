It's okay. Come in. Come \r\nin. So why were you at the \r\nmall? Are you guys on some \r\nsort of break or something? \r\nYou did sign out at the \r\nshelter, didn't you?",

        "Bonnie: Yep. That's where \r\nI got it. I only shop there \r\nbecause Lisa Grimaldi, who \r\nowns the place, is also my \r\ngodmother. And she likes to \r\nget my advice on what to \r\nstock. You know, to keep the \r\nplace kind of young and \r\ntrendy.",
        "Sarah: For real? Your \r\ngodmother owns the whole \r\nplace? So was all this \r\nstuff, like, free?",
        "Bonnie: I wish. But I \r\nwill say I probably spent \r\nmost of my paycheck there. \r\nBut, hey, that's why I work \r\nfor a living. And I don't \r\nsee myself stopping anytime \r\nsoon.",

        "Bonnie: Oh -- no, Sarah, \r\nit's nothing like that. It's \r\n-- actually, it's just tea. \r\nBut not just tea. It's very \r\ndelicious tea brewed in a \r\npot, with finger sandwiches \r\nand -- do you wanna try it? \r\nOkay, okay. First, let me \r\njust call Troy at the \r\nshelter, let him know you're \r\nhere. And then we'll drink \r\nour tea and do it up \r\nroyally.",

        "Bonnie: Call Troy? Of \r\ncourse I do. I mean, I don't \r\nknow all the rules at \r\nDurgin, but I'm pretty sure \r\nthe resident director has to \r\nknow where you are at all \r\ntimes. Yes. Troy Spencer, \r\nplease. Don't worry, Sarah. \r\nI think it'll be fine. I \r\njust -- I think it's best to \r\ncall. He's not there? Okay, \r\nthen, yes, I'd like to leave \r\na message.",

        "Margo: You know what? No \r\nmatter who thought this was \r\na good idea, it was not a \r\ngood idea. Dusty is missing. \r\nAnd as far as expecting him \r\nback anytime soon, I am not \r\nholding my breath.",
        "Rose: Dusty could be \r\nmissing for a lot of \r\nreasons. He has to earn \r\nSpangler's trust again to \r\nget information. That could \r\ntake time.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Or he could \r\nbe blowing smoke all this \r\ntime.",
        "Rose: He could also be in \r\ndanger, Dusty. Spangler \r\ncould have grabbed him and \r\nput him wherever Lily is. \r\nYou've gotta get the cops to \r\ngo look for him now.",

        "Rose: If you lock him up \r\nwhen he's this close to \r\nfinding her, you could kiss \r\nLily good-bye. You know \r\nthat.",
        "Margo: You know what I \r\nknow? I know that I like \r\nyou, but just because you \r\nare crazy enough to fall in \r\nlove with this guy does not \r\nmean that I'm crazy enough \r\nto go along with this.",
        "Rose: You're wrong. \r\nYou're wrong about Dusty. \r\nI'm telling you.",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah, yeah. \r\nOh, blah, blah, blah. Dusty \r\nDonovan, he's our only hope. \r\nLet me tell you -- no man \r\nhas ever been my only hope.",

        "Rose: Me. Spangler wanted \r\nme, huh? Instead of Lily. So \r\nwhy don't I trade me for \r\nLily? When that ransom call \r\ncomes, let me go, instead, \r\nokay?",
        "Margo: Rose, Rose -- I \r\nknow that you've got a big \r\nheart, and that's why you're \r\ndoing this. But let me tell \r\nyou something -- never in my \r\nentire career have I ever \r\nheard of a trade like this \r\nactually working. You're \r\nonly gonna complicate the \r\nissue even further. You're \r\nonly gonna put you and your \r\nsister at risk. Berger! \r\nRose! Please. Do not do \r\nanything foolish.",
