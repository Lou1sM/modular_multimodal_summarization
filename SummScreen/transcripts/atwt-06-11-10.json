        "Dusty: You want some company?",
        "Janet: When it's you, always.",
        "Dusty: How'd you and Lib sleep?",
        "Janet: Oh, you know, I mean -- it's the Lakeview. It's fine. But it's not home.",
        "Dusty: Eh, you get used to it.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Janet: Not unless you give me the keys to the kitchen. I'll tell you, if they don't finish painting our house soon, I'm going to go insane.",
        "Dusty: Did Liberty's school post her grades yet?",
        "Janet: And graduation is in a few hours, and we still don't know if she made it. She got mad at me because I was up there staring at her. I don't blame her, you know? I was. I came down here so I can give her some space.",
        "Dusty: Well, you don't want her to graduate anyway, do you? You want her to stay right here with you for the rest of her life.",
        "Janet: That was yesterday, when I was crazy.",
        "Dusty: Past tense, huh?",
        "Janet: Today, I am perfectly sane. If Liberty doesn't graduate, I -- I don't even want to think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Thanks for coming.",
        "Parker: What are you doing in a hotel room?",
        "Liberty: Mom and I are staying here while they paint our house.",
        "Parker: Cool. So, what happened with the exams? Are you going to graduate today?",
        "Liberty: I don't know.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Parker: Why -- why not? Didn't they post the grades first thing in the morning?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, they did, but I'm afraid to look. I went to the website, and I entered my social-security number, and then I froze. I -- I couldn't bring myself to push the button.",
        "Parker: Want me to do it for you?",
        "Liberty: Would you?",
        "Parker: No problem.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Parker: You ready?",
        "Liberty: Just tell me what it says.",
        "Parker: Oh, no.",
        "Liberty: I failed?",
        "Parker: Congratulations.",
        "Liberty: What, you mean I did it?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: I get to graduate?",
        "Parker: Class of 2010.",

        "Faith: Ew. What if I want orange juice without your germy backwash?",
        "Gabriel: Your mom said I could finish it, and there's another one back there if you want.",
        "Faith: I lost my appetite.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, I'm sorry if my manners offend you. But then again, everything I do offends you, so whatever. It's not like I'm going to be here forever.",
        "Faith: Good.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, uh, you're good friends with Parker, right? What's his deal with Liberty?",
        "Faith: They used to be married.",
        "Gabriel: I mean now. Are they together or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Good morning. Oh, you look so comfortable in your natural habitat.",
        "Craig: I didn't think you'd show.",
        "Lucinda: Well, curiosity got the better of me. I just wondered to myself, \"What on earth does Craig want from me?\"",
        "Craig: Answers. How much time have you spent with Gabriel?",
        "Lucinda: Are you asking if I'm socializing with your delinquent --",
        "Craig: Just answer the damn question, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: He's living at Lily's place. Of course I see him en passant. Why?",
        "Craig: Because he seems to be channeling you, which I find peculiar, since as you say, you barely know one another.",
        "Lucinda: Channeling me? [Laughing] What on earth does that mean?",
        "Craig: It's almost as if he's quoting you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, with my usual flair? That's preposterous.",
        "Craig: Is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry things got so out of hand yesterday.",
        "Carly: So am I. I hate fighting with you.",
        "Jack: Me too.",
        "Carly: I'm just worried about Parker. Please tell me you understand that.",
        "Jack: I do. We're on the same side. You know that, right? So -- [Sighs] Okay, about Parker and what happened before the fire --",
        "Carly: Yeah? What about it?",
        "Jack: I have to tell you something.",
        "Carly: What? What is it?",
        "Jack: I asked Gabriel to come down to the station to answer a few more questions.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, why?",
        "Jack: Carly, I know that Gabriel is hiding something. And for Parker's sake, I have to find out what it is.",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack. What could Gabriel be hiding that's so important? We all know that Craig set the fire at Monte Carlo.",
        "Jack: Unfortunately, right now that's an assumption.",
        "Carly: He's the only one who had a motive! He needed the insurance money to cover what he stole from Parker.",
        "Jack: I understand, Carly. But until that comes out of Craig's mouth --",
        "Carly: Do you really need to hear him say it? Between the police department and the insurance investigators, they're going to prove it. He's not going to get away with it.",
        "Jack: And you're probably right. The arson's not what I'm concerned about.",
        "Carly: Oh I know where this is going, and I don't want to hear it.",
        "Jack: I didn't come here to get into a fight with you.",
        "Carly: Parker did not do anything wrong, Jack!",
        "Jack: Then let me prove it!",
        "Carly: What if you can't?",
        "Jack: Then we deal with it as a family. If we're honest and if we set the record straight, then we have a better shot. We can help Parker through this. We can. We're strong enough to handle this.",
        "Carly: You may be strong enough, Jack. I don't know about the rest of us.",
        "Jack: Carly, please. Let me find out the truth.",
        "Carly: Well, then go. You -- you've made up your mind. Just do what you have to do.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Liberty's extremely smart. She's not going to let a few math problems stand between her and her future.",
        "Janet: It's not just math. I mean, it's every --",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Janet: Uh-oh. Oh, please, heavenly father, please, please, please. It's a text. \"You better come back upstairs and change, or we're going to be late for graduation.\"",
        "Dusty: Let me see that. You know what this means, don't you?",
        "Janet: That means she did it.",
        "Dusty: She did it.",
        "Janet: My baby's going to graduate.",
        "[Dusty chuckles]",
        "Janet: Oh, my God! Oh, nothing can stop her now! Yay! Oh, I got to go change. You're coming, right?",
        "Dusty: I wouldn't miss it.",
        "Janet: Honey --",
        "Liberty: Mom, we did it!",
        "[Janet screams]",
        "Janet: Yay! Oh, Honey, I knew you would. I knew it, I knew it. I am so proud of you.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I am so proud of me, too, since I'm terrible.",
        "Janet: No! Honey, you deserve this. This is the best day of my life. I'm so happy, I feel like I'm going to explode! Yay!",
        "Parker: I should get going.",
        "Janet: Oh, oh, Parker, Parker, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you. I'm so sorry.",
        "Parker: It's fine. You're happy.",
        "Janet: No, I know, but listen. I want to thank you, too. Thank you for helping her, because you did something that I never could have done, and I want you to know that I am forever grateful.",
        "Parker: I'd do anything for Liberty, okay? And she knows that. Did she tell you about her speech?",
        "Janet: What speech?",
        "Liberty: The principal called and asked if I would say a few words at the ceremony. Nothing major.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? That's huge.",
        "Liberty: Please don't make me more nervous than I already am.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Um, all right. Uh, do you need some help?",
        "Liberty: No, no. It's under control.",
        "Janet: Okay. All right. Then you know what's going to happen? We're going to have the graduation, and then we're going to have a party, right? Okay? I'm going to call Jack and Teresa. And, Parker, can you come?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Janet: Okay, great. I'm going to get on the line right now. And, Liberty, invite anybody you want, all right?",
        "Liberty: Okay. Thanks, Mom.",
        "Janet: Yay!",
        "Liberty: Oh, I've got a lot to do to get ready. Would you call and invite Faith?",
        "Parker: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Do you think Parker and Liberty are just friends now, nothing more?",
        "Faith: Why do you care? It's not like she'd go for a loser like you anyway.",
        "Gabriel: It'd be better for you if she did.",
        "Faith: Why?",
        "Gabriel: Because, Faith, it's totally obvious that you're into Parker.",
        "[Cell phones ringing]",
        "Gabriel: Hello.",
        "Faith: Hi, Parker.",
        "Liberty: Gabriel, its Liberty.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, Liberty.",
        "Faith: What's up?",
        "Parker: Liberty's mom is throwing her a graduation party later, and she wanted me to invite you.",
        "Faith: So you're calling for her mom?",
        "Liberty: I'm graduating today.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, that's awesome. You did it. You passed everything.",
        "Liberty: I had a lot of help.",
        "Parker: No, no. Uh, I'm calling for me, and for Liberty, but she's busy getting dressed right now. And I know it's really last-minute.",
        "Faith: I'll be there.",
        "Gabriel: Do I have to wear a suit?",
        "Liberty: No, not if it's a deal breaker.",
        "Gabriel: Okay. So I'll see you later. So I'm a loser, huh? Liberty just invited me to her graduation.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Faith: Carly, hi.",
        "Carly: Good morning.",
        "Faith: I didn't know that you were coming over. Mom's not here.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm not here to see your mom. Gabriel, can I talk to you privately?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I didn't read the graduation e-mails before now because I didn't want to jinx myself, but the school's giving a party for the whole class at the Lakeview tonight, and since it's probably the last time I'm going to see some of these people --",
        "Janet: Honey, Honey, go. Enjoy yourself.",
        "Liberty: Sure. Can we celebrate another time?",
        "Janet: Honey, I'm going to be celebrating for weeks to come. I'm telling you, because I feel like I'm the one who graduated, and it's about damn time. Teresa and I are still going to have a party, though, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay. Go for it, Mom.",
        "Janet: Okay. Awesome. I don't have anything to wear.",
        "Liberty: Oh.",
        "Janet: I have nothing that's going to fit. This could be a real fashion emergency.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Parker: Uh, Faith said that she could come.",
        "Liberty: Great. Gabriel's coming, too.",
        "Parker: You invited Gabriel?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. He's my friend.",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Liberty: Don't be like this, okay? I want all my friends around me today. Can you just be cool with that?",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah of course. Be -- because today is about you, so you can invite whoever you want, even if it is Gabriel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Gabriel was giving me his litany of complaints against me, but something about the way he was speaking just seemed off. And suddenly I realized \"He sounds just like a filthy-rich woman of a certain age.\"",
        "Lucinda: I'm afraid you've lost me. Is there a question in there?",
        "Craig: Have you been feeding Gabriel his lines? Are you behind the false statement that he gave to the police about me attacking him?",
        "Lucinda: I have neither the time nor the inclination to pull strings on your kid.",
        "Craig: You were at the hospital when he came out of his coma.",
        "Lucinda: Lily had an attack of conscience -- misguided -- and of course I was there to support her.",
        "Craig: No, or muzzle her.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, ah! Would that I could. Alas --",
        "Craig: Tell me the truth, Lucinda. What were you doing hanging around my son's room?",
        "Lucinda: Now, look, there's no conspiracy. Just drop it. You -- you're desperate, aren't you? You're just grasping at straws.",
        "Craig: And methinks she doth protest too much, which makes me think I'm right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know you're going to the police station to talk to Jack, and I'd like you to stick to your story. Parker hit you, but that was before Craig knocked you out and he left you there to die in the fire. Please, just promise me you're going to say that no matter what.",
        "Gabriel: What do you mean \"No matter what\"?",
        "Carly: Just don't let Jack pressure you into saying anything else. I think you owe Parker at least that much.",
        "Gabriel: How do you figure that?",
        "Carly: It was his money you pocketed, remember? Come on, Gabriel. You got a nice place here with Lily. You have a chance at a fresh start. But only if you don't change what you've already told the police.",
        "Gabriel: Why should I?",
        "Carly: Exactly.",
        "Gabriel: All right, this has been a great talk, but I got to go.",
        "Carly: Remember, whatever Jack asks you, you --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Parker, I love you to death, but unless you can operate a curling iron, your services are no longer needed. Off with you.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Liberty: I'll see you later.",
        "Parker: See you. Hello.",
        "Teri: Hey, Parker! Hey, am I going to see you later?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Teri: Okay. [Gasps] You are graduating.",
        "Liberty: I know!",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Janet: Can you believe it?",
        "Teri: Yes. Of course I can believe it. I'm just so proud of both of you.",
        "Janet: Yay!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Janet: Oh, hold on. Hi -- [Gasps] Oh.",
        "Bellboy: Flowers for Ms. Liberty Ciccone.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Liberty: Thank you. They're beautiful.",
        "Janet: Oh, here you go. Thank you very much.",
        "Bellboy: Congratulations.",
        "Teri: Who are they from?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. There's no card. Mom, I know this sounds stupid, but it's almost like Dad somehow --",
        "Janet: Oh, here it is.",
        "Liberty: Oh. \"I knew you could do it. Love, Jack.\"",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Janet: Oh, gosh. At this rate, we're never going to get ready.",
        "Dusty: Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Dusty: I guess I'm a little late.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. A girl can never have too many flowers.",
        "Liberty: They're beautiful. Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I think you went into Gabriel's hospital room where you had a captive audience and you pressured him to lie to the police.",
        "Lucinda: He didn't lie.",
        "Craig: Well, obviously he did, because I didn't attack him.",
        "Lucinda: Oh God, it's just like you. It's so like you. You commit horrific crimes, and then you blame somebody else.",
        "Craig: I'm not a murderer.",
        "Lucinda: In this instance only because Gabriel didn't die.",
        "Craig: How did you get to him, Lucinda? Was it your typical M.O. where your wallet is always willing to buy someone's soul?",
        "Lucinda: This is so tedious. It's really tedious. Why -- why would I want? What would I have to gain from that?",
        "Craig: The pleasure of my misery.",
        "Lucinda: Ah. Yeah, yeah. But, why would I waste my time?",
        "Craig: I know you're responsible for turning my son against me.",
        "Lucinda: Where's the proof?",
        "Craig: Well, let's see. Tom could always subpoena the hospital for their security videos. Shouldn't take too long to find out if you spent any time alone with Gabriel.",
        "Lucinda: Well, so what if I did? If I were to have done it, after all, he's part of the family.",
        "Craig: Yeah. The maid's family. I wonder if Lily would like to hear any of this. She's feeling so guilty right now, there's no way that she would lie to me. And if she's not aware of your recent antics, I'm sure she'd be interested to hear about them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Okay, do you think we need to get a banner or something?",
        "Dusty: I don't think so. I mean, Liberty's not even coming.",
        "Teri: I know, but it's Jan's day, too you know, and I want it to be special.",
        "Dusty: It's going to be special.",
        "Teri: Okay. Hey, nice touch with those flowers you got Libby today.",
        "Dusty: Not very original.",
        "Teri: Yeah. I noticed you looked a little hurt that Jack's got there first.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Dusty: Jack's her uncle, wise guy.",
        "Teri: Yeah. How do you -- how do you feel about everything that's going on?",
        "Dusty: I'm crazy about your sister, and you know that. I wish she'd put the engagement ring on.",
        "Teri: Oh, Dusty, you just can't -- you can't force her to do anything. She'll let you know when she's ready.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, she'd be ready if she wasn't --",
        "Teri: Pregnant with another man's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Okay. No, no, no, no. That's good. It'll hold.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Liberty: Okay. How do I look?",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Janet: You look like you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I know, Honey. I'm so sorry. I just remember when you were this big. And now you're old enough to graduate.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Liberty: Oh don't start. We don't have time to fix our makeup.",
        "Janet: I know. You're right. You're right. Okay.",
        "Liberty: God, it's funny. You think I'm still a kid, but I feel so old. And the kids at school seem young, too, like they're children but I'm not anymore.",
        "Janet: Your childhood was harder than it should have been. But from now on, it's going to be smooth sailing.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Janet: Be happy, Honey. You deserve it. Oh.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, Mom, where were you? Did you get my text about Liberty's graduation party?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I did. I'm just going to run upstairs and change. I'll be ready in a minute, all right?",
        "Parker: Where's Dad though? Is he coming with us?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Well, he -- he's coming. He's just not -- he's not going to go with us.",
        "Parker: Why not? What -- what's going on?",
        "Carly: Nothing. He just had to work, so he's going to go from the station. That's all. The important thing is that we're all going to be there for Liberty to help her celebrate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm glad you came in.",
        "Gabriel: I didn't realize I had a choice.",
        "Jack: The D.A.'s bringing Craig's case in front of the grand jury in a couple days.",
        "Gabriel: So?",
        "Jack: So they're going to have questions.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, well, I've already told you everything I know.",
        "Jack: Yeah. There's some inconsistencies with your story, however. For example, the paper weight that you said Craig hit you over the head with -- it's actually a glass figurine, very fragile. It would have shattered on impact. Can you explain why that didn't happen?",
        "Gabriel: No. I was actually out cold.",
        "Jack: Right. Of course. Yeah, the E.R. report says that, um, you suffered blunt-force trauma to the head.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah.",
        "Jack: You told Margo that you had hit your head before in your fight with Parker, so there would have been two head injuries. It would have been next to impossible for Craig to hit you in the same exact spot, don't you think?",
        "Gabriel: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Your stories don't match up, Gabriel. And if you perjure yourself on the witness stand under oath in front of a grand jury, you will go to jail. So I'm giving you one last chance. Tell me the truth. I know it's hard to admit you made a mistake, but it can be rectified. You can still do the right thing. Look at me.",
        "Gabriel: No, I didn't make a mistake, okay? I -- I can't explain the bump on my head or the angel, but -- but there has to be an explanation, because I'm telling the truth. Okay, my father tried to kill me, and he needs to be punished for it. Can I go now?",
        "Jack: Sure. Go on.",

        "Carly: Oh. Right. You know, I was just going to get changed myself. If you want to wait, we could all head out together.",
        "Parker: You look pretty.",
        "Faith: Thanks. I'm glad Liberty invited me. Although I'm surprised she invited Gabriel. Guess that seals the deal.",
        "Parker: What deal?",
        "Faith: Liberty likes him. I was right, Parker. You need to move on.",
        "Parker: I don't want to talk about this, okay?",

        "[Lucinda chuckles]",
        "Lucinda: \"Assuage.\" This is desperate -- a desperate attempt to cover up your own misdeeds. Trying to kill your own child -- filicide I think they call it -- they should rename that. Call it Montgomery syndrome.",

        "Parker: My dad's been asking him a lot of questions, and I think he may have figured it out.",
        "Faith: So what does that mean? You really did it?",
        "Parker: I -- I don't know. I mean, I had no idea that there was going to be a fire. But I did leave him there. I mean, he was breathing, but he was unconscious. And if it turns out that Craig didn't do it, then I could end up going to jail after all.",
        "Faith: No way. Your father would not do that to you.",
        "Parker: I don't know. He may not have a choice.",
        "Faith: Parker --",
        "Parker: No, no. I -- I don't think there's anything I can do now to fix it. But -- but what I'm worried about is Gabriel. I mean, he was willing to -- to make up a story and send his own father to jail for something that he possibly didn't even do.",
        "Faith: That is cold.",

        "Lucinda: I think you do. Your father's grand-jury hearing is imminent. I don't think you can stand up to the pressure, so it's better to get out of town before that's an issue.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, what if I say no?",
        "Lucinda: That would be a mistake.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, or I could just tell Aunt Margo that you bribed me about her brother.",
        "Lucinda: I would deny it.",
        "Gabriel: I'll show her the cash.",
        "Lucinda: Do you take me for an amateur? Besides, I know every drudge in town. Campaign contribution here and there, and you might end up digging ditches.",
        "Gabriel: I don't believe you.",
        "Lucinda: You have a choice. Do you want to be incarcerated and poor in Oakdale? Do you want to be fancy-free and rich elsewhere? There's only one catch -- you love that word, \"Catch.\" You've got to decide right now.",

        "[Applause]",
        "[Liberty clears throat]",
        "Liberty: When I first came to this school, all I wanted to do was cut class. And I ditched a lot. I guess I wanted a little more drama in my life. But be careful what you wish for, because since then, my life has been nothing but drama. I will spare you all the gory details. Most of you already know them anyway. And that's not what matters today. The important thing is I would not be standing here if it weren't for the people who loved me and fought for me and with me and made me realize what's really important. You didn't give up on me, even when it would have been the easier thing to do. I want to thank all of my teachers for letting me make up my work and take all my exams up to the very last minute. And I would like to thank Parker Snyder. I used to be nice to him just so he would do my math homework, but that all changed when I realized what an awesome guy he is. He sat by my bedside the entire time I was sick, even when it got really ugly, and he never looked away. And even yesterday, he rallied the troops to help me prepare for my exams. And no, he didn't do my math homework this time. When it comes to Parker, the word \"Friend\" does not even begin to cover it. And then there's my mom -- hi, Mom -- who sacrificed so much for me and taught me that no matter how hard things are, life can still be an adventure and full of fun. Whenever I fell down or messed up, I always knew you'd be there to pick me up. Okay, so please don't stop, because a high-school diploma doesn't guarantee that I'll never do anything stupid again. I'm always, always going to need you with me. There's, um, one person I wish with all my heart could be here today, and that's my dad. He's the real reason I'm graduating. I know this sounds nuts, but um, even after he died, when I wanted to drop out, he convinced me that I needed to stay in school. And he told me that whenever I missed him, I could look up in the stars, and he'd be there, looking back down at me. Except we're inside right now, and it's the middle of the day. But he's always with me. I'm so lucky. I have an awesome family and amazing friends and an incredible future as bright as, well, the stars. Thank you.",

        "Jack: I know it wasn't easy raising a child all by yourself, especially someone who takes after her father as much as Liberty does. But wherever Brad is, know that he's looking down with pride and gratitude. You're one hell of a lady, Janet, and one incredible mother. Congratulations on a job well-done.",
        "Dusty: Hear, hear.",
        "Teri: Yes.",
        "Janet: Thank you. Well, it's my turn. When Liberty and I first came to Oakdale, we, uh -- we were here to see one person, and we weren't sure that he was going to be happy to see us. But Bradley was. And the minute he found out that Liberty was his daughter, he loved her from that moment on. And I think you all have taken us into your hearts and your homes, and I speak for both Liberty and I when I say that we will be eternally grateful and we love you both. Thank you.",

        "Gabriel: Hey. Come with me.",
        "Liberty: I can't just leave. It's my graduation party.",
        "Parker: I can't believe it. He shows up, and he's bullying her already. You know what? Stay away from Liberty, okay?",
        "Liberty: Parker, don't cause a scene.",
        "Parker: No, you should not be hanging out with this guy. He's a cheat and a liar.",
        "Liberty: What are you talking about?",
        "Parker: My dad brought him in for more questioning today. He thinks that Gabriel's trying to send his dad to jail for something he didn't even do.",
        "Gabriel: Don't listen to him, Liberty. He doesn't know what he's talking about.",
        "Parker: Right, so that's why you showed up at my house and threatened me to get my dad to back off.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: You did that?",
        "Parker: What, you think I'd make that up?",

        "Parker: You should know that there was a fight at the party, and Liberty took off with Gabriel.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. Oh, no. Last time that happened, he stole a car, and they ended up in jail. We've got to find them be -- before something bad happens.",

        "Liberty: I really miss you, Dad. Nothing has gone right since you died, not even today. It was all going perfectly, and then it just went to pieces. Are you following me?",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, sort of. Look, I just wanted to apologize for ruining your graduation party. I only came here to say goodbye.",
        "Liberty: Where are you going?",
        "Gabriel: Just anywhere, somewhere else not here.",
        "Liberty: Parker was right. You lied about Craig, and now you're leaving town so you don't have to admit he never hit you.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, come on. Look, it's more complicated than that.",
        "Liberty: No, it's not! You just hate him, so you decided to send him to prison. [Voice breaking] Look, I know Craig is not perfect, but at least he's alive. Do you have any idea what I would give to have my father here with me? You are so lucky, and you're too stupid to realize it.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, I don't know. Maybe you're right, okay? But I just don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.",
        "Liberty: Well, I do. Stay here and tell the truth. No matter how hard your childhood was, it's over, okay? You can't change it. And whatever Craig did, he didn't do it intentionally. He didn't even know about you. You can't make him pay for something he didn't even do just so you can get revenge.",
