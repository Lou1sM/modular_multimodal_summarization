        "Bonnie: Okay. Okay, fine. \r\nYou're right. I should have \r\ndriven her right back to \r\nthat shelter, but I was \r\nafraid that I would shut her \r\ndown, and she'd crawl back \r\ninto her shell again. Now, I \r\nknow Troy did not agree with \r\nwhat I did, but I could've \r\nhandled things, Mom. \r\nUnfortunately, I could \r\nbarely get anything out of \r\nmy mouth before you started \r\nwith your whole attorney \r\nthing, speaking for me.
