        "Jack: One, two, three --",
        "Hannah: Now, don't forget to pace yourselves. And, Jack, make sure you \r\nget her to rest between \r\ncontractions when they come. \r\nLabor's hard work. If it's a \r\nlong one, she's going to \r\nneed some reserves, \r\nespecially when she goes \r\ninto transition.",
        "Mike: Look, I read somewhere that if the labor goes on too long, it can \r\ncause stress to the baby.",
        "Hannah: True.",
        "Mike: Well, how long's too long?",
        "Jack: Oh, don't sweat it, Mike. That'll be up to Carly and her doctor.",
        "Mike: Jack, I know that you want to forget this could be my child, but \r\nthat is why I came here, to \r\nbe kept informed.",
        "Jack: You're worrying about stuff that hasn't happened, probably won't \r\nhappen. Carly doesn't need \r\nto be thinking about \r\nworst-case scenarios right \r\nnow.",
        "Katie: He was only asking a question.",
        "Hannah: Do they do this every time they're in the same room?",
        "Carly: Yes. And I have had enough. Out! Everybody except Hannah get out \r\nof my sight!",
        "",
        "Hal: Let's not go jumping to any conclusions. This investigation is \r\nstill open.",
        "Walker: Lieutenant Munson is correct. So far, the toxicology report \r\nonly tells us that Nurse \r\nKrebs had a high level of \r\npotassium in her blood \r\nserum. This caused a heart \r\nattack. We suspect she was \r\ngiven an injection of \r\npotassium chloride.",
        "Chris: What's the next step?",
        "Walker: Exhume the other alleged victims, examine their bodies, compare \r\nthe post-mortem and \r\npre-death levels of \r\npotassium. At which point I \r\nwill determine if her \r\ncardiac arrest was also \r\ninduced by potassium \r\nchloride injections.",
        "Bob: But until you can prove that the deaths are linked, it's all \r\nsupposition. I mean, there's \r\nno positive proof that \r\nthere's a serial killer \r\nrunning around Memorial.",
        "Walker: Well, thank you, Bob. That is true. There is no proof yet. But \r\nI've seen this pattern \r\nbefore. Which is why it is \r\nimperative that we find that \r\nmedication vial that Katie \r\nFrasier found in Myrtle \r\nScott's room. It's likely \r\nNurse Krebs knew it \r\ncontained potassium \r\nchloride. And, well, if she \r\nwas about to call the police \r\n--",
        "Bob: That would give the killer a good reason to murder her.",

        "Alison: Oh, my God. This is the medicine bottle everybody's been \r\nlooking for at the hospital.",
        "Gordo: It is not.",
        "Alison: You had this all along.",
        "Gordo: Just give it to me, Alison.",
        "Alison: What were you doing with it?",
        "Gordo: It's just garbage.",
        "Alison: Well, then why did you bring it all the way over here? And why \r\ndidn't you tell the cops \r\nabout it? \"Potassium \r\nChloride\"? What is that? Can \r\nit kill somebody?",
        "Gordo: Don't even go there. You've got the wrong idea.",
        "Alison: Which idea's the wrong one? That you were trying to pin \r\nsomething on my mother? Or \r\nme? Because you were afraid \r\nthat some --",
        "Gordo: I can explain. Just give me the bottle. Alison? Give me the \r\nbottle. Look, I'll tell you \r\nhow this whole thing got so \r\nmessed up. Just let me have \r\nthe bottle. It's no big \r\ndeal.",
        "Alison: No big deal, really?",
        "Gordo: Really.",
        "Alison: Well, then I'll just take it back to the hospital myself.",
        "Gordo: Sorry, I can't let you do that. You're not going anywhere.",

        "Lily: I cannot believe, that after everything that Dusty has done to \r\nyou, that you think he's the \r\none that's gonna come to our \r\nrescue.",
        "Rose: Look, I know you think I'm nuts to believe in that guy. But since \r\nwe're not going anywhere for \r\na couple of minutes, I think \r\nwe need to agree to disagree \r\nabout Dusty.",
        "Lily: Fine. We agree to disagree.",
        "Rose: And what does it matter who rescues us, anyway? Right? As long as \r\nwe get out of here. And we \r\nwill, real soon. I bet you \r\nthey're doing it right now. \r\nMs. Walsh has probably got \r\nall the money. Dusty's \r\ndealing with that Spangler \r\ncreep. We're gonna get out \r\nof here. I can feel it. I \r\ncan feel it in my bones. \r\nReal soon.",
        "Lily: I don't think it'll be as easy as you say, Rose. And I can feel \r\nthat in my bones.",

        "Holden: Why are you putting him under arrest?",
        "Margo: I found evidence on him.",
        "Dusty: Spangler planted evidence on me after he knocked me out.",
        "Holden: You met with Spangler? What did he say about Lily?",
        "Margo: Lily's not our only problem anymore, Holden.",
        "Holden: What now?",
        "Margo: He's got Rose, too.",
        "Holden: How did that happen?",

        "Holden: Where are Lily and Rose? Where are they?",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right. Don't even bother. Don't even \r\nbother.",
        "Cop: Detective? There's something you need to hear. Incoming call on \r\nthe tap on Rose D'Angelo's \r\nphone.",
        "Margo: Guys, I need quiet.",
        "Spangler: I'm ready to make the drop-off. Awaiting instructions on when \r\nand where. Send only one man \r\n-- Dusty Donovan -- or the \r\ndeal is off.",
        "",
        "Hannah: All right. You can come back inside when you learn to behave. \r\nOut.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Hannah: You can tell her that as soon as you learn to control yourself. \r\nOut. Bye.",
        "Carly: Thank you. You know, Katie was just telling me about this \r\nwonderful book that she \r\nfound about Native-American \r\nbirth rituals.",
        "Hannah: Hmm, she's a busy one.",
        "Carly: Did you know that, in some tribes, laboring women would separate \r\nthemselves from the men? \r\nThey would go off with the \r\nelder women to a -- to \r\nwhat's called a birthing \r\ntree. Doesn't that sound \r\nlike a dream? A really \r\nspecial spot where you can \r\nhave some peace and \r\npreparation.",
        "Hannah: Mm, I'll take a long weekend in a four-star hotel. Now, we may \r\nnot have ourselves a \r\nbirthing tree, but you sure \r\ndo need some of that peace \r\nand preparation. The sooner \r\nthe better.",
        "Carly: Are you saying what I think you're saying?",
        "Hannah: You're almost there, Carly. Your baby's almost ready for the \r\nworld.",
        "Carly: But I'm not ready for her. I've got two men out there who are \r\nonly interested in what they \r\nwant.",
        "Hannah: Well, what do you want? For yourself and your daughter? \r\nWhatever it is, you better \r\nfind a way to lay it on the \r\nline for both those men. And \r\nthey better find a way to \r\naccept it.",
        "",
        "Jack: Okay, look, I know it's a weird situation, and no one's sure how \r\nto handle this. But if we \r\ncould make an effort to -- \r\nlook, even if we don't get \r\nalong, we try not to tick \r\neach other off. What do you \r\nsay?",
        "Mike: You got it.",
        "Jack: So what's that you're making?",
        "Mike: It's for the baby. My -- my father made something like this for \r\nme and my brother before we \r\nwere born. And I don't know, \r\nI always wanted to make one \r\nfor my kid.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna get some air.",
        "Katie: More air? We're outside.",
        "Jack: Space, Katie. I need space.",
        "Katie: Okay, wait -- sorry. I know this is none of my business. But \r\nsince I am here, stuck in \r\nthe middle of everything, I \r\nthink I have a right to put \r\nmy two cents in.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Can we stop you?",
        "Katie: No. Look, this is not time to be having a turf war, you guys. \r\nThere is a woman inside \r\nabout to do the most \r\nmiraculous thing that a \r\nhuman being can do. She's \r\nabout to bring a new person \r\ninto this world. So that is \r\nwhat we should be \r\nconcentrating on. Okay?",
        "Mike: What do you want us to do?",
        "Katie: Have a celebration.",
        "Jack: What kind of celebration? I don't think Carly's in shape for a \r\nparty right now.",

        "Gordo: Alison, you know I can't let you leave the house with that \r\nbottle. Just hand it over, \r\nwe can forget all about it.",

        "Gordo: It's complicated.",
        "Alison: Then simplify it for me.",

        "Alison: Go on.",
        "Gordo: When Katie found that vial under Mrs. Scott's bed, I thought Dr. \r\nHughes had dropped it there. \r\nPeople were already \r\nquestioning him behind his \r\nback, accusing him of \r\nsending patients to the \r\nmorgue. It wasn't fair. And \r\nI didn't want it to get \r\nworse.",
        "Alison: That doesn't explain why you held onto this thing.",
        "Gordo: I didn't hold onto anything. I found it in my lab coat today.",
        "Alison: Well, then why didn't you take it to the police?",
        "Gordo: Because I've made a few mistakes around the hospital. Nothing \r\nbig. But now that the police \r\nare hot to find the suspect, \r\nI was afraid they'd pick me. \r\nNot that I'd done anything, \r\nbut I don't play by the \r\nrules. And neither do you. \r\nThat doesn't make us bad \r\npeople, just misunderstood. \r\nYou know how it feels to not \r\nbe trusted. Nothing you do \r\nis right. Something goes \r\nwrong, you're guilty.",
        "Alison: I guess I do know the feeling.",
        "Gordo: Then cut me some slack, okay? Help me get rid of that bottle. My \r\ncareer's at stake here. You \r\ndo me this one favor, I'll \r\nnever forget it.",

        "Margo: When hell freezes over.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about? Spangler said --",
        "Holden: I don't give a damn what Spangler said.",
        "Margo: Nobody is giving anybody a red cent. If you think that I would \r\nlet you deliver ransom \r\nmoney, you are out of your \r\nmind.",
        "Dusty: He's going to deal with me.",
        "Holden: Yeah, because that's the way you two set it up. You're the one \r\nwho's setting us all up. \r\nYou're probably setting up \r\nSpangler, too!",

        "Margo: I can't let you do that, Holden.",
        "Holden: Do you have a better plan?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I got a better plan. I'm gonna call the FBI. We'll set up \r\na negotiator.",

        "Holden: No, that's not what we want. We want them home. We want them \r\nhome safe.",
        "Dusty: Then put me on the street. If he shoots me, what do you care? \r\nI'm the only chance you got.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Let me break in here for a moment. This guy here is \r\nexactly what he is. And we \r\nhave no reason to trust him \r\nabout anything. On the other \r\nhand, it seems to me that \r\nright now, in this \r\nincidence, he's making sense \r\nand he's right. Let's just \r\ndo what the man says. Let's \r\njust do it. Let him do it.",

        "Rose: Well, then we should do what we can together to generate a lot of \r\npositive thoughts. Maybe we \r\ncan lead Holden and Lucinda \r\nand the rest of the cavalry \r\nright to us.",
