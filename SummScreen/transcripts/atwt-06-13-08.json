        "Meg: I know you didn't think Mike would be of help, but he was great. Paul, he told me something, and I think it's exactly what we need to blow Sofie and her lies right out of the water.",
        "Paul: Okay. What did he say?",
        "Meg: I will tell you all about it on our way to Winnetka.",

        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: If only that were true.",

        "Cole: Did you talk to Paul?",
        "Sofie: No.",
        "Cole: Listen, if he offers to pay you off, you could end up on top.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, and you get a cut, right? Do you ever think about anybody but yourself?",
        "Cole: I know why you think that. I know why you wouldn't believe me when I tell you --",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Cole: That I want to see you get a win here, Sofie. I really do. Maybe then I'll stop feeling so guilty.",
        "Sofie: Guilty?",
        "Cole: Yeah. We both know that what happened to you, it's all my fault.",

        "Holden: Need a hand?",

        "Jack: He's doing better.",
        "Parker: Poor kid.",
        "Jack: Okay, who are you, and why are you pretending to care about J.J.'s well- being?",
        "Parker: I'm worried about him, really.",
        "Jack: Yeah -- or maybe you're looking for another excuse to stay home from camp?",
        "Parker: Look, it just wouldn't feel right for me to be enjoying myself in the fresh air while he's here, sick as a dog.",
        "Jack: Don't ever get brought into interrogation. You're a terrible liar.",
        "Parker: Excuse me?",
        "Jack: This isn't about J.J., Parker. This is about that girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey! Is there some kind of diner emergency?",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Liberty: Then why the 911 call to get here at the freaking crack of dawn?",
        "Janet: I want you to take this.",
        "Liberty: Whoo. And my mission, if I choose to accept it, is? A t-shirt?",
        "Janet: It's Brad's. It's the one that I wore the night I spent the night.",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God. And you kept it as a souvenir?",
        "Janet: No! I wanted to wash it. But the only fabric softener I have is lemon verbena, and I knew that Brad wouldn't like that smell. And what if Katie smelled that smell --",
        "Liberty: Okay, crazy lady, stop talking about fabric softener and just tell me why I'm here.",
        "Janet: I want you to put it back in Brad's drawer without anyone knowing.",
        "Liberty: Without Katie knowing.",
        "Janet: Ah, smart girl!",
        "Liberty: And what exactly is the whole point of this?",
        "Janet: All right. Now that Katie's back in town, I don't want to make trouble where there isn't any.",
        "Liberty: You don't want to make trouble? Mom, that's what you live for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is it over?",
        "Holden: It's over.",
        "Carly: You do realize that I've spent my entire life doing anything I possibly could, legal or not, to never, ever have to live like this?",
        "Holden: It's not that bad.",
        "Carly: It's not bad?",
        "Holden: Things we do for our kids. Need a hand?",
        "Carly: Uh, no. I'll strap on my parachute and, um, do it myself, thanks. Oh!",
        "Holden: Oh, oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You are so mean to me!",
        "Liberty: It's called the truth.",
        "Janet: No, it's not! I am not the type of woman to steal a married man away from his wife, even if the -- never mind. Anyway, the other reason I called is because I'm off in about five minutes, and I thought maybe we can go get a mani-pedi. What do you say?",
        "Liberty: I would love to, but remember? I signed up for summer school.",
        "Janet: You're going?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. And I made a very firm promise to myself to show up, for the first day, at least. So, um, wish me luck on the whole t-shirt thing.",
        "Janet: Bye. Great! All right. Got the whole day. What am I gonna do with it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I just thought that after the talk we had, you'd want to hang out with that girl instead of going to an all-boys camp.",
        "Parker: Okay, it's not about her. It's about this --",
        "Jack: Tennis camp? Tennis camp? Parker, I mean, I -- I know you're a great tennis player and everything --",
        "Parker: That's why the coach offered me a job as an instructor.",
        "Jack: Stop it. You got a job? All by yourself? Parker -- that's great, Buddy! It is! It's great! I'm so proud of you! This shows initiative and responsibility and all kinds of wonderful grown-up things.",
        "Parker: So I can skip camp?",
        "Jack: Well, I'll give them a call this morning. Sure. I got -- I got to check with your mom first. Think she's up by now?",
        "Parker: Uh, don't think she'd want to miss the nature walk.",
        "J.J.: Dad, I think I'm gonna --",
        "[J.J. groans]",
        "Jack: I think he did.",

        "Carly: Well --",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Carly: Talk about falling out of bed. Yeah, ducky. Where, uh --",

        "Carly: My clothes. I thought they were here.",
        "Holden: Oh. Right here. Here you go.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[Whistle blowing]",
        "Carly: Oh. What is it with that Winkie and noise?",
        "Winkie: Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, you'd better get cracking, or you'll be late for the pancake-eating contest.",
        "Carly: Well, late for the pancake-eating contest. How will I go on?",
        "Holden: You know what? That attitude, it's not gonna get you your happy-camper badge. But I see through you.",
        "Carly: Do you?",
        "Holden: I do. You're afraid. You're afraid that you're not gonna make it through the pancake-eating contest, that you're gonna -- you're gonna fold after your first stack.",
        "Carly: Hey, Holden --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Carly: I can eat you under the mess hall table every day of the week and twice on Sunday.",
        "Holden: Really? Care to put a little money on that?",
        "Carly: 20 bucks.",
        "Holden: You're on. Easiest 20 bucks I ever made.",
        "Carly: Holden --",
        "Holden: I have to say, you did pretty good -- for a girl.",
        "Carly: I just didn't want to embarrass you in front of your children.",
        "Holden: Mm.",
        "Winkie: I can see we need to work on punctuality with this group. Orientation festival's about to begin.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, let me know when it's time for the nap festival.",
        "Sage: Mom, we signed you up.",
        "Winkie: That's right. Three-legged race is about to begin.",
        "Holden: They couldn't have put it before the pancake-eating contest, could they?",
        "Faith: Come on, Dad. It will be fun.",
        "Sage: Please, Mom?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm always looking for another opportunity to humiliate myself. All right, Partner.",
        "Sage: No, you're the wrong size. You and Holden run together, Faith and Natalie, and I'm taking pictures.",
        "Faith: Yeah, it's a rule. Married people have to race together.",
        "Sage: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: So, what Paul did is your fault?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I -- you were so vulnerable when I left you. And yeah, but you wouldn't even be with that loser in the first place if -- you went through hell, Sofie, and all I ever did was make it worse.",
        "Sofie: That sounded really sincere. You have always been very good at sounding really sincere.",
        "Cole: I get that it's tough to trust me right now, but --",
        "Sofie: But what?",
        "Cole: I want to help. You're in a really tricky place. Ryan and his legal team start digging big-time, you got a lot of lies going, you know? And that's not good for someone accusing someone else of rape.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, so what do I do about that?",
        "Cole: Move, fast, before he can find anything out.",
        "Sofie: You have got a lot of experience covering up lies and playing people.",
        "Cole: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I should make a move before he does.",
        "Cole: Yeah. I -- I think that's a good idea. I think you want to negotiate with him, not meet him in a courtroom.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I think I know what you're saying -- take the money and run.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, even if we can prove that Sofie lied about whatever high school she went to, that doesn't necessarily help us prove that she's lying about me now.",
        "Meg: It's not just about the high school. We're looking for a pattern. That she has a long history of making people believe things that aren't true.",
        "Paul: It's hard for me to believe that she's that much of a whack job.",
        "Meg: She plays the victim role really well. When I'm in the E.R., I see real rape victims come in. Sofie will pay for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sister Ann: Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, please come in.",
        "Meg: Thank you so much for seeing us, Sister. Now, I know envy is a sin, but your garden's unbelievable.",
        "Sister Ann: Mercy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Are you sure, Marty? Come on. I could really use the extra shift.",
        "Marty: Janet, you've worked your shift. Now go home.",
        "Janet: Go home? Go home and do what? Soup. That reminds me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So, I'll -- I'll meet you back here when class is over, okay?",
        "Dylan: You got it.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Dylan: Later.",
        "Liberty: Bye. Hey!",
        "Parker: So, uh, I guess you couldn't figure a way out of summer school, could ya?",
        "Liberty: Summer school does not start for 15 minutes, so my options are still wide-open. What are you doing here? I -- I thought you were on your way to kiddy, kiddy camp.",
        "Parker: No, I'm actually staying here and playing tennis this summer.",
        "Liberty: You got the job! That's awesome! I sure hope you know how to play.",
        "Parker: Oh, I -- I've seen people play before. You just hit a ball with a racquet. How hard can that be?",
        "Liberty: You are so going to get creamed.",
        "Parker: Oh, come on. It can't be that hard.",
        "Liberty: Want to bet?",
        "Parker: Yeah, maybe I do. Um, am -- am I holding this thing right?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it's great -- if you were a 60-year-old girl. Okay, okay. Here's the idea. You're gonna try and hit it back to me.",
        "Parker: Like -- like they do on TV, right?",
        "Liberty: This is so not going to be pretty. I guess that's what you'd call beginner's luck.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Now we're gonna try serving.",
        "Parker: Serving?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it's, um -- it's when you hit the ball, and then I kill it.",
        "Parker: Oh, kind of like you just did, right? Okay. Uh, here we are.",
        "Liberty: Oh, wow! You're -- you're just a real, regular Andy Roddick, aren't ya?",
        "Parker: Oh, I've -- I've seen him before. He -- he kind of does it like this, right?",
        "Liberty: Are you sure you've never played tennis before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Okay, we can do this.",
        "Winkie: Okay, everybody. On your mark, get set, go!",
        "Holden: Go!",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "[Whistle blows]",
        "Sage: Come on! Come on, Mom!",
        "Carly: Oh!",
        "Sage: Say cheese!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, when we started thinking about high school for Miranda, I remember my friend saying how amazing this sacred heart school was and -- and how challenging it was, but warm and caring.",
        "Sister Ann: It's always nice to hear that our alumni appreciate us.",
        "Meg: Well, the sad thing is, I've lost touch with my friend, and I would love for Miranda to be able to speak to her directly.",
        "Sister Ann: Oh, but we have an alumni database. I can get that information for you. So, your friend's name is?",
        "Meg: Sofie, or maybe Sofia, Duran -- D-U-R-A-N. She, uh, probably graduated three, four years ago.",
        "Sister Ann: D-U-R-A-N?",
        "Meg: That's right.",
        "Sister Ann: I'm sorry. We've never had a student with that last name.",
        "Meg: Is that right? Um, are there any other Sacred Heart academies?",
        "Sister Ann: There are many, but we're the only one in Winnetka. Are you sure she said Winnetka?",
        "Meg: Absolutely sure.",
        "Paul: Guess Sofie's more screwed up than we thought.",
        "Meg: Okay, so, we know she lied about high school. So now we need to find out why. What was she covering up?",
        "Paul: Maybe, you know, she just wanted to seem really important, that she went to a really good school.",
        "Meg: You're not defending her?",
        "Paul: No, no, no. I -- look, she's accusing me of rape. It's not okay with me. It's just that the whole thing kind of makes me sad. Maybe when I tell her --",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. Paul, you're not telling her anything. I'll handle this.",
        "Paul: You really think that's a good idea?",
        "Meg: Every time you deal with Sofie, things end up being worse. If anybody's gonna talk to her, it will be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi!",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: I was just, uh, passing by. I thought I'd pick up my tureen.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, sorry. I -- I didn't get a chance to wash it out.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's okay. I'll do it. How's J.J.? Did the soup help?",
        "Jack: Well, he's, uh -- well, yeah. It was -- it was great. He had a bit of a relapse this morning, though.",
        "J.J.: Dad, can you come up here for a minute, please?",
        "Janet: Uh, go, go, go. I'll take care of the tureen.",
        "Jack: Okay. Yeah, it should be on the counter by the sink.",
        "Janet: Okay. Oh! Oh, yeah. You're Brad's brother, all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Game and set.",
        "Liberty: You little twerp, acting like you have never played tennis before.",
        "Parker: See, here's the difference between us -- I don't brag about my talents. And you say that you have some, which you don't, like kissing.",
        "Liberty: Well, I want a rematch.",
        "Parker: At what, kissing or tennis? 'Cause I'm a pro at both.",
        "Liberty: Ooh! You don't want to know what you really are.",
        "Parker: Uh, the winner? Guy that beat you?",
        "Liberty: No, the guy who ends up alone. Hey, Dylan. Where have you been?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Janet? Wow.",
        "Janet: Hi. I -- hope you don't mind. I -- I tidied up a little bit.",
        "Jack: A little? Looks like an operating room in here. Except it smells like Italy.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's the basil and the tomato sauce. Tuscany. You ever been there? Always wanted to go. You know that movie where that woman, she moves to Tuscany, and she lives in that big, huge mansion? I'm telling you, she can have the boyfriend. I just want that mansion and that view of Tuscany.",
        "Jack: Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back -- back to Oakdale. Why'd you do all this?",
        "Janet: Because you need help. J.J.'s sick. It takes a village.",
        "Jack: Right. It's just that --",
        "Janet: Oh. Oh, I did it again.",
        "Jack: Did what?",
        "Janet: I, uh -- I just have this tendency of crossing this, uh -- this line. It -- it must be invisible. That's why I never see it. Anyway, I -- I push myself on people until I -- I'm just gonna take the soup tureen and go, all right? No problem. I'll get out of your hair. Hey, listen, tell J.J. that I hope he feels better.",
        "Jack: Janet, hold on. Wait. You don't -- you don't have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're gonna do great. You know that, don't you?",
        "Sage: If I don't like it, can I call you?",
        "Carly: Well, sure, but I bet you're gonna forget all about me.",
        "Sage: No.",
        "Carly: You have to stay and fill me in on the further adventures of Winkie.",
        "Sage: Don't joke.",
        "Faith: Come on, Sage. We should go.",
        "Sage: Huh?",
        "Faith: Well, we got to pick out what you're gonna wear and what you're gonna sing for the talent show.",
        "Sage: Talent show?",
        "Faith: Yeah. It's at the end of the week. You have to be in it, because there's this lame girl who twirls a baton, and I bet her five bucks that you'd win. And the way you sing, it's a slam dunk. Come on.",
        "Sage: Bye, Mommy. Show Daddy my pictures.",
        "Carly: Got it. She was having trouble saying goodbye. But you knew that, didn't you, and you helped her? Thank you.",
        "Holden: Ready to go?",
        "Carly: Hmm. Hard to tear myself away. I'm gonna miss Winkie. I will miss Sage.",
        "Holden: I know. Let's get going.",
        "Carly: Okay. I've had enough fun to last a lifetime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sofie: Look, I already told you -- what are you doing here?",
        "Meg: I just stopped by to tell you its over, and you lost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you know what you are?",
        "Holden: That's a scary question.",
        "Carly: A good sport. And you make things fun that are inherently not fun -- organized games.",
        "Holden: You know, when it comes to the outdoor life, you're what? What's the word I'm looking for? You're -- well, you -- you're not good. You stink. You stink.",
        "Carly: But Holden, do you have any idea what it's like to go through life knowing -- just knowing that you are not good at three-legged races? Hey, pull over. Isn't it just beautiful?",
        "Holden: It's beautiful.",
        "[Engine turning over]",
        "Holden: Hey! [Tires screeching] Hey! Oh --",
        "Carly: They took your car?!",
        "Holden: My cell's in the car. Can you call 911?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, my cell's in the car, too. Should we start heading back for camp?",
        "Holden: That's 20 miles. We're out in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Carly: I had to stop. I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It's not your fault.",
        "Carly: Well, I got you into this mess. I'm gonna get you out.",
        "Holden: Yeah? What are you gonna do?",
        "Carly: I'm gonna secure you some transportation, big boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Just so you know, I -- it was very nice of you. I really appreciate it. It's just --",
        "Janet: This is a closed shop. I get it.",
        "Jack: No, no, it's not that. I just don't want to get caught up in the middle of some grand scheme you've worked out to get Brad back.",
        "Janet: Oh! You got me. Yeah, I knew that once Brad found out that I cleaned your kitchen, he would fall at my feet, and he'd get rid of the woman he really loves, and he'd be putty in my hands! Yeah. And the spaghetti sauce was just the icing on the cake. Ew! That leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",
        "Jack: So thank you. Thank you, really.",
        "Janet: Jack, you're Liberty's uncle, and J.J. is Liberty's cousin. I want her to know her family.",
        "Jack: Right. That was very nice of you.",

        "Sofie: I'm not lying about Paul. He really hurt me.",
        "Meg: But he didn't rape you, Sofie! That's not a word you throw around lightly. So you are gonna tell everybody that you have been lying, or I am going to take your life and rip it apart.",

        "Paul: Why? What happened?",
        "Meg: It kind of hit me, as weak as Sofie seems, she always has the upper hand. But I think she finally got the message. You know, I'll rant when I see you in person. I -- I need to go see your mom.",
        "Paul: Something wrong?",

        "Paul: Okay, will you calm down? Calm down.",
        "Sofie: What life? I don't have my baby, I don't have you, and I know I made a mess of things. And it's all my fault, and everything's my fault.",
        "Paul: Stop, stop! Hey, stop it now, okay? Look, it's not -- it's not all your fault. I'm not blameless.",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Paul: I -- I let you think things that weren't true. I led you on.",
        "Sofie: I hope you mean that. Because -- because it doesn't matter what she does to me. I know she thinks I deserve it. Maybe I do. But if you hated me, if she made you hate me, I don't think I could go on.",

        "Sofie: Why not? It's true.",
        "Paul: Sofie, you are looking at a guy who's made huge, huge mistakes. And you've been through a lot. Nobody blames you for snapping. Certainly not me. I don't hate you. Sofie, I could never hate you.",

        "Sofie: No, don't! Don't! Don't feel sorry for me! That's -- that's what she said I do -- Meg. She -- she said I -- I make people feel sorry for me and that I hurt them, and I don't want to be that! I don't want to be what she said!",
        "Paul: Well, then, don't. Don't be that. Don't do that. Don't -- don't pretend that you don't have choices, that you don't have options.",
