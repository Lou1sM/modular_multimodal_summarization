        "The City Times announces a contest; \"Six Keys to the Kingdom\" which requires partners to discover from clues in the paper where the keys are hidden. There are twelve keys and the first partnership to discover six of them, wins $300,000.00. Partners are: Susan and Emily, Chris and Allison, Aaron and Curtis, Tom and Casey and it wasn't clear if Henry ever found a partner, even though he tried to convince Katie. Tom and Casey found the first key. Margo delivered some legal papers to Kim at WOAK and Doc followed her to the courtyard. They kissed, but Margo again reiterated her fears, suddenly stumbling and Doc falling on top of her. Allison, who went looking at the courtyard for a key, found them in a compromising position. Simon paid off Pilar and Russ, but when Pilar found that Mike still wants nothing to do with her, she went to the cottage threatening to tell Katie about their plan."

        "Emily: Oh come on -- which is exactly why we never see each other unless something terrible happens. Come on, this is fun. This is a good thing. Little mother-daughter bonding? And enough prize money to send us both to the islands every February for the rest of our lives?",
        "Susan: Ooh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: It's a treasure hunt. Okay, there are teams. But each team only consists of two people. We help each other solve the clues and find out where the keys are hidden.",

        "Casey: To buried keys. And the first team to collect six keys wins. Dad said he'd do it with me.",
        "Tom: But then Dad thought, you know, he'd probably have a better chance of winning if he teamed up with Mom. Why? Because she knows everything.",
        "Margo: No, you stick with Dad, he's the winner.",
        "Casey: Okay, so we've gotta head downtown and register --",

        "Margo: Sure. Where do they go?",
        "Tom: Kim needs them right away first thing in the morning. Just drop by WOAK.",
        "Margo: No, sorry -- I can't. Sorry.",

        "Katie: If we won.",
        "Henry: \"If\" we won? What are you talking about? With your tricky little brain and my gift for the devious. We're naturals.",
        "Katie: It's just -- normally, I'd love to. But Simon's just --",

        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: Katie, if you were 1000% sure that Simon was the man of your dreams, you wouldn't think twice about spending an afternoon or two or three with me.",

        "Henry: And Mike?",
        "Katie: I thought this was about you.",

        "Katie: Henry --",
        "Henry: You love him.",
        "Katie: And he betrayed me. He sided with Pilar. And you and I ended up in that horrible mental hospital. And Simon rescued me. Okay, he's my husband and we were very happy with -- before he left --",
        "Henry: Twice.",
        "Katie: What is with you? I thought you liked Simon.",
        "Henry: I do like him. But if you're not happy --",
        "Katie: I am. Or I will be. If I work at it. And I will. Because Simon is worth the effort. I trust him, Henry. I know he wouldn't betray me.",

        "Alison: You forgot. This is the new me -- the smarter, saner Alison Stewart. No more schemes, no more shortcuts, no more plots and plans.",
        "Chris: But this is a legitimate --",
        "Alison: It's waste of time, and I'm shocked. Shocked, that my mature boyfriend who's a doctor, and should know better, would want me to focus on anything but the future.",
        "Chris: But this is all about the future.",
        "Alison: I know that you want us to have fun and be spontaneous, but we're living with my mom. My naked Mom.",
        "Chris: Alison, that was one time, okay? And I'm a doctor.",
        "Alison: If you're gonna say that -- that you see naked women all the time, it's not gonna make me feel better.",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, all I saw was this.",
        "Alison: Stop it!",
        "Chris: Look, trust me. I'm not thinking about your mother. I'm thinking about you, and me, and -- you know.",
        "Alison: And so am I. And that's why there's no way that I'm gonna spend my time playing \"find the magic key,\" or whatever it is with you.",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah? Even if I do this?",
        "Alison: Stop it. You look like Scooby-doo with fleas.",

        "Susan: Emily and I are partners.",
        "Emily: And I hate to break it to you, but we're gonna win. Not that I would, you know, discourage a little competitiveness between friends. You know, the more, the merrier.",
        "Alison: Are you serious? You and Mom are gonna do this thing, too?",
        "Susan: Absolutely. I have the day off, so I figured, why not. It'll be fun. Besides, we knew we'd see you two there.",
        "Chris: Nope. Alison won't be my partner.",
        "Emily and Susan: What?",
        "Chris: Yeah. She doesn't want to do it.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Alison: I can't believe you guys. You guys are, like, the busiest people I have ever met. And you're gonna waste your time, your 2 1/2 seconds of free time, on some stupid game? You guys are supposed to be role models. You're supposed to be buying vitamins and balancing checkbooks, not playing some stupid game. I mean, seriously, what's the point?",

        "Emily: Jacuzzi.",
        "Alison: It says we have to meet down at the Lakeview in half an hour. What are we standing around for? Come on, let's go. Let's go.",

        "Casey: But you just said you could pitch in.",
        "Margo: I know. I know. And I would. I would, any other time. But I -- have so many errands to do and they're all on the other side of town --",
        "Casey: But Grandma needs these documents right away. And -- look, if we drop them off, we're gonna be --",
        "Tom: Actually, the papers are my responsibility.",

        "Tom: I'll tell her to call me as soon as she's read them.",
        "Casey: Why can't Mom?",
        "Tom: Because she can't. All right? Do me a favor. Just run upstairs and get your wallet, they're gonna need to see some I.D. When we register.",
        "Margo: You know what? I'll drop off the papers.",
        "Casey: Thank you.",
        "Tom: I thought you were --",
        "Margo: It's all right. It's not a problem. I'll just do my errands some other time. It's not a problem.",
        "Tom: Great. All right, case. Go get your wallet. So why don't you want to go over to WOAK? Did you and Kim have a falling out?",
        "Margo: No. No. We're fine.",
        "Tom: Well, something's got you pretty upset. What's going on?",
        "Margo: You know what? I really didn't sleep too well last night.",

        "Tom: Just a minute. Just a minute. Hey. You promise me everything's okay?",
        "Margo: Everything is fine. There is absolutely no reason why I can't go to WOAK and drop off those papers and save you guys a trip. So go and win, okay? I have to get changed.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Casey: Come on, Dad. There's probably already a line at the Lakeview.",
        "Tom: All right. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Let's forget about Mike. Forget about Simon. Let's just think about me for a second, okay? Your roommate, your best friend, the guy who went to the looney bin and back for you --",
        "Katie: I know. I'm sorry. I just -- I can't --",
        "Henry: I need you, cupcake. I need you. I need you like G.W. needs Florida, okay? I need you like Houdini needs his thumbs. Okay, without you I'm nothing. I am bupkus. You're the only partner I have ever wanted. You're the only partner I'll ever need. Now promise me, okay, you'll be my one and only -- Myra! Sweet lips. Hey, Henry Coleman. Tell me you're looking for me like I'm looking for you. Tell me that you'll be my partner in \"the six keys to the kingdom\" --",
        "Myra: Back off, martini boy! One more word and I'll call the cops.",
        "Henry: Let me make it up to you, Myra, baby, please. That is one petty woman. So she lost a lousy six grand, you know? What? Did I tell her to draw an inside straight? Well, maybe I did. But you know what? Buyer beware, that's my motto. All's fair in love and war. And love is love, but poker, poker is -- what's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Henry: Are you having second thoughts about partnering with me? Kasnoff.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I can't help it. You're right, I do still love him. But he sold me out, and I can't -- how can I -- I can't. I'm with Simon now. And I belong with him. And no matter how long it takes, I'll get over mike and I'll be happy. I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: I'm not going anywhere till you pay me what you owe me. I'm the one that broke up mike and Katie. Just like you asked.",
        "Simon: Don't push it, Pilar.",
        "Pilar: And a bonus. Don't be so cranky. You've got to admit, it's been a little touch and go with you these past few weeks.",
        "Simon: I didn't like your methods.",
        "Pilar: Oh, well, then you should have shown up when you said you would, instead of leaving me hanging all those weeks. Besides, what're you complaining about? Katie's free. Mike's out of the picture. You got what you wanted.",
        "Simon: So did you.",
        "Pilar: You were very generous. I like that in a man.",
        "Simon: We're done.",
        "Pilar: Oh, too bad. We were so good together.",

        "Russ: Oh, St. Croix, here I come.",
        "Pilar: Enjoy yourself. You earned it.",
        "Russ: Yeah. Well, what about you? If you're going back to Spain, you should do a little stopover on the Riviera first. It's high season, but hey, you can afford it, right?",
        "Pilar: Yeah. I suppose I can.",
        "Russ: Yeah, well, don't just stand there, get yourself a plane ticket. You must be dying to get out of this pit.",
        "Pilar: Michael?",
        "Mike: Take your things and get out.",
        "Pilar: I'm sorry. I can't do that.",

        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Margo: Tom wanted me to drop off these documents to you.",
        "Kim: Oh, thanks very much. Where are they? Team Hughes? Are they registering?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. They are the team. Listen, Tom said to give him a call after you have a chance to read through everything.",
        "Kim: Good enough. Good enough. You tell Casey that I've got a book he might want to have. I think it'll really help him with the clues to this contest. In fact, it could be here at the studio. We used it for the Founder's Day special we did. Anyway, I'll see if I can find it.",
        "Margo: Okay. I'll have him give you a call. Listen, I gotta go.",

        "Henry: Me? Bother Casey? Come on.",
        "Tom: Because you know what, I'll bet his Mom would have something to say about that.",
        "Casey: My Mom, the detective?",

        "Henry: That time you needed Cubs tickets --",
        "Curtis: And you took my money and spent it at the track?",
        "Henry: I invested the money. I would have tripled our money. Come on, we could have had box seats.",
        "Curtis: Our money?",
        "Henry: How was I supposed to know the horse was lame?",
        "Aaron: Back off, Henry. He's my partner.",
        "Henry: Wow. You know what? You two guys are short-sighted. This is a contest. You need me. Wait, wait -- time out. I've got an idea. I'll be the silent partner. We'll split the winnings three ways.",
        "Aaron: I got an idea. How about you be the invisible partner and just split?",
        "Curtis: That was good.",
        "Aaron: You liked that, man? That's for you.",

        "Casey: So how do we win?",
        "Charlie: Ah, the young man asks an important question. How do you win the contest? Well, it's easy. \"The City Times\" will be publishing clues -- sometimes in the morning edition, sometimes in the afternoon. You'll never know.",
        "Emily: That's a good way to move circulation.",
        "Charlie: These clues will lead you to keys hidden around Oakdale.",
        "Chris: How many keys are hidden?",
        "Charlie: Dozens. But it only takes six to win. The first team to collect six keys wins $300,000. [Crowd cheers] You guys ready to hear the first clue?",
        "All: Yeah.",
        "Charlie: All right. Well, just so you know, the clues will come in all shapes and sizes. This first one is a poem. Listen up -- \"Oakdale's founding timber fell with a great moan.

        "Mike: Because you were careful. And I was been blind. The more I think about it, you were working against me and Katie from the very beginning. You set her up to look crazy. And then when she finally gets committed, you showed up at the hospital --",
