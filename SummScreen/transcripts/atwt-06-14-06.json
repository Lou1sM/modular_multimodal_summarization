        "Damian introduces Lily to Ross, who runs a program for teens. Damian and Ross sell it as a positive program that gives guidance and nurturing to teens. Lily becomes sold on this if Luke agrees. When Lily goes to call Luke to come home, Damian clearly reminds Ross that Luke's enrollment in this program is not voluntary and he expects him to show Luke the error of his ways. Luke comes out to Lucy after she sees him with Kevin. Jen and Dusty struggle to cope with what is happening to Johnny. Emily learns of Johnny's illness and the possibility of stem cells being harvested from her unborn child, and decides she will offer this to Jen and Dusty. Susan is against this, but Emily thinks this will save her. Jen and Dusty want to know the catch, but Emily assures them it is just simply she wanting to make up for what she took from them. Jen can't turn Emily's offer down, and Emily directs her mother to get the ball rolling. Will is packed and ready to leave Gwen thinking that is what she wants. Gwen reaches out for Will, but he is racked with guilt and wanting to tell Gwen about his one night stand with Jade. She keeps interrupting him, explaining she wants to forget about each of their mistakes, move forward and start over. Will decides he can't tell her. Will goes looking for Jade and tells her that he and Gwen got back together. He asks Jade to keep their one night affair a secret. She agrees and tells him the librarian was suggesting she may have been involved in helping Will cheat, can he keep their secret too? They both agree to keep each other's secret. Jade appears sad about his and Gwen's reconciliation even though she attempts to hide it. Carly greets Jack in her wedding dress. Jack sadly explains while he thought he could forget the past, he can't and if he has any hope of keeping his self-respect, he can't stay married to her. Carly gives up and tells him angrily that she is done begging for his forgiveness and trying to win him back. She tells him to leave, and this time when he comes looking for her, she won't be waiting. It isn't a threat it is the truth this time. Through a tear streaked face Carly tells a devastated Jack to leave and after he does, she locks the door behind him."

        "Ross: I've heard wonderful things about you, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's interesting, because Damian's told me absolutely nothing about you. Mr. --",
        "Damian: Are you sure we won't be disturbed?",
        "Lily: Holden is in Springfield. I told you, I am not going to stand --",
        "Damian: What about Luke?",
        "Lily: Luke is at the club. Would you mind telling me what we're having this meeting about?",
        "Ross: Ross Kreeger.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Damian: Ross is chairman of the board of the Kreeger family foundation. I told him about Luke's problem, he thinks he can help.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Ross: Well, from what I've heard, sounds like your son could use a realignment in the area of gender confusion. That's one of the --",
        "Lily: Oh, oh, oh wait. No, no, no. I don't like the sound of this at all ,no. Are you a deprogrammer?",
        "Ross: No, that is exactly what I am not.",
        "Damian: Lily, do you think I'd do something like that to Luke?",
        "Lily: I have no idea what you would do. And I don't know what any of this is about!",
        "Damian: I'm sorry I couldn't give you any background yesterday. I just wanted Ross to tell you himself about his amazing program. Lily, I really think he can help us. So please hear him out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey Kevin. What's up?",
        "Kevin: Hey-hey! Everything is everything, my man. How about you?",
        "Luke: Status is quo.",
        "Kevin: So you're here for the lifeguard training?",
        "Luke: No, I mean -- do you work here?",
        "Kevin: Looks that way. So you -- you still on 24/7 lockdown, or what?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no. My dad cooled off about all that.",
        "Kevin: Oh, good, good. So I won't have to dive into the deep end next time I see you?",
        "Luke: No. So -- if you want to hang out sometime --",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Definitely. We should catch up, talk, you know?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: All right. I've got to go. They're want me. See you later.",
        "Lucy: I was hoping you'd still be here.",
        "Luke: Hey, I thought that you were going to go home and crash.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I decided I need food and cousin time more than sleep. Friend of yours?",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Lucy: Oh, I just thought, you know, he could eat with us, if you want.",
        "Luke: Oh, no. The thing about --",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Luke: I used to be in love with the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: He's so perfect. But so still. I know when he sleeps, he usually looks like --",
        "Dusty: He always looks like he's going to demand one of his pony rides, or those vanilla cookies he likes.",
        "Jennifer: And he's gonna be like that again. Dr. Lake's gonna find a treatment for this --",
        "Dusty: Cancer. It's cancer, say it. It's in our boy.",
        "Jennifer: Right, we're gonna beat the cancer. And then, Johnny's gonna get well, and he's gonna play. And he's gonna grow, and he's gonna laugh.",
        "Barbara: You have no idea how many people I had to intimidate to get into this room.",
        "Jennifer: Sorry, Mom, they want to keep it pretty sterile around.",
        "Barbara: I know, I know. How are you two doing?",
        "Dusty: Good. Thanks for coming.",
        "Jennifer: Honey -- honey, he's burning up.",
        "Dusty: Call the doctor!",
        "Barbara: I'll find someone.",
        "Dusty: Get a doctor in here now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: If Jennifer's baby had the stem cell treatment, he could be cured?",
        "Susan: It's possible.",
        "Emily: Then why don't they try it?",
        "Susan: Because the use of stem cells is still very experimental. Most hospitals don't have access. You just can't go to the pharmacy and pick up a few. They have to be harvested from an unborn fetus.",
        "Emily: Any unborn fetus?",
        "Susan: It has to be a close match, a relative.",
        "Emily: A relative. My baby and Johnny, they're cousins, right?",
        "Susan: Oh, no, Emily! No! Absolutely not!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I meant what I said. I would forgive you for anything.",
        "Will: But last night, I messed up so bad.",
        "Gwen: So did I. I was angry. I yelled at you. Embarrassed you.",
        "Will: Yeah, and I deserved all of it. Instead of coming to you, instead of believing in what we had, I broke every vow we ever made. How could you forgive me for that? Why would you want to?",
        "Gwen: Because I love you, Will. There is no guy in this world who is better for me than you.",
        "Will: That's -- that's not true. I've got to tell you something.",
        "Gwen: No, me first. Don't think -- don't think I'm a dork. Just listen, okay?",
        "Will: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: Look, tell me that you'll listen.",
        "Will: I'm -- I'm listening.",
        "Gwen: Star light, star bright, the first star that I see tonight --",
        "Will: What are you doing?",
        "Gwen: I'm starting over. Let's do that, Will. Let's start over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I wish you hadn't done this.",
        "Carly: I ruined the surprise. I know I did, I'm sorry. It's just that I'm just so happy, Jack. And I'm gonna remember this day, and I'm gonna remember this moment just like I remember our wedding.",
        "Jack: Carly, you look so -- you're so beautiful. And I'm sorry that I have to --",
        "Carly: Wait! Wait, we gotta -- we gotta do it right.",
        "Jack: Oh, Carly, stop, okay? Listen to me.",
        "Carly: All right, just -- just let me say one more thing. And then, it'll be your turn, okay? Just one more thing. You gave this ring back to me. But I didn't want to wear it then. I didn't want to put it back on, until I really knew it really belonged on my finger. If you put this on, I will never take it off again. Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have said something right away. But I was so surprised when I saw you in the dress. Carly, we can't do this.",
        "Carly: Well, you're going to have to be more specific. What is it, exactly, that we can't do? We can't live together again? Well, it can't be that. I mean, your toothbrush is next to mine in the holder. And your shaving kit is above the sink.",
        "Jack: And it doesn't mean what you want it to mean.",
        "Carly: Those are your keys on the desk. And that's your coffee cup in the kitchen sink.",
        "Jack: Carly, please.",
        "Carly: So what is it that we can't do? We can't make love? Of course we can, Jack. I'm better now, and we can do it. We can get on with our lives. We can.",
        "Jack: No, we can't. You know we can't. I'm sorry if I led you to believe otherwise, but this is as far as it goes. Nothing's changed between us.",
        "Carly: You're wrong, Jack. Everything's changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Why can't we just start over, Will?",
        "Will: I need to tell you what happened.",
        "Gwen: I was there, remember?",
        "Will: I need to tell you what happened after our fight. I was drunk -- really drunk. And when you told me that our marriage was done, or over -- you know, that part got through.",
        "Gwen: I didn't say that. I meant that I was done talking about it.",
        "Will: Well, that's not how it sounded.",
        "Gwen: I didn't say that our marriage was over. I wouldn't say that. We're forever, right?",
        "Will: Oh, God.",
        "Gwen: What? What is it?",
        "Will: I -- I didn't leave. I came back to the club, looking for you.",
        "Gwen: I didn't see you.",
        "Will: Well, I saw you. And you were with Casey. And he had his arms around you.",
        "Gwen: And I was crying -- about you! Casey and Maddie were there. Remember Maddie, our friend? Casey's girlfriend? She went to go get me a glass of water in case -- I can't believe that you would read something into that.",
        "Will: Well, why wouldn't I? Casey graduated yesterday, without cheating. And he was there for you, when you needed him. And where was I? You know, all I could think was how you got gypped. And how you married the wrong guy.",
        "Gwen: You're right. We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: What's his name?",
        "Luke: Kevin.",
        "Lucy: He's so cute.",
        "Luke: That's it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well what's the \"used to be\" part about? Are you still in love with him or not?",
        "Luke: Wait a minute. So you're okay with me being gay?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, why wouldn't I be? So tell me about the breakup. Was it over- coffee friendly or breaking-furniture messy?",
        "Luke: Well, there was no breakup, because there was no relationship. I never told him how I felt.",
        "Lucy: Why not?",
        "Luke: Because, Lucy, I don't think that everyone's going to be as cool as you are about me being gay.",
        "Lucy: Well, personally, I think it's great. Terrific benefits. For me, at least.",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Lucy: You can use your highly attuned \"gaydar\" to clue me in to guys who are on the D.L., so I don't waste my time.",
        "Luke: Well, I think my gaydar's broken.",
        "Lucy: Well, have any decorating tips?",
        "Luke: I like beige.",
        "Lucy: Hair? Makeup? Clothes?",
        "Luke: Hair -- hair's nice, I like hair. I don't wear makeup. And clothes? I don't know, I just -- I like stripes.",
        "Lucy: Okay. I guess I'll just have to love you because you're you, then.",
        "Luke: Thanks, Luce.",
        "Lucy: As long as you're cool with it, it's all good. Are you cool with it?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I love Luke as much as you do. I would never push him into something he doesn't want.",
        "Lily: What about you, Mr. Kreeger? What are you pushing?",
        "Ross: Well, the Kreeger program has nothing to do with forcibly changing anybody.",
        "Damian: They help teenagers like Luke, who might be confused.",
        "Lily: How do you do that?",
        "Ross: Well, by helping them confront who they are, and giving them tools to deal with their issues.",
        "Lily: What's the process?",
        "Ross: Well, basically, we offer teens a great summer -- sports, swimming, boating. We have a few seminars and group sessions where the kids can talk to each other about what's going on in their minds.",
        "Lily: You make it sound like one of those leadership programs.",
        "Damian: That's exactly what it's like.",
        "Lily: All right, you know, let's just stop -- right now. We know -- we know why we're talking.",
        "Ross: Well, I -- I understand that Luke has questions about his sexuality.",
        "Lily: No, no, he has no questions. He is absolutely confident. I, on the other hand, have some questions. And I'm concerned about him.",
        "Ross: You don't think Luke is gay?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know. It's just this revelation of his, this announcement, that just came out of nowhere. I mean, how does that happen? How does it just kind of --?",
        "Ross: Well, Luke is still very young.",
        "Damian: He's only 16.",
        "Ross: And sometimes with kids that age, if there's been any kind of family crisis -- which there has been with Luke, right? Well, they react. They make life-altering choices. Some run away, some drink, and some decide they're gay.",
        "Lily: Please don't put being gay and drinking in the same category. I mean, if this -- if this is who Luke is --",
        "Ross: Then we'll help him acknowledge and cope with that. Let me ask you this, Lily. Has Luke been involved in a gay relationship?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Ross: Has he come out to his friends at school? His peers?",
        "Lily: I'm not sure.",
        "Ross: Does he have friends who are openly gay?",
        "Lily: Not that I know of.",
        "Ross: Well, why not? I mean, if this is who Luke is, and what he wants from his life, why isn't he acting on it?",
        "Damian: Do you think this means he's having doubt? Although he says not?",
        "Ross: Well, you know, I think you owe it to your son to help him find out what's true and what isn't.",
        "Lily: And what if being gay is who Luke really is? If that's what's right for him --",
        "Ross: Then we'll -- we'll help him. We'll help him accept that, face it, deal with it. But, you know, if he's just confused, we can help him with that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I could kill Paul! I could kill Emily! I could kill Meg!",
        "Dusty: Jenny, Jenny --",
        "Jennifer: No, I didn't have enough time with my son! I should have been there from the beginning! I would have seen it! I would have -- I would have been able to notice the signs of this! And I would have been able to do something!",
        "Dusty: No, there was nothing to see. There was nothing to see! With all these checkups? I mean, come on. The doctors didn't even see it?",
        "Jennifer: What are we --? What are we going to do?",
        "Barbara: Honey, honey -- listen to me. We're going to do whatever it takes, all right? We're going to meet with the specialist the doctor's lined up. We're going to find out what kind of treatments are available. But what we're not going to do, is just sit by and let this baby die. Okay?",
        "Jennifer: And what if it takes a miracle?",
        "Barbara: I've witnessed a few. And I think we can beg, borrow or steal one more for Johnny. Okay, honey?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Emily, what you're thinking is absurd!",
        "Emily: Yeah, but there's a test, right?",
        "Susan: Yes -- a dangerous, intrusive test. But what would be the point, if we can't even go through with the treatment?",
        "Emily: But if the babies are a match, what's the problem?",
        "Susan: Honey, these tests are barely in the study phase. We haven't even done a procedure like this in the United States. There are questions of legality. We don't even know if this hospital could be approved, or even included in the existing clinical trial study.",
        "Emily: I'm sure Bob Hughes could get it approved, Mother. I mean, this child is a member of his family. He would move heaven and earth for the baby.",
        "Susan: We have done clinical trials here in this hospital. There's no guarantee that they work.",
        "Emily: If Jennifer's baby doesn't get this treatment, will he die? Well then, we have to try!",
        "Susan: If your pregnancy is compromised by this test, or those treatments, it could destroy you.",
        "Emily: Or, it could save me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Why won't they let us back in yet?",
        "Barbara: I'm sure it won't be much longer, honey. In the meantime, I want you to tell me everything the doctor has told you about this.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing?",
        "Barbara: I'm going to make some calls, I'm just gonna pull some strings -- whatever we have to do to find out more about this blood disorder.",
        "Dusty: I think Dr. Lake's office could use some Barbara Ryan influence right about now.",
        "Barbara: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll do that.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you, for giving her something to do. Even it's just busy work. It'll keep her from panicking around here.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: It's your phone.",
        "Jennifer: Hello?",
        "Emily: Jennifer, its Emily.",
        "Jennifer: What do you want?",
        "Emily: Can you come and see me?",
        "Jennifer: Emily, what the hell is wrong with you? My baby is sick, and I am here at the hospital! I don't have time for your games.",
        "Dusty: If you ever call this number again, I'm going come over to that psych ward and strangle you with your own straitjacket. You understand?",
        "Emily: Dusty, don't hang up the phone, please. It's about -- it's about your baby. It's about Johnny. I think I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So I guess Holden and Lily were pretty stunned.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Well, my dad was good with it. And he still is. But my mom -- not so much.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I kind of picked up on that.",
        "Luke: What do you mean? Did she say something?",
        "Lucy: No, well, we were having dinner, and I mentioned that I had seen you earlier, and she got kind of quiet.",
        "Luke: Yeah. She thinks that this is like, something I can get over, like the chicken pox. And then, to make things more complicated, my birth father just came back into town.",
        "Lucy: Damian? That must've been a shock.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Well, actually, he's kind of lightened my mom up about all of this. So, in a way, I think it's kind of good that he's back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: It doesn't look at all like a camp.",
        "Lily: No, it looks like a resort.",
        "Ross: Well, the pictures don't do it justice. Lily, our program isn't geared to change anyone.",
        "Lily: Okay, I like that. That's good. And as much as I am anxious about Luke, I don't want him to feel coerced in any way, physically or emotionally.",
        "Damian: And he won't be. What harm would it do to have him try the program? He'll get a fun summer out of it anyway.",
        "Ross: Now, I don't want to pressure you. But if you are interested, you should be aware that the summer session has already begun.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Ross: But there is room to accept one more student if you decide immediately.",
        "Lily: I -- you know, I have to talk to Holden first.",
        "Damian: But if Luke agrees --",
        "Lily: Do you really think that he will?",
        "Ross: Don't worry. Just give me a little time with him. I guarantee you, he'll want to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Casey and I are friends. We work together. And that's it.",
        "Will: I -- I know that.",
        "Gwen: No, obviously not, if you think that Casey and I could ever do anything --",
        "Will: You guys do have history.",
        "Gwen: We had one night. And having sex isn't the same as making love. I've only made love to you, the same way that you've only made love to me.",
        "Will: Gwen, don't, just --",
        "Gwen: I was never in love with Casey. I never married him. I never cried over him!",
        "Will: I never wanted to make you cry. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Gwen: That's what you are for me.",
        "Will: Not anymore.",
        "Gwen: Why? Because you didn't graduate? You cheated on some stupid test? You got drunk?",
        "Will: I did so much worse than that! The worst thing that I could ever do, and -- I let you down. And you don't even know.",
        "Gwen: Look, when I was crying last night, all I wanted was you. And this morning, when I woke up alone, all I wanted was you. And now I'm standing here, and I'm looking at your packed bags, and I keep waiting for you to tell me that you're not going to leave me. But you won't say it. And I don't know how to make you stay, Will. I'm sorry!",
        "Will: Look, don't say that. Stop -- you've nothing to be sorry for.",
        "Gwen: Please, don't leave me. Okay? Please!",
        "Will: Okay, just hear me out.",
        "Gwen: No, I don't want to!",
        "Will: After you've heard it all, if you still want to stay with me, then I'll never leave you, Gwen. Never.",

        "Ms. Stacell: Jade?",
        "Jade: Oh, I've almost gotten those files reordered for you.",
        "Ms. Stacell: Thank you. Listen, I just got a call from Mr. Weber, the principal of Oakdale Latin.",
        "Jade: Oh? About setting up a summer school reading list?",
        "Ms. Stacell: He wanted to talk to me about this past semester. Apparently, one of the students there was caught cheating.",
        "Jade: Oh, really? Well, what does that have to do with the library?",
        "Ms. Stacell: Mr. Weber suspects that the student was aided and abetted by someone who works here. Would you know anything about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You can't tell me that nothing's changed since you found this ring. It helped you find me. And you kept me safe, and warm and sane until help came.",
        "Jack: I was doing my job.",
        "Carly: Your job? So every woman that you find that's near death, you -- you move into her house, you sleep in her bed?",

        "Carly: Why was it so easy for you to come to me, and be with me, when you thought that I needed you? And why is it so hard for you to stay with me now?",
