        "Lily: Is this everything? Craig?",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Lily: Craig?",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "Lily: This is it?",
        "Craig: Lucy gave me this when we opened the club.",
        "Lily: Oh, two heads?",
        "Craig: Yeah, to hedge my bets. Always thinking, that girl, huh?",
        "Lily: Yeah. We'll get her back. We will.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Is everything here?",
        "Craig: Maybe I should stay here in case there's a call.",
        "Lily: What? You can get a call at my house. And have a decent place to stay. Let's go.",
        "Craig: Yeah -- no. It's an imposition. And Holden --",
        "Lily: Holden is fine. I'm not letting you bunk in that back room. Lucy would have my head.",
        "Craig: How am I going to get her back?",
        "Lily: We will. Trust me.",
        "Craig: Shiver me timbers -- its yacht-guy. A-hoy. A-hoy. Where's your meal ticket -- I mean, my ex?",
        "Alan: My wife is back home scared to death about what's happening to her daughter. Any word from the kidnappers?",
        "Lily: No, not yet. I'm amazed you managed to keep Sierra away.",
        "Alan: Well, it wasn't easy, but given her political position, it was the only decision to make.",
        "Craig: Was there some kind of secret strategy about Lucy's kidnapping going on here?",
        "Lily: No, just a phone call with Sierra, who was desperate to be here. But Montega is in some high-level negotiations right now. So she can't be here.",
        "Alan: Her diplomatic advisors have begged her to maintain a low profile and keep this out of the press.",
        "Lily: My mother and I thought it would be best. No media circus gives us a better chance to find Lucy sooner than later.",
        "Craig: All right, when was this phone call?",
        "Lily: Last night.",
        "Craig: And why didn't you include me?",
        "Alan: Who wants your advice about any of this? This is your fault.",
        "Craig: Who are you?",
        "Lily: Okay, calm down. Craig, calm down.",
        "Craig: My daughter's been kidnapped.",
        "Alan: Because it is your fault. Lucy was kidnapped by your partner.",
        "Lily: Alan, this is not helping.",
        "Alan: Listen, Dusty Donovan knew how much money Sierra had, how much money your other ex had. And you had Lucy in here every chance you got, giving the guy a perfect opportunity. I mean, he took her, but Lucy's gone because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah, you're still in this dump with me.",
        "Lucy: You untied my feet.",
        "Dusty: Yes, I did. I figure I could outrun you.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, with one hand tied behind your back. Interesting, considering I'm the one whose hands are tied.",
        "Dusty: This would be so much easier if you would just cooperate.",
        "Lucy: Cooperate? You want me to cooperate after you kidnapped me?",
        "Dusty: I'm the one who saved you. That limo driver was the same guy who attacked you at my club. Let's get that straight. You'd be nowhere if I didn't pull you out of that car.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'd probably be on a beach in Montega, instead of stuck here with you.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, or you might be dead!",
        "Lucy: Just let me go. Okay, even if -- even if there was danger before, it's over now. You can't keep me here forever!",
        "Dusty: That's a good point.",
        "Lucy: Good. So when are we leaving?",
        "Dusty: We're not leaving. I am.",

        "Charlie: Congratulations to Tom and Casey Hughes -- [Crowd cheers] -- On solving the first clue in our \"six keys to the kingdom\" contest!",
        "Tom: Thank you very much.",
        "Casey: So what do we win?",
        "Tom: I don't think anything yet.",
        "Charlie: Absolutely right, Mr. Hughes. You haven't won a thing. But you are in the lead. All you need to do is solve five more in our series of clues and if you collect six keys before anyone else, you'll win $300,000!",
        "Aaron: Wait, wait. But the rest of us still have a shot, right?",
        "Charlie: Of course you do. Anybody can win that $300,000. We got a lot of keys planted out there, and if you're the first team to collect six of them, the jackpot is yours.",
        "Susan: When do we get the next clue?",
        "Charlie: Well, we'll be posting a schedule in a couple of hours. If you'd like to go and come back later --",
        "[Crowd objects]",
        "Charlie: That's the spirit! Six keys, 300,000 big ones. It can all be yours.",
        "[Crowd cheers]",
        "Casey: This is so great. I just wish Mom were here.",
        "Tom: Yeah.",
        "Casey: I'm going to call her.",
        "Tom: You know what? Hold off on that. You know, she already told us she has a tight schedule today. I'm sure she's thinking about us, wondering how we're doing.",

        "Alison: Margo!",
        "Margo: Alison.",
        "Doc: Don't I know you? Aren't you that wonderful, wonderful waitress from the Metro?",
        "Alison: How could you do this?",
        "Doc: You two know each other?",
        "Margo: Um, Alison is my brother-in-law's girlfriend.",
        "Alison: And you work for Chris's Mom.",
        "Margo: Kim. Kim.",
        "Doc: Kim? Oh. Oh! Hey, l'il bit, tell you what -- we can explain what happened here.",
        "Margo: You know what happened, I stumbled. There was a branch and --",
        "Alison: Don't even try to play innocent with me. I know what you two were doing. And I think it totally bites.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Its okay, baby. There's nobody here. Just stay put.",
        "Katie: But I can hear voices.",
        "Simon: Get out of here right now. I don't want Katie to see you.",
        "Pilar: Or what? She'll realize that you were the one who sent me here to break up her and Mike? Yeah, maybe I should just explain everything. Save her the trouble of having to piece it together for herself.",
        "Simon: All right, send a postcard. Get out.",
        "Katie: Simon, did you say something?",
        "Simon: I said -- I said I'll be right up.",
        "Katie: Oh, forget it. I'm just coming down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Ali, look, I know that you're really upset about what you saw --",
        "Alison: Sure I'm upset! Don't you care about Chris? You know how much we need this $300,000. And I get why Casey would want to be in this contest. He's a kid. But you already have a house. And why is it that people who already have money always want more?",
        "Doc: Okay, are you understanding this?",
        "Alison: And you! I mean, you're a sportscaster making a gazillion dollars. It should be illegal for you to win something like this.",
        "Doc: Are you talking about, like, a conflict of interest?",
        "Alison: Whatever. But if you work with me for a little bit, you know, I won't turn you in. Can we help each other out?",
        "Margo: Ali, what are you talking about?",
        "Alison: You haven't found the keys yet, have you?",
        "Margo: The key! The key -- no, no. Bad luck -- no, no luck.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, it's got to be around here somewhere. And it's good that it's the three of us because that way we can find it before anyone else shows up. So where is that stupid memorial plaque? [Cell phone rings] I'm busy.",
        "Susan: Alison, where are you?",
        "Alison: I can't tell you that, Mom. It's a competition. Hello?",
        "Susan: You're not still searching for that key?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I am and I'm totally close. But, um, Mom, I have got enough partners. You and Emily are going to have to figure this out for yourselves.",
        "Susan: Alison, the first key has already been found.",
        "Alison: Huh?",
        "Susan: It was on top of the WOAK building. Everybody's here at the Lakeview lounge, congratulating Tom and Casey.",
        "Alison: I'll be right over there. We blew it. They found the key.",
        "Margo: Oh, darn. It's too bad.",
        "Doc: Oh, that's too bad. Wish I could have helped.",
        "Alison: Thank you, anyway.",
        "Doc: Damn, that was close.",
        "Margo: I was so sure that she'd seen us.",
        "Doc: But she didn't.",
        "Margo: Maybe -- I just imagine her running off and telling Chris. And then Chris is going to tell Tom, and --",
        "Doc: And Tom tells Kim. [Doc sighs] I guess this is the part where you tell me this has got to stop and we can't see each other any more.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I should say that. And more than anything, I want to say that. But I won't.",
        "Doc: What's different this time?",
        "Margo: Because I'm not going to mean it, Doc. I think I've finally realized that what's going on between us. The reason it won't stop happening is I don't want it to stop.",

        "[Mike dreaming]",
        "Katie: I love you, too, Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Mike! Hey, Mike, hey!",
        "Mike: So, what? I'm sorry, man. What'd you say?",
        "Henry: Hey, I said, how you doing? You looked like you were kind of out of it there.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I guess I was. Um, it's good to see you, man",
        "Henry: You're happy to see me?",
        "Mike: Sure. What do you need?",
        "Henry: A favor.",
        "Mike: Name it.",
        "Henry: Just like that?",
        "Mike: Well, usually when you show up --",
        "Henry: Oh. Oh, right. I got it. I'm usually here because Katie sent me.",
        "Mike: She didn't, huh?",
        "Henry: But, hey, you know -- will you still do me that favor?",
        "Mike: Depends.",
        "Henry: There's conditions now? Okay, that's fine. Conditions are fine. So, have you heard about this six keys to the kingdom game?",
        "Mike: Yeah. You want a beer?",
        "Henry: Beer -- sure. Yeah. Love beer. Love it. Anyway, this game, the grand prize is $300,000. Pretty impressive, huh? Well, I'm impressed. Be careful there. Anyway, the only deal with the game is that you have to have a partner to play.",
        "Mike: I'm not going to partner with you.",
        "Henry: Why does everyone keep saying that?",
        "Mike: Probably because nobody trusts you.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, that could be it. But, Mike, I'm not going to play dirty. I mean, not with someone like you. I mean, look at you all, you know, rippling muscles there. You could beat the -- [Henry whistles] -- Out of me. So --",
        "Mike: That's not going to happen because I'm not doing this.",
        "Henry: You're discouraged by our late start. Don't be. I'm sure that we can come from behind and sweep to a very lucrative victory. No?",
        "Mike: Uh-huh.",
        "Henry: Want your beer back?",
        "Mike: What do you hear from Katie?",
        "Henry: Happy as a lark. Or, I guess, as a lovebird, I should say.",
        "Mike: So glad I asked. Look, man, I got stuff to do, so --",
        "Henry: Um -- speaking of Katie, do you want me to give her a message, tell here anything?",
        "Mike: Besides telling the thing about me wishing her husband had never come back to town?",
        "Henry: Some things are better left unsaid.",
        "Mike: Well, there is one thing you can tell her that will make her happy.",
        "Henry: What's that?",
        "Mike: Pilar's finally gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Pilar, if you don't get out of here --",
        "Pilar: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Simon: Listen, sweetheart, don't bother coming down. I'm almost done down here, okay?",
        "Katie: Are you sure?",
        "Simon: Yes, I'm sure. I'll be right up. Just make sure the water's nice and warm.",
        "Pilar: A bath in the middle of the day -- how cozy.",
        "Simon: What do you want?",
        "Pilar: You're happy. You're back with your wife. It's all hearts and flowers and bubble baths for two. And it's all thanks to me. If I hadn't gotten Mike away from Katie --",
        "Simon: Things would've turned out the same way. Now, I made a mistake getting in contact with you, but I paid you for it.",
        "Pilar: What if I want more?",
        "Simon: More cash? Forget it.",
        "Pilar: There are other things in life besides money, Simon! I might want to be happy, too, did you ever think of that?",
        "Simon: Just keep your mouth shut!",
        "Katie: Okay, what is going on? What's taking so long?",
        "Simon: You have no idea. It was the biggest wasp in here. It was at least this big. I wanted to get it out so you didn't get stung.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's sweet.",
        "Simon: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Really, Simon, who were you talking to?",
        "Simon: It was the radio.",
        "Katie: That's funny because I heard your voice and I thought I heard a woman's voice. I know your lying.",
        "Simon: All right, yeah. Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Okay, I know you're upset, Alan, but please just calm down.",
        "Alan: Look, its Sierra who's falling apart. I've never seen her like this.",
        "Craig: Well, lately it's clear to me that there are many, many, many things that you don't understand, particularly about Sierra. So why don't you go ship on back to Montega, do a little research.",
        "Alan: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Craig: This is my daughter.",
        "Alan: Explain something to me, Craig. Your own partner kidnaps Lucy and you don't have a clue about how to get her back.",
        "Craig: What I don't have is any inclination to tolerate you, big boy.",
        "Alan: Tough, because I'm staying.",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "Lily: Okay, then you have to stop blaming Craig for Lucy being kidnapped.",
        "Alan: All right, has this Donovan guy got Lucy or not?",
        "Lily: That doesn't make Craig responsible for her being gone! No one could have anticipated this. Yes, Craig is partners with Dusty, but so was I.",
        "Alan: Was. You had the sense to realize what a low-life the guy is and dealt with it. What took you so long to wake up?",
        "Lily: We both -- both of us knew that Dusty was involved with some shady people, but he's basically a good guy. We never could have -- I don't understand any of this.",
        "Craig: What we know is we have to find Lucy. And I will with people I trust. But, Popeye, I don't trust you. So if you're expecting an extra ration of Sierra's grog for swabbing the poop deck, forget it. You're irrelevant.",
        "[Lily moaning]",
        "Lily: I need a minute. Excuse me. Alan is here because Sierra cannot be. If you continue to play this turf war with this man, then he will leave and Sierra will be here. Is that what you want?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lily: You want her here? You want to watch her suffer, see her in pain, wondering if Lucy's going to come home?",
        "Craig: Dusty will never hurt Lucy.",
        "Lily: I know that. You know that. But Sierra does not have that luxury. So let her cope with this in her own way, and just -- would you lighten up on her new husband? Please?",
        "Craig: Lighten up? There's no way to lighten the deck shoes. Don't you think?",
        "Lily: You know, you are so superior, aren't you?",
        "Craig: Well --",
        "Lily: You should be able to handle him.",
        "Craig: Yeah, like you're handling me?",
        "Lily: Exactly. I'm going home.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Lily: Are you coming with me?",
        "Craig: No, I'm going to get in touch with Hal from here. And don't worry, I'll keep old barnacle bill tied up close alongside.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Craig: All right? What?",
        "Alan: What's next?",
        "Lily: The two of you are going to work together and you're going to contact me if anything new happens.",
        "Alan: You okay with that?",
        "Craig: Sailor, you are here only to make life easier for Sierra, and that is that.",
        "Lily: I'll be in touch. Be good.",
        "Alan: Sierra says you have a sister who's a detective. Is she working on this?",
        "Craig: Neither of my sisters know anything about this. They couldn't do anything and it would make things harder on them running around, worrying.",
        "Alan: All right. Maybe I overreacted before. I mean, what do I know about this Donovan guy? But I was thinking, now if you and Lily are reading this guy right, and he's not demented or obsessed, I mean, why did he kidnap your daughter in the first place?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Wait, you're just going to leave me here alone? That's your big plan? Why can't you just let me go?",
        "Dusty: Because I can't.",
        "Lucy: Because of the supposed bad guys.",
        "Dusty: Oh, they are bad. Believe it.",
        "Lucy: Yeah? How can you be so sure?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. I don't know a bunch of stuff. I don't know how many of them are out there. I don't know what they're after. I don't know why they chose, out of all the little rich girls in the world, you! I wish they hadn't, you know? Because if anything fit under the umbrella of \"no good deed goes unpunished,\" this is it. You don't know what I'm talking about.",
        "Lucy: Wait, and you want me to feel sorry for you now? I'm the one tied up, remember?",
        "Dusty: And I'm having a few minor problems, like, the cops are after me and the bad guys are after you! It takes a little bit of finessing! Okay, look, someday you'll thank me. I did the right thing.",
        "Lucy: You said you had a way to get me home.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I'm making a call. You see?",
        "Lucy: To whom?",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: To somebody -- somebody who can take you off my back and keep you safe. I'll be back.",
        "Lucy: Wait, why can't you just make it from here?",
        "Dusty: And let you scream out the location? I don't think so, wise guy.",
        "Lucy: No, I won't make any a sound. I swear. Just don't leave me alone again.",
        "Dusty: I'm just going outside. I'm not going far.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Dusty: It's me. Lucy's safe.",
        "Craig: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Look, let's make this quick. I just wanted to tell you your daughter's okay.",
        "Craig: I want to talk to her.",
        "Dusty: I can do better. I'll give her back to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Did I hear you right? Did you just say yes?",
        "Margo: You know, I keep telling you, Doc, and I keep telling myself that this thing that's going on between us -- that someday if will just die out. But it won't. And the more I try to push those feelings away, the stronger they get.",
        "Doc: I tried to tell you that.",
        "Margo: And I know that it's wrong. That I shouldn't do it. And that in and of itself should be reason enough for me to go.",
        "Doc: I feel the same way.",
        "Margo: You've had plenty of married women.",
        "Doc: But they weren't you. Okay? It's different this time.",
        "Margo: And you don't have to say that.",
        "Doc: I know I don't have to say anything. And I wish it weren't true because I like my job and I need to keep my job. And with Kim Hughes being your mother- in-law, the best thing I can do at this point is just to run away from you as far as I can. But I can't stay away from you.",
        "Margo: So --",
        "Doc: Oh, baby, please don't cry.",
        "Margo: When?",
        "Doc: I'll find a place, way out.",
        "Margo: I'd better go and make sure Alison doesn't say anything to anybody.",
        "Doc: Are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Doc: Hey, promise me you won't regret it.",
        "Margo: I promised my husband that I would always be faithful to him. I'm through making promises that I can't keep.",

        "Susan: Alison, where have you been? Did you go all the way to the zoo?",
        "Alison: No, I was at this courtyard where there's supposed to be this historical plaque or something.",
        "Susan: Why on earth would you go there?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Alison: Because I got some bad information.",
        "Susan: Well, what about Chris? Was he with you?",
        "Alison: He got a page from the hospital, and -- never mind, Mom.",
        "Casey: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi. Congratulations on your win.",
        "Casey: Thanks. Oh, it was so cool. I'm already planning on how I'm going to spend my $300,000.",
        "Tom: Oh, are you? I think maybe we should win the game before we start counting our winnings. I was pretty sure you and Chris were going to beat us.",
        "Alison: I wish we had.",
        "Casey: So where were you?",
        "Alison: The courtyard that leads to that little park near the old library.",

        "Simon: Okay, it was someone that -- [Simon sighs] All right, it was a party planner. I wanna throw a surprise party for you.",
        "Katie: A party?",
        "Simon: Yeah -- I know this sounds really dumb -- to celebrate us getting back together. You know?",
        "Katie: Oh, honey, you don't have to do that for me.",
        "Simon: Well, you didn't have to continue loving me after everything I've put you through, but you did.",
        "Katie: You make it sound like it's hard.",
        "Simon: It can't have been easy, I know that. And now that we're back together, I just want to show you how happy I am that you gave me a second chance -- because I really don't deserve it.",
        "Katie: Yes, you do. After all those horrible things that Pilar put me through, you were the one who believed me. You were the one who saved me. I mean, if I had relied on Mike -- you do deserve my love. And you are gonna have it forever.",

        "Dusty: Boy, I made a bad mistake calling you.",

        "Dusty: I'll tell you where she is, but not on the phone. We've got to meet in person.",
        "Craig: All right, where?",
        "Dusty: In the alley off Grand Street. Half an hour. If you call the cops or the cops are with you or the cops are watching, I'll know and the whole deal is off. You come alone, Montgomery.",

        "Alison: But Chris, this is our only chance.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but Alison, you know that I can't promise to always be available. All right? I'm a doctor. And I'm on call a lot of the time.",
        "Alison: Okay, so. So then what are we going to do?",
        "Chris: Forget the whole thing?",

        "Henry: Cold.",
        "Mike: Necessary.",

        "Mike: Henry --",
        "Henry: Right, right. You're right. You know, that's much better. She was no good. She was no doggone good. And Katie is a lot better with her far, far away.",

        "Dusty: Because the guys who kidnapped her might be watching. Craig, you've gotta be cool, man. You've gotta handle this thing right. When you get home, I suggest you hide Lucy somewhere safe, at least for a while. 'Cause these guys are going to keep coming at you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay. What was the holdup this time? I was in the bath so long I got prune fingers. Don't tell me you're still planning that party?",
        "Simon: No, no, no -- let's skip the party. That was a silly idea. And now that you've had a bath, why don't we both go upstairs and pack. And go on a little trip.",
        "Katie: Where?",
        "Simon: I don't know. Well, I do know, actually, because I just made the reservations. How about Australia?",
