        "Carly: All right, well, I think we've got all the albums.",
        "Hannah: My friend Joy got me into scrapbooking.",
        "Parker: What about these pictures?",
        "Carly: Oh, sweetheart, those are okay, because they're in the frames, but you see how these pictures are starting to crumble because they're in this old album? And we have to take all of the pictures out of this album, and put them in a new one. And we can make borders and write about the pictures and make a brand-new family scrapbook.",
        "Parker: Can J.J. be in it?",
        "Carly: Well, of course he'll be in it. He's part of the family, isn't he?",
        "Parker: So, what do we do first?",
        "Carly: First, we take out all these old pictures.",
        "Hannah: Yeah, but very carefully, because your mom's had some of these pictures since she was a little girl.",
        "Carly: Oh, Hannah, look. Sheep's Valley, Montana.",
        "Hannah: We used to go there for picnics.",
        "Parker: Who's that?",
        "Carly: That is my dad. My father, your grandfather.",
        "Parker: It's stuck.",
        "Carly: Oh, be careful. Hey, there's a picture under here.",
        "J.J.: Is that him, too?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, it is, but I've never seen this picture before.",
        "Parker: That's Mabel's.",
        "Carly: No. No, it isn't.",
        "Parker: Yeah, it is. Look, you can see part of the sign with the picture of the hot dog.",
        "Carly: No, I know that it looks like the same place, honey, but it isn't, because my dad was never in Oakdale.",

        "Gwen: So how much did you pay the guy at the front desk?",
        "Will: What do you mean?",
        "Gwen: \"Your party will be waiting for you by the pool, Ms. Norbeck.\" I don't know. This whole country club thing is going to take some getting used to.",
        "Will: So you're worried that you don't know the secret handshake and the passwords? It's okay, I'll tell you later.",
        "Gwen: Why do you even bother with me? You know, I thought -- I don't know. I thought you just took me to the prom because Celia made you.",
        "Will: You were the one who wanted me go to the prom.",
        "Gwen: That's true, but not because I liked you, sir.",
        "Will: Well, I don't like you, ma'am.",
        "Gwen: So, you're in love with Celia, and I'm pregnant with Casey's kid. What are we doing at a country club having breakfast?",
        "Will: Good waffles. What do you want?",
        "Gwen: Well, I haven't been sick yet today. The eggs benedict.",
        "Will: That's a good choice.",
        "Gwen: I think so. So what do you have to tell me?",
        "Will: I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone, and that I'm going to help you as much as I can.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Will: Because you're a friend.",
        "Gwen: What makes you think I need a friend?",
        "Will: What, you don't need a friend?",
        "Celia: Sorry. I don't believe it. You guys are my very first real customers. Casey got me this job, and I've been so nervous I'm gonna mess up.",
        "Will: Casey?",
        "Celia: He's over there. He's working the pool deck.",

        "Margo: No, no, you woke me up. Come on, tell me what it is. What's this?",
        "Katie: One of two things -- either separation papers or divorce papers from Henry. I tried to open it myself, and I couldn't do it.",
        "Margo: So you want me to open it for you? Katie.",
        "Katie: What does it say? Just tell me. I can handle it.",
        "Margo: First of all, I want you to know that there's no shame in this. A lot of people --",

        "Jennifer: Well, I do need to get into the door. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Did I say I'm going to China? You match the price. You're my guy. That a boy. You see how easy I am? I'll call you later. Travis is back in.",
        "Jennifer: Good. Who's the very large man blocking the doorway?",

        "Jennifer: Deacon, my bodyguard?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",

        "Dusty: You do if you want to keep Montgomery at bay. You do.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, okay, I'm liking the sound of this.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to keep my designer happy.",
        "Jennifer: Wait till I tell Mike that I have a bodyguard.",
        "Mike: Do you want to step aside? My wife's in there.",

        "Craig: Rosanna --",
        "Rosanna: Craig, please, I told you. This is a very tricky merger. I have to get these papers out.",
        "Craig: Well, this is important.",
        "Rosanna: Well, so is this. Excuse me. Sir, thank you so much for coming over. Could you please give these to the concierge? He's going to fax them out to my office in Detroit. Just remind him. I'll have a few more papers for you in a minute.",
        "Bartender: Whatever you need, Ms. Cabot.",
        "Craig: She needs a bottle of champagne.",
        "Rosanna: Champagne? I haven't even had breakfast yet. What are we celebrating? \"Marry me\"?",

        "Casey: What are you guys doing here?",
        "Will: Surgery. What's it look like? We're having breakfast.",
        "Casey: You could use a nose job. So really, what are you guys doing here?",
        "Will: We should really order. We don't want to get Celia in trouble.",
        "Casey: Dude, she's not gonna get in trouble. She's with me.",
        "Gwen: So you guys are both working here?",
        "Celia: Yeah, you should think about it. The pay's much better than at Al's.",
        "Casey: I don't think she'd like it here.",
        "Gwen: Why? 'cause I don't fit in?",
        "Celia: Of course you'd fit in. And you'd love it here. In fact, stick around. As soon as Casey and I are through training, we're gonna go hang out by the pool.",
        "Gwen: Um, I can't. I don't have a suit.",
        "Celia: That's okay. There's plenty of suits in the locker room.",
        "Gwen: I don't want to swim.",
        "Will: Yeah, we really ought to get out of here anyway. And you don't want your waitress friend on your case.",

        "Gwen: So much for avoiding the couple of the year.",
        "Will: Whatever. Let's just have breakfast, and then we'll leave.",
        "Barbara: Well, well, well. Look who's here. You mind if I join you all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: This is the water bill?",
        "Margo: Yes, and on behalf of the good people of Oakdale, I demand you pay up. Calls for a cup of coffee, huh? Oh, come on, Katie. You're supposed to be happy. It's not divorce papers.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, it will be, one of these days.",
        "Margo: Well, you said good-bye. You called it quits.",
        "Katie: Because I thought it was the right thing to do. It doesn't mean I wanted to do it.",
        "Margo: All right, go ahead. Explain. But use small words, because I just woke up.",
        "Katie: I still love him.",
        "Margo: Who?",
        "Katie: Henry. Oh, I know why you said that. Because of Mike. Well, yeah, okay. I still love Mike. But he's married, and he's going to stay married. And Henry is wonderful person who treats me like a queen. And he's crazy about me.",
        "Margo: Yeah, and he wants the whole nine yards, doesn't he? Not just what you've got left over after you subtract your unrequited, undying, unfulfilled thing with Mike.",
        "Katie: Well, you're the one who told me to end it, because it would be the far, far better thing to do and we would both be better off for it. But you know what? I'm miserable, and I'm betting he's miserable too.",
        "Margo: Who?",
        "Katie: Henry. Margo, I miss him so much. And I'm sure he misses me.",
        "Margo: Well, you know, Katie, marriage -- it's just a lot of work. It's hard work. And you're gonna make mistakes. And you're gonna hurt each other. And if you don't love each other, I mean really, truly, madly, madly, deeply, you're not gonna make it.",
        "Katie: Do I look like I'm making it? I need him.",

        "Jennifer: Deacon is my bodyguard.",
        "Mike: You're what?",
        "Jennifer: Its okay, it's okay. He really is my husband.",
        "Mike: Why would you hire a bodyguard?",
        "Dusty: She didn't. I did.",

        "Craig: Mm.",

        "Rosanna: Again?",
        "Craig: Yeah, why not?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, let me count the ways.",
        "Craig: Hey, I put my heart on a napkin, here.",
        "[Rosanna giggles]",
        "Rosanna: Your heart?",
        "Craig: Yeah, I've always loved you, you know that.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, please. I come right after hot buttered toast and cashmere socks. Next.",
        "Craig: And you love me.",
        "Rosanna: Next.",
        "Craig: And we're onto each other.",
        "Rosanna: Ah, yes. We're onto each other. What do you want?",
        "Craig: I want a new life. I want a home, a family.",
        "Rosanna: Uh-huh. Getting a little warmer, here.",
        "Craig: So I talked to a lawyer who said that if I want more than an occasional, supervised visit with my son, I should --",
        "Rosanna: You had to marry me.",
        "Craig: Yeah, so I thought what the heck? Why not? So what do you say? Will you marry me?",
        "Rosanna: No.",

        "Carly: Wow, Sage is asleep already. You've got the magic touch, huh?",
        "Hannah: Well, I was there when she was getting ready to come into the world. Maybe that gives me special powers.",
        "Parker: Hannah helps people have babies.",
        "J.J.: Are you a nurse? My mom was a nurse.",
        "Hannah: I'm a midwife. That's sort of the same thing.",
        "Carly: Sage was born in Montana, and that's where Hannah lives. And I'm so glad that Jack could tear you away.",
        "Hannah: He wasn't kidding when he said you had your hands full. I'm just glad I could help out.",
        "Parker: Mom, if Grandpa was at Mabel's, how come I never met him?",
        "Hannah: Who wants pancakes?",
        "J.J.: Me! Me, me, me!",
        "Parker: Me, too!",
        "Hannah: First one to wash gets to flip.",
        "Carly: You know something? The more I look at this, the more I think Parker is right. And what was my dad doing at Mabel's?",
        "Hannah: You know, I'm not sure he was, Carly. This could be anyplace.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but the sign. The sign is just like the Mabel's redhots. The same thing.",
        "Hannah: Honey, every town worth its salt has a Mabel's.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I guess you're right. And there's not any other picture here that puts him in Oakdale, so \u0096",
        "J.J.: Hannah, can I crack the eggs?",
        "Hannah: What's the magic word?",
        "J.J.: Please!",
        "Carly: Oh, Hannah? The picture?",
        "Hannah: Sorry.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Hannah: You know, it's not worth worrying about.",
        "Carly: You're probably right. Thanks.",
        "Hannah: You know, it's not worth worrying about.",
        "Carly: You're probably right.",

        "Barbara: Wow, you two are famished. Were you out late last night?",
        "Will: No, we were not out late last night.",
        "Celia: What would you like, Ms. Ryan?",
        "Barbara: Well, you know, I -- hello, Celia. [Celia giggles] I too will have the eggs benedict. It's done wonders for my son's disposition.",
        "Celia: Coming right up.",
        "Barbara: Thank you, honey. You know, she's very enterprising. But I know you do work, too, don't you Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: Mom, please, that's enough, just --",
        "Barbara: You know, ignore my son, he's always like this in the morning. When he was a little boy, I used to dream up these wonderful breakfasts to get him out of his morning mood. But no, no, no, he always wanted cold cereal. And that's no breakfast for a growing boy. But his dad, on the other hand, would always make him eggnog. Now, can you imagine? Raw eggs before breakfast? But on Easter -- Easter he would always want eggs benedict. And I would always get up early to make the hollandaise sauce. That's the sauce that's on the top.",
        "Will: Mom, she knows what hollandaise sauce is.",
        "Barbara: Well, of course she does, she works in a restaurant. But have you ever made it? I always clarify the butter. Then I pour I pour it very slowly into the raw eggs.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: Is it something I said?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know, I was just trying to help. There is a baby involved. Margo?",
        "Margo: Yes. It's fine. I know, I know.",
        "Katie: You're exhausted. I'm gonna go. I'll come back.",
        "Margo: No, don't. Let's just have some coffee, okay?",
        "Katie: No. None for me, thanks. But do you know? This whole thing with Craig is so ridiculous. I feel like I'm in the middle, and everybody's mad at me.",
        "Margo: Um, Mike?",
        "Katie: And Jennifer. And Craig.",
        "Margo: Well, Craig, he's just -- he's mad at the world.",
        "Katie: Well, it is his child. That means it is our nephew.",
        "Margo: Oh, it's a boy? Oh, man, no wonder he's so upset. But you know, that doesn't mean that you have to reign him in.",
        "Katie: I know, I just wanted him to feel like somebody was on his side. Not that you're not on his side, you know?",
        "Margo: No, it's just he's still mad at me for running him out of town. I can hardly blame him, really.",
        "Katie: Well, have you told him that?",
        "Margo: Sort of.",
        "Katie: You miss him, don't you?",
        "Margo: Sort of.",
        "Katie: Why is our family always such a mess?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty's just trying to help.",
        "Mike: By hiring a bodyguard? Now, don't you think that's a little extreme?",
        "Jennifer: Craig crashed my doctor's appointment and would not leave. Okay, what's to keep him from waltzing in here? I already feel safer with Deacon outside.",
        "Mike: Nobody wants you to feel safe more than I do. But to run scared is just ridiculous.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not scared. Especially now that Deacon's here. Now, I have to run these sketches down to production. Will you be here when I get back?",
        "Mike: I got some stuff I've got to do. I just wanted to see how you were doing.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, we're fine. See you later?",
        "Mike: Definitely. I'll be in production, with deacon.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Mike: If you think you're helping out, you're not. You just made matters worse.",
        "Dusty: I don't think your wife agrees.",

        "Craig: Yeah, come on, it's gonna be fun. You, me, a brand-new baby -- it's not Cabot, but he's gonna be great. Come on! [Rosanna laughs] You know I make you laugh, and then some.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, yes, and I have very fond memories of you making me laugh, and then some. And not such fond memories of the rest.",
        "Craig: Well, that was then. You know, I've changed.",
        "Rosanna: No, you haven't. Besides, I'm not -- I'm not ready to get married again.",
        "Craig: You're hoping Paul Ryan will leave his mirror and come back?",
        "Rosanna: So what if I am?",
        "Craig: It ain't gonna happen. It shouldn't happen. And the sooner you realize that, the happier you're going to be.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Henry: I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Take care of yourself. Good luck on the meeting.",
        "Mike: You are such a jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do you think I'm stupid?",
        "Carly: To turn Craig down?",
        "Rosanna: No, to hope that Paul will forgive me and take me back. Look, Craig, if you want to get married, there's plenty of naive girls who'd be happy to be the next Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: I like you.",
        "Rosanna: Even if we got married, in name only, Paul would never forgive me.",
        "Craig: So what? [Craig laughing] He's never gonna forgive you anyway.",
        "Rosanna: Why? If I just keep trying to apologize, to explain --",
        "Craig: To explain what? That you know how much easier it is for him to blame you than his mother. How hard it is for him to accept the fact that he's no match for his father.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I don't want him to be a match for his father. I like him the way he is.",
        "Craig: You may choose to accept his copious limitations, but believe me, he doesn't.",
        "Rosanna: You know, if you keep going like this, I'm going to get angry.",
        "Craig: All right, fine. Get angry, good. Wake up. Realize that he is not for you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Craig, darling, neither are you.",
        "Craig: Yeah. All right, just -- just think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Jennifer is pregnant. She needs less stress, not more.",
        "Dusty: That's why I hired Deacon.",
        "Mike: A guy like Deacon brings trouble. Craig sees a bodyguard, he hires a lawyer, which means that we've got to hire a lawyer.",
        "Dusty: It's about time, don't you think?",
        "Mike: This -- this is not your war. Dusty, there doesn't have to be a war if I can calm down all the people involved.",
        "Dusty: Craig Montgomery's not calming down. He wants what he wants. The sooner you understand this, the better, I'm telling you.",
        "Mike: Okay, you know what? I've told Paul, now I'm telling you -- back off. Jennifer's my wife, my responsibility.",
        "Dusty: You run your house your way, God bless. But this is my house. And when that door opens, and my designer starts to twitch, that's a problem. I got a business to run. If I got to put muscle out front, that's the way it is. I got work to do.",

        "Gwen: Oh. Hi, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Hi, honey. You okay? You're pretty pale. I heard you getting sick in there.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just not used to hollandaise in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, um, what's the deal with you and Gwen?",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Casey: Well, yesterday, you brought her to the hospital to say hi to your sister. And now you're bringing her to the club.",
        "Will: So?",
        "Casey: Look, I just don't want you to feel, you know -- obligated.",
        "Will: But you never feel obligated, do you?",
        "Casey: I'm trying to let you off the hook here, man. I mean, you got roped into taking her to the prom because Celia's always going on about the four of us, and there's no \"the four of us,\" it's me and Celia. And you and me are friends, that's it.",
        "Will: But you're not telling me what to do.",
        "Casey: Look, the thing is, and I'm not trying to come off like a player here, because I'm not. But Gwen has a thing for me, or at least she did. And I don't want her using you to get next to me.",
        "Will: So you're looking out for me?",
        "Casey: You and Celia. I mean, you've seen her. She thinks Gwen's her best friend. This -- this whole thing, it's not headed anywhere good.",
        "Will: So you're worried about Celia?",
        "Casey: She means everything to me. And I'm not gonna let Gwen, or anybody, mess that up.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I have to go.",

        "Celia: What kind of trouble?",
        "Will: Nothing. My mother tends to overreact.",
        "Barbara: I am not overreacting. And I thought you cared about this girl.",
        "Will: I do. She's my friend. And I've said that 300 times.",
        "Barbara: Well, then if she's your friend, you have a responsibility to help her.",
        "Celia: With what?",
        "Will: Nothing. I think we shouldn't be talking about Gwen behind her back. She'd hate it.",
        "Celia: He's right about that. She's a very private person.",
        "Barbara: All right, it's wonderful that you're being so sensitive about this. But I've been in the fashion industry long enough to recognize something like this.",
        "Will: The fashion industry?",
        "Barbara: Okay. My son wishes to turn a blind eye. So it's up to us girls. I walked into the ladies room, and Gwen was throwing up, right after she had devoured her eggs benedict.",
        "Celia: Oh, my God. You think she's bulimic?",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes, I do.",
        "Will: Trust me, Gwen's not bulimic.",
        "Celia: No, I think your mom's right. Thank you, Ms. Ryan. I'm going to get Gwen.",
        "Will: No, no, you can't do that. Don't you have to work?",
        "Celia: Not right now. I'm off till lunch. Thanks again, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: You're welcome.",

        "Mike: That's a good idea.",
        "Katie: That was Henry's. He could sell ice to Eskimos.",

        "Dusty: Yes, Jen, of course I have.",
        "Jennifer: But you've never put your hands on a pregnant belly. Are you embarrassed?",
        "Dusty: That's very helpful of you to point that out. Can we please, Jen -- can we please get back to work?",
        "Jennifer: You don't need to be embarrassed. All right, Dusty? It's a new life. It's a very beautiful thing.",

        "Dusty: Not at all. Deacon's a great buffer. And if you're ever, you know, while you're working, you need to go to the hospital, he'll be glad to take you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, so that's why you hired him. Because, then you don't have to hold my hand in the back of the ambulance.",

        "Jennifer: So you would never want to watch your child being born?",
        "Dusty: Yes, I would, Jen, after they clean him up, you know? That's all. I'll meet him after it's presentable. There's not one ancient culture that had men in the room while that stuff was going on. I'm very pro-woman, believe me. President, whatever, designer --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank you.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. But you know, some things are meant to be private. I don't want to be looking at my wife while she's going nuts, wife while she's going nuts, and I can't possibly help her in any way.",

        "Mike: There's no young lady. And if there is, you're a bigger idiot than I thought you were. You love Katie.",

        "Henry: I'm sorry. No can do.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Henry: Because, Mike -- somewhere along the way to falling in love with her,I realized what I wanted. I wanted her to look at me the way she still looks at you. And since there is no chance of that happening --",
        "Mike: Well, there is. Henry, I have seen her look at you. She loves you.",
