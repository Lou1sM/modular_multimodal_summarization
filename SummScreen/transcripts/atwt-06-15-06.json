        "Nancy: Here we are.",
        "Mike: Hey, what exactly are we doing here?",
        "Katie: We're seeing Nancy off on her cruise.",
        "Mike: Okay. And we couldn't just do that from the dock because --",
        "Katie: Because she wants us to see her cabin. Besides, it's more personal this way. I mean, after everything Nancy's done for us, especially getting the wedding ready and everything, don't we owe her that much?",
        "Mike: Nancy's really planning on going on a cruise by herself?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I think it's sweet. Besides, maybe she'll get as lucky as me and find true romance.",
        "Mike: I'm the lucky one.",
        "Nancy: Aren't you two going to come in and check things out?",
        "Katie: We're this close, let's go.",
        "Nancy: What do you think?",
        "Katie: It's perfect.",
        "Mike: Wow. So, where do you have him hidden?",
        "Nancy: Who?",
        "Mike: The secret boyfriend. You got flowers, champagne -- it's pretty romantic.",
        "Katie: Does that mean you like it?",
        "Mike: Yeah, it's a great suite, but -- you know, it's Nancy's. What difference does it make whether I like it or not?",
        "Katie: Just wondering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Casey: That was Zach. He hasn't seen Will, but he's gonna keep looking for him. Don't worry, we're gonna find him.",
        "Gwen: All right. All right.",
        "Will: She already has.",
        "Casey: Dude! Where the hell have you been, man? I was beginning to think that you -- well, forget what I was thinking. The most important thing is that you're here and you're okay.",
        "Will: Yeah, sorry I had you worried.",
        "Casey: Me? Your wife was the one who was freaked out. You're gonna be apologizing to her for a good long time.",
        "Gwen: He's already started.",
        "Casey: So, does that means you guys are cool?",
        "Gwen: Better than cool.",
        "Casey: Good, I'm glad. So, where were you hiding out all night?",
        "Will: Let's just say I got a little lost.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but then you got found again.",
        "Casey: Welcome back.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Casey: So, what about grad-I-ating? Is Latin land gonna give you another shot?",
        "Will: No. I'm gonna go to summer school at Oakdale High. I think Oakdale Latin's had enough of me.",
        "Casey: As long as you get that diploma, that's what's important, right?",
        "Will: Right. And I'm going to get it this time without cheating. I won't. I swear.",
        "Gwen: You better not.",
        "Maddie: Will! Oh my God, you're alive!",
        "Will: Hey, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Where have you been?",
        "Gwen: Never mind, because we're not talking about last night ever again. He's back. And he needs your help.",
        "Maddie: My help? Yeah, sure. What do you need?",
        "Will: Well, I'm doing summer school to graduate. So I'm going to need your Calculus brain again.",
        "Maddie: Hey, you got it. But this time, we're going to get to the finish line the right way. Okay? I promise, you won't ever have to go to people like Jade Taylor for help again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Stacell: Jade?",
        "Jade: Over here, Ms. Stacell. What's up?",
        "Ms. Stacell: I just spoke with Principal Weber, over at Oakdale Latin.",
        "Jade: Oh, did they ever find out about that person that helped that student buy the paper online?",
        "Ms. Stacell: As a matter fact, yes. He knows the truth.",
        "Jade: Oh --",
        "Ms. Stacell: And so do I. So why don't we stop the charade?",
        "Jade: Charade?",
        "Ms. Stacell: We know it was you, Jade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This is Ross Kreeger. He's here to talk to you, not me.",
        "Ross: That's right.",
        "Luke: About what? I mean, no offense, but I don't even know who you are.",
        "Ross: Well, your mother's told me a lot about you. Especially the rather traumatic things you've had to face this past year.",
        "Luke: Now, why would you do that?",
        "Lily: Don't be so suspicious. Ross Kreeger has a family foundation that runs a summer program for kids your age.",
        "Ross: It's up in the mountains. Its right by the most gorgeous lake you'll ever see. Sailing, fishing, swimming, water-skiing -- you name it, we got it.",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds great. But what does that have to do with me?",
        "Lily: I thought you might want to spend some time there this summer.",
        "Luke: I'm a little too old for camp, don't you think?",
        "Ross: Well, it's not a camp, per se. It's more like a place where kids who've faced special challenges can meet new people, learn new skills, trade war stories.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and you thought that I'd be a perfect candidate.",
        "Ross: Well, we have a lot of young people who've been through the kind of medical crisis you have, your kidney transplant.",
        "Luke: But, why would I want to sit around and talk about that? Yeah, it's been a really hard year, but I'm trying to forget it.",
        "Ross: And you will. There's so much more going on in our program, I promise you. This can be truly a life-changing experience. It's a chance to get in touch with your inner self.",
        "Luke: Well, that's nice, but I think I'll pass.",
        "Lily: Fine, but just hear what he has to say.",
        "Luke: Why, Mom? I'm not interested. And you're acting like I don't know what this is about. I know that you want to send me away because you don't want to have to deal with who I am.",
        "Lily: That is not true!",
        "Luke: And if you won't me to go, fine, I'll leave. But I'm not going to go to some reject camp up in the mountains. I'll find my own place.",
        "Lily: No -- excuse me for a minute. Luke, wait --",
        "Ross: No, Lily, don't. Luke's reaction is normal. Let's stick to the plan. Now, don't you have an appointment you have to get to?",
        "Lily: I have to go to the library.",
        "Ross: Okay, go to the library and give me another chance with Luke. I see this kind of initial resistance a lot, but if I have a little time, I'm sure I can get him excited about my program.",
        "Lily: I don't know how I feel about this. I don't know -- I don't want him to feel like I'm pushing him away.",
        "Ross: That's why I think it's better if I talk to him alone. [Cell phone ringing] Excuse me. I have to take this.",
        "Lily: Just listen to what he has to say. This whole conversation has gotten way off track.",
        "Luke: No, Mom, this whole year has gotten way off track. Tell dad I'll be at Grandma Lucinda's.",
        "Lily: Please don't go. Please?",
        "Luke: Why not? This is what you want, isn't it? I mean, you made it very clear that you don't want me around here.",
        "Lily: That is not true!",
        "Luke: What's up with this camp, anyways? Are you secretly hoping that they can change me back into somebody that you want me to be?",
        "Lily: No, you're misinterpreting everything. I'm thinking about you and maybe having some time for you to get away. Go someplace nice where you can clear your head. You had a horrible year. And now Damian's back, I don't want you to feel like you're stuck in the middle of this fight between your father and Damian and you've got to take sides!",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I'm going to deal with that.",
        "Lily: No, you don't have to deal with it. You should not have to deal with it. Let Holden and Damian deal with it. In the meantime, shouldn't you have some time for yourself? Away from all the tension? Spend some time with kids your own age, away from all the fighting?",
        "Luke: You mean the fighting between Dad and Damian? Or the fighting between Dad and you?",
        "Ross: There's some opposition, but that's to be expected. The mother isn't helping. I'm trying to get her to leave so I can have some one-on-one time with Luke.",
        "Damian: Lily's refusing to leave?",
        "Ross: No, no. I think she has to go to the library.",
        "Damian: Good, I'm trusting you to convince Luke to go with you, Ross. Today.",
        "Ross: Don't worry. Once Lily's gone, I'll have no trouble talking him into it. I need time. So you've got to keep her away, as long as you can.",
        "Damian: Leave Lily to me. Remember, my name must never come up during your talk with Luke. He can't know that I'm behind this.",
        "Ross: Yes, we've been over this. Trust me.",
        "Damian: I'm trusting you with a great deal.",
        "Ross: You don't need to worry. I guarantee results.",
        "Damian: I'm counting on it. I want my son straightened out before this summer is over.",
        "Lily: You're right, there has been tension between your father and me, yes.",
        "Luke: Because of me.",
        "Lily: No, because of me. Because it hasn't been as easy for me to accept your life choice as you would like it to be or your father.",
        "Luke: You haven't accepted it at all.",
        "Lily: I'm trying. I'm trying. I just want a little time. And yes, maybe, if you do go away for awhile, I can get some perspective on things without causing you any more pain.",
        "Luke: See, I was right. You want me to go.",
        "Lily: No. That's not what I'm saying at all. I thought maybe -- I don't know -- maybe you could go and have some fun, be with some kids, while the adults around here work out all of our problems. Then come back and have a clean slate. Doesn't that make sense to you? At all?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess a little bit. Okay, look, I'll talk to this Ross person.",
        "Lily: You will? Really, really?",
        "Luke: Yeah, if it can make things a little calmer here, then maybe it's a good idea.",
        "Lily: All right, thanks. Ross, Luke would like to hear more about what you're offering. Right, Luke?",
        "Luke: Yes, I will hear what you have to say.",
        "Ross: Excellent. You won't regret this.",
        "Luke: Okay, I'm not promising I'm gonna go, or anything like that. Just that I'll hear you out.",
        "Ross: Fair enough. Now, perhaps if Luke and I had a little bit of time together, just to talk.",
        "Lily: Is that okay with you?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I mean, if you've got somewhere to go, then you should go.",
        "Lily: I just have a quick appointment. Okay. But if there's any problem or anything, just call me on my cell phone, okay? Okay.",
        "Ross: Okay, Luke. Let me tell you about a fantastic place called Echo Lake, and how the Kreeger foundation fits in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh -- Damian Grimaldi, we meet again. This place used to be such a cute club, now they just let anybody at all in, don't they?",
        "Damian: Lucinda, you are as lovely and charming as ever.",
        "Lucinda: Save your wit and your charm for somebody that really responds to it. I will never, ever, ever forget what you've done to my family.",
        "Damian: I sense you're not happy I've returned.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm about as happy as I would be if I were hit by lightning.",
        "Damian: Now, can't we leave our dislike for each other in the past and agree to be civil for Luciano's sake?",
        "Lucinda: Don't you pretend to me that you're back here to make amends to Luke. You're not. If you're back here, it means there's something in it for you.",
        "Damian: I don't understand -- what do you mean?",
        "Lucinda: You're angling for something, I don't know what it is. But, it's my job, I'm going to find out. And I warn you, ask for you tomorrow and they'll find you a grave man. I will see you in your grave before I let you harm another member of my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Let's leave Jade out of this. Nobody twisted my arm. Nobody forced me to cheat. It's all on me.",
        "Maddie: Okay, I don't believe for a minute that it was your idea to buy that biology paper online. Jade saw that you were drowning and came up with the world's worst plan to save you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, can we just forget about Jade and the paper and the whole mess? It's old news. Will is starting fresh. Let's leave it at that, okay?",
        "Maddie: Sure. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up a sore subject.",
        "Will: Yeah, don't worry about it.",
        "Casey: Just don't do it again. So, we should, like, have a party or something, right? Will's alive. He's going to graduate. Everything's back to normal again, right?",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I've already got it all planned. A big celebration, right here, tonight.",
        "Will: Really?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Since you didn't hear me sing last night, I figured I'd do it all over again tonight. A special encore performance just for you.",
        "Will: Well, that's fantastic.",
        "Gwen: I need your help.",
        "Maddie: What? What, are you going to sing a song about, like, Calculus or something?",
        "Gwen: Uhh -- no. I need you to help me pick out something to wear.",
        "Maddie: You want my advice on how a rock star should dress?",
        "Gwen: I'm serious.",
        "Maddie: Okay, I don't know whether to be flattered or terrified. But --",
        "Casey: Both.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I've got some stuff in the back. Come with me. We will see you guys later. Good-bye.",
        "Will: So, are you going to let me have it now?",
        "Casey: I'm the last person to give you a hard time about lying to Gwen.",
        "Will: Still, you must think that I'm pretty lame.",
        "Casey: You got scared. You were under a mountain of pressure and you messed up. Hell, we've all been there, man. I just wish you'd have come to me before it got too out of hand. I could've saved you from a really bad night and what I bet was a wicked hangover.",
        "Will: Still is. So, what advice would you have given me?",
        "Casey: Suck it up. Spill everything to Gwen. Don't keep lying about it. If there's anything I've learned, it's that just when you think you're going to get away with something, it ends up coming back to get you. Bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Whoever's pointing the finger at me is lying.",
        "Ms. Stacell: No one's pointing any fingers, Jade. They don't have to. The evidence speaks for itself.",
        "Jade: Evidence?",
        "Ms. Stacell: You weren't as careful as you thought.",
        "Jade: What are you talking about?",
        "Ms. Stacell: The young man who bought the paper used your employee access code to log onto the web.",
        "Jade: Well, that doesn't prove anything. Obviously, he got a hold of my code somehow. Or somebody else did, and used it to log on.",
        "Ms. Stacell: Shall we call him in and ask him? Do you really want to open this up into a full-blown investigation?",
        "Jade: What choice are you giving me?",
        "Ms. Stacell: There is no choice. You're fired. Effective immediately.",
        "Jade: No, please don't this. I need this job. I have nowhere else to go.",
        "Ms. Stacell: You should've thought of that before you abused your working privileges.",
        "Jade: I'm telling you, I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Ms. Stacell: My mind is made up, Jade. I want you to leave as peacefully and quickly as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: To the two most in-love people I know. Here's to eternal happiness.",
        "Katie: Thank you. What a beautiful toast, Nancy.",
        "Mike: Yes, thank you. But shouldn't we be toasting you?",
        "Nancy: Why me?",
        "Mike: Well, you're the one that's going on a cruise. That's a pretty exciting adventure.",
        "Nancy: It's exciting, all right.",
        "Katie: Mike's right. Actually, Nancy, we should toast to you. So, here's to Nancy. The most hopeful and helpful person I know.",
        "Mike: Cheers. I have to admit. This suite is fantastic.",
        "Nancy: Almost a shame to waste it on just me.",
        "Mike: I still think you're hiding a man under the bed.",
        "Nancy: You are free to search the place.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, I'll leave that up to you, after we get back on shore. Which we might want to think about doing before we get stuck on this boat for the duration.",
        "Katie: I could think of worse things that could happen to us.",
        "Mike: Yes, but this is Nancy's cruise, not ours. Nobody likes a third wheel on their adventure.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Nancy: Come in.",
        "Bellman: Where should I put these, ma'am?",
        "Nancy: Right there will fine.",
        "Mike: Funny, I have a set of luggage just like these. Wait a second, this is my luggage. What's going on?",
        "Katie: What do you think?",
        "Mike: Well, I think that either you loaned my luggage to Nancy, or she thinks that I'm sailing away with her.",
        "Katie: You're about half right.",
        "Mike: Am I? Which half?",
        "Katie: The sailing away part.",
        "Nancy: Don't look at me. This was your wife's idea.",
        "Mike: Does somebody want to tell me exactly what's going on here?",
        "Nancy: I'll leave the explanation to Katie. I really must be on my way. I'm meeting Kim for dinner.",
        "Mike: Kim's your date on the cruise?",
        "Nancy: Kim is my date at the Lakeview. Bon voyage, you two. Do everything I wouldn't do!",
        "Mike: Nancy, Nancy -- you better start explaining.",
        "Katie: Remember when we were talking this morning, and you were saying how hard it was going to be not to run into reminders of all the bad things that led up to Nick's death?",
        "Mike: Yeah, so, you what? Booked us on a cruise to get away from it all?",
        "Katie: You gotta admit it. It's genius.",
        "Mike: I thought I said running wouldn't solve our problems.",
        "Katie: I know that. But this isn't about solving our problems. It's just about getting away from them for a little while so we can get our heads straight and -- reconnect.",
        "Mike: I wish you would've talked to me about it first.",
        "Katie: Well, I would've risked you saying no. And if you're worried about the money, don't be. I cashed that residual check Lucinda gave me. With all the problems that this book caused us, at least the money from it can help get rid of them. Oh, come on! You have to admit, it's a good surprise.",
        "Mike: It's a good surprise, all right. I'm just not sure it's such a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: We used to be friends, you and I, once. Have you forgotten?",
        "Lucinda: You are the one that destroyed the friendship. Have you forgotten that?",
        "Damian: You're talking about something that happened a very long time ago, Lucinda. And I do regret it. More than you know.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, well, if you're man enough to admit that, why not be man enough to accept the fact that -- you can only do harm to Luciano. Leave the kid alone. Leave him alone. In fact, leave us all alone.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry, but that's simply not possible. I am not leaving town until I know for sure that Luciano is as happy and healthy as he deserves to be.",
        "Lucinda: He is. He's happy, he's healthy, he's a great kid. He's putting one foot in front of the other. You gotta see that you coming back now just adds stress to his life.",
        "Damian: You know, you should be pointing fingers at Holden, not me.",
        "Lucinda: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Damian: Given the job he's done with Luciano, you all should be welcoming my presence here.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not sure that I quite understand what you mean.",
        "Damian: I know that a boy does not become a man without a strong role model in his life.",
        "Lucinda: Only you, Damian, would take the news that Luke is gay to make it a cause to blame Holden.",
        "Damian: Oh, is that how I came across? I'm sorry, you misunderstood me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, gosh. Well, then why don't you just explain yourself more clearly?",
        "Damian: Simply said, I don't believe Holden has set a very good example for my son.",
        "Lucinda: And you think that you would do a better one? Isn't it a little late for that? And anyway, you wouldn't. And you couldn't because you're too selfish. Parenting takes sacrifice -- you don't know the meaning of that word.",
        "Damian: You have no idea the length I will go for my son, Lucinda. And I intend to. That, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: What, you're just going to pretend I don't exist?",
        "Lily: I have nothing to say to you, Jade.",
        "Jade: Please, don't be this way. I think about you a lot.",
        "Lily: What do you think about? You think about missed opportunities?",
        "Jade: How are Faith and Natalie?",
        "Lily: They're fine.",
        "Jade: Would you tell them that I said hi?",
        "Lily: Now why would I do that?",
        "Jade: Despite what you think and everything else, they cared about me. And so did Luke.",
        "Lily: Do me a favor. Forget about Luke. Forget about my children. Forget about my entire family altogether, please.",
        "Jade: I can't. Staying in your home was one of the best times in my whole life.",
        "Lily: You conned us. You made us believe you were Rose's daughter. You got Luke to pretend that you were his girlfriend so he wouldn't have to tell us he thought he was gay.",
        "Jade: Think it? He doesn't think it. Lily, he knows it. I'm sorry this is still hard for you to handle.",
        "Lily: I don't need your pity.",
        "Jade: What I did was stupid. And I blew a really good thing when I lost your trust. But I wish you would just let me make it up to you. Maybe I could take the girls one afternoon to go swimming or something? And maybe Luke could come along.",
        "Lily: You know, Luke's not going to be around for the summer. And as far as my girls, I don't want you anywhere near them.",
        "Jade: Luke's going away? He didn't mention that he was going anywhere or had any plans for the summer.",
        "Lily: So, what does that tell you? Luke doesn't care if you know what he's doing or where he's going. So face it, our lives are none of your business anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: So, as you can see, there's a lot going on.",
        "Luke: Hey, you got horseback riding.",
        "Ross: You ride?",
        "Luke: Yeah, my dad breeds horses, so I kind of grew up with it.",
        "Ross: Well, we're always looking for good instructors. Perhaps you can spend some of your time sharing your experience with some of our beginners.",
        "Luke: You'd let me do that?",
        "Ross: Of course. Our program is geared to build confidence and self-esteem in guys like you.",
        "Luke: You don't know anything about me. What kind of guy is it that you think I am?",
        "Ross: You're a leader. You just don't know it yet. But you will when you finish the program.",
        "Luke: And how do you figure that?",
        "Ross: We teach you to tap into your strengths and overcome your weaknesses. By the time you're done, you'll know more about who you are and what you really want out of life than you ever could've imagined. And then, we teach you how to get it. When you get back you'll be ready to take on the world, Luke. You won't be afraid of anything anymore.",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds like an awful lot to offer in six weeks.",
        "Ross: Well, you'll be surprised what you can accomplish in six weeks.",
        "Luke: I guess it does sound kind of fun.",
        "Ross: Great, I knew you'd think so. So, how long will it take you to pack?",
        "Luke: Pack? What are you talking about?",
        "Ross: Well, the van's outside. It's a long drive. Don't worry, you won't need much. Some sneakers, lots of t-shirts and shorts. A few bathing suits. We supply everything else, so you should be fine with a small duffel.",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds nice, but I won't need anything, because I'm not going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I can't believe you have the gall to ask me to let my children anywhere near you.",
        "Jade: Look, I'm going to be running into Luke around town. I even saw him yesterday. We talked a little bit. And I made me realize how much I miss him, and Faith and Natalie.",
        "Lily: I didn't think Luke was even talking to you.",
        "Jade: Well, it's still a little bit awkward. But he told me that his biological dad was in town.",
        "Lily: He told you that?",
        "Jade: Yeah. He was hoping the guy would help you deal with the whole gay thing.",
        "Ms. Stacell: Jade, you're still here? I'm going to need to ask for your key.",
        "Jade: I left it at home, maybe you can let me mail it to you.",
        "Ms. Stacell: I know you've been sleeping here, spending nights, sleeping on the floor between the stacks. So obviously you carry your key with you. Please, hand it over.",
        "Jade: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Ms. Stacell: The key, Jade. Now. There's a list of shelters in the front lobby if you need to find a place to sleep. But it's not going to be here anymore.",
        "Lily: Looks like you get kicked out of every place you land.",
        "Jade: You know what? When you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, I guess it's really hard to understand how tough the real world is. But you know what? Some of us actually have to live in it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, do you remember anything about last night? Or were you just too wasted?",
        "Will: What I do remember I'd just as soon forget.",
        "Casey: You're lucky Gwen's so understanding. Last night was pretty rough for her.",
        "Will: Yeah. Well, it's a good thing that she had you there to help her through it.",
        "Casey: Whoa, whoa, hold on. You don't think that Gwen and I were --",
        "Will: No, not anymore.",
        "Casey: What do you mean, not anymore?",
        "Will: Well, I did last night, but I was drunk.",
        "Casey: Well, I'm glad you sobered up because you were way off base. All she was thinking about was you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'm all set with something to wear.",
        "Maddie: It turns out that I have more fashion sense than I thought. Gwen is going to rock it.",
        "Gwen: Oh, indeed.",
        "Will: Well, that's great. I can't wait to see it. But, I gotta get out of here right now.",
        "Gwen: Where to?",
        "Will: Well, summer school starts in a week. So I'm going to find out if I can use the books from last semester on the classes I have to make up.",
        "Gwen: You'll be back later, right?",
        "Will: Yeah, of course. I'm not going to miss it.",
        "Gwen: Hey, can I tell you that I'm still really proud of you without sounding all gooey?",
        "Will: Gwen, I don't deserve for you to be proud of me, yet.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. Yeah, you do. You fell down, and you're getting back up on the horse. That takes guts.",
        "Will: Yeah, the only bummer is that I'm going to be spending the summer in a classroom, instead of out lying by the pool with you.",
        "Gwen: Well, we'll just have to find time for you to do both. [Cell phone rings] aren't you going to answer it?",
        "Will: Uh, no.",
        "Gwen: It looks like somebody you don't want to talk to.",
        "Will: Well, it's not important.",

        "Will: What do you want me to do?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Uh, it's just my mother calling. And no, I don't want to talk to her right now, you know? 'Cause she's probably just going to turn the worst day of my life into something that was all about her.",
        "Gwen: I'm not defending her, but she was really worried about you last night. She's probably just calling to make sure you're okay. I could talk to her.",
        "Will: No, no. Let her sweat it out, you know? 'Cause if she finds out that I'm fine and planning on going to summer school, then she's probably just going to dangle my trust fund over my head all summer. So, I'll just let her know that I did it when it's all over.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: All right? I gotta go. So, I'll see you later.",
        "Gwen: All right, bye.",
        "Maddie: Can you believe it? Like, 24 hours ago, you guys -- it was, like, the end of the world for you guys, and now, you're better than ever.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. And all the time that I've been with Will, I never felt so close to losing him as I did last night.",
        "Maddie: But you didn't. And now that everything's out in the open, you're not going to. Ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Yes, I have lived a privileged life. Is that an excuse for you to scam me? How dare you cry poor to justify your con job.",
        "Jade: I made a mistake. I've made lots of mistakes. But I am not a bad person. And I was not trying to worm my way back into your house just now. I'm trying to show you that I am not the monster you think I am.",
        "Lily: Why should you care? Why do you care what I think of you?",
        "Jade: Because I care about Luke. I know what I did was wrong. But I did it to protect him. At least I can accept him for who he is. You're his mother, why can't you?",
        "Lily: You know, I'm not going to stand here and take parental advice from you.",
        "Jade: Go ahead. Go ahead and hate me for not being who you wanted me to be. But Luke is your son. You're supposed to love him no matter what. At least Luke thought so. And that's why he finally worked up the courage to tell you that he was gay. He thought you would understand. But you let him down. Just like I let you down. You would think that would make us even.",
        "Lily: Metamorphosing youth? What does that mean? Excuse me, could I use your computer, one of the computers to get on the internet?",
        "Ms. Stacell: Certainly. There's a card to show you how to log on.",
        "Lily: Okay, thank you.",

        "Luke: My mom didn't say anything about leaving today, and all I said was that I would hear you out.",
        "Ross: All right, but you admit, it's a pretty impressive program.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I --",
        "Ross: This is a first-come, first-served opportunity. A slot opened up and I'm offering it to you, Luke, but you've got to start the program with the others in your group. You can't join it in progress. That's why we have to leave today. Look, your mother's on board. What's there to worry about?",
        "Luke: Okay, well, let me just call my dad, and see what he thinks about it --",
        "Ross: No, no. No, no, no, Luke, calling your dad would be a really bad idea.",

        "Katie: So what? That's what tomorrow's for. Let's just make today about us. When was the last time we had a chance to do that?",
        "Mike: You know, it sounds tempting. I just don't know. I'm just afraid that's everything's going to come up again, and it will just hang over us like a black cloud. What kind of honeymoon would that be?",
        "Katie: We won't let it affect us. Okay? This cruise is a chance to remember all of the things that are wonderful about being together. It will make us stronger. Then, when we get back, we'll be able to handle whatever life throws at us. But until then, I think we deserve a little happiness.",

        "Will: Okay, well, I'll just tell her that you logged me on, and you didn't know what I was doing.",
        "Jade: She's not going to believe you anyway. It's over, I'm out. But it's fine. I didn't really like that job much, anyway. Just the paycheck.",

        "Mike: Okay. All right, you win. We'll take this trip together.",
        "Katie: Could you sound a little more enthusiastic?",
        "Mike: How's this?",
        "Katie: No, I mean it, Mike. [Mike laughs] I don't want you just to say that you're into this. You have to have your heart in it, otherwise what's the point?",
