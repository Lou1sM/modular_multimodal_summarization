        "Paul arrives for his supervised visit with Eliza, as he seems to be on his best behavior even as he has to stifle his curiosity when he learns that Dusty is no longer a part of Meg's life. Lily and Damian arrive, as Lily offers to watch Paul interact with Eliza as Damian whisks Meg away for a fun day. Meg is unsure at first, but is coaxed into it and winds up having a wonderful day on a boat and then private beach area with a picnic prepared by Damian. Their day is interrupted when heading home, they realize their dingy that was tied up had floated away and are forced to call the coast guard for help. Damian and Meg enjoy the extra time together, as they flirt, but Meg explains that she is not ready to jump into another relationship. Damian thinks it is because of Dusty. Meg admits that may be a part of it, but it is also uet until she feels she has some semblance of control over her life. He isn't going anywhere, which seems to please Meg. Once home, Lily hears the tale of what happened and wonders how come Damian didn't take advantage of his situation. He wants everyone to know he is changed. Lily seems a touch intrigued by him, as she watches him and Meg interact. Faith asks Paul a pointed question as to why he took Eliza away from her mother. Faith admits that she was never worried while he was gone because the Paul she knew was always good to her and Parker. Craig visits Rosanna and offers to drop the charges if Rosanna tells Carly that he did something nice for her despite what she almost did to him. Rosanna sees a genuine concern in Craig and goes to see Carly. Parker watches over Carly, who has no memory at first of almost hitting Craig. Parker voices his concerns for what is going on with her, but Carly explains that accident was the wakeup call she needed to stop drinking. Parker is leery, but Carly promises she will stop and they will start fresh. Carly can't seem to function without a drink and almost takes one before she smashes the glass. Rosanna comes by for a visit and notices how badly Carly looks and realizes she almost hit Craig with her car. Rosanna wants to know what is going on with her, but Carly pretends it is just a bug. They talk about what happened before she arrived back in Oakdale, but Carly pretends she is better now that Rosanna is back. Later, Parker sees Rosanna and hopes now that she is back things can get back to normal, but he doesn't exactly tell Rosanna about Carly's drinking problem when she asks what is going on. Carly goes to see Craig to apologize and thank him for always being on her side even when he could have turned his back. He promises never to do that, as Carly admits even after the DUI and almost hitting him, all she can think about is drinking. Craig wants her to think about anything else, as Carly leans in and kisses him. Craig offers her an out, but Carly wants to stay with him, as they continue to kiss passionately when she admits with him is the only place she feels safe."

        "Paul: I know I'm probably the last person you expected to see on your doorstep, but --",
        "Meg: What do you want?",
        "Paul: I wanted to thank you. I got the visitation papers. You didn't have to do that.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. And if you do anything -- if I get any inclination that you're gonna take Eliza and run again --",
        "Paul: I'll follow all of the rules. I just -- I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're giving me a chance to prove to you that I can be trusted with our daughter. I'm sure if Dusty had his way, I wouldn't see Eliza at all. I'd be locked up.",
        "Meg: Well, Dusty's opinion doesn't matter anymore.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: My personal life is none of your business, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, you know, it kind of is. I mean, if I'm gonna be visiting Eliza, chances are that Dusty and I will wind up face-to-face, or face-to-fist, if he has anything to say about it.",
        "Meg: Okay, whether I am seeing Dusty or not is irrelevant right now. Visitation means that you get to spend time with our daughter, not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: [Sighs] I'm dying.",
        "Parker: You're finally awake.",
        "Carly: Shh, quietly. I have the world's worst headache.",
        "Parker: Mom. Headache. Yeah, right.",
        "Carly: I must be coming down with something.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, however bad you feel, I'm sure Craig feels a whole lot worse.",
        "Carly: What? Why would Craig feel badly? Even if he did, why would you care? I know he's far from being your favorite person.",
        "Parker: You're kidding, right? Oh, my God, Mom, you don't remember, do you?",
        "Carly: I don't remember what?",
        "Parker: You nearly killed Craig yesterday.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Good morning, Rosanna. You don't mind if I don't wait for you to offer me a seat.",
        "Rosanna: No, go ahead. I heard you had a little encounter with a hit-and-run driver yesterday.",
        "Craig: Really? Where'd you hear that?",
        "Rosanna: From Margo. She was by here. She wanted to know whether I was indulging in a little vigilante justice.",
        "Craig: \"A little vengeance is mine, sayeth Rosanna.\"",
        "Rosanna: [Chuckles] Ahh. I didn't try to run you down, Craig.",
        "Craig: I know you didn't. Don't worry. I'll straighten things out with Margo.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, good. Terrific. You know, she didn't say anything about the money that was taken out of your account.",
        "Craig: You mean the money you stole? That money? Well, that doesn't surprise me. She doesn't know anything about it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you do plan on telling her.",
        "Craig: Not anymore.",
        "Rosanna: Are you serious?",
        "Craig: Let's just say a near-death experience has a way of changing your perspective, even when it comes to grand larceny. So what do you say you put that money back, and I won't press charges? I have to admit, that's more than fair.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, it is. I just -- I just can't help wondering why the heck you'd do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Why would I try to kill Craig?",
        "Parker: I don't know. But you aimed the car right at him. I saw you, Mom. And yeah, afterwards, you didn't seem to remember that much, but we talked about it and it all came back to you. At least I thought it did.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I don't remember any of this.",
        "Parker: You drove the car up on the curb, nearly hit him.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. How could I do something like that? Is he all right?",
        "Parker: Well, when he came by here afterwards, he seemed okay.",
        "Carly: What did he want?",
        "Parker: I don't know, maybe to check in on you. 'Cause when I came in downstairs, you were passing out on the couch. I was gonna call Dad, but Craig stopped me.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. If Jack ever finds out about this --",
        "Parker: No, no. No one's gonna tell him. The three of us are the only ones who even know that this happened.",
        "Carly: Thank God. Okay. Parker, you don't have to worry about me anymore, because this is a real wake-up call for me. I am never, ever gonna do anything like this again. I swear it. I swear to you.",
        "Parker: Stop it! You keep saying that. It's not true.",
        "Carly: It is! It is true this time, Parker. I swear.",
        "Parker: You're in real, real trouble, Mom, and I'm scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, there.",
        "Meg: Hey. You know, I'd invite you two in, but Paul's inside with Eliza.",
        "Lily: Yeah, Damian told me that you two decided to let him have some visitation with Eliza. How is that going?",
        "Meg: It's tougher than I thought. You know, I'm not gonna leave him alone with her, but I can't bear to be in the same room with him, either. I don't know what to do.",
        "Damian: I think I have the solution. Why don't you just come with me, and leave Lily to keep an eye on Eliza?",
        "Meg: I can't ask you to do that.",
        "Lily: Yes, you can. It's been too long since I've spent any quality time with my niece. I'd love to do it. And as for Paul, I can handle him.",
        "Meg: Well, you know, I'd appreciate that, really, but I really don't feel --",
        "Damian: No buts. Just come with me.",
        "Meg: Um, where?",
        "Damian: It's a surprise. But I promise, if you don't enjoy it, I'll take you right back.",
        "Meg: You promise?",
        "Damian: If you insist. But I hope you won't.",
        "Meg: [Laughs]",
        "Lily: Go for it, Meg. Have some fun for a change.",
        "Meg: Okay. I have my cell phone. So if anything happens --",
        "Lily: Nothing's gonna happen. But if it does, I promise you I will call you.",
        "Meg: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Lily: Have fun.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Paul: Well, look who's up! Where's Meg?",
        "Lily: Off spending the day with Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Yesterday, you wanted to put me in jail. This change of heart is very uncharacteristic, unless there's something in it for you.",
        "Craig: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, Rosanna. I want my money back, and you want to stay out of jail. Now, do we have a deal?",
        "Rosanna: And if we do?",
        "Craig: Then we both get what we want. There is just one small thing I want you to do for me.",
        "Rosanna: Ha! I knew it!",
        "Craig: I just want you to tell Carly that I did something nice for you, despite what she did.",
        "Rosanna: What did she do?",
        "Craig: That information isn't part of the deal. Will you tell her or not?",
        "Rosanna: Um, yeah. Yeah, I'll tell her. I promise.",
        "Craig: Then my work here is done. Oh, now that you're resuscitated, does that mean we can count on you where Carly's concerned, in case she needs some help?",
        "Rosanna: Of course she can.",
        "Craig: Why don't you make sure she knows that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg asked you to guard me, didn't she?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm, she certainly did.",
        "Paul: Okay. I'm okay with that. Trust is earned a little bit at a time, so whatever I have to do to earn it, whatever's necessary.",
        "Lily: Talk is cheap, Paul.",
        "Paul: I know. But I'm willing to jump through whatever hoops she has to spend time with Eliza. My little angel.",
        "Lily: Your little angel that you stole from her mother. Meg's a lot more generous with you than I would have been.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Starting to sense that. Look, Eliza. There's Mr. Bunny. Let's go spend some time with Mr. Bunny and leave Auntie Lily alone.",
        "Lily: [Sighs]",
        "Faith: Mom, there you are.",
        "Lily: Hey. Here I am. Your money for the movie!",
        "Faith: Yeah, you forgot to leave it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, Sweetie, I'm sorry. I got distracted.",
        "Paul: Faith, is that you?",
        "Faith: Paul, hi.",
        "Paul: Oh, my. You have grown. You look really beautiful. You look just like your mom.",
        "Faith: Mom, does Meg know?",
        "Lily: Yes, she knows that Eliza is spending time with her father.",
        "Faith: Why'd you do it, Paul? Why would you take Eliza away from her mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: This time's different. Right.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is. In sort of a sick, twisted way, what happened with Craig is just what I needed to get my life back on track. I don't even want to look at booze. Never again.",
        "Parker: How do you know that you can stick to that?",
        "Carly: Because, Parker, the thought of taking someone's life, it's terrifying. I am never gonna have another drink.",
        "Parker: Aren't you gonna need some help?",
        "Carly: No. Parker, I told you, I'm done. It's over. And what I need now is a long, hot shower, and some time to process all of this.",
        "Parker: Well, I'm not so sure I should leave you alone.",
        "Carly: The last thing either one of us needs is for you to babysit me. I'm sure there are a million things you could do with your day that are better than that. Come on. Today is the first day of the rest of our lives, remember? Go out there and enjoy it.",
        "Parker: Only if you're sure you're gonna be okay.",
        "Carly: Yes, I'm sure. Go.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Hey. Hi.",
        "Rosanna: You look terrible.",
        "Carly: I do. Probably better than I feel, though.",
        "Rosanna: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I think I'm just -- I'm coming down with something, that's all. How are you? I've been terrified that Craig was gonna press charges against you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, obviously, he didn't, or I wouldn't be here. I'm not really sure why.",
        "Carly: Well, who cares, really? As long as he decided not to, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Yeah, he said as long as I gave the money back and promised to do him a favor.",
        "Carly: What kind of favor?",
        "Rosanna: He made me promise to tell you that he had done something nice for me, despite what you did. What'd you do, Carly?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I guess -- I guess I convinced him that it was the right thing to do, leave you alone.",
        "Rosanna: That makes you a pretty persuasive woman, doesn't it? So what'd you do to convince him?",
        "Carly: I'm not sure.",
        "Rosanna: Really? You're sure it didn't have anything to do with you getting in a car and trying to run him down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Wow. Damian, this boat is gorgeous.",
        "Damian: She's a beauty. I guess that makes two of you.",
        "Meg: You know, we really lucked out on weather. It's a great day to go sailing.",
        "Damian: It's a great day for a picnic as well.",
        "Meg: We're going on a picnic?",
        "Damian: Did you think I was going to starve you?",
        "Meg: [Laughs]",
        "Damian: I have a basket full of delicious food, and there's an island nearby where we're gonna enjoy it.",
        "Meg: An island? Really?",
        "Damian: With a beautiful, private beach. You like to swim?",
        "Meg: I do, but you didn't give me enough time to pack a swimsuit, so I don't plan on going --",
        "Damian: Now, didn't I tell you I took care of everything? There is a swimsuit in here, and there's a place we can change down below deck. Unless, of course, you decide you'd prefer to go without, and I wouldn't object to that.",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm. Very funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you actually accusing me of trying to run Craig down with my car? Do you really think that I'm capable of doing something like that?",
        "Rosanna: You're not answering my question.",
        "Carly: Because I'm insulted by it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then answer it, and I'll apologize.",
        "Carly: It's true. But it wasn't intentional, Rosanna. It was just a horrible, awful accident.",
        "Rosanna: Really? How did this accident happen?",
        "Carly: The important thing is that it got Craig to change his mind, and to not press charges against you.",
        "Rosanna: No, Sweetheart, the important thing is that you could have killed him. Not that it would have been such a great loss, but you don't even seem sorry.",
        "Carly: I am sorry! Of course I am. I'm not sorry that my sister isn't going to jail for getting her own money back. Is Craig all right?",
        "Rosanna: He had a bit of a limp when he came by Fairwinds, but that's all I could tell. That and he seemed a bit less Craig-like than usual.",
        "Carly: What does that mean?",
        "Rosanna: Well, he had me over a barrel, but he didn't gloat or twist the knife. Strange.",
        "Carly: So, aside from this little change in personality, he was fine?",
        "Rosanna: If it's true that only the good die young, Craig Montgomery will live to a ripe old age.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. Oh, thank God. Good. I need some coffee. Would you like some coffee?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, yeah. Definitely.",
        "Carly: The milk's in the fridge. Would you get it?",
        "Rosanna: Sure. Oh, Sweetie! Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa! Let me do that. You're gonna burn yourself.",
        "Carly: I'm fine. It's probably just this bug that I have.",
        "Rosanna: You're shaking. Carly. What is wrong with you? What is going on with you? Really.",
        "Carly: It's just stress. Things have been pretty rough for me for a while now.",
        "Rosanna: I'm here for you. You know that.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I do. Ever since Jack married Janet, I feel like my life is slipping away.",
        "Rosanna: I can't believe that the two of you broke up. I just -- I just never thought that would happen.",
        "Carly: I didn't, either. I thought no matter what happened, no matter how I tried to push him away, Jack would always come back. He didn't this time. And he's not going to.",
        "Rosanna: Look, why don't you tell me about this Janet person. How much should I hate her?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] You know, she won't ever love Jack as much as I did. But she'll probably make him a much better wife than I ever did.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't you say that!",
        "Carly: It's true. I'm just giving credit where credit is grudgingly due.",
        "Rosanna: How are the kids? Come on, I haven't even seen them since I got back.",
        "Carly: You wouldn't believe Sage. She's the most beautiful thing in the world. And about a foot taller, probably, than the last time you saw her. And she acts so grown-up. I can hardly stand it.",
        "Rosanna: And Parker?",
        "Carly: Parker. It's hard to believe he's the same boy. You don't want to hear about this.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I do. I want to hear all about it. Carly, you need somebody to talk to.",
        "Carly: Parker thought that Jack and I were controlling his life, so he, unbelievably, got married.",
        "Rosanna: He got married?",
        "Carly: Yes. And then he petitioned the court to become an emancipated minor.",
        "Rosanna: Why would he do something like that?",
        "Carly: To get access to the trust fund that you set up for him.",
        "Rosanna: That trust fund was for his future. I hope you made that clear to him.",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, I did. As much as I could. But in the end, that was the responsibility of the trustee that he chose for himself.",
        "Rosanna: I still cannot believe that Craig is Parker's trustee. How did that go over with Jack?",
        "Carly: About as well as you'd expect. When Parker's marriage ultimately and finally was annulled, Parker just gave up on everything. He quit school and gave up.",
        "Rosanna: I'm so sorry.",
        "Carly: You have nothing to be sorry for.",
        "Rosanna: I do. I think that trust fund that I gave Parker was the worst thing that I could have ever done for your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You look right at home.",
        "Damian: So do you.",
        "Meg: It's been a while since I wore one of these. Before Eliza.",
        "Damian: Well, if anything, being a mother has made you even more beautiful.",
        "Meg: You know, this fit surprisingly well.",
        "Damian: Well, I'm famous for my powers of observation.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] Oh.",
        "Damian: It'll be a while before we get to the island. Why don't you lay down and get some sun?",
        "Meg: I feel like I should be doing something.",
        "Damian: Your only job for the next few hours is to relax, which you are completely failing to do so. Unless you start enjoying yourself, Meg, I'll have no choice but to throw you overboard.",
        "Meg: Really? That seems a little harsh.",
        "Damian: You're disobeying the captain's orders. The law of the sea.",
        "Meg: Okay. The sun is quite nice, and the rocking of the boat, it's very soothing.",
        "Damian: Even more when you close your eyes. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, Faith, but taking Eliza away from her mom was the biggest.",
        "Faith: So why'd you do it?",
        "Paul: I don't know. My feelings were hurt. I wasn't thinking clearly. I'd never do anything like it again. I'd never hurt Eliza.",
        "Faith: That's what I thought. When everyone was so scared that Eliza was with you, I wasn't.",
        "Lily: Why was that?",
        "Faith: Because Paul was really nice to me when I was younger, and he was great to Parker, too.",
        "Paul: Well, thank you. It's nice someone has fond memories of me.",
        "Lily: I bet your friends are waiting for you. Have a great time.",
        "Faith: I will.",
        "Lily: See you, Sweetie.",
        "Paul: See you. I would be so proud if Eliza turned out anything like your daughter.",
        "Lily: Because of Meg, you may have a chance to do that. So don't blow it, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Perfect place and a perfect day.",
        "Damian: You think this is perfect? Wait until you see the lunch I got us from the Lakeview.",
        "Meg: Oh, you know, I have been living on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that I throw together as soon as Eliza falls asleep.",
        "Damian: Well, then you're in for a treat.",
        "Meg: P\u00e2t\u00e9! How did you know I love p\u00e2t\u00e9?",
        "Damian: I'm a Grimaldi. I've got my sources.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] And champagne? Wow. You know, you are spoiling me.",
        "Damian: Oh, no, I'm pampering you. \"Spoiling\" makes it sound like a bad thing. I'm giving you a few simple luxuries. That can never be a bad thing.",
        "Meg: I like it. Thank you very much. Oh, perfect. Okay.",
        "Damian: The perfect day with the perfect companion.",
        "Meg: I'll certainly drink to that. Let's eat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: None of this is your fault, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, it is. If I hadn't set up this big trust fund for Parker, he never would have felt the need to get emancipated, and then Craig wouldn't have had the opportunity to worm his way into your life.",
        "Carly: No, I let Craig into my life. I did that on my own. But sometimes, I don't even know how it happened. There was a time I hated him so much for what he did to Gwen and to you that I couldn't even look at him. And Jack left. And I was alone. Craig was good to me. He loaned me money. He made me his business partner.",
        "Rosanna: Did you guys, um -- wow. Okay. Okay.",
        "Carly: I know it was wrong.",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "Carly: I didn't mean to betray you.",
        "Rosanna: No, you didn't. You didn't. Okay, this is not about me. If there's one thing that I know about you, it's that you will hurt yourself 10 times worse than anybody else.",
        "Carly: But I did hurt you, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, but the good thing is that we know how to forgive each other, right?",
        "Carly: Thank God.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Yes. It's a very good thing. And something that I want you to know that I have been promising myself is that I'm just going to leave all the hurts of the past in the past. Think you can do that, too? Want to try?",
        "Carly: I wish I could.",
        "Rosanna: Wish? Do it. And if you need to talk to somebody, I need you to call me. And if you feel like you have a problem, I want you to call me. And if you feel the need to stick pins in a voodoo doll that looks strangely like Jack's new wife, then I definitely want you to call me, okay?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] I will.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Rosanna: Good. All right. I love you. Now, I've got to get going. I hate to say that, but I got to return that money before Craig changes his mind, right? Now, you. I want you to take care of yourself. Get some sleep. You've got to get over that bug.",
        "Carly: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. All right. And maybe we'll have lunch soon, okay? You know, you're gonna have to buy, though, 'cause I'm broke.",
        "Carly: As long as it's tuna from a can, I'm in.",
        "Rosanna: Excellent. Love it. Come here. Okay, see you later.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "[Rosanna leaves]",
        "[Carly takes the bottle of vodka out of the cabinet and pours a drink]",
        "Carly: Just to steady my hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Damian, thank you so much. This has been one of the best dates I've had in a long time.",
        "Damian: It's not over yet.",
        "Meg: I'm afraid it is. I should be heading back.",
        "Damian: There's still some p\u00e2t\u00e9 left, and you haven't lived until you've seen a sunset from this particular island.",
        "Meg: You know what, I would love to stay and finish eating this p\u00e2t\u00e9 while watching this beautiful sunset.",
        "Damian: Are you worried about Eliza? Who is, I am perfectly sure, having her own wonderful day with Aunt Lily.",
        "Meg: You think I'm crazy, don't you?",
        "Damian: I think you're being a mother.",
        "Meg: Isn't this where we left the dinghy?",
        "Damian: This is where I tied it up. The knot must have come undone. It's gone.",
        "Meg: So what are we supposed to do now?",
        "Damian: Well, we could swim out to the boat, but the current is too strong, I'm afraid.",
        "Meg: So are you saying we're stuck on this island?",
        "Damian: Enticing thought, but no. No good sailor ever leaves his vessel without one of these. I'm gonna call the coast guard and ask them to send us a boat to pick us up.",
        "Meg: You know, for a minute there, I thought you had planned this whole thing.",
        "Damian: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Damian: I could never do that to you, Meg. Especially knowing that you'd be too worried about Eliza to enjoy it. Coast guard, come in, please. In need of assistance. Over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I saw Paul today.",
        "Parker: Now, there's a master in ticking people off.",
        "Faith: Yeah. Everybody talks about how crazy he is, but when I saw him today, he was just Paul. He was nice. It made me think about when we used to hang out in the woods with him.",
        "Parker: Seems like ages ago.",
        "Faith: Yeah, there was some scary stuff going on back then, but it was fun, right?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I guess.",
        "Faith: Remember how bad we thought our lives were?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I know. It was nothing compared to my life now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What is happening to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: The coast guard is sending a boat to pick us up, but it'll be a while before they get here.",
        "Meg: Lily probably expected us back by now. She must be worried.",
        "Damian: Which is why I gave the coast guard her number and asked them to call and let her know what happened.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] Wow, it sounds like you thought of everything.",
        "Damian: Yeah, except tying up the dinghy more carefully.",
        "Meg: Ah, accidents happen, even to Damian Grimaldi. [Laughs] Feels like the breeze is picking up.",
        "Damian: Yeah, getting colder. Better now?",
        "Meg: [Chuckles] Much. Are you sure you didn't plan all this on purpose?",
        "Damian: I promise I didn't. But it couldn't have worked out better if I had, don't you think? And I have to confess, I am not unhappy about this opportunity the fates have handed us. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Craig: Who is it? If you're housekeeping, you've lost your tip.",
        "Craig: Come on in. What can I do for you?",
        "Carly: You're limping.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh.",
        "Carly: Did I do that?",
        "Craig: Well, not so much you as it was your car.",
        "Carly: Oh, God. Oh, God, Craig, I am so sorry for what I did.",
        "Craig: Yeah, don't be. You weren't yourself at the time.",
        "Carly: No, I wasn't. You know, I didn't even remember what happened until Parker reminded me when I woke up this morning. I think that's what they call a blackout.",
        "Craig: Have you had one before.",
        "Carly: This was the first time. I think. Oh, God, I don't even know.",
        "Craig: All right, just take it easy. If you've had a blackout more than once, I think you'd remember that.",
        "Carly: You know, what I don't understand is how I tried to hit you with my car and got away with it.",
        "Craig: Well, that's because I made Parker take you home as quickly as he could so we wouldn't have any witnesses.",
        "Carly: So I tried to run you over, and you were thinking of me.",
        "Craig: I just couldn't see you waking up in jail.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you for that. And for deciding not to press charges against Rosanna.",
        "Craig: Well, a little self-interest there. I just didn't want to give you another excuse to try to kill me.",
        "Carly: Don't do that. Don't dismiss what you've done for me like it's nothing. You came through for me, Craig, again. Even though you were right and you accused me of using you, and even though you'd be perfectly justified in having me thrown in jail, you stayed my friend.",
        "Craig: I always will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Damian, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate everything you've done for me.",
        "Damian: But you don't want me to get the wrong idea.",
        "Meg: Well, it's not completely wrong idea. I mean, I'm not blind. I know something's been going on between us.",
        "Damian: But it's too soon after Dusty. Look, the last thing I want is to push you into something you're not ready for.",
        "Meg: Dusty's only part of it. I want to get control over my life again before I'm able to share it with anybody else. And I don't know exactly what you're looking for. But --",
        "Damian: The only thing I'm looking for is a chance to make you happy. Now, I hope I was able to do that this afternoon.",
        "Meg: Well, that depends on whether you'll be able to take me home in time for me to give Eliza her dinner. [Laughs]",
        "Damian: If I'm not mistaken, that's the coast guard.",
        "Meg: Well, in that case, you have made me very happy. Thank you for today, Damian. And for understanding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Parker?",
        "Parker: Aunt Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: [Laughs] Oh, my gosh, look at you! You're huge!",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you just think that 'cause you're so short.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, very funny! I'm so happy to see you.",
        "Parker: I'm happy to see you, too. And you're all better now? You're not gonna get sick again?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I certainly hope not.",
        "Parker: Okay, good, 'cause we missed you. I mean, my mom especially.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I missed her, too. You know, I just came from having a long talk with her.",
        "Parker: Oh? What'd she tell you?",
        "Rosanna: She told me that you've been quite a handful, young man.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you didn't come back just to yell at me, did you?",
        "Rosanna: Aw, I'm not gonna yell at you, I promise. I just can't promise not to worry about you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, I'm fine. My mom's the one you need to worry about.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I know things have been tough for her lately, but is there something going on that I should know about?",
        "Parker: How would I know? I'm just glad that you're better. And now that you're home, hopefully, things can get back to normal around here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What about Rosanna? Haven't you talked to her?",
        "Carly: I've tried. But she's already worried about me, and she's been through so much herself.",
        "Craig: She's your sister. She loves you and she wants to help you.",
        "Carly: I know. But I can't tell her everything. I can't tell her what a train wreck my life has become. And you know, the worst thing is even after the D.U.I., even after what I've done to you, the thing I want more than anything in the world is a drink.",
        "Craig: All right, think -- think about something else, anything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So, tell me what happened.",
        "Damian: It was a stupid mistake on my part. I just forgot to fasten the dinghy properly, and it drifted away. I swear. But the coast guard picked us up and brought us back to the boat, so no harm done.",
        "Lily: The Damian I used to know would have turned that accident into a romantic night or two.",
        "Damian: Well, then, maybe now you'll accept that I'm a changed man in more ways than one.",
        "Meg: She was asleep before her head even hit the pillow. Thank you again for watching her.",
        "Lily: She was a love. I'll do it anytime for you.",
        "Meg: How was Paul?",
        "Lily: He played with Eliza, and then he left.",
        "Meg: He didn't give you any trouble?",
        "Lily: Not a bit. You know what, this limited visitation might end up working for you, Meg.",
        "Meg: I hope so. You know, maybe if he is willing to accept my conditions, maybe he's also willing to be a good father to Eliza.",
        "Lily: And how was your day?",
        "Meg: Wonderful. Thank you.",
        "Damian: No, thank you. I hope we get to do it again very soon.",
        "Meg: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: There you are.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: You were off early this morning.",
        "Paul: Oh, well, I went to the farm.",
        "Rosanna: Was that wise?",
        "Paul: Well, I got to spend some time with my little girl, so I don't know -- you tell me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, good for you. I'm happy for you. Listen, I've got some good news, too. While you were gone, Craig dropped by.",
        "Paul: Oh, and I missed his visit. That is good news.",
        "Rosanna: [Laughs] No, he's decided not to press charges as long as the money is returned.",
        "Paul: Okay. Rosanna, look, the money is rightfully yours, to do with as you see fit. You do whatever you want with it, including giving it back to Craig, if that's what you want.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: You're welcome. I just spent so much time with my little girl, really, retribution is the furthest thing from my mind.",
        "Rosanna: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Paul: [Chuckles] I don't know. This whole \"Living without a chip on my shoulder\" thing is gonna take some getting used to, but I think I have you to thank for it.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, you've done all this yourself.",
        "Paul: Well, you helped. Seeing how you choose to live your life these days.",
        "Rosanna: It's worth it for what I get in return.",
        "Paul: Which is?",
        "Rosanna: Peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You have to know how much I want you right now.",
        "Carly: I want you, too.",
        "Craig: Are you sure? 'Cause the last thing I want to do is take advantage.",
        "Carly: [Chuckles] Oh, you make me feel so special.",
        "Craig: You are. You are. Don't ever doubt that. You should know that if you choose to walk out that door right now, I'm still on your side.",
