        "Lily: To family.",
        "Sierra: I am so glad we took time to do this.",
        "Lily: I know, it's been too long since we had our mother-daughter lunches.",
        "Lucinda: Especially when our family's had so much to be grateful for. To Lily.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Lucinda: To Lily's rescue by her heroic husband.",
        "Sierra: Cheers.",
        "Lily: Yes, to Holden. And also to Keith for carrying me out of that burning house.",
        "Sierra: To Keith.",
        "Lily: To Keith.",
        "Lucinda: But, if there wasn't a Keith, you wouldn't have been in a burning house.",
        "Sierra: Well, how about we order some dessert?",
        "Lily: Let's just review for a moment. Keith did not set the fire. Les Sweeny did. Remember that?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, yes. In revenge against Keith.",
        "Sierra: Okay, okay, okay. It's the past. Can we just drop it?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. I'd be happy to drop it.",
        "Lily: Me, too.",
        "Lucinda: If Lily will drop Keith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Holden? Holden, is that you? Whoever you are, you better run, because I'm calling the police.",
        "Meg: That would be a mistake.",
        "Emma: You're back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Katie: Come in.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Katie: Hi. Thanks for coming. Oh, could you hand me that insect repellent over there?",
        "Alison: What's going on?",
        "Katie: I am leaving.",
        "Alison: Forever?",
        "Katie: No, just for a little while. A spot just opened up on one of those back-to-basic adventure trips. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Isn't that one of those deals where you climb mountains and shoot rapids?",
        "Katie: Well, I am managing the gym without Henry now. I need to toughen up a little bit.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, do you want me to help out at the gym while you're gone?",
        "Katie: No, that's taken care of. But, can you watch Snickers?",
        "Alison: Sure, I love the bunny. Katie --",
        "Katie: Can you hand me that poison ivy stuff, too, please?",
        "Alison: Are you sure this outdoor thing is what you need right now?",
        "Katie: Yes. My life is a mess. I need to \"push myself out of my own box with life-altering challenges.\"",
        "Alison: Or you could die trying. Maybe you should rethink this.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Alison: Katie, you're going off to a place where they make you sleep on the ground and eat jerky.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it'll be good for me.",
        "Alison: No, it won't. Because when you get back, you'll be sunburned, bee- stung and itchy. And you'll still be lonely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I am not lonely.",
        "Mike: Stop it. You are miserable without Katie.",
        "Henry: So?",
        "Mike: I can help you.",
        "Henry: You can help? You, Mike Kasnoff, the love of Katie's life, are going to help save her marriage to me?",
        "Mike: That's right.",
        "Henry: Mike, you can't be part of the solution if you are the problem, okay?",
        "Mike: Henry, I'm married now.",
        "Henry: That is a change in status, my friend. It doesn't change her feelings towards you.",
        "Mike: No, you did that. She loves you.",
        "Henry: I'm not -- no. I'm not even gonna go down this road, okay? Because Katie and I are finished, and we are at peace with that. Now, if you excuse me, my date is waiting.",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: That's your date?",
        "Henry: Yeah. What's wrong with her?",
        "Mike: Oh, nothing, nothing. But, if you picked her because you think you're over your wife, you're in bigger trouble than I thought you were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You're pregnant?",
        "Celia: Will, did you know this?",
        "Gwen: There's nothing to know. It's not true.",
        "Celia: But these pamphlets --",
        "Gwen: They're for a friend, okay? I got them for a friend.",
        "Celia: Which friend?",
        "Casey: Celia, God, ease off. If one of her friends is pregnant, it's none of our business.",
        "Celia: I guess you're right. But why was Will so worried about you?",
        "Will: Celia.",
        "Gwen: Will, what did you tell her?",
        "Will: Nothing.",
        "Celia: What is there to tell? Why are the two of you lying?",
        "Casey: Celia, come on. Saying that Gwen's lying about being pregnant. That's like --",
        "Gwen: That's like saying what? Saying that I sleep around with a lot of people? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Will: Nobody's saying that, Gwen. Nobody's saying that.",
        "Casey: I wasn't trying to -- just, whatever. Can we just leave?",
        "Celia: I thought we were friends. Why won't you tell me the truth?",
        "Gwen: I told you the truth. Those -- those pamphlets, they're for somebody else, okay?",
        "Celia: If you think I'm gonna judge you, you're wrong. I'd never do that.",
        "Gwen: I know. I know, okay?",
        "Casey: Oh, man.",
        "Celia: What are they?",
        "Gwen: Put those --",
        "Celia: Prenatal vitamins? They're yours.",
        "Gwen: Why couldn't you guys just let it go?",
        "Celia: Hey, it'll be okay. I promise, we'll help you.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not gonna be okay. You can't fix this for me, Celia, like some prom dress, okay? I'm pregnant, all right? Okay? I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Oh, what's the big secret? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I could have --",
        "Meg: No, you would have gone to a lot of unnecessary work. And besides, when do daughters have to tell their mothers that they're coming into town to visit?",
        "Emma: When their mothers haven't seen their daughters in so long that they don't even know how long ago it was. Oh, what does it matter? What does it matter? My little girl Meg is home. Are you all right, now? You're not, you're sick? I mean, is Josh --?",
        "Meg: No, no, no. No, no, everybody's fine. Everybody's fine. I just felt like getting away, visiting the farm.",
        "Emma: Why?",
        "Meg: You're my family.",
        "Emma: Well, it seems like there were a lot of family things that happened, like marriages and births, a few funerals, that you didn't make it home here for. I'm just wondering, you know, why -- why are you suddenly popping in to see me right now?",
        "Meg: Mama, are you gonna spend this whole visit asking me why I came? Because if you are, I might as well leave right now.",
        "Emma: Well, you wanna clean up the mess you made in my kitchen before you go?",
        "Meg: Okay, I couldn't help myself. I walked in, and it smelled like ginger cookies.",
        "Emma: Yes, because I made some this morning.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I had quite a few. And then I decided to have some of your homemade applesauce, but I couldn't find it.",
        "Emma: That's because there isn't any. Because Holden's children eat it as soon as I make it.",
        "Meg: Oh, my gosh. Holden. I -- I read about the fire at his and Lily's house on my way in. Are they okay?",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank God.",
        "Meg: Oh. So, are they staying here with you 'til their house is back in shape?",
        "Emma: Well, everybody's in and out, as usual. Well, now, you're not thinking of staying at a hotel?",
        "Meg: Well, if you don't have the room, I'm fine.",
        "Emma: Well, this is your home! You're gonna stay here! This is your home! There's always room for you! Always. Always room for you.",
        "Meg: I missed you so much.",
        "Emma: Meg --",
        "Meg: So, how is everybody? Are Lily and Holden still the gold standarfotar marriage?",
        "Emma: You know something? I think right now, I'd like to hear about your marriage. Hmm?",
        "Meg: Oh, my gosh. Is this little Luke?",
        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "Meg: He is so grown up. Oh, oh, do you have any recent pictures of the girls?",
        "Emma: Well, there's some upstairs in my room.",
        "Meg: In your room? I'll get them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: That Keith didn't actually kill his own sister is definitely a plus, darling.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you.",
        "Lucinda: That doesn't make him not trouble. He's trouble with a capital \"T.\"",
        "Lily: Let's go back again. Keith saved my life. He saved your life. He's been wonderful to the children. Faith, as you know, adores him. Where is the threat?",
        "Lucinda: It will show itself in time. And if you were not rushing headlong into divorce, --",
        "Lily: No, Holden is the one that filed the divorce papers before me.",
        "Lucinda: A little time, dear? A little patience?",
        "Lily: You know, Mother?",
        "Lucinda: A little self-control, dear?",
        "Lily: Mother?",
        "Sierra: Mother, have you seen the spa-line product display that my creative team put in the lobby?",
        "Lucinda: No, I haven't.",
        "Sierra: Would you do me a favor? I would love to get your feedback before I go plunging on ahead with it.",
        "Lucinda: All right. I'd love to look at it. After lunch.",
        "Sierra: Well, could you check it out now?",
        "Lucinda: Now? I'm having a talk with Lily. Of course not.",
        "Sierra: Yeah, I know. I know you are. But, you know, I really could use your feedback so I can make that decision today.",
        "Lucinda: She's playing peacemaker.",
        "Sierra: No, I'm just merely multitasking.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, all right. To be continued.",
        "Lily: Oh, really? Great. Can't wait. Thank you. Thank you. If I had heard one more negative word about Keith, -- ugh!",
        "Sierra: You were gonna blow?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I just -- I need to just tell her to butt out of my life, or i would kick her out. But, I'm glad that you're on my side. Thank you.",
        "Sierra: But, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Excuse us. She is living proof that you are not ready to walk away from your wife.",
        "Henry: Watch me, Mike.",
        "Mike: Henry, she looks exactly like Katie.",
        "Henry: There may be a passing resemblance, yes. But just because Sadie has blonde hair and big eyes, does not make --",
        "Mike: Sadie? Oh, well, what does that rhyme with? Let me think. Next thing you know, you're gonna tell me she's got a pet rabbit, too. [Gasps] I don't believe it. Katie has snickers and Sadie has -- what? Giggles?",
        "Henry: That is where the similarities end, okay? I think that Sadie could be a special person for me. She is warm, she is charming, she is witty. She likes long walks on the beach.",
        "Mike: Sounds like a personal ad. Where did you meet her?",
        "Henry: Online.",
        "Mike: Oh, come on!",
        "Henry: There are -- there are very meaningful relationships that could be made through the worldwide web, Mike.",
        "Mike: So, you saw a picture of her, and thought that she looked like your wife, so you picked her?",
        "Henry: No, I looked beyond the photo. Her profile told me that we could be kindred spirits.",
        "Mike: Uh-huh. How many beaches have you walked along lately?",
        "Henry: That's it, that's it, okay? My date is waiting. Sorry about that.",
        "Sadie: So, who's that guy you were talking to?",
        "Henry: A friend. Why do you ask?",
        "Sadie: Oh, just wondering. Ah.",
        "Henry: Do you, uh, do you find him attractive?",
        "Sadie: Not particularly. I like 'em tall and blond. Kinda like you.",
        "Henry: You're lovely. You're incredible. This calls for a celebratory martini, it really does.",
        "Sadie: Oh, I ordered you this beer.",
        "[Sadie giggles]",
        "Henry: That's great, 'cause I love beer.",
        "Sadie: Yeah, baby! Let's chug 'em. I bet you I can beat ya.",
        "Henry: Okay. I -- I bet you can. You go ahead and do it first. Whoo, pretty close.",
        "Sadie: It's a sure thing, honey.",
        "Henry: Yeah, tell you what, after drinks, what do you say we go out to this nice little jazz club I know.",
        "Sadie: Jazz?",
        "Henry: Not really jazz. It's more -- it's this adorable little piano bar, and they do these standards. You know, old standards. And the audience gets to get up there and sing along with them. It's really great.",
        "Sadie: Cool, yeah. You know, and then after that, why don't we, like, head over to the elderly home, the nursing home, and play some canastas.",
        "Henry: Okay. [Sadie laughs] All righty, then. What do you suggest?",
        "Sadie: I'm kind of hungry.",
        "Henry: Great, I'm starving. What do you say to French, Italian, maybe some sushi?",
        "Sadie: I was thinking Mabel's red hots. Their dogs are, like, to die for. And they've got the best beer this side of Milwaukee.",
        "[Sadie laughs]",
        "Henry: Good. I love a good dog.",
        "Sadie: Cool. Oh, maybe I could invite some of my biker buddies to join us there.",
        "Henry: Biker buddies?",
        "Sadie: I know. It sounds a little funky, but once you get past the leather collars and the facial hair, they're really just a bunch of teddy bears.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Sadie: I normally wouldn't, you know, have them horn in on our date or anything, but today is Pit Bull's birthday. I know, I know.",
        "Henry: And me without a present. Goodness, what do you get a leather-wearing teddy bear named Pit Bull?",
        "Sadie: Oh. I'm so sorry. You're a riot.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Sadie: I'm gonna go call my friends. They're gonna love you.",
        "Henry: Great.",
        "Mike: You ready to surrender?",
        "Henry: Why don't you back off, Kasnoff, you're messing up my mojo.",
        "Mike: Oh, come on, who are you kidding? Sadie may look like Katie, but she is no more your type than I am.",
        "Henry: Well, maybe I've decided to embrace the anti-Katie, all right? So what if she prefers beer to martinis, or snorts when she laughs or has a penchant for hairy men who wear leather?",
        "Mike: If you tell me that opposites attract --",
        "Henry: Well, maybe they do. And really, Mike, who needs to be happy when you can be --",
        "Mike: Safe.",
        "Henry: Safe. Safe is good. Not being a doormat is good.",
        "Mike: But you're just being stubborn.",
        "Sadie: Sadie.",
        "Mike: Mikey.",
        "Sadie: Cool. Cool. Good to meet you. So?",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Sadie: The gang is on for meeting us at Mabel's.",
        "Henry: Great. I should -- you know what I should do? I should really change my shirt.",
        "Sadie: Oh, honey, don't sweat that. You are gonna get a lot dirtier before the night's out. Yeah, the guys wanna, you know, take the bikes down to the swamp later, get a little mud on our tires.",
        "[All laugh]",
        "Henry: Whoa, yeah. Well, you know, I --",
        "[Henry clears throat]",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, what do you want me to tell them about that call you got from work?",
        "Henry: Oh, the call.",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I got this call. Someone's sick at work and they need me to fill in.",
        "Sadie: Aw, man. Pit Bull was totally looking forward to meeting you.",
        "Henry: I can't tell you how disappointed I am.",
        "Sadie: Well, you have my number.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Sadie: Call me sometime.",

        "Sadie: Okay.",

        "Katie: My husband's gone, Mike is just pretending to be my friend and I've alienated my own brother. There's really no reason not to go, except for snickers. And, well, when a rabbit is the only male in your life who's not running for the hills, it's time to do a little running yourself. Just for a little while, at least.",
        "Alison: Even if all your problems will still be waiting for you when you get back?",
        "Katie: That will be then. Right now, I can't just sit around thinking about Henry 24/7.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, it'll be nice having Snickers for company after all these weeks with Aaron gone. And let me know how this back-to-basics adventure thing goes.",

        "Katie: It's Henry.",
        "Alison: Pick it up.",
        "Katie: He's probably just calling to tell me to take his name off our lottery subscription or something.",
        "Alison: Katie, answer it.",
        "Katie: What if he wants the rest of his martini collection back? I can't handle another hit before I leave.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Henry: I don't think this is such a good idea.",
        "Mike: Don't you hang that phone up. Listen, you leave her a message and call her cell phone.",

        "Katie: Yes?",
        "Henry: I was thinking about meeting you at the Lakeshore hotel in Chicago.",
        "Katie: All right. Wait. Wait a second. Did you just ask me to meet you at a hotel in Chicago?",
        "Henry: Can't do it, huh?",
        "Katie: No, yes, of course, I can. Yes. Absolutely. When?",
        "Henry: As soon as you can make it there.",
        "Katie: Okay. Henry just asked me to meet him in a hotel.",
        "Alison: That's great.",
        "Katie: I know. Is it? It is, isn't it? I mean, if he didn't wanna work things out, we'd be meeting in a lawyer's office.",
        "Alison: Well, at least you're already packed.",
        "Katie: Are you kidding? No, no, no, no. I'm not taking this stuff. For a trip like this, I'm bringing out the big guns.",

        "Henry: Yes.",

        "Lily: Right. What's the alternative?",
        "Sierra: You could agree with her.",
        "Lily: Agree to stop seeing Keith?",
        "Sierra: No, no, no, no. You just agree with that, you know, maybe you could leave things open with Holden. You agree that maybe things are moving too fast with Keith. And, well, you agree that maybe she has more experience in these things than you do.",
        "Lily: And what do I do when Keith comes back from his trip?",
        "Sierra: Do whatever you like.",
        "Lily: But she's wrong.",
        "Sierra: But she's your mother. And she says these things to you because she loves you. You know, you were thrown in jail because of Keith and his sister. You nearly died. You know, that was all very hard on her.",
        "Lily: I just don't know if I could lie to her.",
        "Sierra: Then why don't you try telling her the truth in a kind way.",
        "Lucinda: Well, are you girls finished bashing your mother?",
        "Sierra: What did you think of that display?",
        "Lucinda: Not much. [Sierra laughs] You should showcase the product at the entrance to the locker room so that the patrons will be more likely to buy. Now, come on, you know that.",
        "Sierra: Well, I will definitely keep that in mind. If you'll excuse me, I need to make a phone call.",
        "Lucinda: She's not going to change it. No, I know her. She just says what she thinks I want to hear.",

        "Celia: If you and Casey wanna leave, go ahead. But Gwen is scared and pregnant, and I'm not going anywhere until I figure out a way to help her. Please. Tell me who the father is. Some old boyfriend? What did he say when you told him?",
        "Gwen: I didn't tell him.",
        "Celia: But you have to. He has a right to know.",
        "Gwen: I tried a couple times, but he kept avoiding me.",
        "Celia: He has to help you and the baby, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: He would. I know he would.",
        "Celia: So, he's a nice guy? Then tell him, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I can't.",
        "Celia: Think of your baby. Right now, all she has is you. And that's great. But doesn't he deserve a father? And aunts and uncles? And grandparents? Give your baby all that. So, who is he? Who's the father?",
        "Gwen: Promise you won't hate me.",
        "Celia: How could I?",
        "Casey: If she doesn't want to tell --",
        "Gwen: No, Casey, I'm sorry, but it's time, okay? It's past time. Celia, the father is --",
        "Will: Me. I'm the father.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Casey: Just tell me the truth, all right? Is the baby really Will's or is it mine?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What are you doing?",
        "Will: What I should have done before. Gwen's was just trying to protect me, but it's true, I'm the father.",
        "Celia: You slept with her?",
        "Gwen: You don't have to do this.",
        "Will: It's true.",

        "Will: Believe it.",
        "Celia: But when? When did this happen?",
        "Will: Do you remember that night we all went to Al's and then Gwen and I left and we went to Metro and --",
        "Celia: But you didn't even know her.",
        "Gwen: Stop this.",
        "Will: We never meant for it to go beyond one night, okay? We didn't want to hurt any other innocent people. Right?",
        "Gwen: No, this isn't Will's fault.",
        "Celia: Is that why you were at the hospital with Gwen? And this morning?",
        "Will: Yeah, like I said, it's my responsibility, too.",
        "Gwen: He was just trying to get me to take care of myself.",
        "Celia: I have to go back to work.",

        "Meg: So this is Jack's wife, Carly, right?",
        "Emma: Yes. Yes, that's right. Mm-hmm.",
        "Meg: So what is she like?",
        "Emma: Well, you know, actually, she's a little bit like you.",
        "Meg: How should I take that?",
        "Emma: Well, she's very brave. She's very ambitious. And she loves very deeply.",
        "Meg: That's how you see me?",
        "Emma: Yes. Which is why I'm wondering why you haven't told me anything about Josh?",
        "Meg: What about him?",
        "Emma: Well, he's your husband. I mean, at least he was last time I checked in.",

        "Meg: Oh, I'll get that.",
        "Emma: Just a minute, now. Just a minute. Now you, young lady, are not going to leave this porch until you tell me what brought you here. And tell me what's happening with your husband.",

        "Lucinda: Yes, you can. You can see things from my point of view.",
        "Lily: No, I never said that I was going to --",
        "Lucinda: One of the first things you got to do right off the bat, get Holden back into marriage counseling and get the kinks out the marriage or the kinks back in the marriage. Or whatever --",
        "Lily: Absolutely, no. I'm not going to do that.",
        "Lucinda: And then a phone call. A quick phone call to Keith. Just say, \"don't come back.\"",
        "Lily: Mother, I am not going to do that.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, a wonderful vacation. Someplace where there's water for Luke. And I'll send a nanny along, and you and Holden can stroll along the crescent beach and as your ocean --",
        "Lily: Enough! Stop! I am not getting back with Holden, and I'm not going to kick Keith out of my life.",
        "Lucinda: Well, dear, for a small consideration, I could take care of that bothersome detail for you.",
        "Lily: You leave Keith alone. Got it?",
        "Sierra: Okay, what's happening, ladies?",
        "Lily: Oh -- I gave her an inch, she's taking a mile, as usual.",
        "Lucinda: She can't bear it that I'm always right.",

        "Lily: Oh, I think we've had enough togetherness for one day.",
        "Lucinda: I thought we were having some togetherness.",

        "Lily: Where are we going?",
        "Lucinda: Where?",
        "Sierra: Somewhere where you can both blow off a little steam. Let's go.",
        "Lily: No talk about Holden or Keith?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling, I don't know if I can promise that.",
        "Sierra: Let's go. Come on.",
        "Lucinda: All right. But just for the record -- I'm right.",
        "Lily: Oh! Just give me one good reason -- one good reason, why can't I just give her a little crack in the head?",
        "Sierra: Well, all right. I'm gonna tell you something. Let's just pretend that years have gone by, okay? And Natalie and Faith are just like you. And you're just like her. What would you want them to do?",
        "Lily: Commit me.",
        "Sierra: Lily.",
        "Lily: I guess I'd want them to put up with me.",

        "Katie: I can't believe this. I thought it was over. What if I say something wrong? What if I do something wrong?",
        "Alison: Katie, enough of this. Okay. Pack nothing. When you get there, say nothing. Just kiss him.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but what about --",
        "Alison: Oh, just here. Here's your toothbrush. Go. Go! Go!",

        "Mike: She'll come.",
        "Henry: I told her and I told her that if she really loved me, that the best thing to do was to leave me alone. Now, what if she thinks this is just a test, and that the best way to prove her love is to just keep away?",
        "Mike: Okay. You're thinking about this too much. All right? Katie's married to you. She's coming here because you asked her to.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Mike: She's gonna be here soon, so we need to make it quick.",
        "Henry: Why are you doing this?",
        "Mike: Because if Katie has you, maybe she will stop obsessing about her brother and me and my wife and our baby.",
        "Henry: Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Mike: And I was your best man.",
        "Henry: That was Katie's idea.",

        "Henry: That's -- that's okay. Its okay, it's all right.",
        "Mike: No, no, it's not. It's not. Listen, you're gonna drink first, remember? Okay, do other things next. Talk much, much later. Don't start rehashing your problems the minute she walks in the door.",
        "Henry: Got it. What is this? Nice.",
        "Henry: Wow. Huh. What? What is it?",
        "Katie: Oh, I love you so much. I'm so sorry. I can't do this.",

        "Gwen: I told you to leave.",
        "Casey: Are you okay?",
        "Gwen: I'm pregnant, all right? Getting sick 20 times a day is another thing I have to be real grateful for.",
        "Casey: I found this.",
        "Gwen: Give me that. Will you just go? I'm tired of people being in my apartment, and touching my things, and asking me real stupid questions.",
        "Casey: I've got one more question. Just tell me the truth, all right? Is the baby really Will's, or is it mine?",
        "Gwen: I told you, it has nothing to do with you.",
        "Casey: I want to believe that. I do. I want to believe that. It would be the best day of my life, but Will being the father -- it doesn't make sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Well, I just don't understand. I don't understand how a marriage can be over without any kind of explanation.",
        "Meg: Josh and I drifted apart. It happens.",
        "Emma: Yes, it does happen. But usually something triggers it off.",
        "Meg: What do you want me to say, mama? That my marriage fell apart because I blew it? You know, I knew you would see it that way.",

        "Lucinda: Sierra, my darling, at any moment, any number of women are going to come and rile her up.",
        "Sierra: No, no, no, no. Because I reserved the room. We have it for the entire afternoon.",
        "Lily: We'll be prunes. We'll disintegrate.",
        "Sierra: Well, as long as you're prunes who aren't fighting, now, then I'll be happy. Let's sit down and relax. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Mm, ah. I have no problem about other people calling the shots. [Lily and Sierra laugh] [Lucinda mock laughs] Well, my dears, it's because of me, and what I've given you, and genes, and the nurturing that the two of you are able to determine your own destinies.",
        "Lily: As long as we run every decision by you first, right?",
        "Lucinda: And what's wrong with that?",

        "Lily: Look at you. It's like you're sitting at a desk there, all tied up like that. What are you afraid, someone's gonna come in her and see the nude Lucinda Walsh?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, funny, darling. Very funny. You know I'm not afraid to show a little skin. But I do think, when we're having a serious discussion about your relationship with this Morrissey person, that it behooves me to have a little distance and a little dignity. You two. You're cute, actually. You're both very cute. You're so damn cute. I'm very competitive.",
        "Lily: You want to look a little cute? Maybe you should do a little something here, maybe?",

        "Lucinda: Oh, you want to change that, now? You want to change that? You want to change it? Oh, why not? Let's do this. Let's do that. Oh, let's do something there. Let's do something with those puppies! All right, let's do that.",

        "Celia: Of course I'm upset. A girl you've barely spoken to up until now is carrying your child, and you finally admit it? What do you want, a gold star?",
        "Will: I guess I just want to know that you don't hate me.",
        "Celia: All this time, you've been acting like you didn't even want Gwen around. And now I know why -- because you already got what you want from her.",
        "Will: It takes two people to make a baby, Celia. And I can't figure out why you're showing all this compassion for Gwen, and --",
        "Celia: I thought -- I thought you were one of the good guys. I'm glad I'm with Casey. He's everything you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What doesn't make sense about it, hmm? That I would want Will, or that he would want me?",
        "Casey: You said that -- I thought you hadn't been with a lot of other guys.",
        "Gwen: Well, one is not a lot. But it's just enough to get you off the hook, so be happy, Casey. You can go. You can go enjoy your awesome life with your awesome girlfriend and forget about me.",

        "Gwen: Yeah, don't worry. You're the last person I'd call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: All right, Henry. I got two bottles of champagne, just in case you guys decide to get a little wild. All right, Henry. I'm outta here. Henry?",
