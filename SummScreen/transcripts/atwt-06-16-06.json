        "Katie: You're staying? ",
        "Mike: Of course I am. I was looking for a belt or something. Cause somebody \r\nforgot to pack my suspenders. ",
        "Katie: Ohh -- sorry about that. I know how much you hate dressing up. ",
        "Mike: I'll wear anything for you. Though I may lose the pants. ",
        "Katie: Fine by me. Maybe we should stay inside. ",
        "Mike: Okay. ",
        "Katie: I'm just so happy that you're here. ",
        "Mike: Of course I am. ",
        "Katie: Have some more champagne? ",
        "Mike: Brilliant. ",
        "Katie: This really is the best thing, Mike. Putting as much distance as we \r\ncan between Oakdale and us. Mike! ",
        "",
        "Jack: You sounded urgent on the phone. What's up? ",
        "Holden: Damian Grimaldi is back. ",
        "Jack: You're kidding. ",
        "Holden: Wish I was. He conveniently showed up while I was out of town. Things \r\nbetween Lily and Luke are bad enough, and now that he's here I think they could \r\nget worse. ",
        "",
        "Lily: What do you mean, it's too late? You haven't sent Luke off to this \r\nbogus leadership program, or whatever your friend Kreeger is calling it. We \r\ncould still go back. We still have time to stop this. ",
        "Damian: But Ross Kreeger is over at the house now. He's probably convinced \r\nLuke already. ",
        "Lily: Well, we can unconvince him. Once he finds out -- Luke finds out what \r\nthis place is really all about, he's not gonna want to go. ",
        "Damian: It's a camp, Lily! It's hiking -- ",
        "Lily: Have you listened to anything that I've said. The brochures, the \r\nliterature -- it's all propaganda. Ross Kreeger is a deprogrammer. He \r\nbrainwashes kids into thinking they're not gay. ",
        "Damian: Nobody could do that, Lily. ",
        "Lily: No, they can't, they're not going to do it to our son because I'm not \r\ngoing to let it happen. ",
        "Damian: But you want -- you want Luke to come to his senses. You've said as \r\nmuch to me, so don't try to deny it now, Lily. You want our son to be straight.\r\n",
        "",
        "Ross: We have to leave tonight, Luke, or you'll lose your place. There's lots \r\nof other kids who want to be there. I don't want you to miss out. We'll call \r\nyour dad from the road. He'll understand. ",
        "Luke: You think? ",
        "Ross: Yeah, he'll be glad you took the initiative. ",
        "Luke: To what? To have you guys get to work on me? Cause that's what you \r\nsaid. That you wanted to get to work on me. What is this? Some sort of scared \r\nstraight thing? ",
        "Ross: I don't know what that is. ",
        "Luke: Oh, take a wild guess. ",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, I don't understand. ",
        "Luke: Okay. I'm gay, Mr. Kreeger. As I'm sure you already knew. ",
        "Ross: No. I didn\u2019t. ",
        "",
        "Emma: Hey, stranger. ",
        "Meg: Hey, Mama! I've been staying at Paul\u2019s. Did you get my message on the \r\nmachine? ",
        "Emma: Yeah, I got it. So, you're back. What happened? Did he kick you out or \r\ndid you just come to your senses? ",
        "Paul: Well, neither -- yet. She's still madly in love with me. You know, I've \r\ngiven her a million reasons to run away. ",
        "Emma: Isn't that charming? I'm afraid the time is long gone since you could \r\ncharm me, Paul Ryan. ",
        "Meg: Mama -- ",
        "Emma: Not too long ago you were in my kitchen crying your eyes out over this \r\nman. What's changed? ",
        "Meg: Well, we have a baby to consider now. Paul's baby. ",
        "Paul: We're going to raise it together. ",
        "Emma: I see -- well, how does Emily feel about that? ",
        "Paul: Well, she's agreed. Which has made things easier. But either way, she's \r\ngoing to be locked up for a long time, so Emily's not an issue. ",
        "Emma: No, she's not an issue, she's a person. And you haven't answered my \r\nquestion. ",
        "",
        "Emily: You're okay, sweetie. You did great. ",
        "Jennifer: How did it go? Are you in any pain? ",
        "Emily: No, not really. But the baby's okay, that's all that matters. How's \r\nJohnny? ",
        "Jennifer: He won't wake up. The doctor's let me hold him for a little while \r\nand he tried to open his eyes -- ",
        "Dusty: He's hanging on. ",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, he's hanging on. ",
        "Jennifer: Uncle Bob -- ",
        "Dusty: What is it? ",
        "Bob: The stem cells from Emily's fetus are an ideal match for Johnny. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank God. ",
        "Dusty: He's going to make it. ",
        "Susan: Emily, have you spoken to Dr. Schiller about this? ",
        "Emily: Yeah. ",
        "Susan: Did you tell them? Emily is very sorry. But she can't do this. Her \r\ndoctor strongly advises against it. ",
        "Emily: No, Mom, I know the risks. ",
        "Susan: Emily, please, don't do this. You know you can't do this. Don't take \r\nthis chance. It's very brave of you to want to donate the stem cells, but I \r\nthink we've all jumped the gun here. This stuff is very experimental. I've been \r\ntrying to explain to Emily that most of this work hasn't even been approved \r\noutside of clinical trials. ",
        "Bob: It can be done. Susan, it can be done as part of a study. Of course, the \r\nphysician who's running the studies would have to be present for the treatment. \r\nIt would take a lot of paperwork, and waivers and I have to get a clearance from \r\nthe hospital board. ",
        "Dusty: How long does that take? ",
        "Bob: Well, this is an emergency, I think with a conference call we could do \r\nit tonight. ",
        "Dusty: That's great. ",
        "Susan: Wait a second! This isn't settled. ",
        "Emily: Yes it is. ",
        "Bob: Well, listen I'll start the ball rolling. And we'll be ready either way.\r\n",
        "Emily: Bob, I've decided. ",
        "Susan: Can I see you two outside? ",
        "Emily: No, Mother, whatever you have to say, say it in front of me. ",
        "Susan: Do you hear her? Do you know what she's trying to do? She's trying to \r\nearn the right to be in the room. To be treated like a human being. But her baby \r\ncould die. Bottom line, that's the risk she's taking. She could sacrifice her \r\nbaby to buy your forgiveness. Now is that what you want? ",
        "Dusty: We want our son to live. ",
        "Susan: So do I. And if this weren't so experimental, maybe I would feel \r\ndifferently. But, there are no guarantees. What if it doesn't work? ",
        "Jennifer: Susan this could be his only hope. ",
        "Susan: But, what if Emily's baby dies and Johnny still isn't cured? That's a \r\nvery real possibility here. Everybody loses. And Emily has to live with the fact \r\nthat she gave up her baby's life for nothing. ",
        "Emily: Mom -- ",
        "Susan: Emily, you don't have to do this. You've got a choice here. You can \r\nchange your mind. ",
        "Dusty: Emily. ",
        "Emily: Just go -- will you all just please go! Please! ",
        "",
        "Paul: You want me to tell you how Emily feels about Meg and I raising her \r\nbaby? ",
        "Meg: Mama, that's not fair. ",
        "Emma: I'm sure that is just the way Emily feels. ",
        "Paul: I can't answer that question. Look, I'm sure part of her hates it. I\u2019m \r\nsure she's sad, I'm sure she's angry. But she knows that this is the way it has \r\nto be. She's accepted it. ",
        "Emma: Oh, I see. I see. Well, I have chores. ",
        "Paul: Listen, hold on -- please, I know that you're worried about Meg. ",
        "Emma: And I bet you know why. Standing right here, in this barn. ",
        "Meg: Yes, and he's willing to stand here and beg you for a chance, so the \r\nleast you can do -- ",
        "Emma: What I'm trying to say, my sweetheart, is that he's no stranger to this \r\nfarm. He knows his way around this farm, don't you Paul? ",
        "Paul: Yes, I do. ",
        "Emma: Yes, he does. I mean, after all he spent an awful lot of time here, \r\ntrying to convince Rosanna Cabot that you loved her. ",
        "Paul: Yes, I did. ",
        "Meg: Mama, that's cruel. ",
        "Emma: Not quite. ",
        "Paul: Look, you've seen my mistakes first hand. And I only hope that you're \r\nhere to see me get it right. Because I've learned. Meg and I, would love your \r\nblessing. It means a lot to both of us. ",
        "Meg: Just give us a chance. Or at least a break. For once, can you do that?\r\n",
        "Paul: All right, look, I know that you mortgaged the farm to help pay Meg's \r\nlegal bills. And I know that you wouldn't take it when she tried to pay you \r\nback. And all of that trouble is because of me. Please -- Emma take this and pay \r\nback the mortgage. ",
        "Emma: You think you can buy me off? Oh, my dear, dear man. You just think \r\nagain. ",
        "",
        "Katie: Are you sure you can -- ",
        "Mike: Yeah, I got it. To us. ",
        "Katie: To us. How's the eye? ",
        "Mike: I don't know. How's it look? ",
        "Katie: Better. ",
        "Mike: I look all right? ",
        "Katie: You look hot. ",
        "Mike: So do you. ",
        "Katie: What was that? ",
        "Mike: Fireworks, I guess. ",
        "Katie: Pretty, huh? ",
        "Mike: Yeah. ",
        "Katie: It's like a new start. Just for us. You and me baby. You are smooth \r\ntonight! ",
        "Mike: You like that? ",
        "Katie: What is going to go wrong now? ",
        "",
        "Jack: Damian says there's no danger now. ",
        "Holden: He says a lot of things. ",
        "Jack: How long's he staying? ",
        "Holden: Good question. First he shows up, says he's only passing through. \r\nNext thing you know, he's renting Fairwinds on a long-term lease. ",
        "Jack: Oh, brother. ",
        "Holden: Yeah, what if he's back because something started, in Malta? ",
        "Jack: He'd be a fool to come back here then. What reason did he give you for \r\ncoming back? ",
        "Holden: He didn't say anything. He just showed up with a signet ring and a \r\nlot of talk about Luke's birthright. ",
        "Jack: I thought he'd given up on that whole family dynasty thing? ",
        "Holden: Yeah, we thought too. But then -- if it's not that, then what is it? \r\nBecause he certainly didn't show up just to say hello. ",
        "Jack: Okay, I still have my contact at Interpol from the last time around \r\nwith this clown. If he's in trouble in Europe, this guy will know about it. ",
        "Holden: It's kind of late over in Europe, isn't it? If you want to give him a \r\ncall -- ",
        "Jack: Sit tight. I'll be right back. ",
        "",
        "Ross: So -- you're gay? ",
        "Luke: Yeah. Do you still want me at your camp? ",
        "Ross: Why wouldn't I? ",
        "Luke: No reason, especially since it's your job is to brainwash me into being \r\nstraight. ",
        "Ross: Nobody can make you into something you're not. ",
        "Luke: No, they can\u2019t. ",
        "Ross: You don't trust me. ",
        "Luke: No I don\u2019t. ",
        "Ross: You can't trust me, because you don't trust yourself. That's what we \r\nwant to help you with, Luke. Trusting yourself. That's what your mother wants \r\nfor you too. ",
        "Luke: Does my mother know what you do at this program of yours? ",
        "Ross: Of course she does, Luke. She understands that we can help you. There's \r\nnothing sinister here, son. We're giving you a chance to find yourself. That's \r\nexactly why your mother wants you to join us. ",
        "",
        "Lily: I want our son to be happy with who he is. ",
        "Damian: Which is a very confused young man who's blaming that confusion on \r\nbeing gay. But he's not gay. ",
        "Lily: You're so sure of that. ",
        "Damian: So are you, Lily. ",
        "Lily: It is possible. It is also possible that Luke is gay. You're missing my \r\npoint. That this Kreeger foundation -- what they're all really about. Damian --\r\n",
        "Damian: They're good people, Lily. ",
        "Lily: You knew. ",
        "Damian: Knew what? ",
        "Lily: You knew. You knew what Ross Kreeger had planned all along. ",
        "Damian: He wants to help. ",
        "Lily: He wants to change Luke. ",
        "Damian: Yes. He wants to take away the confusion. Which could be painful at \r\nfirst. Maybe Luke will even resent us for a while. But once he's better, it'll \r\nall be worth it. Listen, Cara. He'll find a girl, we'll have a wedding, you'll \r\nhave grandchildren. Isn't that what you always wanted for your son? ",
        "Lily: Yes, yes. ",
        "Damian: That's what he wants too. ",
        "Lily: No, you don't -- we don't know that. ",
        "Damian: It would be one thing if it were just a rebellion, just a kid saying \r\nthings to upset his parents as a way to assert his independence. But if he takes \r\naction, Lily, he could do something he could never take back. ",
        "Lily: Like what? Falling in love with a boy? ",
        "Damian: It wouldn't have to be love, Lily. You know how they are, how it \r\ncould happen. ",
        "Lily: Oh my God. Did I sound like that to my son? ",
        "Damian: What? ",
        "Lily: Like you. So wrong. ",
        "Damian: Lily, our son needs - ",
        "Lily: Don't tell me what our son needs. Our son doesn't need to change. But I \r\ndo. I listen to what you're saying and I think how Luke must feel. To have a \r\nparent stand in front of him and judge him. ",
        "Damian: We're not judging -- ",
        "Lily: Judging him. Rejecting him. Sending him off to some place to be \r\nremodeled into something more conventional, more familiar, more -- oh my God, \r\nhow could I have been so blind. ",
        "Damian: Be careful, Lily. Your baby. ",
        "Lily: As mad as my mother used to get at me, as many times as I disappointed \r\nher, she never ever judged me. The world was less than perfect, but I was always \r\nperfect. She never looked at me like -- I have to go. ",
        "Damian: Lily, wait. ",
        "Lily: No! I'm going back to my house, I'm gonna kick Ross Kreeger out and \r\napologize to my son. And to my husband. ",
        "Damian: You think that's going to be enough? We went behind Holden\u2019s back, \r\nLily. He's never going to understand. Unless you let Luke go, and then let him \r\ncome back as he's meant to be. ",
        "",
        "Jack: I made a few calls. My contact at Interpol, and then some follow-up, \r\njust to make sure. ",
        "Holden: So, what's Damian up to? ",
        "Jack: Nothing, according to these guys. Apparently Damian\u2019s kept his nose \r\nclean the last couple of years. I can't even bust him on a traffic ticket if I \r\nwanted to. ",
        "Holden: So that means he can stay in town indefinitely? ",
        "Jack: Legally, yeah. How's Lily handling it? ",
        "Holden: She's okay. Better than okay. Damian's her new ally. ",
        "Jack: With what? ",
        "Holden: They both think Luke's going through this phase that he can be talked \r\nout of. ",
        "Jack: What phase are ya -- is that what you were worried about before? This \r\n-- phase? ",
        "Holden: Yeah, it turns out that Luke is gay. ",
        "Jack: Okay. ",
        "Holden: And she's having a hard time adjusting to it. She refuses to believe \r\nit. ",
        "Jack: That's not good. ",
        "Holden: No, it's not. And now Damian\u2019s here and by agreeing with her, it's \r\njust making it that much harder for her to come to terms with reality. It's not \r\na healthy situation, Jack, and I think that Luke is the one who's going to \r\nreally suffer here. ",
        "",
        "Ross: Your mother said you'd been very unhappy these past few months. ",
        "Luke: But that was before. When I was lying about who I was. Now everything \r\n-- ",
        "Ross: Now what? You're happy? ",
        "Luke: Yes! Everything's fine. ",
        "Ross: Things are good at home? ",
        "Luke: They will be. ",
        "Ross: What do your friends think? Do you even tell your friends? ",
        "Luke: I've told some. ",
        "Ross: Why not tell everybody? If hiding is the problem, Luke, why are you \r\nstill hiding? Because you know, don't you? You know that being gay means being \r\nrejected, misunderstood, alienated. Is that the kind of life you want, Luke? ",
        "Luke: It doesn't have to be. ",
        "Ross: Well, it is for you, isn't it? ",
        "Luke: No. ",
        "Ross: Not yet. As long as you don't tell, you can pretend it won't change \r\nanything with your friends. Luke, you can fit in. Don't you want to like \r\nyourself? That's all your mother wants for you too. ",
        "Luke: Get out. ",
        "Ross: Excuse me? ",
        "Luke: Get out of my house! Or I will call the cops. And have you thrown out!\r\n",
        "Ross: Well, you can't have me thrown out, Luke. Your mother invited me here. \r\nYou're a minor, she entrusted you to my care. There's nothing the police can do \r\nabout that. ",
        "",
        "Meg: I told she wouldn't take it. ",
        "Paul: Emma, please, it's only fair. ",
        "Emma: I'll tell you what I told my daughter, Meg here, when she offered me \r\nthat money. I don't need it and I don't want it. ",
        "Meg: Why are you being so spiteful when I'm finally happy! ",
        "Emma: Oh -- you're happy? ",
        "Meg: I was until I came here. Paul loves me. And yes, I am happy. ",
        "Emma: Well, I see the last time I heard that, it was Dusty. When you were \r\nhappy and in love forever. ",
        "Meg: Well, he loved somebody else. Can't you see that's different, Mama? \r\nPaul's not waiting or wishing for anybody else. It's me. Finally. I'm the one.\r\n",
        "Emma: Yes, well that's the way it should always be. You should be the one!\r\n",
        "Meg: That's right! I didn't settle this time. And I know things aren't \r\nperfect but it's real. We're going to raise his child. And I'll be a mom. And \r\nyou can be the baby's grandma. Please, this child needs you. We need you. Just \r\nbe happy for me. ",
        "Emma: I see -- if you say you're happy -- I'll try and be happy for you, but \r\nplease don't ask me to forget what I know about this man. ",
        "Meg: Can you at least leave some room to get to know him a little bit more?\r\n",
        "Emma: Look, you two finish up out here and you just call me when you're \r\nfinished because -- I didn't milk Cher today and I have to milk her before I go \r\nto bed. ",
        "Paul: There's a cow? Named Cher? ",
        "Meg: Yeah, a mean old heifer. ",
        "Paul: There's a joke in there somewhere. I just can't think of any. That was \r\npretty intense with you and your mom. ",
        "Meg: Yeah, she and I could go at it pretty good. Even before you came around.\r\n",
        "Paul: Right, but now it's even more special. ",
        "Meg: Oh yeah. ",
        "Paul: I'll get her on our side. ",
        "Meg: I'm used to her disapproval. ",
        "Paul: Forget you, then, I'll get her on my side. Because I know the other \r\noptions for this baby in the grandmother department. I'll win her over. ",
        "Meg: You think so? ",
        "Paul: I know so. I'll do whatever I have to. ",

        "Emily: I don't want to lose this baby. ",
        "Susan: No, you don\u2019t. You need to rest. This decision can wait a little bit. \r\nJust clear your mind. Be sure. ",

        "Dusty: She will. ",

        "Dusty: Okay, I'll wait here for Emily. ",
        "Jennifer: Dr. Lake said that he would look for other donors. You'll ask? In \r\ncase -- ",
