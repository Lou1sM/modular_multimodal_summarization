        "Luke is trying to be supportive as Noah moves out of the cottage. Meg continues to worry about Sophie \u0096 especially after Paul gave her the check, as Paul is sure the Sophie will do the right thing. Sophie tells a furious Cole that she dropped the charges against Paul. Paul learns from Margo that Sophie dropped the charges. Luke wonders what the status of his and Noah's relationship is? Lucinda is happy to see Lily in good spirits, as she admits it is nice to talk business and not focus solely on Holden. Carly and Holden share a kiss, but then Carly burns herself. Sophie kicks Cole out after he insinuates that Paul is laughing at her. Lily is content right now that Holden admits that he wants to work on their marriage. Noah explains that he just needs a break. Carly and Holden share awkward moments in the car, as Carly wants to talk about it but Holden doesn't. Sophie comes to see Paul but finds Meg; Meg informs her that she isn't welcome there anymore. Sophie is surprised to learn Meg knows about the check. Lucinda and Barbara bond over cancer, as Lucinda doesn't want to see Barbara make the same mistake she did with her kids by pushing them away. Luke runs into a friend, Reg, and finds out he and his boyfriend broke up; Reg asks about the rumor that Noah is now married and then asks Luke to hang out sometime. Carly and Holden are uncomfortable as they arrive at the farm and run into an excited Lily, who wants to know everything that happened on their trip. Holden excuses himself, as Carly and he catch one another's eyes. Carly talks to Lily about their time at the camp and their trip home - while leaving out the obvious. Paul and Meg find Barbara feeling not so well at lunch and Meg takes her upstairs while Paul cancels her order. Paul bumps into Sophie, who insinuates that she might take his money and leave town. She also poses a question to Paul; if Meg didn't exist would they have ever stood a chance? Luke tells Noah about Reg and Noah is unsure what to think but doesn't back down from still needing space, which leads to a big blow up with them, as Luke doesn't know where he stands and Noah can't tell him anything concrete other then he needs time. Paul tells Sophie that loving Meg isn't a choice - he just does. Luke walks out on Noah, who also reacts badly. Luke meets up with Reg. Meg takes a leave of absence to take care of Barbara; Sophie overhears she and Paul talking about how she is on probation. Noah hears about Luke's side from Lucinda's point of view. Noah moves out, leaves his wedding band behind, but later he spies Luke with Reg, and takes off unnoticed. Luke leaves soon after. Sophie slips into the on call room at the hospital, takes Meg's ID badge and goes to look her up on the hospital computer. Lily is thrilled when Holden agrees to have breakfast with her, but Holden can't stop thinking about his kiss with Carly. Carly is looking over pictures on the computer at camp and is stopped in her tracks by happy and comfortable pictures of she and Holden."

        "Luke: I came to help you pack. I helped you move in. I might as well help you move out.",
        "Noah: That's okay. I've got it under control.",
        "Luke: You sure? 'Cause I'm a pretty expert labeler. You might regret letting me go. That's mine. The t-shirt.",

        "Meg: Um.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Are you sure Sofie knows why you gave her that check?",
        "Paul: Oh, you weren't thinking about how much you miss me.",
        "Meg: Look, what if she doesn't do the right thing and drop those charges?",
        "Paul: Stop. Stop, stop. You worry too much.",
        "Meg: Maybe you don't worry enough.",
        "Paul: We just made love, and you're talking to me about Sofie, about what Sofie might do. Nothing matters. Nothing matters except us. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: There you are. Did you go see Paul?",
        "Sofie: Yes.",
        "Cole: And? Did you tell him what I told you to say?",
        "Sofie: That I would drop the whole thing if he would just pay me off? Yes. Yes, Cole. Yes, I did say that. But he didn't go for it. I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: Don't be sorry. Just try again. He'll come around.",
        "Sofie: No. No, he won't. Because after I saw Paul, I went to the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Margo, thank you so much for calling. Thanks a lot. She did it. Sofie dropped the charges.",
        "Meg: Are you kidding? You're not just saying that to make me feel better.",
        "Paul: No. I just have to go down to the station and sign some papers.",
        "Meg: Oh, my God.",
        "Paul: And it's over. And it's over. This whole insane -- this insane mess is over.",

        "Noah: Whatever.",
        "Luke: So, do you want me to take these boxes out to the truck?",
        "Noah: No, leave those. Those are Ameera's things, her clothes and books.",
        "Luke: Oh. Oh, okay. You know, you're not going to have very much room at the dorm. I could take these out to the farm.",
        "Noah: Luke, what are you doing?",
        "Luke: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Noah: I didn't ask for your help, okay? I asked for a break.",

        "Lucinda: This is so wonderful.",
        "Lily: What is?",
        "Lucinda: This is just wonderful. It's a sight for sore eyes to see you smiling, to see you make a pro forma meeting with your investment counselor and ask meaningful questions.",
        "Lily: Mother, you're gushing.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I am. Because I'm just so happy. This is a side of you that I have not seen for a long time, and I've missed it.",
        "Lily: So have I.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I want you to remember this. Because this is who you are. You are a vibrant, strong woman.",
        "Lily: I am. And I have to admit that it feels really good to be doing something, to be focusing on something other than Holden.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Holden, I-I we -- ow! Ow!",
        "Holden: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: I just burned my hand on this stupid engine!",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: I'm getting some ice. You need to put it on that burn.",
        "Carly: I'd rather have the beer.",
        "Holden: Start with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How could you do this? We had the richest guy in town right where we wanted him, and you caved!",
        "Sofie: It was the right thing to do.",
        "Cole: The right thing to do? You just blew the chance of a lifetime. Do you get that?",
        "Sofie: Stop yelling at me and maybe then you can understand why --",
        "Cole: I know why you did it. You did it to get Paul to like you. You always have to have people like you, don't you, Sofie?",
        "Sofie: Shut up.",
        "Cole: I asked you, for your own good, not for mine, to do one simple thing for me, and you couldn't do it.",
        "Sofie: Just stop it, Cole.",
        "Cole: But for Paul Ryan, the man you claimed raped you, no problem. You'd let him walk all over you if that's what it takes. And you know what he's doing right now? He's laughing. At you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: [Meg laughs]",
        "Paul: Stop, stop, stop it. Come on, I can do it by myself. You keep this up, I'll never get those papers signed.",
        "Meg: Oh, trust me, you will sign those papers.",
        "Paul: Oh, I will, will I?",
        "Meg: Yes, you will. Because once you do, then we'll finally have more time to spend together.",
        "Paul: You know that's all I've ever wanted?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. It's just been scary for me to think that it could really happen. Because we'd been there, been so close, so many times.",
        "Paul: Right, and you think I'm gonna screw it all up again. I promise you, Meg, this is how things will be from now on. Us happy and madly in love.",
        "Meg: And no more Sofie.",
        "Paul: No Sofie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul wouldn't laugh at me. He's not like you.",

        "Sofie: Barbara doesn't know how Paul feels. He cares about me!",
        "Cole: No. He cared whether you dropped the charges against him. Watch. Now that you have, it'll be like you never existed. When are you going to wake up? God, we could've milked a fortune out of him.",
        "Sofie: The money. The money, that's all this is about. You never wanted to help me, not really.",
        "Cole: Doesn't really matter now anyway, does it? Now that you blew it. There's not gonna be any money for either of us.",
        "Sofie: Get out. Get out, get out, get out now! Get out of my life, I hate you! I hate you!",

        "Sofie: Get out!",

        "Noah: Would you relax? Nobody is breaking up.",
        "Luke: Well, it sure feels that way.",
        "Noah: Why, because I don't need your help packing?",
        "Luke: Because you're pushing me away, Noah, and don't try to pretend that you're not.",
        "Noah: I just need some time. What do you want me to say?",
        "Luke: I want you to pretend that we're at the farm, and it's dark, we're out on the porch, and I just want you to talk to me, Noah.",
        "Noah: I can't do that.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Noah: Because that's not where my head's at right now.",
        "Luke: Do you remember last Christmas? You gave me that card. And in it, you thanked me, Noah. For always standing by you.",
        "Luke: Please stop making excuses!",
        "Noah: My father is dead!",
        "Luke: Noah --",
        "Noah: No, he's dead, okay, and I've got to get on with my life. And that's not an excuse. That's just the way it is.",
        "Luke: Okay, then please, please let me help you.",
        "Noah: You can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, when he got back from Tennessee, he told me that he wants to make our marriage work. And for the first time, I believe him.",
        "Lucinda: That's wonderful, Honey.",
        "Lily: Yeah, it is. But it doesn't mean I can't take some time for myself.",
        "Lucinda: No, absolutely not.",
        "Lily: I was suffocating us, trying to make things what they were before. I've decided to back off. I am just gonna let whatever happens, happen naturally. I'm not going to force it, or us, back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How's your hand?",
        "Carly: The throbbing's stopped.",
        "Holden: That's good.",
        "Carly: So, where did you learn how to hotwire a car, anyway?",
        "Holden: That would be years of practice on broken-down tractors.",
        "Carly: So, they're the same, then, tractors and cars?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. Close enough. It won't work.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Holden: You have to keep the ice on your hand.",
        "Carly: Oh. Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: See, this is why I didn't want to do this right now. I'm still thinking things through in my head. I didn't want to say something that I --",
        "Luke: That you didn't mean?",
        "Noah: Luke, I'm not good about talking things out how I feel inside. You know that.",
        "Luke: Oh, really? Are we back at that again? Because you really didn't seem to have that problem before we left for New York. We sat right in there, in that room, and you told me how much you loved me and that you were in love with me. Has that changed?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Luke: Well, could you at least look at me when you say that?",
        "Noah: No. It hasn't changed. I'm still in love with you.",

        "[Soft clatter]",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Meg: What are you doing here?",
        "Sofie: I came to see Paul.",
        "Meg: He's not here, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Well, where is he?",
        "Meg: He went out.",
        "Sofie: I see. Just tell him I came by, then.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Sofie: Because I asked you to.",
        "Meg: No, I mean, I thought I made it quite clear that you're not welcome here anymore.",
        "Sofie: Funny, because the last time I checked, this wasn't your home, and Paul seemed to have no problem with me being here before.",
        "Meg: Leave. Now. Before I call the police and have you arrested for trespassing. Fine, have it your way.",
        "Sofie: We worked things out between us. I just came by to thank him, that's all.",
        "Meg: Thank him? You mean, for the check he gave you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It's been a long time since I've felt this good about things.",
        "Lucinda: That's 'cause you're not playing games. You're not using ploys. You're just being patient.",
        "Lily: Like you?",
        "Lucinda: Baby, we're not talking about me.",
        "Lily: Damn right we're not.",
        "Lucinda: No, we're not. Um -- Honey, I've got a few calls to make and errands to run. Is it okay if I don't take you back?",
        "Lily: Yeah, no problem. I'm gonna stick around, do a little shopping. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Lucinda: Yes. I love you.",
        "Lily: I love you. Bye, Mom.",
        "Lucinda: Bye, Honey. Hi, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Lucinda. Hi.",
        "Lucinda: You look wonderful.",
        "Barbara: Why, thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Can I buy you a cup of tea?",
        "Barbara: Um --",
        "Lucinda: You're such a smart woman. You're so smart. Why are you doing this to yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I can't take this anymore.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Carly: We've passed 17 mile markers without saying a word. It's ridiculous. It's obvious that we're both thinking about the same thing. Let's just stop. Let's just pull over and we'll talk about it.",
        "Holden: Not a good idea. We already have time to make up so let's just keep going.",
        "Carly: Just keep going? That's it?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Would you like some sugar, maybe?",
        "Barbara: I need for it to cool down a little bit first.",
        "Lucinda: I know, you know. I know perfectly well. Come on. It's me you're talking to. You don't go into the oncology wing of the hospital unless you have to.",
        "Barbara: Well, why not, it's so cheery there, don't you think?",
        "Lucinda: On the way out, maybe, I think.",
        "Barbara: You know, Lucinda, you are way beyond the place that I'm at right now.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'm sorry. Forgive me. But there is some trauma that is -- you never forget it.",
        "Barbara: I'd like to.",
        "Lucinda: Is that what you're doing here, dressed up like gessie gorgeous? Sitting in the lounge, forgetting?",
        "Barbara: You know, I just can't take being upstairs any longer staring at the four walls, that's all. So, yeah, I got gussied up so I came down here because I'm really tired. I'm really tired of just being the person who has this cancer in her mouth, you know? I'm tired of being the person --",
        "Lucinda: Shh. You're sick.",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, you're sick. So what? You're sick. Just admit that to yourself.",
        "Barbara: It's pretty hard to forget when I have reminders every single day, like not being able to drink something till it cools down, or trying to eat something, or every time I try to talk --",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I just don't think you, you, Barbara, you, should be alone here in the lounge.",
        "Barbara: My family can't be waiting on me every single second of the day, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah? Have they offered?",
        "Barbara: Yes, they have. They have.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Well, then don't do what I did.",
        "Barbara: Which was?",
        "Lucinda: Don't make a mistake. Don't shut your family out when you most need them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reg: Luke.",
        "Luke: Oh, Reg, Reg. Hey.",
        "Reg: Hey. How you doing, Man? It's good to see you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, I'm doing good. I haven't seen you for a while -- since the party at the cabin for the alliance you invited me and Noah to. How are you? How are things with your boyfriend? Tony, right?",
        "Reg: I'm great. Thank you. As for Tony, you'd probably have to ask him. We broke up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul told you about the money?",
        "Meg: You didn't think he would?",
        "Sofie: Does it matter what I think? Because you're just gonna tell me I'm wrong or pretend you're sympathetic when you're really not, because I know what you think of me, Meg.",
        "Meg: What I think of you is not the issue, Sofie. When Paul gave you that check, his intentions behind it were very clear. Drop the charges and leave us alone.",
        "Sofie: Well, I've already been to the police station.",
        "Meg: And the charges have been dropped. I know. Margo called Paul right after you left there.",
        "Sofie: Oh.",
        "Meg: So now it's time for you to let go of the rest of this. Because this fixation you have on Paul, it's not healthy.",
        "Sofie: Fixation?",
        "Meg: You know, maybe you should take the money that he gave you and use it to find someone to talk to.",
        "Sofie: What, like, a shrink? Therapy? I don't need help! And I don't want you to pretend to care when you really don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I won't stay long. I just want to grab a couple of books for J.J.",
        "Holden: Take your time. I'll try to stay out of your way.",
        "Carly: It's your house, Holden. You can't be in the way.",
        "Lily: You're back! How was your trip? I want to hear all about it.",
        "Lily: Are the girls having fun? Did they like the camp? What about you?",
        "Holden: Yes. Yes, to all of it.",
        "Carly: It was a total blast.",
        "Lily: Oh, I want to hear about everything I missed.",
        "Holden: I need to check on the horses. I'll let Carly fill you in.",
        "Carly: No, there are too many good stories. I don't want to take that from you.",
        "Lily: No, you'll give me the real scoop.",
        "Holden: I'll be in when I'm done.",
        "Lily: What about the cabins? Are they clean? Did they split the girls up or did they get to share the same cabin? Is the food any good? I mean, because I know Faith will die if the food is horrible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I didn't know you and Tony had broken up. I'm so sorry to hear it.",
        "Reg: It's all right. We'd only been together a few months. How long have you and Noah been together?",
        "Luke: Officially, eight months.",
        "Reg: A lifetime.",
        "Luke: Yeah, right.",
        "Reg: So, okay, I heard this rumor. Did Noah marry a girl from Iraq? This guy in my Lit class said that he did.",
        "Luke: Yeah, Ameera. Yes, he did. But I can't talk about it.",
        "Reg: Still together?",
        "Luke: Noah and Ameera?",
        "Reg: No. You and Noah.",
        "Luke: Uh, we're -- we're trying to work things out.",
        "Reg: Because of the story that cannot be told?",
        "Luke: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Reg: So, what does that mean for you? I mean, if he has a wife now, are you allowed to see other guys?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: There are times that I'm waiting to go in for radiation, and I can barely lift myself out of the chair. And yet, I have been so independent. I don't want to ask anybody for help. I don't want anyone feeling sorry for me.",
        "Lucinda: The only person who's feeling sorry for you is yourself. If people help you, it's because they want to and they love you. And sierra and lily, I mean, they did everything they could to help me, and that helped them with their trauma. It was kind of wonderful, actually. So you see, let the boys help you. Anyway, it's a good way to manage some of this horrible mess.",
        "Barbara: You're being awfully nice to me, you know that?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it?",
        "Barbara: It's a little suspicious, actually.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Well, what the heck. We've had our differences, but now we're sisters. Sisters under the skin. Cancer survivors should stick together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Actually, I would have thought you guys would've gotten back sooner. I mean, when Holden called, he said you were already on the road.",
        "Carly: We had car trouble. Actually, a car disaster.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Carly: Well, the short version is that somebody stole it.",
        "Lily: What? It's parked outside.",
        "Carly: I know. We stopped and we got out to look at something. Holden left the keys in the car. And we got back. It was gone. So we had to hitchhike. Later, we found the car with no keys. Your husband can hotwire a car like nobody's business, by the way.",
        "Lily: I know. He's quite proud of that little trick. You should see him with a tractor. So, was the trip was good for you guys? I mean, when you left, you weren't on the best of terms. Did you work everything out?",
        "Carly: Yes, everything's fine now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom?",
        "Barbara: Hi. What are you two doing here?",
        "Paul: We're looking for you. You all right?",
        "Barbara: Can I ask you a favor, please?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: Would you mind just helping me get up?",
        "Paul: Sure.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Thanks, Honey. I ordered some food. I don't want the waiter to come back and not find me here.",
        "Paul: No problem. Meg, can you take my mom upstairs?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Paul: I'll find the waiter and cancel your order.",
        "Barbara: Thanks. Thanks, Honey.",
        "Paul: Hey. Miss Ryan -- I'd like to cancel her order, please.",
        "Waiter: Of course, Mr. Ryan.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",

        "Reg: Luke, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Luke: Oh, you didn't. You didn't. It's okay. I just got to get going. Okay. All right, honestly, the thing is, I don't know, the idea of dating somebody else, it just, it never crossed my mind. It's just, you know, it's Noah, and I think we'll be okay. We just need to work some stuff out.",
        "Reg: I can respect that. I don't have to like it, though. Listen, I think it's pretty obvious I'm pretty attracted to you, and you seem to be able to tolerate me, right? And I'm not married. So if you ever change your mind, just let me know. Who knows, it could be fun to hang out sometime without all the baggage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Just so you know, I wasn't following you. I came in here to --",
        "Paul: Sofie, I don't think you were following me. I'm glad I ran into you. Margo said you dropped the charges. Thank you.",
        "Sofie: It was the right thing to do. We both know that.",
        "Paul: I meant what I said. I wasn't very nice to you.",
        "Sofie: That's okay.",
        "Paul: No, it's not okay. You and I were friends and I screwed it up. And I crossed a big line when I slept with you. My heart wasn't in it. Nobody should do that to anybody. I'm really sorry I did that to you.",
        "Sofie: I wanted something that I couldn't have. That wasn't your fault. You know, I've been thinking a lot about the money you gave me.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Sofie: Do you really think I could use it to start over? You know, away from Oakdale?",
        "Paul: Sofie, I think you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. I have every faith in you. I always have.",
        "Sofie: I have a question. If it weren't for Meg, would we have ever a chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So I ran into Reg Addington today.",
        "Noah: From school? Was he with Tony?",
        "Luke: No, they -- they broke up. Actually, it was kind of weird. He asked me out.",
        "Noah: Reg did? What did you say?",
        "Luke: What do you expect? I said that I wasn't available. I mean, I'm not, am I? What kind of break are we talking about here?",
        "Noah: I don't know. It's -- it's whatever kind we need.",
        "Luke: Well, for the record, Noah, I don't need a break from you. So, what are you saying?",
        "Noah: I --",
        "Luke: What? You what? You can't even give me an explanation about where we stand?",
        "Noah: I don't know! Yes! Everything's -- it's still the same with me. I still need a break. Is that what you want to hear?",
        "Luke: Yes. Yes. When I ask my boyfriend how he feels about me seeing other guys, that's exactly what I want to hear.",
        "Noah: I don't want to tell you what to do. If that's what you want --",
        "Luke: If it's what I want? Well, what about what you want? Do you want to see Reg wearing that t-shirt? Do you want to see us walking around campus arm in arm? Because that's what you're asking. And you know what, Noah? I know from experience that it sucks. And it hurts.",
        "Noah: From experience? What? You mean Ameera? Are you mad about that?",
        "Luke: No, I'm not mad about Ameera. I'm mad about what you're d-- no, you know what, not what you're doing. Scratch that. What you're not doing.",
        "Noah: What am I not doing?",
        "Luke: I've been sitting here next to you for 15 minutes and you haven't even touched me. You haven't touched me since we've been back from New York.",
        "Noah: Okay, I don't want to talk about New York.",
        "Luke: And guess what? The I.C.E., they're not here anymore.",
        "Noah: That's not fair.",
        "Luke: And neither is what you're doing to me. Stop pretending that I'm not a part of this, too, Noah.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, you don't have to be. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul, just tell the truth. It's okay. I can handle it.",
        "Paul: Sofie, it's not that simple. Look, I've been where you are now, so I think I understand how you're thinking. And I have made decisions out of fear or anger, you name it. But loving Meg is not a decision that I made. I just do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Who am I to you, Noah?",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Luke: I mean, am I just some guy? Or am I it? Am I -- am I the love of your life?",
        "Noah: How am I supposed to know that?",
        "Luke: I do. Because that's what you are to me... God, Noah, you haven't even taken off your stupid wedding ring.",
        "Noah: If you didn't want me to marry Ameera, why didn't you say that when I asked you?",
        "Luke: What was I supposed to say, Noah? \"If you love me, don't do it? Send the girl back to Iraq\"?",
        "Noah: Is that how you felt?",
        "Luke: Why? Does that not sound like the Luke that you fell in love with? Do you even want me at all? Because you don't want me here. And you didn't want me in New York. And it feels like every time I try to stand with you, I have to fight to get there. So when are you going to fight for me, Noah?",

        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Paul: How is she?",
        "Meg: Well, she's worried about you. And stubborn. And pushing herself too hard, and doing things she shouldn't be doing.",
        "Paul: Right. Let's lock her up.",
        "Meg: No. But she does need to be closely monitored. So I was gonna take a leave of absence from the hospital.",
        "Paul: No, you can't do that. You just got that job back. It's really important to you.",
        "Meg: Well, so is this. And it's something I want to do.",
        "Paul: You're not doing this for me, are you?",
        "Meg: Nope. I'm doing it for us.",

        "Carly: Better. We're still keeping a close eye on him. I think secretly he likes the attention.",
        "Lily: Is there anything we can do to help?",
        "Carly: Thanks for offering. No, I think that Jack and I have it under control.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: Oh! That's you.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Hello. Hi, Sandy. Oh, okay. I'll be right there. Thanks. Jack got called into the station. We had a neighbor watching J.J. she has to go, which means so do I.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm so glad we got a chance to catch up.",
        "Carly: Me, too. And I will e-mail you those pictures as soon as I can.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay.",
        "Lily: Oh, Carly, books.",

        "Luke: Look --",
        "Noah: Is that what you're saying?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Noah: No? What about when you were paralyzed? And you didn't want to see anyone, including me?",
        "Luke: That was different.",
        "Noah: Not to me. I stayed. I showed you that I didn't care if you were in a wheelchair or not. I did those exercises with you. I helped you learn how to walk again. I picked you up when you fell. I never once gave up on you, and now you're here telling me that I never fought for you?",
        "Luke: Well, then why is this so hard? If you really don't blame me for what happened to your father, why can't we work through this? What more do we have to go through?",
        "Noah: I don't -- I don't know what else to say here. I feel like everything's closing in. I just need --",
        "Luke: You just need that break that you keep talking about.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Thank you for letting me and Ameera stay here. It meant a lot. You know, being part of a family. Or, you know, almost.",
        "Lucinda: You don't have to thank me, Darling. You know, in the sense that Luke is family, then you -- hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Its okay, you know. It's okay. You have the right to grieve for your difficult dad. It was tragic. It's a loss. Although, of course, it could have been so much worse.",
        "Noah: I don't really see how.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I think you do. Luke -- you know, when he called me from New York, got me involved in all of that, I had no choice, because he was in such a state. He was scared, scared.",
        "Noah: He was scared?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely, in a panic. In a panic. He didn't know where you were. Just knew that your dad had you. He got himself on that boat without any thought of bodily harm or anything because he wasn't coming home without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Reg: Hey. Sit.",

        "Meg: Good.",
        "Paul: How did it go at the hospital?",
        "Meg: Fine. Bob was fine with my leave of absence once he found out that it was for Barbara. I'm relieved.",
        "Paul: Do you really think he was gonna say no to you?",
        "Meg: Well, I am on probation there. And I really don't expect any special treatment with all the mistakes I've made.",
        "Paul: Everybody makes mistakes.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, mine cost a patient her life.",
        "Paul: I think you should forgive yourself for that.",
        "Meg: Just like you forgave Sofie?",
        "Paul: Can we please stop talking about Sofie?",
        "Meg: You know, I'm afraid we can't. She came by Fairwinds when you were gone. And, Paul, I really don't think she's going to leave us alone. No matter what she says or how many checks she cashes.",
        "Paul: Because I ran into her, and she said that she wants to make a brand-new start of things away from Oakdale.",
        "Meg: She said that?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Is it wrong for me to be happy to hear that?",
        "Paul: It is never wrong for you to be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reg: So I got you to sit. What's it gonna take to get you to talk?",
        "Luke: Oh, nothing. I was just thinking about something that you said earlier, and I was wondering if maybe you were right.",
        "Reg: Well, if I said it, it probably was. So, what did I say?",
        "Luke: Um, nothing. Nothing. It's not a big deal. You know what, I probably shouldn't even be here right now. I should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Okay, Meg, let's see what mistakes you've made.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Taking off?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I think so. Sure I can't tempt you with dinner?",
        "Holden: No, I'm kind of wiped out from the trip and all that car trouble. How about I stop by tomorrow? And you, Ethan, and I can have breakfast?",
        "Lily: Sure, I'd like that. Oh, and I'll give you an incentive. If you come in time to help me get him dressed, I'll make your favorite.",
