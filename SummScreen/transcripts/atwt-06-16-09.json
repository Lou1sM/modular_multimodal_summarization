        "Casey: You leaving?",
        "Riley: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Riley: You should know. It was your idea.",
        "Casey: How's my mom feel about this?",
        "Riley: I haven't seen Margo yet. Can you give this to her?",
        "Casey: What's it say?",
        "Riley: Nothing about you wanting me to leave. I just thanked her for being so nice to me.",
        "Casey: She's gonna think it's weird you're leaving without saying good-bye in person.",
        "Riley: If I see her, she's just gonna try to convince me not to leave. Is that what you want?",
        "Casey: Have a nice trip.",
        "Riley: Listen, Casey, I'm sorry we didn't hit it off.",
        "Casey: I'm just looking out for my mom.",
        "Riley: Right. That's what you said.",
        "Casey: Where are you headed?",
        "Riley: What does it matter? You want me to leave? I'm gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Must be good.",
        "Hunter: Alison, hey.",
        "Alison: Wow. You were quick to shut that off.",
        "Hunter: Well, it's impolite to watch your phone while someone's talking to you.",
        "Alison: What were you watching?",
        "Hunter: It's idiotic.",
        "Alison: You, watching something idiotic?",
        "Hunter: Strange but true.",
        "Alison: What was it?",
        "Hunter: \"Slime over Manhattan.\"",
        "Alison: No way!",
        "Hunter: You've heard of it?",
        "Alison: Yeah! I've seen it like 20 times.",
        "Hunter: Eh, that's highly unlikely.",
        "Alison: Come on. Then how -- then how would I know about the scene where the jellyfish people are taking over the stock exchange, and they say --",
        "Both: \"We're taking this market down!\"",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Alison: See? I told you. So can I watch it with you?",
        "Hunter: Uh, don't you have work or something?",
        "Alison: No. I'm done for the day.",
        "Hunter: Uh, Casey?",
        "Alison: Uh, he's sticking close to home for now. So come on. Move over. Thank you.",
        "[Hunter clears throat]",
        "Alison: Oh. Here comes the good part.",
        "Hunter: Tell me about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I've spent hours on this. I have now personally searched every square inch of the hospital's fertility labs storage facility, and those eggs are not there.",
        "Emily: Are you sure?",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "Emily: Okay, fine, you're sure.",
        "Susan: And I got out all the old paper files out of -- out of cold storage -- your files and mine. And there's plenty of documentation about you -- you donating the eggs, me getting pregnant with Alison, etc., etc.",
        "Emily: And nothing about the storage, where they might have been moved or --",
        "Susan: Nothing.",
        "Emily: What?!",
        "Susan: Nothing.",
        "Emily: How are we gonna find them?!",
        "Susan: I got so frustrated, I even called Larry, thinking he might remember some detail I forgot.",
        "Emily: Larry? What did he say?",
        "Susan: Typical Larry. He never called me back.",
        "Emily: You think he knows something?",
        "Susan: Honey, don't get your hopes up. What would he know about a bunch of frozen eggs when he never even paid attention to his actual daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Hunter: Oh. Hey, it's your dad.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Hi.",
        "Larry: Hi.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Larry: Hi. Nice to see you, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Uh, what are you doing in town?",
        "Larry: Actually, I got a rather intriguing phone call from your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Maybe you should try calling Larry again.",
        "Susan: I'm not chasing down Larry McDermott. One call is my limit.",
        "Emily: Come on! Mom!",
        "Susan: I know him. He will think all is forgiven, and it isn't.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but if it's gonna help me out, it's the least you can do as my mother!",
        "Susan: I'm not calling him again. And -- and you could stop popping in here every 15 minutes to lecture me on what I need to be doing. Maybe you need to face reality.",
        "Emily: You know what? If we can't find my eggs, then I'll have to just come up with another option.",
        "Susan: Or maybe you can just forget about trying to have a baby.",
        "Emily: I knew -- I knew this was gonna come -- have you ever once been on my side, Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Be warned. Your mom's trying a new recipe for dinner.",
        "Casey: Oh, no! After last time --",
        "Margo: Come on, come on! I apologize for that! Now, listen, I hope that you and Riley are hungry, 'cause this recipe calls for a mountain of food.",
        "[Casey clears throat]",
        "Casey: Maybe you should, uh, read this before you start cooking.",
        "Tom: What is this?",
        "Margo: Riley's gone? I don't understand. Why would he go?",
        "Casey: Who knows how the guy's mind works.",
        "Margo: What did you say to him?",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Margo: I don't believe you.",
        "Tom: Whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Margo: What did you do? Did you ask him to leave?",
        "Casey: No. I -- I made a suggestion, you know?",
        "Margo: A \"suggestion\"?",
        "Casey: Yeah. He's been here for a while, and I think it was time for him to move on.",
        "Margo: You had no right to do that.",
        "Tom: Calm down. Now, can't we just discuss this?",
        "Margo: Riley was our guest.",
        "Casey: Um, your guest.",
        "Margo: Why did you tell him to leave?",
        "Casey: Mom, the guy showed up to pay a condolence call, and the next thing you know, he's like moving in.",
        "Margo: So, what does that have to do with anything?",
        "Casey: He did what he came to do! Why was he still hanging around?",
        "Margo: Because I invited him! I wanted him here!",
        "Casey: But why?",
        "Margo: Are you -- are you hearing this?",
        "Tom: Yeah. Casey should have handled this better, but there's nothing we can do about it now.",
        "Casey: Dad -- Dad, admit it. You wanted him gone. You thought he was creepy, too.",
        "Tom: Hey, don't speak for me, Case.",
        "Margo: You have no idea what you've just done.",
        "Casey: I got our lives back -- back the way it was before Riley showed up.",
        "Margo: Your brother is dead. Our lives are never gonna be the way they were. Don't you get that?",
        "Casey: Yes, I do. But Riley being here wasn't gonna make anything better.",
        "Margo: Riley was Adam's friend! He was the only contact I had with my son in years! I wanted to talk to him! I wanted to know him!",
        "Casey: Yes, and you did, for days, Mom.",
        "Margo: That wasn't enough.",
        "Casey: Well, what can I say? He's gone.",
        "Margo: What is it, Casey? What -- what are you -- why are you so bothered by Riley?",
        "Casey: He didn't bother me.",
        "Margo: No. Obviously, you've got some kind of issue with him.",
        "Tom: Casey already explained why he did what he did. Can't we just table the discussion for now?",
        "Margo: You know what I walked in on the other day? Casey was challenging Riley to assemble this gun.",
        "Tom: Why?",
        "Casey: For Noah's movie!",
        "Margo: Riley didn't even want to touch that gun. But no, Casey, you kept harping on him and harping on him and harping on him, as if to say that he was lying about being in the army.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe he is a liar! Even Noah had doubts about this guy.",
        "Tom: What kind of doubts?",
        "Margo: Oh, now you're buying into this, too?",
        "Casey: No, Noah thought, you know, Riley was a little chill for a guy who came back from a war zone.",
        "Tom: Hardly seems like a good enough reason to question a person's credibility.",
        "Margo: No, it isn't.",
        "Casey: But we don't even know who this guy really is! You know, we open our house to him, our whole lives to him, and what do we get in return? A few stories about Adam.",
        "Margo: Those few stories gave me peace, Casey -- more peace than I've had in years.",
        "Casey: Well, what can I say, Mom? I'm not allowed to have a reaction? I had a gut feeling about this guy. Just things didn't add up about him, so yeah, I made him move along.",
        "Margo: Well, that wasn't your right. That wasn't your call.",
        "Casey: Well, I did, and I'm not sorry for it.",
        "Margo: You should be. Because Riley served in that war. What have you done? You haven't been grateful for anything. You have been arrogant and selfish, and you should be ashamed of yourself.",
        "Casey: Are we done here?",
        "Margo: No, we're not -- not until you go to the bus station, and you find him, and you apologize to him.",
        "Casey: No. No, I will not do that!",
        "Margo: Bring him home!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I can't believe my mom called you. Was it about me?",
        "Larry: Oh, not at all, no.",
        "Alison: Maybe that's what she said on the phone. But I know my mom hasn't been exactly thrilled that we've been in touch.",
        "Hunter: Did she say that?",
        "Alison: Uh, what she said is that she thinks it's good that my dad's back in my life.",
        "Hunter: Well, hey, that sounds nice.",
        "Alison: Yeah, what my mom says is not always what she means?",
        "Hunter: Oh.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Larry: Well, I can't blame Susan for being skittish about me. But I'm more concerned about how you feel.",
        "Alison: I'm coming around.",
        "Larry: Good. Because, Alison, I guarantee, I have seen the error of my ways. I will never neglect you again.",
        "Alison: That's good to hear.",
        "Hunter: Are you saying that, or do you mean it?",
        "Larry: What? I mean it.",
        "Alison: But, uh, you won't tell me why my mom called you?",
        "Larry: No. It's nothing for you to worry about, I promise. But I -- I couldn't come to town without stopping by -- you know, checking in and saying hi.",
        "Alison: How'd you know I'd be at Al's?",
        "Larry: You mentioned it in an e-mail that you like to stop by this place after work.",
        "Alison: You remembered?",
        "Larry: I remember everything that's important to me. Just promise me that you'll keep writing.",
        "Alison: Sure. We've got a lot of catching up to do.",
        "Larry: Oh. And speaking of catching up, I have to catch up with your mother. Um, you should come up and visit soon. I'll take you out for a real Chicago steak dinner.",
        "Alison: I'd like that.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Larry: You should come along, too. You know, actually, I owe you quite a bit. You're the one who nudged Alison to give me a second chance.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Hunter: That sounds great.",
        "Alison: Uh, and -- and what about Casey?",
        "Larry: Oh. Bring the boyfriend along, of course. Can't leave him out, can we?",
        "Alison: Okay. Thank you. He'll love that.",
        "Larry: Um, well, it's -- it's good to see you and, um -- well, see you soon.",
        "Hunter: Going to cry?",
        "Alison: It's, uh -- it's just a lot to get used to. I've resented him for so long, and -- and now, because of you, I have a father again.",
        "Hunter: You like him?",
        "Alison: I'm starting to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Can you at least be happy for me?",
        "[Susan scoffs]",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. At the very least, could you be a little excited that I want to have a baby?",
        "Susan: I have spent half my day trying to track down your donated eggs. Can't that be enough?",
        "Emily: You don't think I'm a good mother.",
        "Susan: Honey, I think you're a great mother! But -- but having a baby isn't gonna stop the clock from ticking.",
        "Emily: Do you think?",
        "Susan: It's not gonna stop Daniel from, uh, going to college and growing up and leaving home.",
        "Emily: I never thought it would.",
        "Susan: Or you from going gray or newspapers from going to cyberspace or some hot, young editor from replacing you --",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa. You think that's what this is about? You think this is about Hunter or -- or my job or my vanity?!",
        "Susan: At least partly. Isn't it about those things? Or else why in the world would you be thinking of having a baby at this point in your life?",
        "Emily: Daniel was an accident. I never saw that pregnancy coming. And when I -- when I found out I was pregnant, I was happier about being pregnant with Tom's child so I could stick it to Margo than I was about my own baby.",
        "Susan: I'm happy to hear you admit that you're not the world's most traditional mother.",
        "Emily: Well, I wasn't that. And don't get me wrong. I'm grateful to Tom and Margo for doing most of the heavy lifting with Daniel, because he's a wonderful kid. And I know that that's mostly because of them, not because of me.",
        "Susan: So you think you can do better with another child.",
        "Emily: I'm not conducting my own experiment here. I'm -- I'm not the same person I was back then. I've changed, Mom. I've grown up, and I'm standing here with wisdom and -- and patience and unconditional love and -- I know there's a child out there, waiting to come into this world -- I know it -- my child. And -- and I want to meet him or her and have the chance to be a mom -- a real, good mom. Is that so wrong?",
        "Susan: No. And -- and I felt that way myself. That's -- that's why I had Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, what are we waiting for?",
        "Hunter: What?",
        "Alison: The jellyfish people. The movie.",
        "Hunter: Oh. Right.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hunter: This is the nursing home. I should take this.",
        "Alison: Of course.",
        "Hunter: Hello. Yes. All right. I'll be right over.",
        "Alison: What happened?",
        "Hunter: My mother is acting very agitated today and not making much sense. They were hoping I could stop by.",
        "Alison: Maybe if she sees you, it will help her calm her down.",
        "Hunter: Possible, I guess.",
        "Alison: Well, I'll go with you.",
        "Hunter: Well, the last time you took that long drive, you just ended up waiting. I can't ask you to do that again.",
        "Alison: You're not asking. I'm offering. Besides, you brought my father back into my life. The least I can do is help you with your mother. So you're stuck with me.",
        "[Hunter chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, what are these exactly?",
        "Susan: Our next step in finding your missing eggs. Larry.",
        "Larry: Susan, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: What are you doing here?",
        "Larry: You called. Nice to see you.",
        "Emily: You too.",
        "Susan: You -- you came all the way here because I called?",
        "Larry: Well, and it gave me a chance to spend a little time with Alison. I trust you have no problem with me spending time with her.",
        "Susan: Of course not. It's long overdue.",
        "Larry: Well, good. Then we're in agreement.",
        "Susan: That's why you came here -- because you want to look like a good guy and show off for Alison.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? I personally don't care why he's here. I'm just glad you are. I -- I assume you know what Mom and I are trying to do here.",
        "Larry: Retrieve those donated eggs from when Alison was conceived.",
        "Emily: Exactly. Any idea where they are?",
        "Larry: I have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Uh, where are you going?",
        "Margo: I'm gonna go clean up this mess.",
        "Tom: No, no. It's done. We can't get Riley back now.",
        "Margo: I can. If you're not gonna make up to him, I will do it for you.",
        "Casey: Why is this guy so important? You don't know anything about him. You -- you want to believe he was Adam's best friend, but you don't even have proof that he even met Adam! He could be a con artist or some thief or something.",
        "Margo: He's none of those things.",
        "Casey: Maybe or maybe not, but I know for damn sure he's not your dead son.",
        "Margo: You know nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Larry: You know, I have to confess, I never really thought about what would happen to those eggs once Susan actually got pregnant. I assumed they would be here at Memorial.",
        "Susan: Me too. But they're not. So, uh, you came all the way here just to tell us that you can't help us?",
        "Larry: I'm more than willing to do whatever it is I can do to help you. If you want, I can help you look through the facility in case the eggs were misplaced somehow.",
        "Susan: I've already done that.",
        "Larry: You know, a lot could have happened. They could have gotten lost in the system. They could have been -- they could have been disposed of accidentally.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I don't want to think about that.",
        "[Larry sighs]",
        "Larry: Look, I'm gonna be here for a couple more hours. If you can think of anything I can do --",
        "Susan: You have more plans with Alison?",
        "Larry: Actually, I'm going to the Lakeview to meet a colleague from Oakdale University. And, Emily, if you decide to try to get pregnant in another way, I can make some good recommendations.",
        "Emily: Thanks. Thanks for coming.",
        "Larry: Wish I could be more help.",
        "[Susan groans]",
        "Emily: Well, that's that.",
        "Susan: Oh, no, no, no. We have -- we have all these paper files.",
        "Emily: What is this anyway?",
        "Susan: Shipping and receiving from the year I was pregnant with Alison and a couple of years after that.",
        "Emily: Shipping and receiving?",
        "Susan: I figured if, uh, those eggs left the hospital, then there's got to be a piece of paper tracking it.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Susan: But I haven't had time to look, and I've got to go see a patient.",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa. There's like 1,000 pages to go through here.",
        "Susan: At least.",
        "Emily: Well, I might as well start digging in now, because I am not giving up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Is that your mother?",
        "Hunter: Uh-huh.",
        "Alison: She doesn't look very agitated right now.",
        "Hunter: No. She's really quiet. It's so not like her.",
        "Alison: She's beautiful.",
        "Hunter: Wish you would have met her a few weeks ago. She never would have let anyone see her looking like that. She never would have had that vacant look on her face, and she definitely wouldn't say crazy things to me about my father not being my father.",
        "Alison: She had a stroke, Hunter. Of course she's not herself. Do you want me to go talk to the nurse, see what's going on?",
        "Hunter: That would be so great, Alison. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aurora: You're here! You're finally here! I've been waiting for you!",
        "Hunter: Hello, Mother. How are you doing?",
        "Nurse: We're doing fine, aren't we, Aurora?",
        "Aurora: We are not fine! Leave us alone so we can talk.",
        "Nurse: I'll be right over there.",
        "Aurora: Darling, you have to get me out of here.",
        "Hunter: Mom, I don't think that's possible right now.",
        "Aurora: You can't just hide me away. I'll keep my end of the bargain. I swear, no one will know about us. But please, don't force me to stay here.",
        "Hunter: No one's forcing you to stay here. But if you're gonna get better --",
        "Aurora: This hospital is a travesty. The incompetence is appalling. I swear, Tristan, if you make me stay here, I'll die.",
        "Hunter: \"Tristan\"? Mom, I don't know any Tristan.",
        "Aurora: Don't play with me, Darling. I know who you are. You! What are you trying to do?! Get her out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Did you find something?",
        "Emily: Hi. Uh, I -- I don't know, actually. Um, where did Larry say he was going? To meet a friend at Oakdale U. Or --",
        "Susan: He's meeting a colleague from there at -- at the, uh, Lakeview. Why? What did you find?",
        "Emily: I'm not sure. I'll, um -- I'll explain later.",
        "Susan: Uh --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why didn't you back me up with Mom? You -- you wanted him gone as much as I did.",
        "Tom: I never said that!",
        "Casey: You didn't have to. I saw it, the way you watched him -- the way you watched him with Mom!",
        "Tom: You and I had an agreement. We were gonna be supportive and -- and wait this thing out.",
        "Casey: I know, I know, but I couldn't.",
        "Tom: You couldn't what? You couldn't just take a little more time?",
        "Casey: Adam is my brother, and this guy, Riley, is using him! Adam is dead, okay? And what are we left with? Sergeant Riley Morgan, some guy who's sleeping in Adam's room, likes the same food Adam does, makes Mom act the same way Adam did. But he's not Adam! He's not!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: How'd you find me?",
        "Margo: I'm a detective.",
        "Riley: And you thought the first place that I'd stop would be a bar?",
        "Margo: Well, that's where I would go if I found out I had to wait for my bus.",
        "Riley: Next bus to where?",
        "Margo: Where else? L.A.",
        "Riley: Either I talk too much or you're too smart.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not very bright. But you have to use your words a bit better, because that note was spare.",
        "Riley: I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to say good-bye. I hate good-byes.",
        "Margo: Then don't leave.",
        "Riley: I got to.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Riley: Because I like you, Margo, a lot. And I appreciate your kindness and your hospitality.",
        "Margo: But?",
        "Riley: No buts.",
        "Margo: Listen, you know what? You don't have to cover for Casey. I know that he asked you to leave.",
        "Riley: Casey's got this thing about me.",
        "Margo: Yeah, he does. He thinks that we don't know you well enough. He thinks that maybe you're scamming us or you're fake. Are you?",
        "Riley: You know why I joined the army?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Riley: I got laid off. I was working at an electronics store, doing installations, and it went out of business. [Riley sighs] There was no work in town. My parents were dead. So I decided to do something big and try to restart my life.",
        "Margo: Did it work?",
        "Riley: Well, until after Adam died. [Riley sighs] See, Adam was trying to restart his life, too. And just when he was starting to figure things out, he got killed.",
        "Margo: So then you made it your mission to do what Adam couldn't do.",
        "Riley: I told you before, I didn't really know him that well. But he was trying to make amends, and he loved his family. I respected that, Margo. And then when I met you guys, I felt really bad that Adam never came home.",
        "Margo: But still, Riley, you've got no place to go.",
        "Riley: I can't go home with you.",
        "Margo: Why? 'Cause of Casey?",
        "Riley: He doesn't want me there.",
        "Margo: Why don't you let me handle Casey?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm not taking back what I said. Just the way I said it.",
        "Tom: Then we have a problem.",
        "Casey: You and I?",
        "Tom: Yeah. See, Adam's dead, so it's not just your loss, Casey. It's mine, too.",
        "Casey: I know you loved him.",
        "Tom: What? Just because he wasn't my biological child? You know, at your age, time just stretches out. You go from event to event, you know? You have a date with your girlfriend, concert tickets, movies. But when you're my age, time is a blur. It's not about the event. It's about how it felt.",
        "Casey: I --",
        "Tom: Hold on. I'm -- I'm proud of Adam. I was frustrated by him, crazy with worry about him, but bound to him forever.",
        "Casey: I wasn't trying to say he wasn't important to you.",
        "Tom: You don't get it, Case. Until you have a child of your own, you'll never understand how bottomless and relentless love is.",
        "Casey: And that's why you and I have a problem?",
        "Tom: Yeah. Even though we're devastated by Adam's death, we have no idea the kind of pain that your mom is in.",
        "Casey: And if she's covering up her feelings, hiding them in Riley, won't that make it worse later?",
        "Tom: She smiled at me today, Casey. We were joking about her cooking. I mean, it's the first time since Adam's death that I finally was able to realize how Riley was helping her through this, and it made me thankful.",
        "Casey: And then I sent him away.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, you know what? You should have just let it go. We said we were gonna try to let this thing pass. You should have trusted that. You should have trusted me.",
        "Casey: And what if Riley turns out to be a fake, or worse?",
        "Tom: Then we handle it. I don't know what you and I will do if we lose your mother now, not to Riley, but to grief.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know, Riley, you came here to honor Adam, and I would like you to stay for the same reason.",
        "Riley: I don't think I understand you.",
        "Margo: I had plenty of opportunities to find Adam. I just didn't do it.",
        "Riley: You didn't know where he was.",
        "Margo: Well, I could have tracked him down. Now that he's gone, I can't make that up to him, but I can help his friend, if you'll let me.",
        "Riley: Let me ask you something.",
        "Margo: Sure.",
        "Riley: Did Casey have a problem with Adam? Did the two of them get along?",
        "Margo: Casey and Adam had a -- a big falling out at the end there. Adam did some pretty unforgivable things. I mean, at least we thought they were unforgivable at the time.",
        "Riley: And before that?",
        "Margo: Before that, Casey adored him. I guess that's why it hurts so much when he felt that Adam had betrayed his trust.",
        "Riley: Is that why Casey hates me -- because I'm a friend of Adam's?",
        "Margo: He doesn't hate you. He doesn't even know you.",
        "Riley: Neither do you, not really. I mean, why do you trust me when your son doesn't?",
        "Margo: I'm a cop. I trust my instincts.",
        "Riley: I appreciate that. And I might be tempted -- real tempted. But, I mean, I already bought my ticket.",
        "Margo: Oh. Okay. You know, Riley, you still don't have anyplace to go.",
        "Riley: No place that feels like home.",
        "Margo: I know a place.",

        "Hunter: There's no need to be upset.",
        "Aurora: Why did you bring her here?",
        "Hunter: She's my friend. Her name's Alison. She came with me last time to see you, but this time, she wanted to meet you.",
        "Aurora: Don't you think I know who she is, Tristan? You had no right to bring her here.",
        "Hunter: Mom, listen to me. My name isn't Tristan. I'm your son. Don't you recognize me? And -- and Alison isn't -- whoever you think she is.",
        "Aurora: Why are you lying to me, Darling? Don't you know how much you mean to me?",
        "Hunter: I'm not lying.",
        "Aurora: Don't insult me or my intelligence. I know who she is.",
        "Alison: Hunter, its okay.",
        "Aurora: It's not okay! I don't want you here! Just go!",
        "Alison: Okay, of course I'll go. I'm -- I'm sure you want your privacy.",
        "Nurse: Maybe it would be better if you both go.",
        "Hunter: Mom, I'll see you again soon, okay?",
        "Aurora: Don't leave, Tristan. No, don't abandon me here with these people. They're incompetent, Tristan!",
        "Hunter: They're taking good care of you, Mom.",
        "Aurora: Tristan, don't! Come back! Tristan!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, Larry. Glad I caught you. I didn't want to interrupt your meeting.",
        "Larry: Oh, you didn't. Listen, my guy doesn't come for a few more minutes. You're, uh, more than welcome to join us.",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no. No thanks. I just, uh -- I actually wanted to show you something. I -- I ran across something that was misfiled with some other -- other things dating back to when Ali was conceived.",
        "Larry: What is it?",
        "Emily: Well, um, it's actually a receipt from the University of Chicago hospital for my donor eggs transferred from Memorial.",
        "Larry: Oh. Well, that solves one part of the mystery. But why would they go to the University of Chicago of all places?",
        "Emily: Well, actually, I was hoping you could answer that question. Look, that's your signature. You said you didn't think twice about my eggs after my mom was pregnant with Alison.",
        "Larry: I didn't.",
        "Emily: Well, then, how do you explain this receipt?",
        "Larry: I have absolutely no recollection of signing this document.",
        "Emily: But that is your signature.",
        "Larry: Well, I can't swear to it. I mean, anybody could sign my name.",
        "Emily: Why would they do that?",
        "Larry: I honestly don't know, Emily, nor do I know why anyone at the University of Chicago hospital would want these eggs. Unless --",
        "Emily: Unless what?",
        "Larry: Well, this was cutting-edge medicine at the time. More people wanted donor eggs than there were donors. There was some black-market activity.",
        "Emily: What? You think someone stole my eggs?",
        "Larry: I think it's entirely possible that someone obtained your eggs illegally, signed my name to cover their tracks.",
        "Emily: What, you're saying we're dealing with a forgery here?",
        "Larry: Look, all I can say is I don't remember anything about this, and -- and I can't think of any reason why I would do this.",
        "Emily: It had to be you, Larry. This is your signature. It -- it was you, or you're somehow connected to the person who signed it.",
        "Larry: Emily, Emily, I am not the bad guy here, if there even is a bad guy. I know Susan still thinks of me that way. She may have passed it on to you. But let me assure you, I have done nothing wrong here.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have accused you like that. I just -- I don't understand this. What happened to my eggs? And if they're gone, where does that leave me?",
        "Larry: If your eggs are gone, it doesn't mean you have to give up hope of having a baby. There are other methods. I was sincere when I offered my help with it. Of course, there's always adoption.",
        "Emily: Yeah. No, I, uh -- I haven't wrapped my head around that one yet. Thanks. I'll see you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Who is Tristan? Is that someone she knew?",
        "Hunter: Not personally. But my mother was an opera freak. She listened to this opera, \"Tristan and Isolde,\" constantly. Maybe that's where she got the name.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it sounded like she was talking to a lover. Don't you think?",
        "Larry: I don't know. It's bizarre to think of my mother like that.",
        "Alison: Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe this Tristan guy isn't real. But it sounded like he was someone that your mother had kept a really big secret with.",
        "Hunter: No. I -- I don't see it. My mom -- my mom didn't have lovers.",
        "Alison: How do you know?",
        "Hunter: I never saw any.",
        "Alison: She could have been discreet.",
        "Hunter: Impossible! All my mother ever thought about was protein synthesis, polypeptide gene mutations, and me, in that order.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, maybe this guy, Tristan, was someone from way back, like before you were even born.",
        "Hunter: What if Tristan was my father -- my -- my real father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: We're back.",
        "Tom: Hey. How you doing, Riley?",
        "Riley: I'm good, thanks.",
        "Margo: Well, fortunately, I found Riley before the bus took off, and it took a while, but I persuaded him that he could stay here as long as he wants.",
        "Riley: As long as that's okay with everybody.",
        "Margo: Oh, it will be, won't it, Casey? Because not only was he Adam's friend, but Riley spent the last two years serving this country, and I think the least we can do is extend our hospitality.",
        "Tom: Well -- well, of course we will. Welcome back, Riley.",
        "Riley: Thanks, Tom. You guys have been -- have been great to me. I -- I promise I'm gonna try to be worthy of your mom and dad's generosity.",
        "Casey: That's good. Excuse me. I'm gonna get some fresh air.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: All right. I'm gonna go talk to him.",
        "Tom: Uh, no, no, no, no. We're gonna just let this go. I need two -- two minutes. Will you just, uh, excuse us for the two minutes? Thanks.",
        "Margo: We'll be right back.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: That certainly looks like Larry's signature.",
        "Emily: Well, if he signed it, he certainly doesn't remember signing it.",
        "Susan: Larry McDermott has a mind like a steel trap. He's never forgotten anything in his whole life, especially not anything this important.",
        "Emily: What are you saying? Do you think he's lying?",
        "Susan: It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Emily: But why? I mean, what would he have wanted with a bunch of my unused donor eggs?",
        "Susan: I wish I knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Maybe this whole idea of Tristan as my real father is just plain crazy.",
        "Alison: Or not.",
        "Hunter: It's just so hard to figure out what's true. And I can't ask the woman who's supposed to be my mother.",
        "Alison: Right. You've always said that your mother's been very rational.",
        "Hunter: She's a scientist. She believes in formulas and logic.",
        "Alison: So maybe all this Tristan stuff is just your mom being herself.",
        "Hunter: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Well, maybe in some confused way, your mom is still trying to problem- solve -- you know, to give you information that will help you figure out who your real father is.",
        "Hunter: There's no way to know one way or another, so I -- I think the best thing is just to forget the whole thing.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but isn't it better to know for sure what the truth is? If your father is alive somewhere, wouldn't you want to try and find him?",
        "Hunter: No. If I do have a real, live father out there, he's made no effort to see me. Why should I make an effort to see him? I don't care who he is.",
        "Alison: Tell the truth, Hunter. Isn't there just a little bit of your mom inside you? You know, all that logic and -- and problem-solving stuff? Isn't there just a little bit in you that can't resist trying to figure this out?",
        "Hunter: A little, I suppose.",
        "Alison: Then you should find out if you have a father out there somewhere.",
        "Hunter: Okay. You talked me into it. But you have to help me find him.",
        "Alison: Of course I will. That was a given.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Hunter: Alison, I've never met anyone like you before.",
        "Alison: No offense, but I have never met anyone like you, either.",
        "Hunter: Alison, you get me. I hardly know you, and it seems like you know everything about me.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Alison: Casey --",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey. You need help getting dinner started?",
        "Margo: No. I think we got it covered.",
        "Tom: Where -- where's, uh, Casey?",
        "Riley: I think he went for a walk.",
        "Margo: Don't worry. He'll be back.",
        "Riley: I hope so. 'Cause I'm not going anywhere. I wouldn't dare try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So Riley left?",
        "Casey: Yeah. But my mom talked him into coming back.",
        "Alison: Then you walked out?",
        "Casey: I did not want to stay there. I just wanted to see you. Can -- can we get out of here?",
        "Alison: I was kind of in the middle of something with Hunter.",
        "Casey: Well, can you get rid of him? I just want some alone time with you.",
        "Alison: Okay. Be right back. Hunter --",
        "Hunter: You're going?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I meant what I said. I really want to help you with this.",
        "Hunter: Don't feel obligated or anything.",
        "Alison: No. I don't. I'm your friend. So we'll get to work on the father hunt tomorrow.",
        "Hunter: Sure. Whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, how rude am I?! I've got you doing all this work, and you haven't even had a chance to unpack your bag.",
        "Riley: I can get it later.",
        "Tom: Uh, no, no. You know what? Go ahead and unpack now. I'll help Margo with dinner.",
        "Riley: All right. I'll hurry back.",
        "Tom: Are you okay?",
        "Margo: Oh, Honey, how many times are you gonna ask me that?",
        "Tom: Until I get a straight answer. I mean, you were pretty intense with Casey earlier and when you got back, too.",
        "Margo: He was out of line.",
        "Tom: Absolutely he should not have asked Riley to leave. But you got to try to not be so angry with him. He's still trying to figure this situation out, too. And by the way, he does love you.",
        "Margo: I know. I know that. I was just frustrated and hurt and lost.",
        "Tom: \"Lost\"?",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Margo: I don't know why, Baby, but I need this. I need this so much. I need this.",
