        "Katie: That's \r\nher. ",
        "Simon: All \r\nright, great. So, I'll wait here. And you go talk to her. ",
        "Katie: I just \r\nfeel bad, Simon. I was kind of a flake. I mean, I always left here to go \r\nsomewhere, or do something. And they always let me have my job back. And now I'm \r\njust gonna quit? Maybe we should do this another time. ",
        "Simon: No, no, \r\nno, no. Listen. Listen. I know you're really nervous about this move. But, trust \r\nme; it's the best thing for both of us. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, \r\nthat's what I keep telling myself. ",
        "Simon: You \r\nreally liked this job, huh? ",
        "Katie: Well, I \r\nonly took it because I needed to pay the bills. But -- yeah, after a while, I \r\ndid kind of like it. I felt useful, at least, you know, like I was helping \r\npeople. ",
        "Simon: Okay, \r\nlisten. Don't tell anyone. But there are hospitals in Australia, okay? \r\n",
        "Katie: No! \r\nYou're kidding! ",
        "Simon: No, I'm \r\nnot. ",
        "Katie: Wish me \r\nluck. ",
        "Simon: I'll do \r\nbetter than that. ",
        "Katie: Oh, it's \r\na good thing I'm quitting, because that could've just gotten me fired. \r\n",
        "[Simon thinking \r\nback] ",
        "Simon: You sent \r\nher to the looney bin. She's never going to forget that. ",
        "Pilar: Yeah, \r\nbut if you talk to mike -- ",
        "Simon: What? \r\nTalk to Michael -- and say what? ",
        "Pilar: That \r\nKatie\u2019s too embarrassed to admit she made a big mistake blaming him -- \r\n",

        "Simon: Hey, \r\nlisten man -- you know Mike Kasnoff? The construction guy? ",
        "Orderly: Seen \r\nhim around. ",
        "Simon: Yeah, \r\nyou know where he might be now? ",
        "Orderly: Sorry.\r\n",
        "Simon: All \r\nright, thanks. ",

        "Katie: I know I \r\nwas supposed to start working again tomorrow. Um -- but there's been a change of \r\nplans. My husband and I are leaving Oakdale for good. ",

        "Hal: Okay, I \r\nwant a chopper in the air, dogs on the ground. Call CSI; tell them to get over \r\nhere right away. You okay, Craig? ",
        "Craig: Hal, I \r\ncame here expecting to find my kidnapped daughter and all we have is a towel \r\nwith blood on it. No, I'm not \"okay.\" ",
        "Hal: Listen, \r\nit's best if we don't jump to conclusions right now. ",
        "Alan: You're \r\nsure that blood was fresh, Lieutenant? ",
        "Hal: Yeah, I'm \r\nsure. But it could've been anybody\u2019s. ",
        "Craig: \r\nIncluding Lucy\u2019s. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Well, if \r\nyou didn't tell those guys where I was, how did they find me? ",
        "Dusty: Why \r\nwould I tell those guys, if I came back here to get you outta here? ",
        "Lucy: I don't \r\nknow. Maybe you -- I don't know why! ",
        "Dusty: You \r\ndon't know? I'm not convincing you! Don't give me that. Don't give me that look. \r\nI'm not very happy to be here with you, either. You know? But we're in this. And \r\nnow I gotta keep you with me until I figure what's going on. ",
        "Lucy: What if I \r\ndon't want to get in the car with you? ",
        "Dusty: Then \r\nthat's up to you. Whatever. You gotta give me an answer. You gotta give me an \r\nanswer. I gotta get outta here! ",

        "Jordan: James \r\ndoesn't have any kind of hold on me, Barbara. I'm using him for information.\r\n",
        "Barbara: You're \r\nusing James? Do you have any idea how naive that is? ",
        "Jordan: It's \r\nnot like I asked him to send me this box of cigars. If it makes you feel any \r\nbetter, I'll send it right back. ",
        "Barbara: The \r\nonly thing that would make me feel better is if you give me your solemn word \r\nthat you will never go near him again. ",
        "Jordan: I can't \r\ndo that. Not right now. ",
        "Barbara: Do you \r\nenjoy putting your life in danger? ",
        "Jennifer: He's \r\ndoing it for his son. Stenbeck promised that he would help him find Cabot.\r\n",
        "Barbara: I had \r\nno idea that Cabot was missing. ",
        "Jordan: Rosanna \r\ntook him and left town. No one has any idea where she is. ",
        "Barbara: Good, \r\ngood. Good for her. At least someone around here has the sense to get away from \r\nJames instead of diving into his next trap. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nJordan is Cabot\u2019s father. Rosanna has no right to keep them apart. ",
        "Barbara: I'm \r\njust glad to hear that Rosanna has enough maternal instinct to want to protect \r\nthat baby. And that means she'll keep grandpapa James away from him for good.\r\n",
        "Jordan: \r\nProtecting Cabot is my job, too. And I'm not going to have Rosanna deciding \r\nwhether I can do that or not, Barbara. ",
        "Barbara: Having \r\nCabot in your life means having James Stenbeck in your life. And there's nothing \r\nthat he loves more than fresh meat. He will get his hooks into that baby so \r\nfast, it'll make your head spin. So instead of being angry with Rosanna, I \r\nsuggest you thank her. ",
        "",
        "James: When the \r\nguard told me my son was here to see me, I was hoping it was going to be Jordan.\r\n",
        "Paul: So sorry \r\nto disappoint you. ",
        "James: That's \r\nall right. I'm used to it. You're here to continue our aborted conversation?\r\n",
        "Paul: It wasn't \r\na conversation. You had me thrown out of your prison. ",
        "James: Well, it \r\nwas a special moment for Jordan and me. Our first time together as father and \r\nson. ",
        "Paul: From what \r\nI saw, he wasn't really enjoying himself. ",
        "James: A little \r\n-- period of adjustment. He will soon realize the benefits of having me in his \r\nlife. ",
        "Paul: He might \r\nwant to talk to me about that first. ",
        "James: Ahh, \r\nyou're jealous. How cute. ",
        "Paul: Believe \r\nme, I already have more of your attention than I could ever want. ",
        "James: Yes, and \r\nyet, you couldn't stay away. ",
        "Paul: I'm here \r\nfor one reason. To find out what treachery you and Jordan are cooking up. \r\n",
        "James: \r\nTreachery? A father and son are bonding for the first time after a lifetime of \r\nbeing apart. There are no hidden motives here. Only good things. You know, joy, \r\ndevotion -- ",
        "Paul: You \r\nwaited a long time to spring Jordan on us. You're using him, old man, and I want \r\nto know how. ",

        "Simon: Hello?\r\n",
        "Pilar: It's \r\nPilar. Have you spoken to Mike? ",
        "Simon: Hey, \r\nlisten, I'm working on it, okay? ",
        "Pilar: Where \r\nare you? ",
        "Simon: At the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Pilar: Can you \r\ntalk to him somewhere else? That's not a good place for me. ",
        "Simon: Listen, \r\nwhat difference does it make? ",
        "Pilar: I need \r\nsomewhere where I can \"accidentally\" run into Mike. Right after you tell him \r\nthat Katie has changed her mind about me. ",
        "Simon: Listen, \r\nMike and I are hardly drinking buddies. Okay? You're gonna have to figure \r\nsomething else out. ",

        "James: What \r\ndoes any man want from his son? Except respect and admiration -- ",
        "Paul: Oh, cut \r\nit out. You don't even know what those words mean. ",
        "James: No, but \r\nJordan will. And rather than using him, as you suggest, I'm going to help him.\r\n",
        "Paul: To do \r\nwhat? ",
        "James: Get his \r\nson back. ",
        "Paul: Cabot \r\nbelongs with Rosanna. Rosanna's the only one who can keep him safe from you.\r\n",
        "James: Am I to \r\nunderstand that you're taking the side of that woman against that of your own \r\nfamily? ",
        "Paul: You're \r\nnot my family. ",
        "James: Cabot is \r\nyour family. He's your nephew, and you're allowing a stranger to keep him \r\nprisoner? ",
        "Paul: You think \r\nI know where Rosanna has taken Cabot, don't you? ",
        "James: Oh, no, \r\nshe'd never trust you with that information. She's much too smart. ",
        "Paul: That's a \r\nnice try. You can't trick me into telling you what I don't know. ",
        "James: If you \r\ndid know, would you tell me? ",
        "Paul: Not if \r\nyou held a knife to my throat. ",
        "James: Don't \r\ntempt me. Even from in here, I could -- your problem, Paul, you've never had a \r\nsense of family loyalty. ",
        "Paul: My \r\nloyalty is to anyone who's trying to get away from you. For the record, I curse \r\nthe fact that I am in any way related to you. ",
        "James: Yes, \r\nwell, fortunately, Jordan doesn\u2019t. And as soon as I reunite him with Cabot, \r\nyou'll see. ",
        "Paul: So that's \r\nit, huh? You think you'll own Jordan once \r\nyou get Cabot away from Rosanna? ",
        "James: No, you \r\nsee. Because unlike you, who's thinking is dominated by women, Jordan makes up \r\nhis own mind. Of course, I do expect him to appreciate what I've done for him. \r\nHe wouldn't be my son if he didn\u2019t. ",
        "Paul: I won't \r\nlet you use that baby as a weapon. ",
        "James: Hmm. \r\nBecause it's bad for Cabot? Or it'll upset Rosanna? ",
        "Paul: What are \r\nyou trying to say, Dad? ",
        "James: You \r\ndon't give a damn about Cabot or Jordan. You just want to score points with your \r\nbrother's wife -- the voluptuous and oh-so-tight-skirted Rosanna. ",
        "Paul: You won't \r\nget away with it. If I have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of my life, \r\nI will keep Cabot away from you. ",
        "James: Oh, but \r\nyou'll drift off sometime to never-never land. And I'm at my best under the \r\ncover of darkness. ",
        "Paul: Not this \r\ntime. I've had my fill of you hurting people that are important to me. It stops \r\nnow. Your reign of terror is over. ",
        "James: A little \r\nspirit looks good on you, Paul. Too bad it's been so late in coming. There. Now \r\nthis is good. A little resistance -- increases focus. ",

        "Barbara: I know \r\nyou want to shower your baby with gifts, show him the best that life has to \r\noffer. But I promise you, you will be thwarted at every turn. The harder you \r\ntry, the worse it will get for you and for Cabot. So if you really want to prove \r\nhow much you love this baby, you forget about him. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nYou're a mother of three. I don't understand how you can say that. ",

        "Jennifer: \r\nJordan -- please don't be upset. She was only trying to -- ",
        "Jordan: I know, \r\nI know -- protect me. Protect Cabot. But according to her I have to give up my \r\nson. ",
        "Jennifer: She's \r\nafraid for you. That's all. She doesn't know any other way to keep James out of \r\nyour life. ",
        "Jordan: It \r\ndoesn't matter what her reasons are, Jen. I'm not abandoning my child. All my \r\nlife, I wondered what my father was like. Asking myself, what were the things \r\nthat were important to him? I never got any answers, and it hurt me, Jen. It \r\nmade me anxious and suspicious and afraid to let people see who I really am. And \r\nI'm not gonna let my own son grow up like that, not while I still have a choice.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Just \r\nbe careful, okay? ",
        "Jordan: I know \r\nhow dangerous Stenbeck is. Which is why maybe it's better if we just stay away \r\nfrom each other for a little while. ",
        "Jennifer: Do \r\nyou feel the distance that's between us right now? That's about all I can \r\nhandle. ",
        "Jordan: If \r\nanything were to ever happen to you because of me -- ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nit won\u2019t. It won\u2019t. All that matters right now is finding Cabot. I want you to \r\nconcentrate on that, and don't worry about me. ",
        "Jordan: Cabot \r\nisn't the only important thing here, Jen. You matter to me, too. I love you. I \r\nwant you with me all the time, every minute. ",

        "Lucy: How do \r\nyou know those guys didn't follow us? ",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nknow. That's why I'm gonna go in there and check it out, make sure it's cool. \r\nDon't worry so much, okay? Count to 1,000 or something. I'll be back before -- \r\nbefore 999. ",
