        "Lily: Oh. We should make this a family tradition.",
        "Sierra: What? Sweating to death?",
        "Lily: No, no, not arguing. In the new house, maybe I'll put a Native American sweat lodge in.",
        "Sierra: Oh. Oh. That's exactly what this town needs, isn't it, Mother? A sweat lodge?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Lucinda: I'm light-headed. I gotta get out.",
        "Sierra: Mother, Mother, what's wrong?",
        "Lucinda: Nothing. It's the heat. I'm just feeling a little light-headed.",
        "Sierra: Well, it wasn't turned up very high.",
        "Lily: Sierra's right. I mean, we weren't in there that long. So let's -- just save us the trouble and let's just talk about what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You know, Meg, you're wrong. I wasn't blaming you for your problems with Josh.",
        "Meg: Then what's this?",
        "Emma: It's a cup of tea.",
        "Meg: Not a peace offering?",
        "Emma: Were we at war?",
        "Meg: That's where we left off.",
        "Emma: Oh, come on, baby. Come on now. You just got here. I don't want to send you packing again.",
        "Meg: And I don't want to let you down again, Mama. But that's what I do best. I mean, I see it in your eyes. Out of all your children, no matter how hard I try, I'm the one that can never get things right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is this the right room?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Where's Henry?",
        "Mike: He was supposed to be here.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. He called and asked me to meet him here.",
        "Mike: That was the plan.",
        "Katie: So what are you doing here?",
        "Mike: I was just asking myself that same question.",
        "Katie: You put him up to this, didn't you? At least have the grace to deny it, Mike.",
        "Mike: Look, I was trying to help.",
        "Katie: Well, you didn't help me. You took the one last bit of hope I had for my marriage and you destroyed it. Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Excuse me. What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: Its okay, Deacon.",
        "Barbara: A man of the cloth?",
        "[Jennifer chuckles]",
        "Jennifer: That's his name, Mom. This is my bodyguard. Deacon, this is my Mother, Barbara Ryan.",
        "Barbara: How do you do. Why do you need a bodyguard?",
        "Dusty: It's a precaution.",
        "Barbara: Has Craig tried to hurt you?",
        "Jennifer: No. But Dusty thought that it would be a good way to keep him under control.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't be a fool. We can't control Craig Montgomery. He's out there planning his next move. That's why the three of us have to act fast. We have to find a way to eliminate Craig Montgomery from our lives for once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hello.",
        "Craig: Hello. What does that smile mean?",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's about being a woman who knows what she wants and how to get it.",
        "Craig: And does that mean you're reconsidering my offer?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, your offer. That wasn't an offer that was a marriage proposal. And I'm sorry, Craig, but no. I haven't changed my mind.",
        "Craig: Not yet.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, I don't love you.",
        "Craig: Oh. Okay. You think you love Paul Ryan.",
        "Rosanna: Paul is one of the best men I've ever met.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: And where was he when your world fell apart?",
        "Rosanna: You can't blame him for not being there. I threw him out of my life.",
        "Craig: Yeah, that was the best move you ever made. Baggage you don't need.",
        "Rosanna: And I need?",
        "Craig: You need what we had. You remember, don't you? We knew how to have fun.",
        "Rosanna: Mmm, until one day, we didn't.",
        "Craig: Okay. Okay. So, what's your plan, then? You're gonna bring Paul a fruit basket? Beg his forgiveness?",
        "Rosanna: No. I'm going to use the one person who can get through to Paul better than I can right now -- Emily Stewart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Oh. Thanks, baby.",
        "Emily: I should be thanking you.",
        "Susan: For what?",
        "Emily: For not mentioning the \"H\" word.",
        "Susan: The H -- oh, sweetie. You know how I feel about Hal, and I know how he feels about you. I think you should work it out with him. He's a good man. And there aren't many of them around anymore. Take it from one who knows.",
        "Emily: Okay, your two cents are up. Buh-bye.",
        "Susan: I said the \"H\" word.",

        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Paul: You going someplace?",
        "Emily: Actually, I was coming to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: She is the reason",
        "Craig: So Emily is your ace in the hole?",
        "Rosanna: She has Paul's ear.",
        "Craig: That's an asset?",
        "Rosanna: She is the reason that he won't talk to me. She's making things worse.",
        "Craig: Well, people who hate you tend to do that.",
        "Rosanna: She has no reason to hate me. I'm not the one who tried to ruin her life. That was Barbara.",
        "Craig: She'll say you're changing your story because it's convenient.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Rosanna: My story is the truth.",
        "Craig: Puts Cabot at risk.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I was up all last night thinking about how I could keep Cabot safe, while making Emily understand.",
        "Craig: And?",
        "Rosanna: And, Emily is a Mother. I know she loves her son just as much as I love Cabot, and once I explain to her what I had to do in order to keep James from taking Cabot, she will understand.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: I mean, she was kidnapped and tortured by James as well. I mean, she's gotta understand better than anybody --",
        "Craig: Yes, all right --",
        "Rosanna: -- What he's capable of.",
        "Craig: Even if she buys all of that, do you think she's gonna keep your little secret? She'll go right after Barbara. You're gonna have a major trial, and Cabot will go from his happy, anonymous life to being exhibit a in the media frenzy.",
        "Rosanna: No, I will think of a way to keep Emily from reopening the case, because if she accepts the truth, then Paul will, too.",
        "Craig: If you need Emily to tell Paul that you're the best thing that ever happened to him, then you have problems.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, don't.",
        "Craig: You know, if he loved you at all, he might still want you.",
        "Rosanna: He does want me. He's just very upset right now.",
        "Craig: All right, okay, fine. Go crawling back to Paul. Humiliate yourself. But don't ask me for help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're looking for me, huh? I'm right here. What's going on?",
        "Emily: Actually, I was gonna figure out what I was gonna say on the car ride over.",
        "Paul: Oh. You look great. I missed you.",
        "Emily: Me, too. That doesn't help.",
        "Paul: Okay. So, what can I do that will help?",
        "Emily: Not that, not that.",
        "Paul: Have you talked to Hal?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Paul: No? Why not?",
        "Emily: Because. Okay?",
        "Paul: Did I do something?",
        "Emily: No, I did. I lied to my husband, Paul. You know, I cheated. I broke a promise. I turned into the person that I swore, I promised myself I would never be again.",
        "Paul: Look, I'm all for keeping promises, but that's not something you can do by yourself, believe me. I've learned that first hand.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you know what? Blaming Hal doesn't make it any easier, okay? And using you to forget my problems doesn't. And I don't want to be used because you're still angry at Rosanna.",
        "Paul: I have never used you. Look, okay, I am hurt. And there's no magic pill that I can take that will make me not hurt. But, Emily, making love to you is pretty darn close.",
        "Emily: Come on, we're just ducking reality here.",
        "Paul: Okay. I firmly believe that reality should be ducked whenever you get the chance. Okay, you make me feel more alive than I have felt in a long time. And I'm not -- I'm not ready to walk away from that. And I don't think you are, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, Craig has a lawyer. So what?",
        "Barbara: Well, a custody battle won't be far behind.",
        "Jennifer: He will not take my child.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I bet Jessica's already filing petitions and briefs, and we cannot be caught unprepared.",
        "Dusty: The only way Craig would ever get custody is if a judge declares her incompetent. You understand? It's not gonna happen.",
        "Barbara: He is not going to try to get custody right away. He's gonna go about it incrementally. He will ask for visitation, something innocuous, like a weekend a month.",
        "Jennifer: An hour a month is too much as far as I'm concerned. He will not get anywhere near my child.",
        "Dusty: Craig is a bum. He's got no job. The only thing a judge is gonna see are liabilities.",
        "Barbara: In the meantime, Craig is out there repolishing his image.",
        "Dusty: So, let him. Jen, you're clean, you understand? You got a good career. A good man. A good, strong marriage. Keep it that way. No way a judge is gonna let Craig near your baby. No way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I didn't do this to hurt you. [Katie sighs] All right, you know, let's get out of here.",
        "Katie: And go where?",
        "Mike: I'll take you back to your house.",
        "Katie: No, I don't wanna go back there alone.",
        "Mike: So, maybe Alison will drop by.",
        "Katie: I don't want Alison. I want Henry. But he doesn't want me. And you just gave him another chance to rub my nose in it.",
        "Mike: That's not what happened.",
        "Katie: I just wish I didn't get my hopes up. I finally admitted that it was over.",
        "Mike: And I had to come up with my brilliant plan.",
        "Katie: Just when I made peace with living alone, the phone rang.",
        "Mike: I had no idea Henry was gonna bail on this.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I should have known. You know why? 'Cause I always end up alone. Without Simon, without you, and now Henry makes it unanimous. I should write a book, \"101 ways to get a good man to leave you.\"",
        "Mike: Oh, that's not true.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it is.",
        "Mike: He'll come around.",
        "Katie: Why, 'cause I'm so irresistible?",
        "Mike: 'Cause he loves you.",
        "Katie: Well, sometimes love makes things worse. It makes you do stupid, hurtful things to the one person that you think means the world to you, and then it's too late to fix it.",
        "Mike: Still, you can't live without it.",
        "Katie: Looks like I'm gonna have to.",
        "Mike: Look, no, come on, come on. Hey, it's gonna be okay.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Mike: Please, just don't cry. I hate -- I hate seeing you cry. I always have.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Katie: Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Mike: Why wouldn't I be nice to you?",
        "Katie: Because lately, you're always mad at me.",
        "Mike: Not always, not today. Today, you're mad at me.",
        "Katie: Why did you do all this?",
        "Mike: Because I can see how miserable Henry is. He does love you. You two belong together.",
        "Katie: I'm not so sure.",
        "Mike: Because you had a fight? Love gets tested. Remember, if you stick with it, and have you faith, it will work out.",
        "Katie: You mean like with you and Jen?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Katie: So, what's your secret?",
        "Mike: It's not complicated. I mean, I knew I wanted to be a father and a husband some day. I wanted to raise a family and take care of the people that I love. Jen and I are working on that. We're in a good place.",
        "Katie: Except for the Craig part.",
        "Mike: When I think about the baby, I don't see Craig. No, I see Jen learning to be a good mom. Speaking of which, she's probably wondering where I am, so I --",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go. I'll be fine. I think I actually just might hang out here for a while.",
        "Mike: No, don't do that to yourself.",
        "Katie: Mike, I will be fine. I'll find a tearjerker on the movie channel and maybe order some room service. The room is paid for?",
        "Mike: In advance.",
        "Katie: Good. Great. So, go. I'll be fine.",
        "Mike: Are you sure? All right, I haven't watched a tearjerker in a while, and Jen's probably working late anyways. So, I can stick around for a little bit.",
        "Katie: Mike, you hate sad movies.",
        "Mike: Well, maybe we can watch a comedy or an action movie. Oh, you hate action movies.",
        "Katie: Yeah, no guns, no blood.",
        "Mike: That really limits our options.",
        "Katie: You don't have to stay, you know.",
        "Mike: I know that. We do have some good champagne.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it does look expensive.",
        "Mike: You're worth it.",
        "Katie: Thanks. Ooh.",
        "Mike: Hello. [Katie giggles] To minding our own business.",
        "Katie: Good one.",
        "Mike: Hey, we're in luck. I can have my guns and you can have your tears. They got a western channel.",
        "Katie: You wanna watch a western?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Come on, what do you say?",
        "Katie: All right, let's do it.",
        "Mike: All right.",

        "Meg: You know why I really came home, Mama? This place never changes. It's the one thing that always stays the same, the way I remember it.",
        "Emma: It makes my heart feel good to hear you say that. Oh, my Meggie. My little girl. I love you. I love you. And I'm so sorry, you know, because no matter how old you are, I just can't -- I just can't resist the impulse to fight your battles and fix your problems.",
        "Meg: I wish you could.",
        "Emma: And I wish you were still in that back bedroom all tucked in. And there were always dozens of little footsteps all over the place. Oh, that time just went so, so quickly. But, all these years, what I wanted for your children, for my children, you know what I wanted, is just what I want now. I want you all to sort of make some sense out of this crazy life, and to find -- to find some peace.",
        "Meg: Me, too, Mama. Me, too.",
        "Luke: Grandma, I brought those jars up from -- Aunt Meg?",
        "Meg: You can't be Luke.",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, he can.",
        "Meg: Come here, give me a hug, buddy. Oh, my gosh. I missed you.",
        "Luke: I missed you, too.",
        "Meg: When did you get so tall?",
        "Luke: Are you staying, or --",
        "Meg: Oh, it's just a short visit, if there's room.",
        "Emma: Yes, yes.",
        "Luke: Well, yeah. It's just Dad and Grandma.",
        "Meg: Oh. Holden's staying here?",
        "Emma: Luke, why don't you go and get Meg's things from the car, okay, sweetheart?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. All right, yeah, sure.",
        "Meg: It's open.",
        "Luke: All right, cool.",
        "Meg: Holden's staying here at the farm?",
        "Emma: Yes. He and Lily are having some problems.",
        "Meg: Well, it must be pretty serious if he's moved out. Are they getting a divorce?",
        "Emma: I'm afraid that it looks that way.",
        "Meg: Wow. Everybody thought they were the perfect couple.",
        "Emma: Well, I just keep hoping that things will work out, that things will change.",
        "Meg: How are the kids?",
        "Emma: They're taking it pretty badly, especially Luke.",
        "Meg: I don't believe this. It almost sounds like Holden's made as big a mess of his life as I have.",

        "Lily: Here we go.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's just fine. You do it. But just think about what divorce is going to do to your kids. What it's gonna do -- their chances of having a stable life one day.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, and you, my darling. My little sweetie pie, I've been pulling punches with you. You're worse than she is. You wasted years of your life on that miserable specimen of a man, Craig.",
        "Sierra: You know, those years with Craig gave me two beautiful children. And don't ask me to regret that.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not, darling. I'm just asking you to stand up to your sister's foolishness and not encourage her in running around with this guy. Take care of her! Life isn't a game. You know, you wake up -- you wake up one morning, and you just wonder what you've got to show for things.",

        "Paul: Stop. You answer one question for me. Where -- where has reality gotten us? Because you're living with your Mother. And me, I've had my heart put in a meat grinder. It's no fun for anybody.",
        "Emily: So the answer to everything is good sex?",
        "Paul: Spectacular. Really. Think about it. What, all of a sudden, that's so wrong?",
        "Emily: Don't -- don't do that. Don't put morals in my mouth.",
        "Paul: I'm not. I'm just telling you, Hal -- he's got his head in the station house. And you signed on for his kids, for his ex-wife. You do everything for that man. Everything. And all that you've asked for in return is his unconditional love and his support, and he can't even give you that.",
        "Emily: That's not fair.",
        "Paul: It's the reality. And I'm not even gonna talk to you about my recent run-ins with the reality. It doesn't matter. We both trusted the people we loved and trusted that they wouldn't hurt us, and we both got burned. Ain't love grand? So if we can escape reality for just one brief second, is there really anything wrong with that? Forget about our past, okay? Forget about our future and just be right here with me, Emily, right now.

        "Lucinda: But we know. I mean, we know I've got a cyst.",
        "Dr. Berg: Once the radiologist calls with the results, we'll do a needle biopsy. Now, depending on the size and location, we may opt to remove the lump. The other option, if it's not suspicious in nature, is to leave it alone and keep an eye on things.",
        "Lucinda: I vote for that option.",
