        "Chris: Every now and then, I catch a few stares out of the corner of my eye from some of the nurses. It's not hard to figure out what they're thinking.",
        "Kim: Well, just ignore it.",
        "Chris: Easier said than done, Mom.",
        "Kim: It will all die away once you're cleared of this stupid charge.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I just wish this lawsuit didn't have to go to court.",
        "Bob: Well, unfortunately, it does. And in the meantime, don't you do anything to escalate this situation any further.",
        "Chris: I'll do my best, Dad.",
        "Susan: And you certainly have, haven't you, doctor? Let me tell you something -- after this latest stunt of yours, if you ever go anywhere near alison again, you will be very, very sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, seriously, don't you think it's time you considered putting the old bike out to pasture?",
        "Both: -- Good as new.",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, I know. You have been saying that for years.",
        "Aaron: And I stand by it. What's on your mind?",
        "Alison: What makes you think something's --?",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah. You're -- you're just voluntarily touching greasy bike parts. I mean, you know what that means, huh? You're distracted, which means you've got something going on upstairs.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Just the usual stuff -- work.",
        "Aaron: Yeah? Anything I can do?",
        "Alison: No. It's over now. No, but when it was happening, you know, it just -- it shook me up.",
        "Aaron: And what was happening? Ali, hey --",
        "Alison: The other day, um, Chris and I ended up in the on-call room together. He wanted to talk, and I didn't. But he insisted that I listen, and he wouldn't let me leave.",
        "Aaron: What do you mean he wouldn't let you leave?",
        "Alison: He locked me in.",
        "Aaron: He locked you in the room with him? I'm gonna kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: If you could just let me in. I want to leave these for Ms. Ryan.",
        "Maid: Couldn't you knock?",
        "Sofie: Well, she hasn't been feeling very well, and I -- I don't want to disturb her if she's resting. Look, I -- I know you've seen me with her before. You won't get in trouble, I promise.",
        "Maid: Don't tell anyone I did this.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Meg: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Do you know what he's done?",
        "Chris: I haven't done anything!",
        "Kim: Well, even if he had done something, is this the place you want to discuss it?",
        "Susan: Let 'em stare. I don't care. Tired of keeping quiet!",
        "Bob: About what, exactly?",
        "Susan: About how your son cornered my daughter in the on-call room.",
        "Bob: And why would he do that? He's aware that approaching Alison is off- limits.",
        "Susan: He did more than approach her. He scared the hell out of her.",
        "Chris: I just wanted to talk to her, okay? She had no reason to be afraid of me.",
        "Susan: Well, then, why did you lock the door? Why didn't you let her out when she asked you to? You thought you could intimidate her into dropping her lawsuit. But guess what? It didn't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I guess he thought if he leaned on me, I'd get scared and back down.",
        "Aaron: Did you tell Bonnie?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Aaron: She's your attorney. Why -- why didn't you tell her the second this happened?",
        "Alison: Because it's over now.",
        "Aaron: Well, the hell it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I don't have to listen to this.",
        "Susan: Coward. You forced Alison to listen to you. Now it's your turn. You're just a big bully, aren't you?",
        "Chris: That's not true.",
        "Kim: Susan, they both work in the hospital. They're bound to bump into one another once in a while.",
        "Susan: You can't be that naive.",
        "Bob: All right, Susan. That's enough.",
        "Susan: No, it's not enough. I was there when he finally let her out of that room, and she was so scared.",
        "Chris: No, she was angry.",
        "Susan: Okay, she was angry, too. She had every right to be. And if I could, I would press charges against you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: What's going on?",
        "Meg: I asked you a question. What are you doing here?",
        "Sofie: Well, I -- I just wanted to bring these for Barbara.",
        "Paul: But Mom, you didn't let her in?",
        "Barbara: Of course not.",
        "Sofie: The -- the maid -- she recognized me. She let me in.",
        "Barbara: Well, she had no right to do that. And what makes you think that I would want to see you, let alone accept anything from you?",
        "Sofie: I know, Barbara, I've made terrible, terrible mistakes. But I am so sorry.",
        "Barbara: You think that's all you've done -- made mistakes?! You accused my son of rape. You tried to destroy him.",
        "Paul: Mom --",
        "Sofie: No, no.",
        "Paul: Calm down.",
        "Sofie: She's -- she's right. I did, and -- and I'm so sorry. And if I could do anything for you to forgive me --",
        "Barbara: Forgive you? I want you to get out of here. I don't ever want to see you again. I want you out -- out of here.",
        "Paul: Mom, Mom, you all right? Do you got her medicine?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Barbara: Yeah. I'm fine. What is she doing here? Get her out of here, please.",
        "Paul: Stop. I'll take care of it. You come with me.",
        "Sofie: All right. I didn't mean to upset her, I promise. Please, tell me you believe me.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm gonna give you some morphine for the pain.",
        "Barbara: Do I have to have that now?",
        "Meg: I think it would be best. Why?",
        "Barbara: It just makes me feel so stupid. I -- the morphine -- please. I know my body, and I -- I don't need it now. I just need to rest, okay, Meg?",
        "Meg: I suppose, if you think you can manage, but if the pain gets worse --",
        "Barbara: I'll tell you. I'll tell you, all I need right now is a new lock for that door to keep Sofie Duran out of here.",
        "Paul: Sofie, I know I don't need to tell you this, but coming here -- that was really stupid.",
        "Sofie: I know, I know. I didn't mean to upset her, I promise. I just wanted to apologize.",
        "Paul: Why? You think that's gonna change anything? Especially with my mother.",
        "Sofie: Or Meg. I saw the way she was looking at me.",
        "Paul: I'm not even gonna talk to you about that.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you're right. You're right. I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Paul: Sofie, you can't come here. You need to stay away. Not just for my mother, not just for Meg, but for me, too. You and I, we have nothing to say to one another. Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Bye. It's me. I need to see you right now. Meet me in my room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Don't you two even care that your son has victimized my daughter?",
        "Kim: Nobody at this table sees Alison as a victim.",
        "Susan: Oh, you're saying that Chris is the injured party in all this?",
        "Kim: You're asking me if I think he's been falsely charged? Yes.",
        "Susan: Then you don't have a clue as to who your son really is. I guess I've seen a side to him that he doesn't show you. And it's not pretty. You raised yourself a bully and a liar.",
        "Kim: And you have set such a wonderful example. After all your years of running around, and now you have two daughters who are so desperately insecure, they will say or do anything to get some attention.",
        "Susan: How dare you?",
        "Kim: No! How dare you?! How dare you come marching in here, projecting your failures on my family?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: All that time you spent in Vegas -- you know, what life must have been like for you.",
        "Alison: Oh, the glamorous life of a porn star, you mean? Well, it was, uh -- it was special.",
        "Aaron: Just -- I mean, those guys, not the ones you -- you -- you know, you were with, but the guys that you worked for, how they treated you, how they pushed you around. You know, I wanted all that behind you.",
        "Alison: Aaron, it is.",
        "Aaron: No, it's not, Alison, because what Chris just did to you -- okay, I don't see the difference. He tried to scare you into doing something that he wanted you to do, and -- and you just --",
        "Alison: And he failed. He failed. Look at me, okay? It didn't work.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I'm -- you just deserve a lot better. And I'm sorry Chris Hughes couldn't see that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You have always looked down on me. You've never let go of that one night with Bob. When was that?!",
        "Kim: That has nothing to do with this.",
        "Susan: That has everything to do with this, because you treat my daughters the same way. \"Ooh, the Stewart women. Nobody's safe around them.\"",
        "Kim: That is the point.",
        "Susan: But you know Alison is innocent. You know she's telling the truth, because you would have never come to me the way you did. You would have never asked me to convince her to drop this lawsuit.",
        "Kim: I came to you hoping that possibly we could avoid the embarrassment that you seem so determined to inflict.",
        "Susan: I'm not embarrassed. I'm with my daughter 100%! And no amount of pressure from you or you or you is gonna make us fold. Enjoy your lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, I want you to promise me something.",
        "Aaron: What's that?",
        "Alison: I want you to stay away from Chris. I'm serious, Aaron. I know you, how you get. I don't want you going after him.",
        "Aaron: Why shouldn't I, after what he's done to you?",
        "Alison: Because it isn't gonna solve anything.",
        "Aaron: It might make me feel a little better.",
        "Alison: You have heard what Bonnie said, okay? This is a sexual harassment case. We need to stick to the facts, and the fact is that I got kicked out of the nursing program because I wouldn't sleep with Chris, not because he freaked out and locked me in a room. Please, Aaron, promise me. Promise me you'll leave him alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Where's Sofie?",
        "Paul: You answer me, I'll answer you.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Paul: Good. You don't need to worry about Sofie. I talked to her.",
        "Meg: No offense, but I heard you say that before. Earlier today, as a matter of fact. You know, the thing about Sofie is that she says what you want to hear, and then turns around and does whatever she wants. She can't be trusted, Paul. And the last thing your mother needs is for her showing up here again uninvited.",
        "Paul: I don't think she's gonna do that. She understands the situation. She knows she's not welcome.",
        "Meg: So, what's to stop her from finding another way to get to us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Did anyone see you?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Sofie: Good. Thank you for coming.",
        "Cole: I was on my way to the airport. Didn't see much reason for sticking around.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got so crazy yesterday.",
        "Cole: Pushed me out the door, said you never wanted to see me again.",
        "Sofie: I know, I know, and I shouldn't have, because I need your help.",
        "Cole: My help, huh? Thought it'd be good. Okay, I'm listening.",
        "Sofie: Okay. There's this woman, and her -- her name is Meg Snyder.",
        "Cole: What about her?",
        "Sofie: Meg has never liked me very much, and now she is filling Paul's head with lies about me.",
        "Cole: Why do you still care what Paul Ryan thinks about you, anyway? Sofie?",
        "Sofie: I just do.",
        "Cole: Are you in love with him or something?",
        "Sofie: What's it to you?",
        "Cole: Everything, if you want me to help you.",
        "Sofie: So what if I'm in love with Paul Ryan?",
        "Cole: Oh, man, you are -- I -- I don't -- I don't know what you are.",
        "Sofie: But Meg -- Meg is trying to turn him against me.",
        "Cole: Uh, sorry, genius. You did that yourself when you accused him of rape.",
        "Sofie: No, you're wrong. You're wrong. He forgave me for that.",
        "Cole: Right.",
        "Sofie: No, he did. He did, but -- but Meg, she won't let him forget. And if it weren't for her, Paul and I would be together right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Lisa. You got a minute?",
        "Lisa: Oh, hi! Lots of minutes for you, my dear.",
        "Paul: That's very sweet. Thanks. I have to ask you a favor.",
        "Lisa: Is it about your mother? You know if she needs anything, I am right here.",
        "Paul: Actually, it's about Sofie Duran. I'm not gonna use the words \"Breaking in,\" but we did find her in my mother's room.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, that -- that isn't so unusual, is it? I mean, after all, they do -- they're in business together.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. That business arrangement is over, and -- well, Sofie's behavior lately, it's been a little erratic. She's been kind of spiraling out of control.",
        "Lisa: Oh, my. How bad is it?",
        "Paul: She falsely accused me of rape.",
        "Lisa: Paul, I don't believe that. I am so sorry to hear that.",
        "Paul: No, it's no big deal. The -- the charges were dropped. But, obviously, this is very hard on my mom, and having Sofie hang around --",
        "Lisa: Oh, Honey, I can just understand what that must be like. Uh, how dare that little brat 'cause so much trouble when Barbara's so sick? What can I do?",
        "Paul: You can evict Sofie, today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Is there any truth at all to what Susan said?",
        "Kim: Oh, Bob --",
        "Bob: Did you hold Alison against her will?",
        "Chris: It wasn't like that, okay? She's making it sound a lot worse than it was, Dad.",
        "Bob: Did you lock the door, yes or no?",
        "Chris: Yes.",
        "Kim: Oh, Christopher -- what were you thinking?!",
        "Chris: Mom, I wasn't, all right? Is that what you guys want to hear? I wasn't thinking, okay? Susan is wrong though. I did not threaten Alison.",
        "Bob: What were you trying to accomplish?",
        "Chris: Dad, I just wanted to talk to her, all right? I needed her to listen to me.",
        "Bob: You have been told not to talk to Alison by me, by Tom, by everyone. But as usual, you know better than anyone else.",
        "Chris: No, Dad. No, but I can't sit around and do nothing. This is -- this is my life we are talking about, Dad. And when I found out she tried to get you to fire me, I lost it.",
        "Kim: She tried to get you fired?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Kim: Why am I only hearing about this now?!",
        "Bob: I didn't think it was necessary to mention it to you because I had no intention of giving in to her demands.",
        "Kim: Oh, Lord. Can this get any worse?",
        "Bob: You are not to have any contact with Alison in any way. Is that clear?",
        "Chris: Yes, Sir. Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You have no chance in hell with Paul Ryan.",
        "Sofie: You don't know him like I do.",
        "Cole: Like you do?! Maybe not. But I know you. I always knew you were a little off, but not this much. Accusing someone of rape isn't something a guy just gets over.",
        "Sofie: Well, he could if Meg would just leave him alone!",
        "Cole: I'm so out of here.",
        "Sofie: No, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, just -- just do this one thing for me? Please. I'll even pay you.",
        "Cole: What do I have to do?",
        "Sofie: I need you to steal something from the hospital for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hey, there you are. Where did you go?",
        "Paul: Um, I went downstairs to talk to Lisa. I asked her to find Sofie another place to stay.",
        "Meg: You did?",
        "Paul: Yes, I did. Having Sofie here was upsetting you. It was interfering with Mom's recovery. She had to go.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Thank you for doing that.",
        "Paul: You're welcome.",
        "Meg: Oh, you know, maybe this will be a wake-up call for Sofie, and she can get the help she needs.",
        "Paul: I hope so. Where are you going?",
        "Meg: I am going to the hospital to pick up my last paycheck and also order some medical supplies for your mom. But don't worry. I'll be right back.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, how long is it gonna be? No, I'm -- I'm gonna time you.",
        "Meg: You know, we need to find you a hobby.",
        "Paul: I thought we had a hobby.",
        "Meg: Do you want me to pick up a movie on the way back home?",
        "Paul: A movie? You really want to watch a movie?",
        "Meg: Well, I didn't say we'd finish it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: This drug in that concentration.",
        "Cole: Are you out of your freaking mind?! No way! Forget it!",
        "Sofie: Even if I pay you?",
        "Cole: With what money, Sofie? Paul was supposed to be the windfall, but you blew that.",
        "Sofie: You will get your money. I promise. Just -- just do this for me.",
        "Cole: I must be as crazy as you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I suppose you are waiting to hear my explanation for my visit to Susan.",
        "Bob: Well, I'm sure you had reasons.",
        "Kim: I did. I don't see any good coming out of this court case for anybody. I mean, win or lose. So I thought maybe if I talked to Susan, mother to mother, that she might see it the same way.",
        "Bob: But it didn't work.",
        "Kim: I'll say it didn't. Sweetheart, are you okay?",
        "Bob: Oh, I keep getting the feeling that maybe I'm to blame for this.",
        "Kim: What?!",
        "Bob: After I spoke to Alison, I told Chris I wasn't gonna fire him. But I did suggest that he consider resigning from the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I -- I got your message, but I -- I barely understand it. You saw Chris?",
        "Susan: He was with his mommy and his daddy.",
        "Alison: Why do I not like the sound of this?",
        "Susan: Because you're smart, and you know me.",
        "Alison: What did you do?",
        "Susan: In a nutshell, I think I threatened Chris in public, I called him a liar and a bully, and I think I also might have mentioned the affair I had with Bob.",
        "Alison: What?! You -- you couldn't find a way to fit in Tom and Emily, too? Mom, how could you do this?!",
        "Susan: I know. I'm sorry. But I -- I just saw them sitting there, looking so untouchable. I just had to let them know that we're not gonna fold. I hope you're not upset with me.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not. But now I know where my impulse-control issues come from. Look, it really means a lot to me that you're on my side, Mom. It really does. But this is my battle.",
        "Susan: I know, I know. And my place is on the sidelines, supporting you -- silently supporting you. But I got to tell you something -- it felt damn good to let Chris Hughes have it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What are you doing?",
        "Aaron: I'm getting even.",
        "Chris: Unlock the door, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Is that what Alison said when you did this to her?",
        "Chris: You're in way over your head this time.",
        "Aaron: Really? Well, what about you? I mean, you're the big-time doctor. I'm just following your lead.",
        "Chris: You don't want to do this.",
        "Aaron: You look a little scared, Chris. Is that how you were hoping Alison would feel, hmm, so she'd give in and drop the lawsuit? Or were you just trying to strong-arm her into bed?",
        "Chris: Excuse me?",
        "Aaron: Well, if you weren't trying to scare her, what was the point?",
        "Chris: I wanted to talk to her.",
        "Aaron: Right, because everybody listens to you. You give second chances, or you just drop people on your call, right?",
        "Chris: That is not what happened.",
        "Aaron: Really? Then what did? I might be a little bit slow up here, Chris -- maybe -- but I still don't get it!",
        "Chris: You know what I'm getting, Aaron? Tired of having you in my face every five minutes. You want a fight? You got one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hi.",
        "Paul: Sofie, I -- I -- I don't know what you're doing, but --",
        "Sofie: Well, I know you don't like to see me when you're with Meg --",
        "Paul: No, it has nothing to do with whether I'm with Meg or not. You and I, we said our goodbyes.",
        "Sofie: Like for the rest of our lives, you don't -- want to see me ever again?",
        "Paul: I think that might be best for everyone.",
        "Sofie: Can I just -- can I just show you something first? And then I'll go, I promise. This came today. It's from Gwen and Will. Pictures of Hallie. Look, look. She's changed so much. Oh, my gosh. Look. See the little lines around her mouth, where she's smiling? She didn't have those before. You know, I thought seeing her would make me feel better, but -- I feel more alone than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, I was looking for your order forms. I have a patient in private care, and I'm short on supplies.",
        "Nurse: Well, you're in luck, because I just did some inventory. In fact, what you need is right in that room over there. So go ahead and take a look.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sofie, look, I don't know what you're trying to do, but you need to stop.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm -- I'm not trying to make you feel sorry for me. Okay, not that I expect you to believe that. But I didn't say anything that -- that wasn't true. I am alone. And I guess that's why when Will and Gwen left and took Hallie, I became so dependant on you and your mom. I didn't have anybody else.",
        "Paul: You had your jewelry line.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, and I know that was. It was to keep me busy, to keep me out of the way.",
        "Paul: No, no.",
        "Sofie: Yeah.",
        "Paul: We believed in you.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. Do you know how many hours I spent in that little room, designing rings and bracelets and -- everybody said they loved them, and somehow, I took that to mean everybody loved me? So then, when you turned me down, I felt so stupid for thinking that -- that it meant something else. That's why I did what I did, accusing you.",
        "Paul: I gave you what I could.",
        "Sofie: And the rest went to Meg.",
        "Paul: I'd really like to see you be happy.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. This is something I -- I should have done a long time ago. Maybe we'd all be better off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Lisa, um, you know what I asked you to --",
        "Lisa: Don't worry. Wait. I know, but d -- I'm on it. I'm -- I'm really -- I'm gonna kick her out on her little behind.",
        "Paul: That's the thing. I -- I wonder if you could do me another favor and -- and hold off on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I don't understand why you would even consider asking Chris to resign.",
        "Bob: I needed some way to try to get through to him, to illustrate the position that he put us in. Obviously, it didn't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Get out of my hospital.",
        "Aaron: Your hospital? You really believe that, don't you? No wonder you thought you can get away with what you've done, you self-righteous punk!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I know Chris is ambitious.",
        "Bob: He's also reckless. You know, honestly, I should suspend him until this whole thing is over.",
        "Kim: Hey. Over my dead body.",
        "Chris: Get out of my way, farm boy.",
        "Aaron: What's up?",
        "Kim: What was that?!",
        "Bob: I don't know. It's locked.",
        "Kim: Oh! Oh, my God!",
        "Bob: Break it up!",
        "Kim: Christopher!",
        "Bob: Stop!",
        "Bob: Now break it up! This is a hospital, not a schoolyard! Break it up!",
        "Meg: Aaron?! Aaron --",
        "Kim: Right here!",
        "Bob: Stop. Stop it, Chris! Aaron, cut it out!",
        "Aaron: What the hell was that like, getting a piece of your own medicine, huh?! You don't like being locked up --",
        "Chris: Shut up! You shut up!",
        "Bob: So that's what this is all about. I told you, you're just making things worse!",
        "Security guard 1: We're taking them both downtown.",
        "Kim: Listen, is that necessary?",
        "Security guard 2: Afraid so, Mrs. Hughes. Hospital policy. Let's go --",
        "Meg: No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Aaron, do you want me to come with you or call you --",
        "Aaron: No, no, no. Don't call my dad. I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Meg: Alison, hey. It's Meg. I'm calling about Aaron. Something's happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Well, what a surprise.",
        "Aaron: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Meg called me. She said you got in a fight with Chris at the hospital. What happened?",
        "Chris: Your boyfriend assaulted me is what happened. Did you put him up to this?",
        "Bob: Chris, keep your mouth shut.",
        "Alison: You promised me you wouldn't go after him? How could you do this? You've just made things worse now. .",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Paul: Oh, what's wrong?",
        "Meg: Our families are at war.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Meg: Chris and Aaron were in a fight at the hospital, and now they're at the police station.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, um, Chris, right? Can I be on team Snyder then? You want to go down to the police station, try and sort things out?",
        "Meg: Uh --",
        "Paul: 'Cause my mom's asleep.",
        "Meg: No. I'll only be in the way. Besides, I'd -- think I'd rather stay here with you.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: This is okay to do that?",
        "Meg: As long as you promise never to stop. You know, um, it was kind of nice driving over here without worrying about running into Sofie.",
        "Paul: Yeah, um, about that -- well, I talked to Lisa.",
        "Meg: Oh, Sofie gave her a hard time when she told her she had to leave?",
        "Paul: No, not exactly. Sofie's still here.",
        "Meg: Why? What is Lisa waiting for?",
        "Paul: Well, I asked Lisa not to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How did this happen?",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry, all right? I couldn't get what Chris did to you out of my head.",
        "Alison: Well, what were you even doing at the hospital in the first place? You went looking for him, didn't you? You did this on purpose?!",
        "Susan: So, how exactly is the hospital gonna handle this one?",
        "Kim: Bug out, Susan.",
        "Bob: If you two are gonna go at it again, take it outside. I've broken up enough fights for one day.",
        "Dallas: You ready to give your statement?",
        "Chris: Absolutely. I just want assurance Aaron Snyder's gonna be charged with assault.",
        "Dallas: Look, I can't make any promises till I hear both sides of the story.",
        "Chris: All right, fine. Let's do this.",
        "Bob: Listen, before you take his statement, uh, could I have a word privately with Chris?",
        "Dallas: Sure.",
        "Bob: Okay.",
        "Chris: When are you gonna call Tom, Dad? He should be here.",
        "Bob: We're not going to call Tom.",
        "Chris: Why not?",
        "Bob: The last thing we're going to do is press charges against Aaron Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: It's perfect.",
        "Cole: What are you gonna do with that, anyway?",
        "Sofie: Why do you care?",
        "Cole: I don't. It's just -- I saw Meg at the hospital. Don't worry. She didn't see me. She's kind of hot.",
        "Sofie: Well, I did some research on Meg, and I found out that she killed one of her patients. And do you want to know how? She gave her patient too much of the wrong medicine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You told Lisa not to kick Sofie out?",
        "Paul: Okay, look, before you get upset --",
        "Meg: You know what? I don't believe this.",
        "Paul: No, hold on a second. Wait. Before you --",
        "Meg: No, I -- I don't want to hear any of your reasons! Doesn't it even matter to you how I feel about everything that Sofie has put us through?",
        "Paul: That's not fair. No, look, Sofie's not gonna be a problem anymore.",
        "Meg: Oh, oh, you know what? Why don't you keep telling yourself that? Even better, why don't you tell your mother that, see what she says?",
        "Paul: Hey -- where are you -- where are you going?",
        "Meg: If Sofie's not leaving, then I am. And unlike you, I'm not gonna change my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Aaron assaulted me, not the other way around. If I want to press charges, I should be able to press --",
        "Bob: That's all you're worried about, right -- what happens to you?",
        "Chris: This is my career on the line, Dad. I should have a say in this.",
        "Bob: I think you've said and done too much.",
        "Chris: What does that mean?",
        "Bob: You're not going to go after Aaron.",
        "Chris: Dad --",
        "Bob: Listen to me. I'm not talking to you as your boss. I'm talking to you as your father. And if you want to salvage what's left of your career, you'll do exactly what I tell you to do.",
        "Dallas: You sure this is how you want to handle it?",
        "Bob: Yes, we're sure.",
        "Dallas: Okay. I'll let them know.",
        "Kim: I can't believe it's come to this -- two grown men throwing punches at one another. And for what? For nothing but trouble.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry.",
        "Bob: You know, it's a little late for apologies. What I'd like to see is a little maturity -- something to show me that -- that my standing by you is not a mistake.",
        "Chris: It's not, Dad.",
        "Bob: Really? Look at where we are.",
        "Susan: Dallas, should we get Aaron a lawyer?",
        "Dallas: No. Um, he isn't going to need one. Chris isn't pressing charges.",
        "Aaron: So, what happens now?",
        "Dallas: Well, he's been told to keep this distance from you, and I suggest you do the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Stop. I'm not defending Sofie. I'm just -- I'm trying to give her another chance. That's all.",
        "Meg: To do what? Ruin your life again? Have you forgotten that she charged you with rape, and she only dropped the charges after you paid her off?",
        "Paul: Meg, I haven't forgotten anything. What I did with Lisa, asking her not to throw Sofie out -- I did that for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Here. I can do it.",
        "Alison: No, it's all right. I'm still a nurse's aide, for now.",
        "Aaron: Ali --",
        "Alison: Don't talk.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry, okay? I know I screwed up. What's worse is I -- I broke my promise to you. You don't get it. I care about you. I care about you so much, it's driving me crazy.",
        "Alison: No kidding.",
        "Aaron: Like it or not, I'm not gonna let anyone, okay -- anyone get away with hurting you ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I've never seen Dad so mad at me.",
        "Kim: Under the circumstances, I would say he has every reason in the world to be mad.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry I got you dragged into all this.",
        "Kim: Oh, I'll survive it. So will your father. But you have got to do your part, because unfortunately, this situation is not gonna clear itself.",
        "Chris: I don't know what to do anymore, mom. I really don't.",
        "Kim: My advice, whether you want it or not, is you have to find some way to rise above it. You cannot stoop to their level of fighting. We'll never win anything that way. You're a Hughes. It's time you started acting like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I just want Sofie out of our lives, and it seems you're doing everything to not let that happen.",
        "Paul: No. What I'm doing is I'm trying to show you that I've changed.",
        "Meg: By helping her?",
        "Paul: She's just a kid. She's trying to turn her life around.",
        "Meg: She's not your problem to fix.",
        "Paul: I'm not trying to fix her. She's gonna leave anyway. It's just a matter of days.",
        "Meg: Okay, so why put it off? Why couldn't you just let Lisa do it?",
        "Paul: Because if I have her thrown out, that's something that I do out of fear or out of spite, and I don't want to be that guy. I want to be the guy that -- that you fell in love with again, that you love forever.",
        "Meg: What do I say to that?",
        "Paul: You say you -- you've fallen in love with me, and you love me forever. No, I'm not kidding. You can say that.",
        "Meg: Look, I know what it's like to want to make up for the mistakes that you've caused, and you don't know where to start.",
        "Paul: You start by letting go.",
        "Meg: I'll let go when Sofie lets go.",
