        "Lucinda: Front page. Below the fold. More has been written about Molly murdering Silas Whitman.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] Not murder, self-defense.",
        "Lucinda: What was she doing out there in the middle of nowhere?",
        "Lily: It wasn't in the middle of nowhere. They were at a restaurant.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it was a deserted restaurant, and he was an ex-lover, and he tried to kill her. [Stammers] Aren't you curious, Honey?",
        "Lily: It's none of my business. Or yours.",
        "Lucinda: What do you mean it's none of your business? Molly spends time with your children. She mentors them. She's gonna marry your ex-husband -- unless you do something about it.",
        "Lily: It's not my place to stop Molly and Holden from getting married.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you're just too passive about all of this.",
        "Lily: Because I've taken a note from the serenity prayer, and I've decided to focus on the things that I can change and the people that I can help.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you can help Holden by saving him from this unsuitable woman.",
        "Lily: Mother, Holden is a grown man. He makes his own decisions. There are other people that need me more right now.",
        "Lucinda: I can't think of that. Who needs you more than your immediate family?",
        "Gabriel: Could I borrow your car today?",
        "Lucinda: Don't tell me the kid is still here?",
        "Lily: Okay, I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Okay. We have a hearing scheduled for two weeks, but it is unlikely that we will prevail.",
        "Craig: Two weeks? I can't stay in here for another two minutes.",
        "Tom: Well, you're gonna have to. It was hard enough to get this thing scheduled that soon.",
        "Craig: Tom, the only reason I was denied bail is because Gabriel claimed I assaulted him, but he's recanted that. I should be able to get out.",
        "Tom: And you subsequently attacked a guard, you escaped from police custody. Do I need to mention the little matter about the attack on Lucinda?",
        "Craig: But you're Tom Hughes. You're an extraordinary attorney. Tom, you can handle piddly charges like that with your hands behind your back.",
        "Tom: Craig, you threatened to kill her.",
        "Craig: Well, who hasn't?! Tom, I need to get out of here. I need to get to my son.",
        "Tom: I know you miss Johnny. Dusty's taking good care of him.",
        "Craig: Dusty is not his father, I am, and three-minute phone calls just aren't making it. Johnny needs me back in his life. Gabriel needs me, too. He just doesn't know it yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, you've seen Parker's transcript, right? So you know that he's an excellent student. Right. Yes, I know that your program would really give him a boost in A.P. Science come September, so I -- [Sighs] Yes, I-I know that we missed the deadline, and, look, I'm sorry about that. It was not Parker's fault. It was my fault if it was anybody's fault, okay? We had a-a family emergency, so -- would you still consider him, then? Oh, thank you. [Chuckles] Thank you very much. Okay, so what do I -- what's my next step, then? Okay. Yes, I'll overnight a check. What's the address? Yeah. And how -- how much is it for? Could you say that again? No, I -- how could it possibly be that much? I mean, how much is -- okay, so when your brochure says, \"We build smarter kids,\" what you really mean is we build smarter, richer kids? Hello? He --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Detective Snyder? This came from the courthouse. It needs your signature.",
        "Jack: What case is this, Malone?",
        "Cop: It's about your kid, the assault charge against Gabriel Caras.",
        "Jack: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you grinning about?",
        "Dusty: Just you.",
        "Janet: Ah, but it's not just me anymore. It's me and my son.",
        "Dusty: You love saying that.",
        "Janet: What? \"My son\"?",
        "Dusty: [Laughs]",
        "Janet: [Laughs]",
        "Dusty: You said it about a dozen times since I came.",
        "Janet: I know, but I've been saying \"My daughter\" for so long, it's kind of nice to be able to say \"My son.\" So I'm practicing -- \"Son.\" \"Hey, Son. Get over here. Son, go to your room! Son, I love you.\" Mmm.",
        "Dusty: I love seeing you happy.",
        "Janet: I know. It's been a while, hasn't it? Things are finally turning around for us.",
        "Dusty: Everybody's healthy. The baby's healthy.",
        "Janet: And you've got Johnny for the foreseeable future. I think things are falling into place.",
        "Dusty: Almost everything.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's right. For goodness sakes. I have to find Jack. I have to tell him he's having a boy A.S.A.P.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You read my mind.",
        "Jack: You were coming to see me?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I don't know if I would have made it. I might have turned around before I got to the station.",
        "Jack: Maybe I know how you feel. I was thinking about having this messengered over.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Jack: I asked the D.A. to have the assault charge expunged from Parker's record. May I?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: She agreed. The record's gonna be sealed. No one can access it. This way if Parker applies to colleges or for a job, he'll have a clean slate.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Yeah. So we just have to sign it, saying that we understand and accept the decision on Parker's behalf. So you sign where it says \"Mother,\" and I guess I'll sign where it says \"Father,\" even though I'm not.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. We both know you're Parker's father.",
        "Jack: That's not what you said yesterday.",
        "Carly: I said something in the heat of the moment that I didn't mean. If I could take it back, I would.",
        "Jack: Well, you -- you didn't, and you can't. And I'm actually glad you said it.",
        "Carly: Why would you be glad?",
        "Jack: Because now at least I know how you really feel.",
        "Carly: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I wonder if Jack's at the station. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out he's having a son. A son. A son, a son, a son. What's wrong?",
        "Dusty: You want me to take you over there?",
        "Janet: No, that's okay. I mean, I know you and Jack are getting along at the moment, but, uh, I think I'll be okay.",
        "Dusty: Whatever works for you.",
        "Janet: [Gasps] I told you we were gonna have coffee together, and now I'm running out on you. I'm so sorry. Let's sit down. We'll have some coffee together. We'll talk.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no, no. You should tell Jack. He should know now.",
        "Janet: Are you sure?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Okay. I have the sonogram. I'm gonna show it to him and see if he can figure out the sex himself, huh?",
        "Dusty: Don't take long. 'Cause after you surprise Jack, I've got a surprise for you.",
        "Janet: Ooh. What is it?",
        "Dusty: Meet me at the Lakeview when you're done.",
        "Janet: Ohh. You're spoiling me.",
        "Dusty: Get used to it. Hey, Lib.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Janet: Hey, Sleepyhead. You left before breakfast, so I had room service send something up for you.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I canceled the order. I wasn't hungry.",
        "Janet: What's the matter? Are you feeling sick?",
        "Liberty: No.",
        "Janet: Are you sure? Did you take your temperature?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, Mom, I'm not sick again. I'm just miserable.",
        "Janet: Oh, Sweetie.",

        "Gabriel: Look, I don't want to be here any more than you guys want me to be here.",
        "Lily: I want you here, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: What am I supposed to do? I'm broke.",
        "Lucinda: How can you be broke with the money that -- that you took from Craig?",
        "Gabriel: Oh, it's gone. Unless you know a rich old lady who can bankroll me?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my heavens. How can you put up with this insolence?",
        "Lily: He's only insolent when you're here. We've been getting along quite well, haven't we, Gabriel?",
        "Gabriel: Aces.",
        "Lily: We owe him this much.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I don't want to hear any more about that.",
        "Lily: We didn't tell him the truth about his father. He's alone in this world because of us.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, and we did him a favor. Although I've got to say the apple didn't fall far from the tree. The kid is here with your children. This is not a good influence. He -- he -- he gets into fights. He stole your car.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, hey. I apologized for that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, that makes all the difference.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, and I put gas in the tank.",
        "Lucinda: Only to make your escape.",
        "Lily: Mother, we've set up ground rules. We're not gonna have any more problems, are we, Gabriel?",
        "Gabriel: No, Ma'am.",
        "Lily: And, uh, speaking of rules.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, come on. We both, you and I, we know why you're doing this, trying to rehabilitate this heathen.",
        "Lily: Why's that?",
        "Lucinda: Well --",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, no. Let me guess. To distract myself from Holden and Molly getting engaged.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, it's got to be ripping your heart apart. Molly of all -- ew, of all people. But instead of avoiding this, you should be fighting it.",
        "Gabriel: Boy, she gives you a lot of advice, doesn't she?",
        "Lucinda: All of it sound.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You know what? You need something more than cereal for breakfast. I'm gonna make you some eggs. And, Mother, I bet you have a million things to do today. Don't let us keep you.",
        "Lucinda: You will leave this house today.",
        "Gabriel: [Chuckles] Why are you so ticked off at me? Okay, I could have ratted you out, and I didn't.",
        "Lucinda: Took my money, now you're taking advantage of my daughter's kindness.",
        "Gabriel: You keep blabbering about this money, but I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Lucinda: Don't toy with me, young man.",
        "Gabriel: No, seriously, I don't. You want me to get Lily back in here, and you can explain it to both of us?",
        "Lucinda: It amazes me for a guy who never met his father, you've turned out exactly like him.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, I'm nothing like that bastard.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Gabriel: Nothing. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Gabriel came here looking for me. He wanted to connect with me. And then we hit a glitch.",
        "Tom: Yeah, he caught you stealing from Parker's trust fund.",
        "Craig: Now, that money was to put Monte Carlo on the map. That's a win for Carly and Parker. And I always intended to put that money back.",
        "Tom: And what's the likelihood of that happening now?",
        "Craig: Zip. I'm tapped out. It's a good thing you represented me pro bono. Well, family discount. Well, just get back to my point. Gabriel came here because he really wanted to get to know me. Now that he's recanted, we can get back on track.",
        "Tom: Well, considering what's gone down between the two of you, I think that's wishful thinking.",
        "Craig: He doesn't have anyone, Tom. He needs me.",
        "Tom: Yeah, he needs someone.",
        "Craig: You know, I've done terrible things in my life, but abandoning one of my children isn't one of them. Those Walsh women kept him from me for 20 years. Now, I'm trying to make that right, but I can't do it from inside this prison cell.",
        "Tom: You know, it's a long shot, but I -- I may be able to convince a judge to grant bail.",
        "Craig: Tell me.",
        "Tom: Well, we need a sponsor -- I mean, family that would vouch for you, take you into their home, and tell the court that they're responsible for you.",
        "Craig: You think that would make a difference?",
        "Tom: I think it's worth a shot.",
        "Craig: [Scoffs] Then let's go for it.",
        "Tom: Well, this sponsor would have to be well-respected in the community, have to be considered by the court to be, you know, above reproach.",
        "Craig: Well, who's more upstanding than a police lieutenant and a former D.A.?",
        "Tom: Your sister's not even talking to you. Don't go there.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but -- but you could -- you could talk to her.",
        "Tom: No Katie, no Katie. No, no, no, Sir. Her job -- between that and Jacob, she's got plenty to do. Oh, and she has a new roommate.",
        "Craig: [Sighs] Then who?",
        "Tom: Well, go through your address book and find somebody that you haven't burned a bridge with yet.",
        "Craig: Or somebody that owes me a favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What I said to you was awful. I know that, but please try to understand where I was coming from. Jack, I was afraid for my son.",
        "Jack: Yes, exactly. Your son.",
        "Carly: No. Uh. Our son. You know I consider Parker just as much yours as he is mine.",
        "Jack: That's not what you said, though, Carly.",
        "Carly: I wasn't thinking straight, Jack.",
        "Jack: After all these years, you honestly believe that because I'm not Parker's biological father that I don't love him as much as I love Sage and that I wouldn't protect him as much as I would her.",
        "Carly: It's not true. I -- I was afraid that he was gonna go to jail, Jack.",
        "Jack: Because of me. Because I'm just a lousy stick in the mud who cares more about the law and to hell with his kids. Well, no, not exactly. Just the -- just the adopted ones.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I do not doubt your love for Parker. I don't.",
        "Jack: I want to believe that.",
        "Carly: I love you, Jack. And I know that you were just trying to do the right thing.",
        "Jack: I love you, too, Carly, but we have a difference in opinion of what \"Right\" means.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Jack: I don't know where we go from here. I honestly don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Gabriel purposely lied to hurt his own father. In his mind, Craig had already hurt him, so it was justified, but still.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but Craig could have gone to jail for something he didn't do.",
        "Liberty: I'm glad Gabriel finally told the truth, but the only reason he did it was because of me. When we were in Craig's hotel room, he was --",
        "Janet: Whoa! Hold on! Flag on the play. You were in Craig's hotel room? When?",
        "Liberty: After the party when you guys thought he kidnapped me.",
        "Janet: You were alone in a hotel room with a guy.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I already told you that. Okay, anyway, I begged Gabriel to tell the police that Craig didn't hit him, and he did.",
        "Janet: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Liberty: No. Because he didn't do it because it was the right thing to do. He did it to please me -- to make me like him more. But how can I like somebody who doesn't even have a conscience?",
        "Janet: That's a very good point.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs]",
        "Janet: But you do. You like him as more than just friends.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs] I don't know. I'm not sure.",
        "Janet: Okay, good. Then if you're not sure, step away.",
        "Liberty: I already have. But I did a stupid thing first.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. Liberty, did you sleep with him?",
        "Liberty: No, no.",
        "Janet: Thank God. Thank God.",
        "Liberty: But I was tempted. [Sighs] I can't believe I'm telling you this.",
        "Janet: Oh, Sweetheart. Come on. It's me. You can tell me anything.",
        "Liberty: Gabriel and I kissed, and it could have led to more, but I put the brakes on.",
        "Janet: Good. Okay. That's good. Good for you.",
        "Liberty: But it was really hard to say no. Part of me is really attracted to him even though I know I shouldn't be.",
        "Janet: Okay, but you fought those feelings, right? You went against them.",
        "Liberty: This time.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] Liberty, do you want me to take you to go see Dr. Hale and get you back on the pill? I mean, I don't want you to be sleeping with Gabriel or anything like that, but if you are torn --",
        "Liberty: But I don't want to be torn, Mom. I want to have a plan and know where I'm going like everyone else my age. But I can't make a decision about anything these days.",
        "Janet: I have an idea.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs]",
        "Janet: Maybe you should go away for a few weeks, gain some perspective on things and get away from Gabriel for a little while.",
        "Liberty: No, I don't need to go anywhere. I've made up my mind.",
        "Janet: Already?",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Okay. What's your decision?",
        "Liberty: No matter how cute or persuasive Gabriel is, I am not gonna sleep with him. That's it. The end.",
        "Janet: Oh, boy. You've got it bad for this guy.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs]",

        "Lily: How do you like your eggs? Is scrambled okay?",
        "Gabriel: I'm not hungry anymore.",
        "Lily: What's wrong?",
        "Gabriel: What isn't wrong? I hate this town and I hate everybody in it.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] I can understand how you'd feel that way.",
        "Gabriel: No, you don't. You don't know jack about me, okay? I'm just your pet project.",
        "Lily: All right. Sit down. We need to talk.",
        "Gabriel: About what?",
        "Lily: You need to have an attitude adjustment, my friend.",
        "Gabriel: [Sighs]",
        "Lily: Yeah, things have been tough for you, and I am partially to blame for that.",
        "Gabriel: You think?",
        "Lily: But, Gabriel, I have opened up my home to you. I've opened up my heart. And for that, if nothing else, you owe me some respect.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Gabriel: You gonna get that?",
        "Lily: No. This is more important. You need to meet me halfway.",
        "Gabriel: I am. Hey, look. I stopped putting my feet up on furniture, and I started making my bed and doing all the other stuff you told me to do.",
        "Lily: Come on. That's the easy stuff. What I'm asking you to do is go deeper. I need to know that I can trust you, Gabriel. Because if I can't, I can't have you living in this house with my children. Their safety comes first to me.",
        "Gabriel: What, you really think I'm gonna hurt them?",
        "Lily: Well, what if you get angry again and lash out at Craig or me or my mother? What if you steal again or you get in another fight? I can't risk that my children will be caught in the crossfire.",
        "Gabriel: [Sighs] Okay, so, what, you're gonna kick me out?",
        "Lily: No. I'm giving you a choice. Look me in the eye, Gabriel, and tell me that I can trust you.",
        "Gabriel: My mom always said trust was everything.",
        "Lily: Your mom was a wise woman.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. Look where that got her.",

        "Guard #1: You have a visitor.",
        "Craig: That was quick. Ugh! What are you doing here, Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I was passing by, and I just needed a -- a quick pick-me-up.",
        "Craig: Well, enjoy it while you can because I'm getting out.",
        "Lucinda: They're transferring you, hmm?",
        "Craig: No, I'm getting out on bail.",
        "Lucinda: Not very likely.",
        "Craig: And I'm gonna tell Lily that you turned my son against me.",
        "Lucinda: She's never gonna believe you.",
        "Craig: I'll get Gabriel to corroborate it.",
        "Lucinda: Then I'll make sure that Gabriel is long gone. And then I'm gonna make sure by calling in every favor I have in this town that you stay in this cell until you are a lonely, sad, depressed old man.",
        "Craig: Well, you better make sure of that, Lucinda. Because the second I do get out of here -- I'm gonna kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: It's not like Gabriel's been pressuring me to sleep with him.",
        "Janet: It was just that one time?",
        "Liberty: And when I told him where I was coming from, he was cool with it.",
        "Janet: And you told him you weren't ready.",
        "Liberty: And that I got pregnant and lost the baby.",
        "Janet: What?! Liberty, you told him all that?",
        "Liberty: Mom, he was really sweet about it. He's not the bad guy you think he is. He's just been through a lot. Okay, his mom died, and then he came to Oakdale to find Craig, and then it was this whole disaster.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, part of that is his fault. He's not an innocent victim in all this.",
        "Liberty: I know.",
        "Janet: Yes. The kid's got problems, Honey. It's not up to you to make him whole and happy. He's got to figure that out on his own.",
        "Liberty: I know. I pretty much told him that.",
        "Janet: And besides. You don't want somebody that's gonna be so needy, right? I mean, isn't that the problem between you and Parker?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. They both want more than I can give them right now. Oh. Maybe you're right. Maybe I should go away for the summer.",
        "Janet: If that's what you want.",
        "Liberty: Not really.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. Thank you. Oh, thank you. I just got you back, and you're gonna be going to college in the fall. I don't want to lose you again.",
        "Liberty: You're gonna fall apart.",
        "Janet: I'm gonna totally fall apart. But the most important thing is I want you to be happy. So if you need to go away, if you need to travel, take some courses --",
        "Liberty: No, Mom. I don't want to use your father's money for that.",
        "Janet: Honey, that's the whole reason to use my father's money. That's the good thing about his money. You think about it. Think about what you want to do, and I will make it happen, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Janet: Because you are my baby girl. And speaking of babies -- say hello to your little brother!",
        "Liberty: It's a boy?",

        "Carly: Jack, this last month has been incredibly stressful for both of us. We've both said things that -- that we didn't mean. Awful things. But we can get back to -- to the life that we were starting to build together now.",
        "Jack: Boy, you make it sound so simple.",

        "Carly: Well, you can be pretty passionate, too.",
        "Jack: I believe in following the rules, and you're --",
        "Carly: A little more flexible in that area?",
        "Jack: [Sighs] We're so vastly different from each other.",
        "Carly: We need each other.",

        "Carly: I know you're good for me.",

        "Carly: Yeah, uh, well, I was on the phone with that school in New York about the summer science class for Parker --",
        "Jack: I thought we missed the deadline on that.",
        "Carly: Yeah, we did. But I was talking to the admissions person, and I was hoping that -- that she would let him in anyway, and do you know that she hung up on me? [Laughs] My first instinct was to go to you and to tell you how mean this woman had been to me so you could fix everything for me. And then I had this fear.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: I thought maybe you're not my dream man anymore. Am I right about that, Jack? I guess that was pretty crazy of me to think, right? That you'd come to my rescue? I guess I'm just so used to depending on you. You're the one who makes everything all right.",
        "Jack: Not always. Sometimes you think I'm the one who makes things worse. So where'd you leave things with this woman?",
        "Carly: Um -- well, I'm sure that I could smooth things over and that I could probably get Parker in, you know, but I don't even know how I'd pay for it. His trust fund used to pay for things like this.",
        "Jack: I have money.",
        "Carly: No. [Chuckles] No, that's now what I -- no, you already paid my car insurance and the property tax. I'm not gonna take another dime from you. So I'm --",

        "Carly: I really did it this time, didn't I? Jack, I swear to you that I did not mean what I said to you about Parker. But I can see now that it stuck in your head, and it's gonna be between us. Tell me how -- how I can erase it? How we can get past this, okay?",

        "Liberty: But not because it was the right thing to do. You did it to make me happy.",
        "Gabriel: So, is it a crime to try to make you happy? I mean, so what if I did it? Who cares why?",
        "Liberty: I care. And the fact that you don't see that really worries me. I mean, what does that say about the kind of person you are?",
        "Gabriel: [Scoffs] I know that I'm not a perfect person and I never pretended to be. I thought you liked me anyway.",

        "Lucinda: And little Johnny, he may love you, I know. He's too young. But when he grows up -- when he grows up and he knows what you're like, he's gonna know exactly what you are. He's gonna hate you the way the others do.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, hi, Honey. [Stammers] He -- he has driven me to this. I came here with an olive branch, and on top of everything else, he's threatened me again.",

        "Liberty: Of what gets stirred up when we're together. I can't heal you, Gabriel. I can't make you better.",

        "Gabriel: What do you want me to do, okay? I can't rewrite history.",
        "Liberty: It's not about what I want. It's what you want for yourself. Do you want a relationship with your father?",

        "Dusty: [Laughs] Well -- what's done is done.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Not only did he drain Parker's trust fund, but he destroyed my business, which was my only source of income.",
        "Tom: Well, that's tough. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Carly: Hey, I know that he had insurance on the building. That's why he set fire to it, right, to collect the money.",
        "Tom: Is there a question in here for me?",
        "Carly: Exactly how much money are we talking about here? 'Cause whatever it is, it's rightfully mine.",
        "Tom: I'm sorry, Carly. There's not gonna be any insurance payout.",
        "Carly: How is that possible?",
        "Tom: As long as there's the slightest suspicion that arson was involved, the insurance company's not gonna pay out. They'll just void the claim.",
        "Carly: But I need that money. I deserve that money. There's got to be some way we can get them to fork it over.",
        "Tom: Well, there's only one way to get them to pay up, and that's have all the charges against Craig dropped and -- and he'd be free to -- I don't think that's likely to happen here.",

        "Jack: I'm just saying back off. I never should have gone along with your story. I should have outed you from the very beginning.",
        "Dusty: Listen, if you tell her, you're gonna upset her for no reason.",
