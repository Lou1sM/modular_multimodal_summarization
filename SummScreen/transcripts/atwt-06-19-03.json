        "Bob: Is there a good time in a murder investigation?",
        "Hal: Yeah, when it's solved.",
        "Bob: I was just wondering -- is there anything I can do to bring us \r\ncloser to that end?",
        "Hal: You can make our next step a little bit easier, Bob. Let me tell \r\nyou how. Right now, Dr. Gordon is our prime suspect, but frankly, Bob, all the \r\nevidence we have against him is circumstantial.",

        "Emily: Well, it's nice to see you, too, Alison.",
        "Alison: Well, mom's not here. I have a date, and you just made me ruin \r\nmy nail.",
        "Emily: A date, huh? Anybody I know?",

        "Lily: Oh. It's really dark. How long have I been sleeping?",
        "Rose: Well, the moon was directly above us, now it's closer to the rim, \r\nso it's gotta be a couple of hours. You've been sleeping a lot.",
        "Lily: What else is there to do at the bottom of a well, Rose? Have they \r\nsent down any more food or water?",
        "Rose: No, nothing. It was dark, and then it was light, and it was dark \r\nagain. And, no, no one's been back since.",
        "Lily: Why did they send down this hairbrush and the -- all that other \r\nstuff? I thought they wanted us to look presentable so that we would be rescued, \r\nRose.",
        "Rose: Yeah, I thought they'd want us to look presentable so they could \r\nget their money and now -- I mean, somebody's got to say it, so it might as well \r\nbe me. I think our kidnappers flew the coop.",

        "Holden: This is everything from corn fields to state parks. We're \r\nlooking at half the state here, Margo.",
        "Margo: Well, with Spangler dead, there really is no way to narrow it \r\ndown. Now, I would say between time of abduction and first contact, Lily and \r\nRose could be anywhere within a 100-mile radius.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me -- what about Barbara? How can Hal be sure that she \r\nis not involved in this?",
        "Margo: No one is off the hook yet. I've got a couple of uniforms \r\ntailing Barbara, and I'm about to question Donovan again.",

        "Holden: Save your sarcasm. Tell me what you want.",
        "Dusty: I put my life on the line for Rose and your wife, and it's not \r\ngood enough? Take your checkbook and wave it in front of somebody else's face.",
        "Holden: You were in on it with Spangler, just like we thought. You \r\nkilled him to shut him up.",
        "Dusty: Do you know what that maniac said to me? He told me he took Rose \r\nbecause I liked her. That's what I'm dealing with. Now I could have killed him \r\njust for saying that, but I didn't.",
        "Holden: You had more reasons than Rose to kill him. Several million \r\nmore.",

        "McCann: Yeah. But first, you gotta help me.",
        "Molly: Help you? How?",
        "McCann: Spangler's dead. Stanley's gone. I don't know, maybe he's dead, \r\ntoo. It seems like whoever hired Spangler for the kidnapping is getting rid of \r\neverybody in the operation. I don't want to be next.",
        "Molly: How in the hell am I supposed to help you with that?",
        "McCann: I've got to get somewhere where I can be gone, where they won't \r\nfind me. When I got your note --",
        "Molly: It's not my note. I was just the messenger. It was Dusty's note. \r\nIf you want -- I think you should speak directly to him.",
        "McCann: Like I'm walking into a cop shop and talking business to a guy \r\nin the slam? Get real. You're my best bet now. You gonna help me or not?",
        "Molly: That depends on what you want me to do.",
        "McCann: Get me a deal with the cops.",
        "Molly: They are gonna want proof that Rose and Lily are alive, or they \r\nare gonna kick my butt right out the door.",
        "McCann: I'll tell you whatever you need to know -- what they're \r\nwearing, what they say to each other. Like the other day, I heard 'em singing \r\n\"Happy Birthday.\"",
        "Molly: That means nothing. That doesn't prove they're alive today. \r\nYou're gonna have to do better than that.",
        "McCann: Okay, okay. I'll get something else. I'll call you inside of an \r\nhour. If the deal's not in place, I leave town on my own, and those ladies \r\nstarve to death. Tell the cops that. Go. Go!",

        "Walker: Would it sound like a line if I asked you if you come here \r\noften?",

        "Jessica: Well, that was rude.",
        "Ben: Jessica -- I told you about him. Walker Daniels? That's the \r\ninvestigator that's been turning the hospital upside down. A little while ago, \r\nhe was giving me the third degree in front of the nurses' station. I have \r\ncolleagues and patients walking by, and he's -- he's grilling me about why I was \r\npulled off of Marshall Travers' case.",
        "Jessica: But wait a minute. That was months ago.",
        "Ben: Like I have some kind of history that makes me capable of being a \r\nmurderer.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm sure Dr. Daniels will say he's just doing his job.",
        "Ben: Oh, yeah, he's doing a job, all right. Look, innocent people do \r\nnot deserve to be treated like criminals.",
        "Jessica: Well, it doesn't mean he's enjoying it. And I'm sure he's not \r\nenjoying being ostracized for it, so -- I mean, look. He's sitting over there by \r\nhimself. He doesn't know anybody. He doesn't have any friends.",
        "Ben: Oh, poor baby.",
        "Jessica: Just --",
        "Ben: Okay. Okay. But I'm doing this for you.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Ben: Yeah. Dr. Daniels, I was a little less than cordial there, and I \r\nwas wondering if you wanted to come join us.",
        "Walker: Did the lady guilt you into asking me?",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, something like that.",
        "Walker: Well, I -- I appreciate the offer Dr. Harris, but actually, \r\nthis is my first night off in a few weeks, and I was looking forward to getting \r\naway from Memorial and all the talk of murder and mayhem.",
        "Ben: Oh, I won't bring up criminal behavior if you don't.",
        "Walker: You don't want to break bread with me. So why put both of us in \r\nan uncomfortable position?",
        "Ben: Look, man, I'm just trying to do the right thing here. Be nice.",
        "Walker: All right.",
        "Ben: Okay, so we will try this again. Jessica Griffin, I'd like you to \r\nmeet Dr. Walker Daniels.",

        "Bob: He's probably scared to death. He heard every word we said. This \r\ncould ruin his career.",
        "Hal: Well, he brought that suspicion on himself by not coming forward \r\nwith that vial of medication. Dr. Daniels and I have a responsibility to \r\ninvestigate based on that suspicion, Bob.",
        "Bob: I understand that, but morale in this hospital is at an all-time \r\nlow. And I don't want someone convicted by word of mouth.",

        "Bob: Permission to invade the privacy of the staff?",

        "Emily: I didn't do anything to him. I -- you know what? I think he was \r\njust a little too young for me. I think that was the problem. I couldn't take \r\nhim seriously, you know? And I always felt sort of uncomfortable being alone \r\nwith him in public, you know? I mean, in private, it was great. We --",
