And I promise you, before our friends, before our family, before god, I will do everything I can to make all of your dreams come true.",

        "Faith: Yeah, and the lion's standing right over him, but you know he's not going to hurt him. And it's so peaceful and we liked the painting so much and parker especially.

        "Brad: I'm not looking, okay, so you can keep your free advice. The only reason why I offered to buy you a drink and win a little money off you is because, I used to like you.",
        "Henry: You still like me, brad. You just don't like that I'm right.",
        "Brad: You know for your information, okay, there are more important things in trying to find miss right, I've got my career to think about.",

        "Vienna: No, never. I just thought it might be nice to do something.",
        "Henry: Well we do things. We wake up, you kiss me. I kiss you. We see where that leads. And then we take a shower and see where that leads. And then you take out the lingerie and I pick something for the day. And then we go have breakfast, unless we're too busy taking off lingerie. And then we go out and shop and go to lunch, we go to movies, we do lots of things, what are you talking about?",
        "Vienna: But wouldn't it be great to be something?",
        "Henry: What do you mean? Besides happy?",
        "Vienna: No, have you ever had a career?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, I've -- well I had a brief stint in television production. I was a private eye for a little while. A card shark. There's also the limo --",

        "Henry: Okay honey, I'll buy you a hat.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not just a hate henry. I want to have something I've never had before. And one thing I've never had is a job. You know, don't you think that would be amusing.",

        "Paul: She can't marry that guy.",
        "Lucinda: That is not your decision to make, if you go into the church right now you will put meg in grave danger.",
        "Paul: Lucinda, if she marries craig, that's the danger.",
        "Lucinda: You will spoil things if craig knows the two of you are still together. The plan is that you whisk her away after the ceremony, after she turns worldwide over to me.",
        "Paul: It's too dangerous. It's too much of a risk.",
        "Lucinda: If you go into the church right now, craig will go ballistic. Just think about rosanna? Think what he did -- do you want that to happen to meg?",
        "Paul: Lucinda I had a vision and if meg puts that ring on her finger, something terrible is going to happen.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, to craig. He's going to be out of everything. Out of a wife, out of a company, out of -- come on. That is the plan and we're going to stick to it and you go back to -- back to the lakeview.",
        "Paul: I can't, I can't, I can't leave her alone.",
        "Lucinda: She's not alone, she's safe. We're all with her. We're there with her. And darling as for your vision, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, but they don't always work out the way you think they are. We don't know what the hell this one means. You go back. Go back to the hotel. And wait for us.",
        "Minister: Do you, meg, take this man to be your lawful husband? Will you love him, honor him, keep him in sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, for as long as you both shall live?",
        "Craig: Meg?",
        "Meg: I will.",
        "[ Lucinda sighs ]",
        "Minister: Place the ring on her finger. Bless the giving of these rings that they who wear them may live in peace, and continue in favor all the days of their life. Inasmuch as meg and craig have given themselves to each other by solemn vows, with the joining of hands, and the giving of rings, I now pronounce them husband and wife. Those whom god has join together, let no man put asunder. You may kiss the bride.",
        "Brad: Hey, what are you doing here? There's eggs on the floor.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. Here, make yourself useful.",

        "Brad: Oh, well, no wonder you're in such a bad mood, jack and carly off on their own. I mean, you know what that means.",
        "Katie: Yeah, they're looking for their son.",
        "Brad: Yeah, whatever you say. I mean, you know how kids get when they want their parents to get back together. They're always coming in with one crisis after another.",
        "Katie: Just so you are up to speed -- faith was shot with B.B. Gun. Parker got blamed for it, it wasn't his fault, it was an accident. But he took off before all of the facts came out. Faith seems to think he's in chicago, so jack and carly went looking for him there. Any more questions?",
        "Brad: Is faith okay?",
        "Katie: She'll be fine. It's just a flesh wound.",
        "Brad: So you're here holding down the fort while jack and carly are --",
        "Katie: Look for parker.",
        "Brad: Hey, parker, it's your uncle brad. Hey, give me a call, okay? Yeah, you know, I'll come and get you, man -- bail you out, no questions asked, whatever. Just call me. And be safe. And no talking to beautiful blondes. He's going to be okay. He's a smart kid.",
        "Katie: I know, but he's still a kid. He's scared and he's upset.",
        "Brad: He grew up on a farm, his dad's a cop. He knows how to look after himself. But maybe that's not what's really got you worried.",
        "Katie: Why do you always ruin it when you're ahead?",
        "Brad: I was ahead?",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, now you're not.",
        "Brad: Well, why? Because I was wondering if you're worried about jack and carly spending the night?",
        "Katie: He's not spending the night with her.",
        "Brad: Well, do you think they're going to be home before morning? Because I sure don'T. I mean, not with carly all teary and needing comfort. I mean, you never know what can happen.",
        "Katie: I'll tell you what's going to happen. If you don't shut up, I'm going to throw you out.",
        "Brad: You and what army?",
        "Katie: Brad, don't tempt me. I have got three scared kids waiting for dinner. Okay? I can't find the can opener, there is no microwave, and I can't figure out how to light this old stove. So if you're not going to pitch in and help me make a meal for these kids, get out!",
        "Carly: The storm's coming.",
        "Jack: Just a summer shower.",
        "Carly: We don't even know if he has a jacket.",
        "Jack: So he'll get wet. He'll be fine.",
        "Carly: You don't know that.",
        "Jack: Carly, he's grown up a lot since you left. He finds his way to school most mornings by himself.",
        "Carly: When he goes.",
        "Jack: And when he doesn't, he's apt to be anywhere from the lake to al'S.",
        "Carly: He goes to the lake by himself?",
        "Jack: Paul used to live near there for a while. And he and faith used to hike through the woods to his cabin.",
        "Carly: Well, chicago's not the woods. He's scared. He's upset and he's alone.",
        "Chicago cop: No one inside. I checked the grounds. I'll cruise the streets once again. I'll let you know if I spot him.",

        "Katie: Well, I was going to make pancakes. I realized there wasn't any mix, so I thought, \"I'll do it from scratch!\" There's a cookbook, there's eggs, there's flour, there's milk. And then, I was reaching for the flour when the eggs were rolling on the floor, and hence the mess.",
        "Brad: That's why I have my pancakes at al's -- which I think is a really good idea. We could take the kids to al'S.",
        "Katie: I told jack I wouldn't leave the house. I promised.",
        "Brad: Well, what did he promise you? Well, don't get touchy. I'm just, you know, looking for an update. You know, obviously, you two have an understanding. He gets to go out and spend the night with his ex, and, well, you get to babysit.",
