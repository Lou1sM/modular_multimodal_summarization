        "Damian continues to keep Luke in the dark about his role in Ross Kreeger trying to take him away. He pretends he knew nothing about Ross Kreeger and thinks Luke should stay away from Lily under the pretense that she remains unstressed. Luke ditches Damian and heads for the hospital. Bob tells Holden and Lucinda Lily's pregnancy seems to be proceeding normally, but he is concerned about Lily's health. He fears she may not be coming out of her coma soon. He is transferring Lily to a private room. Lucinda asks how Lily fell and Holden is evasive. Will is concerned about Jade's new desire to work at Crash, with his help. He decides to ask Casey to help him with that. Casey doesn't understand at first, but Will explains because of his decision to cheat in school Jade got fired, and he has a weird sense of obligation to her now. Casey wonders what Jade is holding over him, and is even more confused when he sees them hugging. Carly calls Jack to come over; when he does, she explains she understands she misread the signs he was giving her, so she has packed all of his stuff up and she wants it gone by days end. She is going to Montana for a visit and taking the kids. Carly is all business and Jack is not sure how to take this. Gwen interrupts them; she is excited to tell Carly she and Will worked things out, but is upset to see Jack in the process of moving out. Gwen tries to convince both to not give up, but is unsuccessful. Carly offers Gwen and Will her house while she is in Montana. Carly hands Jack the signed separation papers, and mentions that they should move forward with the divorce. Holden sees Luke at the hospital but is concerned he will cause Lily stress. Holden and Luke go over the events leading up to Lily's fall again. Katie and Vienna almost come to blows, and Simon hears Katie's voice and finally sees her from afar. He hatches a plan when he finds out Katie has a masseur coming to her cabin. Simon shows up in the masseurs place. Casey tells Jade she has a job at Crash, just as Gwen is walking in. Damian shows up at the hospital to keep Luke away from Lily, but Holden sees and confronts him. Luke sits with Lily and she wakes up."

        "Mike: Good morning.",
        "Katie: It is a great morning. I'm waking up next to you.",
        "Mike: What's the matter?",
        "Katie: Do you hear that?",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: Silence.",
        "Mike: I guess the party next door fizzled out.",
        "Katie: Those selfish idiots kept me up half the night.",
        "Mike: I thought I was the only one who could do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Simon: Baby. Baby, what time is it?",
        "Vienna: It's time for food. Where's room service?",
        "Simon: Oh sweetie, you didn't fill out the breakfast order.",
        "Vienna: Oh, please. Do you think anyone ever does? This is a high-class cruise. They're supposed to just know.",
        "Simon: All right, now you're just wasting your time.",
        "Vienna: Yes, I'd like to have two goat cheese and spinach omelets, a pot of coffee, and two spicy Bloody Marys. [Vienna scoffs] What do you mean, an hour? You can't expect us to wait that long. We need it now. No, I didn't fill out your stupid form.",
        "Simon: I told you so. I need a shower.",
        "Vienna: No, I'm not going to the buffet. I don't stand in line, ever! Now what am I supposed to do?",
        "Simon: You know what, Princess? You know what I'll do for you? I'll go to the buffet, I'll get you some food, and I'll bring it back. Make you happy?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Porter: Room service?",
        "Katie: Ooh, right on time.",
        "Mike: Just leave it outside the door. We'll get it in a minute, okay? Thank you.",
        "Katie: No, I want to go get it. I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: No, I'm not done with you yet.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I've really been dreaming about feeding you strawberries in bed. I will be right back, I promise. Excuse me. What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You must eat something.",
        "Luke: How can I, knowing that my mom is in the hospital because of me?",
        "Damian: Stop blaming yourself.",
        "Luke: I pushed her, Damian. And now she's unconscious, and nobody knows when she's gonna wake up. What the hell was I thinking?",
        "Damian: Luke, you weren't thinking. You were very upset. The both of you were having an argument.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that doesn't mean I should've freaked out. She is seven months pregnant.",
        "Damian: You didn't mean to hurt her.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I did. Why did she have to get that guy to try and take me away? She hired someone to try and kidnap me, Damian. And how come I can't make my dad understand that?",
        "Damian: He probably will, just give him a chance to calm down.",
        "Luke: He won't even call me to tell me how she's doing.",
        "Damian: He probably just wanted you to get some rest.",
        "Luke: No. No, I can't stand this. I can't stand not knowing. I'm going to the hospital. I need to see how she is.",
        "Damian: Luke, wait -- don't. I don't think it's a --",
        "Luke: I need to tell my dad that it was an accident. And I need to apologize to my mother. I never meant to hurt her.",
        "Damian: I know, I know. And I'm sure she knows that already.",
        "Luke: Well, then if she's awake, maybe she can tell me why she hired some guy to try and take me away.",
        "Damian: Wait, Luke. You can't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: How's my girl?",
        "Holden: No change since last night. She's stable.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my sweetheart, that won't do. No, no, no, that's insufficient. You've got to open those beautiful eyes and tell us that everything's going to be all right.",
        "Holden: Have you spoken with Luke?",
        "Lucinda: No. I mean, not since he dropped the girls' things off. I asked him if he would stay the night, but he didn't want to.",
        "Holden: Because I tried the house this morning, and there was no answer.",
        "Lucinda: I stopped by on my way here, and he wasn't there. But it looked as if nobody had been there. Where do you think he spent the night?",
        "Holden: With Damian.",
        "Bob: I have news about the baby. The tests show that the pregnancy is proceeding normally.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, did you hear that darling? That's good.",
        "Holden: What about Lily? How is she?",
        "Bob: The truth? I'm concerned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, you all set for tonight? You know what you're gonna sing?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, pretty much. That reminds me, I'm going to go call Carly, make sure she and Jack are coming. Will.",
        "Casey: So how's it going?",
        "Will: It's like pulling teeth. But I'm getting there.",
        "Casey: Just don't stress out, and you should be all right.",
        "Will: Yeah thanks, Einstein. So, where's Gwen going?",
        "Casey: Calling Carly.",
        "Will: Oh, okay. Does she seem okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, a lot more mellow than the other night when you disappeared.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know, I know. I messed up. I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: And what did we learn from all of this? Don't keep secrets from your wife.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[Will remembering]",
        "Will: Are you crazy? You can't work at Crash!",
        "Jade: Why not? I hear you know the woman who owns the place. And I know that they're still hiring people. What's the problem?",
        "Will: The problem is, that Gwen works there too.",
        "Jade: So what? I'm never going to let it slip that we slept together. I don't make mistakes like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So, I put you and Jack on the guest list for tonight. You guys should probably get here, like, around 9:00.",
        "Carly: Yeah, about that, Gwen. You know, I don't think we're going to be able to make it. I'm really sorry.",
        "Gwen: Oh. That's okay. Is anything wrong?",
        "Carly: Nothing for you to worry about. You know, I'm kind of in the middle of something here, and I really need to finish. Can I call you back?",
        "Gwen: Sure.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Will: What's the matter?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Jack and Carly just bailed on me for tonight. It sounded like something was wrong.",
        "Will: Did they hit another bump in the road?",
        "Gwen: I'm not sure. The last time I saw her, everything was cool, you know? Jack was moving back home.",
        "Will: Why don't you go see her? See if she's okay.",
        "Gwen: You don't mind?",
        "Will: I'm gonna be here a good long while. You go ahead.",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Will: Hey, listen, man. Can I ask you for a favor?",
        "Casey: Anything, just ask.",
        "Will: Help me get Jade a job.",
        "Casey: A job where?",
        "Will: Here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi, I got your message.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I was beginning to think you weren't going to show up.",
        "Jack: Carly, I'm sorry about the way we left things. I didn't want to hurt you. I just had to make myself really clear --",
        "Carly: You know, it was my fault. I misread the signs. You were taking care of me because I was hurt, and I thought it meant that you were going to move back home. I was wrong. It's time to start facing reality.",
        "Jack: Yes. Yes, it is.",
        "Carly: So I packed up your stuff. At least most of it. And I'd like it all out of here by the end of the day. I'm going out of town and I want things in order when I get back.",
        "Jack: Out of town? Where to?",
        "Carly: Montana. I'm taking the children. With you back on the force full time, I couldn't very well leave them with you, could I?",
        "Jack: That's good.",
        "Carly: You don't mind it?",
        "Jack: No, I think it's a good idea.",
        "Carly: Good, that I'm leaving town, or good, that I'm taking the kids?",
        "Jack: Both. They could use a vacation. And you could definitely use some time away from here.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I could.",
        "Jack: So, are you leaving this second, or do I have a chance to say good-bye?",
        "Carly: Oh, you'll have a chance. They're next door at the Lebo's. You can stop over there after you leave.",
        "Jack: We should probably tell them what's going on, don't you think? At least the guys.",
        "Carly: I already did. I figured you didn't want to be the one to tell them that you're not coming home again. After all, I'm the delusional one, right? Telling them made it real for me.",
        "Jack: And how'd they take it?",
        "Carly: Pretty well. I think they expected it. They're not the ones with the trouble facing reality.",
        "Jack: Carly, I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Let's just get this over with, okay? You know, I didn't know which tools you wanted from the garage, so I put a few in a box, but you should probably go and check.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: Jack, wait.",
        "Carly: You'll probably need another box.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Carly: Gwen, what are you doing here?",
        "Gwen: I'm just checking on you. You sounded really weird on the phone.",
        "Carly: I probably did. And you know, it occurred to me after I hung up that I didn't even ask you how you're doing.",
        "Gwen: I'm great, actually. I took your advice and Will and I talked things out. And everything's really good.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm happy to hear it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, it's all thanks to you. I mean, you and Jack are -- you guys are like, the perfect example of that whole happily ever after thing.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well --",
        "Jack: Hey, Gwen. How's it going?",
        "Gwen: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: I got pretty much everything I need.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Jack: So, I'm gonna start loading up the car.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Carly: Jack's moving out. For good. Turns out love can overcome everything but me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why in the hell would I help Jade get a job here?",
        "Will: Because she got fired from the library for helping me out so I owe her this.",
        "Casey: You don't owe her anything.",
        "Will: Try to understand, all right. I need to do this. I don't want to carry around the guilt of knowing that I got someone fired from their job just for doing me a favor.",
        "Casey: A favor? She helped you cheat!",
        "Will: Yeah, because I asked her to.",
        "Casey: All right, yeah. I guess it makes sense, in a weird, Will Munson sort of way.",
        "Will: So, you'll hire Jade?",
        "Casey: Not a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Considering the extent of her injuries, there is a possibility that Lily will not be coming out of the coma as quickly as we'd like.",
        "Holden: Tell me what I can do.",
        "Bob: Basically what you're doing. Stay with her. Talk to her. Right now, our goal is to keep her stable and calm. I've arranged to put her in a private room so she can have more peace and quiet.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, good. Thank you -- not good.",
        "Bob: Good?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, good.",
        "Bob: Well, we did pretty well by you --",
        "Lucinda: Yes, you did. Of course you did, Bob.",
        "Bob: We'll do no less for your daughter.",
        "Lucinda: How did this happen? I mean, actually how did this happen? How is she in a coma?",
        "Holden: Luke didn't tell you anything?",
        "Lucinda: No -- no. Luke has told me nothing. And you -- you have been very short on the details. And don't think I haven't noticed that. I want to know. What happened? Did she slip and fall? Did she lose her balance and fall?",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "Luke: So that's when she reached for me and I pushed her.",
        "Holden: I really don't know how it all happened.",
        "Lucinda: Was she all alone?",
        "Holden: No. Luke was with her, and Damian.",
        "Lucinda: Damian? Why?",
        "Holden: I don't know why. But I intend to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Why don't you want me to go check in on my mom?",
        "Damian: I just don't think it's a very good idea right now. The last time you two were together, you were both very upset.",
        "Luke: And you think seeing me will make her worse.",
        "Damian: I just think you should let Holden take care of your mother right now. And let me take care of you. Come on.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I just don't understand how this got so messed up. My mom can't even stand to be around me anymore.",
        "Damian: Don't say that.",
        "Luke: Why not? Why not? It's true. She hired some guy to take me to some camp to try and make me straight. And now my dad won't even let me in the hospital because he thinks it'll upset her too much. That's why he had Lucy send me away the other night.",
        "Damien: Maybe he's just thinking about you. Maybe he's just trying to spare you any more grief.",
        "Luke: Damian, I got so mad, I put my own mother in the hospital. Nothing can spare me from that.",
        "Damian: This is just a big misunderstanding, Luke. I am sure that once your mother regains consciousness, everything will be cleared up.",
        "Luke: Did Mom ever mention Ross Kreeger or his foundation to you?",
        "Damian: What would you think your mother would discuss that with me?",
        "Luke: You're right. She would've known that you would try to talk her out of it.",
        "Damian: Luke, you have to forget about this Ross Kreeger guy. He's out of your life.",
        "Luke: I just can't believe it's happening again.",
        "Damian: What?",
        "Luke: My mom's life is on the line and it's all because of me.",
        "Damian: Wait, wait, something like this has happened before?",
        "Luke: Yeah, there was this guy, Keith Morrissey. He tried to get my mom to marry him because he found my kidney when I needed a transplant. Well, he was just -- he was just a real bad guy. A real jerk. But my mom was willing to go along with it, for me.",
        "Damian: Your mother loves you very much. She would've done anything to save your life.",
        "Luke: Do you think that's why she tried to send me away? That maybe she thought straightening me out would save me?",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Damian: Wait, Luke, wait. Don't go to the hospital yet. Not while you're feeling so upset.",
        "Luke: Relax. I'm going to the bathroom.",
        "Damian: Your mother wasn't trying to save you, Luke. I was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: It's mine, I tell you.",
        "Katie: No, it's not! I left a card on the door last night requesting our breakfast at this exact time. Not only that, the porter just knocked on my door to tell me our delivery was here.",
        "Vienna: Check your hearing when you get back to the mainland, lady. The porter knocked on my door. And he left my breakfast. Now, leave me alone.",
        "Katie: Not without my food. Give it to me!",
        "Vienna: No, let go!",
        "Katie: It's my food!",
        "Vienna: No, it's my food!",
        "Katie: Oh, really? Then why don't you tell me what's under the lid.",
        "Vienna: You know, you're really starting to annoy me.",
        "Katie: You can't tell me because you didn't order it.",
        "Vienna: So, I don't remember what I got. Big deal.",
        "Katie: Well, I do. French toast, turkey sausage, fresh strawberries and a basket of croissants -- viola! It's mine!",
        "Vienna: Not anymore, it is!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Simon: Did I just hear you yelling at somebody?",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "[Banging on the door]",
        "Katie: Open up, you thief!",
        "Simon: So, who's that?",
        "Vienna: Sounds like our neighbor from hell. And I've about had enough.",
        "Simon: You know what, so have I. I'm gonna nip this in the bud.",
        "Simon: Well, I guess you scared her off.",
        "Vienna: I'd like to throw her off the boat.",
        "Simon: All right, what were you two fighting about this time, huh?",
        "Vienna: She accused me of stealing her breakfast.",
        "Simon: Well, apparently, you did. Come on, isn't this feud getting a little tiresome?",
        "Vienna: Okay. Let's complain and have them removed to another room.",
        "Simon: No, you know what? You know what? I got a more civilized idea.",
        "Vienna: Stop, the suspense is killing me.",
        "Simon: Why don't you and I invite them to have drinks with us in the lounge after dinner?",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Vienna: Please tell me that's a joke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, what's the matter? Where's breakfast?",
        "Katie: The whack job next door stole our breakfast!",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: I caught her wheeling our breakfast cart into her room! I tried to stop her, but it was no use. She is not getting away with this.",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you calling?",
        "Katie: Security.",
        "Mike: No, come one. Put that down. Look, it's just gonna end up ruining our day. Seriously, come on. We'll go up to the deck, we'll have breakfast there. It's a beautiful day. Forgetting about our troubles, right?",
        "Katie: I guess so. I guess. You're right.",
        "Mike: Okay. Plus, I have a really big surprise for you after breakfast.",
        "Katie: A surprise? For me? What is it?",
        "Mike: I can't tell you that, then it wouldn't be a surprise anymore, would it?",
        "Katie: You're right. All right, let me grab a shower.",
        "Mike: No. This works better without one.",
        "Katie: Okay, now you have me really intrigued.",
        "Mike: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Oh, greedy, thanks for leaving me some.",
        "Vienna: I was hungry and you took forever to get dressed.",
        "Simon: So, how was it?",
        "Vienna: At least the little witch knows how to order.",
        "Simon: So, you did steal it! Come on, sweetie. Get up. Get dressed. We are gonna go and make peace with them right now.",
        "Vienna: I'd rather die.",
        "Simon: Well, that's one way to get rid of them, but that would leave me stuck here all by myself. And a lonely Simon is a very, very, unhappy Simon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, wait, I forgot my key.",
        "Mike: Don't worry, I've got mine. Come on.",
        "Katie: Well, just in case. Just go get our table. I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter #1: Are you ready to order, sir?",
        "Damian: Not yet. I'm waiting for my son. He's in the restroom.",
        "Waiter #1: Are you talking about the young man that was sitting here?",
        "Damian: Yeah.",
        "Waiter #1: I just saw him leave the club.",
        "Damian: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: All right, Sweetheart, I'm here. Holden's here. We love you. We're coming up to the room with you. And we're counting on you. Okay. We're counting on you, baby. Love you.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: I should probably go tell Natalie and Faith what's going on here.",
        "Lucinda: I can do that. I'll do that.",
        "Holden: What about Luke? If he's with Damian, then --",
        "Lucinda: Leave it to me. I'll stop at Fairwinds and I'll find out. Okay?",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: All right. She's a big, strong girl. She's gonna make it.",

        "Carly: No, no. Gwen, please, don't try and give me any hope. It's over. And there's no way around that. And Jack's accepted it. And now I gotta do the same thing. Yeah, you know, I'm gonna get you that soda right away. I'll be right back.",

        "Vienna: That's the spirit. Yes, I'm still here. Not until this afternoon? Who? Did she, now? Well, how long a massage does one girl need?",
        "Simon: What's the matter?",
        "Vienna: Now little miss neighbor from hell has tied up the only masseur for the entire morning! Must that woman have everything I want?",
        "Simon: She's pretty good at getting what she wants, yes.",

        "Holden: I know that. But your mom's in a very delicate state and we don't want to upset her.",

        "Luke: I don't know what more I can tell you. Mom and I were in a fight. She reached to me. I don't know what I was thinking, I knocked her hands away and then the next thing I know she's falling and there's nothing I could do to help. And Dad, I feel -- I feel terrible about it. But it was an accident.",
        "Holden: I want to know what led to the fight. You said there was a guy in the house. And you think that your mom hired this guy?",
        "Luke: She didn't want me around. So there was this -- this guy from a camp up in the mountains and he was gonna take me there and they were gonna work on me and then when they were done, I wouldn't be gay anymore.",
        "Holden: I don't know where you got that idea, or why, but there's no way in the world your mom would ever do that. I don't believe it. I don't believe it for one minute.",

        "Jack: I've tried to tell myself that before, Gwen. But with Carly, there always is.",
        "Gwen: Look, you don't understand. She's really learned her lesson. She loves you too much to risk losing you again.",
        "Jack: I've been burned too many times, Gwen. I'm sorry, I can't go through it again.",
        "Gwen: Look, I know that she's messed up. And she knows that, too. But what you guys have is so strong. It's big enough to get past everything.",

        "Gwen: How long is a while?",
        "Carly: I don't know. Just long enough to get my head straight. Figure out what I'm gonna do next.",

        "Carly: I signed the papers, didn't I? I'm not fighting you. But I will fight for the kids. I'm not gonna give them up, Jack. If you take me to court, I will fight you.",
        "Jack: No, I would never do that to you or to them. You're their mother. They should stay with you.",

        "Holden: And this place is designed to secretly turn gay kids straight? Come on, Luke, don't you think that's a little far-fetched?",
        "Luke: I know what he said, and I know why he was there. And I also know that it was Mom's idea.",
