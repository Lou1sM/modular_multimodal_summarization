        "Janet finds out that her \u0091inheritance' came from Dusty and is livid. Janet lights into him about how he handled this all wrong by lying and trying to control her. Carly charms the insurance agent into thinking that the fire was an accident by Gabriel's hand. Parker almost blows her story. Lucinda is horrified to find out that Lily is allowing Craig to stay with her at her house as well as Gabriel. Craig goes after Gabriel to try to talk, but he isn't interested and even decides he is going to leave town to get away from him. Craig talks with an insurance agent about the fire and is put off by all the personal questions directed at Gabriel. Craig is fuming when he learns Carly sent him his way. Meanwhile, Lucinda tries to manipulate Faith into helping possibly frame Gabriel for drugs \u0096 if they get some. They can get rid of them all. Jack happily tells Parker that he will be a big brother. Parker and Jack have a talk about how much family means and how Parker wants them to stay together. He wants Jack and Carly to stop worrying about being such great parents because they already are. Jack admits to needing Carly, as Janet comes in to share her news; she is bummed when she finds out Jack already knows he is having a son. Jack defends Dusty's motives a little, but Janet doesn't know if she can ever trust him again. Craig comes to take Johnny for ice cream and a sleepover surprising Dusty because he thought he was in jail. Craig appreciates what he did, but their deal was only while he was in jail. Carly and Parker talk about him getting his money back, but he isn't interested. Craig is furious when he confronts Carly and promises to stop her. However, they come to an agreement when Carly poses the idea about the electrical malfunctioning because of a mistake. Craig and Carly agree to claim the firs started accidentally from electrical work so they can collect. Janet and Jack happily talk about their son-to-be and the possible names. Their fun is interrupted when Dusty shows up. Janet and Dusty talk about their relationship and she explains sadly how she can't be with him anymore; she can't have him control and fix her life; she wants respect. Dusty pleads with her to reconsider, but Janet is set to give up the apartment and his money and make her own way. Jack privately talks with Hal's photo hoping his son will turn out to be like Parker. Gabriel and Parker get into a verbal sparring, as Parker wants him to stay away from Liberty, while Gabriel taunts him about his supposed \u0091hooking up' with Liberty. He was going to leave town, but now he thinks he won't and with all the money, he has (as he flashes it), he will be able to charm Liberty even more. Parker is incensed and heads home where he tells a thrilled Carly, who has been on the phone trying to get loans, that she is right \u0096 money is important and he wants to get it back."

        "Janet: How could you do that? How could you let me think that money came from my father?",
        "Jack: Janet, don't get upset. It's not good for the baby.",
        "Janet: Hey, lying to me is not good for me.",
        "Jack: I -- I should have told you myself.",
        "Janet: Why didn't you?!",
        "Jack: Because I didn't think it was my place.",
        "Janet: I need to talk to Dusty, please.",
        "Jack: Just promise me you'll stay calm. Please?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: You needed the money. You needed a home for you, Liberty, and the baby. I did what I thought was best.",
        "Janet: Regardless of how I felt.",
        "Dusty: I love you, Janet.",
        "Janet: If you think saying that to me makes it okay to lie, you don't love me. You don't even know me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: There you are.",
        "Eugene: Thanks.",
        "Carly: It's understandable that your company might have made a mistake, Eu -- may I call you Eugene?",
        "Eugene: Of course -- Carly.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] When the fire first happened, the police -- they automatically called it an arson.",
        "Eugene: As far as I know, this fire is actually still classified as an arson.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, that could be because Margo -- uh, Lieutenant Hughes -- she's the chief of detectives. Perhaps she didn't call your company to give you the new information.",
        "Eugene: What's the new information?",
        "Carly: Well, you know that I just -- I had just started Monte Carlo.",
        "Eugene: The fashion-design company, was it?",
        "Carly: Yes. [Laughs] That's so sweet of you to remember that, really. Anyway, I was trying to help this young man. He was very down on his luck, and he didn't have too much experience. But I, um -- I gave him the job as sort of, um, an electrician.",
        "Eugene: You have a kind heart. His name?",
        "Carly: Gabriel -- Gabriel Caras. He worked very quickly, and, um -- just awful to say.",
        "Eugene: You can tell me.",
        "Carly: He's such a sweet kid, and he worked so hard. He tried so hard. But I -- I think that perhaps he made some errors that could have led to the fire.",
        "Eugene: Could this Gabriel Caras have been holding some kind of grudge against you and, uh -- what's that name of your partner?",
        "Carly: No, Gabriel liked me very much. I mean, he was very appreciative. I had given him the job. He was very appreciative indeed.",
        "Eugene: Carly, what aren't you telling me?",
        "Carly: Well, I -- I suppose that you'll find out about Craig and Gabriel soon enough. But I want you to know something. Deep in my heart of hearts, I know for certain that this fire was an accident.",
        "Parker: What are you talking about, Mom? Who said the fire was an accident?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You stay away from us! Don't you take another step into this house. Gabriel, if he moves, hit him! I'm calling the cops.",
        "Lily: No, no. Put the phone away.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know how the police would let him escape.",
        "Lily: He didn't escape.",
        "Lucinda: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: Mother, he's on bail on my recognizance!",
        "Craig: Hello, Faith.",
        "Faith: Hi? What is going on?",
        "Lucinda: Well, apparently, your mother has lost her mind, Darling. She's brought the boy into the house, and now she's adding the convict father to the mix.",
        "Craig: Remind me to thank you for your hospitality.",
        "Faith: Wait. Craig is staying here, too?",
        "Gabriel: Look, I don't care what he does, okay? I'm out of here.",
        "Craig: Gabriel -- Gabriel --",
        "Lucinda: First Damian and now Craig? What are you doing?",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Craig: Gabriel, please, can't you just give this a chance?",
        "Gabriel: How did you get out of jail?",
        "Craig: Lily just told you. She bailed me out.",
        "Gabriel: What about all the other charges against you?",
        "Craig: She pulled some strings. But that would have been impossible if you hadn't come forward and admitted that your story was a lie. That made all the difference. Thank you for that.",
        "Gabriel: I didn't do that for you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: And my son's reaction -- that's a perfect example of the assumptions people have made about the fire.",
        "Eugene: Hasn't your associate, Mr. Montgomery, actually been arrested for the crime?",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, Craig -- has a lot of problems. [Whispering] A lot of problems. But starting fires is certainly not one of them.",
        "Eugene: You were going to tell me something before about Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Caras.",
        "Carly: Yes. Well, it turns out that Craig is Gabriel's father.",
        "Eugene: That's startling.",
        "Carly: And also proof of Craig's innocence. He is nothing if not a devoted father. He would never put any of his children in any danger.",
        "Eugene: I'll look into it.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you so much. You're very perceptive, Eugene. I'm sure you'll see that it was an accident. And poor Mr. Montgomery can be freed from his awful cell.",
        "Eugene: If it was an accident, we'll find out, Ms. Tenney.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Thank you for your time.",
        "Parker: Poor, poor Mr. Montgomery? Since when?",
        "Carly: Since that's the only way to get the insurance money, Parker.",
        "Parker: Lying to the adjuster?",
        "Carly: Um, I -- I gave him another way of looking at things.",
        "Parker: Well, you know what, Mom? Even if this works and you do get the money, keep it, okay, because I don't want it.",
        "Carly: I have to do whatever I can to take care of you.",
        "Parker: The money doesn't even matter to me anymore.",
        "Carly: Well, it will eventually.",
        "Parker: Please, just forget about it. And -- and fix things between you and Dad.",
        "Carly: This has nothing to do with your dad and me.",
        "Parker: Are you kidding me?! Be -- before this whole mess, you guys were fine. You were back together. But now you've split up, and -- and you're fighting.",
        "Carly: Parker, not because of this.",
        "Parker: It has everything to do with this, Mom! The money has caused problems from the beginning! So please just forget about it.",
        "Carly: I know it seems that simple to you, Parker, but it isn't.",
        "Parker: Please, please, just work things out between you and Dad.",
        "Carly: All right, you listen to me. I'm gonna tell you something, and I want you to believe it, because it is the honest truth. Your father and I being apart is not because of you.",
        "Parker: Then why?",
        "Carly: Because he's him and I'm me. That -- that's why.",
        "Parker: That's not a good reason.",
        "Carly: Maybe not to you. But it is what it is. And as far as this money goes, you know, things don't just work out for the best magically. You have to make them work out for the best. And having a lot of money can help that.",
        "Parker: Even if you don't want it?",
        "Carly: Want it or not, we're gonna get it back. Craig owes you, Parker, and he owes me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, if you didn't do it to help me, then why did you do it?",
        "Gabriel: I don't want to be a liar like you.",
        "Craig: I think there's something more to this. Does -- does this have anything to do with Liberty?",
        "Gabriel: Shut up. Shut up about stuff you don't know about.",
        "Craig: Gabriel, if there's one thing I do know, its women. But if you don't want to talk about her, that's -- that's okay. I understand. I just hope that while we're living here, we can get to know each other better. That's all.",
        "Gabriel: I'm not staying here.",
        "Craig: Gabriel, please don't be stubborn about this. I know you resent me.",
        "Gabriel: Look, not everything's about you, okay? I was leaving before you even showed up. But now that you're here, yeah, I'm gone.",
        "Craig: Gabriel! May I help you?",
        "Eugene: I -- I couldn't help but hear you calling after that young man. Is that Gabriel Caras?",
        "Craig: It is. Why?",
        "Eugene: Would you mind giving Mr. Caras a phone call asking him to come back here?",
        "Craig: [Scoffs] Who are you?",
        "Eugene: Uh, Eugene Milton, claims adjustor. My company covered the Monte Carlo building, the one that burned down.",
        "Craig: Yes, I'm -- I'm familiar with that. What do you want with Gabriel?",
        "Eugene: I have some questions for Mr. Caras.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm his father. You can ask me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I can't believe that you would suggest there's something romantic going on with Craig and me in front of my daughter!",
        "Faith: Is there?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Lucinda: I can't believe that you would volunteer to take in that viper.",
        "Lily: Craig wanted a chance to get to know his son.",
        "Lucinda: So you -- you invited the arsonist in to live with the grifter in your home, with you and with your children?",
        "Lily: Faith, your grandmother is obviously beside herself. Why don't you go in the kitchen and get yourself something to eat while she and I work this out?",
        "Faith: But I want to know what's going on.",
        "Lily: I know, Sweetie. I will talk to you later, I promise.",
        "Faith: Fine. It's not like I live here anyway.",
        "Lily: Do you want to know why I invited Craig to live here?",
        "Lucinda: You have a death wish.",
        "Lily: No. He told me you were the one that got Gabriel to lie about the night of the fire.",
        "Lucinda: And you believed him?",
        "Lily: Yes, I believed him, because it's exactly like something you would do! And it explains why Gabriel did that 180.",
        "Lucinda: So you have endangered your life and the lives of your children just to get back at me?",
        "Lily: To get back at you? No, Mother. But somebody's got to repair the damage you did. You gonna do it?",
        "Lucinda: Me?! Absolutely not. I wouldn't lift a finger for him!",
        "Lily: Well, then, fine. Gabriel stays and Craig stays, and you can feel free to leave this house and me and my children for as long as you'd like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: A boy. [Chuckles]",
        "Parker: Hey, Dad, I need to talk to you.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Parker: What -- what is it? What's up?",
        "Jack: Oh, Janet just found out that we're -- we're having a boy.",
        "Parker: For real?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Parker: I'm gonna be a big brother?",
        "Jack: You are.",
        "Parker: That's awesome!",
        "Jack: I know, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Don't say I don't love you. I would do anything for you. You know that.",
        "Janet: For yourself, you mean.",
        "Dusty: Giving you money I did for myself?",
        "Janet: That was guilt money.",
        "Dusty: Aw, come on.",
        "Janet: I blamed you for my father's death, so you pretend that he left me an inheritance. You think that throwing money at me would have made me forgive you faster. You know what? You were right.",
        "Dusty: Well, don't beat yourself up for believing me.",
        "Janet: My father didn't talk to me for 19 years, and I think that he's just gonna up and leave me money after he dies? How stupid was I?",
        "Dusty: Your father loved you, Janet.",
        "Janet: You don't know that. Everything I brought, I thought, \"This is from my Pop.\"",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: But none of it was, not even the damn washing machine.",
        "Dusty: [Sighs] But you were happy, weren't you? Can't you focus on that? Can't you hold on to that?",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Janet: Because you made me feel like I lost my father twice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Need I remind you that this man cheated on your sister repeatedly, never mind what he did to me, and hooked you on drugs?",
        "Lily: And what we did to him was just as detestable, Mother.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lily: We kept him from knowing he had a son. He never even had a chance to see that boy grow up.",
        "Lucinda: For which Gabriel should be exceedingly grateful.",
        "Lily: Oh, stop. I am not gonna change my mind about this.",
        "Lucinda: Of course, I know why you're doing this.",
        "Lily: Don't even think you know me better than I know myself.",
        "Lucinda: You're so unhappy about Holden and Molly.",
        "Lily: This has nothing to do with Holden!",
        "Lucinda: You're so unhappy that you're looking for a hobby, something to occupy your time. Well, this is a very dangerous choice, Lily.",
        "Lily: And this conversation is over. See yourself out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yes, Gabriel did some wiring around the Monte Carlo offices.",
        "Eugene: Was Mr. Caras inexperienced?",
        "Craig: I think he was a bit, yeah.",
        "Eugene: Was he licensed?",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not sure.",
        "Eugene: You're his father, aren't you? Why do you know so little about your son?",
        "Craig: Thanks to a decision by his mother, I just recently met my son.",
        "Eugene: I see.",
        "Craig: You see what? What are you writing?",
        "Eugene: Is it true there is a history of animosity between you and Mr. Caras?",
        "Craig: I think \"Animosity\" is a strong word.",
        "Eugene: But accurate? Do you think your son is capable of sabotaging your workplace as some sort of payback for his resentment toward you?",
        "Craig: Do insurance adjusters always get this personal, Mr. Milton?",
        "Eugene: When necessary.",
        "Craig: I don't think so. I think someone put you up to this.",
        "Eugene: You're quite wrong about that, I can assure you.",
        "Craig: Where did you hear there was an issue between me and Gabriel?",
        "Eugene: That piece of information came from one of the fire investigating team.",
        "Craig: And the rest of your information?",
        "Eugene: I had a very nice chat with your business partner, Carly.",
        "Craig: On a first-name basis, are we?",
        "Eugene: She's a lovely woman. She was very forthcoming.",
        "Craig: I bet she was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Does J.J. know?",
        "Jack: Nobody knows. I just found out myself.",
        "Parker: Well, can I tell him? I mean, I completely understand if you don't want me to.",
        "Jack: Parker, Parker, Parker, you can tell him.",
        "Parker: Great. And what about Sage?",
        "Jack: I think I should tell your sister. You know how competitive she is.",
        "Parker: Yes. Yes, that -- that is true.",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] I can't believe this. You actually -- you really do see us all as a family.",
        "Parker: Sure. I mean, don't you?",
        "Jack: [Sighs] Parker, you and J.J. and Sage -- you mean the world to me. But these last few months --",
        "Parker: What is it?",
        "Jack: Well -- have I been there for you? I've tried to be. But if you feel like, I don't know, you couldn't count on me for any reason, you'd let me know, right?",
        "Parker: Dad, are you asking me if I think you're messing up?",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's exactly what I'm asking you.",
        "Parker: Well, yeah. I mean, you are a parent.",
        "Jack: Oh, stop. Come on. I'm being serious here. You know how much I love you, right?",
        "Parker: You always kept this here.",
        "Jack: That's a good man right there. Before I came to work here, I, uh -- I knew a lot about law enforcement. But Hal taught me how to be a good cop.",
        "Parker: You know, you and Mom, you've got this guilt thing. She keeps trying to make up for the fact that she took off with Simon, and you don't think you'll ever be as good of a dad as he could have been. But you guys are missing it.",
        "Jack: Missing what?",
        "Parker: You think that what sticks with us, me and J.J. and Sage, are the times that you guys screwed up. But what we really care about is how hard you guys worked to make it right. You can stop now just trying to be a great dad, because you're already there.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Parker: Why would you even doubt that? Am I giving off some kind of \"I hate my parents\" vibe?",
        "Jack: No. Your mother's upset with me. She thought I didn't do enough to stand up for you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, the fire. I mean, I knew that wrecked things between you guys.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Parker: She kept telling me it wasn't my fault.",
        "Jack: It wasn't, Parker.",
        "Parker: But she's mad at you because of me.",
        "Jack: She's mad at me because of me, because there are times when she needs me to -- to be on her side.",
        "Parker: What about what you need?",
        "Jack: I just need her. The tricky part is getting her to believe that. Well, both of you guys go off sometimes, but I wouldn't trade either of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Wedding cake, huh? Is that Janet, me, you, and Liberty? You all made it on top of the cake. That's beautiful, kid.",
        "Johnny: And it's really gonna happen, soon.",
        "Dusty: Soon? I hope. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, I'm -- I'm wondering how much, uh, credit I have on this account. Ooh. Can we bump that number up a little, increase the limit?",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Carly: Could you repeat that, please? I -- I didn't hear it.",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Carly: Thanks for your time. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to call you back.",
        "[Pounds on door]",
        "Carly: Did you finally find your \"Get out of jail free\" card in your wallet?",
        "Craig: You're gonna pay for this. You sent that insurance adjustor to harass my son, to accuse my son.",
        "Carly: Did -- did he say I sent him?",
        "Craig: Yeah, he mentioned your name.",
        "Carly: Well, I just told him the truth.",
        "Craig: You want revenge, you come after me, but you leave my son out of it.",
        "Carly: Craig, that's not what this is about.",
        "Craig: [Sighs] You know, forget it. I -- I really -- I wanted to see Johnny grow up. I -- I wanted to be there for him. I -- I wanted to get to know Gabriel. I wanted to make up -- [Sighs] Forget it. You got your revenge.",
        "Carly: Where are you going?",
        "Craig: Gonna -- I'm gonna confess to the damn arson, all right? I'm gonna go turn myself in.",
        "Carly: Oh, snap out of it. Nobody needs to confess to anything. There's another way.",
        "Craig: I'm listening.",
        "Carly: Well, we could just blame the whole thing on an electrical short caused by faulty wiring. The whole arson idea goes away. The insurance company pays out.",
        "Craig: What about Gabriel?",
        "Carly: Well, he's just a novice electrician who made a mistake.",
        "Craig: That could work.",
        "Carly: It will work.",
        "Craig: However --",
        "Carly: Oh, here it comes.",
        "Craig: That money is actually mine.",
        "Carly: Oh, how do you figure?",
        "Craig: It's my investment, my insurance policy, my money.",
        "Carly: You know what? Eugene and I have become very close. One phone call from me, and you could find yourself behind bars again.",
        "Craig: Okay. Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh. I could come back.",
        "Jack: No. Hey. Uh, so, how did it go when I left?",
        "Janet: It's fine. It's fine. But I came here because I want to tell you something. And -- and since the two of you are here together, I can tell you at the same time. What?",
        "Jack: I already know.",
        "Parker: He told me, too.",
        "Janet: What?! Who told you?",
        "Jack: Dusty mentioned it when I ran into him earlier.",
        "Janet: Why would he do that?",
        "Jack: Because he thought you already told me.",

        "Jack: Well --",
        "Parker: You know what? Now -- now that everybody knows, I just want to let you know that I'm completely on board with helping out and being a big brother.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Parker. I appreciate that. You're -- you're a really good guy.",
        "Jack: Aww!",
        "Parker: But I have to go. I'll see you guys later.",
        "Jack: Wait a second. I thought there was something you wanted to tell me.",
        "Parker: We can talk about it later.",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: Why are you sorry? You're not the one who lied to me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I knew what was going on. I didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't want it to sound like sour grapes, you know? So, did you two work everything out?",
        "Janet: How am I supposed to trust him after he goes and does something like that?",
        "Jack: Oh, please, Janet.",
        "Janet: And besides, he spoiled my surprise.",
        "Jack: Well, he didn't mean to.",
        "Janet: I wanted to see the look on your face when I told you you were having a son.",
        "Jack: Look, Lady, see this look on my face? It -- it pretty much has -- has been just like this since I found out. And I would have been happy either way.",
        "Janet: It kind of makes it seem more real, doesn't it?",
        "Jack: I'm already teaching him how to ride a bike and play basketball.",
        "Janet: Okay, wait. And that movie in your head -- does your son look anything like this?",
        "Jack: Is this him?",
        "Janet: That's our son.",

        "Gabriel: What are you gonna do, hit me again?",
        "Parker: Why don't you get out of my face?",
        "Gabriel: Oh, please, please, hit me. Because every time you do, Liberty comes over and kisses it and makes it all better.",
        "Parker: Oh, really? See, that's funny, because Faith told me what supposedly happens, but I can't believe it.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah? What she say?",
        "Parker: Well, Faith's a teenage drama queen, okay? She just jumps to conclusions about everything. But, see, there's no way that Liberty would ever hook up with a loser like you.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, you're wrong, 'cause Liberty and I did hook up, okay? So go ahead. Take your best shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Okay. Mom is gone, and you have got to tell me what's going on.",
        "Lucinda: Where did mom go?",
        "Faith: She took a walk. I guess she's really mad at you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it's mutual.",
        "Faith: Did she really ask Uncle Craig to stay here?",
        "Lucinda: I'm afraid she did. Please, Darling, do not call him Uncle Craig. He's not part of this family, not anymore.",
        "Faith: Why? I mean, why did she ask him? Is something weird going on with her?",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I think she cannot bear, she cannot accept the fact that your father is thinking about marrying Molly. So she's overcompensating. She's replenishing the -- do you -- do you know what those words mean? Oh, thank God, Honey. She's just filling the house with strays.",
        "Faith: I don't understand why Craig can't stay at his own place.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know! And Gabriel -- he should just do what he says, take his money and get out.",
        "Faith: Gabriel has money?",
        "Lucinda: That's what he claims.",
        "Faith: Probably got it from some old woman he conned.",
        "Lucinda: An old woman?",
        "Faith: You know, like Mom. Or a younger one, like Liberty.",
        "Lucinda: Ah! Liberty doesn't have any money.",
        "Faith: I wasn't talking about money.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh! You mean -- that's what you're telling me, that they're -- [Gasps]",
        "Faith: That's what it looks like.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, if that's true, we're never gonna get rid of that boy. Unless --",
        "Faith: What are you thinking, Grandma?",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Why not? [Laughs] You're so pretty. You're such a pretty girl. You could turn a boy's head.",
        "Faith: Excuse me?",
        "Lucinda: And you're very wily, in a good way, like -- like me. And you might actually feel kind of an achievement to take one for the team.",
        "Faith: Are you asking me to sleep with Gabriel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: This whole family on top of the cake is soon gonna come to life -- you, me, Janet, Liberty. And your little baby brother on the way.",
        "Johnny: And Gabriel, because he's my brother, too.",

        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Johnny: Daddy!",

        "Craig: Yeah, and legal to see me, too.",
        "Dusty: Bail?",
        "Craig: Uh-huh. And you know what? I couldn't wait to take my favorite guy out for ice cream!",
        "Dusty: Sure that's okay?",
        "Craig: I'm not being monitored, if that's what you mean. And guess what? I'm staying at Aunt Lily's with Gabriel. You want to come for a sleepover?",
        "Johnny: Can I?",
        "Dusty: We had an agreement that Johnny would be staying with me.",
        "Craig: Yes, we did. And I'm grateful for everything that you've done. But that agreement was only for as long as I was away. But now that I'm not away, everything gets to go back to normal. So go pack your PJs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know, I would love to hit you, but there's clearly something wrong with your brain already.",
        "Gabriel: Liberty doesn't think so. She likes everything about me.",
        "Parker: See, that's the thing. The only reason she hangs out with you is because she feels sorry for you. It's charity, really.",
        "Gabriel: You wish.",
        "Parker: No, I know, because I know Liberty.",
        "Gabriel: [Laughs] That's right. She always tells me this, how you keep reminding everybody you used to be married.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but more than that, we went through stuff together. And how long have you known her for, like five minutes?",
        "Gabriel: Oh, no. Knowing Liberty took me a lot longer than that.",
        "Parker: You need to stop making it sound like she's so into you, because she's not!",
        "Gabriel: Okay.",
        "Parker: No, she is sweet, and she's nice, and the only reason she hangs out with you is because she feels sorry for people that have less than her.",
        "Gabriel: What, you're saying I can't -- can't treat her well, huh? I can't buy her nice things?",
        "Parker: Haven't you spent all the money that you store from me already?",
        "Gabriel: Okay, I don't need your money, all right? I got my own.",
        "Parker: Where did you get that?",
        "Gabriel: You know, I was gonna take this and the money I stowed away and blow this lousy town, but you just gave me a reason to stay. Oh, and if you see me and Liberty out together, try not to look too jealous, okay? I wouldn't want my lady feeling sorry for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you cute thing, adorable thing. I would never suggest that you do anything like that.",
        "Faith: It sounded that way to me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my heavens.",
        "Faith: What was the whole \"Take one for the team\" thing?",
        "Lucinda: Well, Honey, I just had an idea. You know, you were involved with drugs at -- at boarding school.",
        "Faith: I don't do drugs, not anymore. Why does everyone always accuse me of doing stuff like that?",
        "Lucinda: Not me. I'm not accusing you. I was thinking of recruiting you, and I was thinking that if we had some drugs -- I've got a stash, you know, left over from my chemo. If somehow those drugs got into Gabriel's backpack, do the math. Do the math. What would you think, huh? What do you think?",
        "Faith: Good to know my grandmother is a pusher and not a pimp.",
        "Lucinda: [Laughs] I thought you wanted Gabriel gone as much as I do.",
        "Faith: Nobody wants Gabriel gone as much as you do.",
        "Lucinda: You're wonderful.",
        "Faith: What's up with that?",
        "Lucinda: I love you, Baby. [Laughs]",
        "Lily: What's going on?",
        "Faith: Nothing.",
        "Lucinda: Nothing.",
        "Lily: Then why do you both look so guilty?",
        "Faith: Because you asked Craig and Gabriel to move in. And now everyone's acting completely insane.",
        "Lily: Now do you want to tell me what's really going on with you and Faith?",
        "Lucinda: Nothing's going on.",

        "Janet: Hey, are you gonna drink that, or are you just gonna stare at your son all day?",
        "Jack: He just looks so calm in there, peaceful. Got a nice, warm tummy, don't you?",
        "[Janet chuckles]",
        "Jack: Who does he look like to you?",
        "Janet: Um, well, nobody at this point.",
        "Jack: He looks like a Jackson to me.",
        "Janet: Oh. Are we going with the \"J's\"?",
        "Jack: Certainly. Come on! Jack, Janet, Jackson.",
        "Janet: Jude.",
        "Jack: Jerry.",
        "Janet: Seinfeld? No. No, no, no, no, no. How about Joaquin?",
        "Jack: [Laughs] Jehosaphat.",
        "Both: Jehosaphat Snyder Ciccone! Not a good --",
        "Jack: Rolls right off the tongue.",
        "Janet: No, no, no.",
        "Jack: You want to talk to him?",
        "Janet: I probably should.",

        "Faith: To stay?",
        "Gabriel: Yes. That gonna make you crazy?",
        "Faith: Yes.",
        "Gabriel: [Sighs] Then I may just have to stay forever.",
        "Faith: Why would you stay in a place where absolutely nobody likes you?",
        "Gabriel: Well, your mom likes me.",
        "Faith: She's got issues.",
        "Gabriel: Liberty likes me.",

        "Gabriel: Well, if you play your cards right, your pal Parker.",
        "Lucinda: See what's going on out there?",
        "Lily: Hmm. Faith and Gabriel are actually talking.",
        "Lucinda: The boy's trouble, Darling. He's trouble. It would be your fault if his bad behavior rubs off on Faith.",
        "Lily: I doubt that will happen.",
        "Lucinda: Because you've saved him with your generosity.",
        "Lily: Because, as Faith pointed out, she doesn't live here anymore.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, she's a kid. Anyway, she's down the hill. [Laughs] And I don't know, proximity trumps hormones. You know that well.",
        "Lily: Mother, I really think that you should go.",
        "Lucinda: Of course I should go while you bring out the welcome mat for Craig.",
        "Lily: You're trying to unravel my family, and I won't have it.",
        "Lucinda: No, Dear. Holden and the kids -- that's your family, not this boy and his pathological father.",
        "Lily: I am a grown woman capable of making my own decisions and running my own life.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, of course you are. You've been doing such a wonderful job of it of late.",
        "Lily: Oh. Let's not start trading life-altering mistakes, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: No, but let us not forget the Damian fiasco.",
        "Lily: I haven't. Every morning when I wake up, the first thought is one word -- Holden.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Lily --",
        "Lily: But he's gone, Mother, and I can't change that.",
        "Lucinda: Of course you can change it. It's just that you don't want to. And you distract yourself by -- by peopling your house with needy misfits. It's ridiculous.",
        "Lily: I've lost a huge part of my family. The one thing I can do is make sure that that doesn't happen to Gabriel and Craig.",
        "Lucinda: You're really set, aren't you, on this?",
        "Lily: Yes, Mother, I am.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it's good you got me. [Sighs]",

        "Janet: You're asking me to marry you when I am still so mad at you?",
        "Dusty: No. I am showing you why I've been saying all the wrong things. I've been carrying this around, waiting for the right time --",
        "Janet: There's nothing to say.",
        "Dusty: -- So that it wouldn't be like last time, when you said no.",
        "Janet: I can't.",
        "Dusty: I know. At least now I know why.",
        "Janet: You do?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I do. You think I force things instead of letting things, you know, just --",
        "Janet: Evolve.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that's right. Maybe from now on, I'll let things evolve. And when I do, I'll have the ring standing by. What do you say?",
        "Janet: Tell me about your wife.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Janet: Because I'm asking. Tell me about Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: She was my wife. I loved her. She died. What's left to say?",
        "Janet: How did you get her to fall in love with you?",
        "Dusty: My cooking. What is it?",
        "Janet: Did you guys get together before she was pregnant with Johnny or after?",
        "Dusty: After -- after she had him. What are you waiting to hear?",
        "Janet: And when did you know that she fell in love with you? Not -- not when she said it, but when you felt it.",
        "Dusty: Craig made my wife think that Johnny was dead. I helped her find the truth.",
        "Janet: So after you brought her back her son? I'll tell you something. That's not why she fell in love with you.",
        "Dusty: Oh, no? How do you know?",
        "Janet: Because I see what she saw.",
        "Dusty: Are you saying you still love me?",
        "Janet: And I'll tell you why. Because you listen. You weigh everything. You pay attention. And you have this quiet confidence. And when a guy that is that careful tells you that he loves you, that it's you that he wants, you believe it.",
        "Dusty: But you want Jack.",
        "Janet: I wanted Jack to love me more than he loved Carly. He doesn't. I want you to love me enough to respect me.",
        "Dusty: I do. Yes, I do.",
        "Janet: Lying to me does not show respect, okay? Trying to control my life and make decisions for me is the opposite of that. See, you're a fixer, and I'm not a very good fixee.",
        "Dusty: All right. Oh, come on. We can both fix things. We can take turns.",
        "Janet: That's not gonna turn things around.",
        "Dusty: All right. Well, we can still talk, right? I mean, we can still fix things here. Slow down. We got to slow down.",
        "Janet: Well, I can't take your money. Um, I -- I can't stay in that apartment. And, uh, I can't even take that damn washing machine.",
        "Dusty: Fine. No problem. Done. Done. We'll take it slow, and then I'll try the proposal again.",
        "Janet: We can't be together, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Don't do this.",
        "Janet: I know what you did you did from the heart. But that doesn't work for me.",
        "Dusty: If you give up the apartment, where are you gonna live?",
        "Janet: I'll figure it out.",
        "Dusty: Oh, come on.",
        "Janet: No, come on.",
        "Dusty: Come on. It doesn't have to be this way.",
        "Janet: I've been through this before. I've been in this spot, and I've managed to make it on the other side. Don't worry about me.",
        "Dusty: Janet, wait a sec. Where are you gonna go?",
        "Janet: I don't know.",
