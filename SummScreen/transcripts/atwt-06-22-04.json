        "Hal: Okay, everybody! Listen up. Now hear this. I just got a call from a reporter fishing for news about Dusty Donovan. Now if anybody leaks one word, you are suspended without pay. Now is that understood? Everybody, is that clear? No exceptions.",
        "Jack: Uh, Hal?",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Jack: There's a federal agent waiting to talk to you.",
        "Hal: Already?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hal: Oh, man. Fox said there might be somebody showing up looking for info on the Donovan money-laundering thing, but, Jack, now I've got this guy in the middle of a kidnapping, the last thing I need is some yutz in a suit telling me how to do my job.",
        "Nikki: If you're scared of getting your pretty little toes messed up, Lieutenant, perhaps you should consider some steel-toed shoes.",
        "Hal: Nikki.",
        "Nikki: Hi, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Starziak, its Donovan. I gotta find this guy who crashed my club, the guy with the tattoo on his wrist. If he's not one of yours, you shouldn't have a problem giving him up. You know? And don't tell me you can't find out who this guy is. With all your connections, you could find Jimmy Hoffa in a blackout. Remember, big guy? I really need you on this one. Call me back, would you?",
        "Lucy: Where were you?",
        "Dusty: Why? Did you miss me?",
        "Lucy: You said you weren't going to leave me by myself again.",
        "Dusty: I didn't. I was right outside.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but I didn't know that.",
        "Dusty: What's your problem? You want me to tell you when I go to the john, too?",
        "Lucy: Never mind.",
        "Dusty: Oh, come on. Get a grip. You're freaking out over nothing.",
        "Lucy: I was scared, okay? There, I said it. Are you happy? Not that you care anyway.",

        "Nancy: Christopher, dear, what brings you by?",
        "Chris: Mother asked me to come by pick up the things that she's donating for the charity bazaar at the clinic.",
        "Nancy: Oh, yeah. I saw them in the other room.",
        "Chris: You playing?",
        "Nancy: Pardon?",
        "Chris: I saw the clue circled in the paper.",
        "Nancy: Oh, well -- yes. I'm following it in the paper just for fun. It keeps the old brain cells working.",
        "Chris: Hmm. You know, Alison and I were supposed to be a team, but, you know, with my work schedule I couldn't very well just run around with patients waiting on me.",
        "Nancy: Of course you couldn't.",
        "Chris: Well, I just hope that she doesn't give up.",
        "Nancy: If there is one thing I've learned about that girl, it's that she rarely gives up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I'm pretty sure my wife would have told me if she had changed her mind about signing up for the competition. When you saw her with Doc Reese, are you sure they were looking for a key?",
        "Alison: They were crawling around on the ground together. What else would they be doing?",
        "[Tom remembering]",
        "Margo: She did think I was part of the contest. So I didn't even bother to set her straight.",
        "Tom: You okay?",
        "Margo: I'm fine. Why? I'm fine.",
        "Tom: Well, you just seem a little preoccupied. I wondered if it had anything to do with Doc.",

        "Casey: Dad?",
        "Tom: Yeah, what?",
        "Casey: When are they gonna let us in the church? I mean, did you ask?",
        "Tom: Look, I gotta go, and I'm really sorry.",
        "Casey: What? Why?",
        "Tom: I have to get back to the office.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but we --",
        "Tom: Because this is important.",
        "Casey: Yeah, so is this contest.",
        "Tom: Right. And there will be other keys. I'll promise we'll get one of those. This -- this can't wait.",

        "Jessica: You can't let her in here.",
        "Doc: I can't leave her standing in the hall. She knows I'm here.",
        "Margo: Doc, I know you're in there. I hear you.",
        "Jessica: What are you going to say?",
        "Doc: Don't worry about that. You just get in there. Ah, just a second. Fell asleep in here.",

        "Doc: All right, here I come.",
        "Margo: I'm -- I'm here. Are you going to invite me in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: As you can see, I fell asleep watching the sports channel.",
        "Margo: Ooh, you're some sleeper.",
        "Doc: Well, I didn't think you were gonna show up.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I had a family emergency.",
        "Doc: Oh, okay. Sounds good. Listen, I'm getting used to you not showing up anyways.",
        "Margo: No, really.",
        "Doc: No, you don't have to explain anything to me. It's none of my business.",
        "Margo: Well, I didn't want you to think that I just blew you off.",
        "Doc: I didn't. I didn't. You know, actually we should just probably pick this up some other time.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. Listen to me. Listen to me. I was on my way over here, and I checked my messages. And I had to turn around. But, Doc, I'm here now.",
        "Doc: Why?",
        "Margo: Why? You know what? You're upset because I kept you waiting. You're angry.",
        "Doc: No, I'm not. Not really. No, no. Actually, it gave me time to think. I think you should go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Oh, Nik, it's so great to see you. And you look great. Of course that runs in the family. Hey, why didn't you tell me you were coming? When did you get in?",
        "Nikki: I wanted it to be a surprise. Surprise.",
        "Hal: Surprise. Hey, I thought Agent Fox was working this case. When did you get involved?",
        "Nikki: Another guy took over, and then he broke his leg, so I volunteered. Figured why not? Come back to Oakdale, work with my Dad -- close this money laundering case, make you proud. So, what's happenin trail?",
        "Hal: Well, honey, we got a lot bigger problems than money laundering, right now. Donovan's managed to get himself right in the middle of a kidnapping.",
        "Nikki: What?",
        "Hal: Yeah --",
        "Nikki: Kidnapping who?",
        "Hal: Lucy Montgomery.",
        "Jack: Not that anyone's to the feds.",
        "Hal: She's not just a fed. She's my daughter, Jack.",
        "Nikki: Where's the file?",
        "Hal: Uh, no, honey, no. He's -- he's right. That's really all the information that you get right now. See, Miss Montgomery's Mother is a political figure, and we don't want the press anywhere near this kidnapping, okay? But you can have anything you want on the money laundering.",
        "Nikki: Are you kidding me?",
        "Hal: No, hon, that's -- that's straight up. That's the one line you can't cross. Deal?",
        "[Nikki sighs]",
        "Nikki: Deal.",
        "Hal: Okay, deal. Now, first let me say that I'm just so happy to see you, and I'm just as proud of you as I could be. Now, that being said, what can I tell you about the money? I'm at your disposal.",
        "Nikki: You know what I would like first?",
        "Hal: Hmm?",
        "Nikki: I would really love a warm cup of coffee.",
        "Hal: Oh --",
        "Nikki: This one is really cold.",
        "Hal: A little caffeine to get the anti-crime juices flowing. Coming right up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Well, if we're gonna be here awhile we might as well make some pallets. I mean, we have enough paper products.",
        "Dusty: Make some what?",
        "Lucy: Pallets.",
        "Dusty: What is that?",
        "Lucy: To sleep on, like a mattress on the floor.",
        "Dusty: Oh, okay. Yeah, whatever, yeah.",
        "Lucy: Where do you want yours?",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Dusty: I don't mind.",
        "Lucy: Stay out of my way.",
        "Dusty: Pick a place and park it. What do I care?",
        "Lucy: You know, could you at least try and being civilized?",
        "Dusty: What am I doing?",
        "Lucy: You're being crass.",
        "Dusty: I'm being crass? Listen to you. Listen to the way you -- you don't even speak English. You speak, uh, Grandma. You speak like Lucinda.",
        "Lucy: I hope you're not trying to insult me, because I consider it a compliment.",
        "Dusty: Do you consider it a compliment?",
        "Lucy: My Grandmother is someone who made something of herself, which is more than I can say for you.",
        "Dusty: Oh, wait a sec. You might want to reassess that argument. Because this crass lowlife over here is keeping you breathing right now. Which is much more than we can say for dear old Granny, or your high-falutin' Mama, or your worthless Father, so I would take kindly to a little more appreciation and a lot less lip. You got it? Lucy --",
        "[Door slamming]",
        "Lucy: What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: I gotta get us something to eat.",
        "Lucy: You mean, go?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'm gonna go. You must be starving too, right? It looks like you don't eat much, but it's been a while since you had that candy bar.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, of course, I'm starving, too. But couldn't I come with you?",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. I'm not gonna be long. I promise. I swear.",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Dusty: You're not gonna be too scared, are ya?",
        "Lucy: I'll manage.",
        "Dusty: Of course you will. Listen, I'm going to give you this in case anything comes up. Remember, the battery's almost dead.",
        "Lucy: You trust me with your phone?",
        "Dusty: Well, yeah. It's for an emergency use only. It's not for gabbing with your friends. I want you to feel safe.",
        "Lucy: You got it -- no gabbing.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Lucy: Hey, I'll make up a bed up for you while you're gone.",
        "Dusty: Whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Hot coffee.",
        "Nikki: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Hal: You know, you amaze me.",
        "Nikki: Why?",
        "Hal: Well, you're just out of law school, and bam -- like a rocket, here you are -- where it took me years and years to get to.",
        "Nikki: Well, like you said, it's good to hit the ground running. But I'm not even close to where you are.",
        "Hal: No, you're past me. You're a fed. I'm just a local guy.",
        "Nikki: Top dog. I mean, the head chief, the king. I'm still earning my stripes.",
        "Hal: But they gave you your own case, Nikki. I mean, they've gotta have a lot of confidence in you.",
        "Nikki: Yeah. But I'm the local top dog's daughter.",
        "Jack: I just got off the phone with Agent Fox over at the IRS.",
        "Hal: And?",
        "Jack: And you wanna tell him or should I?",
        "Hal: Tell me what?",
        "Jack: Agent Munson, with all due respect, isn't exactly on the Donovan case.",
        "Nikki: Yes, I am.",
        "Jack: As an assistant to the agent that broke his leg. You were supposed to pick up the data on the Donovan money laundering and bring it back to him.",
        "Hal: Is that true?",
        "Jack: Can I have my file back, please?",
        "Hal: Do you mean this one?",
        "Jack: That's it.",
        "Hal: We'll take it from here, Jack. Thanks for the update.",
        "Nikki: Thanks, pal.",
        "Hal: Nikki, I appreciate ingenuity and all that -- but did you pinch that file off his desk?",
        "Nikki: No. He gave it to me.",
        "Hal: Under false pretenses?",
        "Nikki: They aren't false. I am -- what's wrong with bringing my boss back more information than he asked for? That's how you get ahead, right?",
        "Hal: Yes, but --",
        "Nikki: Dad -- I'm working as a bean counter doing tax returns and audit records. If they keep having me do this any longer, I'm gonna go crazy.",
        "Hal: Nikki, I sympathize. But I can't authorize this.",
        "Nikki: What? I'll be discreet. Anything you need me to do -- I'll be helpful, an extra set of eyes. I learned from the best.",
        "Hal: You went to a good school, yes --",
        "Nikki: I mean you. And this could be my big break, if you let it be. And what's wrong with having another foot soldier in the war on crime?",
        "Hal: All right. But in this office, Nikki Munson, our relationship is completely professional. I mean, one false move and I will bust your chops.",
        "Nikki: I wouldn't expect it to be any other way. Thanks, Chief.",
        "Hal: Oh, one more thing. Nobody calls me chief.",

        "Aaron: Hey.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here?",
        "Aaron: Same thing you're doing here.",
        "Alison: You figured out this clue on your own?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Why, what do you think that I'm not smart enough to?",
        "Alison: Will you stop copying me. \"Flowers that no water need.\"",
        "Aaron: Wait a second, wait a second -- \"ten paces\"",
        "Alison: \"Beneath the word that all should heed -- oh, will you be careful! You can't just go breaking stuff in a sacred church! There's a door down here. Help pull. Help to pull this. It's mine. It's mine, I've got it!",

        "Tom: Oh, sorry, I punched out.",
        "Chris: Hi.",
        "Kim: Hey! Hi, darling. Great, more manpower. How about giving us a hand. All these boxes have to get to the clinic today. And, I'll tell you, I'll make a deal with you -- if Margo's working late, I will make dinner for you in exchange for your help.",
        "Tom: I would love to, but I'm kind of in a rush. Is Dad around?",
        "Kim: Uh, no. He's with his mistress.",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Kim: His mistress -- Memorial Hospital. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type.",
        "Tom: What's that, the news?",
        "Kim: Yeah. I turn it on while I'm making dinner, without the sound. That way I can tell if somebody's having a hissy fit on camera. You want me to turn the sound up?",
        "Tom: No, no. I just -- who -- I mean, who is that? Who's doing the sports? What happened to Doc Reese?",
        "Kim: Oh, Doc. Doc called in. He's got some kind of a personal crisis he had to take care of and wanted the night off.",
        "Tom: Did he say what?",
        "Kim: No. I just hope it's nothing to do with the law. It's always something with that guy. Although, I have to admit, he's been a lot better lately. And I think I owe that all to you. You know, that little chat you had with him.",
        "Tom: What are you talking about?",
        "Kim: Well, I asked Margo to ask you to speak to him about his behavior. I just assumed you had. Did Margo forget to mention it to you?",
        "Tom: Yeah, she must have forgotten or maybe I did. I've been pretty busy lately.",
        "Kim: Oh. Well, I don't know. Something came along and changed Doc's disposition. I don't care what it was. I just hope it continues.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You're just sending me away?",
        "Doc: I think it's the best.",
        "Margo: You think it's for the best?",
        "Doc: I just don't want to force anything. Can you understand that?",
        "Margo: You are not forcing me to do anything.",
        "Doc: All right. The bottom line -- it's just bad timing. I bumped into some friends who are staying at the hotel. We decided to get together for an all- night poker game. It's as simple as that.",
        "Margo: Why are you so angry with me?",
        "Doc: I am not angry with you, all right? I just know I put a lot of pressure on you. And I'm starting to feel bad about that. You have a good marriage. You have a wonderful family. I don't want to be the one that ruins that. That's it.",
        "Margo: Since when?",
        "Doc: I guess, since you said this was a pattern for me. You know, the married woman thing. I just don't want you to be another notch on the bedpost. Okay? I care about you, Margo, believe it or not. I do care about you.",
        "Margo: You know what I find really hard to believe? How you made this complete 180 turn in a matter of hours, Doc.",
        "Doc: But why question it? Huh? Why don't you just -- I mean, you're off the hook. Why don't you just go and be happy?",
        "Margo: What if I don't want to be off the hook?",
        "Doc: The timing is just not right, right now. Okay? Just, just go.",
        "Margo: No. Something is just not right, right now.",
        "Doc: What do you mean by that?",
        "Margo: I'm a cop, Doc.",
        "Doc: Oh, what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Margo: I hear a lot of stories. You start to learn how to tell when they don't add up.",

        "Margo: All right, Doc, I'm sorry.",
        "Doc: Margo, we have been going round and round on this. And you've made your choices over and over again. And it hasn't been me. Now granted, you're here right now. But if we go to the bed and things got hot and heavy, who's to say what you would do? You'd probably back out as usual. And you know what? You probably should back out as usual. It's probably the best thing for you. But not for me. Okay, I can't just drop my life whenever you want to flirt around with the possibility. I'm not your call boy, Margo. I'm not your call boy.",
        "Margo: I -- never thought that you were.",
        "Doc: Good. Because we will be in each other's lives. But, when you leave here, I want you to leave as a friend. No hard feelings.",

        "Margo: It doesn't feel fine. It -- you know, I just need to have a little time to collect my thoughts. I've got to talk to you, Doc. Can we at least meet at the Lakeview lounge tomorrow morning? In the morning. That's innocent enough, right?",
        "Doc: Sure.",
        "Jessica: I don't know how you managed that. You obviously have experience with these sorts of things.",

        "Alison: No, please? Please, please, please, please, please, please -- you don't know how much that key means to me. It would mean the world to me if I could just show -- I could show Chris and his parents, and then they'd be so proud. Even just a key. Not even if I won.

        "Margo: Yeah, I hear you.",
        "Ben: So you meeting Tom?",
        "Margo: No, just -- I had a really rough day. And I thought I'd unload here, before I unload at home.",
        "Ben: Well, that's a good marital strategy. I think I'm gonna try it. I'll have what she is having. I've been a little stressed myself with this whole fertility issue. Which I'm sure you know all about, since you and Jess talk about everything.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know.",
        "Ben: She's pretty desperate to have a baby, like it's taking over our whole lives. I mean, now don't get me wrong, I want one, too. I'm really worried about her. Especially since the incident with the fertility drugs and her going into the hospital. And she refuses to slow down or even step back from it. She's obsessed.",
        "Margo: Well, Ben, you know, it's different for men. It's different for you guys. You can reproduce up until the day you step into the grave. Maybe the day before. But it's not that way for us. We can't. And Jessica wants this baby so much, and she doesn't know when her cutoff line is. She doesn't know when her body is gonna betray her. But it is gonna betray her. And Ben, man, if she loses out on this chance to have a baby on her own -- she's gonna need your arms around her, cushioning the blow. She's gonna need a lot of love to fill up the emptiness. She's gonna need to know that you will cut her some slack and that you will be right there by her side through it all.",

But once I walk out that door, I will not speak of it or think of it again. And unless you want an all-out war with me, I advise you to do the same.",
