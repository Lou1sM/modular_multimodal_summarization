        "Lucinda: Kidnapped? No, darling. I can't. I don't want to be kidnapped today.",
        "Sierra: Come on, Mother. You're always going from one crisis to the next. Come on, you need a break.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Darlings, I -- I promise I'll fit in a day next week.",
        "Lily: No. Today.",
        "Lucinda: I can't. I have an appointment today.",
        "Lily: Cancel it. You're Lucinda Walsh. You can do anything you want.",
        "Lucinda: Tell that to the man upstairs. No, I can't. It's sweet of you to ask me, darling, but I really, I just can't. I'll take a rain check.",
        "Sierra: Has something happened?",
        "Lucinda: No, no.",
        "Lily: Because you've been acting a little strange the last couple of days.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know, honey. Something's on my mind. That's all. It's nothing.",
        "Sierra: You know, Mother, when you asked me to take over the domestic division, I didn't know how, you know, demanding it would be. I could use a break. So if I could use a break, then you could use a break.",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you take a break, darling? If you need it, you should take it. Your daughter is in summer school and Williamstown is just lovely this time of the year.",
        "Lily: What's this?",
        "Lucinda: It's just something legal. You know all the stuff you have to go through, Walter -- you know, all that. Eileen!",
        "Sierra: You know, if it's about the Braxton merger, well, I'd be happy to call Lord Peter.",
        "Lucinda: No, I already spoke to him. I've taken care of that. Eileen, thank you. Put that with my briefcase.",
        "Eileen: The one you're taking on your trip?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Sierra: What trip?",
        "Lucinda: I'm going to Chicago for an appointment.",
        "Sierra: No, that's next week.",
        "Lucinda: No, dear. No, it's today.",
        "Sierra: Are you sure? You know, I'm going to call and check that out.",
        "Lucinda: Don't do that. You don't have to. I rescheduled it myself.",
        "Sierra: But I'm supposed to be in on that meeting.",
        "Lily: Aren't you going to a fundraiser tonight?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, dear. And I thought maybe you'd be kind enough, you know, to go with your sister in my stead, all right? And, Sierra, darling Sierra, you can sit in on the meeting next week, okay? And I'm late, so I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Don't try to pretend like you're the only one who's got Craig's number. I know him pretty well. I dated his son.",
        "Dusty: How did that go?",
        "Jennifer: That's not the point. Mike and I are very clear about what we want and what we don't want. And for you to imply that we are somehow stupid or naive about --",
        "Dusty: I didn't imply that. Mike's a great guy. But I got to tell you, this is way out of his league.",
        "Jennifer: Are you implying that my husband isn't capable of protecting me?",
        "Dusty: From Craig? No way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what? Whatever Carly needed, I'm sure it can wait. Margaritas, thank you. You're amazing.",
        "Paul: Well, I remembered. Here, sit down. What is it? What's the matter?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Why?",
        "Paul: Is it Daniel? It's your mom? Is it Hal?",
        "Emily: Um, all of the above.",
        "Paul: Emily, you can trust me, you know that. You can trust me. And you can tell me anything. We can always talk.",
        "Emily: I don't know how you're going to feel about me after I tell you this. But the call from Carly, it wasn't for me. She wanted to talk to you. About Rosanna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna doesn't love you. She loves Paul.",
        "Craig: Are you sure? He let her down. She's a smart woman.",
        "Carly: And she's wonderful.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Carly: And she's beautiful.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Why don't you do the right thing? Why don't you think about someone other than yourself for once? Why don't you go out there and tell Rosanna that she deserves to have it all. Real love. True love, and not this marriage of convenience. [Cell phone ringing] Oh, that's Paul. Dammit, Craig! You have no right.",
        "Craig: Do you really think Rosanna Cabot is going to spend the rest of her life pining for Paul?",
        "Carly: I told her that I would like her to find someone who makes her happy.",
        "Craig: Your sister is a grown woman. She knows what she wants and she knows she wants to marry me.",
        "Carly: We'll see.",
        "Craig: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Carly: It means that there is still time. There is still time for Paul to track me down. There is still time for Rosanna to change her mind. And there is still time for you to get lost.",
        "Craig: Nice.",
        "Justice of peace: Sorry to interrupt, but has there been a change of plans?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Not at all. Come on, Carly. We wouldn't want to keep your sister waiting. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, is everything okay?",
        "Rosanna: Of course, I just dropped my bouquet.",
        "Jack: She's got a little case of the jitters.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's perfectly natural, isn't it? It's practically a tradition.",
        "Jack: Along with second thoughts.",
        "Margo: You know, if you want to take some time, think this over, Rosanna?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you know, we could come back a different day or not.",
        "Tom: I'm sure everyone would understand if you changed your mind.",
        "Rosanna: No, of course not. Look, there's no need for concern. I'm fine. Just where's my fianc\u00e9?",
        "Craig: Right here! With our witness. Jack, I'll trade you.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: I just can't believe that she's going to go through with this.",
        "Justice of peace: Are we ready to begin?",
        "Craig: Absolutely.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, I need to talk to you first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I keep getting Carly's voicemail.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I should have told you right away. I know, I just thought it was Rosanna, you know, pulling her same tricks, doing whatever she can to get your attention. I'm so sorry.",
        "Paul: I'm surprised after last night that Rosanna would even want to see me.",
        "Emily: What about you? [Paul sighs] Rosanna?",
        "Paul: I wanted to hurt her. Last night, I wanted to hurt her the way she hurt me when she left me. And I did. She was devastated. You could see it in her face. And I thought that that would make me feel great. You know, vindicated. But it didn't. I just -- I felt like a heel.",
        "Emily: That's because you're a good person.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Go do what you have to do.",
        "Paul: Will you be here when i get back?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'll be here. You hurt him again, Rosanna, I'll claw your eyes out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Finished?",
        "Lucinda: You'd think that in the age of the computer, you would have all this.",
        "Nurse: We do. Who is picking you up after the procedure?",
        "Lucinda: My car is coming to pick me up.",
        "Nurse: You should have a friend or relative with you.",
        "Lucinda: I believe this is outpatient surgery.",
        "Nurse: It is. But you'll be coming out from under anesthesia. You're going to want to have someone drive you home and make sure you get settled.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Okay. Okay.",
        "Nurse: All right. Thank you.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, why won't anybody tell me why you and Lily broke up?",
        "Holden: Maybe because it's none of your business.",
        "Meg: You're my brother.",
        "Holden: Maybe because you're dying to know.",
        "Meg: So what? Everybody else knows.",
        "Holden: Maybe because you have been competing with my wife since Dusty Donovan picked her over you.",
        "Meg: Your wife?",
        "Holden: Until the divorce is final, she's still my wife.",
        "Meg: Look, it's never easy ending a marriage. But all I care about is that you're hurting. Josh and I split up.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I heard about that. What happened there?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Meg: You know what? Finish your sandwich. I'll get that. Snyder residence.",
        "Lucinda: Meg?",
        "Meg: Who's this?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, surely, surely you recognize my dacoit tones. It's Lucinda Walsh.",
        "Meg: Mamma's not here.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want to talk to your Mother. I'm calling to speak to you. I have a favor to ask of you. My assistant is out of town on an emergency and the hospital doesn't want to release me later without a personage to take me home.",
        "Meg: Well, what about one of your daughters?",
        "Lucinda: My daughters don't know about this, and I've explained that. My choice is you. Are you coming? Meg? Do you want me to write you a check? Or buy you a present? Take you out to lunch?",
        "Meg: All you have to do is ask. I'll be right there. Something's come up. I gotta go.",
        "Holden: Everything okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Everything is just fine. We'll pick this up later?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Meg: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Nothing against your husband, I like him very much.",
        "Jennifer: You just don't have any respect for him.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I have total respect for him. He's not vicious, he's not ruthless. That's the problem. Craig is. You understand?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, mike and I are well aware of how nasty Craig is. Look at what he did to my Mother.",
        "Dusty: Mm. Busted up her marriage, took her money.",
        "Jennifer: Exactly.",
        "Dusty: That's not what I'm talking about.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then maybe you need to make yourself a little more clear.",
        "Dusty: Craig just takes whatever he wants. I'm not talking about theft or humiliation. He'll take a life if he has to.",
        "Jennifer: Are you telling me that Craig has killed someone? And that you know this for a fact? You have proof. Dusty, why haven't you gone to the police?",
        "Dusty: Because I promised Lucy I wouldn't.",
        "Jennifer: Lucy knows about this?",
        "Dusty: Lucy's one of the victims. One of the lucky ones, 'cause she survived.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Craig: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm certainly wondering if I'm doing the right thing.",
        "Craig: Why? Because other people say so?",
        "Rosanna: No, I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Craig: Well, so, you -- you're family's unhappy. So is mine. They don't think I'm good enough for you. I don't blame them. But the point is this is our marriage for our reasons. Nobody knows what we have. They don't know what we've lost. What it takes to get up every morning. Accept that loss. Start over every day. Okay?",
        "Rosanna: It's not easy.",
        "Craig: No, it's not. And the only thing that helps is having someone who understands. I know you need that. I need that. I need you to marry me, share my new child, to help me be a better parent, be a better person, be better groomed. And in return, I will help you make a new beginning. So, what do you say?",
        "Rosanna: We made such a mess of it last time.",
        "Craig: I made a mess. You were perfect. [Craig chuckles] We have nothing to lose. So, let's start over. Make each other happy.",
        "Tom: What do you think the chances are that she's telling him to take a hike?",
        "Katie: She marries him and Mike and Jennifer are in for such a tough fight.",
        "Margo: She marries him and she's in for a tough fight.",
        "Jack: It's out of your hands, Carly.",
        "Carly: I hope she's telling him she's changed her mind.",
        "Jack: You'll soon find out.",
        "Craig: Hey, people. Sit down. Come on, come on. We're having a wedding. Come on, sit down, please. Thank you. Sit down. Sit down.",
        "Carly: Wait. Rosanna -- there's something I need to say.",
        "Rosanna: That's okay, Carly. There's something that I should say first. If you don't mind. As you all know, Craig and I have been married before. Twice. And failed at it rather spectacularly. But we're still friends. Good friends. And I think that means something very special. And we wanted all of you to be here because we love you, and we wish you joy and peace and prosperity and love. And we hope that you wish us the same. Okay.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: I think we're ready.",
        "Justice of peace: At last. [Rosanna chuckles] Friends, family, we're gathered here to witness the marriage of Rosanna Cabot and Craig Montgomery.",

        "Paul: Rosanna?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Rosanna: With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Dusty: What happened?",
        "Jennifer: Craig married Rosanna. There's no stopping him now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice of peace: Do you, Craig, take this woman to be your lawful wife?",
        "Craig: I do. With this ring, I thee wed. For the last time.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Boy, that's not too shabby, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: It's just the beginning, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Justice of peace: Do you, Rosanna, take this man to be your lawful husband?",
        "Rosanna: I do. But I don't have a ring.",
        "Craig: Oh, no. I still have mine.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. [Rosanna chuckles] With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Justice of peace: By the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife.",
        "Craig: What? What's wrong?",
        "Rosanna: Nothing. I just had a strange feeling.",
        "Craig: Remorse already?",
        "Rosanna: No. No, of course not.",
        "Craig: We're gonna be happy. I know. You won't be sorry you did that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Holden: Hello.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm looking for Lucinda Walsh's contact person.",
        "Meg: I'm right here.",
        "Nurse: Oh. Sorry. She's right here.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lily: How was your trip?",
        "Holden: It was good. What're you doing here?",
        "Lily: I'm looking for someone to watch the girls, 'cause my mom was called away to Chicago last minute and she asked me to go to this fundraiser in her place tonight. So, could you watch the girls?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Holden: I just got a call from someone who was looking for Lucinda's contact person. I thought that they were looking for you, but you walked in the door.",
        "Lily: Who was it?",
        "Holden: I didn't get a chance to ask. They suddenly said that she was here, and then they hung up.",
        "Lily: It's not Sierra, because I was just with Sierra.",
        "Holden: And your mom is on her way to Chicago?",
        "Lily: Yeah, she's en route, yeah.",
        "Holden: I don't know. Maybe it was nothing.",
        "Lily: I'll give her a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: They are a little backed up, but they will be with you in a few minutes.",
        "Lucinda: If I ran my business the way these people run theirs, you know --",
        "Meg: No one would get sick.",
        "Lucinda: Right.",
        "Meg: Right, yeah.",
        "Lucinda: Hopefully. Hopefully.",
        "Meg: So, are you gonna fill me in? Are you and lily on the outs?",
        "Lucinda: Of course not.",
        "Meg: So, what's the real reason you won't tell her, or Sierra.",
        "Lucinda: I want my privacy. And I don't want to be fussed over.",
        "Meg: You know, you never were really good at letting other people take care of you.",
        "Lucinda: I don't need other people to take care of me.",
        "Meg: Okay. Yep. No matter what hospital you go to, they always seem to put these at the same place. Here we go.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, I'm not cold.",
        "Meg: No, no. You're scared. And that's okay.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Nurse: They're ready for you now, Ms. Walsh. You can change into your gown.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's stylish. You will be fine.",
        "Lucinda: Of course. It's just a colossal waste of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: There we go. I would like to propose a toast. To my once and present bride.",
        "Tom: Here here.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and I'd like to say thank you all for coming.",
        "Craig: And I would like to thank you for your support. This is a fresh start for me and my beautiful wife. And with her help, I'm going to be a better husband. A better brother, and God willing, a better father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Craig took a gamble and lost. The cops caught up to his phony adoption ordeal.",
        "Jennifer: So that's why Rosanna lost Cabot.",
        "Dusty: And Lucy, after that, refused to forgive him. That's why she was heading off to college for a clean slate.",
        "Jennifer: I certainly wouldn't blame her.",
        "Dusty: But Craig couldn't let it go. So he decided the best thing to do was to have her kidnapped.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Dusty: To save her. To play hero. So she'd call him Daddy again, forgive him, and they live happily ever after. But that's not the way it went down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Last winter when I was abroad, I was painfully reminded that what matters most is the people you love. Your family, your friends. So I propose another toast, to you, who have supported me when maybe I haven't deserved it. Let me have it when I have. I owe you more than -- than I can say.",
        "Dusty: I was there when the kidnapping went down. Luckily, I got to Lucy before Craig even had a chance to pull off his heroic rescue attempt.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I would say that's lucky.",
        "Dusty: Yes and no. The kidnappers that Craig hired wanted money, naturally. Craig doesn't have money. Not real money. Not the kind of money to pay off a ransom on Lucinda Walsh's grandchild, you understand? What does Craig do? He decides to blow them off. This infuriates Don and Wade. They try to go after Lucy then on their own.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you said that someone was killed.",
        "Dusty: I found don, on a rooftop, bleeding hole in his chest. And he told me that Craig shot him before he died. And Craig was obviously prepared to blame me, 'cause he used my gun. He also shot Alan Drake. You remember Sierra's husband? There was a second ransom made. Alan made the drop. Craig shows up. Next thing you know, Alan's dead. Wade is dead, and nobody knows whether Lucy is alive or not. Thank God, thank God, I found her in time. She so easily could have died because of Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm a very lucky guy. Despite all my mistakes, I'm still here. For the moment. And more importantly, so, for better or worse, are all of you. So, I propose another toast to you. May you be as happy and as blessed as I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Craig has no limits. He takes whatever he wants. He wants to be father to your child. You still think you and Mike can handle him on your own?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Paul? What happened?",
        "Paul: In a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me this information.",
        "Dusty: I say we start where he lives, in his wallet.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I know that you want to help. But Mike and I need to do this on our own.",
        "Dusty: Did you hear anything I said?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, all of it. And I promise you that I will keep your secret for Lucy's sake, but I will tell Mike, okay? So that he understands why we need to be very, very careful.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jennifer: Paul?",
        "Paul: Are you sitting down? Craig just married Rosanna.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Paul: Which means he's got power, influence, connections, money.",
        "Jennifer: How could she do that? I don't understand.",
        "Paul: The point is, they're a united front. Now that he's married, he can provide a home, an education, an army of lawyers.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, no, I get all that. I've got to go. I'll call you later.",
        "Dusty: What happened?",
        "Jennifer: Craig married Rosanna. There's no stopping him now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I hate this. I mean, really, there's absolutely nothing wrong with my legs.",
        "Meg: Well, you want to waltz down the Hallway with your fanny in the wind, that's your call. But, I'd take the ride if I were you. Have you had outpatient surgery before?",
        "Lucinda: This is just a biopsy, darling. How difficult can it be?",
        "Meg: So you don't have any questions.",
        "Lucinda: Of course I have questions. I've got lots of questions. I'm just not getting many answers, that's all.",
        "Meg: Okay, try me.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Well, look. Come here. I know we have to justify the existence of the lab, the pathologists and everything, but I don't understand why a competent oncologist can't just look at the damn cyst and then just tell me what he thinks.",
        "Meg: Whether or not you have cancer?",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Meg: The doctor will be able to give you her impressions. But if it is cancer, she won't be able to tell you what stage it's at until the pathologist takes a look. At that could take a few days.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, the stages.",

        "Meg: So, are you ready to give me your things?",

        "Lily: My Mother was supposed to send Walter a document, and that's the meeting that Sierra and I walked in on, and she never sent any document. And Mary can't find her, and Dusty can't find her. And she's asked all three of us to cover for her at this fundraiser. She's turned off her cell phone and I can't find Claudia.",
        "Holden: Maybe she doesn't want to be reached. She doesn't have a new boyfriend, does she?",
        "Lily: If she does, he's not doing his job, because she's very stressed out and she's very edgy. I don't know, something is wrong, I just -- I can just just feel it.",

        "Jennifer: How could Rosanna be so stupid? She lost Cabot because of him. And to marry him?! Marry him again?!",

        "Jennifer: Dusty, we have to stop him.",
        "Dusty: We? I thought I was out of bounds.",

        "Rosanna: Craig, this is a friendly arrangement.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. The guest room it is. A guy can dream, can't he? Rosanna? It was lovely.",

        "Paul: All right, Emily, just stop.",
        "Emily: Now he's gonna go after your sister's baby. And Rosanna? The only reason she married him was to stick it to you.",
        "Paul: Stop.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. They just make me so mad.",
        "Paul: Okay. [Emily sighs] Why don't we just call it a night, all right? I mean, I'm not -- I'm not really in a festive mood.",
        "Emily: I know, I'm sorry. And I'm sorry you had to walk in on all that.",
        "Paul: No, at least I know. I think maybe I just need a little time alone.",
