You're making more of it than there is.", "Emily: No, I know that lance was making threats. Now if he got violent with my sister --", "Dusty: I told you everything, and you promised to let it go. So --", "Emily: Will you at least tell me what you said to her? How did you get her home? I didn't think I would ever see my sister again. How did you do it?", "Dusty: What's going on? You've been at me since I got home.", "Emily: I've been -- what's with you? First, you're mr. Evasive and now you're acting like you're annoyed with me.", "Dusty: Yeah, that's right. I'm annoyed, 'cause of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aaron: Wow. Alison, you look -- you look great. As always.", "Alison: Aaron, what are you doing here?", "Aaron: Actually, I was hoping to run into you.", "Alison: Oh?", "Aaron: Yeah, emily told me you'd be around today.", "Alison: That's what she was trying to tell me.", "Aaron: Yeah. Feels kind of weird out here. Do you want to go in and grab a table?", "Alison: I can'T.", "Aaron: Just for a few minutes? So we can talk?", "Alison: I have nothing to say to you.", "Aaron: Alison, come on.", "Alison: I mean it. You shouldn't have come looking for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gwen: Will? Are you here?", "Will: Yeah, hey.", "Gwen: I'm happy! I'm so happy! And it's all because of you.", "Will: Really? What'd I do?", "Gwen: 'Cause you just -- you did everything right. You did everything so, so right.", "Cleo: Are you guys okay?", "Will: Yeah.", "Cleo: Oh, I thought I heard yelling. I guess it was the good kind of yelling. I'm sorry, I'm being a pest.", "Gwen: Cleo, wait. Actually, I want to give you something.", "Cleo: You do?", "Gwen: Yeah. It's kind of a thank you gift.", "Cleo: For me?", "Gwen: Yeah, I finished it earlier today.", "Cleo: Wow! Your cd, gwen? That -- that's awesome!", "Gwen: It's the first copy that we burned. And I want you to have it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Paul: You were supposed to give me word an hour ago.", "P.I.: I had to hire two extra men. I hope you're okay with that.", "Paul: I'm okay with whatever locates meg snyder and craig montgomery. Now tell me where I can find them and then your job is done.", "P.I.: Montgomery's plane landed in a small airport about ten minutes from here. I got positive ids on both parties from the ground crew.", "Paul: So where are they?", "P.I.: We're looking into it.", "Paul: What does that mean?", "P.I.: After they left the airport, their trail went dead.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Craig: You honestly believe that we can both get what we want?", "Meg: Yes.", "Craig: See, I know what I want. I'm having trouble figuring out just what it is you're after.", "Meg: I don't want paul to suffer for something that was all my idea.", "Craig: Oh, I see. So even though he tried to steal my wife, I'm supposed to overlook that. You know that in some countries, that's punishable by death.", "Meg: And what are you going to accomplish by hurting him? Can't this just be between you and me.", "Craig: Remind me again what it is that I get in exchange for my understanding?", "Meg: I'll do whatever you want.", "Craig: Anything I desire -- if I spare paul. That is a very interesting offer, meg. One of my problems is, I'm trying to figure out how to make you atone for your crime when I can't even think of what to call it. Breach of promise sounds a little antiquated, don't you think? And these days, frankly, I don't think there's anything on the books about punishment for marrying under false pretenses.", "Meg: Being dragged here isn't punishment enough?", "Craig: You wound me, meg. I've gone through a great deal of trouble to make this honeymoon perfect.", "Meg: Oh, please. This deal -- this deal was all spelled out before the wedding. You agreed to relinquish worldwide if I married you.", "Craig: I did not think you'd be having an affair with paul ryan behind my back.", "Meg: You didn't specify anything about being faithful. I don't remember that.", "Craig: Well, I trusted you.", "Meg: Well you made assumptions.", "Craig: No, you lulled me into a false sense of security and danced images of my own self-transformation. I let my guard down.", "Meg: Oh. Oh, like the people that you hurt in the past.", "Craig: So what are you? You're my avenging angel?", "Meg: I could be a lot more than that if you'd stop pretending to negotiate and just get down to business.", "Craig: What? You think you're in some kind of position to dictate terms to me?", "Meg: Why not? If I know what you want.", "Craig: And what do you imagine that I want?", "Meg: Oh. You want me.", "Craig: Stop. Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs gecko: Now see, when people", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cleo: Wow. You really want -- you really want to give me the very first copy of the first cd you've ever made?", "Gwen: You've been such a big part of this, cleo. I can't think of anyone else I'd rather give it to.", "Cleo: But, what about will? Here. You take it. I mean, you believed in gwen longer than anybody.", "Will: It's okay cleo. You can keep the songs. I've got the singer.", "Gwen: I want you to have it, cleo.", "Cleo: Are you sure?", "Gwen: I am. I mean, if it weren't for you, i never would have gone back into the studio. I never would have finished the cd.", "Cleo: This is -- this is like the greatest gift!", "Gwen: And you actually don't have to worry about will. He knows how lost I'd be without him.", "Will: That's not true. I'm just the husband. I can't even carry a tune.", "Gwen: Mm-hmm. And how many songs on the cd are about you?", "Cleo: Only all of them! I mean, what else could you possibly have to sing about, right?", "Gwen: That's a good point.", "Will: Yeah.", "Cleo: I'm very intuitive. When it comes to obvious stuff. Pretty sure I'm going to stop talking now.", "Gwen: Cleo, it's okay. I like that you're happy for me.", "Will: You know, now that the cd's finished, it's time to promote it. So are you going get in contact with that guy that maddie put you in touch with?", "Gwen: Noah?", "Will: Yeah. He's got the right connections with the branson concert, right?", "Cleo: Yeah, he knows all the people in charge, and he offered to introduce gwen. You should really jump on that.", "Gwen: I don't want to seem to pushy.", "Cleo: You're not being pushy. You're going to make that concert so much better.", "Will: Cleo's right. And besides, it's to benefit the families of fallen cops.", "Gwen: Okay.", "Cleo: Here. Make it official.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Emily: What have I done?", "Dusty: Nothing. Nothing. It's not you, it's me. I apologize.", "Emily: For what?", "Dusty: Calling you names. Saying harsh things to you when you were working for cheri.", "Emily: You called it like you saw it.", "Dusty: No. I had no right to judge you. I'm in no place. I've done a lot of things I regret.", "Emily: Nothing close to selling yourself.", "Dusty: I never meant to make you feel ashamed.", "Emily: Where's this coming from?", "Dusty: Well, when I went back to vegas, I started seeing things differently. You think your life is set -- but it can get away from you, before you know what's going on. And suddenly you're some place you never thought you'd be.", "Emily: I think that's what it was like for ali.", "Dusty: I'm sorry for the way I treated you. I hope you forgive me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aaron: You can't give me five minutes?", "Alison: It won't just be that and we both know it. Besides, I have things I have to do.", "Aaron: No, you don'T.", "Alison: I've been away. I haven't even checked my e-mails.", "Aaron: Oh come on. After all this time, you think i can't tell when you're lying to me?", "Alison: Right. Call me a liar. That really makes me want to open up over a cup of coffee.", "Aaron: Alison -- please don't -- please don't run away.", "Alison: I'm not going to stay here and listen to you list all my faults.", "Aaron: Just give me a chance.", "Alison: You've had plenty of those. I have no idea why you're back, and honestly, it doesn't matter. But -- just leave me alone.", "Aaron: I'm here because of my mother.", "Alison: Oh, god -- julie -- is she?", "Aaron: She's fine. She's okay. Everything's fine. She's in remission.", "Alison: Oh, aaron, that's so great. After we broke up, I wanted to call her and talk to her but I -- I didn't know what to tell her about us. I didn't want to give her any more bad news.", "Aaron: I wish you'd called me.", "Alison: I couldn'T. Besides, it wouldn't have made a difference anyway. You just proved that two minutes ago by calling me a liar.", "Aaron: I know why you want to avoid me.", "Alison: It's because you think I'm trash, and you're right. That's exactly what I am.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Paul: The trail went cold? What -- didn't anybody follow them?", "P.I.: Montgomery had a car waiting, but he drove the vehicle himself.", "Paul: Well did anybody follow the car?", "P.I.: Until he went off-road. It was an suv, but we got the license plate.", "Paul: So what? You got -- we need a helicopter! We need to find the car! We need to find them!", "P.I.: I have a chopper in the air right now, but it takes time.", "Paul: Not good enough. This woman -- it looks like she's with him willingly, but she's not. This is -- it's an act. It's a hostage situation, and we need to find her before it's too late.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Craig: Put that on.", "Meg: I thought you couldn't wait to have your way with me.", "Craig: Not like this. Is that what kind of a man you think I am?", "Meg: Please. Don't act like this is beneath you. You set the standard.", "Craig: Oh, no. You started this one. You started with the lies and the constant deception.", "Meg: You know, at least I never lied to myself.", "Craig: And at the church, that tryst with paul, that wasn't the first stolen moment, was it?", "Meg: No.", "Craig: And barbara, when she was supposedly lecturing you about what a mistake it would be to marry me, you were really with paul. And that's why he answered the door half-naked.", "Meg: You knew I didn't love you. You even said it yourself, it didn't matter.", "Craig: I didn't know that you would be spending your spare time in bed with that hallucinogenic parasite!", "Meg: Oh no, no, no, no. No. Don't act like the wronged husband here. You're the one who blackmailed me into this marriage.", "Craig: No, you accepted my proposal. You were a willing participant.", "Meg: In a business deal. Love and commitment were never on the table.", "Craig: No, they were for me! I thought I was going to hand you back worldwide in exchange for something far more valuable.", "Meg: What? A new self-image?", "Craig: No, a new life. I thought -- if I could just put you first, if I could put you first, I would be happier than I'd ever been. I wanted to do that. I wanted you first, meg. I wanted to change.", "Meg: Yeah. If that were true, you would've done the right thing without expecting anything in return. But you know what, you haven't changed and you never will.", "Craig: No, but you have. You've learned how to lie. And you do it over and over again.", "Meg: I let you believe what you wanted to believe.", "Craig: You knew that my feelings for you were genuine. Don't you have any compassion for me?", "Meg: Compassion? Compassion, craig? I have as much compassion as you had for lily. Do you remember how much she trusted you? And you pretended to be her friend while you pushed her into financial ruin. Thanks to you and your advice, ethan almost died.", "Craig: No, I am not responsible for that company that she backed. I'm not.", "Meg: You pulled all the financial strings, discouraged background checks, your hands were all over it. And when it all blew up, you just stood back and you watched my family fall apart.", "Craig: And that's when it happened. That's when you turned, isn't it? That's when you went back to paul ryan.", "Meg: What does that --", "Craig: Just tell me!", "Meg: Yes. That's when I gave up on you. You took advantage of lily's grief and you wrested lucinda's company away -- it was loathsome. And I couldn't give you another pass.", "Craig: So the fight with paul about the fake phone calls from rosanna, that was just staged for my benefit?", "Meg: Yeah, every bit of it.", "Craig: And you were hoping that you would get some kind of confession out of me for rosanna's tragic accident. I'm sorry that strategy didn't work for you.", "Meg: Yeah, I wish it had. Then I never would've had to marry you!", "Craig: Well, we are really getting down to it. Unless there's something else you want to admit.", "Meg: No. You know everything.", "Craig: Well -- I guess there's not much more to say. Except to tell you that I don't -- actually really regret trusting you. I don't regret wanting a life with you. And it has actually answered a question I've had for some time.", "Meg: What question is that?", "Craig: For a long time, I felt that maybe I was just too jaded for love. But because of you I -- I feel like there's still some love left in me. I can't say I want to thank you for that, but it's something.", "Meg: I wish it didn't have to be this way.", "Craig: So do I. You know what, why don't you have some tea. You haven't even had any breakfast.", "Meg: Why are you being so nice to me?", "Craig: What am I going to do? Lock you in a cage, feed you dried bread crumbs? I still love you, meg just -- a little less.", "Meg: All right.", "Craig: This is a shame. We could've been very happy together.", "Meg: Well since that's not an option, what's your next move?", "Craig: Oh, I think the time for full disclosure has passed.", "Meg: You said you wanted the truth. I gave you the truth. Are you still going after paul?", "Craig: Why would I want to go after paul? When you said yourself this was all about your payback. He had nothing to do with these schemes.", "Meg: Yes.", "Craig: Well unless that's a lie, and that indeed, paul ryan was behind all of this.", "Meg: No, I wanted that.", "Craig: I don't know. You're getting so good at lying, meg. It's hard to tell when you're playing me.", "Meg: Paul didn't want me to marry you. He begged me not to get involved in any of this.", "Craig: I'll have to ask paul myself. Make sure that your stories mesh.", "Meg: I knew it. I knew you couldn't let this go. I am telling you the truth, craig. None of this was paul's fault.", "Craig: Oh come on. Please. I know you, meg. You're not capable of this kind of deception. You would need help. From paul and lucinda, and they will be held accountable.", "Meg: You can'T.", "Craig: What's the matter?", "Meg: What's happening?", "Craig: Oh, it's all right. Relax. It's very temporary.", "Meg: The tea?", "Craig: Yeah, the tea. Yeah. You know that saying, don't you? Turnabout's fair play?", "Meg: Fair? Don't hurt him, please. Don't hurt paul.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Emily: Well that's a first. Honestly, I never thought I'd hear you apologize for anything.", "Dusty: Well when I'm wrong, I'm wrong.", "Emily: No, you weren'T. Really. The way I was living my life was -- destructive and dangerous. And stupid. And when you said that could never be with someone who sold herself -- how can I blame you for that?", "Dusty: It's over now. And I never meant for you to take it that way.", "Emily: No, I know. But you were being honest. Really honest. But you were being a friend and I will always appreciate that.", "Dusty: I hope you still consider me a friend.", "Emily: You will always be my friend, dusty.", "Derek: Ms. Stewart?", "Emily: Oh, derek, hi. Thanks for meeting with me. Derek and I have a meeting. Have you met my partner at the intruder, mr. Donovan.", "Dusty: Dusty. You're the freelance photographer?", "Derek: That's right. You've used some of my shots in the paper.", "Dusty: Yes.", "Emily: Well, I actually wanted to make a more formal arrangement with derek. Why don't you sit in on the meeting with us?", "Dusty: Why not?", "Emily: Okay, great.", "Dusty: Good to see you back in action -- where you belong.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aaron: I'm not trying to start an argument.", "Alison: Fine. Then maybe you should just go.", "Aaron: Not until I figure out where you get an idea like that. Ali, I never thought you were trash, I never did.", "Alison: Well, I remember things a little differently.", "Aaron: You know what I think? I think you're amazing. I think you're beautiful, I think you're funny. You're a little off-the-wall sometimes, but that's fine. You have a big heart. The happiest times I ever had were when you were in my life.", "Alison: If that's all true, then why did you shut me out when your mom got sick? I just wanted to help you, to help her.", "Aaron: I don't know, okay. I should have told you every day how much you meant to me. But things were just really intense. Really stressful. And there was a lot of that going on with my mom.", "Alison: Yeah, cancer's a drag.", "Aaron: I didn't mean it that way. But you have to admit, ali, that was a lot going on for somebody our age. Maybe we really weren't ready for it.", "Alison: Yeah. The bills and the jobs were definitely a reality check for the both of us.", "Aaron: When I hung out with my friends, it was just like a break from all the heavy stuff.", "Alison: And from me.", "Aaron: Alison, you were asking questions I had no answers for. About our future, about marriage. All I could think about was like the next weekend.", "Alison: Okay. But it wasn't just your old high school friends that you were hanging out with.", "Aaron: It was tara, too. I know.", "Alison: The professional flirt.", "Aaron: You know nothing happened between us. Not even when we were dating in high school, before I even got to oakdale.", "Alison: Not for lack of trying on her part.", "Aaron: She would stop by when I was bartending, but that was it.", "Aaron: And I know, you probably thought something was going on. And now I get -- I get that. I know why you did what you did.", "Alison: I thought for sure you were cheating on me. So I did it to you, to show you how it felt.", "Aaron: I get that now.", "Alison: Yeah, well you didn't get it then. I kept trying to tell you I was sorry, but you wouldn't listen to me. And then you threw me away.", "Aaron: No.", "Alison: You called me a whore.", "Aaron: I know, I wish I could take that back. Okay? I really do. I had some time to cool off and I thought about it -- I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry, but you were gone.", "Alison: I left that night.", "Aaron: I know, I was looking for weeks.", "Alison: Why?", "Aaron: I was hurt. I was hurt and I was mad, but I didn't want you to leave.", "Alison: Even though I was the one who ruined everything?", "Aaron: No. No, that's not true. I ran away from myself, alison. I ran away from you, too. I drove you off. This is my fault. I should have never blamed you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Craig: Sshhhh. You just sleep through this. It's better that way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Cell phone beeping ]", "Paul: Meet me at shadow cliff. Hurry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dusty: I remember that spread you shot. The changing face of oakdale.", "Derek: Emily wrote that.", "Emily: Well, he ran with it.", "Dusty: That brought in huge ad revenue.", "Emily: Well that's why I called derek in. I want to do more features like that, in house.", "Derek: So, \"the intruder's\" looking for a staff photographer?", "Emily: Yep. You interested?", "Dusty: Good photos definitely boost circulation.", "Derek: I'd be grateful for the exposure.", "Emily: Well see, we need someone like you who can tell a story with one image. Someone who can tell the truth. Because really, I mean, that's the hardest thing to do. Am I right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Why are you telling me this now? If you had said half of this stuff --", "Aaron: Maybe you wouldn't have gone?", "Alison: Things are the way they are. We can't change them now.", "Aaron: You know, I thought by working a lot -- you know, that would be the answer. I even took double shifts, not even realizing that -- I'd left you alone.", "Alison: It wouldn't have been that bad, it was just that I didn't know anybody in seattle besides you. And everybody who came into that bar knew you and was slapping you on the back, and talking about some dumb thing you did back in the old day, and I just --you were in your own world.", "Aaron: You didn't feel like you were a part of it.", "Alison: I wasn'T. You needed me less and less every day.", "Aaron: Look, I'm an idiot. I didn't realize I was losing you, okay. I know now why you went to somebody else.", "Alison: I needed to feel wanted, I guess.", "Aaron: Well, I wanted you. Alison, I wish -- I wish I showed it better.", "Alison: Me too. Because cheating on you only made me lonelier.", "Aaron: Me too.", "Alison: I am sorry.", "Aaron: I'm sorry too.", "Alison: Really?", "Aaron: Yeah, really. Why do you think I'm here?", "Alison: I thought maybe you came back to yell at me some more.", "Aaron: No, no. No more yelling. No more yelling. You have no idea how much I wish I hadn't lost it when I found out.", "Alison: I cried for days.", "Aaron: I really messed up I messed up by being angry. And I lost everything that mattered to me when you left. Ali, I know it's been a year since we've talked, but I still go for that phone five times a day.", "Alison: I changed my number.", "Aaron: Yeah, well I'm glad you did. 'Cause you forced me to show up here. The minute I found out my mom was going to be okay, that's when I knew I wanted you right back.", "Alison: Why?", "Aaron: I want a second chance. I want to make everything up to you, starting right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gwen: Noah, this is my husband, will.", "Noah: Nice to meet you.", "Will: Thank you for coming by.", "Noah: No problem. So gwen finished the cd? That's so cool.", "Gwen: Yeah, I hope so. Once you listen to it, I'm open to any kind of feedback -- or criticism.", "Will: She's also open to air time or some kind of promotion.", "Noah: Does that mean you're ready to perform at the concert in branson?", "Cleo: Of course, she'd absolutely love to. Sorry, I probably should let gwen answer that. I'm just like her biggest supporter by far.", "Noah: It's good to have a base. Maddie's been talking you up, too. So you want to move on this?", "Gwen: I mean, I would -- I would love to be part of the benefit if you think it's possible.", "Noah: Sure. I'll go make the calls.", "Gwen: Thank you. I really appreciate this.", "Noah: Can you stop by woak later? Drop off the cd?", "Gwen: Absolutely.", "Noah: Just so you know, the people organizing this thing have other things planned besides the benefit. So it's going to be hectic. I mean, tight schedule, radio interviews, tv, photo shoots, all that stuff. You might want to think about getting an assistant.", "Gwen: I will look into it.", "Noah: Great. See you later.", "Gwen: Is this really happening?", "Will: Yeah, I think it's really happening.", "Gwen: So, are you ready to be my assistant?", "Will: No, I can't be your assistant. I'm your husband, we're married. That doesn't work.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cleo: Wow, gwen. They're treating you like such a big star. I mean, I don't know. Maybe you could find time to let me know how the show goes? You know, maybe a call or you could send a postcard?", "Gwen: You know what, I think I have a better idea than that. How would you like to come along, as my assistant?", "Cleo: You mean it? I mean, you'd want me hanging around with all those famous people there?", "Gwen: Yeah, why not?", "Cleo: Well, I'm just kind of like a really big klutz. And I wouldn't want to ruin something so important.", "Gwen: But do you want to come?", "Cleo: I'd be honored!", "Gwen: Okay, then it's settled. You're my assistant.", "Cleo: Okay, can I scream now?", "Gwen: Yeah, knock yourself out.", "[ Cleo screams ]", "Cleo: I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm going to branson. I've never ever been to branson before, but I want to learn everything there is to know before I go there. And I'm going to learn your entire schedule. Don't to every minute. I swear, you're not going to have to worry about a thing. I give you my word, I'm going to be the very best assistant you've ever had.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Paul: Birch road, north. Got it. Left on forest pine. And then there's a parking lot. Quarter mile. Got it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Craig: We were so close, meg. That night that we made love -- you made me yours forever. How could I possibly let you go? Don't worry about paul. Don'T. He's just -- he's just a bad habit that keeps coming back. But you're going to kick it. I'll help you. This isn't over.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Announcer) it's really not so surprising I have copd with chronic bronchitis which makes", "Will: Cleo was like, a little manic after you asked her to be your assistant. I hope that doesn't cause problems.", "Gwen: Yeah, she's be really disappointed though, if I cancelled. Are you going to be okay with her hovering around?", "Will: Yeah, as long as we get some time alone.", "Gwen: I'll make sure of it.", "Will: Okay, good. I was kind of thinking that we could make this into like a -- I don't know, like a little honeymoon.", "Gwen: Well, I mean, based on how noah was talking, I really don't think I'm going to have a lot of free time.", "Will: Well I figured we could spend a couple extra days. You know, just the two of us.", "Gwen: Really?", "Will: Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll go swimming, hiking, stargazing. How's it sound?", "Gwen: That'd be amazing.", "Will: All right, I'll make it happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Derek: You two work well together. I'll be in touch.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Emily: We work well together? Wow. When did that happen?", "Dusty: Well, when we want the same thing, we're unstoppable.", "Bartender: Anything else?", "Emily: No, I don't think so. You?", "Bartender: I'll leave the check. You can sign for it.", "Dusty: Yes sir. You going back to the office?", "Emily: I've got a ton of work waiting for me on my desk. But nothing that can't wait. You?", "Dusty: I was going to stop by.", "Emily: Really? You know, I don't feel like it today.", "Dusty: Would anyone notice if we took the afternoon off?", "Emily: I don't know, I'd notice. But I wouldn't tell anybody. What do you have in mind?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aaron: What?", "Alison: I was -- remembering all the insane things I used to do to get your attention.", "Aaron: Yeah, you cared then.", "Alison: I was crazed. Arson isn't the best way to tell someone you love them. Neither is teaming up with craig montgomery trying to bust up you and lucy.", "Aaron: Yeah. It took me a while to read the signs.", "Alison: That's so you. You ignore the obvious until it hits you on the head. The first time you told me you loved me was the night before my aborted wedding to chris hughes.", "Aaron: Well, I still love you. I made a lot of mistakes, and I've learned from them. I wouldn't have come all this way, if I wasn't serious. Do you wish -- do you wish I hadn't come?", "Alison: I just didn't expect this, aaron.
