        "Dusty and Meg watch one another, as she is with Damian and he is with Bonnie. The tension is apparent and Damian thinks that the only way Meg can move on from the past is to talk with Dusty one last time to see if they have a future. Meg decides to take him up on this suggestion. She asks to talk with Dusty, as Bonnie heads out nervously considering her feelings for Dusty are growing but she doesn't want to admit it. Dusty and Meg are on the verge of giving it one more try, but Dusty pushes Meg's buttons again and they realize their problems are still there and neither one of them will back down. They both head off angrily deciding giving it another try was a mistake. Meanwhile, Bonnie is talking with Derek, who suddenly has a change of heart, but she doesn't know where her feelings lie so they get into an argument and Derek stomps off. Later, Dusty confronts Damian and tells him that he is onto him and knows he wasn't on Meg and his side and is only trying to push himself into Meg's life more as her new BFF. Damian calls Dusty on all his mistakes with Meg and how he alone drove her away. Damian later makes a phone call where he tells the person to buy up all Worldwide stock he can and make sure no one knows he is the one doing the buying. Damian later goes to see Meg and tells her that if she only wants a friend for the time being (even though he admits he wants more), he is willing to be patient, as they continue to flirt. Dusty seeks out Bonnie and asks her out to dinner, but Bonnie, who is trying to protect herself, turns him down with an added insult, to seal the deal. Carly continues to drink unbeknownst to everyone. When Craig comes over, she covers by suggesting they go upstairs. Their romp turns into a conversation about their future and Craig asks Carly to marry him. Carly doesn't take him seriously at first, but he convinces her to give it some thought. She won't go further with his suggestion unless Rosanna and her kids get on board. Craig wants them to go talk with her now. Meanwhile, Rosanna is trying to convince Paul that she needs to stand on her own feet, as Paul wants her to stay with him and Eliza and have a makeshift family. She doesn't think it is healthy, but Paul wants her to think about it. After he goes to take Eliza back to the farm, Carly and Craig come by with their news and her blessing. Rosanna is unsure and stunned but asks Carly if she loves him. She needs him, she admits, but then later tells them both she does love Craig. Rosanna begrudgingly gives her blessing. Paul walks in as this is going down and takes some shots at this supposed union, as Rosanna suggests he let this be between her and her sister. Later, Paul wants her to stop this, but this convinces Rosanna more then ever that she can't stay with him because she doesn't want to be the old Rosanna anymore and if she stays with him, she might. Paul offers to get her a room at the Lakeview, as she finally accepts his generosity. Carly and Craig go home to celebrate, as Carly secretly takes more drinks from the hidden vodka bottle before she and Craig head upstairs to celebrate more now as an newly engaged couple. Carly sadly looks at reflection in the mirror before she trails behind Craig as they head upstairs."

        "Dusty: These are for you.",
        "Bonnie: Wow. I knew I was a good kisser, but I didn't think we left off on good terms.",
        "Dusty: It's a thank-you for your professional services.",
        "Bonnie: Oh.",
        "Dusty: I have legal access to my boy again -- wouldn't have happened without you.",
        "Bonnie: I'm glad you appreciate it. And I do hope you realize that these flowers aren't gonna cover my bill.",
        "Dusty: You can't blame a guy for trying.",
        "Bonnie: Sit down. You want some pancakes or something?",
        "Dusty: I'd love some.",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no, no. You have to get your own, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: But I'll be broke after I pay your legal fees.",
        "Bonnie: You got that right.",
        "Dusty: Let me have some, anyway.",
        "Bonnie: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Hey, Meg.",
        "Meg: Hi, Damian. Hey.",
        "Damian: Sorry I'm late. Listen, I suggested coming here so you wouldn't run into Dusty at the hotel. Shall we -- shall we go somewhere else?",
        "Meg: No, of course not. I already told you I'm not gonna go out of my way to avoid him. He's not an issue for me. Come on.",
        "Damian: Hey, you sure about this?",
        "Meg: Positive.",
        "Damian: All right, then.",
        "Dusty: I'm having the large stack of pancakes with bacon on the side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay. Back to the drawing board.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, damn.",
        "Craig: Good morning, Sunshine.",
        "Carly: What's so good about it?",
        "Craig: What's good? It's a beautiful day.",
        "Carly: How was Johnny's night with Dusty?",
        "Craig: You know, I think it went well, and Dusty got Johnny back to me in plenty of time to get him to school, so everybody's happy.",
        "Carly: Well, I told you it was a good idea, didn't I?",
        "Craig: I give you all the credit. I needed to do what was best for Johnny, and you made me see that.",
        "Carly: You should listen to me more often.",
        "Craig: So right.",
        "Carly: Mmm. Would you like some coffee?",
        "Craig: No, thank you. I'd like to get right down to business.",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: Well, yesterday, you kicked me out because you wanted to work on your designs. I can't wait to see what you've come up with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: It's a little awkward in here.",
        "Dusty: Awkward?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, Meg and Damian --",
        "Dusty: It's not awkward -- for me, anyway. If you're uncomfortable --",
        "Bonnie: I'm not uncomfortable -- you're uncomfortable.",
        "Dusty: I am not. Could you pass the, uh, syrup, please?",
        "Bonnie: Mm.",
        "Damian: Meg, I know you said that it's over between you and Dusty --",
        "Meg: It is over.",
        "Damian: Well, then, why does it bother you to see him here with another woman?",
        "Meg: I am not bothered. It's just -- I didn't expect him to move on to someone else so quickly.",
        "Damian: It may appear to Dusty that you have moved on, as well.",
        "Meg: We're friends, Damian.",
        "Damian: Do you think Dusty knows that? He might be as uncomfortable as you are right now.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: You know, it doesn't matter.",
        "Damian: Don't do that.",
        "Meg: Do what?",
        "Damian: You don't need to lie, especially to yourself. It's obvious that you still have feelings for Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Aww, she is so cute -- Eliza -- like, she -- she fell asleep before her head hit the pillow. Rosanna. Hey, what is it?",
        "[Rosanna crying]",
        "Rosanna: Nothing. I'm sorry. It's ridiculous.",
        "Paul: Um, okay. But what is it?",
        "Rosanna: Ohh. I'm so sorry. It's just seeing you with your daughter -- it just, sometimes, reminds me of everything that I once dreamed of having and -- oh, it just wasn't meant to be. Listen, you should give this to Eliza. She sometimes can't sleep --",
        "Paul: She's fast asleep. She doesn't need anything. She -- she's fine. Is it hard for you to be here when she's here with me?",
        "Rosanna: No, no. I love it. I love it. It's wonderful. I mean, you're a terrific father.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: You're welcome. I love seeing the two of you together. It's just amazing. It brings out the best in you. It just -- you know, sometimes, it just reminds me of everything I lost.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you can have a family again, if that's what you want. You just -- you have to find the right person. That's all.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. How funny is it that I thought Craig was the right person?",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Paul: Mm, not so funny.",
        "Rosanna: I mean, look me at me now -- I'm, like, homeless, childless. I mean, I don't mean to sound pathetic, but sometimes, it just -- it just feels like I have nothing.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe we can change that.",
        "[Rosanna sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't feel much like working today, anyway. In fact, I have a much better idea.",
        "Craig: Do tell.",
        "Carly: Well, Sage is at school, and Parker has a tennis lesson, and then he has the afternoon shift at Al's. So we have this whole house to ourselves. However shall we pass the time?",
        "Craig: Hmm. Well, let's see. We could play cards.",
        "Carly: Unh-unh.",
        "Craig: Strip poker?",
        "Carly: Better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Thanks for helping me get my son back in my life.",
        "Damian: You know, as long as you keep looking over your shoulder at Dusty, you're stuck in the past. You can't begin anything new.",
        "Meg: A new relationship is the last thing I need right now.",
        "Damian: I understand. And I'm willing to remain your friend and nothing more, if that's all you need.",
        "Meg: I could use a good friend.",
        "Damian: All right, then. As a friend, I have to tell you, you can't go on like this, feeling so unresolved.",
        "Meg: How'd you get so smart?",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Guys are usually lousy at this stuff.",
        "Damian: My heart has been broken so many times, I know how it feels. At the very least, you should talk to Dusty and figure out, once and for all, if the two of you should try again.",
        "Meg: I don't think it's gonna be that simple.",
        "Damian: Well, love never is. But once you lose it, you can spend the rest of your life in regret. I don't want to see that happen to you.",
        "Meg: He'll think I'm crazy. [Meg chuckles] And I can't believe I'm even considering this.",
        "Damian: I'm going back to the hotel.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Damian: I'll be in my room if you need me.",
        "Meg: Excuse me. Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak to Dusty, please.",
        "Bonnie: Oh.",
        "Dusty: I'm a little busy right now.",
        "Bonnie: No, that's fine. I actually have a lot of work to do at metro. I should go. Thank you again for the flowers.",
        "Dusty: Have a seat. What's up?",
        "Meg: Well, I was thinking about how we ended things.",
        "Dusty: And?",
        "Meg: I wonder if maybe we were too hasty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So you got me to do the right thing. Here you go.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you.",
        "Paul: And as a reward, you have no place to stay, you have no money, and you're all alone.",
        "Rosanna: Uh, are you trying to make me feel better or worse?",
        "Paul: I'm trying to let you know that I meant what I said before, that I like having you here and Eliza likes having you here. And when the three of us are together -- I don't know -- it's kind of like, you know, we're one step short of a family.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what are you suggesting -- we play house?",
        "Paul: No, nothing that complic-- yes. That's exactly -- yeah, I don't know. I -- I think it might work.",
        "Rosanna: Only in your imagination. It -- it wouldn't be real, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, if it's something that we both enjoy, then that makes it real for us, right?",
        "Rosanna: Look, it's really so sweet of you. I just don't think it would be healthy for anybody in the long run.",
        "Paul: Look, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, okay? But I'm starting to build a new life here for me and my little girl. And if you want to be a part of it, you're welcome -- that's all I'm saying. Come on. Don't you think it's worth a try?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I ordered two cases of rum, but you sent me gin. Well, put a rush on it. I need it before the weekend.",
        "Derek: Keeping busy, I see.",
        "Bonnie: Derek. What are you doing here?",
        "Derek: I was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd see how you were doing.",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Bonnie: Really? I didn't think you wanted anything to do with a woman like me.",
        "Derek: Maybe I overreacted.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe?",
        "Derek: I'm sorry. I was out of line.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, you were.",
        "Derek: Look, I'm trying to apologize. I realized that you were right.",
        "Bonnie: Could you say that again?",
        "Derek: You were right. I thought we had an understanding, you know, about us, but I never said out loud where I thought the relationship was going.",
        "Bonnie: Obviously, you didn't think it was going anywhere since you basically called me a slut.",
        "Derek: That was a knee-jerk reaction. I was jealous. But now I know the truth. You said there was nothing going on between you and Dusty. Okay, I can accept that.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe there wasn't, but, uh, now, it's --",
        "Derek: Are you saying things have changed?",
        "Bonnie: No one was more surprised than I was, Derek, but you should probably know that Dusty and I have kissed, twice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You didn't deserve to be pushed away. I mean, this whole time, you had my best interests at heart.",
        "Dusty: It's hard watching you let Paul back into your life.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: I tried to explain that. I did it for Eliza's sake.",
        "Dusty: That doesn't make it right.",
        "Meg: He is still her father.",
        "Dusty: He doesn't understand boundaries. You understand? He never will. He's that sort of guy.",
        "Meg: It's going well so far. He's following the rules for the supervised visitations, and he seems to be grateful.",
        "Dusty: It won't last. He's gonna strike soon.",
        "Meg: Oh, come on, Dusty. Do you honestly think that he would try to take Eliza again?",
        "Dusty: Sure, he would. He'll always be a danger to your daughter and to you.",
        "Meg: I hope you're wrong, Dusty, but I do understand why you feel the way you do. And I -- I'm sorry I overreacted.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, too -- sorry I was tough on you.",
        "Meg: Look, all I'm trying to say is that, if I had to do it over again, things would be different.",
        "Dusty: What are you trying to say?",
        "Meg: Just that I miss you.",
        "Dusty: I miss you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I hate being here with you.",
        "Carly: What? I thought you were having a good time here.",
        "Craig: Well, I -- I was. I did. I am. But --",
        "Carly: But you hate -- you hate being here?",
        "Craig: I hate being in Jack Snyder's bed.",
        "Carly: Oh, this hasn't been Jack Snyder's bed in a long time.",
        "Craig: Yeah? Well, I wonder why I feel he's about to jump out of the closet.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Carly: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Craig: He's barged in here once before.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And since then, he's had instructions to stay out of my bedroom.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know, but he still acts like he's got the run of the house. I mean, the other night when I tried to use the grill, I thought he was gonna cut my arm off.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, Jack can be territorial, and he can't stop feeling protective of me.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. That's what I don't like. I can't do this anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, do you think we could try again?",
        "Dusty: As long as Paul stays out of your life. You got to draw the line.",
        "Meg: I have. I made him sign a very tough visitation agreement.",
        "Dusty: Gave him everything he wants.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: No, that's not true.",
        "Dusty: The problem is, you can't move forward unless you break with the past.",
        "Meg: Okay, that is the second time today a guy has given me the same advice.",
        "Dusty: Who's that -- Damian?",
        "Meg: Yeah, he told me I would never be happy unless I cleared things up with you.",
        "Dusty: He's right.",
        "Meg: Well, obviously, you had no problem moving on. It took you -- what? -- 10 minutes after we broke up to go out with Bonnie?",
        "Dusty: This isn't about Bonnie.",
        "Meg: You're right -- it's about us.",
        "Dusty: That's right. We still have issues. I'm too controlling. You don't want me protecting you all the time.",
        "Meg: Yes, I do have a problem with that.",
        "Dusty: But you need protecting with all the trouble you get yourself into.",
        "Meg: You know, Dusty, I may get myself into trouble, but I do my best to get out of it in my own way. And I was hoping that you could respect that, because, if you can't, it doesn't matter how much we miss each other -- we will never be able to make this work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: Clear something up for me. When you said there was nothing between you and Dusty, what did you mean?",
        "Bonnie: Well, I said that when you were acting like a big jerk, and you walked out on me, Derek.",
        "Derek: Okay, okay. But I'm back now. So, is there something going on with this guy or isn't there?",
        "Bonnie: No, I told you everything there is to know -- just two kisses.",
        "Derek: Well, what the hell does that mean, Bonnie? What does that mean for us?",
        "Bonnie: Honestly? I -- I have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, she's your child -- okay? And -- and Meg's, not mine. And I do not want to get in the middle.",
        "Paul: I'm not asking you to be in the middle. I'm saying that you could have a life here if that's something that you want.",
        "Rosanna: No, I can't have everything handed to me like that, Paul. It's just -- I'm not that kind of person. And besides, you know, your situation here is under a lot of scrutiny. You've got these short, little supervised visits. I don't think there's anything in the fine print of your agreement with Meg about me. In fact, I could turn out to be a deal-breaker.",
        "Paul: Meg says that, if I stick to the rules, then we could wind up with -- with something like shared custody.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, if you stick to the rules, which does not include you sneaking me in as Eliza's surrogate singing mom. Besides, the situation with me and Meg -- I mean, there's just way too much bad blood between us.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. If Meg can forgive me for the 17th time after everything that I've done to her, I'm sure she's the kind of person that could cut you some slack.",
        "Rosanna: No, she's cutting you slack because -- it's for Eliza's sake, because you are her father, okay? She has no reason to want me in the picture.",
        "Paul: What if I do? I'm not trying to push you, and I'm not asking for anything other than friendship.",
        "Rosanna: Are you sure?",
        "Paul: Oh, please. My heart's been through the shredder. That's the single last thing I need right now.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, I just -- uh, I don't understand why you would want to keep me around.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, I've been a lousy partner, but I think I'm a pretty good dad. I'm not perfect, but I'm working on it. And I'd really like it if -- if you would help me.",
        "Rosanna: I'm really sorry, Paul. I just don't think it would work. Listen, um, you've got to get Eliza back to the farm. You don't want to be late.",
        "Paul: I know that it wouldn't be simple for us to get where it is that I'm saying we could get to, but it's not impossible, either, so will you just think about it? Please?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, I hope you're not saying that you want me to move out of my house, because I'm not doing that. My kids live here, and I'm not taking them away their home.",
        "Craig: I'm not asking you to do that.",
        "Carly: Well, then, what? Are you saying that you want to move in here? Because you can't rush into that just because it's convenient or so you can get a key so you can lock Jack out.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Craig: Do you think I would do that?",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't keep him away from his kids.",
        "Carly: Oh, big of you.",
        "Craig: You know, I'm not a bad guy.",
        "Carly: Bad enough.",
        "Craig: Yeah, just bad enough for you to like me.",
        "Carly: Don't try to change the subject, now. Come on. You know that our children need stability.",
        "Craig: I agree. We both want that for our families.",
        "Carly: And how do you intend to make that happen?",
        "Craig: Simple. We'll just make it official.",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: Marry me.",
        "Carly: No. I mean, we tried this once before, remember? It was a disaster.",
        "Craig: That was then. This is now. Now we're a couple. Why not take it to the next step?",
        "Carly: Because it's not a step -- it's a leap from a cliff.",
        "Craig: Okay, I'm the first one to admit that our respective marriages have been kind of like a series of train wrecks.",
        "Carly: Yeah, especially yours.",
        "Craig: Hey, that's true, but I wouldn't brag, if I were you, either.",
        "Carly: I'm not bragging -- I'm not. No, marriage has blown up in my face, and I cannot put my children through that again.",
        "Craig: Our kids have to come first, no matter what.",
        "Carly: That's a given.",
        "Craig: So we're doing it for them. We're showing them a good example. We're doing the right thing. It's like you giving up drinking.",
        "Carly: Wait a minute. What does -- what does me drinking have to do with anything? That's over.",
        "Craig: No, I'm -- I'm just saying we're both turning a corner. That's all.",
        "Carly: Oh, uh-huh. Well, it's crazy. The idea's crazy. It would never work. Too much has happened.",
        "Craig: I don't know. It could help us both start a new chapter.",
        "Carly: How? Parker hates you, and Sage doesn't think too highly of you, either.",
        "Craig: Parker and I used to be friends. I can bring him around. And Sage is daddy's little girl, and I completely understand that. But once she sees that I could be a good father, too, she might learn to like me. And Sage and Parker both love Johnny. Johnny sure could use a mother.",
        "Carly: Oh, don't do that. Don't use that little boy to get me to say \"Yes.\"",
        "Craig: That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that Johnny cares about you. He looks up to you.",
        "Carly: And I want what's best for him -- I do, but my kids have to come first. They -- they flipped out when we almost got married before.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but they came around. Kids adjust. That's what they do.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Craig: We don't have to rush into anything. We can give everyone plenty of time to get used to the idea. We can have some more family dinners.",
        "Carly: Jack will freak out.",
        "Craig: Jack's happy with Janet. Why shouldn't you be happy? What's good for the goose --?",
        "Carly: I don't think he'll see it that way.",
        "Craig: You can't still let Jack run your life.",
        "Carly: I don't.",
        "Craig: Well, then?",
        "Carly: It's not as easy as you're trying to make it sound. You know, I would still have to talk to Rosanna. I would need to have her approval here.",
        "Craig: Okay. Get up. Get dressed. We'll go see Rosanna right now and talk her into it.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: It's impossible -- you know that.",
        "Craig: What I know is that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.",
        "Carly: Why do I think I'm gonna regret this? Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I can't say it's great that Paul is a part of your life. He's a constant threat to you and your daughter. Why'd you come over here?",
        "Meg: You know, obviously, it was a mistake, and I wouldn't have even done it if it wasn't for Damian encouraging me.",
        "Dusty: You'll take Damian's advice and not mine?",
        "Meg: Why do you resent him? He told me to give you another chance. He's on our side.",
        "Dusty: You really think that?",
        "Meg: Yes, I do.",
        "Dusty: He didn't send you over here 'cause he hopes you and I would get back together. He's hoping you'll go running back to him.",
        "Meg: Well, guess what -- the way you're acting, running back to Damian doesn't sound half bad.",
        "Dusty: Be my guest. I'd rather hang out with Bonnie, anyway.",
        "Meg: Good. Go right ahead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: I'm ready to take things to the next level.",
        "Bonnie: And what does that mean exactly, Derek?",
        "Derek: I think maybe it's time for us to move in together.",
        "Bonnie: That's funny. Not a word about moving in a few days ago, and now I kissed Dusty, and you're ready to go apartment hunting.",
        "Derek: Well, maybe it's taken me some time to realize how important you are to me.",
        "Bonnie: You know what? Maybe now you want to move in with me now because you don't -- you -- you just hate the idea of me being with somebody else.",
        "Derek: If you have something going on with Dusty Donovan, I wish you'd be up front and say so.",
        "Bonnie: You know, I would. I would. If I knew what was going on with him, I would, but I don't.",
        "Derek: Well, when you find out, you can let me know, or, better yet, don't even bother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Damian, you got a minute?",
        "Damian: Of course. Did you and Meg have a chance to, uh, work things out?",
        "Dusty: You pretend to be Meg's new best friend and you only want her to be happy.",
        "Damian: That happens to be true.",
        "Dusty: Not everyone has forgotten about your history, you know? You're the king of jerking people around. Look what you did to lily.",
        "Damian: This has nothing to do with lily. Meg is someone I care about, and I was trying to help her.",
        "Dusty: All you care about is you. You don't care about what's good for Meg.",
        "Damian: Oh, I see. I see. No one in the world is good enough for Meg except you. Well, if you're so perfect, why aren't you with her?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause you got her all confused.",
        "Damian: Oh, I did, didn't I? Yes, it's so much easier to blame someone else. First, it was Paul. He may be the father of Meg's child, but he's a bad influence. Now Meg shouldn't hang around with Damian because he's a bad influence, too.",
        "Dusty: That's true.",
        "Damian: Yeah? You know, you said you wanted to protect Meg, but you end up suffocating her. No wonder she left you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna, hi. The housekeeper let us in. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Rosanna: Uh, no. Just what are you guys doing here, both together?",
        "Carly: We need to talk to you.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not gonna like this, am I?",
        "Craig: Try to keep an open mind.",
        "Carly: I wanted to talk to you first to -- to get your opinion.",
        "Rosanna: Go on.",
        "Carly: Do you remember years ago when you wanted to marry Craig, and you -- you asked me for my approval?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. And we all know how well that turned out.",
        "Carly: Well, but things have changed since then. And well, Craig and I are sort of -- we're thinking about getting married.",
        "Craig: We'd like to build a life together for our children and for ourselves.",
        "Rosanna: What do you want -- you want my approval?",
        "Carly: Yes, because I said no deal if you don't approve.",
        "Craig: So it is kind of up to you now.",
        "Rosanna: I -- I don't know. I mean, this is kind of a -- a shock.",
        "Carly: I'm sure. I just want you to try to understand.",
        "Rosanna: Carly, the only reason that I am staying here with Paul is --",
        "Craig: No, I know. I know. You didn't want to stay with me because you didn't want to run into Craig. I know that.",
        "Craig: Kind of extreme, if you ask me.",
        "Carly: I want you to be honest with me because I would never want anything like this to come between us.",
        "Rosanna: Um, okay, listen. Let me just -- let me just ask you one question. Do you love him?",
        "Carly: I -- I need him.",
        "Rosanna: That's not the same thing.",
        "Carly: Craig, I -- I know that I have never said this to you before, but I -- I do love you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, if that's the way you feel, then I'm not gonna stand in your way.",
        "Carly: So you approve?",
        "Rosanna: As long as you love him. I just hope you'll be happy.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Craig: Yes, thank you. That's very classy of you, Rosanna.",
        "Paul: What is going on here?",
        "Craig: Well, you're just in time to congratulate us.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Craig: Carly and I are getting married.",
        "Paul: Carly, are you crazy?",
        "Carly: Probably, but I think it's -- it's too late now.",
        "Paul: You marry Craig Montgomery, you're gonna wind up in a hospital bed, just like your sister, only you -- you may never wake up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're gonna regret coming back to Oakdale.",
        "Damian: Bernardo? Damian. I want you to buy as much stock as you can in worldwide enterprises. Mm-hmm. Use the offshore holding company. I don't want anyone to know that I'm the buyer. Grazie. We'll see who ends up having regrets.",
        "Dusty: I was hoping you'd still be here.",
        "Bonnie: Dusty. I kind of figured you were gonna be spending the rest of the day with Meg.",
        "Dusty: No, nothing's changed. Problems are still there.",
        "Bonnie: Mm. Well, the same thing happened with me and Derek. We had a talk, and it went nowhere.",
        "Dusty: Sorry to hear that.",
        "Bonnie: No, don't be. It's -- I'm so over it.",
        "[Bonnie chuckles]",
        "Dusty: Well, if that's the case, take the rest of the day off, and let's go get some food and have some laughs.",
        "Bonnie: Dusty, I'm really -- I'm not -- I'm not in the mood.",
        "Dusty: Your mood's gonna change.",
        "Bonnie: How?",
        "Dusty: Well, if we make it through dinner without killing each other, I'll take you out dancing.",
        "Bonnie: All that just to forget about Meg?",
        "Dusty: So you can forget about Derek.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I came to apologize.",
        "Meg: For what?",
        "Damian: Encouraging you to talk to Dusty. Big mistake.",
        "Meg: How did you know?",
        "Damian: I ran into him at the Lakeview. He's angry that things didn't work out with you and decided it was my fault.",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. He does that. There's always a bad guy -- if not you, then Paul.",
        "Damian: Well, I'm sorry my advice backfired.",
        "Meg: It's not your fault that Dusty is his own worst enemy.",
        "Damian: To be honest with you, actually, I'm not sorry that it happened. I think you can do a lot better than Dusty Donovan.",
        "Meg: You know, just because I'm not going back to him doesn't mean I'm ready to start something else.",
        "Damian: I know that. That's not what I want.",
        "Meg: What do you want, Damian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you're okay with this?",
        "Rosanna: You know what, Paul? This is just between me and my sister, so --",
        "Paul: Okay. I mean, I don't care what Craig does, as long as he doesn't put another bomb in my car. You know what? As a wedding gift, maybe I'll get you an explosive-sniffing dog, Carly, and you should get someone to taste your food.",
        "Rosanna: You know, Paul, please, that's enough.",
        "Carly: Oh, we should go, I think.",
        "Craig: I think that's a great idea.",
        "Carly: So, I'll see you later.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Are you -- are you sure you're okay staying here with him?",
        "Rosanna: Of course. I'll be fine.",
        "Carly: All right, well, call me if you -- if you change your mind.",
        "Rosanna: I will. I will. Don't worry. I'll talk to you soon.",
        "Carly: Take care of yourself.",
        "Rosanna: You, too. That was incredibly inappropriate.",
        "Paul: I can't believe for a second that you would let your sister marry the man who tried to kill you. You're telling me that you're not gonna do anything to stop this?",
        "Rosanna: No, I am not going to try to stop Carly from marrying Craig.",
        "Paul: You're not afraid that your sister's gonna get hurt?",
        "Rosanna: My sister is a grown-up, and she can make her own decisions.",
        "Paul: Wow. The old Rosanna would never put up with this.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not the old Rosanna, Paul.",
        "Paul: So you're just gonna give up?",
        "Rosanna: I'm not giving up. I am moving on. I'm moving on, which is why I cannot stay here with you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, I think that went amazingly well. Paul was predictable, but I think Rosanna took the news in stride.",
        "Carly: I just hope she meant what she said.",
        "Craig: Take her at her word. We're officially engaged.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no, no, no. Slow down. We still have to talk to the kids.",
        "Craig: They'll come around. But in the meantime, I think we should celebrate.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, I have some sparkling cider in the fridge.",
        "Craig: I'll get it.",
        "Carly: No, you just sit and relax. I'll get it.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "[Carly goes in the kitchen and takes her hidden vodka bottle out of the cabinet and takes a big drink]",

        "Damian: Meg, you already know I want to be your friend.",
        "Meg: Uh-huh, but that's not all.",
        "Damian: I'd like to be much more than that, but right now, a friend is all you need.",
        "Meg: Well, thanks for getting that, because I've got nothing more to give right now.",
        "Damian: That is not true. You have warmth, a wonderful sense of humor, and a generous heart.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Are you going all \"Euro-mantic\" on me again?",
        "Damian: All you need to know is that I will not ask you to be anything else but yourself.",
        "Meg: You've been unbelievably kind and sweet to me.",
        "Damian: I can be all those things. You know what else I can be? Patient.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: All I need is a \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Are you coming with me or not?",
        "Bonnie: No. [Bonnie sighs] I'm busy.",
        "Dusty: Doing what? You're not going out with Derek.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, my gosh. You men are all the same. You think if we women don't have a date with a guy, we have nothing to do.",
        "Dusty: It's true, isn't it?",
        "Bonnie: You want the truth? I'd rather stay home and clean my oven than go out with you.",
        "[Dusty chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Really, I can't stay here anymore.",
        "Paul: Why not? You have everything you need here. You're comfortable.",
        "Rosanna: It's too comfortable. I -- I don't want to sink back into my old way of life.",
        "Paul: Would it really be so terrible?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. I don't want to be the person that I used to be. That's exactly what I wanted to avoid when I left the clinic. That's why I didn't come back to Oakdale.",
        "Paul: You want to go back to that farm co-op? Come on. Is that really the life that you want?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I -- I can't live that life anymore.",
        "Paul: Right, thanks to me.",
        "Rosanna: It's okay. You know what? It's not a big deal. You know, it's great. I can be here with my sister and her family. And -- and that's really positive. But I -- but I can't be here with you, Paul. It just -- it just wouldn't be good for me.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, if you want to leave, I can't stop you. But since it's my fault you have nowhere to go, can I at least get you a room at the Lakeview?",
        "Rosanna: The Lakeview's really expensive, Paul.",
        "Paul: Just until you get back on your feet. Please?",
        "Rosanna: Sure. Sure. Thank you. I really appreciate your generosity, but I'm -- I'm not gonna stay there very long, okay?",
        "Paul: Whatever you want.",
        "Rosanna: I'm, uh, I'm gonna go pack. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: To us.",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Craig: Mm. Does it seem like less of a celebration when it's nonalcoholic?",
        "Carly: No, it's great. It's just a different kind of bubbly.",
        "Craig: Tell me something, and be honest. When you said that to Rosanna, did you say that just to seal the deal?",
        "Carly: When I said that I love you?",
        "Craig: Yeah, that. You know, I want you to know I really don't have any expectations. And I appreciate that you trust me enough to start over with me. And I really do believe that we can be happy.",
        "Carly: Me too.",
        "Craig: Good. Then we make our own rules and go at our own pace, and, eventually, everything will work out.",
        "Carly: I think so, too.",
        "Craig: And, by the way, I love you, too. You know, we have a few hours before the kids come home. Should we go upstairs and just see if it feels any different once you're engaged?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
