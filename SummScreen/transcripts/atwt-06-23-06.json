        "Jade: Yeah, but what about Will? I mean, this is a chance for you guys to get some alone time together.",
        "Gwen: I left him a message.",
        "Jade: No, I really think you should talk to Will before I just move in on you guys.",
        "Gwen: Look, he's not going to get back to me until late because he's held up at the hospital with some family stuff. And besides, he's the one who got Casey to talk to his grandmother about hiring you, so why would he have a problem with you staying here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Will.",
        "Will: What you are doing here?",
        "Paul: I'm here to see Bob.",
        "Will: Well, he's not there.",
        "Paul: What's wrong with you?",
        "Will: I know why you are here, you want to pressure Jennifer into taking your side against Emily.",
        "Paul: I'm not going to pressure anybody.",
        "Will: She's been through enough. Leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't want to change you. You're a forgiving person, if you want to forgive Emily, that's your business. But I won't allow you to change what's right for our family.",
        "Jennifer: So we agree to disagree.",
        "Dusty: As long it's right for our family.",
        "Jennifer: And nothing changes. And when Emily goes to trial, you know, you are the only one who can have impact on the judge because you're the victim.",
        "Dusty: She almost killed me, Red.",
        "Jennifer: I haven't forgotten that. She put us both through hell, but she saved our son.",
        "Dusty: And I'm grateful. But she's got to pay. And she shouldn't be roaming the streets until she does.",
        "Paul: Jen?",
        "Dusty: Why are you still here?",
        "Paul: I came to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Honey? I've got a surprise.",
        "Emily: Please, I don't know if I could take any more surprises.",
        "Susan: This one you'll love.",
        "Emily: Hi, Daniel! Oh, it's so good to see you.",
        "Susan: Margo and Tom are going to take him away for a few days.",
        "Emily: Oh my gosh, I missed you --",
        "Daniel: Yeah, and Dad said I could come see you! I miss you so much.",
        "Emily: I missed you more.",
        "Daniel: When are you coming home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I can't -- come on, you can make more than one trip.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know, but you guys have to get going. Chicago's waiting.",
        "Tom: Well, that's going to have to wait until I find my Cubs hat.",
        "Casey: You know what? Take mine. It's on my bed.",
        "Tom: You want me to take your officially autographed hat?",
        "Casey: Yeah, why not?",
        "Tom: Well, you almost skinned your brother last time he just tried it on.",
        "Casey: Well, I trust you.",
        "Tom: Uh huh.",
        "Margo: Now, don't fall for it. It's in the car.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you know, she's right. It's in the trunk. I saw it there. I'll stow these bags and you're ready to go.",
        "Margo: Well, I wonder where my toothbrush is? I wonder if I packed that.",
        "Casey: Mom, you're staying at a four-star hotel. They'll give you a toothbrush.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on. Come with us. We've got seats right behind the dugout.",
        "Casey: This is Daniel's trip. Besides, I have to work.",
        "Maddie: Well, hello -- Mr. Hughes.",
        "Margo: So. Casey. What kind of work you got scheduled for this weekend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Simon.",
        "Katie: Simon.",
        "Vienna: Simon?",
        "Simon: Well, what a surprise.",
        "Mike: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Simon: Oh, we're just having dinner here, same as you.",
        "Katie: Stop it! Stop it! Mike! He is not worth it!",
        "Vienna: Not worth it? Are you kidding? I'd pay big money to watch these two boys mix it up.",
        "Bartender: Is there a problem here, gentlemen?",
        "Katie: No, no. It's just a misunderstanding.",
        "Simon: No, no, no, nothing you had to worry about.",
        "Bartender: Boxing ring in the gym if you --",
        "Katie: No, that won't be needed. Thank you.",
        "Mike: You followed us here. You stalked us on our honeymoon? What is your problem?",
        "Simon: I never followed anyone, Mike. I'm just as surprised as you are.",
        "Mike: Yeah, like I believe that.",
        "Simon: Trust me if I knew Katie was going to rush into a marriage, you would have seen me a whole lot sooner --",
        "Katie: I wasn't rushing into marriage.",
        "Simon: Well, I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Katie: We've been married for quite awhile actually.",
        "Simon: Really? You are only just taking your honeymoon now? You're a little slow aren't you, Mike?",
        "Katie: We were living together.",
        "Simon: Well, couldn't commit. You know, I can understand that.",
        "Katie: Not, it's -- it's not like that, but you wouldn't understand, so don't even try. Let's go.",
        "Vienna: What about dinner?",
        "Simon: Yes, dinner. Dinner, Vee and I, we were just looking so forward to it. Just stay.",
        "Katie: You're actually with her?",
        "Vienna: Excuse me? I'm no her. I'm Vienna Hyatt. And who the hell are you to torment my Simon?",
        "Katie: Your Simon? That, that's good. She obviously doesn't know you very well.",
        "Mike: If I would have known this is the Australian boyfriend you were telling me about, I would have told you to ditch him right then and there. This guy is a conniving, worthless --",
        "Katie: Liar. Who has never kept a promise in his entire life.",
        "Simon: I never lied to you without good reason, Katie. I told you that and I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: No, you're not. You promised to stay away.",
        "Simon: This wasn't my idea. This little get-together was Vee's.",
        "Katie: And I'm sure that Vee let you into our cabin?",
        "Mike: Wait, wait a minute. You knew he was here and you didn't say anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Uh, work? Casey has that music marathon. Gwen asked me to drop this off. She says that she is really sorry about giving you all the hours.",
        "Casey: No, you know what? That's alright. Thanks.",
        "Maddie: Going somewhere?",
        "Casey: No, my parents are going to Chicago.",
        "Maddie: Chicago. Well, that will be fun.",
        "Tom: Yeah, we hope so.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well, I don't want to take up anymore of your time, so I'll see you later tonight, at Crash. Have fun.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Casey: So, Mom. You wondered when I'm working, pretty much around the clock. So, I'll just put these bags in the car.",
        "Tom: That stuff will wait.",
        "Casey: Well, what about Daniel?",
        "Tom: Oh, his mom will be very happy to have the extra minutes with him.",
        "Margo: We need to sort this out.",
        "Casey: Sort what out?",
        "Tom: Well, you see, your mom and I aren't so sure we should be leaving you alone this weekend at home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: More than anything, I want to come home to you. I wake up every morning, Honey, and I think to myself, \"I wonder what Daniel's having for breakfast.\" I betcha he's having bacon and eggs.",
        "Daniel: Dad doesn't know how to make that.",
        "Emily: I'll explain it to him.",
        "Daniel: It's just not the same without you.",
        "Emily: I know it's not the same. And I am sorry I've let you down. Look at me, we need to find a way to stay close to each other, okay. Me and you because I love you with all my heart. So, you're going on vacation, I hear, huh? Where are you going?",
        "Susan: Didn't Daddy say something about Chicago?",
        "Emily: You're going to Chicago? Are you kidding me? You get to go and see the Cubs play!",
        "Susan: What did Daddy say before we came over here about Mommy?",
        "Daniel: Well, he said that you did something really good. Is it true?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, it is, Daniel. Your mother did a very good thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know my sister. She can very stubborn.",
        "Dusty: I know her, too.",
        "Paul: Especially if she's trying to help somebody. Never mind if she's trying to save somebody. I never saw a lost cause she couldn't get behind.",
        "Dusty: She gave up on you.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm not so sure about that. Look, the important thing now is that we contain Emily.",
        "Dusty: There is no we.",
        "Paul: Well, there is if you need my help. And you do. Emily has done terrible things to you --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you made her do it.",
        "Paul: You know, if you really believed that, you wouldn't be so determined to keep her locked up. But you are. Dusty, you and I, we both have seen Emily at her worst, she tried to kill you. She tried to kill me she's dangerously unstable. At the very least, she needs years of psychiatric care.",
        "Dusty: I'll make sure that the judge knows that.",
        "Paul: To what it cost. Look, stop, listen, one second. Jennifer is determined to let Emily go free because she feels like she owes Emily something because Emily saved Johnny's life. And all she owes Emily is a thank you, and you know, maybe -- maybe she'll tell Emily that she'll check in on the kid once the kid's born. But that's all.",
        "Dusty: You want me to allow Jennifer to spend time with you and your kid?",
        "Paul: No, Dusty. This is not about me. Look, don't let Emily come between you and Jennifer. She's already has you and Jen arguing. I can tell. Don't, don't do that. That way, Emily wins. Don't go down that path. Please, let me handle Emily.",

        "Jade: Ah, hot water. You have no idea.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah, I do.",
        "Jade: Are you sure that Will is going to be okay with this? You know, if I'm staying here?",
        "Gwen: The only thing that could tick that boy off is if we don't save him any pizza. And that could happen, I'm starving.",
        "Jade: Me too. I've been living on ketchup and saltines.",
        "Gwen: I don't know how you're doing it.",
        "Jade: I don't really have a choice.",
        "Gwen: And your parents are --",
        "Jade: Not an option.",
        "Gwen: I've been there, too.",
        "Jade: Is that why you are being so nice to me?",
        "Gwen: Well, partially. And even though buying a paper off the internet is the stupidest thing you have ever heard of, in your own way you were trying to help Will graduate.",
        "Jade: He just, he just looked so lost, you know? I felt like I wanted to bail him out. And it all backfired. I felt terrible. He was scared to death that you were going to hate him.",
        "Gwen: I could never hate him.",
        "Jade: Well, obviously. You guys are amazing. You could get through anything together. I'm just, I'm really sorry that I gave Will such bad advice.",
        "Gwen: Everybody makes mistakes. I do. And if I could forgive him, I guess I could forgive you, too. And I felt for you, seeing how upset you were about Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Jade: I can't really talk about that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I can see that. But if that ever changes, I'm here. [Doorbell rings] Pizza. Can you get it? I left my wallet upstairs. Just tell him I will be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What the hell are you doing here? Whoa.",
        "Mike: You knew Simon was on this ship?",
        "Katie: No, I mean, not when i booked it.",
        "Mike: Then when?",
        "Simon: You might as well tell him, Katie.",
        "Katie: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Simon: I think it was fate, pure and simple.",
        "Vienna: It was me. I booked a cruise.",
        "Katie: I'll explain everything. Let's just go back to the cabin.",
        "Simon: That'll be cozy, right? Back in the room, nice, little dinner for four?",
        "Katie: Mike and I are going back together, alone. Good night.",
        "Simon: Katie. I wouldn't have told him, you know I wouldn't.",
        "Mike: Let's go.",
        "Vienna: You were in her cabin? Who exactly is this girl?",
        "Simon: My wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Daniel, remember that dinosaur book in my office? Let's go get it.",
        "Daniel: No, I want to stay with Mom.",
        "Susan: No, we'll come right back. Come on, come on.",
        "Jennifer: He's getting so big.",
        "Emily: I know. I don't get to see him much anymore, but every time I do, he's getting bigger. He's really growing up.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I'm glad you got a chance to see him today.",
        "Emily: Yeah. It's only for an hour, but who knows what is going to happen after I'm sentenced. Or committed. And I mean, it's my fault. I know, all this is my fault. It's just really -- it's really hard to see my son knowing he's hurting so much. Or to feel this baby kick, and know I will probably never get to hold him or her. But that's the way it is, you know? Daniel will grow without me and this child will probably never know me.",
        "Jennifer: I know what it's like to lose a child, Emily. Or to think you've lost one. It's awful. But you are a good mother.",
        "Emily: Thank you. That means a lot coming from you.",
        "Jennifer: I should go.",
        "Emily: Go on.",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You want Emily locked up, so you and Meg can play house in peace.",
        "Paul: Yes, that's true. Absolutely. And you want to have a peaceful home with Jennifer. We're not that different, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to take a child from its mother.",
        "Paul: It's my child. Johnny is your child. That's the point, Dusty. These kids. We have to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.",
        "Dusty: No deal.",
        "Paul: Dusty, look. I'm her brother, I know how to do this --",
        "Dusty: You know how to give your sister a nervous breakdown. Get out of here, would you?",
        "Paul: Stop, I'll go. Alright, but could just make sure that Jennifer stays away from Emily? The more time they spend together, the harder that it will be.",
        "Jennifer: Stop it! Both you. Stop ganging up on me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I don't know how you got in here or what kind of game you're playing.",
        "Jade: Shh, Gwen is going to hear you.",
        "Will: Gwen knows you're here?",
        "Jade: Yeah, she practically insisted that I stay.",
        "Will: What? Why?",
        "Jade: She ran into me at the hospital.",
        "Will: What were you doing at the hospital?",
        "Jade: I was looking for you. When you hung up on me. I needed to tell you that I had spoken to Maddie. And Maddie found out that I saw you graduation night.",
        "Will: You told her!",
        "Jade: No, I didn't tell her anything, but I thought you should know in case she asked you. I was trying to have your back.",
        "Will: Why are you even talking to Maddie?",
        "Jade: I work with her boyfriend.",
        "Will: Yeah, and whose idea was that?",
        "Jade: Listen, the point is Gwen saw me at the hospital, and we got into this huge conversation and apparently you told her I didn't have a place to stay.",
        "Will: Well, yeah, I mentioned it.",
        "Gwen: So she insisted that I stay here. What? You don't believe me?",
        "Will: I thought you were okay with how things were and the other night, and us just going our separate ways.",
        "Jade: What are you talking about?",
        "Will: Every time I turn around, there you are. First it's the job, and now you're moving in.",
        "Jade: I lost my job because of you, which is why I asked you to help me with Casey. And as far as me staying here? I tried to get out of it but I didn't have much of a case. Once Gwen knew I was staying on the street, I thought it would seem pretty suspicious if I said no. Listen, I know that you're married, and I'm not after you. Gwen is not going to find from me that we slept together.",
        "Will: Yeah, you say that now \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up, on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: I know you're not going to like it, but I'm going to have to do what I think is right.",
        "Jade: I think I should go. I'm going to get my stuff.",
        "Katie: You can't think that I still have feelings for Simon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You booked the massage. I was just lying there waiting for a good time. Not a good time, a relaxing time. And when the guy came in, I was lying down with my eyes closed, I thought it was the guy that you booked. How was I supposed to know that Simon bribed him and took his place?",
        "Mike: Simon was in the bathroom when I came back here, wasn't he?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Katie: Because I knew you would take one look at him and clobber him, like you just did. I was trying to prevent that. I made him promise to leave us alone, which he obviously didn't do, so I'm going to fix this.",
        "Mike: I don't you anywhere near him.",
        "Katie: You think I want him living across the hall? No, we're going to the purser, we're going to explain the entire situation, and get booked to a different cabin, okay? I never wanted to see that man again, especially not on our honeymoon. Mike, please wait. You can't think I still have feelings for Simon, not after all this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Your wife?",
        "Simon: Once upon a time.",
        "Vienna: Don't tell me, she's the one who got away?",
        "Simon: More or less.",
        "Vienna: And you've never gotten over her?",
        "Simon: Honestly not a subject I want to pursue right now, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Honey, don't worry. I've had my heart broken, I've even had my nose broken, but that's another story. What matters to me is not the past but the present. Right now. You and me. And all the magic we can make in a moment. So what do you say we do whatever it takes to forget that little blonde next door?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I can't believe it. We're still not past this? Admit it, you guys still don't trust me.",
        "Margo: I have no problem admitting that, do you honey?",
        "Tom: No, I'll cop to that. Could you believe that? Maddie on the front doorstep?",
        "Margo: And you guys are still seeing each other.",
        "Tom: And we're going away for the weekend.",
        "Casey: Mom? Dad? I'm a high school graduate.",
        "Margo: But Maddie is not. She's a minor. She's a young girl. She's living here on her own. We're not even going to talk about her brother, Henry whose not the best influence.",
        "Casey: She's living with Grandma.",
        "Tom: She is a young girl.",
        "Casey: Don't you think I know that? I would never do anything to hurt Maddie. What happened with Gwen was reckless and stupid and I would never make a mistake like that again. Don't you know that?",
        "Margo: Well, we hoped that you've learned your lessons.",
        "Casey: And what lesson was that, Mom? To never date again? To never have sex again?",
        "Margo: Well, no, but --",
        "Casey: No, no buts. I can tell you flat-out that I would never do anything with anyone again without doing it responsibly. And if you can't believe that, I don't know what else to say.",
        "Tom: Now listen, you have the hotel numbers, you have our cell numbers if you need to get in touch with us and we need to pick up Daniel, honey. Come on, let's go.",
        "Margo: I love you.",
        "Casey: I love you, too.",
        "Tom: Come on.",
        "Margo: All right.",
        "Casey: No, I've got it. I got it.",
        "Tom: I'm proud of you.",
        "Casey: Thanks Dad. Yeah, it's me.",
        "Maddie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: No, it's cool. They're gone. I covered it. But I would give it about half an hour before you come back. It would be just like them to circle around the block and come back.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Casey: Besides I've got some things I need to do.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Casey: And Mad, I can't wait to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Is something wrong?",
        "Will: Uh, no, I just -- I was just surprised to say Jade here, in her pajamas.",
        "Gwen: Jade, you want to give us a sec. You can go and check out the boy's room upstairs.",
        "Jade: Sure.",
        "Gwen: You didn't get my message.",
        "Will: No.",
        "Gwen: How's Johnny?",
        "Will: He's better. I'm sorry that I didn't check my voicemail, but I just wanted to get home.",
        "Gwen: I thought you were the pizza guy. That's why I sent Jade to the door.",
        "Will: So she's spending the night?",
        "Gwen: You obviously don't approve.",
        "Will: No, it's not that I don't approve --",
        "Gwen: Come on Will, I heard you. You sounded pretty upset, something about \"you say that now\", what was that about?",
        "Will: She's the last person I wanted to see.",
        "Gwen: I thought you liked her.",
        "Will: If you're talking about my part in getting her the job, then it wasn't about liking her, it's about just trying to help.",
        "Gwen: Well, that's why I asked her to stay. Now, I'm sorry I didn't check with you first, but I thought that you'd understand.",
        "Will: You were the one who had a problem with her.",
        "Gwen: You asked me to give her break, you asked all of us.",
        "Will: Yeah, that was different.",
        "Gwen: You don't want her here.",
        "Will: I don't want her anywhere near us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Thank you for checking before you brought him in. But everything was okay. Jennifer and I, we weren't talking about Paul, or Dusty or anything like that. We talked about our children, Daniel, her baby.",
        "Susan: I'm sure that she's very grateful to you for having help Johnny.",
        "Emily: I think she is.",
        "Susan: I'm very proud of you. I really am.",
        "Emily: Well, thank you. I'm trying.",
        "Susan: I know you are and so does Tom.",
        "Emily: I really think that Jennifer's attitude has changed towards me. I mean, I'm almost afraid to say it, but I think she actually feels for me, Mom.",
        "Susan: Oh, honey. That's wonderful because her support could make a big difference.",
        "Emily: I hope so.",
        "Susan: You just stay positive. Keep doing what you're doing. You need all the friends you can get now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Ganging up on you. I'm with you, Red. You know --",
        "Jennifer: No, you, you want Emily locked away.",
        "Paul: The state wants Emily locked away, because she broke the law. She's a danger to herself and anyone else who comes into contact with her --",
        "Jennifer: I am not denying what she's done or I'm not going into why -- and I'm not going into why she did it because we would be here all night. The point is, that she's had a chance to recover and to think, and she's begun to make amends.",
        "Paul: She should. Nothing has changed there.",
        "Jennifer: Well, why not? Why shouldn't her good behavior carry as much weight as her bad?",
        "Dusty: She did a good thing for Johnny, but you don't get to walk just for doing a good thing. All the jails would be empty.",
        "Jennifer: Well, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing!",
        "Paul: Oh, Jennifer, be serious.",
        "Jennifer: I am serious!",
        "Paul: No, you're not. You're not serious. You should, you feel guilty because Emily saved Johnny's life and you're going to get your child back and she's going to lose hers. But it's not like she's losing her children, it's just she wouldn't be there to raise them, because she has proven herself over and over again to be violent and unpredictable.",
        "Dusty: She's gotta pay the price.",
        "Jennifer: Don't you think that the fact she put herself into jeopardy, and risked her baby to save someone else, that means she's come a long way.",
        "Paul: No, nothing's changed. Look, don't get me wrong. I am truly grateful that Johnny's improving. But Emily is a loose cannon. She needs help.",
        "Jennifer: You two really think that you're helping her but keeping her children from her?",
        "Dusty: That's not really our problem, Red.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, she hurt you. And you want revenge. I get that. And Paul, you don't want her to interfere in your life with Meg, I get that. But she saved my son. And that is more important to me than your revenge and your free ride.",
        "Paul: Free ride?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, free ride. She is the mother of your child, no matter how much you want to pretend that she isn't. And if she's released, she's gonna get in your way. And you're going to have to deal with custody. Well you know what? That's just too bad. At least her children will know their mother.",
        "Dusty: She is a dangerous woman.",
        "Jennifer: Look, I know you're not going to like it, but I'm going to have to do what I think is right.",

        "Vienna: The floor -- moved.",
        "Simon: The floor? We haven't even gotten started yet, Sweetie.",
        "Vienna: Oh, not the earth, Romeo! The floor!",
        "Simon: Ah, baby. You want some of that motion sickness medicine?",
        "Vienna: Not yet. Not until I can keep it down.",
        "Simon: Well, I'll be in the bar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: It's not what you think, okay. It's not about jealousy or insecurity. I know you love me. But the guy is bad news. He nearly got us killed.",
        "Katie: Do you think I could ever forget that? I loved Simon. But it was a long time ago. A long time ago, when I believed in fairy tales. But I've grown up, Mike. I want a real life with a real man who comes home every night, wants to help me cook and play with the kids. I want a home and a family and a future that I can count on, I want you. You're my best friend. I can talk to you. I can count on you. I can trust you. I could never trust Simon. And I love you more than anyone I have ever loved in my life. So please, tell me that you feel the same and haven't I really have messed everything up.",
        "Mike: Of course I feel the same way. That's why I married you, Mrs. Kasnoff",
        "Katie: Say it again.",
        "Mike: Mrs. Kasnoff.",
        "Katie: One more time.",
        "Mike: Mrs. Kasnoff.",

        "Will: Look, I feel sorry for Jade, and I feel responsible for her losing her job, which is why I asked Casey to hire her. But her living with us? It's a whole other thing.",
        "Gwen: She's not living with us.",
        "Will: Then what would you call it?",
        "Gwen: Look, I know we wanted to get some alone time together, but this is a big place, we can manage. She just needs a place to sleep, and to take a shower. She's been living out of a backpack.",
        "Will: I know. And I don't want to sound selfish, but it's just, you know, you've come a long way towards accepting what's happened, and I just don't think that either of us need any kind of reminder of how I flunked out.",
        "Gwen: You didn't flunk out, you just didn't finish.",
        "Will: No, I flunked out and I cheated and she was a big part of that.",
        "Gwen: And yeah, you've both been punished. You didn't graduate, she lost her job, you don't need me piling on more junk.",
        "Will: So you're saying you can just forget it?",
        "Gwen: I forgive you. And her. So, I mean, unless there's something else going on here, I don't see why she can't at least spend the night. But, you know, it's up to you.",
        "Jade: I think I should go. I'm going to get my stuff.",
        "Will: No, wait. Jade, it's okay. You can stay.",

        "Margo: Yeah, Tom had to make a stop. So, we got to leave as soon as he gets here.",
        "Susan: Listen, thank you so much for letting them spend some time together.",
        "Margo: Oh, I was glad to do it.",
        "Susan: I keep thinking, you know, once Emily is in an institution, or God forbid, a hospital, there may not be many more moments like this. Not for years and years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We need to check on Johnny. You need to rest. You look like you are going to fall down. I'm not kidding.",
        "Jennifer: Please, please, don't change the subject. Okay, you know very well that the entire case against Emily rests on you.",
        "Dusty: I know that. She kidnapped me.",
        "Jennifer: I know very well what she did. But that doesn't mean you have to testify against her.",
        "Dusty: You don't want me too.",
        "Jennifer: I just want you to think about it. She saved the life of our child. So if you do go ahead and testify, I don't know, maybe you could at least find some way to recommend leniency given what's she done since then.",
        "Paul: What has she done? She's thrown herself off of a cliff. She has threatened over and over again to end a pregnancy unless I end things with Meg. She's an operator. Emily is an operator, and it wasn't a selfless act to help Johnny. She's manipulating you. And you, you're falling for it.",
        "Jennifer: She saved my son. That's all I know. And we owe her.",
        "Tom: Um, sorry. I was just looking for my dad.",
        "Dusty: We're waiting for him.",
        "Tom: I just wanted to see him before we left.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, where are you going?",
        "Tom: A short vacation, just a few days. Okay, then tell him I stopped by. I'll give him a ring from the road.",
        "Jennifer: Tom, Tom, I thought you might want to know that Emily, the cells that Emily donated, the treatment's working. Johnny is doing much better and the doctors are optimistic.",
        "Tom: Well, that's terrific, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks. And also, when is Emily's sentencing hearing?",
        "Dusty: Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I just want to know.",
        "Tom: The court will meet when I get back.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I may want to say something on her behalf.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: It's my decision.",
        "Tom: Well, you still have some time. So, if you feel the same way in a few days, then by all means give me a call.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: I can't believe you just did that.",
        "Jennifer: Please, can't you just think about what she has done for Johnny. She has given him his life. His future. And you know what would happen? If he grows up, and finds out that the woman who saved his life as a child is locked away and his parents did nothing to help her. How would he feel? Honey, please. You have to -- it's hard, but you have to open your heart. Won't you please just consider dropping the charges?",
        "Dusty: Red, you know how much I love you, and how much I love Johnny. There is no way I can let that woman go free.",

        "Gwen: It's fine. Will and I, we just -- we got our signals crossed. And for the record, you should know that I'm okay with what happened. And the cheating, you guys, you shouldn't have done it, but I understand and I'm over it. So that's the end of it, okay?",
