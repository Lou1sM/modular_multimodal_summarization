        "Jessica: Sorry. I'm not interested in negotiating some mutual strategy. Having sex with you was one of the worst mistakes of my life. And what I want to do about it is pretend it never happened.",
        "Doc: You're sure?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I'm sure, Doc. Why? Do you want it to be the lead story in your next broadcast?",
        "Doc: Why don't you just relax? I mean, remember, you and I are both on the same side.",
        "Jessica: Oh, how could that possibly be true?",
        "Doc: You think I want people to know about this? Trust me, I don't.",
        "Jessica: By people, you mean Margo.",
        "Doc: Yeah, that's right. She's one of them. Because I know you two are close.",
        "Jessica: Not close enough to admit that I was hiding in the bathroom when she showed up. It's so degrading.",
        "Doc: Well, good. You know, the less she knows, the better.",
        "Jessica: You are amazing. You could care less how this is impacting my life. All you care about -- is it gonna mess up your chances with Margo.",
        "Doc: Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. I just want to know that you meant what you said last night about not going public with this.",
        "Jessica: Doc, I'm not some football groupie who's going to brag to the world about how I got you into bed. I'm a mature, intelligent woman who lost her mind last night, and the only thing I want to do is never mention it again.",
        "Doc: That's fine with me. All right? I just want to make sure you and Margo don't get hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I have got a purse full of tissues here and I am not afraid to use them. I don't think I'm going to be able to say good-bye to Katie without -- Tom? What's going on?",
        "Tom: Why don't you tell me?",
        "Margo: I just got here. Is something wrong?",
        "Tom: Something's wrong. Something's very wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. Shh. Hi, Carly -- it's me. When you get this message, could you please give me a call? Cabot won't stop crying. And I am losing what little patience I have left. Okay? Thanks, sweetie. You know how it is. Bye. Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Jordan: What's wrong? Is it his teeth again?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it could be stomach flu -- or colic. Or the need to torture his Mother.",
        "Jordan: Well, give him to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Decorations are up. Food is out. You ready?",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know. This all happened so fast. It still feels like a dream.",
        "Simon: Yes, it is. You and I planning to start a whole new life down under.",
        "Katie: Saying good-bye to my family, our friends --",
        "Simon: I know it's gonna be tough. But you'll get to meet my friends. We'll start our own family. When we're ready -- I'm not rushing you. We don't have to do it right now.",
        "Katie: I know. I know. I'm just nervous leaving everything that I know.",
        "Simon: Sweetheart, you don't have to be nervous. Baby, it's just going to be you and me in the greatest country on earth.",
        "Katie: Right. Well, just keep telling me how wonderful it's going to be. Just keep telling me until we get on that plane tomorrow.",
        "Simon: It's without a doubt going to be the greatest adventure you and I have ever had. We'll have the life we've always wanted.",
        "Katie: Will you help me put on my necklace? The guests are going to be here any minute.",
        "Simon: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Tom, tell me, tell me. Tell me what's wrong.",
        "Tom: Be careful what you ask for.",
        "Nancy: Oh, you're here, good. How are you, dear?",
        "Margo: Pretty good.",
        "Nancy: Kim and Bob will be right down. You told her the bad news, I guess.",
        "Margo: No, no, he didn't.",
        "Nancy: You know the silver locket that we're giving to Katie, all of us, as a going-away present? The jeweler was not able to get the engraving done in time.",
        "Margo: That is too bad.",
        "Nancy: Well, I know we can send her the locket in Australia. But I was so looking forward to seeing Katie's face the first time she put that locket on.",
        "Tom: Yeah, so was I. That was what I was about to tell you.",
        "Bob: I suppose you told Margo about the gift, huh?",
        "Margo: Yeah, that's a tough break, yeah.",
        "Kim: Well, you know, I mean -- Katie doesn't really need gifts tonight. All she needs to know is that we're really going to miss her and that we love her a lot. That's what matters, right?",
        "Tom: That is true. Love is what matters. At least it's supposed to.",
        "Kim: Do you still want to borrow earrings from me? If you do, we should go up and look.",
        "Nancy: I knew I'd forgotten something. Be right back.",
        "Bob: Did you say anything to Margo?",
        "Tom: What, about her affair with Doc Reese?",
        "Bob: Oh, stop saying that like it's a foregone conclusion. Because it isn't. I just thought maybe you said to her that there's something that you two need to talk over later.",
        "Tom: I didn't say anything to her, Dad. I'm still too busy trying to figure out how I'm going to get some confirmation of what she's done.",
        "Bob: Look, this is going to be a tough night for Margo. I don't think it's a great time to start grilling her.",
        "Tom: Forget about Margo. I'll go ask Doc Reese.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Now you're concerned about whether or not Margo gets hurt? When you have done everything except throw a net over her head to drag her into the sack.",
        "Doc: How much has she told you?",
        "Jessica: Enough -- enough to know that yesterday wasn't the first time you two were alone.",
        "Doc: You know, I'll admit it. I've had something for Margo from the day I set foot in this town. Yeah, I could never shake that feeling. And to be honest, I didn't even want to try. But with you -- it was just like a bomb went off. No warning.",
        "Jessica: Well, congratulations, Doc. Another entry for your scrapbook, and you didn't even have to work for it.",
        "Doc: That is not what I meant. I just don't think you should beat yourself up about something that wasn't premeditated. It just happened, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: You know, that's the oldest -- the lamest excuse in the book.",
        "Doc: You know, why do you always gotta put an ugly face on this? I mean, who's to say that if you and I hadn't met a couple years ago when we were both free, that we wouldn't have developed a nice comfortable relationship.",
        "Jessica: Oh look, Doc, if you're trying to say that you could have feelings for me or anybody else, just don't bother. Okay? 'Cause everybody knows you're a player, you're a womanizer --",
        "Doc: You know, what does that make you? Huh? 'Cause if I recall last night, I didn't push you into that bed, Jessica. You jumped. So if you want to go ahead hating yourself about this, you go right ahead. But, you know, I am sick of your attitude. And I've had enough of it to last a lifetime.",
        "Ben: Hey, Doc! Do not use that tone talking to my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Oh, you're going to like this, Cabot. It's going to put you right to sleep.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, hey, hey, wait -- it's not too hot?",
        "Jordan: I already checked. See? Pretty toasty in there, right? I wish somebody would do that for me sometime.",
        "Rosanna: Hey -- hey. Here, take this, would you? Hey. That's incredible.",
        "Jordan: Well, you should see me change a diaper.",
        "Rosanna: I could definitely use a break.",
        "Jordan: Look Rosanna, I know how happy it makes you to have Cabot back in your life. But to do everything by yourself just doesn't make any sense. You need someone to help you with him. Otherwise --",
        "Paul: Sounds like you're applying for a job, Jordan. Is that your big plan? You gonna move in here and be Cabot's nanny?",
        "Jordan: Actually, I wouldn't mind that at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Katie! Simon! The man who came to breakfast, lunch and dinner is home.",
        "Katie: We're upstairs in the bedroom. Come on up.",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, hey, sorry. Hey, you know, I've been thinking about you and your trip to Australia, and I realize that there's an up side to it.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Henry: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, let's just think about it -- how many years have I just been a grain of sand underneath the eyelid of your relationship?",
        "Simon: Oh, uh, how many years has it been? One --",
        "Henry: Right. Absolutely. Okay, she understands. The point I'm trying to make is, you know what, I need my own life, my own relationships. With you and Simon here, I'm never going to get off the ground. So I plan on looking at this departure as an opportunity. You know, one that I wish had happened much sooner.",
        "Katie: You're miserable, aren't you?",
        "Henry: How'd you guess? I'm all right. I'm all right.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. Listen, we're not going that far. Well, it's far. But listen, as soon as we get settled in, you can come visit us.",
        "Simon: Absolutely. With a round-trip ticket. I'm going to go wait for the guests.",
        "Katie: Come here. I want you to do something for me.",
        "Henry: Name it. Anything.",
        "Katie: Find a girl, fall in love and show her the heart you've shown me.",
        "Henry: Okay. I'll get on that first thing in the morning. As for you, doctor, why don't take the rest of the afternoon off.",
        "Katie: Henry, I'm serious. You are an incredible person, and you deserve to be loved.",
        "Henry: Thanks. Thanks. I'll do my best to make that happen, okay? In the meantime, I don't want you to worry about me.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, that's not going to happen. I'm going to worry about you and Margo and my niece and my nephews and a hundred other people, all the way down to Craig, even.",
        "Henry: What about Mike?",
        "Katie: I couldn't forget about Mike. He doesn't need me to worry about him anymore. So -- anyway, I want you to promise me that you will take Snickers over to Nancy's.",
        "Henry: It's on my agenda.",
        "Katie: And if Faux comes back, you'll take her over there, too?",
        "Henry: Where is the little heartbreaker? I noticed that her part of the cage is still empty.",
        "Katie: Well, Simon seems to think that she's out in the woods. But who knows? Maybe she'll come back.",
        "Henry: I will, uh, I'll leave some pellets on that stump by the garden.",
        "Katie: Okay. Thanks. We should go downstairs.",
        "Henry: How do I look?",
        "Katie: Like the best friend I ever had. Okay. You -- I'm coming back to feed you one last time, my sweet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Enjoy your meal, little friend. It won't just be the last time Katie feeds you. It'll be the last time Katie does anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I know that you are used to having Cabot to yourself. But he has a father, now -- a real one. And you have to make space in his life for me.",
        "Rosanna: That sounds an awful lot like an ultimatum. And you know how I feel about those.",
        "Jordan: I don't want to turn this into a battle of wills. But, I'm just asking for some time with my son. There is nothing unusual about that.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. I brought those things you wanted, Jordan. And I thought you might need this. Is everyone okay?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we've certainly hit our quota of visitors for the day, haven't we? And a diaper bag? My, my, aren't we committed?",
        "Jordan: Well, I'm so glad that you noticed.",
        "Rosanna: As you said, we have things that we need to discuss. But I'm going to put Cabot down upstairs so he won't be disturbed.",
        "Jordan: I can do it.",
        "Paul: I can do it.",
        "Jennifer: Or me.",
        "Rosanna: No. I don't think so. It's my job.",
        "Paul: Need any help?",
        "Rosanna: No, thank you. But I could use some company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I missed you terribly.",
        "Jordan: Same here. So, what'd you get?",
        "Jennifer: A crib, toys, baby food, diapers -- I had no idea what to get, but there must be some of the right things in there.",
        "Jordan: You're wonderful. Well, I guess I'll set up the crib when I get back.",
        "Jennifer: Already done.",
        "Jordan: You set up the crib, too?",
        "Jennifer: Alfonso, the Lakeview handyman.",
        "Jordan: Ah.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Jordan: Smart.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I didn't know if you'd be bringing Cabot back there today. And if you do, I want to make sure he feels at home.",
        "Rosanna: Make sure he feels at home where? Jordan, if you want to be a parent, I am willing to put up with that. But Cabot does not leave this house without me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: It looked like you two were really getting into it.",
        "Doc: Yeah, I got into a little one-on-one last night with the doorman whose brother used to played for the Bengal's. One of those guys I knocked out of a game a few years back. My lawyer here was just reading me the riot act.",
        "Ben: Well, it sounded like you were reading it to her.",
        "Doc: Well, you know how it is being a former defender, man. You can't get that tuff out of your blood sometimes, but -- she was right, as usual. Yeah, I'm going to take your advice and do what you said. Just make sure no one knows about my -- bad behavior.",
        "Jessica: That would be wise.",
        "Doc: Hey, man. I didn't mean to shake things up, all right? You two have a good day.",
        "Ben: Remember when Doc first came to town? And I was so excited about getting to know him?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Ben: I'm not excited anymore. In fact, I'd like you to think about dropping him as a client.",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, when do you tell me who I should or shouldn't have as a client? And anyway, he's good for my practice.",
        "Ben: Well, he's bad for everything else. The guy is high-maintenance, is he really worth it? It's like he lives to stir things up. I mean, any other time, that might be fine, but we are trying to get pregnant here.",
        "Jessica: Are you sure that's still what you want to do? I mean, we've been having so many disagreements about it --",
        "Ben: Of course, that's what I want. I'm not sure how it's gonna happen, but you and I are having a baby.",
        "Jessica: Oh, thank you, sweetheart. You know just what I need to hear.",
        "Ben: So, does that mean that you're gonna think about telling Mr. Reese to find himself a new attorney?",
        "Jessica: Doc isn't important. I'm not gonna let him get to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Asking Doc Reese if he's sleeping with your wife won't accomplish anything.",
        "Tom: Well, it might give me a chance to punch him in the mouth.",
        "Bob: That's exactly what I mean. Don't do anything that you're going to regret.",
        "Tom: You know, when I think about all the problems that Margo and I have gotten through -- this is the time of our life, our marriage, when we should be just relaxing and enjoying each other. Now the good times have finally here, and what does she do?",
        "Bob: One more time. You don't know if she's done anything.",
        "Tom: I do know, Dad. Because I know Margo. What I don't know is how I'm going to get through this party pretending like nothing has happened.",
        "Bob: All right. Look, why don't I take Kim and grandmother to the party and you and Margo stay here and talk.",
        "Kim: Okay, you guys, let's get in the car. The party's gonna be over before we get there.",
        "Tom: All right. See you there.",
        "Kim: Okay, honey.",
        "Margo: Tom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Welcome.",
        "Margo: Hello --",
        "Simon: Come on in.",
        "Margo: Hi, darling. How are you?",
        "Nancy: We're going to miss you, cutie.",
        "Katie: Same here.",
        "Margo: Katie, we are going to miss you. Tom?",
        "Tom: I'm going to grab something to eat.",
        "Margo: Hey, how ya doing? Oh, God, baby, I know this is hard. But you and Simon, you're going to be really happy in Australia.",
        "Katie: You know how I used to always get into trouble, you know, and do stupid things without thinking them through?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. I remember every single one of them. Some I wrote down.",
        "Katie: I never would've done them if it weren't for you.",
        "Margo: Can you explain that better?",
        "Katie: Absolutely. I just -- I always knew in my heart that you would never let anything really, really bad happen. You know, you would always bail me out. And I'm really gonna miss that feeling inside. I'm gonna miss you so much.",
        "Margo: I'm gonna miss you, too, Katie. But listen to me, you and I, we don't have to be near each other to be close. 'Cause we're always going to be a part of each other, right? I mean, I've got your liver. But you've got my heart.",
        "Katie: Fun party, huh?",
        "Margo: Yahoo!",
        "Katie: I'm gonna go pull myself together.",
        "Jessica: Is everything okay?",
        "Margo: No, it's not. I mean, Tom is just acting so strange. I think that he might know something.",
        "Jessica: What do you mean, know something. Like what?",
        "Margo: About me and Doc.",
        "Jessica: Margo, no.",
        "Margo: I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm feeling so guilty about what I did, but I just -- well, you know what that feels like, hiding something from the man you love.",
        "Jessica: I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Margo: I mean what happened between you and Marshall. I mean, granted, things didn't go that far with Doc, thank God, but it wasn't for lack of trying.",
        "Ben: So, Shannon works with Katie at the hospital.",
        "Tom: Hi, it's nice to meet you.",
        "Ben: So, did you get somebody to cover your shift? Or did you just sneak out and hope that nobody would notice?",
        "Kim: You know something -- I was just telling your dad how much fun it would be if we could all go to Australia. Wouldn't that be fun? You, and Margo, and the kids, and your dad and me --",
        "Tom: Well --",
        "Ben: Hey, um, I should introduce -- Kim Hughes, this is Shannon Thomas.",
        "Kim: Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.",
        "Shannon: Hi. Same here. Are you the Mrs. Hughes who owns WOAK?",
        "Nurse #1: I was going to ask you about Doc Reese.",
        "Kim: Oh, Doc Reese. I know exactly what you're going to ask, and the answer is yes, he's even more attractive in person.",
        "Ben: Oh, see -- the women at the hospital have this thing for Doc Reese. How about at your place?",
        "Tom: My place?",
        "Ben: Yeah, you know, the DA's office.",
        "Tom: Oh, you know what, I just try not to notice.",
        "Nancy: Snickers will be my first rabbit. Is there anything special I should know about it?",
        "Simon: No, no. He's pretty low maintenance. But Katie's got a couple of books upstairs. When I get a chance, I'll go get them for you.",
        "Nancy: That would be helpful. I don't mind, Simon, telling you that I'm very sad that you're taking Katie away from us.",
        "Simon: Look, I know she's gonna miss you, too. I mean, you mean a lot to her. But if it makes you feel any better, I think this whole change is going to be great for her -- for us.",
        "Nancy: You mean because of where you found her when you came back here?",
        "Simon: Yeah. Well, I'm only sorry I didn't come back sooner. I mean, if someone had called me and told me that Pilar had sent Katie into a mental institution --",
        "Nancy: I didn't realize that you had known Pilar before you came back here.",
        "Simon: I didn't. No, no, no, I'm just saying, I've heard so much about her since I've been back here, I feel like I know her. But, no, I've never met her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I saw you come out here. Are you okay?",
        "Tom: Yeah, Margo and I should have probably stayed at your house and talk, like you said. My first attempt at joining the party was not a success.",
        "Bob: What happened?",
        "Tom: Oh, I don't know, everybody going on and on about how all the women in Oakdale are so attracted to Doc Reese. You know, it's just not what I wanted to hear.",
        "Bob: That's just party chatter. It doesn't mean anything.",
        "Tom: It's not chatter when my wife is the one sleeping with the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I look any better?",
        "Margo: You look like you haven't got a care in the world.",
        "Katie: Oh, I wouldn't go that far. I keep asking myself if I'm doing the right thing. But I made a choice, I know. It just -- wasn't always easy.",
        "Margo: Mike? Look, baby, I know the last couple of months have been really hard for you. But you did do the right thing. You stayed loyal to your husband.",
        "Simon: Listen, I'm going to grab that book for you, Mrs. Hughes. Don't you go anywhere, young lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Yep, this should work perfectly. Well, at least for me.",
        "Simon: Is somebody up here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As The World Turns\" --",
        "Jordan: If you expect me to just stand in the shadows, waiting for permission to be his father, then you are in for a fight that will never end.",
        "Rosanna: I'd like to propose a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Would you please stop talking to me in riddles?",
        "Tom: You want answers? Go get 'em from Doc Reese!",
        "Margo: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I'm getting a little tired of you laying down the law to me, Rosanna. All Jen said is that --",
        "Rosanna: Is that she wants Cabot to feel at home someplace else.",
        "Jordan: It's only fair that Cabot spend some of his time with you, and some of his time with me. You know, I want him to be as comfortable at my place as he is here.",
        "Rosanna: Cabot has been moved around enough. I want him to feel settled. I don't want to confuse him.",
        "Jordan: All right. Well, that I can understand. We both want what's best for him, so, for now, we will keep the status quo.",
        "Paul: For now?",
        "Jordan: But if you expect me to just stand in the shadows, waiting for permission to be his father, then you are in for a fight that will never end.",
        "Rosanna: I'd like to propose a deal.",
        "Paul: Rosanna -- don't do this. Jordan will twist everything around.",
        "Rosanna: Actually, Paul, it was your idea. Jordan, how would you feel about moving in with me?",
        "Paul: That was just a joke. I didn't think anybody would take me seriously.",
        "Rosanna: Well, why not? Jordan wants to have more time with Cabot. I could certainly use the help. It might work out for everybody.",
        "Jordan: But, for how long?",
        "Jennifer: Good question.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'd rather not set a time limit. Let's just say until Cabot feels comfortable, and you feel that you've bonded with him.",
        "Jordan: Okay. And then what?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we could have our marriage annulled, certainly. And perhaps set up joint custody? We'll see. We'll move on.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, excuse me. You were willing to get on a plane and leave everything you knew behind to get away from Stenbeck. Now you're going to invite this -- this into your home? James controls Jordan. Rosanna, please don't do this.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, I know you care about Cabot, but you don't have go by her rules.",
        "Rosanna: Look, if the two of you don't mind, this is between Jordan and me. Jordan, what do you say? Shall I set up a room for you?",
        "Jordan: Okay. I'll move in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Hello? All right.",
        "Pilar: So charming, so handsome. And soon, so dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doc daydreaming]",
        "Doc: You know, it's funny you brought that up. Because to this day, not many people realized that the defense actually won that game.",
        "Woman: Really? Well, it just seemed so obvious.",
        "Doc: Well, yeah, it's obvious to you, because you know football. And I bet you know a couple of other things, too. You know, I didn't catch your name, baby.",
        "Tom: You slept with my wife, and now you're going to pay!",
        "Ben: You slept with my wife, and now you're going to pay!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Look, why don't you go home and wait for Margo there, and stop torturing yourself?",
        "Tom: Because, this is supposed to be about Katie, and I'm not going to be rude.",
        "Bob: I don't want to see you pushed past your limit. You don't want to explode in front of a roomful of people.",
        "Tom: Dad, I'm not going to do anything like that. I've got it under control.",
        "Kim: Oh, good, there you are. Something's happened at the studio. I'm going to have to get over there.",
        "Bob: Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Kim: Oh, honey, no thanks, its fine. I can handle it. You stay here, I'll be right back soon, okay? Colin, hi, it's me. Do you have any idea at all where Doc Reese is? Okay, great. No, no, no. Don't call him. I'll get him myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: It's almost over, big guy. This time tomorrow, and Katie and I are out of here.",
        "Henry: You don't have to remind me.",
        "Simon: I'm sorry, mate, I didn't want to upset you.",
        "Henry: That's not what I'm talking about.",
        "Simon: Then, what's up?",
        "Henry: I saw you, and I heard you talking to Mrs. Hughes, okay? And I heard the way you talked about Pilar, and it did sound like you knew her. And, Simon, if that's true -- I don't know what to think.",
        "Katie: Me, neither.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Jen, come here. He's so beautiful when he's asleep.",
        "Jennifer: You know, maybe I should go. Leave you guys alone together.",
        "Jordan: You're angry with me, aren't you?",
        "Jennifer: No. No, no, no, no. Not even a little bit, I'm -- I'm just confused.",
        "Jordan: Because I agreed to move in here?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I just thought that we could've discussed it together, first.",
        "Jordan: Well, you're right. I mean, I shouldn't have agreed to it so fast, but Jen, this is -- you know, this is the first time Rosanna has given me an inch. And if she's willing to allow me to spend this much time with Cabot, I have to seize the moment.",
        "Jennifer: She'll still control every situation, even if you live here. Rosanna thinks that it's her divine right to call the shots. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but this place just brings back bad memories. And I don't want the two of us to become another one.",
        "Jordan: That's not going to happen. Okay, look, I know that we didn't count on me becoming a parent. But I am, and I can't walk away from it.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want you to, Jordan. You know that. Cabot is your son. And I know that you have to take care of him, only -- I don't know where that leaves me.",
        "Jordan: What do you mean? Nothing has changed, Jen. Are you afraid that Cabot is going to come between us?",
        "Jennifer: No. Well -- I'm afraid of how I'll act, or how I won't act. Or that you'll start to expect certain things from me, and I won't be able to deliver --",
        "Jordan: No, I don't want you to give me anything that you can't give. You know, for whatever reason. But -- Cabot, he needs full-time parents right now, Jen. And me moving in here is the only way that I can give that to him.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then that's what I want you to do.",
        "Jordan: Are you sure? You are an angel.",
        "Jennifer: I'm in love.",
        "Jordan: Look, this is -- it's not going to go on forever, okay? One day soon, I'll be free of Rosanna and ready to make a home for Cabot. And I want you there with us, Jennifer. Because you are the only woman I will ever want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's not too late, you know. You can still change your mind. Jordan comes back, you tell him he can't move in.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not going to do that.",
        "Paul: You've already let Stenbeck get closer to Cabot than he should ever be. Putting Jordan here is like asking James to baby-sit.",
        "Rosanna: I'll increase security at the gates.",
        "Paul: You don't honestly think that that's going to stop my father?",
        "Rosanna: I'll put guards on the roof. I'll put dogs in the yard. I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Paul: Why are you being so stubborn about this?",
        "Rosanna: Do you think I want Jordan here, living with me? Of course I don't. I don't want him under my feet all the time. But I think it might be what's best for Cabot. Carly has been at me constantly, saying how a child needs two loving parents. And if Jordan wants to be a loving parent to Cabot, then I think it quite possibly could be cruel to deny Cabot that.",
        "Paul: You want to know about cruel? Let me explain to you how cruel my father can be.",
        "Rosanna: I understand, okay? But didn't you also tell me that I should compromise with Jordan so James wouldn't get mad?",
        "Paul: Compromise is one thing. Exposing yourself to danger -- that's another thing.",
        "Rosanna: I've made my decision, okay?",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I won't say anything else. But if James is going to be so close, you're going to need protection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: What's with you two? Now, I have no idea who Pilar is, so what are we even talking about this for?",
        "Katie: Well, Mrs. Hughes is pretty sharp. Something gave here that idea, I'm sure.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, listen, ever since I've got back into town, I've heard all these horror stories about Pilar. Pilar did this, Pilar did that. So, yeah, I might have sounded a little familiar with her. Why is that so strange?",
        "Katie: Oh, you're right. I'm sorry, honey, it's just that every time I hear that woman's name, it drives me up the wall.",
        "Simon: Okay, so let's all make a little pact, here. We're never going to mention Pilar again, right?",
        "Katie: Fine by me.",
        "Simon: Deal? Okay, so let's get back to the business of saying good-bye.",
        "Katie: Let's mingle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You know, we had five architects bid on the ER expansion. The one we chose, it's just going to be state-of-the-art.",
        "Margo: You know what, Bob -- could you excuse me? 'Cause I really want to go talk to Tom.",
        "Bob: Oh, you talk to him anytime. You haven't heard all my doctor jokes.",
        "Margo: I know all the punch lines. I'll take a rain check. You know, I always had a thing for the strong, silent type. I just didn't know that you were one of them. You want to tell me what's on your mind?",
        "Tom: I didn't think you were interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: Oh, be good to my girl.",
        "Simon: You bet I will.",
        "Nancy: And you -- be good to yourself.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna try.",
        "Nancy: Now, is there anything more I need to know before I take Snickers home?",
        "Katie: No. I think you're all up to date bunny-wise. That's for you. I promised Snickers that I was going to feed him one last time before we go.",
        "Simon: Well, I'm going to come with you.",
        "Katie: Well, actually -- I don't want it to sound stupid, but -- do you mind if I go alone?",
        "Simon: No, that's fine. Sure. Go for it.",
        "Katie: Snickers? Are you up? I want to feed you before I go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Poor Katie. She's not going to like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I know how Stenbeck tormented you. And I don't blame you for being cautious. But I promise you, I won't let him get the better of me.",
        "Paul: Thank you. I hope you have a plan to stop him, because increasing security is not going to be enough. And it is exactly what James is expecting you to do.",
        "Jordan: Cabot is still sleeping. That blanket trick is a miracle. Just one question, though. Are you sure it's still okay for me to move in here?",
        "Rosanna: Positive.",
        "Jordan: Good. Well, then I will be back in a couple of hours with my things.",
        "Rosanna: You're more than welcome.",
        "Jennifer: I hope that goes for me, too, Rosanna. Because you should probably know, I'm gonna be spending a lot of time here.",
        "Paul: And so will I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Doc, I'd like to have a word with you.",
        "Doc: Something the matter, Mrs. Hughes?",
        "Kim: Maybe you should tell me.",
        "Margo: All right -- this has gone on long enough. Something's bothering you, Tom. And I gotta know what it is.",
        "Tom: You gotta get away from me, because I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Margo: But why? What happened?",
        "Tom: You think I have to answer that?",
        "Margo: Yes, I think you do. I'm worried about you. I've never seen you like this before.",
        "Tom: Well, that's funny. You see, that's exactly how I feel about you.",
        "Margo: Would you please stop talking to me in riddles?",
        "Tom: You want answers? Go get 'em from Doc Reese.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Tom: You get it now, Margo? I know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Snickers, my sweet little angel --",
        "Pilar: A lot of people think these animals never make a sound. But they do, you know? Especially when they're terrified. And today we're going to find out what it's like -- to hear a rabbit scream.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Pilar: Go out that window with me, or all you'll have left is a nasty little bloodstain to remember him by.",
        "Margo: Yes, I did. I went to see Doc. That's who I was with last night.",
        "Paul: I'll help you. I wanna be there for you. I wanna keep you safe.",
        "Carly: Why is that, Paul? What's in it for you?"
