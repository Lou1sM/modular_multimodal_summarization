        "Hunter: Alison -- Alison? Alison, hey.",
        "Alison: Hunter.",
        "Hunter: I've been texting you.",
        "Alison: I haven't been checking.",
        "Hunter: Uh, well, I decided to take you up on your offer.",
        "Alison: What offer?",
        "Hunter: To help me find my father. I think I'm actually ready to deal with it now.",
        "Alison: Good.",
        "Hunter: You know, I just -- I don't know where to start.",
        "Alison: Uh, well, ask Emily. I mean, she's the expert at tracking people down.",
        "Hunter: Emily, right. Uh, I guess I hadn't thought of that. Um, actually, I -- I guess I'm not too comfortable talking to anyone else about this. Alison?",
        "Alison: Huh?",
        "Hunter: You okay?",
        "Alison: Uh, I'm fine.",
        "Hunter: You look like someone killed your dog.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about my feelings, Hunter. Just blurt out whatever you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: I wasn't expecting to see you here.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know.",
        "Susan: Are you all right?",
        "Emily: I'm fine. Why?",
        "Susan: Well, I -- I've been thinking about your fertility treatments.",
        "Emily: And?",
        "Susan: I hate the way we left it. Trust Larry to make trouble where there wasn't any.",
        "Emily: Well, you weren't exactly ecstatic when I told you about it.",
        "Susan: I -- I was surprised. That's all. But if you really want a baby, Dr. Gardner is seeing patients today. She is the best fertility specialist we have.",
        "Emily: Right. Um, don't take this the wrong way, okay, but Larry already offered to help.",
        "Susan: I -- I know he offered to, uh, recommend someone. But that is not his field.",
        "Emily: Right. Well, actually, he didn't -- he's not offering to find a specialist. He's offering to help me find my missing eggs.",
        "Susan: Didn't we already do that? That's how we found that -- that receipt that Larry signed to get the eggs transferred.",
        "Emily: Maybe not.",
        "Susan: I thought you got confirmation of his signature.",
        "Emily: Right, but he -- he thinks he might have signed something that wasn't a transfer form -- a form that had nothing to do with the transfer.",
        "Susan: Is he saying that somebody deliberately misled him? For what reason?",
        "Emily: No. He's not sure. That's what I'm saying. He just knows that he had no intention of sending those eggs to Chicago. And he seems to think it's worth investigating.",
        "Susan: Oh, now he's a private investigator. Whoof!",
        "Emily: Mother, if he's willing to investigate it, then I'm willing to let him! What's the big deal?!",
        "Susan: Emily, those eggs are gone, no matter what your new best friend Larry is telling you. This is a man who can remember what he had for lunch at a Cubs game 30 years ago. For him to be claiming that he doesn't remember what happened -- it's a crock!",
        "Emily: I don't see what the big deal is. Just let him look.",
        "Susan: Okay, then. Good luck.",
        "[Emily groans]",
        "Larry: Emily --",
        "Emily: Huh?",
        "Larry: -- We found them.",
        "Emily: What?!",
        "Larry: Your eggs.",
        "Emily: You --",
        "Larry: They were here the whole time.",
        "Emily: You looked already?!",
        "Larry: I got here early. I figured I would -- I would start looking. I knew I never signed a transfer order.",
        "Emily: Tho -- those -- those are my eggs?",
        "Larry: Well-preserved. And hopefully still viable.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. Uh, I don't know how to -- to thank you. You --",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: You're amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: That came out so wrong. What I meant was that you looked terrible.",
        "Alison: That's better?",
        "Hunter: Well, not -- not bad terrible. Sad terrible.",
        "Alison: Hunter, if you keep digging this hole, I'm going to throw you in it.",
        "Hunter: All right, sorry. I -- I --",
        "Alison: Just stop!",
        "Hunter: Okay, I am done. So, is -- is anything wrong?",
        "Alison: Casey and I broke up.",
        "Hunter: Really? I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Alison: No, you're not.",
        "Hunter: Okay, because he's an idiot. Now, I know you like him a lot, and -- and you wouldn't like an idiot. But if he broke up with you, that's definitely something an idiot would do. Not that he -- he is one.",
        "Alison: Okay, I get it.",
        "Hunter: What happened?",
        "Alison: He did something really sucky to Riley.",
        "Hunter: That army guy?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I -- I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Hunter: That's no problem.",
        "Alison: Uh, let's talk about finding your dad.",
        "Hunter: I -- I just don't know where to start.",
        "Alison: Well, why don't we ask your mom?",
        "Hunter: You saw her. She's totally out of it.",
        "Alison: Last time. I mean, she might be more lucid today.",
        "Hunter: Does it work like that?",
        "Alison: Sometimes. And there may be a way we can help her remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You're alone.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You sound surprised.",
        "Holden: Well, with all your gentlemen callers, I figured I'd have to get in line.",
        "[Meg laughs sarcastically]",
        "Meg: Shut up and come in.",
        "Holden: Where is everybody?",
        "Meg: Well, Janet and Jack are working, and Mama's putting Eliza down for me.",
        "Holden: No, I meant all the guys lining up with flowers, candy.",
        "Meg: Not here. And there's not gonna be.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Meg: Dusty and I broke up.",
        "Holden: Oh, oh. Sorry to hear that.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You are such a bad liar.",
        "Holden: No, I -- I mean that. I do.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Holden: Sort of. I do want you to be happy.",
        "Meg: I am happy. I want to stand on my own feet and live my own life.",
        "Holden: So does this mean that Damian's out of the picture?",
        "Meg: That's right.",
        "Holden: I see.",
        "Meg: Okay, go ahead. Do your victory dance. I'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: How? How can you not know who's behind a hostile takeover of my company? What the hell do I pay you for?! I want to know who's doing this!",
        "Bonnie: I heard you from the elevator.",
        "Dusty: Listen, you have one hour to find out who it is, or you're fired.",
        "Bonnie: What's going on?",
        "Dusty: Someone bought up big blocks of Worldwide shares.",
        "Bonnie: Who?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out. My financial experts are clueless. Someone's trying to steal my company, and no one can tell me who it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Damian whistles]",
        "Damian: Lily. Wow, look at you. You look -- wonderful. Nice to see you.",
        "Lily: You look very handsome yourself.",
        "Damian: Thank you.",
        "Lily: Why are you in such a good mood?",
        "Damian: Uh, I'm just involved with a new business that's going very well -- an acquisition.",
        "Lily: Glad to hear that somebody's making money.",
        "Damian: No. The deal is what counts, Lily, making it happen. Money is just how we keep score.",
        "Lily: I see. Anything I'd find interesting?",
        "Damian: Very much so. In fact, it's possible that you and I might be partners again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I can't defend myself until I figure out who's behind this.",
        "Bonnie: What's the name of the holding company?",
        "Dusty: D.I. Madrigal and Associates.",
        "Bonnie: Well, that's kind of musical.",
        "Dusty: What if it was your company they were trying to steal?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, come on. Lighten up, Dusty. This is -- there is an upside to this whole thing.",
        "Dusty: Excuse me?!",
        "Bonnie: You really didn't like it there. I mean, you're not even the corporate type.",
        "Dusty: Does that mean I want someone taking what's mine?!",
        "Bonnie: Why not?",
        "Dusty: Are we speaking the same language?!",
        "Bonnie: Look --",
        "[Bonnie laughs]",
        "Bonnie: You don't even like being tied to an office. You grab at any excuse to do something else. Why not just let it happen and just cash out?",
        "Dusty: \"Cash out\"?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Cave in, you mean.",
        "Bonnie: No. It's like, uh, corporate jujitsu. You beat them by letting them beat you.",
        "Dusty: I'm not that Zen.",
        "Bonnie: You should try it.",
        "Dusty: No. I don't need eastern philosophy 101. I need a lawyer who can track down D.I. Madrigal and associates.",
        "Bonnie: Is that a challenge?",
        "Dusty: Are you up for it?",
        "Bonnie: Watch and learn, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: Who are you calling?",
        "Bonnie: A friend in high places. Hey, it's me. Um, how are things going at the S.E.C.?",
        "Damian: I've been buying up shares in Worldwide through my holding company.",
        "Lily: Why would you do that?",
        "Damian: I told you. To make money. Worldwide Enterprises is undervalued right now, probably because of poor management.",
        "Lily: You mean Dusty. Is that what this is about?",
        "Damian: They say that their C.E.O. -- he tends to be unfocused. The company's missed out on some major opportunities because of him.",
        "Lily: Don't tell me you care about Worldwide.",
        "Damian: I'd like to get involved in a -- in a local business. And now that things are working out with Luciano, it will give me a chance to put down some roots.",
        "Lily: By taking Dusty's company?",
        "Damian: He has no real investments in Worldwide. He just bought it from your mother to help her take it away from Paul Ryan.",
        "Lily: I know why he bought it.",
        "Damian: So wouldn't it be nice if I could get it back?",
        "Lily: This isn't about Worldwide. It's about Meg.",
        "Damian: Hardly.",
        "Lily: You're telling me you don't have feelings for her?",
        "Damian: On the contrary. I'm very fond of her. We became close friends.",
        "Lily: Just not as close as you'd like it to be.",
        "Damian: I won't deny that.",
        "Lily: Then let me give you some advice. The last thing Meg wants is to be the prize in some alpha dog slug fest, no matter who wins it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I won't deny that I think you're better off without certain men in your life.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Damian is still a friend.",
        "Holden: And that's all?",
        "Meg: That's all. I meant what I said. I want to stand on my own.",
        "Holden: Then I will do whatever I can to help you out.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: That defeats the purpose.",
        "Holden: No, I'm your brother. That's different. Besides, you know what? You're not gonna even need my help. You're one of the strongest people that I know.",
        "Meg: This is me we're talking about, right?",
        "Holden: You know what? You just haven't given yourself a chance to show what you can really do.",
        "Meg: You know what I really want to do? I want to be a good mother and a good nurse.",
        "Holden: Will Damian respect that?",
        "Meg: If he wants to stay my friend.",
        "Holden: Dusty won't.",
        "Meg: And that's why we're not together anymore.",
        "Holden: What about Paul?",
        "Meg: Paul is happy that I'm letting him see Eliza. Are we done with the roll call?",
        "Holden: It's a pretty impressive list, you got to admit. And I do mean that in a good way.",
        "Meg: All right.",
        "Holden: It's good to see a smile on your face.",
        "Meg: Yeah. It's been a while, hasn't it?",
        "Holden: Well, let's not waste it. Why don't you let Mama watch Eliza. You can come out with Lily and me, and we'll have a drink.",
        "Meg: You know, that sounds like fun.",
        "Holden: All right. She's at the Lakeview. She's having a meeting. Let's track her down.",
        "Hunter: Maybe you should give me a minute alone with her first, okay?",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Hunter: Hi, Mom.",
        "Aurora: Son. Who's your friend?",
        "Hunter: Oh, her name's Alison, remember? She came with me last time. Guess not. Alison's a nurse, Mom.",
        "Aurora: The nurses here are wonderful.",
        "Alison: Uh, how are you feeling today?",
        "Aurora: Very tired.",
        "Hunter: Mom, can I ask you a question? Last time I was here, we were talking about my father.",
        "Alison: Don't push her, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: I just wanted to talk.",
        "Alison: That's why we brought the music.",
        "Hunter: Oh, right! Mom, I brought you a music player. It's got all your favorites.",
        "[\"Tristan and Isolde\" plays]",
        "Hunter: Remember this? \"Tristan and Isolde.\" Mom, I'm gonna ask you something. Did you ever know a real Tristan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I can't believe it. I -- my eggs are actually in there.",
        "Larry: Look, that's not the best-organized research facility I've ever seen. It's easy to see how your mother or Bob -- they could have missed these.",
        "Emily: Well, thank God you didn't.",
        "Larry: Well, we were lucky. Listen, these things were buried in the back of one of the oldest freezers.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Over, what, 20 years?",
        "Larry: Yeah. It's a good thing, too, because if somebody had known these were in here, these could have been long gone.",
        "Emily: So what now?",
        "Larry: Well, these got to get back in the freezer, first thing.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Larry: Here. Thank you. And the next thing, they have to be tested, of course, to make sure they're still viable. Now, everything checks out, we can go ahead with the in vitro.",
        "Emily: God, I can't believe it. I -- I can't -- I can't believe this is actually gonna happen.",
        "Larry: If you're sure it's what you want.",
        "Emily: No, I'm absolutely sure. Are you kidding me? I just -- I'm -- I'm wondering if it's actually gonna work.",
        "Larry: Stay positive!",
        "Emily: Yeah. Easy for you to say. You, uh, don't live around here.",
        "Larry: Your mother.",
        "Emily: Yeah. She's not exactly on board. You know what? I'm beginning to wonder how hard she actually looked for those eggs.",
        "Larry: Yeah. She's always had strong opinions.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Oh! That's a very nice way of putting it.",
        "[Larry laughs]",
        "Emily: Wow. I, uh -- I owe you a -- actually a few apologies.",
        "Larry: What? No.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, number one for not believing you. I'm sorry. And, um, well, the second apology is the way I treated you 20 years ago when Alison came into the world.",
        "Larry: No. Well -- well, that was a -- that was a crazy situation.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I don't know. It didn't seem crazy to you back then, I don't think.",
        "Larry: Maybe not. But we're here now, so --",
        "Emily: Yes. We are.",
        "Larry: Yeah.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I don't know how to thank you. I cannot thank you. How am I ever gonna repay you?",
        "Larry: Well, I can think of a small way. I have tickets to a performance. My colleague canceled. Maybe you'd like to go with me.",
        "Emily: Uh, what -- what kind of performance?",
        "Larry: Say yes first.",
        "Emily: Okay. Yes.",
        "Larry: I don't want you backing out.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Okay, yes. What is the performance?",
        "Larry: The opera.",
        "Emily: Oh. The opera.",
        "Larry: Listen, don't worry. You're -- you're gonna love it.",
        "Emily: I don't know.",
        "Larry: Emily, a person who doesn't love opera doesn't love life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[\"Tristan and Isolde\" plays]",
        "Alison: It's beautiful.",
        "Hunter: It was always her favorite. Mom, the -- the reason I'm asking is that last time I was here, you called me Tristan. I was wondering if you remember why. Was Tristan someone you knew? Maybe a former student or something?",
        "[Aurora sobs]",
        "Alison: Are you okay?",
        "Hunter: Mom?",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Aurora: I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.",
        "Hunter: Mom, I --",
        "Alison: Okay, let her rest, Hunter. We'll visit again.",
        "Hunter: Yeah. This is hopeless. The whole Tristan business last week was probably a fluke. There is no Tristan in real life. It came from the opera.",
        "Alison: Maybe you have it backwards. Maybe the opera is special to her because there was someone real named Tristan.",
        "Hunter: How am I gonna find out? She's not gonna tell me.",
        "Alison: What does it say on your birth certificate?",
        "Hunter: I don't know. I've never seen it.",
        "Alison: Didn't you need it when you had to get a passport?",
        "Hunter: She got it for me.",
        "Alison: Really? Doesn't that seem a little odd to you?",
        "Hunter: She's always taken care of that stuff.",
        "Alison: Maybe because she didn't want you to see it.",
        "Hunter: Because it's got my father's name on it.",
        "Alison: We need a copy.",
        "Hunter: City hall?",
        "Alison: City hall.",
        "Hunter: Goodbye, Mom.",

        "Larry: Oh, you came!",
        "Emily: Of course I came! I'm not totally uncultured.",
        "Larry: Well, I knew that. You're far too beautiful and elegant. You look right at home in this crowd.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, thank you. I don't know. Something tells me these people know a lot more about the opera than I do.",
        "Larry: Oh, listen, you're gonna love this. Nothing speaks to the heart like this music.",
        "Emily: Hmm. That sounds good. I think my heart could use a good talking to. Shall we?",
        "Larry: Yes.",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Emily: So, \"The Barber of Seville.\" Is that -- so, what's this about? Some guy's eternal longing for a good haircut?",
        "[Larry laughs]",
        "Larry: Something like that. Actually, this is called opera buffa, which is a fancy word for \"Comedy.\"",
        "Emily: Oh. Oh, that's good. Now you're talking my language.",
        "Larry: You're gonna be amazed at how much of this music you recognize.",
        "Emily: I had no idea you were such an opera freak.",
        "Larry: Most of my life.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Larry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: That's so funny. I don't remember my mother ever mentioning that.",
        "Larry: She doesn't know.",
        "Emily: Why not?",
        "Larry: There were a lot of things your mother and I never found out about each other.",
        "Emily: I don't get it. How can you be that passionate about something and not share it with your wife?",
        "[Larry sighs]",
        "[Operatic music plays]",
        "Emily: Oh.",

        "Hunter: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey? Did you get it? What -- what did it say?",
        "Hunter: Well, let's start with what it doesn't say -- \"Jeremiah Hunter.\"",
        "Alison: Your father.",
        "Hunter: The man she said was my father.",
        "Alison: Well, whose name is on it? Tristan Wagner?",
        "Hunter: I think its pronounced Vagner, as in the guy who wrote the stupid opera. Told you she made it up.",
        "Alison: Well, you don't know that for sure.",
        "Hunter: You think he's a real person?",
        "Alison: I think it could be her name for a real person, yeah.",
