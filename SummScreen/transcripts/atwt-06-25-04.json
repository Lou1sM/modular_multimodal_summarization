        "Pilar takes Katie to Mike's boathouse and threatens to kill her. Henry and Simon discover she's gone, Henry calling Mike over. Mike calls Pilar on her cell phone, Pilar basically telling him she's in the boathouse. When Mike arrives, Katie throws a net over Pilar and she falls on the knife, killing herself. Katie then has questions for Simon when they return home, like why Pilar seemed to hate him even if she didn't even know him. Tom and Margo argue, Margo denying the fact that she wants anything to do with Doc. When he pushes her, she tells him that she did flirt with him, but nothing happened. Jessica comes over to help quell Tom's suspicions, but instead piques his curiosity further. Carly tells Roseanna that she thinks it's a horrible idea to have Jordan move in, making her more vulnerable to James' influence. Paul suggests he move in and Roseanna agrees. Kim threatens Doc to keep out of her family's life. Chris asks Allison to marry him."

        "Rosanna: What's the matter, Jennifer? Don't you think that Jordan and I can handle the new arrangement?",
        "Paul: Jennifer wants a recount.",
        "Jennifer: I only said that if Jordan is going to be living here, then you can expect me to be spending time here as well. I don't want that to be a problem.",
        "Jordan: And it won't be, as long as we all remember that what we want is what's best for Cabot here.",
        "Paul: How could you possibly know what's best for Cabot?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, don't start.",
        "Paul: And don't forget he backed into this deal by way of the federal penitentiary.",
        "Jordan: This isn't about Stenbeck.",
        "Paul: Your entire life is about Stenbeck, Jordan. If you don't know that by now --",
        "Rosanna: Hey, hey, hey, hey. [Cabot crying] Quiet, both of you. Now, I'm gonna go upstairs. I'm gonna check on Cabot. Why don't you just go to the Lakeview, get your things and bring them back?",
        "Jordan: I'll get them later, as soon as I make sure that Cabot's okay.",
        "Rosanna: That's okay. I can do it. He'll be fine.",
        "Jordan: He needs to get used to me, too, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Of course. You're right. Go ahead. Let me know if you need me.",
        "Jennifer: I'll help.",
        "Rosanna: Look, no matter how strange it's going to be having Jordan around the house, I am trying to realize that there is only one thing that's important, and that is a child deserves to know his father.",
        "Paul: What -- even if that makes you a thousand times more vulnerable? Look, I'm -- I'm just trying to help you out here, all right? I want to help you. I want to be there for you. I want to keep you safe.",
        "Carly: Why is that, Paul? What's in it for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm begging you. Please, don't hurt Snickers. He didn't anything to you.",
        "Pilar: They make a wonderful stew. Well, if you use the proper spices. My mother had a wonderful recipe for conejo con vino blanco. That's what I should have done with the last one.",
        "Katie: What last one?",
        "Pilar: You didn't get my little present?",
        "Katie: Faux?",
        "Pilar: Don't look so sad. I made it swift.",
        "Katie: How could you kill an innocent little rabbit?",
        "Pilar: Shall I show you?",
        "Katie: No, I --",
        "Pilar: Then move. Go out that window with me, or all you'll have left is a nasty little blood stain to remember him by.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So what is it exactly that I've done?",
        "Tom: I know where you went last night.",
        "Jessica: Tom, it's Katie's party. She's leaving soon.",
        "Margo: Yeah, Jessica's right. Please don't do this here.",
        "Tom: You went to see Doc Reese, didn't you?",
        "Margo: Okay, yes, I did! I went to see Doc. That's who I was with last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: With all due respect, Kim, what I do in my private life is none of your business.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, when it starts to affect my family, it becomes my business. You know perfectly well that Tom Hughes is my stepson. And he is very upset about his wife.",
        "Doc: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Kim: Are you?",
        "Doc: Of course I am. Tom and Margo are good people.",
        "Kim: I don't believe this is happening. I almost feel responsible.",
        "Doc: Responsible for what?",
        "Kim: Because of your escapades and because I thought you were a friend to Tom and Margo. I asked Margo or Tom to talk to you about your behavior, and now what is this? Your way of getting back at me?",
        "Doc: I tell you, I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.",
        "Kim: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you do. I've have overlooked a lot of excessive behavior where you are concerned. But if you do anything to hurt our son and his family, I'm gonna chew you up in little pieces and hang you out to dry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Maybe you two should talk about this.",
        "Tom: Too late, Jess.",
        "Margo: Would you just give us a moment, please?",
        "Jessica: Okay, fine.",
        "Margo: Yes, I went to see Doc. Yes, I tracked him down. But, no, not to encourage him.",
        "Tom: No?",
        "Margo: No. Things have been getting out of hand. Ever since the first \"hello,\" it's just -- he's so -- every time I see him, he's got another come-on.",
        "Tom: This is not about a few come-ons.",
        "Margo: I wanted to tell him to knock it off. He feels that every woman should just fall all over him. And I didn't want him to do that anymore, and I didn't tell you because I didn't want to have this fight.",
        "Tom: That's not the reason you didn't tell me, Margo. You didn't tell me because I have a hunch you like what's going on. I think you like it a lot!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, I'll do anything you say. Just please put Snickers down.",
        "Pilar: In time.",
        "Katie: What was that, a ransom note?",
        "Pilar: Just a message for Simon. Now move. Open the window. If you climb down that trellis very carefully, I'll release your friend and follow. And, Katie -- if I were you, I'd be as quiet as a bunny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, this is so civilized it's making me sick.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what would you have me do? I was out of options.",
        "Carly: So you made Jordan your roommate? And what were you doing all this time?",
        "Paul: Pretty much what you're doing now -- trying to talk some sense into her and running into the same brick wall.",
        "Rosanna: Carly, haven't you been the one telling me over and over again that Cabot needs his father?",
        "Carly: Does Cabot need his grandfather, too? If I were you, I would start loading up on the garlic and the crucifixes, Rosanna, because you're going to need them if you let Stenbeck's son live under your roof.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan has assured me he wants nothing to do with James.",
        "Carly: No. It doesn't matter what Jordan wants. It doesn't matter what you want. It only matters what that psycho wants. Don't you understand that? He is the one who manipulated you into this marriage, into this adoption of Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: And I have my son.",
        "Carly: For how long? Nobody knows why James does the things he does. And if you think you do, you're lying to yourself. He just wants to hurt people. It's his idea of a rousing good time!",
        "Paul: Nobody wants anything to happen to you, Rosanna. That's all. And in answer to your question, Carly, what's in it for me? Just this. Just the chance to know that it'll help me to keep Rosanna and her baby safe.",
        "Carly: No. No, safe cannot be in the picture when James Stenbeck is around. And I don't want to wake up to the headline, \"local heiress missing without a trace.\"",
        "Rosanna: You won't.",
        "Carly: Can you promise me that? Both of you? 'Cause I'm more than a little scared here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So you want me to believe that you're a victim of Doc Reese's harassment? Let me tell you the problem I have with that. Most guys don't let it go on that long, unless they're getting a little encouragement!",
        "Henry: Cheese, cracker?",
        "Margo: Get lost, Henry.",
        "Henry: That's an excellent idea.",
        "Simon: Listen, Tom -- look, I really don't want to interfere here, but this is Katie's last night.",
        "Henry: Yeah, so neutral corners, kids.",
        "Tom: No problem! I'm leaving anyway.",
        "Margo: I am, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Kim, you have a great family. I mean, I wouldn't mess with that.",
        "Kim: You're all about family values, Doc?",
        "Doc: I know you don't think much of me, but believe it or not, I would give anything to have a kid like Casey.",
        "Kim: Well, for all you know, maybe you do.",
        "Doc: Listen, I know I had a reputation for being a little risky on the field, but I know the difference between the game and real life.",
        "Kim: No. No, everything's a game to you, Doc. Especially when you're trying to win a happily married woman.",
        "Doc: Happily married women never give me the time of day. I think you're talking to the wrong player here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Go ahead, talk. Tell me exactly what is going on between you and Doc Reese.",
        "Margo: You have seen this guy in action. He doesn't need any encouragement. Hitting on women is a way of life for him, so don't sit there and tell me that I encouraged this, because I didn't. I'm really beginning to resent this, Tom.",
        "Tom: You're beginning to resent this?",
        "Margo: I have tried to stay away. I tried. That -- that morning -- that morning that you sent me over to WOAK with the legal papers --",
        "Tom: What, and you just can't say, \"hey, I'm really uncomfortable around this guy\"?",
        "Margo: Well, I didn't want to mention it to you because I didn't want to -- I didn't want to make a big deal of it. I just went. And Doc was Doc, but nothing happened.",
        "Tom: If nothing happened, then why'd you have to keep it to yourself? Suddenly you can't confide in me anymore? Look, Margo, if you're not happy --",
        "Margo: I didn't say I wasn't happy.",
        "Tom: Would you please stop? I live in that house! The silence speaks for itself. You've been so distracted, I can't tell you the last time we had a real conversation. And these days, you're never where you say you're going to be.",
        "Margo: Great, Tom, so I have to report to you --",
        "Tom: Whatever it takes.",
        "Margo: All right, Tom, all right. I liked it. I liked it a lot. I liked the attention that he was giving me. He noticed me. Doc really noticed me. He made me feel young, and he made me feel pretty. He made me feel the way that you used to.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm sorry I'm not throwing roses at your feet every time you waltz into the house. So if you're ticked off because you think I'm taking you for granted, then bring it home! If there's stuff we have to work out, we can work it out there. But don't bring a stranger into our marriage!",
        "Margo: I didn't! Would you keep it down? I did not. Oh. I can't -- I can't deal with this.",
        "Tom: You know what? I need it. I need the truth. I need my wife to act like my wife. So stop trying to run away!",
        "Margo: Stop giving me reasons to.",
        "Chris: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Tom: Nothing!",
        "Margo: I'm going. Will you tell Katie that I will call her later? Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: A man who appreciates 20-year-old scotch -- better be able to afford it.",
        "Doc: Well, I'll tell you that spike in the ratings shouldn't hurt my career at all.",
        "Kim: Listen to me, sport. I have told you, there is more at stake here than higher ratings.",
        "Doc: Not in TV land.",
        "Kim: Yes, in TV land. Let me remind you that the last two markets you were in, you left because of personal reasons. If I find out you've been lying to me --",
        "Doc: Then I guess I'll just have to change my taste in scotch.",
        "Kim: I guess you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Can't remember the last time I saw Tom that angry.",
        "Ben: He was pretty tense all night.",
        "Alison: It sounded like World War III.",
        "Chris: Yeah. And Tom's usually Mr. Cool.",
        "Ben: Well, take it from another Mr. Cool, when it comes to your wife, it doesn't take much to light your fuse.",
        "Simon: I really should go check on Katie.",
        "Nancy: Didn't she say she was going upstairs to feed Snickers?",
        "Simon: Yeah, but she's been gone a while. Listen, mate, can you do me a favor? Can you run up and see where Katie's at?",
        "Henry: Yeah, you got it.",
        "Simon: Thanks.",
        "Henry: Hey, Bubbles, your presence is requested. Katie, come out, come out, wherever you are. Hey. Hey, who let you out, huh? Snickers, have you seen Katie? You know, I hate to tell you this, but you are no lassie.",
        "Simon: Henry, you up here?",
        "Henry: Huh? Yeah.",
        "Simon: Where is she?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I just asked Snickers the same question.",
        "Simon: Did you take him out of his cage?",
        "Henry: No, that's how I found him.",
        "Simon: Did you open this window?",
        "Henry: No, Katie must have.",
        "Simon: All right, where the hell is she, man?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I don't know. But you're giving me a really bad feeling about this.",
        "Simon: Me, too.",
        "Henry: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Simon: Pilar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why did you bring me all the way out here?",
        "Pilar: I thought it was fitting, Lady Kate. You didn't know? Michael must have planned it as a surprise in happier days. I stumbled upon it while you were tucked away in that nice little mental hospital. Michael's always been so good with his hands. Don't you agree?",
        "Katie: You don't have to kill me, Pilar. Mike is free now.",
        "Pilar: Michael will never be free.",
        "Katie: Simon and I are going to Australia.",
        "Pilar: Is that what he's promised?",
        "Katie: Yes, we're leaving tonight.",
        "Pilar: Did he also promise to love you?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Pilar: And cherish you, till death do you part? Simon's promises are all lies! You know what I think? I think Mike was hoping you'd find that out and come running back to him.",
        "Katie: No, he's not. He doesn't -- he knows better. He knows I would never leave Simon.",
        "Pilar: That won't change what's in his heart.",
        "Katie: Once I'm gone, everything will be different. You can start over. I will be --",
        "Pilar: He doesn't want me anymore! After everything I went through to prove my love for him -- still, he wants you. He deserves to be punished for that.",
        "Katie: Did you hurt Mike?",
        "Pilar: Only one thing will hurt Mike -- finding out what it's like to be left all alone. His Lady Kate will never love him again -- not from her grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: One day, I'm going to look back and realize that I have done what Barbara has done. I have raised my son to be a good and decent man against all odds.",
        "Carly: That's what I want, too. So let's stack the odds in your favor then.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, great. How?",
        "Carly: Start by evicting Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't want to evict Jordan. I want him here, where I can keep an eye on him. I can see where he goes and what he does.",
        "Carly: And you'll know if he's visiting the federal prison? That's what he did when he couldn't find you, Rosanna. And when he needs something else, he'll do it again.",
        "Rosanna: Well, if I take him to court, I will lose. He will get custody of Cabot, and they will take Cabot away from me.",
        "Carly: If that's what Stenbeck wants, that's what will happen anyway. [Cell phone rings] Oh, it's Jack. Talk to him.",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "Carly: He can help you. He can at least post a guard or security or something.",
        "Rosanna: No, don't answer that phone. I will not turn my house into an armed camp. Look, I'll handle it, okay? Just trust me. I'll call Jack -- I promise -- if anything happens.",
        "Carly: Hi. No, everything's fine. Rosanna was just a little worried because Cabot had the sniffles, you know. But he's all right now, so -- yeah. No, I understand. I'll be right there. Okay. There's nothing more I can do here anyway. I love you, too.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Carly: Jack has to go back to the station, so I should head home. But this conversation is not over.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sure it isn't.",
        "Carly: And you will call me if anything happens, if you need me.",
        "Rosanna: I will.",
        "Carly: I love you.",
        "Rosanna: I know. I love you.",
        "Paul: You know, Carly's right. You do need someone to look out for you. And not just once in a while, on an everyday basis. And I think, Rosanna, that I'm the perfect guy for the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I can't believe I actually got him settled down.",
        "Jennifer: You're turning into a real Dad.",
        "Jordan: You okay?",
        "Jennifer: This feels so weird, Jordan -- you living here with a child and a woman that you're still married to. I just -- I don't know the rules for this.",
        "Jordan: I'm only here because of Cabot.",
        "Jennifer: And I understand that. But Rosanna is part of this deal for the rest of his life.",
        "Jordan: Jen, look, I know that you are not prepared for this. Some days I'm not sure that I am.",
        "Jennifer: I'm trying. I really am.",
        "Jordan: Do you know what's getting me through this? Knowing how much I love you. And knowing that as soon as Rosanna and I get this marriage annulled, it's going to be our time, yours and mine. And we can start planning our life together. I want that, Jen. Please, tell me you still want it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: She's not picking up her cell.",
        "Simon: There are two sets of footprints, but the car is still here.",
        "Henry: All right, I'm calling the cops.",
        "Simon: No! No, hang it up.",
        "Henry: Simon, wait. Simon, wait a second. If Pilar really does have Katie --",
        "Simon: If Pilar does have Katie, and the cops come in there with sirens, she'll panic. Please, just go downstairs, tell the guests Katie's sick, tell them anything. And I'm gonna go after Pilar.",
        "Henry: No, listen, we need dogs. We need search teams.",
        "Simon: Damn it, Henry, do not argue with me. I'm going to bring Katie home. You stay here.",
        "Henry: No. No, I'm not. If Katie's in danger, I'm coming with you.",
        "Simon: Just do what I say, okay?",
        "Henry: Mike, this is Henry. I need you at the cottage. It's an emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, Casey? Case?",
        "Margo: He's at Rick's.",
        "Tom: Overnight?",
        "Margo: I don't know. For the next couple of hours or so.",
        "Tom: Good.",
        "Margo: So you're talking to me now?",
        "Tom: Me? You've been walking around this house like a ghost. I can't even tell if you want me in the same room.",
        "Margo: Not tonight.",
        "Tom: Well, then what about the other day? You and I in bed in the middle of the afternoon? I mean, what was that about? When was the last time that we had sex like that?",
        "Margo: I didn't hear you complaining.",
        "Tom: So who were you with? Was it me? Or was it Doc Reese?",
        "Margo: This is not about Doc Reese.",
        "Tom: Here's what I think -- I think a little flirting got out of hand. Because if this jerk was hounding you, and it became such a big problem that you had to hide it and lie to me -- how far did it go?",
        "Margo: I have told you how far it went. Now if you want to get into our lives the last couple of months, let's talk about all the nights that we didn't sleep together. Let's talk about all the nights that you were down here pouring over cases. Let's talk about all the nights that I got called away to the station.",
        "Tom: Okay, maybe we got too comfortable.",
        "Margo: No. We got bored.",
        "Tom: If I have ever taken you for granted, I apologize. I love you so much. You are the most beautiful woman I've ever known. If I've neglected to tell you --",
        "Margo: It's okay.",
        "Tom: Look, I'm just trying to get some answers, something that makes sense to me. So when I ask you, I want you to look at me in the eye. Did you sleep with him -- with Doc Reese?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Tom: Did you want to?",
        "Margo: Why don't you just tell me what you want me to say, and then I'll say it?",
        "Tom: I want to hear the truth.",
        "Margo: I gave you the truth. You've got the truth. Do what you want with it.",
        "Tom: Please don't walk away from this.",
        "Margo: Oh Tom, you humiliated us in front of our family, in front of our friends. You kept me from saying good-bye to my sister. Now you're putting me on the witness stand. I don't know how you think that you've helped our marriage tonight. I've got nothing more to say to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hi -- I'm sorry, people. Katie feels just awful -- awful about this. But I think it must be like a 24-hour bug.",
        "Bob: Well, maybe I should take a look at her?",
        "Henry: No, no, no. No, she's fast asleep.",
        "Nancy: Where's Simon?",
        "Henry: Simon -- Simon is -- Simon went to the drug store --",
        "Mike: Henry, what's going on?",
        "Bob: Hello, Mike.",
        "Mike: Hi. What's wrong with Katie?",
        "Henry: A moment, please?",
        "Nancy: I don't want to leave until I know that Katie's all right.",
        "Chris: Okay, Dad. Why don't you let Alison and I stay with Gram, and we'll drive her home later?",
        "Bob: That'd be great, then I can catch up with your mother. See you.",
        "Jessica: Poor Margo.",
        "Ben: Poor Margo? Did you know about her and Doc?",
        "Jessica: Well, I knew he was flirting with her, but I don't think it any more serious than that.",
