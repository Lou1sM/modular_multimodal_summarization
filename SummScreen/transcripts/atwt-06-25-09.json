        "Carly: Those are beautiful.",
        "Craig: I have a question for you. Did you really say that you'd marry me, or was that just a dream?",
        "Carly: Well, if it was a dream, I suppose we were having the same one.",
        "Craig: Huh. And in the cool light of day, you haven't changed your mind?",
        "Carly: If I have changed my mind, do I still get the flowers?",
        "Craig: Not on your life.",
        "Carly: Hmm. Well, then, I suppose I'll have to go through with it.",
        "Craig: Oh! So that's your reason.",
        "Carly: What can I tell you? I'm a sucker for white roses.",
        "Craig: So, tell me the truth. Jack had every reason in the world why this is a bad idea.",
        "Carly: I said yes, and I meant it.",
        "Craig: You didn't answer the question.",
        "Carly: You didn't ask a question.",
        "Craig: You didn't tell him.",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Craig: So, what happened?",
        "Carly: What do you think happened? I chickened out. But I'll tell him today.",
        "Craig: How do you know you won't chicken out again?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I don't.",
        "Craig: Okay, then. I'll tell him.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Craig: I'm serious.",
        "Carly: You are seriously out of your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I am so jealous that you have the day off today.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Janet: Mm! I'd rather spend it with you.",
        "Jack: You can always call in sick.",
        "Janet: Mm. I can't. We're understaffed. Vienna's doing that TV show, and Henry hasn't been himself lately. There is no place I'd rather be than right here on your lap. Mm. What are you gonna do with your day?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Janet: Well, it's beautiful outside. You're not gonna mope around in here, are you?",
        "Jack: Actually, I thought I'd go ask the kids if they wanted to come by and -- and see the fireworks.",
        "Janet: Uh, have you ever heard of a telephone?",
        "Jack: I'm not allowed to see my kids? What?",
        "Janet: You just want to go over there so you can check up on Carly.",
        "Jack: No, that's not what I'm doing at all.",
        "Janet: Do you think she stopped drinking?",
        "Jack: I do.",
        "Janet: But you still want to go check on her.",
        "Jack: With Craig running interference, it's hard to know what's really going on, okay? And -- and now it seems like he's calling all the shots.",
        "Janet: Oh, I doubt that. But he is a big part of her life.",
        "Jack: Gee, when you put it that way --",
        "Janet: Well, you'd better get used to it, because he's gonna be around for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You really think Jack will take it better if it comes from you?",
        "Craig: Jack and I have come to a certain understanding.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Carly: You don't have the foggiest idea what Jack understands, believe you me.",
        "Craig: Come on. I'm trying to be optimistic here. And if he wants to go nuclear over it, I'd rather he do that at me.",
        "Carly: My knight in shining armor.",
        "Craig: You should concentrate on breaking the news to your kids.",
        "Carly: Right. That should be a hoot, as well.",
        "Craig: Exactly.",
        "Carly: You really don't have to do this, you know?",
        "Craig: My job from now on is to protect you. So, if you'll excuse me, I need to slip into my hazmat suit and give your ex the good news. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I hate this.",
        "Katie: Brad --",
        "Brad: No, I hate this. You're supposed to be in bed until the baby's born. I mean, that -- that's what the doctor says. I mean, you -- you're not supposed to be going out by yourself.",
        "Katie: I'm just going to see the doctor.",
        "Brad: I should take you.",
        "Katie: You have to work.",
        "Brad: Well, that shouldn't matter.",
        "Katie: You do want the pip-squeak to go to college, don't you?",
        "Brad: I'll call in sick.",
        "Katie: No, you won't.",
        "Brad: Then I'll tell Kim the truth.",
        "Katie: Brad, please, calm down. It's fine. What's the difference if I go in your car than a cab?",
        "Brad: I would be with you instead of being with that bag, Geneva Swift. I just cannot believe they want to make her a regular on the show.",
        "Katie: Well, Kim thinks she's good TV.",
        "Brad: I should refuse to be a part of it.",
        "Katie: College, Brad.",
        "Brad: No, okay, it is a question of journalistic integrity.",
        "Katie: You're not a journalist. You're a -- a TV personality. And now so is he.",
        "Brad: \"He\" who?",
        "Katie: What? She -- I mean, she -- Geneva Swift.",
        "Brad: See?! See?! You know she's a freak, too, okay?! Remember that next time you tell me not to judge a woman by their looks.",
        "Katie: I wasn't judging her! I wasn't!",
        "Brad: Well, Kate, then why did you call her a \"He\"?",
        "Katie: Geneva Swift is a fad. She will burn out fast, and Kim's gonna see it first and get rid of her. I promise.",
        "Brad: Oh, I hope so.",
        "Katie: Me too. Okay, you got to go.",
        "Brad: You know what? I just -- I just think that -- Henry should drive you.",
        "Katie: What?!",
        "Brad: Yeah. I mean, I'm sure he would love to do it.",
        "Katie: No, no. I -- I don't want Henry to. He's a warrior.",
        "Brad: Worse than me?",
        "Katie: You're the father of the baby.",
        "Brad: Which is exactly why I should be there!",
        "Katie: But you can't go!",
        "Brad: Okay, well, I'm calling them right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: I think this makes me look hippy.",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "Henry: Hey, aren't you gonna be late for the studio?",
        "Vienna: I know what time it is.",
        "Henry: Why are you still here?",
        "Vienna: Why are you rushing me?",
        "Henry: Mm, what's wrong, Sweetie?",
        "Vienna: I'm not ready. I need more practice.",
        "Henry: Practice for what?",
        "Vienna: For today's show. I'm supposed to do a pole dance.",
        "Henry: Pole dance?",
        "Vienna: Yes. Kim thinks that it will get the sparks flying between me and Geneva Swift.",
        "[Henry chuckles]",
        "Henry: I'm -- I'm sure you misunderstood. She probably wants you to have a discussion on pole dancing but not actually demonstrate it.",
        "Vienna: No. All I can tell you is that they were setting up a pole on stage four last night.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. They -- they can't do that, not on -- not on daytime TV.",
        "Vienna: It's just dancing.",
        "Henry: No, it's not just dancing. It's -- it's lewd, licentious, lascivious dancing.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God! You sound just like her.",
        "Henry: Like who?",
        "Vienna: Geneva Swift!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I -- I really don't think it's fair to ask Henry to take me to the hospital.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because he has a million things to do! Vienna is so busy with the show that he has to pick up the slack at Metro and the diner.",
        "Brad: Oh, come on. He can get someone to cover --",
        "Katie: No, he can't do it!",
        "Brad: Are you okay?",
        "Katie: I'm fine. Henry's not.",
        "Brad: Is he sick?",
        "Katie: Yes. Not regular sick. Heartsick. Well, obviously, he's still mourning the loss of their child. So to have him come with me to the hospital to check up on ours just -- it doesn't sound right.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right, yeah. Okay.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Yeah. I mean, I just -- I just really don't like the idea of you going alone.",
        "Katie: I'll be fine, I promise. I'll be careful. I'll wear my seat belt and take the elevator. And no side trips.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay.",
        "Katie: I'll just go straight to the hospital.",
        "Brad: Listen, I want you to text me, twitter me every step of the way. \"I'm getting in the car. I'm getting out of the car.\"",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, fine. But you got to go.",
        "Brad: No, you know what? No. This is a bad idea.",
        "Katie: You do not want Kim to give Geneva Swift any more airtime.",
        "Brad: Bite your tongue, all right? I want you to get back here in time to see the show, because today is the day that I cut Geneva Swift down to size.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: How? How could you compare me to Geneva Swift?",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry. Now will you please help me?",
        "Henry: What? With the pole dancing?",
        "Vienna: Well, unless you want me to fall flat on my butt on live TV.",
        "Henry: What do you want me to do?",
        "Vienna: Be a pole.",
        "Henry: Excuse me?",
        "Vienna: A pole dance requires a pole. And for some reason, the Lakeview doesn't provide a pole. So I need you to be a pole.",
        "Henry: I don't speak polish.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Vienna: Funny. Stand as straight as you can, and don't move.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: Now, how's that?",
        "Henry: There's, uh, just one problem.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: You're doing all the work.",
        "Vienna: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean poles have feelings, too. Solidarity forever.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Vienna: No. No, no, no, no, no. I can't. I got to go to work!",
        "Henry: Vienna, Vienna --",
        "Vienna: Okay, promise later. Love you!",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: This ends now!",

        "Parker: You ready?",
        "Sage: Yeah, come on.",
        "Craig: Uh, wait, wait, guys. Uh, before you kids leave, there's something that I want to talk to you about, okay?",
        "Sage: I'm supposed to meet Brittney.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and I got to go work.",
        "Carly: Okay. In a minute, all right?",
        "Parker: What is it?",
        "Carly: Will you give me a chance here, please?",
        "Parker: Who's stopping you?",
        "Carly: Parker, just zip it! You kids know that you mean the world to me. You and J.J., too, of course. And I would never want to do anything that would upset you or even make you uncomfortable in any way.",
        "Parker: Okay, got it. Let's go.",
        "Carly: No, Parker! I'm not through.",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Carly: Now, I know that change can be a scary thing, and you've been through a lot of change lately. But it can also be really positive.",
        "Parker: Just cut to the chase, Mom.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "[Carly laughs] Carly; Okay, well, here it goes. I --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sage: Hi, Daddy.",
        "Jack: Hey, baby. Mwah! I'm glad you guys are still here. Listen, I was wondering if you -- what's going on?",
        "Sage: Mommy's about to tell us that she's marrying Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Craig: Good morning, Mrs. Snyder. Is Jack here?",
        "Janet: You didn't see him at Carly's?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Janet: Oh, you guys must have just passed each other. Come on in.",
        "Craig: Oh, great.",
        "Janet: What's going on?",
        "Craig: Well, I had something to tell him, but I guess he's just gonna hear about it over there now.",
        "Janet: Hear what?",
        "Craig: Relax. It actually is good news.",
        "Janet: Really? That'd be nice for a change.",
        "Craig: Carly and I are engaged.",
        "Janet: Seriously?",
        "[Craig scoffs]",
        "Craig: I'm sure the word you meant to say was \"Congratulations.\"",
        "Janet: Well, I guess I should have seen it coming.",
        "Craig: Well, thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic. You know, this actually is good news.",
        "Janet: Maybe for you.",
        "Craig: For you, too! I know Jack's been very concerned about Carly. That had to put some sort of a strain on your marriage.",
        "Janet: Our marriage is not strained.",
        "Craig: Whatever you want to call it. I'm just saying Jack won't ever have to worry about her again, and now he can focus on you.",
        "Janet: Honey, if you think you marrying Carly is gonna make Jack worry less, you're crazy. But that's the least of your worries.",
        "Craig: Wow! I was really hoping you'd be a little more positive about it.",
        "Janet: Oh, sorry.",
        "[Janet clears throat]",
        "Janet: Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You are turning into such a comedienne. Everything okay?",
        "Carly: Did you see Craig?",
        "Jack: Where?",
        "Carly: At the farm. He -- he was headed out there to talk to you.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Parker: Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: What?!",
        "Parker: Sage is right.",
        "Sage: Of course I'm right. Everybody thinks I know nothing, but I know a lot.",

        "Carly: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: You're marrying him?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: And you sent him to tell me?",
        "Carly: No, no, no. He volunteered. He was gonna talk to you while I was talking to the kids, which I was just about to do.",
        "Jack: So you're getting married -- to Craig. For real this time?",
        "Carly: That's right.",

        "Jack: That's it.",
        "Sage: Daddy --",
        "Jack: Hey, this is your mother's decision. We've got to respect that, right?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes, you do. Thank you for that. And I think that having Craig and Johnny in our family will be very good for all of us.",
        "Sage: Are they gonna live here?",
        "Carly: That's something that we're gonna talk about. And you both are gonna be very involved in that conversation.",
        "Sage: Do you really love Craig the way you loved Daddy?",
        "Jack: Of course she does, Honey. Why else would she marry him?",
        "Carly: I know this is a surprise, and it's gonna take some getting used to. And that's okay. You know, you are totally entitled to your -- to your feelings and your opinions. If either of you want to talk to me about it, I'm right here, okay?",
        "Sage: Can we go now?",
        "Carly: Sure. Hey. Just give this a chance, okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Carly: That went well.",

        "Carly: Well, thank you for being so -- calm.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Is that why you sent Craig to tell me -- 'cause you thought I'd have a meltdown?",
        "Carly: I thought it was a possibility.",
        "Jack: I'm married, Carly. I'm married to someone else now. I have no right to tell you how to live your life.",
        "Carly: Even if that life is with Craig?",
        "Jack: Totally your call.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",

        "Henry: I waited until he left.",
        "Katie: You were watching the house?",
        "Henry: This is an emergency. I need you.",
        "Katie: What's wrong?",
        "Henry: I have to be at the studio like right now, and I cannot get my breasts straight.",
        "Katie: That has to be the weirdest thing any man's ever said to me.",
        "Henry: Are you gonna help me or not?",
        "Katie: With your breasts?",
        "Henry: And I've got a stuck zipper on the back, too.",
        "Katie: Let's start with that.",
        "Henry: All right.",
        "[Zipper creaks]",
        "Henry: Mm, God.",
        "Katie: Stop moving!",
        "Henry: I do not know how women dress themselves alone. I don't know how they do it.",
        "Katie: Well, a stuck zipper is the least of your problems. I really think you need to rethink this.",
        "Henry: Oh, God. I knew it. I knew it! This dress makes me look hippy, doesn't it?",
        "Katie: I mean this whole charade! You cannot let them make you a regular on \"Oakdale Now\"!",
        "Henry: Well, it's too late for that. I signed a contract.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Well, Kim insisted. She wanted to lock Geneva into \"Oakdale Now,\" so how could I refuse?",
        "Katie: You signed a contract as Geneva Swift?",
        "Henry: Of course.",
        "Katie: It can't be binding! She doesn't exist!",
        "Henry: Yeah, Katie, she does. She's right here.",
        "Katie: Oh, please. What are you gonna do if you get caught?",
        "Henry: I'm not gonna get caught. I'm just gonna keep this up until Geneva accomplishes her mission, and then she'll disappear.",
        "Katie: What mission?",
        "Henry: Getting Vienna to stop making a sexual spectacle of herself on TV.",
        "Katie: This is not fair to her.",
        "Henry: It's not fair? Really? Do you know what she's doing today? A pole dance.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Why do you think? To get a rise out of Brad and to provoke Geneva.",
        "Katie: No wonder Brad didn't want to go to work today.",
        "Geneva: Good for him. Good for him. He doesn't like this salacious act any more than we do.",
        "Katie: I still don't see how you becoming a drag queen stops this.",
        "Henry: I didn't do it on purpose! It just happened!",
        "Katie: Well, what if you \"Happened\" to make a mistake, and everybody finds out, and Brad wonders why I didn't tell him that you're making a fool out of everyone?",
        "Henry: He'll never know that you knew. I -- I'm the only one that knows, and I'll never tell him. We girls have to stick together. How do I look? Aah!",
        "Katie: Fine.",
        "Henry: Not too hippy?",
        "Katie: Would you just get out of here? And be careful, please!",
        "Henry: I will. Thank you.",
        "Katie: Sure. What are best girlfriends for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Take that down to editing, would you? Thanks.",
        "Vienna: So, Geneva's still not here?",
        "Kim: No.",
        "Brad: That's what you get for hiring an amateur.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kim: Thank you for the reminder.",
        "Vienna: Okay, so I have time to practice my pole dance?",
        "Kim: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Brad: Yes! I think that's a very good idea. Are you supposed to hug it?",

        "Henry: Well, we may have our differences, but we're still colleagues!",
        "Kim: Uh, you didn't happen to see Vienna's boyfriend downstairs anywhere, did you?",
        "Henry: No, can't say that I did. Well, now, you get better just as fast as you can, and I'll see you real soon. Okay, I got to go.",
        "Kim: I'll be back. Uh, Geneva? I just wanted to tell you what a good job you did on today's show.",
        "Henry: Oh, you're too kind.",
        "Kim: Unfortunately, you know, Vienna's not gonna be able to do the show for a while.",
        "Henry: How unfortunate.",
        "Kim: Well, yes, it is. I just suddenly wondered how you would feel about being her replacement.",
        "Henry: You mean?",
        "Kim: Well, Brad's co-host.",
        "Henry: Well, how will he feel about that?",
        "Kim: Well, he certainly knows you two have great chemistry. Would also be a shot in the arm for the show, which we all want.",
        "Henry: Well, if you're sure.",
        "Kim: Oh, I'm positive. I've been in this business a long time. I know star power when I see it.",
        "Henry: That -- that's very flattering.",
        "Kim: Good. We'll see you tomorrow then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I just can't believe what a pain in the ass that woman is! I mean, literally, I bruised my tailbone, along with other parts of my body, all because of her! Did I mention to you that she is ugly. Like ugly, ugly.",
        "Katie: Several. Yeah, several times.",
        "Brad: I mean, I just can't believe that they would -- they would let that hideous woman sit in your chair!",
        "Katie: Well, I think that Kim will eventually realize how crazy it is!",
        "Brad: Oh, I don't know. I -- I don't know. She looked psyched.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Would you get me a cup of tea while I take this call, please?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Katie: Where the hell are you?!",
        "Henry: Home. Listen, you are never going to believe to this, but Kim wants me to replace Vienna until she's back up on her feet.",
        "Katie: You? The co-hosts are supposed to be a man and a woman.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. Not Henry. Geneva. She -- she thinks I'd be a good female counterpoint to Brad.",
        "Katie: But you're not a female. I hope you said no.",
        "Henry: I said yes.",
        "Katie: This is insane!",
        "Henry: Listen, Sweetheart, don't worry about it, okay? As soon as you're up and running, the chair will be right there for you.",
        "Katie: That is not what I'm worried about.",
        "Henry: Well, if it's about the show, I can do it.",
        "Katie: I'm worried about you, Henry.",
        "Henry: Sorry, Honey. I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Janet, can I ask you something?",
        "Janet: Uh, sure.",
        "Parker: Do you believe me about my mom?",
        "Janet: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Parker: I -- I know you don't exactly trust me.",
        "Janet: Well, that depends on the circumstances, Parker. I know you're not a liar.",
        "Parker: What's gonna happen to my mom?",
        "Janet: Don't you worry about a thing, okay? Your dad's not gonna let anything happen to you kids.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but what about her? I mean, she doesn't have Dad to protect her anymore.",
        "Janet: Well, she has Craig.",
        "Parker: You really think Craig can take care of her the way that he did?",
        "Janet: Well, I'm prejudiced. I happen to love your father. But I know that Craig is gonna do the best he can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm starting to figure out how this all works. You say you want to marry Carly 'cause the two of you bring out the best in each other? Now, to me, that translates into Carly lying and you covering for her, Craig.",
        "Craig: What are you talking about?",
        "Jack: You're not doing her any favors. You know that?",
        "Carly: What is this about, Jack?",
        "Jack: I know you were drinking today.",
        "Carly: No, I wasn't.",
        "Jack: Parker told me you were.",
        "Carly: He said that?",
        "Jack: Is it true?",
        "Craig: Of course it's not true. Parker's upset about our engagement. He's lashing out. That's all.",
        "Jack: Carly, were you drinking, or weren't you?",
        "Carly: Of course not.",
        "Jack: So Parker's the liar?",
        "[Carly scoffs]",
        "Carly: I wasn't drinking! Tell me you believe me.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Carly: You still think I'm drinking, don't you?",
        "Craig: I want you to move in. Your sister needs you.",
        "Casey: The real Riley Morgan is dead. The guy who's living with us -- I don't know who he is, but he's a fake.",
        "Riley: Knowing them, they know the truth about me. I'm sure Casey went to the cops! I got to get out of here before --",
