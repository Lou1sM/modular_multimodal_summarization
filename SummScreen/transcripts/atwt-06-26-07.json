        "Maddie: Hey. Hey, where's Gwen?",

        "Will: I heard you're coming with us. I'm glad about that.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Will: Did you tell Casey about it? 'Cause I was thinking we could make him, like, a videotape or something. He was Gwen's first big fan so -- he'd like that. What's wrong?",
        "Maddie: I definitely think that you should make a tape for Casey. He would really like it.",
        "Will: Yeah, but what's wrong?",
        "Maddie: When he gets out -- Casey's not coming back to Oakdale.",
        "Will: Why? Where are you guys going?",

        "Will: Maddie, I'm sorry --",
        "Maddie: I wanted you to know. So -- okay. That's out of the way. Let's talk about something else, please.",
        "Will: Okay, fine. But before we talk about anything else, I just want to say that he's an idiot.",

        "Will: Well, she likes busy. That's good.",
        "Noah: That is good. I hope Cleo feels the same way.",
        "Will: Why wouldn't she?",
        "Noah: Well, because, as Gwen's assistant, she's going to be handling all the scheduling and traveling and arrangements and stuff. It's going to be her job.",
        "Will: That's going to be Cleo's job?",
        "Noah: Yeah. She must be pretty organized, right? Or Gwen wouldn't have picked her.",

        "Maddie: Right, but she has a job now. So she's --",
        "Will: Maddie, she's a maid at the Lakeview. She does the same thing over and over, she doesn't make any of her own decisions.",
        "Noah: I just got another interview. A local radio show.",

        "Maddie: Oh, no, no, no. I can do it. You're busy with the scheduling and everything.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but I was about to hand the scheduling all over to Cleo. You know, so she can kind of get her feet wet and see what it's going to be like when we get down there.",

        "Will: Well, does it bother any of you that this is the girl that crossed the country to dress up and act like someone that she heard sing once?",
        "Noah: I sense a lack of confidence here.",
        "Will: Right, and now you're talking about her doing scheduling stuff. I mean, have you ever tried to have a conversation with her?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, it's not exactly a straight line. And --",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Maddie: Well, she's a little on the emotional side. I mean, I was over there today, and I needed to talk to Gwen about something, and she asked Cleo if she didn't mind leaving and -- Cleo tried to cover, but she -- you could tell her feelings were really hurt.",
        "Will: Well, that's not good.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Noah: Well, do you think we should let her go?",
        "Will: No. It would kill her. And besides, she was the one who got Gwen to finish the CD. So, she kind of earned this.",
        "Noah: So, you're just pointing out that this is going to be a disaster but won't let us do anything about it?",
        "Will: No, no. I didn't say that. You know what? I'll try and help her out and I'll back her up.",
        "Noah: Well, you could start by reminding her to show up when she's supposed to.",
        "Will: Let me just tell you one more thing before you start working with her. The more you yell at her, the more Cleo-y she gets. I'm going to go and see what's keeping her, see if her feelings are still hurt.",
        "Maddie: That's very sweet of you, looking out for her.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, Gwen and I wanted to spend some time together in Branson. I don't think that's going to happen with her new assistant managing things. That's just what I wanted, a little more one-on-one with Cleo.",

        "Jade: You're right, it's not funny, Cleo. It's pathetic! \"I realize I must do whatever it takes to destroy that marriage. W is too fine a person to love me while he's married to somebody else.\" Wow, that's some creative writing style you got there, Cleo. I got to admit, though, you're not so flowery when you talk about me. \"I'm going to get rid of J for good.\" I wonder how you were planning on doing that.",
        "Cleo: I wasn't. I just make up stories.",

        "Jade: Oh, yes, I can. But in fact, Cleo, that's really up to you. If you get on the bus, I'll give you back your little book. And if you don't, Gwen and Will are going to get the number one pick from Jade's book club.",

        "Lucinda: Yes, we do. Because Craig's up there, alone -- alone with the police. And we know what he's doing. He's giving his own version of what happened. We know what that is. It's a litany of self-serving lies.",
        "Meg: That doesn't matter. Paul matters.",
        "Lucinda: Of course Paul matters. But what Craig did matters, too. This was planned. This was premeditated. He drugged you, he lured Paul. He wanted Paul dead, and he wanted you his prisoner. We cannot let him get away with that.",

        "Holden: No, he kidnapped her. He took her someplace against her will.",

        "Holden: I don't care what you call it, but I don't trust the guy, and I want to find her. I want to talk to her. So if you can't tackle it officially, what I need you to do is give me the name of a P.I. that you trust.",

        "Jack: We do.",
        "Holden: So, Carly showed up -- it must have provided a few awkward moments.",
        "Jack: A few, but Katie and I, we're doing okay.",
        "Holden: Well, good. I wish you the best.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Holden: Does Carly wish you the best?",

        "Jade: Okay, fine, throw the past in my face, I understand that. But what I don't understand is why you won't just look for the diary to see what I'm talking about! That's all I'm asking you to do.",

        "Meg: That's all that matters to you, isn't it? It's not Paul. It's revenge.",

        "Jade: You little witch! Where's the diary?!",

        "Jack: Yeah, I understand. With Carly, nothing's ever really simple.",
        "Holden: Lily's vulnerable right now. When she got addicted to those pills, she became somebody that I didn't recognize. Lying to me, to the kids, to herself. I don't want her to go back to that. She might, if she gets under too much pressure.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why don't you tell her how you feel?",

He was so happy. Then it hit me -- when we're together -- when he and I are together, and we're with the kids -- I'm home. And I don't ever want to leave home again.",
