        "Noah: Hey, perfect timing. I'm almost ready.",
        "Luke: Did you get your schedule cleared so we could go to Fort Leonard Wood?",
        "Noah: I am all set. But I'm still not sure you should go with me, though.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Noah: You know why. You haven't been cleared yet.",
        "Luke: Oh, you worry too much. You don't need those rules.",
        "Noah: And you don't know anything about the military. Going against regulations is not something they take too lightly.",
        "Luke: Yeah? What are they gonna do? Lock me in the brig?",
        "Noah: Not if I can help it.",
        "Riley: Hey, guys.",
        "Noah: Hey, Riley. You wore the uniform. Will you tell him about the chain of command?",
        "Riley: Why? What's going on?",
        "Noah: Well, Luke thinks he can just get onto the base without permission to help me shoot my film.",
        "Riley: I thought the deal was you were gonna go alone?",
        "Noah: Well, that's true. But I'm not gonna do it without Luke. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, if he can't come, I'm not gonna use the footage at all.",
        "Luke: No, Noah. This is too important. You have a lot of history with that base, as does your father. So you're gonna go, you're gonna film there, and I'm gonna be right there with you, I promise.",
        "Riley: Look, guys, I really don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Luke: Well, then come up with another idea, because we're gonna film this movie.",
        "Riley: Let me talk to Hasbro, see what I can do.",
        "Luke: Okay. And -- and we'll get packed. We'd like to start filming today.",
        "Noah: Mm.",
        "Riley: Just do me a favor and wait till you hear from me.",
        "Luke: See? Problem solved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Margo: Hello. Um, why? W -- what kind of information? Well, uh, no. Casey Hughes isn't here right now. Can I take a message? Okay. I will -- I will have him call you back.",
        "Casey: Who was on the phone, Mom?",
        "Margo: Uh, that was the Veterans Administration. They said they, uh, have no information for you.",
        "Casey: Great. I got to go.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no, no. Not until you tell me what you were up to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Tell him you believe me, Craig. I haven't been drinking. P -- Parker saw me drinking seltzer water, and he jumped to the wrong conclusion.",
        "Craig: Okay, but you can see why he was worried?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't see why you would be. I expect Jack to be suspicious, but not you.",
        "Craig: I never said I was suspicious.",
        "Carly: That doesn't sound very convincing. And if the man I'm planning to marry doesn't believe me, then we have a serious problem, haven't we?",
        "Jack: So what are you saying, Carly? That now that you two are engaged, Craig should lie for you? That's called \"Enabling.\"",
        "Craig: Look, we don't need life lessons from you. I understand what she's saying. And I'm in a much better position to know what's going on here than you are.",
        "Jack: Then you know she's drinking?",
        "Craig: No! Actually, I don't know that! She told me she hasn't been drinking, and I believe her. Frankly, you have no right to come in here and make baseless accusations?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I can't help worrying about my mom. I wish I knew what was going on.",
        "Janet: Hey, your dad's gonna get to the bottom of this, okay? Don't worry.",
        "Parker: I didn't want to get her into trouble, but I had to tell my dad that she started drinking again.",
        "Janet: You did the right thing. These things have a way of working themselves out.",
        "Parker: Things don't work out for my mom. That's the problem.",
        "Rosanna: Hey! Parker! You okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker told me he saw his mother drinking. He's worried about her.",
        "Craig: Well, I think there's more to it than that. Parker isn't exactly thrilled about Carly and me getting married. I think he might say anything to keep it from happening.",
        "Jack: Don't put this on Parker. This is about Carly. She's in major denial, and she wants everyone else to join the party, Craig.",
        "Craig: No. This is about you interfering where you don't belong.",
        "Jack: I am here because my children live under this roof, and I have an obligation to them.",
        "Craig: Carly loves those kids just as much as you do! She'd never do anything to hurt them!",
        "Jack: Not intentionally, no.",
        "Carly: Craig just told you what the problem is, Jack. Parker's upset about our engagement. Remember how Sage flipped out when you got engaged to Janet? It's the same thing.",
        "Jack: No, it's not, Carly. Parker is not a child. He knows what's going on.",
        "Craig: Parker is an angry teenager, and we all know what that means. He's a great kid, but he has some problems.",
        "Jack: Is that how you want to play this? You want to make Parker out to look like a liar to cover your drinking?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I have admitted that I had a drinking problem, but it's over. And if Parker doesn't trust that, he should, because there is not a drop of alcohol in this house. And if you don't believe me, look for yourself.",
        "Jack: All right. I will.",
        "Craig: That's enough. You want to act like a cop, that's fine, Jack. You can get a search warrant, and we'll get a lawyer.",
        "Jack: Carly has a problem. You're not helping, Craig.",
        "Craig: Actually, I'm helping a lot. Now I'm warning you to back off. It's not your place to keep badgering Carly.",
        "Jack: I don't see anyone taking responsibility here. But as long as my kids are here, I'll be watching out. I will do whatever I have to to make sure they don't get hurt, Craig.",
        "Carly: Thank you for standing up for me. I can't tell you how much it means to me.",
        "Craig: I always have your back, Carly.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Probably spend the rest of my life proving that.",
        "Carly: You proved it the minute you asked me to marry you. You made me so happy. And you know what? I don't even want to wait. Let's just do it. Let's just get married right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: So, what's going on? Why are you so upset?",
        "Parker: Just a lousy day. Hate my job.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Well, at least you have one.",
        "Parker: You haven't been coming around that much.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I know. I am sorry. I would have come by sooner. It's just --",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: I've had so many things up in the air.",
        "Parker: Since you lost all your money.",
        "Rosanna: I have just been taking it one step at a time, you know? Get a job first, an income. Then I'll get an apartment, and it'll be fine.",
        "Parker: Well, I could give you my trust fund back, I -- I mean if you need it.",
        "Rosanna: No way! That money is for your future. There's no way I'm taking it, okay?",
        "Parker: Seriously?",
        "Rosanna: Seriously. Money doesn't buy happiness, Parker.",
        "Parker: Really sucks not having it, though.",
        "Rosanna: Tell me about what's going on at home. How are things with your mom? Can't be that happy that she's marrying Craig. Or are you?",
        "Parker: I mean, you can't be too happy about it, either. He's done some pretty bad stuff to you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Well, I'm just trying to put the past in the past, you know? It's, uh, your mom's life. If it's what makes her happy, then I can't stand in her way.",
        "Parker: But you don't like it.",
        "Rosanna: It's her decision, okay? I just have to make peace with it. And apparently, so do you.",
        "[Parker chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: So listen, I got to go. I have a -- a job appointment, and I can't be late. Going to be interviewing for the managerial position at the Wagon Wheel.",
        "Parker: The Wagon Wheel?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, I know. It's very exciting. It's quite a dump.",
        "Parker: Kind of.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Parker: Yes, I know.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Parker: Can't see you working there.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you got to take what you can get, kid. Listen, let's get together soon, okay?",
        "Parker: Definitely. Uh, lunch? My treat.",
        "Rosanna: Great, great. Well, you don't have to pay. That's --",
        "Parker: Oh, I -- I make some pretty good tips. And -- and I figure I owe you.",
        "Rosanna: All right. I love you.",
        "Parker: I love you, too.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I'll see you soon.",
        "Parker: All right.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Janet: How did it go?",
        "Parker: I think I just made a really big mistake.",
        "Janet: What kind of mistake?",
        "Parker: I didn't tell her what's going on with my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I thought you'd be happy to move up the wedding.",
        "Craig: But we agreed on a long engagement so the kids could get used to the idea of me as their stepfather.",
        "Carly: I -- I know that I said that. But Sage is very mature for her age, and Parker doesn't seem to have a problem with it. And we're already committed to each other, aren't we?",
        "Craig: Yes, but there's no rush.",
        "Carly: You sound like you're having second thoughts.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Carly: Then why are you giving me the runaround? If you don't want us to be married, then just say so.",
        "Craig: Of course I want us to be married. Just not right away.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Craig: Because we have to think of the kids.",
        "Carly: This isn't about the kids, is it? This is about me. You don't believe me any more than Jack does, do you? You still think I'm drinking, don't you?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey, will you stop stalling? Why did you call the V.A. about Riley?",
        "Casey: I was just checking up on him.",
        "Margo: That wasn't necessary.",
        "Casey: All we know about this guy is what he told us, and I don't trust him.",
        "Margo: Don't you think that should be the other way around? Shouldn't it be he that doesn't trust you? I mean, after all, you stole his watch. You lied about it. You tried to get him to leave the house.",
        "Casey: Yes, I admit I was wrong, but it doesn't mean Riley's on the up and up.",
        "Margo: But you can't prove it, and the V.A. isn't gonna help you.",
        "Casey: Then I'll find some other way.",
        "Margo: Casey, I want you to drop this now.",
        "Casey: Why are you so bent out of shape about this? Like what are you afraid you're gonna find out?",
        "Margo: There's nothing to find out. End of story.",
        "Casey: I don't get you, Mom. What if there's a 1% chance that there's something weird going on with Riley? Don't you want to know?",
        "Margo: No. Quite honestly, I don't.",
        "Casey: Come on! You're a cop, for God's sake! Since when are you afraid to find the truth out about someone?",
        "Margo: The truth?! I know the truth! I know that Riley is a fine, decent young man. That's what I know. And I believe what he's told us about himself, and I believe what he's told us about Adam.",
        "Casey: Okay, what -- what do you know about this guy, mom, huh? You act like you know his life's story. But guess what? All you know is what he's told you. Which means there's probably a lot he doesn't want you to know.",
        "Margo: I know that you don't like him, and you want to find a way to justify that. So you decided that he's hiding something. Well, he's not. And that's the end of it, Casey! Let it go. I'm gonna get back to work. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Look, his mind is made up. Luke is determined on joining Noah at the army base.",
        "Winston: That is not acceptable. Tell him again that he needs clearance and he won't get it.",
        "Riley: I did, but he's not backing down! The two of them are coming together no matter what I say!",
        "Winston: That is not an option! Now, if you -- you listen to me, you little -- if you don't want your identity exposed, you will find a way to get Noah here by himself! Do I make myself clear?",
        "Riley: Yes, Sir.",
        "Winston: Now, I can call Margo Hughes right now and tell her all about you, or you can call my son Noah and get this plan back on track. It's your choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I'm just gonna get my overnight bag, and bring it back.",
        "Noah: Cool. Luke -- are you sure you want to go through with this?",
        "Luke: I want to do what's right for you, and you need to make this movie.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Noah: Hello.",
        "Riley: Noah, hey, it's Riley. Listen, I think I may have found a way to get Luke the clearance he needs.",
        "Noah: Are you serious?! That's great!",
        "Riley: But you're gonna have to talk to Lieutenant Hasbro alone first, just to do a background check, talk to him about the movie, tell him what you'll need.",
        "Noah: That's cool. No problem.",
        "Riley: Good. I'll set it up.",
        "Noah: Thank you so much, Riley.",
        "Luke: Who was that?",
        "Noah: That was Riley. He thinks he might be able to get you a pass onto the base. All I've got to do is talk to Lieutenant Hasbro first alone.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Noah: Uh, he wanted to go over details, you know, like where we're gonna be shooting and for how long, stuff like that.",
        "Luke: Why can't I be there for that?",
        "Noah: Does it really matter?",
        "Luke: I don't know. I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this, Noah. I don't want you to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I should have known better than to think you'd be on my side.",
        "Craig: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: Why should you be any different than Jack?!",
        "Craig: Oh, hold on just a minute. I am nothing like your ex-husband, and you know that.",
        "Carly: No, I don't. You're both suspicious. Neither of you trusts me.",
        "Craig: I have been nothing but supportive of you, and I do trust you. You told me you haven't been drinking, and I believed you.",
        "Carly: Then what's the problem?!",
        "Craig: I think it's great that you quit drinking, and I know it hasn't been easy. But I think you should just avoid the stress for a while.",
        "Carly: You don't think I'm strong enough to stay on the wagon. Is that it?",
        "Craig: I think it's tough to quit any habit, especially the bad ones. And when too much tension starts to pile up, people that have given up a habit are tempted to relapse. I think it's best if you just try to avoid the pressure for a while.",
        "Carly: I thought getting married would relieve pressure, not add more.",
        "Craig: I'm just trying to think of what's best for you, Carly.",
        "Carly: What's best for me is not having people second-guess me all the time!",
        "Craig: Then how about trying to avoid the pitfalls?",
        "Carly: The bottom line here is that you don't trust me. And I have enough suspicion coming at me from Jack and from Parker. I don't need any more. So you know what? Let's just forget about moving up the wedding! In fact, let's forget about the wedding altogether! I'm much better off alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Should I have told Aunt Rosanna that my mom started drinking again?",
        "Janet: Sweetie, whether you say anything or not, the people who are close to Carly are gonna find out. If she's fallen off the wagon, she's not gonna be able to hide it.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but Rosanna's her sister. Maybe -- maybe she could say something or do something.",
        "Janet: The only person who can do anything about this is your mother. Take a little pressure off yourself. Parker, you can't fix everything.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Parker: Hey, hey. D -- Dad, what happened? Did you talk to Mom? Is she okay?",
        "Jack: I told your mom you saw her drinking. She denied the whole thing.",
        "Janet: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: She was very defensive.",
        "Parker: I was afraid of that.",
        "Jack: Craig was no help. He pretty much backed her up.",
        "Janet: He did?",
        "Jack: He swears Carly stopped drinking.",
        "Janet: You don't believe him?",
        "Jack: No, I don't.",
        "Parker: So he said I was lying?",
        "Jack: He said you might be making the whole thing up because you don't want the two of them to get married.",
        "Parker: That's bull! Dad, I was telling the truth! I saw her!",
        "Jack: I believe you, Parker. I believe you. Obviously, Craig is covering for her.",
        "Janet: Well, you don't know that for sure. Maybe Craig doesn't even know the truth. Maybe no one is hiding anything except Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Would you just listen to me for a second. 'Cause you've got this all wrong.",
        "Carly: Of course I'm always wrong. Just ask Jack.",
        "Craig: All right, stop it. There's nothing I want more than to get married to you. And if you want to go to the courthouse and tie the knot right now, fine. Let's go. Seriously, I -- I don't want to argue with you. So can we talk about this, please?",
        "Carly: All right. What is it you want to say?",
        "Craig: First of all, you have to know that I am on your side, always. As long as I'm with you, I have what I need to be happy. If it makes you happy to move up the wedding, then fine. I'm in.",
        "Carly: Do you mean that?",
        "Craig: I do.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Whenever you want to say I do, I'm there.",
        "Carly: All right.",
        "Craig: Do you want to get out a calendar? We'll pick out a date.",
        "Carly: No. We -- we don't have to do that right now. We can do it some other time.",
        "Craig: Well, then, what about a wedding planner? I mean, that can take off some of the pressure.",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: I can -- I can handle it myself. Trust me.",
        "Craig: As long as I know that you'll be Mrs. Craig Montgomery, I have everything I need.",
        "Carly: Everything?",
        "Craig: Just tell me the wedding's still officially on.",
        "Carly: It's on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Veterans Administration.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Winston: Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?",
        "Riley: When Noah gets here and finds out you're alive, what are you going to do?",
        "Winston: That's classified information. You work on a need-to-know basis, remember that.",
        "Riley: I will.",
        "Winston: I need to see my son. I need to see him alone. Now go get him and bring him here. And don't mess this up, or you'll regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I just don't know why you have to go talk to Lieutenant Hasbro by yourself. Kind of creeps me out.",
        "Noah: I'm gonna be in a military base. There's gonna be tons of people. I'll be perfectly safe.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Noah: Luke, if we can't get a pass like this onto the base through Riley, we'll go back to plan \"A.\" Okay? Cool?",
        "Luke: Okay, cool.",
        "Casey: Guys, I told you there's something weird about Riley.",
        "Noah: Whoa. Casey, what happened?",
        "Casey: I got in contact with the veterans administration in D.C. I had to jump through all these hoops, sign forms and stuff. But I got what I was looking for.",
        "Casey: \"Dear Mr. Hughes, we regret to inform you that the service member you inquired about, Sergeant Riley Morgan --\"",
        "Noah: \"-- Was killed in an explosion in Kabul, Afghanistan\"? Well, there's got to be a mistake.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I mean, Riley's alive.",
        "Casey: No, but it's not Riley. Look, I got this picture with the letter.",
        "Luke: Wait, wait, wait. If this is Riley, then who the hell is the guy living at your house, pretending to be your dead brother's friend?",
        "Casey: That's what I'm here to find out. I don't know who this guy is pretending to be Riley Morgan, but obviously he's trying to scam my mom.",
        "Noah: Why?!",
        "Casey: I don't know. Maybe he actually knew Adam in Afghanistan, and when he died, he thought he could move in on his family. But, of course, he needed a fake identity, so he found the first dead guy he could find, and it was Riley Morgan.",

        "Noah: I mean, if he's a con artist, why is he going after your parents? It's not like they're multimillionaires.",
        "Casey: Maybe he has something against my mom. Maybe she sent someone away to jail that he knew.",
        "Noah: Why is he helping us? Why is he bending over backwards to get you a pass onto the base? What's up with that?",
        "Luke: I don't know. But I don't want you going anywhere with that guy.",
        "Casey: Yes, Luke's right. You got to stay away from Riley.",
        "Noah: Casey, it's your family I'm worried about. What are you gonna do?",
        "Casey: I'm -- I'm gonna go straight to my mom with this. But she's -- she's not gonna be happy. I was hoping you guys could come with me and just give me some backup.",

        "Rosanna: Are you pressuring her?",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: No, no. Actually, it's her idea. She said she'd rather do it sooner than later.",

        "Craig: I think I'd marry Carly anytime.",
        "Rosanna: Bully for you.",
        "Craig: Well, the point is, she's been through an awful lot in the last few months, and she could really use your support.",
        "Rosanna: I've already given my approval, Craig. What more do you want?",
        "Craig: More to the point, she could really use your help -- bringing the kids on board, planning a wedding, dealing with Jack.",
        "Rosanna: What do you want from me, Craig?",

        "Jack: It doesn't matter what I know. If Carly's drinking, there's not a lot I can do about it.",
        "Janet: That's true. It's not your place. I was just telling Parker that the only one who can do anything about this is Carly, hopefully with Craig's help.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Parker: It scares me to see Mom like this.",
        "Jack: I know, buddy.",
        "Parker: If she decides to get behind the wheel again, I'm afraid she's gonna do something terrible.",
        "Jack: Okay. What do you want to do?",
        "Parker: I wish I could make her tell the truth, but I can't.",
        "Jack: No. Janet's right. It's not your job to try and fix this. But if you don't feel comfortable staying at that house, you can always move out to the farm.",
        "Parker: I -- I can't leave Sage with mom.",
        "Jack: No, I know that. I wouldn't move you out there without moving her out there. There's plenty of room.",
        "Parker: I don't know. I mean, moving out on Mom's a pretty big step.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Parker: And I don't want to do anything to make things worse for her.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Why don't you think about it? Take tonight, think about it. Talk to your sister. See how she feels, okay?",
        "Parker: Okay. Um, Janet, my shift's over. I think I'm gonna take off.",

        "Rosanna: You're right. I'm broke, thanks to you.",
        "Craig: I know you're never gonna forgive me for that, and for many other things. But it really isn't fair to make Carly suffer for my mistakes.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my goodness. Don't make me sit here and listen to you lecture me on the subject of fairness.",
        "Craig: All I'm saying is that the reason you wouldn't stay with her in the first place is because you didn't want to see me.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, you're right. And that hasn't changed.",
        "Craig: But it has to, sooner or later, once we get married. Oh, come on! You might as well get a jump on things.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my g -- you know, I would -- I would do anything to help Carly. But I don't -- I don't understand. I mean, I can't imagine that you would want me around morning, noon, and night.",
        "Craig: But if it makes Carly happy, and it will, then I'm all for it.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I -- why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?",
        "Craig: The point is we both want what's best for Carly right now. And I have to say, this would certainly benefit the both of you.",
        "Rosanna: I'm willing, okay? I'm -- I'm willing. But I'll only do it if it's what Carly wants.",

        "Rosanna: No, I'm -- I'm really fine. Thank you. Um, actually, I came here to talk to you about something.",
        "Carly: It sounds like it could be serious. What's up?",
        "Rosanna: Um, well, you know, I -- I moved from Fairwinds into the Lakeview.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. I mean, good that you -- you moved away from Paul. Things seemed a little bit tense when -- when we were there.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Craig -- he kind of brings out the -- worst in almost everybody.",

        "Rosanna: Except for some people. Um, but you're right. I needed to move.",
        "Carly: How can you afford the Lakeview?",
        "Rosanna: I can't. Um, I just interviewed for a job at the Wagon Wheel as a manager, but it doesn't really pay that much. So I was wondering if your offer to stay here with you is still good.",
        "Carly: Yes. Of course it is.",
        "Rosanna: If it's a problem --",
        "Carly: It's not! No, there's no problem at all. It's just Craig and I, um -- we're gonna move up the wedding.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I know. He told me.",
        "Carly: When did you talk to Craig?",
        "Rosanna: I saw him at the Lakeview.",

        "Janet: There you go. Thank you. I understand that you're worried about the kids being in the house with Carly, especially if she is drinking. But I'm worried about my kid, too! Liberty and Parker at the farm together? Uhh-uh. Not gonna work. And I really wish you would have discussed it with me first before you made that offer to Parker.",
        "Jack: You're right. I'm sorry. I should have.",
        "Janet: Okay. Thank you. I just want to make sure we're on the same page.",
        "Jack: No, I understand that, and we should -- and we should be. It's just that I'm so damn worried about my kids, all I can think about is getting them out of there.",
        "Janet: Okay, but think about the bigger picture here. Once Craig and Carly get married and he moves into the house with her, things could get better, you know? I mean, he could be just what she needs there.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: I doubt it.",
        "Janet: All right. I don't want to fight with you, Jack. But it's a possibility that there is someone out there who could be good for Carly besides yourself. So let's give Craig a chance to be that person.",

        "Craig: Hey. Parker.",
        "Parker: Are those for my mom?",

        "Parker: No thanks. Go ahead.",
        "Craig: I know you're worried about your mom, but you really shouldn't be.",
        "Parker: Really? Why not? 'Cause if she started drinking again, Craig --",
        "Craig: You know what? I've got that all taken care of. I've convinced your Aunt Rosanna to move in for a while. That way you and Sage will have another adult in the house -- someone to keep an eye on things.",
        "Parker: And how'd you get her to go along with that? I mean, she hates your guts.",
        "Craig: But she loves your mother. She's family.",
        "Parker: So does this mean that you knew I wasn't lying? I saw my mom drinking, Craig.",
        "Craig: You know, whatever's happened in the past doesn't matter. I think it's really good that your aunt's gonna move in. It'll give your mom the kind of support she needs. Hey, you need a ride home?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Um, can I put my bike in your car?",
        "Craig: Sure, sure. I'm right around the corner. There you go.",

        "Winston: Damn it! Where the hell are you? You should have had Noah here by now. I guess we're just gonna have to do this the hard way, though, huh?",
        "Casey: Riley's obviously not who he says he is. So what are we gonna do?",
        "Margo: Who else have you told about this?",
        "Casey: No one. Just -- just Luke and Noah. I got the letter. I came straight here. But now that we have evidence, can you do something? Can -- can we arrest him?",
        "Margo: I will handle this. You three stay here. That's an order.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Winston: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Riley: I can't help you, not anymore. Noah and them -- they know the truth about me. I'm sure Casey went to the cops! I got to get out of here before --",
        "Winston: No. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Jack: I think I have a right to be concerned, Janet.",
        "Janet: Of course you do. And obviously, if the kids are in real danger, Sage and Parker could come stay with us. But I don't think we're there yet.",
        "Jack: We could be soon.",
        "Janet: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. And I guess, you know, I could have liberty go stay with Brad and Katie again. It's just been so nice having her with me.",
        "Jack: No, I know, I know. And I don't want her to feel like she's being chased away.",
        "Janet: So what are we gonna do?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I wish I knew.",
        "Craig: Sorry to interrupt. Parker's in the car. I'll drive him back to Carly's.",
        "Jack: I could have done that.",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Carly: I just wanted you to know that Carly and I have decided to move up the wedding. Rosanna's moving in for the time being. Give her a hand, help her stay centered.",
        "Jack: Was that your idea?",
        "Craig: Yes, it was, as a matter of fact. I think it'll be good for Carly to have a houseful of people. She's tempted to drink, she'll have all the support she needs.",
        "Jack: I think Rosanna moving in is a great idea, Craig.",
        "Craig: I agree. And I told Parker. He feels better about the whole situation.",
        "Janet: Thank you for letting us know.",
        "Craig: You're welcome. Excuse me. I need to get these to Carly.",
        "Janet: See?! Maybe things have a way of working themselves out after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You can move in as soon as you want.",
        "Rosanna: I wouldn't mind getting out of the Lakeview tonight. Are you sure that's okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course. And we'll try to give you your privacy, which can be difficult with the kids.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't worry about it. It'll be great to be part of the family, you know?",
        "Carly: Oh, hey, Parker. Craig. I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Craig: You probably weren't expecting these, either, but they're yours anyway.",
        "Carly: Oh -- thank you.",
        "Rosanna: They're beautiful.",
        "Parker: Aunt Rosanna, I -- I heard you're moving in. That's cool.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. I -- I hope you don't mind.",
        "Parker: No, not at all.",
        "Rosanna: You're gonna be surrounded by women.",
        "Craig: No, not for long. Once we get hitched, I'll be moving in, and Parker here will have some reinforcements.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, great. Um, I think I should get to the Lakeview and pack up my stuff.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Parker: Why don't I drive you over and help you get your suitcases and things?",
        "Rosanna: That would be great. Thank you.",
        "Parker: Mom, is that okay?",
        "Carly: Yes, of course. Absolutely. My keys are right there.",
        "Rosanna: All right. We'll see you soon.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Great. Bye.",
        "Craig: Well, looks like everything turned out all right.",
        "Carly: You arranged for Rosanna to move in here, didn't you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know why Craig is having Rosanna move in there, don't you?",
        "Janet: Because it will make her happy.",
        "Jack: Partially. But I also think it means I was right. Carly's drinking again, and Craig knows it. That's why he wants Rosanna there.",
        "Janet: Well, even if that's true, it means that Craig has found a way to take care of her. Which is his job from now on, not yours.",
        "Jack: Just hope he knows what he's doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I -- I'm confused. First you're upset that Rosanna won't move in here because she doesn't want to see me, so I take care of that problem, and you're still upset.",
        "Carly: I'm not upset. I'm curious.",
        "Craig: I was hoping you'd be pleased.",
        "Carly: I am.",
        "Craig: Good. Because I love you. I want you to be happy. Are we okay now?",

        "Carly: The sooner the better.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, that doesn't give me much time to put together your dream wedding. But I'm sure Rosanna will be a big help.",
        "Carly: Yes, I'm sure she will be. And she'll be back here soon, and I'm gonna want some time with her to design my dress, which you cannot see till our wedding day. So goodbye.",
        "Craig: Yeah, okay. Fine.",
