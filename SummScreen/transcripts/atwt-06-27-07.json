        "Jade threatens Will when he wants to call the police. She just wants him to look for Cleo's journal. Cleo plays on Will's emotions. Allison tells Emily that Aaron left town after she told him that they have no future. They can't have a future after what she has done. However, Aaron is busy trying to get a job bartending at the Lakeview. Aaron and Dusty meet up happily. Lucinda tries to convince the police Craig intentionally pushed Paul over the cliff, but everyone is shocked when Meg finally verifies his story. Aaron asks Dusty to help him get a job. Dusty wants Aaron and Allison to get back together. Jade tries everything to get Will to believe that Cleo intends them harm to no avail. Will wants to get a retraining order against Jade. Meg can't believe that Paul is even dead. Craig offers to go look for Paul again so she can rest. Allison finds out that Dusty is helping Aaron stay in town and is angry. Emily and Dusty share some time together again. Craig tells Meg they found a locket; Meg breaks down when she realizes it is hers. She admits to Craig the story behind it. Craig promises to not let her down and find Paul at any cost. Holden finally reaches Meg. Cleo promises herself that she will take care of Jade. Meg is furious that Lucinda is asking about the contract when Paul is still missing; she thinks that is all she cares about. People mean nothing to her, so she responds in kind by ripping up the contract, which Craig witnesses. Aaron convinces Allison to take a motorcycle ride with him. Emily appears to be fighting her continuing attraction to Dusty, which she thinks is not reciprocated, so she rushes off when they are done with their work. Will is driving when he notices headlights close behind him; his car is struck from behind causing him to run off the road."

        "Will: Are you supposed to be quoting Cleo right now, or is that all you?",
        "Jade: You were being really nasty to me, so I got defensive.",
        "Will: So you threatened to kill me?",
        "Jade: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Will: Before you kill me? That's generous.",
        "Jade: You know, Will, please do not call the cops. Would you just tell them what was in the diary?",
        "Cleo: All -- all I said is that I really love Oakdale. And I really love Gwen's new CD. And I'm so excited to go to Branson --",
        "Jade: Tell them the truth!",
        "Noah: Whoa, can we just dial it back a little? I mean, we all say crazy things when we're angry.",
        "Jade: You don't even know me. And you're the only person in this room that's making sense right now.",
        "Noah: So, you didn't mean to threaten Will?",
        "Will: She meant it, all right.",
        "Jade: No, I am not the threat! Cleo is the threat. And if you guys would just look for that diary, and read it, you would know that.",
        "Will: She just told you what she wrote!",
        "Jade: Yeah, and she left out of the part where she says she wants to get rid of Gwen so she can have you!",
        "Cleo: You're so mean! You're so mean to make fun of me like that! How can I ever think that any guy, especially a guy like Will, could love somebody like me?",

        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Alison: You want me to be the girl you fell in love with.",
        "Aaron: Because you are.",
        "Alison: No, she's long gone. We've both changed so much. We can't go back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, you're looking at books or are you checking out your lipstick?",
        "Alison: What do you think?",
        "Emily: Right now? I'm thinking something's not quite right with you. What is it?",
        "Alison: Are you heading home for dinner?",
        "Emily: No, I'm not hungry. I just had ice cream with Dusty a little while ago. What's got you so down?",
        "Alison: Ice cream with Dusty? So, does that mean things are warming up between the two of you?",
        "Emily: Oh, I don't know about that. We've been spending a little time together since he's been back. But I don't know. I don't know what that means.",
        "Alison: Guys. The way they treat you, what they want, why they're with you or not, it's so random. Who knows why they do anything?",
        "Emily: Are you talking about Aaron? Have you decided to see him?",
        "Alison: Saw him.",
        "Emily: Oh, what'd you do?",
        "Alison: Talked.",
        "Emily: About what?",
        "Alison: Stuff.",
        "Emily: Alison --",
        "Alison: It went fine. It went great.",
        "Emily: Well, that's great. Are you going to see him again?",
        "Alison: He didn't stick around.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm sorry, Ali.",
        "Alison: No, don't feel bad. That's what I wanted. For him to go. Aaron's probably halfway back to Seattle by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Aaron. Aaron Snyder.",
        "Concierge: Are you related to Lily Snyder? She's the co-owner of this hotel.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I know who she is. I know. Listen, I'm an excellent bartender. I've got references in Oakdale and in Washington.",
        "Concierge: May I see your resume?",
        "Aaron: I don't have it with me right now. I wasn't expecting this. I actually heard one of your waiters saying that you needed somebody, so -- is the position still available?",
        "Concierge: Feel free to apply by fax or mail.",
        "Dusty: Aaron -- stranger --",
        "Aaron: Dusty! Hey. How's it going?",
        "Dusty: How are you doing?",
        "Aaron: Good.",
        "Dusty: Good to see you.",
        "Aaron: To see you, too.",
        "Dusty: What are you up to? Visiting your folks?",
        "Aaron: I'm staying with them, yeah. But it's not a visit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I did not push Paul Ryan off that cliff! This woman is lying to you, Officer.",
        "B.C. Cop: Now, why would she do that?",
        "Craig: Ms. Walsh and I have a very contentious relationship.",
        "B.C. Cop: And Paul Ryan, the victim? Did you have problems with him, too?",
        "Craig: Yes, but this woman has her own reasons for doing me harm. Don't you, huh? Don't you?",
        "B.C. Cop: Please step back, Sir --",
        "Craig: Because you were there. You know I tried to save him. I tried to save his life --",
        "B.C. Cop: Step back!",
        "Craig: All right.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you so much, Officer. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Montgomery is a volatile man.",
        "Craig: No, you know what? When someone accuses me of murder, I have a tendency to get a little agitated!",
        "B.C. Cop: You said something about Mrs. Montgomery being drugged?",
        "Lucinda: Yes. He put drugs in her tea, and now the evidence --",
        "Craig: Now, you know -- that's it. That is absurd! My wife is obviously distraught. She is also obviously clear-headed. This woman will say anything to incriminate me, including lying through her teeth! If you would like to know what happened on the cliff, please just ask my wife.",
        "Lucinda: Let's do that. Let's ask her. Meg, Craig was angry at Paul, wasn't he?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Right. And Craig threatened Paul's life, didn't he?",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, you're going to upset her. Okay, that's fine. You want to ask my wife questions? Fine. Get this woman out of here!",
        "Lucinda: And then, out there on the cliff, when he held Paul's life in his hands, what did he do? He opened his hands, and he let Paul go. Didn't he?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, really, you've got to try to focus --",
        "Craig: Would you just leave her alone?",
        "Lucinda: You remember how angry Craig was when he found out you'd betrayed him? And he wanted to get back at you, by letting Paul --",
        "Meg: None of that matters right now. I just want to make sure Paul is safe, and we need to go find him.",
        "Craig: That's right. That's what we should be concentrating on now, not these stupid accusations.",
        "B.C. Cop: Mr. Montgomery, I'm going to have to take you in for questioning.",
        "Craig: Wait a second! I didn't try to kill anybody, all right? Officer, yes, we fought. But he just -- he slipped on the rocks.",
        "Lucinda: You pushed him.",
        "Craig: He fell! We both fell. Look at me. We were fighting. It was -- he slipped, and he went out over the edge. I tried to get him. I tried to hold him, but he was so angry, he -- he tried to pull me over with him.",
        "B.C. Cop: You didn't say that in your earlier statement. Mr. Ryan, he tried to pull you over the side?",
        "Craig: Yes, when I tried to save him.",
        "B.C. Cop: Well, there's obviously more here than there first appeared. You're coming with me --",
        "Craig: No, no, all right, all right. You want to know what's going on, just ask my wife. Meg, please -- tell him what happened. Tell him what you saw.",
        "B.C. Cop: You saw what happened?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "B.C. Cop: Did Mr. Montgomery push Paul Ryan over the cliff or not?",
        "Lucinda: You can -- you can -- you can tell now. Craig can't hurt you anymore.",
        "Meg: I'm not afraid of him.",
        "Lucinda: Oh --",
        "Meg: It's true.",
        "Craig: Meg --",
        "Meg: Craig's right. He did try to hold onto Paul's hand. But, Paul wouldn't accept his help.",
        "Lucinda: What are you saying?",
        "Meg: He would have been all right! He would have been fine. But he just hated Craig so much, that he wouldn't let himself be saved by him.",
        "Lucinda: Look, clearly Mrs. Montgomery is still under the influence of the drugs that he administered to her. She can't be rational at this point.",
        "B.C. Cop: Well, she sounds rational to me. And I'm going to go with her version.",
        "Craig: Good. Thank you. We've wasted enough time here. We should be out there looking for Paul.",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah, I'm going with you.",
        "Craig: No, wait, Meg, please. Please, please, let me do this. Please. I promise you, I will -- I'll do the best I can.",
        "Lucinda: Have you completely lost your mind?",
        "Meg: I need to go help look for Paul.",
        "Lucinda: No, wait a minute. They're looking for Paul. Don't you worry about that? You think you going around screeching Paul's name is going to help him? I thought you were in love with him.",
        "Meg: I am.",
        "Lucinda: Why, then -- why -- why did you just let Paul's murderer go free?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Aaron left town? Already?",
        "Alison: Why would he stay?",
        "Emily: For you? Did he say something to hurt your feelings? What, did he bring up the past and make you feel worse than you already do about what happened?",
        "Alison: About why we broke up?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I'm why we broke up. I'm the one who slept with someone else --",
        "Emily: Yeah, because you thought he was cheating on you. You told me the whole story. His mother was sick and he -- he shut you out, practically. And then, what, his old girlfriend starts hanging around? How were you supposed to feel? You were -- you were lost --",
        "Alison: I was wrong.",
        "Emily: Aaron rubbed it in.",
        "Alison: No, he --",
        "Emily: What? What did he do?",
        "Alison: He apologized for not being there for me. And he asked to give us another chance.",
        "Emily: Alison, that's wonderful. I don't understand. What's the problem?",
        "Alison: I'm the problem. Too much has happened to me since I left him. I'll never be good enough for him now.",
        "Emily: That's not true, Ali.",
        "Alison: It's always been true. Practically since the moment I met Aaron, I've been trying to be what he'd want me to be, and I'm just not that.",
        "Emily: Well, I don't believe that for a minute --",
        "Alison: And okay, we'd go along and we'd be fine for a little while, and then I'd do something totally Alison. Something wild or desperate or clingy. And now I'm a recovering addict, and porn star on top of it?",
        "Emily: Oh, Ali, please. If you tell Aaron, you don't know how he's going to react. Who knows? Maybe he'll even understand.",
        "Alison: No matter how well I'll explain it, he will never understand. Aaron will never be okay with me getting it on on a DVD. And what about his parents? His grandmother --",
        "Emily: They don't have to know about it.",
        "Alison: Neither does Aaron. You know, I'm already having a hard enough time dealing with Mom being disappointed in me. I don't think I could handle Aaron as well.",
        "Emily: I'm not disappointed in you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it's early yet. Just give me time, and I'm sure I'll find something.",
        "Emily: Oh, would you cut it out? Would you -- just listen to me. Things can turn around. Look at me! They have totally turned around. Do you know Dusty actually apologized to me for judging me?",
        "Alison: So you think you and Dusty are headed toward something serious?",
        "Emily: I think Dusty and I are good friends. And that's more than I ever hoped for.",
        "Alison: But I don't want to be just friends with Aaron. I mean, I'd rather be nothing than go through losing him all over again. I love him, Emily.",
        "Emily: You know what? Let's talk more about this after dinner. What do you say?",
        "Alison: Are you through trying to fix my life?",
        "Emily: Dinner. Where do you want to go?",
        "Alison: Oh, not Al's --",
        "Emily: Okay --",
        "Alison: It's bad enough I'm going to be working there tonight --",
        "Emily: All right, I understand. I was thinking something new and different. The Lakeview?",
        "Alison: Thinking you might run into Dusty?",
        "Emily: No, I'm thinking I might spend some time with my sister. Who I am very, very proud of. Come on, let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So you can put in a good word for me with the bar manager? Maybe help me get a job here?",
        "Dusty: Why are you asking me to do this?",
        "Aaron: Because I used to work for you. And I'm dependable. I'm responsible and I work really hard.",
        "Dusty: Of course I'll put in a good word for you.",
        "Aaron: Yes!",
        "Dusty: Now, are you sticking around because of your ex?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, Ali's a pretty big factor.",
        "Dusty: She wants you to stay?",
        "Aaron: I think so, but she's not -- she's not saying that. I mean, I love her. I love her, and she loved me. And I don't even mean just a little bit, I mean all the way. I miss it. I miss that a lot. I miss her.",
        "Dusty: Why'd you let her go?",
        "Aaron: Because I kept telling myself that it wouldn't work. You know, that I'd go find somebody else. Somebody who wasn't so crazy, and somebody who wouldn't make me worry and make me as jealous, you know? Just somebody easy. It turns out, I don't want easy. I want Alison. I want her. If I could just have a second chance with her.",
        "Dusty: You'd be good for her.",
        "Aaron: You think so?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. A good guy like you is what she needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: That's a big, fat dirty lie, what she said! I would never think that I was pretty or as talented as Gwen is!",
        "Jade: Oh, please. Will, listen to me. If you love your wife, you have to look for this diary. She's written things in there, crazy things. She's going to hurt Gwen.",
        "Cleo: No, I would -- I would never hurt Gwen. I love her.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, according to her diary, she loves you more than anything. How did she put it? More than \"Rainbows and pistachio ice cream all mushed together.\"",
        "Cleo: I never wrote anything like that.",
        "Jade: Well, I sure as hell didn't make that up. Doesn't that sound like her?",
        "Will: Yeah, a little, but Jade --",
        "Jade: She's written other things, obsessive things. Sappy things, crazy things. She's looking at this whole trip to Branson as a way to make her move. Look, we used to be friends. We used to be good friends. And I'm just asking you to believe me. She's trying to wreck things for you and Gwen.",
        "Will: That's your M.O, Jade, not hers.",
        "Cleo: You're so -- I mean, you're so --",
        "Jade: I'm so -- so right!",
        "Cleo: No, you're so rude! Please, Will, just stop her.",
        "Jade: I'm not going to stop until I find that diary.",
        "Cleo: I already told you, it's at the Lakeview!",
        "Jade: You just had it in your hands. You're hiding it, aren't you?",
        "Cleo: No!",
        "Will: Hi, this is Will Munson. Is Lieutenant Hughes there?",
        "Jade: Will, no! Will, don't do that! Don't call the police. Okay, I will just go. I will forget about it, okay?",
        "Will: You're not going to forget about it. You're never going to let this go.",
        "Jade: Yes, I will let it go. I will just walk away.",
        "Will: Jade, I'm not going to let you hurt Gwen.",
        "Jade: That is the whole point. I am not going to hurt Gwen, and if you don't listen to me, you're going to be so, so sorry.",
        "Noah: That was intense.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's Jade.",
        "Cleo: Why does that girl hate me so much?",
        "Will: She doesn't hate you, Cleo. It's actually me and Gwen. She hates us. And I think she was just taking it out on you.",
        "Cleo: Can you just promise me one thing? Just don't believe what she said, about the diary. If you really want to look, I'll bring it home from the Lakeview. You can read every single page.",
        "Will: No --",
        "Cleo: I mean, even the super, super personal stuff.",
        "Will: Cleo, I know you're not capable of saying those things. But she is, and that's why I have to go to the cops.",
        "Noah: You really going to get a restraining order?",
        "Will: Yeah, probably. And don't worry. Once I file a report, she's not going to hurt anybody anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay, where do you want to sit? You pick it. Ali?",
        "Alison: What are you doing here?",
        "Aaron: Applying for a job.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Aaron: Because I need to eat. Hi, Em.",
        "Emily: Hi, Aaron.",
        "Alison: You already have a job, in Seattle.",
        "Aaron: No, I quit. I wasn't sure how long I was staying, so --",
        "Emily: What, you're staying?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. I just ran into Dusty. He's going to throw in a good recommendation. So, I think I've got the job part nailed.",
        "Alison: I hope this isn't because of me. Is it? Are you staying because of me?",
        "Aaron: Partly, yeah.",
        "Alison: I told you good-bye, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but I didn't say good-bye to you.",
        "Alison: I hope you enjoy your new job and your new life in Oakdale.",
        "Aaron: Thank you.",
        "Alison: And your new girlfriend, too.",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Alison: The one you'd better find, because you have no chance with me. Got it? No chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Craig didn't murder Paul.",
        "Lucinda: How can you say that? Honestly --",
        "Meg: Paul is not dead!",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling. I know, I know you want to believe that. I know, but it's almost impossible for anyone to have survived a fall like that. And another thing, why would Craig -- why would Craig do all that groundwork -- all that groundwork, and then change his mind at the last moment? The eleventh hour, and spare Paul's life?",
        "Meg: Craig was jealous --",
        "Lucinda: Insanely jealous! Insanely jealous! He would grab any chance he could get to get rid of him.",
        "Meg: But he didn't take that chance. Don't you see? He didn't take it. And yes -- yes, maybe he did to all the things you said he did, but he didn't kill him, Lucinda! I was there. You were there!",
        "Lucinda: Do you think that Paul was hanging off the rock by choice? What you've done, Darling, is you have now given -- you've given blithely -- you've given the B.C. police the okay to let Craig go free! To heap more awful events on the rest of us -- the rest of our lives!",
        "Meg: I told the truth.",
        "Lucinda: Why? I mean, why? You've got the company. I mean, that's what our whole plan -- our whole -- yours from the beginning was to get rid of Craig. I mean, it was all right in your hands. Paul has died for it, possibly. Why? Why do that?",
        "Meg: Because I couldn't lie anymore. Paul was on that cliff because I insisted on leading Craig on, making him believe that I was ready to be his wife. And it was a lie. And Paul begged me not to do it. But I didn't listen. And none of this would be happening right now.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no. No, no, no, you want justice. Justice. Craig committed a crime. He stole the company. He did -- you, you succeeded. You got the company back. You did a wonderful, noble thing.",
        "Meg: Noble?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, yes.",
        "Meg: It's not noble to lie, and scheme and want revenge. But I did it anyway, and now Paul is out there somewhere. And I need to find him.",
        "Craig: Hey -- you're still here?",
        "Lucinda: What, and you're back so soon? I thought you were going to spend the rest of your life looking for Paul. What, it's 20 minutes less than that.",
        "Craig: Lucinda, would you please give us some privacy?",
        "Lucinda: I am not going to leave you alone with her.",
        "Craig: I am not alone. Captain Myerson? Please, this is Captain Myerson, Canadian coast guard. This is my wife, Meg.",
        "Lucinda: How do you do, Captain Myerson? I'm Lucinda Walsh. Have you got news for us?",
        "Meg: Did you find him? Is he all right?",
        "Captain Myerson: We found some personal effects.",
        "Craig: Look, Meg, I don't want you to get your hopes up. They did find something. I don't think that it's Paul's, but the captain wanted to show it to you anyway to make sure.",
        "Captain Myerson: Do you recognize this?",
        "Craig: Meg? Meg? Get her some water! Get her water right now. Come here, its okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're all right. What is it? What is it? What, is that Paul's?",
        "Meg: No, it's mine.",
        "Craig: I don't understand, Baby. What is it? Did you drop it on the cliff? What happened?",
        "Meg: I gave it to him. Just before the wedding. I gave this to him. He promised -- he promised -- he promised. I'm all right now. I was just surprised.",
        "Lucinda: You could have handled that more delicately. You know what Paul meant to her.",
        "Craig: They said it was a locket. Why would I think that was Paul's? If you don't want to do this right now --",
        "Meg: No, no, no, nothing -- nothing has changed. He's still out there. He's still out there, and we need to find him.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, he's probably gone. I mean, the locket --",
        "Meg: The locket only proves that he could have survived, okay? You found the locket. You could find him. Where -- where did you find the locket?",
        "Craig: It was washed up on shore, Meg.",
        "Meg: Well, that's good. That's great, because -- because that means he could have swam to shore. And he could be all right. But we need to get out there and find him as soon as possible. He could be unconscious or something.",
        "Captain Myerson: No, Ma'am, even if Mr. Ryan hit the rocks, the impact alone would --",
        "Meg: No! No, no! No, okay? He's alive, okay? And I know it!",
        "Lucinda: Take it easy.",
        "Meg: No! No, okay? This is just a locket, Lucinda. It's not Paul, all right? This doesn't prove that he's dead. As a matter of fact, it's just the opposite. He had this -- he had this, and it fell out of his pocket. And there's a few scratches on here, but its fine. And we can't give up. Okay? We can't give up. You -- you need to go out there. You need to go out there and find him, okay?",
        "Captain Myerson: We don't have the manpower to keep this search going.",
        "Meg: Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I think -- we should always, you know, face the facts.",
        "Meg: No! Please don't make them stop searching. Please don't make them stop.",
        "Craig: I won't. I will pay for the extra manpower. Whatever it costs.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, okay, so -- so what do we do now?",
        "Craig: The captain and I will come up with our strategy. Sir, may I meet you downstairs?",
        "Captain Myerson: I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Okay, just give me a few minutes, and I'll go with you, okay? [Cell phone rings] Paul? Paul? Holden, hi. I --",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Holden. She's all right. We've just had some trouble here. I'll take care of it.",
        "Craig: When did you give that to him?",
        "Meg: Before the wedding.",
        "Craig: You said that he promised you something.",
        "Meg: You said you would find him.",
        "Craig: I will. But I need to know everything, Meg. Right now. All of it.",
        "Meg: I promised that I would come to him after the wedding. He promised me that we would be together. And when he gives me this locket back, we would have started a new life together.",
        "Craig: All right. I'll find him. I'll find him. I won't let you down.",
        "Lucinda: Holden wants to come take you home.",
        "Meg: I'm not leaving without Paul. Barbara. Barbara, Barbara, she can't know. She can't know. She can't hear anything about the accident until -- until we find Paul and he's fine.",
        "Lucinda: I'll take care of that, all right. You just rest.",
        "Meg: No, no, I need to go out there. I need to go help them find --",
        "Lucinda: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let the experts do what experts do. Let them do it. I mean, you're a nurse. You're an expert. You know how much the human body can take. I mean, you might just faint from exhaustion, in what, an hour? Half an hour? Something like that? So, do you want the search party looking for Paul or looking after you?",
        "Meg: You're right. You're right. I'm not thinking clearly. Thank you for being here, Lucinda. But you know, I am little tired, so --",
        "Lucinda: It's okay. It's okay. You're dismissing me. Um, Darling? I apologize -- I apologize for getting excited a little bit earlier. I do understand how you want the lies to stop.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. I really do. You made me -- you made me understand it. This has just been awful, heartbreaking and awful, but at least one good thing came out of it.",
        "Meg: That's right.",
        "Lucinda: And you retrieved the company, and my God, that was -- that was miraculous. Maybe -- maybe you would -- maybe you'd like to sign the papers now? You know, transferring the company back, it might help you. One less thing to worry about.",

And I loathe Craig as did Paul. Now, Paul, if he lives, Darling, if he lives, you don't want to give Craig this -- this boundless weapon to wield over the two of you. You don't want to do that. And heaven forbid, if Paul doesn't make it, then let's have something to remember him. Have some good thing have come out of it. Oh, God. Let's just settle this.",
