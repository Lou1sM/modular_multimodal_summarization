        "Carly confronts Hannah about ripping up and burning the picture of her dad. At first Hannah denies it, but then claims that Carly's life would be ruined if she knew the truth. Carly demands that Hannah tell her about her dad's past, but Hannah won't budge, and decides to leave. Carly decides to find out about the photograph without Hannah's help, and she puts a call into a woman Nancy recommended to help her. Lucinda and Meg talk about her and Dusty reconnecting to pass the time till the doctor calls. Lucinda suggests Meg stay in town to get to know Dusty, but Meg doesn't think so, especially after Dusty blows her off. Paul dreams of Rosanna; but he wakes up to find Emily there with him. He later asks Emily to move in with him. Barbara tells Paul that Gwen is pregnant, and is trying to trap Will into believing he is the father, and she solicits Paul's help. Rosanna dreams of Paul, and then questions her marriage to Craig, but Craig is able to alleviate her fears with humor. Mike pleads with Rosanna to help him rein in Craig so Jen is under less stress. They agree to work together to help everyone in this situation, and Mike feels confident his way of handling Craig is working. Meanwhile, Jen is going behind his back and plotting with Dusty to handle Craig. They set him up at the Lakeview when Jen confronts Craig by antagonizing him, causing him to get angry and causing a scene in front of many witnesses, where Jen ends up apparently falling because of Craig."

        "Lucinda: No, no, I haven't.",

        "Rosanna: Please, don't be angry.",
        "Paul: How'd you get in?",
        "Rosanna: I kept my key. I couldn't stay with Craig.",
        "Paul: Craig's your husband.",
        "Rosanna: In name only. I was heartbroken when I saw you with Emily. That's the only reason I married him.",
        "Paul: I think you should leave.",
        "Rosanna: No, please, I can't leave. I can't leave. I can't ever leave you again. I love you, Paul. I love you so much.",
        "Emily: Oh! Coffee's ready. You okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.",
        "Emily: That was some dream. You were moaning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Paul --",
        "Craig: Wake up, sleepy head. Come on! Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. I heard you come down last night.",
        "Rosanna: I had trouble falling asleep.",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "Rosanna: What's this?",
        "Craig: Breakfast. Strawberries, French toast.",
        "Rosanna: French toast?",
        "Craig: Yeah, you have something against French toast?",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry, Craig. I think we both may have made a terrible mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hello? No, Randy, I haven't picked up my messages yet. Handle it. Have Steve back you up. I'll see you then. Sometimes I feel like a babysitter, except a construction boss.",
        "Jennifer: At home or at work?",
        "Mike: Work.",
        "Jennifer: You know, you really should go. Otherwise you'll just end up having to work late.",
        "Mike: Yeah, you're probably right. And I want to stop and talk to Rosanna before I get to the site. You know, maybe she can knock some sense into Craig.",
        "[Jennifer remembering] Craig:Rosanna's going to give me anything I don't already have. And ultimately, this child will always be my son. So why fight a battle you can't win? You agree to my term, and make things easier on everybody. Especially yourself.",
        "Jennifer: No, Craig's dug in. He won't change his mind.",
        "Mike: Don't worry about it, I'll handle it. Now that I know that you trust me to take care of things, I've got all the ammunition I need. Eat your breakfast. Hey, don't forget your vitamins.",
        "Jennifer: I won't.",
        "Dusty: So, are you ready to knock Craig out of your life for good or what? Jen?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I am. Let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Why would you do this?",
        "Hannah: I was just cleaning up.",
        "Carly: Oh, stop. You wanted to take what's left of this picture. Why?",
        "Hannah: I thought it was garbage.",
        "Carly: Well, it is now, thanks to you, Hannah. Why did you burn it?",
        "Hannah: I didn't.",
        "Carly: No? So what, it just spontaneously burst into flame?",
        "Hannah: I have no idea what happened.",
        "Carly: Stop it. I can see lying a mile away. I'm an expert at it, all right? So save your breath. This is the picture of my father that I thought I lost.",
        "Hannah: Well, maybe the boys took it.",
        "Carly: Please don't blame my children! They do know better than to touch matches. Hannah, you were my friend. You helped deliver Sage. Without you, Jack and I never would have found each other after his accident. Please, please, tell me why you don't want me to have this picture.",
        "Hannah: I swear, I would never do anything to hurt you.",
        "Carly: Then help me! Help me understand. Help me figure out what my father was doing here!",
        "Hannah: I don't know!",
        "Carly: Why are you holding out on me?",
        "Hannah: I'm sorry, I don't have time for this, I've got work to do.",
        "Carly: Put it down!",
        "Hannah: I don't have answers for you, Carly!",
        "Carly: You have plenty of answers. What did you think, that you would just get rid of one picture and I'd forget about it? Because I did find another one. Nancy Hughes gave it to me. It was taken in this town at some founder's day celebration. And this picture was taken in this town, too. But you want me to think it wasn't. Why?",
        "Hannah: You must have misunderstood.",
        "Carly: Something about my father being in this town has you spooked.",
        "Hannah: That's ridiculous.",
        "Carly: It's changing our friendship. Why?",
        "Hannah: Maybe it was a bad idea coming here.",
        "Carly: You owe me the truth! You can't run from this, Hannah.",
        "Hannah: I'm not running from anything. I just happen to believe that the past should remain in the past.",
        "Carly: It isn't your past, it's mine! And this is my father we're talking about. Why won't you tell me what he was doing in Oakdale?",
        "Jack: Hey, what's going on with you two?",
        "Carly: I'll tell you what's going on, Jack -- Hannah destroyed this picture, and now she's lying about it. She knows a hell of a lot more about my father than she's telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, you want to go for the record for the shortest marriage in Oakdale?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we're hardly your average newlyweds.",
        "Craig: We're not average anything.",
        "Rosanna: I know. Which is maybe why I thought this could work, but I don't know now. It just feels so forced.",
        "Craig: A whole 24 hours and you're not back in love with me yet?",
        "Rosanna: Well, the day is young.",
        "Craig: Well, give me a day or two before you file for divorce, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Craig: All right. And in the meantime, I'll go grab breakfast at the Lakeview. All right? And I will leave this for you in case you change your mind. Okay? We may not be conventional, all right? But that doesn't mean we can't be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, are you sure on the timing and everything?",
        "Jennifer: Are we sure that Craig is even headed to a public place?",
        "Dusty: He's been having breakfast at the Lakeview for the past two weeks. He'll be there.",
        "Jennifer: And it won't seem strange that I just happen to be there?",
        "Dusty: No, Jen, relax. Craig will not figure it out. Nor will anyone. Are you okay?",
        "Jennifer: Mike is headed to talk to Rosanna. I promised him that I would let him handle Craig.",
        "Dusty: Okay! Let him do it.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, maybe we should just wait and see if it works. Maybe he can get to Craig through Rosanna.",
        "Dusty: Are you dreaming?",
        "Jennifer: Well, what good is it if -- if I lose my husband?",
        "Dusty: What good is it if you have your husband and you lose your baby? [Phone ringing] Donovan. Great, stay on him and let me know where he's going. My guy's following Craig into town. It's now or never. We move now or we shut it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: That's what's the problem around here. The minute you say the \"c\" word, everything goes to hell.",
        "Sierra: Well, I'll tell you something. I am afraid. And I'm not ashamed to admit that to you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, what I think is that fear kills more people than cancer. And I'm not going to let fear overpower my life, all right?",
        "Meg: Okay, time out here. Time out. We don't know exactly what we're dealing with. Unless Dr. Berg called.",
        "Sierra: No, she hasn't.",
        "Meg: Okay, so let's chill out with some brain candy. Here you go.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, God, I don't read that kind of garbage.",
        "Meg: Okay, well you know what? It's time to try something new.",
        "Sierra: Are you sure you don't want to just go get some fresh air?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, good God -- \"monkey discovers cure for chronic fatigue syndrome. Primates awake for record three months.\" This is what the doctor ordered.",
        "Meg: It's better than sitting around waiting for the phone to ring.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, would you please go to the office? Go to Dusty, raise profits.",
        "Sierra: Dusty should know about this, don't you think?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, he's going to know the minute I tell him, all right?",
        "Sierra: You know, I'm just going to stop beating my head against a brick wall over this.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hey, hey! I'll call you. I'll call you when the doctor calls, its okay.",
        "Meg: I'm going to stay, if it's okay with you. Just in case when Dr. Berg calls you have any questions.",
        "Sierra: I'd appreciate that, actually. And I'm afraid I owe you an apology.",
        "Meg: No, you don't.",
        "Sierra: No, I do. Lily and I were very upset yesterday about Mother. And we sort of jumped all over you.",
        "Meg: Forget it, Sierra, really. I'd be a little crazy, too, if it was my mom.",
        "Sierra: Well, call me if you hear from Dr. Berg.",
        "Lucinda: I will.",
        "Meg: So tell me more about those monkeys.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I've moved beyond that. \"Dwarf surprise entry in NBA draft.\"",
        "Meg: So Dusty works with you at worldwide?",
        "Lucinda: Yep. He's proved to be quite an asset.",
        "Meg: You know, I never thought he was the business type.",
        "Lucinda: Have you run into him yet?",
        "Meg: I ran into him yesterday.",
        "Lucinda: Uh-huh. And?",
        "Meg: And nothing.",
        "Lucinda: Nothing?",
        "Lucinda: Nothing, oh. If memory serves me well, it seems to me that you and Dusty were hot and heavy at one point.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, that was years ago.",
        "Lucinda: Uh-huh. Yep, yep, that's is Dusty's car. They cut down the trees so you can see it. You see the car there?",
        "Meg: Oh, that one?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Oh.",
        "Lucinda: Dusty's car.",
        "Meg: Oh, okay.",
        "Lucinda: It's not the milkman's car. So if you want to get together -- I mean, if you want to make contact, this is your opportunity. Just go, go, seize it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Craig is getting what he deserves, all right?",
        "Jennifer: See, but you're sure that there's no way that mike can find out about this?",
        "Dusty: Jen, only you and I know what's going down. And I have to tell you, when it happens, I'm there for you. I got your back. You need to tell me if you can pull this off safely. I need to know it's safe.",
        "Jennifer: No, it is. It is. I can do this. I can make it look real, without anybody -- [Phone ringing] Being able to tell the difference.",
        "Dusty: It's my guy. What do we tell him?",
        "Jennifer: Tell him we're on our way.",
        "Dusty: Talk to me. The Lakeview? You sure? Stay with him till we get there, okay? Craig just pulled up to the Lakeview. I have a business meeting with Sierra, all right? I'm going to arrange it so we meet over there.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, good. That's good. She'll make a good witness.",
        "Dusty: Right. Listen to me, don't make a move until I get there.",
        "Jennifer: I won't.",
        "Dusty: All right, get going. I'll be right behind you.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks, thanks, dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Sorry, slow start this morning. Can we go over those figures at the Lakeview? Great, I'll make it up to you. We'll do it over breakfast. I'm on my way.",
        "Meg: Hey! Where are you running off to?",
        "Dusty: You got me at a bad time. I've got a meeting.",
        "Meg: With Sierra?",
        "Dusty: How do you know that?",
        "Meg: I just came from the house.",
        "Dusty: Since when are you and Lucinda pals?",
        "Meg: Well, she has put me through nursing school.",
        "Dusty: It's kind of a long time between thank-yous.",
        "Meg: You know, she tells me that you're really valuable over at Worldwide.",
        "Dusty: I get the job done.",
        "Meg: And modest!",
        "Dusty: I got to go. I'll call you later.",
        "Meg: I bet you say that to all the girls.",
        "Dusty: Do you have a problem with what happened at the pond?",
        "Meg: For the record, I loved what happened at the pond. My problem is coming in second over a pair of off-the-rack jeans and Lucinda's profits.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to figure out how things got so far out of control.",
        "Carly: Ask her.",
        "Jack: You're sure that Hannah's the one who burned the picture?",
        "Carly: Who else could have done it, Jack?",
        "Hannah: I've called a taxi to take me to the bus station.",
        "Jack: Hannah, come on, don't leave.",
        "Hannah: I won't be treated like a criminal.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm just angry and I'm confused.",
        "Hannah: And I wish I could help.",
        "Carly: But you can. Is it the woman in that founder's day picture? Is that the problem here?",
        "Hannah: I don't want to miss my connection.",
        "Carly: Hannah, I already know that my father chased anything in a skirt.",
        "Jack: Carly, let it go.",
        "Carly: If you know who that woman was, just tell me.",
        "Hannah: I don't want to hurt you.",
        "Carly: Not knowing is what's hurting me.",
        "Hannah: No, you're wrong! What's been done can destroy you a hundred times over and it can never be undone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, from what I hear, Jennifer is in no mood to compromise.",
        "Mike: For good reason. Craig has made her life miserable. And while we're on the subject of that, what is the deal with you two?",
        "Rosanna: That didn't take long.",
        "Mike: One day you're back, next day you're married?",
        "Rosanna: Look, Craig and I ran into each other in Bangkok, and we realized we still had feelings.",
        "Mike: I remember those feelings. You hated his guts when you found out he adopted Cabot illegally. You know his tricks better than anybody. Isn't that reason enough to keep him from messing up another kid's life?",
        "Rosanna: There's more to Craig than most people know.",
        "Mike: That's what scares me. Now, I know this is none of my business, but what about Paul? You two looked so perfect.",
        "Rosanna: I don't want to talk about Paul.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Rosanna: Because that part of my life is over. Trust me, Paul has moved on -- and so have I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What? We don't have to talk about it.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, I think we should definitely talk about it. I think we should score it line an Olympic event. I think the eastern bloc judges are going to give us a ten.",
        "Emily: I wasn't talking about our sex life. I was talking about Rosanna's wedding.",
        "Paul: Oh, that.",
        "Emily: What was it like?",
        "Paul: Same lines, same ending.",
        "Emily: I'm serious.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't really want to be serious right now. It had its value, in a knife-twisting kind of way.",
        "Emily: So you had to see it to believe it?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it was like a train wreck. I'm glad I went, and I'm even more glad that you came back last night.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Barbara: Paul? Honey?",
        "Paul: Do I owe her money?",
        "Barbara: Honey, we have to talk. I know you're here, I'm parked next to your car.",
        "Paul: Pass me my invisible ray gun.",
        "Emily: I think I got a better idea. I'll hide behind the door and knock her out cold.",
        "Paul: I've got an even better idea. Why don't we just invite her in?",
        "Emily: Where do you keep your blunt objects?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Barbara: I'm not going to leave until we talk.",
        "Paul: All right, you heard the old battleaxe.",
        "Barbara: Paul? Honey, please, please. I want to talk to you. It's about your brother.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Barbara: Good morning to you, too. It took you so long to answer the door.",
        "Paul: So what's this about Will?",
        "Barbara: Oh, nothing much. He's just ruined the rest of his life.",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: She's pregnant. His so-called girlfriend has gotten herself pregnant.",
        "Paul: Are you sure?",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, I'm sure. Of course she's only after the money. But I swear I won't let that piece of trailer trash destroy your brother's future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I don't know. I guess Will must be the baby's father. Otherwise, why would he have brought Gwen into the hospital for a check-up? Oh, Bob, he must be terrified.",
        "Bob: It's a big responsibility.",
        "Kim: I'll say. He's certainly not going to get the right kind of help from Barbara. But at least one member of our family seems to have settled down. Jen, she looks well, doesn't she?",
        "Bob: Not for long, I'm afraid.",
        "Kim: Oh, terrific. So much for our relaxing breakfast together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I was hoping we could actually talk.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we will. But not today. I got to go.",
        "Meg: Did I do something?",
        "Dusty: No. I'll call you later.",
        "Meg: Sure you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, thank you. Hello, Jennifer. Where's your goon?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, he's right over there. Deacon, it's okay. In fact, you know, you can wait outside by the car. I think Mr. Montgomery can behave himself in public.",
        "Craig: Otherwise, yeah, I'd offer you a seat.",
        "Jennifer: I was up all night thinking about what you said at my place.",
        "Craig: Well, I didn't want to cost our child a night's sleep.",
        "Jennifer: It's true, Craig, you have money, position, power -- well, at least Rosanna does. You could drag a custody battle through the courts for years.",
        "Craig: All I have ever wanted is a fair and equal chance to raise our child.",
        "Jennifer: That's just it, Craig. You've had two fair and equal chances to raise your children. That's why my attorney is drafting up a document that releases you from any and all parental claims to my baby. Sign it, Craig, and get out of our lives for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: If you do not sign away your rights to this baby, I swear I will tell everyone you killed your own son.",
        "Barbara: You've got somebody back there. Don't deny it. I know exactly who it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, Mike, I don't know why news about my wedding is so shocking. People change their partners more often than they change their socks around here.",
        "Mike: Why put yourself in the middle of this mess?",
        "Rosanna: Mike, you and I have known each other for too long to start lying to each other now, okay? You want everything to be simple. You want it to be that you and Jennifer are right and that Craig is wrong. And you and Jennifer get to raise her baby and then Craig just takes off somewhere. But life is not like that. Life is not that simple. Jennifer had sex with Craig, okay? And now she has to face the consequences of that action. So, maybe Craig is not the one that you're really angry at. Maybe he's not the problem at all. Maybe your wife is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Did you hear what I said?",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Jennifer: My baby --",
        "Craig: Our baby.",
        "Jennifer: Will never spend one second of its life with you.",
        "Craig: There is not a court in the country that will support you on that. I am entitled to share in a fair portion of our child's life.",
        "Jennifer: No one's going to give you custody. You're a rotten excuse for a father.",
        "Craig: And where did you learn how to be a Mother, in my bed? Shall we put your Mother on the stand just for fun? See that great stock you came from. Or maybe we could impress the judge with your lies about the baby, trying to pass it off as Mike Kasnoff's?",

        "Barbara: No, I want you to tell him that he's not responsible for that tramp's lies. And then please talk to him about his improving his taste in girls.",

        "Barbara: Well, I wanna be here when you do.",

        "Jennifer: Bryant spent his life knowing that he and his Mother were just a meal ticket to you. How much time did you make for him, Craig? How many father-son outings were ere? Did you even know that he was around? Were you spending your time just spending Sierra's money? He called you that night. Did you listen? Did you let him know his life mattered to you? You were a father to him, Craig, but you were never his dad.",
        "Craig: You finished? You finished? Because I have to go now.",
        "Jennifer: No. No, I'm not. How long will this child have before you forget him, too? How long before you've got more important things to do than listen to him? How long before you kill this baby, too?",

        "Jennifer: No, you get away from me.",
