        "Holden, with Jack's help, is determined to find out Damian's connection to Ross' foundation. Damian continues to manipulate Luke by trying to casually suggest he stay away from Lily for her best interests. Ross upsets Damian when he calls demanding a meeting because he is worried about the police calling to question him; the foundation should not be aligned with a case involving a hurt pregnant woman in a coma. Damian is angry that Luke is even more confused now. Emma tells Holden that Luke is staying longer with Damian, and he decides to go get his son back. Luke ends up at the hospital and Emma asks him to stay with Lily under the pretense she has something to take care of. Alone with Lily, Luke pleads with her to wake up; he needs and loves her, and will make up for the hurt he caused. Casey and Maddie arrange to find a motel to stay the night in. Maddie wrestles with her feelings. Casey bumps into Margo who has come home early and will be entertaining Dallas and Jess. Casey comes up with an excuse as to why he has an overnight bag. Maddie shows up to meet Casey and is upset to find Dallas there. Dallas doesn't want her scared of him. Not long after, without a word Maddie bolts, much to the confusion of Casey and Margo. Emily continues to subtly work Jen so she doesn't forget Johnny is home because of her. Although Emily cares for Jen and feels a bond now between their kids and Jen, she also thinks this is her last hope to keep Paul and Meg from raising her unborn child. Jen's health seems to deteriorate even though she works hard to hide it. Dusty and Jen argue about him placating her by telling her falsely he would think about his feelings toward Emily. Paul and Meg find out Jen was released against medical advice. Meg reads Jen's updated tests results and realizes she is getting much more sick, so they rush over to see her. While attending to Johnny, Jen's health becomes precarious. Paul and Meg inform Dusty about what they have learned. Dusty finally relents and goes to check on Jen only to find her unconscious on the floor. They are unsuccessful in rousing her so Meg calls 911, but Dusty is so concerned he doesn't want to wait for the ambulance, as he scoops Jen up in his arms and starts to carry her out the door."

        "Holden: We want you to get better quick, because we miss you, and we love you. They both drew big hearts with their names in the middle. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put this right over here, so it's one of the first things you see when you wake up. Just make that soon.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Jack: Hey. How's she doing?",
        "Holden: No change.",
        "Jack: Talk to you outside a minute?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Jack: I got some info on that Kreeger Foundation.",
        "Holden: So I was right. The point was to try and make Luke straight.",
        "Jack: Exactly. They specialize in realigning gender.",
        "Holden: \"Realigning gender?\" They actually have a name for it?",
        "Jack: I know, can you believe it? They've been in business for years, and very successfully.",
        "Holden: I can't believe people would subject their children to something like that. Well, at least Kreeger didn't get his hands on Luke. So tell me, any connection between Damian and Ross, or the foundation?",
        "Jack: I don't know yet. Kreeger's not being very cooperative. He's not returning any of my phone calls.",
        "Holden: Well, that's no surprise.",
        "Jack: And there's no trail, paper or otherwise, leading Kreeger to Damian.",
        "Holden: There has to be. You're just not looking hard enough, Jack. Dig deeper.",
        "Jack: Yes, I will. But you might want to start preparing yourself for the possibility that Damian's on the level with this. Maybe he's not involved and Lily was acting alone.",
        "Holden: I don't believe that. Damian is behind this. And if you can't find proof, then I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Going somewhere?",
        "Luke: The hospital.",
        "Damian: I was about to make a late breakfast. Scrambled eggs and Prosciutto still your favorite?",
        "Luke: Not since I was five.",
        "Damian: Don't worry. I'll get the hang of it. What else can I get you?",
        "Luke: I usually just get a bowl of cereal.",
        "Damian: I can handle that.",
        "Luke: No, don't bother. I gotta get going. I'll grab something later.",
        "Damian: Look, Luke -- I know a lot has changed. I've got a lot of catching up to do. But I'm up for the challenge.",
        "Luke: Damian, this isn't about you. I just -- I just gotta go.",
        "Damian: Stay, please.",
        "Luke: But maybe Mom's woken up.",
        "Damian: Well, if she has, do you really think it's a good idea for you to see her? Or for her to see you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Man, all these seem so --",
        "Maddie: Sleazy?",
        "Casey: Exactly. I can't believe we can't find one decent place where we can be together.",
        "Maddie: Lilac Lane sounds nice.",
        "Casey: Available by the night or by the hour.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I missed that part.",
        "Casey: Well, the right place is out there. We'll find it.",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Maddie: This is all my fault. We should just be able to just stay here, but no, I have to make things complicated.",
        "Casey: No, you're right. I mean, it is kind of weird being at my parents' house. Maybe we should find some place special.",
        "Maddie: Definitely not the open arms motel, though.",
        "Casey: Definitely not for your first time.",
        "Maddie: Right. We could just drive around and see if any place seems appealing.",
        "Casey: Okay. On one condition.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: You tell me what's really bothering you. Because I don't think my parents' house is the problem. It's something else. I can tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, Dallas. Jess has told me a lot about you.",
        "Jessica: I'm surprised that you could join us. I called the station, they said that you and Tom had gone out of town.",
        "Margo: Well, yeah, we went to Chicago for a couple of days with Daniel, but you know what, I got up this morning, and I thought that they really need some father-son time alone, so I left them there. They can finish up the trip on their own.",
        "Jessica: I guess Emily's situation has been pretty hard on Daniel.",
        "Margo: Oh -- he's down in the dumps after we went to visit her in the hospital.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. We're talking about Margo's stepson.",
        "Dallas: Oh.",
        "Margo: Yeah, his mom is in a hospital for psychiatric evaluation before going to trial.",
        "Dallas: Hmm. That's rough.",
        "Margo: Well, it's going to be a whole lot rougher if she goes to jail.",
        "Jessica: So how much does Daniel actually know?",
        "Margo: Well, we try to keep it from him, but kids pick up --",
        "Jessica: Yeah, they certainly do.",
        "Margo: So I figure, a little Cubbies game, time with Dad, just the distraction he needs.",
        "Jessica: Well, we're lucky to have you. Do you want something to eat?",
        "Margo: Um, not here. Let's go back to my house for supper, okay?",
        "Jessica: You cooking?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Jessica: Then you're on. No, no -- she's a great cook. Are you up for that?",
        "Dallas: Sure. That sounds great.",
        "Jessica: I just need to go to the courthouse, take care of a few things, so why don't you go on over, and I'll meet you there.",
        "Dallas: Okay.",
        "Margo: Great, that'll give you some time to catch up. Let me just give you the directions here --",
        "Dallas: Oh, not necessary. I was actually there last night looking for you.",
        "Margo: You were? So --",
        "Dallas: I ran into your son.",
        "Margo: Oh, Casey?",
        "Dallas: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Margo: You met Casey?",
        "Dallas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Margo: Let me tell you -- was he alone or did he have a girlfriend with him?",
        "[Dallas remembering]",
        "Dallas: Why do you ask?",
        "Margo: He's a teenager -- parents are out of town. Need I say more?",
        "Dallas: I guess you don't.",
        "Jessica: What's the matter, Mom? Having some trust issues?",
        "Margo: Oh, you didn't hear the word \"teenager\"? Well, if you haven't met her, I'm sure you will tonight. I'm betting he's gonna bring her home for dinner.",
        "Dallas: I'll look forward to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, how does it feel, hmm? You're not even born yet, and you're already a hero.",
        "Susan: It's that baby's mother who made the choice. And I'm very proud of her. You took a big risk to help Jennifer and Dusty's baby.",
        "Emily: Well, it was the right thing to do.",
        "Susan: Even if they don't drop the charges against you?",
        "Emily: Mother, listen to me, I swear to you that's not why I did it. But I'm not without hope that it could happen.",
        "Susan: I just hope they realize how much courage it took to do what you did. Those stem cells saved Johnny's life. And that's huge. I just don't know if there's anything huge enough to make Dusty Donovan forgive you.",
        "Emily: I know -- I know it's a lot to hope for. But what matters is that Johnny's okay and so is my baby. But Jennifer did say she was gonna talk to Dusty before they left the hospital, so, who knows?",
        "Susan: I guess she didn't have any luck then.",
        "Emily: Why would you say that? What do you know?",
        "Susan: Jennnifer and the baby were released this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul -- look, I'm not sure this is a good idea, okay? The last thing Jennifer needs right now is for you and Dusty to get into another argument.",
        "Paul: I'm not here to argue with Dusty, I'm here to talk to Jennifer.",
        "Meg: I'm just not sure that would do any good.",
        "Paul: What am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to stand by and do nothing while Jennifer convinces Dusty to let Emily go free?",
        "Meg: I'm just saying, this might not be the best time to work on Jennifer. She's got pneumonia. She needs rest. You don't want to be making things worse.",
        "Paul: I know that. I'm just gonna talk to her.",
        "Meg: I'm sure it'll start out that way. But if it takes a turn for the worst and Jennifer collapses again, Dusty's gonna blame you. And I don't know, maybe he'll turn around and then drop the charges against Emily just to get you back.",
        "Paul: You're very sweet. I'll be very careful. Hi. Jen's my sister, is she doing all right?",
        "Nurse #1: I guess someone thought so. She's gone.",
        "Paul: She's gone?",
        "Nurse #1: She went home a little while ago. Without even waiting for her test results.",
        "Paul: That doesn't make any sense. Why would they let Jennifer go without checking her latest test results?",
        "Meg: Well, according to this, she wasn't ready to be discharged. They never should have let her go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jen gasping and coughing]",
        "Dusty: I finally got Johnny to sleep.",
        "Jennifer: Honey --",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, what is it? What is it?",
        "Jennifer: Can I get some more water?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, you're warm. You're having trouble breathing, aren't you?",
        "Jennifer: It's nothing. It's nothing, really.",
        "Dusty: I'm calling the hospital.",
        "Jennifer: No. Please don't do that.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, you can hardly breathe.",
        "Jennifer: I just -- I took my medication -- a pill that went down then wrong way, so --",
        "Dusty: Are you sure that's it?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. Really, I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: Because maybe we shouldn't have left the hospital, you know, we could've stayed another day or two.",
        "Jennifer: Absolutely not. You know how I feel about being home with Johnny. I want all of us to be together.",
        "Dusty: That's fine, Red. As long as we're not putting you at risk.",
        "Jennifer: I love how you worry about me.",
        "Dusty: I'm always worried about you.",
        "Jennifer: I just need a little rest, that's all.",
        "[Johnny crying]",
        "Dusty: I'll take care of it.",
        "Jennifer: Okay.",
        "Dusty: Be right back.",
        "[Jennifer coughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm pushing too hard, aren't I? You're not ready.",
        "Maddie: I am ready. I am so ready.",
        "Casey: Well, if you're not, it's fine. I get it.",
        "Maddie: There's nothing to get, except a room.",
        "Casey: I just -- I want this to be right for you, that's all.",
        "Maddie: I know. Who was the one that sprinkled rose petals all over the room? And I think I bought like a gazillion condoms. So, if anybody isn't ready -- you.",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. Yeah, I get it. I just -- I don't want to fight with you right now, I just -- I want this. I want you. I just want it to be right. I want every time to be right.",
        "Maddie: Me, too. Me, too.",
        "Casey: All right, well, so we just need to find a place and we're ready?",
        "Maddie: Yes, definitely. Even if it's the Open Arms Motel. As long as there are no interruptions, and we have some privacy.",
        "Casey: Okay. Give me a half an hour?",
        "Maddie: I'm gonna run over to the Lakeview and put some stuff in an overnight bag.",
        "Casey: Whoa. And what if my gram asks you where you're gonna be all night?",
        "Maddie: I don't know, I'll think of something.",
        "Casey: Hey -- I can't wait to be with you. And I mean, no one in the world but us tonight.",
        "Maddie: Okay, sounds wonderful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Holden, you have enough to worry about right now without chasing this down. Listen to me, listen. If there is a connection between Kreeger and Damian, I'll find it. I just need more time.",
        "Holden: But you don't think that there is a connection, do you?",
        "Jack: When I said that Lily might have acted alone, I didn't mean to make it sound like an accusation. I just know she has had a really tough time ever since Luke told you that he was gay.",
        "Holden: Yes, it has been tough for her. But she's dealing with it. And there's no way that she would send Luke away to a place like the Kreeger foundation. She would never do it knowing that it would hurt him.",
        "Jack: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Damian did this. It's just like him to try to manipulate Lily into believing that this realignment camp is harmless. I mean, who knows what lies he told her about this place, and how they operate.",
        "Jack: But still he had to know that he was taking a gamble. He had to know that you would find out what he was up to.",
        "Holden: I don't think he really cares what I think. Not after all those things he said about me being a bad father.",
        "Jack: So, he obviously does care about Luke being gay, although he says he doesn't.",
        "Holden: And I think he would do anything to try to change it, no matter how extreme.",
        "Jack: Just be thankful that he didn't succeed in getting Luke to that camp.",
        "Holden: Well, he's not going to give up. And now that Luke is spending more time with him, that's the reason why you need to prove that Damian tried to send him away to be de-programmed. Otherwise, Luke is not going to believe it. And we're running out of time here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So I'm the last person that Mom wants to see right now, is that what you're saying?",
        "Damian: I'm saying that after all the trauma she's been through, there's no way to predict how she'll react. I'm only trying to spare you, Luke. I don't want her to make you feel guilty for something that isn't your fault.",
        "Luke: Dad's the one that's making me feel guilty.",
        "Damian: Look, Holden is very concerned about your mother right now. But I know this is bothering you. It's troubling you. I saw your face when he yelled at you for being in your mother's room. I don't want you to go through something like that again.",
        "Luke: You mean, you don't want me to give him another reason to blame me for what happened.",
        "Damian: I can't speak for Holden. Even if he really did blame you, I doubt he would be so cruel to tell it to you.",
        "Luke: Yeah. You're probably right. It's just, when my mom woke up for that split second, and called out my name, I felt -- I felt like I had done something good, like maybe me being there was part of what brought her back. And when she looked at me, I mean, I thought, like --",
        "Damian: What?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe I'm just imagining things, but I thought she was trying to say that she was sorry.",
        "Damian: Sorry for what?",
        "Luke: For calling Ross Kreeger in the first place.",
        "[Damian remembering]",
        "Lily: The brochures, the literature -- it's all propaganda. Ross Kreeger is a de-programmer. He brainwashes kids into thinking they're not gay.",
        "Damian: Nobody can do that, Lily.",
        "Lily: No, they can't. They're not going to do it to our son because I'm not going to let it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Look, there's no way at this point to know what your mother was about to say to you. That's why I think you need to protect yourself.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but if I don't go back to the hospital, they're going to think that I've stopped caring about my mom.",
        "Damian: No one is going to think that, Luke.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe I should call my dad. Or just go to the hospital to check on her, but not go in her room --",
        "Damian: This is your decision, ultimately. But I really think it's a bad idea.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Damian: Yeah.",
        "Ross: It's Ross. I need to see you right away.",
        "Damian: I really don't think it's possible. I thought we had an understanding.",
        "Ross: The situation's changed. And if you don't want your son finding out from someone else how involved you've been in all of this, I suggest you get over here, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Jennifer's repeat chest x-ray shows a significant worsening in her condition.",
        "Paul: Then why did Bob let her go?",
        "Meg: He didn't. He left Lucy Montgomery in charge of Jen's case.",
        "Paul: What, so Lucy's responsible?",
        "Meg: Well, not entirely. The nurse said that Jennifer left the hospital before anyone saw the results. And it says right here, \"patient left against medical advice.\" I mean, Lucy must've tried to convince her to stay.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well she did a terrible job.",
        "Meg: There's just so much anyone can do, Paul. Patients can't be forced to stay against their will.",
        "Dusty: Dusty should've insisted that she stay.",
        "Meg: Maybe he wasn't fully informed. I mean, if Jennifer was determined to leave, maybe she told Dusty that she was officially discharged.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, the bottom line -- Jennifer's still really sick, right? She could collapse again.",
        "Meg: Or worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I can't believe Jennifer left without saying good-bye.",
        "Susan: Maybe they were anxious to get the baby home.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but still --",
        "Susan: No, you're right. Dusty hustled them out of here this morning. He wants to get her as far away from you as he can get her.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, who can blame him? I mean, I don't blame him. I did horrible things to him.",
        "Susan: Honey, you weren't in your right mind when you kidnapped him. Anyway, I blame most of that on Paul. He's a monster. He used you. And to think, he's going to get your baby. It's not fair! He shouldn't be allowed to be a parent.",
        "Emily: Guess what? There's nothing I can do about it if I'm in jail.",
        "Susan: That's right. That's why you can't give up. Just because Jennifer's not here doesn't mean you can't pick up the phone.",
        "Emily: You think I should call Jennifer?",
        "Susan: Of course. Well, you want to know how Johnny's doing, don't you? And then when she hears your voice, it'll be a great reminder to her that the only reason she's home with her baby is because you risked your baby. So, you remind Jennifer, she reminds Dusty -- and who knows? Maybe things can change.",
        "Emily: I don't have access to a phone, Mom.",
        "Susan: You do now.",
        "Jennifer: Hello?",
        "Emily: Hi, Jennifer. It's Emily. I heard you and Johnny were released from the hospital.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, this morning.",
        "Emily: Well, I thought you'd come by and see me before you left, but I guess there wasn't any time.",
        "Jennifer: We were in a rush.",
        "Emily: Well, I just wanted to see how Johnny was doing. He must be so happy to be home now.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, he's -- he's great.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, Jennifer, that's great. It's so great to hear that your whole family's together, safe and sound.",
        "Jennifer: Because of you.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm just happy it all worked out.",
        "Jennifer: Emily, I haven't forgotten what we talked about. I just haven't had a chance to -- to talk to Dusty about it. But I will, I promise.",
        "Emily: Thank you for that.",
        "Jennifer: I got him to say that at least he will consider the possibility of dropping the charges -- so at least it's on his mind.",
        "Emily: Are you okay? Jen, you sound -- I don't know, you sound weak.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I'm just a little tired.",
        "Emily: Well, I appreciate everything you're doing with Dusty, really.",
        "Jennifer: You saved my baby's life. There's little that I wouldn't do to repay you. But I'll talk to Dusty. You just have to give him some time.",
        "Dusty: Give me time for what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Something wrong?",
        "Damian: Nothing you need to worry about. So, what have you decided about visiting the hospital? Do you agree that for the time being, it's better to wait?",
        "Luke: I guess.",
        "Damian: Good, good. Now, why don't you go by your parents' house and pick up some more of your things.",
        "Luke: No, no, bad idea. I don't -- I don't want to deal with my sisters.",
        "Damian: Why not?",
        "Luke: Because they're going to have all these questions about mom. And they don't get why I'm not staying at the house right now.",
        "Damian: I'm sure Holden already explained a lot to them. Plus, they're probably missing you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I miss them, too.",
        "Damian: Well, then you should go see them.",
        "Luke: You think?",
        "Damian: I'm sure it would do a world of good.",
        "Luke: Maybe. I just -- okay. Okay, I'll go.",
        "Damian: Good. And then you'll come straight back here?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",

        "Casey: You want me to miss work for a case of beer?",
        "Margo: I very much doubt that Lisa's going to fire you for helping me out a little bit.",
        "Casey: You know what? She's very tough, Mom.",
        "Dallas: You know, it's not a problem.",

        "Jennifer: No. If we don't talk about it now, then when? Honey, our son is in the next room, healthy and happy, because of Emily.",
        "Dusty: After everything she put us through, don't you think it's the least she could do?",
        "Jennifer: When you said that you would at least consider it, you didn't really mean it, did you? Did you? You were just placating me. Why would you -- why would you do that?",
        "Dusty: I don't want to have this conversation.",
        "Jennifer: Answer my question. Were you lying to me?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, what's wrong?",
        "Jennifer: No, what's wrong is that -- I counted on you to at least consider helping out Emily and dropping the charges after everything that she did for us.",

        "Emily: No, she said that he just needs time.",
        "Susan: You don't have time.",
        "Emily: Look, I know that. This was your idea. Me calling Jennifer was your idea and I did it. And she sounded very optimistic.",
        "Susan: She very well may be. I'm just worried about Dusty.",
        "Emily: Dusty -- Jennifer is the most important thing to Dusty. If she would just convince him how important this is to her, he will do it for her, I know it!",
        "Susan: I hope you're right.",
        "Emily: Mother, ten minutes ago, you told me not to give up hope. Well, I'm not! If I have to call Jennifer five times a day, seven days a week, for the rest of my life, that's is what I'm going to do.",
        "Susan: That's the spirit --",

She risked the life of her own baby to make sure that you were okay. And thank God you are. Thank God -- [Jennifer struggling] Honey, I'm sorry, Mommy's just still a little shaky. I'm gonna put you down, okay? Okay -- okay -- but I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay. All right, honey? Because the worst is behind us. From now on, it's gonna be smooth sailing.

        "Ross: You left me with no choice. You wouldn't meet me when I asked you to. I don't react well to threats.",
        "Damian: I wasn't threatening you.",
        "Damian: You were about to tell Luke that I was involved in sending him away.",
        "Ross: I wasn't going to tell Luke anything. But suddenly, the police are breathing down my neck. They're calling the foundation, they're asking about the program. They want to find out who first approached me about Luke.",
        "Damian: What have you told them?",
        "Ross: Nothing. I haven't returned their calls.",
        "Damian: Good, good. If you want them off your back, just cooperate. Tell them what we agreed on. Lily contacted you, she was concerned about her son.",
        "Ross: Well, now Lily is hurt. So I am a prime suspect in a police investigation.",
        "Damian: All the more reason to answer their questions and be done with it.",
        "Ross: Well, what if it goes to court? What if they put me on the stand?",
        "Damian: What's the matter, Ross? Afraid to lie under oath?",
        "Ross: Yeah, you're damn right I am. And even if I don't tell the truth, Lily will.",
        "Damian: She's in a coma.",

        "Holden: Oh, good, I'm glad that he's home. I guess he had enough of Damian.",
        "Emma: Oh, no, I'm afraid not. He just came by to get more of his things to bring them back to Fairwinds.",
        "Holden: Oh -- well, what did he say to the girls?",
        "Luke: Well, apparently he told them that he'd be somewhere else for a while, and that he felt it was best for everyone.",
        "Holden: No, just what's best for Damian. Do me a favor? Can you stay with Lily for a little bit?",

        "Damian: I suggest you let me worry about what happens when Lily regains consciousness. Just stick to the plan. Tell them what you gotta say and get it over with.",
        "Ross: That's easy for you to say. I'm on the line here. The press will have a field day if they find out my foundation's been involved in a cover-up. Especially one that involves a hurt, pregnant woman. I am not about to let something like this undermine the good work that we do.",
        "Damian: Oh, if you're so good at what you do, tell me, how did you manage to scare the living daylights out of my son? Thanks to you, he's more confused than ever.",
        "Ross: Well, maybe if you'd been upfront with him from the beginning, he'd be in better shape.",
        "Damian: Unlike you, I've handled this exactly the way I should have.",
        "Ross: No, I disagree. I think you took a terrible risk. I think you should come clean and tell Luke that you were behind this, before someone else tells him.",
        "Damian: Let's get something straight, Kreeger. There is no way my son can ever know I was involved. If he does find out, I'm holding you responsible.",

        "Luke: No, I'm just -- I'm looking for my dad.",
        "Emma: He had to go somewhere to take care of something. It's a really good thing you're here. Luke, I told him I would stay with Lily until he got back, but something has come up over at the farm and I have to go over there to straighten things out. Could you stay with your mama until Holden gets back?",
        "Luke: I can't.",
        "Emma: Luke, I know it's difficult for you seeing her like this. Why don't you just sit down and talk to her. I know she'd love to hear your voice.",

I am so sorry. It's just, the thing is -- I still need you, Mom. And I still love you so much. So, please, please wake up.
