        "Meg: I'm not leaving. Leave me alone.",
        "Craig: It's chilly, you're going to catch a cold.",
        "Meg: I don't care.",
        "Craig: Well, at least have some tea. It'll warm you up.",
        "Meg: What did you put in it this time?",
        "Craig: Nothing. Please, let me help you.",
        "Meg: I don't want your help. I just want Paul back.",

        "Brad: Can you hand me that channel lock?",
        "Katie: If you say please.",
        "Brad: Wow.",
        "Katie: That'll do. What's a channel lock?",
        "Brad: I don't remember.",
        "Katie: Shouldn't you be out of those pants by now?",
        "Brad: Sure. You want to give me a hand?",
        "Katie: Whoa, whoa whoa. I hope you're a better plumber than comedian.",
        "Brad: Well, what happened to your sense of humor?",
        "Katie: We need to get serious. Kim's cocktail party starts soon.",
        "Brad: Right, right -- it's at that studio, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, and you can't just wander in. There's going to be dozens of executives there and Kim wants us there. On time.",
        "Brad: Relax. I never miss a party. Especially not one honoring me.",
        "Katie: How did this party get to be about you?",
        "Brad: I'm the reason the ratings are up, aren't I?",
        "Katie: You're still thinking that?",
        "Brad: The ladies tune in because of me, don't they?",
        "Katie: You are impossible.",
        "Brad: So you want me to, you know, wear a tie to match your dress?",
        "Katie: Why would I want you to do that?",
        "Brad: Well, I don't know. I mean, don't ladies appreciate it when their dates try to coordinate with whatever they're wearing?",
        "Katie: Well, first of all you don't own a tie. And second of all, what makes you think you're my date?",
        "Brad: Well, I wouldn't let you go to this high-powered party all by your lonesome.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't worry about her being all by her lonesome. Hey.",
        "Katie: Hi, I missed you! Nice tie.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",

        "Carly: Hey, Gwen, I'm so glad it's you on the desk.",
        "Gwen: Oh, wow, you look amazing. What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Well, Lily's helping me get back into business.",
        "Gwen: Design?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm meeting a potential client.",
        "Gwen: Well, that's awesome.",
        "Carly: His name's Sal Roberts. So, if he asks for me, would you tell him I'm in the lounge?",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Gwen: Careful you're going to scratch the cover off of your portfolio.",
        "Carly: I'm really nervous. I haven't done this in a long time.",
        "Gwen: Don't be nervous. You're going to knock him dead.",
        "Carly: From your lips to God's ear, huh?",
        "Gwen: Good luck.",
        "Noah: Hey Gwen, I got some press clippings for Branson if you want to look over them.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah.",
        "Noah: Did you talk to Will?",
        "Gwen: He left me a message, and I completely forgot to call him back. He sounded actually kind of upset.",
        "Noah: I'm not surprised.",
        "Gwen: You know what happened?",
        "Noah: I was at your house earlier and I don't know what I walked in on, but there was this girl, Jade, with Will and Cleo. And things were pretty tense.",
        "Gwen: So, Jade and Will got into a fight?",
        "Noah: Maddie told me you guys have a history. Sounds like oil and water.",
        "Gwen: Or gasoline and matches.",
        "Noah: I know we don't know each other that well yet, so I hope you don't think I was butting in, I just thought you'd like to know what went down.",
        "Gwen: No, no, I totally appreciate it actually. Would you mind if we went over this, just like in a little bit. I just want to call Will.",
        "Noah: Oh, go ahead, go ahead. He would have a better idea of what's going on than I would.",

        "Will: Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will, it's me. Call me when you get this. You're starting to get me worried. I hate it when he doesn't pick up his phone.",
        "Noah: He's probably just out of service or something. I'm sure everything's fine now. I mean, by the time I left, Jade was gone and things had calmed down a little.",
        "Sal: Excuse me, I have a meeting here with Carly Tenney and Lily Snyder. Do you know where they might be waiting?",
        "Gwen: I haven't seen Ms. Snyder, but I know that Ms. Tenney's is in the lounge, it's actually right through that doorway.",
        "Sal: Thank you.",
        "Noah: You're busy. I shouldn't have come to work. We can go over this another time.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, no, it's fine. Just tell me if you see anyone who looks like my boss. This trip to Branson is really important to me. I'll do whatever I can to make sure that it happens.",
        "Noah: Yeah I know, but you've got a lot on your mind right now. And something tells me you're not going to be able to concentrate on this until you talk to Will.",
        "Gwen: No, no, I'm just being a big worry-wart. I'm sure everything's fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's such a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Roberts. Please, have a seat. I am familiar with your properties. And I have to say I'm a big fan, especially of the lakefront timeshares. I think your company's done a fabulous job.",
        "Sal: Thank you. Shouldn't we wait for Lily before we get started?",
        "Carly: Yes, well, unfortunately Lily won't be with us today. She's dealing with a family emergency.",
        "Sal: I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe I should give her a call? There's some things about the project I need to ask her about.",
        "Carly: You know, I don't think she'd mind if you and I went over my designs without her.",
        "Sal: I don't think that'd be such a good idea --",
        "Carly: Of course, we can't talk finance, that is your area, but I can bring you up to speed on my work and tell you about some of my ideas for those properties on the lake. Lily mentioned that you were hoping to update them?",
        "Sal: Yes, that's right, but --",
        "Carly: So, I did some research into the area and I have some wonderful designs.",
        "Sal: If you do say so yourself.",
        "Carly: You look like a man who is interested in the cutting edge, huh?",
        "Sal: That's right.",
        "Carly: But the property seems a bit rustic. So, I was thinking of combining the two styles. And I was also thinking about really opening up that area in front, and letting every unit take advantage of that beautiful lake view.",

        "Brad: What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I live here.",
        "Brad: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Katie: I'm picking up Jack. And he lives here.",
        "Brad: You know, that thing you said earlier about me not being a good comedian? That goes double for you two.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Well, Katie and I are going to dinner before Kim's party.",
        "Katie: I missed you.",
        "Jack: I missed you, too. Come on, I spoke to what? A couple of hours ago.",
        "Katie: I know, but now I'm seeing you in person.",
        "Brad: Somebody get me some insulin.",
        "Katie: You don't even start. I should be jumping down your throat right now.",
        "Brad: About what?",
        "Katie: About a little message from Jack that you forgot to give me.",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: Don't think I forgot about it. You only gave me part of it, not the whole thing, to make me think that there was something I had to worry about with Jack and Carly.",
        "Brad: You know, speaking of Carly, I hope you you're going to drop the kids off with her, because I can't baby-sit tonight.",
        "Jack: You got nothing to worry about. Sage and J.J. are staying with the sitter, and Parker is staying with a friend. And what is going on here?",
        "Brad: Well, like, you know, you're always hounding me to do some work around the house and I'm doing it.",
        "Jack: Wh -- you clogged the drain again, didn't you?",
        "Brad: Well, at least I'm trying to fix it, all right? I mean, give me credit for that!",
        "Jack: 20 bucks I'll have to fix what you mess up. Night, Brad.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Wait a -- wait a second. So how was your trip?",
        "Katie: It was really good.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Katie: Got the mystery celebrity to come on the show.",
        "Jack: Outstanding. Not that I'm surprised whatsoever.",
        "Katie: I'm just excited. It's going to be a really good segment.",
        "Jack: Good, I can't wait to see it.",
        "Katie: Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. We're just going to be talking about fashion.",
        "Jack: I'll put it on mute and I'll be staring at you anyway.",
        "Katie: I can live with that.",
        "Brad: Ow!",
        "Jack: No, let him go. He's fine!",
        "Katie: No, no, I need him tonight! I'm just going to see if he's okay. What happened? What? What, what, what?",
        "Brad: I don't ahh -- I just jammed my finger on the pipe. I think I might have broken it.",
        "Katie: You didn't break it. Just put it under -- is the sick fixed?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Katie: Put it under the cold water. It will get the swelling down. Is that better?",
        "Brad: Yeah. It's better all the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey Holden, hi, Meg's going to be very happy to see you --",
        "Holden: Meg.",
        "Meg: I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Holden: I came as soon as I got word.",
        "Meg: Lucinda called you?",
        "Holden: Yeah. We were so worried about you. We had no idea where you were. Any news about Paul?",
        "Craig: Coast guard's still searching.",
        "Meg: Holden, it was horrible. When I got there, he was barely holding on. And then, before I could say a word -- he was gone.",
        "Holden: I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: Did you say anything to anybody about what's going on?",
        "Holden: No one but Jack. And all I told him was that you and Craig were in Canada.",
        "Meg: Okay good, 'cause I don't want Mama to know yet. And then I debated about Barbara, but I didn't want to upset her for no reason. Because they're going to find Paul. I know they will. And as soon as they do, we'll call her after we have confirmation that he's safe.",
        "Holden: You look exhausted. Have you eaten?",
        "Meg: Do you really expect me to think about food?",
        "Craig: I've offered, Holden. She won't take anything. She won't even have a sip of tea.",
        "Holden: Yeah, with good reason, from what Lucinda tells me. You haven't slept, have you? Look, you need to lie down. You need to get some rest.",
        "Meg: Look, I'm fine, okay? I just need some air.",
        "Craig: I don't know what Lucinda told you, Holden, but I'm sure that her version of events are left of what happened.",
        "Holden: I think she's probably right on the money.",
        "Craig: All right, you know what? You want to paint me as the bad guy here, but I'm not. I didn't do anything to Paul. As far as the coast guard? They would have given up that search long ago if I wasn't paying for it.",
        "Holden: And why would you do that? If they wanted to end the search, they must have wanted to do it for a good reason.",
        "Craig: I'm doing it for your sister. Did you happen to get a look at how distraught she is? She wants to find Paul, that's what we're going to do.",
        "Holden: You don't give a damn about Paul Ryan.",
        "Craig: No, but your sister's a different story. I love her, Holden.",
        "Holden: You're using her. Again.",
        "Craig: For what possible purpose?",
        "Holden: I don't know yet. But there must be some reason that you're keeping her hope alive because I saw that cliff and there's no way that Paul could have survived that fall.",
        "Craig: Maybe not, but the fact remains they haven't found him yet, and I am not giving up this search until they do.",
        "Holden: Okay, so what you're really doing is paying the coast guard to hand you a body, so that you can declare your enemy dead at last.",
        "Craig: All right, that is disgusting!",
        "Holden: No, what's disgusting is that you would use my sister's grief as your excuse. How sick can one man be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Will? Will. Wake up, Buddy. Come on, we just lost your sister, we're not going to lose you. Don't move. Just be with me. Stay with me. You hear?",
        "Will: Gwen. Gwen.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to call her, don't worry. Stay with me. Yeah, there's been a car accident, Route 33, just south of Miller's farm. One victim. Barely conscious. Hurry up! Stay with me, Pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will?",
        "Dusty: No, it's Dusty.",
        "Gwen: Dusty? What are you doing with Will's phone?",
        "Dusty: Don't panic. Will's had a car accident.",
        "Gwen: Oh, my God. Is he okay?",
        "Dusty: I think so. His car went off the road. I don't know what happened.",
        "Gwen: Where are you guys? Did you call an ambulance?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's on its way.",
        "Gwen: Can I -- can I talk to him?",
        "Dusty: Maybe you should come down here.",
        "Gwen: Okay, where are you at?",
        "Dusty: Route 33, just south of Miller's farm. Going south. Miller's farm.",
        "Gwen: All right, I'm on my way.",
        "Dusty: Hang on, Buddy. Gwen's coming for ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: With the faded leather against the exposed beams, it's sort of like bringing the outside inside. Like what I've done here. And of course in your case, the effect will be magnified because you have the beauty of that lake.",
        "Sal: Well, I'll hand it to you, your presentation is impressive. You've clearly done a lot of thought about this project.",
        "Carly: But that doesn't mean that I'm not flexible. I really would love your input.",
        "Sal: That wouldn't be necessary.",
        "Carly: I think usually everyone is happier when the client's makes some suggestions. Don't you agree?",
        "Sal: That's right, but as I said --",
        "Carly: And every designer should be prepared to revise ideas. I certainly am.",
        "Sal: Your ideas are fine, it's the rest of the package. Now, here's the thing about me, Ms. Tenney, I like to know the people I'm doing business with.",
        "Carly: Well, I think that you and I are on the same page then. Because I've researched your properties and I'm sure that Lily has told you about my last job.",
        "Sal: The condominium building downtown?",
        "Carly: Right. Yeah, those units sold in just a couple of weeks. And I'm quite proud of that job.",
        "Sal: You partnered with an out-of-town developer on that project, didn't you? Simon Frasier?",
        "Carly: Um, yeah. Yes, but I've worked with a great many people right here in town -- Craig Montgomery, Barbara Ryan, Lisa Grimaldi.",
        "Sal: And if I wanted, say, a little grand larceny done? Whom would I contact?",
        "Carly: I beg your pardon?",
        "Sal: The wonderful thing about the internet, Ms. Tenney, is it doesn't discriminate. Along with that list of references, is a long list of felonies -- fraud, assault, breaking and entering, trespassing, grand larceny. Should I go on?",
        "Carly: No. I think that covers it.",
        "Sal: I'm sorry, but working with you seems like it might be more trouble than it's worth.",

        "Alison: I was not!",
        "Aaron: You were too!",
        "Alison: Was not!",
        "Aaron: So, you cutting off my circulation wasn't fear? That was just coincidence?",
        "Alison: When did I do that?",
        "Aaron: When I did that awesome off-road thing.",
        "Alison: Oh, and we went to the cow pasture. We almost went into a ditch, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Yes, but we didn't and we were fine.",
        "Alison: We were lucky. Could've hit a cow or something.",
        "Aaron: Are you serious?",
        "Alison: What? It is a cow pasture, right?",
        "Aaron: It was dark. What self-respecting cow wanders around in the middle of the night? They're all in the barns. They're all snoring.",
        "Alison: Oh, right, I forgot I'm talking to farm boy.",
        "Aaron: Hold on one minute. Okay, I spent half my life in an urban area where people lived on espresso, okay? Don't call me farm boy.",
        "Alison: That's just the way I remember you when we first met. You were always hanging out in your grandma's barn, being all moody.",
        "Aaron: Well, I liked it there. I still like it there. Like the smell of that hay. And those horse-blankets. And the middle of a thunderstorm, there was nothing like the sound of rain on that roof.",
        "Alison: Don't give me that rain on the roof stuff. You just liked sneaking in there so you could make out with Lucy.",
        "Aaron: I sure did. Hey! I'm just being honest.",
        "Alison: Not about Lucy. That's a sore subject.",
        "Aaron: That was puppy love. You and me, we're -- got something else here.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, I'm not sure how mature we are, since we certainly did fight about a lot of stupid things.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, we had a lot of -- we did a lot of stupid things. Had a lot of stupid fights. But I think we've learned a lot since then.",
        "Alison: Well, if it's true that you learn from your mistakes, I should probably have a masters' degree by now.",
        "Aaron: Will you stop beating yourself up, and eat your ice cream.",
        "Alison: Yes, Sir. Oh, this is so good. I can't even remember the last time I had this.",
        "Aaron: Then it's been too long. I have a theory, you know? The world would be a much better place if people had ice cream at least once a day.",
        "Alison: From farm boy to philosopher. Very impressive.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you don't think so? People spend way too much time saying \"No\" to things these days. You almost said no to a bike ride.",
        "Alison: That's true. And you almost let me get away with it.",
        "Aaron: No, I was prepared to harass you for as long as it took. And I'm glad I did. And this is where you're supposed to say that you're glad that I did, too.",
        "Alison: I thought that was obvious.",
        "Aaron: Did you have a good time tonight?",
        "Alison: Yes, Aaron, I had a good time tonight. Are you happy now?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I haven't had one of those in a long time. But tonight -- tonight I was happy.",
        "Alison: I think it's the sugar.",
        "Aaron: I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Here, just keep that on your hand and the swelling should go down by the time of the party.",
        "Brad: It's good because people are going to, you know, probably want to shake my hand. But, hey, you know, that's what happens when you're the hottest guy in the room.",
        "Katie: Actually, Jack's going to be at the party, so that would make you --",
        "Jack: The second hottest guy in the room.",
        "Brad: Whoa, brother was that a joke? The good humor man is in the building! Whoa!",
        "Jack: Whatever.",
        "Brad: Oh, my bad. The good humor man has left the building. Are you sure you know what you're doing?",
        "Katie: What are you talking about?",
        "Brad: You're the one that said that, you know, this party tonight was about our show and not you and me personally.",
        "Katie: So?",
        "Brad: So how professional is it if you have arm candy when you're supposed to be schmoozing the execs.",
        "Katie: Don't worry your pretty little head, I know how to handle myself. Besides, Jack isn't arm candy, he's my boyfriend -- or my date.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, well, is a date -- is that a step up or step down from boyfriend?",
        "Jack: Okay, you realize you're talking to the intellectually handicapped.",
        "Brad: Well, it's something she started to say, Jack? I'm just trying to clarify.",
        "Katie: You know what, Brad? Don't you get sick of always being jealous of your brother?",
        "Brad: Jealous? Me? Why? Would you tell your girlfriend not to get her panties in her twist? I wasn't trying to upset her.",
        "Jack: No, you wouldn't do anything like that.",
        "Brad: Buddy, I'm sure Katie knows that she has some blind spots.",
        "Katie: And thank God I have you, Brad, to point them out for me.",
        "Brad: You know what? You're right. If you don't care that dragging Jack along might backfire on your career, then why should I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I am paying the coast guard to continue the search because Meg will accept nothing less. And I don't want her to suffer any more than she has to.",
        "Holden: If she's suffering it's because of you! It's all your fault!",
        "Craig: Holden, you have no idea how things played out that led to Paul's accident.",
        "Holden: Accident? You expect me to believe Paul just slipped off those rocks? You lured him there. And then you fought him. Am I wrong?",
        "Craig: You know what? It doesn't matter what I say. You'll think the worst of me anyway.",
        "Holden: This is not about my low opinion of you! A man is dead!",
        "Craig: You know what? I would appreciate it if you'd keep that speculation to yourself. Meg needs to believe that he's alive.",
        "Holden: And you're all too willing to feed her that fantasy, aren't you?",
        "Craig: Has it ever occurred to you it's not a fantasy? Maybe Paul did survive? And why are you so eager to rip away her last shred of hope? I'm just trying to help her.",
        "Holden: Just like you helped her when you offered to give back Lucinda's company back if she married you? You have been using her at every turn and this time is no exception.",
        "Craig: Meg married me of her own free will. And I don't care what you say, I had nothing to do with what happened to Paul.",
        "Holden: Bull. You were threatened by Paul's feelings for Meg since day one. And the closer you got to the wedding, the more worried and jealous you got.",
        "Craig: All right, you know what, this is just ridiculous!",
        "Holden: That's why you practically had to kidnap her to get her here! And then Paul found you and that burned you up. Doesn't take a detective to figure out what really happened.",
        "Craig: What exactly are you accusing me of, Holden?",
        "Holden: You pushed Paul over that cliff! And the only reason you're paying for this search is because you know that he didn't live to tell the truth about what happened!",
        "Meg: Stop it, Holden! I don't want to hear any more.",
        "Holden: Meg, it's time that somebody told the truth here. It might as well be me.",
        "Meg: You don't know what the truth is! So leave Craig alone!",
        "Holden: If I don't know the truth, then tell me, Meg. What really happened?",
        "Meg: I'm not sure. All I know is whatever happened, it's not Craig's fault.",
        "Holden: How can you defend him after everything that he's done?",
        "Meg: You don't understand. Craig tried to save Paul.",
        "Holden: No, no way!",
        "Meg: I saw it! I saw it! Paul was barely hanging on, and Craig tried to pull him up. That's what I told the police.",
        "Craig: What's the matter, Holden? Doesn't jibe with what Lucinda told you?",
        "Meg: Craig has been doing his best to save Paul's life and now he's doing his best to try and find him. I, for one, am grateful.",
        "Holden: Doesn't it matter to you that Craig is the reason that Paul's missing in the first place? Did you forget that after he drugged you?",
        "Meg: I'm perfectly fine now.",
        "Holden: No, you're not. Because the Meg I know would be angry that she was drugged. Angry that Craig lied and lured Paul out to that cliff.",
        "Meg: None of that matters because I was the one that started all this.",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Meg: I was the one that lied, Holden. I married Craig under false pretenses. I let him think Paul and I were over and that was wrong.",
        "Holden: Meg --",
        "Meg: It's okay. Craig knows now. He knows that I've always been in love with Paul.",
        "Holden: And did he find that out before or after Paul fell?",
        "Meg: It doesn't make a difference now.",
        "Holden: Meg, of course it makes a difference. And if you can't see that, it's only because Craig has got you scared and guilty. And he's using that to his advantage!",
        "Craig: Come on now! Who is using who here? My wife has admitted that another man is her lover! I am setting aside my ego to finance a search for him. Now what is in that for me except humiliation?",
        "Holden: A get out of jail free card!",
        "Craig: Holden, I can not tell you what it is you want to hear 'cause I didn't kill Paul! When I found out that I'd been lied to and tricked and made a fool of did I want to have revenge? Yes. Did I want revenge on him? Yes. But I did not push him off that cliff! I did everything that I could to try to save him! And what's more? She saw it!",
        "Holden: What about what she didn't see? She wasn't around to see how you lured Paul out there in the first place.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? That's enough!",
        "Holden: Meg, you're right, it is enough. Get your things. I'm getting you out of here. We're going home.",
        "Meg: No, Holden -- we're not.",

Haven't you ever wanted to better the lives of your children? That's what I want. Please, don't keep me from being someone they can be proud of.",
        "Sal: That's not my call.",
        "Carly: But this -- this partnership between us could be good for both of us. You've said that I have talent. You said that you liked my designs.",
        "Sal: I do, but there are other points to consider.",
        "Carly: No, I don't think there are. Really, all that matters here is whether or not I can give you and your company designs that you want. And we both know that I can. If you just give me a chance, you won't be sorry.",

        "Brad: You see what I mean? That's what I'm talking about. Even if you were burning up, you wouldn't let me put your fire out. You know, big mistake. Big mistake. Just like taking Jack with you to this party tonight.",
        "Jack: Okay, okay, I am going to the party, whether you like it or not, Brad. And I'm seeing Katie, whether you like it or not. And you got a problem with that, too bad.",
        "Brad: No, I don't got with that problem, Jack. I don't got a problem with it Jack! If Katie thinks she can juggle her personal life and her professional life, more power to her.",

        "Brad: The price of being notorious.",
        "Carly: Well, I know my rap sheet. And I don't need some complete stranger listing every thing I've done wrong. Do you have any idea how humiliating it was to hear every time I've so much as jaywalked?",

I promised Paul. I promised Paul that nobody would get hurt. I promised him, and he trusted me. And then when Craig brought me here, Paul had no choice but to follow me. So don't you see? It doesn't matter whether or not Craig was on the cliff with Paul. It was my fault! It was my fault he went over there. He went over that cliff! So, yeah, I have to stand by him, Holden. I have to stand by him, no matter what anybody says.",
