        " Lily: No, wait, wait! No, that lollipop that was on the boat -- it was \r\nmy \r\ndaughter's. The DNA evidence is right here that it was hers. It was her \r\nlollipop. ",
        " Adamski: I understand your frustration, ma'am. ",
        " Lily: The only way that lollipop got on that boat in Wisconsin is if my\r\n\r\nhusband put it there, which proves that they were not involved in that \r\nexplosion, that they're alive! ",
        " Adamski: You could look at it that way, ma'am. ",
        " Lily: You promised me if I found evidence that they were still alive \r\nthat \r\nyou would get the Chicago PD to keep looking for them. And this is it, right \r\nhere in this envelope. ",
        " Adamski: Ma'am, you have to understand, the department looks at things\r\n\r\ndifferently. And what you've shown me is a lollipop -- they're not gonna see \r\nthat as proof of anything. As far as they're concerned, the case is closed. \r\nYour family's not coming home. ",

        " Luke: You read that chapter to Faith the night before we -- before papa\r\n\r\ntook me away with him. ",
        " Holden: You know what you need to do, buddy? You need to try to \r\nthink about how great it's gonna be when we get home and you can tell Faith \r\nall about our adventure stories, okay? ",
        " Luke: It's better than dumb old Pooh Bear. ",
        " Holden: Much better. ",
        " Luke: It's not fair. Papa should have told us these rules. ",

        " Judge: Is it safe to assume the prosecution will object? ",
        " Jessica: Vehemently, your honor. Barbara Ryan is fighting for her life.\r\n\r\nShe may not make it. The defendant is extremely wealthy. He was \r\napprehended at the airport. He clearly poses a substantial flight risk. \r\nTherefore, we respectfully request that the defendant be held without bail. ",
        " Cass: As Ms. Griffin is well aware, my client was leaving on a business\r\n\r\ntrip when he learned of this attack on his wife. He left the airport \r\nimmediately and rushed to his wife's side. ",

        " Lily: Detective, do you have children? ",
        " Adamski: Ma'am, there's nothing I want more than to bring your son and\r\n\r\nhis daddy home, but -- ",
        " Lily: They're alive. They're out there. Please, I need your help. ",
        " Adamski: I've done everything I could, ma'am. I've been to Kenosha, I\r\n\r\nimpounded the boat, dusted for prints -- not a one. ",
        " Lily: That's impossible. ",
        " Adamski: It's a new boat. ",
        " Lily: No, it's impossible because Simon Frasier was there. He was all\r\n\r\nover that boat. His prints -- his prints should have been on it. The boat \r\nowner's prints should have been on it. He obviously rubbed them away. ",
        " Adamski: I talked to the owner. He admits he hosed it down. He's trying\r\n\r\nto sell it. ",
        " Lily: No, he's trying to get rid of the evidence is what he's doing.\r\n",
        " Adamski: Look, ma'am, he was very cooperative. I took his prints, his\r\n\r\nphoto, ran 'em through the computer. The man's never even had a parking \r\nticket. ",
        " Lily: Oh, he's a wonderful person. How does he explain that my \r\ndaughter's lollipop was stuck to the seat of one of his brand-new, never-used\r\n\r\nboats? ",
        " Adamski: Isn't it possible that this Frasier fella could have found \r\nthat \r\nlollipop here in Oakdale, maybe in the backseat of your car? ",
        " Lily: No, he would never do that. I've got DNA. I have DNA evidence \r\nright here. ",
        " Adamski: Ma'am, without a proper chain of custody, there's no way to\r\n\r\nprove that your little girl didn't sneak that lollipop out of this Frasier's \r\npocket \r\nand take a lick. ",
        " Lily: No, the lollipop. The lollipop! That's what started this whole\r\n\r\nthing! My daughter had it at the pediatrician's office. She didn't finish it.\r\n\r\nShe put it in Holden's pocket. ",
        " Adamski: I'm sorry, ma'am. ",
        " Lily: \r\nNo! They're alive. My husband and my son are alive, and I need your\r\n\r\nhelp, please.\r\n",
        " Adamski: Ma'am, I want to help you. I truly do. Even if I had the \r\ndepartment's go ahead, I wouldn't know where to start. ",
        " Lily: I told you, they're with Damian Grimaldi. Did you trace the \r\nnumber that I gave you? ",
        " Adamski: Yes, before it was disconnected, I tracked it to a privately \r\nheld, \r\nforeign company. They haven't responded to any of our inquiries. ",
        " Lily: Damian answered the phone. Damian -- he has my son. He \r\nkidnapped my son and my husband. ",

        " Simon: Yeah, and believe me, once I find her, she will be on her own.\r\n",
        " Rose: I'm just trying to figure something out here. Why are you trying \r\nto \r\nhelp Katie when you're worried about Lily? ",
        " Simon: I thought we were talking about Lucinda. ",
        " Rose: I'll handle Lucinda. She'd probably double that check if she knew\r\n\r\nwhat you were up to. She'd do anything to get you out of town, away from \r\nher daughter. Which brings me back to her daughter. ",
        " Simon: Look, Lily's now got all the proof she needs. The cops can take \r\nit \r\nfrom here. ",
