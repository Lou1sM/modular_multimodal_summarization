        "Emily: You want me to move in? Here? \n",
        "Paul: It doesn't have to be here. If this \r\nplace is to small -- I always thought there weren't enough beds in this place.\r\n",
        "Emily: I can't move in with you. ",
        "Paul: Why not? ",
        "Emily: Because. ",
        "Paul: You need a place to stay. ",
        "Emily: Oh. Oh, so, like roommate. ",
        "Paul: Yeah. Yeah, I want you to be my \r\nroommate. What side of the bed do you want? ",
        "[Emily laughs] ",
        "Emily: Paul, I -- I can't -- ",
        "Paul: I want you to share all my rooms, \r\nEmily. Let's start with this one. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lily: Ah, no, no, no, no. Put the work away. \r\nYou're coming with us. ",
        "Lucinda: I am? ",
        "Lily: Yes. ",
        "Lucinda: Where? ",
        "Lily: To the house. The contractors are \r\nalmost done with the reconstruction. ",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hi, honey. Darling, I'm not \r\ndressed. Anyway, I've seen plenty of houses. ",
        "Lily: You're not up for it? ",
        "Lucinda: I'm waiting for a phone call. \n",
        "Lily: From the doctor? ",
        "Lucinda: From Sturngaard in Stockholm. \n",
        "Lily: Oh. ",
        "Holden: If you wanna stay here with your Mom, \r\nLuke and I can go check on the house. ",
        "Lily: Okay. Maybe that would be best. \n",
        "Luke: No, no, go ahead. I could stay with \r\nGrandma. ",
        "Lily: Wait a minute, I thought you wanted to \r\nsee the house. ",
        "Lucinda: That's a great idea. Why don't you \r\ntwo go and Luke will stay, 'cause we wanna discuss a few of the appointments \r\nthat I'm gonna contribute to his new remodeled room. ",
        "Luke: Right, right, yeah. Educational stuff \r\nI'm sure you'd like, Mom. ",
        "[Lucinda chuckles] ",
        "Lily: Sure. ",
        "Lucinda: You go. ",
        "Lily: Okay. ",
        "Lucinda: Just go and let me spoil my \r\ngrandson, okay? ",
        "Lily: All right, all right, be careful, okay? \r\nI'll see you later. ",
        "Lucinda: Did you see that? ",
        "Luke: They've been doing stuff like that a \r\nlot lately. ",
        "Lucinda: No. ",
        "Luke: Yes. Laughing at each other's dumb \r\njokes. You know, my dad even bought her a gift. He's keeping it a secret. \n",
        "Lucinda: My heavens, isn't that wonderful? \r\nThat's -- well, just a few times -- a little time together, you know, sentiment \r\nand all that -- a few moments in their new former home and those two -- nothing \r\nwill break them apart. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------",
        "[Knocks on door] ",
        "Keith: Hey, Lily, it's -- it's Keith again. \r\nI'm at your house. Looks pretty good, by the way. I miss you. How come you're \r\nnot returning any of my phone calls? Could give a guy a complex. Well, I can't \r\nwait to kiss you hello. Okay, bye. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Casey: Hey, what's up? ",
        "Will: Same old. ",
        "Casey: How's Gwen? I can't even ask about \r\nher? ",
        "Will: Well, it depends on why you're asking.\r\n",
        "Casey: What is your problem? ",
        "Will: Casey, I just came here to have \r\nbreakfast, all right? Not some serious, intense conversation. ",
        "Casey: Cool. I talked to my granddad. \n",
        "Will: About what? ",
        "Casey: He said that you told him you didn't \r\nget Gwen pregnant. And something tells me that that's the real deal. ",
        "Will: Something tells you? Like what? What \r\ntells you? ",
        "Casey: Knowing you. Knowing her. And just, \r\nyou got me to think. I mean, you're a really smart guy. Gwen must be running \r\nsome serious game to get you to take the rap for a kid that's not even yours.\r\n",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Celia: Hi. Did I hear you applying for a job?\r\n",
        "Gwen: Yeah. ",
        "Celia: Did you lose your job at Al's? \n",
        "Gwen: No, no, I'm just looking to double up \r\nright now. I wanna make some extra cash before the baby comes. ",
        "Celia: I thought Will was helping you. \n",
        "Gwen: I don't need any handouts from Will, \r\nall right? I can take care of myself. ",
        "Celia: Did he back out on you? ",
        "Gwen: No. ",
        "Celia: Then let him help you, Gwen. He has a \r\nlot more money than you. And this is his baby, too, whether you two are together \r\nor not. ",
        "Gwen: Is that what you think? That Will and I \r\nwon't be able to stay together? Or is that what you hope? ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Katie: Will you open this, please? \n",
        "Alison: Well, it looks official. You sure \r\nthat you want me to open it? ",
        "Katie: Just open it and tell me it's a tax \r\nbill. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Katie. Did Henry -- did he \r\nsay anything about filing for divorce? ",
        "Katie: Yeah, he told me. It's just, seeing it \r\nin black and white just makes it so final. ",
        "Alison: Well, look on the bright side. I \r\nmean, you and Henry will always be pals, right? ",
        "Katie: Alison, he's filing for a divorce. I \r\nthink, by definition, that means he's not too fond of me. ",
        "Alison: Uh-oh. Well, if there's any hard \r\nfeelings, you have to get a lawyer. ",
        "Katie: I don't need a lawyer. ",
        "Alison: In a divorce, everybody needs a \r\nlawyer. I was waiting on this lady the other day, a divorce attorney, and she \r\ntold me these horror stories. You should call her! ",
        "Katie: No, Alison, really, I don't want a \r\nlawyer. ",
        "Alison: No, I'll go -- wait here, I'll go get \r\nher business card out of the raffle jar. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mike: Hey. Why the long face? ",
        "Jennifer: Stay away from me! ",
        "Craig: Let's go, let's go. ",
        "Jennifer: No, stop. I'm not going anywhere. \r\nStop pushing me. ",
        "Craig: I am not pushing you. ",
        "Jennifer: Craig! ",
        "Dusty: Get away from her. Hey, Craig! \n",
        "Craig: Jennifer, are you all right? \n",
        "Dusty: I said stay away from her. ",
        "Jennifer: I just -- I just need a minute.\r\n",
        "Bob: I know, I agree. You just stay there. \r\nDon't try to get up. ",
        "Kim: I'm gonna get your bag. ",
        "Sierra: How could you do that? You pushed \r\nher. ",
        "Craig: I -- she slipped. Jennifer -- \n",
        "Jennifer: Keep him away from me, please. Just \r\nkeep him away! ",
        "Craig: Jennifer, you know I would never hurt \r\nyou. ",
        "Bob: I want you on the other side of the \r\nroom, right now. ",
        "Craig: All right. ",
        "Dusty: Come on, you heard the doctor. \n",
        "Craig: Yes, all right, all right! I didn't do \r\nanything! ",
        "Kim: Oh, we all saw you. What could you have \r\nbeen thinking, manhandling her that way? She is pregnant. ",
        "Craig: Yes. We were talking, actually. \n",
        "Sierra: No, you grabbed her. ",
        "Craig: No, she was having one of her fits. I \r\ntook her arm so we could speak privately and she slipped, that's all. \n",
        "Bob: Jennifer, can you feel the baby moving?\r\n",
        "Jennifer: No. ",
        "Sierra: He could just be sleeping. Right, \r\nBob? ",
        "Bob: Yeah, that's right. Listen, I'm gonna \r\ntake you to the hospital just to be sure. Now, can you walk? Or do you want me \r\nto call an ambulance? ",
        "Craig: Well, don't move her. If there's any \r\nchance the baby could be hurt. ",
        "Jennifer: I can walk. I don't wanna stay \r\nhere. ",
        "Bob: Okay. There you go, kid. ",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. ",
        "Dusty: You're welcome. Come on, come on.\r\n",
        "Sierra: Wait, wait. Where do you think you're \r\ngoing? ",
        "Craig: I'm gonna go check on my son. \n",
        "Sierra: Stay away from that girl, or I swear, \r\nI will have you arrested. ",
        "Craig: For what? I didn't do anything. \n",
        "Sierra: You threatened to take away her baby. \r\nI heard you. ",
        "Craig: Oh, oh, okay. Did you hear what she \r\nsaid to me? ",
        "Sierra: She's pregnant. And even if she \r\ncalled you every foul name in the book, I mean, who are we kidding? You deserve \r\nit. ",
        "Craig: All right. I have to get to the \r\nhospital, all right? ",
        "Sierra: Stay away from her. ",
        "Craig: I have to check on my son. Now, I can \r\neither go around you, or through you. It's your choice. All right. ",
        "Sierra: Yes, hello, this is Sierra Esteban. \r\nIs Lieutenant Munson there? It's about his daughter. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mike: Are you gonna tell me what's wrong?\r\n",
        "Katie: Nothing. I just haven't had my coffee \r\nyet. I'm fine. How are you? ",
        "Mike: Pretty good. ",
        "Katie: What's going on? ",
        "Mike: I just spoke to Rosanna. ",
        "Katie: About Craig? ",
        "Mike: Yeah. He's been putting pressure on \r\nJennifer. Now that he and Rosanna are married again -- ",
        "Katie: Who saw that coming? ",
        "Mike: Not me. Anyway, Jennifer\u2019s worried that \r\nRosanna would use her money to help Craig get custody of the baby. ",
        "Katie: No, Rosanna wouldn't do that, would \r\nshe? ",
        "Mike: No. It's like I thought. She wants to \r\nsmooth out things with Jennifer and Craig as much as I do. ",
        "Katie: Good. That's good, I want things to \r\nwork out for you guys. I gotta go. ",
        "Alison: I found it. The divorce attorney's \r\nname is Octavia Randolph. ",
        "Mike: You -- you and Henry are getting \r\ndivorced? ",
        "Alison: No. No, no, no, no. I just -- it's \r\njust someone for Katie\u2019s gym membership drive. You know that Octavia. She loves \r\nto pump iron. She's got big biceps. I've gotta go. ",
        "Mike: Katie? ",
        "Katie: Yeah, um, Henry wants a divorce. I got \r\nthe papers this morning. ",
        "Mike: Why did you act like everything was \r\nokay? ",
        "Katie: Because I wish it was. ",
        "Mike: Aw, hey. ",
        "Katie: Don't, don't, don't, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t.\r\n",
        "Mike: What? You're upset. ",
        "Katie: Yes. But, if you start acting like my \r\nfriend and try to consol me, then someone's gonna see and Jennifer\u2019s gonna hear, \r\nand things are gonna get worse than they already are. I know I said that we \r\ncould try to be friends, Mike, but I don't think we can. Especially not now.\r\n",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Celia: I don't have a problem with you and \r\nWill staying together. Why would you even say that? ",
        "Gwen: Look, never mind. ",
        "Celia: Why won't you talk to me? You need \r\nhelp, Gwen. You need friends. Why won't you let me help you? ",
        "Gwen: Look, Will's Mom -- she came down on \r\nme, all right? ",
        "Celia: She did? ",
        "Gwen: She accused me of scamming Will. \r\nSetting him up. ",
        "Celia: Why? This is all Will's fault. \n",
        "Gwen: You've gotta stop doing that. \n",
        "Celia: What? ",
        "Gwen: Blaming him more than you blame me.\r\n",
        "Celia: He got you pregnant. What about using \r\nprotection? What about stopping things before they went too far? ",
        "Gwen: What about not being stupid? Which is \r\nwhat I was that night. Look, as much as I would love not to be the dumb girl who \r\ngot herself knocked up -- whoop, there it is. ",
        "Celia: Still, if you would have told me, I \r\nwould have helped you. ",
        "Gwen: How were you going to help me, Celia? \r\nLook, I've been around. I can handle myself. So, I'm supposed to go to you? Miss \r\nnominated-for-prom-queen, Miss Casey Hughes, Miss living-in-a-mansion? \n",
        "Celia: That's not me. ",
        "Gwen: You're the one wearing the clothes and \r\nliving in the nice house. ",
        "Celia: Gwen, living at Mrs. Walsh's, Oakdale \r\nLatin? That's just fallout from my Mom being Ms. Esteban's housekeeper. Even \r\nCasey. Sometimes I wonder if he's dating that girl. That girl whose life I'm \r\nliving, when really he's dating you. ",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about? ",
        "Celia: I'm just like you are. On my own, \r\ntrying getting by, trying to make something out of nothing. A lot of the time \r\nI'm scared. ",
        "Gwen: Me, too. ",
        "Celia: Then talk to me. I know there's \r\nsomething not right about Will, about you getting pregnant. You can tell me \r\nanything. ",
        "Gwen: I wish I could. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Will: I'm sick of talking about this. The \r\nbaby's mine. Nothing's gonna change that. ",
        "Casey: So there's, like, no possibility at \r\nall that the baby isn't yours? ",
        "Will: Well, who else's would it be, Casey?\r\n",
        "Casey: I don't know. But I'm just saying, a \r\ngirl like Gwen, who knows how many other guys she's hooked up with? ",
        "Will: Well, I don't know. Do you know? \n",
        "Casey: What do you mean? ",
        "Will: I mean, these other guys. Do they have \r\nnames? ",
        "Casey: I'm not narcing anybody, okay? \n",
        "Will: All right, thanks anyway. But the \r\nbaby's my responsibility. ",
        "Casey: Then why did you tell Granddad that?\r\n",
        "Will: Well, I was embarrassed at first, you \r\nknow? Wouldn't you be? ",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess. But, there has to be a \r\nway out of this. You don't wanna wreck your whole life. ",
        "Will: What are you trying to say? ",
        "Casey: I'm trying to say that there's gotta \r\nbe a way to stop this before it's too late. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lucinda: I will try to honestly answer any \r\nquestions you wanna ask me. What do you want to know? ",
        "Luke: About the cancer? ",
        "Lucinda: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Luke: Did it -- does it hurt? Where they \r\nremoved the tumor or whatever? ",
        "Lucinda: No. No, it doesn\u2019t. Well, not \r\nreally. You know what hurts? Waiting. It's the waiting to hear what stage -- \r\nthere are four stages. One, two, three, and then -- ",
        "[Lucinda laughs] ",
        "[Lucinda sighs] You know, you could kiss me. \r\nIt's not catching. Oh, honey, thanks. Aww. ",
        "Luke: Well, while you're waiting for the \r\nphone to ring, maybe we could shoot some hoops or something. I'll spot you some \r\npoints. ",
        "Lucinda: You're much too generous. I mean, \r\nyou're too kind. ",
        "Luke: Well, you taught me to hedge odds in my \r\nfavor, so -- ",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. ",
        "Luke: You are gonna be okay, right? \n",
        "Lucinda: I sure am. I'm not gonna let some \r\nvagabond cells shoot my shots for me. I'm -- it's still me here. And anyway, \r\nwe've got work to do on your parents. ",
        "Luke: You think we can get them back \r\ntogether? ",
        "Lucinda: Minimally, I think we can finagle a \r\nlittle, few private moments. ",
        "Luke: Yeah, there's still a little work that \r\nneeds to be done on the house. Dad told Mom that he'd take her to some antique \r\nshops in the truck. Do some heavy lifting. ",
        "Lucinda: That's wonderful. All right. It just \r\nneeds some time. And now that Keith Morrissey is away, and I still don't like \r\nKeith Morrissey, okay? They have that time. [Phone rings] All right, I think \r\nthat's my -- my call. [Doorbell rings] All right. Ah, and the doorbell. \n",
        "Luke: Want me to get that? ",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. The maid will get it. \r\nDarling, this is gonna be short. I'll be right back. Don't drink all the green \r\ntea. ",
        "Luke: What are you doing here? ",
        "Keith: Hey, Luke, how you doin'? I'm back \r\nfrom Chicago. I'm here to stay. Is your mother around? ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: I -- I cannot move in with you. \n",
        "Paul: Why not? ",
        "Emily: Because I have a little boy to think \r\nabout. ",
        "Paul: I really like Daniel. ",
        "Emily: He likes you, too. But Hal, you know, \r\nhas been like a father to him most of his life. And it's gonna be hard enough on \r\nDaniel now that my marriage is over. I can't bring him into this. Whatever this \r\nis. ",
        "Paul: Do you need for our relationship to be \r\nmore formalized? Is that what you\u2019re saying? ",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa, like marriage? No, no, no, \r\nno, no. No. No. ",
        "Paul: Okay, I heard the first no. ",
        "Emily: No, no. ",
        "Emily: No, no. Come on, you know what I mean. \r\nYou gotta feel the same way. I mean, this has all happened very fast. \n",
        "Paul: Yeah. ",
        "Emily: And Rosanna -- Rosanna just got \r\nmarried. ",
        "Paul: I know. I practically caught the \r\nbouquet. ",
        "Emily: So you're on the rebound. ",
        "Paul: Is that what you think? ",
        "Emily: I don't know, isn't it? ",
        "Paul: I'm trying to figure out what this is, \r\nalso. And every time I think about the future -- ",
        "Emily: You freak? ",
        "Paul: Yeah, I do. Don't you? ",
        "Emily: Yeah. ",
        "Paul: So, maybe we shouldn't think about the \r\nfuture. Maybe we should just be. ",
        "Emily: That's impossible. ",
        "Paul: Why? Right now, today. That's all we've \r\ngot. Maybe that's all we need. The past hasn't been good to either one of us. \r\nAnd the future, well, by definition, hasn't happened yet. Be here -- right now.\r\n",
        "Emily: You have the most beautiful eyes.\r\n",
        "Paul: See, I think you do. ",
        "Emily: And then there's that. The way you're \r\nalways complimenting me, making me feel so good. ",
        "Paul: You know, I like your neck, too. \n",
        "Emily: Oh, God, here we go. Oh, stop. Oh, \r\nstop, you can make me forget my name, but I will not forget that I have a little \r\nboy to think about. What about Daniel? ",
        "Paul: Who's Daniel? Daniel's not here right \r\nnow. ",
        "Emily: I know. ",
        "Paul: Where is Daniel? ",
        "Emily: He's at Tom\u2019s. He needed to be \r\nsomewhere stable while Hal and I are dealing with the separation. ",
        "Paul: And after that? ",
        "Emily: And after that, he's off for \r\nsleep-away camp for two whole weeks. I've heard those words, like, a gazillion \r\ntimes. ",
        "Paul: See, I like the sound of that. Two \r\nwhole weeks. ",
        "Emily: Yeah? ",
        "Paul: Yeah, we could have our own little \r\nsleep-away camp. ",
        "Emily: And after that? ",
        "Paul: After that is in the future. \n",
        "Emily: Do we have a future? ",
        "Paul: We've got two whole weeks to figure \r\nthat out. Wanna figure it out? ",

        "Luke: My Mom is not here right now. \n",
        "Keith: Do you know where she is? ",
        "Luke: She had some stuff to do. ",
        "Keith: Well, I stopped by the farm, and the \r\nbabysitter said she was coming here. ",
        "Luke: She was here. But then she took off. \r\nWith my dad. They went back home with each other, to our house. ",
