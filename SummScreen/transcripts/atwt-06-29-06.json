        "Casey and Margo are confused by Maddie's strange behavior, while Dallas sits quietly by. Holden goes to see Damian about Luke coming home and letting him know he knows he is connected to the Kreeger Foundation, as Ross listens secretly from the other room. Damian tells Ross how to handle Holden. Ross meets with Holden and tells him Lily introduced him to Luke, and insinuates Luke is the only one to blame for Lily's fall. Luke unbelievably opens up to Jade when he explains how and why Lily fell down the stairs. Surprisingly, Jade offers genuine advice, with nothing for her to gain, when she pushes Luke to talk to his dad. Dusty rushes Jen to the hospital where he finds out Lucy released Jen when medically she shouldn't have. Lucy is wracked with guilt over not trying harder to keep Jen in the hospital. Maddie and Casey try to get some alone time on the rooftop before they go to find a motel, but when Casey kisses her, Maddie has some flashes, freaks out and tells Casey she is breaking up with him. Damian manipulates Luke into staying with him and away from Lily when he implies to Luke that Holden doesn't want him around; an emotional Luke ends up believing him. Bob tells Jen's stunned family that her viral pneumonia has turned into Cardiomyopathy \u0096 heart failure. They are desperately trying to treat her, but if her tissues and organs don't get enough blood, her body will begin to shut down. Jen tells Dusty she can't wait to go home and to be with him and Johnny, unaware of how serious her condition is."

        "Casey: That's so weird. Maddie knew I needed a ride. Why would she just leave like that? Are you sure she said she was waiting for me in the car?",
        "Dallas: Positive.",
        "Margo: She did seem way too jumpy. Something going on between you two?",
        "Casey: No, everything's fine.",
        "Margo: Are you sure?",
        "Casey: Mom, it's no big deal. We probably just got our signals crossed or she got a call about something and had to check it out.",
        "Margo: Oh man, you're gonna take my car aren't you?",
        "Casey: Well you're in for the night, right?",
        "Margo: I guess I am now. One scratch and I own you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. Truth is, she just can't handle the fact that I'm a better driver than she is. See you later.",
        "Dallas: Hey, he seems like a good kid. He really a better driver than you though?",
        "Margo: No, I taught him everything he knows. And you are trying to distract me.",
        "Dallas: Ah, you got me.",
        "Margo: So what you're saying is -- lighten up, cut him some slack?",
        "Dallas: Well, sort of.",
        "Margo: Well I would agree, but you don't know Casey very well do you? And still Maddie just seemed way too jumpy. Something is going on.",
        "Dallas: I'll have to trust you on that. I just got here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Why would Dallas Griffin come to Oakdale? Why? Casey, I can explain.",
        "Casey: I hope so. Did you change your mind about us getting a room tonight?",
        "Maddie: No, it's not that.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I meant what I said. If you're not ready, it's okay. Just tell me what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Damian. I need to see Luke.",
        "Ross: Who's that?",
        "Damian: Holden Snyder.",
        "Ross: Lily's husband.",
        "Damian: I'll deal with him. You can wait in there.",
        "Ross: I'm not going to hide like a criminal, Damian.",
        "Damian: We need to keep the fireworks to a minimum, Ross. The last person Holden Snyder should see right now is you. Now please.",
        "Holden: Luke? Are you here?",
        "Damian: Now, Ross. Hey, come on in Holden. Make yourself at home.",
        "Holden: The door was open. Where's Luke?",
        "Damian: He's not here right now.",
        "Holden: I heard you talking to someone.",
        "Damian: Yeah, yeah, one of the painters. I'm having some of the guest bedrooms redone.",
        "Holden: Huh -- well, how long is Luke planning to stay here?",
        "Damian: That's his choice really. He knows he's welcome to live here for as long as he wants.",
        "Holden: Just tell me where he is.",
        "Damian: I'm afraid I couldn't say right now.",
        "Holden: Okay, so when's he going to be back?",
        "Damian: I don't know.",
        "Holden: All right, just tell him that I'm looking for him.",
        "Damian: I'll let him know you stopped by. But you should know, Luke really doesn't want to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Luke. Hey. You don't have to avoid me every single time we run into each other.",
        "Luke: I'm pretty much trying to avoid the whole world right now.",
        "Jade: I heard about your mom. Is she doing any better?",
        "Luke: Not really. She's still in a coma.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: Yeah, me too.",
        "Jade: This really must be tearing you up.",
        "Luke: You don't know the half of it. Look, I got to go.",
        "Jade: Wait, wait, wait. Why don't you sit and talk for a second. You look like you're about to explode.",
        "Luke: That's because I've made a mess out of everything.",
        "Jade: What are you talking about? It's not your fault your mom's in the hospital.",
        "Luke: Yes it is. You were right, Jade. I should've just kept my mouth shut about being gay. If I had, none of this would've happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Dusty, it would be safer if you waited for the ambulance.",
        "Dusty: No. Look at her. I'm going to the hospital now. Somebody's got to stay with Johnny.",
        "Paul: We'll take care of Johnny.",
        "Meg: Yeah, we'll take care of him. Go.",
        "Paul: Take care of Jennifer.",
        "Meg: I'm a nurse, Dusty. I've been taking care of people almost all my life. Johnny will be fine, I promise.",
        "Dusty: I'll call you from the hospital.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[Johnny crying]",
        "Meg: Oh, you poor baby. Oh, you just got home after being so sick, and now your mommy's going back to the hospital.",
        "Paul: You think maybe he's hungry?",
        "Meg: Could be.",
        "Paul: Ah? That fell on the floor. You need to wash the nipple.",
        "Paul: Okay. There, how about that?",
        "Meg: You know what? I think you need to feed him.",
        "Paul: You think? Come here.",
        "Meg: There you go. Yeah.",
        "Paul: Come here. [Johnny crying] No, it's okay. It's alright.",
        "Meg: There you go. You're a natural. You'll do great.",
        "Paul: We'll do great. You think Jen's all right?",
        "Meg: She came home from the hospital too soon. They're going to bump up her antibiotics and if she listens to doctors this time, she'll be fine. Don't worry okay.",
        "Paul: Okay. [Knock on the door] Can you get that?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Will: Oh, hi. Jen said we could bring over some welcome home presents. What are you doing with Johnny? Where's Jen?",
        "Paul: I think you two should come on in.",
        "Gwen: Is something wrong?",
        "Will: Yeah, obviously. What the hell's going on, Paul?",
        "Paul: Well, we've got something to tell you.",
        "Meg: We have some bad news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I need a doctor!",
        "Lucy: What happened?",
        "Dusty: She's having a hard time breathing -- she's barely conscious.",
        "Lucy: Okay. Take her to cubicle one. I need you to get some oxygen for her and call Dr. Hughes.",
        "Dusty: Okay, Red. It's okay, Sweetheart. [Jennifer gasps] You're at the hospital, now. They're going to take care of you.",
        "Lucy: I need to know everything that happened.",
        "Dusty: She was weak, feverish, out of breath.",
        "Lucy: When did you notice that she was having difficulty breathing?",
        "Dusty: About an hour ago? I walked into the room, she was on the floor.",
        "[Jennifer gasps]",
        "Bob: What's going on?",
        "Dusty: I think she had a relapse. I just brought her back in.",
        "Bob: You brought her back? She was released?",
        "Lucy: Her pulse is erratic.",
        "Bob: Get her on a monitor right away. I want a portable chest x-ray stat. Blood gasses and an EKG. Dusty, you're going to have to wait outside so we can do what we have to do.",
        "Dusty: Yes, sir. She's going to be all right, isn't she?",
        "Bob: I'll let you know as soon as I get the results of those tests. I'm still trying to understand how she left the hospital in the first place. She was discharged?",
        "Dusty: Yes sir, this morning.",
        "Bob: I didn't authorize that. Who signed the papers?",
        "Lucy: I did. I was the one who let her leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: It's like -- my whole world came crashing down around me, ever since I came out.",
        "Jade: How?",
        "Luke: My mom just couldn't accept it. She got so freaked out, that she hired this jerk to come and try take me away to some scared straight camp.",
        "Jade: You're kidding.",
        "Luke: No, I'm not. My mom wanted them to de-program me out of being gay.",
        "Jade: Doesn't sound like something Lily would do.",
        "Luke: My dad doesn't think so either. But why would I lie about something like this? My mom was the one who introduced me to the guy. My dad doesn't know anything about it.",
        "Jade: She did say you weren't going to be around for this summer.",
        "Luke: See?",
        "Jade: Yeah, but what does this have to do with your mom's accident? Why did you say it was your fault?",
        "Luke: I got so mad that she was trying to ship me out of town. I felt like she didn't want me around. And I -- I lost it.",
        "Jade: You got into a fight?",
        "Luke: Yeah. And then I was trying to leave -- she reaches out to me, and I knock her hands away. We were at the top of the stairs and -- she fell.",
        "Jade: Oh, Luke.",
        "Luke: I put my own mother in a coma.",
        "Jade: It was an accident.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it was still my fault.",
        "Jade: I can't believe that anybody really blames you.",
        "Luke: Are you kidding me? My dad hates me right now. He doesn't want me hanging around the hospital. I can't even see my own mom.",
        "Jade: That doesn't sound like Holden.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, it's true. I'm sure you're really torn up about this.",
        "Jade: Believe it or not, I am. And I'm suspicious, too.",
        "Luke: Suspicious? About what?",
        "Jade: You might be too close to see it, but there is something wrong with this picture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What are you talking about? I don't believe for one second that my son wouldn't want to see me.",
        "Damian: Believe what you want. All I know is what Luke has said to me. He thinks you blame him for Lily's accident.",
        "Holden: I don't blame people for accidents. Especially not my son.",
        "Damian: I'm just giving you Luke's perception. He feels rejected, especially after the way you reacted when Lily had the seizure. You told Luke he never should've walked into her room.",
        "Holden: I wasn't judging Luke. I was just trying to do what's best for my wife.",
        "Damian: I'm sure you were. I'm not pointing fingers Holden. I'm just saying that to Luke, it felt like, you didn't trust him around his own mother. I mean how -- imagine how hard that must be to hear.",
        "Holden: Thanks for that, I appreciate that. But let me tell you this, I am on to you. And I have been ever since you came back to town. I know exactly what you're up to. You're trying to manipulate my son. You're planting ideas in his head, you're trying to turn him against me. And that is going to stop. It's gonna stop right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, Hal Munson is tough, but he's fair. You do right by him, he'll treat you like a son.",
        "Dallas: Cross him and my days are numbered?",
        "Margo: Cross him, your days are over.",
        "Dallas: I'll take your word for it.",
        "Margo: Okay. [Doorbell rings] Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Jessica: Sorry that took so long. I got held up with Judge Dunne.",
        "Margo: Ow!",
        "Jessica: But I wanted to stop and get dessert and I threw in a couple of cupcakes for Daniel for when he gets back from Chicago.",
        "Margo: You are too sweet. You didn't have to do that.",
        "Jessica: It was my pleasure. So what do we got? Ah, Chinese. Great. I'm starving. So, has my nephew been boring you with details from the police academy?",
        "Margo: Not in the least. I've been boring him with details of Oakdale PD. But listen -- you gotta understand that life in Oakdale is going to seem mighty provincial compared to living in Chicago.",
        "Dallas: I welcome the change.",
        "Jessica: You know he keeps saying that, but you're too young to want a simpler life, so -- if I didn't know better, I'd think you were running away from something. Or someone.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, right.",
        "Margo: Ah -- all right, Dallas. Give us the scoop. Whose heart did you break in the windy city?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Maddie: Hey, you scared me.",
        "Casey: Sorry.",
        "Maddie: I forgot how beautiful the city looks from up here.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's a pretty amazing view. It's a good place to come if you're running from something.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Casey: So are you?",
        "Maddie: Am I what?",
        "Casey: Running from something? Like me, maybe.",
        "Maddie: No. I just got weirded out, when I saw your mom, that's all.",
        "Casey: Sorry I didn't tell you she got back sooner. I didn't know.",
        "Maddie: It's okay. I wanted to wait but --",
        "Casey: You don't have to explain. It's cool.",
        "Maddie: I don't know -- I got there and just the way she was looking at me. It was like she had this cop ESP or something. And I was positive she knew what we were planning on doing tonight.",
        "Casey: My mom has this weird way of making you feel like you're always guilty of something. But I don't think she knew what we were planning. Are we still planning it? Do you still want to go?",
        "Maddie: Can we just, sit here for a while? It's pretty. And private.",
        "Casey: Yeah, okay.",
        "Maddie: So?",
        "Casey: So, what?",
        "Maddie: Are you just going to sit there? Or are you going to kiss me? 3",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: It's easy to blame me for Luke's reaction. And I expected you to feel this way. But believe me, I did not try to influence Luke in any way.",
        "Holden: Of course you'd say that.",
        "Damian: We want the same thing, Holden. To protect a boy that we both love very much.",
        "Holden: No, you want to alienate him from me.",
        "Damian: It's not about you, or me. It's about him.",
        "Holden: That's right. And if I've hurt him, then I need to make things right.",
        "Damian: Have you considered that perhaps it's too late for that?",
        "Holden: Nothing has happened that can't be repaired. I made mistakes, but Luke will understand, he's worried about his mother.",
        "Damian: Luke is never going to believe that you don't blame him for what happened to her.",
        "Holden: We don't really know what exactly did happen to her, do we? And I'm going to get to the bottom of it. The police are on it, Damian, and I'm just waiting for your name to come up.",
        "Damian: My name?",
        "Holden: In connection with Kreeger and his foundation.",
        "Damian: You're looking for conspiracies that don't exist.",
        "Holden: Oh, they exist! And they will come out. In the mean time, if you have any decency at all, you'll tell Luke that I don't blame him for what happened to his mother, and that I want him to come back home.",
        "Ross: He's a very determined man. I don't see him letting go of any of this until he has the answers he's looking for.",
        "Damian: Then let's give him something to shut him up. There's only one way to get him and the cops off your back.",
        "Ross: I'm listening.",
        "Damian: Take out your cell phone out. This is Holden's phone number. Call him. Tell him you need to talk to him.",
        "Ross: What good will that do?",
        "Damian: A great deal, if you do exactly what I say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I've seen first-hand how much both your parents love you. It's not something that's going to disappear because of a bad accident.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you didn't see the look in my dad's eyes.",
        "Jade: Holden was scared. But he's not going to turn his back on you or anyone else in his family. He's the kind of dad we all wish we had.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Jade: You have to go talk to him. Look, we all do and say things that we regret later. I know that better than anybody. But, usually there is a way to make amends as long as you really want to.",
        "Luke: I don't know, Jade --",
        "Jade: I do. Look, go find your dad. Don't let some stupid misunderstanding keep you from being with them. You need them. And they need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I just saw her last night. I didn't even know she was sick.",
        "Paul: Well she collapsed after you left. Nobody knew.",
        "Will: So, you guys have been here all night?",
        "Paul: No, she was released this morning.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but it was too soon.",
        "Will: How is that possible?",
        "Meg: Well, she insisted on coming home to be with Johnny and they couldn't forcibly keep her. But it was too soon. The pneumonia was still only in the acute stage.",
        "Paul: Which is why she just collapsed again. Dusty took her to the hospital.",
        "Meg: We decided to stay here and take care of Johnny.",
        "Will: Well has he called?",
        "Paul: No, not yet.",
        "Gwen: Why don't you let me take care of him and you guys can go to the hospital and check on Jen?",
        "Meg: We promised Dusty we'd stay.",
        "Gwen: He'll be fine with me. I mean, I took care of him for a few months, remember?",
        "Paul: Yeah, Meg, I think it's okay. We check on Jennifer's status right now.",
        "Will: And I'm sure Dusty's going to understand.",
        "Meg: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Great. Look if you need anything it's probably in the nursery.",
        "Gwen: Don't worry, I'll find everything I need. You guys go be with Jen.",
        "Will: You're the best.",
        "Gwen: Call me when you get a chance.",
        "Will: I will as soon as I know anything.",

        "Gwen: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you remember me? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You knew that Jennifer wasn't ready to leave the hospital?",
        "Lucy: I tried my best to convince her to stay. But she categorically refused.",
        "Dusty: You're an intern. Why is she making these decisions anyway?",
        "Lucy: I couldn't tie Jennifer to the bed. In the end, all I could do was make a note on her chart that she left against medical advice.",
        "Bob: Lucy, we'll deal with this later. Right now, the important thing is to get Jennifer stabilized. Excuse me.",
        "Dusty: Why did you let her leave? When she was so sick?",
        "Lucy: I did everything I could. But she wouldn't listen.",
        "Dusty: Lucy, you should have called me.",
        "Lucy: You weren't my patient. Jennifer was.",
        "Dusty: I know. Her health is at stake --",
        "Lucy: I'm under an obligation to respect my patient's wishes. But I feel terrible, Dusty. Because I was afraid this would happen.",
        "Dusty: If you were afraid, you should've come to me. Why didn't you?",
        "Lucy: Because Jennifer begged me not to.",

        "Casey: Maddie, what's --",
        "Maddie: This isn't working.",
        "Ross: Police were asking about a connection between Mr. Grimaldi and the Kreeger foundation.",
        "Holden: And according to you there isn't one.",
        "Ross: Well, we've checked our records thoroughly and as I've told the police I've never met the man.",
        "Holden: You're lying.",
        "Bob: If her tissues and her organs don't get enough blood, I'm afraid her body will begin to shut down.",

        "Damian: There you are. Where are your things?",
        "Luke: Out in the car.",
        "Damian: Let's go.",
        "Luke: No. I'm not -- I'm not sure that I'm staying.",
        "Damian: Why, why -- I thought we agreed it was best for everyone.",
        "Luke: I know. I know. But I'm having some second thoughts.",
        "Damian: About what, exactly?",
        "Luke: Well, I really think that I should talk to my dad. I think maybe he needs me as much as I need him right now.",
        "Damian: Even after the way he's treated you?",
        "Luke: Well, he was freaking out about my mom. But now that some time has past, I think maybe we can work things out. I don't want my mom to wake up and see that her family's been ripped apart.",
        "Damian: I think you're being a little too idealistic, Luke.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm willing to take that chance. Hey, but I want to thank you for everything. You -- you really stepped up and helped me out, and I didn't expect that. And I really -- I appreciate that. But I need to go and fix things with my dad.",
        "Damian: He was just here.",
        "Luke: Dad?",
        "Damian: Yeah. We had a long talk. Before you head off to fix things, I think you should know what he had to say. .",

        "Holden: Ross Kreeger.",
        "Ross: Correct.",
        "Holden: Have a seat. I'm gonna get right to the point. I want to know what the hell you were trying to do to my son.",
        "Ross: Uh, well, your son and I had a conversation about a summer camp run by my foundation.",

        "Ross: Well, if you knew what we really accomplish, you wouldn't be so quick to judge.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm entitled to judge, Mr. Kreeger. You came into my home, where you tried to trick my son into being brainwashed. You took advantage of his youth, his confusion. And even though you weren't there when my wife fell, you're partially responsible for what happened to her.",
        "Ross: Well, I had no knowledge of your wife's fall until a few hours ago. But Detective Snyder from the police department told my assistant about it. Is he a relative of yours?",
        "Holden: Do you want to tell me why you were inside my house?",
        "Ross: I was invited there by your wife. She wanted me to meet Luke, fill him in on the summer program. I had no intention of taking him anywhere unless he wanted to go.",
        "Holden: That's now how Luke tells the story. Who put you up to this?",
        "Ross: I just told you. Your wife asked me to speak with your son.",
        "Holden: What about Damian Grimaldi? I suppose you're gonna tell me that that name means nothing to you?",
        "Ross: No, no, quite the contrary. I know exactly who Damian is.",

        "Lucy: Oh, Holden's sister. You used to live out west somewhere?",
        "Meg: Yeah, Texas. Texas. You know, when I came back to Oakdale, I got a job here as a nurse at Memorial. And I just want to tell you that I've been in your shoes, and I know you probably tried really hard to make Jennifer stay.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, thank you for understanding. But obviously, I should have tried a little harder. I have to go check on a patient.",

        "Gwen: It was -- it was bad. And then finding out that my baby died -- I was pretty much a mess for a while. I even tried to push Will away. But he wouldn't give up on me.",
        "Jade: He loves you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. We even talked about having another baby right away, but that didn't happen, and it's not going to.",

        "Holden: You're lying.",
        "Ross: Look, Mr. Snyder, I know you're upset. And I see this countless times. One parent contacts me without telling the other parent. Sometimes, they're just testing the waters. But sometimes, they're afraid for the other parent to find out.",
        "Holden: My wife and I, we have no secrets.",
        "Ross: Well, it's not my place to judge that. All I can say is your wife came to me concerned about her son's future, looking for some kind of help. Now, if you have a conflict with this, it seems to me you need to be discussing it with your wife, not with me.",
        "Holden: Well, unfortunately, I can't do that. She's unconscious, thanks in very large part to you.",
        "Ross: I don't understand. I was having a conversation with Luke. Your wife came home, asked me to leave. I did. Now, whatever caused her to fall down those stairs happened well after I was gone. I do now wish I had stayed a little bit longer. Maybe the accident could have been avoided.",
        "Holden: You got a pretty smooth line there, mr. Kreeger, and it might work on some people. But I'm not buying it.",

        "Holden: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Ross: When I left, Luke was furious with her, and with me. He completely misunderstood our intentions. He was irrational and agitated.",
        "Holden: I don't blame him for being upset.",

        "Luke: What aren't you telling me?",

        "Damian: Look, I'm just giving you my sense of the situation. I could be wrong.",
