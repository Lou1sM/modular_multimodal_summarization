        "Molly arrived in Montana for Jack and Carly's nuptials. Rosanna said it was bad luck for Jack and Carly to sleep together on the eve of their wedding. It was decided that the women would sleep in the house, while the men would sleep outside. Mike shared his sleeping bag with Parker, which forced Jack to share with Craig. Craig and Jack teased each other, to the great amusement of Mike and Parker, until Jack and Mike switched places. Inside the cabin, after many hugs and apologies, the girls bonded over wine and girl talk. They discussed honeymoons, and toasted to true love. Back in Oakdale, Rick's heart was re- started, and he was rushed to ICU. Allison and Emily discussed their mutual suspicion of Rick, but changed their minds after hearing of his attack. Hal questioned Chris and Gordo about their whereabouts at the time of the attack, and also asked Allison if she had seen them. Since neither intern had an alibi, he told John that both should be relieved of duties until the killer is found. He then ordered Allison to stay away from the hospital, but neither she nor Emily liked his tone. The fake Agent Brackett told Dusty he intended to push Dusty out after their plane took off, but Margo managed to stop the flight. Back at the police station, Margo and Dusty had to restrain Holden when he tried to attack \"Brackett.\" He offered the \"agent\" money for information about the twins, but \"Brackett\" insisted he had what he wanted: the knowledge that Holden and Dusty would never see the girls again. He finally admitted that Stenbeck would kill him if he talked."

        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey, Parker, how was horseback riding?",
        "Craig: Wanna go in? Okay.",
        "Katie: Is he okay?",
        "Craig: Okay? This fella's a natural-born cowpoke.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. I think he wants to tell his mother all about it. I'm going to go check on Carly and the baby.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Rosanna: Oh -- ride 'em, cowboy.",
        "Katie: Ay-yi-yi.",
        "Craig: Well, that looks comfortable. If you're a groundhog.",
        "Mike: You know what? We got a big day tomorrow. Let's just get some rest. Jack and Carly are getting married.",
        "Craig: Where are you going to sleep?",
        "Mike: Next to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Parker was fearless. It was like he'd been riding his entire life.",
        "Carly: Oh, good for you, honey. Let me see your hands. Oh, my goodness. That must've been a very dirty little pony. You think you should wash up?",
        "Parker: But I already did.",
        "Carly: You already did? Well, I suggest you do it again. And this time turn on the water, and use the soap.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Carly: Rub your hands together. Oh, thanks for taking him, Rosanna. It gave me a chance to finish my dress for tomorrow.",
        "Rosanna: It's no problem.",
        "Jack: Carly? I think Sage is hungry.",
        "Carly: And how do you know that, Jack?",
        "Jack: Well, she just about devoured my finger. Here, I'll get the bed ready while you feed her, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay. Oh, hi, little lady.",
        "Jack: You know, it's just about time, Rosanna, that we call it a night. Carly's gonna need to rest for tomorrow.",
        "Rosanna: Don't tell me the two of you are sleeping here tonight?",
        "Jack: That was the general plan, yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's the night before your wedding. It's bad luck to sleep under the same roof, let alone under the same covers.",
        "Jack: You know what else is bad luck, Rosanna? Bringing up superstitions nobody believes in.",
        "Carly: No. Actually, Jack, I think that Rosanna might be on to something here. I think she might be right.",
        "Jack: But -- Carly -- where am I supposed to go?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I have an idea. Why don't all the women sleep in the cabin, and the men, like manly men, can sleep out on the porch? Doesn't that sound like fun?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Well, it does to me, Jack. And that's exactly what's going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but I can't face spending another night at Mom's house while Rick's living here. I just keep having these thoughts, Emily. Well, what if he's the killer, and he just murders us in our sleep?",
        "Emily: Oh, honey. I have to admit -- I've had the same awful thoughts. I even tried talking to Mom about it.",
        "Alison: What did you say? \"You're living with Rick the Ripper\"? \"You better get out before he strikes again\"?",
        "Emily: No, I just -- you know, I tried to tell her that maybe Rick is keeping something from her. But she slammed into her \"stand by your man\" speech, and that was the end of it.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's what I figured. So, can I stay with you and Hal? If you can't save Mom, you might as well save me.",
        "Emily: Honey, she will hate that idea. She'll feel like the two of us are turning against her.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, then make it sound like you need me for something. To baby-sit Daniel, to paint the house --",
        "Emily: Paint the -- Ali, she's gonna know I'm lying.",
        "Alison: It's still better than finding me slaughtered by Rick Decker. I have to get away from him, Emily, or I'm going to be forced to sleep with my eyes open for the rest of my life!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: Clear!",
        "Susan: He's not responding.",
        "Walker: Recharge.",
        "Susan: Charge.",
        "Walker: Clear!",
        "Susan: Oh, Rick. Oh, thank God. You're going to be okay.",
        "Walker: Take him to ICU. Check his blood, all levels. He received a shot of potassium chloride.",
        "Susan: Don't give up. Just keep fighting. Well, you must feel pretty foolish.",
        "Walker: Excuse me?",
        "Susan: You made no secret of the fact that you suspected Rick of committing those murders. What do you have to say for yourself now? Now that he's become a victim himself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brackett: Take a seat.",
        "Dusty: Where are Lily and Rose?",
        "Brackett: How should I know?",
        "Dusty: Because you're in on it. You gotta be. Your timing -- it's too good.",
        "Brackett: You want to stand, that's your business.",
        "Dusty: Well, you're not FBI, that's for sure. Who are you?",
        "Brackett: I'm a friend of James Steinbeck. I owed him a favor. He found a way for me to repay him.",
        "Dusty: By killing Spangler, Mccann, Stanley? Maybe Lily and Rose?",
        "Brackett: No, not them. You. Won't be long now. We'll be in the air any minute.",
        "Dusty: Well, I hope we're going someplace warm.",
        "Brackett: Don't worry about it. By the time we land, you won't be on the plane.",
        "Dusty: So, what's the deal? You gonna toss me out at 30,000 feet?",
        "Brackett: 25, 30 -- whatever.",
        "Dusty: You're better off shooting me, you know? Because if I go out that door, I'm taking you with me, pal.",
        "Brackett: Thanks for the tip. You know, I was really hoping to avoid a mess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You breathe, and I pull the trigger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So you two are sharing a sleeping bag, huh? I had no idea you were such a cheap date, Katie.",
        "Katie: Craig, it gets cold here at night. We were just using our body heat to keep us warm.",
        "Craig: Oh, oh, yeah. I'm sure you are. At least I know that's what Mike Kasnoff was thinking.",
        "Mike: Speak for yourself. You have no idea what I'm thinking, Craig.",
        "Katie: Hold up.",
        "Craig: It's not what you're thinking that bothers me. It's what you're thinking with.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no. Hold on, hold on. Craig. Where I sleep is none of your business.",
        "Craig: Do you really want to be another notch on Mr. Fix-it's tool belt here?",
        "Mike: Keep running your mouth.",
        "Katie: Hold on. Craig, I'm not having this conversation with you. I'm going to sleep here next to Mike, because that's what I feel like doing. And if you don't like it, well, too bad.",
        "Molly: Well, hi. Surprise. Oh.",
        "Jack: Okay. Ladies? I don't think this whole sleep-over idea is gonna fly.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Jack: Because I, for one, am not sleeping on the porch.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. This is Carly's final request before you two get married. How can you even think of denying her?",
        "Carly: Yes, Jack. How can you think of denying me? Especially since it was your idea to divorce me to begin with.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Carly. That's not fair.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it's one night that she's asking for. You're going to have her the rest of your life.",
        "Jack: There aren't enough sleeping bags, Carly. Where am I gonna sleep?",
        "Carly: Well, I think Mike got a big one from the barn. Why don't you curl up in there with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: All right, all right. I will talk to Mom about having you stay with me for a little while. But I'm not making up any stories, Alison. I'm telling her the truth.",
        "Alison: That we both think Rick is the killer?",
        "Emily: No, would you -- we're both a little uncomfortable around him, okay? And we don't want to take any chances.",
        "Alison: You can't say that, Emily. She's won't understand. When it comes to Rick, Mom is just blinded by love.",
        "Susan: Blinded by love? What are you two talking about?",
        "Alison: That you're so in love with Rick, if he turned out to be the serial killer, you would do anything not to notice.",
        "Susan: I don't think that's very funny.",
        "Alison: I don't, either.",
        "Susan: He has not killed anybody!",
        "Alison: We knew you would say that, Mom.",
        "Susan: He's in the ICU right now because his heart stopped beating.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: Apparently he was attacked by the same person who killed all the others. So as far as turning him into the prime suspect -- I think your theory doesn't hold up too well. Do you?",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry, Mom.",
        "Emily: I am so sorry, Mom. Is he okay? Is he going to pull through?",
        "Susan: I don't know. I don't know. It took so long to get his heart beating again, and he's still unconscious. But Walker seems optimistic. I don't know.",
        "Alison: Mom, I -- Mom, I didn't mean to. It's just -- I don't know. I'm sorry. I was just scared.",
        "Susan: It's okay. I forgive you.",
        "Alison: Well, is there anything I can do? Anything that you need?",
        "Susan: Just think good thoughts! Rick needs all the positive energy he can get.",
        "Alison: Are you going to ICU?",
        "Susan: I need to be with Rick.",
        "Emily: I'm coming with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Alison? Are you okay?",
        "Alison: No. Terrible.",
        "Chris: What happened?",
        "Alison: You didn't hear about Rick Decker?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "Alison: He was almost killed. My mother said it was the same person who killed the others.",
        "Chris: Where's Gordo? We gotta find Gordo.",
        "Gordo: Okay, so you found me. What's going on?",
        "Chris: You tell us. Seeing as how you're the one who tried to kill Dr. Decker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Did Holden Snyder call?",
        "Cop #1: Yeah, he's on his way in.",
        "Margo: Take this guy into interrogation.",
        "Cop #1: You got it, detective. Right this way.",
        "Dusty: Margo? I just want to say thank you for saving my life. I owe you.",
        "Margo: Don't -- don't you owe me anything. Okay, you ready to answer some questions? I'll start with the easy ones. What's your real name? You know, you're going to be held on a number of charges. So you might as well start cooperating.",
        "Holden: Where is my wife?",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right.",
        "Holden: Answer me, damn it, or I'll beat it out of you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Well, I don't want to disturb anybody. You guys just go back doing whatever you were doing before I got here.",
        "Katie: No, Molly. It's really good to see you.",
        "Molly: Yeah, right. Sure.",
        "Katie: I'm serious.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I guess I should have called, but my cell phone died on the way to the airport.",
        "Katie: It's okay. Carly will be thrilled.",
        "Molly: You think?",
        "Katie: Yeah. She really wanted you at the wedding. It's all she's been talking about.",
        "Molly: That's what I hear.",
        "Craig: We're all one big happy family now. Of course, some of us are happier than others.",
        "Molly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey -- Molly! What are you doing here? How are you? Here, hold onto this.",
        "Molly: Well, it was last minute.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Molly: Yes.",
        "Jack: So, I suppose -- I suppose you heard we're getting married again?",
        "Molly: Yeah. That's why I'm here, Jack.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Molly: Did I see Parker?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Molly: Hey, my man! I missed you. Hey, I like the hat.",
        "Jack: So who told you we're getting married?",
        "Molly: Oh, a little birdie with long, dark hair gave me a call and convinced me to come.",
        "Jack: Good move.",
        "Mike: Seemed like the right thing to do.",
        "Jack: You gotta see this baby, Molly. She's like an angel sent from heaven.",
        "Molly: I can't wait. Can I go in?",
        "Jack: Sure, of course. You know, Katie, you're going to want to go in, too. Carly wants all the ladies sleeping with her tonight.",
        "Katie: Oh, really? Like a bachelorette slumber party?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that kind of thing.",
        "Katie: Cool. Good idea.",
        "Craig: Where are all the men-folks supposed to sleep?",
        "Jack: Out here. On the porch.",
        "Craig: You're joking.",
        "Jack: Do I look like I'm smiling?",
        "Craig: Well, I guess we've got a few things to work out.",
        "Katie: Ladies and ladies, may I present a surprise guest?",
        "Carly: Hey. Molly. What are you doing here?",
        "Molly: Well, I was in the neighborhood. Carly, it just seemed like the perfect place to be.",
        "Carly: Oh, God. You have no idea how happy I am to see you.",
        "Molly: Actually, I do. Oh, let me look at you. Oh, you're so beautiful. Honey, how do you feel?",
        "Carly: Fine. A little tired, but other than that -- there's somebody I want you to meet.",
        "Molly: Oh, I can't wait.",
        "Carly: You have a new cuz. Her name is Sage.",
        "Molly: Sage. Hi. I'm Molly, Sage. Oh, Carly, may I?",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah.",
        "Molly: Hey, cutie. Hi. Hi. Oh, I think I love her already.",
        "Carly: She's gonna love you, too. Just as much as I do.",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, we've got four men with two sleeping bags. Any suggestions?",
        "Parker: I like this one.",
        "Mike: Good call, Parker. You sleep inside. I'll grab a blanket and sleep on top.",
        "Craig: Whoa, whoa, wait a second.",
        "Mike: I found the sleeping bag. I'm not giving it up.",
        "Craig: So I'm left with --",

        "Susan: Rick, it's me. You're hanging in there like a champ. You're going to pull through this.",
        "Emily: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Walker: I sent a blood sample to toxicology. I'm pretty sure it'll test positive for potassium chloride.",
        "Emily: Well, then why didn't it kill Rick, like it did all the others?",
        "Walker: I don't know.",
        "Susan: Rick? It's okay, sweetheart. I'm right here. Hi. Welcome back! What --",
        "Rick: Oh, the diary.",
        "Susan: Okay, sweetie. Don't try to talk, okay? We'll talk later. You have to rest now.",
        "Walker: What about the diary?",
        "Susan: Please, he's barely conscious. Leave him alone.",
        "Rick: It's okay. I found -- I found Arlene's journal in Bob's desk.",
        "Walker: I know. You called Susan. You told her about it. When we got there, you were unconscious.",
        "Rick: Someone came up behind me with a needle. I didn't see who it was.",
        "Walker: How much of Nurse Krebs' journal did you read?",
        "Rick: A couple of pages. It didn't tell me much.",
        "Susan: That's enough. Rick, that journal isn't important. Don't worry about it. You're alive. That's all that matters.",
        "Walker: I'll have them post a guard at your door. Make sure nobody else tries to hurt you.",
        "Rick: Hey, Walker? Is that your way of telling me you're sorry?",

        "Chris: Where've you been, Gordo?",
        "Gordo: Excuse me?",
        "Chris: I asked you a question. Answer it. Unless, of course, you've got something to hide.",
        "Gordo: It's none of your business where I've been, Chris. You're not my supervisor.",
        "Alison: Dr. Decker's in ICU. Whoever hurt him could still be in this hospital.",
        "Gordo: Yeah. Like right in front of me.",
        "Chris: Are you saying it was me?",
        "Gordo: Why not? It makes as much sense as anything else.",
        "Chris: You know what? I see what you're doing here. And I'm not going to let you get away with it.",
        "Hal: All right, all right, you two. Knock it off. Now what's all this about?",
        "Gordo: Dr. Hughes just accused me of attempted murder.",
        "Hal: Rick Decker?",
        "Alison: You already heard?",
        "Hal: Yeah. Walker Daniels put a call to the police station. But if I knew that you were running this investigation, I could've saved myself the trip, couldn't I?",
        "Alison: Hal, all Chris did was ask Gordo where he was when it happened. And Gordo got all defensive --",
        "Hal: Thank you, Alison, for your report. Now, I want the two of you to go wait in Bob's office. I need to get some specifics, and then I'll be in to question you.",
        "Chris: Does that mean we're suspects?",
        "Hal: It means that you both better come up with an alibi that checks out. Oh, and no fighting in there, either, boys. If you can't be civil, just sit quietly, okay?",
        "Alison: I'd better go check on my mom.",
        "Hal: Alison. You been on duty long?",
        "Alison: Only a couple of hours.",

        "Holden: Margo, we have to do something. Especially if this guy knows something about where Lily might be!",
        "Margo: Look, I know that you're upset. But back off.",
        "Holden: Upset? Upset?! My wife has been kidnapped. I'm going out of my mind here.",
        "Margo: Yes, I know, holden. That's very apparent. So much so that you turned this investigation, my investigation, over to this guy that you're about to rip apart right now. Will you please leave the police work to me from now on?",
        "Dusty: Come on, let's get a cup of coffee.",
        "Holden: I don't need anything from you.",
        "Dusty: Come on. I'm trying to help.",
        "Margo: You know what? You can both help by waiting outside in the squad room. And I will call you when I'm done. Please.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine.",
        "Brackett: Sending them away won't change anything, detective. I have nothing to say.",
        "Margo: So you're telling me that you have no idea where Lily Snyder and Rose D'Angelo are being held?",
        "Brackett: Oh, I know exactly where they're being held. But I'm not telling you. Because I don't care if they live or die.",

        "Susan: You think that Rick caused his own heart to stop to avoid your suspicions?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You just tell me what it is that you want.",
        "Brackett: I have what I want.",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Brackett: The thrill of knowing that you will never see your wife alive again. ( Beeping )",
        "Margo: Come on.",
        "Holden: Margo, I am not leaving here. Not without hearing what this guy has to say.",
        "Margo: I cannot allow that. I can't have you in that same room with him. You're too emotional.",
        "Holden: All right, fine. I will say whatever it is that you want me to say.",
        "Margo: But we don't know if he has anything to offer. Why would you put yourself through that same torture?",
        "Holden: Because he is the only connection I have to Lily right now. And I am not walking away from that.",
        "Margo: All right, I can understand that. Please stay on the other side of the room and shut up.",
        "Holden: I promise.",
        "Margo: Let's hope something comes of this.",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you right now. He's not going to tell you anything.",
        "Margo: Why do you say that?",
        "Dusty: Because he's a killer. He's got no conscience. He's not going to answer your questions just to be nice.",
        "Holden: You got another suggestion?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Offer him something. An incentive.",

        "Carly: Actually, I think that we already had a honeymoon.",
        "Rosanna: You did? When?",
        "Carly: Last week. Before Sage was born. It was the most romantic time I think we've ever had together.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, details.",
        "Carly: Well, he came here to be with me. And it was awkward at first. But once we started to relax, we were really communicating. We were talking about our feelings.",
        "Molly: Jack got deep. Good for him.",
        "Carly: There is one thing that he said to me that I will never, ever forget. He said that he almost didn't mind all the times we've broken up, because it gave him an excuse to fall in love with me again.",
        "Katie: Oh, he said that? What did you do?",
        "Carly: I fell right into his arms, and I didn't let go.",
        "Molly: See? All the more reason I think you guys should take a real honeymoon.",
        "Rosanna: You know, Craig and I planned a honeymoon. And in the end, he decided to take it without me.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Rosanna, that man does not deserve you. You know that, don't you?",
        "Rosanna: I do.",
        "Carly: Every morning he wakes up, he should be thanking his lucky stars that you have been gracious enough to allow him into your life.",
        "Molly: You know what? She's right.",
        "Katie: Yes, Craig is my brother. And I love him, most of the time. But there's one thing I will never understand about that man.",
        "Rosanna: Only one? You're doing much better than I am.",
        "Katie: How does he keep getting these amazing, beautiful women to put up with him?",
        "Rosanna: Well, thank you, Katie. I know there's a compliment in there somewhere.",
        "Katie: There is.",
        "Rosanna: Have a chocolate.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Molly: So, Katie? Did you and Simon get a honeymoon?",
        "Katie: Um, no. Well, not really. But you know what? Living in that cottage was just like the biggest, longest, most amazing honeymoon ever. We were all alone, out in the middle of nowhere. And it was just us. Unfortunately, the hardest thing to deal with was, well, I thought those days would last forever. And they didn't. That's the hardest life lesson to figure out, y'know? Not all honeymoons last forever. Whoa, do I know how to bring down a room, or what? I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: No. Don't be sorry. That's what we're doing. We're all telling the truth tonight, right? So, Molly, I think you're the only person who had an actual, legitimate honeymoon here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really? Where did you go?",
        "Molly: Hawaii.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, lovely.",
        "Katie: Oh, that must have been beautiful. I hear the water there is the perfect temperature.",
        "Molly: Actually, we never got out of the bedroom. For all I knew, we could've been in Cleveland.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Carly: Didn't you have to come home early, though?",
        "Molly: Yeah, of course. Abigail needed me.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then, Carly, you're wrong. None of us have had a legitimate, honest-to-goodness honeymoon.",
        "Molly: Yeah. You're right.",
        "Katie: That's sad. And you know what we should do? We should write a letter to the United States president and say -- there must be a two-week -- at least two-week honeymoon added to the legal part of a marriage.",
        "Rosanna: It'll never work.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Rosanna: He's a man.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'll give you $100 to let me sleep there alone.",
        "Jack: Forget it, Craig. I got nowhere else to go.",
        "Craig: $200, and I'll throw in one of my ties.",
        "Jack: No more discussion, okay? The sooner we get to sleep, the sooner this'll all be over.",
        "Craig: All right, fine.",
        "Craig: Good night.",
        "Jack: Good night.",
        "Craig: Jack?",
        "Jack: Craig?",
        "Craig: Want to tell me a good night story?",
        "[Mike and Parker laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: You want an apology, Dr. Decker? For what?",
        "Rick: You got time? I've got a list.",
        "Walker: Go ahead.",
        "Rick: Well, you implied that I might have committed murder. You caused Kim Hughes to lose faith in me as Bob's doctor. You scared Susan and her family without even the slightest bit of legitimate evidence. You --",
        "Susan: You don't have to worry about that. Nobody in my family thought you were capable of murder. Isn't that right?",
        "Emily: No, of course not.",
        "Rick: Thanks. Thanks, Emily. That means a lot. I'm still waiting, Walker.",
        "Walker: I apologize, Dr. Decker, if you feel you were unfairly treated. And I'm sorry if I caused any problems for Dr. Stewart and her family. And if Kim Hughes made the wrong decision in having you removed from Bob's case, then I regret that, too.",
        "Emily: I'm going to go check on Alison.",
        "Rick: Tell me something.",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Rick: Did Walker sound sorry to you?",
        "Susan: Not in the least.",
        "Rick: He wouldn't even admit that he was wrong about me. What the hell do I have to do? Join Nurse Krebs in the morgue?",
        "Susan: Please, don't say that. You're alive. We're together. What Walker Daniels thinks doesn't matter a bit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Excuse me, Dr. Daniels. Rick asked for an apology in there, and you couldn't give him one. I just wanted to know why not.",
        "Walker: You asked me a question. You asked me, \"how did Dr. Decker survive when the others that had been injected weren't so lucky?\" That was a very good question, Mrs. Munson. And I'd like to know the answer to that myself.",
        "Emily: Wait a minute. You think that Rick caused his own heart to stop, to avoid your suspicions?",
        "Walker: Now that you put it out there, it does sound pretty far out.",
        "Emily: No, it's much more than that, Dr. Daniels. It's insulting. And outrageous. Not to mention completely wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I was hanging out with Chris, when I first came on duty. And while Rick Decker was being attacked -- it's hard to say.",
        "Hal: It was approximately one hour ago. Did you see Chris or Gordo during that time?",
        "Alison: No. I mean, at least not that I remembered.",
        "Hal: Okay. Okay. Thank you, Alison. That's all I needed to know. Thank you. I've got work to do.",
        "Emily: Hey, I heard you were on your way.",
        "Hal: Hey, hey.",
        "Emily: I was just at the ICU.",
        "Hal: Oh, how is Rick?",
        "Emily: Awake. Talking. In fact, he's already had an argument with Dr. Daniels about who he thinks the serial killer really is.",
        "Hal: Well, Chris and Gordo were doing the same thing. If we don't solve this case soon, the entire hospital is going to be at each other's throats.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, everyone's afraid, Hal. Everyone's suspicious.",
        "Hal: Call if you need me.",
        "Emily: Wait -- where are you going?",
        "Hal: I think it's about time that I had a talk with Dr. Daniels.",
        "Alison: How could I start thinking Rick was the killer?",
        "Emily: Alison. You need to stop being so hard on yourself, okay? Bad things happen, people look for someone to blame.",
        "Alison: Like when Hal blamed Aaron for starting the fire. He was wrong then, Emily. And he's wrong now.",
        "Emily: Wrong about what?",
        "Alison: I'm starting to get the feeling like Hal thinks Chris might be the killer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Jack?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Craig: I never realized your skin was so smooth.",
        "[Mike and Parker laughing]",
        "Jack: Okay. Give me one of your pillows.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Jack: Because there's no way I'm sleeping without a pillow between us, that's all.",
        "Craig: Feeling a little unsteady in the masculinity department here, Jack? Afraid you're gonna start wearing mascara just 'cause you're sleeping next to a man?",
        "[Mike and Parker laughing]",
        "Mike: Ease up on him, Craig. He's got to get up in the morning. Getting married.",
        "Craig: All right. Here. Feel better, Jack? Jack?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Craig: Love you.",
        "[Mike and Parker laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, maybe none of us had a true honeymoon, but at least we've all known true love.",
        "Rosanna: Amen.",
        "Molly: Yeah, amen to that, y'know? Jake was an incredible husband. And even though he's gone, I still love him with all my heart.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, I wish I could say the same about Simon. But I can't, especially after everything he did. But at least I loved him for a long time. Like crazy. That makes it all worthwhile.",
        "Rosanna: Love was all I ever wanted. And it always eluded me, until now.",
        "Carly: Well, girls, what the heck. Here's to men. They're insensitive. They're maddening. They're insecure, and they're filthy. But somehow, for some reason, God, do we enjoy having them around!",
        "All: To men!",
        "Molly: I think Sage agrees.",
        "Rosanna: Amen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All right, I don't have time to be polite. Where were the two of you when Dr. Decker got jabbed with a needle full of poison?",
        "Gordo: I was downstairs in Records. Dr. Dixon asked me to find him a file.",
        "Hal: Anyone see you?",
        "Gordo: No.",
        "Chris: I got a page and went to a phone. But, by the time I got there, nobody was there.",
        "Hal: Anyone see you?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "Hal: Who was the page from?",
        "Chris: I have no idea.",
        "John: Dr. Daniels just called me. Have you any idea who attacked Dr. Decker?",
        "Hal: Nothing yet. But these two don't have anything that I would call an alibi.",
        "Chris: But that doesn't mean that we killed anyone.",
        "Hal: I don't want these doctors left alone anywhere in this hospital.",
        "John: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Have you got any proof that they were involved in these murders?",
        "Hal: There's still an investigation going on. And until it's resolved, I want both these men relieved of their responsibilities. Effective immediately.",
        "Hal: All right, I need to talk to you both. You're taking a leave of absence from work. I want you to make sure that she gets home.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Hal: Alison, people are getting killed around this hospital. I don't want anything to happen to you.",
        "Alison: You can't order me to quit my job.",
        "Hal: I can get you fired, if that's what you want.",
        "Alison: Well, I want to see Chris before I go.",
        "Hal: Chris has problems of his own. Now why don't you get a move on before I lose what little patience I have left?",
        "Alison: You can't talk to me like that!",
        "Hal: Hate me, Alison, if you want to. But get out of this hospital. Do not stay in this hospital another minute, until this situation is resolved. Do you understand me?",
        "Alison: I hated you already, Hal. This just proves I was right.",
        "Emily: Alison! Alison, honey. Just -- was that really necessary, Hal?",
        "Hal: It's for her own protection.",
        "Emily: For her own protection? I understand you want her away from the hospital. That's great. But did you have to bulldoze her into it? Did you ever think, maybe, of discussing it with her? She's just as scared and confused as the rest of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You tell me where Lily and Rose are being held, and I will offer you anything you want. Money, plane tickets, you name it.",
        "Brackett: Steinbeck would kill me.",
        "Holden: Well, you can get another identity. Look, my wife and I, we have a lot of money. And we will help you. We'll give you whatever you need.",
        "Brackett: How do I know you won't cross me?",
        "Margo: The Oakdale PD doesn't like to be part of these negotiations. But, if you give us the information, I will make sure that Mr. Snyder holds up his end.",
        "Dusty: It's a straight deal, con man. You get something for yourself. Not just something -- a lot. And we get Lily and Rose.",
        "Holden: I promise you. Steinbeck is not going to know that the information came from you. All right, I'll tell you what. I'll just throw a figure out there? How about a million bucks? $2 million? Okay, $3 million. It doesn't have to be in cash. It can be in stocks. It can be in bonds. You just tell me what it is that you want.",
        "Brackett: I have what I want.",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Brackett: The thrill of knowing that you will never see your wife alive again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't like the police coming in here and ordering us around. But in this case, I think we better follow it. I'm taking you off of assignment, with full pay. Both of you.",
        "Gordo: For how long?",
        "John: Well, a couple of days, to start with. Then we'll have to reevaluate.",
        "Chris: Look, my dad's in a coma. You can't expect me to stay away.",
        "John: Your mother can bring you up to date on your dad's coma.",
        "Chris: Look, you can call the security, the police, the national guard. I will be in this hospital to visit my father. Count on it.",
        "Alison: Chris! Did Hal accuse you of trying to murder Rick Decker?",
        "Chris: He considers me a suspect.",
        "Alison: That's -- that's insane.",
        "Chris: Look --",
        "Alison: No, I won't let him get away with this. I know that you're innocent, and I'm going to find a way to prove it.",
        "Chris: Alison, I want you to stay away from me.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Chris: Because being around me right now could be dangerous, all right? I just don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Alison: Chris, I don't care what you say --",
        "Chris: Alison, go home and be with your mother. Forget about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All right, Emily. Maybe I should've handled your sister with more respect, and I will tell her that the next chance I get. But that does not change the fact that this hospital is no longer safe.",
        "Emily: All right. I'll get her out of here. I promise.",
        "Hal: Good. So go find your sister and just go home, Emily. It's getting late, and there is a killer on the loose here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Remember, this was not my choice.",
        "Craig: You're not my ideal bedmate, either.",
        "Mike: Whatever.",
        "Jack: Craig?",
        "Craig: Huh?",
        "Jack: I miss you.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Thanks.",
