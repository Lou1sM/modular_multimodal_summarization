        "Luke: I set up the cooler in the kitchen. What used to be the kitchen.",
        "Holden: Thanks.",
        "Luke: So, what's the E.T.A on the rest of the house?",
        "Holden: Oh, it's gonna take some time still.",
        "Luke: Still good to be back home. You know, Keith's back. I saw him at Grandma Lucinda's house.",
        "Holden: Oh, well, that's good. He's been gone for a while. Your mom probably missed him.",
        "Luke: I'm not so sure about that. I think things have changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I left town and that suited you just fine. You had all these opportunities to put Lily and Holden back together again, didn't you?",
        "Lucinda: Lily and Holden have been mysteriously drawn to each other for years. A long, long time, I tried to warn you about that.",
        "Keith: No, you got what you wanted, so congratulations to you!",
        "Lily: Hey, Keith. Wait. Why are you yelling at my mother?",
        "Keith: Because your mother's been gunning for me ever since I came to town here.",
        "Lily: My mother's been in the hospital.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Lily.",
        "Lily: And she has cancer.",
        "Lucinda: Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: I don't understand. Why are you mad at Casey?",
        "Casey: She's mad at the world, all right? Let's just go.",
        "Gwen: He told Will I should get rid of the baby. He said I should have an abortion.",
        "Celia: You know, I'm sure you must have misunderstood.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no. He was real clear, weren't you, Casey? But then again, there's all sorts of things that you don't know about your boyfriend. Well, what do you think, Casey? Hmm? Time to bring her up to speed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom's on her way.",
        "Will: What am I gonna say that she's gonna listen to, Paul? Mom never listens, you know that. All right, she wants Gwen to get a DNA test so that she can figure out if this is really my kid or not. She's gonna force it upon us. What am I supposed to say?",
        "Paul: The test is not the issue. Look, Will, if you're gonna go through with this, what you have to do --",
        "Will: Don't tell me what I have to do, okay? Paul, this is none of your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I didn't push Jennifer. She isn't hurt. The baby isn't hurt. So why is she trying to accuse me of assault?",
        "Jessica: That's not why we're here, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "Jessica: You'll be arraigned on the assault charge later. Jennifer has asked for a restraining order.",
        "Craig: Yeah. You mean her father the cop called his buddy the judge and had me hauled in here, yes.",
        "Jessica: Where you'll be able to testify on your own behalf. And I'll be able to cross examine any witnesses.",
        "Craig: Fine, whatever. Let's just get it over with.",
        "Jessica: Wait, Craig, wait. Are you aware of the implications here? If the judge finds for Jennifer --",
        "Craig: Yeah, I won't be able to talk to Jennifer or be anywhere near her for a year. Big whoop. I can hire a nurse to pick up my son.",
        "Jessica: The order will extend to the child. You won't be able to hold your son or even see him until he's a year old.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You sure you're up to this?",
        "Jennifer: What choice do I have? I have to protect the baby. This could go on for awhile. Could you get me some water?",
        "Mike: Sure.",
        "Dusty: You okay? It's gonna be just fine. Oakdale's finest are gonna testify that they saw Craig push you to the floor at the Lakeview.",
        "Jennifer: Even though he didn't.",
        "Dusty: Jen, he did push you in every way for a long time. Am I right? Today he gets his. He got ugly with you. You tried to be nice, he pushed you to the floor at the Lakeview. End of story. And nobody's ever gonna know different.",
        "Rosanna: Look, she's still pregnant. By the time the baby is born, the restraining order will be set aside.",
        "Craig: There shouldn't even be a restraining order in the first place. Nothing happened.",
        "Rosanna: Well something must have happened. You were at the Lakeview --",
        "Craig: Minding my own business when Jennifer approaches me. She sits down. Could we talk? Fine. I'm polite. Then she tells me she has decided that I am never going near my son. No visitations, no nothing. And why? Because I killed Bryant.",
        "Rosanna: What? That's so unfair.",
        "Craig: Yeah. And evidently, having no father is better than me. So anyway, she keeps pushing and I get a little angry, but I am under control. And I take her elbow, like a gentleman, to lead her somewhere quiet, somewhere private, because she is making this awful scene. And suddenly she starts yelling \"stop pushing me. Stop pushing me.\" And then she's on the floor.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my God.",
        "Craig: Okay?",
        "Rosanna: The baby?",
        "Craig: The baby's fine. Jennifer's fine. They took her to the hospital. Everything's fine.",
        "Rosanna: Well thank God for that.",
        "Craig: Only she's arranged this emergency meeting with all these people here.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean, there -- there were people around when she fell?>",
        "Craig: Oh, lots of people. Bob, Kim, Dusty, Sierra.",
        "Rosanna: How convenient.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh.",
        "Rosanna: You think you were set up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You have --",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I have cancer. Oh, just look at him, darling, he's all soft and squishy now. A minute ago, I was disgusting. A minute ago, you wanted to take my head off, even though I don't think I deserve beheading. And Lily, I forbid you to blab to another person ever again!",
        "Lily: I am sorry. I just wanted him to stop yelling at you.",
        "Lucinda: You think because I have cancer I've lost my voice?!",
        "Lily: Okay! Of course not. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Please, darling, just stop it. Doing whatever it is you're doing.",
        "Lily: I already said I'm sorry. I know you're waiting for your biopsy results.",
        "Lucinda: The call hasn't come. And Mr. Morrissey, I just know it's such a shock to you, but you are the last thing on my mind right now.",
        "Keith: Yes, I realize that and I apologize for yelling.",
        "Lucinda: Why? Because I have cancer?",
        "Keith: No, because I thought you were responsible for Lily changing her mind.",
        "Lily: Changing my mind about what?",
        "Keith: Well, Luke told me that you and Holden were back together again.",
        "Lily: What? No. No. Keith, Holden and I have been working really hard to keep a relationship for the children, but we are not back together again. You don't think I would've -- you don't think I would've called you or talk to you about doing something like that?",
        "Keith: Yes, yes, yes, Lily. I just got blindsided by your kid, that's all. And I apologize for yelling.",
        "Lucinda: I had trouble putting up with you before. But you wanna know something now? The kinder, gentler you makes me puke.",
        "[Lily groans]",
        "Lily: Oh, my.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Luke, your mother and Keith, they're committed to working things out. That's why he came back.",
        "Luke: We'll see. Wow, they really got a lot done.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, your mom, she promised them the moon and the stars.",
        "Luke: Well, she wants her home back.",
        "Holden: How's your grandmother?",
        "Luke: Antsy. She's waiting for her biopsy results.",
        "Holden: You know, your grandmother tends to think that she can handle anything that life throws at her, but she needs all the support she can get right now.",
        "Luke: You're right. Hey, I was thinking, you know, since our kitchen's out of commission, maybe we could have a cookout at her place. You know, like last summer, by the pool?",
        "Holden: I don't think that's such a good idea. She's probably not ready for that right now.",
        "Luke: Well, I'll ask her. I think it would be a good idea for Mom if we were all having a good time, maybe she'll forget about things. I'll ask her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What do you say, Case? Should I tell her, or do you wanna do the honors?",
        "Celia: What is she talking about?",
        "Casey: I was talking to Will and she overheard. But the point is, Will is standing up. It's what he wants to do. It's his choice.",
        "Gwen: Funny how that works. The guys get to choose. The girls, they just get stuck.",
        "Celia: Gwen!",
        "Casey: Let her go.",
        "Celia: But she's upset.",
        "Casey: She's always upset or mad or something.",
        "Celia: But look at her life.",
        "Casey: That's exactly what I was trying to explain to Will. I mean, he needs to think long and hard before he signs on to this fatherhood.",
        "Celia: Because she doesn't come from the right background? Then neither do I. My Mom's a cook.",
        "Casey: My mother's a cop.",
        "Celia: Look, I'm just saying that money shouldn't matter. Just because Gwen is broke, does that mean she doesn't deserve to be our friend? She needs us. Now more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where're you going?",
        "Will: I'm leaving. You called her, you deal with it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Paul: Relax. I'll take care of it. And maybe Mom's come to her senses. Maybe she won't get involved. Maybe she'll mind her own business.",
        "Barbara: Hi, is Will here? Oh, good. Honey, I just got off the phone with Dr. Schiller. And she can do Gwen's amnio right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Dr. Hughes, can you tell the court how you came to be at the Lakeview dining room this morning?",
        "Bob: I was having breakfast with my lovely wife.",
        "Tom: And while you and your wife were having breakfast, did you notice Craig Montgomery sitting nearby?",
        "Bob: Yes, he was approximately 20 feet away.",
        "Tom: Was he alone?",
        "Bob: Well, he was at first. And then Jennifer came in and went up to speak to him.",
        "Tom: And then what happened?",
        "Bob: Well, my breakfast arrived, which took my attention until Craig raised his voice.",
        "Tom: Were you able hear what he was saying?",
        "Bob: Yes, he told Jennifer to get away from him.",
        "Sierra: I arrived for a meeting. And when I entered the dining room, I heard Craig bellowing.",
        "[Sierra remembering]",
        "Craig: I have enough right, reason, and money to blow you out of the water, okay? And I will. So, when this baby is born, you better get a good look at it, because it may be the last time you ever see it!",
        "Kim: Bob wanted to intervene. It was an ugly situation, but before anyone could do anything, Craig grabbed Jennifer's arm.",
        "[Kim remembering]",
        "Jennifer: Stay away from me!",
        "Craig: Let's go, let's go.",
        "Jennifer: No, stop.",
        "Craig: Come on.",
        "Jennifer: 'Cause I'm not going anywhere. Stop pushing me, Craig.",
        "Craig: I am not pushing you.",
        "Tom: You heard Jennifer ask Craig to stop pushing her?",
        "Jessica: Objection, your honor. Hearsay.",
        "Tom: Excited utterance, your honor.",
        "Judge Kwan: I'll allow it. The witness may answer the question.",
        "Kim: Yes, I did hear Jennifer ask Craig to stop pushing her.",
        "Tom: Thank you. Your witness.",
        "Jessica: Mrs. Hughes, while you were enjoying your breakfast and chatting with your husband, were you able to hear what Mr. Montgomery and Mrs. Kasnoff were discussing before this excited utterance?",
        "Kim: No.",
        "Jessica: So, you have no idea what led up to my client's outburst.",
        "Kim: No, I don't. But quite frankly, I don't see what difference that makes. I did hear him threaten her. I did see her being pushed, and I saw her fall. A pregnant woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: How are you holding up here?",
        "Lily: I'm holding my breath, like the rest of the family.",
        "Keith: Well, I should've been around here --",
        "Lily: No, it's not your fault. Please. It's okay.",
        "Keith: No, still, I should've --",
        "Lily: I know. My mother -- she thinks she's invincible.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, she's not the only one. You know, Lily, I really, really missed you a lot. That's why I came back early. I'm here. So, anything you need, want, you got it.",
        "Lily: Luke. Luke!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We were walking into the dining room, and I heard Craig yelling. Everybody did. I mean, you could hear him to Chicago.",
        "Jessica: Objection, your honor.",
        "Judge Kwan: Sustained. The witness will refrain from elaborating and simply state the facts.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, your honor. Yes, he was loud. And it's a fact that everyone was staring at him.",
        "Tom: Then what happened?",
        "Dusty: He grabbed Jen's arm. Jennifer told him to stop pushing her. And next thing you knew, she was on the floor. He pushed her.",
        "Tom: Your witness.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Donovan, you work with the complainant, do you not?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we all worked together. Craig, myself and Jennifer.",
        "Jessica: A simple yes or no, please.",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Jessica: You've also worked with Mr. Montgomery on occasion, is that correct?",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Jessica: And that didn't work out, did it?",
        "Dusty: Nope. Didn't work out. You probably wouldn't wanna work with him, either.",
        "Jessica: Is it fair to say you don't like my client?",
        "Dusty: I'd use a stronger word, but yeah. I don't like him.",
        "Jessica: And so you just happened to show up at the Lakeview just in time to witness the confrontation between my client and your business partner. Is that also fair to say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: That night when Alison set us up on that double date, did you know her?",
        "Casey: Who, Gwen? Yeah, we go to the same school.",
        "Celia: Because the way you looked at her --",
        "Casey: What do you mean? What way?",
        "Celia: Like you knew her.",
        "Casey: Well, yeah, I do know her. We went to the same school for years.",
        "Celia: Did you ever go out with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How can you be sure that this girl is not using you? I've heard she's very user-friendly. How many boyfriends do you think she's had?",
        "Will: Okay, Mom. You don't like her, I get that. Can we move on?",
        "Barbara: It's not about liking her or not liking her. Though I have to admit she would not be my first choice for a daughter-in-law.",
        "Will: Mom, I'm not marrying her. I'm helping her.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay. I really don't understand here. You don't -- you don't love her?",
        "Will: No. My feelings about her have nothing to do with why I'm helping her, okay? It's my responsibility. How many times do I have to say that?",
        "Paul: Oh, well, I, for one, don't ever have to hear it again as long as I live. How about you, mother? Vodka. Vodka rocks.",
        "Barbara: Oh, please. You know, you two are mad. A baby under the best circumstances is a dicey proposition, and this, my darling sons, is anything but that. Where are you gonna live, Will? In the garage? With an infant? How are you gonna support yourselves? And if you think you can use your trust fund to tide you over, well you know what, a hospital delivery's gonna dig into the principal. And if there are complications? Poof, it's gone. And then what are you gonna do, quit school? Get a job at Al's?",
        "Will: Okay, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.",
        "Barbara: Good. That's a start.",
        "Will: But we're gonna make it work.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Barbara: Can we at least find out if this baby is a Ryan before you drag the whole family into the garage? And if the baby is yours, then whatever you want. I'll be the model Grandmother.",
        "Will: Okay, Mom. I've heard what you had to say, and I appreciate your concern. But no test. No paternity test whatsoever.",
        "Barbara: You are not making any sense.",
        "Will: Mom, I swear to you, okay? If you fight me on this, I swear to God, I will never speak to you again.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I wish I had a nickel for every time you kids said something like that. I'd retire by now.",
        "Paul: You're not retired now?",
        "Barbara: A mother never retires from her job. You called me over here, and here I am. So, together, we're gonna solve this problem, whether the two of you like it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Your honor, we have established that Mr. Donovan was at the Lakeview for a previously scheduled business meeting. The fact that he may dislike Mr. Montgomery is irrelevant. I mean, are we to assume that Dr. Hughes dislikes Mr. Montgomery? Mrs. Hughes?",
        "Judge Kwan: The objection is sustained. The question will be stricken from the record. And Ms. Griffin, unless you've got evidence to support this theory of yours, you'll abandon this line of inquiry.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Donovan, it's been alleged that Mrs. Kasnoff said something to provoke Mr. Montgomery. Did you hear their conversation?",
        "Dusty: No. But in my experience? It's not difficult to provoke mr. Montgomery.",
        "Judge Kwan: Anything further, counselor?",
        "Jessica: Not at this time, your honor.",
        "Judge Kwan: Mr. Donovan, you're excused. Mr. Hughes?",
        "Tom: I'd like to call Jennifer Kasnoff.",
        "Mike: Look, just tell the truth and you'll nail him.",
        "Bailiff: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?",
        "Jennifer: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Paul: Will, if you're not a couple, why are you doing this?",
        "Lily: Come on, Luke. Let's just talk about this, okay?",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Luke: You don't wanna know.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Mike: Your brother shoved my pregnant wife to the floor.",
        "Katie: Maybe it just looked that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I was looking for my mother when I saw Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Tom: And were you by yourself?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. But my husband and I were trying to reach some sort of accord with Mr. Montgomery, so I thought I would speak to him. I assumed he would be civil. We were in public. Obviously, I was wrong.",
        "Tom: Well, the defense seems to feel that your conversation with Mr. Montgomery may have had some effect on his state of mind. So, what is it that you two were talking about?",
        "Jennifer: My baby. Our baby. Craig is the biological father. He had expressed an interest in developing a relationship with this child. And I felt that I had to remind him of a few very sad facts. Specifically, that he -- he was responsible for the death of his son, Bryant.",
        "Jessica: Objection, your honor. Extremely prejudicial.",
        "Judge Kwan: Sorry, counselor. I don't care if it's true or not. Simply that it may have provoked Mr. Montgomery and led to his actions. After the exchange about Mr. Montgomery's late son, what happened next, Mrs. Kasnoff?",
        "Jennifer: Craig got very angry and he grabbed my arm and I was afraid. I told him not to push me. But he did, and I ended up on the floor. And I was so scared for my baby. That something might have happened to him. And they took me to the hospital, and I'm okay. And so far the baby's okay. But I could have lost him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I don't date girls like Gwen.",
        "Celia: What do you mean girls like Gwen?",
        "Casey: Look what she did to Will. He's trapped for life now, all right? And I hate it, Celia. The guy's my best friend. He's gone through enough bad stuff in his life without having to deal with a girl like Gwen. Plus a baby? That's insane.",
        "Celia: I know it's not a good situation.",
        "Casey: No, it's a disaster.",
        "Celia: Still, it's not the baby's fault. And to tell Will that they should get an abortion?",
        "Casey: What's the difference? He didn't listen to me anyway.",
        "Celia: I still think you should apologize.",
        "Casey: Why don't you tell Gwen to apologize from eavesdropping on someone's private conversation?",
        "Celia: What would you do? If you were in Will's situation.",
        "Casey: I wouldn't be in Will's situation. Ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why are you hustling me out of here when you called me and asked me to come over?",
        "Paul: Why do you think I called you and asked you to come over?",
        "Barbara: To stop your brother from ruining his life.",
        "Paul: I called you and asked you come over here so that Will could tell you how he felt.",
        "Barbara: Will is not making any sense.",
        "Paul: Do you want to see your grandchild?",
        "Barbara: If it is my grandchild.",
        "Paul: Are you willing to take that chance? Because from what I hear, this girlfriend is no pushover. So, word to the wise. Accept his decision.",
        "Barbara: And just let him finance the whole thing?",
        "Paul: Oh, Mother, it's just money. Let it go. The baby is coming whether you like it or not. So just support him and wait and see.",
        "Barbara: So you're just saying that I --",
        "Paul: If this is your grandchild, you're gonna want a ringside seat.",
        "Barbara: And if it's not?",
        "Paul: Well, look. My little brother is very smart. There has to be a reason he's sticking with this girl. You smell nice. You got a new perfume?",
        "Barbara: Oh, stop trying to butter me up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: He's gone. I was yelling after him. He pretended not to hear me, and now he's just gone.",
        "Keith: Lily, he's, you know, he's rooting for his parents to get back together again. And he lied to me. But now he saw the way it is, so he doesn't like it.",
        "Lily: That's not just that. It's so much. The fire, his things burning up in the fire, his grandmother has cancer.",
        "Keith: I know. He's a good kid, though.",

        "Lily: Stop coddling him, is that what you're saying?",
        "Keith: Well, you know, just give him a little bit of room. And tell him that your boyfriend is not a deadbeat. He got a new job.",
        "Lily: You're not a deadbeat -- a job?",
        "Keith: Yes.",

        "Craig: All I want, all I've ever wanted, your honor, is to share in the custody of our child. I've told this repeatedly to Jennifer. And I told her again this morning when we spoke, but she is not interested in sharing our child. No, she wants to raise it herself with her new husband.",
        "Tom: Objection. Speculative.",
        "Jessica: Your honor, if opposing counsel is allowed to elicit testimony as to state of mind, certainly --",
        "Judge Kwan: Sustained. I'm only interested in what Mr. Montgomery did, Ms. Griffin, not why.",
        "Craig: Well, I got upset, your honor, yes. Because Jennifer was making a public scene. She brought up my deceased son, Bryant. Blamed me for his death.",
        "Jessica: You were upset, so you raised your voice.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, I raised my voice, yeah. The whole room could hear these ridiculous things she was accusing me of. She was trying to humiliate me in front of people I know.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Montgomery, did you push Mrs. Kasnoff to the ground?",
        "Craig: No, no, I -- no. I would never do anything to jeopardize her or her child, and she knows that. She's only looking for leverage here to deny me custody.",

        "Judge Kwan: Once again the witness will confine himself to what he knows to be true.",
        "Craig: What is true, your honor, is that I tried to walk Jennifer out of the dining room so that we could continue our conversation in private. And she fell. I never pushed her.",
        "Jessica: Your witness.",
        "Tom: Did you hear Dr. Hughes, Mrs. Hughes, anyone for that matter, testify to the fact that they overheard the discussion between you and Jennifer before the fireworks started?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Tom: So, you want us believe that you were so embarrassed by this quiet conversation that you started to hurl threats at Jennifer. Is that your story? Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Craig: I was frustrated. Yeah. But --",
        "Tom: From all accounts, it appears that Jennifer was the one that was using discretion, that you were the one that lost control, and you were the one that invaded her personal space.",
        "Jessica: Objection, your honor. Argumentative.",
        "Judge Kwan: Overruled.",

That you would willfully disregard the health and safety of your own offspring, Mr. Montgomery, by shoving a woman who was trying to reason with you, shows a lack of restraint that borders on criminality. And that no harm came from it is no excuse. I hereby grant the plaintiff's request for a restraining order preventing any contact or communication with Mrs. Kasnoff or her offspring with the following amendment -- that this restraining order be in effect for a period of no less than five years. The complete terms are in my written order. This hearing is adjourned.",
