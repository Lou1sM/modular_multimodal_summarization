        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. I thought you'd be at work.",
        "Jack: No, not tonight. You're back from Montana?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- yeah, just now. I checked my messages on the way back into town and I heard about Lily. So, I just stopped to see if Emma had any news.",
        "Jack: No, Emma's at the hospital. I was there until a little while ago.",
        "Carly: So you saw Lily?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: A coma, I just can't believe it.",
        "Jack: Yeah. The baby's okay, that's the good news. But, the longer this goes on, the more that it becomes a problem.",
        "Carly: Right. Well, I will go -- I will go to the hospital tomorrow morning to see her. And how's Holden? I can't imagine how he must feel.",
        "Jack: No, he's, you know -- it takes a lot to get him out of there, you know?",
        "Carly: And the girls?",
        "Jack: They're here. They're here. I told Emma I'd watch them, so --",
        "Carly: Oh -- nice. All right, um, I should get our troupe home.",
        "Jack: Did they have fun?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- yeah, I think they did. I'm sure they'll tell you all about it. You know, if you want to come and see them and ask for yourself, you can, you know --",
        "J.J: Dad!",
        "Jack: A little too late.",
        "J.J.: We saw a moose!",
        "Jack: You saw a moose?",
        "Parker: Yeah, we touched it.",
        "Jack: What about you, Pumpkin? Did you see a moose?",
        "Carly: Now, what happened to staying in the car?",
        "Parker: We had to go to the bathroom.",
        "Carly: Yeah, right.",
        "Jack: Just for a minute, hmm?",
        "Carly: Well, what choice do I have? I'm outnumbered.",
        "Jack: So good to see you.",

        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Katie: Sorry.",
        "Mike: Yeah, it's all your fault.",
        "Katie: It is my fault, I booked this cruise.",
        "Mike: Hey, look, look, look -- you're paying for it now, all right? Well, it was a good idea on paper. [Glass breaking] I hope you didn't want those.",
        "Katie: No, no, no more drinks. The smell is even making me just --",
        "Mike: You gonna be sick?",
        "Katie: No, I'll be fine.",
        "Mike: Why don't you go up and get some air?",
        "Katie: And leave you here to clean up all this mess?",
        "Mike: Oh, it's fine. It's fine. If you're sick, the best thing to do is go get some air. Okay?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Mike: Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: I'm hungry, do you think the dining rooms are open?",
        "Vienna: If you dare to speak to me about food, I swear I will lose my lunch.",
        "Simon: Not in here, okay? Not in here again -- in there.",
        "Vienna: I can't move.",
        "Simon: All right, just hang tight, all right? I'm gonna go find you some drugs.",
        "Vienna: Really?",
        "Simon: Yeah, there's gotta be some kind of medication for motion sickness on board this boat. Just lie still.",
        "Vienna: I am lying still, it's this damn boat that won't stop moving.",

        "Henry: Hey, hey, kiddo. Hey, what's up? What's up?",
        "Maddie: Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Henry: You had to see me right away for nothing?",
        "Maddie: No, it's not trouble or anything, everything's fine.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Maddie: It's about this summer. What are we going to do?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: Well, this is a very big summer for me.",
        "Henry: Okay -- I don't know. I thought you would stay here and get a job -- one of us should, right?",
        "Maddie: Or -- or we can travel. We can go away.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: Just travel. Hop in the limo and go.",
        "Henry: Maddie, have you seen gas prices lately? No.",
        "Maddie: Then we'll hitchhike around Europe.",
        "Henry: I don't do the bandanna backpack thing.",
        "Maddie: How about Monte Carlo? If we wear the right clothes, we'll pass ourselves off as Euro-trash and we'll hit the roulette tables. Haven't you always wanted to gamble in Monte Carlo?",
        "Henry: Maddie, what is this?",
        "Maddie: I want to travel. I want to see the world. Isn't that normal for my age?",
        "Henry: Yeah, but you never said a peep about it before. This is about Casey Hughes, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey. What's up?",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm -- babysitting. Jen's in the hospital.",
        "Casey: Why, what's wrong with her?",
        "Gwen: Pneumonia. I guess she was having a pretty hard time breathing. By the time Will and I got here, Dusty had taken her to the hospital already.",
        "Casey: Who was with Johnny?",
        "Gwen: Will's brother and Meg Snyder. So I sent them off and I'm here with this little guy.",
        "Casey: Well, I hope it's over soon so Jen can come home.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, me too. What are you doing at the Lakeview? Did you come by to see Maddie?",
        "Casey: I tried. I went to my grandma's. But she wasn't there. The guy at the desk said he hadn't seen her either, so I guess she didn't come back here.",
        "Gwen: From where? Case -- what, did Maddie take off on you again?",
        "Casey: Kinda. She broke up with me.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Casey: Yeah. And I have no idea why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This is some kind of mistake. Jennifer can't be sick. She never gets sick.",
        "Meg: Bob wouldn't have said what he did if they weren't sure it was serious.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Bob didn't need to make it sound like Jennifer wasn't going to make it, 'cause that's just not possible. My sister is not going to die!",
        "Barbara: Would you please keep your voice down? Your sister could hear you in there. And Will is scared to death. Would you just be a big brother, Paul?",
        "Kim: Barbara? Okay, Sweetheart. Let it go. Let it go, darling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Dusty? It's time we move Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: Okay, what do you suggest?",
        "Bob: We could send her home.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean?",
        "Bob: With a nurse. There's very little more we can do for her here. We can give her heart meds through I.V., breathing treatments -- and I'll stop by frequently to see her.",
        "Dusty: I don't want you to give up on her.",
        "Bob: We have to discuss the alternatives.",
        "Dusty: Don't give up on her.",
        "Bob: I'm not giving up on her. It's her heart.",
        "Dusty: No, Jennifer is not going home!",
        "Jennifer: Honey? Why don't you want me to come home",
        "Dusty: Of course I want you home, Red. As soon as you're well.",
        "Bob: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Don't do that again.",
        "Bob: Jennifer and I have to discuss her options.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jennifer: Honey --",
        "Dusty: Hold on, baby, one second.",
        "Bob: She's awake, she's alert, she's capable of making her own decisions. Do you want me to lie or to tell you the truth? I've got a code, I've got to go.",
        "Dusty: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Bob: I'll be back to talk to Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Dusty: Nothing, he had something.",
        "Jennifer: I want to come home. I miss Johnny.",
        "Dusty: He misses you. But you gotta stay here until you're 100%.",
        "Jennifer: But if Uncle Bob says I could go --",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. We're not gonna rush this time. I want you to take a nap, okay? You need to rest. I'm going to go make some calls.",
        "Jennifer: Johnny?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to check on him. And I'm going to get you another doctor, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I want to make sure you get well.",
        "Jennifer: But, honey, Uncle Bob's the best.",
        "Dusty: Around here he is, but I want to find you a specialist.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I love you. That's why. I'll handle it. Okay? Everybody wants to see you. Or you could sleep. Sleep --",
        "Barbara: Is she awake?",
        "Dusty: She's sleeping now. Listen, I'm going to find someone who can handle this situation -- a specialist. Okay? You'll stay with her?",
        "Barbara: Of course I will.",
        "Dusty: Don't say anything to her about what Bob said, okay?",
        "Barbara: He's wrong, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You bet he is.",
        "Barbara: I think you should call Lucinda. She's got the clout to get somebody here fast. And we need fast. We can't afford the time to sit around and wait for a consultant.",
        "Dusty: I know, I know. Stay tough.",
        "Kim: Do you need a few minutes to collect yourself before we go in?",
        "Barbara: No, I don't. I'm okay. Do I look positive?",
        "Kim: You look beautiful. You look like a mother who loves her daughter very much. And that's what Jen needs right now. You can do it.",
        "Barbara: Hey. Go back to sleep, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Why does everyone want me asleep?",
        "Barbara: Do they? Maybe it's because they know that if you're rested, you'll be feeling a little stronger.",
        "Jennifer: Why does Dusty want another doctor?",
        "Barbara: Well, he's just being a protective male, honey. And believe me, I'm not going to argue with Dusty Donovan when he's in papa bear mode. So let him bring in all the specialists, okay? All the specialists he wants.",
        "Jennifer: Mom? What's wrong with me?",
        "Barbara: Well, for one thing, you're really run down. You're really run down, honey. Which is why everyone wants you to sleep and to rest. Let other people take care of you, okay?",
        "Jennifer: We're not talking about just pneumonia anymore. We're talking about something else.",
        "Barbara: It's not really clear yet what's wrong, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, come in. Both of you.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. Can we have a minute?",
        "Barbara: No, I don't think so. Because I don't think we can stand any arguing today. I promised your fianc\u00e9 you'd rest.",
        "Jennifer: What is it that nobody wants to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, I don't want to pry or anything, but -- you know, something had to have happened. Was it when you guys -- I mean, did you hook up?",
        "Casey: No. We were going to, and then she changed her mind.",
        "Gwen: And you got upset with her?",
        "Casey: No! I told her that I was fine with whatever.",
        "Gwen: I don't -- I don't know, maybe she just felt pressured.",
        "Casey: Yeah, that's me.",
        "Gwen: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: She was the one who pushed this, not me.",
        "Gwen: Look, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to figure this out. Because I don't get any of it.",
        "Casey: Neither do I! She was so intense.",
        "Gwen: Maddie's always intense.",
        "Casey: No, she went from kissing me one minute to then telling me that she never wanted to see me again, ever. I mean, who does that, Gwen? It was like -- you know in a movie where a guy's got a gun against another guy's back and he's telling him what to say?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Casey: It was like that. Like it was her, but it wasn't.",
        "Gwen: So you think that somebody else made Maddie break up with you?",
        "Casey: No -- I don't -- I don't know! And now she won't even talk to me.",
        "Gwen: You tried?",
        "Casey: Like, five messages an hour.",
        "Gwen: Really?",
        "Casey: Almost.",
        "[Gwen sighs]",
        "Gwen: Okay. Okay, maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I guess I'm just -- I'm too young to have a steady boyfriend.",
        "Henry: You're too young? Did you just say that?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, you think so, too.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I think so, too. I'm your big brother! You on the other hand have been known to consider yourself a woman of the world --",
        "Maddie: What do you think, I'm some tramp? I'm not!",
        "Henry: No, I don't think -- no, nobody's saying that. Maddie, over here. Come here. Look me in the eye. Hey! What's going on with you?",
        "Maddie: Nothing! I just broke up with someone, I don't feel like sticking around being reminded of it every ten seconds, that's all.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. Maybe you should go home for the summer.",
        "Maddie: No! That is the worst thing I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J: What's for dinner?",
        "Jack: Well, that kind of depends on your mom. I was just going to grill some dogs for your cousins.",
        "Parker: We love hot dogs!",
        "J.J: Yeah!",
        "Carly: Well, I was intending to make you spinach and gruel.",
        "J.J: Gruel?",
        "Parker: No way!",
        "J.J: Dad, save us!",
        "Jack: You know, it really would be good for Natalie and Faith to have a distraction. Of course, it's up to you.",
        "Carly: Well, the kids can stay. That's okay with me. But I should go.",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, then leave them and I'll run by the house later.",
        "Carly: You want to take care of five children?",
        "Jack: Why not? Sure. Hey, Faith, look who's here!",
        "Faith: You're back!",
        "J.J: Yeah, I rode a moose.",
        "Parker: Nuh-uh, don't believe him. He's making it up.",
        "J.J: No, I'm not. Hey, guess what? Cooties!",
        "Faith: Cooties back!",
        "Carly: They're all yours.",
        "Jack: You know, on second thought --",
        "Carly: It's too late for that.",
        "Jack: Okay. Okay. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You shouldn't be up here.",
        "Katie: I need air.",
        "Simon: Not out here, you don't. It's too dangerous. Please, come back inside. Come on!",
        "Katie: If it was that dangerous, they would've closed the deck.",
        "Simon: Fair enough. Just don't look at the waves, it'll make it worse.",
        "Katie: You're making it worse.",
        "Simon: Come on, am I really still that much of a threat?",
        "Katie: Please leave.",
        "Simon: What?",
        "Katie: Please, just leave me alone.",
        "Simon: All right. Fine. Whoops. Whoa! I'm burnin' up baby",
        "Katie: You are unbelievable! You were just leaving!",
        "Simon: Hey, I want to leave. But I just don't think you want me to.",
        "Katie: Trust me, I do.",
        "Simon: Okay, all right, okay. Then riddle me this. If you want absolutely nothing to do with me, why did you try to scare Vienna away? Huh?",
        "Katie: It's my civic duty. Even someone like Vienna doesn't deserve to be robbed blind by you.",
        "Simon: You were worried about her? That's really sweet.",
        "Katie: I'm trying to be the bigger person.",
        "Simon: Or just maybe -- you don't like seeing me with someone else.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Simon: Yeah, I'm just saying, I still think there's a little something between us. Admit it.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Vienna: You! I'll give you $500 to get me some medicine to get rid of this sea sickness.",
        "Waiter: Really?",
        "Vienna: Get it here in five minutes and I'll double it!",
        "Mike: You look a little green.",
        "Vienna: That is so not my color. Have you seen Simon?",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Vienna: He was supposed to get me some medicine.",
        "Mike: If you promised him $500, I'm sure he'll be back with it.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God, we're going down!",
        "Mike: No, no, we're not going down. It's just fine.",
        "Vienna: That's what they said about the titanic. And the next thing we know, there's gonna be lifeboats and fat, brave women with tiaras and Celine Dion, she'll start pounding her chest and --",
        "Mike: Easy.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick!",
        "Mike: No, no, no, no, no. Whoa, not there, not there, not there! In here! In here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Bye, good-bye. Good-bye. Be good, okay? Can you manage to do that?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Parker: I want to grill.",
        "J.J: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Jack: No, no, no. I am the grill master. Here, you take the dogs. You take the buns. Move 'em on out. Oh, I forgot your sister. Hey, hey, would you mind if Sage watched a video with you and Natalie? Oh, great.",
        "Carly: Bye, Sweetheart.",
        "Faith: Are you going to see my mom?",
        "Carly: Yes, I will see her tomorrow.",
        "Faith: She's still in the hospital. I can't see her.",
        "Carly: Well, from what I hear, she's still sleeping.",
        "Faith: For a long time.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Faith: Why is she so tired?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I think the doctors will have to figure that one out.",
        "Faith: When is she going to wake up?",
        "Carly: Oh, boy. That's another question that I don't know the answer to.",
        "Faith: Aren't you supposed to? You're a grown-up.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but the thing is, sometimes even grown-ups don't have all the answers. That's kind of scary, isn't it? You've been taking very good care of Natalie, haven't you?",
        "Faith: She's a pain.",
        "Carly: Sometimes sisters are. And sometimes they're the best. Hey, I have a good idea.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Carly: Why don't you and I go get manicures tomorrow? We'll leave Sage and Natalie with our sitter and we'll have kind of a girls' day.",
        "Faith: Girls rule!",
        "Carly: Yeah! Yes, we do. And after our manicures, we'll go and get your mom a little present.",
        "Faith: And the baby in her tummy?",
        "Carly: Well, yeah, if that's what you want. Sure. Now how would you like to go play with those boys?",
        "Faith: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Yeah. So, how's it going?",
        "Jack: Not as good as in here, apparently. She asked you about Lily?",
        "Carly: Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have a single answer.",
        "Jack: You were great.",
        "Carly: I should go.",
        "Jack: No, don't. Please. Stay.",

        "Kim: You okay?",
        "Will: Okay? What would that look like?",
        "Kim: Darned if I know. Well, is there anything at all I can do for you, darling?",
        "Will: Make it all go away?",
        "Kim: Oh, my dear, would that I could. There's your dad.",
        "Will: I know I should feel better, having all of us here, but it's just like -- it's like -- without Jen, there's no family.",
        "Kim: I don't want to hear that kind of talk from you. Your family needs you, now more than ever. Now, you got that?",
        "Hal: I just got word that Jennifer's back in the hospital. What happened?",
        "Barbara: She's going to be okay. She's going to be all right.",

        "Paul: There's nothing going on, Jen.",

        "Jennifer: What does that mean? In English.",
