        "Carly is distracted by thoughts of Holden, as she replays his message of concern repeatedly. Lily is happy Holden is home, but he is riddled with guilt. Lily calls Carly and asks her to watch Ethan while she and Holden have some alone time, as Carly agrees. Sophie continues to twist the knife subtly to Paul about being pregnant; she remarks that he hasn't told Meg yet because he knows she will leave him. Meg shops for wedding dresses. A distraught and furious Barbara learns Sophie is pregnant. She advises Paul to make sure that the baby is his by getting a sonogram done. When Carly misspeaks, Lily learns Carly was with Holden at the camp but is glad. Carly and Holden try to hide their awkwardness. Lily secretly tells Carly that she is going to wear her new lingerie for Holden, as Carly can't help but be sad. Meg is worried about buying a dress too soon; she doesn't want to jinx things. Paula asks Sophie to get a sonogram; at first, she balks but then she agrees. Paul asks the doctor to perform the sonogram and she agrees. Barbara gets Meg to agree to let her make her wedding dress only if she promises to take it easy during the process. Barbara learns Meg is having lunch with friends and is on her way to pick one of them up at the Ob-Gyn wing of the hospital; Barbara warns Paul. Sophie's sonogram takes place while Paul is out of the room and she learns that Paul can't be her baby's father. Meg finds Paul at the hospital and he pretends to be there to ask her and her friends to lunch. Lily seduces Holden, who is guilty and not really in the mood, but when Lily questions him on his mood, Holden sleeps with Lily. Lily wants him to move back in, but Holden is unsure. Lily talks about how she has changed; she promises that while she won't be perfect she will be honest; when she waxes on about how honest he is, Holden becomes uncomfortable and changes the subject. Soon, Holden is also agreeing to move back home. Sophie calls Cole with a favor; she wants him to steal her a sonogram for a woman who is 2 months along. Paul is preoccupied at lunch but is charming nonetheless. Cole does as he is told and Sophie calls Paul and asks him to come back to the hospital to see the sonogram. Carly learns that Holden is moving back home with Lily. Meg's friends are impressed with Paul and toast to her future with him. Sophie shows Paul the fake sonogram. Paul tells Barbara that Sophie's baby is his and worries about losing Meg. Barbara tells him to marry Meg soon and leave Sophie to her. Carly and Holden meet in secret where he tells her that he has to be honest with Lily and tell her what happened between them, as Carly pleads wit him not to. Cole tells Sophie that he is not taking her small pay off and leaving town because he knows that the baby is his and if she wants him to stay quiet then she is going to have to get used to paying him off regularly from now on. Lily tells Ethan that his daddy is coming home. Holden thinks he has to be honest, but Carly thinks it is selfish because it is going to devastate Lily; he will lose his wife and she her best friend. Holden finally agrees not to say anything. Carly tells Holden to go take care of his wife and they will pretend that the night before never happened again, as an emotional Carly walks away and a saddened Holden watches her go."

        "Holden: Carly, I've been thinking about what happened. I understand why you had to leave, but I'm worried. I hope you got home in the storm and you're okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Anybody home?",
        "Lily: Holden? Oh, I was so worried about you last night.",
        "Holden: You got my message, right?",
        "Lily: Yes, I did, but I was glued to the weather station. The storm -- it was horrible.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I thought my truck would make it, but the main road -- it was so flooded out.",
        "Lily: No, you were right to spend the night. So, how was it? Did you have fun? Was it like being a kid again?",
        "Holden: Not really.",
        "Lily: No? No sitting around the campfire telling ghost stories?",
        "Holden: No, it was pouring. The girls -- they stayed in the cabin.",
        "Lily: That's right. So, where did you sleep?",
        "Holden: In a broken bunk.",
        "Lily: Oh, my poor baby. Was it uncomfortable?",
        "Holden: I survived.",
        "Lily: I wish I had been there with you. How was the talent show?",
        "Holden: Faith and Nat were great. So was Sage. They were lucky. They got off the stage before it started to rain. And, uh, Faith -- she made this for you.",
        "Lily: She did? It's adorable. She -- she's incredible. How's it look?",
        "Holden: It's very nice.",
        "Lily: Holden, what's wrong? You're like a million miles away.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Lily: Is there a problem?",
        "Holden: I'm just a little disappointed that I didn't get back for our trip to Montana.",
        "Lily: Well, it's no big deal. We can reschedule it.",
        "Holden: Yeah, we can go anytime.",
        "Lily: You look a little worn out. [Laughs] I'm guessing you didn't get much sleep in that broken bunk.",
        "Holden: I'm fine.",
        "Lily: You know what? Why don't you go upstairs and take a shower? I'm sure I've got some clean shirts up there for you somewhere. Want to take a nap? I could join you.",
        "Holden: Okay. Whatever.",
        "Lily: Let's forget about the trip for now. We can spend some time together right here at home.",
        "Holden: Gonna get that shower.",
        "Lily: Hmm.",
        "Holden: And you're okay.",

        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Lily: Hey, Carly, it's me. Can you do me a favor?",
        "Carly: Sure. Sure. Anything.",
        "Lily: Could you come over and pick up Ethan and take him for a while?",
        "Carly: Why? What's going on?",
        "Lily: Well, Holden just got back, and we really need to spend some time together. I'd take Ethan over to my mother's, but you're so much closer. Hey, Carly, listen, if it's inconvenient, it's really not a problem.",
        "Carly: No. No, I'd love to have him. I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hey. Did you tell Meg our good news? What did she say when she found out we're having a baby?",
        "Paul: Will you keep your voice down?",
        "Sofie: You didn't tell her.",
        "Paul: No, I didn't tell her.",
        "Sofie: Well, you know, you really shouldn't put it off, because I'm gonna start showing soon. I mean, what's the matter? You afraid to bring it up again that you cheated on her?",
        "Paul: Meg and I were not together when this -- when this happened.",
        "Sofie: Well, something's stopping you from telling her the truth, and want to know what I think? Well, I think that you think that when she finds out, she's not gonna want to marry you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay. Come here. What do you think? Will Paul say \"I do\" or \"I don't\"?",
        "Laurel: It is beautiful. And, Meg, you could wear a burlap sack, and it still wouldn't make him change his mind.",
        "Meg: I don't know. Do you think it's too tight?",
        "Laurel: Meg, what are you so worked up about? You're not pregnant, are you?",
        "Meg: No. I am gonna wait till after we're married to try and have kids again.",
        "Laurel: Well, um, this dress will definitely put him in the mood.",
        "Meg: Well, that's a good thing.",
        "Laurel: Yeah.",
        "Meg: I just need to convince my mom that, too.",
        "Laurel: Why does your mother need convincing?",
        "Meg: Well, Paul and I were supposed to get married once before, but something happened, and I called it off. And I don't think my mom's ever forgiven him for that. Among other things.",
        "Laurel: That is all water under the bridge. You and Paul finally got it together, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know, I may be jinxing it, but it feels like everything is finally working out.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not worried about Meg. She's totally committed to me.",
        "Sofie: Well, if that's the case, then I don't understand --",
        "Barbara: What the hell is she still doing here?",
        "Paul: Mom, shouldn't you be resting?",
        "Barbara: Don't change the subject, Paul. I thought you were going to have this troublemaker evicted.",
        "Paul: I changed my mind.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Sofie: Well, maybe you should tell your mom.",
        "Paul: You stay out of this.",
        "Sofie: Okay. You do the honors. See you later.",
        "Barbara: Paul, what was she insinuating? Tell me what's going on.",
        "Paul: Sofie's pregnant, and she's swearing that it's mine.",
        "Barbara: You're not believing her. She can't be telling the truth. She's lying.",
        "Paul: I wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm here to pick up Ethan.",
        "Holden: Well, I was so worried that you ended up in a ditch somewhere.",
        "Carly: As you can see, I'm fine.",
        "Holden: You got my message?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Just now. You don't have to worry about me.",
        "Holden: I can't help it. Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Carly: What do you think?",
        "Lily: Carly, is that you? Hi.",
        "Holden: Carly's here to pick up Ethan.",
        "Lily: Oh, you're the best. Come on in. Thank you so much for doing this.",
        "Carly: No problem. Oh, that bracelet is beautiful. Faith was so proud that she made it for you.",
        "Lily: How did you know Faith made it?",
        "Carly: I can explain that.",
        "Lily: You didn't tell me that Carly was at the camp with you last night.",
        "Holden: Yeah, Carly was at the camp, too.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Holden: I was going to. I just never got around to it.",
        "Carly: I was bringing J.J. to the boys' camp on the other side of the lake. I thought I'd swing around and see how Sage was doing. I didn't even know that Holden would be there.",
        "Holden: Funny how we both ended up there at the same time, right?",
        "Carly: Didn't intend to stay, but there was a talent show.",
        "Holden: The girls begged us.",
        "Carly: We couldn't let them down.",
        "Lily: Of course not. I'm sure you guys had a wonderful time. Wish I could have been there.",
        "Carly: That would have been better. For the girls.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm sure you guys made the most of it. Did you have to stay the night because of the storm?",
        "Carly: No. I took my chances with the back roads. I was fine. I got home safe and sound.",
        "Lily: Thank goodness.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll, uh, go get Ethan ready.",
        "Lily: Thank you so much for doing this. I mean, even if we can't go away, at least we can spend some quality time together. Remember that sexy lingerie you helped me pick out? I'm planning to put it to very good use.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Sofie can't be pregnant.",
        "Paul: Mom, I bought her a second pregnancy test and I waited while she took it.",
        "Barbara: That doesn't mean you're the father, Paul.",
        "Paul: Mom, I had sex with her.",
        "Barbara: You and who else? That's the question.",
        "Paul: Well, since then, she says nobody.",
        "Barbara: After all the lies that girl has told, you're gonna believe this? Does Meg know about this?",
        "Paul: I can't bring myself to tell her. It's gonna kill her.",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe she doesn't have to find out.",
        "Paul: I'm not gonna lie to her.",
        "Barbara: You have to prove that the baby isn't yours. So you make Sofie get a sonogram, and then when you see how far along she is, you can do the math. Maybe you're not the father after all.",
        "Paul: Hold that thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Laurel: Meg, I thought you liked that one. Why don't you buy it?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm superstitious. We haven't set a date yet. I might be rushing things.",
        "Laurel: If it's what you want, why wait?",
        "Meg: I don't know. Paul and I have messed up before. I don't want anything to go wrong again.",
        "Laurel: Meg, of course something will go wrong. It's life. [Chuckles] You just need to have hope and just take a chance on it.",
        "Meg: I have waited a long time for this, haven't I? [Laughs] And after everything Paul and I have been through, I think we have earned a little happiness, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Sofie: Paul, hi, come in. Come in. How's your mom?",
        "Paul: Uh, she's fine. Why don't you get your stuff and come with me?",
        "Sofie: Where?",
        "Paul: Uh, to the hospital.",
        "Sofie: Um.",
        "Paul: We're gonna get you a full prenatal exam.",
        "Sofie: Now?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Why wait?",
        "Sofie: I-I'm -- I-I just had a little morning sickness.",
        "Paul: All the more reason to get you checked out. You really can't be too careful when there's a little one involved.",
        "Sofie: That's really sweet.",
        "Paul: Here. Come on.",
        "Sofie: Well, this isn't really just about the baby, is it?",
        "Paul: Um, Sofie, look, I am not happy that you're pregnant. But if this is my baby, then I'm gonna be responsible.",
        "Sofie: I'm glad you said that, because I really want to do the right thing for this baby. But, you know, we don't have to treat it like it's an emergency. I'll make an appointment with the doctor for next week. I promise, and I'll keep you updated.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that doesn't work for me.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, 'cause you don't trust me.",
        "Paul: Better safe than sorry.",
        "Sofie: You know, I'm having -- I'm having your baby, Paul. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to it.",
        "Paul: I've already lost two babies, Sofie. I'm not gonna go through that again.",
        "Sofie: You know -- you know, we're really a lot alike. We've both lost out on a chance to be parents. So maybe this time -- maybe this time it's meant to be.",
        "Paul: Sofie, let's get something straight. If we do have this baby together, that doesn't mean that you and I have a future.",
        "Sofie: You don't know that.",
        "Paul: Will you please come to the hospital with me?",
        "Sofie: Yes. Anything for our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How'd it go?",
        "Sofie: Fine. Fine. You don't have to worry about a thing, Paul.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Everything looks good for a healthy first trimester.",
        "Sofie: See, I told you.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I'll recommend some prenatal vitamins. Other than that, the basic ground rules apply -- no alcohol, easy on the caffeine, and treat yourself to a healthy diet with plenty of protein, calcium, and folic acid.",
        "Sofie: I know the drill.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Ah, that's right. Second pregnancy. You're an old pro.",
        "Paul: So, how many weeks?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Can't really say for sure until we do a sonogram, which we should probably schedule within the next month or so.",
        "Paul: Today. Let's get it done today. I want to know exactly how far along she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Barbara: It's open. Come on in.",
        "Meg: Hey, it's Meg.",
        "Barbara: Hi.",
        "Meg: I hope I'm not bothering you.",
        "Barbara: No, no, come on in.",
        "Meg: How are you feeling?",
        "Barbara: I'm better, thank you. How's the shopping going?",
        "Meg: Well, I haven't selected a wedding dress yet. But I do have a few good prospects.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm sure they're lovely, but I still wish you'd let me design something for you.",
        "Meg: That would be incredible, but I can't let you do that. You have too much going on.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I need to have a goal. I need to be strong enough so I can dance at your wedding.",
        "Meg: Definitely. Which is exactly why I don't want you to overdoing it with the dress.",
        "Barbara: I'll have my seamstress do all the heavy lifting. I'll do what I just do best -- I will design and supervise.",
        "Meg: Mm. Well, that does sound like a plan.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Barbara: You will be the most spectacular bride, and not because of the dress.",
        "Meg: Thank you. I appreciate it, especially since I know you have so much going on.",
        "Barbara: It helps to think about the future and not about the alternative.",
        "Meg: You know, you really are amazing. Your son says so all the time. Where is Paul, anyway?",
        "Barbara: Um, he had an errand to run.",
        "Meg: Oh, okay. Well, um, can you tell him that I'm having lunch downstairs with one of my friends -- Laurel -- and if he comes back in time, he can join us.",
        "Barbara: I'm sure he would love that.",
        "Meg: I'm gonna stop by the hospital first to pick up another friend, Deb. She's works in obstetrics, actually. So, I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Isn't it too soon for a sonogram? I mean, it's -- it's not necessary, Doctor. It's so early.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, we'll have more data if we wait, but it's up to you.",
        "Paul: I think we should do it now. In fact, I insist. If there's something wrong with this kid, we should find out sooner rather than later, right?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Very well. I'll set it up. The technician will be in soon.",
        "Paul: If this is my kid, like you're swearing it is, then you've got nothing to worry about, right?",
        "Sofie: Right.",
        "Paul: So let's just see what happens.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Tech: All set for your sonogram?",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. We can't wait, right, Dear?",
        "Sofie: We're -- we're very excited.",
        "Doctor: It's a big moment -- getting that first look at your little one.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Wouldn't miss it for the world. [Cell phone rings] I'll be right outside.",
        "Sofie: I have a question. Uh, how -- how accurate is this test when it comes to, uh, date of conception?",
        "Tech: Pretty accurate. We should be able to calculate exactly how far along you are.",
        "Paul: Mom, this is kind of a bad time. What do you want?",
        "Barbara: You need to get out of there now.",
        "Paul: Why? What happened?",
        "Barbara: Meg is on her way over to the hospital to pick up a friend, a nurse, and guess which department she works in -- ob-gyn. Has Sofie had her sonogram yet?",
        "Paul: She's getting it right now.",
        "Barbara: Well, unless you want to share that very special baby picture with Meg, you'd better get moving.",
        "Sofie: That's my baby? It's so tiny.",
        "Tech: The fetus measures about 3.6 millimeters. That's normal at about four weeks.",
        "Sofie: So I'm only four weeks?",
        "Tech: Or a little less.",
        "Sofie: And, uh, how -- how big would the baby be if I were, say, uh, two months?",
        "Tech: About 20 millimeters. Why?",
        "Sofie: Just curious.",
        "Tech: Want me to stick around in case your husband has any questions?",
        "Sofie: No, no, that's okay. Um, I'll tell him everything he needs to know.",
        "Tech: Okay, then. Good luck.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cole: Hello?",
        "Sofie: Cole, it's me.",
        "Cole: Mm. Sofie, how's it going?",
        "Sofie: Cole, please, tell me that you haven't left town yet.",
        "Cole: Nope, still in Oakdale. I need a little more cash before I head back to L.A.",
        "Sofie: I think that I could help you out.",
        "Cole: I'm listening.",
        "Sofie: Come to the hospital right away. The ob-gyn floor, and make sure that nobody sees you, especially not Paul.",
        "Meg: Paul.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Can I make you some more eggs?",
        "Holden: No. No, thanks. Uh, this was terrific. I should get back to the farm, check on the horses.",
        "Lily: Not yet. I mean, we would be on the plane right now on our way to Montana.",
        "Holden: So?",
        "Lily: Well, the horses were all set to get along without you for a little while. I mean, why did we have Carly take Ethan? We have this whole house to ourselves. I missed you last night.",
        "Holden: I missed you, too.",
        "Lily: Let's go upstairs.",
        "Holden: Sure. Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, look, Ethan -- this horse. It looks just like the one your daddy rides, huh?",
        "Ethan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Here, you take him. He belongs to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Well, what do you think?",
        "Holden: It's beautiful.",
        "Lily: We don't need to go on vacation to have a good time.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Lily: I got this for you the other day. Hope you like it. Holden. [Holden groans] What's going on? You haven't been the same since you got home. Is there something you need to tell me? Ooh, what's this?",
        "Holden: Everything's fine.",
        "Lily: Where did you go just now?",
        "Holden: Uh, nowhere.",
        "Lily: Are you sure? I mean, you seemed to just zone out there for a second.",
        "Holden: Well, what do you expect when you wear an outfit like that?",
        "Lily: I could take it off.",
        "Holden: No. That's my job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, why did you come to the hospital? It's not a problem with your mother, is it?",
        "Paul: Oh, no, no. It's not problem, but it does kind of have to do with my mom, because she told me that you were here meeting your friends. And so I thought I would come by and see if I could take you all to lunch.",
        "Meg: That's very sweet.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, nothing better than a big bottle of champagne in the middle of the afternoon.",
        "Meg: Well, that sounds wonderful, but where is all this coming from?",
        "Paul: Um, what? I'm not allowed to celebrate our engagement?",
        "Meg: Yeah. It's just -- I don't know -- impulsive.",
        "Paul: Well, impulsive is good, right? You know, it gets crowded. We should go. You know, before we lose all the really good tables.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul?",
        "Cole: Hey, hey.",
        "Sofie: Oh, hey. Thanks for coming.",
        "Cole: Yeah, make it quick. If security sees me, I'm done.",
        "Sofie: Okay, I know. Come on, come on. We have to do this in private.",
        "Cole: Hey, let's get one thing straight from the start -- I'm not stealing any more drugs.",
        "Sofie: You don't have to, all right? You see this? This is a sonogram.",
        "Cole: I've seen a sonogram before. Where's the baby?",
        "Sofie: It's only a month along. Okay, you see this? It says 3.6 millimeters. All right, I want you to go into the medical-records room. I want you to find a sonogram just like this. The baby has to be two months along. It will say that the fetus is about 20 millimeters, okay? And then I want you to switch this one with that one. You got it?",
        "Cole: What are you up to now?",
        "Sofie: You don't have to know.",
        "Cole: This is yours, isn't it? You preggers again? I want to know what's going on.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you know what? It's doesn't matter, Cole. It doesn't matter. Look, if you do this, I will give you an extra $10,000, okay? Do you want the money or not?",
        "Cole: Where are you gonna get it from? I thought I tapped you out the last 10 grand you gave me.",
        "Sofie: I know where to get more.",
        "Cole: You been holding out on me?",
        "Woman: Excuse me. I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you go. You go now before anybody else sees you.",
        "Cole: You're gonna owe me for this, Sofie -- big time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: And, uh, maybe a bottle of champagne, like a really good bottle of champagne.",
        "Waiter: Right away, Sir.",
        "Paul: Thanks. So, um, thank you for letting me crash. I've just felt like celebrating since Meg said yes.",
        "Laurel: Oh. Meg said that you were very romantic, but it's good to have some proof, isn't it?",
        "Deb: You are one lucky lady, Meg.",
        "Meg: Yes, I am. Sometimes I don't believe it myself. Are you okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm okay.",
        "Meg: It's just like you seem kind of manic. Something happen?",
        "Paul: No, nothing. I'm -- I'm thrilled. The most beautiful woman in the world said she'd marry me.",
        "Deb: So, have you guys set an actual date yet?",
        "Meg: No, we haven't nailed it down yet. But, uh, Paul wants it to be soon.",
        "Laurel: Men are so impatient.",
        "Meg: Yeah. That's what we love about them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: Sorry for the delay. You need to go over your sonogram results?",
        "Sofie: That's -- that's fine. No rush, no rush.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Strange. Your file is gone.",
        "Sofie: Oh, maybe the technician took it.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I'll go track it down.",
        "Sofie: Oh, take your time. The father seems to be missing in action, too.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I have another patient, but I'll be right back.",
        "Sofie: Thank you. Hurry up, Cole. Do something right for once in your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: That was amazing. Not that it isn't always, just -- wow. I don't know. Maybe it's because you went away.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Lily: It's just being separated -- it's made everything so much more intense. Holden, we came so close to losing everything. And now it's like every moment is more precious.",
        "Holden: It is.",
        "Lily: But enough being separated. Whatever we needed to learn, we've learned it. So I want you to move back in right away.",
        "Holden: You sure about that?",
        "Lily: Aren't you?",
        "Holden: Well, yeah. But I, you know, don't want us rushing into anything until we're truly ready.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm ready. I miss you. I need you. The kids need you.",
        "Holden: The girls are still at camp.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but think of how ecstatic they'll be if you're home when they get here.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but what if --",
        "Lily: If what?",
        "Holden: Well, I don't know. I'm not making any predictions here, but if something happens and things don't work out, I don't want to disappoint them again.",
        "Lily: I don't want to, either. But I think it's what they really need. We all do. We love each other, don't we?",
        "Holden: Of course.",
        "Lily: I know that it's been a long road, and I've made terrible mistakes along the way. But I want you to see how hard I really have been trying to change.",
        "Holden: Well, I see it. I see it, and it means a lot.",
        "Lily: And I can't promise you that I'm gonna be perfect, but I really feel like I've learned to be more honest. And I've learned that from watching you, Holden.",
        "Holden: No, no, don't say that.",
        "Lily: It's true. It's true. It's like -- it's like you don't know how to lie. It's just not in you.",
        "Holden: Don't make me sound so perfect. I'm anything but.",
        "Lily: You haven't lied to me.",
        "Holden: I've been judgmental, and I was harsh. I was a lot harder on you than I should have been.",
        "Lily: When two people love each other, they have a right to expect honesty.",
        "Holden: They also need to understand that people make mistakes sometimes.",
        "Lily: Not you. Not like me, anyway.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm just as human as you are.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but it's safe to say that your mistakes are ancient history and mine are much more recent and hurtful.",
        "Holden: Okay, let's not go there, okay?",
        "Lily: What? You don't think I have more to be sorry for right now than you do?",
        "Holden: No, I-I don't.",
        "Lily: What do you have to be sorry for?",
        "Holden: I-I have faults, serious ones.",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. Yeah, you do. You have a bad habit of leaving your dirty socks on the floor. [Laughs] But you know what? I love you anyway, dirty laundry be damned. So say you love me, too, and we'll call it a truce.",
        "Holden: I love you, too.",
        "Lily: Enough to move back in with me?",
        "Holden: Yes.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Holden: I'm sure. I want us to be together. I want us to be a family again.",
        "Lily: Holden, that's what I want more than anything. I wish we could stay like this forever, but we can't. We've got to get up.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Lily: 'Cause Carly's coming with Ethan. Oh, Holden, I can't wait to tell her the good news.",
        "Lily: Hey, you guys. How's my big guy? Did you have fun? Come on in.",
        "Carly: Thanks. So, uh, how'd it go with Holden?",
        "Lily: Mm. A little private time was just what we needed. As long as I live, I am never gonna be able to thank you enough.",
        "Carly: All I did was baby-sit.",
        "Lily: Well, while you were just babysitting, my prayers were answered. Holden is gonna move back in. We're officially back together.",
        "Carly: That's fantastic.",
        "Lily: And it's all because of you.",
        "Carly: What -- what do you mean?",
        "Lily: Well, you've been such a good friend, and I know you put in a good word for me at camp yesterday with Holden.",
        "Carly: Whatever happened at the camp, it had nothing to do with it, believe me.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on, Carly. I know you. I mean, Holden was a completely different person when he got back. It's like whatever you did -- it was amazing.",
        "Carly: I know how much you and Holden love each other. And if things worked out, you did that, not me.",
        "Lily: Don't sell yourself short. You've always been our biggest cheerleader. Oh, Carly, I don't know what we would've done without you. I will always be grateful. Hey, just in time. Can you keep Carly company while I put Ethan down for his nap?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Lily: Okay, big guy, nap time. Let's go.",
        "Carly: I should go.",
        "Holden: I'll walk you out. Hold it. Meet me at the stables. We need to talk.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'll be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I got to go.",
        "Meg: What? Wait, you hardly touched your food.",
        "Laurel: This dressing is fabulous.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's -- I-I got to take this.",
        "Meg: Okay. Okay.",
        "Deb: Okay, he is such a sweetheart, Meg.",
        "Laurel: He is one in a million.",
        "Paul: What do you want?",
        "Sofie: Paul, where are you?",
        "Paul: Sofie, what is it?",
        "Sofie: Well, I just got the sonogram results. Don't you want to see them?",
        "Paul: Be right there.",
        "Meg: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Paul: Um, one of the board members is kind of bent out of shape. I have to go smooth over some egos.",
        "Meg: Okay, will you call me when you're done?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you got it. Please tell your friends I said goodbye.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I will. You're positive everything is fine.",
        "Paul: I promise you that when I get back, I'll be all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul, there you are.",
        "Paul: Sorry to keep you waiting.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Not a problem. We've got the results of Sofie's sonogram.",
        "Paul: And what does that mean?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, first of all, you'll be happy to know that the baby is perfectly healthy. Everything looks --",
        "Paul: So, how many weeks?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, if you see this measurement right here, uh, the fetus is at 20 millimeters, which works out to be about two months. Congratulations to you both. You, don't forget to take your vitamins and follow the other instructions I gave you, and I'll see you at your next checkup.",
        "Sofie: Thank you, Doctor. So, now do you believe it's your baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If you're gonna tell me that you're moving back in with Lily, she already gave me the good news.",
        "Holden: That's only part of what I have to say.",
        "Carly: You're doing the right thing. I completely understand. You know that I've always wanted things to work out for you two.",
        "Holden: I'm not so sure things have really worked out.",
        "Carly: They will if you let them. You do still want to be with Lily, don't you?",
        "Holden: I do. But I can't be, not until I tell her the truth.",
        "Carly: The truth about what?",
        "Holden: The truth about us. That we slept together.",
        "Carly: No, Holden, you can't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deb: This champagne must have cost the earth.",
        "Meg: [Laughing] Yeah. Paul, uh, wants nothing but the best.",
        "Laurel: Well, he has good taste in bubbly and in brides. [Laughter] Even if he is a little unpredictable.",
        "Meg: Uh, yeah, that's an understatement. But that's what I love about him -- you never know what he's gonna do next.",
        "Laurel: Well, it keeps things exciting.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, there was a time when things were a little too exciting. And for a while there, I wanted nothing to do with it. But I never doubted how much he loved me.",
        "Deb: Oh.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] Yeah, I know, it sounds a little corny, but it's true. He never stopped loving me. And it feels like we've turned this corner, because I can trust him now. This time, it's gonna be different. It's gonna last.",
        "Laurel: Well, to a long and happy future and to lots of expensive champagne.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I saw the sonogram myself. Sofie's baby was conceived two months ago, exactly when I made the worst mistake of my life. How am I gonna tell Meg?",
        "Barbara: Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?",
        "Paul: We lost our baby because of me. We almost didn't get back from that. Meg finds out that Sofie's having my kid. Mom, how do I get out of this?",
        "Barbara: I'll tell you how. You marry Meg as soon as you can and you leave Sofie to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sofie: Okay. This -- this is all of it. But this time, you really have to leave town.",
        "Cole: Why should I? You're my own little ATM.",
        "Sofie: You know what? Cole, I can't -- I can't deal with you right now. I'm tired and I'm sick to my stomach and I would -- I would really, really like for you to give me a break just this once.",
        "Cole: No can do, Sweetheart.",
        "Sofie: Why not?",
        "Cole: I may not be a math whiz, but even I can figure this one out. That little bun in the oven -- that's ours, right?",
        "Sofie: There's no way you can know that for sure.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I pretty much can. And this 10 grand's not gonna cut it. So if you want me to help you convince Paul Ryan that my kid is his little bundle of joy, it's gonna cost you. I'm talking regular payments for a long, long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So, you couldn't sleep, huh? Mommy doesn't blame you. I have been so excited. This has been an incredible day. Guess what. Daddy is moving home with us, and he's never going away again. Mm. Give me kiss. I love you, Pumpkin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If you tell Lily that we slept together, you'll break her heart. Why would you want to do that?",
        "Holden: Because I've been telling her for months that we can't lie to each other. How do I go back to her and lie about this?",
        "Carly: Telling the truth might be a fine, moral, upstanding thing to do, but sometimes it's also very selfish. If you tell her, it may relieve your guilt, but it will just cause her pain.",
        "Holden: It'll be worse if she finds out later.",
        "Carly: Why does she have to find out at all? Don't do this to her. Don't do it to me. I have a relationship at stake here, too, you know. Lily is my best friend. I can't lose her, Holden. I don't have anybody else. All we have to do is end this. We'll pretend that what we did last night never happened. You move back in with Lily. You be a good husband, a good father. Please don't throw everything away because of one stupid mistake.",
        "Holden: All right. All right, if you think that that's what's best.",
        "Carly: It's the only way. You do the right thing. Take care of your wife.",
        "[Engine turns over]",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Margo: What is it that Emily did to make you her protector?",
        "Casey: If you really want to know the truth, I'll tell you. I love you. No.",
        "Barbara: I can simply make you disappear.",
        "Sofie: Are you threatening to kill me?",
        "Mike: Sofie is pregnant with Paul's baby."
