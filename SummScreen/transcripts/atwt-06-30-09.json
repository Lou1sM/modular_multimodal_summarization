        "Meg: Is she still sleeping?",
        "Paul: She just opened her eyes.",
        "Meg: Aww! Perfect timing! She'll be awake for your whole visit.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and she'll sleep through the whole night for you.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Got to love that. Hey, can you grab me a bib?",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "Paul: So, uh, I heard a rumor at my old company there's some kind of battle between Dusty and Damian over company stock.",
        "Meg: Well, hopefully, the battle is over. I'm going to stick these peaches in here. It's Eliza's new favorite.",
        "Paul: Peaches. Something tells me that the battle wasn't really about the company. You must be flattered.",
        "Meg: Why would I be? Two supposedly adult males doing everything they can to hurt each other just to impress me. You think that's flattering? Aw, men. Eliza, sometimes they just don't get it.",
        "Paul: You're right. I don't get it. What did I do? Did I say something? Why are you mad at me?",
        "Meg: You thought I'd be flattered! Have a good time, Honey. Here. Goodbye, Paul.",
        "Paul: Bye, Meg. I can see you still like me, I think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Riley, would you get me a sip of water over there?",
        "Riley: Yeah, sure.",
        "Tom: I could have gotten that for you.",
        "Margo: Oh, no. Then you'd have to let go of my hand. I'm never going to let that happen. Thank you.",
        "Tom: Did you thank Riley for saving your mom's life? Because none of us would be smiling right now if it wasn't for him.",
        "Riley: Margo saved my life first. Mayer would have shot me if she hadn't stepped in and saved me.",
        "Tom: And you stopped Mayer from getting off a second shot. So then I guess you're both heroes.",
        "Doctor: Give me a few minutes. I need to check out the patient.",
        "Casey: Dad, do you think I could talk to you for a second?",
        "Tom: Sure, but your mom is going to be fine. I don't want you --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Tom: Hold on. Oh, I got to take this. It's the police station. Hello? Hey, Dallas. What's up? I'd be happy to tell her that. Sure, thanks.",
        "Riley: Is that about Colonel Mayer?",
        "Tom: Yeah. He's been caught. Noah and Luke are fine.",
        "Casey: Oh, that's good. That's really good.",
        "Tom: I'm going to run in and tell your mom. I -- I will be back.",
        "Riley: So, when are you going to tell them?",
        "Casey: As soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you want?",
        "Damian: Uh, to talk.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? I've been thinking about you and Dusty and the stocks, and what bothers me the most is that -- Damian, what's wrong? Come in.",
        "Damian: I've just been with Luke, chasing down Noah's father, and --",
        "Meg: What -- what are you talking about? Noah's father died last year.",
        "Damian: Turns out he didn't. He shot Margo Hughes and was trying to convince Noah to disappear with him.",
        "Meg: I had no idea. Is Margo all right?",
        "Damian: Yeah. The hospital said she was out of danger.",
        "Meg: And Noah?",
        "Damian: I don't know about emotionally, but physically, he's okay.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: How's Luke taking all this?",
        "Damian: Well, once we found Noah and knew he was safe, Luke was able to convince Noah to turn his father in. I think the two of them are probably in a good place right now.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Well, good. It sounds like everything turned out all right. So, what's got you so upset?",
        "Damian: I heard Luke talk to Noah about his father, and all I was thinking was, \"That could have been me.\"",
        "Meg: Damian, Noah's father is a psychopath. You are nothing like him.",
        "Damian: Yeah, but there were many years where I failed my son. I failed the person I love the most in the world, and I'm finding it very hard to live with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Bonnie: Whoa, whoa. You're in a hurry. What's got you on the warpath this time?",
        "Dusty: Nobody. Finally I've seen the light.",
        "Bonnie: Glory hallelujah. What's brought that on?",
        "Dusty: Well, you, actually -- that dinner we had. I've been thinking about it.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, me too.",
        "Dusty: All those things you said about me being angry.",
        "Bonnie: Mm.",
        "Dusty: You were right. I was trying to control Meg.",
        "Bonnie: Well, what do you know? You actually listened to me?",
        "Dusty: Well, no wonder she got rid of me. I acted like a jerk.",
        "Bonnie: Well, that's a hard habit to break.",
        "Dusty: Anyway, I'm going over there now to apologize. Hopefully, Meg and I can have a brand new start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So Mayer's in custody? That's excellent.",
        "Tom: Are you okay?",
        "Margo: Hmm.",
        "Tom: You seem distracted.",
        "Margo: Did you get a chance to talk to Casey? Did he tell you why he's so quiet?",
        "Tom: He was going to, and then I got that call, but -- I'll go talk to him now.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's kind of nice having you here.",
        "Tom: Well, it's nice having you here, too. I'll be right back. Hey. Sorry we got interrupted.",
        "Casey: Do you think we can talk somewhere private?",
        "Tom: Absolutely. Do you think we could put it off just for a little while? I thought I'd stick around till your mom falls asleep.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. That's fine.",
        "Tom: Oh, good. Now, in the meantime, I want you and Riley to go grab something to eat.",
        "Riley: No, that's okay. We're --",
        "Tom: Hey, come on. It's the least I can do for what you did for Margo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: How many times have you apologized to Meg? 50? 100?",
        "Dusty: I didn't have the awareness I have now.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I see.",
        "Dusty: Well, like you said, I got to give her space. Then she'll come back to me.",
        "Bonnie: You didn't exactly say that, but whatever. Good luck.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for the advice.",
        "Bonnie: What is it with you men? I mean, why are you so blind that you can't see when a woman wants to be left alone?",
        "Paul: Um, any man or woman in particular?",
        "Bonnie: Meg and Dusty, Damian. Probably you, too.",
        "Paul: Me? Why me?",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Bonnie: Why can't any of you just give the poor woman what she wants and let her be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: You know, we don't have to do this. We can just tell Tom that we came here --",
        "Casey: No, that's Dad. Not Tom. You know, I've lied to him enough about you already. So if he wants us to eat together, we're eating together.",
        "Riley: Even if we gag on it?",
        "Waiter: So, what can I get for you guys?",
        "Casey: Cheeseburger, well-done.",
        "Riley: I'll have the same. You want a beer?",
        "Casey: Yeah, a beer.",
        "Riley: Two beers.",
        "Casey and Riley: Uh, extra-crispy fries.",
        "Waiter: Coming right up.",
        "Riley: Remember how that started with us, the whole crispy-fry thing?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Riley: It was Mom. She used to always make those fries that were half-baked and soggy.",
        "Casey: And we ate them anyway.",
        "[Riley chuckles]",
        "Riley: You know, I can't even look at a fry now unless it's well-done. I mean, it must be the same for you.",
        "Casey: Don't, okay?",
        "Riley: What?",
        "Casey: Act like there's nothing wrong.",
        "Riley: I'm just trying to get through the meal, Casey.",
        "Casey: No, you're trying to make me cover for you, and I won't do it. I don't care what you and Mom want. Dad deserves to know.",
        "Riley: Why can't you just let this go?",
        "Casey: Where shall I start? How about what you did to Gwen?",
        "Riley: I'll never forgive myself for that.",
        "Casey: You tried to rape her, Adam. That's not fixed with an apology. And you stealing Riley Morgan's identity -- that deserves some jail time.",
        "Riley: No doubt.",
        "Casey: Well, you're going to have to face what you did, 'cause I'm not lying. Dad has a right to know.",
        "Riley: What about what Mom --",
        "Waiter: Here you go, guys.",
        "Riley: Thanks. What about what Mom wants? She could have died, Casey.",
        "Casey: Oh, y -- you're going to play the guilt card now?",
        "Riley: I'm just trying to show you that if you tell Dad, Mom is the one you hurt, even more than me.",
        "Casey: Because she doesn't want to send another son to prison. But you sure as hell deserve to be there more than I did.",
        "Riley: That's what it comes down to, isn't it? This isn't about Gwen or -- or me pretending to be Riley Morgan -- or you having to keep your mouth shut because mom wants you to. You're jealous. You're ticked because I got away with something and you didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: You need to sleep. Why don't you stop fighting it?",
        "Margo: No, 'cause if I go to sleep, you'll leave. Its fine, it's fine.",
        "Tom: Better?",
        "Margo: That's good.",
        "Tom: You know what I don't understand about Mayer?",
        "Margo: Hmm?",
        "Tom: What was he threatening Riley with? I mean, was there some kind of connection between them in the military?",
        "Margo: Oh, I don't really know. I didn't have time to chat.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm just going to ask Riley about it.",
        "Margo: You know, I think it might be, um, Casey was helping Noah, uh, with a film that he was making about his father.",
        "Tom: You got shot because Casey was working on Noah's film crew?",
        "Margo: Well, I don't know all the facts, of course, but I -- yeah, I guess we shouldn't really blame the boys. I definitely don't want Casey to feel guilty about what happened to me. He's got enough issues to deal with.",
        "Tom: I'm not blaming Casey. I'm just trying to make sense out of this.",
        "Margo: Well, I think we should just put it all behind us. Mayer is in custody, and we'll just, uh, let the whole deal go.",
        "Tom: Yeah. We will.",
        "Margo: All right. You know what? You can probably leave when the boys get back.",
        "Tom: Oh, so now you want to get rid of me?",
        "Margo: No, I just want to be home with my family, including Riley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm not interested in your lame analysis of me. You're dead wrong. I'm not mad because I'm jealous.",
        "Riley: All right, if you say so.",
        "Casey: Whether you call yourself Riley or Adam, you're still a user.",
        "Riley: I know I've been a lousy brother, Casey.",
        "Casey: And a human being.",
        "Riley: And that, too, all right? I spent a lot of time hating myself for the things that I did. That's why I went to Afghanistan.",
        "Casey: To run away?",
        "Riley: Try to make up for the things that I did.",
        "Casey: By building houses so far away from home? How's that supposed to help anybody back here?",
        "Riley: It didn't. But it helped me realize how much I need to be near my family -- to change, to come back, to be more deserving of their love, all right? I had to be here.",
        "Casey: And all you've done since you've been here is lie. I'm not hungry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I mean, here's Meg, and she tells all these guys point blank, \"I don't want you fighting over me.\" And what do they do?",
        "Paul: They fight over her.",
        "Bonnie: Exactly. When she says that's the quickest way to lose her. I mean, come on! It's just so dense!",
        "Paul: You know what I think? I think that you're hoping that at least one of those guys doesn't wise up.",
        "Bonnie: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Well, if Dusty keeps screwing up, then Damian will get the upper hand with Meg, and that'll leave Dusty free -- free to you.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, is that -- is that -- is that what you think I'm waiting for?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Bonnie: Let me tell you something, Paul.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Bonnie: I'm a smart, intelligent, accomplished woman. I've never waited for some woman's table scraps, nor will I ever.",
        "Paul: I never said that you weren't accomplished.",
        "Bonnie: My man will want me because he wants me, not because the woman he wants has dumped him. You got that?",
        "Paul: I got it.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah? Good.",
        "Paul: So, who do you think's going to win, Dusty or Damian?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. After the smackdown over Worldwide -- [Clears throat] I think Meg's going to cut both of them loose. But you would know that better than me.",
        "Paul: Really? I wonder why?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, come on, Paul. You've gone through more machinations than the both of them put together to get Meg back, and look where it's gotten you.",
        "Paul: Nowhere. Wouldn't make that mistake again.",
        "Bonnie: You might, if you thought you had a chance. And then Meg would have three guys making fools of themselves. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Luke doesn't think much of me.",
        "Meg: How do you know that?",
        "Damian: He's told me, often.",
        "Meg: But things are changing between you two. I mean, look what happened today. You dropped everything to go help Luke find Noah. I mean, that's got to register.",
        "Damian: Hell, I -- I would like to think that the new me will wipe out memories of the old, but it can't be that easy when I think of all the suffering I caused him.",
        "Meg: Hey. You'll find a way to make it up to him, bit by bit. Excuse me a minute. What are you doing here?! Are you spying on me?!",
        "Dusty: Spying on you? Why would I do that?",
        "Meg: Because I'm here with Damian, and you're out here lurking.",
        "Dusty: I just walked up to the door. Why are you being so defensive?",
        "Meg: I am not being defensive!",
        "Dusty: You feeling guilty about something?",
        "Meg: Of course not! I am free to be with anyone I want.",
        "Dusty: Obviously it's not me.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Okay, so if you're not spying, why are you here?",
        "Dusty: Well, I was going to apologize for making assumptions about you and Damian.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Apology accepted.",
        "Dusty: I'm taking it back.",
        "Meg: What -- why?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause now I know there's something going on.",
        "Meg: There's not a damn thing going on, Dusty!",
        "Dusty: You had your arms around him. Thought you were mad at both of us.",
        "Meg: I was. I still am!",
        "Dusty: It looks like you quickly forgave Damian for trying to steal my company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: I didn't mean to wake you. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Oh, no. I've got nothing else to do but wake up. How did lunch go with Casey?",
        "Riley: Not so well. But I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep working at it.",
        "Margo: Mm. Adam --",
        "Riley: It's so nice to hear you say my name.",
        "Margo: Thank God you're back safe. I never should have told Casey.",
        "Riley: Maybe he's right. Maybe I should have been honest with you guys from the beginning. I was so afraid you'd kick me out.",
        "Margo: No, no! I'd never do that. You were doing everything you could to make things right.",
        "Riley: Mom, when did you know it was me?",
        "Margo: Oh, I don't know, really. I guess maybe from the very beginning.",
        "Riley: You mean when I showed up at my supposed funeral?",
        "Margo: Mm. All those times you tried to leave, I wouldn't let you go. I guess a mother just knows, hmm?",
        "Riley: I was hoping you'd say that. Or maybe it's enough even if Casey blows it for me and I have to go to prison for everything I've done.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. That is not going to happen.",
        "Riley: Mom, stop. Please stop worrying.",
        "Margo: Where is Casey? Why don't you get him in here? I want to talk to him.",
        "Riley: I think he went home.",
        "Margo: Home?",
        "Riley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, no. 'Cause Tom -- Tom is headed home. No, he can't go there. He'll tell Tom. Listen, Adam, you got to go get Casey. You got to tell him. You got to tell him not to say anything to Tom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: All right.",
        "Casey: What are you doing?",
        "Tom: I'm just throwing some stuff together for your mom. Um, where's Riley?",
        "Casey: I left him at Yo's. Do you have a minute to talk now?",
        "Tom: Absolutely. What is it that you wanted to talk to me about?",
        "Casey: Riley. You know, I -- I know I've been a little weird about him.",
        "Tom: Yeah, and I don't want you to feel guilty about misjudging Riley, because I did the same thing.",
        "Casey: No. That -- that's not what I'm talking about. You know, what happened with Colonel Mayer today -- you know --",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, if you think it's your fault, it's not.",
        "Casey: My fault?",
        "Tom: Look, Mom knows that Colonel Mayer came by the house because you were working on the film with Noah. But the last thing she wants is for you to feel responsible for that, okay?",
        "Casey: No, Dad, I really think you should know this.",
        "Tom: Let me go first. I'm proud of you for the way you've handled having Riley around here.",
        "Casey: By trying to kick him out of the house, you mean?",
        "Tom: No, by putting your own feelings aside for your mom. Now, I know that we all love each other, but you've proved over the last few weeks what that actually means to you. It touches me more than you'll ever know.",
        "Casey: God, you know I love you. I love Mom, too. I just -- I can't stand the thought of someone hurting you guys.",
        "Tom: We feel the same way about you, Case. So no matter what Riley's done for your mom, there's one thing that you need to understand. No one will ever be as important to her as you are, especially with Adam gone. And I mean no one.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Don't twist this around. I am mad at you and Damian both, and I have every right to be.",
        "Dusty: He started this by trying to steal my company.",
        "Meg: What does it matter who started it?!",
        "Dusty: I'd understand if I was going after the guy for no reason. I'm trying to defend myself.",
        "Meg: How do you expect me to enjoy being caught in the middle of a feud between two grown men who should know better?",
        "Dusty: Well, if that's how you see it, it was a mistake for me to come here.",
        "Meg: Well, what other way is there to see it, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Well, if I think someone I care about needs protection, I'll voice it.",
        "Meg: Okay, for the last time, I do not need protection.",
        "Dusty: What you're saying is you don't need me. Go ahead and say it. I need to hear it once and for all.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You're doing it again, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: What's that? Asking you to make a choice?",
        "Meg: You're bullying me.",
        "Dusty: I'm asking for clarification, Meg.",
        "Meg: And leaving me no options!",
        "Dusty: How do you figure that?",
        "Meg: Because if I tell you that I want you around, you're going to take that as permission to protect me by running my life.",
        "Dusty: You know who I am. You know how I feel about you. Don't you?",
        "Meg: You're changing the subject.",
        "Dusty: No, it's the same subject. Do you want me or not?",
        "Meg: What I want is for you to stop pushing me into a position that I don't want to be in!",
        "Dusty: Me or Damian. Why don't you choose?",
        "Meg: Okay, fine! Fine! If that's the way you want it, we're over, okay -- totally, finally, completely! Is that clear?!",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Damian: Are you all right?",
        "Meg: Oh, don't start with me! I am sick and tired of guys asking me if I'm all right, if I need them, if I want them! You know what I want?! I want some peace in my life! Is that too much to ask?",
        "Damian: No, of course not.",
        "Meg: You know, Dusty Donovan is the most arrogant, pompous, chauvinistic person I know. Do you know what he did?",
        "Damian: I'm scared to ask.",
        "Meg: He came over here to apologize to me.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Damian: And that's bad?",
        "Meg: No! Then he took it back! He took the apology back and threw it in my face!",
        "Damian: You know, maybe this is for the best.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Damian: The last thing you need is some bully like Dusty trying to push you around.",
        "Meg: Oh -- okay, don't -- don't call him that.",
        "Damian: Didn't I just hear you call him that?",
        "Meg: I have a right to be angry at him. You don't! I don't want you bad- mouthing him.",
        "Damian: Forgive me, but I can't stand by and watch another man push you around, all right?",
        "Meg: That's exactly what I want you to do, Damian -- stand by! Do nothing! Let me fight my own battles! Is that so hard to understand?",
        "Damian: No, no. I understand. I won't mention Dusty's name again.",
        "Meg: I appreciate it.",
        "Damian: You've been a very good friend, Meg, and the least I can do is try and respect your boundaries.",
        "Meg: No, don't just try. Do it.",
        "Damian: As you wish. Thank you for letting me confide in you about Luke.",
        "Meg: Anytime.",
        "Damian: I'll hold you to that.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're still here.",
        "Bonnie: I had a meeting with a client.",
        "Dusty: Will you join me for a drink?",
        "Bonnie: I'm concluding that your apology didn't go so well.",
        "Dusty: I show up -- and the first thing I see is her arms around another guy.",
        "Bonnie: Damian?",
        "Dusty: That's right. What would you think if you saw that?",
        "Bonnie: Well, that depends. Were they, uh, dressed or naked?",
        "Dusty: Clothes were on, in Emma's kitchen.",
        "Bonnie: Emma's kitchen. Huh. That's not really the place I would choose to release my unbridled passion.",
        "Dusty: You don't think?",
        "Bonnie: Hmm-mm. You jumped to conclusions, didn't you?",
        "Dusty: No, I asked her questions.",
        "Bonnie: Well, what did she say?",
        "Dusty: Told me it was over, totally, for good.",
        "Bonnie: Wow. That's no wiggle room, huh? So things are serious between Meg and Damian?",
        "Dusty: Who cares?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. I can see how much you don't care.",
        "Dusty: The fact that she'd go within 20 feet of a loser like Damian Grimaldi is enough to keep me away.",
        "Damian: Good. Good. Because everyone would be a lot better off if you keep your word and leave Meg alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I am sorry. We do keep getting interrupted, don't we?",
        "Casey: That's okay. Was that the office calling?",
        "Tom: Uh, yeah. You know, I had to drop everything when I heard about your mom, so it's kind of catching up to me now.",
        "Casey: I was kind of hoping that I could ride with you.",
        "Tom: Ah. Well, I was hoping that maybe you'd take this stuff down to your mom, because I'm going to be tied up for several hours, and I know she's probably going to want her stuff.",
        "Casey: Yeah, sure. I'll do that.",
        "Tom: Okay. See you at the hospital?",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Tom: Hey, um, was there something else you wanted to talk to me about?",
        "Casey: No, no. Go take care of your work.",
        "Tom: All right. So we're cool, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Yeah, we're cool.",
        "Tom: All right.",

        "Meg: Where's Eliza?",
        "Paul: I didn't kidnap her. She's with my mom. And I know I should have asked, but, uh, I figured you wouldn't have a problem with them spending a little time together. My mom hasn't been around Eliza since she started treatment again.",
        "Meg: That's fine. That's fine. I don't have a problem. Is Barbara feeling better?",
        "Paul: Yeah, much.",
        "Meg: Well, good. I'm glad she's able to see her. I'm sorry I jumped down your throat.",
        "Paul: No big deal. You're a little edgy.",
        "Meg: It's nothing.",
        "Paul: We were really close, right? For a long time? I think I know when something's up.",
        "Meg: I just had it out with Dusty.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: We officially broke up.",
        "Paul: Again?",
        "Meg: Permanently.",
        "Paul: This wouldn't have anything to do with Damian, would it?",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: Why would you even think that? Why does it always have to be a contest between Dusty and Damian, as if I'm incapable of making my own decisions?",
        "Paul: Stop, stop. Please stop it. I heard you complaining about the two of them --",
        "Meg: Well, yeah! Uh, well, of course there's a part of it there. But I'm just sick and tired of this whole cycle of one-upmanship.",
        "Paul: Boys will be boys.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: I was hoping Damian would rise above it. But Dusty -- he's just waiting for the opportunity to get back at Damian.",
        "Paul: And you just want the whole thing over?",
        "Meg: Immediately, if not sooner.",
        "Paul: You know, I think I have a way for you to brighten up your day and brighten someone else's up in the process.",
        "Meg: Okay. I'm up for it.",
        "Paul: I got this stuff for Eliza, but now I'm thinking that, you know, maybe it would be really nice my mom -- for her to keep it at her place for when Eliza comes to visit. It's just --",
        "Meg: That's a great idea.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, then, you wouldn't mind dropping it off when you -- when you go to pick up Eliza?",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Wait. Where are you going?",
        "Paul: I have some errands to run.",
        "Meg: Mm.",
        "Paul: Okay, um, if you want the honest truth --",
        "Meg: Yeah. I would prefer that.",
        "Paul: My mom would love to see you.",
        "Meg: I would like to see her, too. I would be glad to play delivery girl.",
        "Paul: And try not to worry about this whole Dusty/Damian thing. I'm sure it'll work itself out really soon.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: We cannot just sit and wait and hope for the best, Adam. Casey is going to tell Tom.",
        "Riley: Maybe.",
        "Margo: No. We just can't -- we can't let that happen.",
        "Riley: Who knows how Tom will react? Maybe he'll be so happy that I'm alive that he'll want to keep quiet about it, too.",
        "Margo: Adam, after what you did to Gwen, he could hardly keep quiet. It was attempted rape. And now you're impersonating a soldier.",
        "Riley: Nobody's pressing charges. I mean, I didn't claim to be Riley Morgan to anybody but you guys.",
        "Margo: Adam, half the town knows you as Riley.",
        "Riley: So now you're going to turn me in?",
        "Margo: No. Of course not. 'Cause I'm your mother. And I thought that I had lost you for good. So God forgive me, no, I'm not. I'll do everything I can to keep you with me.",
        "Riley: No matter what?",
        "Margo: I've already sent one son to prison. I don't think I could do that again.",
        "Riley: But Dad would.",
        "Margo: Well, if he knows that you're Adam, even though he loves you --",
        "Riley: He'll turn me in.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: All right. Maybe you should go.",
        "Riley: I'm not leaving you, Mom.",
        "Margo: What? I'm fine.",
        "Riley: You've been shot. I'm not leaving you alone.",
        "Margo: Please, please. I am fine.",
        "Riley: No, I'm sick of running. Whatever happens happens.",
        "Casey: Hey. I brought your things.",
        "Margo: Um, would you, uh -- did you see your dad? Did you tell him?",
        "Casey: Not yet.",
        "Margo: Are you going to?",
        "Casey: I don't know.",
        "Margo: Casey, what can I say to convince you? I mean, you cannot betray your brother like this.",
        "Riley: Mom, don't put that on him.",
        "Margo: Could I please talk to Casey alone?",
        "Riley: So you can push him into doing something he doesn't want to do?",
        "Margo: I -- you know what? I don't have very much energy. You're going to make me waste it by arguing with you?",
        "Riley: Okay, I'll go.",
        "Casey: How far are you going?",
        "Riley: I'm not leaving town if that's what you mean. If anybody needs me, I'll be at the house.",
        "Casey: Yeah, right. Okay.",
        "Riley: I mean it, Casey. If you want to blow this whole thing open, I'll be ready to face the consequences.",
        "Casey: Wow. Suddenly turned into an upstanding gentleman.",
        "Riley: You know what? Believe what you want and do what you want. I'll see you later.",
        "Casey: W -- why is he so important to you?",
        "Margo: Because he's my son. Just like you.",
        "Casey: Mom, all my life, when we were growing up, he was a good guy. But then, all of the sudden, it changed, you know? He started hurting people. And instead of taking responsibility, you know, he made up excuses and ran.",
        "Margo: So did you. You made up excuses, and you ran, and we forgave you. Why can't you forgive him?",
        "Casey: But you punished me for them. You -- you arrested me. You put me in jail. You're not going to do any of that to -- to Riley/Adam?",
        "Margo: I'm just not strong enough to go through that again.",
        "Casey: Well, at least are you going to tell Dad?",
        "Margo: Your father will do the right thing. And I can't let him do that. Please, Casey. I have both of my boys with me for the first time in a long time, and I don't know that I'm ready to lose either one of you.",
        "Casey: Will you ever be ready?",
        "Margo: I know we can't keep this lie going forever, but please, will you please let me be a mother to both of my sons?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Excuse me. Hi. I didn't mean to bother you. I'm in a little bit of a hurry. I work for Dusty Donovan, and I need to make a -- a delivery for Mr. Grimaldi -- Damian Grimaldi.",
        "Harbor master: I haven't seen Mr. Grimaldi today.",
        "Paul: Well, he doesn't need to sign for it personally or anything. I -- I can just leave it on one of his ships. Which ones are his? Thanks.",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'll talk to Meg whenever I want.",
        "Damian: No matter how much she wants you to stay away?",
        "Dusty: Why are you telling me what to do?",
        "Damian: That's why she told you it was over. She could no longer tolerate you badgering her!",
        "Bonnie: Could you guys just stop it, please? You sound like broken records. Now, if you both like Meg so much, why don't you just do what she says and back the hell off?",
        "Dusty: I've already walked away.",
        "Damian: Fantastic. You've walked away? Now stay away.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Damian: Grimaldi. Is there a problem?",
        "Harbor master: One of your ships is leaking fuel.",

        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: You finished your visit already? I was just on my way out.",
        "Meg: Uh, yeah. The three of us had a great time. Thank you so much for suggesting that. You know, your mother even -- showed me some of your baby photos.",
        "Paul: Are you --",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Paul: I'm going to kill her. That's --",
        "Meg: It's amazing how much Eliza looks like you.",
        "Paul: Well after everything that I've done to you, for you to include Eliza in my mother's life -- that means a lot. Thank you. That's very generous of you.",
        "Meg: Well, you and Barbara are Eliza's family. You both love her. I don't want to deprive her of that experience.",
        "Paul: So are you two headed back to the farm?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Back to peace and quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: How dare you? Do you know how much damage you've done?",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Damian: If you think one cut line is going to destroy me, you couldn't be more wrong. When I came after your business, it was legal. Everything was aboveboard and out in the open.",
        "Dusty: Tried a hostile takeover.",
        "Damian: But the way you came after me -- that's illegal. That's criminal. And you didn't hurt just me, Dusty. You hurt this place, your home, the people you call your friends and neighbors.",
        "Dusty: I didn't do anything.",
        "Meg: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Damian: He cut a fuel line on one of my ships.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Damian: Causing an oil spill, which, of course, is going to cost me a fortune to clean up.",
        "Dusty: I didn't go near your ships.",
        "Meg: Okay, when did this happen?",
        "Damian: About an hour ago.",
        "Bonnie: No, Dusty couldn't have done it. He was with me.",
        "Damian: Is there no limit to how low you will sink? Now you use your new girlfriend to provide you with an alibi?",
        "Bonnie: Hey, I'm not his girlfriend or some fake alibi. You are way out of line, Damian.",
        "Damian: Just because Dusty wasn't there doesn't mean he didn't do it.",
        "Bonnie: Prove it.",
        "Damian: There's a witness. The harbor master said there's a man that came to the docks and identified himself as working for Dusty Donovan. He claimed he had a delivery for me.",
        "Dusty: Meg, would I do that?",
        "Meg: It doesn't sound like you. But if Damian --",
        "Damian: You have to see that this is a declaration of war.",
        "Dusty: I didn't do it.",
        "Meg: I don't know what to think.",
        "Paul: Do you really even need to be involved in any of this?",
        "Meg: You know, you're right. I don't. Let's take Eliza home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Are the cops right behind you? Should I write Mom and Dad a quick good- bye note while I have the chance?",
        "Casey: No, I wouldn't. I'm going to keep my mouth shut about who you are, because Mom wants me to.",
        "Riley: Thanks, Casey.",
        "Casey: No. Do not thank me. That makes me feel even more disgusting. Just tell me, how do you do it, huh?",
        "Riley: Do what?",
        "Casey: Get Mom wrapped around your finger. I mean, she's tough. She's strong. She sees my scams from a mile away. But with you, she caves. How do you do it, Adam?",
        "Riley: She believes me because I tell her the truth.",
        "Casey: You call yourself Riley Morgan. That's a lie. This face you have -- that's not yours. That's a lie. You sleep in our own parents' house, and you call our own father \"Tom.\" How is that telling the truth?",
        "Riley: I want to make up for what I did. I want to start over. I want another chance. And when you act like you can't relate to that, like you've never felt that way, you're the liar, Casey. You know what? So if you want to go ahead and turn me in, go ahead.",
        "Casey: I can't, because Mom -- she's too fragile right now for me to push her, so I won't. But, you know those good-bye notes you keep talking about? Keep writing them and hold onto them, because you're going to need them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Is Casey gone?",
        "Tom: Um, I had a talk with him.",
        "Margo: When? Just now?",
        "Tom: Earlier at the house. I think things are going to be okay.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. I had a talk with him, too. I agree with you.",
        "Tom: Well, good. Now all we have to do is concentrate on getting you better.",
        "Margo: Yeah. There's nothing I want more. Don't worry. I just want to be home with my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, Eliza went right to sleep.",
        "Paul: I guess she and my mom kind of tuckered each other out.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I think we need to bring her over there more often. You know what I mean.",
        "Paul: No, that would be great if we could do anything more often. I really like where we are, you know -- the two of us parenting together.",
        "Meg: Took us long enough.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You know, seeing Damian and Dusty go after each other like that, I know I used to behave like that, and I can see why you might have a problem with it.",
        "Meg: It's pretty frightening.",
        "Paul: Yeah. The competitive part of me is toxic.",
        "Meg: Well, I like the way you handled things today, the way you asked me what I wanted to do instead of riding to my rescue. That's exactly what I needed.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Well, it's like you said. It took me long enough. But I am learning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I've already spoken to a company that deals with environmental contamination. They'll start as soon as they can get here. Let me ask you something. Are you sure the man you saw said he worked for Dusty Donovan?",
        "Harbor master: I'm positive.",
        "Damian: Then he'll pay for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I should have hit Damian early on. Now he's coming after me.",
        "Bonnie: That guy's a piece of work. I had no idea.",
        "Dusty: Accusing me of causing an oil spill? What's he going to come up with next?",
        "Bonnie: Well, especially since he's willing to sabotage himself just so he can blame you. You're going to have to find a way to protect yourself, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: More than that. He's right about one thing. This is war.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Hunter: But after her stroke, she said the man she always said was my father wasn't my father at all.",
        "Emily: Did she ever tell you who your actual father was?",
        "Lily: Did the security guard give you any idea who made off with the laptop?",
        "Dusty: He did, and he gave his name with that charming Italian accent.",
        "[Italian accent]",
        "Paul: Grimaldi. Damian Grimaldi.",
        "Damian: Stop this war right now, or we're going to fight until only one of us is left standing."
