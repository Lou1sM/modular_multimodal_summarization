        "Walker again confronted Rick, asking how he could survive his attack when no one else could. When Rick asked if his fingerprints were found on the syringe used in his attack, Walker wondered how Rick knew the syringe had been found, since no syringe was found in any of the other attacks. When Rick became agitated by the questions, Hal ordered Walker out of Rick's room. He told Walker he was in charge of the investigation, and Walker needed to back off. When Walker refused, Hal said he could make his request official. Alison wanted to come back to work, but Chris said no way. Ali said she wanted to be there because she wanted to protect Chris and his reputation. John told Ali he needed Susan's permission to let Ali come back. Gordo overheard Ali accuse him of the murders. After John refused to reinstate him, Gordo confronted Ali about her accusations. Henry told Dusty he could use his electronics expertise to help find Lily and Rose, for a price. With Lucy's encouragement, Aaron insisted on helping with the search. At a press conference, Holden offered $10 million for the safe return of the women. Rose's attempts to climb from the well continued to fail. Lily dreamed of Holden, while Rose dreamed of Dusty. James called the police station, saying he would give information in return for being put on live television."

        "Rick: Now, does that feel like a kiss from someone who needs complete bed rest?",
        "Susan: That's a trick question, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Well?",
        "Susan: I know you're on the mend and all that, but it's not like you're in here for a checkup. You went into complete cardiac arrest. Someone tried to inject you with the same drug that killed all those other people. I don't know what would have happened if we hadn't found you when we did. So a couple more days bed rest isn't a lot to ask.",
        "Rick: Keep an eye on my monitor. My blood pressure might shoot up. Can I help you, Dr. Daniels?",
        "Walker: I have a few questions.",
        "Susan: Oh, that is ridiculous! He already told you everything he knows.",
        "Rick: Look, if you're hoping for a description of who tried to kill me, I've already told you, I didn't see anything. What else can I tell you?",
        "Walker: You can tell me how, out of all of the killer's victims, you are the only one who has managed to survive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Wow. What happened to this place?",
        "John: Our local law enforcement investigators is happened to this place.",
        "Alison: They were looking for clues?",
        "John: They were looking for Nurse Krebs' journal.",
        "Alison: I never really liked her when I had to take orders from her. But now that she's dead, it's -- so, um, do you think they'll find something in her journal that could break the case?",
        "John: Dr. Decker had a page of her journal in his hands when he was attacked. By the way, I thought you had decided to take a couple of days off, Ms. Stewart?",
        "Alison: No, that's -- that's just it. I didn't decide. Hal decided for me, but I hated it, so I wanted to ask you something. Would it be okay if I came back to work?",
        "John: Well, I could certainly use you. Our personnel problems are getting worse by the day. It seems that every good secretary and every key member of the staff has come down with a convenient case of the flu here.",
        "Alison: Everybody's just really scared about what's going on. But I'm not scared.",
        "John: To what do you attribute your bravery?",
        "Alison: Well, you know, my mom's here, and Rick's here. Chris is here.",
        "John: Dr. Hughes?",
        "Alison: Yeah. He's a friend -- a really good friend. But anyway, since everyone I care about is here, well, I want to be here, too.",
        "Chris: That's a bad idea, Alison. If you won't go home on your own, you'll go home over my shoulder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're late.",
        "Henry: Genius is not a slave to the clock. I'm not only good, Mr. Donovan, I'm one of the best there is.",
        "Dusty: You've got a way to find Lily and Rose or what?",
        "Henry: The answer to that one is gonna cost you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Here, come on. Come on, careful, careful. Come on, lie down. I -- I know it's not much, but it's all we've got.",
        "Lily: Rose, don't.",
        "Rose: Don't argue with me. It eats up your strength. Save your energy. Try to get as comfortable as you can in this disgusting rabbit hole.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Rose: That's the girl. Now, since we've got a little daylight, they're not blasting right now, I'm gonna try to get out of here again.",
        "Lily: No, don't -- don't, Rose. Please?",
        "Rose: What did I tell you? What did I tell you about arguing with me? They're not blasting right now, so I've got to try to climb out of here one more time.",
        "Lily: Be careful.",
        "Rose: Ah! Mary and Joseph in heaven!",
        "Lily: I knew it. I knew this was a mistake. What happened?",
        "Rose: It's my leg. It just cramped up. Oh, ah -- I can't -- ah! I can't -- it just locked up! I can't believe it!",
        "Lily: Well, you haven't had any water in a couple of days. Try to straighten it out.",
        "Rose: Ah! No, this cannot be happening. I've got to get out of here today, or else we'll -- what is the matter with you people?! Why can't you find us?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Useless, useless. All just stinking useless! Do you have any idea how many tunnels and caves there are in Oakdale according to these maps? Hundreds.",
        "Lucinda: We've got to narrow things down, that's all. Now, now, this Brackett person, is there anything there, I mean, now that we know who he's working for?",
        "Holden: The guy's a dead end. He's not gonna talk.",
        "Lucinda: There's got to be someone -- there's got to be someone who knows something about this very elaborate kidnapping plan.",
        "Holden: Maybe, but what makes you think that these guys are gonna be any more talkative than Brackett?",
        "Lucinda: Well -- well, we'll -- we'll give them some encouragement. We've got one resource that has not been tapped, and it has never failed me.",
        "Holden: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Lucinda: Money! Lots and lots of money!",
        "Lucinda: We will offer the reward, all those big bucks, to anyone who has any information that leads to the rescue of these two girls.",
        "Holden: You already brought this up to Margo once before.",
        "Lucinda: Well, Margo's just worried about crank calls, and she's worried about her precious resources. But darling, time isn't on our side. We can't tiptoe around her anymore. If she doesn't understand us, then we've got to do it by ourselves.",
        "Holden: All right. Fine, let's do it.",
        "Lucinda: All right.",
        "Aaron: Holden.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Ms. Walsh. I didn't expect you guys here. I thought you'd be out looking for Lily.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, that's what we're doing. We're actually headed to the police station right now.",
        "Aaron: Okay, we'll go with you.",
        "Holden: No, you guys stay here. Just do whatever it is you were planning on doing today, okay?",
        "Lucinda: All right. Sweetheart, when this settles down, can we get together? All right, all right.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Lucy: You know what? Why don't we -- why don't we forget swimming for today. If you want to help Holden, I think --",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, no, no. Luce, we made plans to go to the club, and that's what we're gonna do. I'll get my stuff, and we're just gonna go, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: So, what's your cut on this job?",
        "Dusty: This is not a job to me, Henry.",
        "Henry: Uh-huh. Do I look like I was born yesterday? You may have the rest of this town thinking that you're doing all this hard work for love, but you know what? I know better.",
        "Dusty: You're a two-bit hustler with a baby face. And I'm dealing with you, \"a,\" because I like you, and \"b,\" because I hear you're a hell of an electronics -- what do they call you -- geek.",
        "Henry: Well, well, come on now. I -- I wouldn't say geek.",
        "Dusty: Now, look, if you have something in that box that's going to help me find Lily and Rose, I want you to put it on the table right now. And I'm gonna make sure that Holden Snyder gives you a big chunk of change. But if you're wasting my time, I'm gonna hurt you.",
        "Henry: I respond so much better to nonviolent negotiations. I went down to the wholesale village, and I bought a bunch of this same make of walkie-talkie, and then I just tweaked with the frequencies a bit. I'd say they get about five times the range they did when I bought them. Now, that's not gonna help you much in the city, but if our ladies are wandering around in the boonies somewhere, which we're pretty sure they are, then you have to admit that this could be a great help.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Henry: Good.",
        "Dusty: Good. Look, I'm gonna give you a lot of cash right now.",
        "Henry: Excellent.",
        "Dusty: This is for lunch, and this is for the hardware. I want you to leave this equipment with the waiter.",
        "Henry: The what, the waiter? The -- do you have any idea how much this stuff is worth?",
        "Dusty: Don't sweat it, baby. I've got a meeting right now. I'm meeting a lady. But the thing is, I've got to see her before she sees me.",
        "Henry: Um, if it's who I think it is, you're too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What kind of medical investigator blames the victim for being attacked?",
        "Walker: I simply asked a question. After all, that is why I'm here, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Do you think that I injected myself, stopped my own heart?",
        "Walker: Well, that's a very interesting theory, doctor.",
        "Rick: Why don't you check the syringe for your answer? Were there any fingerprints on it?",
        "Walker: What makes you think we found a syringe?",
        "Rick: I don't know, I just assumed.",
        "Walker: Why? One's never been left behind before.",
        "Rick: I wouldn't know that, would I?",
        "Walker: So then why would you assume the killer left one behind this time?",
        "Rick: Wait a minute. No, don't try and trip me up, all right? I'm not your killer. The only reason I became a target was because I was anxious for this witch hunt to be over.",
        "Walker: Oh, and how did that come about again? I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: I already told you! I went into Bob's office to look for Arlene's journal, which I happened to find. You would have found it first if you weren't so busy running around accusing innocent people! And now it's lost, and it's not my fault!",
        "Susan: Rick, you have to settle down. Was there anything in those pages that Rick managed to hang onto? Any clue about the killer?",
        "Walker: I'm not at liberty to say. That's up to the police.",
        "Hal: Well, I'm glad to see you're leaving some of the investigating to law enforcement.",
        "Susan: That's it. I'm calling an end to this interrogation. Rick isn't up to any more questions.",
        "Hal: Fine. I'm not here to question Rick. I came by to check on his condition and wish him well. I think that under the circumstances, it might be better if you left.",
        "Walker: Are you kicking me out, Hal?",
        "Hal: Now, doctor. If I need any more information from you, I'll find you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You'll carry me out over your shoulder? Please! You can't tell me where and when I can work.",
        "Chris: Hal told you to go home for a reason.",
        "John: Do you think you can take this conversation someplace else?",
        "Chris: I'm sorry, Dr. Dixon. It was actually you I came to talk to before I was --",
        "John: Distracted, yes. What is it? I'm a busy man.",
        "Chris: It's about my dad. His condition hasn't improved, and my mom's getting discouraged. I mean, I tried to help, but -- well, I was hoping if you could find the time, maybe you could talk to her.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I can do that.",
        "Chris: Thank you. She should still be in his room.",
        "John: I was going to look in on your father this afternoon anyway. Would you take care of these for me, please?",
        "Alison: Sure. Hey, Chris, what are you doing?! John said that I could work here!",
        "Chris: So you went behind Hal's back after he told you to stay away?",
        "Alison: Hal's not my father! He can't tell me what to do, and neither can you! Chris, I can make my own decisions.",
        "Chris: Alison, it may not be safe for you here.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, maybe it's the only job I've got, and maybe if I keep working, I can earn enough money to make a living.",
        "Chris: Look --",
        "Alison: Isn't that what you encouraged me to do in the first place?",
        "Chris: Yes, but why are you so fixated on this job? I mean, why here, why now?",
        "Alison: Because you need me.",
        "Chris: Alison, I don't know how Emily and Susan even begin to deal with you. You're the most stubborn, obstinate, confusing woman I have ever --",
        "Alison: See?! See, I knew it! Chris, you do think of me as a woman!",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, can we just tackle one subject at a time, please? Why do you think I need you?",
        "Alison: Well, even though everybody should know Gordo's the killer, you're still a suspect, right?",
        "Chris: We don't know that for sure.",
        "Alison: Chris, you don't have to pretend with me. You're going through one of the toughest times in your life.",
        "Chris: And you know this because?",
        "Alison: Didn't you just ask John to talk to your mom for you because your dad isn't getting better? You said that you didn't know if he'd make it. And -- and then a guy you think is your friend is running around killing people, but nobody can prove it. And to top that off, people are looking in the wrong direction and accusing you. You may not think that that means you need a friend, but I do.",
        "Chris: Alison, you can be my friend, okay? But you can do it from the safety of your own living room.",
        "Alison: No! No, no, no, no! Not when I can be here protecting you!",
        "Chris: Protecting me how?",
        "Alison: By telling everybody with ears that you're innocent.",
        "Chris: Alison, I don't need your shield or your trumpet, and I definitely don't need you adding yourself to my long list of worries.",
        "Alison: Why do you have to worry about me? It's not like you're my boyfriend or anything. Are you? I didn't think so, so that makes it simple.",
        "Chris: Makes what simple?",
        "Alison: Well, since you're not my boyfriend and you don't care about me --",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, I didn't --",
        "Alison: You can choose to block me completely out of your mind -- or at least, you can try. And as for my safety, Gordo's on suspension, right?",
        "Chris: Yeah, so?",
        "Alison: So I won't be in danger, because he'll be out there and I'll be in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Dr. Gordon, what are you doing here?",
        "Gordo: There's only so many times I can review \"Gray's Anatomy\" or rearrange my sock drawer. I'm going stir crazy at home. Look, I know that everybody here thinks I'm the one behind those murders, but I'm not.",
        "John: You know, if I was convinced you were a murderer, I would have revoked your salary when I suspended you.",
        "Gordo: Dr. Dixon, medicine's my life. I've never wanted to be anything but a doctor, and now -- look, what I want, what I need more than anything is to come back to work.",
        "John: You know, I get the same song and dance from Alison Stewart. Half the staff around here is too frightened to work, the other half can't stay away. Now, I don't have the time to contemplate this, okay? You just go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Relax, I just want to talk to you for a few minutes.",
        "Barbara: I'm meeting someone.",
        "Dusty: I don't see John just yet, do you?",
        "Barbara: How did you know? I should have known.",
        "Dusty: Should have known what? You wouldn't have taken a meeting with me, would you?",
        "Barbara: No. And why? Because I have absolutely nothing to say to you.",
        "Dusty: Look, I am trying to find Lily and Rose. Right now, we've got one walkie-talkie as a link. The clues we got from Steinbeck are making us think that Lily and Rose are hidden underground someplace.",
        "Barbara: Well, it sounds like you have quite a lot.",
        "Dusty: We're trying to narrow down the area where we're looking.",
        "Barbara: How many times do I have to tell you, I have no idea where James would have put those women.",
        "Dusty: But you know how he thinks, right? I mean, don't you think that this is James' message to the world about his love for his son? Wherever these guys are hidden, there's got to be some connection to Paul.",
        "Barbara: Or it could just be some sick game that he's playing. Watching people trying to outguess him is James' idea of fun.",
        "Dusty: Let me ask you, where was Paul conceived?",
        "Barbara: You really have no boundaries, do you?",
        "Dusty: You understand what I'm getting at, right? Where did he take his first steps? Where did he play on swings? You've got to remember something. What is it?",
        "Barbara: You just echoed something that James said at the prison. \"Remember Paul at birth, 2, 5, 7.\"",
        "Dusty: Can you make a connection to a place?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. I really don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You ready to roll?",
        "Lucy: Not until we talk. Look, when Holden told you he didn't want you helping him in his search for Lily, you looked like he'd punched you. Why didn't you say something to him about it?",
        "Aaron: Because I get what he's going through. I mean, his wife is missing.",
        "Lucy: I get it, too. I mean, Lily's my aunt. I can't imagine how horrible Holden must feel. He must be terrified.",
        "Aaron: Right. So why should he have to deal with what I need on top of it all?",
        "Lucy: But if you care about him --",
        "Aaron: If I care about him? Luce, I've been waiting my whole life to be a part of this family.",
        "Lucy: So really be a part of it.",
        "Aaron: How? The family is gone, Luce. Look, Lily and Rose are missing, the kids were shipped off to Iva's. If Holden doesn't want me helping him because I might be too much for him to handle, then I'm gonna help him by staying out of his way.",
        "Lucy: So why didn't you do that with me?",
        "Aaron: Do what?",
        "Lucy: Take off, get lost, stay out of my way? I mean, after my accident, I -- I shut you out, Aaron, and you could have just left me alone, but you didn't. Instead, you were writing me letters, and you were constantly visiting me. I practically couldn't get rid of you.",
        "Aaron: Lucy, I can't stay away from you, okay? You know that. Okay, no matter how much I tried. I love you.",
        "Lucy: Don't you love Holden?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Lucy: It's tearing you apart that your family's gone, but so is his.",
        "Aaron: Yes, Lucy, I know this, okay, but he said no to my help. How am I supposed to get through to him?",
        "Lucy: You know, when I got to know you the best was when I was at my worst. Get in his face. Let him see what I see.",
        "Aaron: Which is what?",
        "Lucy: How strong you are, how dependable, and how you'd move the world for the people you love.",
        "Aaron: You mind if we change our location of our date?",
        "Lucy: Like to the Police station? I'd love that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Are you two out of your minds?! $10 million? I'm gonna be chasing false leads from all over the country.",
        "Holden: As opposed to having no leads at all?",
        "Margo: Look, my resources will be scattered. We might miss something important.",
        "Lucinda: We understand your position perfectly, Margo. It's just that we don't happen to agree with it. We can either have the Press conference here in the Police station or elsewhere, where you have no control over the content.",
        "Margo: Oh, there's no talking you two out of it, is there?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, not this time, no. How about half an hour?",
        "Margo: I do not want a mob scene. I want one reporter and one cameraman from WOAK.",
        "Lucinda: We may have to go national.",
        "Holden: We will. Once we give WOAK the exclusive, they'll turn it over to all the other networks.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll make the phone calls.",
        "Margo: You realize this is a huge risk.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, you know, desperate times, they call for desperate measures, Margo. And frankly, I'm pretty desperate.",
        "Margo: Well, frankly, so are a whole lot of other people who are going to be calling in.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: All we need is just one person -- one person who may have seen or heard something about where Lily and Rose might be. Margo, if this money brings these people out of the woodwork, then -- just one person. Just one.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So then there's only one real suspect left -- Gordo. He's the one who's killing people. Who else could it be?",

        "Rose: Stop it! Stop it! You can't do this to us!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Focus is the word of the day. I want you to ask very specific questions of my son-in-law, like last known whereabouts, dress idiosyncrasies. We want information, got it?",

        "Lucy: Hey, Margo.",
        "Margo: Lucy?",
        "Aaron: You guys doing a Press conference?",
        "Holden: Yeah, Lucinda has decided to offer a reward. Listen, whatever you guys need can wait, because you know, we're kind of busy here, and we're gonna get started with this thing soon.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, okay, they're getting the feed. It'll be a minute or two.",
        "Holden: All right. Listen, I thought you guys were supposed to be swimming.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah, when you need help looking for Lily and Rose? Look, I'm not taking no for an answer this time, Holden. I have to do something.",
        "Holden: Aaron, I appreciate that, but we already have a lot of people who are working on this.",
        "Aaron: Look, I'm not -- I'm not asking if I can help.",
        "Holden: Good. Well, then you and Lucy just go and --",
        "Aaron: I'm telling you that I'm gonna help, Holden. Look, I lost family in this, too, man. I love Lily and Rose, and I love you. So where would I do you the most good, out here or with the search parties?",
        "Holden: Out here. Why don't you guys go over and man the phones, okay? Thanks.",
        "Lucinda: All set. You ready?",
        "Reporter: I'll cue you when the anchor from the studio throws video to the conference.",

        "Holden: I'm close. So very close.",
        "Lily: Where? Where? Why can't I see you? This is my dream. I should be able to touch you and hold you and hold my babies. I want to go home, Holden.",
        "Holden: You have to believe me, I'm right here with you, even though you can't see me. And even when it feels like we're never gonna be together again, I'm here, always.",
        "Lily: Always.",
        "Holden: Lily, you have to tell me where you are. You have to help me find you. I need your help. Rose needs your help.",
        "Lily: Rose?",
        "Holden: You have to help me, Lily. Lily, you have to help me. Please.",
        "Rose: Lily, help me, please? Lily? Don't get up, don't get up. You're gonna hurt your shoulder.",
        "Lily: Forget about my shoulder.",
        "Rose: Are you sure? Are you sure, Lily?",
        "Lily: Nothing hurts more than the idea of never seeing Holden or my children again. So I'm gonna do anything I can to make that happen. I want you to lean on me, Rose.",

        "Barbara: How can I know? How can I ever know what James really means?",
        "Dusty: Paul at birth, 5 or 7 years old. Try to make a connection to a place -- to a place, some underground place.",
        "Barbara: Why should I help you?",
        "Dusty: What? This isn't for me. It's for two innocent women. When are you gonna wake up and see that?",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. You're attempting to do your penance. You betrayed Paul, and now he's gone. You feel guilty for your part in this. Well, you know what? This is the wrong place. This isn't a church. I'm not your priest, and I will not ease your pain or soothe your conscience.",
        "Dusty: I betrayed Paul, and you -- you hired me, didn't you?!",
        "Barbara: Yes, I did, and I will choke on my guilt until I breathe my last breath. But you -- you turned the plan upside-down. You are the reason that I have lost my son forever. You turned your back on me when I needed help, and you know what? Now it's your turn. How does it feel?",
        "Dusty: You're gonna turn your back on Lily?",
        "Barbara: I will help Lily if I can, but I know what you want here, Dusty -- credit for saving them, enough glory to make this whole stinking town forget what you've done. And I'm here to make sure that neither happens. As for Rose, I hope she comes back, for one reason. I hope she breaks your heart as completely as she broke my son's.",

        "Hal: Doctor.",
        "Walker: I'd like to talk to you about that little game you pulled earlier in Rick Decker's room.",
        "Hal: It wasn't a game.",
        "Walker: Really? You see, I've been telling myself that you pulling rank on me like that was some poor version of good cop/bad cop. I do not like having my wrists slapped, lieutenant, especially in the middle of an investigation.",
        "Hal: You are on this investigation solely at my discretion.",
        "Walker: And I earned my position in it.",
        "Hal: And I have thanked you for identifying the poison that killed all those victims, so --",
        "Walker: But that wasn't good enough. You still want me to back off.",
        "Hal: I'll be blunt, doctor. You bully people. I don't like it.",
        "Walker: I ask questions, lieutenant. How people deal with those questions, it's not my problem.",
        "Hal: It is, if you want answers. See, if you push people around, they tend to be uncooperative.",
        "Walker: Like Dr. Decker?",
        "Hal: Yes, like Dr. Decker.",
        "Walker: I seriously doubt Dr. Decker's unwillingness to cooperate is simply because I tick him off.",
        "Hal: Dr. Decker could have information that would help us catch a killer. You keep pestering him --",
        "Walker: What makes you so sure that he's not the killer?!",
        "Hal: When a guy's in ICU, I tend to give him the benefit of the doubt. Why couldn't he have been victimized just like all the others?",
        "Walker: Given the lower dosage he received?",
        "Hal: Right. And the killer got spooked and ran.",
        "Walker: And he just left the syringe right there, huh? No, Decker is too defensive. He's way too defensive.",
        "Hal: Yeah, and your dander would be up if I pestered you like that, too. Why don't you just back off?",
        "Walker: I will take that suggestion under advisement.",
        "Hal: It was more than a suggestion.",
        "Walker: Get this, Hal. I do not work for the Oakdale PD. I work for this hospital. So until Dr. Dixon tells me to take a backseat, I will talk to whomever I want, whenever I like it.",
        "Hal: Well, you get this -- John Dixon is the chief of this hospital, but I run this investigation. Now, I just told you nicely to back off. But if you want me to make that official, I can do that, too.",

        "John: What is the point here?",
        "Alison: Well, he's a great guy and a wonderful doctor, and he shouldn't be on suspension.",
        "John: You know the investigation is what dictated his suspension.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, he didn't do it. Somebody else did.",
        "John: Alison, if you are making allegations against Dr. Decker --",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no. I mean, there was a moment when I thought Dr. Decker could have killed those people, but now he's been attacked, too, so he couldn't have done it. So then there's only one real suspect left -- Gordo. He's the one who's killing people. Who else could it be?",

        "Henry: Look, look, look. Our little job just became 10 million times more profitable.",
        "Holden: Yes, you heard right. The reward is $10 million. But that's only if the information regarding the whereabouts of my wife, Lily Snyder, and her sister, Rose, is reliable and results in their returning safely.",
        "Margo: I would also like to add that we believe the women are being held in an underground area -- a cave, a cellar, a mine shaft, something like that.",
        "Henry: Don't you want to hear the rest? Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to the Police station. When those calls start coming in, I want to be there.",
        "Margo: The calls are starting to come in. [Phone rings] Holden?",
        "Holden: We have reached a critical hour. The police have done everything that they can. We're out of options, and we are out of leads. So we are appealing to you, the public. If anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts of my wife, Lily and her sister, Rose, please come forward. Thank you.",
        "Reporter: And we're out.",

        "James: Where else would I be?",
        "Margo: What do you have to say, James?",
        "James: I have information that will lead you directly to Lily Snyder and Rose D'Angelo.",
        "Lucinda: James, that's enough! Enough, James! I want you to give me my daughter, you son of a -- !",
        "Holden: I want to keep him on the line.",
        "James: Ah, is that the most contentious of my ex-wives? Is that Lucinda I hear?",
        "Lucinda: You'd better believe it, darling! I want you to tell us where you have -- what you've done with Lily and Rose!",
        "James: I will, my sweet, soon. But you have to do something for me before I give you that particular information.",

        "James: Did I mention that paltry reward? I'm really not interested in money.",
        "Margo: Then what do you want, James?",

        "Alison: But Dr. Dixon --",
        "John: And I'm certainly not gonna make a snap decision on Chris' innocence simply on your recommendation. But as to something that is your business, I want to talk about your coming back to work here. Listen, you're not yet 18 years old, are you?",
        "Alison: Yes, but I will be in a few days, so --",
        "John: Yeah, but you're underage right now. So I'm gonna have to talk to your mother about this, and if she says no, well, then that's the final word on it.",
