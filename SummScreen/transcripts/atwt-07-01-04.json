        "Paul and Roseanna share an evening, their feelings starting to become more than just friendship. Nikki finds the picture of Lucy but gives it back to Craig without seeing the back of it. Hal finds her after he'd argued with Emily and Emily told him that Nikki had a connection with Dusty. He chastises her and she takes him to the warehouse, discovering that it's empty, they figuring that they must have been shipped with the other stuff as they hid. Dusty and Lucy grow closer on their ride in the back of the truck. Craig tells Lily that he's checked into the Wagon Wheel and she comes over to talk him into coming back to the carriage house. As they talk, he mentions that he thinks that Alan may be behind Lucy's kidnapping, but then takes it back, blaming the accusation on being too worried and tired. Jennifer and Jordan are talking at the Lakeview Lounge when Barbara overhears that Paul has moved into Fairwinds. She tells Jennifer that she doesn't care how she gets Paul there, they are going to meet in the morning to discuss how James is still calling the shots and how they aren't being careful enough."

        "Emily: She was rude, okay? She was disrespectful to me and to my home.",
        "Hal: This is Nikki's home, too.",
        "Emily: So what would you have me do?",
        "Hal: You could have talked to me about it, Emily. You could have told me how you felt. I would've spoken to her. But you just toss her out into the night -- where'd she go?",
        "Emily: Oh, \"toss her out into the night\" -- I don't know where she went!",
        "Hal: She said something about being put up at the Wagon Wheel -- that's probably where she went.",
        "Emily: So, you're going all the way out there tonight?",
        "Hal: Well, my daughter had to, didn't she? And I'm not going to have her think that she's not welcome here. I'm just hoping with any luck I can talk her into coming back.",
        "Emily: While you're at it, why don't you convince darling Nikki to tell you about her direct pipeline to Dusty Donovan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Agent Munson --",
        "[Nikki sighs]",
        "Nikki: Everyone calls me Nikki. Are you staying here?",
        "Craig: Yes -- and you -- are you here hunting for clues about Lucy's kidnapping?",
        "Nikki: Actually I'm staying here, too. I thought you were a houseguest of Lily and Holden Snyder.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. More of a burden. So I checked in here.",
        "Nikki: Sometimes family members are the last ones to make you feel at home.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Nikki: Look, I'm sorry. This is a time when you really need to be around people who know and love both you and Lucy --",
        "Craig: No, I need you to tell me what you know about her --",
        "Nikki: Look, you already know that I have it on good authority that she's fine.",
        "Craig: If you know where she is, you have to tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Come on. Its okay, come on. You okay? You all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm fine. I wish we knew where this truck was going.",
        "Dusty: Well, we gotta stop before we can get out of here, you know.",
        "Lucy: What if these are the same guys who tried to grab me before? What if they're taking us somewhere to kill us or something?",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no! These guys are truckers. It's cool. It's fine. We're gonna be fine. Okay. It's gonna be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Cabot is so fussy. His teeth are really bothering him -- poor thing.",
        "Jordan: Well, I can pull night-duty if you want.",
        "Rosanna: No, that's okay. I'm up half the night listening for him anyway.",
        "Jordan: Since Cabot's down -- if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna go out for a little while.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no. Go ahead. Have fun. Everything's all settled here.",
        "Jordan: Okay. Good. If you need me, I'll be at the Lakeview. Maybe I can catch a late drink with Jennifer.",
        "Rosanna: Good.",
        "Paul: Don't forget your curfew, junior. Don't drink and drive.",
        "Rosanna: That was not necessary.",
        "Paul: You're probably right. Sorry. It won't happen again. I just couldn't resist.",
        "Rosanna: Mm, yes, I got you.",
        "Paul: So, what've you got to eat around this mansion?",
        "Rosanna: Well, there's plenty of applesauce and strained peas.",
        "Paul: How 'bout eggs? You got eggs? Bread, milk?",
        "Rosanna: I'm sure we have plenty of those.",
        "Paul: Eggs-selent. Cinnamon?",
        "Rosanna: I think so.",
        "Paul: Great, French toast it is.",
        "Rosanna: French toast? You make French toast? Well, aren't you full of surprises?",
        "Paul: Oh, you have no idea. Can I tempt you?",
        "Rosanna: Consider me tempted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: He's gone.",
        "Jessica: Who? Who's gone?",
        "Margo: Tom. He's gone.",
        "Jessica: Okay, wait, wait. Just slow down a minute. Maybe he just went to the store or had a night arraignment or something.",
        "Margo: No, no. Look at the time. He -- we were talking about Doc, and then I had to leave -- I had to go to Katie's. And then -- oh, God, Jessica, you don't think that maybe he --",
        "Jessica: No, Tom wouldn't go after Doc --",
        "Margo: Yes, he would. He would. I can't use our phone. Jessica, you do it. You call Doc. Please \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Evening, Tom. It's kinda late for you, isn't it?",
        "Tom: Later than you think.",
        "Doc: Yeah?",
        "Tom: Yeah. So what's the deal, Doc? Between you and my wife? You're a big tough guy, you man enough to tell me the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Why are you coming to me about your wife?",
        "Tom: Because I know that you and Margo are having an intimate relationship. [Phone ringing] Well, aren't you gonna get that? Wouldn't want to miss her call to warn you.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Jessica: He's not picking up.",
        "Margo: He has to.",
        "Doc: Your wife would hardly be calling me.",
        "Tom: Then go ahead and answer it. Better yet, why don't you let me see who it is? Well?",
        "Doc: My lawyer -- and it's late, so it must be pretty important. If you don't mind -- hello?",
        "Jessica: Doc, it's Jessica. I'm here with Margo, and she's worried that Tom is trying to find you.",
        "Doc: That's a done deal.",
        "Jessica: He's there?",
        "Doc: That's right.",
        "Margo: Oh, God. No, no, no. What did Doc tell him?",
        "Jessica: Did you say anything?",
        "Doc: No, no I'll tell you I haven't. But those negotiations do tend to get a little tricky.",
        "Jessica: Just keep it brief, and make sure your stories are the same.",
        "Doc: Naturally. I'll defer to your judgment, but what exactly are we talking about here?",
        "Jessica: Hold on. What did you say to Tom?",
        "Margo: Um -- that it was a lot of flirting. It was just a lot of harmless banter. And there was one kiss. We happened to meet and there was one kiss. One.",
        "Jessica: Okay, you got that?",
        "Doc: Done. Done. I accept those terms. Thank you for calling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, so he'll talk to Tom, and he'll clear this whole thing up.",
        "Margo: Oh, but, Jessica, you more than anyone know that it was more than one kiss. I told you about that night that someone walked in on us --",
        "Jessica: Yeah --",
        "Margo: Well, it wasn't the first time. More happened -- more than even you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Sorry for the interruption.",
        "Tom: So, I'm wrong about the phone call, I'm not wrong about you and my wife. So let's hear it, Doc. Everything.",
        "Doc: Look, the truth is, I was attracted to her. Okay? And I did hit on her. And maybe just for fun she flirted back, but it was just a lot of harmless banter -- you know?",
        "Tom: No, I don't know. Because obviously, you're leaving something out.",
        "Doc: Okay. One time it did get out of hand. We found ourselves alone, and there was a kiss. But that's it.",
        "Tom: Then what?",
        "Doc: Nothing. Nothing. She said she didn't want to put your marriage on the line. You know, Tom, if you wanna take a shot at me, go ahead. I deserve it. But don't take it out on Margo. She's a good woman.",
        "Tom: So, harmless banter, one kiss, found ourselves alone -- you know, your stories are surprisingly similar.",
        "Doc: Or maybe, it's because they're true.",
        "Tom: Or maybe, as they say in my line of work, the witness was coached.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, I can tell you I do not want to call that Dean and tell him that Lucy is not attending this fall.",
        "Nikki: No, don't do that. You have to live your life like nothing has ever even happened. You know, pretty soon, you're gonna be driving Lucy to school and buying posters for her dorm room.",
        "Craig: Yeah. [Phone ringing] Excuse me. Oh, it's Lily. [Phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, Lily?",
        "Lily: Craig, are you all right? We were expecting you for dinner.",
        "Craig: Yes, I know. I'm sorry, but I just couldn't -- you've all been very kind, but I feel like a third wheel there, so I checked into that old motel, room 38.",
        "Lily: The Wagon Wheel? Craig, that is a flea bag. Come on, you have to rethink this.",
        "Craig: No, no, I'm imposing.",
        "Lily: You're not imposing. I'm sorry about what happened with my mother earlier.",
        "Craig: Lily, look, my battery's cutting -- let me get back to you. Okay? What's that?",
        "Nikki: You dropped something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Here you go.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: I know you're scared. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.",
        "Lucy: What if the truckers call the police? I think you were trying to get away from them when you stopped to help me. What if you got caught? What if you get in a fight with these guys and something happens to you? I'll be all alone -- I'm sorry, that didn't come out right.",
        "Dusty: That's okay. You don't want to get stranded -- I get it.",
        "Lucy: I just don't want you to think I'm just thinking about me -- I'm not. I don't want anything to happen to you. You've gotten me through so much now --",
        "Dusty: Look, whatever happens when we get out of here, we'll handle it. We'll handle it. Trust me.",
        "Lucy: I do.",
        "Dusty: As long as I'm breathing, nothing's gonna happen to you. I'm not gonna let it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Nice that you could get away to see me.",
        "Jordan: I want to see you every night -- and every day. Don't think that's changed just because I'm staying at Fairwinds.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you, I needed that.",
        "Jordan: Well, I needed to say it. I hate the weird way that we left things. You know, this is just for a little while, Jen. If we can just get over this hump, then you and I can be together the way that we want to.",
        "Jennifer: I keep telling myself that, it's just --",
        "Jordan: What?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I -- I'm a little jealous, I guess. I get this knot in my stomach every time I think about you getting up to have breakfast with your baby's mother.",
        "Jordan: And his uncle.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Jordan: Paul. After you left, he announced that he was moving in, too.",
        "Jennifer: Great. Great. It's like a regular clown car over there. Is everyone deciding to hang their hat at Fairwinds but me?",
        "Jordan: Well, it wasn't my doing. Paul thinks that Rosanna needs protection, and she obviously agreed, so you know -- who am I to tell her what to do in her own house?",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna and Paul are only friends, and now they're living together. You and I are a lot more. Heck, if my brother is moving into Fairwinds, maybe I should, too.",
        "Barbara: Paul is living at Fairwinds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I am never gonna be able to have French toast without Chardonnay and candlelight again.",
        "Paul: All right. Cheers.",
        "Rosanna: Bottom's up. [Laughter] [High pitch tone] I love that. I love -- wait, wait. A musician, you see.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[High pitch tone]",
        "Paul: I think this one needs to be lower.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. This one, too.",
        "Paul: All right. You know \"Smoke on the Water?\"",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't. How 'bout the theme from \"Star Wars?\"",
        "Paul: I know that one.",
        "Rosanna: \"Close Encounters?\" Ah -- oh, no wait. I got it. I've got it. This is very charming.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Let me call you .",
        "Paul: Oh, I know that one. Sweetheart I'm in love with you [Laughter] I'm in love with you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you're a genius. I think --",
        "Paul: Not bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Must've fallen out of my -- my pocket. She's a lot prettier in person but still I -- I'm up a lot at night with that photo. Anyway, I pray she's all right. How can you be sure that she's not in any danger from Dusty Donovan?",
        "Nikki: A couple of ways. It's not his M.O. he hasn't made any threats. I mean, the real kidnappers are just biding their time. Until we find out who hired them, we just have to assume they're going to pounce. Dusty is the only reason she's safe.",
        "Craig: But how can you be sure?",
        "Nikki: Look, we think there might be a connection on the inside.",
        "Craig: Inside? How?",
        "Nikki: Donovan came to you and Alan Drake with Lucy's whereabouts. You two were the only ones who knew where she was. But still, Creel and his buddy got to them before you and the cops did. Who tipped them off? I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. I'm beat. Good night.",
        "Craig: Good night. Good night. Well, they want a suspect, it better not be me. Hello, Lily. Oh, you were putting the kids to bed? Oh, pretty rough. Look, I know it's late and I don't have a right to ask, but I need to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Dad, you freaked me out.",
        "Hal: Don't \"Dad\" me, Agent Munson. How long have you been in touch with Dusty Donovan? And why didn't I know about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We should probably figure out what we're gonna do later when we stop.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I owe you an apology.",
        "Dusty: For what?",
        "Lucy: For all the mean things I said to you. I know you were just trying to help me. I'm just too stubborn to see it.",
        "Dusty: That's okay. Don't sweat it, baby.",
        "Lucy: You've done a lot for me. I just want you to know how grateful --",
        "Dusty: I want you to stay safe and stay alive. That's it, nothing more. Can you please do that for me? And I'm sorry that, you know, I treated you like such a little spoiled brat. I thought you were a Daddy's girl, but, apparently, you're not. You're brave, you're a regular \"Charlie's Angel\" with a broom. You're not so bad to hang out with, either.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: You're okay, Montgomery. You're okay.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I mean, the truth is that Doc and I -- we didn't sleep together. So -- so why should I tell Tom everything when all it's going to do is hurt him?",
        "Jessica: I agree.",
        "Margo: But then Tom keeps hitting me with all of these questions, these very pointed questions, and every time I lie to him I just die a little. Because then I have to face the truth inside of me. That inside of me, I wanted Doc. I was so tired of fighting it. But the truth is I spent all day thinking about going to that man's hotel room that night. And I wanted to sleep with that man -- that man that's not my husband.",
        "Jessica: Margo, you didn't sleep with him. So don't beat yourself up.",
        "Margo: But I was so tempted.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, okay, you were tempted. But when it came down to it, you walked away.",
        "Margo: No I didn't. Doc called it off. I would have gone through with it. I would have gone there. And I would have made love -- excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Synchronizing your stories -- that part of the harmless banter?",
        "Doc: Look, I told it like it was, Tom. Our stories jive because that's what happened. You know, instead of running around trying to dig up some dirt on Margo, you ought to be thanking your lucky stars she's so devoted to you.",
        "Tom: I don't need your advice on how to appreciate my wife! From here on out, you stand down.",
        "Doc: You sure you don't want to take that shot?",
        "Tom: I am the district attorney in this town. My reach might be longer and more devastating than any right hook.",
        "Doc: I'll remember that.",
        "Tom: You do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I spoke to Tom.",
        "Jessica: Did he believe you?",
        "Doc: I think so.",
        "Jessica: We need to meet.",
        "Doc: Why?",
        "Jessica: We need to talk about what happened.",
        "Doc: Nothing happened, remember? Your words, not mine.",
        "Jessica: Will you meet me or not?",
        "Doc: Okay. Where?",
        "Jessica: I have to go. Meet me at the Snyder Pond. I'll call you from my car with directions. I'm on my way. You okay?",
        "Margo: Was that was Ben?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, he locked himself out. So I'm gonna go over there and let him in and then I'll come back.",
        "Margo: No, Jess. You don't have to be my babysitter.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I don't mind.",
        "Margo: Jessica, you are the best friend any woman could have.",
        "Jessica: Listen, hang in there, okay?",
        "Margo: I'm trying. But, if Tom ever does find out everything, it would just be the end of us. And I don't think I could handle that.",
        "Jessica: Look, it's over, okay? We've taken care of it. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Doc: Get out of here now.",
        "Jessica: Excuse me?",
        "Doc: Just get out. Somebody's back there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: 'Cause if I find out that the two of you are trying to undermine us, I will cut you out of my life without a second thought. Am I clear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Come on, Jessica. I didn't hear you pull up.",
        "Jessica: I parked on the other side of the pond.",
        "Doc: Listen, I don't know what more I can tell you. I did my best with Tom. I took the heat for what happened between Margo and me, but the guy was pretty riled up.",
        "Jessica: Can you blame him?",
        "Doc: Listen, the last thing I need is a threat from the District Attorney.",
        "Jessica: Well, hopefully he's calmed down by now.",
        "Doc: I don't know about that. I tried to do everything I could to convince him that I didn't sleep with his wife, but --",
        "Jessica: Wait a minute, wait a minute. When you say you tried everything, you didn't tell him you were with someone else, did you? Because it would be a disaster if Tom started looking my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: I made a deal with Dusty.",
        "Hal: What kind of a deal?",
        "Nikki: He will testify against Starziak in the money laundering case if I give him Donald Creel.",
        "Hal: You don't have the authority to do that, Nikki.",
        "Nikki: Dusty wants to find out who's behind the plot to snatch Lucy. When he does, he will roll on Starziak.",
        "Hal: You do realize that you've compromised a kidnapping investigation here?",
        "Nikki: It's not a kidnapping. She's there on her own free will. She is totally loyal to him.",
        "Hal: Look, Nikki, I know you want to prove yourself on this one but, honey, you've got a lot to learn.",
        "Nikki: I've made no mistakes.",
        "Hal: You've made every mistake. You go in without backup. You gave Dusty key information. Now he's got an edge and he's got you jumping to his tune. You gotta learn to zip it, honey. You keep showing your hand, and not only gonna blow this case, but your whole career is gonna be dead in the water. Now, honey, let me help you. You've got to tell me where they are.",
        "Nikki: I can do better than that. I'll show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: You didn't know that Paul was moving in?",
        "Barbara: Of course not.",
        "Jordan: Because that wouldn't have been the first time that you've used someone to be your eyes and ears.",
        "Barbara: I would never approve of Paul moving in to Fairwinds. He knows what I went through there with James. He also knows that I want to keep him and Jennifer as far away from that place as possible.",
        "Jordan: And as far as possible from me?",
        "Barbara: If that's what it takes to protect my family, yes.",
        "Jordan: Well, you protect your family all you want, Barbara. But things aren't going to change between Jennifer and me. We want to be together. And we will be.",
        "Barbara: Need I remind you that you now have a son? Obligations?",
        "Jordan: I'm fully aware of my responsibilities to Cabot.",
        "Barbara: And to his mother, your wife.",
        "Jordan: Come on, Barbara. You know that that's only temporary. Rosanna and I have not changed our plans to have the marriage annulled.",
        "Barbara: In the meantime, my daughter is involved with a married man who just happens to be James Stenbeck's son.",
        "Jennifer: Mother, how many times have we been through this?",
        "Jordan: I'm sorry, Barbara, but my unfortunately complicated life really isn't your business.",
        "Barbara: But Jennifer is.",
        "Jordan: And I've only been keeping you in the loop because I love her. And because you and I were close in the past. But that will stop if I find out you sent Paul in as part of some plan to keep Jennifer away from me.",
        "Barbara: I have done no such thing.",
        "Jordan: I hope not. Because if I find out that the two of you are trying to undermine us, I will cut you out of my life without a second thought. Am I clear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You -- me -- me -- you -- [Rosanna laughing] It's not bad, you know?",
        "Rosanna: Yea, us.",
        "Paul: Yea, us -- you.",

        "Rosanna: Let's take this show on the road, or not.",
        "Paul: Oh, I don't know about that. But never let it be said that Rosanna Cabot and Paul Ryan did not make beautiful music together.",
        "Rosanna: Amen, brother.",
        "Paul: Cheers.",
        "Rosanna: Cheers. Bottoms up.",

        "Craig: Yeah, well --",
        "Lily: What is it? Something happen with Lucy?",
        "Craig: The police think that maybe the person who kidnapped her is somehow connected to the family and maybe even the department.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Craig: I know. It's unbelievable. But then -- then I started turning things over in my mind and --",
        "Lily: Like what?",
        "Craig: No, the minute I start talking about it, they're going to think I'm stirring up the pot.",
        "Lily: Would you stop with that? It's me you're talking to. Just tell me.",
        "Craig: What do you think about Sierra's new husband, Alan Drake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: So this is not about protecting Margo at all, is it? This is you covering your own backside.",
        "Jessica: Look, just tell me you didn't lead Tom to believe that I'm involved in any way.",
        "Doc: I told you before, Jessica, I am not out to break up anybody's marriage, including yours.",
        "Jessica: Well, the damage has been done, hasn't it?",
        "Doc: What the hell are you so bent out of shape about?",
        "Jessica: I just left Margo. She's a wreck. She and Tom could split up over this and she didn't even sleep with you. I did.",
        "Doc: But you don't know for a fact that they're gonna split up.",
        "Jessica: Well, it doesn't put my mind at ease about my situation. If Ben found out that this happened again --",
        "Doc: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Again? Lady, you've got more skeletons in your closet than I even care to know about.",

        "Barbara: Do you really think that James is going to allow you to undermine years and years of plotting and planning? You're going to put everybody you claim to care about at risk.",
        "Jennifer: Mother, what is he supposed to do? Stay married to a woman he doesn't love?",
        "Barbara: Oh, people do it all the time, Jen.",
        "Jordan: Look, I will handle James, Barbara. And neither you, nor he, will tell me how to live my life.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, don't worry. Mother won't be a problem. Because she already knows the price of interfering in her children's love lives. Don't you?",
        "Barbara: I am not going to allow this madness to go on much longer. Not as long as Jennifer is within my reach.",
        "Jordan: Well, maybe it's time that she cut the apron strings. Maybe you should move into Fairwinds with us. We'll be one big, happy family.",

        "Paul: I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from. We were having such a good time. Sorry.",
        "Rosanna: It's okay. It's okay. It was nice. It was nice. I'm having a good time. In fact, I can't remember the last time I had such a good time. Feels good to laugh and relax. Thank you. Thank you for bringing me back here. I owe you so much.",
        "Paul: You owe me? I'm the one who had your whole life ripped apart at the seams.",
        "Rosanna: Well, apparently you're the one who's helping me to mend it again. And for that, I am eternally grateful. [Cabot crying] You know what they say -- all good things -- it's Cabot. Excuse me.",

        "Hal: Donovan?",
        "Nikki: They're gone. He totally played me.",
        "Hal: Maybe not. Didn't you say this place was full of boxes?",
        "Nikki: Yeah. You don't think somebody already came and picked up a shipment, do you?",
        "Hal: Well there's only one way to find out. Let's get back to the station, Agent Munson. Looks like you've got a long night in front of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: When the truck stops, we gotta move fast. When they start to unload, we'll move to the back, gather ourselves, figure out where we are, and then make our move. You got it? Lucy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Never mind. I mean, he's your sister's husband.",
        "Lily: That doesn't matter. We have to question everybody.",
        "Craig: So what do you think?",
        "Lily: I know about as much about Alan as you do. But I can't question Sierra's judgment.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. I know, I know. Maybe it's just me.",
        "Lily: No. No, it's this isolation. You cannot do this. You have to be around people who care about you.",
        "Craig: Is there such an animal?",
        "Lily: Come on, please. There's me. I'm here. And that's just for starters. We'll get through this. I promise. You didn't touch your soup.",

        "Lily: Let's go. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.",

        "Tom: Well, you left the gym pretty fast. You meeting somebody?",
        "Doc: Just out for a drive, my car overheated. Thought I'd stop and let it cool off for a little while.",
        "Tom: Oh, well, see, that's the problem with these jazzy cars -- they're all body, nothing inside. So was this a midnight rendezvous, 'cause I could've sworn I heard somebody trying to get outta here pretty fast when I pulled up.",
        "Doc: It's a nice night. From what I hear, bunch of kids come out here and cruise around. But I'll tell you what, interrogation's over, Mr. District Attorney.",

        "Jennifer: This is my life, Mother, not yours.",
        "Barbara: No, it's our lives. Don't you realize this? You kids have got to realize that our very family's survival is at stake here. So, we're gonna sit down, you and Paul and me, and figure out what we're going to do about it. So you call your brother and tell him to meet us here in the morning.",
        "Jennifer: Paul doesn't like being summoned.",
        "Barbara: Then you have a problem, don't you? I don't care how you have to do it. You march over there and drag him out of there by his thumbs. Just do it.",
