        "Casey tells Alison that a doctor assured him that he isn't the father of Vienna's baby. He doesn't mention that Chris was the doctor because he doesn't want to get him in trouble. Casey thanks Alison for her help and asks her out on a date and Alison accepts the invitation. Alison later gets a letter from Mick asking her if they still have a chance at a relationship because his treatment is working and he is getting better. When Alison asks for advice about the letter, Emily tells her to burn it, forget about her past, and look to the future. Alison is burning the letter at the hospital when Casey walks in, so she tells him about Mick's letter and that she is burning it to put the past behind her and look forward to the future.",
        "Emily forgives Paul and thanks him for the ring he gave her but she tells Paul she will never be able to forgive Barbara for almost ruining their marriage.

Henry asks Paul to be the best man for his wedding and Paul is honored to be his best friend and get to know his brother better. Paul helps Henry get wedding rings at the last minute because he forgot to buy them. Henry also tells Emily not to be so harsh to Barbara. Barbara and Henry agree to still be good friends after he marries Vienna.",
        "Katie fins Henry at Brad's grave and persuades him to marry Vienna because she thinks what he feels for Barbara is just desire.

Barbara goes to Fashions to give Vienna one hour to tell Henry the truth about Casey but Vienna has already left the store.

        "Alison: Well, you must be incredibly relieved -- I mean, just because, you know, you weren't planning on having a baby, not yet.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I really wasn't ready for it. But I don't have to worry about it now.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm really happy for you, Case.",
        "Casey: And I'm really grateful to you.",
        "Alison: Me? Why?",
        "Casey: Well, you -- you helped me when you didn't have to.",
        "Alison: Well, you know, I'm just glad that, um, we don't have to snoop around anymore.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Me too. Though it was -- it was kind of fun playing detective together, don't you think?",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was.",
        "Casey: Good times.",
        "Alison: Good times. So, what are we gonna do, I mean, now that we don't have that to entertain us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Vienna, what's wrong?",
        "Vienna: Is -- is Henry here?",
        "Katie: Uh, no. I haven't seen him. Why?",
        "Vienna: Because we spent the night apart because I was acting all superstitious, and I told him it was bad luck for him to see me.",
        "Katie: So then why are you looking for Henry? You should be getting ready. Have you picked up your dress?",
        "Vienna: No. It's not quite ready yet.",
        "Katie: Have you had breakfast?",
        "Vienna: Are you kidding? I'm too nervous to eat. I -- I just want to make sure that Henry is okay.",
        "Katie: No, you want to know where he spent the night. He was probably at Paul's.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. I hope not. What if he ran into Barbara there?",
        "Katie: Vienna, for the last time, there's nothing going on between Henry and Barbara. Whatever flirtation was there is not there anymore. You just need to relax.",
        "Vienna: No. It's not that.",
        "Katie: What, what? What are you not telling me?",
        "Vienna: I'm just -- I'm trying not to freak out.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "Vienna: Barbara knows that I had sex with Casey, and I'm just worried she's gonna tell Henry.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God! Barbara knows? How did she find out?",
        "Vienna: Yes. She overheard me talking to Casey.",
        "Katie: Does she know that you're not really pregnant?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no. Thank god, no. But, you know, I'm just worried she's gonna find Henry before I can and tell him what she does know. And if she does, she can potentially ruin everything.",
        "Katie: What are you gonna do?",
        "Vienna: I need your help.",
        "Katie: Doing what?",
        "Vienna: Make Barbara go away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You like the ring.",
        "Emily: Oh, what's not to like?",
        "Paul: I know it doesn't make up for everything that I put you through.",
        "Emily: No, but it definitely helps.",
        "Paul: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I really just want to put all of this behind us.",
        "Emily: Me too. Me too. I'm glad it's over. I'm glad it's over and Meg can't hurt us anymore. I just -- I know I said it a thousand times. I just wish you had told me you had a plan so I could have maybe helped you.",
        "Paul: I couldn't. I didn't want to take any chance that Meg might get more suspicious.",
        "Emily: You know what? By now, you'd think you'd have a little more faith in my skills of deception.",
        "Paul: And I was trying to protect you. If the whole thing blew up in my face, I didn't want you held accountable, also.",
        "Emily: Really? I guess I should be grateful to you.",
        "Paul: You should. I'm grateful everything's back to normal. Eliza's safe. We're a family again. And everything is just as it should be.",
        "Emily: Mm, almost.",
        "Paul: What am I missing?",
        "Emily: Your mother.",
        "Paul: Emily --",
        "Emily: Look, I understand. I understand why you did what you did. But Barbara nearly destroyed our marriage. And for that, I will never forgive her -- ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: And how exactly do you propose I make Barbara go away? It's not like I can just mow her down with my car.",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Katie: Vienna --",
        "Vienna: No, I -- you know, I just want to have a -- a happy life with Henry and beautiful children, and I feel like everything is just conspiring against us. You know, I feel everything is just falling apart.",
        "Katie: It's not falling apart. Calm down. You are gonna have a beautiful wedding and a wonderful life with Henry with your gorgeous children.",
        "Vienna: Not if I can't get pregnant. And obviously I can, so what's wrong with me?",
        "Katie: You're freaking yourself out, and it's getting in the way. You've got to just calm down, take a deep breath. It's going to happen. Besides, you have more pressing issues to worry about right now.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, like keeping Barbara away from Henry. You sure you're not willing to --",
        "Katie: Stop, Vienna. Stop right there. We've got to come up with something better than bodily harm.",
        "Vienna: You're right, you're right. And whatever it is, we got to come up with it fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Henry?",
        "Henry: I wasn't anywhere near that card game, I swear.",
        "Barbara: Calm down. It's me. It's just me.",
        "Henry: Barbara, good morning.",
        "Barbara: Is it?",
        "Henry: I will tell you in about an hour. I need a, uh -- I need like a caffeine I.V. drip.",
        "Barbara: You look like you haven't slept all night long.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, I haven't really.",
        "Barbara: Don't tell me you've been down here the entire night.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. Just since about 2:00 A.M.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Henry: Vienna and I decided to spend the night apart.",
        "Barbara: Oh.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: So she told you everything?",
        "Henry: Huh?",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry. I am -- I am so sorry about all this. But it's for the best, really, in the long run.",
        "Henry: What's for the best? Barbara, what in God's name are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: So you and Vienna didn't have a fight?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Barbara: Then why did you spend the night down here?",
        "Henry: Because I have a very superstitious fianc\u00e9, and she didn't think I should see her before the wedding.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I see. How old-fashioned.",
        "Henry: What did you mean \"It's probably for the best\"? What's for the best?",
        "Barbara: Nothing, nothing. I -- I just made some assumptions. I just assumed that maybe that the two of you had had a fight about something, so you spent the night down here, and you decided to call off the wedding.",
        "Henry: You immediately jumped to that conclusion?",
        "Barbara: I did, I did. I jumped, because frankly, I don't think that you should be marrying Vienna, 'cause frankly, I can't stand her.",
        "Henry: Well, frankly, Barbara, there are very few people you can stand.",
        "Barbara: Luckily, you're one of them.",
        "Henry: Even after Vienna makes an honest man of me?",
        "Barbara: Honest? It's gonna take more than marriage to destroy your devious spirit. I am sure of that.",
        "Henry: You know me so well.",
        "Barbara: Too well.",
        "Henry: We'll still be friends, won't we?",
        "Barbara: I'd hate to lose that.",
        "Henry: Join me for a cup of coffee?",
        "Barbara: You sure you don't want something stronger on this morning?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I probably should, but I won't.",
        "Barbara: You're gonna go through with this wedding.",
        "Henry: It's the best thing all around for everybody.",
        "Barbara: Even for you?",
        "Henry: Please don't make this any harder than it already is, okay?",
        "Barbara: Okay, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Waiter, um, can we get some coffee here?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Nice and strong.",
        "Barbara: And an I.V. drip, if you have one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You could just tell Henry the truth.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, and what if it backfires? What if I lose Henry when I tell him that there is no baby and I've been lying all along?",
        "Katie: Just tell him how scared you were that you would lose him, that you would be devastated by that. He'll understand.",
        "Vienna: Or he won't. No, you know what? I can't take that chance. I just -- I just can't.",
        "Katie: I think you're taking a chance that's even more risky.",
        "Vienna: You know, I -- I know how painful it has been for you, losing Brad. But at least you had a baby with him made out of love, and that's all that I want. But I -- I just -- I just need more time. And if I push Henry away now, it'll never happen.",
        "Katie: But what if you lose him later?",
        "Vienna: No. He'll never find out that I lied because once we get married, I -- I will get pregnant. Maybe it'll even happen tonight, on our wedding night. You know, I'm praying for that. And then -- then we'll have the baby that I so want, the family I so want. And you -- you and Jacob will -- you will be a part of it. Don't you want that for me?",
        "Katie: Of course I do.",
        "Vienna: And don't you think Brad would want that for us? Don't you think he would be happy?",
        "Katie: I know he would.",
        "Vienna: Well, then, I need your help. I -- I can't do this alone. Please, Katie.",
        "Katie: Okay. Okay. Let's go get you ready for a wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know. We can crash Henry and Vienna's wedding.",
        "Alison: Are you serious?",
        "Casey: Semiserious.",
        "Alison: Wouldn't that be a little, uh, I don't know, too weird?",
        "Casey: Well, it would be fun at first, and then it would slowly, you know, probably get really --",
        "Alison: Awkward.",
        "Casey: Super awkward.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Any other bright ideas?",
        "Casey: Not yet, but I'm thinking about them, because I owe you a good time. What do you want to do?",
        "Alison: Um, whatever you want. I mean, surprise me. You know, I'm an easy date. But -- that didn't come out actually how I meant.",
        "Casey: It's okay. I -- I know what you mean.",
        "Alison: Okay. You also know what I didn't mean.",
        "Casey: Yes, yeah, but who's counting? I mean --",
        "Alison: Oh, good. So I'll see you later?",
        "Casey: Yes. And I will -- I'll find you.",
        "Alison: Okay. All right, good.",
        "Nurse: Oh, hey. This was just delivered for you.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I think you're overreacting.",
        "Emily: Your mother was bending over backwards, pointing the finger at me and accusing me of drugging Meg.",
        "Paul: Well, that's true.",
        "Emily: And she took great delight in the fact that you actually thought I was guilty.",
        "Paul: No, no. I was just pretending to think that you were guilty 'cause that was the only way I could think of to trick Meg into letting her defenses down.",
        "Emily: Okay, fine. What's Barbara's excuse?",
        "Paul: She doesn't have one. She was acting atrociously. She was hurting people left and right. But don't take it personally.",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? It is personal! She hates me! She's hated me her entire life! It's only personal, Paul.",
        "Paul: She just felt very rejected by Henry. That's all.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, then, maybe she shouldn't go chasing after boys half her age.",
        "Paul: You know, my mother is very sensitive. She was hurting.",
        "Emily: So what? Doesn't give her the right to make the rest of our lives miserable.",
        "Paul: No, it doesn't. She has a hard time believing that you and I are happy. But she -- she will come around. She will. You just -- you need to give her some time.",
        "Emily: You used to have less patience for this woman than anybody on the planet. What happened?",
        "Paul: Well, I have learned to be tolerant. Maybe you should try it.",
        "Emily: You're asking a lot.",
        "Paul: Okay, come on. Seriously, Emily, maybe it's time that you and I focus on all of the really great things we have in our life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I am so excited to see the finished dress.",
        "Vienna: Yes. They called from Fashions and said the dress will be ready for a final fitting in -- in half an hour. So I just -- I need to get a few things from the room.",
        "Katie: You're shaking.",
        "Vienna: Yes. I'm a nervous wreck.",
        "Katie: Don't be. Calm down. It's gonna be a beautiful ceremony.",
        "Vienna: If we ever find the groom. You know what? I think I need a drink to calm my nerves.",
        "Katie: No. Do you think that's a good idea?",
        "Vienna: A glass of champagne? Why not?",
        "Katie: Because you're supposed to be pregnant. What if we run into someone we know? A pregnant woman drinking champagne --",
        "Vienna: No. Who could possibly be in the lounge this early in the -- oh, my God. [Gasps] They're there, together. What if she's telling Henry about Casey right now?",
        "Katie: I don't think so. He doesn't look angry.",
        "Vienna: You're right. She's probably working her way up to it. Maybe there's still time.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Henry: Hello.",
        "Vienna: Hello, Mon Amor. I know where you are.",
        "Henry: You do?",
        "Vienna: I'm looking right at you. No, don't turn around! It's bad luck for you to see me.",
        "Henry: Listen, I can explain.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. There is no time for any explanations. We're getting married in like a few hours, and you probably have a lot left to do, no?",
        "Henry: You're not mad?",
        "Vienna: No. Of course not. But I will be if -- if you are gonna be running late for our wedding. So forget the coffee and -- and the conversations and just jump to it.",
        "Henry: I'm on my way. I've got to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Barbara: You're not wedded yet, and she's cracking the whip.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, for good reason. I've got a lot to do before this wedding.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm sure. Can I walk out with you, or would it be bad form?",
        "Henry: I'm sure that would be fine.",
        "Barbara: You may not know this, but I have a lot to do today myself. So I hope this day turns out to be everything you want it to be.",
        "Henry: So do I?",
        "Barbara: I see you brought your wingman.",
        "Vienna: No. Katie -- she's my maid of honor.",
        "Barbara: I think the correct term is \"Matron.\"",
        "Katie: You're one to talk. So, do you have something to say here or not? Because we're actually very busy.",
        "Barbara: There is a lot that I should say, not to you but to Henry. Why he's marrying someone who treats him like a dishrag is beyond me, especially when that someone is also a cheat.",
        "Vienna: Hmm-mm, I'm not a cheat. I -- I made a mistake.",
        "Barbara: Oh, is that what you call it? I wonder what Henry would think of your justification.",
        "Katie: Come on. We've got to get going. We have a lot to do before the wedding.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, because there will be a wedding, right?",
        "Barbara: I relish the fact that I hold your fate in my hands.",
        "Katie: Of course there will be a wedding. Barbara has no intention of ruining Henry's day. Right, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hi. Sorry to just drop in like this. Is this a bad time?",
        "Emily: No. Not at all. We were just, um, finishing breakfast, and then we were gonna get ready for the wedding. What's up?",
        "Paul: All right. I'll leave you two to talk. I love you.",
        "Emily: Oh. I love you.",
        "Alison: Well, it looks like things are back to normal with you two. Oh, my God. That ring is so nice.",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Alison: Oh. I'm glad you worked everything out.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Well, almost. Almost everything.",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Emily: Barbara, of course. But I know you didn't come here to talk to me about my monster-in-law, so what's up?",
        "Alison: This.",
        "Emily: What is it? Mick Dante?",
        "Alison: It got delivered to me this morning at the hospital.",
        "Emily: What did it say?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I was too creeped out to even open it up. Would you?",
        "Emily: You really want me to?",
        "Alison: Yes, please.",
        "Emily: \"Dearest Alison, you probably didn't expect to hear from me and didn't want to. I know how much I hurt you, and I want to tell you again how sorry I am for everything that happened, even though most of it was beyond my control. The therapy is going well, and as they say here, I'm starting to integrate my personalities. I feel like I'm changing for the better every day, but the one thing that never changes are my feelings for you. You are always in my thoughts and dreams. I need to know something. Do you think there might ever be a chance for us again? Mick.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Vienna, it's me. I've decided that it's cruel and unjust for you to force Henry into marrying you without knowing all the facts. So I'm going to give you the opportunity to tell him about Casey, the truth about Casey. You have one hour. And if you don't tell him, I will. Vienna, are you listening? Damn it, Vienna.",
        "Woman: [Gasps] I beg your pardon.",
        "Barbara: I am -- I am so sorry. I thought you were someone else.",
        "Woman: Well, I never.",

        "Salesgirl: Uh, Ms. Hyatt called to say she was running late.",
        "Barbara: Why didn't you tell me that in the first place? How interesting. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Can you believe I'm getting married in a few hours? Neither can I. I can't believe you're not gonna be standing up next to me at the ceremony. I was always counting on you to be my best man, Brad. I miss you, Buddy. [Sighs] Even when you were a ghost driving me crazy, I could always talk to you, and you would listen to me. I hope that you can hear me now, and I hope that you'll answer me, because I need some advice down here, and no one seems to be able to give it to me, not even Katie. I love Vienna. I do. At least I think I still do. Why am I hesitating? I cannot get Barbara Ryan out of my head. I know, that's crazy. Barbara, right? I know. But when Vienna left, my life fell to pieces, man, and she -- she put me back together. She did a pretty damn good job of fixing me up, considering. I'm still a mess. That's in my DNA. But -- there's another thing, Brad. I think I helped -- I think I helped Barbara, too. She needed me in a way that Vienna never did. It felt good to be needed. Whenever I'm with Vienna, I feel like I'm working overtime just to be something that she expects me to be. And then when I'm with Barbara, I feel like I'm myself. I'm completely comfortable. My God, Brad, what am I doing here? This is crazy. Am I about to make the worst decision of my life here? [Sighs] Can you hear me, man? I could use your help down here.",

        "Henry: Is that you, Brad? Is that your ghost again? Can you give me a sign here, please?",

        "Katie: Enough.",
        "Henry: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Same as you. I wanted to talk to Brad today, on your wedding day. You're not the only one that's emotional.",
        "Henry: Go figure. How's Vienna?",
        "Katie: Oh. Um, she is a nervous wreck, and it didn't help that she saw you with Barbara this morning.",
        "Henry: That was a cup of coffee. It was a chance meeting.",
        "Katie: You should make sure Vienna knows that.",
        "Henry: I will.",
        "Katie: Tell me something, and just be honest. Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm on my third round of them.",
        "Katie: Why are you so afraid to marry her?",
        "Henry: I don't know.",
        "Katie: You can imagine a life with Vienna, can't you?",
        "Henry: Katie, there is so much going on in my head right now, I can't imagine the next five months.",
        "Katie: Well, try, because it's not just your future that today depends on.",

        "Katie: Vienna loves you.",
        "Henry: I know, I know. And I want to do what's best for her and for the baby. I'm just not 100% sure what that is right now.",

        "Katie: What happened? Did you fall out of love with her?",
        "Henry: I'm not sure, Katie. I'm -- I'm not sure about anything right now.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Katie: We were so happy, remember, the four of us -- you and Vienna, me and Brad?",
        "Henry: Best friends.",
        "Katie: Don't let that slip away. Please, for Brad's sake, just hold on to it. Find that love that I know you have for Vienna.",
        "Henry: What about Barbara?",
        "Katie: That's not love. It's desire. There's a difference.",
        "Henry: You're right. I'm being foolish. I keep waiting for Brad to show up and kick me in the butt.",
        "Katie: Oh, don't worry, he's here. I know he is. He wants you to be happy, just like I do -- honestly happy.",
        "Henry: I believe that. And you know what?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: I've got a wedding I've got to get ready for.",

        "Alison: Good idea. I mean, especially since Casey and I are hanging out again.",
        "Emily: Casey -- you and Casey? What?",
        "Alison: Okay, don't freak out.",
        "Emily: I'm not freaking out. I'm just surprised he's even speaking to you.",
        "Alison: Well, we're on the mend, actually, kind of.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Alison: Yes. As friends. You know, I -- I was helping him deal with a problem. Uh, and, you know, it brought us closer.",
        "Emily: Good. Well, I'm -- I'm glad to hear that. All the more reason to forget about this, okay? So just take this, burn it, throw it away. Just forget about it, okay? And don't let Casey know it came. Just forget about the past. Focus on the future.",
        "Alison: Like you're doing with Barbara?",
        "Emily: There -- there is a person that I would love to sic Mick Dante on.",
        "Alison: Emily!",
        "Emily: No, it's true. I mean -- look, you cannot compare Mick and Barbara. It's like comparing apples and oranges, Sister, because Barbara -- Barbara is a monster of a completely different color.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I hope you think I did the right thing, urging Henry to marry Vienna. I know he's confused right now, but they belong together. He belongs with Vienna, not Barbara. And I hate that Vienna's lying to him about the baby, but maybe she's right. Maybe once they get married, she can get pregnant, and everything will be fine. I hope so. Oh, Honey, I missed you so much. Knowing that I have to go to this wedding today without you, the wedding of our best friends, is just breaking my heart. And I know that you think that I should be moving on, and you're probably right. I mean, I can't grieve forever. In fact, there is someone. Oh, I don't even know what's happening, and this feels really weird to talk to you about. But maybe you're happy about it. Jacob loves you and misses you and sends you a kiss. So do I. And I'll see you at the wedding, or I'll feel you there, 'cause I know you're gonna be there. You wouldn't miss it for the world. And I will be thinking about our wedding, how happy we were that day, and I want you to know that no matter what happens, nobody can take that away from me ever. I love you so much, Baby. [Sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Good morning. Uh, would you mind telling me what that very pretty young woman just picked up from you?",
        "Dr. Ming: I'm sorry. That is confidential information.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Um, even if I'm willing to pay for that information?",
        "Dr. Ming: I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you.",
        "Barbara: Ah. Well, can you tell me what it is you sell here?",
        "Dr. Ming: Take my card.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. \"Dr. Ming -- ancient herbal remedies and cures for rheumatism, arthritis, warts -- and infertility\"?",

        "Paul: Oh, you're nervous.",
        "Henry: No, I'm -- I'm cool as an iceberg in hell.",
        "Paul: It won't last like that, I promise. As soon as you see your woman walking down the aisle, you won't see anything but her.",
        "Henry: Okay, I'll take your word for it.",
        "Paul: So, what are you doing here?",
        "Henry: I, uh -- I need to ask you a favor.",
        "Paul: Sure. Name it.",

        "Paul: Seriously?",
        "Henry: I know this is a lot to ask. I know this is last-minute. And -- and I wouldn't ask you about it. Just this whole new brother thing --",
        "Paul: Hey, look, you don't have to sell me on that idea. Thank you. I would be honored.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I -- I'll throw in a case of champagne for the reception.",
        "Henry: You don't have to do that.",
        "Paul: No, anything to make this day special for you, Henry. Thanks.",

        "Paul: Come on. I'm doing it out of the goodness of my heart.",
        "Emily: [Laughs] Well, then, congratulations to the both of you. That's great. Where's Vienna? She getting dressed?",
        "Henry: I -- I hope so. She won't let me see her until the wedding.",
        "Emily: Oh, don't tell me she's superstitious.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Apparently so. [Laughs]",
        "Emily: So -- can I see the rings?",
        "Henry: The rings? Oh, my God, the rings. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.",
        "Paul: Calm down. Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. The rings, the rings. I completely forgot about the rings. Oh, my God. I forgot about the rings. How could I forget about the rings? How could I forget about the rings?",
        "Emily: We'll find them. We'll find them. Where did you leave them?",
        "Henry: I didn't leave them anywhere! I forgot to buy them! I didn't buy the rings! What kind of groom forgets to buy the rings? Oh, my God!",
        "Emily: The kind who has Barbara Ryan on the brain. That's who.",
        "Henry: No, don't blame Barbara. This is not about Barbara.",
        "Emily: Why not? I blame her for pretty much everything else.",
        "Paul: Okay, Honey, not -- not helpful.",
        "Emily: Well, it's the truth. The day that he gets Barbara out of his mind is gonna be the best day of his life.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Emily: Don't do that. Don't defend her.",
        "Henry: Well, why not? I'm -- I'm partially responsible for her behavior.",

        "Henry: I made a mess of her life.",
        "Emily: No, no. She did that all on her own.",
        "Henry: I twisted her up in knots. If I hadn't betrayed her, she never would have been pulled into your lives.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. Don't give yourself that much credit.",
        "Henry: I -- I will give myself that much credit. She never would have moved into here with you two.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, that I am tempted to blame you.",
        "Paul: Okay, you know what? Why are we even talking about this? You are marrying Vienna in a few short hours, okay? And whatever is going on between you and my mother -- and believe me, the less I know about that, the better -- is over. Am I right about that?",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Paul: Well, then, can we please for once forget about my mother and focus on this wedding? Can we do that? Can we do that?",
        "Emily: All right!",

        "Barbara: Oh. So there are cameras in the dressing room? Interesting.",

        "Casey: So, you're gonna tell me what it was you were burning?",
        "Alison: Just some bad memories.",

        "Alison: No, it's okay. You should know the truth. But you're not gonna like it.",
        "Casey: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.",
        "Alison: No, I want to tell you. It was a letter from Mick.",

        "Alison: He wanted me to know that he was getting better.",

        "Casey: That's it?",
        "Alison: No. There's more.",

        "Casey: Get back together? Is he insane? I mean --",
        "Alison: Technically, yes.",
        "Casey: You seem upset. Or is it -- is it just confusion? I mean, you hear from this guy, and --",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: It's nothing. It's none of my business.",
        "Alison: I want it to be your business. I mean, I told you about the letter, didn't I?",
        "Casey: But you didn't tell me how you feel about it.",
        "Alison: I feel scared and a little anxious, I guess. But I also feel relieved, because I know that Mick can't hurt me anymore. And -- and I think that burning this letter was kind of like, I don't know, a symbolic way of me letting go of the past, you know, and --",
        "Casey: And thinking only of the future.",
        "Alison: And also thinking the present, too.",

        "Paul: Yeah, I like it. Take it off now.",
        "Emily: [Laughs] Everything squared away with Henry?",
        "Paul: Yes. The, uh -- the rings have been ordered, the champagne is on its way, and the groom is busy getting spiffy.",
        "Emily: Ooh, spiffy. That's very sweet of you that you, uh, agreed to be his best man.",
        "Paul: Please. I'm happy to do it. I'm happy to get to know him. If somebody had told me a year ago that Henry Coleman and I would be friends, let alone brothers, I would have said they were crazy.",
        "Emily: Well, see? Goes to show you, you never know what life will bring.",
        "Paul: I'm very happy today.",
        "Emily: Me too. Of course, I'd be happier if you were, say, an orphan.",
        "Paul: Come on. Look, Barbara is only a problem in your life, Emily, if you allow her.",
        "Emily: Well, that would be a lot easier if she were living in a different house or state or planet.",
        "Paul: She's not, okay? So you're just gonna have to make the best of the situation.",
        "Emily: Cyanide?",
        "Paul: Stop it.",
        "Emily: They say it's painless.",

        "Katie: You can't be serious.",
        "Vienna: No. Katie, it's already noticed that I'm not showing. Now I will be.",
        "Katie: Oh, I still wish you didn't have to go through the charade? Why can't you just tell Henry the truth?",
        "Vienna: Katie, we've been over this. If I tell him that there is no baby, I risk, you know, him getting angry and leaving me.",
        "Katie: All right. Well, I don't believe that, but whatever. I'll have to let it go.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. What's wrong? You seem a little sad.",
        "Katie: Oh. I -- I went to Brad's grave.",
        "Vienna: Katie, today, on my wedding day?",
        "Katie: It's not a bad thing. It's a good one. I go all the time. It helps. It's very comforting.",
        "Vienna: Well, okay, then. I'm happy for you. Do you have some water?",
        "Katie: Uh, sure.",

        "Vienna: It's a Chinese fertility herb. I got it in, uh, Chinatown.",
        "Katie: Oh, Vienna, please tell me you're kidding.",
        "Vienna: No, I'm not. It's from Dr. Ming, and he is a fertility specialist.",
        "Katie: I don't know if that's such a good idea. You don't even know what you're taking.",
        "Vienna: It's a natural herb with very strong success rates. What could go wrong?",
        "Katie: Well, do you have to experiment on today of all days? You're about to get married.",
        "Vienna: My point exactly. I'm gonna try to get pregnant tonight, on my wedding night.",
        "Katie: All right. Just be careful.",
        "Vienna: You know, I'm not worried about this. What I'm worried about is Barbara.",
        "Katie: You need to let that go.",
        "Vienna: Yes. I will. But are you sure she's gonna keep her mouth shut about me and Casey?",
        "Katie: I think if she was gonna blow you out of the water, she would have done it already. So stop with the negative thoughts. Think positive and happy.",
