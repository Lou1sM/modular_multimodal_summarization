        "A violent rocking boat causes Mike and Vienna to get stuck in his cabin. The captain later helps them get out, only to share bad news with them; a witness saw a petite blonde and tall dark gentleman go overboard. Katie and Simon are stuck holding on for dear life to a life preserver as they head hopefully towards an island for refuge. A food fight sparks unresolved feelings for Carly and Jack. Jess interrupts them and wonders if the divorce should proceed? Carly reluctantly is the one to say the divorce is still on, as Jack seems to be less sure. Will tells Gwen that Jen is dying; he laments he should be the one dying since he, Paul and Barbara always do the wrong thing and they are fine and here Jen finally gets Johnny back and now she is dying. Gwen and Will comfort one another. Dallas confronts Maddie on the rooftop about him not being in Oakdale because of her, but she obviously hasn't dealt with being sexually assaulted yet. She shouldn't' be keeping that from Casey. He can still help her put away the man that stole her innocence though. Maddie pulls away as Casey walks in demanding to know what is going on? Maddie covers by claiming he has no right to ask since they are not together anymore. She also drives home the fact when she lies by claiming she doesn't love him. Bob tells Jen's devastated family that her condition is irreversible; her organs are shutting down. Barbara offers her organs, but Bob informs her it is too late. She has a very short time to live. Jen wants to get married that day and they start to make plans. Dusty continues to be in denial about Jen's condition, insisting she will get better."

        "Mike: This door won't open. It's really jammed.",
        "Vienna: Make it stop!",
        "Mike: What, the storm?",
        "Vienna: Whatever! I hate it when the floor moves.",
        "Mike: Just lie down and close your eyes, then.",
        "Vienna: Not without something to hold onto. Lie down with me.",
        "Mike: No, are you kidding me? Katie's up on the deck. I've got to go find her.",
        "Vienna: Forget about Katie. She's probably up there in the lounge with Simon drinking one of those Australian beers he's so devoted to. You know he told me that the bubbles would settle my stomach? Do you believe it? Oh, my God, I need my medication! Open that door, Cupcake, or this is not going to be pretty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Grab on! Hold on.",
        "Katie: Where's the boat?",
        "Simon: Turn around.",
        "Katie: No! Wait, wait! We're over here!",
        "Simon: They're never going to hear you.",
        "Katie: Don't leave us!",
        "Simon: Katie!",
        "Katie: We're going to die!",
        "Simon: No, we're not.",
        "Katie: Yes, we are.",
        "Simon: No, we're not.",
        "Katie: How can you say that? We're in the middle of the ocean in the middle of a storm in the middle of the night. This is all your fault.",
        "Simon: My fault? What?",
        "Katie: I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon, and instead, I'm in the water and Mike's on the boat and I'm never going to see him again! No, I hate you.",
        "Simon: Well, that's just too bad, all right? 'Cause right now, I'm all you've got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on you.",
        "Carly: It's okay. I'm just trying to clean out this shirt.",
        "Jack: I'm really sorry.",
        "Carly: It's all right. The kids were happy, they had fun. The shirt is ruined, potato chips in my hair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I don't want to talk about what happened in Chicago. I thought I made that clear.",
        "Dallas: Look, I understood why it was hard for you to talk to me.",
        "Maddie: Oh, so what, you'd just follow me to Oakdale like a stalker?",
        "Dallas: I didn't follow you.",
        "Maddie: Oh, right, it's just a coincidence that you ended up on this roof. You can forget it. I don't want to talk to you. So you can just forget it, go home. Okay? Go home.",
        "Dallas: Well, I left Chicago. I live here now. And I'm working for the Oakdale PD.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Is this okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Hold it up a little. Just the bottle. He does it mostly himself.",
        "Casey: Man --",
        "Gwen: This could've been us. If things had been different, this would've been our life.",
        "Will: I need to speak to my wife. Alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I still don't understand. How can a healthy young woman with everything to live for -- how can she die from complications of pneumonia? Isn't there something you can do?",
        "Bob: All we can do is keep her comfortable. Her heart failure is not reversible. And her other organs are starting to fail.",
        "Hal: So get her on a transplant list. She can have my liver, my heart -- whatever --",
        "Bob: It's too late. I'm sorry.",
        "Kim: Honey, what happens now?",
        "Bob: Well, Dusty wants Jennifer to stay here at the hospital. I've honored that request. We'll move her to a private room as soon as one's available.",
        "Hal: Bob, how long does she have?",
        "Bob: I don't know. Not long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Will you marry me?",
        "Dusty: Of course I'll marry you. I'm gonna bankrupt your mom and dad in one day. As soon as we get home and make plans.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to wait. I want to marry you now.",
        "Dusty: Don't be scared. Be brave, okay? Remember that doctor I told you about in Texas? They have an experimental treatment --",
        "Jennifer: Is this your way of telling me you don't want to marry me?",
        "Dusty: I want you to get well first.",
        "Jennifer: I want Johnny to know that his parents were married.",
        "Dusty: Of course he's going to know. He's my best man.",
        "Jennifer: Why are you arguing with a sick woman?",
        "Dusty: Because I want you to save all your strength to beat this thing -- to get better.",
        "Jennifer: I have waited so long to be your wife. Please don't fight me on this. Just say that you'll marry me, as soon as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Thanks for helping me out with Johnny.",
        "Casey: Sure, no problem. Hey, Will, I hope everything's okay. And thanks for what you said about Maddie. I'm going to talk to her. Let me know.",
        "Gwen: What's going on? How's Jen?",
        "Will: She's dying.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Will: She's gone into heart failure.",
        "Gwen: I thought she had pneumonia.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's what they thought at first, but now it's turned into something different. I don't have all the details, but Uncle Bob said that she's not going to make it. You don't know what to say, I know. No one does. But I had to come tell you.",
        "Gwen: I don't believe it.",
        "Will: It doesn't make any sense. You know, she's the good one. My mom and Paul and me, we all do these terrible things, and we're all just fine. And Jen, she just got Johnny back, and her and Dusty were gonna get married. It was all happening for her.",
        "Gwen: It's so unfair.",
        "Will: It should've been me. You know, after what I've done, I should be the one in the hospital.",
        "Gwen: No, Will, don't say that.",
        "Will: You don't understand. She's the only one -- she's the only person that's ever been in my life to take care of me. She's dying and there's nothing I can do.",
        "[Both weeping]",
        "Gwen: No, she's not the only one you can count on.",
        "Will: But she's my sister.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I'm sorry it hurts so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You live here now? You quit the Chicago P.D.?",
        "Dallas: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: Well, then you are way out of your jurisdiction. You have no authority to follow me or question me about the -- about anything.",
        "Dallas: You still can't even say the words?",
        "Maddie: The incident, okay?",
        "Dallas: You were sexually assaulted!",
        "Maddie: This conversation is over.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, look -- look, I'm sorry. I just want you to know that I didn't follow you here. I was just as surprised to see you as you were to see me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, like I believe that one.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, I left the city because I was tired of being in Chicago. I wanted to work in a smaller town. My aunt just suggested Oakdale.",
        "Maddie: Oh, and did she also suggest you hide outside my boyfriend's house and ambush me?",
        "Dallas: I was there to see a colleague -- Detective Hughes.",
        "Maddie: You better not plan on telling her about me.",
        "Dallas: I would never --",
        "Maddie: This is not your problem, it never was. And if you mention this to anybody -- anything that happened to me --",
        "Dallas: I don't know what happened, Maddie. You refused to tell me.",
        "Maddie: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, well, I refuse to believe that. Look, I didn't come here looking for you, all right? But when I saw you outside the Hughes' place, it all came back. How you looked the night that I found you. How scared you were. Look, I took you to the hospital, remember? I promised you that I'd find the creep that hurt you. And you promised me that you'd tell me what happened. But then you ran away. You left Chicago, you left the hospital. And you've been running ever since.",
        "Maddie: I'm not running. I'm trying to live my life.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, well, if that were true, you wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. You need to stand up for yourself and put this guy away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Jack: I'm cleaning you up. You're wearing half a picnic.",
        "Carly: I'm going to need a shirt to put on.",
        "Jack: You can borrow one of my t-shirts.",
        "Carly: No, that's okay. You know, my bag is out in the car. If you could get it for me, I have some shirts in there.",
        "Jack: That's all you need?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Jack, just a shirt. That's it.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, is anybody out there? We need some help in here!",
        "Vienna: I don't think anyone cares.",
        "Mike: Hey, just a little help! The door's jammed!",
        "Vienna: No one can hear you. And it seems like Simon and Katie have deserted us, so we might as well just make the best of it.",
        "Mike: How do you suggest we do that?",
        "Vienna: Why don't we start by making a deal? Lucky for you, I've got a lot of money. Name your price.",
        "Mike: For what?",
        "Vienna: Just get me back on to dry land. You can have anything you want. [Vienna screams] Or we could just ride it out right here.",
        "Mike: Okay, get off me.",
        "Vienna: I don't think you understand. I don't do water, unless it's very hot and very shallow.",
        "Mike: That's not my problem.",
        "Vienna: Well, I didn't make the rain. I don't even like rain. I'm a sun person, okay? Wait! I can't swim!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Katie. Katie.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Simon: Sing us a song.",
        "Katie: Sing you a song?",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah. It'll cheer us both up. Sing a song.",
        "Katie: The only thing that would cheer me up is that boat coming back and getting me and leaving you here.",
        "Simon: Well, that's not very nice. After all, who jumped in and saved you. Me. Husband number one.",
        "Katie: You are not husband number one.",
        "Simon: Well, that's good. Good. Keep yelling at me. You're getting some color back in your cheeks. And you're nice and energized so we can get the hell out of here.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and how are we going to do that?",
        "Simon: We swim to the nearest island. I know where -- due west -- yes, an island.",
        "Katie: Oh, another island! Please, we have both had our share of islands. I'm not going to another island with you.",
        "Simon: Really? I'm just gonna have to leave you here with the sharks, huh? That's too bad, because you have such pretty legs. Ow!",
        "Katie: I really hate you!",
        "Simon: So what's it going to be, Kate?",
        "Katie: Don't call me that.",
        "Simon: God, you're so irritable when you're wet.",
        "Katie: I'm not irritable, I'm scared.",
        "Simon: I'm not going to let anything happen to you, I promise.",
        "Katie: The only way I'm going to get back alive and well is if I stay right where the boat can find me. I'm sure the coast guard's been called by now. There's gonna be helicopters overhead any minute. And I'm going to be right here waiting.",
        "Simon: As you've pointed out before, it's the middle of the night, the middle of the storm in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. It could take hours before they realize we're gone. And then they're going to have to mobilize, retrace their route and then hope that we haven't been eaten, drowned or blown so far off course they'll never find us.",
        "Katie: We're going to die.",
        "Simon: No.",
        "Katie: I'm never going to see Mike again.",
        "Simon: We are not going to die if you'd just start kicking those pretty little legs of yours, all right? Now stop whining and start kicking. It's Mike or the sharks, babe. It's up to you. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Don't try and make this is about me, okay? You're just trying to catch a bad guy so you can get a promotion. This isn't your case anymore.",
        "Dallas: This isn't about the case, Maddie. This is about you. Look, I'd only been a cop a couple of months a couple of months when I found you that night. And okay, yeah, maybe I got a little too involved. But your face -- I'll never forget. And I'm not going to let you ruin your life.",
        "Maddie: Ruin my life? I'm happy. I left Chicago, for your information, to be with my brother. I go to a great private school. I get straight as every semester. I have lots of friends, a terrific boyfriend --",
        "Dallas: Yeah, well, does he know about what happened to you?",
        "Maddie: No. Why should he?",
        "Dallas: Well, you see, in my experience, it's kind of hard to get close to people when you're keeping secrets from them.",
        "Maddie: You think you know me? You just know that something bad happened to me once. That doesn't give you the right to tell me how to live my life.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, look, I know how hard it is to stand up to someone who scares you. But that creep? Whatever he did to you, he took something from you, Maddie. He took your innocence, your ability to trust people. Now, are you just going to let him get away with that?",
        "Maddie: Get out of my way.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, please --",
        "Maddie: Let go of me!",
        "Casey: Hey, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: When you get better, then we can have any kind of wedding you want.",
        "Jennifer: I want a simple ceremony. Just you and me. Our closest friends and our family. And I want it as soon as possible.",
        "Dusty: Jenny --",
        "Jennifer: Please? Before we run out of time.",
        "Dusty: We're not running out of time.",
        "Jennifer: Honey, I don't know why this is happening, but we have to accept it and try to make something good come out of it.",
        "Dusty: Of course. I'm never giving up on you, Red.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want you to give up on me ever. But that means that we have to be honest, no matter how much it hurts. Because if we don't get the chance to say all the things that we want to say --",
        "Dusty: You want me to be honest, Red? Don't be negative. Because that invites trouble. We get you well and we go home. We get you well and we go home, Red. That's the plan.",
        "Jennifer: What about what I want? You don't want to talk about the future, okay. So what about right now? 'Cause right now, I want to be your wife.",
        "Dusty: Jenny --",
        "Jennifer: Please. Are you going to argue with me till it's too late? You said yourself you can't win this one. Make me happy.",
        "Dusty: If getting married right now makes you happy, let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Casey: You deserve the best.",
        "Maddie: No, I don't, Casey. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not.",
        "Katie: Wait, Simon! Hey!",
        "Jennifer: Promise me that you will always be in his life.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What, is this a cop thing?",
        "Maddie: No, of course not.",
        "Dallas: I'm sorry I upset you, Maddie. I won't let it happen again.",
        "Casey: What was all that?",
        "Maddie: Nothing.",
        "Casey: Maddie, come on, I find you toe to toe with a cop up here? And look at you, you're upset. So, are you in trouble?",
        "Maddie: No, of course not.",
        "Casey: Then what was he grilling you about?",
        "Maddie: He wasn't grilling me.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I heard you yell at the guy.",
        "Maddie: We were just talking, okay?",
        "Casey: About what?",
        "Maddie: It's not important.",
        "Casey: Earlier, you told me you didn't even know the guy. Obviously, that's not true. So something's going on and I want to know what it is.",
        "Maddie: This is none of your business, okay? You're not my boyfriend anymore, remember? We broke up.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You found the bag.",
        "Jack: Yes, I did.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Well, thanks. I can take it from here.",
        "Jack: Right. I should probably check on the kids anyway.",
        "Carly: Oh, damn. This necklace is caught on something.",
        "Jessica: Just when I was about to lose hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You really mean it? You'll marry me now?",
        "Dusty: You know I will.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: I gotta go get a preacher.",
        "Jennifer: And my family. I want them there.",
        "Dusty: Of course. Of course.",
        "Hal: Sorry, I'll come back.",
        "Jennifer: No, Daddy. Come in. I want to talk to you. You have work to do.",
        "Dusty: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Hal: How's my beautiful girl?",
        "Jennifer: Happy. Daddy, we're getting married.",
        "Hal: Oh, Sweetheart. That's wonderful.",
        "Gwen: He wanted to see his mom.",
        "Dusty: And she wants to see him. Your mom and I are getting married.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: If that's okay with you, Bob.",
        "Bob: It's fine. I'll talk to the staff and get things set up.",
        "Kim: Maybe the hospital chaplain --",
        "Dusty: She wants everyone there -- the whole family.",
        "Barbara: Let me do something, okay? Let me get some flowers, a dress for her.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Kim: This is a wonderful idea. So positive and hopeful. You know, I would do anything in the world for you. Is there anything you need or want?",
        "Dusty: Not much. Just us -- the family.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I know. It's just impossible to accept this, isn't it? For somebody so young and vibrant. Somebody we all love so much to have -- to lose her without any warning.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey. Hey, look at me. We're not losing her. We're not losing her. She's going to beat it. I know she is.",
        "Jennifer: Have I told you lately that you're a wonderful father and man?",
        "Hal: Oh, it was all you. You're just so easy to love.",
        "Jennifer: Not always. But you accepted me as your own anyway, even though I wasn't.",
        "Hal: Details.",
        "Jennifer: Will you give me away?",
        "Hal: I would be honored.",

        "Jennifer: Thank you so much.",
        "Will: It was Gwen's idea.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, Will snuck him in. But Dr. Bob said it was okay.",
        "Jennifer: You know, he's always reminded me of you.",
        "Gwen: See? I'm always telling him that.",
        "Jennifer: It's not so much that you look alike.",
        "Gwen: It's the expressions.",
        "Jennifer: Exactly. And his sweetness. He's so lucky to have you as his uncle.",
        "Jennifer: Will, could you get me some water?",
        "Will: Sure.",
        "Jennifer: How's he doing?",
        "Gwen: Not good. But he'll be okay.",
        "Jennifer: Of course he will. He's got you. You've been such a blessing, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Jennifer: Yes. You're such a wonderful woman, and I really love you and I'm so proud that you're my sister-in-law.",
        "Gwen: Come on, you're going to make me cry.",
        "Jennifer: That's okay. Will you do something for me?",
        "Gwen: Anything.",
        "Jennifer: Will you be my matron of honor? Dusty and I are getting married.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he said. You sure you want me?",
        "Jennifer: You're part of the family. And I do love you. And I would love to have you by my side. If you're willing.",
        "Gwen: Of course.",
        "Jennifer: There's one more favor, and this is a biggie.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: I know how much you love Johnny.",
        "Gwen: That's a forever thing.",
        "Jennifer: Good. Because I want you to promise me that you'll watch over him for me. Please. Promise me that you will always be in his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, none of this makes any sense, all right? I know something's wrong, but you're shutting me out.",
        "Maddie: Fine, I'm shutting you out, all right? Isn't that how it's supposed to work when you break up? You move on.",
        "Casey: If I did this to you? Refused to talk to you about what's wrong? Just told you that it was over, to leave me alone? Do you have any idea what this feels like?",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I'm just -- I can't fix it. And I'm too messed up -- too messed up to worry about anyone but myself right now, Casey.",
        "Casey: No. I don't buy it. I've never seen you quit on anything. You'll work a problem till you solve it.",
        "Maddie: I can't solve this.",
        "Casey: Solve what? What's got you so tied up? Maddie, don't you know by now you can tell me anything?",
        "Maddie: You're just making it harder.",
        "Casey: No, I'm not. I'm trying to keep you from throwing something away that we both want.",
        "Maddie: Wanting something and being able to have it are two different things.",
        "Casey: There's nothing you can't have. Maddie, you deserve the best.",

        "Carly: So anyway, how are you?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I can't complain. Actually, my nephew is staying with me, which is why I came over here. Jack, I was wondering if you had met him yet. Dallas Griffin? He was with Chicago P.D. and Hal just hired him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Hal mentioned something, right.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, I was just wondering if maybe you'd, you know, take him under your wing. He's a great kid. Kid -- he's a grown man. But he is my nephew and I'd appreciate it if you would just look out for him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, of course. You got it.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I'm just going to jump in here. Has something changed? I mean, relative to your marital status? Because the paperwork's in place, but I won't file it if you two are back together.",

        "Captain: I don't mean to pry, but if you and your wife had a fight --",
        "Mike: No, no, no, we didn't have a fight at all. We're on our honeymoon. She wasn't feeling well, so she went up on the deck to get some air.",

        "Simon: Katie, have you ever known me to get in a car without looking at a map? Or on a boat without looking at the charts? I know we head due west --",

        "Maddie: That's only because i didn't have enough drawer space, that's not the point. The point is we're over. And you don't have to worry about me any more, okay?",
