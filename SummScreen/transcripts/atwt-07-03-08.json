        "Henry once again asks Mike to help him persuade Carly to sell him part of Metro but Mile's plea for Henry doesn't persuade Carly to sell part of Metro to Henry. Henry and Vienna celebrate the Fourth of July by making love in the diner dressed as George and Martha Washington. Lily invites Carly to a BBQ with her and Holden. Carly turns down the offer but later decides to bring Mike with her to Holden and Lily's house. Holden tells Lily that he is going to get milk, but he drives to Carly's house and admits to Carly that he was jealous of Mike. Carly admits to Holden that she has feelings for him but its best that they not act on them again. Holden and Carly almost kiss but they are interrupted by a call from Lilly asking him to bring home eggs and blueberry muffin mix so they can have breakfast in bed tomorrow. Cyndi Lauper sings at a gay pride benefit at Yo's, and Noah realizes that Luke is the only person he could love. Luke is thrilled and Luke and Noah kiss and make up. Luke's happiness is short lived when Noah tells him that he has enlisted in the army and he is leaving for Chicago tomorrow to do the final paperwork.

        "Luke: Um, hi, excuse me.",
        "Cyndi: Hey.",
        "Luke: Cyndi, I am a huge fan. Obviously.",
        "Cyndi: Don't be silly. You're not that big. Just kidding.",
        "Luke: Thank you, yes. Well, actually, I'm here to interview you for the Oakdale U. newspaper arts section. Oakdale U. -- Happening Now.",
        "Cyndi: It's all good. I love publicity. I'll do it.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, that's good. So --",
        "Cyndi: I never turn down a cute face.",
        "Luke: Well!",
        "Cyndi: There you go.",
        "Luke: That is a rule to live by. Should we get started?",
        "Cyndi: Thank you --",
        "Luke: Oh, hi, I'm Luke Snyder, by the way.",
        "Cyndi: I'm Cyndi.",
        "Luke: I know, I know. Well, yes, let's step into your office, my office.",
        "Cyndi: My office, your office. It's all good.",
        "Luke: Our office. Okay.",
        "Cyndi: Such a gentleman. Luciano. Well, you know, I just figured you were Italian, so --",
        "Luke: No, that is my real name.",
        "Cyndi: I saw it in your eyes. Wow. Psychic, too. There you go.",
        "Luke: You saw that all in my eyes?",
        "Cyndi: A lot of passion.",
        "Luke: Uh, okay. Um, well, let's get started. Hello.",
        "Cyndi: Test, test, test.",
        "Luke: Test. All right. I'm here with Cyndi Lauper, and you're here on your True Colors 2008 tour promoting your new album, \"Bring Ya to the Brink.\"",
        "Cyndi: Mm-hmm.",
        "Luke: So.",
        "Cyndi: How's it going? Yeah, it's going fast and furious. Don't be silly. Run right out now and go buy a CD.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Cyndi: Or a ticket.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Cyndi: It's a once in a lifetime chance. Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Luke: Okay, all right. So, your tour, your True Colors tour. You have been all over the place. You've been in Radio City Music Hall in New York. You've been in L.A., Toronto, Chicago. Now, I have to ask you -- doesn't Oakdale seem a little small-town to you?",
        "Cyndi: When it comes to gay rights, the small towns are the big ones, because in small towns, you have less rights because you're isolated. And it's just, it's harder, so it's much better to always remember to go to the small towns. Big towns, it's more urban. People live differently, you know.",
        "Luke: And, I guess, you know, there are gay people everywhere.",
        "Cyndi: Yes.",
        "Luke: I guess I'm proof of that.",
        "Cyndi: Yeah. You got a boyfriend? You got a story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Hey, Noah, right?",
        "Noah: Yeah, how'd you know? Oh, duh, the name tag, right.",
        "Tony: Actually, we met last winter. You and Luke were gonna come to the house party. We missed you in the hot tub.",
        "Noah: Right. Sorry, I zoned out. Yeah. What can I get you?",
        "Tony: Double espresso to go. I need some emergency caffeine.",
        "Noah: Yeah, I know how you feel. It's been a long day for me, too, and you are my last customer.",
        "Tony: Ah, well, good timing. So, how's it going?",
        "Noah: You know, hanging in there.",
        "Tony: Just trying to keep myself in circulation. I guess you probably heard, but I broke up with Reg. He was in it for the long haul, and I'm just not ready for that, yet. He needs to find someone to get really serious about.",
        "Noah: Maybe he will.",
        "Tony: So, I'm adjusting to the single life. Trying to keep busy. Like tonight -- there's a benefit at Yo's and Cyndi Lauper's singing. I was gonna check it out. You?",
        "Noah: Oh, I'm not really big on going to bars, so --",
        "Tony: Oh, me neither, Dude. Why don't we go together? It'll be fun.",
        "Noah: Um, yeah, sure. Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Mikey, what's up?",
        "Mike: Hey, Henry. The roast beef was great. Can I get a scoop of fudge walnut ice cream?",
        "Henry: Uh, no. No scoop until you give me the scoop on the Metro deal. Don't keep me in suspense. What'd she say?",
        "Mike: It's not gonna work, Henry.",
        "Henry: Okay. Don't do it for your pal, your best bud. Do it for Vienna, will you? I want to give my lady love the platinum-plated lifestyle she deserves. She thinks slaving away at this diner is the be-all, end-all, and it's not. Metro -- that could be heaven on earth for us, where I could make her disco queen of the night. Now don't let Carly stand in the way of that.",
        "Mike: Does Vienna even want to be disco queen of the night?",
        "Henry: Doesn't everyone? I'm counting on you, Mike. No scoop of fudge for you until you finish the job, okay?",
        "Mike: I'll see what I can do, Henry, but don't get your hopes up. Carly is a force of nature.",
        "Henry: Wear your tool belt. Women love that.",
        "Mike: Yeah, right. Hey, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Hey, Mike. Ta-ta.",
        "Henry: How's my little sexy Swedish dumpling?",
        "Vienna: I'm not Swedish today. I'm as American as an apple pie. And I brought some Fourth of July fireworks for you.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I didn't realize I had so much stuff.",
        "Lily: It is so wonderful to have you home. When everybody's setting off fireworks tonight, I'm gonna pretend they're just for us. We have a lot to celebrate.",
        "Holden: That's true. That's true, we do. Looks like it's gonna be just the two of us. With the girls at camp and Luke at the benefit.",
        "Lily: I know, I love Cyndi Lauper, and I want to go!",
        "Holden: No, no, he wouldn't have wanted us there.",
        "Lily: Okay. Girls just wanna have fun.",
        "Holden: I know. The girls, they love that song. I wonder what they're doing for the fourth.",
        "Lily: I bet the camp's having a big party. Why don't we have a party here? Why don't we invite people over for a cookout?",
        "Holden: Okay, who should we invite?",
        "Lily: Let's start with Carly. Hey, Carly, it's me, Lily. Listen, I know it's kind of last-minute, but can you come over for a barbecue tonight? Holden just moved back in, and we're celebrating. Please say you'll come.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's very sweet of you, Lily, but I don't know.",
        "Lily: Oh, it won't be any fun without you. Right, Holden?",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Carly: You know what, actually, I just can't.",
        "Lily: Why not? Metro's closed tonight, isn't it?",
        "Carly: Yes. But Jack and Parker are here.",
        "Lily: That's okay. Bring them, too. The more, the merrier.",
        "Carly: Well, actually Jack's already fired up the grill, and we're gonna have some hot dogs and hamburgers. I guess it's just bad timing, huh?",
        "Lily: That's too bad.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe it's good that you're alone with Holden. You can celebrate being back together.",
        "Lily: We will certainly do that. See you soon. Happy fourth. Holden sends his love.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, it is so cool that you're doing this concert tonight for O.U.'s Pride Week. You've been always a very strong supporter of gay rights, right?",
        "Cyndi: Yes, and friends and family of. I never can figure out why people act the way they act. When you love each other, you love each other. You know? But hey, what are you gonna do? That's why you do this.",
        "Luke: Yeah, that sounds great. And you've been selling tickets at record numbers. You were just in L.A. and Seattle, right?",
        "Cyndi: That's right. And we're going to Red Rocks.",
        "Luke: Oh, wow.",
        "Cyndi: Red Rocks! Remember that U2 video? Red Rocks! I love Red Rocks. I always wanted to play there. I played there last year. And I'm gonna play there again this year. You know that guy?",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, the tall one. He used to be my boyfriend. But that is so over.",
        "Cyndi: Really? Don't seem over to me.",
        "Luke: Well, doesn't look like Noah's having much trouble moving on.",
        "Cyndi: Don't sell yourself so short, Doll. If he really cares, it won't be so easy for him to forget his Luciano.",
        "Manager: Cyndi, ready to start whenever you are.",
        "Cyndi: I'm coming. Gonna be okay?",
        "Luke: Yes. And thank you so much for everything.",
        "Cyndi: I'm dedicating this show to Luke and Noah, 'cause you know you're gonna be back together, and I know. I'm psychic. I can feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ethan's asleep already, so it's just the two of us.",
        "Holden: What happened with Carly?",
        "Lily: Well, Jack and Parker are there, and they're having their own cookout.",
        "Holden: Really? I thought Jack took Parker up to the lake to go fishing.",
        "Lily: Maybe you got it wrong, or maybe they changed their mind.",
        "Holden: Probably.",
        "Lily: Well, she gave me some pretty good advice, anyway.",
        "Holden: Yeah? What was that?",
        "Lily: She said that we should enjoy our alone time. I think we should do exactly what she said. Who needs a party when we have each other?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi, Mike.",
        "Mike: Hey, Carly. I hope I'm not disturbing you.",
        "Carly: No, no. Come on in. I'm not busy at all. Are you limping?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I landed in a gopher hole at the construction site.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: Thanks. So, you have any plans for the holiday weekend? Where are the kids?",
        "Carly: The kids aren't here, so it doesn't really feel like much of a holiday at all.",
        "Mike: I hear you.",
        "Carly: So, is there something I can do?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I need to ask you a favor. Well, it's not for me. It's for Henry.",
        "Carly: Oh. He wants you to talk me into selling him his share of Metro, right?",
        "Mike: How'd you guess?",
        "Carly: He's the original one-track mind.",
        "Mike: Yeah, he's persistent. You got that right.",
        "Carly: It's not gonna work.",
        "Mike: Why not? I mean, he's absolutely convinced that it's gonna make Vienna ecstatically happy. I think it's kind of sweet that he wants to give her the royal treatment, don't you think? Nothing's too good for the love of his life.",
        "Carly: Well, when a man puts a woman up on a pedestal like that, there really is no feeling like it in the world.",
        "Mike: Sounds like a win-win to me. He's offering to do a lot of work for you. He could stay at the club late while you're at home with the kids.",
        "Carly: No, I know. Part of me thinks I'd be crazy not to say yes.",
        "Mike: So what's the problem?",
        "Carly: The kids aren't here and I'm alone and I want to keep busy, even if I'm overextending myself.",
        "Mike: So I take it Henry's answer is no.",
        "Carly: That's right.",
        "Mike: I gave it my best shot.",
        "Carly: Yes, you did.",
        "Mike: And I don't blame you for wanting to keep busy. It's the best thing to do when you want to forget about what you're missing. Well, have a great fourth. Or try to, at least. Take care.",
        "Carly: Mike, wait. Don't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hello, hello. Wow! Hummanah, hummanah, hummanah, hummanah! Martha, Martha, Martha! Wow. You have never looked so fetching.",
        "Vienna: Ooh, you likey?",
        "Henry: Oh, I likey very muchy. You're busting out there a little bit, aren't you? For the parade. If I remember my American history, Martha Washington was a bit more conservative, I think.",
        "Vienna: Yes, I know, but in keeping with the spirit of the holiday, I just took some liberties, and I think it works.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, it works. It works. Why don't we get cozy? What do you say? If you're lucky, I'll let you play with my doodle. I've been told -- I've been told it's a dandy. Come here. I love that laugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, Mike, what do you have planned tonight? You have anything scheduled for the holiday?",
        "Mike: Not much. I was gonna go down to the construction site, clean things up a bit.",
        "Carly: Sounds as deadly was what I have planned.",
        "Mike: What's that?",
        "Carly: Well, Metro's closed. I thought I'd go down and do the books.",
        "Mike: Now that is pathetic.",
        "Carly: Yes, pathetic. We both are. Maybe we could turn that around.",
        "Mike: What'd you have in mind?",
        "Carly: Maybe we could hang out.",
        "Mike: You and me?",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Mike: Well, we tried that once and it didn't work out too well, if you recall.",
        "Carly: Right. Well, I'm not interested in repeating past mistakes. I'm busy making new ones. I just need to get out of a little rut. It's Independence Day, and while I love being independent, I don't want to be alone right now.",
        "Mike: Okay, well, what do you want to do?",
        "Carly: I got invited to a cookout. Would you like to come with?",
        "Mike: Sure, I'm there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Carly: Is it too late to change my mind about coming over for that barbecue?",
        "Lily: No, no. We're just getting started.",
        "Carly: Can I bring someone along?",
        "Lily: Yeah. You mean Jack?",
        "Carly: No, not Jack. He's not here. Actually, I lied about that.",
        "Lily: Jack and Parker are on a fishing trip, aren't they?",
        "Carly: How did you know?",
        "Lily: Holden told me.",
        "Carly: Well, when you called earlier I guess I was feeling sorry for myself. I didn't want you to know that I was alone.",
        "Lily: Carly, you don't have to be alone. You should be with friends.",
        "Carly: That's what I figured.",
        "Lily: So what's up? You found someone to bring with you?",
        "Carly: It just sort of worked out that way. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Lily: No, no, bring him. It's a guy, right?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Lily: Is he handsome?",
        "Carly: Very.",
        "Lily: Ooh, who is it?",
        "Carly: I'll surprise you.",
        "Lily: Well, then come on over here.",
        "Carly: Can we bring anything?",
        "Lily: No. Just yourselves and hurry. Looks like you'll be grilling more steaks.",
        "Holden: Why, what's going on?",
        "Lily: Carly's coming, and she's bringing a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Hey, Oakdale! [Cheers and applause] Are you guys ready for Cyndi to bring ya to the brink? [Cheers and applause] All right! Well, then put your hands together for Cyndi Lauper!",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Cyndi: Hey! Come on! [Cheers and applause] Yeah! Come on, you rock! Thank you. Thank you for supporting the cause tonight and end some discrimination here through some partying and some music. Thank you.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Noah: Do you want to get out of here and go someplace else?",
        "Tony: Yeah, sure.",
        "[Applause continues]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, are you absolutely sure that Carly's bringing a date?",
        "Lily: She is a big girl. She can take care of herself. She's got this under control.",
        "Holden: I doubt it.",
        "Lily: I think that this explains a lot, because you know what, she's been acting weird around me lately. And quite honestly, I thought that she was maybe even trying to hide something. But it's that she's got this new boyfriend and she wasn't ready to tell me about it, and now she is.",
        "Holden: No, no, you're way off.",
        "Lily: Well, what do you think's going on with her.",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Lily: Hey, we're out here. Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Lily: How are you? Where's the boyfriend?",
        "Carly: Inside.",
        "Lily: So you're the mystery man, huh? Carly had us thinking she had a new beau.",
        "Mike: Well, if she does, it's not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Do you want to tell me what the hell you think you're doing?",
        "Carly: I'm trying to act like nothing happened between us. Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?",
        "Holden: There is such a thing as trying too hard.",
        "Lily: Look who Carly brought as her date.",
        "Holden: Mike, how are you?",
        "Mike: Great.",
        "Lily: She really had us going there. We thought that you were her new boyfriend.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, that privilege is going to have to be reserved for some other lucky guy. Can I give you a hand with anything, Holden?",
        "Holden: No, no, I'm okay. I was just about to put the steaks on the grill.",
        "Lily: Carly, can you help me with the drinks? Mike, grab you a beer?",
        "Mike: Great.",
        "Holden: So, you and Carly are, what, just hanging out as friends?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah. That's Jack's territory. I'm not gonna go there.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're not kidding about that.",
        "Lily: So, you and Mike. Is this a romantic stroll down memory lane, or what?",
        "Carly: No, no. Romance has nothing to do with it. I'm really -- I'm not interested in that. Too much has been going on lately.",
        "Lily: With you and Jack?",
        "Carly: Jack's out of the picture.",
        "Lily: Carly, I hate to see you alone.",
        "Carly: I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.",
        "Lily: I don't know. You seem out of sorts lately.",
        "Carly: Can you blame me?",
        "Holden: Hey, where are those beers?",
        "Lily: Here you go. Mike.",
        "Holden: Thanks.",
        "Carly: You're welcome.",
        "Lily: This deserves a toast. Welcome home, Sweetie. Happy fourth. To new beginnings. To all of us.",
        "Mike: Cheers.",
        "Holden: Cheers.",
        "Carly: Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I think we crossed the Delaware. How long can we keep the diner closed?",
        "Vienna: As long as you want.",
        "Henry: Really? Then we have time for another historic re-enactment, I think.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I can't believe you chopped down that cherry tree, George.",
        "Henry: Oh, don't worry, Martha. It'll come back. I cannot tell a lie. We'll have plenty of firewood for those long winter nights. Tall-ho, Mrs. Washington. Let us form a more perfect union. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cyndi: Hey. I'm sending a shout-out to my new friend, my new best friend, Luke. This one's for you, Man. Hit it.",

        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Noah: We need to talk.",
        "Luke: So, what happened to Tony?",
        "Noah: I don't care. I didn't want to be with him. The only one I want to be with is you.",
        "Luke: What made you change your mind?",
        "Noah: You were right all along, Luke. We do belong together. I'm sorry things got so messed up. All I want is this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Thanks again for inviting me today.",
        "Carly: Oh, Mike, I'm so glad you were able to come.",
        "Mike: Anytime.",
        "Carly: Well, um, you know what, I think I should go. I've been staying up so late at night working, and Metro's closed. I should take some advantage of it and get some sleep.",
        "Lily: You're gonna go so soon?",
        "Carly: I think I should.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I've been getting up at sunrise, too. I should probably hit the hay. I'll drive you home, Carly.",
        "Carly: Thank you so much. Thank you both again.",
        "Lily: Yes, thank you for coming. See you soon?",
        "Mike: You got it.",
        "Lily: Bye.",

        "Lily: Yeah, happy fourth.",
        "Holden: Bye-bye.",
        "Lily: Bye. You think they had a good time?",
        "Holden: I think so.",
        "Lily: Yeah? Carly didn't really seem herself.",
        "Holden: She seemed fine to me.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe hanging out with Mike will be good for her. As soon as I get these in the dishwasher, we can concentrate on more important things. Like more of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Cyndi: See? What'd I tell you? Never give up on love.",
        "Luke: No, and you were right. Cyndi Lauper, I'd like you to meet the love of my life, Noah Mayer.",
        "Cyndi: How do you do?",
        "Noah: Hi. It was really great hearing you sing. You were awesome.",
        "Luke: And you know what, don't take it personally that he ran out on you.",
        "Noah: But seriously, you were awesome.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and \"True Colors,\" it's totally our song now.",
        "Cyndi: Oh, see, I did my job. Well, good luck to both of you. Enjoy life and love. And be proud. And I'll see you around there, Cutie.",
        "Luke: Thank you. I can't believe that this is happening!",
        "Noah: That I just met Cyndi Lauper?",
        "Luke: Well, yeah, no. Yes. That's awesome, too, but I guess I was talking about us. You know, like, can you believe it? How long have we waited for this moment, and it's finally here. And this might be a first, but no one's staying at the farm tonight. I want you to come home with me.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry, Luke. We can't.",
        "Luke: Why not? I just said that no one's staying at the farm tonight.",
        "Noah: Well, that's not the problem.",
        "Luke: Then what is? Don't you want to be with me?",
        "Noah: More than anything, I do. It's just -- I can't. It's late. I have to go.",
        "Luke: Go where?",
        "Noah: I enlisted. In the army.",

        "Lily: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: I, uh, just noticed that we were out of milk, so I thought I'd run out and get some for tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Well, can't you get it in the morning?",
        "Holden: Well, I'm still dressed, so I figured I might as well do it. I'll be right back.",

        "Carly: Why are you here, Holden?",
        "Holden: I told you that I was headed to the store, but somehow ended up here. I shouldn't have come here, but I --",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Holden: I wanted to see if Mike's car was still here.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Holden: This is stupid. This is so stupid. Okay, and I shouldn't be feeling this. But I was a little jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Do you really think it's the right thing? 'Cause your father was always trying to pressure you to join, and you were always like, \"That's the last thing I want to do.\"",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, I changed my mind.",
        "Luke: Noah, this doesn't make any sense. If you're trying to make your father proud of you after the fact --",
        "Noah: Maybe I'm trying to make myself feel proud.",
        "Luke: No. No, you're not. This is about your father. And, Noah, I'm sorry, but he's dead. You don't have to keep proving yourself to him.",
        "Noah: Okay, it's not like that. I can see more clearly now that growing up the way I did, around the military my whole life, I understand why it was an appealing life for my father. And I understand why it could be a good thing for me, too. I mean, it answers a lot of questions. I'm feeling pretty lost and confused right now. And I would like to be in a place where there was, I don't know, a clear set of rules. Where I knew what was expected of me, where I felt secure.",
        "Luke: Why can't you feel that way with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: There's no reason to be jealous about Mike. He's just a friend.",
        "Holden: I know that. But the truth is, when you showed up with him at the house, it got to me.",
        "Carly: Holden, I couldn't have feelings for Mike. Not when I have -- not when I have feelings for you.",
        "Holden: You know, it feels so strange being in this house. Almost like I shouldn't be here when Jack's not here. It's Jack's house.",
        "Carly: It's not Jack's house. It's mine. But it does feel weird. Like our boundaries are all mixed up and we have to get them back before we get into trouble. Maybe that's why I brought Mike to the cookout tonight, to try to find those boundaries.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I got the message.",
        "Carly: But it didn't work, did it? You came here anyway.",

        "Noah: Luke, I'm sorry. Okay, I know all this is hurting you right now, but this isn't just about us. I need to feel like I'm doing something good with my life, and right now, that means serving my country.",
        "Luke: I respect that you feel that way. I do. But I think there's other ways to serve without cutting yourself off from the person you love most in the world. Noah, we could do something together. We could build houses for families that need homes. We could work in a soup kitchen. We could feed the hungry. There's other ways to help people besides joining the army.",
        "Noah: I know. But this is the way I need to do it.",
        "Luke: You're not your father. And, honestly, I don't think you're cut out for the army.",
        "Noah: You know, Sergeant Davis, my recruiter, thinks I'd make a fine soldier.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah? Did you tell Officer Davis that you're gay?",
        "Noah: I didn't have to. There's no reason to get into that.",
        "Luke: So, you're willing to serve, and you're willing to possibly sacrifice your life, without being allowed to be who you honestly are?",
        "Noah: I know who I am. That's enough.",
        "Luke: Noah, please, this is a really, really, really big decision. Can't you give this more time? Think about it a little --",
        "Noah: It's too late. I already signed the preliminary papers. I'm heading out to the processing station in Chicago tomorrow.",
        "Luke: I can't believe this. We can finally be together, after everything we've been through, after all the crap we were dealt, and you're leaving me.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry, Luke. I have to. Just try and understand.",
