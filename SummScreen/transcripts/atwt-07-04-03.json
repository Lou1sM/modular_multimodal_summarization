        "Carly told Jack that Sage was his. While they celebrated, Katie tried to keep the information from Mike, to no avail. Molly saw that Mike was upset, and accused Katie of hurting him. Katie admitted the true reason for Mike's pain. Mike congratulated Jack and Carly. Jack told Mike he would always be welcome, and Mike made Jack promise to take good care of Sage. Molly did her best to comfort a grieving Mike, while Katie looked on. Dusty and Holden made contact with Lily, and eventually tracked her down. While Holden went down the well after Lily, Margo called Dusty, informing him of \"Brackett's\" escape. Dusty found the badge from \"Brackett's\" stolen uniform on the ground by the well. At the lodge, he found Rose, tied up so that one wrong move would hang her. As Dusty entered to save her, \"Brackett\" put a gun to the back of his head. Sarah called Bonnie, promising that she would apologize to Dr. Daniels for stealing his PDA. At Memorial, Sarah did just that, but Walker thought she was feverish and asked to examine her. Bonnie and Isaac arrived, then saw Sarah nearly faint. They thought it was an act, but Walker thought otherwise."

        "Jack: I'm sorry. Did you just say that this baby looks like her father?",
        "Carly: I did.",
        "Jack: Does that mean you --?",
        "Carly: Yes. I got word right before the wedding.",
        "Jack: From the doctor? He got the tests back?",
        "Carly: The papers are in the cabin, Jack. The chances were so slim I was afraid to hope. And then right before the ceremony, there was a rainbow.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I saw it too.",
        "Carly: And so I thought, \"maybe we might get lucky.\" And then the papers arrived. An there's no doubt about it anymore, Jack. This little girl is your daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: C'mon! The stars are shining tonight. Come outside before it clouds up.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'll be right out. Find some constellations for me to see.",
        "Mike: That's what I've been wanting to do. I want you to tell me what you've got behind your back?",
        "Katie: Oh, this? No, it's nothing.",
        "Mike: Then let me see it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'm pretty sure we found where the hunting lodge is. It's where Steinbeck used to take Paul when he was a kid. It's on Route 9, just off of Hart junction.",
        "Holden: Good work, Margo. We're on our way. The lodge is on Route 9, past Hart junction. You remember how to get there?",
        "Dusty: Yep. We pick up 9 straight ahead. We're close right now. See if you can get them on your walkie-talkie.",
        "Holden: Lily? Rose? It's Holden. Can you hear me? I think we're pretty close to where you're being held.",
        "Lily: Hello? Holden?",
        "Holden: Lily, is that you? Please answer me.",
        "Lily: Yes. Yes, it's me.",
        "Holden: Did you hear that? She's alive! It's Lily. She's alive. Lily? Lily, can you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, it's just off of Hart junction. Can you get a search team for me out there right away? Yeah, a couple of birds in the air would be great. Yeah, I'm on my way as soon as we hang up. I've got another call. Yeah, keep me posted. Hughes.",
        "Cop: Bad news about your prisoner.",
        "Margo: Brackett? What happened?",
        "Cop: He escaped. And we don't know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, Holden, I prayed so hard, I knew that you would come. How are the kids?",
        "Holden: They're fine. We're all fine. Just tell me exactly where you are?",
        "Lily: I'm in a well. That's all I know.",
        "Holden: It's okay. I think we have a pretty good idea of where you are. And now that the walkie-talkie's picked you up, I know that we're close. We'll be there. We'll be there in a very short amount of time.",
        "Dusty: Ask if Rose is with her.",
        "Holden: Lily? Is Rose with you?",
        "Lily: No. No, she managed to climb out to get help. I was afraid she was going to hurt herself, but she's okay. She's safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rose screaming]",
        "Brackett: Stop fighting me, Rose, or I'll kill you and your sister right now. Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Excuse me? Can you tell me where I would drop off a certification of completion?",
        "Cop: A what?",
        "Bonnie: For my community service. I was given 100 hours to work at the Durgin shelter and I need to drop this off.",
        "Cop: We're in the middle of a crisis now, ma'am. Just leave it on the desk.",
        "Bonnie: I wonder what's going on.",
        "Isaac: Who cares? You're done with your community service, let's go celebrate like we planned.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. Okay, what are we doing again?",
        "Isaac: We're meeting your mother and Ben at the hospital. Then the four of us are going to that new Thai place on Douglas. And for the record, this is the fourth time I've had to tell you that.",
        "Bonnie: Right.",
        "Isaac: Right.",
        "Bonnie: Right. Okay, okay, I'm with that. Let's just get the show on the road.",
        "Isaac: Hang on a minute. Now, I can see that you're not into this. And I think I know why.",
        "Bonnie: Come on, honey, you know how I feel about Thai food.",
        "Isaac: I also know how you feel about Sarah. Now, you told me you were gonna cut her loose, but I don't think you've done that.",
        "Bonnie: Well, it's hard for me, Isaac. I mean, now that I'm not actually working at the shelter anymore, I may never see her again.",
        "Isaac: Forget about her, Bonnie. Now, you let someone like that into your life, and all she's gonna do is cause you more trouble.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bonnie: That's me. Hello?",
        "Sarah: It's Sarah. Please -- please don't hang up. I really need to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rose screaming]",
        "Brackett: Let's go. We're gonna take a walk to that lodge. We have unfinished business there, Rose. And then I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna take real good care of your sister. Don't ... Rose, come on, you're coming with me.",
        "Lily: Rose? Rose, can you hear me? I don't know, I don't know. She's not -- she's not around anymore. She must have gone to get help. She must be on her way.",
        "Holden: All right, well, we'll look for her on the road. We'll be there in a couple of minutes, okay?",
        "Lily: I can't wait to see you.",
        "Holden: Lily, are you all right? You sound very weak.",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Lily: I love you, Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily. Lily, what did you say? I couldn't hear you. Lily? Lily?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Can I hold her?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: Oh, oh, so Sage, did you hear the news? I'm your daddy. No doubt about it.",
        "Carly: You always were, Jack. That's why I knew I could marry you even before getting that report.",
        "Jack: I made the commitment for us to be a family -- you, me, Parker and Sage. And I loved her, Carly. When I first heard she was on her way. Oh, but now that I know she's mine, I don't think I've ever been happier. You know that?",
        "Carly: Me neither. What do you do when all your dreams come true at once?",
        "Jack: Sage, I am gonna be the best daddy ever. I am. Not perfect though. No, nobody gets to be that. But if there is anything you need, I will try to get it for you. And if there is a place that you want to see, I'll do my best to get us there. [Sage burps] Oh, there you go. I will -- I will always be there to catch you when you fall. Oh, she probably thinks I'm absolutely nuts.",
        "Carly: No, she's as happy as we are.",
        "Jack: Look at her, Carly. Look at her. She's perfect, isn't she? Everything is perfect. What, you don't think so?",
        "Carly: I do -- except for one thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's a stupid piece of paper I found on the floor.",
        "Mike: Then when are you reading it?",
        "Katie: It was a mistake. I was setting down the champagne bottles, it fell on the floor, I took a little peek. I shouldn't be showing it to anyone else. It doesn't belong to me.",
        "Mike: Well, who's it belong to? Katie, come on, let's go look at the stars. I've been so psyched to see - Is this from the doctor? Here, let me see that piece of paper. Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Sarah? Are you all right?",
        "Sarah: Well, I'm fine now that I know you're not going to hang up on me.",
        "Bonnie: What makes you think I'd do that?",
        "Sarah: Well, I've called before. And you never called back.",
        "Bonnie: Well, there was a reason for that, Sarah. Now that I'm not working at the shelter anymore, I think it's best that we kept some distance between us.",
        "Sarah: But why, Bonnie? Why can't we hang out the way we did before? Is it because I borrowed that thing from Dr. Daniels?",
        "Bonnie: It's not considered borrowing, Sarah, if you don't ask first. And anyway, you gave it back, and I'm not holding that against you.",
        "Sarah: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to apologize to him personally, just to show how sorry I really am.",
        "Bonnie: That's a very good impulse, Sarah. I'm proud of you.",
        "Sarah: You are? Does that mean I can see you again? !",
        "Bonnie: I'll think about it, okay? Bye. She wants to see me.",
        "Isaac: She's testing you, Bonnie. She just wants to see if she can use you as a mark again.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe, Isaac. Or may be not. Or maybe she's learned her lesson.",
        "Isaac: It doesn't work like that. I know these kids. I used to be one of those kids. You give them a chance, and they'll break your heart every time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Excuse me. Dr. Daniels?",
        "Walker: Yes?",
        "Sarah: Remember me, Sarah?",
        "Walker: Of course I do. So are you here visiting a friend?",
        "Sarah: Well, I came to see you. I wanted to apologize for taking your PDA.",
        "Walker: Oh. Well, that's very nice of you. Thank you.",
        "Sarah: I don't know why I did it. I've never stolen anything in my entire life.",
        "Walker: You know what? We all make mistakes. The important thing, Sarah, is that we learn from them.",
        "Sarah: Oh, I have. I'm so ashamed of myself. I never want to feel this way again.",
        "Walker: Good, well, that'll be up to you. And in the meantime, we can forget this whole thing happened.",
        "Sarah: Really? So you forgive me?",
        "Walker: Completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have to get back --",
        "Sarah: Before you go, could you maybe tell Bonnie McKechnie that I came down here and apologized?",
        "Walker: If I happen to run into her, I'll make sure I mention it",
        "Sarah: Especially, the part about it never happening again?",
        "Walker: I promise.",
        "Sarah: You have no idea what this will mean to me.",
        "Walker: One minute. You're very warm, Sarah. Are you running some kind of temperature?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Here it is. Lily, can you hear me? Lily, it's Holden! I can't see a thing. Lily, are you down there?!",
        "Dusty: Maybe we got the wrong well.",
        "Holden: No, this has to be it. Lily, can you hear me?! Are you all right?! Something must have happened. I have to get down there.",
        "Dusty: Hey, that's not gonna be easy. You know, maybe we should wait for some help.",
        "Holden: Here, tie this to something solid.",
        "Dusty: Slow down. You're not gonna help anyone if you get hurt.",
        "Holden: No, Lily needs help now. I'm not waiting for somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry, Mike. I know you wanted Sage to be --",
        "Mike: Don't, don't.",
        "Katie: Hey, I'm on your side, okay? Please let me help you.",
        "Mike: You can't.",
        "Molly: Hey, is everything okay? Where you went.",
        "Molly: Well, it obviously didn't go very well.",
        "Mike: I just need to be alone right now.",
        "Molly: What did you do to him?",
        "Katie: Who, Mike?",
        "Molly: Don't play games with me, Katie. I just saw him out there, and he could barely talk. Something obviously happened.",
        "Katie: It's none of your business, okay?",
        "Molly: Yes it is. Anything that happens to Mike is my business.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Whatever you were going to say -- does it have to be said now? If it's going to make this moment any less than perfect, I'd rather not hear it.",
        "Carly: We can talk about it later.",
        "Jack: Thanks. she's sleeping. It's about Mike, isn't it?",
        "Carly: He thought the baby was going to be his.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Carly: And he wanted it so badly, and I don't know how I'm going to tell him.",
        "Jack: You don't.",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: Not alone, Carly. We do this together.",
        "Carly: Uh -- I don't think that's such a good idea, Jack.",
        "Jack: Honey, this isn't about gloating. Ok, I feel for Mike. I know what it's like to think a child is yours and then have him ripped from your arms.",
        "Carly: I know that your heart is in the right place, sweetie. But you and Mike have been at odds for months. I think that you telling him would just make things worse for him.",
        "Jack: No, things between Mike and me, they have been so much easier lately. I've even started to think that we can get back to being friends. But even if that weren't the case, I wouldn't let you do this all by yourself.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Jack: It's your wedding day, honey. I'm not letting you do anything alone.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Comes with the job.",
        "Carly: So does this. Oh, Mike. I'm glad to see you.",
        "Mike: Yeah? Why's that?",
        "Jack: Mike, there's something we have to tell you, and it's not going to be easy.",
        "Mike: Don't worry about it, all right? 'Cause I already know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I hope the doctor can find out what's wrong with you, Sarah, okay?",
        "Sarah: Bonnie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I know you're sorry about how I found out, but you are not sorry that Sage isn't mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brackett: Just .....",
        "Rose: Oh, let go! Let go..",

        "Holden: Lily?! Lily. I knew it. Dusty, she's here!!!!!!!!",
        "Holden: Lily? Hey, are you all right? [Lily mumbles] We're going to get you help. We're gonna get you all the help you need.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Lily: oh, I knew that you would find me. I knew that you would never give up on me.",
        "Holden: You were right. Lily, I need to get you to a doctor. I got to get you out of here right away. Can you -- can you stand up?",
        "Lily: My shoulder, I think it's -- I think it's broken. I think it's infected. It really hurts.",
        "Holden: I'll be as gentle I can, all right? But we can't stay down here any longer. How long has that been happening?",
        "Lily: They're blasting. The whole well is gonna cave in.",
        "Holden: All right, we just got to get out of here. Come on.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. You can't carry me, Holden. You're gonna have to get more people to help you.",
        "Holden: Lily, I am not --",
        "Lily: Oh!",
        "Holden: Come on, let's go. I can't leave you down here. In fact, I'm never gonna ever leave you again. Come on.",

        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Dusty: Hello?",
        "Margo: It's Margo. What's going on?",
        "Dusty: We found the well. Lily's inside. Holden's with her now.",
        "Margo: That's great. Good work. But you got to be careful. Brackett's on the loose.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean?",
        "Margo: He escaped. He jumped a cop, put on his uniform and walked away. He's got a gun, too, so don't take any chances.",
        "Dusty: How long ago did this happen?",
        "Margo: Look, I got to alert the search team. I'll be there soon.",

        "[Rose screams]",
        "Brackett: Don't move.",
        "Rose: You're not gonna get away with this. Dusty is gonna find you.",
        "Brackett: Well, that's what I'm counting on. You think there's room up there for one more?",
        "Rose: What are you talking about?",
        "Brackett: .....how you're gonna die.",

        "Katie: I thought you and Mike were just friends now.",
        "Molly: That's funny. That's the same thing I thought about the two of you.",
        "Katie: We are. Why can't t you accept it?",
        "Molly: I know Mike -- very well. And I saw a look on his face out there that I've never seen before. That doesn't happen from somebody that's \"just friends.\" So what happened, Katie? What'd you do?",
        "Katie: I don't owe you any explanations.",
        "Molly: Yes, you know what? You're not getting out of here until you tell me the truth.",
        "Katie: Nothing happened between me and Mike. It's not about that. Satisfied?",
        "Molly: No.",
        "Katie: All right, fine. Mike just found out that Sage isn't his child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This is my fault. I never should have left that paper where you could find it.",
        "Mike: How long have you known?",
        "Carly: I got the results from the doctor right before the wedding. I was going to tell you tonight.",
        "Mike: But you wanted Jack to know first.",
        "Carly: Yes. The father should know before everyone else, I guess. I know this isn't easy for you, and I know that you are probably very disappointed.",
        "Mike: Not tonight. You should be celebrating, you know? I just, I want to tell you, both of you congratulations!!! ---------- On your beautiful little girl.",
        "Jack: Thank you, Mike. That's very decent of you.",
        "Carly: Do you think that I could have a moment alone so I can talk to Mike?",
        "Jack: Yeah, of course, honey. I'm gonna be right outside.",
        "Carly: Can I tell you I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: I know you're sorry about how I found out. But you are not sorry that Sage isn't mine.",
        "Carly: You're still my friend. I don't want to see you hurt.",
        "Mike: I'm not looking for sympathy, all right, Carly?",
        "Carly: That's not what I'm offering. Mike, I really want you to know that if it had turned out that you were Sage's father, I would've been really happy for her.",
        "Mike: You don't have to say that.",
        "Carly: You would've made a great daddy. And you will. You will be a great daddy someday to some very lucky little boy or girl.",
        "Mike: I'd like that a lot. Hope it happens, you know? I guess you never know what's gonna happen in the future, though.",
        "Carly: You get whatever you want. Good things happen to good people. You're one of the best. I'm gonna go and get Jack. I don't want to miss my own reception. You ready?",
        "Jack: Uh, yeah. Um, why don't you go up to the cabin and get ready for the party? I'll get Sage together, and I'll meet you there, okay?",
        "Carly: See ya later.",
        "Jack: The word \"gentleman\" doesn't get tossed around a lot these days, but that's what you've been tonight, Mike. I want you to know I appreciate it.",
        "Mike: There's nothing I can do about it, you know? I just got to -- accept it, I guess.",
        "Jack: All right, then. Good night.",
        "Mike: Jack, wait. There's one more thing I need to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: It's no big deal, Dr. Daniels. This happens all the time.",
        "Sarah: No, I can't. Listen, you've been so nice. I don't want to cause you --",
        "Walker: Just give me a few minutes. I'll find somebody in the hospital to do it for you.",
        "Sarah: Please, no.",
        "Walker: Sarah, it will be fine. Stay..",

        "Bonnie: Why?",
        "Sarah: Bonnie, hi.",
        "Bonnie: Sarah? What are you doing here?",
        "Sarah: Well, I told you I was going to apologize to Dr. Daniels and I did, and he forgave me. No hard feelings.",
        "Bonnie: Um, well, that's good, Sarah. I'm glad that all worked out for you.",
        "Isaac: Me, too. You have a ride back to the shelter? Because I do have bus fare, if you need it.",
        "Sarah: No, thanks, I have to stay here and be examined.",
        "Bonnie: For what?",
        "Sarah: I'm not sure. Dr. Daniels thinks I could be sick.",
        "Isaac: Well, you look fine to me.",
        "Sarah: Well, I'm not. I've been running a fever, and it's been going on for a long time.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, all right. Well, I hope the doctor can find out what's wrong with you, Sarah, okay? Good luck.",

        "Katie: Um, I know it's your wedding day, and the last thing I want to do is ruin it, but I got to tell you, something terrible happened, and it's all my fault.",
        "Carly: Mike found out he's not Sage's father.",
        "Katie: Carly yeah",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm so sorry. It was a mistake. I was sitting down the champagne, and it fell on the floor, and I just looked at it",
        "Carly: Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie. It's okay. Nothing is your fault.",
        "Katie: How's Mike?",
        "Carly: He's okay. Well, he's -- he's handling it. Or so it seems.",
        "Katie: You know, he really believed that Sage was his. I want to help him so bad, but I just -- I don't know how.",
        "Carly: Just be there. Listen. I think the most important thing is to let him know that you care about him.",
        "Katie: Oh, I do. I mean, as a friend, of course.",
        "Carly: Of course. Hey, do me a favor, Katie, and don't tell anybody else about it.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, I won't. I promise.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Katie: Although -- I wish you would have told me that before. I mean, you couldn't tell me before. You didn't know that I would find out.",
        "Carly: Who did you tell, Katie?",
        "Katie: Molly. But only because she forced it out of me.",
        "Carly: And why would she do that?",
        "Katie: Because she's got this dysfunctional problem with me hanging out with Mike. I shouldn't have said that. She's your cousin.",
        "Carly: Yes, she is.",
        "Katie: Okay, no more talking about Molly, no more talking to Molly. It's your wedding day, and I am so sorry I ruined it.",
        "Carly: No, you didn't. Katie, come on. It's fine. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Katie: Are you sure?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Katie: And Mike, too?",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "Katie: I wish I could agree with you, but Mike lost something very important to him today, and I don't think he's going to get over it anytime soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Look, I'm not saying this to be a jerk, all right? 'Cause I'm really tired of fighting with you. But you better take care of that little girl.",
        "Jack: I will, Mike. And I'll take care of Carly and .... I know how lucky I am. I'm not gonna take anything for granted.",

        "Jack: I never thought she was mine, you know.",
        "Mike: How come?",
        "Jack: Come on, I was trying to be realistic. The odds were always in your favor.",
        "Mike: See where that got me.",
        "Jack: Hey, who's to say why things happen the way they did? Me? No, I'm not even going to try. But one thing I do know, this little girl came into this world with a lot of love -- from Carly, me and you, too. That's what made her so strong, more ready to take on the world. , , Thanks for everything",
        "Mike: I ..... haven't.",

        "Holden: Dusty, I've got to get Lily to the hospital, and I can't get her out of here myself. Hey, I need your help! Dusty, are you up there? I wonder what happened to him.",
        "Lily: Maybe he went to help Rose.",
        "Holden: Yeah, maybe, but he should have said something. All right, you know what? We're not going to worry about that. I got to get you out of here, and I need to get you straight to a doctor.",
        "Lily: We need Dusty's help.",
        "Holden: Are you kidding me? All we have ever needed is each other. We have survived crisis after crisis. We have overcome everything that life has thrown at us. What makes you think that we can't get out of this well? This is nothing. This is a walk in the park.",
        "Lily: Okay. Okay.",

        "Isaac: Leave her alone.",
        "Bonnie: Something is obviously very, very wrong here, Isaac. She's sick.",
        "Isaac: There's nothing wrong with her timing. As soon as you started to leave, she fell to the floor like she'd been shot. Bonnie, she's conning you, just like I told you.",
        "Bonnie: Sarah?",
        "Sarah: What's wrong with me? I feel so woozy. Bonnie, don't go. Please, I'm scared.",

        "Carly: Oh, did you guys have another fight?",
        "Jack: Oh, no, it was the opposite. We buried the hatchet. In fact, I kind of liked him saying what he did.",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah, you enjoy him threatening you? That's nice.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: I've got a little daughter I've got to worry about. The more people who care about her, the better and the happier she'll be. Thank you.",

        "Molly: Mike, you don't have to cover. I know.",

        "Mike: I got nothing to say. It wouldn't matter if I did.",
        "Molly: Okay, then maybe it's my turn. I know I've said a lot of horrible things since I found out that Carly might be pregnant with your baby. But I just want you to know that as happy as I am for Carly and Jack, that's how sad I am for how things have turned out for you.",
        "Mike: Are you happy, or are you sad? You need to make up your mind.",
        "Molly: I'm a little of both. I tell you, aren't you?",
        "Mike: In some ways.",
        "Molly: Mike, Carly and Jack have a really wonderful, beautiful family that they worked really hard for. And I want to see them get everything they want out of life. But I want that for you, too. And it breaks my heart that you're not getting it. It does.",
        "Mike: I know it would be weird, you know, having Sage back and me being Sage's father, but -- I really wanted that little girl to be mine. I could've made it work. I would've made sure of it. I just feel like something has been taken away from me, and there's no way that I can get it back.",

        "Margo: Lily! Oh, my God. Thank God you're all right. How did you get her out of there?",
        "Holden: There's a lot of debris down there, and there's rock pile that we had to climb up, but somehow we managed.",
        "Margo: That's amazing.",
        "Holden: She's -- she's kinda banged up. Her shoulder's infected, and she's running a fever. So I think we need to get a doctor.",
