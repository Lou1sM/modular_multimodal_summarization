        "Damian gives Luke a new convertible as a present, pretending it is solely because Fairwinds is isolated and this will give him more independence little does Luke know this is more manipulation on Damian's part. Mike fears Katie has gone overboard when the captain of the cruise ship brings him a piece of Katie's clothes attached to a life preserver; Mike vows revenge because he blames Simon for this. Katie wakes up on an island as Simon is stroking her hair. An angry Katie leaves to go collect firewood. Simon warns her where to build her fire, but she won't listen. A minute later, what Simon had cautioned her about happens. A golf ball just misses hitting Simon. Simon realizes they are not far from civilization. Susan tells a hopeful Emily about Jen's condition. Emily is stunned and heartbroken for her. Dusty tells Paul he doesn't want him near Jen since he and Meg told Jen about her condition. Paul is devastated to hear he is not on the list of people Jen drew up to have at her wedding. Jen asks Hal to bring Emily to her wedding. Jen, with Gwen's help, records a video diary for Johnny. Paul confides in Meg about the fact he may never be able to see Jen again or get to say his good byes. Dusty has found a specialist in Texas for Jen. However, Bob has terrible news for him when he has to tell him that they won't accept Jen because her condition is too far deteriorated. Dusty directs his frustration subtly towards Lucy when he remarks coldly she never should have been released so early to begin with. Damian later consoles Lucy. Everyone gathers for Jen and Dusty's wedding, but Jen explains someone is missing. They think she is talking about Kim who is bringing Johnny, but Jen corrects them when she tells them it is Paul who is missing."

        "Emily: I couldn't stand sitting in my room for another second. Every time I look up, I see somebody walking by. I keep praying its Jennifer. I can't help but hope that she's kept her promise and she's going to talk to Dusty about my hearing.",
        "Susan: Honey, she can't help you now.",
        "Emily: No, look, I know Dusty still hates me, I realize that. But if anybody can convince him to just give me some slack, it's her. I mean -- what? What's going on?",

        "Meg: We just want to know how she is.",
        "Paul: We saw everybody dressed up. We started to think --",
        "Dusty: You're wrong. She's fine, you hear me? She's going to beat this thing. And she doesn't need anybody around who doesn't believe that. Would you please, Hal? I've got stuff to do.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, but his appetite's regular again.",
        "Gwen: Like a champ. His appetite's all back.",
        "Jennifer: Look at him. He kept trying to take the bowl from Kim. He does better if you let him hold the spoon with you. Okay? Remember that.",

        "Simon: I have no idea.",

        "Simon: Yeah, I did this. You were the one who climbed up on that railing.",
        "Katie: I didn't climb up on the railing. I was trying to get away from you.",
        "Simon: Yeah, on a pitching boat in the middle of a storm. What? The thought of brushing me as you left the deck was so terrible?",
        "Katie: Yes!",
        "Simon: Oh, I'm sorry I make you so nervous.",
        "Katie: Oh! [Katie scoff] That's so -- Simon. You're a disaster.",

        "Katie: Everything with you is a disaster.",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah. I'm such a natural disaster. [Both sigh] Look, however we got here, we're here, okay? So why don't we just take a look around, see what we've got to work with and figure out a plan.",
        "Katie: Fine. Ow!",
        "Simon: You okay?",
        "Katie: Ah!",
        "Simon: Look, you've got a cramp. Just flex it out.",
        "Katie: Oh, go flex yourself. I can flex my own foot. Let's just go try and find a way off this rock.",
        "Simon: You really should give it a rest.",
        "Katie: We didn't even make it halfway across the island.",
        "Simon: The island's still going to be there once you're not a cripple.",
        "Katie: Let's just make a signal for the rescue boats.",
        "Simon: Good. That's a really good idea. We should do that. After you take a break. [Katie crying] And have a good cry.",
        "Katie: Poor Mike.",
        "Simon: Yeah, poor Mike. Poor Mike's dry and sitting at the breakfast buffet.",
        "Katie: He's probably worried sick about me. He probably jumped in after me.",
        "Simon: Well, that'd be a stupid waste of time, wouldn't it? 'Cause I was the one who jumped in after you and saved you.",
        "Katie: After you put me in danger. You don't get points for saving me after you put me in danger in the first place.",
        "Simon: Ah, where are you going? Wait, wait.",
        "Katie: I'm better off alone.",
        "Simon: Listen. Come on. Just help me gather some firewood and then you can go off to some little bush and sulk to your heart's content. How's that sound? Good?",

        "Gwen: You're shaking.",
        "Dusty: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: I just don't know if I can do this, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Are you okay?",

        "Jennifer: I'm so glad everybody's here today.",

        "Jennifer: Did Gwen show you the video she took of Johnny?",
        "Hal: Oh, no, not yet.",
        "Jennifer: Have her show you. I'm so lucky to have him, Daddy.",
        "Hal: He's lucky to have you.",
        "Jennifer: But I'm not the one who saved him. You know, he wouldn't even be with us if it weren't for Emily.",
        "Hal: Honey. Honey, no.",
        "Jennifer: It's true, Dad. She saved my son and I want her here. And I know that it's not fair to ask you, but I can't talk to Mom or Dusty about Emily. So, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Come on. You're tired and you're anxious. You've got to try to hold it together. Okay? For Jennifer.",
        "Barbara: This is so wrong. We can't just wrap her up in a wedding dress and pretend that everything is all right.",
        "Dusty: It's more than all right. It's what she wants. She wants her wedding now. So we're gonna give her her wedding now. We'll have a bigger one later, the way you wanted it. It's okay.",
        "Barbara: You make sure you say everything you want to say, okay? Don't wait. Don't be sorry.",

        "Bob: They've reviewed Jennifer's test results and also her history.",
        "Dusty: Good, will they be ready after the wedding?",
        "Bob: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: What is it? Lucinda has a plane on the tarmac. We get a team of nurses and we can fly, Bob.",
        "Bob: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: What do you say?",
        "Bob: They won't take her at the clinic.",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Bob: She's ineligible for treatment.",
        "Dusty: Ineligible?",
        "Bob: Her condition is too advanced. The damage is too severe.",
        "Dusty: Because she left the hospital before she was supposed to. If she waited, she would've gotten the proper treatment soon enough.",
        "Bob: We don't know that.",
        "Dusty: I know that.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. Sorry.",

        "Emily: Oh, my God. That poor woman. She wore herself out, looking after Johnny, didn't she?",
        "Susan: I don't know about that but you saved her baby. And she was very grateful for that. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I know you were counting on her being able to help you.",
        "Emily: For my baby's sake.",
        "Susan: And for your sake.",
        "Emily: No, listen -- whatever happens to me, I bought. But my baby -- I mean, I knew if Jennifer was here, that she would look after my child. She would help. She would see to it.",

        "Will: You designed an entire line of clothes and did a fashion show blind. Yeah, Jen told me. No one could tell that you couldn't see. But you pulled it off.",
        "Barbara: I had Paul and Jennifer working with me -- the whole family was together.",
        "Will: And you made it work because it mattered. And it matters now. You can do this. I've seen it before. Be that Mom again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Happy birthday! Four years old. You must be so big. And I bet you're asking Daddy all kinds of questions -- why is the sky blue? Why do I have to brush my teeth? Sometimes, honey, the answer really is -- just because. I can't believe you're in first grade in a whole brand new school. Just remember, things may seem hard at first, but then, if you keep trying, they get easier. And pretty soon, you'll be so excited to learn. I bet, right now, you think your dad is the most uncool person you know. When I was a teenager, my dad was pretty lame, too. But don't worry, dads learn. And in the meanwhile, you can always turn to your Uncle Will and your Aunt Gwen. They know a thing or two about learning from mistakes and your dad does, too. So don't you give up on him, J.D. Happy 21st birthday, I bet your not letting them call you Johnny anymore, John Dustin Donovan. I wish I could be there for that party. Better not get in too much trouble. I bet your dad is there. Just like he was there the night you were born. When you fit right in his hand. He loved you from that first second. You roped him in for me. And from that moment on, I was the luckiest woman in the world. So don't you ever feel bad for me. 'Cause I had it all. And I wish that kind of love for you, Johnny, in your life. That's all I wish for you. I love you with all my heart.",

        "Jennifer: Why don't we ask them to move the hospital to the lake, so we get a better view?",
        "Barbara: Don't think I didn't considered it. You look so beautiful. You did a great job with her makeup, Gwen. [Jennifer coughing] Honey, honey, honey -- small sips. Small. Okay? All right? Do you want some more water?",
        "Barbara: Get that woman out of here.",
        "Jennifer: No. Mom, I invited her.",
        "Gwen: Dusty gave Will a list. Are we done in here for a few minutes?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Hal: Honey, you look gorgeous. Let's go help Will and Dusty. Barbara, we need you.",

        "Jennifer: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Emily: But why? Dusty'll hate it.",
        "Jennifer: He'll have to accept it. Like I do. For Johnny.",
        "Emily: How is he?",
        "Jennifer: He's better. Johnny is gonna be fine because of you. All is forgiven.",
        "Emily: I can never make up for what I did to you. And to Dusty.",
        "Jennifer: That's why there has to be forgiveness. I'll make sure Dusty knows that. Hate is wasted energy. And he has a child to raise. Like you will.",

        "Paul: She said she never wanted to see me again.",
        "Meg: Oh, Paul --",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no -- well, she said that a lot but, it was this time when I took all of her doll's clothes and I hid them and she said, \"I never want to see you again.\" And then I embarrassed her in front of her first boyfriend. And she said, I never -- ever ever want to see you again.",
        "Meg: Until the next day.",
        "Paul: It didn't even last until dinner.",
        "Meg: That's because you're not just Jennifer's annoying brother. You were her protector, too.",
        "Paul: And that's why I can never listen to her, you know? I'm idiot enough to think that, okay, maybe it'll take a week -- it'll take a month, six months tops but there's not way that I can't make things right with her. And she's going. And, Meg, if she dies hating me, I will never, ever be okay.",

        "Damian: Come on, that's absurd.",
        "Lucy: He honestly believes that if he -- he could've controlled the whole situation if he'd only known.",
        "Damian: Hey, listen, you didn't do anything wrong. You didn't make this woman sick, you tried to keep her in the hospital until she got better. If she didn't listen, how can that be your fault?",
        "Lucy: That's what I thought. But it's all gone so wrong. I mean, she's going to die, Damian. And I can't do anything now. I'll always feel like I did something unforgivable.",
