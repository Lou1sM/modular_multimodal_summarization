        "Carly has a nightmare about a woman crying over her baby boy. Carly is sure it has something to do with her father, but Jack is becoming concerned about what this might do to Carly and he tries to steer her away from going down that road, but as usual, Carly won't be deterred. Later, Jack meets with Susan, and they talk about the fact the man who was involved in the incident that shut down a clinic, was Carly's father. Susan tells Jack that the records are sealed, but Jessica's name came up related to this case. Both he and Susan worry about the ramifications of opening Pandora's box to Carly. Jack thinks they should prevent that from happening and so when Susan goes to see Carly later, she claims the drinking back then made her remember things wrong, and that she could no longer be sure of anything she told Carly about back then. Carly immediately wants to know why Susan is lying to her? Craig is upset over being forbidden from seeing his baby for 5 years, and Rosanna wants to lift his spirits by them adopting a child. Craig considers it, and they decide to go forward, and they are able to set up a meeting with a teenage mother-to-be that afternoon, and in walks Gwen. Henry moves his stuff out of the cottage so Katie could rent it out, but ends up taking care of Snickers so Margo doesn't put her in a kennel. Mike has a confrontation with Jen at home about how she lied to him, her family, friends and a judge. He doesn't think their marriage can survive not having trust. She is devastated, as Mike walks out to go clear his head in Chicago. Meg and Dusty spend the night together, but after hearing a distraught message from Jen, Dusty is ready to take off. Meg calls him on his feelings, but he claims she is just a business partner. After he rushes off, Meg gets a call about a job in Juno General in Alaska in two days. Katie ends up at the same hotel and room in Chicago where she stayed with Mike. She is haunted by memories, and wants to switch rooms. The bellman tells her they are booked, but will try to do something for her. Later, she leaves to go shopping to clear her head, and misses Mike arriving to stay in the room across the hall by seconds."

        "Henry: Your message? You said come over as soon as possible. Is Katie okay?",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah, she's fine. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you. I just thought maybe you should get your stuff out of here before the realtor came.",

        "Margo: Yeah, Katie's going to rent out the cottage.",
        "Henry: Well, where's she going to live, Margo?",
        "Margo: Well, not here in Oakdale. In fact, she didn't know where she was going when she left last night.",
        "Henry: When she left? Margo? Okay, wait, I'm sorry, time out. How can she leave if she doesn't know where she's going?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Dusty, this like my millionth message. Please call me. Mike knows that we set Craig up. And now he's gone. Oh, Mike! [Jennifer sobbing] I knew you'd be back. Oh, thank God.",

        "Meg: Oh, don't worry, I will.",
        "Dusty: Are you okay?",
        "Meg: I'm just a girl, interrupted. You know, you're a lot of things, Donovan, but I never figured you for a liar.",
        "Dusty: So I'm a liar now, huh?",
        "Meg: You told me I was crazy thinking that there was something between you and Jennifer, but you just jumped up to ride to her rescue right now. You know, I would say that I was dead on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I was so worried. I didn't know what to think. I never should've doubted you. I knew you'd be back.",

        "Mike: It's a little late for that.",
        "Jennifer: No, please don't do this. Please don't do this, Mike. Think about what we have. Think about how good we are together.",
        "Mike: You know what? If things were so great between us, none of this would have happened. So I'm starting to think that maybe our marriage never should've happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, this is such a mistake. I never should've come here.",
        "Bellman: Would you like me to check on another room?",
        "Katie: Yes. Oh, yes, please. That would be great. As soon as possible. Okay, relax. It's just temporary 'til they find you another room.",

        "Margo: Well, you.",
        "Henry: Me?",
        "Margo: Yeah, Henry, she felt awful when she got those divorce papers.",
        "Henry: So, I'm the reason for her self-imposed exile?",
        "Margo: Uh, not entirely.",
        "Henry: No, of course not. What was I thinking. It's Mike. Even in breaking up, I'm second banana.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, Henry. Come on. Katie felt awful. She did. She felt like she had messed everything up with both you and Mike, and the best thing that she could do was just to leave you both alone.",
        "Henry: We're not alone. Margo, he has Jen, and I've got what? My bar tab at the Lakeview. I don't even have a wittle wabbit to call my own.",
        "Margo: Oh, speaking of a wittle wabbit, I've got to get him to the kennel. I'll leave you to pack.",
        "Henry: What do you mean, the kennel? You can't do that. The kennel? It's a free-range rabbit.",
        "Margo: It's a rabbit.",
        "Henry: It's a free-range rabbit. It's never gotten that out of its blood. It can't be caged up and look at the same four walls, day in and day out. It needs to be free. It needs to be able to roam, make new discoveries, live life to its fullest. Come on.",
        "Margo: You know, Henry, you sound like a man in love.",
        "Henry: Snickers and I, we have a special understanding.",
        "Margo: Then I will let you do the honors.",
        "Henry: You mean it?",
        "Margo: Sure. I mean, you know Snickers better than just about anybody.",
        "Henry: Well, we've been friends a long time.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Henry Coleman, you have a heart in there, don't you? A great big heart that you let very few people see. It's an absolute shame to let such love and affection go to waste. And you, to be loved by someone who really loves you for yourself -- you should appreciate that. And Katie was very lucky to have had you for the brief time she did. I've gotta get going. I've got a brother who's in distress. I'll be back here to clean everything up before the realtor gets here, okay?",
        "Henry: Snick! I missed you, too. Hey, I'll tell you what -- after I get packed up, how 'bout we celebrate this reunion with a little endive salad, hmm? A little vegetable terrine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You're leaving?",
        "Craig: You don't have to pretend to act surprised.",
        "Rosanna: Well, do you think that that's what I want? Because I don't.",
        "Craig: You agreed to marry me to help me establish parental rights to my child. I lost that battle, so I'm not going to hold you to that promise.",
        "Rosanna: Come on, now. Look, I promised to help you become a father.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, that is over.",
        "Rosanna: When I told you that I wanted us to be each other's family, I meant it. I want us to have a child. Boy, do I deserve this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It seemed so real.",
        "Jack: It was a dream, honey. Goes with the territory.",
        "Carly: The woman was crying. I wish I knew who it was.",
        "Jack: Maybe it was you.",
        "Carly: Me?",
        "Jack: Maybe you were crying because this thing with Les still has you reeling. And not just the way he attacked you here, but at Lily's, honey. I mean, come on. Think about it. He left you for dead in a trunk in a burning house. Maybe you're dealing with les in a way that you can't deal with him when you're awake.",
        "Carly: No. No, if I was dealing with Les, I would've been throwing punches, not crying. Maybe I am dealing with something from my own life, something to do with a child.",
        "Jack: You nearly died protecting J.J., Carly. Protecting him from Les.",
        "Carly: No, no, sweetie. This is something else. Think about it. What has been on my mind more than anything else lately?",
        "Jack: The photo? There's no child in the photo.",
        "Carly: Yes, but my father is in the photo. And Susan said that whatever went on with my father, it had something to do with a child. And the woman in my dream, Jack, she was crying about her little boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack remembering]",
        "Hannah: If Carly ever knew, it would kill her, Jack. Be grateful that she lived here this long and didn't find out.",
        "Jack: Find what out?",
        "Hannah: You have a wonderful life and a beautiful family. Don't let Ray take that away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We don't know that Ray did anything. What are you doing?",
        "Carly: I'm gonna call Susan. She might remember something.",
        "Jack: Honey, you just woke up, and you're still upset from a dream, which, by the way, could mean any number of things having absolutely nothing to do with your father. If Susan remembered something, it's not gonna hurt you to maybe take a shower, ease yourself into the day, maybe think this through a little.",
        "Carly: You're afraid that what Hannah said is true, aren't you? You're afraid that if I keep pressing this, that you could lose me. Jack, that is never gonna happen. After everything we've been through together, nothing is gonna keep us apart.",
        "Jack: I know that, honey. I just don't want you to get your hopes up that Susan's suddenly going to remember everything.",
        "Carly: All right. I'll take a shower, I'll get myself together, and then, I'll call Susan.",
        "Jack: Susan, hi, it's Jack Snyder. You do? Good. No, no. How about I meet you at Metro? Now. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You really think I got a thing for a pregnant married woman? You're a little nuts, you know that?",
        "Meg: And you are so deluded. You think you're so good at hiding what you feel?",
        "Dusty: Hide what? Jennifer and I are business partners. That's it.",
        "Meg: Fine. Can't force glasses on a blind man. So, when did she leave those messages?",
        "Dusty: When?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dusty: A little while ago.",
        "Meg: So, if she's waited this long, she could wait a little while longer, right?",
        "Dusty: I really gotta go. Call me before you go to Alaska.",
        "Meg: I'll try to remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "[Answering machine]",
        "Katie: Hi. I'm not home right now. Please leave a message. Hey Margo, it's me. Are you there? I was hoping to catch you while you were still with the realtor. I really need to talk to you.",
        "Henry: Okay, but only for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, I don't know how I could have let Cabot go if you hadn't been there.",
        "Craig: I loved Cabot, too. I never stopped loving Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: I know. And that's why you were able to help me. You were able to make it possible for him to have a better life. You saved him. You saved me. The least I can do is to see to it that you can have your dream come true.",
        "Craig: If you're talking about adoption, we tried that already, didn't we? And that was a disaster, thanks to me.",
        "Rosanna: I know, but you played right into James' hands. We all did. But I think you learned your lesson, you know? And this time we could -- we could adopt legally.",
        "Craig: No, I can't.",
        "Rosanna: I know that your heart is broken. And so is mine. But you know the only cure for a broken heart is love. And we have so much of it inside us, it would be a sin not to share it. Especially when there's some little boy or girl out there who needs it so badly.",
        "Craig: Well, I have a little boy out there.",
        "Rosanna: I know. I know. And if I thought there was the remotest possibility that you would be allowed to be a father to him, I would move heaven and earth to make it happen. But I don't think so. And from your mood this morning, I'm pretty sure that you don't think so, either. So maybe we should just move on.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but how? With my record as a mommy-pusher, I'm back on police blotter again. What agency is gonna consider me?",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe we don't have to go through an agency. We could consider a private adoption. I've spoken to an attorney who handles those sorts of things.",
        "Craig: You're that convinced?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I'm convinced that you would recognize a good idea when you heard it. Now, look, you don't have to make up your mind now. The attorney said it takes lots of time, so you have time to think it over. Will you?",
        "Craig: Yeah. I will, yeah.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Margo: Hi. Phyllis let me in. Is this a bad time?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no, it's fine. You go ahead and talk. I have some phone calls to make.",
        "Margo: Craig, I am really sorry. I know how much this hurts you. And if there's anything I can do, just say the word.",
        "Craig: You mean that?",
        "Margo: Of course I do.",
        "Craig: All right, then you tell your husband to get me back my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Wait, are you saying that you wish you never married me?",
        "Mike: We rushed it, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: How can you say that? We didn't even -- we didn't even go through with it in Vegas. And then we talked and we talked about it.",
        "Mike: Sure, sure, we talked about whether or not I could still love you, even though you had slept with another man. We talked about whether or not I could marry you if you were carrying that man's child. We talked about Craig, trying to keep him from claiming -- we talked about everything except what we should have been talking about. You and me.",
        "Jennifer: I thought you loved me.",
        "Mike: I did. I still do, Jen. I don't see how our marriage can survive without trust.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, these -- these were special circumstances that will never happen again. I had to do what I did protect my child!",
        "Mike: Your child. See, that's the problem right there. You never really saw him as mine. But I did, okay. And because I did, I was willing to do whatever it took to protect him. You just couldn't trust that I would.",
        "Jennifer: No, where are you going?",
        "Mike: Chicago.",
        "Jennifer: This is it, then? This is over?",
        "Mike: I don't -- do you really think we can go on like this? I don't.",
        "Jennifer: No, please. No, no, no.",

        "Dusty: Are you really gonna throw everything away because of this?",
        "Mike: I told you to stay out of this.",
        "Dusty: I helped her out.",
        "Mike: You used her.",
        "Rosanna: I did just speak to the adoption attorney, and he faxed over a profile of a birth mother who's willing to meet with us.",

        "Rosanna: Today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I just stopped by to pick up the rest of my things.",
        "Katie: Oh. Well, I won't keep you. I really just called to talk to Margo.",
        "Henry: Right, right. Well, she left. She said she'd be back in time to get everything together for the realtor. Do you want me to leave her a message, or --",
        "Katie: Just tell her I'm staying at the Lakeshore Hotel in Chicago, at least for the next couple days.",
        "Henry: The Lakeshore Hotel. Isn't that the place where I was supposed to meet you?",
        "Katie: Yes, the hotel where you stood me up.",
        "Henry: Well, technically, Katie, I didn't leave you completely alone.",
        "Katie: No, you didn't. So, you'll let Margo know I called?",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure.",
        "Katie: I guess this is it, then.",
        "Henry: I guess.",
        "Katie: Bye.",
        "Henry: No, Katie, Katie, Katie, wait a second. Wait a second. I need -- I need to tell you something. I really -- I wish --",
        "Katie: You wish what?",
        "Henry: I wish you could see Snickers.",
        "Katie: Why? Did something happen? I knew I shouldn't have left him with Margo. She thinks he's just a rabbit. She doesn't realize how special he is. That spirit that he has. He can't just be left in a cage. He needs to run around and be free.",
        "Henry: Margo did see that.",
        "Katie: She did?",
        "Henry: Yeah. That's why she agreed to let me take care of him. I hope that's okay.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's great. You know, I would have asked you myself, but I just like I've already asked you to do so much for me and just one other thing that would remind you of how -- it just, I don't know. It seemed tacky.",
        "Henry: It's okay. Even if we're not together anymore, I am still there for Snickers, all right?",
        "Katie: He couldn't be in better hands.",

        "Dusty: I was looking after her and her baby. Maybe you don't see it that way.",
        "Mike: No, you know what I see? I see a user who is trying to make an old enemy pay. Did you ever stop to think about what this little scheme's gonna cost Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: I didn't pack your bags. That's all you.",
        "Mike: No, I'm talking about Craig. 'Cause you know what people do when they feel the way that he does right now? They lash out. And feel justified doing it.",
        "Dusty: Mike, you heard the judge. He cannot go near her.",

        "Craig: And maybe somebody else besides me got Jennifer to take a fall.",
        "Margo: Prove it.",
        "Craig: Too late. Judge bought Jennifer's lies instead of the truth.",
        "Margo: Well, what is the truth?",
        "Craig: Truth is, Jennifer came to me, trying hard to bait me. Okay? She said, \"Please don't push me!\" Loud enough for everyone to hear. And then she fell.",
        "Margo: What, so she set you up?",
        "Craig: She took a dive! All right? But nobody believes me, because I'm always the bad guy. To you, to Tom, to Jennifer, to everybody else in this town, no matter how hard I've paid for my mistakes. In jail, in the monastery, in Bangkok. Every face I look into, every moment I'm alone. But the town needs a scapegoat. So Oakdale's got me. This was it.",
        "Margo: What? What?",
        "Craig: This was my last chance to be a real father here, but now that's gone.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, hon, no. You've got a lot of life ahead of you. You can start again.",
        "Craig: What, and forget that my son is being raised by somebody else? Jennifer and Mike Kasnoff? That my son is calling another man \"Daddy\"?",
        "Margo: I know how much this hurts you, Craig. I do. But this is -- this is not your only way to get another chance.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Margo: Come on. Don't shut me out.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. You say you want to help me, but you don't, not really.",
        "Margo: Don't --",
        "Craig: You can't.",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Craig: Nobody can.",

        "Parker: J.J.",
        "Carly: And how did J.J. get gum in your hair?",
        "Parker: He was hanging from the low branch, and the gum fell out of his mouth.",
        "Carly: And how many times have I told you boys not to climb or run with food in your mouths?",
        "Parker: But it wasn't food. Are you gonna cut my hair off?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know. Let's see what I can do.",
        "Parker: This is gonna hurt, isn't it?",

        "Jack: All right. It was her father. And I don't know exactly what there is to uncover. But, frankly, after everything she's been through lately, I'm afraid that whatever she finds out might send her over the edge.",
        "Susan: Hate the way the past won't stay where it belongs.",
        "Jack: You know something, don't you, Susan?",
        "Susan: No, not much more than I told you yesterday, except -- when that photograph was taken, I was volunteering at a family health clinic.",
        "Jack: Which one?",
        "Susan: It doesn't matter. But that's what I remembered, that there was some sort of incident that eventually shut it down.",
        "Jack: An incident involving a child?",
        "Susan: That's what I think. But when I went through the old hospital records, trying to find something out about the clinic, I discovered that the records are sealed. I know it's not much.",
        "Jack: No, it's another dead end.",
        "Susan: Not necessarily. There was one name that came up that could be useful.",

        "Jack: This incident involved the law?",

        "Susan: Look, like I said, I was either out of town or out of my mind, so I'm a little sketchy. But maybe Jessica can point you in the right direction.",
        "Jack: This may be one case I don't want to solve.",
        "Susan: I can understand wanting to keep a Pandora's box like that closed. Considering what Carly's been through recently, I, for one, would feel very bad if I'd unwittingly opened it.",
        "Jack: Don't feel bad just yet. There -- there may be a way to still keep the lid on.",

        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? You regret getting Montgomery off your back because Mike's ego won't allow him to admit that he couldn't get the job done? You wanted Craig gone, right?",
        "Jennifer: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's what you got.",
        "Jennifer: And I lost my husband in the process!",

        "Jennifer: That's what I told him. But it doesn't make up for anything. I've hurt him too much.",
        "Dusty: He's a big boy. He can take it.",
        "Jennifer: That's just it. He's done too much of that. And now he's gone. And he's angrier than I've ever seen him and I don't know what he'll do. Or what I'll do.",
