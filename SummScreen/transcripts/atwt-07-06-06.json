        "Maddie: Henry, please pick up, please pick up, I need you. Henry!",
        "Henry: Maddie, my favorite little sister. How'd you know I'd be here?",
        "Maddie: Well, there's a bar and enough bad card players here to keep you drinking martinis 'til the end of August.",
        "Henry: Yes. That reminds me -- it's payday around here. I'm gonna play a little poker, and with any luck I'll be buying you lunch.",
        "Maddie: I need money -- real money, not just lunch money.",
        "Henry: For what?",
        "Maddie: I have to get out of this town.",
        "Henry: Maddie, hey -- Maddie, what is this? The last time we spoke you were talking about a vacation. And now you're acting like you got the cops on your trail.",
        "Maddie: And if I did, what, are you saying that you wouldn't help me?",
        "Henry: Of course I would help you. Don't say something like that. Are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "Maddie: No! No!",
        "Henry: Then why do you want to get out of town?",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Dallas: You still can't even say the words. You were sexually assaulted!",
        "Maddie: Because I can't stay here. Not when he's in town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, so you can see that Lieutenant Munson runs a pretty friendly squad.",
        "Dallas: Is he here?",
        "Margo: No, he had a family emergency.",
        "Dallas: Understood. Family comes first.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it does in this squad. We've all worked with each other for a lot of years and we watch out for each other.",
        "Dallas: You know, my aunt's been saying that. I mean, that's also another reason why I'm happy to be here. Well, Chicago's a great town, but -- with so many people coming and going, I mean, it's kind of hard to really connect, you know?",
        "Margo: I do know. And I think you're going to do just fine here.",
        "Cop: Detective Hughes?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Cop: Sorry, it's the D.A.'s office. There's some question about Mahoney paperwork.",
        "Margo: Oh, Man, I knew this was going to be a problem. Give me a minute?",
        "Dallas: Sure. Take your time.",
        "Casey: Griffin!",
        "Dallas: Casey. Your mom just stepped out.",
        "Casey: I'm not here to see my mom. What the hell did you do to my girlfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: I'll bring you back as soon as they're ready for you. It may be a few minutes.",
        "Meg: He's growing up so fast, I almost didn't recognize him.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. A year from now he won't even remember her.",
        "Meg: You know, I've done a lot of time in obstetrics. Seen a lot of babies born. Jennifer's gonna be a part of him and he's gonna be a part of her. Whether he remembers the time they spent together -- she's always going to be with him.",
        "Gwen: You're right.",
        "Meg: I know I'm right. She's in his smile, his sudden love for anything fashionable.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Meg: His spirit.",
        "Kim: I'll have copies made for everyone.",
        "Barbara: Thank you for taping it, Kim.",
        "Bob: It was a lovely ceremony.",
        "Kim: Oh, it was. Our precious girl was just -- heartbreakingly beautiful. And the flowers, all the love that surrounded her, how can we ever forget that?",
        "Barbara: I'm just glad that she made it through. It was so important to her. And I just don't understand, because it's just so damn unfair. She had so much ahead of her.",
        "Will: I think she's accepted it. That she doesn't have much time left. And knowing what's coming -- and that everybody understands. It helps.",
        "Paul: Everybody but Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: We can't put it off any longer, you know that. We have to tell each other the truth.",
        "Dusty: We always tell each other the truth.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty -- we are running out of time. And I need you to go through this with me. Because if you don't, I will be so alone.",
        "Dusty: I'm right here.",
        "Jennifer: No, you're not. You're hoping. And we don't have time. And if you keep it up, we're gonna miss the little time that we have left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Here, sit down. Breaking up, it's hard to do, Pumpkin.",
        "Maddie: Henry, I don't need advice, okay? I need money. I can't stay here anymore.",
        "Henry: You're not talking about taking a vacation. You're leaving.",
        "Maddie: I have to. We can rendezvous someplace glamorous like Monte Carlo. Or if that's too far, then Vegas --",
        "Henry: No, bite your tongue, okay? The only place I want to rendezvous with you is the student lounge of the Ivy League college of your choice.",
        "Maddie: Meanwhile, I need money.",
        "Henry: Right. Well, we're not going to get it off of Nathan and Manuel -- I can barely cover my dry cleaning bill with those boys. I need to talk to the management of this place, they are seriously underpaying their kitchen staff!",
        "Maddie: Then we'll go to plan B.",
        "Henry: Where did you get that?",
        "Maddie: Out of the bank. And I still have some donut money left.",
        "Henry: Don't touch -- no, we're not touching the donut money! The donut money is sacred.",
        "Maddie: Fine, I won't touch it, but we need a stake. And you need to pick a winner.",
        "Henry: That's a lot of pressure, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Fine, then I'll do it! High Tide in the fourth.",
        "Henry: High Tide's off his feed and his trainer's a known doper. Try Ladies Choice in the fifth -- and Sayonara to place.",
        "Maddie: Just do it.",
        "Henry: Is he worth it, Maddie? Running away? I know Casey's a jerk --",
        "Maddie: He's not a jerk.",
        "Henry: Then why are you doing this?",
        "Maddie: Because I -- I can't stay. All right? So are you going to place the bet, or do I have to do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Casey, you need to talk to Maddie.",
        "Casey: I tried like a hundred times. But she wouldn't tell me what was wrong. And when I bring it up, she gets more upset.",
        "Dallas: Look, I wish I could help you, but you need to talk to her. Okay? I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Whoa -- you're sorry? Dude, this is your fault!",
        "Margo: Hey, what's going on? What is going on?",
        "Casey: Ask him!",
        "Dallas: Look, I'm sorry, Detective Hughes.",
        "Casey: No, you're not. Don't say you're sorry. Maddie broke up with me because of him.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Everything was going great before you moved to town. It was perfect. And then Maddie runs into you and suddenly everything changed.",
        "Margo: All right. I don't understand. What would Officer griffin have to do --",
        "Casey: I don't know! All I know is that I saw you guys on the roof together and now she's all freaked out.",
        "Dallas: Look, Casey, I know you're upset and I know you're confused. Okay? I really wish I could help you, but I can't!",
        "Casey: I'm going to find out what you did to her, and when I do --",
        "Dallas: Talk to Maddie.",
        "Casey: Go to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why would we give up hope? I mean, 'cause a bunch of doctors are drawing blanks? Why not pray?",
        "Jennifer: For a miracle?",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Jennifer: Baby, I've had my miracles. Twice. With you and with Johnny. I've had a life full of miracles. And I know that it's hard. And that it hurts -- giving up what you want. But sometimes when you do that, you get so much more. I don't know how to explain it, but when I realized I was leaving you, you became so much more precious to me. Everything about you. I love you so very much. And I -- you know, how hard it is for me to ask for help -- but I need you to let go and help me die. Because I can't go through it alone. It's like when Johnny was coming, it's too overwhelming. And I can feel something happening to me. I feel it. And I want to share it with you. I want you to be with me. And there's still so many things that I have to say to everybody. So, please -- stop fighting me on this and help me.",
        "Dusty: I -- I don't want to let you go.",
        "Jennifer: I know. I know.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Okay. What do you need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm going to change Johnny, and then I'm gonna take him outside to grab some air. And then I thought I'd go over to Java and get some lunch for the both of us.",
        "Barbara: I forgot all about lunch.",
        "Gwen: Do you want me to send something over?",
        "Barbara: No, I can't eat anything. Thank you.",
        "Gwen: All right, I love you.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer would like to see her family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jennifer crying]",
        "Kim: Honey, Honey don't --",
        "Jennifer: It's okay. I'm just going to miss you all so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Look, I'm sorry, Detective Hughes.",
        "Margo: Wait a minute. Now, I have -- I know that my son can be volatile. I've never seen him blow up for no reason, though.",
        "Margo: Okay, frustrated -- how do you know Maddie?",
        "Dallas: We've met before.",
        "Margo: In Chicago?",
        "Dallas: I'm not at liberty to say.",
        "Margo: I do not understand, officer. My son is accusing you -- I don't know what my son is accusing you of, but his girlfriend broke up with him, and for some reason it's because of something that you've done.",
        "Dallas: Look, I'm sure that's how it appears to your son, but the fact is that Maddie Coleman --",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Dallas: I was the officer on record due to an incident in which she was involved. Okay? That's the extent of our connection.",
        "Margo: So this is a police matter?",
        "Dallas: Yes, ma'am. And, as you know, I'm not at liberty to discuss anything without Maddie Coleman's authorization. And she's made that very clear. She's also insisted that I discuss the matter with no one -- especially you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, Mickey, you're breaking my heart here. What about Sayonara? Threw a shoe? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, you win some, you lose some -- only not today, Mickey. Today I need a little bit of luck. Yeah, thanks.",
        "Maddie: All of them?",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, kid, you're washed out.",
        "Maddie: Well, what am I gonna do? That was every last penny that I have.",
        "Henry: That's why I drink. It helps pick me up after I fall on my face at the track. Let me get you a ginger ale. The bartender's a friend of mine. I'm sure he'll spot me a soda, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Uncle Bob?",
        "Bob: Yes, Sweetheart?",
        "Jennifer: I know you did everything you could, and then some. This isn't your fault.",
        "Bob: I just wish --",
        "Jennifer: I know. Me, too. But nobody has all the answers. Not even you. I used to think that, when I was little. Uncle Bob knew everything. But that's not why I love you. I love you because you're funny, and you're sweet, and you're kind. And I could always depend on you. You, too, Aunt Kim. I don't know where my mom would be without you. I really don't. Remember when you used to tell me about my grandmother?",
        "Kim: Yes, I do. How much she was like you. Your namesake. You with your beautiful red hair.",
        "Jennifer: You used to do that when I was little. Brush my hair.",
        "Kim: Right --",
        "Jennifer: And I can picture her face. I remember her. Like the picture beside your bed.",
        "Kim: Oh, that's when she was holding your mom, when she was a baby.",
        "Jennifer: I can feel her arms around me now. You take care of Mom.",
        "Kim: You can count on it. My precious girl. I love you, Jen. God bless you, darling.",
        "Jennifer: Will -- [Will crying] Hey, hey -- Will, I need you to do something for me, okay? I need you to take care of Johnny. 'Cause he's gonna need you. I want you to tell him all about me. About our childhood. Remember when we used to go to the lake? And when we would read together? And you would always finish the page first, but you would wait for me. And when we used to draw, for hours, in front of the fireplace. You tell him all that for me. I'll always love you.",
        "Dusty: How about some water?",
        "Barbara: Okay. Here you go, Sweetie. I promise I won't cry. I promise. Jen?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, you okay? I'm right here. Right here. That a girl, that a girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Henry: And you know Maddie -- once she makes up her mind --",
        "Casey: She's as good as gone.",
        "Will: She's my sister, and I'm never gonna see her again, and I couldn't even tell her that I love her.",
        "Gwen: She knows that you love her.",
        "Dusty: What can I do?",
        "Jennifer: Just hold me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Tennis, anyone?",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Henry: Just ran into Biff and Buffy at the bar. They wanted to know if I care to join them for Canadian doubles. [Henry laughs] No. So I suggested poker, poolside -- so who knows, you might get lucky yet.",
        "Maddie: I have to go.",
        "Henry: What about your ginger ale?",
        "Maddie: You drink it.",
        "Henry: I can't drink that, there's no rum in it.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, maybe Biff will spot you. I have to go.",
        "Henry: Maddie -- hey, Mad -- whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on a second here. You're obviously upset about something, we need to talk.",
        "Maddie: I can't talk to you! I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: I'm your brother.",
        "Maddie: I know, and you love me. And I want to keep it that way.",
        "Henry: Maddie -- Maddie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie didn't want you to talk to me?",
        "Dallas: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Margo: Well, I don't understand. I mean, Maddie lived with me -- we're friends.",
        "Dallas: Well, are you her guardian?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Dallas: Then I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Well, look, obviously this girl is very important to my son, and I might have had issue with how they handled the relationship before, but Maddie knows that I love her. She's like a daughter to me. And if she's in trouble, I want to know about it. Come on. I mean, she's here all alone. She doesn't have anybody, except her brother -- who's, you know, not much help at all. Or her friends. So, I want to help. I have connections with the Chicago PAD.",
        "Dallas: Look, I really wish there was something I could do. But if Maddie wants to keep this confidential, I have to respect her wishes.",
        "Cop: Excuse me, Detective?",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm?",
        "Cop: It's the D.A.'s office again. Line 2.",

        "Emily: He was so upset earlier.",
        "Kim: Oh, he's heartbroken -- we all are.",
        "Bob: Well, he's gonna be fine. He went off to spend some time with Gwen and Johnny.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's good. That'll help.",
        "Guard: They're ready for you.",
        "Emily: Meg -- please tell Paul I'm sorry for his loss. This is gonna be really hard on him. Jennifer was always the only one he ever felt close to in his family.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know.",
        "Emily: This changes everything, doesn't it?",
        "Meg: It always does.",
        "Emily: Well, I hope you'll keep in mind what Jennifer wanted. She wanted me to have a chance to be a mother to my child. She wanted my child and her child to know each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Daddy?",
        "Hal: Yes, Honey?",
        "Jennifer: When I was little, and I would see you across the playground -- after school, you'd pick me up. I always felt so safe.",
        "Hal: Well, that was the idea.",
        "Jennifer: But you didn't have to love me. I wasn't yours. But you did.",
        "Hal: Well, that was selfish. I just had to make you mine.",
        "Jennifer: Daddy?",
        "Hal: Yes, Honey?",
        "Jennifer: I'm scared.",
        "Hal: I know. But I'm right here with you.",

        "Jennifer: You have nothing to apologize for.",
        "Barbara: I wasn't a very good mom to you, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I turned out pretty good, so you couldn't have been that bad.",
        "Barbara: You're the most wonderful, wonderful daughter any mother could possibly hope for.",
        "Jennifer: I know.",
        "Barbara: I loved you since before I ever held you, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: And I have always loved you. Despite all the battles, I have always loved you. Mom?",
        "Barbara: Yes?",
        "Jennifer: If you ever get the urge -- and you will -- to, you know, press the issue with Paul or Will -- go easy, all right? It'll make you happier. It'll make everybody happier.",
        "Barbara: I'll try. I'll try.",
        "Jennifer: Come here. [Barbara crying] I love you, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I love you, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: It's okay.",

        "Will: How was it? It was -- useless. I was useless.",
        "Gwen: What do you mean?",
        "Will: Well, you know, she asked to see me so I went in there and I sat next to her and -- I just sat there. I couldn't tell her that I love her or that I'll miss her. And I just kind of broke down -- I fell apart and she had to comfort me. She's my sister and I'm never gonna see her again and I couldn't even tell that her I love her.",
        "Gwen: She knows. She knows that you love her.",

        "Paul: Yeah, no -- I know, I know.",
        "Jennifer: But you know what? When I realized that I was -- there's just no time for that. Anger, resentment -- it's a waste of time. And you know when you love someone, there is never enough time. So don't waste it, okay?",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: I know you're a good person. You're a good brother. Protecting me, I know. I know you loved me. It just got all twisted. So just straighten up, okay?",
        "Paul: I'm trying.",
        "Jennifer: Just do it. Forgive -- everybody. Love everybody -- especially yourself. Okay? Love yourself. I love you.",
        "Paul: I love you.",

        "Casey: Where'd she go?",
        "Henry: I don't know. That's why I called you. Now, I'm her brother and I don't like seeing her like this. So man to man, Casey, what did you do to her?",
        "Casey: Me? I didn't do anything to her!",
        "Henry: Swell, he's pretty messed up about this break-up.",
        "Casey: Man, it was her idea! And I have no idea why, everything was going fine and then she just weirded out on me. But don't worry, I'll find out why.",
        "Henry: Really? You better hurry up. Because she's leaving town.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. I tried to talk her out of it but she's already made up her mind. And you know Maddie, once she makes up her mind --",
