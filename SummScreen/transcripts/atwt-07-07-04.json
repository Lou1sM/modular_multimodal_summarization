        "Henry: You're a hard man to track down. I thought you were supposed to be working on the new addition to the E.R.",
        "Mike: I am.",
        "Henry: Well, that's a few flights down. What are you doing here?",
        "Mike: Coffee machine was broken downstairs.",
        "Henry: Right. Mike, you think I don't remember that this is the floor that Katie was assigned to? Makes you feel good, huh? Talking to a bunch of people that miss her as much as you do?",
        "Mike: What do you want?",
        "Henry: I want to join your construction crew.",
        "Mike: Want to join my crew?",
        "Henry: That's right. I want feel the joy of building something. Don't laugh now. I want to live off the sweat of my brow. I want to swing one of these babies.",
        "Mike: Right.",
        "Henry: I also want to pay off my parking fines. I'm in need of some gainful employment there, old buddy.",
        "Mike: Forget it.",
        "Henry: Mike, there is a warrant out for my arrest.",
        "Mike: Add it to your collection.",
        "Henry: That's not fair. Now I have not been busted in over a month. Come on, now. You must need a little bit of help around here.",
        "Mike: Henry, hiring you --",
        "Henry: Yes?",
        "Mike: -- Would be a very expensive mistake. How much do you need?",
        "Henry: $500.",
        "Mike: There's $300. Take it or leave it.",
        "Henry: Thanks. You know, you're a pal. And now that Katie's gone, it's nice to know that I still have you.",
        "Mike: And I thought I couldn't feel any worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Everything in this plea agreement seems fine.",
        "Jessica: Good. I'll convey the news to my client.",
        "Tom: So, now --",
        "Jessica: Yes?",
        "Tom: Why are we here? This is the kind of business we usually handle over the phone but you wanted a face-to-face. So what's up?",
        "[Jessica remembering]",
        "Margo: Tom followed him. He saw Doc in his car with another woman, but all he found was the other woman's compact in the car.",
        "Jessica: I just wanted to see how you were doing. You know, after everything that's happened.",
        "Tom: I'm sure Margo told you.",
        "Jessica: Yes, Margo has talked me because I'm her friend. And I am your friend, too, Tom. And I care about you.",
        "Tom: All the same, I don't think we should be having this conversation.",
        "Jessica: Why not? You don't need somebody to talk to, too?",
        "Tom: Maybe down the road but right now it's all just still a little too raw.",
        "Jessica: Okay, then you're probably not going to hear what I want to say, but I'm going to say it anyway. You have to start trusting Margo again.",
        "Tom: That's going to be a little tough, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Oh, come on, Tom. Doc Reese is a flirt, okay? He flirts with anyone in a skirt. So he came on to your wife. She resisted.",
        "Tom: Oh, I see she didn't tell you everything.",
        "Jessica: It was one kiss. One bad moment in the multitude of good moments that have made up your marriage. Come on, let it go.",
        "Tom: How? How do you let go of the knowledge that your wife betrayed you?",
        "Jessica: Okay, it's not going to happen overnight. You know, but you have to not give yourself the opportunity to dwell on the pain. Just -- just if there's anything that reminds you of it, just get rid of it. Any small, insignificant thing -- just get rid of it.",
        "Tom: I wish it were that simple, Jess, but it's just not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yeah, hi. I'm going to have a --",
        "Jill: Do I look tired to you?",
        "Margo: Oh, Jill, I --",
        "Jill: It's because I stayed up half the night waiting for Doc to call. You did tell him to call me, didn't you?",
        "Margo: I did give him your ultimatum, yes, but apparently he doesn't want to sleep with you on demand.",
        "Jill: Well, that's just because he doesn't know what he's missing. But he will as soon as we spend some time together.",
        "Margo: My, my, my. You're such a confident girl. More power to you.",
        "Jill: I didn't ask for your approval, detective. I asked for you to get Doc to call me and I do not like waiting.",
        "Margo: And I do not like being blackmailed, lady. So you get out of my face before I lose my temper.",
        "Jill: You keep your end of the bargain, or everyone in this town will be talking about you. And your husband won't like what they're saying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Agent Fox, I didn't expect to see you.",
        "Agent Fox: And I didn't know you were such a hot dog. When did you decide to make the Donovan/Starziak case your personal crusade? Can somebody around here get me a desk? I have a mess to clean up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, lullaby. Oh. You all right? Huh?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Craig: You must be in shock after that ordeal -- what Dusty put you through.",
        "Lucy: How many times do I have to tell everyone? Dusty saved my life.",
        "Craig: Oh, sweetness, I think Dusty has fooled a lot of people.",
        "Lucy: Well, he didn't fool me. He risked his life to keep me safe. He could have left me behind weeks ago, but he was determined to find out who was behind this plot to kidnap me.",
        "Craig: Let me just give you a word of caution.",
        "Lucy: Daddy --",
        "Craig: All right? Do you remember the trouble he got Aaron into? The illegal betting? Sweetness, he can't be trusted.",
        "Lucy: Well, I trust him.",
        "Craig: Well, that's just foolish. Just because he says he's going to track the real kidnappers.",
        "Lucy: It's not foolish at all. He already knows the name of one of the guys.",
        "Craig: He does?",
        "Lucy: Yeah -- Don Creel. Dusty's going to track him down and he's going to find out who hired him to kidnap me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Took your sweet time, didn't you?",
        "Starziak: What's the matter, Dust you got something against fresh air and sunshine?",
        "Dusty: I got something against being jerked around. I want Creel. You going to give him up, yes or no?",
        "Starziak: That would be a no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Mike, you know, $300 is great --",
        "Mike: That's all I'm going to loan you.",
        "Henry: I know. I'm not asking for more. No, no, no. You misunderstand me. I just thought maybe we could spend some time together. You know, an hour -- maybe two.",
        "Mike: To do what?",
        "Henry: To come down to the police station with me.",
        "Mike: It's parking tickets, not manslaughter. Just pay the bill.",
        "Henry: You're right. You're right. You're right. Maybe we could do lunch. You know, provided I'm released under my on recognizance.",
        "Mike: I eat alone.",
        "Henry: Oh, okay. I just thought that since I miss Katie and you miss Katie, we have something in common, but never mind.",
        "Mike: Metro- I'm having lunch at Metro. You want to meet there, fine.",
        "Henry: There we go, okay. This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.",
        "Mike: Its lunch, Henry. Don't ruin it by making threats.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: What happened? I've been going over and over it in my mind. I mean, do I spend too many hours at work? Do I not pay enough attention to her?",
        "Jessica: Come on, Tom. Stop it, stop it. You're going to make yourself crazy.",
        "Tom: Oh, I've already mastered that, Jess, trust me. Last night, I followed Doc Reese. I just couldn't help myself. I was going to catch him with my wife.",
        "Jessica: But you didn't.",
        "Tom: Saw him with another woman. Probably some other poor guy's wife.",
        "[Jessica remembering]",
        "Jessica: Just give me your word that you will just stay away from all of us, okay?",
        "Doc: Get out of here now.",
        "Jessica: Excuse me?",
        "Doc: Just get out. Somebody's back there. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: But you didn't recognize who this woman was?",
        "Tom: No, I didn't get a good look at her. But she did leave something behind.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, Margo said something about a compact?",
        "Tom: Yeah, it was in Doc's car. I grabbed it before he saw me. I was gonna take it home and give Margo the third degree. Yeah, I was gonna treat her like some perp I was building a case against. And this thing didn't even belong to her. I do not like what this is turning me into.",
        "Jessica: That's why you just have to wipe the slate clean, Tom. Okay? And you can start by getting rid of this so called evidence that didn't amount to anything. It was nothing.",
        "Tom: I don't think I'd use the word nothing, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Come on. It was a flirtation, Tom. You've have to move on.",
        "Tom: Could you? I mean, if Ben was flirting with some nurse? I apologize, Jess, that was over the line.",
        "Jessica: No, no. No, no. It's -- it wasn't that. It's a twinge or something in my back. I probably pulled a muscle working out. I'm fine, really.",
        "Tom: You sure?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tom: Look, I -- I gotta get going.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, okay -- Tom, just take my advice, okay. I mean, just get rid of the compact. If you want you can give it to me. I'll throw it away for you.",
        "Tom: I don't even have it, Jess. I left it in the car. But I appreciate the advice. I gotta get to the Country Club.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm supposed to meet Margo there for lunch. Would you tell her I'm gonna be a little late? I think I'll stop somewhere and get a heating pad for my back.",
        "Tom: Sure. No problem.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: First I'm gonna take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I thought we were going to be discreet.",
        "Margo: I know, but that's a little difficult when Jill is pouncing on me every time I walk in here. She said you haven't called her yet.",
        "Doc: I've been busy.",
        "Margo: Come on, Doc, please. You gotta get her off my back. She's gonna destroy what's left of my marriage and -- Doc? Doc, please. Deal with her.",
        "Doc: All right, all right. I'll find a way. Is everything else okay?",
        "Margo: No, not even close. But I'm working on it.",
        "Doc: All right. You wanted to see me?",
        "Jill: I want to do more than just look.",
        "Doc: Mmm, that sounds interesting. I'm staying at the Lakeview.",
        "Jill: I know.",
        "Doc: Hmm? Why don't you meet me over there in the lounge in say -- say about an hour?",
        "Jill: I just have to get off work. You're not gonna regret this, Doc. I mean, we're gonna have a very memorable time.",
        "Doc: I have no doubt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey, on the phone -- on the phone you told me you'd give me Don Creel. And now you're backing out? What's the game we're playing?",
        "Starziak: You owe me money, hombre. I give up Creel, what's in it for me?",
        "Dusty: How 'bout I don't break your neck?",
        "Starziak: I either make a profit on you or I make one on Lucy Montgomery. She's got a very rich Grandmother.",
        "Dusty: No, don't even think about Lucy Montgomery. She's totally off-limits to you.",
        "Starziak: What about you?",
        "Dusty: What's that mean?",
        "Starziak: She's not just rich, she's beautiful. And you just spent a couple of days shacked up --",
        "Dusty: Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. Please, she's a kid.",
        "Starziak: You know, you seem a little personally invested in this, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: Yeah? You are, too. You're just too stupid to know it. The feds want to talk to me all day about you.",
        "Starziak: Is that so?",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah. And before I leave this town, I gotta prove that I didn't kidnap Lucy Montgomery. So, unless you want the feds to bring me in for questioning, I suggest that you give me Don Creel so I can get out of here.",
        "Starziak: Well how 'bout you get him yourself. I'll tell you how. You know that dive, Yo's? Don creel's brother's part owner. Maybe you'll get a lead there.",
        "Starziak: You double-cross me to the feds --",
        "Dusty: I've never ratted out anyone, partner. I ain't startin' now.",
        "Starziak: Good plan. Might even keep you alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Don Creel? Where would Dusty get a name like that?",
        "Lucy: You know him?",
        "Craig: Sweetness, how would I know someone like that?",
        "Lucy: I don't know, it just sounded like you recognized the name.",
        "Craig: Sweetness, he may not even exist. I think -- I think our friend Dusty is trying to play your hero.",
        "Lucy: You know, I am not just some gullible little girl. I think I know when I'm being conned.",
        "Craig: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Lucy: No, you don't. For the first time in days I finally feel something close to safe and you have to go and ruin it by acting suspicious.",
        "Craig: I'm not trying to ruin anything. I'm just trying to say, \"don't put your faith in what Dusty says, just because he says he's trying to get on the track of somebody who may or may not be real.\"",
        "Lucy: He is real. He has a tattoo on his wrist. Just like the guy who was trying to kidnap me on the way to the airport.",
        "Lucinda: Craig! The child has been through a taxing ordeal. Is this your way of welcoming her back to us? By haranguing her?",
        "Craig: No, she's just -- Dusty says he's hot on the trail of the \"real\" kidnappers. And I'm just saying we shouldn't put much stock in what Dusty has to say.",
        "Lily: Your father's right.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah, why don't we just gang up on the guy who saved my life?",
        "Craig: We're not ganging up.",
        "Lucy: You know, I don't want to hear about it.",
        "Craig: Lullaby --",
        "Lily: Let her go. She's going to need a little time to get over this.",
        "Craig: How does a guy like Dusty -- continue to get people to trust him?",
        "Lucinda: You always manage to.",
        "Lily: You know, instead of arguing with Craig, why don't you listen to what he has to say? He has a very interesting theory about who could be involved in Lucy's kidnapping.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, no. I won't indict anybody without, you know, absolute proof.",
        "Lucinda: Never stopped you before.",
        "Craig: I don't think this is a good idea.",
        "Lily: You have to tell her. Please?",
        "Craig: I'm saying that if we're gonna keep Lucy safe, we have to keep an open mind as to who the real kidnapper might be.",
        "Alan: I agree. Do you have any ideas, Craig?",
        "Craig: Of course, but nothing concrete.",
        "Alan: Even a theory is better than nothing. I need to reassure Sierra that this nightmare is going to end.",
        "Craig: I haven't shared my suspicions with the police because they are just suspicions so far.",
        "Alan: Well, I'll take whatever I can get. Sierra's wound pretty tight right now and she's not going to relax until she knows who these kidnappers are.",
        "Craig: I -- ah --",
        "Lily: Craig -- maybe Craig is right. We should just put our theories aside and let the police come up with some suspects.",
        "Craig: Absolutely. But I'll call Sierra and let her know everything we're doing to keep Lucy safe.",
        "Alan: No need. I will call her.",
        "Lucinda: He's Sierra's husband. He's the stepfather. You can't cut him out of the loop all the time. And you, darling -- what are you up too? One minute you want Craig to spill his theory and the next minute you're nipping everything in the bud?",
        "Lily: Craig believes that someone in the family might be involved in Lucy's kidnapping.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Alan! That's ridiculous. I'm not going to think about it any more.",
        "Craig: I'll see you at home.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Lucinda: It's not your home, dear. You bum. And how can you continue to give him credibility?",
        "Lily: He's making sense. Whoever took Lucy knew her schedule. This was not just some random act.",
        "Lucinda: So, naturally, it has to be the new stepfather. It has to be the man who is making Sierra happy. Finally! Happier than Craig ever could!",
        "Lily: How long -- how long did Sierra know this man before she married him?",
        "Lucinda: I don't know. I think it was a whirlwind romance.",
        "Lily: Did you meet him? Did I meet him? Did Lucy meet him?",
        "Lucinda: Sierra is no fool.",
        "Lily: She's human. Mother, she has lost so much the past few years with Bryant, and her marriage, and Lucy leaving. Lonely people make mistakes.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. All right. I'll have a background check run on Alan Drake.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Immediately! And if he is the man that is terrifying my granddaughter, I will find out. Oh, but I'm barging ahead. I'm meddling again.",
        "Lily: I welcome your meddling this time with open arms. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Fox: Sorry, lieutenant, but your kid screwed up!",
        "Hal: Oh, if that's your idea of a screw up --",
        "Nikki: You're right. I did screw up, but I can still find Donovan. Just give me one more chance.",
        "Hal: Look, forget the fact that I am Nikki's Dad. But cop to cop, Lucy Montgomery confessed that Donovan is trusting Nikki. Now, he trusts her and we can't squander that.",
        "Nikki: He'll be suspicious of any other agent.",
        "Hal: At least let her try to re-establish contact with him.",
        "Agent fox: What about Molly McKinnon?",
        "Nikki: She's Dusty's partner.",
        "Agent Fox: And now she's missing.",
        "Nikki: Yeah but I don't think that has anything to do with Donovan. I think that has to do with Starziak.",
        "Hal: I agree. And I've got men working on it. We're going after Starziak from every angle.",
        "Agent Fox: I'll give you 12 hours to bring Donovan in.",
        "Nikki: You think I can find Donovan in 12 hours?",
        "Hal: I think you can do anything, Nikki. But I don't think Donovan is going to come bursting through the station house doors. So, if I were you, honey, I'd get on the stick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, Tom, hi.",
        "Tom: Hi. I'm meeting a judge here.",
        "Margo: I'm meeting Jessica here for lunch.",
        "Tom: I know, she and I were hammering out a plea agreement. Oh, she wanted me to tell you she's going to be a little late.",
        "Jill: Mr. Hughes, your guest called. He'll be here in a few minutes.",
        "Tom: Thanks, um --",
        "Jill: Jill.",
        "Tom: Jill.",
        "Jill: Just ask your wife. She never forgets my name.",
        "Tom: Is that the one -- that Casey and Curtis think is so hot?",
        "Margo: No, no. Oh, no, I hope not. They're not her speed, no. Listen, after you meet the judge, you want to join me for an iced tea or something.",
        "Tom: You know, my afternoon is kinda booked.",
        "Margo: Okay, I figured maybe I was pushing it here.",
        "Tom: No, no, it's fine. Go ahead -- go ahead and push. I mean, believe it or not, I want this all to work out and I am trying.",
        "Margo: Thank you.",
        "Tom: No, thank Jessica.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Tom: She gave me a little advice. Thinks it's time for me to let go and I think she's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: Jess, are you feeling all right?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I -- well, I don't know. I called your office a little while ago because I was feeling pains. Like, twinges. Right over here.",
        "Ben: Don't tell me its twins.",
        "Dr. Schiller: More like a little internal stretching. Even in the first week, things begin to move around.",
        "Jessica: First week?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Yeah, you still have another 39 to go.",
        "Jessica: Wait, that must be a mistake. I thought those tests couldn't pick anything up until the first month.",
        "Dr. Schiller: No, a blood test can pick up a pregnancy in 48 hours.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Tom: No, no, no, I've got it. It's all right. Ow! Hello.",
        "Nikki: Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Get inside the house and do wheat the security team tells you to do.",
        "Lucy: I wish I could see you.",
        "Craig: Who do you wish you could see, sweetness?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Good, you got us a table. Sorry --",
        "Ben: What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: I'd just gotten a little light-headed.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Have you eaten today?",
