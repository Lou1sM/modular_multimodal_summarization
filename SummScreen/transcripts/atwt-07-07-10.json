        "Craig: I think I know what this is about. Jack must have found out that I'm underwriting the perfume deal for Carly, and, so, he's decided to take it out on my son.",
        "Lily: That's impossible. Carly doesn't even know about you. How would Jack find out?",
        "Craig: I wouldn't put it past Jack to tap phones or access private bank accounts.",
        "Lily: No. He would never do that, and he would never use Gabriel to get at you.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Craig: What the hell happened?",
        "Jack: I need you to calm down for me.",
        "Craig: You know, if the police department is singling out my son for harassment, then you can prepare yourself to get sued.",
        "Lily: What are the charges against Gabriel?",
        "Jack: Gabriel was busted with three other guys in an illegal poker game.",
        "Craig: Poker? Why the hell would he do that?",
        "Jack: I don't know, Craig. He's not my son.",
        "Lily: What did he say?",
        "Jack: Not much.",
        "Lily: The other players, were they older?",
        "Jack: Considerably.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe they were trying to scam him.",
        "Jack: Or maybe Gabriel knew he was breaking the law, and he did it anyway.",
        "Craig: How soon before I can bail him out?",
        "Jack: You know the drill. You got to wait 'til he's arraigned.",
        "Craig: I'd like to see him.",
        "Jack: Sure. Bring Mr. Montgomery to the interrogation room, and bring his son up from downstairs, please. Thanks.",
        "Lily: Jack, is there anything that I can do to help Gabriel?",
        "Jack: Not at this point, but there's something you can do for me.",
        "Lily: What's that?",
        "Jack: I heard about this new business venture you're doing with Carly.",
        "Lily: Carlisle fragrances. We're really excited about it.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, she's reassured me that Craig has nothing to do with it, and, Lily, I'm trusting you'll keep it that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Francoise: Bonjour, Lucinda! [Speaking French]",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Come on, sit. Sit. Everything's good with you?",
        "Francoise: Oh, yeah. [Speaks French]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, absolutely. Coffee?",
        "Francoise: Oui. Merci.",
        "Lucinda: I do need a favor from you.",
        "Francoise: Oh, it will be my pleasure to help you in any way I can. This, you know.",
        "Lucinda: Do you still have that fabulous, delightful perfume factory in France?",
        "Francoise: You mean the one where our good money went to die? No, no, no, no. It was torn down years ago, shortly after your company pulled out of our deal.",
        "Lucinda: Well, this is what I need.",
        "Francoise: What?",
        "Lucinda: I need you to sell it to my daughter.",
        "[Speaking French]",
        "Francoise: You want me to sell your daughter a factory that does not exist?",
        "Lucinda: Right.",
        "Francoise: Ah. But, you understand, this could ruin your daughter.",
        "Lucinda: Well, some lessons are painful but necessary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're gonna need a surge protector and a fan.",
        "Parker: Isn't there air-conditioning in the dorm?",
        "Carly: Yeah, but what if it breaks down? It's summer in New York.",
        "Parker: Okay, fine. I'll get the fan, but, Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something.",
        "Carly: What kind of sheets --",
        "Parker: Mom! Look, the only reason that I wanted to do the summer program was because I thought Liberty was coming.",
        "Carly: Liberty wants to study chemistry?",
        "Parker: No, but remember that internship that she had at the fashion magazine that I messed up for her?",
        "Carly: You want to make it up to her.",
        "Parker: Yeah. And I was thinking, maybe you could spread some of that insurance money around, or maybe even Lily could talk to somebody to try to get Liberty another shot at that internship? You're thinking \"No.\"",
        "Carly: No. I'm thinking I wish more men were like my son. If Liberty wants an internship in New York, I'm more than happy to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Thank you, Officer.",
        "Gabriel: What are you doing here? You know I didn't ask for you.",
        "Craig: Well, that's too bad, because right now, I'm the only chance you have, unless you plan to wind up in prison.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna get me out just like that?",
        "Craig: I am your father.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, but you always have an angle.",
        "Craig: As should you.",
        "Gabriel: Come on. What's the catch, Craig?",
        "Craig: All I ask in return is that you give me a chance.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I don't need a dad anymore, okay? I'm all grown up now.",
        "Craig: If you say so.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, wait, wait. What do you mean by giving me a chance? What, you want to take me out to a baseball game, get my hot dogs, play Frisbee? What?",
        "Craig: I like hot dogs. Do you?",
        "Gabriel: What do you want?",
        "Craig: Well, for starters, you can tell me where you got the money that you were gambling with.",
        "Gabriel: That. Well, I --",
        "Craig: Don't bother making something up. It was the payoff money that Lucinda gave you, wasn't it? How much did you lose? All of it?",
        "Gabriel: No. Look, I was about to win it all back, okay, 'cause I was holding three aces, except this cop came in and busted me. Oh, yeah. Great. You don't believe me, do you?",
        "Craig: No. I was just thinking how many times I've held three aces and still came up empty. Why would you want to gamble away all that hard-earned cash?",
        "Gabriel: No, you wouldn't understand.",
        "Craig: I have so far.",
        "Gabriel: It's none of your business.",
        "Craig: You can either get out of here today, or you can get out in five to ten.",
        "Gabriel: Okay. I did it for a girl.",
        "Craig: There's always a girl. Why does Liberty need the money?",
        "Gabriel: I didn't say it was Liberty. Okay. 'Cause she's working at a dress shop to pay for college, and it's gonna take her forever to do that, so.",
        "Craig: Did she ask for your help?",
        "Gabriel: No, but she talked Jack into offering me a job, and I thought --",
        "Craig: You thought you'd be the hero. Well, been there, tried that, failed miserably.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, Man. You never change. You know, you got me to spill my guts, and then you walk out. Thanks a lot, Dad.",
        "Craig: Don't thank me until you mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: You should start over.",
        "Liberty: But I'm almost done painting.",
        "Faith: But it's ugly.",
        "Parker: Hey. What are you guys doing?",
        "Faith: Hey, Parker. We're painting chairs. You want to help?",
        "Parker: Actually, I need to talk to Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I can't stop in the middle of this, because I will mess it up.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Liberty: What did you need?",
        "Parker: Well, you remember that summer program that I was telling you about, the one that my mom really wanted to get me into?",
        "Faith: I remember.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Did you get in?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: That's awesome!",
        "Parker: And it gets even better.",
        "Liberty: With what?",
        "Parker: Well, while I'm going and doing my thing, you can hook up with that summer internship program at the fashion magazine, like before.",
        "Liberty: But that internship didn't work out.",
        "Parker: Because of me, but I'm gonna make up for that, okay? Just think about it, Liberty. New York City for the entire summer, just you and me. This time we get things right. What do you think?",
        "Liberty: I don't know what to say. The answer's no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you call me and tell me you got the message?",
        "Lily: Because your message said to get over here right away. What's going on?",
        "Carly: Well, I got a call from someone named Francoise Pacaud. Does that name ring a bell to you?",
        "Lily: It kind of sounds familiar.",
        "Carly: I did an internet search. I couldn't find anything about her or her business.",
        "Lily: Why would she be calling you?",
        "Carly: Well, she's got a perfume factory in France, and she heard about our new company.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Carly: I had that meeting with the international realtor this morning, and you said that you were gonna do some footwork to find a factory in France.",
        "Lily: I did.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe somebody we talked to talked to her.",
        "Lily: Does she want to lease us her factory?",
        "Carly: She wants to sell us her factory.",
        "Lily: For how much?",
        "Carly: Here are the notes that I took during the call.",
        "Lily: This can't be right. Is this in Euros?",
        "Carly: No. Dollars. I went over the numbers with her twice.",
        "Lily: Carly, this would cut our overhead by half.",
        "Carly: I know! Can you believe something like this falling into our lap?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carly: Bonjour, Madame Pacaud.",
        "Francoise: Oh, please, call me Francoise.",
        "Carly: Oh, Francoise. Thank you. Come in.",
        "Francoise: Thank you.",
        "Carly: I am Carly Tenney, and that's my partner, Lily Walsh.",
        "Francoise: I'm so pleased the two of you could see me on such short notice.",
        "Carly: I was just telling Lily, it's practically fate, you calling today.",
        "Francoise: Really?",
        "Lily: Fate had nothing to do with it.",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Lily: I just remembered how I know her. My mother put you up to this, didn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: The arraignment's set for a half an hour from now.",
        "Craig: You got him on this morning's docket?",
        "Jack: You're in a hurry to get your kid bailed out, right?",
        "Craig: I am, yes. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Judge Thorndike, courtroom \"C.\"",
        "Craig: Uh, about that arraignment.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Craig: Gabriel's a repeat offender. So am I, for that matter.",
        "Jack: What you getting at, Craig?",
        "Craig: Well, I think the judge would feel that Gabriel has better prospects if he has focus, a job.",
        "Jack: So find him one.",
        "Craig: How about that job that you offered him?",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: Working for you at the farm. Will you still give him that job?",
        "Jack: Well, I had my doubts before, but now --",
        "Craig: Yes?",
        "Jack: Hell, no.",
        "Craig: You -- you won't give the kid a chance?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Jack: I don't need to give you a reason, Craig.",
        "Craig: Did you ask him why he was gambling?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I did. He didn't give me an answer.",
        "Craig: He had a good reason.",
        "Jack: Oh, here comes a sob story. What? Was he gonna use the money for widows and orphans? Feed starving kids? Save puppies from the mill? What?",
        "Craig: He wanted to help Liberty.",
        "Jack: How does a poker game help Liberty?",
        "Craig: He was going to give her his winnings. How else do you think?",
        "Jack: Liberty doesn't need money.",
        "Craig: Not even for college? He wanted to help pay her tuition.",
        "Jack: Okay. Even if that's true, it doesn't matter why he broke the law. He broke the law!",
        "Craig: Well, it should matter! He was just trying to help a friend. Now he needs someone to help him, someone to fight for him.",
        "Jack: And you want that to be me?",
        "Craig: When it comes to a courtroom, I'm gonna be more of a hindrance than a help. He doesn't want my interference, anyway.",
        "Jack: Then why are you talking to me in the first place?",
        "Craig: Because you can do what I can't. You can help him. Give him that job. Parker's a good kid. You didn't give up on him.",
        "Jack: Oh, if you think bringing up Parker after everything you've done to him is the best way to appeal to me, you're nuts.",
        "Craig: You have a new baby boy on the way. Now, how would you like it if that little guy grew up, got into a jam, and someone you knew wouldn't help him.",
        "Jack: Enough with the hard sale. Fine. He can have the job.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Thank you, Jack. You have no idea how much I appreciate that.",
        "Jack: I don't want your appreciation. I just want him to show up, do a good job, and keep his nose clean, 'cause the first time he gets into trouble, he's out on his ear, and I will never help you or him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Look, its New York in the summer, okay? Think of all the great connections you could make, all the people that you would meet, the people that would get second chances.",
        "Liberty: But I already have a job.",
        "Parker: No, no. Look, working at Fashions is not a job. You hang dresses on a rack. It's practically the same thing as putting your laundry away. This would be so much better.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Well, living in New York would cost a fortune, and I'd be working for free.",
        "Parker: No, no, no. Look, my mom and I will cover all of your expenses.",
        "Liberty: I have to think beyond the summer. I need to save money for college, and my mom needs me to help get the cabin ready for the baby.",
        "Faith: You're right. Because, like you said, Gabriel can't do it all himself.",
        "Parker: Gabriel? He's gonna be working here?",
        "Liberty: Maybe.",
        "Parker: Oh. Now I get it.",
        "Liberty: No, you don't.",
        "Parker: College and saving money. Those were all just excuses, right? Everything's about Gabriel with you!",
        "Liberty: Why did you say that?",
        "Faith: Because he had a right to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Somebody needs to catch me up on what's going on here. You know Lucinda?",
        "Lily: Francoise didn't just happen to find out about our new company. She used to be in business with Lucinda at Worldwide.",
        "Carly: You used to be?",
        "Francoise: Lucinda and I had a -- how do you call it? These are called a falling out.",
        "Lily: And now you had a, how do you call it, a rapprochement with my mother?",
        "Carly: Lily! Why don't we give Francoise an opportunity to explain?",
        "Lily: Explain what I already know? Look, when I went to my mother and told her I was determined to launch this company on my own, she said that she was excited for me and that she wanted to be a part of it, but I said, \"No, this is something I need to do on my own,\" and she said she understood that and she supported me and my efforts.",
        "Carly: Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Yeah, if it were true! The only reason that she sent Francoise over here with this easy offer was because she wanted to keep herself in the mix. Deny it.",
        "Francoise: Obviously, this is not a good time to discuss business. If you want to change your mind, let me know.",
        "Carly: No, wait! Francoise, s'il vous plait. Just give me a minute, okay?",
        "Lily: Why are you asking her to wait?",
        "Carly: Because I would like a moment alone with my partner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Parker! That was a really sweet thing you did for Liberty. I can't believe she was so ungrateful. If you had done something like that for me --",
        "Parker: Get lost, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: You don't have to stick around while I do this.",
        "Craig: It's part of the deal.",
        "Gabriel: Look, I don't need you hanging around me making sure I do the right thing.",
        "Craig: Somehow, I think you might.",
        "Gabriel: Well, whatever. Look, you wouldn't know the right thing if it smacked you in the face.",
        "Craig: Perhaps, but I'm not leaving until I do what I came here to do.",
        "Gabriel: You know, if you think this is what being a good dad is, you're dead wrong.",
        "Craig: What does that mean to you, Gabriel? Being a good dad.",
        "Gabriel: If you have to ask, you'll never know.",
        "Craig: Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Craig: Nice to see you. Can we come in?",
        "Liberty: Sure. The place is kind of a mess.",
        "Craig: Oh. Looks like you have a bit of a project going.",
        "Liberty: Something like that. So, you two are hanging out together?",
        "Gabriel: No.",
        "Craig: This is a special situation.",
        "Gabriel: Craig just paid my bail.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. Bail? Like, you got arrested? What for?",
        "Craig: I'll leave you to explain.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. You sure you can trust me to do that?",
        "Craig: I'm sure I can trust Liberty to get the truth out of you.",
        "Liberty: What happened?",
        "Gabriel: I got busted for gambling.",
        "Liberty: Were you gambling?",
        "Gabriel: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Don't tell me Jack was the one who arrested you.",
        "Gabriel: No, but he was there when they hauled me in.",
        "Liberty: Oh, that's great. Why -- why did you have to go and mess up? You knew that I asked Jack to give you that job.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I didn't know if that would come through, and I needed a lot of money fast.",
        "Liberty: For what? Don't lie to me. What did you need the money for?",
        "Gabriel: To give it to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If Francoise is willing to give us a deal on the building, we should take it!",
        "Lily: No. The only reason she's making us this deal is because my mother thinks I'm an idiot when it comes to business.",
        "Carly: Well, you're not an idiot. You know it, and your mother knows it. You own half of WOAK, and the Lakeview and real estate everywhere.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, I made those deals before.",
        "Carly: Before what?",
        "Lily: Before I lost my mother her company.",
        "Carly: Well, she got it back.",
        "Lily: Eventually. And yeah, she's forgiven me, but I lost her trust and her faith.",
        "Carly: And that's why you want to prove to her that you can make this company work.",
        "Lily: Partly. And I want us to have fun doing it, and I can't do that if my mother's the one driving the train.",
        "Carly: I understand. I do. I would feel the same way if I felt that Craig was trying to wrangle his way into this. All right. Let's turn Francoise down.",
        "Lily: That would make me feel so much more comfortable.",
        "Carly: All right. Then that's what we'll do.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Carly: But first we should think like executives.",
        "Lily: I thought that's what we were doing.",
        "Carly: We're being independent. But are we being smart? Who cares who put Francoise up to this? If we buy her factory, it'll save us a fortune in time and money.",
        "Lily: According to the numbers.",
        "Carly: So, we'll go over the numbers again, we'll make sure they're legit. Lily, this is the way to prove yourself to your mother.",
        "Lily: By taking a handout?",
        "Carly: By taking an opportunity that she threw away and making it pay off, big time.",
        "[Alarm beeping]",
        "Carly: It's the first thing you see in the morning.",
        "Lily: Carly, I don't know. I don't think we should say yes to this deal.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because we hardly know anything about Francoise except that she was once in business with my mother, and that is hardly a recommendation.",
        "Carly: Well, we know she's got a perfume factory, which we need. We know it's in France, which is where we want to run our operation. And it's cheap, which is all we can afford.",
        "Lily: But we can't just jump into this. We need to ask all the right questions.",
        "Carly: Let's go get the answers.",
        "Lily: Francoise, may I ask you a few questions?",
        "Francoise: Why, certainly.",
        "Lily: Why didn't things work out for you at Worldwide?",
        "Francoise: Oh. Lucinda, she's headstrong, or maybe you haven't noticed. No, no. We butted heads too many times.",
        "Carly: I can relate to that.",
        "Lily: So can I. But why come to us? I mean, why not sell your factory to another French firm?",
        "Francoise: Well, the truth is, I would like to remain involved in some capacity, and the French conglomerates who have offered to buy me out, with them, voila. I would disappear.",
        "Lily: Well, we're gonna need to see the financials for the factory.",

        "Lily: Not at the moment, no.",
        "Francoise: So, that means --",
        "Carly: It means get us the paperwork as soon as possible.",
        "Francoise: Excellent. If the numbers work for both sides, then you have a perfume factory! Congratulations to both of you.",

        "Francoise: Merci, bien.",
        "Carly: Au revoir. Did you hear that? We are manufacturers.",
        "Lily: Honey, we're better than that. We are entrepreneurs. This doesn't have anything to do with my mother.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. I know. And it has nothing to do with Jack, either.",

        "Parker: I was.",
        "Jack: What changed?",
        "Parker: Well, Mom was getting ready to buy all these things, like a fan, a microwave, linens, and I realized that these were all for classes that I'd be taking during the summer, which is boring, and I'm over it, okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's good. What's the real reason?",
        "Parker: Okay. When Mom first approached me with the idea, I really didn't care one way or the other, but then I realized, \"You know what would be great? If Liberty could come with me.\"",
        "Jack: Liberty's already graduated. Why would she be interested in a summer study program?",
        "Parker: I was thinking that Mom could get her an internship at that fashion magazine like she had before.",
        "Jack: And when did you run this by Liberty?",
        "Parker: Today I did, and she'd rather stay in town and work.",
        "Jack: Her mother's about to have a baby. It makes sense that she'd want to stick around.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and she also wants to hang around the farm with that new handyman.",

        "Liberty: You wanted to help me pay for college.",
        "Gabriel: Yes. I had enough money to get me in the game, and I thought that once I'd won, that would be like found money. Why not give that to you?",
        "Liberty: Oh, absolutely. Why not?",
        "Gabriel: Right. You know, you're a cool girl. You helped me out with Jack and the job and everything. This would just be a way of saying thank you.",
        "Liberty: And just saying thank you, well, that would have been too obvious.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: You wanted to do something impressive, something a little more macho?",
        "Gabriel: That's exactly it. Go big or go home. Look, but don't feel guilty. It's not your fault that the place got raided.",
        "Liberty: You think I need you to tell me it's not my fault? I know it's not my fault!",

        "Liberty: Are you serious? I didn't ask you to help me pay for college, and I really, really don't want you to help me pay for college. Oh, my God! What is wrong with the men in this town?",

        "Lucinda: Oh, well, yeah, we could do that.",
        "Faith: We could go somewhere exotic, like Bali or Sardinia or mango-mango.",
        "Lucinda: I think you mean Pago Pago. But, my darling, from what seems to be your complaint that's presenting itself today, you got to stay here. You can't go anywhere.",

        "Lily: Wow. That was some feat.",
        "Craig: Well, the irony is, his getting arrested may be the best thing that ever happened to us.",
        "Lily: That would be a strange statement coming from anyone else.",
        "Craig: Your message said you wanted to run something by me?",
        "Lily: Carly and I found a factory.",
        "Craig: In France, already?",
        "Lily: Yeah, and it's a perfume factory, so it's already customized.",
        "Craig: Well, let me put aside this swill. We'll get some champagne over here. There's something to celebrate.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. It may be too soon to celebrate.",
        "Craig: What's the problem?",

        "Lily: I think so. They've done business together before.",
        "Craig: Okay. What is Lucinda after?",
        "Lily: I don't know. Maybe she just wants to help. I mean, she did offer to help underwrite the project.",
        "Craig: And you refused her?",
        "Lily: Of course I did. This is my company, not hers. My mother is determined to be involved in every aspect of my life whether I like it or not.",

        "Lily: Well, I know you blame my mother for keeping you from knowing that you had a son.",
        "Craig: I blame her because it's true. I'll never forgive her for that.",
        "Lily: Well, how do you plan on punishing her for that?",
        "Craig: I don't know. I'm open to suggestions.",
        "Lily: Is that why you're working with me? Planning on getting to the mother through the daughter?",
        "Craig: Would I do that to Lucinda? In a heartbeat. But would I do it to you? Never. If you keep questioning everything I say, I'm gonna get a complex.",
        "Lily: You've misled me before, Craig, and it cost me a great deal. My mother lost her company. I don't want her running my life, but I don't want to see her get hurt either.",
        "Craig: All right. I'll admit that my loathing of Lucinda has somewhat fueled my interest in your new company.",
        "Lily: In what way?",
        "Craig: Your mother takes great pleasure in micromanaging your life. It would give me inestimable satisfaction to help you declare your independence.",
        "Lily: Me too. More than anything, I want to succeed on my own.",
        "Craig: Despite her interference? I thought we were being honest.",
        "Lily: Yes, okay? I know that she means well, but I want to do this on my own.",
        "Craig: The way I see it, we've both been victimized by her.",
        "Lily: Craig, you can't just blame my mother from keeping you from Gabriel. I'm to blame, as well.",
        "Craig: But you've done penance for that. You took me into your house when I was facing indictment. You've been nothing but kind to Gabriel. So, yes, I would love to see you separate from your mother, for your own sake.",
        "Lily: I don't want to be wrong about you.",
        "Craig: All right. If you can't bring yourself to trust me, I understand.",
        "Lily: Are we gonna have dinner tonight?",
        "Craig: Maybe some other time. I think you should take a while and just think about whether or not you believe I'm on your side.",
        "Lily: Craig, I'm sorry. You've been a friend to me, and I'm very grateful for all the help you've given us with Carlisle fragrances.",
        "Craig: Then why do you keep questioning my intentions?",
        "Lily: It's been a while since someone took me seriously, and then, when someone does, it's kind of hard to believe.",
        "Craig: Well, you're just hanging out with the wrong people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: But the men in this town are such babies. At least a foreign man would have some class and maturity.",
        "Lucinda: Babies, yeah, I know. Well, Gabriel -- Gabriel Caras, he's foreign- born. He's from Montega, but look at him.",
        "Faith: Ew. Grandma, I'm not gonna throw myself on Gabriel.",
        "Lucinda: I never said that to you. But it seems to me that I am looking at a young lady who's suffering from unrequited love.",
        "Faith: I am not.",
        "Lucinda: Then it would seem to me that you could use this time to hone your skills, you know, your wiles. Practice them on some young man that you're not interested in.",

        "Lucinda: I didn't say that, but I love it. I love it. Do it.",
        "Faith: How does that help me?",
        "Lucinda: It's practice, Darling. That's how you get to Carnegie Hall. You practice. Practice the dance.",
        "Faith: Dance?",
        "Lucinda: With him, you know? You push him away, you pull him in. Push and reel in. The dance.",
        "Faith: I don't get it. I mean, how does that work?",
        "Lucinda: It's all about technique, and, Honey, you should work on your technique.",
        "Faith: I'd rather just travel with you. We could go away and forget things.",

        "Lucinda: [Laughs]",

        "Faith: I don't know, but Gabriel's probably gonna take the job so he can be near Liberty. Everyone wants to be near Liberty.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want to be near Liberty, and I don't want Gabriel near Liberty. I want him out of town.",

        "Gabriel: I did win, okay? I just couldn't collect 'cause the cops busted me. That's all.",
        "Liberty: Well, I wouldn't have taken your money, okay? I didn't ask you to help me pay for college. All I want to do is my job at Fashions and save up and earn my own way, got it?",
        "Gabriel: I got it.",
        "Liberty: Good. Only now you've gone and ruined everything.",
        "Gabriel: How?",
        "Liberty: You destroyed any chance of Jack hiring you. He is all law and order and rules, and you're all not.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I guess I forgot to tell you the best part. Jack the cop did hire me.",
        "Liberty: What? Really? Why didn't you say so?",

        "Carly: We are?",
        "Parker: Yes. Look, Dad's right. It was irresponsible of me to make plans that hinged upon what Liberty might want to or not want to do over the summer, and Mom's right for giving me the freedom to make a mistake and learn from it. You guys understand what I'm saying?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh.",

        "Craig: Well, not this time, but maybe next time he will. And you know what? Your old man can even afford to buy one of those luxury boxes.",
        "Johnny: You're gonna buy a box?",
        "Craig: It's not a real box. What it is, is this really fun place that's really special and it's really high, and you can see everything.",

        "Craig: Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna buy one of those boxes, and I'm gonna keep it for ourselves, and then it's gonna go down to you. Everything's gonna be yours, John, yours and your brother's. By the time I get done, Lucinda Walsh might be lucky to have a seat in the bleachers. You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

        "Lily: But you know what? We are gonna take the deal.",
        "Lucinda: Are you?",
        "Lily: Yeah. We agreed that it would save us time and money, and that we'd be fools not to do it. You taught me to be many things, Mother, but a fool was not one of them.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, that's another sign of your maturity. You don't mind getting a little bit of help from your mother.",
        "Lily: But that's it. From now on, hands off. The factory will be mine and Carly's. So will the fragrance. So will all the risks and the rewards. You will have nothing to do with it. Are we clear?",
