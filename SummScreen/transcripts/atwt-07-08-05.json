        "Dusty: To old friends.",
        "Meg: With benefits.",
        "Dusty: Certainly glad you called me before you took off to Alaska, you little rascal.",
        "Meg: Well, I wanted to give you one last chance to redeem yourself.",
        "Dusty: Redemption's hard to come by.",
        "Meg: Well, I can be very forgiving.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh. What was my crime again?",
        "Meg: You blew me off for Jennifer Munson.",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you did.",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't.",
        "Meg: You left me alone in your bed to go take care of the beautiful redhead.",
        "Dusty: Business. I took off because I had to deal with business.",
        "Meg: Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "Dusty: And I feel terrible about it.",
        "Meg: Yeah? Yeah, it's just eating away at you.",
        "Dusty: It really is. And I'm here to make it up to you.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Dusty: Since tonight's your last night, I'm trying to, you know, send you off right.",
        "Meg: Really? Well, that sounds kinda nice.",
        "Dusty: \"Kinda nice\"?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Is that your word of choice?",
        "Meg: It depends. What did you have in mind?",
        "Dusty: Five-star sendoff.",
        "Meg: Wow. What if tonight really wasn't my last night in town, though?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I mean, you're leaving tomorrow, right?",
        "Meg: Well, that's the plan. Unless I get a better offer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Keith: Good to see you.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry I couldn't come by first thing today.",
        "Keith: Its okay, you called.",
        "Lily: I feel bad about standing you up.",
        "Keith: It's all right. You were with your Mother and -- how was the doctor's appointment?",
        "Lily: Brutal.",
        "Keith: Yeah. Well, maybe you need to relax little bit. I made some iced tea. And there's an additive there to kick it up a notch.",
        "Lily: Oh, oh, yes, yes. Ah, no -- I can't. I can't. I would love to, but I can't. I have to go check on the kids, and then I go back to my mom's to discuss her treatment options.",
        "Keith: How bad is it? Lily?",
        "Lily: I'm so scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Are you hungry at all? I can make you something to eat.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, no darling. I'm not hungry.",
        "Sierra: You heard the part about keeping your strength up, I hope. I mean -- I'm sorry. I was taking notes when Dr. Berg was talking.",
        "Lucinda: That wasn't necessary, darling. I'm recording.",
        "Sierra: No, it was necessary, because I won't be able to remember everything if I don't take notes. Do you want to wait till Lily gets here?",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Sierra: Well, she's coming over so that we can discuss your treatment options.",
        "Lucinda: Hmm, I don't think so. We have nothing to discuss.",
        "Sierra: Well, it would probably help, don't you think?",
        "Lucinda: I don't have many options, and they all stink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You want to give up the baby?",
        "Gwen: It'd be adopted, Will. It's not like I'm putting it on the curb.",
        "Will: I know that.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: Well, it's just that, you never said anything about wanting to do that before.",
        "Gwen: I thought about it. Look, it's what your uncle said from the beginning. Even you said that I couldn't take care of a baby where I am, on my own. So why is this such a big surprise to you?",
        "Will: Gwen, don't do this because of what I said. I was just ticked at you. You're not really gonna do this because of what other people say, are you?",
        "Gwen: No, I'm not.",
        "Will: Well, then why are you doing it? I know why. It's because of my family. You'd rather see your baby get adopted than be with a family like mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: No. No, you didn't -- you didn't come here to sleep with Katie. You came to Chicago to get away from everything.",
        "Mike: I did. But I won't lie to you.",
        "Jennifer: You -- you planned this, didn't you? You lured Mike in here somehow. You knew that we were having a fight, and you used it.",
        "Mike: No, no, Jen. This is about what we did, not Katie -- you and me.",
        "Jennifer: Of course this is about Katie. It's always about Katie!",
        "Mike: Jen?",
        "Jennifer: No, because -- because this isn't you, Mike. You don't walk out the door to think and end up in bed with someone. It hasn't even been a day.",
        "Mike: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. No, oh.",
        "Katie: Uh, let me get out of here. You two need some time.",
        "Jennifer: Did you walk out the door and call her? How long did it take?",
        "Mike: No, we didn't plan this, Jen. When I ran into her here, nobody was more surprised than I was.",
        "Jennifer: I'm supposed to believe that?",
        "Mike: I don't lie.",
        "Jennifer: You married me. What was that?",
        "Mike: I loved you, Jen. I still do.",
        "Jennifer: Then why -- why are you here? Did I really drive you to this?",
        "Mike: No, no. I would never try to make this your fault, because it's not. It's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: 'Course you're scared. But you know, it's your Mother. She's tough -- she's tougher than cancer, I think.",
        "Lily: No, I don't know about that. You know, for the first time in my life, my Mother's lost and scared, and she won't admit it.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? She'll handle it the way she needs to.",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know if she really was grasping everything the doctor was saying. She had this look in her eye of -- I gotta go. I have to go over there.",
        "Keith: Look, I'll drive you.",
        "Lily: No, you don't have to. It's okay.",
        "Keith: I want to. I want to help. I want to be there for you, okay? Come back later if you can.",
        "Lily: I'll try.",
        "Keith: Okay, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Relax, Dusty. Unless you come with a dental plan, you're in the clear.",
        "Dusty: I see. By better offer, you mean job offer?",
        "Meg: Of course.",
        "Dusty: Well, you're doing that thing again.",
        "Meg: What, messing with you?",
        "Dusty: Is that what it is?",
        "Meg: Just looking for the sparks.",
        "Dusty: I think we got 'em.",
        "Meg: You know, if you ever want to tell me, I would love to know how you got from that boy i knew to this man here.",
        "Dusty: You're probably thinking it's an ugly road?",
        "Meg: I never assume anything. Just know that I'll always be here for you. Okay, rack 'em up.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Meg: Come on. I need some traveling money.",
        "Dusty: Oh, really?",
        "Meg: So I thought I would whip you at a game of pool.",
        "Dusty: How many points do you need to start?",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Yeah, right. I don't need any handouts.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Well, I must say, you have gotten better.",
        "Meg: You know I have.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Dusty: I know you have. So how much are you really trying to hustle me for tonight, big shot?",
        "Meg: Well, it all depends on how soon I have to leave. I was thinking of spending some time with Holden and Momma. What?",
        "Dusty: Meg, staying here --",
        "Meg: Yeah?",
        "Dusty: That's a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: The train wreck the other night at my brother's place made you want to take your baby and run in another direction, didn't it?",
        "Gwen: Well, your family is special.",
        "Will: And you do mean special.",
        "Gwen: Look, Will, this decision has nothing to do with you or your family.",
        "Will: Well then, if it's money, you know that --",
        "Gwen: No, Will, stop it. It isn't yours to handle. It never was. Why did you get caught up in it in the first place? You wanted to keep Celia from finding out what a jerk Casey is? Done.",
        "Will: It wasn't just because of that.",
        "Gwen: What else is there? Oh. If the baby's gone, you don't get to play hero anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Well, every treatment has its pros and cons, but they all offer you a good chance of recovery.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, five years. Then it's even money.",
        "Sierra: Well, Dr. Berg didn't say that.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, the pathologist report said I'm third stage breast cancer. And I know perfectly well that that means the survival rate is about 50% after five years.",
        "Sierra: Mother, we've talked about this before. I mean, look at how many times you've beaten the odds, and now, this is no time to change. So I think you just have one main decision to make.",
        "Lucinda: Lumpectomy or mastectomy. Or second opinion.",
        "Sierra: Right.",
        "Lucinda: And then there's chemotherapy. Oh, that's grim. That's simple. There's no choice there.",
        "Sierra: You know, if this bravado is for my benefit, you can really just forget it.",
        "Lucinda: You don't need it, huh? I need it. It's not the surgery dear. I mean, that's easy. They take care of what they take care of. But it's the psychological ups and downs, the chemotherapy -- my, the fun of cancer. I've been, you know, reading survivor's histories. I mean, they're very interesting. If you're interested, I'll give them to you.",
        "Sierra: I am. But listen to me. There is one place that I can really help. Once Dusty knows the situation, he needs to be told.",
        "Lucinda: You've decided that?",
        "Sierra: Well, he needs to be told something. And then the two us -- well, we -- we can both handle the Worldwide situation and you can take as much time and space as you need to heal.",
        "Lucinda: Well, perhaps, my darling, I need to work to heal.",
        "Sierra: Then that's what you do. Whatever you want.",
        "Lucinda: Baby, you can't give me what I want. So I want to be alone -- just alone. Please, just leave me alone.",
        "Lily: No way in hell, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: What does that mean?",
        "Lily: You are not alone, and we will not be bullied out of the process. What happens to you happens to us -- all of us.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, honey, does that work both ways? Because let me tell you something. If it does, then I'm tired of us dating that nitwit pilot, and I'd like us to go home to our husband.",
        "Lily: You want to take potshots at my private life? You think this is the time?",
        "Lucinda: Well, honey, why the hell not? If mine is up for debate, why shouldn't yours be?",
        "Sierra: It doesn't matter. This -- this isn't what it was about. We were just discussing Mother's treatment options.",
        "Lucinda: No, we were not. That is my decision to make -- mine alone.",
        "Sierra: Of course it is. What do you want to do?",
        "Lucinda: I don't know yet.",
        "Lily: Mother, you have to -- you're having surgery. You have to have some sort of plan.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, if I have the lumpectomy, you know, and if they don't get it all, they might have to go back in again, maybe several times. If I do the mastectomy -- okay, that's one surgery. Okay, off with them! Take 'em off!",
        "Lily: They'd get all the cancer if they did that. I'm just saying that it is an option, isn't it?",
        "Lucinda: Honey -- Lily, is that what you would do if you were me? Would you go through the mastectomy? Wouldn't you worry about what your boyfriend was thinking when he looked at you?",
        "Lily: Mother, we're not talking a boyfriend.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, because it's not a consideration for me?",
        "Lily: I want you to live. Nothing else matters.",
        "Lucinda: It doesn't matter how I feel?! It doesn't matter if they're pieces of me?! I mean -- just get it all over with, then you won't have to worry.",
        "Lily: I didn't say that.",
        "Lucinda: I can hear you, baby. I've been listening to you for years. I have been your age, Lily, but you have never been mine.",
        "Sierra: Mother, wait.",
        "Lucinda: Please, darlings, please. Leave me alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Luke, what are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I wasn't playing hero -- that much. It's better than being crazy.",
        "Gwen: No, you're not crazy. You never were.",
        "Will: Don't be so sure.",
        "Gwen: Will, you're the sanest guy --",
        "Will: In my family.",
        "Gwen: That I know.",
        "Will: Well, you don't get out much.",
        "Gwen: Not true. I'm the party slut, didn't you know that?",
        "Will: Gwen, you don't have to do that.",
        "Gwen: I already did. I met with the people that wanted to adopt the baby, told them I didn't know who the father was.",
        "Will: There's people already?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. They asked about the father. I told them I did a couple guys at a party, didn't know which one got me pregnant. I don't want them trying to figure out who the father is.",
        "Will: Gwen, it's not right that people think that about you.",
        "Gwen: It's easy.",
        "Will: Doesn't make it right or true. Gwen, that's not who you are. So how'd you find these people?",
        "Gwen: I -- I found an adoption lawyer. He hooked us up. I met them. Their house was like -- was like something out of a movie. The only thing missing was the moat around the property.",
        "Will: And what were they like?",
        "Gwen: They were okay -- more than okay. The guy was okay, the woman was -- she was something. She was kind. Not in a cheesy way, but just like she's seen a lot. She'd make a good mom. And if I can -- if I can do that, if I can give her the one thing that she wants in this world, shouldn't I do it?",
        "Will: I don't know. So it's set then?",
        "Gwen: No, not yet.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: I'm supposed to think about it. They want me to be absolutely sure.",
        "Will: That's good. Are you?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. It's big.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Jen, I'd -- I'd never lie to you. Everything I said, every promise I made, I meant it. I believed what I said.",
        "Jennifer: But it wasn't true.",
        "Mike: I wanted it to be true, because I did love you.",
        "Jennifer: You never forgave me for sleeping with Craig.",
        "Mike: No, no, I did. I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't. There was no point in doing it if I just going to punish you.",
        "Jennifer: You were kinder than I deserved. But then there was the baby, and that punished you.",
        "Mike: No, that's what made -- Jennifer, I've wanted a family for a very long time, and I've been really close. And I know this wasn't picture perfect, but I thought I could make it work.",
        "Jennifer: And I just kept messing it up?",
        "Mike: No. Maybe I kept lying to myself. I thought I could make it work. I just -- I finally reached a limit.",
        "Jennifer: When? When, when I took Craig to court?",
        "Mike: It's like we were going in two different directions. And whenever that happens, it's a pretty clear indication that whatever we had just wasn't enough.",
        "Jennifer: So yesterday, you walk out. And today, you're in bed with Katie.",
        "Mike: It wasn't revenge. I wasn't trying to pay you back.",
        "Jennifer: You never stopped loving her, did you?",
        "Mike: No. It changed, but it -- it never went away.",
        "Jennifer: So where does that leave us?",
        "Mike: Jen --",
        "Jennifer: No, no. Please, Mike, we love each other. Please don't say it.",
        "Mike: I wouldn't be here if you and I had a chance.",
        "Jennifer: No, don't say that. Don't say that. We can work -- you just. Just come home.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Mike: All right, you don't look okay.",
        "Jen: Really? I wonder why.",
        "Mike: Look, Jen, just let me make sure you're okay. Maybe we can call the doctor or something.",
        "Jen: No.",

        "Mike: Katie and I shouldn't have -- this was wrong.",
        "Jennifer: That's okay, I can forgive, too. Let's just go home and --",
        "Mike: No, no. I'm sorry. I meant that it was wrong that i let anything happen with Katie before I straightened out things with you.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I got it. I can be honest with you, Mike. I knew when you walked out, it was serious. But this -- Katie? I got to tell you, that was a big surprise.",
        "[Jennifer sobbing]",
        "Mike: Wait, you don't look well.",
        "Jennifer: Really? I wonder why.",
        "Mike: Look, Jen, let me make sure you're okay. Let me call the doctor or something.",
        "Jennifer: No. I'm okay.",

        "Jennifer: No, I'm fine.",
        "Katie: Jen?",
        "Jennifer: No, I have to --",
        "Katie: No, wait, listen. I -- I know you probably don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said. Mike and I -- this truly was not planned.",
        "Jennifer: Do you honestly think that makes it any less despicable?",
        "Katie: Not now.",
        "Jennifer: Not ever. I let this happen. I made it happen.",
        "Katie: What? Whoa, wait, Jennifer, it looks like you can barely walk.",
        "Jennifer: Let me go. I'll be fine when -- good-bye, Mike.",

        "Luke: Uh, the door was open.",
        "Keith: What's up?",
        "Luke: Uh, I had to pick up some stuff that we stored up here.",
        "Keith: Oh, yeah? Oh, you playing league this summer?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Keith: Oh. Let me know when, I'll come to a game.",
        "Luke: My dad comes to the games.",
        "Keith: Yeah. Hey, you a Cubs fan?",
        "Luke: I guess.",
        "Keith: 'Cause I got a friend that's got seats right behind the dugout. And he's always flying away, he gives me the tickets all the time, so I thought maybe we could go.",

        "Meg: So you want to tell me why?",
        "Dusty: Why what?",
        "Meg: Why you think it's a bad idea for me to spend some time with Holden and my mama?",
        "Dusty: Because you used to go nuts with your mama.",
        "Meg: Well, we still love each other.",
        "Dusty: The way they were with you, you were never happy.",
        "Meg: Well, we've all grown up. Your shot.",
        "Dusty: Believe me, you don't want to pass up a job opportunity to hang out at Emma's. You'd be fighting within a week. Then what?",
        "Meg: You know, you don't need to worry about me, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to be your friend. I'm your friend.",
        "Meg: And?",
        "Dusty: A friend would tell a friend, get on with it. Get on with your life.",
        "Meg: Well, who says I need to leave town to get on with my life?",
        "Dusty: Maybe you don't. I'm just saying. You probably won't find what you're looking for here. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Where are you at this very moment?",
        "Meg: I'm at Yo's, playing pool.",
        "Lucinda: Yo's? Oh, that's just wonderful. Rack up a cue for me!",
        "Meg: Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I could still keep it.",
        "Will: Yeah, you could, and I'd be there for you. I'd be there to help -- even though you threw me out and said you didn't want my help, which i know you didn't mean.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you're so sure?",
        "Will: Well, you just saw my family, and you were freaked out about what you were getting yourself into.",
        "Gwen: That's not why I called the adoption lawyer. I did that 'cause I read the pamphlet that your uncle made me. I sat down, and I read every single word, and all of a sudden, it made perfect sense. This is the best solution for everybody.",
        "Will: If you're sure. What?",
        "Gwen: It's so huge.",

        "Gwen: You know, when I went to court to get rid of my parents, I didn't think twice about it, because I knew it was right for me. But this is different. And I remember, I thought to myself, I thought -- this is the most monumental thing that I'll do until I'm like 30, even if I go to college, or the band gets picked up, whatever. Because I'm my own person now. But these are -- these are other people. This is a baby that nobody knows. How could you be sure that it's the right thing?",

        "Luke: Doubtful.",
        "Teen: #1: Well, what's left? We could cruise the food court at the mall.",

        "Mike: Katie, hey --",
        "Katie: Oh, before that knock on the door, I felt like I had finally come home. I mean, how many times did I dream that we would be together again? Then we were, it was like, happening for real. I could feel you breathing, and I could hear your heartbeat. But now, after this, how can this be happy?",
        "Mike: All I know right now is that we belong together.",
        "Katie: But you love Jennifer. Mike, you do. After court, when you told me to stay away from you, you were totally, completely with her. What happened?",

        "Lucinda: I'm never going to hear that word again the same way, am I?",
        "Meg: No, you won't. So why are you here? To play pool instead of telling your family?",
        "Lucinda: Please, don't be sanctimonious. We were at the hospital together. Sierra's taking the copious notes. I'm secretly taping it. Lily's -- her eyes are glazing over. I love them! But they can't help me. They can't help me.",

        "Lucinda: I'm leaning towards the lumpectomy. You know, a nice, honest lumpectomy. And it's going to be more testing and then maybe more surgery, but at least it's going to be incremental. It's going to take some time.",
        "Meg: Well, you won't have much time to do anything else, so you can take your time.",

        "Meg: Would you offer dental?",
        "Lucinda: Hey, honey, I'll put my thought on the contract. Hey, are you doing this for me, or is it my daughters, or for the guy on the phone outside?",

        "Lily: Well, it isn't official. Technically -- I couldn't. I couldn't do that to everybody with everything that's going on. Once my Mother's treatments are over and everything's on an even keel, then. Trust me, this is what I want. It has nothing to do the two of us. I just need a little time.",
