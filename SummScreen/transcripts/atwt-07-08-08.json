        "Carly: Hello. Come in. I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm running late.",
        "Neal: And I'm a bit early. Obviously, we're made for each other.",
        "Carly: I just need a few more minutes to get myself together. Can I offer you something to drink while you wait?",
        "Neal: I'd love a glass of water, if you don't mind.",
        "Carly: No. Not at all.",
        "Neal: I can get it. Just finish getting dressed. Point me in the direction of the kitchen. Your forks and knives are safe. I'm only short on spoons.",
        "Carly: Kitchen is through there. Glasses are above the sink.",
        "Neal: Excellent. If I get lost, I'll send you an S.O.S.",
        "Jack: Hello. Anybody home?",
        "Neal: Excuse me. Where I'm from, when you go around to someone's house, it's customary to knock before letting yourself in. Perhaps it's different here in the states.",
        "Jack: Perhaps, 'cause here in the states, we just say, \"Who the hell are you?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Seem like you're a million miles away. This number's not holding your attention?",
        "Holden: No. Not really.",
        "Lily: You want to talk about it? I mean, I could start guessing, but it could take a while.",
        "Holden: It's just a bunch of things.",
        "Lily: Like?",
        "Holden: Mm -- Meg, for one. She's going to be marrying Paul. I gave her my blessing to do it. I don't know why I would do that.",
        "Lily: You were being a good brother. You were doing what she asked you to do.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but sometimes, you just know that some things are doomed. I should have done what I could to try and stop it. If I had, I wouldn't be feeling this way.",
        "Lily: What, guilty? Holden, this isn't your fault. When two people want to be together, I mean, you should know, they'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.",
        "Holden: You know what? Maybe she's out at the farm. I should go out there and try to talk to her. And plus, I've got some chores that I need to do anyway. So --",
        "Lily: No. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul? Paul?! Paul! Paul? Paul, hey.",
        "Paul: Hey. You okay?",
        "Meg: I -- I woke up. You weren't there. I didn't know where you were.",
        "Paul: Right here. You all right?",
        "Meg: Why didn't you wake me?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You were tossing and turning all night. I thought I'd let you get some rest.",
        "Meg: What's this? Where were you?",
        "Paul: I was outside. I got some rose bushes delivered this morning. Wanted to get them in the ground right away.",
        "Meg: I don't understand. Why didn't you just ask the gardeners? You bought roses to cover the place where Sofie's --",
        "Paul: Meg --",
        "Meg: Where you buried her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neal: My name is Neal Stokes.",
        "Jack: Just a few more questions, Neal, if you don't mind. What are you -- what are you doing here?",
        "Neal: I was invited.",
        "Jack: For?",
        "Neal: How does that concern you exactly?",
        "Jack: Because this is my house.",
        "Neal: Oh. You're Carly's ex-husband. That explains it.",
        "Jack: Maybe for you, but considering my son could have walked through that door instead of me, I'd really like to know what business you have here.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Neal. I could use a little h -- help. Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: I didn't know you were stopping by.",
        "Jack: No kidding.",
        "Carly: I see you two have met. That's good.",
        "Neal: You needed help with something?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'm just having a problem with the clasp.",
        "Jack: I got it.",
        "Neal: Oh, and Jack, my business here is strictly pleasure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: If there was anything that Meg thought you could do, I'm sure she would call you.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I -- I have to do something. I -- I can't --",
        "Meg: You can't what?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lily: Listen, maybe you should just let Meg figure this thing out with Paul on her own. Besides, there's somebody that needs you more right now than she does.",
        "Holden: Who?",
        "Lily: Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Mike, I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Mike: Then I'll talk. I promise this won't take long. Look, I -- I know how you feel about Sofie, but I'm worried about her.",
        "Barbara: I have no intention of discussing Sofie with you.",
        "Mike: I went to see her, all right, and they said she checked out. No one knows where she went, if she's coming back. Do you know anything about this?",
        "Barbara: As a matter of fact, I do. Sofie is long gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Which one?",
        "Paul: Which one what?",
        "Meg: Which one of the rose bushes is she --?",
        "Paul: Okay, let's get you away from this window. Come on. It's just a garden, Meg. It's just landscaping.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and now it's a cemetery.",
        "Paul: You need to stop it. No one's gonna know. No one's gonna think anything. Everybody's just gonna think that -- that Sofie left town.",
        "Meg: But someone murdered her. How do you expect me to act like I don't know that? And what are -- what are we doing? We -- we just buried her. We have to go to the police.",
        "Paul: And tell them what?",
        "Meg: What really happened to Sofie.",
        "Paul: We are not going to the police.",
        "Meg: We have to.",
        "Paul: No. What we have to do is put all of this behind us.",
        "Meg: We're talking about a real person, Paul -- a real person!",
        "Paul: If we go to the police, we open ourselves up to a whole bunch of questions that we don't have the answers to. Now, you didn't hurt Sofie.",
        "Meg: No, I didn't!",
        "Paul: And I didn't hurt her either. But everybody knows that we had a million reasons to get her out of our way! She accused me of rape. She tried to kill my mother.",
        "Meg: Okay, and who killed her? Who killed Sofie?",
        "Paul: I don't think that even matters!",
        "Meg: I don't want to even hear this now.",
        "Paul: Wait a second. It doesn't matter because I moved the body, Meg. I -- I played around with a crime scene. You combine that with -- with all of my motives --",
        "Meg: And you really think it's that impossible to come forward and try to explain?",
        "Paul: I know how this town works. I know that Jack and Margo and Dallas and of them -- they're never gonna believe that anybody did this but me.",
        "Meg: I'm not gonna let you take this on alone.",
        "Paul: No. You're staying out of this. You tell them what you know, and all of the sudden, you're an accomplice to -- to everything that I've done.",
        "Meg: How did this happen?",
        "Paul: I made a mistake, and I panicked. I'm sorry. I was just trying to protect you.",
        "Meg: I know, Paul. What I still don't understand is you say you love me. You're gonna marry me. How could you even, for one minute, think that I am capable of murder?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: No one can convince me that Sofie would leave town on her own volition when she's in love with Paul.",
        "Barbara: She's not in love with Paul. She's obsessed with Paul. That's why the lies that she was spreading --",
        "Mike: Hold on. You know just as well as I do that not everything Sofie was saying was a lie.",
        "Barbara: Are you talking about her pregnancy?",
        "Mike: I'm talking about your grandchild. Do you not even care?",
        "Barbara: I care more about my children than you could ever realize, young man.",
        "Mike: Now would be a great time to start proving that.",
        "Barbara: You had better drop this, Mike. It's been handled.",
        "Mike: What do you mean, \"It's been handled\"? Handled how? Barbara, talk to me, or I'm gonna start making a lot of noise.",
        "Barbara: You know what? Paul gave Sofie a lot of money -- enough to take care of her and the baby. That's all she was after.",
        "Mike: No, that doesn't make any sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When I found Sofie, she was lying on the ground, and the syringe was next to her, and she said your name.",
        "Meg: So you just jumped to the conclusion that I killed her and your unborn child?",
        "Paul: For all I know, she attacked you. You were just defending yourself.",
        "Meg: That's when you started to cover up for me?",
        "Paul: I know that Sofie was out to get you, and I wouldn't put it past her to use her unborn child to try and hurt you.",
        "Meg: By reminding me that she could give you something that I couldn't -- a child. You know, you were right. She did know how to get to me. But you know what, Paul? I'm also a nurse. I could never bring myself to hurting someone -- not even Sofie. Look, I know why you did what you did for me. I just wish you hadn't.",
        "Paul: Doesn't need to be anything more than just a garden. But if you can't live with that, if you need for me to go to the police, then I will. It's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, you told me to be honest with you, and that's what I'm doing. I need you to stay here. I need you to talk to me.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I -- I want that, too. But, uh, you know, I just -- I got a lot on my mind.",
        "Lily: I know for a long time that you've had to work things out on your own because I wasn't there for you, but I -- I need you to see that I'm here now. You don't need to do that anymore.",
        "Holden: I do see that.",
        "Lily: We've worked so hard to get back here, and we're in such a good place. I want to stay here.",
        "Holden: And I want that, too.",
        "Lily: Then don't shut me out. I need to be able to talk to you. I mean, it's as simple as that. We both know that the alternative is going back to where we started and living separate lives. I don't think either one of us wants that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you have a reason for dropping by?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I wanted to bring you this. It's a letter from our daughter.",
        "Carly: Oh, it's Sage. She's our youngest. She's at camp for the first time this summer. And she's horseback riding, and she's loving it. She just got over a fear of horses.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You can thank Holden for that.",
        "Carly: I -- I think that you'll see him before I do.",
        "Neal: You're lucky. Not only do you have kids, but to be able to send them away -- best of both worlds, if you ask me.",
        "Jack: She's at camp, Neal. She's not at boarding school. She'll be back.",
        "Carly: That's not what he meant, Jack.",
        "Neal: Not at all. I always thought having kids was a grand adventure. But I suppose that's because I don't have any of my own -- yet.",
        "Jack: So, how did the two of you meet? I -- I didn't quite get that part.",
        "Neal: Over at the Snyder farm.",
        "Jack: Oh, my, my Aunt Emma's farm. Yes. How about that?",
        "Carly: Yes. Neal -- he owns the company that's doing the subdivision out there.",
        "Neal: It's a beautiful piece of land.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Let's hope it stays that way.",
        "Carly: I really don't think you have to worry. He already has your family's seal of approval.",
        "Jack: Whose?",
        "Carly: Holden and Lily's. They, um -- they sort of set this up, uh, this lunch.",
        "Jack: Really? Great.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is. Neal, we should go.",
        "Neal: As you wish.",
        "Carly: And Jack, since you let yourself in, you can let yourself out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what? You're absolutely right. And I need to start taking my own advice. I need to start focusing my attention on where it should be -- on us.",
        "Lily: Good. Let's go have lunch. We can talk about anything you want, nothing you don't, and then we can head over to the farm. If Meg's there, you can see her, and we can do those chores for your mom.",
        "Holden: Sounds good. Let me just get my keys.",
        "Lily: Sounds good. [Knock on door] Jack, hi.",
        "Jack: Got a bone to pick with you.",
        "Lily: Me?",
        "Jack: How could you hook Carly up with that guy?",
        "Lily: What? Neal?",
        "Jack: The Englishman I found in my living room? Yeah. What -- what are you thinking, Lily? The last thing Carly needs right now is to be hooked up with some smooth-talking guy with an accent who thinks he can sweep her off her feet.",
        "Lily: Whoa! Neal is not Simon, Jack. Holden, are you hearing this?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I -- I am. And I couldn't agree more.",
        "Jack: And don't think you're off the hook either, Buddy. Carly told me all about you. Oh, yeah. She said you both were behind it.",
        "Lily: No. Holden didn't have anything to do with it. I was the one that urged Carly to accept Neal's lunch offer.",
        "Jack: Why? Why would you do that?",
        "Lily: Because I thought it would be nice for her to meet someone new.",
        "Jack: Lily, it wasn't too long ago you wanted Carly back with me.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and you don't want to be with her, so what do you expect her to do?",
        "Jack: Okay. I know she's gonna start dating again. But with this guy? Come on.",
        "Lily: Sound jealous, Jack.",
        "Jack: I am not. I am not jealous. No, I'm concerned for my family. What if Parker walked in and saw his mom hanging out with a complete stranger? What do you even know about this guy?",
        "Lily: Neal? Um, he's smart, he's handsome, he's funny, he's single, he's wealthy.",
        "Jack: Bully, bully, bully for him. I just don't think that Carly's ready to be involved with anyone, not given everything she's been through.",
        "Lily: I don't disagree. You know, when Neal originally asked her out, she practically fell apart. I wonder whose fault that is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neal: I'm so pleased you reconsidered my invitation.",
        "Carly: Me, too.",
        "Neal: So, I take it Jack is the reason you turned me down at first?",
        "Carly: Um -- I probably shouldn't have made such a big deal over lunch.",
        "Neal: Lunch date. This is a date. Make no mistake of that.",
        "Carly: Duly noted.",
        "Neal: So, were you worried Jack wouldn't approve?",
        "Carly: Jack probably wouldn't approve of most of the things that I choose to do. No, he's not the reason I hesitated.",
        "Neal: What was it? Was it me? It was, wasn't it? You can say it.",
        "Carly: No. No, it's just getting back out there. Dating can be awkward.",
        "Neal: I can understand that.",
        "Carly: Come on. You've probably never had an awkward moment in your life.",
        "Neal: Don't be so sure of that. I remember what it was like, dating, being married, having to start over.",
        "Carly: You were married?",
        "Neal: Hey. I'm quite a catch, as you Americans would say. I was married for a number of years. But this is the first time since I've been single again that I've met a woman that's completely captivated me.",
        "Carly: Well, who is she? I'll -- I'll try to put in a good word for you.",
        "Neal: Would you, please? I fear she doesn't take my intentions all that seriously.",
        "Carly: You know, if I have somehow captivated you, it must have been some marriage.",
        "Neal: It was. I loved my wife very much. She was the greatest joy I've ever known.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Neal: She died a couple of years ago -- breast cancer.",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry.",
        "Neal: Thank you. For a minute there, we thought we might get lucky. I wouldn't trade any of it in for anything.",
        "Carly: Sounds like what you had was very special.",
        "Neal: It was, which is why I'm not willing to settle for anything less than a passionate, knock-your-socks-off, cue-the-music love.",
        "Carly: You expect a lot out of a date.",
        "Neal: No more than I'm willing to give. But no pressure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Do you still care about Carly?",
        "Jack: That is a silly question. Of course I do.",
        "Lily: Then you should let her have this. Jack, you got to let her have a chance at a life without you.",
        "Jack: She can have whatever life she wants! I'm not gonna stand in her way. Listen, Lily, I read people. It's what I do for a living. And this guy -- I can guarantee you, along with the suits and the cheerio attitude, he's got a woman stashed at every building site from here to shanghai.",
        "Lily: You got all that from a \"Cheerio\"? Whoo! You are good, Jack.",
        "Jack: What dates? What dates that you know of start with the guy seeing his date in a robe?",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Jack: Yeah, robe -- robe. Carly, proving once again that her taste in men -- not too good.",
        "Lily: Well, do you trust mine? Because I think Neal might actually be good for her. Will you talk some sense into your cousin? Tell him to leave Carly alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Is it possible she did it to herself?",
        "Paul: That she killed herself?",
        "Meg: No. That this was an accident. You said you found her on the floor with the syringe next to her. Is it possible that she injected herself and then was counting on you to find her in time?",
        "Paul: No. I don't think so. She might have done something like that before, but she wouldn't have just been playing with her own life. I don't think Sofie would do anything to harm the baby.",
        "Meg: Okay, then who? Who else would want Sofie dead?",
        "Barbara: Oh, good. You're both here. I have the most wonderful news. I've done it. I've solved all your problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: If you're looking for Neal, he left a while ago. Said he had plans for lunch.",
        "Mike: Uh, no. Actually, I'm -- I'm here for another reason. Uh, I'm looking for Sofie Duran. She used to work here. Do you know her?",
        "Kelly: The one who had that jewelry line?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, that's her. She worked out of Barbara Ryan's office, right? Do you know if she left any personal affects behind?",
        "Kelly: Matter of fact, she did? I've been waiting for her to come get them.",
        "Mike: Do you mind if I take a look? Thank you. You're a lifesaver.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: By the look on your faces, you haven't heard the good news. Sofie's gone.",
        "Meg: Gone?",
        "Barbara: Gone. She's left Oakdale for good. I couldn't be happier. What's wrong with you two? I thought you'd be thrilled.",
        "Meg: Uh, how -- how do you know this?",
        "Barbara: She checked out of the Lakeview. No one's seen her. Mike hasn't seen her.",
        "Meg: Mike is looking for her?",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't worry. He'll never find her. No, the point is, there's nothing standing in your way. You can get married. I'm making the arrangements right now. We'll do it this afternoon, right here at the house.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa. Hold on. There's still -- there's a lot of things for us to consider.",
        "Barbara: There's nothing to consider. Honey, you love each other. If it weren't for Sofie, you'd be on your honeymoon right now. I told you I was gonna make this happen for you, Meg.",
        "Meg: You -- you did this for me?",
        "Barbara: For you, and Paul. So, hurry up and get ready. I've got a wedding to pull off.",
        "Paul: Hey, nobody here has said yes.",
        "Barbara: There is nothing to discuss, Paul. Come on. Get yourselves ready. I'll be back in a little while. I'll have all the arrangements made. I'll get this show on the road.",
        "Meg: No. There's -- there's no way.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. We both know what my mother is capable of.",
        "Meg: Not this.",
        "Paul: She is dangerous when she's frightened. And after what Sofie did to her --",
        "Meg: Uh, we could never prove it.",
        "Paul: She didn't need proof. Sofie tried to kill her, and then Sofie committed crime number two by trying to keep you and I apart. My mother fought back. That's why Sofie's dead.",
        "(Beeping)",
        "Meg: Hey. Where have you been? I was worried about you.",
        "Paul: I was off, wishing that everything were different. Guess we both know who my mother is.",
        "Meg: Okay, there's one thing that doesn't make sense. The baby Sofie was carrying -- it was her grandchild.",
        "Paul: My mother had no attachment to that child. It wasn't even real.",
        "Meg: Was it real to you?",
        "Paul: I only found out that I was a father a few days ago, and then I didn't believe it was mine. No, I -- I don't think I did have a connection with that kid. In my heart, I never felt like a father. And whatever I felt, believe me, my mother felt less. She wanted Sofie out of our lives, and nothing was gonna stop her.",
        "Meg: Okay, so what do we do now?",
        "Paul: Well, we can't go to the police, because if I do manage to convince them that I didn't kill Sofie, they're just gonna move on to the next logical suspect, and I can't do that to my mom.",

        "Lily: Then you don't really have a say in who she goes out with.",
        "Jack: Oh, right, yeah. She's just my ex-wife, and they're just my kids. Yeah. What say do I have in any of it?",
        "Lily: Oh, Jack -- fantastic.",
        "Holden: He's entitled to his opinion.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and so am I. And as Carly's friend, I think you would want her to be with someone that makes her happy, too, even if it's not your cousin.",

        "Carly: Uh -- I've committed a few felonies, told a few lies, broken the heart of a good man, more than once.",

        "Paul: Well, who could blame you after you found out about the baby?",
        "Meg: The baby wouldn't have changed how much I love you. Nothing could do that.",

        "Cole: You don't know Sofie too well, do you? Listen, Mike, you sound like a nice guy. Which is too bad, because she clearly played you. I know she comes off as all sweet and innocent, and in a way, it's kind of hot, but it's all an act. She can take care of herself. She just wants you to think she can't.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Cole: Wake up. You've been scammed, Man. Don't feel too bad. It happened to me, too. It's how we met. She's a hustler.",

        "Meg: Garden?",

        "Paul: But this is not what we wanted -- not even close.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you will make of this day whatever you want.",
        "Paul: How are we supposed to forget how we got here?",
        "Barbara: Because once you are married, it won't even matter, Paul. Now, I agree that -- that maybe my tactics were a little bit aggressive, but I was just trying to make sure that you had the future that you want.",
        "Paul: Really? At what price?",

        "Meg: No doubts.",
        "Paul: Well, I don't like how we got here, but -- we can steal anything we need from today from our wedding. We can make our lives whatever we want them to be.",
        "Meg: How can we do that? How can we just stand over Sofie's grave?",
        "Paul: I do wish that Sofie were still alive. But my mother did what she did to protect us, and we have to do whatever we have to to protect her, right? I'll see you downstairs.",

        "Neal: Well, if he hadn't answered all my prying questions about Carly, I would never have had the opportunity to have lunch with her today.",
        "Lily: You were responsible for that? Well, how was your lunch?",
        "Neal: We had a great time.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's fantastic. See? I told you Jack had nothing to worry about.",
        "Neal: Jack's your cousin, right?",
        "Holden: That's right.",

        "Carly: Paperwork?!",

        "Jack: Is that -- is that a problem?",
        "Carly: So, where is all this paperwork you're working so hard on?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I finished. I just wanted to catch up on some, uh -- some scores.",

        "Mike: I'm not trying to start something. I've just been trying to figure out what happened to her.",
        "Paul: Mike, stop! You see that man over there, standing next to my mother? He's a judge, and he's here because he's marrying us. And I would really appreciate if you could give us some peace.",
        "Mike: You're getting married? Meg, is this what you want? Meg, answer me -- is he forcing you to do this?",
        "Paul: Nobody's forcing Meg to do anything.",
        "Mike: You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Just say the word --",
        "Meg: I know what I'm doing, Mike! I love Paul. I want to marry him.",
        "Mike: Th -- this is crazy. When you found out about Sofie and the baby, you were devastated. You didn't want anything to do with Paul ever again.",
        "Paul: Mike, you got your answer. Now you need to leave.",
        "Meg: Paul, please.",
        "Mike: Hey, look, he's gonna be connected with Sofie forever. He's having a child with her. Can you live with that?",

        "Lily: Oh, don't look at me like that.",
        "Holden: You know what? The last time you tried to play matchmaker over dinner, it blew up in your face. Jack was miserable, Carly had way too much to drink, and it was a disaster.",
        "Lily: This time, it's gonna be different.",
        "Holden: How do you know that?",

        "Jack: Janet's different.",
        "Carly: No kidding. So why is it whatever you do gets a free pass? Why do the rules only apply to me?",

        "Lily: Carly can say no if she wants to. You know, I don't understand. Are you worried about betraying Jack if you have Carly over to our house with another man? Because don't. I mean, Carly deserves to be with someone who accepts her for who she is. Jack can't. So if Neal can, I say she should go for it and we should support her.",

        "Jack: Don't you get it? I'm looking out for you because I care about you, Carly?",
        "Carly: No, Jack, you're doing surveillance because you don't trust me. You can't keep punishing me for things I did when you and I were together. It's not fair.",
        "Jack: No. No, it's not. But when I see you with guys like Neal --",
        "Carly: Neal isn't the problem. You are.",
        "Jack: Well, if he's gonna be around the kids --",
        "Carly: He hasn't been around the kids! Who says he's gonna be around the kids? You're suffocating me, and it has to stop. I'm not gonna hurt the children again. I shouldn't have to keep trying to convince you of that.",
        "Jack: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: I let you go. That's what you wanted me to do. Now you have to do the same for me.",
