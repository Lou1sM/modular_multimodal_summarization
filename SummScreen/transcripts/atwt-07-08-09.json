        "[Carly scoffs]",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Rosanna: Looking for this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Margo, is it me, or do these flowers look like they're wilting?",
        "Margo: No, they're fine, Craig. And the sidewalks are perfectly swept for Carly's dainty feet. The skies are pristinely clear, and not a drop of moisture is going to fall on your fair bride's fair head.",
        "Craig: Can I get that in writing?",
        "Margo: Now you're micromanaging.",
        "Craig: It's for my bride. Some women might think that's romantic.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, you didn't wake those women up at the crack of dawn to help you.",
        "Craig: Text from the caterer.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Craig: She's on her way.",
        "Margo: Good.",
        "Craig: All right, now -- bridal bouquet, boutonnieres in the fridge?",
        "Margo: Check.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Craig: Tom's gone to get the judge?",
        "Margo: Yes, Sir, yes, Sir, Mr. Groom, Sir.",
        "Craig: This would go a lot faster if you didn't make fun of me.",
        "Margo: Well, that's not going to happen. Now, why are you here? Isn't this Carly's job?",
        "Craig: Carly's got a lot on her mind. This is my gift to her. Now, what am I forgetting?",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: Manners, patience, champagne? I mean, how could you leave champagne off your checklist?",
        "Craig: I decided we're going to have an alcohol-free wedding.",
        "Margo: What?! Why?!",
        "Craig: There will be a lot of children around. They'll feel more included that way.",
        "Margo: Wow, that's -- that's considerate. That's -- that's responsible. That's downright likeable.",
        "Craig: Thanks to Carly. Speaking of whom, I'm going to go make sure she's got everything she needs.",
        "Margo: No, no, you're not. You can't see the bride before the wedding.",
        "Craig: Margo, today is the day I'm marrying the woman of my dreams. Bad luck would not dare rear its ugly head today.",
        "[Margo chuckles]",
        "[Craig blows]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I found this, uh, in your oven.",
        "Carly: What was it doing in there?",
        "Rosanna: Carly, I just saw you looking for it.",
        "Carly: I wasn't. I was going to bake something. I was feeling so guilty about yelling at Sage like I did last night that I was going to make her -- uh, her favorite cupcakes.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: Like you made your wedding dress?",
        "Carly: Are you still harping on that? Come on, how many brides make their own wedding dresses, huh?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. How many brides hide vodka in the oven? You put it there, didn't you?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Yeah, I did. I -- I stashed it there in case of an emergency, but I've completely stopped drinking.",
        "Rosanna: Stopped drinking? I --why is this the first I'm hearing of this?",
        "Carly: Because it's over. And it's been over for weeks. I realized I was drinking a little too much, and I gave it up.",
        "Rosanna: Until now?",
        "Carly: Well, this is my wedding day. It's a special occasion. Nothing wrong with a little prenuptial cocktail, right? Would you care to join me? It'll be my official farewell to alcohol.",
        "Rosanna: You think you can quit just like that?",
        "Carly: Sure, just like that. I mean, there's no more alcohol in the house.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: Maybe because you drank it all.",
        "[Rosanna chuckling]",
        "Carly: No, Rosanna. Because I got rid of it.",
        "[Bottles clattering]",
        "Rosanna: I think you missed a few.",
        "Carly: Where did you get those?",
        "Rosanna: They were all over the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, you look like a princess.",
        "Sage: I hate this dress. And I don't want to go.",
        "Janet: Yeah, I seem to recall there was a time when you weren't too thrilled that I was marrying your dad.",
        "Sage: I was younger then. I'm okay with you now.",
        "Janet: Oh, gee, thanks. See, if there's hope for me, who knows, you just might learn to like Craig, too.",
        "Jack: What's on your mind, Sage? Well, if you don't tell me what's bothering you, how can we fix it?",
        "Sage: When Mom marries Craig, is she going to go away again?",
        "Jack: Not in a million years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I really did stop drinking.",
        "Rosanna: Really?",
        "Carly: Really. It wasn't even that hard. It's just we got into this -- this crazy time crunch with the wedding, and I just needed a little something to help me relax.",
        "Rosanna: There's more than a little something in that bag, Carly, don't you think?",
        "Carly: I -- I'd forgotten about those. Those -- those are from before.",
        "Rosanna: Why did you hide them?",
        "Carly: People were giving me a hard time about having a drink or two to take the edge off. So I thought it best to keep it quiet.",
        "Rosanna: So you're drinking in secret? That's not healthy, Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm fine. Have you seen me drunk since you've been staying here?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I have to say honestly that I have noticed that something is definitely wrong.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Craig: Hello! Door was open. Anybody here?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Carly: Don't you tell Craig.",
        "Rosanna: You're about to marry that man. If you have a problem, don't you think he should know?",
        "Craig: Carly?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Craig: There's my beautiful bride.",
        "Carly: Here she is.",
        "[Carly chuckling]",
        "Craig: Aw.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Craig: Mmm.",
        "Carly: You should not be here. It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. You know that.",
        "Craig: Oh, didn't I tell you? I'm not doing superstitions today. Hello, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: You're looking even more stern than ever. Didn't know that was possible. Everything all right?",
        "Rosanna: Actually, Carly and I were just having a discussion.",
        "Carly: We were talking about how late it's getting. And, look, Rosanna's completely ready, and I haven't even started, so you're going to make me late.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not leaving without my best man. I came to get Parker.",
        "Carly: Would you round him up, please? Please?",
        "Rosanna: Certainly.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Craig: Things seem a little tense with you and your sister. Are you sure everything's okay?",
        "Carly: It's fine. Why wouldn't it be? You handled all the details. All I have to do is get dressed.",
        "Craig: I want everything to be perfect.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Carly: Oh, speaking of details, did you get the present for Margo?",
        "Craig: For letting us use her house? She's my sister. She can't wait to help.",
        "Carly: She just got out of the hospital, Craig. She was shot.",
        "Craig: And she's never looked better.",
        "Carly: Craig! All right. I'll thank her profusely for opening her house and home.",
        "Carly: And?",
        "Craig: And I'll get her a gift. Can't we get through our own wedding day without you giving me a hard time?",
        "Carly: No, this is what you signed up for. I'm going to be on your case for the rest of your life, pal.",
        "Craig: I'm counting on it. Till death do us part. What took you two so long?",
        "Rosanna: Windsor-knot emergency.",
        "Craig: Ah, handled with aplomb. You ready?",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah, let's roll. See you guys.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, wait, wait. Come here.",
        "[Carly clicks tongue]",
        "Carly: Mmm. Devastatingly handsome. Thank you for always being there for me.",
        "Parker: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Craig: We're going to pick up Johnny and then go straight to Margo's. I'm counting on you to get my bride to the altar on time. And you --",
        "Carly: Hmm?",
        "Craig: I just adore you.",
        "Carly: Mmm. Whatever.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Thank you. This is a very special day, and I don't want anything to spoil it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, the day's not over yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Sage, this isn't like the last time, with Simon.",
        "Sage: How do you know? Mom went away with him because she loved him. And if she's marrying Craig, she must love him, too.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Sage: So if he wants to go away, she'll go with him.",
        "Jack: But that's where you're wrong, 'cause Craig's not going anywhere, even though I can't tell you how many times I wish he would.",
        "Sage: You said we weren't supposed to say anything mean.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know. Force of habit. Your mother's not going anywhere either, Honey. She would never leave you kids. What even put that thought into your head?",
        "Sage: She's different. The way she acts --",
        "Jack: You're going to have to give me a little bit more to go on.",
        "Sage: She didn't make my dress. She bought it, and she never does that.",
        "Jack: She bought you that dress? Horrors! The next thing you know, she'll be feeding you cat food and making you sleep in a crawlspace under the stairs.",
        "Sage: We don't have a crawlspace under the stairs.",
        "Jack: Whew! That was close.",
        "Sage: And last night, she yelled at me. She never does that either.",
        "Jack: Yes, Honey, but she apologized, remember? And you accepted her apology? Okay, well, that means you can't hold a grudge. And you did say that you were going to go to this wedding. That was kind of like a promise.",
        "Sage: I guess. You promise that she won't go away with Craig somewhere and decide to live there for the rest of her life?",
        "Jack: Sage, the last time Mommy went away, she learned a very valuable lesson.",
        "Sage: What?",
        "Jack: That she can't live without you kids, no matter what.",
        "Sage: But what if Craig really, really wants to go away someplace? She might just do what he wants because that's what people do when they're in love.",
        "Jack: Yes, okay. Well, the love you have for your kids is different. It's forever, even when they write on your walls with a permanent marker.",
        "Sage: I was two, Dad.",
        "Jack: Yes and the pain lingers on. You feel better?",
        "Sage: You know, even if Mom loves Craig, she still loves you, too.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Honey, I don't know about that.",
        "Sage: I do. You can just tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, the groom and his men. Come in, please. How you doing, Parker?",
        "Parker: I'm okay. Is anyone else here?",
        "Margo: Just the caterers.",
        "[Margo gasps]",
        "Margo: Johnny, look at you! You look so suave and debonair. Do you even know what that means? No. It means that you look really good.",
        "Johnny: Oh.",
        "Craig: Johnny, your aunt just gave you a compliment. What do you say?",
        "Johnny: I'm hungry.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Craig: I think we'll have a better chance at getting a thank you after he eats. Parker, would you see if the caterers have anything for him?",
        "Parker: Sure. Come on, John. Let's get some food.",
        "[Margo chuckles]",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Craig: This is for you.",
        "Margo: What? Well, you're the one who's getting married. I should be giving you a gift.",
        "Craig: Well, it's from Carly and me. We just wanted to say thank you for letting us use your house to get married in today. You've really gone above and beyond the call of duty, even for sisterhood.",
        "Margo: Well, damn straight, I have. But, you know, I kind of liked it.",
        "Craig: Even though you just got out of the hospital?",
        "Margo: Oh, that old thing is just a bullet wound.",
        "[Margo chuckles]",
        "Margo: I'm fine.",
        "Craig: How about the other wound? We haven't talked about Adam at all yet.",
        "Margo: I didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Craig: Okay. Well, I thought this might be help.",
        "Margo: Hmm. Well, it's really not necessary. Very sweet, but -- oh, picture frame.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I thought you might want to have a picture of Adam on your desk at work.",
        "Margo: Um, well, thank you. Thank you.",
        "Craig: When Bryant died, it was difficult for me to look at any recent photos of him. But there was one, just he and I. We were fishing. He was only about Johnny's age. And that -- that gave me some good memories. It's devastating to lose a child, Margo. I'm so sorry it happened to you.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry it happened to you. But I've found a way to handle it. Yes, I have. Thanks.",
        "Parker: Hey, um, the caterer said there isn't any food ready. Besides, Johnny wants cheese fries.",
        "Craig: Oh, can you wait a while for that, buddy? Margo, do you have any fruit to hold him over or something?",
        "Parker: Actually, I was thinking, we have a while before everything starts. Why don't I take Johnny down to Al's and get him cheese fries? And I can have him back here in time for the wedding.",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't know about that.",
        "Parker: Well, you better get him what he wants. Otherwise, he may start crying or something. And the last thing you need while you're trying to get married is a 5-year-old having a meltdown.",
        "Craig: Oh. Okay. You two can go and get your cheese fries. But don't be late.",
        "Parker: No, we won't. Come on.",
        "Margo: Bye, guys.",
        "Parker: Bye.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: Well, well, well. Seems like Parker couldn't get out of here fast enough.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Margo: You sure he's okay about you marrying his mom?",
        "Craig: Oh, it's not that. I think my best man is a little nervous about running into his ex-wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Carly, it's not as if you and Craig have to rush into getting married for some reason. You know, you could just take your time.",
        "Carly: I'm getting married today, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: What if you're not ready?",
        "Carly: My dress is pressed. I've got something borrowed and something blue.",
        "Rosanna: And you're in so much pain, you're drinking yourself into oblivion.",
        "Carly: Just because you found a few bottles does not mean that I'm in pain.",
        "Rosanna: Craig knows, doesn't he? That's why he poured the champagne out last night. He doesn't want you to be tempted.",
        "Carly: He's protective.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what's got him so worried, Carly? Have you had blackouts or accidents? Have you been driving like this?",
        "Carly: Things were a little out of control for a while. I didn't need Craig to tell me that. I figured it out for myself, and I stopped.",
        "Rosanna: But now you've started again.",
        "Carly: I can handle it.",
        "Rosanna: Really? It's not always that easy, and you have a genetic history to think about. I mean, think about your father.",
        "Carly: Oh, please let's not talk about him.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sorry, but your father was a drunk, Carly.",
        "Carly: So, he was. So that must mean that I am?",
        "Rosanna: No, I said --",
        "Carly: Please do not compare me to my father! I am nothing like him.",
        "Rosanna: Not yet. But if the thought of this wedding is pushing you to drink, maybe you have no business getting married today.",
        "Carly: Of course I'm getting married today. Craig has been nothing but good to me, whether you like him or not.",
        "Rosanna: This isn't about me or Craig.",
        "[Ice clinking in glass]",
        "Rosanna: I just want you to take a step back and look at what's happening to you.",
        "Carly: I like what's happening to me. You know why? Because for the first time since Jack walked out that door, I am not afraid.",
        "Rosanna: I know, Honey. It's been rough for you.",
        "Carly: I tried making it on my own, but it's hard. With three children, it's hard, and Craig takes care of me. He makes my life better.",
        "Rosanna: Then why are you so unhappy? I don't know if you're drinking because you're getting married or you're getting married because you drink, but either way, it's not good.",
        "Carly: Now you're starting to sound like Jack.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe Jack is right on this one.",
        "Carly: Do you think its right for Jack to be blissful with Janet while I'm alone?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Carly: I don't. I deserve my own happiness.",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Carly: I deserve my own life.",
        "Rosanna: Of course you do. You do. Of course, you do, but I just wish that you would take some time and think this through.",
        "Carly: You're just saying this because you hate Craig.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's not true. I'm worried about you!",
        "Carly: You and Jack both. You despise him so much that you would do anything to get me to walk away from him, including making ridiculous assumptions about my state of mind!",
        "Rosanna: Okay, you want Craig. You sure about that?",
        "Carly: Absolutely!",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Well, then let's just give your husband-to-be a call and tell him that you've started drinking again so that he can get you some help.",
        "[Bottles clattering]",
        "[Footsteps departing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey, the Snyders!",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Craig: So glad you could make it.",
        "Janet: Oh, I wouldn't have -- we wouldn't have missed it for the world.",
        "Jack: Where's Parker?",
        "Margo: He took Johnny to get a snack. They should be back soon.",
        "Jack: Want me to call and check on them?",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, they'll be fine. Sage, you look adorable.",
        "Sage: Where's my mom?",
        "Craig: Oh, she's on her way, I'm sure. Would you like a soft drink or something while we're waiting?",
        "Margo: You know what I think Sage would like to do? Go upstairs and watch some videos. We've got some good ones.",
        "Sage: Yes, please.",
        "Margo: That's what I thought.",
        "Jack: Thank you, Margo.",
        "Tom: The caterers set up everything up in the other room. Would you like a drink?",
        "Janet: Oh, just lead the way.",
        "Tom: Follow me. Excuse me.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: You talk to Carly today?",
        "Craig: Oh, I saw her. She looks great.",
        "Jack: You saw her?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Not supposed to see the bride before the wedding. That's bad luck.",
        "Craig: I know its bad luck. So I've been told. But you know what? The birds are still chirping, and I'm still marrying a woman who is one in a million. But then I don't have to tell you that, do I?",
        "Jack: Got to hand it to you, Craig. You surprise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: All right, you want some ketchup for those fries? Grab that. You want me to help you?",
        "Johnny: I can do it by myself.",
        "Parker: Okay, then. Why don't I get you some extra napkins? Johnny, Johnny, what'd you do to yourself?! Your dad is going to kill me.",
        "Liberty: No, no, no, no, Parker! Parker, do not rub it in! It'll make it worse! Come here, Johnny. You got to dab it. Let me see that.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Liberty: All right.",
        "Parker: Okay, it's not working.",
        "Liberty: I know. There's too much of it. Ugh! It's already set in.",
        "Parker: Oh, what am I going to do? I've got to get Johnny back in time for the wedding. And when Craig sees him, he's going to hit the roof.",
        "Liberty: Well, hey, maybe -- maybe Craig will think it's funny. It is kind of funny, huh, Johnny?",
        "Parker: You have no idea how crazy Craig's been acting about this dumb wedding.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Well, then we'll just -- we'll get him a change of clothes.",
        "Parker: How?! I can't pay for new clothes for Johnny!",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but why don't we just go to Craig's and pick up something? I mean, they know us at the hotel, so I'm sure, when they see us with Johnny, they'll let us into the room.",
        "Parker: You know what, fine, but we better hurry.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: Come on.",
        "Liberty: Come on. Oh, oh, arms up.",

        "Jack: I got you curious, huh?",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: Jack, you've accused me of a lot of things over the years -- murder, mayhem, jaywalking.",
        "Jack: And you were guilty of every last one of them. You'd sell out your own mother to get what you want, Craig.",
        "Craig: But now I've surprised you. How?",
        "Jack: I had a little conversation with Sage this morning. We were talking about love and how it comes in different forms.",
        "Craig: Is this your subtle way of letting me know that you'll always be the true love of Carly's life?",
        "Jack: It's my way of saying thank you.",
        "Craig: I don't follow.",
        "Jack: You make Carly a better person. You're supportive. And you encourage her and you make her laugh. And I must admit, I didn't see it coming.",
        "Craig: Neither did I.",
        "Jack: I need to know that you're going to take care of her, Craig, and that you will always, always look after her for my kids.",
        "Craig: I can assure you, Jack, that I will treat my inherited family much better than I treated my own. I learn from my mistakes.",
        "Jack: I hope so. Keep surprising me, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You've always led a charmed life. Even now, when you're broke, you still have it together. Well, my life isn't like that, Rosanna. It never has been.",
        "Rosanna: I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Carly: By taking everything away from me? Things are finally falling into place for me today! Why can't you let me have that?!",
        "Rosanna: Because this day isn't just about you! You're getting married today. You're going to promise your children that you're going to give them a stable home, and you're promising Craig that you're going to be a loving wife and a good mother to his child!",
        "Carly: I can make good on that.",
        "Rosanna: Not if you're drunk, you can't!",
        "Carly: I'll stop!",
        "Rosanna: No, you won't. You'll hide it. You'll hide it like you hid it from me, and eventually Craig will find out.",
        "Carly: And you think he'll leave me.",
        "Rosanna: I think that you owe it to yourself to be honest enough to admit what's going on before you drag Craig and the kids and Johnny into a marriage that has a snowball's chance of making it!",
        "Carly: Craig loves me. He accepts me for who I am.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Carly: I'm not keeping anything from him.",
        "Rosanna: Then why don't you want me to call him and tell him that you're drinking again?",
        "Carly: Because it's his wedding day, too, and I don't want to upset him because of a misunderstanding!",
        "Rosanna: Okay, I'm sorry. What have I misunderstood?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I stopped drinking before, and I can stop drinking again, and this time it'll stick.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Just do me one thing, okay? Just look me in the eye and tell me that you're not an alcoholic.",
        "Carly: Gladly. I'm not an alcoholic.",
        "Rosanna: And you believe that?",
        "Carly: It's the truth. I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not an alcoholic. I am not an alcoholic. Where -- why are you walking away?!",
        "[Bottles clattering]",
        "Carly: Didn't you hear me?! I am not an alcoholic!",
        "Rosanna: Then what is this, Carly?! This is you drinking in secret, drinking because you can't stop!",
        "Carly: I told you, those are from before -- before I got everything under control!",
        "Rosanna: You have told a lot of lies in your life, but you have always, always known who you are! This is who you are now! And you can't change it unless you admit it! So just admit it!",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Carly: What are you going to do?",
        "Rosanna: I'm going to stop you from killing yourself.",
        "[Bottles clattering]",
        "Carly: Please, Rosanna. After today, everything changes. I'll have a good life. I'll be happy. Don't take that away from me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Honey, I won't, okay?",
        "Carly: You won't?",
        "Rosanna: I promise, I won't, I won't, I won't.",
        "Carly: You won't tell Craig?",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Honey, you -- you need to admit that you have a problem and that you have to do something about it so you can save yourself.",
        "Carly: Okay. I will. But it'll be better. I'll be better. You'll see. Craig loves me. You know, he'll -- he'll help me.",
        "Rosanna: This isn't about Craig. Craig can't fix this. You have to do this for yourself.",
        "Carly: But you won't tell him? You won't interfere with my wedding?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if you insist on getting married today, yeah, I will -- I will stand by you. I will be there for you, okay? I can't pretend that I think that this is right.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Sweetie. I love you so much. Listen, if you're going to get married, come on, let's -- let's just get you dressed.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. I -- I don't want your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Do you think this is okay?",
        "[Parker sighs]",
        "Liberty: Maybe we should have called Craig and asked him.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no. See, I don't want to get into trouble twice. I mean, first, when I'm on the phone with him, then when he actually sees Johnny in person. I only want to live through this once.",
        "[Liberty chuckles]",
        "Liberty: I know what you mean.",
        "Parker: Okay, okay. Okay, Johnny, come on. Let's go put on those shoes that we picked out for you.",
        "Liberty: Whoo!",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Liberty: So, you think you're going to like having a little brother around all the time?",
        "Parker: He's an okay kid. So, yeah.",
        "Liberty: That's nice. Well, so, I'm going to go, but I will see you at the wedding.",
        "Parker: Liberty? I hate that we can't talk to each other anymore.",
        "Liberty: Every time I try, Parker, you get mean and jealous and --",
        "Parker: I know, I know, and I'm sorry. Okay, I'm really sorry about the way I acted the other day, going off on you like that.",
        "Liberty: You have no right to be jealous when I talk to other guys, Parker, 'cause we're not together anymore.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I know, I know, and I get that and I respect you. I do. I -- I don't know how to act when I'm around you.",
        "Liberty: Why not? We were friends first before we were married and annulled. Why can't we just be that again?",
        "Parker: Liberty, we were -- we were more than just friends. You were my girlfriend. I miss that.",
        "Liberty: Well, it's over now. I mean, does that -- does that mean that we have nothing left?",
        "Johnny: I'm ready.",
        "Parker: Okay, then we'd better get going. You want a ride? Okay, then. Come on, Johnny.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Liberty: I have an idea. Why don't we just not put a name on what we are and just be?",
        "Parker: That could work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Maybe I shouldn't have confronted you about this today.",
        "Carly: Maybe not.",
        "Rosanna: Sorry. I just did it because I love you.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I thought we'd have fun today. That you'd help me get ready, help me get dressed and with my hair and my makeup -- and we'd have fun and you'd have me laughing so hard, I'd be so relaxed, I'd practically float to Craig. And now I just want to cry.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. We can -- we could still do those things.",
        "Carly: It wouldn't be the same. I just need some time on my own to myself together.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, if that's what you want. Um, is this going to ruin things between us?",
        "Carly: I'll get over it. If you really want to help me, go to Margo's and make sure that Sage and Parker are okay. I'll get dressed. I'll have a limo take me.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I'll just put these in the trash on my way out. You don't need them anymore, do you?",
        "Carly: Of course not.",
        "[Bottles clattering]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Where were you? I was starting to worry about you.",
        "Liberty: I'm not late, right?",
        "Janet: Well, no, but I--",
        "Craig: Hey, buddy. Did you like those cheese fries?",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "[Liberty chuckles]",
        "Craig: Why is he wearing different clothes?",
        "Parker: Well, he -- he spilled ketchup all over himself. And I ran into Liberty, and we decided that we should go back to your place and change his shirt.",
        "Craig: Excellent solution.",
        "Janet: Are you okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine, Mom. Don't make a big deal.",
        "Janet: All right, forget I asked.",
        "Margo: Hey, you know what, Sage is upstairs watching a video. Johnny, you want to go up and watch with her?",
        "Liberty: I will take him upstairs, okay?",
        "Craig: Parker, thanks for taking care of the wardrobe malfunction. I've got enough on my mind.",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah, I just thought I was going to be late. Is my mom upstairs?",
        "Craig: She's not here yet.",
        "Parker: Are you serious? Where is she?",
        "Craig: Everything's fine. It's fine. I left Rosanna in charge. I'm sure she'll get Carly here in one piece.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Craig: And there they are right now. Your timing is perfect.",
        "Parker: Where's Mom?",
        "Craig: Don't tell me. She's waiting in a car, waiting for everyone to take their places before she comes in.",
        "Rosanna: No, she's, uh, not outside. She didn't come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Here comes the bride.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "[Scoffs]",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "Carly: Hi, uh, this is Carly Tenney calling again. I'm just wondering if the limo I order is on its way. Good, good. Another question. Um, is there a -- a bar in the car? Oh, excellent. Okay, yes, I'm ready to go.",
        "Rosanna: We had a pretty busy morning and got behind schedule. I'm sure Carly will be here soon.",
        "Margo: Well, why don't we have some hors d'oeuvres then while we're waiting, huh?",
        "Janet: I'll help you serve.",
        "Jack: You sure everything is okay?",
        "Craig: Couldn't be better. Carly just wants to make a big entrance. Let me show the patio. I think you'll be impressed. Where is she?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I guess she's at home getting into her dress.",
        "Craig: Why aren't you there helping her?",
        "Rosanna: Because we had a little bit of an argument, and -- she got upset and kicked me out.",
        "Craig: Today of all days, you get into an argument with your sister?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I just thought there were some pretty important issues that needed to be addressed.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh. What could be so important?",
        "Rosanna: Honestly, Craig, she didn't want me to talk to you about it.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, in less than an hour, Carly is going to be my wife, and that entitles me to certain rights, such as whatever it is you did or said that upset her.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I found out that Carly has a drinking problem and that you have been helping her cover it up.",
        "Craig: That's a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Driver: Uh, are you alone?",
        "[Slurring]",
        "Carly: Do you have a problem with that? Oh, good, there is a bar.",
        "Driver: Looks like you've already had a few.",
        "Carly: What are you, my conscience? Just get driving. I have a wedding to get to.",
        "[Glass clinking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I know what I saw, Craig.",
        "Craig: Really? Just what did you see? Because the Carly I saw this morning was just fine. She was sweet to Parker, she gave me grief about being nicer to my sister, and she was sober.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe, but I'm sure that was just temporary, because I found all of her bottles, so maybe she didn't have time to go out and get some more before she saw you!",
        "Craig: Why are you doing this now? If you were so determined to ruin this for us, why did you wait until the last minute?!",
        "Rosanna: Craig, wake up! She's an alcoholic.",
        "Craig: That was before, Rosanna! Before you came back, yes, she had a drinking problem. But I called her on it, and she stopped.",
        "Rosanna: Then why did I find empty bottles all over the house?",
        "Craig: That's what you're basing this on, a couple of empty bottles?",
        "Rosanna: It was more than a couple, Craig. There was a dozen, at least, or more!",
        "Craig: Are you sure?",
        "Rosanna: Yes!",
        "Craig: Where?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: In the oven, under the kitchen sink, in the cabinet, in the laundry room, in the basement, hidden behind the camping equipment.",
        "Craig: All right, all right. There has to be a reasonable explanation for that.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, there is a reasonable explanation, and the explanation is that she's a drunk.",
        "Craig: I thought she'd stopped.",
        "Rosanna: Well, she has an addiction. She's not a bad person. She just has an addiction, and that just doesn't stop because you want it to. Unless you don't want it to.",
        "Craig: Oh, you think I want Carly to drink?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. She's kind of your ideal woman now, isn't she? Needy, vulnerable, totally dependent on you.",
        "Craig: You know what I think? I think you invented all this because you hate me so much.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's ridiculous.",
        "Craig: I think you pretended to support this marriage.",
        "Rosanna: I have supported this marriage beyond any reasonable --",
        "Craig: You know what else I think? I think you've been planning a little payback of your own all along.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, please. I don't care about getting back at you, Craig. I don't care about you. I care about Carly. She needs help, and I'm not going to let her not get it because you don't want to see the truth!",
        "Craig: Did you all get something to eat?",
        "Jack: Craig, we know something's wrong.",
        "Parker: Where's my mom? She should have been here by now.",
        "Jack: Why didn't she come with you, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Well, she just decided she wanted a little quiet time, so she's coming in a limo on her own.",
        "Craig: She'll be here soon. You know how she likes to do things her own way.",
        "Tom: So, this is Judge Gordon.",
        "Craig: Judge, nice to meet you. Please help yourself to hors d'oeuvres and sparkling cider. We should be getting under way any minute.",
        "Judge Gordon: Hopefully sooner rather than later.",
        "Tom: The judge has another wedding to perform this afternoon.",
        "Judge Gordon: Where's the bride?",
        "Craig: You know, I'm going to call her right now and just check up on her. Why don't you have some of the caviar?",
        "Judge Gordon: Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: Relax, everyone. She's just a few minutes late.",
        "Jack: Let us know what you find out, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Thank God you're still here.",
        "Driver: Uh, dispatch wants to send me on another job.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Well, forget it. You still got me.",
        "Driver: You answering that?",
        "Carly: Does it look like I am? Just start driving.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: No answer?",
        "Craig: She could have her phone off, or maybe she's on her way and she hit a dead zone. I'm sure she'll be driving up any second.",
        "Jack: I knew it was too good to be true.",
        "Janet: It could still work out.",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Sage: The video is over. When's the wedding starting?",
        "Judge Gordon: I'd like to know the same thing.",
        "Craig: Would you all give the bride a break?! She'll be here soon!",
        "Parker: No, she won't. She's not coming!",
        "Janet: Hey, hey! Maybe you should let him go.",
        "Liberty: Mom, he's upset.",
        "Jack: Let -- let her go. I'm sure he could use a friend right now.",
        "Craig: You know what? I think you're all overreacting. I'm going to wait outside.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Jack: I need to ask you something. I want you to be honest with me.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rosanna: All right, what do you want to know?",
        "Jack: Was Carly drinking? I need to know what's going on. Rosanna, was she drinking or not?",
        "Rosanna: Not when I left, but I know she has been.",
        "[Janet clears throat]",
        "Janet: Maybe we should take Sage home.",
        "Jack: Okay, let's go.",
        "Janet: Sage, get your purse, Sweetie. We're going to go home.",
        "Sage: Isn't Mom coming?",
        "Jack: Well, we're going to -- we're going to go see her later, okay?",
        "Sage: I knew she wouldn't marry him.",
        "Jack: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Liquid pouring]",
        "Driver: Where to, lady?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: I don't care. Just keep driving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Except for Tom and Margo, we're the only ones left.",
        "Craig: I don't care. We don't need guests to get married.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you need a judge, and -- I'm afraid he left, too, since it didn't look like the wedding was happening.",
        "Craig: Carly will be here.",

        "Noah: I think I've been kidding myself, thinking that I can put my father behind me. I don't think I ever will.",
        "Rosanna: Having Carly be dependent on you sets up a situation where you are always in control.",
        "Craig: So she's drinking because of me?",
        "Carly: You know, you never judged me. You always accepted me for who I am.",
