        "Alison was disappointed when she thought Chris forgot her 18th birthday. Chris later surprised her with a necklace and a kiss. Hal told Walker to keep his suspicions about Rick to himself, but when Emily pushed, Walker admitted his suspicions. Emily worried about Susan's safety. Meanwhile, Susan admitted to Rick that she told her daughters about Rick's past, because she wanted to be honest. Rick was worried that Walker would turn Emily and Alison against him, so he proposed to Susan to prove his good intentions. Rose told Dusty she needed time to grieve and deal with her guilt over Paul, but he said he won't wait long. Jennifer returned to Oakdale, and wanted to know why Paul died. Barbara told her there had been a problem with Rose and Dusty, but that he died knowing his mother loved him. Paul secretly listened in as Jen explained that she was no longer modeling. Tom told Margo that he'd been hired as Oakdale's new District Attorney."

        "Alison: He shoots people with a hypodermic full of something, makes 'em look like they've had a heart attack.",
        "Katie: Are you serious?",
        "Alison: When Dr. Hughes first collapsed, they even thought for a while he might be one of the victims.",
        "Katie: Wait. What do you mean, Dr. Hughes collapsed?",
        "Alison: He's in a coma. Isn't that horrible?",
        "Katie: Alison, do they know if he's going to be okay?",
        "Alison: They just have to wait and see. But at least they know he wasn't attacked or anything. They think that he had a stroke.",
        "Katie: Oh, poor Chris.",
        "Alison: Yeah. He's in no mood to celebrate.",
        "Katie: Celebrate what?",
        "Alison: My birthday.",
        "Katie: Oh, Alison, happy birthday.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Hey, you're finally 18. How does it feel?",
        "Alison: There's Chris.",
        "Chris: Hey, Alison. Hi.",
        "Alison: That wouldn't be something for me, would it?",
        "Chris: Uh, as a matter of fact, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mom, I got the best idea for Ali's -- well, that's weird. [Emily gasps] Oh!",
        "Rick: Emily. Are you all right?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah. You just -- you caught me by surprise, that's all.",
        "Rick: Well, you look a little more than surprised. Emily, you're not afraid of me, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Look -- I've already spent too much time without you. I want you to tell me that we're gonna be together -- soon.",
        "Rose: It's complicated.",
        "Dusty: So simplify. Don't let Lily and Holden keep us apart.",
        "Rose: No, it's not about Lily and Holden.",
        "Dusty: Then what is it?",
        "Rose: It's Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Hello, mom.",
        "Barbara: Jennifer. Oh, my God, Jennifer. You're home.",
        "Jennifer: Yes. I'm home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What? What is it? Something's happened. Something happened to Bob? It's Bob, isn't it?",
        "Tom: No, no, nothing's changed. Even in a coma, dad's as stubborn as he ever was. Fortunately, as far as anyone else can see, he's not gotten any worse.",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you God for small favors.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Tom: Come here. Come here.",
        "Margo: Wow. Can I hire you to come in and do that about every afternoon at this time? I miss you so much.",
        "Tom: Yeah, me, too. Our schedules just don't seem to lighten up, do they?",
        "Margo: Hmm-mm. And I'm really not having this two ships pass in the night thing anymore.",
        "Tom: I'm not liking it, either. But you know what the good news is? All that's about to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: Lieutenant Munson.",
        "Hal: Is that your file on Memorial Hospital?",
        "Walker: Everything I've collected on the serial killer, yes.",
        "Hal: Very good. You can put that right in here. There you go.",
        "Walker: You could have had one of your uniforms pick this up, Hal. Obviously this isn't the only reason you wanted me to stop by.",
        "Hal: Smart man.",
        "Walker: Then treat me like one. Let's get to the point.",
        "Hal: Okay. Your continued suspicions about Rick Decker are a problem.",
        "Walker: You made that clear at the hospital. Pursuant to that, I made a full apology to Dr. Decker.",
        "Hal: I didn't get my badge yesterday, doctor. I don't care what you said to Rick Decker, I know you still suspect him.",
        "Walker: And my private suspicions are of concern to you because -- ?",
        "Hal: Because you don't keep them so private. Now listen, I spoke with John Dixon. He's overwhelmed, he's understaffed, and he thinks it would be a good boost to morale if you kept your theories about this case to yourself, until we make an arrest, that is. After that, I don't care who you play telephone with.",
        "Walker: Are you silencing me, Hal?",
        "Hal: Like I said -- smart man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Afraid? No. Startled? Yes. A little.",
        "Rick: Why? This is my room.",
        "Emily: Well, I know. I know. It's just -- I was just so surprised, glad, really, you know, to see you walking around. I'm used to seeing you in the bed, that's all.",
        "Susan: Look at you. Hi. Rick is doing so well, we think he can be released today.",
        "Emily: I know. I was just telling him how great it was to see him, you know, doing so well.",
        "Rick: Well, if I've recovered faster than anyone expected, it's all because of your mother's tender, loving care.",
        "Susan: Well, let's not push it too fast. Okay. We've got to get you back in bed.",
        "Emily: Well, obviously this isn't a good time, so I'll -- I'll -- I'll talk to you later about plans for Alison, mom.",
        "Rick: Emily, you don't have to run off. Now, what's this about Alison?",
        "Susan: Well, I thought I told you. It's her birthday today.",
        "Rick: Oh, you're -- you're planning a family thing. You know, I'm a sucker for a good birthday party. I just hope that they release me in time so I can watch her blow out her candles.",
        "Emily: That'd be great. I'll talk to you later, mom.",
        "Rick: She knows, doesn't she?",
        "Susan: Knows what?",
        "Rick: That I was on staff at another hospital where serial killings were suspected.",
        "Susan: I didn't want her to find out from anybody else. And I wanted her to know that I know because you have gone out of your way to be honest with me about it.",
        "Rick: You told her I was a suspect, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: God, look at you. Look how beautiful you are. Am I dreaming? I thought you were in Milan.",
        "Jennifer: I know you did.",
        "Barbara: Why didn't you call me? I could have come to pick you up, I could have sent a car for you, or your dad could have come to get you.",
        "Jennifer: I didn't call anybody. Not you, not dad, not even Will.",
        "Barbara: Okay, all right, all right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all. The only thing that matters is that you're home. I come here every day. How did you know when to find me here?",
        "Jennifer: I didn't know.",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe it's that intuitive sense that we share.",
        "Jennifer: I didn't come here to see you, mom. I came straight from the airport to visit Paul's memorial.",
        "Barbara: I see. Were you planning on seeing me at all, or did you just come to make your pilgrimage and go see your father and your little brother, and then head out of town again?",
        "Jennifer: Mom, I was going to see you later.",
        "Barbara: I called you so many times, when Will was in the hospital, when I was in Europe looking for Paul. I left message after message.",
        "Jennifer: I got them.",
        "Barbara: You never returned my calls. Why not?",
        "Jennifer: Mom --",
        "Barbara: Even when I called to tell you about Paul, you didn't come home, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I know, mom. I couldn't.",
        "Barbara: You know, we can always talk. I know we've had problems, but we could always talk. I was hoping that maybe you wouldn't push me away anymore.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, stop it. You -- you think I ran away and didn't return your phone calls because I was mad at you?",
        "Barbara: Well, when you left, we were having some difficulty.",
        "Jennifer: That was a long time ago. All right, a lot has happened since then. My not returning your calls had nothing to do with you.",
        "Barbara: Well, what else could I surmise?",
        "Jennifer: You know, I didn't return anyone's phone calls. I sent Will a couple of letters, but I didn't return dad's or Paul's.",
        "Barbara: Why not?",
        "Jennifer: Because -- because I didn't want anyone to know what a complete wreck my life is. I wish Paul were here. I miss him so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What's Paul got to do with this?",
        "Rose: Everything. He's like a dark storm cloud hovering over the both of us.",
        "Dusty: All right, all right, all right. Talk to me. Come on, talk to me.",
        "Rose: I was kidnapped right after Paul died. I never had time to grieve. I never had time to go to his grave. The guilt is killing me inside.",
        "Dusty: You didn't kill him.",
        "Rose: I might as well have. I tell him about my feelings for you and he takes off on a plane to nowhere.",
        "Dusty: You're telling me that we can't work out because you're feeling guilty about Paul?",
        "Rose: I'm not saying that we're never gonna work out. I'm not saying that we're never gonna be happy. It's just -- I need some time. I need a little breathing room.",
        "Dusty: Come on. I think it's a little more than that. I think you're holding out on me. What is it?",
        "Rose: No, no, I just -- I just told you what it is. I need some time -- that's what it is -- to sort through these things that happened with Paul. That's it. That's all it's about.",
        "Dusty: Look me in the eye and say that again. You see that? I want you to look at me and tell me right now what is going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Are you finished yet?",
        "Chris: Uh, yeah, I'm done.",
        "Alison: Weren't you about to give me something?",
        "Chris: Uh, yes, I was. You left it in my car the other night. I wanted to make sure that you got it back.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Katie: Chris, Alison told me about your dad. I'm so sorry.",
        "Chris: Thanks, Katie. We're praying that he comes out of it soon.",
        "Katie: Well, listen, give Kim and Nancy my best and tell them I'll be by soon, okay?",
        "Chris: I will. Thanks. Wow, is that time? Excuse me, I got rounds to make.",
        "Alison: He didn't even remember it's my birthday. What? I made it so easy for him. I must have given him, like, a million hints over the past few weeks.",
        "Katie: Alison, his dad's in a coma. He's got a lot on his mind.",
        "Alison: You're right. He's under a lot of stress. But it's my birthday, for crying out loud.",
        "Katie: I've missed something, haven't I? You two have gone past the just kissing under the mistletoe phase.",
        "Alison: Well, yeah. But obviously not as much as I thought. He's just been so protective lately. Especially since psycho Gordo's been on the loose. He actually made me think that he cared about me. He didn't even remember it's my birthday.",
        "Katie: He'll remember -- eventually.",
        "Alison: If that's supposed to make me feel better, Katie, try again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey? You can talk to me.",
        "Jennifer: There's nothing really to talk about, mom. My life is a mess. You know, I left Milan, and the -- the only thing I wish I could do right now is talk to Paul.",
        "Barbara: But you were becoming so successful. You may not know this, but I kept track. I saw the layouts of what you shot. I spoke to the designers you worked for, they loved you.",
        "Jennifer: That was a long time ago, mom. A lot has changed since then.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay. You're having a slump. I know all about slumps. Pretty soon that phone will ring again, and off you'll go.",
        "Jennifer: It's not the agents, mom. Or the design houses.",
        "Barbara: Then what?",
        "Jennifer: It's me. Okay? I haven't been working the last couple of months because -- well, there was this guy and -- you know, it's all too complicated. I really can't talk about this right now.",
        "Barbara: Well, then don't.",
        "Jennifer: And I don't want you bugging me about it every other minute, okay?",
        "Barbara: I promise I won't do that. But there must be something that we can talk about.",
        "Jennifer: Sure. I'm completely broke. And I won't be going back to Milan to model. Or anywhere else in Europe.",
        "Barbara: So, you're coming home.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not making any definite plans, mom.",
        "Barbara: You may not know this, but I sold Fairwinds. And I've taken this suite at the Lakeview Towers. It's beautiful. It's huge. It's perfect for you and me and Will. And if you don't like it, I promise we'll find something else. Whatever you need.",
        "Jennifer: I can't, mom. I can't talk about anything, especially my life. Tell me about my brother.",
        "Barbara: Will's fine. He asks about you all the time.",
        "Jennifer: You know I'm not talking about Will. Tell me about Paul. My big brother is dead, and I need to know what happened. I need to know everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I don't want to talk about Paul anymore.",
        "Dusty: You brought it up. It's okay. You know, we did our best dealing with Paul's death. We talked about it, we were there for each other. Why do you want to go back and rewrite history?",
        "Rose: Stop, all right? Enough. Enough.",
        "Dusty: Then be straight with me. Lily doesn't want you with me, right?",
        "Rose: No.",
        "Dusty: She blames me for the kidnapping, now she's trying to put a guilt trip on you.",
        "Rose: No, it's not Lily. Lily cares about me. She's not trying to put a guilt trip on me.",
        "Dusty: Or Holden, whatever.",
        "Rose: No, not Holden. No. Nobody's bringing up Paul to me.",
        "Dusty: Then what happened? There has got to be a reason why Paul is so on your mind right now.",
        "Rose: Paul? Paul? It can't be. Okay. All right, I'm gonna be honest with you. There is a reason why Paul's on my mind right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: After Paul died, do you have any idea how much I wanted to talk to you? I just wanted to hear your voice. Do you have any idea how heartbreaking it was for me to leave a message like that with a concierge for you over the telephone in a foreign language.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, you sent me that letter, telling me about Paul's plane crash. So I know how he died. But you didn't ever tell me why. You never said why. Why is my brother dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: My mother is in danger, Dr. Daniels. I am afraid for her, and you believe I have reason to, but you still won't admit that he might be the murderer. What is the matter with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Susan, will you marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: My son died knowing that I loved him. And I know that he loved me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Do -- do you know something that I don't know?",
        "Tom: Well, I was just inside the machinery over at the D.A.'s office.",
        "Margo: Um, you were there today?",
        "Tom: And guess who got offered a job, I mean, as D.A.?",
        "Margo: Um, you?",
        "Tom: Guess who took the job?",
        "Margo: Oh, that is so incredible! But what about Evelyn?",
        "Tom: She got a big, fat offer from the Attorney-General and jumped on it.",
        "Margo: Well, that's kinda like a personal favor to me. I am so proud of you.",
        "Tom: Do I sense a \"but\" coming?",
        "Margo: Yeah, but Tom, you are an incredible attorney, and I'm not just saying that 'cause you're my husband. But why the sudden change?",
        "Tom: Well, I've got the experience, I know the team.",
        "Margo: Yes, but you've spent the better part of three years building a private practice, and it's just about to make some money for us. Why would you throw that all away?",
        "Tom: This is the no-brainer part of it. I did it for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: You can't just shut me up, Hal.",
        "Hal: I think I just did.",
        "Walker: This is my job, lieutenant. I speculate. I hypothesize, imagine. Conjecture is a valuable tool.",
        "Hal: Maybe so. I'm just telling you not to do it out loud.",
        "Walker: What about the evidence it's helped me collect?",
        "Hal: We'll use it as support when we bring charges against Dr. Gordon.",
        "Walker: What if it supports looking at somebody else than Dr. Gordon? You can't wait to look at my files, Hal. For example, you need to read my notes on the last interview I had --",
        "[phone rings]",
        "Hal: Munson. Yes. Where? Oh, that. That I've got upstairs. I'm gonna have to call you back. I got to leave for a minute. I'll take a look at your files when I get back.",
        "Walker: Thank you. If it's okay with you, Hal, I'd like to stay behind, review the files, make sure they're in order for you.",
        "Hal: Oh, that's fine. But Dr. Daniels, I expect you to honor my request. I don't want you relating your suspicions about Rick Decker to anybody. And I mean anybody. Is that clear?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Walker: Dr. Daniels here.",
        "Emily: Dr. Daniels, it's Emily Stewart. Uh, Emily Munson. Hal Munson's wife.",
        "Walker: Yes, I know who you are.",
        "Emily: I was looking for you at the hospital. The nurses said you had left for the day.",
        "Walker: Actually, I'm down here at the precinct. I just finished speaking with your husband.",
        "Emily: How long are you gonna be there?",
        "Walker: Well, actually, I have to review some files for the lieutenant. Why?",
        "Emily: Would you mind meeting with me? I have some questions, and I think you're about the only one who can answer them for me.",
        "Walker: Questions about what?",
        "Emily: Not what, who. Rick Decker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I'm sorry, Rick. I only told Emily what happened to you in San Francisco because it came up in a conversation.",
        "Rick: How? Oh, by the way, my boyfriend, he was implicated in a serial killing at San Francisco Mercy. Could you pass the jelly, please?",
        "Susan: It wasn't like that. I was only asking Emily if she could get Hal to back off of you a bit.",
        "Rick: Does Alison know, too?",
        "Susan: Yes. I think it's best that both my girls know from me.",
        "Rick: Oh, Susan. I'm trying to make friends with your girls, not scare them away.",
        "Susan: But that involves trust. And if we start holding things back, especially important things, they're just gonna think we're hiding things, and we are.",
        "Rick: Well, I don't have any kids, so I'm going to have to rely on your instincts on this one.",
        "Susan: I just don't want them to think that you somehow tricked me. And anyway, Dr. Gordon is Hal's main suspect now, not you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, it hasn't made Emily any more comfortable around me.",
        "Susan: I don't know what to say about that, except it's just gonna take some time. I'm really, really sorry.",
        "Rick: No, you don't have to apologize. I mean, you've been very honest and up front with everyone.",
        "Susan: Well, I wasn't always. I had to really practice to learn how to do that.",
        "Rick: Maybe your girls would feel more comfortable if I stopped seeing you altogether.",
        "Susan: Oh, please, don't say that.",
        "Rick: I'm being as honest with you as you've been with me. They've expressed doubts, haven't they?",
        "Susan: They've had some concerns, but there are no doubts in my mind that they're gonna adore you when all this is over and forgotten. And that's all that matters. What is it?",
        "Rick: Your girls did the right thing warning you about me.",
        "Susan: You can't mean that.",
        "Rick: Well, if it were my mother in their situation and the guy she was seeing had a secret past that made him a murder suspect? I'd tell her to get the hell away from him, too. They're good girls, Susan. But their mother is better than good. She's fantastic.",
        "Susan: Oh, sweetie. Oh, I just -- I thought you were saying -- I don't know what I thought. I'm just so happy that we're okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Jennifer, you have to understand something. I can't relive that pain again.",
        "Jennifer: You know, dad sent me clippings? I saved them along with the obituary you sent me, and I put them in a book.",
        "Barbara: I know you loved your brother very much.",
        "Jennifer: You know, back in Milan, I had a room that overlooked the public gardens. I used to stare out the window, and then stare at that book. You know that photo next to Paul's obituary? I used to look -- look in his eyes as if I could will them to answer the one question that I can't seem to stop asking myself. Why is my brother dead?",
        "Barbara: It was an accident, Jennifer. Maybe it was the fog. Maybe he lost control.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not talking about how. You know, I'm not talking about the plane, or the instruments, or the weather conditions that day. Why aren't you answering me? You know, why was he out there alone miles and miles from Oakdale? Fine. If you won't answer me, I'll ask dad.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. You should hear this from me, okay, just from me. There were some problems going on, and Paul was -- he was very upset.",
        "Jennifer: At you?",
        "Barbara: He was angry with a lot of people.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Barbara: There had been a misunderstanding.",
        "Jennifer: Over what?",
        "Barbara: Honey, he's gone, all right? He's gone. And the reasons are just circumstantial here. Now I have gone over this in my mind for weeks now, and I know the only thing that's important to me is that my son died knowing that I loved him. And I know that he loved me, too. Do you understand? That's all that matters to me. But there were other people that he would not have forgiven.",
        "Jennifer: So what you're saying is he was angry? My gosh, you're not even supposed to get behind the wheel of a car when you're upset, and you let Paul get into the cockpit of a plane?",
        "Barbara: I didn't know what he was going to do! I was trying to get him to stay in town, but he was determined to get away, to get away from Dusty Donovan, and to get away from his fianc\u00e9e, Rose D'Angelo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Something happened at the hunting lodge the other day.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you almost died out there.",
        "Rose: Yeah, but you went outside, and you were fighting with Brackett for the gun, you came back in, I was down, you asked me, how did I get out of the noose? You remember that? Remember? Remember?",
        "Dusty: Why -- why are you doing this? Why do you want to go back to that?",
        "Rose: And the chair fell, and I was dangling there. And I almost died right there at that very second.",
        "[Rose coughing]",
        "Dusty: What is it? What are you trying to say?",
        "Rose: I almost died right there, at that very second. So maybe that's why I'm thinking about Paul and the way he died. Maybe I got some unfinished business that I got to take care of before I can move on in my life.",
        "Dusty: Okay. You do what you got to do. You know how much I care about you, right?",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: I never thought that I -- I would. I really hope all this stuff works out with Paul, but, you know --",
        "Rose: But?",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: I like dealing with things straight, and right now it looks like there's no guarantee that you're gonna get past this.",
        "Rose: Yes, I will. I bet I just need a little time.",
        "Dusty: I want you to understand something -- I'm not the wait-around kind of guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Am I missing something? Because as a prosecutor, nine times out of ten, you hobnob with people who are the scum of the earth, and that's a favor to me?",
        "Tom: In the last six months, how many times do you think that you and I have had lunch together?",
        "Margo: Like, three?",
        "Tom: No, two. You canceled that one time you brought the thug back from Chicago. Now in the same six-month period, how many times do you think you had lunch with -- I don't know -- Evelyn Hart?",
        "Margo: About 22, if you count the burgers in the car and then every day when we were trying to get Bonnie McKechnie's statement.",
        "Tom: I rest my case. So if the D.A. can spend more time with the sexiest detective on the planet, I'm in.",
        "Margo: I can't think of any D.A. I'd rather eat cold take-out with than you.",
        "Tom: We can't lose touch with each other, honey. We can't get so caught up in our jobs that we lose sight of what's most important.",
        "Margo: I've spent so many late nights here lately. And when I come home and I crawl into bed with you, and I want to wake you up.",
        "Tom: Don't ever hesitate to wake me up. I don't want to miss you anymore.",
        "Margo: I don't want to, either.",
        "Tom: All right, fill me in on the Brackett case.",
        "Margo: No, first here's a little preview of what's coming tonight.",
        "Tom: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Thank you for meeting with me, Dr. Daniels.",
        "Walker: What can I do for you, Ms. Stewart?",
        "Emily: Emily. Please, call me Emily. Hal, you know, I know you're working with him on the serial murders at Memorial --",
        "Walker: I can't explore details of an open investigation.",
        "Emily: Hal has hinted to me, Dr. Daniels, that you have suspicions about Rick Decker and I was hoping --",
        "Walker: Like I said, I am not at liberty to discuss this. I'm sorry. I should have told you as much on the phone.",
        "Emily: This is very important to me.",
        "Walker: I'm sure it is. And I'm sorry that I can't help you. But as you can see, I was just finishing up.",
        "Emily: Please. All right, please, don't go. Just -- if there's something you can tell me about Rick Decker that I should know, you have to tell me. My mother's very life could be in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Everything would be fine, except for Walker Daniels.",
        "Susan: But you don't have to worry about him anymore. And I think he's given up on his vendetta against you.",
        "Rick: You smell redemption. I smell a con job.",
        "Susan: Why would he pretend?",
        "Rick: That I don't know. Chalk it up to his own pathology.",
        "Susan: But, honey, even if you're right, and Walker Daniels still has suspicions about you -- what does it matter?",
        "Rick: It matters if your girls believe him.",
        "Susan: But you have me in your corner.",
        "Rick: And how long are you going to be there if your girls aren't with you?",
        "Susan: That's never going to happen.",
        "Rick: Susan, listen to me. If Dr. Gordon signs a confession today, as long as Walker Daniels is out there pointing his finger at me, your girls are going to have second thoughts about me. It's human nature.",
        "Susan: So, you really think what he's doing could create long-term problems for Emily and Alison?",
        "Rick: Not if we treat the symptoms early. Dr. Stewart -- I may have the prescription.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Look on the bright side, Alison. You're 18 now. You can do all kinds of things you could never do before.",
        "Alison: Like what?",
        "Katie: Uh, you can vote.",
        "Alison: Whoop-de-doo. Who's running for anything?",
        "Katie: You could get a credit card. Okay, you can do lots of things and go pretty much anywhere, whenever you please.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's cool, but I don't have a car. I don't have any money or a boyfriend, or even a guy who likes me enough to remember it's my birthday.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I got to get back to these linens, but I tell you what. Today will not go uncelebrated. Okay? You and I are gonna have a lot of fun later.",
        "Alison: Okay, Katie, thanks.",
        "Chris: Am I wrong, or is the prettiest nurse's aide at Memorial turning 18 today? Happy birthday, Alison.",
        "Alison: You did remember it's my birthday!",
        "Chris: Yeah. How could I forget? Let's see -- \"Chris, did you know that there are two independence days in July? Could you guess what the second one is?\"",
        "Alison: Oh, shut it. I was subtle.",
        "Chris: Yeah, right. So, are you just gonna stare at that, or are you gonna open it?",
        "Alison: You wrapped this?",
        "Chris: I'm a man of many talents. But it's not supposed to stay all wrapped up, you know. Dig in.",
        "Alison: It's so beautiful.",
        "Chris: Just like the girl who's gonna wear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know my mother is deeply involved with Rick Decker, don't you?",
        "Walker: My investigation covered the relationships of all key staff.",
        "Emily: Okay, so you know he worked at San Francisco Mercy.",
        "Walker: I see where you're headed with this. There was an unsolved serial murder case there, and this has affected your opinion of Dr. Decker.",
        "Emily: Yes. I mean, it's nothing specific. It's a feeling.",
        "Walker: Well, unfortunately, we can't pursue people on feelings, only evidence.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, what do you do before you get your evidence, Dr. Daniels? How do you decide what leads to pursue? Hal always says that in cases, most of the time he follows his gut. Now that's just a feeling, right?",
        "Walker: I can't speak on your husband's process, Emily. But all I can tell you is that I can't discuss this with you any further.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, then do this. Okay? Look me in the eye and tell me I've nothing to worry about when it comes to Rick Decker. You can't do it, can you?",
        "Walker: Your husband will tell you to look at the facts of this --",
        "Emily: I'm not asking Hal. I'm asking you.",
        "Walker: Ever since Dr. Gordon was put under surveillance, there have been no new killings. We cannot ignore that.",
        "Emily: But your gut doesn't agree that Dr. Gordon's the killer, does it?",
        "Walker: I didn't say that.",
        "Emily: You think it's Rick Decker, the man my mother spends every waking hour with!",
        "Walker: I can't ignore your husband's rules, Emily!",
        "Emily: My mother is in danger, Dr. Daniels. I am afraid for her. And you believe I have reason to, but you still won't admit that he might be the murderer. What is the matter with you?",
        "Walker: I believe that, yes. But you didn't hear that from me.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I got to get my mother away from that man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: My kids don't run my life.",
        "Rick: I want to reassure them that I love you, too, that I could never hurt you.",
        "Susan: But you've already told them. What more can you do?",
        "Rick: I can show them. I can show them how much I love you, how far I'm willing to go to be with you.",
        "Susan: Well, like what?",
        "Rick: Like me becoming your husband. Susan, will you marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Wow. Let me wrap my brain around this one. \"I care about you, Rose, but I'm not gonna wait around for you.\"",
        "Dusty: I don't mean to sound cold, you know. I just want you to know where I stand.",
        "Rose: What are you? Huh? What are you? Paul was your really good friend. What about you?",
        "Dusty: Yes, yes, we're both gonna feel bad for a long time -- maybe forever. Rose -- Paul is dead.",
        "Rose: But not in my heart, see?",
        "Dusty: I can't let a dead man come between us. If you can, there's nothing more to say.",
        "Rose: He's right. Paul is gone. Paul is dead. And why am I seeing that man? What is going on with you, D'Angelo? What the hell is going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You're so quiet. I just felt that you should know what your brother's supposed best friend and fianc\u00e9e were really like.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to talk about Dusty and Rose, mom. I don't want to talk at all. Oh, Paul.",
        "Barbara: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I know exactly what you're feeling. Because I know you lost your brother, but I lost my son. We'll take care of each other, okay? We're together, and I will take care of you. Just like your brother would have wanted me to.",
