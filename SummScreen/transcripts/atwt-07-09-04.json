They all vow to never let Cabot out of their sights, each of them taking a shift, Paul starting. Roseanna tells Paul that she's ready to be in a relationship with him.

        "Ben: Oh -- oh, man, I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: No, no, it's okay. It's okay. I was just about to tell Margo myself.",
        "Margo: Well, what were you waiting for? Congratulations.",
        "Jessica: Thanks. We're having a baby!",
        "Margo: Yeah, congratulations.",
        "Ben: Hey, thank you, thank you.",
        "Margo: That's great.",
        "Ben: And you know how worried Jess was that it wasn't gonna happen.",
        "Margo: Well, how long have you known?",
        "Ben: Just found out this morning. Went to the hospital thinking about in vitro, came out thinking about baby names.",
        "Margo: Obviously, we need to talk.",
        "Ben: I'm gonna let you two do that, and I'm gonna go grab a quick workout.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Come back, I want her all to myself. Gonna go make some dinner reservations here.",
        "Jessica: Great.",
        "Ben: See you later -- Mom.",
        "Jessica: Okay, Daddy. I'm sure you have some questions.",
        "Margo: Yeah, like, how my best friend gets pregnant and doesn't tell me?",

        "Lucinda: Lucy? Hi, honey. Well, would you like a little snackette before you go to sleep?",
        "Lucy: No, no. I'm okay, thanks.",
        "Lucinda: No glass of milk? You know, these bulbs aren't very bright, darling. We don't want you to ruin your eyesight.",
        "Lucy: Everything's great, I promise. You don't need to worry.",
        "Lucinda: It's my pleasure to worry. I'm just so happy that you're home safe and sound.",
        "Lucy: Me, too.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, that's for me. I'm expecting it. All right, darling. Well, do you remember how to use the intercom?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: All right.",
        "Lucy: You go take your call.",
        "Lucinda: Anything, just reach me.",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Lucinda: Well, she seems fine. If she's severely traumatized, she's hiding it extremely well.",
        "Lily: Do you think maybe Craig could be right, that somebody that we know organized this kidnapping?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what isn't possible these days, honey? I can barely stand to read the newspapers.",
        "Lily: Any word on that background check about Alan Drake?",
        "Lucinda: I'm expecting it very soon. And in the meantime, I've asked them to beef up the security, and Hal has put a guard -- a policeman -- at the gate. I mean, nobody's gonna get Lucy again. Dear God, not while I'm looking after her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Lucy: Dusty!",
        "Dusty: It's good to see you, too.",

        "Craig: Sorry, Metro is closed. [Craig laughs] I thought I told you two to get out of town.",
        "Wade: Did you? I don't know, Donny, you think maybe we don't hear so good.",
        "Craig: Did you hear the police are looking for you? All right, stick around. Go directly to jail.",
        "Donny: We'll get out when we're ready. But first, we got business.",
        "Craig: Not with me you don't.",
        "Wade: Been reading the newspapers, Mr. Montgomery? Notice your daughter's back home?",
        "Craig: That has nothing to do with you.",
        "Wade: We think it does. You hired us to kidnap your daughter so you could play hero and ride to the rescue. The plan bombed.",
        "Donny: So we came up with a better one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No more glasses of water! It's time to go to sleep.",
        "Announcer: The role of Molly McKinnon is now being played by Christina chambers.",
        "Lily: Molly! Oh, there you are! You found her!",
        "Molly: He did more than find me. He saved my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Somebody took Cabot from his nursery. Somebody moved him down here and left him here all alone! It wasn't one of us! It had to be you!",
        "Barbara: I can't believe that you're accusing me of something so hideous.",
        "Paul: Oh, don't pretend this is news to you.",
        "Barbara: Why would I do such a thing!",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. You've never been comfortable with your children being here. You think that this whole house is under siege because of James Stenbeck. Maybe you staged the whole thing in order to make us think that it was already happening.",
        "Barbara: I have done no such thing, and if you really believe that I have, then our problems are even bigger than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: This doesn't make any sense. How did this baby get into Cabot's carrier?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Maybe somebody -- but Jordan, it doesn't make any sense. We were right here the whole time.",
        "Jordan: Excuse me. Are you the manager here?",
        "Manager: Yeah. What's going on?",
        "Jordan: Someone took my son out of his carrier and switched him with this baby.",
        "Manager: What?!",
        "Jordan: I have no idea how it happened, but my son is missing. So please, lock the doors, and don't let anyone out of here. Excuse me. Can I have everyone's attention, please? My son is missing. He's about 1-years-old, he's got brown hair, blue eyes. Has anybody seen him or anybody see who did this? [Baby cries]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: From the minute that you and Ben decided that you wanted to try and have a baby, I've tried to help you in any way I could. In any way I could! And now I find out that you are pregnant and you don't even bother to tell me?",
        "Jessica: Margo, I was going to tell you. I ran over here to tell you our good news. But before I could get it out, you were flashing that stupid compact in my face.",
        "Margo: The one that Tom found in Doc's car. You don't think I have a right to be curious about that?",
        "Jessica: I understand that, but you were so angry that it didn't present the opportunity for me to tell you I was pregnant.",
        "Margo: Well, what about before? You could've told me before -- oh, sorry. Yeah, you have an excuse.",
        "Jessica: No, wait. Before, you were so frantic about this Jill person that I just wanted to be there for you, okay? So the time didn't seem to be right. What? That's not good enough, either?",
        "Margo: You know, first, I find out that you have a secret meeting in the middle of the night with Doc Reese. And then I find out that you're pregnant, and you don't tell me. Jessica, you seeing a pattern here?",
        "Jessica: So, exactly what crime am I guilty of here, Margo?",
        "Margo: I don't know. Why don't you pick one?",
        "Jessica: You know what? I'm gonna step away for a couple of minutes. And when you can start treating me like the best friend you've ever had, and not like a criminal, then maybe we can continue this conversation. But if you can't do that, you can find another table, or I will.",

        "Jennifer: I checked the bathrooms. He's not there.",
        "Jordan: I'm calling the police.",

        "Manager: I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closed.",
        "Asian mother: I think my baby is in there!",
        "Jordan: Let her in! It's him! Hey! Oh, thank you, God. Thank you. Oh, come here. Hey. Hey, buddy.",
        "Jennifer: Hi, sweetie. Hi, sweetie. Hi. Hello. Hello.",
        "Jordan: He's okay. He's okay.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, he's okay.",
        "Jordan: Don't ever do that to me again. Okay, buddy? Is that a deal? Okay?",
        "Jennifer: That was so scary.",
        "Jordan: I haven't breathed since he was gone. But, it's okay now, right? Right, Cabot? No harm done. It was just a -- just an innocent mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I came here to invite you to a dinner party! To prove to you that I don't want us at odds with each other anymore. Obviously, you're not ready for that.",
        "Rosanna: What, do you think that endangering my son is part of some sort of peace plan?",
        "Barbara: I would never endanger a child, Rosanna! When did this business with Cabot happen, anyway?",
        "Paul: Yesterday afternoon.",
        "Barbara: Okay, that settles it. You know where I was yesterday afternoon? I was at the Lakeview lounge with Walker. Why don't you call him? Call him and ask him about it, okay?",
        "Paul: Did you already tell him what to say?",
        "Barbara: If Walker's word isn't good enough for you, you can talk to the staff at the Lakeview. I'm sorry to disappoint you, son, but I had nothing to do with what happened with Cabot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: They had her in this old tenement, locked in an elevator. When Jack and I found out that Starziak owned the place, we got down there as fast as we could.",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Any idea why Starziak did that to you?",
        "Molly: Probably because I was agreeing to testify against him.",
        "Holden: Jack's trying to find out more information. But Starziak and his men are pretty good, and I'm not expecting much.",
        "[Door bell]",
        "Carly: Hi. Jack told me -- Molly! Are you all right?",
        "Molly: I think so.",
        "Carly: I have been so worried about you. You sure you're all right?",
        "Molly: I think I am.",
        "Carly: Did you go to the hospital?",
        "Molly: No.",
        "Carly: Well, I should take you. Don't you think you should go?",
        "Molly: No. No, thanks. I really just wanna stay right here.",
        "Lily: I think Carly's right. I think you should go to the hospital to be checked out.",
        "Molly: No, no, no! They're just gonna put me in one of those little cubicles, and they'll make me wait there forever!",
        "Holden: No, it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to go anywhere, all right? The paramedics checked her out, they said she was fine. And if something comes up, we'll just take her to the hospital when she's feeling more up to it.",
        "Carly: Want me to stay with you tonight? Honey, I don't want you to be alone.",
        "Molly: Oh, no, no. I won't be. Holden said I could stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Boys, boys, boys. You had three chances to kidnap Lucy and you blew every one of them. That adds up to your fault.",
        "Wade: Maybe yes, maybe no. But we still put in the time. And professionals -- they get paid for their time, Montgomery.",
        "Donny: So we decided to get creative.",
        "Craig: Well, you can be creative somewhere else. We got Lucy back from Dusty. Your services, such as they are, are no longer required.",
        "Wade: Is she still staying at Granny's?",
        "Craig: Why are you still watching her?",
        "Wade: So we know where to get in touch with her when we want to tell her that it was her father that set her up to be kidnapped.",
        "Craig: What do you want?",
        "Wade: A million dollars. And we forget we ever met you.",
        "Craig: I don't think so.",
        "Wade: We can make it two. Call us when you get the cash.",
        "Donny: Don't take too long.",

        "Lucy: Dusty, what are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: Checkin' up on you, what else? You look good. How do you feel?",
        "Lucy: Fine. I've been worried about you.",
        "Dusty: Did you get my message?",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah, Nikki told me that you were all right, but I feel better now that I've seen you.",
        "Dusty: Me, too. So this is the Ivory Tower, huh? I'm telling you right now, I haven't seen one that looks like this since I was dating Lily.",
        "Lucy: Lily, my Aunt Lily?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we were kids. In love.",
        "Lucy: Uh-huh?",
        "Dusty: What does that mean? You surprised or somethin'? Tell me by what? By what? That she loved me, or that we were kids?",
        "Lucy: Both. But let's not --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, let's not get into details.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but there is one thing I wanna know. How did you get in here?",
        "Dusty: Easily. And if I can get in here, other people can get in here. That's not good.",
        "Lucy: I know. But I -- well, you know, I have an intercom and a panic button. And I can usually scream pretty loud. That is when I don't have tape over my mouth.",
        "Dusty: I didn't like doin' it.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Whatever. Listen to me. You gotta lay low. Don't trust anybody.",
        "Lucy: Are you still trying to find those guys who kidnapped me?",
        "Dusty: I'm about to find them. I got a good lead today.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lucinda: Lucy, is everything okay? [Knock on door] Lucy? Let me hear your voice please, dear. Oh --",
        "Lucy: Um -- I was just brushing my hair.",
        "Lucinda: I thought I heard voices.",
        "Lucy: Well, I had the radio on. I just turned it off. Lucinda Oh? Honey, did you open this? Did you open this?",
        "Lucy: Um -- yes. I wanted to see the sky.",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Lucy: Because -- well, it's a little weird. It's -- kind of personal. You said you heard voices? I was -- I was wishing on a star.",
        "Lucinda: Out loud?",
        "Lucy: Well, Mom said that's the only way that it'll come true. Of course, that was back in third grade and I should've grown out of it by now, but --",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm all for keeping traditions alive, but I do think we should -- you know, let's hold back on the wishing.",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: All right, darling? The door is involved in the alarm system, you see. The air is on. You'll be okay.",
        "Lucy: I'd like to keep it open. If that's okay? Just for a little bit. I'm enjoying the fresh air.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Please, not too long. Let's not tempt fate. Hey, you know, maybe I should wish on a star. But what need would I have for that when you're home safe? It'll be over soon. It will, sweetheart. It'll be over soon and we can get back to normal.",
        "Lucy: Normal? Grandmother, I honestly don't remember what that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Both: I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: I don't know, it must be the hormones. I can feel them coursing through my body all ready.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. And I've been so preoccupied with Tom and Doc.",
        "Jessica: Of course you have. And I understand that, but you know, Margo, you have to get that all behind you now. You have to really want it. You have to believe in your heart that all this business with Doc is over or Tom is never gonna believe it.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. I hope I can pull it off.",
        "Jessica: Now you can't just hope. You have to stay away from this guy.",
        "Margo: I'm trying. But we always somehow end up together.",
        "Jessica: Well, no more, okay? No more accidental run-ins, no more slip-ups, no more \"I don't know what happened, I just lost my mind.\" Doc Reese has got to get out of our lives. From now on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: So, shall I sit, or would you rather I stand at attention?",
        "Kim: Oh, come on, Doc. I don't feel like kidding about this. Sit down. This letter was sent to me at the station. It has some pretty unflattering things to say about you.",
        "Doc: Somebody didn't like my broadcast? You know sports fans.",
        "Kim: I think it's a little more personal than that. Do you know a woman named Jill?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I won't hold this against you, Rosanna. You're a mother. You're concerned about your baby. But I am telling you, I had nothing to do with what happened with Cabot. I didn't go near him.",
        "Rosanna: Then who brought Cabot downstairs?",
        "Barbara: I'm sure you'll find out that answer in time. So, will you be coming to our dinner?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I frankly don't know. Paul and I have to discuss it. We'll let you know.",
        "Barbara: Well, do your best. It just won't be the same without you.",
        "Jennifer: You're still here? Is everything okay?",
        "Barbara: I'll let them fill you in. I'll talk to you soon, honey.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, how's my little man? How's my little man? Did you guys have a good time? Huh?",
        "Jordan: Great.",
        "Rosanna: What happened?",
        "Jordan: We were sitting in Java having a cup of coffee and Cabot was in his stroller right next to us. The next thing you know, we look down and there's a different baby sitting there.",
        "Rosanna: What? What are you -- what?",
        "Jennifer: It's not as bad as it sounds. This other woman had the same stroller that Cabot has, and she took him by mistake.",
        "Paul: You didn't see this happening?",
        "Jordan: Don't try to make this my fault.",
        "Paul: Well, who else can I blame? You weren't paying any attention?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, he was, Paul! Now back off!",
        "Paul: This can't be a coincidence.",
        "Jordan: What do you mean coincidence? What --?",
        "Rosanna: We're going to have to tell him.",
        "Paul: We don't have to tell him anything.",
        "Rosanna: Look, the other day, Cabot was upstairs in the nursery and then suddenly he was down here in the living room. [Cabot cries] hey, it's okay. It's okay. And Paul and I, and the new maid, iris, we were all here in the house. None of us moved him.",
        "Jordan: Then how did he end up --?",
        "Paul: That's what we all want to know.",
        "Jordan: Well, why didn't you tell me?",
        "Rosanna: I didn't want to upset you.",
        "Jordan: You thought I was involved.",
        "Rosanna: I couldn't take the chance.",
        "Jordan: Let's get something straight, again. I would never, ever jeopardize my son, Rosanna. I love him as much as you do.",
        "Paul: Oh! You almost lost you own child! That's a sterling testament to the glory of your fatherhood!",
        "Rosanna: Please, let's not fight. Look, instead of fighting with each other, we should be trying to figure this out.",
        "Jordan: Well, I'm going to start by calling the police.",
        "Paul: And say what? Cabot's here. He's fine. And we don't know anything? Besides, we already know who's responsible. This has Stenbeck written all over it. But if I know my father, this is just the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Barbara: Promise me you're not going to harm that child.",
        "James: Me? Harm a child? Barbara, why do you always make me out to be the villain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for caring.",
        "Jordan: James has no reason to put Cabot in danger. The boy is his grandson. He has a connection.",
        "Paul: You still don't get it, do you? The closer you are to James, the more he can manipulate you.",
        "Jordan: Even little babies?",
        "Paul: Well, look what he did to you, Jordan.",
        "Jennifer: I'm no Stenbeck expert, but why would James want to make us worry about Cabot?",
        "Paul: James is psychotic. Who knows what his motives are.",
        "Rosanna: So what do we do?",
        "Paul: Here's what we do -- the four of us will make a pact right now. One of us -- one of us will always be with Cabot, watching him. Not doing anything else, not being distracted. Watching him as if life depends on it.",
        "Rosanna: Because it might. Let's do it.",
        "Jordan: Works for me. Jen?",
        "Jennifer: Of course, of course. Whatever we have to do.",
        "Paul: Okay, settled. I'll take the first shift. You're tired. I'll do it.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jordan: I'm going to take Jen home and I will be right back.",
        "Jennifer: Good night. Just call if you need anything.",
        "Paul: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Jen.",
        "Rosanna: I'm going to get Cabot ready.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Get some sleep. I'll take care of it. I can handle it.",
        "Rosanna: You're proving that more every day. I can't tell you what a comfort it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I have an urge to tuck you in and kiss you, but I'm not going to do that. Um -- what can I do? I'll turn down the bed. Here I go. Voila! Hoopla. Hoopla. There, sweetheart. All right. Nothing else I can do, right?",
        "Lucy: Nope, nope. Nothing.",
        "Lucinda: Good night.",
        "Lucy: Good night.",
        "Dusty: Let me tell you something. You got major dust bunnies under here. I thought for sure your grandmother was going to break into a bedtime story for you.",
        "Lucy: She needs someone to spoil.",
        "Dusty: That's very sweet. I just didn't want to spend the night under your bed, you know?",
        "Lucy: You said you had a lead on the guys who were after me.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Starziak gave me a tip on Donald Creel. You know, the guy with the tattoo.",
        "Lucy: They're dangerous, Dusty. Don't go after them by yourself.",
        "Dusty: I got to get out of here before your grandma comes back in here with a cookie for you. You're a tough girl, Montgomery. Too bad nobody in your family knows it.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, wait. Um -- there's something I want you to have.",

        "Lily: I know Molly's been through a lot. But don't you think you should have talked to me first about her staying here?",
        "Holden: Just like you discussed Craig with me?",
        "Lily: Is that what this is? This is about Craig?",
        "Holden: No. You're right. I should've discussed it with you. But when I found Molly, she was shaking. Lily, she could barely stand on her own two feet. And the next thing out of my mouth was, \"you're coming home with me.\" I didn't think, I just said it.",
        "Lily: I probably would've done the same thing. I just -- I don't want the children asking all kinds of questions.",
        "Holden: The kids love Molly. They'll be happy that she's here. It's not going to be for long. It's just until she starts getting her strength back, until she starts feeling a little more secure. It's just going to be for a couple of days. That's it.",

        "Carly: You feeling any better?",
        "Molly: Yeah. Every time I close my eyes I just see the walls of the elevator. I thought I could see them move, closing in on me, little by little --",
        "Carly: Must've been awful. I think now you just have to try to forget about it.",
        "Molly: Shouldn't Holden be back by now?",
        "Carly: Yeah, he'll be back in a minute. He just needed to talk to Lily.",
        "Molly: About me.",
        "Carly: Or about one of the kids. You don't know. Molly, I really want you to come home and stay with me tonight. The kids would love it. And then jack would make you feel totally protected.",
        "Molly: I know you mean well, Carly, but Holden promised I could stay here. He told me I would feel safe. Thanks to him, I really do.",

        "Doc: She saying I broke the law?",
        "Kim: I don't think that's the kind of close encounter she had in mind. She seems pretty confident that you wouldn't want to have this information made public.",
        "Doc: Wait a second. Did you say Jill?",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Doc: Yeah, I know who that is.",
        "Kim: Why am I not surprised?",
        "Doc: She's a waitress over at the Groves Country Club. Young, absolutely confused -- you know, she actually made a pass at me several times, and I just told her I wasn't interested.",
        "Kim: So you're saying that she wrote this letter out of revenge?",

        "Margo: Jess, whoa. Such a big deal that Doc Reese to come to WOAK. \"Doctor Death\" -- a shoo-in for the hall of fame. If only he had stuck to sports.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well -- you know, that's just the thing with this guy. Everything is sports with him, including relationships. And he doesn't care who's the loser, just as long as he's the winner.",
        "Margo: Cute dimples, though, huh? The kind that make a strong woman lose her mind.",
        "Jessica: You know, can we just stop talking about Doc Reese for a minute? It's starting to turn my stomach. Or maybe it's morning sickness.",
        "Margo: Tell me about -- what did Dr. Schiller say? Is everything okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, yeah. So far, so good. There's my baby's dad.",

        "James: My sweet, little Barbara doesn't want to get her hands dirty.",
        "Barbara: Listen to me, whatever you're doing, it's working. They're all on edge. They have no idea what's going on. But I want to make something very clear, all right?",
        "James: Anything.",
        "Barbara: Promise me you're not gonna hurt that child.",
        "James: Me? Harm a child? Barbara, why do you always make me out to be the villain?",
        "Barbara: Stop playing games with me, all right? I've just came from Fairwinds. I heard about Cabot being mysteriously picked up and moved about. How are you doing that?",
        "James: Barbara, take a moment to reflect. I'm in solitary confinement. I spend my days reading, contemplating -- nothing more.",
        "Barbara: Paul and Rosanna think that I'm involved. I've already been accused.",
        "James: Doesn't surprise me. Paul's always been an ingrate.",

        "James: Barbara, how many times do I have to tell you? Stay in the moment. Enjoy the ride. Besides, if we all knew what was gonna happen next, well, life would hardly be worth living.",
