        "Casey calls Emily, but she is steadfast in her resolve to stay away from him, as she hangs up. Margo catches Casey on the phone with Emily and starts in on him. After a pause, Meg and Paul marry, but their happiness is short-lived when Mike shows up wanting to talk with Paul. Tom wants to whisk Margo away for their anniversary, but she doesn't want to go. Casey pleads with her to not pass this up on his account. Margo can't let go of her worry about Casey and Emily, which causes a fight between she and Tom. Mike questions Paul about Sophie's bracelet being found on his grounds. Paul has an answer for it and Mike leaves, but Meg continues to worry. Barbara toasts the couple and wishes them a happy life now, as Paul and Meg can't help wonder what she did to get them that. Mike sees that Paul has just planted new roses \u0096 on his wedding day. Casey goes to see Emily to tell her that he still wants to be with her, and even though Emily is tempted especially after he tells her that his parents have left for the night, she pushes him away and they say goodbye. Margo realizes that she has the upper hand when it comes to Emily with what she knows about her past, so she suddenly decides she will go away with Tom. Mike speaks with Lisa and then the maid outside Sophie's room and learns that Paul was the last person at her room. Meg and Paul talk about their life and the predicament they are in because of Sophie's untimely death and the subsequent cover up. Meg is dedicated to being by Paul's side as his wife and admits that she has forgiven him; they will get through this together. Tom and Margo leave for the night. Emily finds herself outside of Casey's house watching him and wanting to be with him. She decides to leave, but Casey sees her and convinces her to stay. Meg has trouble sleeping so she ends up in the rose garden where she finds Mike; they have an argument about why he is so interested in helping Sophie after all she has done. Mike voices his concern that Paul might have done something and that he has forced her into a cover up. Meg defends Paul and orders Mike to stay away from her and off their property. Meg races back to tell Paul what happened. While she is gone, Mike goes digging. Paul doesn't find Mike when he gets back to the rose garden; Meg is sure Mike has left because he has a plan. Tom and Margo's trip gets interrupted before it is even underway when Tom gets a business call and has to head back to Oakdale. Casey and Emily are getting frisky and undressing in the living room. Mike goes to see Jack at the police station. Margo finds Emily, clad only in her underwear in her kitchen with wine glasses. A horrified Emily claims it isn't what it looks like, but an ice cold Margo takes out her gun and points it at Emily telling her that she found an intruder in her home and she has to protect her son."

        "Emily: Well, you know, George Clooney is taking me to Rome for pasta. [Kelly laughs] Get out of here. Go have some fun. No onions. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Casey: Emily, it's me.",
        "Emily: I thought we decided.",
        "Casey: No, no, no. You decided.",
        "Emily: Casey, I'm really busy.",
        "Casey: Too busy to even just say hi?",
        "Emily: I'm on deadline.",
        "Casey: You know I could help you with that. I work really, really good under pressure. You know, in fact -- come on, Emily.",
        "Margo: Hey, Casey. What's up?",
        "Casey: Hey. I didn't hear you.",
        "Margo: I know. Who were you calling?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you say that last line again -- the important one?",
        "Judge: Do you, Meg, take this man, Paul, to be your husband? Do you promise to be a loving and loyal wife? To cherish and keep him through sickness and health and, forsaking all others, be loyal only to him as long as you both shall live? Meg?",
        "Meg: Yes. Yes, I do.",
        "Judge: Then, by the power invested in me by the state of Illinois, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",
        "Barbara: Okay, you two. [Barbara laughs] I think it's time we go in and have a little champagne. Judge?",
        "Judge: Yes?",
        "Barbara: Has anyone ever told you you have a very impressive speaking voice?",
        "Paul: My mother's happy.",
        "Meg: I'm happy. It's just --",
        "Paul: I know. Look, everything changes now. We're married. This is what we've always wanted. And I, for one, am gonna spend the rest of my life proving to you just how grateful I am for you.",
        "Meg: I'm grateful, too. I really am.",
        "Mike: Meg, Paul, congratulations.",
        "Paul: Mike, what are you still doing here?",
        "Meg: Yeah, there's really nothing left to say.",
        "Mike: I wish that were true. But unfortunately, Paul and I have something we need to talk about. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I know you're talking to Emily. You said her name.",
        "Casey: Then why are you even asking me?",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, Casey. I'm not trying to invade your privacy.",
        "Casey: What privacy? It doesn't seem to me like I have any.",
        "Margo: Could you just let me be worried about you? You don't even work for Emily anymore, and she is twice -- yes, she is twice your age, so why do you even want to talk to her?",
        "Casey: Oh, that's really good, Mom. It's like I'm too immature to pick out my friends now? Yes, thank you for the support.",
        "Margo: Oh, just stop it. I know when I'm being played. You're trying to play me. I haven't said anything to your father.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Casey: Oh, but -- oh, here it comes. Come on.",
        "Margo: Well, I will if you don't --",
        "Tom: You will what?",
        "Margo: I will throw away any of the clothes I find on your bedroom floor Tomorrow.",
        "[Casey laughs]",
        "Tom: Guess what. You get a reprieve, Dude. She's not even gonna be here Tomorrow.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Margo: What? I'm not? I'm not?",
        "Tom: No. Do you think that we're gonna celebrate 25 years of marital bless with a couple sandwiches in front of the television? No, no. I have already secured the honeymoon suite at the four star Lake Geneva Lodge. Spa package, massages, champagne, gourmet food -- it's booked.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. Oh, Baby, I can't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm really sorry, but this is important.",
        "Paul: You got some nerve, Mike.",
        "Meg: I'm sure it could wait until morning.",
        "Mike: I just need to talk to Paul for a couple of minutes.",
        "Barbara: Is there a problem here?",
        "Paul: Yeah, there is a problem. This jerk here can't keep his mouth shut.",
        "Meg: Paul, hey, it's okay. Its okay, Barbara. We just need a minute. There seems to be a crisis with the project.",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on.",
        "Meg: It'll just be a minute.",
        "Barbara: You know, you've got some sense of timing. Most people will find a way to keep their mouth shut when there's a wedding going on and handle a crisis by themselves.",
        "Meg: Please, Barbara. You know, why don't you go entertain the judge and we'll be there in a minute? I promise.",
        "Barbara: You're being remarkably tolerant.",
        "Paul: Why don't you run in with my mom?",
        "Meg: No. We're together on this. I'm your wife now.",
        "Paul: Okay, Mike. What is it that can't wait?",
        "Mike: This. This was Sofie's. [Mike shows Paul Sofie's black bracelet] I recognized it from the party when she had all of her jewelry on display.",
        "Paul: So?",
        "Mike: I just found it now, in your garden. Right over there.",
        "Paul: You found this in my garden?",
        "Mike: That's right.",
        "Paul: Well, alert the media. I mean, however did you keep yourself from stopping the wedding? I mean, what could possibly be more important than finding a piece of jewelry designed by somebody who spent a great deal of time here?",
        "Mike: It seems to bother you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, it bothers me, Mike. It bothers me because this day is really important to me, and this day is really important to Meg. And maybe, just maybe, we don't want to talk about Sofie right now.",
        "Mike: Good offense, huh?",
        "Paul: Look, not that I owe you an explanation, but when my mom asked me to back Sofie's designs, she did a lot of work here in the garden. She said that she liked to see her work in natural light.",
        "Mike: Okay, right. Well, I'm really sorry, Meg, but I had to ask.",
        "Meg: And you got an answer.",
        "Paul: Don't trip on your way out.",
        "Mike: Congratulations.",
        "Meg: Was she wearing something like that when you buried her?",
        "Paul: Stop, stop. Please. Let's not talk about Sofie. I handled it.",
        "Meg: Yes, you lied beautifully. I think we're both gonna get pretty good at that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: What did you just say?",
        "Margo: I can't.",
        "Casey: Mom --",
        "Tom: Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get this reservation?",
        "Margo: I know. I'm really sorry, Baby, and I wish I could. And I should, but you didn't give me any notice. I can't just leave town like that.",
        "Tom: Well, that's not going to fly. I already called the police station to make sure you were covered for tonight. You're not even on call.",
        "Casey: No, Dad. This isn't about work. This is because of me, isn't it?",
        "Margo: Wait a minute. I don't like being double-teamed.",
        "Casey: And I don't like constantly messing things up for you guys. Go, have fun. I will be fine.",
        "Tom: What is it that you're worried about? You think this kid doesn't know how to order pizza? I've seen him do it a hundred times. I'm sure he can take care of himself for one night.",
        "Margo: No, no. You don't understand.",
        "Tom: Yeah, you're right. I don't understand. We have a lot to celebrate, and we deserve some time away.",
        "Margo: I know.",
        "Tom: 25th wedding anniversary. Does that mean anything to you?",
        "Casey: Mom, Mom. Please, listen. Go with Dad, and you won't have to worry about anything. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: No. I just wanted to know if we could have dinner tonight. But if you're on call, it's okay. Mom, I'm fine. It's no big deal. We'll do it another night. I love you, too, Mother. Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Mom, please don't let me be responsible for ruining your --",
        "Margo: I --",
        "Casey: No, no. Look. Thanks to me, you and Dad haven't been having a lot of good times lately. Please? I'll be a model citizen. Okay. I'm out of here. I've tried my best, Dad. It's your time to seal the deal.",
        "Margo: Where are you going?",
        "Casey: Stop thinking about me. Think about the man you've been married to for 25 years.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Tom: Kid has a point.",
        "Margo: Really, listen. I'm not trying to be unreasonable.",
        "Tom: Look, I know how worried you are about Casey, but the fact is, we cannot monitor him 24/7. The other fact is --",
        "Margo: Is what?",
        "Tom: I don't want this to get too heavy at this point, but this is not about just one night away. We need to start to carve out some time for you and I to be together. I love being his dad, but I want to be your husband, too.",
        "Margo: You do? Even after 25 years?",
        "Tom: Yeah, I do.",
        "Margo: I do, too. You know that, don't you?",
        "Tom: Yeah, I do. So let's get the hell out of here. I mean, the fact that we want to be together still after 25 years, isn't that a cause to celebrate?",
        "Margo: Yeah, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. But why did he walk out without telling me anything? Telling me not to worry. Why did he do that? Why?",
        "Tom: Probably because he doesn't want to feel like he's still in prison. All right, I give.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Tom: It doesn't matter what we say or what we do. It doesn't matter if I take you to the moon or Lake Geneva. You're still just gonna be there worrying about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Listen, you came through on such short notice. The least we can do is offer you a drink.",
        "Judge: Oh, I'm sorry. I won't be able to stay. My daughter's visiting with her kids.",
        "Meg: Oh, how nice.",
        "Judge: I never thought I'd get to the point where I'd rather read \"Good Night, Moon\" than drink champagne.",
        "Paul: Some other time, then. Thank you so much.",
        "Judge: My pleasure.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: I'll walk you out.",
        "Judge: Meg, Paul -- all my best. Have a happy, happy life together.",
        "Meg: Thank you very much.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Judge: Bye.",
        "Paul: What were they doing when we came in?",
        "Meg: You don't know? Your mom was showing him pictures of Johnny and Hallie.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Meg: She's always so considerate. She never talks about the grandchildren around me.",
        "Paul: Sorry.",
        "Meg: I can't help that it was horrible.",
        "Paul: I know.",
        "Meg: I mean, I was getting married. In the middle of being married, I was thinking of the baby -- your baby and Mike and --",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: I don't know if I can keep this up, Paul. Like nothing happened.",
        "Paul: Meg, this, right now -- this is the worst part. But it'll get better. It'll take some time, but it will get better.",
        "Meg: How? What happened, it's done.",
        "Paul: I think we need to make our lives count for something. I didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. And Sofie was dying when I got there. We didn't kill anybody. But if we let Sofie ruin our lives from the grave, that would be a sin. Especially you. You, Meg -- you do deserve to be happy.",
        "Barbara: I know what you're thinking.",
        "Paul: You do?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I do. You're wondering how much longer I'm gonna hang around. And I promise you that one more picture, one more glass of champagne, one more toast, and I'll be gone.",
        "Meg: Barbara, we are so glad that you are here. I need you to know that.",
        "Barbara: I do know that. I just want you to know that I'm not going to settle in for the night.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: So -- Paul, Meg. Looking at the two of you in that beautiful, beautiful garden, I realized that I was happier -- happier than I can ever remember being. And now I have another beautiful daughter in my life. I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Paul: It wouldn't be a wedding if mother didn't cry.",
        "Barbara: Mothers always cry. Don't you know that?",
        "Paul: Yes. I have a toast to make, as well. My mom's right. You make people happy. Not a lot of people in this world like that. I'm not like that.",
        "Barbara: Who says?",
        "Paul: Me. It's kind of true. Meg, I promise I'll always celebrate you, do everything I can to let you be you. To Meg. All my love.",
        "Barbara: To Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: It's your wedding day, Paul, and you still find time to putter around the garden.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Emily: You shouldn't be here.",
        "Casey: This is what happens when you hang up on me. I come looking for you.",
        "Emily: I can see that.",
        "Casey: We got to talk about this Emily. The other day, I said, \"I love you,\" and you just shut down.",
        "Emily: You kind of skipped over what I told you.",
        "Casey: I don't care about your past, you know? God knows I'm the last person to pass any judgment.",
        "Emily: Case, you and me, it's got disaster written all over it.",
        "Casey: I totally disagree. You're one of the best things that's ever happened to me. No, no. You probably are the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Emily: Don't say that.",
        "Casey: No, no, listen. I'm not gonna let you go just because you're scared of my mother.",
        "Emily: I have to be afraid of your mother. I could lose my son.",
        "Casey: Damn it, that's bull, okay?",
        "Emily: I don't think it is. And I don't think anybody else thinks it is. I understand why your mother would be upset.",
        "Casey: It's not like she's perfect. She's made mistakes.",
        "Emily: Casey, would you listen to me? I was a prostitute. I slept with her husband. I slept with her husband's brother. Do you have any idea what it would do to her to find out I was sleeping with you?",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. I'll back off.",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Casey: We don't go public, okay?",
        "Emily: Casey, Casey, I'm serious.",
        "Casey: No, I'm following your rules. I'll meet you anywhere -- Chicago, Hong Kong -- just as long as I end up with you.",
        "Emily: Listen to me. The other day after you left, your mother came here. She knows something's going on between us.",
        "Casey: We'll be careful.",
        "Emily: How can you say that? How can we say that? And on top of everything, she's a cop. She's a good cop.",
        "Casey: Exactly, and she needs to take a time-out, too. Like tonight. My parents are gone. The house is empty. I know we've been having a lot of fun on the desk, but wouldn't it be wonderful to be in the same bed all night long?",
        "[Emily moans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Please, come on, Tom. Tom, don't walk out of here.",
        "Tom: Why, so we can stand around and talk about Casey some more?",
        "Margo: You don't --",
        "Tom: Understand? Correct. I do not understand.",
        "Margo: He's calling Emily. He's going to see Emily.",
        "Tom: So what?",
        "Margo: So what? It's so wrong. He's our son. He's young. He's got his whole life ahead of him, and why is he so suddenly taken with her?",
        "Tom: Maybe, and this is just a guess, maybe she doesn't monitor him 24/7. Perhaps she even listens to what he has to say?",
        "Margo: Well, if there's anyone who would know how understanding Emily is, how comforting Emily is, it's you.",
        "Tom: That I am not gonna talk about on my anniversary.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Tom: Look, I know you have trouble dealing with Emily. I know you wish that they were not friends. But she is not a threat to you. She can't hurt you, and she can't hurt our family.",
        "[Margo remembering]",
        "Emily: You love threatening me, don't you, Margo?",
        "Margo: I know things about you, Emily -- things that you've left off your resume, things that you don't want Tom to know, or he would never let you near Daniel again.",
        "Emily: You've made your point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You're right.",
        "Tom: What did you say?",
        "Margo: If I don't push, the situation will resolve itself.",
        "Tom: Who are you, and what did you do with my wife?",
        "Margo: You give me five minutes to pack a bag, and then we are out of here.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm glad I talked you into it, but I wish I had a clue how I did it.",
        "Margo: It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. When we're alone, I will not talk about Casey. I will not talk about her. I will only talk about you and me.",
        "Tom: Sweet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, Casey. Casey, we cannot do this. I can't do this.",
        "Casey: Come home with me. I'll call my parents.",
        "Emily: What? Do you hear yourself? Your parents' house?",
        "Casey: Yes, that's what it is. It's my parents' house, and I have a room there -- no, a cell.",
        "Emily: Okay, calm down.",
        "Casey: And I'm sick of it.",
        "Emily: Casey, calm down.",
        "Casey: No, okay. I made a big mistake. Okay, a couple of mistakes. But this is not a life.",
        "Emily: You will get over me. You will get over us. Babe, there are a million girls out there for you.",
        "Casey: But there's only one you. And I can't have you. Not because you and I don't want each other. It's because it's part of my punishment somehow. Some way, it was decided that my mom gets to call all the shots in my life.",
        "Emily: She's protecting you.",
        "Casey: Stop defending her! I get it, okay? She's won.",
        "Emily: Casey, don't go.",
        "Casey: No, no, no, seriously, I understand. It's fine. I won't say anything.",
        "Emily: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Casey: No problem. I'm gonna miss you.",
        "Emily: I'll miss you, too, Case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Oh, yes?",
        "Mike: I still can't find Sofie.",
        "Lisa: Oh. Well, I'm not surprised.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Lisa: Oh, Honey, look, the little girl leaves the way she did -- obviously, she doesn't want to be found.",
        "Mike: And you think that seems like the way she would normally act?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, of course I do. You don't understand this, Darling, but she is a conniving, scheming, manipulative little person.",
        "Mike: And she's clingy, too. She's always looking for someone to take care of her.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Mike: So, she just takes off on her own when she finds out she's pregnant?",
        "Lisa: I am so sick and tired of talking and thinking about that pitiful little woman. She's caused more pain to the people I love.",
        "Mike: You're right about that. It's only gonna get worse.",
        "Mike: Excuse me. Do you always work this floor? I'm looking for the woman who lived in that room, Sofie Duran.",
        "Maid: You mean the one who took off without leaving a tip?",
        "Mike: Do you remember anything else about the way she left?",
        "Maid: No. So, maybe you should ask Mr. Ryan about that.",
        "Mike: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You, my son. You married her.",
        "Paul: I know.",
        "Barbara: What took you so long? [Paul chuckles] You're gonna be very, very, very happy, I know. Bye.",
        "Meg: Do you think she's gonna be all right?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Meg: But if she killed Sofie --",
        "Paul: Stop.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So you're saying you saw him come out of her room, and the next morning she was gone? All right. Well, here. This is to make up for the tip that you didn't get.",
        "Maid: Thank you.",
        "Mike: One more thing -- if Mr. Ryan should come by again, don't tell him I was asking about anything, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Oh, you're such a liar.",
        "Meg: Paul, please tell me again.",
        "Paul: I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.",
        "Meg: That's good. But what I really want you to tell me is that we will get past this.",
        "Paul: You didn't do anything wrong. You don't have any reason to feel guilty.",
        "Meg: You're not answering my question.",
        "Paul: Yes, I think we can get past this, if --",
        "Meg: If?",
        "Paul: If you can forgive me.",
        "Meg: Remember when the judge asked me if I'd take you to be my husband and I didn't answer?",
        "Paul: It took you like an hour to answer, but you said yes.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: That's because I was raised to believe that vows really mean something. And by saying yes, I meant that I said yes to you and me being married, not yes to covering up what happened to Sofie or protecting you or your mother.",
        "Paul: But you did say yes.",
        "Meg: I said yes because I want to be your wife.",
        "Paul: Well, and I'm so glad.",
        "Meg: And that means that I have forgiven you.",
        "Paul: I think none of this would have happened if I --",
        "Meg: Okay, you know, if I've forgiven you, let's just please forget, okay? I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Paul: Okay. I'll work on that.",
        "Meg: I don't want you to work on it. It's not some kind of parole you're on or something. No, no matter what else happened today, we got married.",
        "Paul: Yes, we did.",
        "Meg: And it's a fresh start, right? I mean, husband and wife, 50/50.",
        "Paul: You make me very happy.",
        "Meg: We will get past this. We will. \u0096",

        "Margo: Okay, I got a couple of bottles of water for the trip.",
        "Tom: Good.",
        "Casey: Oh, so you're gonna go after all?",
        "Margo: Yep.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I talked her into it. Oh, by the way, Case, there's a note over here with a number for the lodge, all right?",
        "Casey: Yes, and I'm not calling you. I want you guys to have a great time and not worry about anything, okay?",
        "Tom: Fine by me.",
        "Margo: Hey, Case. You're back kind of soon.",
        "Casey: My plans fell through.",
        "Margo: Sorry.",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Margo: I am. I'm your mom. I want you to be happy. I want you to be very happy.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.",
        "Tom: Time out. Excuse me. Are we now having one of those conversations that I have no idea what we're talking about?",
        "Casey: Yeah, so get out of here, please. Go. You're wasting lodge time here, talking to me. I have a date with a pizza.",
        "Margo: I left $20 there by the note. And there are some blueberries in the refrigerator for your cereal.",
        "Casey: Blueberries, great. Dad, get her out of here.",
        "Tom: Woman, we are no longer wanted here.",
        "Margo: Bye.",
        "Casey: Guys, hey, have a great time, okay?",
        "Tom: Hey, thanks. Are you gonna give me any hint as to what you two were talking about?",
        "Margo: He was just telling me that I don't have to worry.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Margo: Let's go.",

        "Emily: This is stupid. This is really stupid.",
        "Casey: No, Emily! Emily!",
        "Emily: Hi. I think this is --",
        "Casey: No, it's okay. They're gone. They're gone. It's fine.",
        "Emily: It's not fine. It's not fine. I shouldn't have done this.",
        "Casey: No, but you did. Thank God you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Who's there?",
        "Mike: It's me.",
        "Meg: You came back.",
        "Mike: So did you. Why?",
        "Meg: You know, I really thought you were my friend.",
        "Mike: I am your friend.",
        "Meg: Then why are you doing this to me?",
        "Mike: What am I doing to you? I'm just trying --",
        "Meg: You know what, Mike? You're usually pretty direct, but you've been showing up out of nowhere with strange questions and veiled accusations, and now you're trespassing on my property.",
        "Mike: I want to know what happened to Sofie.",
        "Meg: Why? Why are you so interested in Sofie all of a sudden? Why has she become so important to you?",
        "Mike: Look, I don't quite know.",
        "Meg: Do you like her? This girl that cried rape, this girl that tried to murder my mother-in-law?",
        "Mike: Oh, so what, she had it coming? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Meg: I didn't say that! I don't mean that. Why do you assume that something happened to her? I mean, why couldn't she have just run away?",
        "Mike: Because she was pregnant and she was scared, so I think we need to at least find out where the hell she went.",
        "Meg: Why do you even care? Why?",
        "Mike: Look, either everybody matters or nobody matters.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, what about me and Paul? Do we matter?",
        "Mike: Why did you marry him?",
        "Meg: I love him.",
        "Mike: I didn't finish my question. Why did you marry him today? What was the rush?",
        "Meg: His mother wanted it, all right?",
        "Mike: Why, so you couldn't testify against him?",
        "Meg: Okay, you've crossed way too many lines. I am not listening to this.",
        "Mike: You know, I don't care, Meg. You are too smart and too decent to be part of some cover-up. She was pregnant with Paul's baby and he doesn't care what happened? She's out there someplace. He should at least want to know where she is so he can at least send some money. Or does he know that wherever she is, she can't use it?",
        "Meg: Don't say that! Your hands are dirty.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I was just admiring your garden. The roses were planted today, weren't they?",
        "Meg: Yeah, for the wedding. We got married today. But, you know, you would know that because you were spying on us.",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: I was not spying. I was watching. And I'm gonna keep watching.",
        "Meg: I think you need to go, and don't come back.",
        "Mike: I am not giving up on this.",
        "Meg: I'm getting Paul.",
        "Mike: Why, so he can take care of me, too?",
        "Meg: Stop it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, hey. Hey, Mike's in the garden and there's dirt on his hands and he's asking about the rosebushes.",
        "Paul: It's okay. You stay here. Stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: We don't get a lot of time like this, you know, outside the office, in a real house, like real people.",
        "Emily: Mmm. Somehow, I don't think I count as \"Real people.\"",
        "Casey: Oh, you do to me. All the stuff I've grown up with, people I've known all my life -- they don't seem real to me. But you do.",
        "Emily: Casey, Casey.",
        "Casey: What, what, what, what?",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, just -- leaving your mother out of this --",
        "Casey: Oh, I am all for that.",
        "Emily: Where -- what is this? I mean, where could this ultimately go?",
        "Casey: See, that's what I think the problem is. You know, we try to make it like something we've seen before, what other people do, but it's not. It's what we share, you know? And when we're together, everything's okay. I think we should be together as much as we can. You're safe with me.",
        "Emily: Oh, Babe. You're too young to make me feel safe.",
        "Casey: I really don't think we should be talking anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, I have got to stop worrying about Casey.",
        "Tom: Yeah, Sweetie, you do.",
        "Margo: Mmm.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Margo: Is that a bird?",
        "Tom: No.",
        "Margo: No? Would that be your very private, only-in-emergency line that you never shut down?",
        "Tom: Yeah. Hughes. [Margo sighs] Tell him not to say a word till I get there. It'll probably take me 30 minutes. Right.",
        "Margo: We're going back, aren't we?",
        "Tom: I'll make this up to you, Honey.",
        "Margo: You know what? We got a lot accomplished just to run away.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I kind of think we have.",
        "Margo: Yes. Oh, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir! When operating a moving vehicle, you keep your hands in the 2:00 and 10:00 position at all times.",
        "Tom: What are you, a cop?",
        "Margo: Every day, Baby.",
        "Tom: Call Casey. Tell him we're coming home.",
        "Margo: No, I don't want to. No, I don't want to wake him in case he's already in bed.",

        "Lisa: Well, well, well, well, well. Look at you. I'm so surprised to see you up so late.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm too happy to sleep. Just having a little herbal tea.",
        "Lisa: Oh, good. Too happy to sleep? That's good to hear. That's good to hear. So what happened?",
        "Barbara: Paul and Meg were married earlier today.",
        "Lisa: Oh, I see.",
        "Barbara: Your enthusiasm is overwhelming.",
        "Lisa: No, it's just -- it just seems sudden.",
        "Barbara: They're impetuous.",
        "Lisa: Well, I know, but that's just right after Sofie disappeared. And then they just run off to the altar.",
        "Barbara: I was having a lot more fun before you arrived, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Okay. Honey, Babsy, Darling, you know good and well that I want Paul and Meg to be happy. I'm just worried.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Lisa: Well, Mike was here earlier this evening, and he was -- he was looking for Sofie.",
        "Barbara: What did you tell him?",
        "Lisa: I told him nothing. That didn't seem to stop him.",
        "Barbara: What do you mean, Lisa?",
        "Lisa: Well, he questioned someone on my housekeeping staff, and then he split. He acted like a man with a mission.",
        "Barbara: That little girl certainly has a pension for wanting men to feel sorry for her, even in absentia.",
        "Lisa: Well, I know. But I just can't imagine Mike being so hell-bent on something unless something is possibly wrong.",
        "Barbara: Nothing is wrong. Paul and Meg are married, and that's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mike took off. He must have left when you were coming to get me.",
        "Meg: Did you check the bushes? Had he been digging in there?",
        "Paul: Everything was just the way we left it.",
        "Meg: I don't think he's gonna give up. I really don't.",
        "Paul: Not a whole lot we can do about that, is there?",
        "Meg: Honey, you keep saying that, but --",
        "Paul: But what?",
        "Meg: Why did he leave?",
        "Paul: Because he knew you were coming to get me.",
        "Meg: No, Paul. He's not afraid of you. In fact, he's itching to go one-on-one with you. He left because he has another plan.",
