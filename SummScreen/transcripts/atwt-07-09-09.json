        "Carly continues to drink secretly while Craig blissfully plans the last minute details with Margo to his wedding to Carly. Sage doesn't want to go to her mom's wedding and admits to Jack that she is afraid that Carly will leave town again if Craig wants her to. Jack assures her that will never happen and when he, Janet and Sage arrive at Margo's house for the wedding, Jack even admits to Craig that he is good for Carly. He asks Craig to look after Carly and his kids. When Rosanna sees Carly looking for her secret vodka stash in the oven, she calls Carly on her drinking, as she produces tons of empty vodka bottles that she found hidden throughout the house. Carly tries to deny it at first, but then explains that she used to have a problem but stopped drinking since then. Rosanna continues on Carly not letting her off the hook, as Carly claims she just recently slipped. Rosanna wants her to admit she has a problem and wants Carly to tell Craig. Carly admits to having a small problem (but stops short of admitting she is an alcoholic) and then pleads with Rosanna not to tell Craig on their wedding day. Rosanna finally agrees, but a hurt Carly now wants to get ready on her own and sends Rosanna ahead. Rosanna takes the vodka bottles, but Carly has a small stash she dips into in her purse after Rosanna leaves. While Parker is letting Johnny have some French fries, he squeezes ketchup all over Johnny's shirt and Liberty helps Parker get Johnny all cleaned up. They are able to talk briefly, about what has happened between them recently, as they agree not to put a label on what they are anymore. Carly prepares to go to her wedding, as she drinks more. When Carly gets into the limo, she helps herself to the bar, as the chauffeur can't help but notice. People are noticeably concerned where Carly is when Rosanna shows up alone, as Craig stays positive. Outside, he asks Rosanna why she isn't with her sister and Rosanna admits to what she found out about Carly. Craig doesn't believe her at first, but Rosanna explains what she found. They argue about what is going on and who is to blame, as an inebriated Carly arrives and hears them talking. Carly leaves unnoticed and asks the chauffeur to keep driving her anywhere else but there, as she continues on her binge. The time gets later and the judge needs to go, as Jack wonders where Carly is, as everyone now realizes she is going to be a no show. Sage and Parker are upset, as Jack learns from Rosanna that Carly is drinking again. Everyone leaves, as Craig finally realizes that Carly isn't coming."

        "Luke: You just don't seem very happy.",
        "Noah: Well, next to you, Mr. Sunshine, who would?",
        "Luke: Look, I know it's a lot having your father come back, having him turn up alive.",
        "Noah: Yeah, you know, I just can't figure out which is worse -- seeing how messed up he still is or having to send him back to prison.",
        "Luke: And that's enough to mess with anybody's head. So if you need a little breather before we move in together --",
        "Noah: No, no, I don't. We've been putting this off for too long already.",
        "Luke: Are you sure?",
        "Noah: Are you trying to change my mind?",
        "Luke: No, no. I'm trying to make sure that you're in a -- a good emotional place before making a big life change.",
        "Noah: You been watching more \"Dr. Phil\"?",
        "Luke: No, no. A little bit.",
        "Noah: Hmm.",
        "Luke: But I'm serious! You know, you can be honest with me. I -- I can take it.",
        "Noah: Oh, really?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: So what would you do if I were to tell you that I was having second thoughts?",
        "Luke: Oh, I would freak out.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Noah: See? You are so predictable.",
        "Luke: Is that what it is?! You don't want to be stuck for life with good-old, boring, uninteresting Luke?",
        "Noah: Hey, all I said was \"Predictable.\" Look, I am gonna go to the dorms. Just give me an hour, and I'll meet you back here.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Luke: What what?",
        "Noah: What -- you. What's that look?",

        "Damian: Yes.",
        "Lily: The boys are moving in to their new apartment today, and I want to go by the storage locker and pick out some towels and dishes that I have for them.",
        "Damian: Is it today?",
        "Lily: Yeah. You didn't know?",
        "Damian: No.",
        "Lily: Are you okay?",
        "Damian: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Lily: Your son is moving in with another man.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well -- they love each other.",
        "Lily: Yes, they do.",
        "Damian: And that's not easy to find in this world.",
        "Lily: No, it's not.",
        "Damian: So why wouldn't I be happy with that?",
        "Lily: Let me see if I can think of a reason.",
        "Damian: All right. I admit I wasn't always comfortable with the idea, but Noah's a great man, yes. So I try to look at it like I'm not losing a son. I'm gaining --",
        "Lily: A son.",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Margo went to lie down.",
        "Craig: Is she okay?",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, she just got out of the hospital a couple of days ago, remember?",
        "Craig: I know. I'm glad she's resting. She'll need her strength for the ceremony.",
        "Rosanna: There's not gonna be a wedding, Craig.",
        "Craig: Carly will be here. I know it.",
        "Rosanna: When was she ever this late?",
        "Craig: Sometimes.",
        "Rosanna: I think we need to go find her. We should probably start looking in the bars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Driver: Lady, I can't keep driving forever. I've got other customers who might want to have a drink, too.",
        "Carly: Then why don't you just drop me off, then?",
        "Driver: Oh, that's fine with me.",
        "Carly: It's fine with me, too. Just don't expect a tip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Parker! Parker, will you wait up? Why did you run out of the wedding?",
        "Parker: Because there's not gonna be a wedding, Liberty!",
        "Liberty: Parker, she'll be here! She's just -- she's running late.",

        "Parker: I don't think so.",
        "Liberty: Well, where do you think she is?",
        "Parker: What does it matter?",
        "Liberty: Why are you being so hard on her?",
        "Parker: Because she's a drunk!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What makes you think she's drinking?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on!",
        "Craig: She could be stuck in traffic for all we know!",
        "Rosanna: She wasn't driving, okay? Thank God.",
        "Craig: Why do you always think the worst of her?",
        "Rosanna: Why do you think that she's stuck in traffic? She's drunk somewhere.",
        "Craig: She hasn't had a drink in weeks.",
        "Rosanna: She drinks every day, Craig! Come on! I told you about all those bottles that I found --",
        "Craig: That's not true!",
        "Rosanna: So you're calling me a liar?",
        "Craig: I'm saying that you don't know the truth, and neither do I.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, the truth is right in front of your face. And until you let yourself see it, you're just making things worse for everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why don't you go on up and watch that new video you got?",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Jack: We'll let you know as soon as we hear from your mom.",
        "Sage: It's definitely too late to have the wedding, right?",
        "Jack: Probably.",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Janet: Well, somebody's happy this wedding didn't happen.",
        "Jack: She's just so young, she doesn't realize what a nightmare this really is.",
        "Janet: What do you think happened to her?",
        "Jack: I think she finally realized how insane it would be to marry Craig, or she's so drunk she figured out she was going to.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Hey, Craig.",
        "Craig: Have you heard from her?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Craig: Neither have we. We'd better find her before something happens to her.",

        "[Pot shatters]",
        "Holden: What the hell? Carly!",
        "Carly: Hi. I'm sorry about your plant here. Kind of jumped out at me.",
        "Holden: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: I didn't know where else to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Excuse me. Have you seen a blond woman wearing a wedding dress? Perhaps a little drunk?",
        "Bartender: Not today.",
        "Craig: Are you sure?",
        "Bartender: I think I'd remember that.",
        "Craig: I guess you would. I'm starting to relate to Carly. I could use a drink myself.",
        "Rosanna: That's not gonna help anything.",
        "Craig: Gee, you think?",
        "Rosanna: Look, I understand that you're upset. I'm a little worried myself.",
        "Craig: You don't know the half of it. I really wanted this! I wanted Carly to be my wife. I wanted a mother for my son.",
        "Rosanna: Well, all she wants right now is another drink.",
        "Craig: You're right. You're absolutely right. I should have seen this coming. The signs were everywhere. But I convinced myself that she could handle it. You know, when she almost hit me with the car, she swore to me that she'd stop.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, drunks lie.",
        "Craig: The worst lie was when she told me that she didn't need any help, that she could do it without a program. And I bought it. How stupid was I?",
        "Rosanna: You know, people in love -- they trust each other. That's not a bad thing.",
        "Craig: I guess I just pretended that if everything was okay, it would be.",
        "Rosanna: Well, clearly things don't work like that, do they?",
        "Craig: You mean you can't just imagine everything is perfect and it is? What a fool.",
        "Rosanna: You know, uh, are you gonna stay here and feel sorry for yourself, or are we gonna find Carly?",
        "Craig: Let's go find Carly.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is Lily home?",
        "Holden: No. No, she's, uh -- she's at the office.",
        "Carly: Can I come in?",
        "Holden: Aren't you supposed to be getting married?",
        "Carly: Uh, it's complicated.",
        "Holden: I'll bet.",
        "Carly: I really need to sit down.",
        "Holden: Okay. Come on in.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Holden: You're, uh -- you're in pretty deep trouble, aren't you?",
        "Carly: Well -- it sort of depends on what you mean by \"Trouble.\"",
        "Holden: You bailed on your wedding, didn't you?",
        "Carly: I couldn't take it -- the looks and the constant demands and -- and the judging. I just couldn't take it anymore.",
        "Holden: Who are we talking about here?",
        "Carly: All of them -- Craig, Jack, Rosanna, Parker.",
        "Holden: Parker? Parker was judging you?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Can you believe that.",
        "Holden: So you just didn't go?",
        "Carly: They ruined it for me.",
        "Holden: What did Craig say?",
        "Carly: I haven't told him.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, maybe you should.",
        "Carly: I know!",
        "Holden: So, what are you doing here?",
        "Carly: I was hoping Lily could lend me some clothes. I -- I want to go home. I can't go home, 'cause I'm sure they're there, and I can't face them. I can't face them yet.",
        "Holden: Well, sooner or later, you're gonna have to.",
        "Carly: Well, I choose later. Please, I really need somebody to give me a break.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll, uh -- I'll see what I can do.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Luke: Hey! I need help.",
        "Lily: I don't do heavy lifting.",
        "Luke: Oh, well, you know what? Luckily, we have movers for that. But they have to be paid, and I don't have enough money in my account.",
        "Damian: That's all?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Damian: How much do you need?",
        "Luke: $500.",
        "Damian: I think I'm gonna have to hit an ATM.",
        "Lily: It's okay. I just went to the bank.",
        "Luke: Thank you so much.",
        "Damian: Do you need any help with the move?",
        "Luke: Uh, no. Actually, we, uh, hired these four movers. They're all built like iron man.",
        "Damian: Well, you call if you need anything, okay?",
        "Luke: I will. And -- and we are going to have you over for dinner as soon as we get settled. Noah really wants to thank you for helping out with his father.",
        "Damian: Well, that's not necessary, but I'd be delighted.",
        "Luke: Yeah, we just have to get pots and pans -- and dishes -- and learn how to cook. But then I promise. And, Mom, thank you so much. Mwah!",
        "Lily: You're welcome.",
        "Luke: You're the best.",
        "Lily: Love you.",
        "Luke: You too.",
        "Lily: It's so great to see him happy like this.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, love will do that to a man.",
        "Lily: You really are accepting this, aren't you?",
        "Damian: Well, it's not what I pictured, and I can't say I fully understand it, but getting to know Noah has made all the difference.",
        "Lily: He's amazing.",
        "Damian: Well, it's a gift to find someone you truly love who loves you back just as much. Well, how can a father object to that?",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Damian, I have to say, I never thought I'd hear you say that.",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "Damian: The world is changing fast. The challenge is to keep changing with it.",
        "Lily: If you tell Holden I said this, I'll swear you're lying. But I'm glad you're back in Luke's life.",
        "Damian: So am I.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm sure there's something in here.",
        "Carly: Oh, thank you. Great.",
        "Holden: Why don't you, uh, put something on, and I'll -- I'll give Lily a call?",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Oh, don't call her. You know, you -- you don't know who she's with, you know?",
        "Holden: You know, you can't hide forever. You really should tell Craig why you're dumping him.",
        "Carly: I am not dumping him.",
        "Holden: You were supposed to marry him. You didn't.",
        "Carly: Not today.",
        "Holden: So you're gonna marry him some other day?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I -- everything is happening so fast, I couldn't catch up.",
        "Holden: I think you should be telling him this.",
        "Carly: I know! I will.",
        "Holden: All right. So, uh -- so what are you gonna do now?",
        "Carly: Would you give me a ride?",
        "Holden: Where?",
        "Carly: I guess I'll know when I get there.",
        "Holden: All right. Let me get my keys.",
        "[Carly picks up a bottle of liquor and puts it in her bag]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey. Now it is out, Parker, and she can get help.",
        "Parker: If she wants it. She keeps on telling everybody that she doesn't need help. And honestly, at this point, I don't know who can get through to her. Liberty, I'm scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What about Carly?",
        "Jack: No sign of her.",
        "Janet: It's a really small town, Jack.",
        "Jack: With plenty of places to hide, though, Janet.",
        "Janet: Come on, Jack. You know her better than anyone. Where would she go if she was desperate?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I think -- she could go anywhere.",
        "Janet: Even here?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Janet: Jack, she always turns to you when she is in trouble. She could be outside right now waiting for me to leave so that you can talk to her alone.",
        "Jack: Janet, I really don't think so. Not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Carly: Disinfectant and cigarette smoke. Brings back memories.",
        "Holden: Carly, you can't stay here.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, now. I'll lock the door.",
        "Holden: No, I -- I'm sure that your family is looking for you. They're probably worried about you.",
        "Carly: I doubt that.",
        "Holden: Your kids are probably scared out of their minds.",
        "Carly: My kids don't care.",
        "Holden: That's not true, and you know that.",
        "Carly: Sage is thrilled that I didn't show up. And Parker probably didn't even notice.",
        "Holden: Okay, why don't you at least call Rosanna and let her know that you're all right.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, please. And you don't call anybody either, okay? I need some time to think.",
        "Holden: A drink? I think you've had too much already.",
        "Carly: No such thing as too much. Not tonight.",
        "Holden: Okay. Well, good luck.",
        "Carly: Hey. Would you stay? Would you keep me company? Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Noah. Where are you?",
        "Bo: You're moving out?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Yeah, finally.",
        "Bo: I hear you, Dude. It looks like that top flap is still open.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "Bo: All right, well, good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You know, I do worry the boys might be a bit too young for a big step like this.",
        "Lily: They are too young. But you can't decide in advance when you're gonna meet the love of your life.",
        "Damian: No, you can't.",
        "Lily: Noah is a rock. He'll anchor them both.",
        "Damian: They've been through a lot.",
        "Lily: Yeah. I think that's why he's so steady. I mean, he had to in order to survive.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: That's me. Hello.",
        "Luke: It's me.",
        "Lily: What's wrong, Sweetie?",
        "Luke: I can't find Noah. I've called. I've texted. Nothing.",
        "Lily: Did you check the dorm?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm there right now. I ran into this friend of his that said that he was here moving boxes, but -- but now there's no sign of him.",
        "Damian: What is it?",
        "Lily: He can't find Noah. Sweetie, uh, Damian's here. I'm gonna put you on speaker.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Damian: What happened?",
        "Luke: He just took off. Most of his stuff is still in his dorm room, and he has a box of his father's stuff out in the hall.",
        "Damian: Are you still at the dorm?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Damian: I'll be right over.",
        "Luke: I have to look for him.",
        "Damian: We'll do it together. Just wait for me. I think I might know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Maybe if I had told my dad sooner that my mom was still drinking, she'd be okay right now.",
        "Liberty: Parker, you were protecting her.",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Liberty: And that's understandable.",
        "Parker: No, I wasn't protecting her! I was protecting myself!",
        "Liberty: No, you were not.",
        "Parker: No. Liberty, we made a deal. I would not rat her out if she didn't rat me out. That's nice, huh? Just saving my own butt and letting my mom risk her life.",
        "Liberty: Parker, really, do not be so hard on yourself. Please.",
        "Parker: She could be dead in a ditch somewhere for all that I know, and it's my fault!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right. I would like a call as soon as she's spotted, though. Thanks.",
        "Janet: Still nothing?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Janet: Hey. Thought you were watching that video.",
        "Sage: It's over.",
        "Janet: Do you want something to eat?",
        "Sage: No, thanks. Did Mom call?",
        "Jack: No, not yet, Honey.",
        "Sage: I knew she didn't want to marry him.",
        "Jack: Did she tell you that?",
        "Sage: No. But isn't it obvious?",
        "Jack: Well, I really doubt that she'd go through the trouble of planning a wedding if she didn't want to get married.",
        "Sage: Maybe she thought she did, but I knew she wouldn't.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Sage: Because I know she still loves you.",
        "Jack: Sage --",

        "Sage: Is she ever gonna get better?",
        "Jack: Well, she has to want to. And she's got to go through a program to help her cope with learning how not to drink.",
        "Sage: And then she'll be okay?",
        "Jack: Oh, Honey, listen, alcoholism is a disease, and it never -- it never really goes away. So she's gonna need a lot of support. But she's got you kids, and she's got Rosanna, and she's got Craig, and you guys all will help her stay sober.",

        "Craig: Let me ask you something. Do you think Carly was with me because I didn't push her about her drinking?",

        "Rosanna: Well, you want Carly, right? So you see her drinking as a way in, her weakness as your opportunity. That's what it's about. Having Carly be dependent on you sets up a situation where you are always in control.",
