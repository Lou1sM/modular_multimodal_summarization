        "\r\nLily: Yes, of course.\u00a0 I'm sorry.\u00a0 I'm sorry if I'm a little scattered, but I do\r\n\r\nknow this castle is near a church with a gold dome, and there are cypress trees\r\n\r\n-- five cypress trees in a row, low windows.\u00a0 And this castle has a dungeon, or\r\n\r\n\u2013 \r\nSignora Cordina: The dome could be the San Gennaro.\u00a0 The legend has it\r\n\r\nthat the count who once owned the castle nearby, he planted the trees to keep\r\n\r\nthe priests from knowing what was going on behind his walls.",
        "\r\nLily: Then you know it?",
