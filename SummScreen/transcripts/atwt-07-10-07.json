        "Luke: Everything set?",
        "Noah: Yeah, they're getting ready for Gwen's number. I cannot believe that with everything that's been going on, I'm still supposed to tape all of this for WOAK. Weren't you going to go down and watch it with Will and Maddie?",
        "Luke: Oh, I thought I'd see if you needed any help, you know, with the videos and stuff.",
        "Noah: No, all good on my end. But thanks. Hey, we should probably get down there before Gwen gets on stage.",
        "Luke: These the right seats?",
        "Noah: I roped them off myself.",
        "Luke: Where's Will? He wouldn't miss hearing Gwen sing.",
        "Noah: Yeah, neither would Maddie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: That's your cue, Gwen. Let's get you on stage. What's wrong?",
        "Cleo: Laryngitis.",
        "Gabe: You sounded fine a second ago.",
        "Cleo: It comes and goes.",
        "Gabe: Andy already announced you on stage. What are we going to do?",
        "Cleo: Lip sync?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What if Cleo gets to Gwen before we do? Ow!",
        "Will: What happened?",
        "Maddie: My ankle. Ooh --",
        "Will: Can you stand on it?",
        "Maddie: Oh, no, it really hurts.",
        "Will: Let me see it. Maddie, can you move it?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but not enough to run on it. You need to go get Gwen. You should go.",
        "Will: No, I'm not going to leave you here.",
        "Maddie: No, I'm going to be fine.",
        "Will: Maddie, without a car? Cleo's coming back. You know that. When she finds you here instead of me she's -- damn it, I still don't have a signal.",
        "Maddie: Maybe Gwen will be okay. Maybe Cleo won't go after her.",
        "Will: Are you kidding! Cleo's nuts! She hit me over the head. She's going to do anything!",
        "Maddie: Okay, okay, I'm going to try and walk, but if I can't you need to get to the car and go!",
        "Will: Okay. It's going to be okay. Gwen can take care of herself. She can handle anything Cleo throws at her.",

        "[Train whistling]",
        "Gwen: It's getting closer!",
        "Jade: Stop moving around! Every time you struggle it just gets tighter!",
        "Gwen: I can't just lay here! If we don't get off these tracks, we're going to die!",
        "Jade: I can't get loose with you struggling like that!",
        "Gwen: Hold still, I almost had it!",
        "Jade: Why? So you can just get out and leave me here to get squashed like a bug? I don't think so.",
        "Gwen: Did you hear that? It sounded like it was further away?",
        "Jade: That's not as loud as before.",
        "Gwen: And the tracks, they're not vibrating as much. It's going in the other direction.",
        "Jade: I thought we were so dead.",
        "Gwen: How do we know there isn't a train coming up behind it that's coming this way?",
        "Jade: God, can I just be relieved for like two seconds? When did you become miss doom and gloom?",
        "Gwen: Ever since I found out that you brought some girl to town to look like me, who wants me dead so she can have my husband!",
        "Jade: You know what? I've got my own problems to deal with, with Cleo, okay? I am tied here to the train tacks just like you! Why is it that all of your problems always have to be bigger than everybody else's? Would you just stop? This isn't working!",
        "Gwen: So we go back to the original plan.",
        "Jade: We'll just work on getting one of us free.",
        "Gwen: Me.",
        "Jade: Me. Why you?",
        "Gwen: Why? Because once I'm free, I'll stay around to make sure you're untied. Who knows what you'll do?",
        "Jade: You really think I would leave you here?",
        "Gwen: Well, you hate me.",
        "Jade: Not enough to leave you to get squashed into a hamburger. We used to be friends.",
        "Gwen: Okay, stop. All right since you have one knot left, we work on that. That's the plan.",
        "Jade: You trust me?",
        "Gwen: I love my husband. And getting out of here, making sure that Will's okay is more important to me than fighting with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Would somebody please tell me what's going on?",
        "Dusty: We should be on our way to Bermuda. That's what's going on.",
        "Emily: You expect me to leave in the middle of all this?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, because it's none of our business. Let's go.",
        "Alison: He's right, Em.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine, I'll butt out. I'll put my flowers in water, and go pack.",
        "Alison: I'll take care of your flowers.",
        "Emily: You really want to get rid of me, don't you?",
        "Alison: I want you to not worry, and I want you to go have a good time. I love you.",
        "Emily: I love you too. What's that? Looks just like the cover of the movie you made with lance.",
        "Aaron: You can say it. We all know Ali did porn.",
        "Emily: Is this what you two were fighting about? What the hell's going on?",

        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Lily: Hi! You just missed a very noisy family dinner.",
        "Holden: Oh, yeah? Things ran late at the vet. Everyone upstairs?",
        "Lily: No, your mom took everyone to the movies, trying not to worry about Meg.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I keep thinking about that. Thinking that I shouldn't have left her alone up there with Craig.",
        "Lily: I can understand why she wanted to stay.",
        "Holden: Can you explain it to me?",
        "Lily: Because she doesn't want to believe that Paul is dead. She loves him. She didn't want to leave that place without him. What if that happened to you? Can you understand why she feels that way?",
        "Lily: Lately I feel like I do.",
        "Holden: Lily, come on, I love you. You know that. How'd your day go today? Your meeting?",
        "Lily: Oh, it didn't happen. It was canceled.",
        "Holden: Canceled? Why?",
        "Lily: I had to post bail, for Jade.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: She was accused of running Will Munson off the road. She didn't do it. She thinks she knows who did.",
        "Holden: Why did she wait until this morning to call?",
        "Lily: She didn't ask me to do it. Luke asked me. She was embarrassed.",
        "Holden: I thought she didn't do it?",
        "Lily: The money that I gave her for college, she didn't use it for college. She was afraid to face me.",
        "Holden: So did you post bail?",
        "Lily: She's my niece.",
        "Holden: Where is she now?",
        "Lily: I'm not sure. I haven't been able to reach her since this morning. Her or Luke.",

        "Luke: She seems a little off.",
        "Noah: She's probably worried about Will.",
        "Luke: I'll go and find Jade. Maybe she knows what's going on with Will.",

        "Jade: You almost got it.",
        "Gwen: Move your arms, up just a little bit.",

        "Jade: Maybe it'll change direction.",
        "Gwen: And maybe it won't. Please, please hurry up.",
        "Jade: I'm trying!",
        "Gwen: Get my hands -- your hands are still bleeding.",
        "Jade: These ones are super tight. I can't loosen them.",
        "Gwen: See if you can find a sharp rock.",
        "Jade: When I brought Cleo to Oakdale, I never thought this was going to end up like this.",
        "Gwen: It's going to be fine! Just get me loose, okay? Please hurry!",
        "Jade: This is crazy, I can not find a rock that's sharp enough! Oh my God, just hold on. Okay, Gwen, just hold on. I'll be back!",
        "Gwen: Jade! No, Jade, where are you going? Don't leave me here! Please!",

        "Maddie: Isn't that Gwen?",
        "Will: Yeah. It is. Thank God.",
        "Luke: Will! We've been looking all over for you. Hey, what happened?",
        "Will: We need to call the police right now so they can track down Cleo.",
        "Luke: Okay, I'll get Noah.",
        "Will: Okay. Maddie, you okay?",
        "Noah: What happened?",
        "Maddie: I think I sprained my ankle.",
        "Luke: Will says that we need to call the police.",
        "Noah: Cleo?",
        "Will: Yeah, she knocked me out. She tied me up and she left me there.",
        "Luke: Was she trying to kill you?",
        "Will: No, I think she was trying to get me out of commission so she could hurt Gwen. How's Gwen doing?",
        "Luke: She seems a little distracted.",
        "Maddie: She's probably worried about you. Get in there so you can see her.",
        "Luke: Why is Gwen lip synching? Gwen. It's Cleo!",
        "Will: Go that way! Go around the back. Check Gwen's room and call the police!",
        "Will: Cleo! Cleo, stop! Cleo, where's Gwen?",
        "Cleo: Don't be mad at me, Will. I didn't mean to hurt you --",
        "Will: Cleo! What the hell did you do to my wife?",
        "Cleo: Ow!",
        "Will: Cleo, where's Gwen?",
        "Cleo: I don't know!",
        "Will: Tell me where she is!",
        "Cleo: I don't know! She wasn't here when I got here! She's probably out looking for you. And I didn't want her to miss her big chance of being a star, so I never --",
        "Will: Cleo, stop lying to me! Tell me what you did to my wife?",
        "Cleo: Do you think that I hurt her the way I hurt you? I swear -- I still can't believe I did that. I didn't mean to do it --",
        "Will: Well, it felt like you meant it.",
        "Cleo: I just lost it for one little second. Want to know why? Because when I told you how much I love you, and you said that you could never, ever, ever love me back -- you broke my heart. And I know you think I'm a horrible person --",
        "Will: Cleo, shut up! Just stop it! I don't think that you're a bad person. You're not horrible.",
        "Cleo: You don't?",
        "Will: No, I'm just really worried about Gwen right now. Okay? Can you tell me why you're pretending to be her?",
        "Cleo: Because, because I had to. Because I knew that you were going to free yourself. And that you were going to go to the police. And I had to be her in order to escape.",
        "Will: That would only work if Gwen weren't around. And if you knew for sure that she wasn't coming back. Right? So, where is she? Cleo, do you remember what you said to me? About how kind I was to you?",
        "Cleo: Because you felt sorry for me? I don't want you to feel sorry for me, Will.",
        "Will: Cleo, what else did you say to me?",
        "Cleo: I said that I love you. And I do.",
        "Will: All right. So, then tell me where Gwen is.",
        "Cleo: I don't know!",
        "Will: Cleo, you're lying to me. Can you do something for me?",
        "Cleo: I could try.",
        "Will: Can you feel how Gwen would feel right now. She wouldn't hurt me like this. She wouldn't keep me from the one person I can't live without. Would she?",
        "Cleo: You don't have to live without her. I could be just like her.",
        "Will: Okay, then be just like her. Think about what I need more than what you want. Can you do that? Can you love me that much? Tell me where Gwen is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What -- what was that? What was that?",
        "Alison: Lance was here. He brought it.",
        "Emily: Lance -- Lance made that? What is this, some kind of joke?",
        "Dusty: Nope.",
        "Emily: Oh my God --",
        "Alison: Emily --",
        "Emily: Oh my God -- when? When?",
        "Dusty: Vegas.",
        "Emily: What? When you were out there? When you were out there to bring her home? That's when you changed. That's when you changed with me. I don't understand.",
        "Dusty: Let's go somewhere. Let's go somewhere and talk --",
        "Emily: I don't understand.",
        "Alison: Emily --",
        "Emily: Don't touch me! Don't touch me!",
        "Aaron: That's what you should have said to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Yes, her name is Cleo Babbitt, and she's already attacked one person, Will Munson, and I think possibly his wife. Okay, we are at the Moon River Theatre. Please hurry. Hey, did they catch Cleo?",
        "Noah: I'm not sure. I didn't see anybody outside. I just came back to check with you. Did you get through to the police?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I talked to that friend of your dad's, the sergeant, he's sending two people over.",
        "Noah: Good. How are you doing?",
        "Maddie: I'm mad at myself. Why did I let Gwen go out alone looking for Will?",
        "Noah: You went off alone.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but Cleo wasn't after me. I mean, what if she did something horrible to Gwen?",
        "Noah: Maddie, there's no way you could've known any of this would happen. And maybe Gwen's okay.",
        "Maddie: I don't know. You little freak! What did you do to Gwen?",
        "Cleo: Nothing! She's fine. Just like I told Will.",
        "Luke: Have you called the police yet?",
        "Noah: They're on their way. Where's Will?",
        "Luke: He went to look for Gwen. Have either of you seen Jade?",
        "Maddie: What are you hiding?",
        "Cleo: Nothing.",
        "Maddie: You know where Jade is, don't you?",
        "Luke: Answer the question. Where's Jade?",
        "Cleo: With Gwen.",
        "Maddie: Where is that? Do you know?",
        "Luke: No, I didn't hear what she said to Will. He just told me to hold on to Cleo and ran off.",
        "Noah: Where are they, Cleo? Where are Jade and Gwen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Why did you take off on me like that?",
        "Jade: I went to see if I could find the train and signal it to stop!",
        "Gwen: Did you see it?",
        "Jade: This is the sharpest rock I could find. Why isn't it working?",
        "Gwen: It's close, isn't it? Come on, tell me the truth.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no, no!",
        "Jade: No, no, no! Don't freak out! Don't freak out! We're going to get you out!",
        "Gwen: It's not working!",
        "Jade: Do you hear that?",
        "Gwen: Yes, I heard the train?",
        "Jade: Listen! Listen!",

        "Noah: It's really swollen.",
        "Luke: I can get some ice.",
        "Noah: There's a kitchen a couple doors down on the left.",
        "Luke: I'll find it.",
        "Maddie: What is taking the police so long?",
        "Noah: When we called them before about the railroad tracks, they probably went there first.",
        "Maddie: If Gwen and Jade are even there. She probably sent Will on a wild goose chase and he can't find Gwen.",
        "Cleo: I would never lie to Will.",
        "Maddie: Look at yourself. You just lied to all of us.",
        "Cleo: I bet he could have gotten lost. I mean, the place is pretty big. I'll make sure that he finds her. I know exactly where Gwen is --",

        "Dusty: Where'd the DVD come from?",
        "Aaron: Shouldn't you be checking on your girlfriend? Explaining to her why you slept with her sister?",
        "Alison: Stop it! We don't have time for this. You need to go find Emily.",
        "Dusty: Tell me about this DVD.",
        "Alison: Lance was here, he was pushing me to go back to work for him again. And Aaron pounded him pretty hard and I guess it ticked him off. Because he snuck back in and out the DVD in --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, but where'd it come from? Who made it?",
        "Alison: I don't know. There must have been a hidden camera.",
        "Dusty: Where's Lance right now?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Aaron kicked him out.",

        "Aaron: Whose is it? Yours?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, mine. I slept with her. I shouldn't have.",
        "Alison: We both were barely conscious at that point. It was like a reflex or something.",
        "Aaron: Well, if you're so okay with it, then why the secret?",
        "Dusty: Because she wanted to tell Emily. And I asked her not to.",
        "Alison: You just go find her. Make her understand.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, good luck with that.",
        "Dusty: You know earlier today, you told me how happy you were to be back with Alison.",
        "Aaron: I didn't lie.",
        "Dusty: Neither did she. She made a promise to me. You got it? And she kept it.",

        "Lily: Holden --",
        "Holden: Lily, our niece was arrested. I think that classifies as big news, at least worthy of a phone call.",
        "Lily: I didn't want to tell you. I wanted Luke and Jade to tell you themselves. What could I have done that I didn't do?",
        "Holden: I guess we'll never know now, will we? Jade's probably halfway to Canada by now.",
        "Lily: No, she -- no, she wouldn't run. She wouldn't do that to me.",

        "Holden: We're already in it. Just answer the question --",
        "Lily: I'm just tired of making mistakes. I'm tired of having you disappointed in me. You didn't see how frightened Jade was this morning. She was so convinced that I wouldn't believe her and I know how she feels.",
        "Holden: I believe you when you tell me things.",
        "Lily: You say that you forgive me for lying to you, but you don't.",
        "Holden: I have.",
        "Lily: You haven't touched me from the second you walked in this door. Not -- not once.",
        "Holden: I'm trying, okay? I'm trying.",
        "Lily: It's still early. Why don't we go for a ride together? Just spend the time together, just the two of us.",
        "Holden: All right, all right, that sounds good. Let's do it tomorrow, okay? I want to go see Aaron and see if he's heard from Luke.",
        "Lily: Why don't you just call Aaron?",
        "Holden: Because I want to go talk to him, see how everything's going with his job.",

        "Andy Williams: Thank you everybody for your generous contributions. That's our show for tonight. [Applause] Excuse me. Excuse me, I think I'm being paged.",
        "Gwen: Thank you so much for making this happen.",
        "Gabe: It was my pleasure. It would've been a shame for you to come all the way out here and not get the chance to sing.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Hey. It seems like ever since I met you, you've been saving my life in one way or another.",
        "Will: I'm just returning the favor.",
        "Gwen: I love you.",
        "Will: I love you, too. Get out there. They're waiting for you.",

        "Alison: You don't have to stay.",
        "Aaron: What if Lance comes back?",
        "Alison: Why would he? He did what he came to do. He's probably halfway back to Vegas by now.",
        "Aaron: And what if he's not?",
        "Alison: I'll take care of it myself. I want you to go, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: You don't want to talk?",
        "Alison: About what? How mad I am at you?",
        "Aaron: Where do you -- where do you get off being mad at me?",
        "Alison: I can understand you feeling betrayed and angry at me and wanting to get back at me. But -- and I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Dusty in Vegas.",
        "Aaron: But you're mad at me.",
        "Alison: Because of what you did to Emily. Did you see how hurt she was?",
        "Aaron: I didn't hurt Emily. You and Dusty were the ones who slept together --",
        "Alison: You didn't care, Aaron. Emily was happy. Finally happy. But you didn't care. And you stayed in this room, and you made your snide comments, and you made sure that she found out.",
        "Aaron: Well, she had a right to know.",
        "Alison: What Dusty and I did was wrong. But what you did was cruel.",
        "Aaron: Was I supposed to lie? Look, I didn't want to hurt Emily, either. I just reacted in the moment. Kind of like you and Dusty in Vegas.",
        "Alison: Wow. There's that look again. The same look you gave me the night you called me a whore in Seattle.",
        "Aaron: I don't think you're a whore. You really messed me up, Ali. I don't want anybody but you. And just when I start to think that you might actually want me to --",
        "Alison: I do.",
        "Aaron: You know what I saw in that video? You were hurting, and you turned to somebody who wasn't me.",
        "Alison: No, we had broken up.",
        "Aaron: You slept with somebody who wasn't me!",
        "Alison: I thought you didn't want me!",
        "Aaron: Ali, you know, before I could pretend that it was different with these other guys. That it was less. But Dusty -- with Dusty, I saw it. I saw it.",
        "Alison: What you saw -- I wasn't thinking of Dusty. I was thinking of you. Not thinking really, dreaming. I thought I was in Seattle and I was cold and lost. And then I turned, and in that moment, he was you.",
        "Aaron: And then? I know what I saw, Alison. And so does Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Emily -- what are you thinking?",
        "Emily: That's a good strategy. That's really good. Don't -- don't come right out with your explanation. Better to figure out what I'm thinking, so you can figure out how much you need to grovel.",
        "Dusty: Would groveling work for you?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Dusty: What about an apology?",
        "Emily: For what? Oh, for sleeping with my sister?",
        "Dusty: You asked me what happened in Vegas. I should have told you everything.",
        "Emily: Why? You don't owe me anything. We weren't dating.",
        "Dusty: I should have told you.",
        "Emily: I want to go to Bermuda.",
        "Dusty: Well, let's go. We can go right now. We don't need anything. We can even buy whatever we --",
        "Emily: We'll walk on the beach?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Make love in the moonlight?",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Emily: And when I wake up, sleeping next to you, disgusted with myself for caring about you more than you can ever care about me --",
        "Dusty: I care about you. I care about you a lot.",
        "Emily: I wanted you to respect me, Dusty. And I thought if you could past the prostitution, if you get past --",
        "Dusty: I am. I am. And I have been.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I noticed. By sleeping with my sister, the porn star.",
        "Dusty: You're coming down on Alison?",
        "Emily: No, Dusty, I'm coming down on you. Because you're the hypocrite. You were disgusted with me because I slept with -- I slept with men for money. But now, this sleeping with my sister, the porn star, is no big deal for you?",
        "Dusty: What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Tell me how to fix this.",
        "Emily: Were you going to tell me? Were you going to tell me you slept with Ali?",
        "Dusty: No. I've only loved two people in this world, my wife and my son. And they disappeared. I slept with your sister because I was lonely and she was there.",
        "Emily: If I had been there?",
        "Dusty: Then I would have been making love to you. Nothing changes the way I feel about you, this certainly doesn't.",
        "Emily: Really? Because it changes everything for me.",
        "Dusty: I don't want those.",
        "Emily: Take the tickets. I'm not going to Bermuda with you.",
        "Dusty: Will you still work with me?",
        "Emily: Just take them.",
        "Dusty: Are you my friend --or not? Because I need you.",
        "Emily: Don't say that.",
        "Dusty: Why not? I need you. I need you to help me fix this, come on.",
        "Emily: By going away with you?",
        "Dusty: By forgiving me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I asked you tell me everything. If you had been completely honest with me --",
        "Alison: We'd be okay now? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Aaron: If you had trusted me like I said, yes. I would've understood.",
        "Alison: So, if I had told you that Dusty and I had slept together in Vegas, you'd be totally cool with that?",
        "Aaron: I would have dealt with it.",
        "Alison: Well, now you know. So deal with it.",
        "Aaron: Now it's too late.",
        "Alison: Oh, isn't that convenient? Because you now know about Dusty, instead of how you felt four ago, you get to be superior and I get to be the unforgivable slut.",
        "Aaron: All I'm asking for is a little honesty. I took you back after I found out that you were making porn. I mean, what else can I do?",
        "Alison: I want you to go, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Alison --",
        "Alison: When you came back to Oakdale, I told you it was too late for us. The kids we were? They don't exist anymore.",

        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Andy Williams: How about that? Isn't she great? [Cheers and applause] That's good. How would you like to sing a duet with me just to close out the show?",
        "Gwen: I would be honored.",
        "Andy Williams: Well, good.",
