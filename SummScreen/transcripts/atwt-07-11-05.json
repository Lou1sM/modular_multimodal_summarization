        "Craig still is dwelling on the judgment about having to stay away from his unborn child. Rosanna misinterprets it as him having second thoughts about adopting. He assures her he is not, but is having trouble forgetting about his other child. When Rosanna informs Carly of their plans to adopt, Carly voices her concerns, but finally agrees to support her. Rosanna asks Carly and Jack to be her child's guardian. Carly joyfully agrees, as she has another terrible audio memory. Paul and Emily are getting buzzed. Paul is really hyper and Emily questions whether he is overcompensating for the fact Rosanna and Craig are adopting. He admits to it angering him, but he doesn't want to think about it. He wants to go on vacation to a tropical place with Emily. Emily agrees to go with him. When Emily loses her wrap, Paul goes to find it, and comes face to face with Rosanna. Gwen tries to ignore the pain she is in, but cannot in the end, when the contractions become severe. Will calls an ambulance, and they go to the hospital. Bob tells Will he is worried about low birth rate considering how poorly Gwen took care of herself. The doctors administer medication to slow the contractions, to no avail. Lucinda wants to forget about her health problems, and winds up drinking and playing pool with Meg at Yos'. Lucinda hires Meg as her nurse, but questions if Meg wants to stay in town because of Dusty. Sierra and Lily worry about Lucinda when she comes home with Meg telling them she has decided to have a lumpectomy and has hired Meg as her full time nurse. Jen goes into labor after she falls. There is no signal on her cell phone, but then Dusty arrives, and he helps her through the delivery. When Jen asks about how her baby is, Dusty tells her he has ten fingers and ten toes, so he must be healthy, but in fact, he looks very worried."

        "Emily: Whoo! Okay. I quit, quit.",
        "[In Russian accent]",
        "Paul: No, no. No, this is no good, this quitting. You must dance.",
        "Emily: Boris, I'm so sorry. No can tango.",
        "Paul: Party poopski!",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Come on. Let's sit and talk.",
        "Paul: Now, this is a first. You'd really rather talk than tango?",
        "Emily: Oh. It's been a long day. A lot has happened.",
        "Paul: Nothing a few drinks at Yo's won't fix. C'mon, I'll race you to drunk.",
        "Emily: Paul, Paul. Please, can we talk about it? You know, Craig and Rosanna adopted a baby.",
        "Paul: Yeah. That's what I heard.",
        "Emily: And it's gotta bother you.",
        "Paul: Only if I stop to think about it. Hey, want to see me not think about anything?",
        "Emily: Listen to me. Hey! We can't tango forever, okay?",
        "Paul: Sure we can. C'mon. Come here. Boris must have a vodka!",

        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Judge Kwan: I hereby grant the plaintiff's request for a restraining order preventing any contact or communication with Mrs. Kasnoff or her offspring with the following amendment -- that this restraining order be in effect for a period of not less than five years from this date.",
        "[Gavel pounds]",
        "Rosanna: Craig?",
        "Craig: Huh? Oh, I didn't hear you come in. What's all this?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I thought that we should establish a trust fund for the baby, in a way to reassure Gwen. Not that money is all that matters, but this way she'll have some sort of proof that we're serious.",
        "Craig: That's fine. Fine.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. So what I was wondering was -- should we wait until its 25? Should we give it the money all at once? What provisions have you made for Lucy?",
        "Craig: For Lucy?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Are you gonna give her the money all at once, or are you gonna do it in stages?",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: I want to know what you think. How we should set things up for our baby. We're having a baby, Craig. I thought that's what you wanted.",
        "Craig: I do.",
        "Rosanna: Are you having second thoughts? You are, aren't you?",

        "[Gwen groans]",
        "Will: Should I call the hospital?",
        "Gwen: No, no, that's the last thing I need, to be carried off the roof on a gurney.",
        "Will: Well, Gwen, if you can't walk --",
        "Gwen: Look, I don't know if it's labor. Maybe I pulled a muscle. Maybe it's the week-old burrito I had for breakfast.",
        "Will: Gwen, if you're in this much pain, I really think we should get it checked out. Are you having another contraction? What is it?",
        "Gwen: Uh-uh. I'm scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Mother, is that you?",
        "Lily: Oh, just me.",
        "Sierra: I thought you had a date.",
        "Lily: Last-minute schedule change. Keith had to fly. Where is Mother?",
        "Sierra: You know, I don't know. I've called her office. I've called the massage therapist --",
        "Lily: It's late. Where could Mother be?",
        "Sierra: I have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Bartender! Bourbon!",
        "Meg: As your nurse, I think I should point out --",
        "Lucinda: Bourbon -- it's not on the regimen?",
        "Meg: No, once you have your surgery and start treatment --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, then I better party while I can. Bartender, make it a double!",
        "Dusty: Hey, Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah?",
        "Dusty: Do you know where Barbara Ryan's cabin is?",
        "Lucinda: Milltown Road. It's on the other side of the lake. What'd you want to go there for?",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you later.",
        "Dusty: Damn it, Jen, pick up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jennifer breathing heavily]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, so far, so good. [ Jennifer gasping ] No. No. Oh, it's too soon. Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I'm okay.",
        "Will: Well, I still think we should call the hospital.",
        "Gwen: I'm not going to the hospital. I hate those people. They're so nosy.",
        "Will: Nosy?",
        "Gwen: My mom used to work there.",
        "Will: Yeah, Alison said something about how she --",
        "Gwen: Show up on a gurney, it's too pathetic. \"Oh, look what happened to poor, stupid Gwen. First she gets kicked out of the house. Now she's pregnant.\"",
        "Will: Okay, well it doesn't have to be like that. We can call my Uncle Bob, and he'll meet us at the door. He'll walk us through. It won't be a problem.",
        "Gwen: How about we just go to the movies? Will, lighten up.",
        "Will: Gwen, I just don't want anything to happen to you.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Will: 'Cause we're friends.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I guess we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Second thoughts?",
        "Rosanna: About adopting this baby.",
        "Craig: Why would you think that?",
        "Rosanna: Why would I think that? Because I've come in here with all these papers that I've had drawn up, and you're out to lunch.",
        "Craig: No, I said fine. You having second thoughts?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: No. You know that I want this child.",
        "Craig: No, about me.",
        "Rosanna: Not if you want this baby.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, I want this baby. You know how I love babies. If it was up to me, we'd have a dozen babies.",
        "Rosanna: All right, then what's going on? Because I know it's something.",
        "Craig: In a couple of months, I will have a child. A son out there that I won't be able to know or hold or even see. And there's nothing I can do about it. But I can't just turn off my feelings. Otherwise, I wouldn't be much of a father. Okay? So there.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I understand that you're upset. I do. But I also know how you get when you're upset. So you have to promise me that you're not going to do anything devious or underhanded, okay? Because I cannot lose another child.",
        "Craig: I don't want to lose a child.",
        "Rosanna: All right, so we're going through with this adoption?",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes, and have I said thank you? Okay? How grateful I am for this? How much it means to me, okay? All right.",
        "Rosanna: I know it's hard for you. I know. It's very difficult to let go. But maybe if you just let yourself focus a little bit on this new baby, you know? We're going to be parents very soon.",
        "Craig: Yes, yes, and that's very exciting. And whatever help you need, I got.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. All right, maybe I'm jumping the gun a little bit with all of these papers and stuff. You know, I'm just going to not think about it for a little while. I've gotta go meet Carly for lunch and whatever. I'll see you later.",
        "Craig: All right. Say hi to your sister.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Craig: I'll be fine.",
        "Rosanna: All right.",
        "Margo: Craig? I saw Rosanna on the way out. She said you had good news?",
        "Craig: You talked to Tom yet?",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: I told you, I couldn't do anything about that. You can't reverse a judge's ruling.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe the judge would set aside her ruling if the district attorney had done anything besides just accept a hysterical princess's rants about just not wanting me to see my own child!",
        "Margo: Craig, please! It's not my fault. Look, I came here because I hated the way we left things, and I'm not going to leave here until we sort it all out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: For a girl who's on her way to Alaska, you're awfully coy.",
        "Meg: It's a bank shot.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not talking about the table. You think I don't know why you're staying on here in town?",
        "Meg: You need a nurse.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I can get nurses. I can get many, many nurses, all sizes and shapes. You're staying here because of him, Dusty. [Lucinda laughs] I'm right. You think that maybe, if you linger -- hmm, okay. If you linger long enough, he'll decide that you're his \"it\" girl.",
        "Meg: Oh. Now who's off the mark?",
        "Lucinda: Well, that depends upon how you look at it. It really does. You know, I think the more important question for you, darling, is -- to ask yourself -- is whether he's the \"it\" guy, the boyfriend for you. Far be it from me to force vital information down your throat.",
        "Meg: What's so vital?",
        "Lucinda: Okay. I like Dusty very much. I'm very found of him. And he's done very good work for me at Worldwide. At the same time, he hasn't been back in town very long. And in the years that he was away, the proverbial snow, as they say, has drifted. You know, he's had some problems. To cut it short, he's not the sweet boy that you remember him being.",
        "Meg: Who is?",
        "[Lucinda chuckles]",
        "Lucinda: That's very true. On the other hand, be aware. He's dangerous, in more ways than one. [Cell phone rings] Oh. Oh, my heavens. My daughters -- they're very persistent, I have to give them that.",
        "Bartender: Ms. Walsh?",
        "Lucinda: Ooh, thank you, darling.",
        "Meg: Thank you. You know, maybe we should call it a night.",
        "Lucinda: No. Not a bit, no. Here's to life and living, and living dangerously.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: No service. Great. Great. Okay, okay. You're early. But this is the first baby. It usually takes forever, so you're going to be fine. You're gonna be fine. Okay. Car keys, purse. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lucinda laughing]",
        "Lucinda: Well, hello. What is this? Is this welcoming committee?",
        "Sierra: Where have you been?",
        "Lucinda: Um, shall I tell them where I've been? Sure. She says I can tell you where I've been. I've been to Yo's. Yo's. I've been shooting pool.",
        "Lily: And drinking, apparently.",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely, baby. Absolutely. I've got on the best medical authority from Florence Nightingale over here. There is no harm in indulging a little bit before surgery.",
        "Sierra: What surgery?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm gonna go for the lumpectomy.",
        "Lily: Since when?",
        "Sierra: I thought you said you needed time to think about that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you know, there's no dealing with these girls. This is -- it's just amazing. I thought earlier you were just telling me that I should make up my mind. Oh, and I'm informing you -- I'm informing you formally I've hired her. She's my nurse. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Craig, I hated that judge's ruling, too, but I did sign that paper in your defense, and I have been on your side from the very beginning, almost. So don't blame this on me.",
        "Craig: I was just hoping it wasn't hopeless. You want something?",
        "Margo: What, to drink?",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Margo: No, no, I don't want anything to drink. It's not hopeless. You can appeal. I mean, you'll see him, eventually.",
        "Craig: When he's 5? \"Happy birthday. I'm your father. And that guy with the tool belt you call 'Dad' is an impostor.\"",
        "Margo: Yeah, but he's just 5. I mean, he's so young. He's just gonna be barely reading. And, you know, he'll maybe know a few songs. He's just at the beginning, Craig. You've got so much to teach him. You can teach him to ride a bike and you can teach him to go skiing or to go fishing. You'll have so many opportunities.",
        "Craig: You're his aunt. You'll keep an eye on him?",
        "Margo: Of course I will. And Katie and me, we'll bring you pictures and videotapes and tape recordings of his voice, and I'll do everything I can to soften Jen's heart.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, good luck.",
        "Margo: I know, I know, baby, it's hard. Well, what's the good news, huh?",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Margo: The good news. What?",
        "Craig: Oh, well, Rosanna and I have -- well, we've decided we need a new start.",
        "Margo: That's great. That's great. A honeymoon, huh?",
        "Craig: No. A new baby. We're going to adopt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There are none so blind as those who have too many drinks with too many tiny, mini, itsy-bitsy umbrellas.",
        "Emily: Hello. What are you doing? Who are you entertaining? It's just me.",
        "Paul: I need to be entertained. Entertain me. I need a vacation. We should go somewhere where they have coconuts. You know, coconuts, they don't just grow on trees.",
        "Emily: A vacation? I could be convinced.",
        "Paul: Okay, let's go. C'mon.",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa. Right now? There's no travel agent open this late, I assure you.",
        "Paul: A travel agent? We'll go to the airport. We'll hop on the next plane that's going somewhere warm. You don't need anything, right? No, you do. You need a toothbrush -- ooh, and a bikini. Which is good, 'cause they've got all those overpriced gift shops.",
        "Emily: Seriously, now?",
        "Paul: Yeah. We'll have breakfast at the beach. We'll have lunch at the lagoon --we'll have dinner at the --",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "Paul: We'll skip dinner, we'll skip dinner, if you know what I mean.",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "Paul: What? Paul -- you said Paul. But it sounded kinda like no. So I'm gonna give you three seconds to reconsider. Okay, two. One.",
        "Emily: I will go anywhere with you.",
        "Paul: Great.",
        "Emily: As long as we're not running away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Uh oh. You only drink tea when something's wrong.",
        "Rosanna: No, nothing's wrong.",
        "Carly: Well, then, why meet here? Why not come to the house?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I just thought you might enjoy a night out. [Rosanna sighs] And I thought we could use a little privacy.",
        "Carly: And whatever it is, you don't want to tell me.",
        "Rosanna: No, I do want to tell you. I just want you to hear me out.",
        "Carly: Tea it is.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, look, what I want you to understand is, first, that I miss Cabot so much.",
        "Carly: I know you do. And I know that you miss Paul.",
        "Rosanna: Paul has made choices that don't include me. But Cabot -- Cabot made me a Mother. And now I don't have anything to do with my life. I've -- I keep getting these catalogs in the mail with pictures of happy babies playing chess.",
        "Carly: Well, Sage is still chewing on her feet, if that's any consolation.",
        "Rosanna: That child has saved my sanity. And J.J. and Parker. But I need a child of my own. And so does Craig. So we have decided to adopt. Look, I know that you think that this is crazy and that it's crazy to trust Craig, but I am handling this adoption completely on my own. I've found my own lawyers, we've found a birth Mother, we've met with her, she's agreed, and so it's done. Okay, I know you have an opinion about this.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, I'm all for you having a child.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. I really expected you to be negative.",
        "Carly: Not about you having children in your life. The problem is you have Craig in your life. And as long as that man is around, no child is safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: Nothing. Just when we were in your car the first time, and I kissed you and you almost pushed me through the windshield.",
        "Will: I didn't push you through the windshield.",
        "Gwen: You were so not into me.",
        "Will: That's not true.",
        "Gwen: Now who's lying?",
        "Will: Well, it wasn't about you.",
        "Gwen: It's just as well.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: Well, I was pregnant then. I didn't know it, can you imagine if we would've hooked up?",
        "Will: We weren't going to, at least not right away.",
        "Gwen: No, probably not. You're not that kinda guy, you know. You have to like somebody first.",
        "Will: What, and you don't?",
        "Gwen: I thought I liked him -- Casey. I don't know, I guess I thought he liked me, too. I was wrong. I don't like him. I think he's a pig.",
        "Will: He can be piggish.",
        "Gwen: Spoken like a true best friend.",
        "Will: We're not best friends. We used to be. He still thinks we are, but we can't talk about anything. I told him the kid was mine and he can't question that.",
        "Gwen: He doesn't want to question it. I know you did this for Celia, but I appreciate it.",
        "Will: Maybe at first it was for Celia. But then, I guess it was for you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's one way to get even with a girl you didn't want to kiss.",
        "Will: Okay, it was for the baby. Someone needed to make sure you stop smoking.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that worked. Anyways, as soon as I deliver, you're off the hook.",
        "Will: Wait -- what do you mean?",
        "Gwen: I give birth to the baby, I give it away,I go home. A girl without a problem.",
        "Will: So you don't need a friend anymore?",
        "Gwen: No. I'm just saying I'll survive if you've got better things to do.",
        "Will: I don't know. This kinda works. I wouldn't mind keeping it up.",
        "Gwen: Yeah?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Well then maybe some -- ah!",
        "Will: What is it?",
        "Gwen: Oh! I don't know. But it's worse. It's worse than before.",
        "Will: All right, it's gonna be okay, Gwen. Hello? Yeah, it's an emergency. I need an ambulance.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, that's great. [Car pulls up outside] Oh, thank God. I'm in here!",
        "Dusty: Jen -- what happened?",
        "Jennifer: How many pregnant ladies does it take to screw in a light bulb?",
        "Dusty: You got electrocuted?",
        "Jennifer: No, I fell.",
        "Dusty: Are you all right?",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: You didn't sound very good on the phone. Can you stand up?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Oh, Dusty, my water broke.",
        "Dusty: Your water broke?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, when I fell.",
        "Dusty: And?",
        "Jennifer: I'm in labor. And I know how you hate that biology stuff, so I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Well, you don't look like you're in labor.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm in between contractions. But you know what, they might stop because it's early and I'm not due for another couple months.",
        "Dusty: Well, we got to get to the hospital!",
        "Jennifer: No, wait. The thing is is that they're less than three minutes apart.",
        "Dusty: Yes, we can't stay here. Where're the sheets?",
        "Jennifer: Sheets? Sheets?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I'm not putting you in my new car without sheets. I got a new car. [Jennifer laughs] Oh, you think I'm kidding, right?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no. Oh!",
        "Dusty: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, God! Oh, God, it's coming! Oh, the baby's coming!",
        "Dr. Schiller: She's fully dilated.",
        "Will: What does that mean?",
        "Bob: It means the medication didn't work. Gwen is going to give birth to her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: All right. I got the car right outside the door. The heat's on. Everything's gonna be fine, okay?",
        "Jennifer: No, the baby's early. It's gonna be premature.",
        "Dusty: No. They have got technology for that. Everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Jennifer: No, but what if --",
        "Dusty: Let's get you to the hospital. We'll worry about the what ifs later. Okay?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, wait.",
        "Dusty: Another contraction?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Oh, God! Oh, God, it's coming! Oh, the baby's coming!",

        "Sierra: You know, Mother, I'm glad that you're making some decisions, but --",
