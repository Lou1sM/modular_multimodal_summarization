        "Aaron quits the job he hasn't even started and is planning to leave town, all of which is overheard by Holden. A distraught Allison runs into Susan's arms. Dusty tries to reach out to Emily, but she is quick to rebuff him. Jack and Katie discuss Brad and Carly's plan to break them up, as Jack assures her that she has nothing to worry about. Brad has hatched a new plan for Jack and Katie when the other plan goes belly up. Carly reluctantly gets onboard. Allison tells Susan that she and Aaron fought. Susan isn't worried, but Allison starts to explain that she should be. Aaron tells Holden that he and Allison broke up and he can't stay in town, but Holden begs him to reach out to his family and reconsider. Emily is furious with Dusty for his betrayal. Dusty begs her to reconsider and give him a second chance; she should understand wanting one of those considering what she has been through. Emily knows what she has done in the past, but she can't do it and leaves Dusty. Carly goes to see Jack; she apologizes for spending time with Brad, but that is behind her now. She is nice about Katie and wants to take Sage off his hands so he can spend a beautiful summer night with Katie. Jack is suspicious. Brad and Katie are playing one another; Brad gets a \u0091call' from a jeweler and makes sure it is implied Jack is buying a ring. Aaron decides to stay around town, and gets his job back. Dusty confronts Aaron and asks him to give Allison a second chance, but he won't and he doesn't want anything to do with Dusty again. Susan learns what happened between Allison and Dusty, and she actually takes it in stride. Emily has it out with Allison; she wonders if she slept with Dusty to get back at her? Allison promises it was a mistake and begs Emily to forgive her and Dusty because they need her. Emily can understand somewhat that she was vulnerable, but can't get past their betrayal; she can't be around either one or them now. Katie calls the number on Brad's cell phone, gets a jeweler and figures it actually isn't a set up. Brad and Carly make sure that Jack and Katie end up planning to spend the evening together, thinking they are putting them on a collision course because Katie thinks Jack is going to propose and Jack is not at all thinking on those lines."

        "Aaron: Joel, Joel.",
        "Bar manager: Aaron, how's my new bartender?",
        "Aaron: Hey.",
        "Bar manager: You ready to make some money? Why don't you come back to the office with me? We'll get you all situated. Get your paperwork in order.",
        "Aaron: Listen, that sounds great, only -- the thing is, is -- I can't take the job.",
        "Bar manager: What are you talking about?",
        "Aaron: Listen, I appreciate that you made room for me and all, but I just have to say no.",
        "Bar manager: Is this some kind of joke?",
        "Aaron: No, Sir, it's not. I'm sorry for hanging you up like this.",
        "Bar manager: Look, one of the residents here, he vouched for you. Dusty Donovan. I mean, you know, he was nice about it, but he was either saying, take you or he's going to take his business elsewhere.",
        "Aaron: Dusty will understand, trust me. There won't be a problem.",
        "Bar manager: Maybe not for you. But I have a whole schedule that I have to rearrange.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry. I really am. The thing is, is that I'm leaving town. I'm not even going to be here. So thank you again, and sorry for hanging you up like this.",
        "Holden: Hey. I just heard all that. You want to tell me why you quit your job before it even started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "[Alison sneezes]",
        "Aaron: Gezundheit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Ali? Don't hate me. I couldn't resist. Glazed donuts. The nurses were selling them for some cause or other. And I know, they go straight to my thighs but sometimes it's worth it. Just promise me though, that you won't finish them. 'Cause I have to go to the hospital and come back, and I want something fattening when I get back here. Ali? What is it? Honey? What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey. Come on. Give us a chance.",
        "Emily: Who? Who? You and me? Or you and my sister?",
        "Dusty: I'm not interested in your sister.",
        "Emily: Why not, Dusty? Really, I was just a prostitute. She was a porn star.",
        "Dusty: I can't change what happened. I'm asking you to forgive me.",
        "Emily: What does that mean? I'm supposed to just forget that you slept with my sister?",
        "Dusty: No, you look past it. We go to Bermuda.",
        "Emily: We go to Bermuda. A little sun, a little wine and if all goes well, you get me in bed just like you planned?",
        "Dusty: I'm not asking for your body. I'm asking for your heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You smell like the pond.",
        "Katie: So do you. I am getting rid of all my swimsuits.",
        "Jack: Oh, well I don't know how the lifeguard at the country club is going to react to that.",
        "Katie: I don't care. They'll have to get used to it. 'Cause you've spoiled me. From now on, it's skinny dipping or nothing.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Well, it gets pretty cold round here about January.",
        "Katie: I'm sure we'll find ways to keep warm.",
        "Jack: I could do this all day.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Jack: Oh, uh --",
        "Katie: What? You have to call in?",
        "Jack: No, I got to call Carly, and check in with the kids.",
        "Katie: Yeah, before you do that --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Katie: I had a little run-in with Carly earlier. I should've told you about it, but we were having so much fun.",
        "Jack: Really? What happened?",
        "Katie: Just more of the same. She was going on and on about dating your brother and how different he was this time, deeper somehow, and I just got sick of it. I should've walked away, but I didn't. I told her that I was onto her. That we were both onto her. So she could keep pretending that she's dating Brad as long as she wants, but she wasn't going to get to us because we're really happy and she's not going to break us up. And I know, I shouldn't have taken the bait. And I shouldn't have put words in your mouth, but I couldn't help it. She was just so smug. Do you hate me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Well, don't look so disappointed.",
        "Carly: No, I'm not. I'm just busy.",
        "Brad: Liar.",
        "Carly: Brad!",
        "Brad: Be nice. Be nice, Carly. I have something for you. Two tickets to see the Sox. Okay, here's the plan. You're going to come by the studio, you're going to invite me to the game, and I'm going to be all thrilled and say something like, \"Oh, Carly, how did you know that I loved the Sox?\"",
        "Carly: Please, promise me you're never going to say that.",
        "Brad: Well, the point is --",
        "Carly: I know what the point is. The point is for Katie to see us and tell Jack, but that's not going to work.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because he's never going to buy it. Brad, I wouldn't go for you if you were the last Snyder on the planet! And he knows that.",
        "Brad: Carly, I am crushed.",
        "Carly: Well, sweep yourself up and get out of here. I've got work to do.",
        "Brad: What? You're just going to give up? No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Carly: I don't know what I'm going to do, Brad.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, so the idea of you and me together is a little obvious. But if we don't come up with some kind of plan to break up Jack and Katie, they're going to be marching down the aisle before we know it.",
        "Carly: Please, please just go. All right? The last thing I want is for Jack to see you here. Just go!",
        "Brad: I have an idea.",
        "Carly: A rare occurrence for someone like you, I'm sure --",
        "Brad: No, no, no. No, I think I know of a way to break them up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hate you? Katie, I got news for you, if I don't hate you by now, I probably never will. No, it's not possible.",
        "Katie: Well, I wouldn't blame you if you did. 'Cause you did kind of fall for the new improved Katie and with Carly today I was definitely the old me.",
        "Jack: Listen, listen, do you know how long I've waited for a woman to have the guts to come clean about something she's done that she's not proud of? I mean, granted, hey, nobody's perfect. We all have our moments. But the point is, you make it right. You don't try to get away with it or hide it, or blame somebody else.",
        "Katie: Are you talking about Carly?",
        "Jack: No, I'm talking about me. I'm talking about me and how grateful I am that I found someone that I can trust. I just couldn't take it anymore. Never knowing if she was lying to me, or playing me, or laughing at me behind my back. It's just --",
        "Katie: She wasn't laughing at you --",
        "Jack: How do you know that?",
        "Katie: Because I've been there. I know what it's like to mess up and be too scared to admit it. I just know now that that's the worst thing you can do. You're always watching what you say, and you can never relax. I mean, when I was with Henry. I didn't want to admit to myself, or to him, that I didn't love him as much as I should have. And it was the worst. I mean, it almost ruined our friendship. So, no matter how scared you are, you just have to be honest.",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Katie: What was that for?",
        "Jack: You're a class act, Lady.",
        "Katie: Oh, really? I wouldn't go that far, but thanks I'm glad you feel that way. I was a little nervous.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Katie: Well, you just -- I mean, it feels like to me that a part of you still feels the need to protect Carly, even now.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, I need to protect my kids. And I need to protect -- I think I need to protect you. I don't want her pulling anything. That said, I think this whole jealousy ploy was Brad's idea. I think he's the one pulling the strings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You're just fine with the status quo? You're fine with that? Jack sleeping with Katie. Waking up with her every morning. Taking your kids on a hike with him. Having more kids with her --",
        "Carly: Hey! Going to a baseball game with you is not going to change any of that.",
        "Brad: No, it isn't. Which is why I've come up with a different angle. If you would just listen to me.",
        "Carly: What? Should we book the honeymoon suite at the Lakeview and pay the desk clerk to call the gossip page at the City Times? Or I know we could kiss in the lobby of WOAK. That'll do it!",
        "Brad: No, no, no! We stop trying to make Jack jealous, focus on Katie.",
        "Carly: If we haven't made Jack jealous, there's no chance to get Katie jealous.",
        "Brad: Forget the jealousy thing. We need something new.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to kidnap Jack.",
        "Brad: Well, I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear that.",
        "Carly: I'm sort of half-serious. I cannot do anything that's even remotely criminal because I'm on probation.",
        "Brad: Carly, Carly, I'm not talking about you committing a crime. The crime here is Katie wasting herself on your ex-husband.",
        "Carly: Now who's jealous?",
        "Brad: You. Will you stop pretending that you're not in this with me and listen up. Okay, we need to get Jack and Katie to understand that this relationship that they're building is on very shaky ground.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What is it, Baby? Is it Aaron? What happened? Did he do something?",
        "Alison: We had a fight.",
        "Susan: Well that's to be expected, even under normal circumstances. But after what you guys have been through you're bound to have a few bumps along the way.",
        "Alison: It was more than that, Mom.",
        "Susan: I know he loves you. The way he looks at you? The way he came home to be with you? He wants you back.",
        "Alison: Oh, Mom, he doesn't.",
        "Susan: Yes, he does. No matter what he said. Maybe I should talk to him. He probably doesn't understand.",
        "Alison: No, please, Mom, don't talk to him.",
        "Susan: But you're so unhappy.",
        "Alison: That's not Aaron's fault. It's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So what's up?",
        "Aaron: Look, Dad, I was hoping that it could all work out. That I could take this job and make you proud, but --",
        "Holden: Hey, I'm always proud of you.",
        "Aaron: I appreciate that. I didn't come back here to get a job. I came back because I was hoping maybe Alison and I can patch things up.",
        "Holden: I thought you had.",
        "Aaron: So did I.",
        "Holden: Hey, if I'm going to help you out, I need a little more than that.",
        "Aaron: I can't give you more than that. I'm sorry, it's not -- it's not you. It's just --",
        "Holden: Private?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Okay, so you and Ali?",
        "Aaron: There is no more me and Ali.",
        "Holden: Okay, so what does that have to do with this job?",
        "Aaron: I can't see her. Dad, I can't be anywhere near her.",
        "Holden: I can understand that. But running away never solved any problems.",
        "Aaron: You're probably right. I'm still going back to Seattle.",
        "Holden: I wish you wouldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Give us a chance. Let's go to Bermuda. You can have your own room. And you don't even have to talk to me. Emily --",
        "Emily: Don't touch -- don't touch me! Is that how it happened? Ali got upset and you touched her. You put your hands all over her?",
        "Dusty: Do you want to know?",
        "Emily: I saw the DVD, remember?",
        "Dusty: Do you want to know?",
        "Emily: I don't know who you are, Dusty!",
        "Dusty: Yes, you do. Come on!",
        "Emily: The man who sat with me, while my sister shook and begged and cried for drugs! That man never would've slept with her. You knew how vulnerable she was!",
        "Dusty: Hey, maybe we both were!",
        "Emily: Well, then I'm happy for you.",
        "Dusty: Yes, I made a mistake! I slept with your sister. I made a mistake. I'm asking you to give me another chance.",
        "Emily: So -- so, once you've slept with a -- with a porn star, suddenly sleeping with an ex-prostitute suddenly seems possible?",
        "Dusty: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Emily: I distinctly remember you telling me that you couldn't see yourself with me because I'd been a -- I'd been a prostitute. But then you go to Vegas, you sleep with my sister, and suddenly we have a clean slate?",
        "Dusty: I told you I was in no place to judge you. That's what I told you.",
        "Emily: Come on, I'm waiting. I'm waiting for your Jennifer speech. You know, the one how Jennifer dying has spoiled you from having any other kind of relationship.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it did.",
        "Emily: Well, cue the violins, Dusty!",
        "Dusty: Okay. I lost my wife and my son! I can't afford to lose again!",
        "Emily: But you can afford to sleep with my meth-addicted sister!",
        "Dusty: I haven't slept with anyone since Jennifer. Hadn't been with anyone. So, when your sister put her arms around me -- kissed me. She needed me. And I needed her. Emily, tell me you won't walk away.",
        "Emily: Do you have any idea what you're asking? I trusted you. How stupid am I? I thought we had a future.",
        "Dusty: We do.",
        "Emily: We do until some other broken woman crosses your path?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Emily: You don't know that, do you?",
        "Dusty: I'm asking for a chance. You of all people.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, me of all people? That's nice. Thanks a lot.",
        "Dusty: You of all people should know something about doing things that you regret. That's what I mean.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Are you talking about the prostitution? Are you talking about what I did to you a long time ago? In that -- in the cabin --",
        "Dusty: You were a different person.",
        "Emily: Yeah I was! I know I hurt you. I know what I did. So what? I'm supposed to just let this slide? Because of what I did to you? I'm supposed to forgive you now?",
        "Dusty: I think you know how scared I am to lose you. You're not the only who took a risk here. I'm asking you to give me another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I can't stay.",
        "Holden: You know, if there's one thing that I learned this past year, it's that people in this family get in trouble when they try and do it all alone. You got your whole family on your side. Why don't you just reach out a little?",
        "Aaron: There's nothing anybody can do.",
        "Holden: Sure they can. They can help you see that you're not alone.",
        "Aaron: Look, I know you guys are all there for me.",
        "Holden: So stop all this talk about Seattle. We need you and you need us.",
        "Aaron: I'll think about it. Dad, thanks for being by my side.",
        "Holden: Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why would you think that this little campaign is Brad's idea and not Carly's?",
        "Jack: Well, you and I both know that he's got a little thing for you, Katie. Come on.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, what they're doing involves a little bit of strategy, and not to put your brother down, but he's not the sharpest crayon in the box.",
        "Jack: Well, wait a minute. Let's think about what he's managed to accomplish since he's been to Oakdale. He's staying here, rent free, barely does a chore. Talked his way onto a television set with absolutely no experience, and now he's seeing Carly. He's seeing Carly. A woman who swore she'd never have anything to do with him ever again.",
        "Katie: But Carly, again, not to insult anyone --",
        "Jack: No, wait a minute. Whoa, timeout. Carly's M.O. is that she sets out to do the right thing, and when it doesn't work, or she finds herself in a jam, she takes a short cut or she bends the rules.",
        "Katie: Okay, but you said it yourself, she would never date him. So why is she trying to convince us that she is?",
        "Jack: I'm sure she thinks that she's making me jealous.",
        "Katie: Is she?",
        "Jack: Okay, listen. She knows me very well, yes, and do does Brad. They know how to push my buttons. But one thing they can't make me do is give on up what I really, really, want. And that's you. So stop looking so worried. I'm not going anywhere. For the next 15 minutes, anyway.",
        "Katie: What does that mean?",
        "Jack: I've got to watch the kids tonight.",
        "Katie: I thought the boys had plans.",
        "Jack: They do, but I promised Sage that I'd help her build her dollhouse, I'm sorry, her doll penthouse. So maybe tomorrow night? What do you say? You free?",
        "Katie: Oh, I'll have to check my schedule.",
        "Jack: Oh, okay, well you think you can fit me in for a couple of hours? I want to take you someplace special and show you how much you mean to me.",
        "Katie: You got yourself a date.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Katie: In the meantime --",
        "Jack: Yes?",
        "Katie: Brad pulls anything, what do we do?",
        "Jack: Brad? Forget about Brad. He lost. Lucky for me.",
        "Katie: All right.",
        "Jack: Come on. Drive safe, okay?",
        "Katie: Okay. Game may be over, Brad, but you're not getting away with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You really think that could work?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. We set it up right, Katie will be all nervous. You know how she gets. And then Jack will feel cornered. You know how much he loves that.",
        "Carly: Not his best event.",
        "Brad: Before you know it, no more Jack and Katie.",
        "Carly: Here's the thing -- Katie seems pretty secure.",
        "Brad: Yeah, which is why we need to take her down a peg or two. You know, Jack's been spending all of his time defending himself. You know, telling Katie that you and I are a non-issue, the only one's her and only her.",
        "Carly: Hey. All right. You made your point.",
        "Brad: All right, so if we take us out of the mix, what do you have left? You have a woman who feels like she's entitled because Jack makes her think that. All right? So, what do women want when they feel secure? They want to move forward.",
        "Carly: Oh, this is scary. This peek into your miniscule brain.",
        "Brad: I know how my brother thinks. You know? And if we can -- if we can get Katie to think that Jack's having second thoughts about the relationship --",
        "Carly: Well, but from what I've seen, he's not having second thoughts.",
        "Brad: Carly, it doesn't matter! Okay, if Katie thinks that Jack has got cold feet, she'll crowd him. The rest is history.",
        "Carly: It hasn't happened yet.",
        "Brad: It will. I guarantee you. The only thing you have to do -- the only thing you have to do is make sure Jack that Jack is free tonight. I'll do the rest. [Cell phone ringing] And you doubted me.",
        "Carly: Who is it?",
        "Brad: Hello, Katie.",
        "Katie: Brad, listen, I was thinking. Can you meet me at WOAK? I have a few segment ideas that I want to run past you.",
        "Brad: Sure. Absolutely. I mean, you know how much I love your -- your input. 20 minutes.",
        "Katie: I'll be there.",
        "Brad: Slam dunk.",
        "Carly: Well, now, no -- don't get ahead of yourself now.",
        "Brad: She's walking right into it.",
        "Carly: Be careful. 'Cause if you mess this up, we may not have another chance --",
        "Brad: Not a chance. All right? This time next week? You and Jack will be sharing more than just kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not the same person I was. I look back, I don't even recognize myself. How could I do it? How could I walk into a hotel room and take money for sex? How could --",
        "Dusty: It's okay.",
        "Emily: No, it's not. It's not okay. It changes you. I don't think you can come back from something like that. It's like you -- you have to shut a part of yourself down.",
        "Dusty: Which is why we agreed to take our time.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it's not that simple. I mean, I thought it was -- because of you. You made me -- you made me believe it was. Made me believe that we had a future. That I could trust you. But I can't.",
        "Dusty: That's -- that's not true.",
        "Emily: I was crazy to think that this could work -- me and you. Either you'd let me down or I'd be so scared you'd let me down that I would never let you in.",
        "Dusty: We've come back from so much worse. We're not juveniles, you know? We can talk. We can work through it. If you give it a chance.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I put a dash of cinnamon in that. It keeps me from using too much cocoa, which keeps her up. Oh, Sage's nightgown, it was in the wash when she left, I forgot to pack it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, she told me she'd forgotten it. I gave her an old t-shirt.",
        "Carly: Oh, I bet she loved that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right. She wants what she wants.",
        "Carly: Like her mother. I should go.",
        "Jack: Heard you and Katie mixed it up earlier.",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah. Jack, about that, that -- that wasn't Katie's fault. She was just being protective, which I completely understand. She okay?",
        "Jack: She's fine.",
        "Carly: Well, that's good. 'Cause really, it's nothing personal. Okay, I guess it's no secret that Katie's not exactly my favorite person in the world, but the truth is that anybody that you were dating -- be as hard for me. You know. Will you tell her that?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: It really is just a sticky situation all the way around. And I'm no saint. I say things.",
        "Jack: Do you have to?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Sometimes yeah, I do. I don't have to tell you I really hate being wrong.",
        "Jack: Wrong?",
        "Carly: What you said about me and Brad. You were absolutely right. We have no business being together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Shooting stars.",
        "Brad: Shooting stars. You and me?",
        "Katie: No, comets. August is comet season. We could do a segment on star gazing.",
        "Brad: But we're a morning show, Katie.",
        "Katie: So we'll tell them in the morning to be sure to look for the stars at night. Sorry, am I boring you?",
        "Brad: No, no, no. Listening to your ideas is a thrill a minute.",
        "Katie: Do you have something better to do? A date with Carly?",
        "Brad: We decided to give that a rest.",
        "Katie: Really? It wasn't better the second time around?",
        "Brad: I wouldn't know.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Maybe it's Carly begging you to reconsider.",
        "Brad: No such luck. Hello? This is Mr. Snyder. A ring? What kind of ring? No, it's not mine, you must have the wrong number. Look, I don't care where you got my phone number. Fine, take it up with your internet provider. It's -- it's not my ring, okay? I didn't order one. Look, you got the wrong Snyder. This is Brad Snyder. You're probably looking for my brother, Jack. Yeah, try him at Oakdale P.D. He works there. Look, I'm going to get some coffee, do you want some?",
        "Katie: I'm good. So who was that on the phone?",
        "Brad: Wrong number. Hey, look, do you want to -- do you want to shake things up in august, let's do a segment on June brides? And how most of them wish they were still single.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, that'll get the women watching.",
        "Brad: Hey, you never know. You know, most weddings end in divorce anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Your sister saw you and Dusty?",
        "Alison: I don't know what to do, Mom. She was so hurt. And -- and then, Aaron, he -- he left me. It's over. Go ahead, I'm sure you're mad at me too.",
        "Susan: I'm just -- I don't know what. Sad? For all of you. You all looked so happy at our little lunch. And I know that happiness like that doesn't last. At least, it never has for me. But -- Emily? Emily --",
        "Emily: Don't.",
        "Susan: I just want you --",
        "Emily: Don't.",
        "Susan: To know that I love you. Both of you.",
        "Alison: You have every right to hate me. You can say it. There's nothing I haven't been called before. You want me to leave town? I'll leave town. But please just say something.",
        "Emily: Why, Alison? Why'd you do it?",
        "Alison: Does it really matter?",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah, yeah, it matters to me. Did you sleep with Dusty to get back at me for dragging you back to Oakdale?",
        "Alison: No, of course not.",
        "Emily: For what -- for making you stop doing the drugs?",
        "Alison: I'm grateful to you for that.",
        "Emily: Then what is it, Alison? Was it Chris Hughes? Huh? You're getting back at me for being with Chris Hughes? I know he left you at the altar and you were devastated about it.",
        "Alison: I was, but I'm over that. And it's not your fault that he was in love with you. Besides, it was a good thing that we didn't marry each other. We weren't right for each other. And I was meant to be with Aaron.",
        "Emily: Right. But when you couldn't have Aaron, you figured Dusty would do in a pinch?",
        "Alison: Emily, it wasn't like I planned this. I wasn't longing for Dusty or thinking about him like that --",
        "Emily: You knew I wanted him. You knew how much I cared about him. You told me to go for him.",
        "Alison: I still think you should. Emily, we were just two banged-up people who ended up next to each other after a long night. We were just hanging onto each other, that's all it was. And I know that doesn't make it any easier to take. I couldn't even watch the DVD, I was so ashamed.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I would be, too. The lighting was a lot better in your movie.",
        "Alison: I was ashamed because I had no right to turn to him. He was yours. He's still yours --",
        "Emily: I don't want him anymore.",
        "Alison: Yes, you do.",
        "Emily: No, I don't. God, you know what? I do. And I just can't -- I'm not going to be able to get past this.",
        "Alison: Emily. You can. You are the strongest person I know. He needs you. I need you. And I know I don't deserve it, but you have to forgive me.",

        "Bar manager: You can drop your uniform with the hotel dry cleaner, just them you're on staff. And they'll have it back to you at the end of the day.",
        "Aaron: Hey, thanks a lot for the job back. I know I threw a little curve ball at you an hour ago but thanks for making like it never happened.",
        "Bar manager: No problem.",
        "Aaron: All right. See you.",
        "Dusty: Congratulations. I was hoping we can talk.",

        "Katie: So, you really are a jeweler?",
        "Jeweler: Yes, ma'am offering precious and semi-precious stones in a variety of settings.",
        "Katie: Really? That's great.",
        "Jeweler: Is there anything I can help you with?",
        "Katie: Actually, um, I'd love it if you can tell me --",
        "Brad: What the hell are you doing with my phone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I never should've gone to that cocktail party with Brad. And then to breakfast with him the very next morning. Well you can imagine what that did to his ego. And you told me. You warned me to stay away from him, but I did not listen.",
        "Jack: So, what happened? Did he hurt you?",
        "Carly: No. No, nothing like that. It's just I took a long, hard look in the mirror. What the hell am I doing? Brad is a dead end. Especially because he's only using me to get to Katie. I'm sure that you realized that he has a thing for his co-star.",
        "Jack: He's mentioned that once or twice.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And anyway, I really do need to focus on the kids. In fact, I was thinking, if you don't have any special plans for Sage tonight, maybe I could take her. It's so rare that I get her alone, and I promised to teach her to crochet.",
        "Jack: That sounds -- that sounds great, but we set up this schedule for a reason. The kids need consistency.",
        "Carly: Right. I understand. I thought that maybe you can make an exception this once. But -- I understand. I do. So, I will just leave the crochet hook here and some yarn, and the instruction book, okay? And she can look at it and I'll talk to her about it another time.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll give it to her.",
        "Carly: Okay. But just so you know, now that I'm not seeing Brad anymore, my evenings are wide open. So if anything ever comes up, I mean, I know that you like your consistency. But if anything comes up, an event with Katie or whatever and you want to switch, that's fine with me.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, tell Sage that if she has any questions, just to give me a call.",
        "Jack: Will do.",
        "Carly: Maybe she could just talk to Katie. You know, I'm sure that Katie knows how to crochet.",
        "Jack: Katie's not coming by tonight, Carly.",
        "Carly: She's not? Oh, I'm -- never mind.",
        "Jack: No, you what?",
        "Carly: I just thought, you know, Sage likes her so much, I thought it would be the three of you.",
        "Jack: Nope.",
        "Carly: Okay. Are you sure that you don't want to change your mind then? In that case, if you want to spend some time with Katie, and drop Sage off to me, I would be totally okay with that --",
        "Jack: Okay, what's going on? Why are you here? And why are you being so nice about Katie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I understand you're angry. But don't take it out on Alison. It's my fault.",
        "Aaron: You expect me to take advice from you?",
        "Dusty: I'm just asking you to do the right thing.",
        "Aaron: The right thing? The right thing, like you know something about that.",
        "Dusty: It's my mistake, I'm paying for it.",
        "Aaron: We're all paying for it, Dusty. And I can't believe I used to actually look up to you. My dad warned me about you and I just ignored him. Here we are. Dusty always looking out for number one. Everyone else is cleanup.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to do the right thing.",
        "Aaron: Well, you can't.",
        "Dusty: Well, if you're not going to give Alison a second chance, maybe I can.",
        "Aaron: Look, do me a favor, okay? Oakdale's a small town. And you live here and I work here, so we're going to run into each other.",
        "Dusty: That's why I'm talking to you. I want to clear the air.",
        "Aaron: Just stay away from me, okay? Give me that much respect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I don't blame you. I don't really. I mean, yes, this could have all been avoided if you said no or if Dusty said no. But -- I can understand how chaotic things were, how vulnerable you were. I'm just having a really hard time wrapping my head around all this.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. But we can get past this.",
        "Emily: I don't think so. See, I thought I had a future with Dusty. I thought I could make this work. But because of you and him, we can't. I don't think I could stand to be around either one of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Next time I'll call first. I just wanted to bring by sage's nightgown. That's all.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so you said. But that doesn't explain why you've gone out of your way to say nice things about Katie.",
        "Carly: This isn't about Katie. It's about you.",
        "Jack: Me?",
        "Carly: We're single parents, Jack. With three kids. And I just thought because I'm free and wanting to spend time with Sage anyway, that you would let me have her tonight. Sort of set a precedent, so if there's ever a time that I have a last minute meeting or whatever, you'd be willing to swap. That's all.",
        "Jack: So me seeing Katie tonight, that doesn't bother you? That's not a problem?",
        "Carly: Oh, it bothers me. It's a problem. In fact, I much prefer it if she took her 100-watt smile and moved to Los Angeles. But that's not going to happen. And so I'm dealing with it. And maybe putting a few points in the bank, so that if I ever need a favor -- you know me. I'm in it for what I can get out of it.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Carly: The point is, it's summer. It's a beautiful night out there. And if you want to spend some time with Katie, you go right ahead. And the next time I ask to spend some time with my favorite girl, you be nice.",
        "Jack: You always drove a hard bargain.",
        "Carly: You always loved it.",

        "Katie: Sorry, Brad, I didn't mean to snoop.",
        "Brad: You didn't mean to snoop? I mean, snooping is pretty much deliberate. I mean, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Okay, I did mean to snoop. But you were very mysterious about that call, so --",
        "Brad: It was a wrong number.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it was. Only they told you something that you didn't really want to hear.",
        "Brad: Well, you don't know that for sure.",
        "Katie: I understand. I mean, I know I've given you a hard time about your little crush on me. But I get it. You had this fantasy about what this could be and that call just pretty much shut the door on that.",
        "Brad: All I can say is, don't count your chickens before they're hatched.",
        "Katie: We won't talk about it if it's going to upset you.",
        "Brad: Who's upset? Who's -- upset? The only thing I care about is spending the month of august talking about shooting stars while our ratings tank.",
        "Katie: Okay, whatever makes you happy --?",
        "Brad: You know what? We're going to do six-part series on divorce.",
        "Katie: Okay, you can talk to Kim about that. [Cell phone rings] Excuse me. Hey, how are you?",
        "Jack: Good. You still free tonight?",
        "Katie: I could be. Why? I thought you had Sage.",
        "Jack: There was a -- there was a change of plans. Carly's going to take Sage.",
        "Katie: Oh, great. What did you have in mind?",
        "Jack: Well, I -- I told you that I wanted to show you how much you mean to me. So, you think, maybe you can meet me at the Lakeview and I can give you a night to remember?",
        "Katie: I would love that. Okay. So, I will go home and change and I'll meet you there.",
        "Brad: So, what about us doing work?",
        "Katie: Oh, well, you were so thrilled about my ideas, I figured we would just take the night off.",
        "Brad: So Jack calls and work just flies out the window?",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Brad, don't be like that.",
        "Brad: Be like what? You're the one who dragged me down here.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and then you got that call from the jeweler, only it wasn't for you. It was for Jack. Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't know what's going on here.",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: So this lovely mood you're in is because of comets.",
        "Brad: So, Jack is going to get a ring. So what? I never liked rings on men, it makes them look like pimps.",
        "Katie: He didn't buy it for himself.",
        "Brad: So who'd he buy it for?",
