        "Liberty: Hey, Tough Guy! Parker, wait! Parker! It's not my fault your dad's having sex with my mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Open wide.",
        "Jack: What's it with the banana-cream pie? How's that supposed to help?",
        "Janet: It's supposed to make you feel better.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Janet, listen. No offense, but I really just need --",
        "Janet: Whoa! No offense? Come on. That's an awfully formal word coming from somebody who's seen me in my undies.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: Come on! It's from the purple leopard. Can't go wrong with purple leopard.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Jack: Janet!",
        "Janet: Look, you've had a rough night. Can't be easy arresting your cousin's husband. People talk around here. I listen.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I really don't want to get into --",
        "Janet: I know you don't want to talk about it. In fact, I don't think we should talk. Because you and me -- we're not about talking. We're about sex -- uncomplicated sex.",
        "Jack: Okay, uh -- [Jack chuckles] And you're still okay with that?",
        "Janet: Hell, yeah. It's all about sex and pie. Pie and sex.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: Come on! Have a taste.",
        "Jack: Say sex one more time.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Jack: You trying to get me fat?",
        "Janet: I'm trying to give you an excuse to work out naked. Come on, now. Just think of how many calories we could burn off if you play your cards right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey, what are you doing over here? I thought you were supposed to meet me by the red doors.",
        "Liberty: Sorry. I was just working on a problem.",
        "Brad: Did you hear that? Did you hear that? My kid is getting started early on her homework.",
        "[Brad laughs]",
        "Katie: I don't think she meant that kind of problem. Is it something we can help you with?",
        "Liberty: Uh, no. Not with this.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Katie: Try us.",
        "Liberty: Well, I got stuck doing this after-school thing for English, and I didn't think Parker would still be around. But then I saw him, and he just, like, rode off.",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Liberty: Because I told him that his dad was hooking up with my mom, and now he wants absolutely nothing to do with me.",
        "Katie: That's weird. Why would Parker care if his dad and your mom were friends?",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Liberty: Because they're not just friends. They're doing it.",
        "Brad: Doing what?",
        "Liberty: Oh, grow up, Dad. Do I really have to paint a picture for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Listen, I don't know when I'm gonna be able to come over this week. I'm pretty tied up with this case.",
        "Janet: That's okay. You're busy. I get it.",
        "Jack: Whoa, hey. It's not like I don't want to see you. It's just that -- listen, I just don't want --",
        "Janet: It's just that you don't want me calling you my boyfriend. No regular date night. No strings. Just to let you know, none of that stuff is on my menu, either. I get it. It's uncomplicated sex.",
        "Jack: Can I -- can I get some -- can I get some coffee with that?",
        "Janet: Oh!",
        "Jack: And maybe some pie with the sex?",
        "Janet: Detective, I'm not so sure about that. A second cup of coffee sounds an awful lot like a commitment to me.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Janet: Mm! What was that for?",
        "Jack: That's just foreplay.",
        "Janet: One second cup of commitment-free coffee coming right up.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Jack and Janet, doing it? No way.",
        "Liberty: Way. Like you didn't see this coming?",
        "Brad: Liberty, why would I even think that this would be an issue? I --",
        "Liberty: Now that she knows you're not interested in her, what do you think she's gonna do -- shrivel up and swear off sex forever? No.",
        "Brad: No. Well, I mean, I don't know what I would -- I mean, I thought that maybe Janet would get -- I don't know what I thought, okay?",
        "Liberty: Well, this is what always happens with my mom. It doesn't work out with one guy, so -- poof -- there's another one, two seconds later. It's not a big deal. What are you so freaked out about?",
        "Katie: Yeah. That's a good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Sure I can't bring anything?",
        "Lily: We have got everything we need here. So just focus on having a good time and looking fabulous.",
        "Carly: I think you're making too much of this.",
        "Lily: Is this or is this not your first dinner date since your divorce from Jack?",
        "Carly: I -- I don't consider dinner with friends an actual date, really. Besides, I barely know Neal. This could be the last date. He -- he could chew with his mouth open for all I know.",
        "Lily: Since he's successful and wealthy and British, my guess is that he's housebroken. Ooh! He's gonna bring you flowers.",
        "Carly: We're not going to the prom. He's not gonna bring me flowers.",
        "Lily: You've landed yourself a very fancy guy.",
        "Carly: Don't you know it's the fancy ones you have to look out for? They dazzle you with limousines and turn out to be jewel thieves.",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Lily: Will you try not to talk yourself out of this before anything even happens?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, there's a reason to hate him. He's early.",
        "Lily: Be nice. You could end up marrying this guy.",
        "Carly: Never happen.",
        "Lily: You never know.",
        "Carly: I'll see you soon. Bye.",
        "Holden: We cannot do this dinner tonight. You need to make up some excuse. Don't go.",
        "Carly: I can't drop out of dinner now. Lily made lamb! Neal's on his way!",
        "Holden: Tell him you got sick.",
        "Carly: I was just talking to Lily just now. She knows I'm not sick.",
        "Holden: Couldn't you at least wear an ugly dress?",
        "Carly: Holden --",
        "Holden: I cannot have wine and cheese and pretend that everything is normal between us.",
        "Carly: If I can do it, then so can you.",
        "Holden: Lily thinks something's going on.",
        "Carly: What? Why do you say that? Did she say something?",
        "Holden: She keeps asking me if something's wrong, and I keep lying to her. She's not pushing the issue yet. What happens when we're all in the same room together? I'm looking at you. You think she won't know how much I want you?",
        "Carly: She better not. She better not see anything, Holden, or I will never forgive you.",
        "Holden: Is this date that important to you?",
        "Carly: I'd rather be with you. But that can't happen. You're married. You have a family. You -- you and Lily can make it work. You have a chance to be happy. I'm not gonna let you throw that away. I won't do it!",
        "Holden: Oh, okay. So going out with this guy -- you're doing it for me.",
        "Carly: I want to like him. I want him to make me laugh. I want him to make me feel pretty.",
        "Holden: What else?",
        "Carly: Are you asking me if I'm gonna sleep with him?",
        "Holden: I don't think I have the right to do that.",
        "Carly: Damn straight you don't. I'm gonna be in that room tonight, too, you know, where Lily will be touching you and kissing you, and I'm supposed to pretend that it doesn't matter to me.",
        "Holden: Then stay away.",
        "Carly: I can't. I cannot bail on dinner, because Lily will worry about me. I can't erase the fact that you and I slept together, and I -- I can't stop the fact that I want to be with you again.",
        "Holden: I want that, too. I want that.",
        "Carly: I can't have you, so I have two choices -- be alone, or find somebody else. I don't want to be alone.",
        "Holden: All right. Then we'll do what we need to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why are you so out of control about this?",
        "Brad: I am not out of control about this!",
        "Katie: I thought Janet's personal life didn't matter to you anymore.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know when that changed? When she started sleeping with Jack, okay? He shouldn't be putting his business in the street, where his kid and my kid have to hear about it. Can you -- can you please do me a favor? Can you take Liberty home?",
        "Katie: Depends. Are you gonna go talk to Janet?",
        "Brad: No, no. I have got nothing to say to Janet. It's my brother that I need to track down.",
        "Katie: Okay. No fighting, though, please.",
        "Brad: Can I at least yell at him?",
        "Katie: Yes. Go --",
        "Brad: I really need to yell at him!",
        "Katie: Go for it. Okay. You ready to go home? Sorry you're having to deal with this. Your mom's sex life should not be your problem.",
        "Liberty: I'm not stressing out about it. I do not care who my mom sleeps with. I just -- [Liberty groans] I can't figure out what to do about Parker.",
        "Katie: I don't understand that, either. I mean, no matter what's going on with Jack and Janet, you guys can still be friends.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but not in his book. To him, it's like incest or something. I don't know. It just -- he's really letting it mess up our relationship.",
        "Katie: You and Parker have a -- define \"Relationship.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Don't tell me you didn't have relationships when you were in high school, Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh, of course I did. We hung out, went to movies.",
        "Liberty: Same with me and Parker.",
        "Katie: Kissed.",
        "Liberty: I'm not saying we have, but so what if we have?",
        "Katie: Then we'd have a problem.",
        "Liberty: What? Why?",
        "Katie: Because Parker's younger than you.",
        "[Liberty scoffs]",
        "Liberty: Well, I like younger men. It's really not like it matters anymore. You can just leave it to parents to ruin everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neal: Carly, please be honest.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "Neal: If I've offended you or overstepped in some way, I'd like to know. I tend to barge ahead without taking no for an answer. Given your friend Lily and my attempt to get you to come to dinner tonight, I hope you don't feel forced into this tonight.",
        "Carly: Not forced. Pursued -- relentlessly pursued.",
        "Neal: So you just said yes to be polite? I see. No harm done. I'll just take my potted plant and go, never to darken your doorstep again.",
        "Carly: Neal, what about dinner?",
        "Neal: I'll send our regrets. It's been nice knowing you.",
        "Carly: I -- I wasn't just being polite. But if you're gonna give up on me, just like that --",
        "Neal: Stay away for a day, perhaps two, and then the vision of you in that dress would come to me unbidden and galvanize me into action.",
        "Carly: And you'd give me a call?",
        "Neal: I'd write a heartfelt letter, asking you to forgive any sin I've committed.",
        "Carly: And would you deliver this letter in person?",
        "Neal: Of course, accompanied with a veritable truckload of wildflowers, hoping against hope you'd change your mind and allow me to get to know you. Allow me to know you, lovely Carly.",
        "Carly: Give me back my orchid. [Neal chuckles] I like it. Thank you.",
        "Neal: But you're upset about something.",
        "Carly: It's nothing to do with you.",
        "Neal: Splendid. Then all that's left is to show you a good time and to put your worries at rest.",
        "Carly: Well, I -- I think I should confess, I do have a lot of worries.",
        "Neal: They're no match for a man of my singular determination. Let's go. You're going to have a good time tonight, lovely Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, Parker's not answering his cell phone, and he's not answering the phone at home. He -- I'm sure he saw me.",
        "Janet: And he just took off without saying anything?",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's not like him at all.",
        "Janet: Well, you know kids that age. One minute, they're begging you for money, and the next minute, they're treating you like you're lamer than -- I don't know -- something like that.",
        "Jack: About covers it. Whatever you say.",
        "Janet: Hey, Brad! How you doing? Take a load off. You want some coffee?",
        "Brad: No, thank you. I need to talk with you.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Brad: Outside.",
        "Jack: Okay, clearly you're upset about something. You want to clue me in?",
        "Brad: Don't try to deny it.",
        "Jack: Gonna need a bigger clue than that.",
        "Brad: You slept with Janet.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Brad: So? You made a big mistake!",
        "Jack: What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Brad: Listen, I warned you --",
        "Jack: Stop pushing me.",
        "Brad: I warned you. I told you that Janet was super vulnerable ever since I rejected her. But you can't -- you can't stay away from her? You got to go after her? What's wrong with you?",
        "Jack: What are you talking about? We -- listen to me. You're a happily married man, right? Why don't you go be happy and stay out of my private life?",
        "Brad: Well, it's not so private when you're practically making out in broad daylight!",
        "Jack: We were having coffee, Brad! It was coffee! And whatever Janet and I do, it's none of your damn business!",
        "Brad: It is my business when it involves my daughter!",
        "Jack: What does Liberty have to do with any of this?",
        "Brad: Because she's the one -- she's the reason why I found out that you two were doing it. Oh, you think you're being so private? You think you're being so private, Jack? Why don't you ask your son how he feels about you two hooking up?",
        "Jack: My son?",
        "Brad: But, you know, I don't know what's worse -- Janet, you know, laying it all out for Liberty like she's some sort of gal pal, or you hiding things, like Janet's some, like, dirty little secret! I hate this! It is just like what Mom used to do!",
        "Jack: Where did that come from? Janet's nothing like Mom?",
        "Jack: No, you are! You're just like her! Lying about who you -- you really are a --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Parker's not just a younger man. He's still a boy.",
        "Liberty: Which works, 'cause I'm still a girl.",
        "Katie: All right. Age aside, Parker's had a lot to deal with -- things that would make him probably back off from a relationship. And it doesn't have anything to do with Jack and Janet.",
        "Liberty: Like what?",
        "Katie: Like his parents' divorce, and his dad's marriage to me and our divorce, and his parents getting back together and then splitting up again. I mean, he probably feels like every time he gets close to someone, they --",
        "Liberty: They flake out and leave.",
        "Katie: Yeah, exactly. He's had a lot to deal with. You can understand why he'd be cautious right now.",
        "Liberty: Because of you, and his mom and his dad with my mom. I mean, really, what is wrong with you people?",
        "Katie: Why are you getting mad at me?",
        "Liberty: Because if you quote/unquote grown-ups would just give a little bit more thought to who you decide to sleep with, then Parker and I would not be having the problems that we're having. And maybe for once, you guys could, I don't know, maybe not sleep with someone's stepmom or ex-wife or brother or -- it would just make things a lot easier.",
        "Katie: Wait. Whoa. Where are you going?",
        "Liberty: To do damage control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: What are you doing?",
        "Janet: Checking for bruises. The way Brad came after you, I thought one of you would end up bloody. What the hell was he so bent out of shape about?",
        "Jack: Oh, same reason Parker wouldn't talk to me. Did you tell Liberty about us -- that we were --?",
        "Janet: Sleeping together? Absolutely not!",
        "Jack: Well, then, how did she find out about it, Janet?",
        "Janet: Look, you asked me to keep it on the D.L., and that's exactly what I did. But --",
        "Jack: But -- but what? What did you -- what did you say to her?",
        "Janet: Jack, she's not stupid. She probably saw it with her own eyes. I mean, for goodness' sakes!",
        "Jack: I can't believe this.",
        "Janet: What? What's wrong with her knowing? It's the truth.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but it -- it's the details they don't need to know about, okay? What they think and what they -- and what is confirmed are two completely different things.",
        "Janet: Jack -- Jack, you're a cop. What happened to the truth and nothing but? 'Cause, see, in my book, keeping secrets from her is the same thing as lying to her.",
        "Jack: But -- but in my book, protecting them from things that they are too young to know about -- that's where I'm coming from, okay? I did not want Parker to know about this.",
        "Janet: Okay. Just as long as you're not mad at me. You, uh -- you're still coming over later, right? I mean, you're not gonna just leave me hanging with foreplay, are you?",
        "Jack: I got to go.",
        "[Parker sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neal: Lily was telling me about the stables over at the Snyder farm. Holden, I had no idea you actually breed horses.",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "Lily: Holden's been around horses his entire life. He actually has bred and trained some outstanding thoroughbreds.",
        "Neal: Impressive. Do you ride?",
        "Carly: Yes. Uh, born and raised in Montana. It's a requirement. Do you?",
        "Neal: I love it.",
        "Lily: Didn't I hear you say something about owning a horse farm?",
        "Neal: In Buenos Aires. We breed polo ponies.",
        "Carly: Oh, that sounds fantastic! I've always wanted to go to Argentina. It must be beautiful.",
        "Neal: It is. Orchids grow like wildflowers down there. [Carly laughs] You should come. You and Holden should come, too, now that I know you know horses.",
        "Holden: Count me out. I have no interest in polo and no respect for anyone who plays it.",
        "Neal: Well, your disdain would apply to me, also. I play polo.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I figured.",
        "Lily: Holden, when did you become so opinionated about polo? Uh, I'm sure you didn't mean to insult Neal.",
        "Neal: No harm done. Polo's rather hopelessly British empire, isn't it? But it is a marvelous sport.",
        "Holden: Mm. That's one way to describe it.",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Carly: I -- I, um, would like to hear more about this construction project of yours.",
        "Neal: What would you like to know?",
        "Holden: I think polo is abusive. It's an open invitation for horses to get injured.",
        "Neal: Well, the same could be said about rodeo, don't you think? Besides, in both cases, the riders get hurt far more than the horses.",
        "Holden: Rodeo events are based on actual ranch skills.",
        "Lily: Holden --",
        "Holden: There's no point to a bunch of society types swinging sticks, clubbing each other and their horses.",
        "Lily: Holden, that's enough.",
        "Carly: Uh, Lily, I just remembered, I have to be at Metro tonight. I'm so sorry. I hope you understand.",
        "Lily: Really? You have to go?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I think I should. Is that okay with you?",
        "Neal: That's totally fine. Thank you so much for being such gracious hosts. So sorry we can't stay longer.",
        "Lily: Me, too. Oh.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Lily: Well, thank you for coming.",
        "Neal: Thanks for having us. Bye-bye.",
        "Lily: Bye. What on earth got into you?",
        "Holden: Lily, he started it, okay?",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, I hope you're satisfied, because in the competition, who was the most obnoxious, you won, hands down!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey. How'd it go?",
        "Brad: All right. I shoved Jack twice. I didn't hit him. I wanted to. Where's Liberty?",
        "Katie: She was still pretty upset. She didn't want to come home. Maybe I should have forced the issue, but I didn't really feel like --",
        "Brad: No, no. You -- no. You did the right thing. You -- you have good instincts. You're probably a better parent than me and Jack and Janet put together.",
        "Katie: I don't know about that. So, is Jack gonna stop seeing Janet?",
        "Brad: What do you think?",
        "Katie: He still seemed pretty angry, so my guess would be no.",
        "Brad: This is gonna turn into a huge problem. Liberty's gonna see her mother sleeping around. She's gonna want to do the same thing.",
        "Katie: Brad, it's not like we weren't doing the same thing together before we were married.",
        "Brad: Look, we didn't have a teenager around, needing us to set a good example.",
        "Katie: Good example or not, Janet is her mother! There's nothing we can do to change that.",
        "Brad: Yeah, there is. We can get rid of Janet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker, you home? Hey, why didn't you answer me when I called you?",
        "Parker: I was just reading this note that Mom left for me. \"Parker, no cookies before dinner. Run the dishwasher. Take out the trash. Love you. P.S., microwave the casserole for four minutes.\"",
        "Jack: Well, since you already cracked open the cookies, it's good that you're following her instructions to the tee.",
        "Parker: I just didn't want some stupid casserole.",
        "Jack: Son, I know you're upset. You heard that Janet and I were seeing each other. And maybe -- maybe you're not ready for me to see someone new.",
        "Parker: Does it matter if I'm ready for that? That's what I thought.",
        "Jack: Parker -- hey, would you stop, please? Sit down. Let's talk about this now, okay? You and your brother and your sister -- you will always, always, always be my number-one priority. What's happening with Janet -- it's -- it's not that big a deal.",
        "Parker: How can you say that, after you caught me with Liberty and laid into me when all we did was kiss?",
        "Jack: Time-out! I did not lay into you!",
        "Parker: Oh, you gave me this entire lecture about how important it is to make sure that the girl wants to be kissed and how important all that stuff is!",
        "Jack: Okay, what's happening with you and Liberty is vastly different.",
        "Parker: That's right. Because kissing someone is much less of a big deal than having sex with someone. At least it should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, I told you that I wasn't in the mood for a party.",
        "Lily: So you decided to get drunk and insult our guests?",
        "Holden: I am not drunk! Not even close. You know what? That guy is a big phony.",
        "Lily: He was just trying to make polite conversation.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on! He's bragging about his polo ponies in Argentina. Who talks like that?",
        "Lily: I was the one that asked him about his ranch. [Lily scoffs] Why are you so angry at Neal? I mean, what has he ever done, except express a romantic interest in Carly? That's -- that's it, isn't it? This is about Carly.",
        "Holden: I'm just in a bad mood. That's all.",
        "Lily: You don't want Carly to be with Neal. Why? You know, I -- I still think this is misplaced loyalty to Jack. The man reminds Jack of Simon, so naturally, it falls to Cousin Holden to insult him over canap\u00e9s.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I was out of line.",
        "Lily: Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Neal and Carly.",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Lily: Are you okay, or -- or do I need to drive you?",
        "Holden: I'm not gonna do it now.",
        "Lily: Did you see her face? You embarrassed her.",
        "Holden: And you.",
        "Lily: So make it right.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: One of the servers is gonna bring us something to eat. It won't be lamb. It's better than nothing. You must be starving.",
        "Neal: I didn't even have time to sample an appetizer before your friend Holden started in. Is he always so hotheaded?",
        "Carly: I -- I think he has a lot on his mind.",
        "Neal: It seemed a bit more specific than that -- more like he was hostile to the idea of you going out with me.",
        "Carly: This is a small town. I -- I guess people here think they have a stake in everyone else's life.",
        "Neal: Must be tedious -- rather like living your life in a petri dish.",
        "[Neal laughs]",
        "Carly: You know, two of my kids got to go away to camp this summer, and when I'm not missing them, I'm envying them.",
        "Neal: So you're longing for mosquito bites and poison ivy?",
        "Carly: Adventure maybe. I'd like to get away. Montana, maybe. Just leave.",
        "Neal: But you have your other son to worry about.",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't think he'd mind some time alone with his father, really.",
        "Neal: And then there's your business.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, I have a friend, Henry, and sometimes he looks after the place for me. But I'm -- I'm really just daydreaming.",
        "Neal: Listen, I'm all for the idea of taking time for yourself, but you might want to reconsider your destination.",
        "Carly: What's wrong with Montana?",
        "Neal: Thought you might prefer a few weeks in Paris with me.",
        "Neal: I can see I've taken you by surprise.",
        "Carly: I can't go to Paris with you.",
        "Neal: Then why don't we take a virtual trip first, just to test the waters?",
        "Carly: How do we do that?",
        "Neal: First of all, you close your eyes.",
        "Carly: And I prefer traveling with both eyes open -- and both your hands in plain sight.",
        "Neal: Wise as well as lovely. I've got some business to attend to, so I'll be busy most of the time.",
        "Carly: And what would I be doing?",
        "Neal: Visiting museums, sauntering the boulevards.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Neal: Shopping, relaxing.",
        "Carly: Where, and with whom?",
        "Neal: In my flat, with your own private room -- and alone, if you like.",
        "Carly: And what about what you like?",
        "Neal: I just want to see you happy. No stress, no pressure. Whatever happens between us happens, or not.",
        "Carly: And how many other women have you invited to Paris this way?",
        "Neal: Touch\u00e9. Admittedly, this is not my first such liaison.",
        "Carly: And how does it normally work out for you?",
        "Neal: Well, within the course of a few weeks, we either find ourselves becoming lovers, or parting as friends, or simply we just part.",
        "Carly: Well, I thank you for the offer. I really do. But --",
        "Neal: Carly, let yourself think about it. Take me out of the equation for one moment and let yourself think about Paris -- incomparable art, exquisite food, wine, fashion. All you have to do is say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, you're right. Uh, maybe I didn't say it right before. Okay. What -- of course what happens with Janet and me matters. She matters.",
        "Parker: Are you in love with her?",
        "Jack: I like her, and she likes me, and we're both on the same page about what we expect from each other. And we're acting responsibly so nobody gets hurt.",
        "Parker: Are you gonna marry her?",
        "Jack: No. No, Buddy. I respect her, but neither one of us are looking to get married, okay?",
        "Parker: Maybe okay for you.",
        "Jack: But not for you?",
        "Parker: Okay. What happens when you break up with Janet, like you did with Katie and you did with Mom? What happens to me and Liberty?",
        "Jack: You and Liberty -- if you like each other, then you guys will be fine. Listen, at your age, things change so fast. In a few weeks, you guys might not even be talking.",
        "Parker: I am so sick about hearing about how things are at my age. I just want to be older so I can actually start living my life.",
        "Jack: Okay, just -- just time-out with getting older, okay? Let me take care of you for a while. At least let me warm up the casserole.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and you can take out the trash, too.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Don't press your luck. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hello.",
        "Janet: Oh, great. Are you guys mad at me, too?",
        "Brad: No, of course not. Katie and I were just talking about how great, uh, it's been for you to stick around and, um --",
        "Katie: Well, you've totally helped everyone out -- you know, helping Liberty with the transition.",
        "Janet: Oh, wow. Thank you. Thanks. I just -- I was afraid, 'cause after, you know, what happened with Jack and -- well, great! Oh, that's great! Do you guys want some coffee or some pie or anything? Can I get you something -- you know, a sandwich?",
        "Brad: What -- okay, what I was trying to say -- what we were trying to say is that now that Liberty is all settled now, maybe, you know, you might want to get on with your own life.",
        "Janet: I am. I am, and it's so fun. I'm enjoying myself -- a lot! And this doesn't look good. All right, this is not good. This is the part where you tell me that you want me to give you a kidney or something, right?",
        "Katie: Uh, no. We just think that --",
        "Brad: It's me. It's me, okay? This is what I think -- you need to give Liberty some space, give her a chance to be a family with Katie and me, just for a little while.",
        "Janet: Is this Brad I threw myself at Bradley?",
        "Katie: No, no. It has nothing to do with that.",
        "Janet: It is Jack. It's Jack.",
        "Brad: It's not good.",
        "Janet: It's because I'm sleeping with Jack.",
        "Brad: It's not good.",
        "Janet: Who cares? It's just sex!",
        "Brad: Exactly.",
        "Janet: So what are you saying? You're saying that maybe if I had a ring on my finger and -- and there was a future between us, with a house and puppies and everything, it would be okay for us to have sex whenever we wanted?",
        "Brad: You got to set a good example. She's your daughter. I mean --",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Now, all of the sudden, I'm not good enough for my daughter? I'm a bad influence?",
        "Brad: No, no, no! I -- I did not say that!",
        "Janet: I raised her on my own, by myself! And now I'm a bad influence. Wow. Does Liberty know about this?",
        "Katie: We have not said a word to anyone.",
        "Brad: You should tell her your own way.",
        "Janet: Gee, thanks. What if I don't want to go?",
        "Brad: You can do what you want. But I can't pay for your room at the Lakeview anymore.",
        "Janet: Okay. I see how it is. You want me gone? I'm gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Janet: Hi, Libby-loo. Hey, it's your mom. [Voice breaking] Um, I really need to talk to you about something, so can you call me when you get a chance, please? Thanks.",
        "Liberty: Oh, hey.",
        "Parker: How did you get in here?",
        "Liberty: Oh, uh, well, you wouldn't talk to me, so I had to take matters into my own hands.",
        "Parker: You climb up the window? You could have broken your neck.",
        "Liberty: You care about my neck?",
        "Parker: Okay, I can't talk to you right now.",
        "Liberty: That's okay. It's okay. You don't have to talk. You really don't. I'll talk. You can just be strong and silent. Um, okay, but just so we're clear, whatever happens with our parents, you cannot break up with me.",

        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Janet: Jack, its Janet. Um, well, I was kind of hoping you weren't still mad at me.",
        "Jack: Are you crying?",
        "Janet: I'm crying, but not over you, okay? Really. And I'm not just doing a girl thing and telling you that I am not crying over you because I really am, because this time, I totally am not crying about you. Have you seen Liberty? Um, I really need to find her.",
        "Jack: No. Did you check with, uh, Brad and Katie?",
        "Janet: They were just here. They want me to leave town.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: I got to go. I got to pack.",

        "Carly: The idea of going to Paris is --",
        "Neal: What do I have to do to get you to say yes? That guy does have bloody awful timing.",
        "Holden: Sorry to interrupt. I came to apologize.",
        "Neal: You were just being honest. One can't fault you for that.",
        "Holden: Honestly, I have nothing against polo. Just been going through some things recently, and, uh, I kind of took it out on you. I embarrassed Lily and Carly in the process. I hope you can accept my apology.",
        "Neal: Consider it done.",
        "Carly: Neal, I -- I think you have a phone call to make.",
        "Neal: Splendid. I'll be right back.",
        "Holden: What's he so happy about?",
        "Carly: What you did today, the way you acted -- that can never happen again.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I just can't help it. And this guy -- not right for you.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm going to Paris with him for a couple of weeks.",
        "Holden: You don't even know him. Why are you doing this?",
        "Carly: Because of what you just said, that you couldn't help the way you were acting! Well, I care too much about you to risk that happening again. So maybe with some time --",
        "Neal: Is there a problem?",
        "Holden: No, no. No problem at all. Hey, have a good time in Paris.",
        "Neal: Poor man. One would almost think he was jealous.",
        "Carly: Holden's not jealous. He's -- he's related to my ex-husband, so --",
        "Neal: I see. That explains the territorial vibe that was literally steaming off him.",
        "Carly: Snyder men can be possessive.",
        "Neal: Then let's not give him a chance to change your mind. I've called my secretary. She's organizing the flights and preparing the flat in Paris. I am delighted you decided to join me.",
        "Carly: Me, too. Paris is just what I need right now.",
        "Neal: Excellent.",

        "Lily: How did it go?",
        "Holden: That was a wasted trip.",
        "Lily: Why? Neal didn't accept your apology?",
        "Holden: Yeah, he went through the motions. He's going to Paris, with Carly.",
        "Lily: Paris? That's wonderful! Wow! She must really like him. Oh, I'm so happy for Carly. Aren't you? What is wrong with you?",
        "Holden: You know what? It's just -- it's just been a God-awful day. Can we just not talk about it anymore?",
        "Lily: All right. Whatever you want. What is it?",
        "Holden: This. This is what I want.",

        "Liberty: Hey, our -- our stupid parents are dysfunctional. That's a given, okay? But what your dad does with my mom should have nothing to do with us being together or not.",
        "Parker: What does it have to do with?",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Parker: Why are we together?",

        "Katie: She does seem so oblivious most of the time. I wasn't expecting her to get so upset.",
        "Brad: But, I mean, it was the right thing to do, right? I mean, her not being -- that's a good thing for Liberty, right? Yeah.",
        "Katie: Right. And she's probably sick of living here anyway. I mean, it's Oakdale, and she probably has friends at home.",
        "Brad: The thing with Jack -- it was just a fling.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: I mean, no -- no love lost there.",
        "Katie: Exactly. She can move on with her life someplace else.",

        "Katie: Amen.",
        "Brad: Amen.",

        "Jack: That's why Brad and Katie think you're a bad influence -- because of the two of us?",
        "Janet: I think that is the real reason that Brad was mad.",
        "Jack: It's ridiculous! Janet, come on! You don't have to leave town because Brad says you have to.",
        "Janet: Well, he's not gonna pay my bill here anymore, and there's no place else I can go that's decent that I can afford! I need a place that's safe for Liberty to come and hang out with me. My God. How can I leave Liberty?",
        "Jack: You don't have to. Janet, come home with me to the apartment.",
