        "Emily: Okay, ladies. Do we remember why we're here?",
        "Susan: To plan Alison's wedding.",
        "Emily: Okay. And what are we not gonna do?",
        "Susan: Have any fun because Kim is meeting us here, too.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Alison: Oh, hi, we're over here!",
        "Susan: Speak of the devil.",
        "Emily: She's with someone. Who is that? Hi, Kim.",
        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Alison: I'm really glad that we could all do this today.",
        "Kim: I am, too. And I've brought a surprise guest for you. Tiffany Gable, I'd like you to meet --",
        "Tiffany: Oh, don't tell me. Mother of the bride?",
        "Susan: Susan Stewart.",
        "Tiffany: Nice to meet you. Which means one of you must be the bride. Let's see, now. No hints, now.",
        "Chris: Hi, Mom.",
        "Kim: Oh, hi, honey. The groom-to-be.",
        "Chris: Yes. Chris Hughes.",
        "Tiffany: Nice to meet you.",
        "Chris: Nice to meet you.",
        "Tiffany: And that means you must be the bride. This is going to be the most magical time of your --",
        "Alison: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on a minute. She's not the bride. I am.",
        "Tiffany: Oh! I'm so sorry! Usually my radar is perfect on these kinds of things.",
        "Alison: Alison.",
        "Tiffany: Nice to meet you. I should have known by that telltale glow.",
        "Kim: Now that we've all introduced ourselves, why don't we start planning the wedding?",
        "Chris: Mother, I would love to stay, but I just came by to say hi.",
        "Alison: Are you sure that you just can't stay to help?",
        "Chris: No, I have to -- run some errands and get back to the hospital. But whatever you decide, I'm behind you 1000%.",
        "Emily: Actually, you know what? I just forgot something. I left something in my car. I'll be right back. Excuse me.",
        "Tiffany: Well, it's just such a shame he had to leave. I could have used his input.",
        "Kim: I should explain. Tiffany is a professional wedding planner. And I thought maybe you'd think it would be fun to have a chance to talk to her.",
        "Susan: Oh, well, that's very nice. But we've got it all under control.",
        "Chris: Fresh off the City Times loading dock. My dad already took a look at the clue, but if I'm going to help Alison find another key, I need your help.",
        "Emily: I'm in the middle of planning your wedding, Chris.",
        "Chris: So get out of it.",
        "Emily: How?",
        "Chris: You'll think of something.",
        "Emily: I'll think of something.",

        "Nikki: I promised I would get Donovan to turn himself in, and I will.",
        "Agent Fox: Your time is up.",
        "Nikki: But you gave me 12 hours.",
        "Agent Fox: And so far you've come up with nothing!",
        "Nikki: I talked with Donovan. He swore he would turn state's evidence against Starziak.",
        "Agent Fox: Yeah? So where the hell is he?",
        "Nikki: I wish I knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Waitress: Oh, you mean Donny.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Donny. You know him?",
        "Waitress: Yeah, he comes in here every now and then.",
        "Dusty: Can you narrow that down for me a little?",
        "Waitress: Well, it's mostly when his brother's tending bar.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh. I need to talk to Donny about life and death stuff, you know? This is my number. Call me as soon as he comes in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Don: Now, I know that a million bucks might sound like a lot of money to most people. But you oughta consider it a bargain. Now, you're either there with the money, or your little girl finds out what kind of a creep her daddy really is.",
        "Craig: I have what you want.",
        "Don: Good. Let's do this. And Montgomery? Don't be late.",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Craig: Lil, sorry to bother you.",
        "Lily: No bother. What's up?",
        "Craig: Well, I was about to jump in the shower, and well, there's not a towel to be had.",
        "Lily: Yesterday was laundry day. They must've just forgotten to restock.",
        "Craig: Well, I'd come over if I weren't already in my birthday suit.",
        "Lily: Hold that thought. I'll be right there. I'll bring the towels. Okay.",
        "Craig: Thanks. Do or die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So?",
        "Emily: So what?",
        "Alison: So what were you and my fianc\u00e9 talking about?",
        "Emily: It is a secret, Alison.",
        "Kim: Well, anyway, as I was saying, I was so happy that Tiffany had the time to share with us, Ali. Just have fun. Ask questions, and take advantage of her expertise.",
        "Tiffany: Oh, yes, because weddings today can be so complicated. So having a wedding planner just takes all the pressure off.",
        "Susan: No offense, Ms. Gable, but my daughters and I are perfectly capable of handling all the details all by ourselves. Aren't we, girls?",
        "Emily: Uh, yeah. But actually, you know what? I have this thing that I forgot about.",
        "Susan: What thing?",
        "Emily: Well, Daniel. I forgot I have to pick up Daniel for a play date. So I have to go. Bye!",
        "Alison: Emily!",
        "Tiffany: Well, shall we continue?",
        "Susan: Ms. Gable, excuse me, but if I had wanted to hire a wedding planner, I would have hired a wedding planner, because I am paying for the wedding.",
        "Kim: No, no, Susan. This is our gift to Ali.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and it wouldn't hurt to hear what Tiffany has to say, would it? And you know, I'm really curious. When you meet a new client, how do you get started?",
        "Tiffany: Well, the first thing I do, Alison, is I ask the bride-to-be to close her eyes. Do you wanna try it? Go ahead. Okay. Now, I want you to visualize your wedding from beginning to end. Envision where you'd like to say your vows, what time of year it is, how formal you'd like your wedding to be. What sort of colors your bridal party will be wearing. Just don't think about price or what is or isn't possible. Alison, I want to start with your dreams and make those dreams come true.",
        "Susan: That's the most expensive smile I've ever seen in my life.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: Sorry. Hello?",
        "Aaron: Hey, can you talk?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Aaron: All right, look. I found Nancy Hughes. We got the newspaper in front of us, and we're working on the next clue. All we need is you, so hurry up and get to the Groves Country Club now.",
        "Alison: I'm having really bad reception. I'll be right back. Sorry.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I'm supposed to be planning my wedding.",
        "Aaron: Alison, we have one key, we need five more. Do you want to win this or not?",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll meet you there in a few. But who's going to keep Kim and my Mom from killing each other?",

        "Lily: Oh, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Hey, I just looking for my father.",

        "Lucy: Okay. Oh, is Natalie awake?",
        "Lily: She's actually in the living room, and she'd love to see you. And the sitter's in the kitchen if you need anything, okay?",
        "Lucy: Great. Hey, it's me again. You're still not picking up your phone. I'm gettin' kinda worried. I'm at Lily's house, in case you're wondering. Call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: What do you think you're doing? Get back to work.",
        "Don: Brother, I've been waiting for a payday like this my whole life. I'll see you. All right. Hey, darling, what's the damage here?",
        "Waitress: You're not leaving already?",
        "Don: Places to be, babe.",
        "Waitress: Oh, one more beer, on the house.",

        "Waitress: Don, you're breaking my heart!",
        "Don: Darling, I gotta go.",
        "Waitress: Well, I'm off in an hour. I'll go, too.",
        "Don: I wish I could swing it, but you know what? This time, I just can't do it. Keep the change.",
        "Waitress: All right.",

        "Bodyguard: Is everything all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I just have -- I have to get my bag out of the limo. I left it.",
        "Bodyguard: I'll go.",
        "Lucy: No, it's okay. I can do it real quick.",
        "Bodyguard: Stay here, don't let anybody inside.",
        "Lucy: Dusty!",
        "Dusty: What's with all the phone calls?",
        "Lucy: Well, I just wanted to hear your voice. But I mean -- you know, I was worried about you, and I just wanted to see if I could do anything to help.",
        "Dusty: I appreciate your concern, but you gotta cool it with that. You're gumming up the works, you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Craig? Craig?",
        "Craig: Home. Home on the range.",
        "Lily: I brought you some fresh towels. Lucy's up at the house.",
        "Craig: Where the deer and the la-da-da play where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Show time.",
        "Don: Okay, Montgomery. It's time to pay the piper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: That was the hospital. They're short-staffed, you know, since Katie left, and they need me.",
        "Kim: Oh. Ali, well, can't you share a little more time with us? Tiffany has cleared her schedule, I have --",
        "Susan: We all have busy schedules.",
        "Kim: Exactly. I mean, it's hard enough planning a wedding without the bride.",
        "Susan: Or the groom.",
        "Tiffany: Oh, but don't worry. I have done it dozens of times, and let me tell you --",
        "Alison: I really wish that I could stay, but I really have to go. Just -- try, everybody. Be nice! I'm sorry! Sorry!",
        "Susan: Well, this is a big waste of time without the bride or the groom.",
        "Tiffany: Oh, no, no! A wedding is so much more than just a marriage between a man and a woman. It's a marriage between two families. You know, I like to think of it as a lifetime commitment between the two sets of parents, if you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Kim daydreaming.]",
        "Minister: Bob and Kim, will you take Susan to be your lawfully-wedded wife for as long as you all shall live?",
        "Bob: You'd better believe it, baby!",
        "Kim: Oh, Bob!",
        "Bob: Sorry, dear, but it's what I've wanted all my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tiffany: Now, here's something the mothers can do without the kids. Have you thought about drawing up a tentative guest list, Susan?",
        "Susan: I haven't even started to think about guests.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, actually, I did kind of make out a tentative list.",
        "Tiffany: Good.",
        "Kim: Susan, I have a feeling that a lot of these people are the same people that you would want to invite.",
        "Susan: 258 guests?",
        "Kim: Is that too many?",
        "[Susan daydreaming.]",
        "Susan: 258 guests?! You selfish, arrogant witch! You know what you can do with this list?! You can take it and \u0096",

        "Susan: That'll be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I know its last minute and everything, but my dad and I, we think we figured out where the next key is hidden.",
        "Emily: Where?",
        "Chris: Right here.",
        "Emily: Okay, what's the next clue?",
        "Chris: \"Near the hub of the city's plan, where the basin one can scan.\"",
        "Emily: I see, the Lakeview is the center of town. \"Scanning the basin\" -- viewing the lake.",
        "Chris: Which is what brought me here. It's the next part of the clue that's a little murky.",
        "Emily: Okay, what is it? Bring it on.",
        "Chris: Okay. \"The lion tamer's saint will point the way to a grotto damp where stones give way.\"",
        "Emily: Lion tamer?",
        "Chris: Any idea?",
        "Emily: Lion tamer. I mean, other than the obvious lion tamer. But -- oh, I have an idea! Oh, do I have an idea! I love this thing. This is my super duper, trusty windows to the world. Okay, hang on here. What is a \"lion tamer\"?",
        "Chris: He's a guy with a whip, knee-high leather boots.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Chris: Part sadist, part heart of gold? I'm just thinking out loud.",
        "Emily: You're not helping me by thinking out loud. Okay, a lion tamer is a circus performer, right? I mean, maybe there's a patron saint of circus performers, right? Hang on, hang on.",
        "Chris: Anything?",
        "Emily: Bingo.",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Emily: St. Julien. French saint from the medieval period. Patron saint of hotel workers, travelers, and circus performers! Oh, am I good or what?",
        "Chris: I knew you were good. I didn't know you were a genius.",
        "Emily: Well, there's a lot you don't know about me, Dr. Hughes.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I'm beginning to realize that. Wait, isn't there a wine named \"St. Julien\"?",
        "Emily: The Bordeaux. St. Julien is a Bordeaux. This is about wine.",
        "Chris: Okay, well, let's find a waiter.",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Chris: I was gonna order a bottle. Maybe there's a clue on the label or something.",
        "Emily: Well, that's a great idea, but I don't see a waiter anywhere, do you?",
        "Chris: No, but I see what everyone else in here is ordering.",
        "Emily: Great. Looks like the rest of the world had the same great idea we did.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, we'd better be faster with the next part of the clue.",
        "Emily: All right. Well, let's get on it, Einstein.",

        "Nikki: Thanks for sticking up for me.",
        "Hal: Part of the job.",
        "Nikki: Being a cop or being a dad?",
        "Hal: Hey, I wouldn't have done it if I didn't believe in you. And don't you stop believing in yourself. Remember, you're a Munson, okay?",
        "Nikki: Okay.",
        "Hal: You made a deal with Donovan. Was it logical? No. Textbook resolution? Far from it. But you believed him, Nikki. Why?",
        "Nikki: Because I followed my instincts.",
        "Hal: Fox gave you 12 hours to bring him in and resolve the case.",
        "Nikki: My time isn't up yet.",
        "Hal: Maybe your instincts were right.",

        "Lucy: I'm gumming up the works, because I'm worried about you and I care enough to call?",
        "Dusty: I'm waiting for a phone call.",
        "Lucy: From whom?",
        "Dusty: A girl, a waitress. Why am I explaining to you? A girl's gonna tell me where Creel is so all this can be over.",
        "Lucy: I'll be safe, and you'll go free?",
        "Dusty: I just need to keep my phone line free, all right?",
        "Lucy: Well, don't you think you should at least let Nikki Munson know that you're expecting this call?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna let Munson know after I see Creel. I wanna spend some quality alone time with him first.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Dusty: So I can find out who hired him to kidnap you, silly.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but you don't even know if he's gonna --",

        "Waitress: Donny Creel was here, but he took off. I followed him into a building across the street.",
        "Dusty: Where is he now?",
        "Waitress: The elevator went all the way up to the top floor, but he hasn't come out yet.",
        "Dusty: Good work.",
        "Waitress: Be careful. He has a gun.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for the heads-up.",

        "Craig: Oh, heck. I got wiped out in a divorce.",
        "Don: Cry me a river. I asked you for a lot of cash, and this is all you bring me -- a quarter of what I asked?",

        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no. No, no. I want to win!",
        "Aaron: Then what are we doing? Let's go! Come on, let's go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: You know something, this St. Julien Bordeaux is just the most popular wine today.",
        "Emily: You don't say.",
        "Lisa: Yeah. Yeah, I'm having trouble keeping it on the shelf. In fact, this is practically the last bottle in the cellar. So enjoy.",
        "Chris: Thank you, Lisa.",
        "Emily: You thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Chris: \"The lion tamer's saint will point the way to a grotto damp where stones give way.\" A \"grotto\" is another word for \"cave.\"",
        "Emily: Cave. \"Cave\" in French is pronounced ca-vay, which means wine cellar! And I'm so grateful I paid attention in French class! We gotta get down to that wine cellar!",
        "Chris: Yeah, and hope we're the first ones there.",
        "Emily: All right, let's go. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tiffany: Now, here, Susan, is a sample budget that I'd love you to look at. Now, keep in mind, this is just the basics. Okay, we're talking invitations, flowers, gowns, caterer, videographer, photographer --",
        "Susan: That's incredible.",
        "Tiffany: Uh-huh. Now, you just take a look at that. All right. Let me know what you think. I'll be right back.",
        "Susan: I hope she comes back with oxygen.",
        "Kim: Is it way off?",
        "Susan: Oh, it's pretty bad. This budget is for 100 people, and it's barely affordable. And since you're inviting the army, navy and marines, I'm gonna have to sell a kidney or something.",
        "Kim: Look, Susan, all you have to do is give me a number, and that's fine. I'll work with that. I was going by what you said the other day, that you'd saved money for this big event. So I'm sorry. I can't apologize for not being a mind reader.",
        "Susan: Especially when there are so many other things to apologize for.",
        "Kim: Bob and I would be very happy to help if this is a hardship.",
        "Susan: I didn't say it was a hardship. I just said -- forget it. Forget it.",
        "Kim: No, no, no. Say what you have on your mind. Say it.",
        "Susan: All right, all right, all right. I think you set up this meeting just to make me look bad.",

        "Lisa: I understand you ordered a bottle of our most popular Bordeaux?",
        "Nancy: I did.",
        "Lisa: Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. We are totally sold out of that. Please look over the wine list. Pick out whatever you'd like, and it will be my treat. And whatever you want, if I have to, I'll send somebody downstairs to the cellar for it.",
        "Aaron: Well, what are we supposed to do now?",
        "Nancy: I think we should investigate the cellar she just mentioned. It just occurred to me that that may be the \"damp grotto\" that this key alludes to.",
        "Alison: Okay, let's go!",
        "Nancy: Alison, if I were you, I'd go seek out Kim and Susan and find how they're faring. Find them, separate them, and make sure that neither one of says anything they'll regret.",
        "Aaron: I'm sure they're fine.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no. Nancy's right. I'm gonna go check.",
        "Susan: Yes, what is it?",
        "Alison: How is everything, Mom?",
        "Susan: Your future monster-in-law just decided to invite the entire town to your wedding. Wasn't that thoughtful of her?",
        "Kim: You're so paranoid.",
        "Susan: What did you say?",
        "Alison: Mom, promise not to say one more word. I'm gonna be right there. I gotta fly.",
        "Aaron: What about the cellar?",
        "Alison: Oh, you and Nancy go.",
        "Aaron: Nancy can be my lookout. You're my partner, Ali. I can get arrested for this!",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I have to go. If not, then Chris might realize how difficult my family is, and then he'll call off the wedding. But good luck!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hi, Grandma. Do you think I can get a tour of the wine cellar?",
        "Emily: We're in!",
        "Chris: Now, we just have to find out where the St. Julien is stored.",
        "Emily: Okay, you go down there. I'm gonna start over here.",
        "Chris: Wait a minute --",
        "Emily: What, did you find something?",
        "Chris: Yeah, it's a label.",
        "Emily: You're right. That's it, that's the St. Julien label. Now what did it say? The clue said the saint would point to the way. So what way is he pointing?",
        "Chris: Right here, right there.",
        "Emily: Well, grab it. Come on, grab it!",
        "Lisa: It's a perfectly ordinary wine cellar. Nothing special about that.",
        "Casey: I'll be the judge of that.",
        "Emily: Go, go, go!",
        "Lisa: Honestly, this contest for the keys is just -- it's ridiculous! It's turned this whole city upside down. I mean, I don't really mind. I mean, it's been a good day for me. What are you doing?",
        "Casey: I'm finding my fortune, Grandma.",

        "Tape recorder: Home -- home on the range where the deer and the da-da-da play. Where seldom is heard a discouraging word. And the skies are not cloudy or gray.",
        "Craig: What have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Tell me who did this to you. Come on, come on, try. Try. It's your last chance to do the right thing. Do the right thing. Who shot you? Who set this up? Who set it up.",
        "Don: Lucy's -- father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I don't know what Dusty's planning, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell anyone.",
        "Lily: All right, I know you two spent a lot of time together, and it's very natural for you to develop some sort of -- feelings for him.",
        "Lucy: We're friends. That's all.",
        "Lily: Really, you're friends? That's it, what I just saw there? I mean, he's a good looking-guy. He's dangerous, right?",
        "Lucy: He told me, you guys went out, right?",
        "Lily: A long time ago. He's a different person. He's changed. If you trust him or rely on him for anything, he will disappoint you, he will hurt you!",
        "Lucy: Aunt Lily, when we were hiding out, he was the only person I could depend on. He didn't just keep me safe, he kept me alive. He cared about me. If it weren't for him, I don't know what would have happened to me. Please don't tell me I can't trust him. I don't have a choice.",

        "Dusty: You're too late. He's dead.",
        "Agent Fox: I know it's been awhile, Donovan, but I hope you haven't forgotten me. Last time we saw each other, I was about to put you in handcuffs and change your life, but you bolted.",
        "Dusty: How could I forget?",
        "Agent Fox: Well, that's not going to happen again. Against the wall and spread 'em. That's a good boy. What's this?",
        "Dusty: That's protection.",
        "Agent Fox: You're saying you're not the shooter?",
        "Dusty: Creel was as good as dead by the time I got here.",
        "Agent Fox: I heard it a million times.",
        "Dusty: What's that, the truth? The truth? I didn't do it! But I know who did.",

        "Nikki: What do we do now, sir?",
        "Agent Fox: I remind Mr. Donovan he's under arrest on federal money-laundering charges.",
        "Hal: If we find out the bullet that killed Mr. Creel came from Donovan's gun, he's gonna be facing a whole lot more than money-laundering charges.",
        "Dusty: I didn't shoot anybody!",
        "Agent Fox: Dustin Donovan, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",

        "Lucy: You mean it?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Yeah, I want to do whatever you need. I want to do whatever you need. No more jumping to conclusions. I will do whatever it takes to be just the kind of father that you need. That's what I want to be. That's all I want. Huh? Come here. Come here.",

        "Agent Fox: Let's do this. Start talking.",

        "Dusty: Two guys were after Lucy. One's dead, one's still out there. That means she's still in danger.",
        "Hal: Why? Once Creel's partner finds out Creel is dead, he'll probably just beat it out of town.",
        "Dusty: Beat it out of town, huh? Well, the threat's still there, isn't it?!",
        "Nikki: What do you know, Donovan?",
        "Dusty: Before Creel died, I looked him in the eye, and I asked him, \"who set this up?\" And he said, \"Lucy's father.\" So I think it's time someone had a real long chat with Craig Montgomery.",
