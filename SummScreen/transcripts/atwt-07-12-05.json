        "Emily runs into Allison who tells her she is leaving town to move to Seattle to be with Aaron. Emily then tells Allison that her and Hal are getting divorced, and she is here with Paul. Gwen gives birth to a premature baby boy, but does not want to see it. She pushes Will away as well. An angry Will later bumps into Celia and Casey about to make their virginity pledge. He informs them that Gwen gave birth, and that she is giving the baby up for adoption. Will's resentment towards Casey is obvious, and once Celia leaves, he comes close to telling Casey the truth, but instead he accuses him of really knowing the truth. Mike and Katie are happily enjoying themselves at Metro, which Margo notices, and they are forced to admit they are back together, but they aren't telling anyone yet. Meanwhile, Jen is in need of emergency surgery due to complications. Dusty calls Mike who is happily enjoying time with Katie. He immediately feels guilty if something has happened to Jen or the baby. Craig erases the message from the lawyer about Gwen giving birth, resentful of this baby replacing his son with Jen, which he is not allowed to see. Rosanna pours out her true feelings to Paul, and it seems that Paul may reciprocate, but her cell phone rings and interrupts them. It is Craig telling her that Gwen has given birth. Rosanna wants to rush home, forcing Paul again to bitterly bury his feelings he has for her. Rosanna and Craig go to the hospital just as Gwen is signing the relinquishment papers for her son. Later, Gwen seems to have second thoughts about her baby, but upon seeing Rosanna gushing over the baby, she sneaks out of the hospital. Later, when the nurse rolls in Baby Kasnoff to the nursery, Craig is excited at his fortunate luck to have both babies' side by side in the nursery. He sinisterly looks at one nametag to another."

        "Paul: Congratulations.",
        "Rosanna: I thought you'd moved on, Paul. Is it really necessary to be so unkind?",
        "Paul: Unkind? Unkind? I'm being civil. I thought you and Craig were gonna adopt a baby, live happily ever after.",
        "Rosanna: Do I look happy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: This is Albert Parks, from Skadden, Fitzhugh, Parks. I'm not sure if this is good news or bad, Rosanna, but we need to talk. So if either you or your husband could give me a call ASAP? We need to discuss the child. It would appear that the birth mother is going into labor.",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Rosanna: I know your heart is broken. And so is mine. But do you know the only cure for a broken heart is love? And we have so much of it inside of us, it would be a sin not to share it. Especially when there's some little boy or girl out there who needs it so badly.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. I have a little boy.",
        "Rosanna: I know. I know. And if I thought there was the remotest possibility that you would be allowed to be a father to him, I would move heaven and earth to make it happen.",
        "Craig: Oh, Rosanna. Knowing my child is out there, Jennifer is keeping him from me and that there's nothing I can do about that -- nothing will make up for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Gwen, it's a boy.",
        "Gwen: And he's okay?",
        "Bob: He's premature, which impacts the baby's weight.",
        "Gwen: Yes or no.",
        "Bob: We're going to do everything we can to give him every chance. You wanna see him?",
        "Gwen: No. Just get him out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Mike: What's the matter?",
        "Katie: I have a really weird feeling. No one can see us together yet, right?",
        "Mike: Not here, no.",
        "Katie: Okay. We need to stop before someone sees us. Are you okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah. Nobody here knows we're back together.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and soon as they find out that you left Jennifer for me --",
        "Mike: No, I didn't leave Jennifer for you.",
        "Katie: So you keep saying.",
        "Mike: Hey, I'm where I want to be. With you.",
        "Katie: You sure?",
        "Mike: We're both sure. But I need to be a little discreet until I can talk to Jennifer and make sure she's found a place to live, told her family. God, I don't want to cause her any more pain than I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mike. I have to call Mike.",
        "Dusty: When we get out of here, you can call Mike.",
        "Jennifer: What's wrong? Dusty, you're scaring me.",
        "Dusty: Nothing's wrong. I'm gonna get the baby settled in the car.",
        "Jennifer: No, I wanna see him.",
        "Dusty: In the car, you'll see him.",
        "Jennifer: Wait!",
        "Dusty: Jen, the sooner we get to the hospital, the better.",
        "Jennifer: Why? There's something wrong, isn't there?",
        "Jennifer: He's my son. If there's something wrong, I have a right to know.",
        "[Faint baby gurgling]",
        "Dusty: You see? He's fine. But he's premature, which means he belongs in the hospital, all right? I'm gonna get him settled in the car. I'll be right back. Okay, I got him safe in the car. Jen! Jen!",
        "[Jen faints]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Gwen is a strong young woman. She'll recover from this physically. But emotionally? Giving up the baby is harder than she expected.",
        "Will: Well, what can I do to help her?",
        "Bob: Well, you can talk to her. I don't mean try to change her mind. I think, in this case, adoption is a good choice. You know, Will, I've always found that being able to say good-bye gives the birth mother the closure that she needs.",
        "Will: I'll talk to her.",
        "Bob: How're you doing?",
        "Will: I'm fine.",
        "Bob: You're okay with this decision? I know, I know. You told me this baby is not yours.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm okay. You okay? It really is amazing. You know, the baby. You should take a look.",
        "Gwen: I don't wanna take a look, and I don't wanna talk about it.",
        "Will: My uncle thinks you should say good-bye to him. For closure.",
        "Gwen: I don't care what your uncle says, and I don't need any closure. All I need is for them to get that kid out of here! That means you, too.",
        "Will: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Casey.",
        "Casey: Were you asleep?",
        "Celia: No. Just thinking.",
        "Casey: So -- ready to get hitched?",
        "Celia: No. I mean, it's not like we're getting married or anything. We're just saying we won't have sex till we do -- get married to whomever we get married to.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Celia: Now? I mean, here?",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Celia: I just thought we'd do it at your parents' house.",
        "Casey: Forget that. My Mom's already too happy.",
        "Celia: I'm glad she's happy.",
        "Casey: I'm glad, too. I'm just saying that this is our deal. We don't need to invite someone else into it. I mean, as far as anyone else is concerned, we're exclusive. How we deal with that is our business.",
        "Celia: You make it sound like you're embarrassed.",
        "Casey: I just want a little privacy. That's all. I mean, this is you and me here, not you, me and the world.",
        "Celia: Okay, fine. Let's do it. By ourselves.",
        "Casey: Great.",
        "Celia: Shouldn't we say something?",
        "Casey: Like what?",
        "Celia: Like maybe how important this is? That we've both decided to wait and not have sex, because we're both virgins, and we want to stay that way --",
        "Casey: Fine, ditto.",
        "Celia: That's it?",
        "Casey: Look, I'm going through with this. What more do you want?",
        "Celia: I want to know how you feel. This is a big step, Casey. If there's something you're not telling me, just --",
        "Casey: Like what?",
        "Celia: You tell me. Casey, is there something I should know?",
        "Casey: What about you? Have you told me every little thing?",
        "Celia: No. I haven't. And maybe I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mmm. Paul, you don't hurry back, you're gonna lose more than your little umbrella.",
        "Alison: What's a classy broad like you doing in a dump like this?",
        "Emily: Hey, babycakes. What're you doing here?",
        "Alison: Going away party.",
        "Emily: Anyone I know?",
        "Alison: Me.",
        "Emily: What? You? What are you talking about?",
        "Alison: Aaron called and asked me to move to Seattle.",
        "Emily: Aaron? As in \"does Aaron still love me\" Aaron?",
        "Alison: Yeah, he still loves me. He was just busy with his Mom, who's much better now, and his other job, which pays twice what Metro paid, and our new apartment, which has views of the sound.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. That's fantastic.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and he already has a job lined up for me when I get there. It's at the place that he works, a juice bar, totally healthy, with granite countertops and flowers and homemade muffins and, best of all, live music every night.",
        "Emily: Did you tell Mom about this?",
        "Alison: Not yet. But she's crazy about Aaron.",
        "Emily: Hmm. Lucky you.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? She's crazy about Hal, too.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I -- I have something to tell you. Hal and I are getting divorced. It's been a long time coming.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but he's so great. He's crazy about you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, he is. He is. But he's got a very full life, a lot going on, and there's not much room in it for me, you know. And it got a little lonely.",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Alison: So, that's why you're in a bar all by your lonesome.",
        "Emily: Uh, no. Actually, I'm here with Paul.",
        "Alison: Paul Ryan? Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do you think that Craig and I adopted this baby because -- because it's a real marriage?",
        "Paul: Instead of what it really is, which is a legal arrangement so that Craig can torture my sister? I don't know, Rosanna. That's a real lose-lose for me. I'm not sure what to say.",
        "Rosanna: Why are you so angry?",
        "Paul: Why do you think?",
        "Rosanna: You can't -- I didn't marry Craig so that I could hurt your sister. I know how important this baby is to her. You have to know that I know that.",
        "Paul: Just another casualty.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you're lucky. When you're upset, you get angry. I -- I don't. I fall apart. I thought another child might help. Craig wanted a baby. So I contacted an attorney.",
        "Paul: Which brings us back to where we started. Congratulations.",
        "Rosanna: I didn't marry Craig because I love him. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Hey, congratulations! It's a boy. Craig? Did you hear me?",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Would you like a drink?",
        "Lawyer: I left you a message.",
        "Craig: Yeah, here you are.",
        "Lawyer: I didn't hear from -- have you spoken to your wife?",
        "Craig: Well, not yet. It's not the sort of news you want to deliver over the phone.",
        "Lawyer: Craig, are you having second thoughts about this adoption?",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Craig: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Rosanna: No. You know that I want this child.",
        "Craig: No, about me.",
        "Rosanna: Not if you want this baby.",
        "Craig: If I seem preoccupied, it's just I'm concerned with the child's health. I didn't want to tell my wife too soon or get too excited myself.",
        "Lawyer: That's understandable. But rest assured -- if there are any health problems, you're not under any obligation. We've provided for all of that in the contract. Which reminds me, I need to get the relinquishment papers to Ms. Norbeck.",
        "Craig: The relinquishment papers?",
        "Lawyer: And she'll have 48 hours to sign them. When she does, the baby is all yours.",
        "Craig: Hmm.",
        "Lawyer: So, if you could tell your wife the clock is ticking.",
        "Craig: Yes, of course. Thank you for coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, none of it matters. My marriage to Craig, losing Cabot because of your father, your affair with Emily -- I love you. And I always will. But what I can't seem to understand is how -- you know, you don't seem to understand how I feel, or feel anything yourself.",
        "Paul: Wait. It's not that I don't feel anything. I feel angry.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, which is fine, and I completely understand that. I'm just hoping that, eventually, you could understand how stuck I was. That's why I did what I did. And that, eventually, you would forgive me. Life is short. If there's any chance at all that you still love me --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: You should get that.",
        "Rosanna: Yes?",
        "Craig: I just spoke with the lawyer, and Gwen went into labor earlier this evening.",
        "Rosanna: What? Well, is she okay?",
        "Craig: The baby's fine. It's a boy. He's in an incubator.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, a boy.",
        "Craig: I thought you might wanna to know.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Where are you?",
        "Craig: Home.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, I'll be right there.",
        "Paul: You have to go.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. The baby was born. It's a boy. It's premature, which means he's gonna need all kinds of special attention.",
        "Paul: With you as his mother, I'm sure he'll be fine.",
        "Rosanna: You were gonna say something --",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter now.",
        "Rosanna: I guess not. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Please don't pretend this isn't hard.",
        "Gwen: For the 18th time, I never wanted this stupid baby.",
        "Will: No. But when you got used to the idea --",
        "Gwen: I never got used to it. Throwing up, not being able to work, having everybody looking at me like I'm some pathetic victim. Getting rid of the kid is a relief.",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Gwen: What do you know? You're not the father. You're just a sad loser who likes to hang around anybody who's got a problem. Well, guess what? There's no more problem here, so you can get lost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Look, we're doing this ring thing. That's what counts, all right? We don't need to bare our souls and talk about stuff that happened a long time ago.",
        "Celia: Even if it's about another guy?",
        "Casey: What other guy?",
        "Celia: It doesn't matter who it was.",
        "Casey: But something happened?",
        "Celia: No.",
        "Casey: Well -- well, then why are you bringing it up? I mean, do you still have feelings for this guy?",
        "Celia: He's a good person. And I thought, at the time, that maybe he was the one. But then I met you, and we got together, and we're making this pledge and -- I just thought you should know.",
        "Casey: Hey, as long as he's out of the picture, then what difference does it make?",
        "Celia: He's out of the picture. What about you? What's your big secret?",
        "Casey: I don't have any secrets. Look, can we just do this? It's getting late.",
        "Celia: I know what your secret is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey could easily have been in the same position that Will's in now.",
        "Tom: Do you think a ring and a pledge is gonna keep a 17-year-old boy from having sex with his girlfriend?",
        "Margo: I hope so. I mean, at least they're talking about it, not doing it.",
        "Tom: You know, I'm all for talking about it. But I think you and I should prepare for the inevitable.",
        "Margo: The inevitable?",
        "Tom: Yeah, bottom line -- if Will had been prepared, Gwen wouldn't be pregnant.",
        "Margo: You know what I think? I think that it's Celia who's behind this whole thing. Because she's a pretty smart cookie, and I don't think she wants to end up the way Gwen did.",
        "Tom: Well, I hope you're right. But I know -- in fact, we both know that trying to deny strong feelings can backfire. We have children to prove that. I mean, look what just happened to your brother, to Jennifer.",
        "Margo: We're gonna make it really clear to Casey that we're behind this virginity thing.",
        "Tom: Okay, fine. In the meantime, his Dad's buying him backup.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God!",
        "Katie: Do you have any idea how much I missed you?",
        "Mike: Yeah, 'cause I feel the same way.",
        "Katie: All right, if we don't get outta here and go someplace more private, like, right now --",
        "Mike: Let's go.",
        "Margo: Katie?",
        "Katie: Oh, Margo, hey. Can I call you? 'Cause we were just leaving.",
        "Margo: Yeah -- Katie, I think that -- could you and I take a really long walk?",
        "Katie: Um -- we weren't gonna tell anyone yet. But Mike and I are back together.",
        "Margo: Oh. You weren't gonna tell anyone. You're practically on top of each other in public.",
        "Katie: That's why we were leaving.",
        "Margo: All right, look, I don't mean to invade your privacy. But what are you doing? Does Jennifer know about this? Mike, have you told her anything? I mean, quite frankly, hasn't she been through enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: She's been in and out of consciousness since we left the cabin.",
        "Dr. Maddux: Take the baby to NICU. Tell 'em it's premature and that the mother was injured in a fall.",
        "Jennifer: The baby -- the baby, is he okay?",
        "Dr. Maddux: That's what we're gonna find out. Mrs. Ka -- let's take her inside.",
        "Dusty: Doc, is she gonna be okay?",
        "Dr. Maddux: Just a minute. She's hemorrhaging. Call the O.R. Tell her I'm bringing her up as soon as I'm prepped.",
        "Dusty: What's wrong?",
        "Dr. Maddux: Are you the husband?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm a friend.",
        "Dr. Maddux: I suggest you find him. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Celia: Congratulations.",
        "Will: For what?",
        "Celia: You're the father.",
        "Will: Actually, I'm not.",
        "Lawyer: You'll have 48 hours to sign the papers.",
        "Mike: Jennifer had the baby.",
        "Katie: What?! Oh, my God.",
        "Mike: Man, if anything happens to that baby or Jennifer \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I thought a little bleeding was normal, you know.",
        "Dr. Maddux: This is more than a little bleeding. The likelihood is that she injured herself when she fell or during the birth.",
        "Dusty: But she'll be all right?",
        "Dr. Maddux: Once we get her into surgery.",
        "Dusty: And the baby?",
        "Dr. Maddux: Still too soon to tell.",
        "Nurse: They're ready for her in one, doctor.",
        "Dr. Maddux: Who's the anesthesiologist?",
        "Dusty: Jenny, hey. Jenny. You're gonna be okay. You're just gonna have a little surgery. The baby's fine. You hear me? Gotta be strong. Okay? Be strong.",
        "Jennifer: Get Mike. He should be here in case something happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I will be right back. What was that?",
        "Margo: That's me trying to figure out what the hell you're doing.",
        "Katie: Having a drink at a bar.",
        "Margo: Well, aren't you supposed to be on your way out of town? I mean, didn't -- what was that whole heartfelt speech about leaving your past behind? Was that just to ditch your bunny?",
        "Katie: I did leave town, Margo. I ended up in Chicago in a hotel. And guess who moves in across the hall. Mike.",
        "Margo: Right.",
        "Katie: And, besides, you were the one always saying that we were meant to be together.",
        "Margo: His wife is pregnant.",
        "Katie: With our brother's child. Obviously, Mike and Jennifer were not meant to be together. And I don't think this is gonna be easy, okay? But the point is, we finally admitted our feelings to each other.",
        "Margo: What, so now you just live happily ever after?",
        "Katie: Why are you being so negative?",
        "Margo: I am being negative. I'm being realistic. The guy's married.",
        "Katie: He was married. He ended the marriage to Jennifer before he even ran into me, Margo. And, yes, he already told Jennifer that we're back together. Obviously, she's not happy about it. But at least we were honest, and we didn't hide anything. And why you can't be happy for me?",
        "Margo: I am. I just -- oh. It's just such a mess.",
        "Katie: I know. But if they would've stayed together, we would've stayed a mess. And now at least we all get a second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I thought that you and Paul were history.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what they say about history repeating itself.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what about Rosanna? Will told me that Paul was destroyed when she left, and now that she's back --",
        "Emily: Rosanna married Craig.",
        "Alison: Again?",
        "Emily: Like I said, history tends to repeat itself.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but why Craig? He's like a criminal. And Lucy told me that she's not even coming home so she can stay away from him.",
        "Emily: Look, I don't know what to tell you. She's back in town, and she married Craig.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but -- what if you get all involved with him, and then he decides that he's still not over her, and then history repeats itself? Then what will you do?",
        "Emily: I think Paul will always have feelings for Rosanna, deep down. But he says he's moving on, so he's moving on. Hey. I was about to come look for you. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it took awhile to find that.",
        "Emily: Lost my wrap.",
        "Paul: Hi, Alison.",
        "Emily: My Alison is leaving town. I'm devastated.",
        "Paul: Oh, Will's gonna miss you a lot.",
        "Alison: I'm gonna miss him, too. He's a good guy. Too good sometimes. People take advantage of him.",
        "Paul: Well, at least he's taking responsibility, which is more than you can say about most guys his age.",
        "Alison: You're right about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: I know your secret. You don't want to do this ring ceremony. You just said you'd do it because you don't want me to get mad.",
        "Casey: You're half right. I didn't want to do it, but I went along with it because it made you happy.",
        "Celia: You must think I'm really stupid.",
        "Casey: No. I think you're amazing. Besides, I'd never push you into having sex if you weren't into it. So what's the difference? We wear the rings, and we're together. That's what counts.",
        "Celia: I'm so glad you understand. Will? What're you doing here?",
        "Will: What's going on?",
        "Celia: We were about to do our virginity pledge.",
        "Will: Virginity pledge?",
        "Casey: It's important to Celia.",
        "Will: And you'd do anything to make her happy.",
        "Casey: Can we just get outta here?",
        "Celia: What's wrong?",
        "Will: Wrong? Not much. Gwen had her baby.",
        "Celia: No, no, she couldn't have. It's too early.",
        "Will: That's what happens sometimes, when the Mom is under stress.",
        "Celia: Is she okay?",
        "Will: She'll survive.",
        "Celia: And the baby?",
        "Will: Hangin' in there.",

        "Craig: Hey.",

        "Craig: Well, I didn't wanna get your hopes up.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. Why not?",
        "Craig: Well, because the baby's premature. That's all.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I know. And he's gonna need all sorts of special care. But have you spoken to the doctor?",
        "Craig: Well, I didn't think it was appropriate.",
        "Rosanna: Appropriate?! Come on, you're the father.",
        "Craig: Not until Gwen signs the relinquishment papers. She has 48 hours to change her mind.",
        "Rosanna: Well, she's not gonna change her mind. Still -- must be killing her. I mean, giving up a child.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, she is giving up this child so that he can have a better life.",
        "Rosanna: Which is why I gave up Cabot.",
        "Craig: Well, you cannot compare your loss to a teenager who doesn't want this child.",
        "Rosanna: Why are you being so negative?",
        "Craig: I'm -- I'm being cautious. Until we know about this baby's health, I don't wanna get your hopes up, not after everything you've been through. You know?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we can't just sit here and wait.",
        "Craig: The lawyer will keep us apprised.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe we should just go over there and make sure that she's all right.",
        "Craig: Not now -- Gwen wanted to keep the identity of the adoptive parents secret.",
        "Rosanna: We'll just, you know, pop by, just for a minute.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: And if we happen to pass by the nursery?",
        "Rosanna: We'll just sneak a little peak at it. Come on, he's our son. Will you come with me, please?",
        "Craig: Well, I'm the father, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What do you mean you're not the father?",
        "Will: Gwen's giving the baby up for adoption.",
        "Celia: Are you okay with that?",
        "Will: I'm worried about Gwen. She says she's fine, but I don't believe her. She wouldn't even look at the baby. She kept yelling at the nurses to take it away.",
        "Celia: That's terrible. I'll go see her.",
        "Will: I don't think she's really up for company, Celia.",
        "Celia: Then we'll go see her in the morning. Maybe we can take her home.",

        "Casey: Let me take you home.",
        "Celia: I've got Sierra's car.",

        "Celia: We can do it later. It's late.",

        "Rosanna: None of it matters. My marriage to Craig, losing Cabot because of your father, your affair with Emily -- I love you. And I always will.",
        "Emily: I am gonna miss her so much.",
        "Paul: Alison. Yeah, she's a great kid.",
        "Emily: You okay?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was thinking about Will. He's got a big crush on her.",
        "Emily: What is it with the men in your family and the women in mine, huh? And you know what? It's not that big of a deal. Seattle's not that far away. Will can go visit.",
        "Paul: It's not like he's going on a vacation anytime soon.",
        "Emily: Why, because of that girl he's involved with?",

        "Rosanna: Oh, sorry! We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.",
        "Lawyer: Rosanna, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed adoption, at the mother's request. That's why I gave Craig the news at home and why the baby's listed only as \"baby boy doe\" in the nursery.",
        "Craig: Well, my wife was concerned. She wanted to make sure the girl was all right.",
        "Gwen: Girl's fine. So is the baby, according to the doctors.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's great. I'm so glad to hear it. If there's anything at all that you need --",
        "Lawyer: I'll let you know. As I was saying, you'll have 48 hours to sign the papers.",
        "Gwen: I'm not gonna change my mind.",
        "Lawyer: Well, that's, of course, up to you.",

        "Mike: You didn't do anything.",
        "Katie: I know, and she's happy for us. She's just worried about Jen. Maybe you should call her and see how she's doing.",

        "Mike: What? When? Where?",
        "Dusty: We're at the hospital, the neonatal unit. So you're going to want to come down here. It doesn't look good.",
