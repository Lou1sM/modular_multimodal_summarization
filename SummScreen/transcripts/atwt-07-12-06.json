        "Casey: Maddie, wait, don't run.",
        "Maddie: Let me go. Please!",
        "Casey: No! Look, I don't know what you're running from, but you, me and your cop friend here are gonna get to the bottom of it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Susan.",
        "Susan: Hi, Tom.",
        "Tom: Emily around?",
        "Susan: No, I was just dropping off the books she asked for.",
        "Tom: So, is she in, what, the day room? Or with her doctor?",
        "Susan: No, actually she's at church. Hal arranged for her to go to Jennifer's memorial service.",
        "Tom: Oh, that's right.",
        "Susan: She was Jennifer's stepmother for a while. And they were very, very close. And then when Johnny got sick, Emily donated the stem cells.",
        "Tom: That was a very generous thing to do but this still can't wait.",
        "Susan: Whatever it is, I can deliver the message. What? You're making me nervous.",
        "Tom: Look, I don't mean to worry you, Susan but that is why I'm here. I want this transition to be as comfortable as possible.",
        "Susan: What transition?",
        "Tom: The hearing is tomorrow.",
        "Susan: I know. She said you dropped the subpoena off last night. And she spoke with her doctors this morning before she left.",
        "Tom: Okay, then don't you think you should be making arrangements?",
        "Susan: For what?",
        "Tom: In order for Emily to attend this hearing, she needs to be transferred to Oakdale jail. And from there, depending on the judge's ruling, she'll either be placed in prison or a secure mental health facility. So, either way, she won't be coming back here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Thank you, Gwen. Sometimes music expresses our sadness much better than words. It's so hard to accept the passing of a beloved wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend. But let's not forget our faith which rests on the belief that the spirit is not conquered by death. Jennifer's spirit will live on in her family, her friends and everyone she loved.",
        "Kim: I'm worried about Dusty. Where do you suppose he went?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: I just wanted to pay my respects.",
        "Dusty: You're not going in there.",
        "Lucy: No, of course not. I was waiting until the service was over. Hoping to see you and maybe -- I don't know -- see if there was anything I could do.",
        "Dusty: No, you've done enough.",
        "Lucy: I know you. And I know how you are when you love someone. And how hard it is for you to put all those feelings you have into words. And I just wanted you to know that somebody understands.",
        "Dusty: The only person who understands me is gone.",
        "Lucy: I know. Dusty, we were friends -- even before I went to school, we were still friends. And I just felt so badly about what happened I wanted to come by as a friend.",
        "Dusty: If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not getting it here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Thank you for joining me in a celebration of Jennifer Munson Donovan's life. Her mother's asked me to please extend an invitation to all of you to join her for a reception at her home immediately following the service.",
        "Paul: I don't think that means us.",
        "Minister: Go in peace, as Jennifer would have wanted.",
        "Paul: I can't take any more of this.",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "Paul: Nows not the time, Emily.",
        "Emily: I'm on a pretty short leash here. I can't exactly pick my moments.",
        "Paul: What do you want?",
        "Emily: I heard what you said about raising the baby.",
        "Paul: It's nothing I haven't said to you before.",
        "Emily: No, but I just -- I thought that after we talked maybe --",
        "Paul: Oh, so, that's what this is, huh? The noble Emily, sacrificing everything to save a dying child.",
        "Emily: That's not what I was doing.",
        "Paul: You didn't want my sister to go to bat for you?",
        "Emily: Of course I wanted her support and I had it. She understood --",
        "Paul: She was grateful, yes, and you used that. But she's gone now, Emily, and it's just you and me. And I know what you're up to and you're not gonna get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Why are you persecuting her?",
        "Tom: So, this is my fault?",
        "Susan: You're the district attorney. You have discretion in these matters.",
        "Tom: And this was a felony. Dusty has given me no indication that he's changed his mind about pressing charges. This is out of my hands.",
        "Susan: Well, isn't that convenient.",
        "Tom: So, you think this is easy for me? My son Daniel's mother winds up in prison or a psychiatric ward. God knows if he'll even meet his half brother when he's born. Yes, this is a situation no matter how you look at it, but you better face the facts. Your daughter brought this on herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Casey, look, I know you have a lot of questions. And you blame me for causing trouble between you and Maddie --",
        "Casey: Everything was fine before you got here. Now she won't even talk to me and her brother said that she's leaving town.",
        "Dallas: Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But if Maddie feels as though she needs to leave town for a while, maybe we ought to leave her alone. At least that's what I'm gonna do. Excuse me.",
        "Casey: Is that how you feel? Like I'm constantly pressuring you?",
        "Maddie: You don't mean to, I know you don't, I just -- I can't really talk about it.",
        "Casey: Not even to me? No way. How about this -- I won't even react. I won't even say anything. Just, can you tell me what's going on?",
        "Maddie: Okay. Casey I still think that we could work this out. I mean, my feelings haven't changed. But I'm tired of trying to convince you. I just want to know what happened.",
        "Maddie: My feelings haven't changed, it's -- I know this is so unfair to you. I just -- I've never felt like this before. Like I couldn't control what was going on.",
        "Casey: With us?",
        "Maddie: No. No, with me. Everything was fine, like you said. It was great and then -- we got closer and I don't know. I just -- I froze.",
        "Casey: Because of Dallas Griffin?",
        "Maddie: Sort of. He just -- he reminded me of something that I don't really want to think about.",
        "Casey: Did you guys have a relationship?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Casey: But something happened. I mean -- he wanted something from you.",
        "Maddie: In a way -- but it's anything what you think. Really, it has really nothing to do with him. It's me. It's something -- it's just -- it's something inside of me. And until I can control it or get rid of it, I can't be with anybody. I'm sorry. And it's -- listen to me Casey, it has thing too with you or my life here. It doesn't. It's -- it's just old stuff coming back from the past. I have these flashes, these bad memories, whenever I'm with you. And it -- and it has nothing to do with you. It has nothing to do with you, I swear.",
        "Casey: So then let's just cool it then, all right? You know, maybe we were trying too hard to get close. It was too fast for you.",
        "Maddie: I wanted to, I really did.",
        "Casey: So we'll start over then. You know, go back to how it was in the beginning.",
        "Maddie: You hated me in the beginning.",
        "Casey: But now we're friends. So we need concentrate on having fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Please, please, please -- I'm begging you. This is the last chance I get to talk to you before the hearing tomorrow. All I'm asking for is a little consideration, Paul. This is my child, too. I just want to be part of his life. Why is that so much to ask?",
        "Paul: You're going to jail for the rest of your life.",
        "Emily: No, you don't know that. You don't know that.",
        "Paul: You've admitted your guilt -- why are we even having this conversation?",
        "Emily: Because you are using my legal situation to take away my child. And that's not fair. It's not fair to me and it's not fair to this child.",
        "Paul: So what do you want? You want me to bring the kid to visit you so you can wave at him behind bars? You want me to parade his kindergarten class on the other side of the barbed wire? You want me to give a mug shot of you, shots of you in lock up so he can bring them to show and tell?",
        "Emily: Of course not.",
        "Paul: Good. Then we're on the same page.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: They say these things, these memorials are supposed to -- I don't know, put a lid on things. Closure, that's the word. Well, I don't feel like anything's closed. I feel like my heart has a hole in it that will never ever mend.",
        "Margo: Hal, she was your little girl. How else are you supposed to feel?",
        "Hal: Keep your children very close. That's the message here. What's this?",
        "Margo: It's from Adam. He overnighted it to me, he wanted me to give that to you. He really wanted to be here, but this all happened so quickly and he's so far away, and he wouldn't have made the service, but -- he's thinking about you, Hal. He's worried about his dad.",
        "Carly: Tough day, huh? We're all gonna miss her.",
        "Parker: I miss you, Mom. I have fun at Dad's, but I just want to come home. It's so sad there.",
        "Jack: You could talk to him.",
        "Carly: No, not today.",
        "Jack: And I think he's about ready to head out.",
        "Carly: Why don't we go say hello your dad.",
        "Hal: Well, there he is. How are you holding up?",
        "Parker: Okay. How are you?",
        "Hal: I'm just so grateful that I've have you. And I'm sure your mom feels the same way. I'm sure she's misses having you at home.",
        "Carly: You have no idea how much.",
        "Hal: I think I do. And I think maybe it's time that we talked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I would never want to put my child in an awkward position. But the child needs to know that I exist, that I care.",
        "Paul: I'm filing for sole custody. Meg and I are gonna raise that child. That's just the way it's gonna be.",
        "Emily: You know damn well that's not what your sister wanted. She wanted Johnny and our baby to know each other.",
        "Paul: How?",
        "Emily: To know his mother.",
        "Paul: You're gonna be locked up. Why would you do that to a child? Make him miss someone so much. Emily, is that kind? Is that fair?",
        "Emily: You don't know that I'm going to jail. Or to a hospital.",
        "Paul: You are delusional?",
        "Emily: No, no, Jennifer was gonna talk to Dusty. She was gonna talk to Dusty and ask him to forgive me.",
        "Paul: Is that what this is about? Is that why you're here? You're here to get Dusty to do something that he doesn't want to? Because, Emily, he doesn't want you walking around free any more than I do.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, I don't believe you. You don't know what he's thinking. I need to talk to Dusty.",
        "Paul: Are you joking? He just buried his wife.",
        "Guard: It's time to go, Ms. Stewart.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, sorry, I need to talk to Dusty. Please, please!",
        "Guard: I'm sorry, ma'am, I have my orders --",
        "Emily: Please just let go of my hand! I need to talk to Dusty!",
        "Guard: Don't make me use the cuffs, ma'am.",
        "Emily: Please -- I didn't know what he's thinking. I have to know what Dusty wants.",
        "Paul: You know what he wants? He wants to testify against you. He wants the world to know that you kidnapped him and locked him up in a farmhouse and that you tortured him and that would have shot him dead if he hadn't gotten away.",
        "Emily: No! No, Jennifer forgave me, Paul.",
        "Paul: See, and if Jennifer saw you right now? She wouldn't want you anywhere near Johnny or her nephew. This is, right here, is exactly why I'm filing for sole custody. You're too volatile, Emily, you're no longer fit to be a parent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I'm not looking for forgiveness.",
        "Dusty: I'll never forgive you for letting Jen leave the hospital.",
        "Lucy: And how many times can I explain? It was her decision. I warned her. I put it in the chart. I even told you to look at the chart.",
        "Dusty: You didn't tell me why. You didn't tell Bob, you didn't tell anyone. You let her leave.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, it's entirely possible that it would've made no difference -- that she would have died anyway. And who knows, maybe deep down, she knew that. And those hours she spent at home celebrating with her family -- maybe it was worth it to her.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: I could have done things differently, it's true. I could have talked to Dr. Hughes and told him that Jennifer insisted on discharging herself. But it was her decision. And you can't think that I wanted her to suffer or to die -- you can't think that.",
        "Dusty: If she'd stayed in the hospital, she would've had a chance.",
        "Lucy: Maybe. And maybe not.",
        "Dusty: What do you want from me? Forgiveness?",
        "Lucy: No. I want to help you.",
        "Dusty: How? My wife died because of you. How you gonna help me?",
        "Emily: Dusty -- Dusty!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Casey: I love you. And you need to know that I would never judge you.",
        "Meg: I think she loves this baby. She's caring. And it could be a big mistake to keep them apart.",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna release your trust fund to you.",
        "Will: Why are you doing this? The real reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: I'm sorry, ma'am, it's time to go.",
        "Emily: Deep in your heart you know this is wrong.",
        "Paul: \"Deep in my heart\" -- bunch of garbage? You know why I'm surprised? This from a woman who holds her fetus hostage. Don't look at me like that. You saw what she did, she attacked that guard. She's completely out of control.",
        "Meg: You were bluffing. About Dusty. You don't know where he stands now with Jennifer gone.",
        "Paul: After today, I don't feel like I know anything.",
        "Meg: Let's go home.",
        "Paul: Maybe I should talk to Dusty.",
        "Meg: He's grieving.",
        "Paul: I just want to find out if he's gonna testify.",
        "Meg: Now's not a good time. He's gonna feel the same way you felt when Emily cornered you. Talk to him tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Parker, how about we go have a catch? I've got a couple mitts and a ball in my trunk.",
        "Parker: I'm dressed up.",
        "Jack: Yes, so we won't go diving for anything. Just a nice and easy catch. We'll be outside.",
        "Carly: Hal, we don't have to talk about this now.",
        "Hal: I think that we do. I just lost a daughter and I don't want to lose a son too. And I think that that could happen if I keep him away from his mom -- from his home. I'm trying to say -- I think that I made a mistake having Parker move in with me. I was trying to -- hell, I don't know what I was trying to do. But I just -- I miss Jennifer so much I don't think that I can stand it and I don't want to see that happen to you.",
        "Carly: I have missed him.",
        "Hal: And he misses you. When I think about the time that Jennifer lost with Johnny -- what I'm trying to say --",
        "Carly: I think I know what you're trying to say, Hal. Thank you. Thank you so much. Now, do you want to tell him or should I?",
        "Hal: Why don't we tell him together? Hey Pal, you know what I was thinking? I was thinking maybe you should go home with your mom today.",
        "Parker: You mean it?",
        "Hal: Yeah. And I think maybe you should move your stuff home, too.",
        "Parker: Are you sure? If you want me to stay --",
        "Hal: What I want is for you to come by Sunday morning for pancakes. That's what I want.",
        "Parker: Yes!",
        "Hal: Otherwise I think J.J. and Sage need you home with them.",
        "Carly: Thank you, Hal.",
        "Margo: C'mon, Old Paint. Let's saddle up.",
        "Hal: Who're you callin' Paint?",
        "Parker: I know this is a really sad day. But is it okay to be happy, too?",
        "Carly: Oh, yes. Of course! I'm thrilled that you're coming home.",
        "Jack: You know, part of growing up is understanding that sometimes it's okay to feel two very different things at once.",
        "Parker: You know what would be really great?",
        "Jack: What's that, Buddy?",
        "Parker: If you came home, too.",
        "Jack: I miss you too, Parker. And I promise that we will make a real effort at setting aside some time every week.",
        "Parker: I don't want to have to set time, I want you to come home.",
        "Jack: I hear you, Buddy. But that's not going to happen.",
        "Carly: Hey, would you like to call J.J. from the car and tell him the good news?",
        "Parker: Why can't things just go back to normal?",
        "Carly: Well, because things have changed, Honey. But you're coming home with me and Sage and J.J. and that's a really great thing. So, c'mon, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I want to thank you for everything you said about your sister today. It meant a lot.",
        "Will: Well, it meant a lot to me when you asked me to be your best man.",
        "Dusty: That's what you are. Your sister, she loved you very much.",
        "Gwen: Are you ready?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "[Barbara was going to take Jennifer's big photo on the display.]",
        "Dusty: Don't, don't. Leave it.",
        "Barbara: My daughter loved you completely. And no mother could ask for more than that. Come back to my place. Have something to eat. Be with Johnny.",
        "Dusty: I'd like to spend some time with my wife first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie? Maddie? Where'd you go?",
        "Maddie: I can't do this.",
        "Casey: Maddie, whoa, wait, wait, wait. I won't touch you anymore, if that's what it was. I'm sorry. Just take a deep breath, it's me.",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry --",
        "Casey: No, it's fine. Obviously, you've got some stuff that's really hard to talk about -- I can see that. And maybe I'm not asking the right questions or listening hard enough. But I want to keep trying. Because I love you. And you need to know that I would never judge you. So if something happened with Dallas or before Dallas, whatever I don't care. You can trust me, it won't go any further. Let's just start over, okay?",
        "Maddie: Oh, Casey, I wish I could, you don't know how much but -- I'm sorry.",
        "Lia: Hey, what's wrong with Maddie? She just blew past me like I didn't even exist.",
        "Casey: It's nothing. Drop it.",
        "Lia: Okay, consider it dropped. So, how's Crash? Are you still spinning? I loved that set you played opening night.",
        "Casey: It's good. I'm there most nights. You should come check it out.",
        "Lia: Okay, maybe I'll do that.",
        "Casey: Cool.",

        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Susan: Tom stopped by. The hearing's tomorrow.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know.",
        "Susan: And afterwards, you won't be coming back here. Depending on the judge's decision, they are either going to see y to prison or to a psychiatric hospital.",
        "Emily: Before the trial?",
        "Susan: I'm afraid so. I'm so sorry.",
        "Emily: Nobody wants me to be a mother. You don't understand. Now that Jennifer is gone, nobody's on my side, Mother. Nobody.",
        "Susan: Sweetie, what happened at the memorial service?",
        "Emily: Paul stood in front of the entire church and told everyone he's going to raise his own child. I'm sorry, he's going to raise his child with Meg. And then later, after I begged him to let me be part of my child's life, he refused. He's said he's going for full custody.",
        "Susan: Did Dusty say anything to you?",
        "Emily: Dusty, Dusty wouldn't even look at me.",
        "Susan: Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's unsympathetic. I'm sure he had a lot on his mind. Ah, look, Sweetie. I think you should concentrate on getting a goodnight's sleep. So, you can put your best foot forward tomorrow with the judge. And no matter what happens, I want you to remember something. You did a good, a loving, generous thing. Helping Johnny and Jennifer. And I will always be proud of you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Won't your mother be expecting us upstairs?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't know. I think I need a little minute after that run-in with Emily. She's completely out of control. You want something to drink?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Okay, what is it?",
        "Meg: I just think she had a point.",
        "Paul: Before or after she decked the guard? Okay, what was her point?",
        "Meg: About your sister's wishes. And you know I don't want Emily in our lives. But Jennifer made it very clear. She's forgiven Emily and she wants us to do the same. She wants her child and your child to grow together.",
        "Paul: Jennifer was very loving, and can be very forgiving. And if she wants me to forgive Emily, I'll do my very best to do that. But there is a difference between forgiving somebody and exposing a child to danger. You saw Emily today, she's completely uncontrolled -- she's dangerous, violent, irrational.",
        "Meg: I don't think it's fair to judge her right now. Her back's up against the wall.",
        "Paul: But that's exactly what's happening. She's going to court tomorrow to be judged because her actions demand it. Because the law demands it. She's a criminal, for God's sake, Meg.",
        "Meg: Fine.",
        "Paul: You don't think so?",
        "Meg: I think she loves this baby she's carrying and it could be a big mistake to keep them apart.",
        "Paul: No, it's not a mistake, its common sense. I'm not letting that woman anywhere near my child!",
        "Meg: Do you hear yourself? You're doing it again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, what's that?",
        "Barbara: Pictures of Jennifer and Johnny. I'm still kind of attached to my old cameras. The roll came back in the mail today and I think I've got some more arriving too.",
        "Gwen: We can add them to the book that you are making for Johnny. Do you want us to get out the food?",
        "Barbara: No, no, I want you to sit down. I want to thank you both for all your help and support. Will, do you have any idea how much I love you? I don't think you do. And that's my fault. Because I don't think I've ever let you know how I feel in a truly loving way. But that's going to change. Because if there's one thing I have learned from Jennifer's death is that, there's only so much you can protect your kids from. You can love them, and cherish them, and advise them, that's about it. So, in the light of being kinder and gentler mother, I'm going to release your trust fund to you. No strings. Yes, I want you to graduate high school and go to college, but I'm not going to force you.",
        "Gwen: Well, actually. I can. He's definitely going to college.",
        "Barbara: I knew I liked you. But seriously, I'm going to go to the bank tomorrow, and make arrangements.",
        "Will: Wait. Why are you doing this? The real reason.",

        "Damian: Here. You looked like you could use a little old fashioned help.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Damian: You've been crying. What is it?",
        "Lucy: I just came from Jennifer Donovan's memorial service.",
        "Damian: Was that the patient you were so worried about? The one that was dying?",
        "Lucy: I let her leave the hospital when she was too sick to go home. And her husband hates me for it.",
        "Damian: Hate is a strong word.",
        "Lucy: Unfortunately, it's also very accurate. With that, he would have forgiven me by now. But he actually blames me for what happened.",
        "Damian: Give him some time.",
        "Lucy: No. He's right. It's my fault she died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lia: Looking for this?",
        "Maddie: Thanks.",
        "Lia: I'm actually glad that you came back. I want to talk to you about something. Sit down. Don't worry, Casey's gone.",
        "Maddie: I'm not worried.",
        "Lia: Good. Because I'm not the kind of girl who takes another girl's guy while she's still attached. If you know what I mean.",
        "Maddie: No. I don't actually know what you mean.",
        "Lia: It's just Casey asked me out, and I said yes. I just wanted to double check with you first.",
        "Maddie: You're asking my permission?",
        "Lia: Come on, we're friends. But you guys are split, right? That's what Casey made it sound.",
        "Maddie: Do what you want.",
        "Lia: I will. See ya. You'll need this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, where were you? I was worried about you.",
        "Casey: Sorry. I wanted to talk to Maddie. But you caught a ride?",
        "Margo: Well, yeah. With Hal. So, what's going on?",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Margo: Did you talk to Maddie?",
        "Casey: For what it's worth.",
        "Margo: Did she tell you what was happening with her?",
        "Casey: Nope. And I tried everything I could think of to get her to talk, but she's all freaked out. Bottom line is, she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.",
        "Margo: No, no. Just give it time, give it time, Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Damian: Don't be silly. Here.",
        "Lucy: Oh, you're too much.",
        "Damian: I can find a tissue if you like.",
        "Lucy: No, this is fine. I should go. I'm already late for my shift.",
        "Damian: Is this a shift you were assigned to? Or are you trying to pitch in to take your mind off thing?",
        "Lucy: You know everything, don't you?",
        "Damian: Why don't you sign out and come home with me. I know that Luke would love to see you. We could have something cool to drink, sit by the pool, relax.",
        "Lucy: Sounds lovely. But I'm sure you're here at the hospital for a reason, not just to rescue me.",
        "Damian: I came to check on Lily. No change?",
        "Lucy: But she's stable. And the baby is healthy.",
        "Damian: So come home with me and help me take my mind off things. I could use the company and I know Luke could too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You're trying to take a baby away from its mother, Paul. Do you really want to go down that road again?",
        "Paul: But this is completely different. You said so yourself, the other day.",
        "Meg: I know. I know, and I tried really hard to believe that. But after the service today, I realized that's exactly the same thing. You took Jennifer's son away from her for all the right reasons, and you've regretted it ever since. Don't make that same mistake twice.",
        "Paul: How can you do this? How can you just make a 180 like that?",
        "Meg: When someone dies, it changes things. You see the world a little differently. Paul, look, I'm still more than willing to help you raise this child. But I'm not ready to lie about his mother or deny Emily any kind of access.",
        "Paul: She's crazy!",
        "Meg: Maybe. Maybe, but if she is, she'll be sent to a hospital. And if not, she'll go to jail. Either way, there's no reason she can't send letters or pictures, or get some back. Why shouldn't your child know there's a mother out there that loves him?",
        "Paul: She got to you. Meg, I can't believe this.",
        "Meg: What are you so afraid of? She's going to be locked up.",
        "Paul: And I don't think you should burden a child like that.",
        "Meg: Then don't make it a burden. Let her send the letters, okay? The kid won't be able to read for another five years. I'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Paul, I'm worried about you.",
        "Paul: You're worried about me?",
        "Meg: You're starting to do that thing you do, where you make everything black and white? Look, I know Emily's done some stupid things, terrible things. But she's not a monster, don't make her into one.",
        "Paul: I'm this child's parent. It is my job to protect and defend.",
        "Meg: Well, you keep telling yourself that, and you'll end up hurting the people around you.",
        "Paul: Come on, now. Who's exaggerating.",
        "Meg: Paul, you're going against your sister's dying wish for you. Maybe you're able to live with that, but I can't.",
        "Paul: Meg!",

        "Susan: Emily, I'm -- Emily? You're scaring me, Sweetie.",
        "Emily: I'm just -- I'm just thinking, Mom.",
        "Susan: About what?",
        "Emily: My baby.",
        "Susan: Well, baby's healthy and that's all that really counts. Look, you should be getting ready for bed. I'm going to go ask the nurse for a plastic bag for your toiletries. I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Emily: Its okay, baby. If Dusty won't help us, I will find another way.",

        "Barbara: Why do I want to give you your trust? Because you are a grown man with a remarkable wife. And know that you will use your trust wisely, to give yourselves as comfortable a life as you deserve. So, spend it. Don't spend it. Leave it in the bank, let it grow, whatever. It's yours, Will. I want you to have a home. I want Gwen to have a home. Honey, I know you had a tough time. And I want that to change. And want you both to know how much I love you. And how happy I am, Gwen that you are part of this family. Especially now. Now that I've lost my only daughter. It's so comforting to know that I have such a wonderful daughter-in-law. [Knock on the door] Okay. They're here. Will, pour champagne. Glasses are right over there. Okay, let's go. Hi. Hi, Tom. Thanks for coming.",
        "Tom: Laura told me that service was beautiful. Sorry I couldn't be there.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Thanks so much. Thanks for taking care of Hal. Is he coming?",
        "Margo: He's parking the car -- oh, you know what? Here he is now.",
        "Barbara: Oh, thank you.",
        "Hal: I brought some cider for the kids.",
        "Barbara: Oh, so sweet. Thank you. Hi, Honey.",
        "Kim: Love you.",
        "Barbara: You too. And Nancy. Come on in, come on in. Lisa, what would I do without you guys? Okay. Everyone had champagne?",
        "Kim: Is everyone here?",
        "Barbara: Well, not quite. But I don't want to wait. After that very beautiful ceremony, I feel very close to my daughter. And I know, that all the love and support that I feel is because of her. So, I would like to make a toast to my beautiful daughter. My loving child. To Jennifer.",
        "All: To Jennifer.",
