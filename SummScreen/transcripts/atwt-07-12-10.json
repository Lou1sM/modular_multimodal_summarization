Katie bemoans to Chris how she lost her best friend and Vienna lost her husband. She worries how Henry will take this since he won't let her be there for him. Chris gives her unwavering support, which Katie really appreciates. Henry plays coy at first with Vienna, as he bides his time, but then he can't take it anymore when he finds Vienna's pregnancy pillow. He rages at her about her lies, deceit and worst of all claiming they lost yet another child. He orders her out of his life, as Vienna begs and pleads with him to forgive her. Henry won't hear her pleas. Vienna calls Katie and blames her and tells her that she no longer wants her help ever again; she won't lose Henry to Barbara.

        "Lily: Bon, Fran\u00e7oise. A bient\u00f4t. Her lawyers are drafting up the contracts, and they should be ready to sign tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Perfect. That means, by this time perfume in France will belong to you and Carly.",
        "Lily: And to you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but not that anybody else should know that, especially Carly. She can't know that I'm funding this.",
        "Lily: I have to be honest. Keeping your involvement in this a secret doesn't sit with me. I don't like lying to Carly, especially when we're starting a business together.",
        "Craig: People have silent partners all the time.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but usually all the other partners know about them.",
        "Craig: Carly can't know that I'm the guarantor. She'll back out. You don't want that, and neither do I.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but --",
        "Craig: Relax. The only one taking a financial risk here is me, and I don't even consider it a risk, as long as I stay anonymous. Lily, no one's going to get hurt here. In fact, it's even better --",
        "Holden: Lily, I was wondering if -- what the hell is he doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How'd it go?",
        "Jack: Oh, it went great. I think Sage and Natalie are gonna have the time of their lives at that camp. I wanted to stay and spend a week.",
        "Carly: Yeah? Well, tell me everything about it. I want to hear every detail.",
        "Jack: I'm sure you do. So, maybe we can grab a cup of coffee, and I'll fill you in. We can talk. Finally have that conversation we've been wanting to have, about where we stand.",
        "Carly: I'd like that. Yeah.",
        "Molly: Sorry I'm late, Cuz. Oh. Or am I too early? Am I interrupting something?",
        "Jack: No, not at all. Looks like a rain check.",
        "Carly: Looks like it.",
        "Jack: I'll see you later.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "Jack: Bye, Mol.",
        "Molly: Bye, Jack. Oh. I just ruined the moment for you, didn't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I think it's a safe bet that she's not gonna take a nap anytime soon.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I think it's all the excitement. New place, new faces.",
        "Will: Too much ice cream.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that, too. Thank you, Casey and Alison.",
        "Will: I just wish my mom were around to spend more time with her.",
        "Gwen: I think she really needed to get away, you know? With Henry marrying Vienna and everything.",
        "Will: Yeah, but my mom's not really the type to run away from a challenge. She likes to sabotage them.",
        "Gwen: So you don't believe she's on that cruise at all, do you?",
        "Will: I just want to do some checking around, at least get a little more info.",
        "Gwen: Is there anyone you can talk to?",
        "Will: Yeah, Jack. Why don't you take her, go see your sister, and I'm gonna go talk to him.",
        "Gwen: Okay. That sounds like a plan.",
        "Will: Mm-hmm. Come here, Hallie. You're gonna go see your Aunt Carly. Let's go.",
        "Gwen: Do you see her bag?",
        "Will: Yeah. It's over there.",
        "Gwen: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What do you mean, there was never any baby?",
        "Katie: Oh, God, Henry. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but you need to know the truth. There never was a baby. Vienna was never pregnant.",
        "Henry: Is this some kind of twisted Katie logic to make me feel less bad about the miscarriage?",
        "Katie: No. It was Vienna's way of trying to hold onto you.",
        "Henry: Okay. You're not making any sense, Sweetie.",
        "Katie: None of this makes sense, and I'm sorry. As crazy and horrible as it sounds, it is true. I swear. Vienna didn't have a miscarriage, because she was never pregnant in the first place.",
        "Henry: She was never pregnant?",
        "Katie: No. She only told you that because she was afraid to lose you to Barbara.",
        "Henry: That doesn't make any sense. Sweetie, there were tests, and she went to see doctors.",
        "Katie: Did you ever actually see her with one of the tests?",
        "Henry: No, no. But this is insanity. What are you talking about?",
        "Katie: I know it's insane. I tried to tell her that many times. I could never talk her out of her plan, though, and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but these lies can't go on anymore.",
        "Henry: You're telling me that she was never pregnant.",
        "Katie: No, not this time.",
        "Henry: And that she pretended to be so that I would marry her.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Henry: And then she pretended to lose the baby so that I would never find out that she was never pregnant.",
        "Katie: Yes. I'm so sorry, Henry.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God! How could she do this to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Please, please, Chris! Please, I'm begging you. This is for Katie's sake as much as mine. If he founds out that she kept my secret, he'll hate her forever. Do you really want to see that happen?",
        "Chris: She was crazy to allow you to go through with this.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but she knows how desperate I was.",
        "Chris: Vienna, Henry -- I mean, how could you do this to someone that you claim you love?",
        "Vienna: I did it because I love him! Don't you see? I did it because I don't want to lose him.",
        "Chris: You invented a baby to hold onto him? Vienna, that doesn't sound like love to me. If that's what you do to hold onto a guy, you know what I'd tell Henry? I'd say, \"Run away from that girl as fast as you can.\"",
        "Vienna: No, no! Henry and I, we belong together. He loves me, and I love him.",
        "Chris: I'm really starting to doubt that you know the meaning of the word.",
        "Vienna: Of course I do.",
        "Chris: Vienna, you lit the fuse. Now you watch the explosion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I am not justifying what Vienna did, but it was not done out of malice. You need to know that her heart was in the right place.",
        "Henry: How can you say that? She lied to me. She, uh -- she let me believe that we were having a baby, and then she let me believe that we lost another one, Katie? I've been sitting with her. I've been worried sick about her. I've been blaming myself for this!",
        "Katie: I know, but she loves you so much! That's the only reason I went along with this plan, because I remembered how happy we all were -- you and Vienna and me and Brad. I didn't want you two to lose what I lost when he died.",
        "Henry: Oh, don't. Don't you dare drag Brad into this. Don't do that.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But you know the truth now. It's out there. What can we do to fix it?",
        "Henry: Fix it? We can't do anything to fix this!",
        "Katie: Come on. Please just let me help, Henry. What can I do? What can I do?",
        "Henry: For starters, you can stay the hell away from me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: [Sighs] Oh, my God! You scared me, Henry.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. What are you doing up and about?",
        "Vienna: I was going a little crazy. I had to get some fresh air.",
        "Henry: Yeah. You shouldn't be walking around in your condition. You just had a miscarriage. You must be in a lot of pain.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. I feel a little weak, but don't worry. I didn't walk far.",
        "Henry: It's all right. Come on. I don't want to take any chances. Come on. Lie down. Hold on a second.",
        "Vienna: Thank you, my darling. We're gonna get through this, aren't we? As long as we have each other.",
        "Henry: That's right. That's right. As long as we have each other, there's nothing that can hurt us.",
        "Vienna: Oh. I love you so much. I'm sorry, Henry.",
        "Henry: What do you have to be sorry about? This wasn't your fault. Hey, you didn't cause the miscarriage.",
        "Vienna: No. But I feel I've let you down.",
        "Henry: No, you haven't let me down. As long as you love me as much as you say you do, then you could never let me down. All right. All right. Enough talk. There you go. There you go. Lie down. What's this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Relax, Holden. I'm here with good intentions.",
        "Holden: Somehow I doubt that, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm simply offering Lily some financial compensation for taking in Gabriel. So I'll hear from you?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes. We'll speak soon.",
        "Craig: Always a pleasure. Oh, and you, too, Holden.",
        "Holden: Please tell me that you're not going to take money from him.",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Holden: Because if you do, there will be a catch to it, Lily. Count on it.",
        "Lily: I don't know if I agree with you. Having Gabriel come into his life has had a profound effect on Craig.",
        "Holden: For that, he'd have to be human, and I think you should reconsider letting Gabriel stay at the house.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Holden: Because then you have to deal with him on a regular basis.",
        "Lily: I can handle Craig. How's Meg doing? Did you and your mother get her settled in already?",
        "Holden: Yes. She's in a facility down in D.C. it seems to be top of the line. So she's in the best place she can be.",
        "Lily: Oh. I really hope it works out for her, Holden.",
        "Holden: Yeah, we all do. My mother's down there with her right now. Iva's there. She said to say hello. Sends her love.",
        "Lily: That was sweet. Is that why you're here to see me?",
        "Holden: Actually, no. I need some help with the kids.",
        "Lily: Of course.",
        "Holden: I want to get them involved in the wedding.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Holden: Yeah. The rehearsal dinner, ceremony, the reception.",
        "Lily: You're really going all-out.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Molly wants the whole nine yards, and I figured, \"Why not?\" Might as well just do it the right way, you know.",
        "Lily: You should.",
        "Holden: Anyway, I just need some help coordinating the kids' schedules.",
        "Lily: Whatever you need.",
        "Holden: I just need to know what they have planned so that there are no conflicts on the days of the events.",
        "Lily: Well, you know that Jack just dropped Natalie off at camp with Sage.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that, and I don't plan on taking her out, but Ethan and Faith are free, and I want to get them involved. I think it would be good for them. I think it would give them a chance to get to know Molly better.",
        "Lily: Yeah, yeah. It will. Whatever you need.",
        "Holden: Thanks. I knew I could count on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't want to get too hopeful, but it does seem like Jack and I are starting to connect again.",
        "Molly: If that's true, then I am really happy for you, and I feel like such an idiot for barging in and interrupting.",
        "Carly: No, you didn't. I knew you were coming. So, tell me, how are the wedding plans coming along?",
        "Molly: It's gonna be big, maybe too big. I feel kind of guilty.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Molly: Because of everything that's happened and everything that the people I love are going through. I don't know. Maybe I don't deserve to go all-out. Maybe I shouldn't.",
        "Carly: Molly, it's because of everything that's happened to you that you absolutely deserve to go all-out. Somebody's got to have a fairy-tale ending, right?",
        "Molly: I want to believe that.",
        "Carly: Trust me. You deserve this happiness.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Mm. Oh, my God! [Gasps] Gwen! Gwen! Aah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Chris: You will never guess what your friend Vienna tried talking me into doing. Or maybe you will.",
        "Katie: She tried to get you to back up her lie about the miscarriage?",
        "Chris: Bingo. And, Katie, I had to say no, okay. I had to. And, listen, I have to be honest with you, all right? You have to stop protecting this girl. She is setting herself up for a tidal wave of trouble.",
        "Katie: Trust me, it already hit.",
        "Chris: Wait, what are you talking about?",
        "Katie: Henry knows everything.",
        "Chris: He does? How?",
        "Katie: I told him. And I think I've just lost the best friend I've ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I've been looking for that everywhere.",
        "Henry: Why? What is it?",
        "Vienna: It's a pad for the car seat for pregnant women to make the ride less bumpy.",
        "Henry: Really? It doesn't look like one to me. You know what this looks like to me?",
        "Vienna: No. What?",
        "Henry: It looks like a -- it looks like an adorable little baby.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: In fact, it looks like our child. It came back to us. It was just hiding behind the bed.",
        "Vienna: Henry, stop it. Why are you acting like this?",
        "Henry: You know what? This is amazing to me. It's back into our lives. You know what I think? I think we should give it a name. I think \"Paddy.\" Paddy, that's a good name.",
        "Vienna: You know, whatever you're thinking, you're wrong.",
        "Henry: What I'm thinking is that we should give it an official name. What's wrong with that? I'm thinking \"Paddy.\" How about that? What do you think about that, huh? How about that, Vienna? You know what? I know what you did! I know everything you did! You lied about being pregnant with our child, and I gave up everything! I gave up everything for you and a baby that never existed!",
        "Vienna: What do you mean, you know everything?",
        "Henry: Your partner in crime confessed all of it.",
        "Vienna: Henry, please. Let me explain.",
        "Henry: You want to explain? You want to explain? Do you think there's anything you can possibly say to me that I would believe?",
        "Vienna: I'll tell you the truth, all of it. I swear.",
        "Henry: Really? That was one thing I thought I could always count on from you, was honesty.",
        "Vienna: I did really love you, honestly!",
        "Henry: Is that why you lied about being pregnant? Is that why you lied about losing a child?",
        "Vienna: I was scared of losing you!",
        "Henry: To who? To who? To Barbara?",
        "Vienna: To Barbara, yes! To Barbara!",
        "Henry: Why? Why? Unlike you, I was honest about that. I told you I had feelings for her, and I said it was something we never had to worry about, and then I chose you! I chose you because I thought there was a strong bond of love between us!",
        "Vienna: But there still is! There still is! That's what this is all about!",
        "Henry: What are you telling me, Vienna? You did this out of love for me? Please.",
        "Vienna: Yes, I did!",
        "Henry: No, you didn't. No, you didn't. You did this out of fear, and you did this out of jealousy, because you wanted to prove to Barbara that you could win.",
        "Vienna: No, no, I didn't! I swear!",
        "Henry: Oh, please. Don't swear anymore. Enough with the lies. Enough with the excuses! Get off!",
        "Vienna: No, Henry, please, please! I was wrong! I was wrong! I made a terrible mistake! I'm sorry! You're right! You're right! I was scared of losing you to Barbara! I couldn't stand the thought of it! Because I've never loved anyone the way I love you! Even Katie saw that! Please! We can get past this, Henry. We can get past this. Yeah. We can get past this, please. You have to forgive me. I'm begging you. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: The look on his face when I told him the truth --",
        "Chris: He didn't take it well, huh?",
        "Katie: Would you?",
        "Chris: I would probably scream bloody murder.",
        "Katie: He's probably doing that right now. Poor Vienna.",
        "Chris: Poor -- you can't feel sorry for her!",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Chris: Why? Because she made a choice, and she's got to deal with the consequences.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and the consequences are she may lose the man she loves, and the irony is, she was doing all of this to hold onto him.",
        "Chris: Oh, give me a break. You can't hold onto someone you love by lying to them.",
        "Katie: I know. I tried to tell that to her. Believe me. Oh, what a mess! Vienna's gonna lose her husband and I'm gonna lose my best friend.",
        "Chris: Well, you know, I'm sure he's gonna forgive you before he forgives her.",
        "Katie: I wouldn't count on it. He knows I've betrayed him now. I mean, he's dealing with her and what she's done, but as soon as he realizes how complicit I was, he's never gonna talk to me again. Oh!",
        "Chris: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Katie: No. The fact that you don't hate me right now is enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Thank you for being so cooperative. I know that it's not easy on you.",
        "Lily: I've put you through as much. Not worse.",
        "Holden: Well, we've certainly been to hell and back quite a few times, huh?",
        "Lily: More times than I want to remember. But we're still standing.",
        "Holden: And friends?",
        "Lily: Always. You deserve to be happy, Holden.",
        "Holden: We both do. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Bye.",
        "Craig: Sheesh. I thought he'd never leave.",
        "Lily: And I thought you already had.",
        "Craig: Forgot this. You okay? You look a little shaken up.",
        "Lily: It's not easy watching your ex move on.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Especially when he's moving on with someone like Molly.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] I'm trying to be a good sport about it.",
        "Craig: But inside, your heart's breaking.",
        "Lily: And my pride.",
        "Craig: The old emotional one-two jab. Hurts, doesn't it?",
        "Lily: I'm trying not to let it.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe I can help. I have just the thing to get you back on your feet. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Wow. I can't believe everything that you've been through in the last year. I don't know what's worse, Craig stealing Parker's trust, you losing Monte Carlo, or Janet getting pregnant right when you and Jack were getting back together. I'm actually amazed you're still standing. If I were you, I'd probably be in a dark room somewhere curled up in the fetal position.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] I've had several hundred days like that. But don't pretend you're not tough, because you have your own stories to tell. I know that.",
        "Gwen: It's true, yeah. But my life is pretty good now. I got to say, things are going well, and this little one, she's amazing.",
        "Carly: Yeah, she is. I am so happy things worked out for you.",
        "Gwen: Things are gonna work out for you, too. You just have to believe they will. Positive thought leads to a positive life.",
        "Carly: Is that right?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Guru Gwen. Who knew?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Gwen: I just have one question. You said that Janet and Jack aren't married anymore, even though she's pregnant.",
        "Carly: That's right.",
        "Gwen: Then I don't get it. What's keeping you and Jack from getting back together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, my word. Will Munson. I didn't know you were in town!",
        "Will: I just got in a little while ago.",
        "Jack: Does Carly know you're here?",
        "Will: Gwen just went to see her.",
        "Jack: Great! How you doing? You look good.",
        "Will: I feel good. How are you?",
        "Jack: Same old, you know.",
        "Will: Yeah. How's Parker?",
        "Jack: He's all right. He's gonna be happy to see you. I'll tell you that.",
        "Will: I can't wait to see him, too.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I hope you're here just to say hi. Nothing's wrong, is there?",
        "Will: I don't know. I hope not.",
        "Jack: Uh-oh. What is it?",

        "Jack: Have you talked to Paul?",
        "Will: Yeah. He can't reach her, either. And I guess earlier today, he got some postcard in the mail that says she's on a cruise, like a last-minute cruise, which makes no sense.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Barbara isn't really the cruise type, is she?",
        "Will: I know I'm probably just overreacting, but something feels off.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. You take after your father, don't you? He always knew when something was up. That's probably what made him such a good cop.",
        "Will: Also made him a pain in the butt as a dad.",

It is an insult. It is, and after the ceremony we had in the park to say goodbye to him, and you turn around and do something so loathsome?",
        "Vienna: I am sorry a million times! I'm sorry!",
        "Henry: No! You can never stay sorry! It's not enough, okay? I don't care anymore, all right? I don't even know who you are, okay? I thought when you came back -- I thought when you came back that we could make this work and that I could love you again. I can't.",

        "Chris: Come on, Katie. You're jumping to conclusions. Do you really think he's gonna try something like that?",
        "Katie: I don't know! Every time in his life before when something went wrong, I was there to help him through it, but I also betrayed him here. He probably feels so alone, like everybody's against him. I got to find him.",
        "Chris: You know, I don't think that's a good idea, okay? I mean, you just said he's furious. Maybe you should give him a little time to process everything.",
        "Katie: I can't. Who knows what he might try in a state like this? And I'm partially to blame. I got to go to him, Chris. God forbid anything horrible happens!",
        "Chris: All right. Well, then, I'm gonna go with you.",
        "Katie: No. I appreciate the offer, but I don't think that's a good idea. I have to do this alone.",

        "Katie: Because Henry will probably feel ganged up on if you come with me.",

I can sort of understand the motive behind that, but then to lie to me about losing a child again, after what we went through? That is -- what is that? What is that? That's reprehensible! That's just evil, Vienna!",
