        "Maid: Sure, I remember the day Doc Reese stayed here. Bet you thought I didn't recognize Dr. Death? I grew up with four brothers. Football was our life.",
        "Margo: So, was Doc Reese alone in this room that day?",
        "Maid: Well, you know he wasn't. I saw you come in, too. Just like that football thing. I'm good with faces.",
        "Margo: Yes, of course. But did he have any other visitors that day?",
        "Maid: Look, Detective, I know you cleared this questioning or whatever you want to call it with my manager, but -- [Pager beeps] Yeah, like I'm the only one who knows where the clean towels are around here. I'll be back.",
        "[Margo imagining]",
        "Doc: As you can see, I fell asleep watching the sports channel.",
        "Margo: Wooh, you're some sleeper.",
        "Doc: You're off the hook. Why don't you just go and be happy?",
        "Margo: What if I don't want to be off the hook?",
        "Doc: The timing is just not right now, okay? Just go.",
        "Margo: No. Something is just not right now.",
        "Doc: What do you mean by that?",
        "Margo: I'm a cop, Doc.",
        "Doc: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Margo: I hear a lot of stories. You start to learn when they don't add up.",
        "Doc: Here -- hey, hey, hey, hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maid: Hey! Hey, don't go messing stuff up in here. I already cleaned this room once today.",
        "Margo: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna be out of your hair in just a minute. You recognize the woman in this picture?",
        "[Maid sighs]",
        "Maid: Is she a friend of yours?",
        "Margo: Yes, my best friend. Do you recognize her?",
        "Maid: This is none of my business.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm making it your business. Was the woman in this picture in this room on the day in question -- yes or no?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jessica remembering]",
        "Ben: You hear that, Jess? You're pregnant. You're having our baby --",
        "Jessica: I know. It's a dream come true. I don't believe this! I'm so happy!",
        "Ben: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: It's my daughter's wedding.",
        "Kim: And my son's, too.",
        "Susan: You didn't even ask her what size wedding she wants. You just throw that list in her face --",
        "Kim: As if you haven't managed to insert yourself into my life time and time again!",
        "Alison: Wait, wait -- you're supposed to be able to handle this?",
        "[Voices arguing in background]",
        "Tiffany: Are you kidding me? No wedding planner on earth could wrangle those two. You'd need a chair and a whip. Do yourself a favor. Get out now.",
        "Susan: You're the one that's paying for this --",
        "Kim: That's not my fault.",
        "Alison: I am! What is wrong with you two? What happened while I was gone?",
        "Susan: She's just doing what she always does, trying to run everything!",
        "Kim: I'm simply trying to help. Alison, I'm --",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Susan: Why don't you say what this is really about? This is about a very tender moment I had with your husband decades ago. So small of you --",
        "Kim: You drag that out every chance you get -- what's the matter with you? Are you proud of it? You and your tender moment with somebody else's husband --",
        "[Voices arguing in background]",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Alison: Chris, please pick up. Please, please, pick up, pick up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Chris: Anybody! Can you hear me?",
        "Emily: Nope. No one anywhere can hear you.",
        "Chris: Well, did you try from other parts of the room? Because sometimes you can -- okay, you tried that.",
        "Emily: Oh, will you just face it? We're trapped like rats down here.",
        "Chris: Oh, well, at least we found the next key to the contest.",
        "Emily: Oh, great -- Alison will be overjoyed someday. When they discover our rotting bones down here.",
        "Chris: Look, it's the Lakeview, okay? People come down here for wine all the time. I just don't know if it's gonna be before my shift is up at the hospital.",
        "Emily: Yeah, or before my sitter starts wondering what happened to me.",
        "Chris: Well, what are we gonna do?",
        "Emily: Ah -- red or red?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You think Craig's the one who planned his daughter's kidnapping?",
        "Dusty: I suspect so. And it looks like Creel just confirmed it.",
        "Hal: Mm-hmm. Just before he took his last breath.",
        "Dusty: Right.",
        "Nikki: And he said Craig was the one who shot him.",
        "Dusty: I didn't want to believe it, either. I'm doing business with this guy. [Dusty sighs] And I know he loves his daughter very much. But there it is.",
        "Hal: Craig Montgomery -- a murderer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig remembering.]",
        "Don: What are you gonna do, tough guy, huh? You gonna plug me fulla holes? Come on! Shoot me! Go ahead! Shoot me!",
        "Craig: Don't take another step.",
        "Don: Just like I thought. You don't have the stones for this, my friend. Now come on, give me the gun before somebody gets --",
        "[Sound of gunshot]",
        "Don: You killed me. And soon everybody's gonna know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maid: I thought you said this was a police investigation.",
        "Margo: And I need some answers.",
        "Maid: About your best friend? What did she do? Rob a bank?",
        "Margo: Was see her here or not?",
        "Maid: Look, maybe you think I'm just someone pushing a broom around, but I know the score. Did you really think I wouldn't figure this out?",
        "Margo: What, what are you talking about?",
        "Maid: Doc Reese has a rep. Him and women always in the headlines, and now you're at this hotel asking questions about him? Who are you really working for? Some jealous husband?",
        "Margo: Well, if that were the case, do you really think I would show you a picture with me and the woman in question?",
        "Maid: Well, either that picture's a fake or you two aren't as chummy as you claim to be. Either way, I'm out of it.",
        "Margo: All right, all right. I'm not a private investigator. I am an officer of the law.",
        "Maid: Well, then maybe you won't mind if my manager talks to your sergeant or lieutenant or whatever before I answer any more questions?",
        "Margo: Yes, I would mind. The truth is, I'm not here on behalf of the Oakdale police. I am here for my friend. For Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Which chapter ticked you off? Was it diaper changing or breast feeding?",
        "Jessica: I was just surprised to find that book lying there. I mean, where did it come from?",
        "Ben: I bought it this morning. I left it there because I thought you'd like to look at it.",
        "Jessica: Honey, what if Curtis saw it?",
        "Ben: Curtis is a big boy. He knows where babies come from.",
        "Jessica: But we said, we said we weren't going to talk about this until after the first trimester. Not to our kids, not to our friends --",
        "Ben: I haven't said anything to Curtis --",
        "Jessica: But you told Margo.",
        "Ben: Only because I thought you'd already told her yourself --",
        "Jessica: And then you leave this book lying here like an open invitation. I mean, honey, what were you thinking?",
        "Ben: Jess --",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I am so sorry.",
        "Ben: Is my wife back now? I need to go searching for pods.",
        "Jessica: No, I haven't been overtaken by aliens. Though it just feels like it sometimes. I don't know, my emotions are just all over the place.",
        "Ben: So, what's got you so upset?",
        "Jessica: Nothing, honey. Nothing, hormones, you know.",
        "Ben: Are you worried about -- about maybe losing the baby?",
        "Jessica: Don't even say that. Don't even say that. I'm having this baby. No matter what.",
        "Ben: Hey, you are not going to get any argument from me on that. I just -- I wish you were happier.",
        "Jessica: I am. I am happy.",
        "Ben: Come here. You went from being scared to death about never being able to get pregnant to being scared to death about the baby. I mean, what happened to the time in between when we just get to be happy? We created a life. We're gonna be raising a new person in this house. And I for one want to enjoy every moment of it. This is a miracle. We should be dancing around the room, saying, \"thank you, God!\"",
        "Jessica: Well, just give me three months, and I promise I'll be dancing as much as you want.",
        "Ben: All right. This baby's gonna go the distance, mark my words. I mean, look at everything that this child has pushed through just to get here and to be ours. I mean, think about all the problems that Dr. Scheuller said we were gonna have --",
        "Jessica: You know what? I don't talk about that. Let's not talk about that. That doesn't matter now.",
        "Ben: All right. The only thing that matters is us. You, me, our family, our baby. Right?",
        "Jessica: You are so good to me. No matter how many mistakes I've made or whatever crazy things I've done.",
        "Ben: Yeah, I'm crazy about you, that's all.",
        "Jessica: And I'm crazy about you. You're the only man I could ever love, Ben. The only one I ever want.",
        "Ben: Well, I hope so. Because you're stuck with me for the rest of your life. [Jessica sighs] So, are you going to be okay now?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, you gotta go?",
        "Ben: Mm-hmm. There's something I want you to remember. This fetus is healthy and normal. And there's not a thing for you to worry about. Okay? And I have a prescription for you. Yes, you get one kiss now, and about a thousand when I get back.",
        "Jessica: Yes, Doctor. I love you so much.",
        "Ben: I love you more. I'll be back.",
        "Jessica: I'll be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Jessica: Why are you here?",
        "Doc: Don't worry, your husband didn't see me. I have to talk to you alone.",
        "Jessica: I don't want to be alone with you, Doc ever again!",
        "Doc: This is completely professional, okay? It's a legal matter.",
        "Jessica: Don't make yourself comfortable. What happened between us, I mean -- I just want you to stay away from me. I want you to stay out of my life, Doc. What? Are you listening to me?",
        "Doc: No. No, I'm not. This caught my eye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Get a grip.",
        "[Craig imagining]",
        "Don: He's the one who killed me. You'll take care of him for me, won't you?",
        "Wade: Oh, yeah. I'll do that. Unless the cops beat me to it and Montgomery fries.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! None of that is going to happen. Because for one thing nobody's gonna know what I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Craig Montgomery will steal you blind, lie to your face a hundred times before breakfast and twice that on Sundays. But to set up his own daughter's kidnapping? And top it off with a murder? I'm sorry, I don't see it.",
        "Nikki: Why not? He came to town and stole Barbara from you, and made your life a complete hell. Why don't you think he's capable of killing someone?",
        "Hal: Because there's nothing in it for him.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I don't know about that. He loves his daughter more than anything in the world.",
        "Hal: So he pays a couple of thugs to terrorize her and take her from her family? Now, that makes no sense.",
        "Dusty: Well, let's look at the timing of the think. Lucy was first attacked at Metro.",
        "Hal: Yeah, that's because of you and your shady associates.",
        "Dusty: That's what we thought. But also on that day, Lucy was planning to leave town with her mother. Remember that? What happened to that trip? It got postponed. And the next time she was attacked, she was in a limo on the way to the airport. You don't see a correlation.",
        "Nikki: So, you grabbed Lucy instead?",
        "Dusty: I screwed up Craig's plans big time. And he probably had a falling out with his crew. And one of them is dead.",
        "Hal: But you're the guy that we found with the body.",
        "Dusty: This has nothing to do with me. This was an inside job.",
        "Hal: Yeah, so you've said.",
        "Dusty: You know when I grabbed Lucy, the first think I did was contact Craig and Lucy's stepfather to tell them where she was. Moments later, these goons are trying to grab her again. Somebody tipped them off. Either Alan Drake who's got nothing to gain from this. Or Craig Montgomery's your man!",
        "Hal: I'm sorry. I'm still not buying.",
        "Nikki: What about the money angle?",
        "Hal: You don't have your kid kidnapped for money. This is all conjecture.",
        "Dusty: How about Creel telling me right before he died --?",
        "Hal: We only have your word for that --",
        "Dusty: Craig shot me, how about that? I'm being straight with you, man!",
        "Hal: You're saving your own butt!",
        "Nikki: Dad, Dad --",
        "Hal: All I'm saying is that Donovan's record with the truth lately has been pretty damn poor.",
        "Dusty: I own up --",
        "Hal: After you've been caught --",
        "Dusty: To everything I do -- I didn't kill this guy!",
        "Hal: After you've been caught --",
        "Nikki: Can I have a word with you?",
        "Hal: Look, I know that you've",
        "Hal: Look, I know that you've sort of bonded with Donovan --",
        "Nikki: This is not about me believing him.",
        "Hal: The guy does have a certain perverse kind of charm --",
        "Nikki: This is about being a good cop. To follow your leads.",
        "Hal: Are you calling your old man a slacker?",
        "Nikki: You taught me to never make assumptions. To always look at my leads objectively. That's what I do. I expect you to do the same.",
        "Hal: Because you're thinking Dusty is innocent.",
        "Nikki: No, because you're the best cop I know, and you're not going to be satisfied until you know who really killed Donald Creel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hal, what brings you here?",
        "Hal: Questions, Montgomery. Always questions.",
        "Craig: About?",
        "Hal: A shooting.",
        "Craig: Who died?",
        "Hal: I didn't say anybody died, did I?",
        "Craig: Well, it kind of follows. What do you want to know?",
        "Hal: I want to know where you were earlier today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: You're pregnant?",
        "Jessica: Ben and I have been trying to conceive for months -- unsuccessfully. I thought everybody in town knew that.",
        "Doc: So, what's with the book? Positive thinking?",
        "Jessica: So, you just choose to be intrusive. You have no sense of what is private and what isn't.",
        "Doc: You need to tell ol' Benjamin that reading books is not how babies get made.",
        "Jessica: This conversation is over.",
        "Doc: About this baby thing, how desperate are you?",
        "Jessica: Not desperate enough to use you for a stud service, Doc. I mean, if that's what you're offering.",
        "Doc: That's good. That's good, because babies aren't my bag.",
        "Jessica: Look, Doc, what happened between us, the humiliating fact that I ended up in bed with you, that was an aberration. And that is never gonna happen again. Not because it's not your bag, but because I want you out of my life.",
        "Doc: So, let's talk about why I'm here, shall we?",
        "Jessica: I'd rather watch you go.",
        "Doc: No, you need to hear this. Trust me. It concerns your friend Margo.",
        "Jessica: What about her?",
        "Doc: There's this waitress, Jill somebody, over at the Country Club. She tried to blackmail Margo, threatening to tell her husband that she saw us, more than once, in what you might call a compromising situation.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, Margo mentioned something about it.",
        "Doc: Did she mention what little Miss Jill wanted in return for her silence? She wanted Margo to set her up with me. I guess I was supposed to spend the night with her, and show her a good time.",
        "Jessica: So?",
        "Doc: So, I talked to the woman, but, hell no, I didn't sleep with her.",
        "Jessica: Well, bully for you, Doc. I'm awed by your restraint.",
        "Doc: Jill didn't find it so awesome. In fact, she upped the ante. She sent a letter to Kim Hughes, trying to make trouble for me at work.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's unfortunate.",
        "Doc: Yeah, you tell me about it. Kim was -- um, firm. She told me to make this whole thing go away.",
        "Jessica: Okay, then that's what you should do.",
        "Doc: I was hoping you'd say that. 'Cause I knew there had to be something legal we could do to stop this woman.",
        "Jessica: I'm sure there is.",
        "Doc: So you'll take care of it?",
        "Jessica: I'd rather swallow poison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Look, Susan I told you --",
        "[Sound of busy signal]",
        "Alison: I need you, Chris. Where are you?",
        "Susan: Told me, and told me, and told me, and told me. Like I'm inclined to take orders from you. Forget about it.",
        "Kim: You're not inclined to do anything.",
        "Susan: Fat chance.",
        "Alison: Hello? Hello? Hello? Please, can we can we maybe just talk about the wedding, please?",
        "Susan: Honey, of course we can talk about the wedding. As much as you want. As soon as Kim leaves, we can talk all you want.",
        "Kim: I'm sorry, Alison. I really was just trying to help.",
        "Susan: Then leave. That --",
        "Alison: Just stop! Stop. Please, just stop. Okay? Okay, look, I know that you two don't like each other. I know that. But you need you to get over it, okay? Because I -- Mom, Mom, I know that you would do anything for me. And Kim -- Kim, I know that you'd move mountains for Chris. So please, can't you just help us to have the perfect wedding?",
        "Kim: Honey, it will be. It will be.",
        "Alison: Well, not if you guys don't work something out. Both of you.",
        "Susan: Okay, what exactly are you asking us to do?",
        "Alison: I'm asking for you to give Chris and me away. To give us to each other. And not just with seating charts and flowers and a great band, but you need to put your heart into it. And just stop going at each other every two minutes, because I can't take that, and I know it'll just make Chris miserable, too.",
        "Bob: Is Chris here?",
        "Alison: No, he's at work. But he must be in the operating room or something, because I can't get hold of him.",
        "Bob: Well, his supervisor couldn't reach him, either. That's why she called me. Chris didn't show up for work today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily groans]",
        "Emily: You know what? Someone's got to come down here and find us, or they're gonna have to -- what are they, gonna call the fire department and knock down the door?",
        "Chris: The door's locked, all right? Not jammed. Sooner or later, somebody's gonna come down here and get a bottle of wine.",
        "Emily: Sooner or later.",
        "Chris: I'm just worried about what people are gonna think. You know, like, well, you know Casey told Lisa he thought the key was down here. When she finds us, she's gonna know why -- why we were trapped.",
        "Emily: Oh, I didn't think of that.",
        "Chris: And if she knows, then everybody else is gonna know, and then Alison's wedding surprise is gonna be completely blown.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but once Alison wins that $300,000, she's not gonna care.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I have a fantasy.",
        "Emily: Are you gonna share that with me?",
        "Chris: No, it's not like that. Look. It's the last day of the contest, and Alison's disappointed 'cause she got so close, but -- but she doesn't have enough keys to win.",
        "Emily: Ah, and who shows up to save the day?",
        "Chris: Wonder-fianc\u00e9, and his trusty sidekick.",
        "Emily: Sidekick, super-sister. Yeah.",
        "Chris: Yeah, right.",
        "Emily: That would be me.",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: You're really sweet to her, you know that?",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I haven't always been so sweet. But I'm going to be a husband.",
        "Emily: Does that freak you out? Seriously.",
        "Chris: Yeah, a little bit. Little bit. I just want to be good at it, you know? Like my Dad. Like the way Hal is with you. Em?",
        "Emily: You know, Hal is great. He's the best. He is. It's just -- I'm not gonna -- I'm not gonna lie to you. Marriage isn't always easy. You know, I just thought we'd got past all stuff with Barbara, and things were back to normal, and then his daughter shows up, and things got tense again.",
        "Chris: Nikki's still staying with you?",
        "Emily: Actually, I'm not sure. I asked her to leave. Hal asked her to come back. The one thing I am sure about is, Nikki and I do not get along.",
        "Chris: Well, if that's the case, then it's her fault.",
        "Emily: Oh, thanks. I live for blind loyalty.",
        "Chris: Emily, you are great, okay? You make such an effort. You're great with Hal's other kids. All right? He's lucky to have you.",
        "Emily: Ali's lucky to have you.",
        "Lisa: What are you two doing in my wine cellar?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: This shooting. Did it have anything to do with Lucy's kidnapping?",
        "Hal: It's an apparent homicide, and it seems that the victim was one of the men who was after Lucy.",
        "Craig: What happened?",
        "Hal: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.",
        "Craig: Well, there were two guys involved. Are you any closer to finding the second one?",
        "Hal: I'm working on it.",

I really -- I can't -- I can't leave here until I know if Jessica was here, or not. Was she here? [Maid sighs] No, she wasn't?",
