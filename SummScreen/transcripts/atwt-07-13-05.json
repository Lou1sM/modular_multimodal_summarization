        "Carly: I had a great idea last night, Jack.",
        "Jack: Guess I'll have a Connipti, honey, if we switch back to Swedish meatballs.",
        "Carly: No, no, not that. I'm talking about research. Archives. I think I've figured out a way to identify the woman in that photo.",
        "Jack: I thought you were done with that, Carly.",
        "Carly: Why? No. Who says? No, something is still nagging at me, Jack. I know that woman. And if I could just get one clue, then I could put the pieces together. I would know why my father was in Oakdale. I would know why I'm having all these dreams.",
        "Jack: Carly, let it go, please.",
        "Carly: I thought we were together on this, Jack.",
        "Jack: I am always on your side, but I think it's time you stop running down all these dead-end streets.",
        "Carly: Maybe they wouldn't stay dead-end streets if you would help me.",
        "Jack: Carly, don't.",
        "Carly: I don't get it. You say that you're on my side, but you act like you don't want me to know the truth about my father. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, two Mochaccinos and, yeah, two chocolate muffins.",
        "Celia: You had the same idea as me.",
        "Will: Chocolate muffins?",
        "Celia: Visiting Gwen in the hospital, right?",
        "Will: Right. I don't know.",
        "Celia: Are you mad about me and Casey?",
        "Will: Look, you and Casey are old news. Now, my girlfriend having a baby today, that's news.",
        "Celia: So she's your girlfriend now?",
        "Will: Whatever.",
        "Celia: Will, you've been acting weird ever since you found out that Casey and I decided to give each other commitment rings.",
        "Will: Look, you and Casey can do whatever you want.",
        "Celia: I know that, but what I don't get is how come you're so upset about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a patient named Gwen Norbeck?",
        "Nurse Smith: Are you sure you're on the right floor?",
        "Casey: She just had a baby.",
        "Nurse Smith: Sorry, I don't see anybody by that name.",
        "Casey: Really? 'Cause I know she was just here.",
        "Bob: You're right, Casey. She was in the neonatal intensive care unit.",
        "Casey: Hey, Grandpa. Do you know what floor that is?",
        "Bob: It's upstairs, but your friend is gone.",
        "Casey: She just had the baby like yesterday. They let her go already?",
        "Bob: Well, she wasn't discharged. She walked away on her own.",
        "Casey: Without telling anybody? Is that safe?",
        "Bob: I'm afraid not.",
        "Casey: She took the baby with her?",
        "Bob: No, fortunately no. He's in an incubator. He was preterm, and he has very low birth weight.",
        "Casey: But he's gonna be all right?",
        "Bob: We're doing everything we can. Honestly, we're not sure if he'll make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Come on, son. You know you're a fighter, just like your old man. Excuse me, can you tell me something about Baby Kasnoff? How's he doing?",
        "Nurse Bentley: Are you a relative?",
        "Craig: Well, actually, I came to see the other preemie, but I'm concerned about both of them.",
        "Nurse Bentley: No details. They're both fighting for their little lives. It's amazing what they'll do to hang on.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, I can imagine. You must have your hands full, two of them born the same day, huh?",
        "Nurse Bentley: Doesn't happen often, but all I can say is thank God for name tags.",
        "Craig: Yes, the lord works in mysterious ways.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Okay, I got him safe in the car. Jen! Jen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, what happened? Where's jennifer?",
        "Dusty: You're too late, pal.",
        "Mike: What are you talking about, I'm too late?",
        "Dusty: There were complications with the delivery, so she had to go to surgery.",
        "Mike: For what?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Something ruptured. I gotta tell ya, there was a lot of blood.",
        "Mike: She's going to be all right, isn't she?",
        "Dusty: I have no idea.",
        "Mike: The baby wasn't due for months. What happened?",
        "Dusty: What happened? You dumped her for another woman when she was seven months pregnant is what happened. You certainly didn't stop her when she decided to take off and she was all freaked out. And where were you when she decided to change a damn light bulb? She fell, lost her balance, went into labor, almost died. Is that enough for you?",
        "Mike: You know, this isn't really the time or the place to be doing this right now.",
        "Dusty: The time and the place was at the cabin when she was screaming for you. I was there, not you. Don't preach to me about time and place, pal! You blew it.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, you came.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Were you coming in or going out?",
        "Craig: I just got home.",
        "Katie: You look like you didn't sleep all night.",
        "Craig: You're not here to monitor my sleep habits, are you? Want one?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, thanks. No, I'm here to give you some information that I didn't want to share with you over the phone.",
        "Craig: Well, shoot.",
        "Katie: Jennifer had her baby.",
        "Craig: I didn't think she was due for a while.",
        "Katie: You know exactly when she was due. The baby's premature.",
        "Craig: I didn't realize you and Jennifer had patched things up. So, were you the first one she called with this news?",
        "Katie: I was with Craig when he found out.",
        "Craig: With Craig? I see. So, Mr. Power tools is still getting around.",
        "Katie: Look who's talking.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Katie: Craig, what is with you?",
        "Craig: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: I just told you that your baby was born, the baby that you've been obsessing about for the past six months. I might as well have just told you that your dry cleaning was ready.",
        "Craig: I get very excited about my dry cleaning.",
        "Katie: See? That. What is that? On top of being completely blas\u00e9, you want to joke with me about Craig? What is wrong with this picture?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Come on, Will. How come you care so much if Casey and I make a purity pledge?",
        "Will: A purity pledge? So that's what they're calling it now?",
        "Celia: Yes. We give each other commitment rings and we promise to stay virgins until we get married.",
        "Will: So you guys are getting married? Is that before or after you take the S.A.T.s?",
        "Celia: I didn't say we were getting married.",
        "Will: No, I think you did.",
        "Celia: Why are you twisting my words around? I thought you were my friend.",
        "Will: I am.",
        "Celia: Then don't make me feel stupid.",
        "Will: I'm sorry. I just don't really understand the whole purity-pledge, commitment-ring thing. I think it's kind of bogus.",
        "Celia: What's wrong with wanting to be with the right person before you do anything?",
        "Will: So Casey's Mr. Right?",
        "Celia: I didn't say that.",
        "Will: Then why get yourself into a situation that's gonna be harder to get out of if it doesn't work?",
        "Celia: Because --",
        "Will: Because if you and Casey exchange little rings, then you don't have to think for yourselves.",
        "Celia: Think about what?",
        "Will: Think about how you really feel about each other? About other people? The ring does all the work for you.",
        "Celia: Casey and I already talked about that. I told him I had feelings in the past for someone else.",
        "Will: Someone else? That's really baring your soul. And what did he admit to?",
        "Celia: What are you getting at?",
        "Will: Nothing. Nothing. Look, I just -- it's a lot easier to make a purity pact than to actually deal with stuff day by day and make choices as they come up.",
        "Celia: Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm taking the easy way out, but I don't know what else to do. There was a time when Casey seemed like he really wanted to, you know, do it. And I just don't want to make the wrong choice and end up like Gw --",
        "Will: Like Gwen? Gwen didn't get in that situation by herself.",
        "Celia: I know. Maybe if you two had waited --",
        "Will: Right. Look, truce?",
        "Celia: Yeah, truce. We better get going if we're going to see Gwen. I was hoping Casey would come with me.",
        "Will: Yeah, where is Mr. Popular?",
        "Celia: I don't know. I keep trying to call his phone, but he's not answering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Do you know why the baby came so early?",
        "Bob: Well, it could be any number of reasons.",
        "Casey: Like?",
        "Bob: Oh, a problem with the fetus. Whether or not the mother took care of herself during her pregnancy. Psychological factors.",
        "Casey: You mean, like if the Mom was really stressed out or something?",
        "Bob: Well, that's possible, but it would have to be an unusual high amount of stress.",
        "Casey: Oh, man.",
        "Bob: You're a good friend, Casey. I can see you're really concerned about this young woman and her baby.",
        "Casey: I should have done something.",
        "Bob: Look, these things happen. We just never really know. That's for me. Listen, if you want to do your friend Gwen a favor, you find her, talk to her, get her to come back to the hospital so that we can examine her and make sure that she's okay.",
        "Casey: Well, what about the baby?",
        "Bob: We're doing everything we can. Excuse me, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya what's going on. The only thing going on with me is this anniversary party. And I wish I wasn't the only one into it.",
        "Carly: That's nice. That's great. Guilt-trip me into changing the subject.",
        "Jack: No, but the only subject, honey, should be us. What's wrong with wanting to focus on you and me?",
        "Carly: Nothing. Except I know you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Know what?",
        "Carly: Meaning you always get that look when you're trying to keep something from me.",
        "Jack: What look? What are you ta --?",
        "Carly: That one. There it is again, that guilty look.",
        "Jack: Honey, you're grasping at straws.",
        "Carly: Please don't do this. We both know that I have an on-again, off-again relationship with the truth. But not you. This is very important to me, Jack. You asked me what I want for our anniversary? I just want one thing -- the truth.",
        "Jack: You're right. I haven't been up front. I'll tell you what's going on.",
        "Manager: Jack and Carly Snyder, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Manager: Yeah. I can go over the details for the party with you now.",
        "Jack: Great. Yeah --",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Could you just give us another couple of minutes, please? What's going on?",
        "[Jack remembering]",
        "Jack: It's not possible. Somebody made a mistake.",
        "Jessica: Look, Jack, I know how upsetting this is --",
        "Jack: No, this didn't happen. It's not true.",
        "Jessica: The records don't lie. And now you have to think about what you're going to do now that you know. If Carly is as hell-bent as you say she is about finding out the truth --",
        "Jack: Jessica, she's not gonna find out about this. I promise you that. Whatever I have to do, whatever it takes, she will never know about this. Ever.",
        "Jack: Honestly -- Carly, you know, I haven't wanted to say this, but you've been scaring me.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Jack: You're so obsessed about this picture, honey, I'm afraid you're gonna go over the edge.",
        "Carly: Why? Since les died, have I done one thing to make you think that I might be losing it? Have I missed a single date? Have I forgotten to pick up the children? Have I put your socks in the microwave --?",
        "Jack: No, but --",
        "Carly: Then I don't understand why it makes nuts because I want to solve this. Why can't you be with me on this?",
        "Jack: I just want you to be happy, and I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Carly: I knew you'd help me.",
        "Manager: Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I got the wine distributor on the phone. Wants to check the order with you.",
        "Carly: Sure.",
        "Jack: Yeah, hi. This is Detective Snyder of the Oakdale Police Department. I need to meet with you as soon as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, is the baby all right?",
        "Katie: I think so. But he's in an incubator.",
        "Craig: And Jennifer?",
        "Katie: I think she's okay. But I'm not sure. What is going on with you, Craig?",
        "Craig: I'm trying to find out whether mother and child are all right.",
        "Katie: Why aren't you being your normal over-zealous, pig-headed self?",
        "Craig: I can't win with you, can I?",
        "Katie: Well, Craig -- my brother would be rushing to the hospital to take a look at his baby boy. Why aren't you ordering a bunch of cigars?",
        "Craig: Because, it's not my party, is it? Do I have to remind you there's an injunction against me, keeping me from my son for the next five years?",
        "Katie: Nothing like that has ever stopped you before.",
        "Craig: What do you want from me?",
        "Katie: A normal Craig response. After everything you've gone through for this baby, I can't believe that you just don't care anymore.",
        "Craig: Maybe I can't afford to get excited. All right? Maybe after all I've been through, maybe it's better for me to keep my emotions in check. All right? I have tried harder than most would to be a part of this baby's life. And I lost out, okay? So I move on.",
        "Katie: And how are you moving on?",
        "Craig: Well, I wasn't going to tell you until it became official. But since Rosanna's at the lawyer's, I think it's okay to share.",
        "Katie: Share what?",
        "Craig: Rosanna and I have decided to become parents again. We're adopting.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. You know why I look like I've been up all night? Because I have been up all night. Jennifer wasn't the only one who gave birth last night. The mother whose child we're going to adopt also gave birth. So, congratulate me and call me Daddy, because it looks like I'm gonna be a papa after all.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Gwen: Go away.",

        "Gwen: What the hell do you want?",
        "Casey: I wanna know if I'm your baby's father.",

        "Dusty: What do you need, Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: My baby.",
        "Dusty: Your baby's in an incubator now. And they're taking very good care of him. Don't worry.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, did you see the baby?",
        "Mike: No, no, I came to see you first. How you doing?",
        "Jennifer: Not so good. I made a mess. Everything's --",
        "Mike: Not -- shh, not now, all right. You need your rest.",
        "Jennifer: It wasn't supposed to be like this.",
        "Mike: No, it wasn't.",
        "Jennifer: It was supposed to be our baby.",
        "Mike: I know.",
        "Jennifer: Mike? Mike?",
        "Mike: Hey, hey, I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: You show up now demanding answers?",
        "Casey: So then, what you're saying is, I really am the father?",
        "Jennifer: I wanna see the baby, okay? I haven't seen him since we got to the hospital. I just need to see for myself that he's okay.",
        "Nurse: Call for a NICU doctor, stat. We've got a code blue in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Her name is Lucinda Walsh.",
        "Nurse Smith: She's the lumpectomy, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, and she's also on the board of this hospital, so let's think of her as a person instead of a procedure.",
        "Nurse Smith: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way.",
        "Meg: Its okay, it's okay. Just remember, I'm her private nurse, so if you could keep me in the loop of everything, okay? Thank you. Hey, stranger.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Meg: So, I haven't seen you since you walked out on our date last.",
        "Dusty: I thought you were on your way to Alaska.",
        "Meg: Yeah, um, too cold. Besides, I wanted to give you another chance to make things up to me. So, how've you been?",
        "Dusty: Good. Busy.",
        "Meg: Doing what?",
        "Dusty: I delivered a baby.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Okay. That is, I think, the best excuse I have ever heard.",
        "Dusty: I'm not kidding. Jennifer Munson went into labor and I was the only one around.",
        "Meg: You delivered Jennifer's baby? Wow, you must be quite the hero, huh?",
        "Dusty: I'm the last person on earth she should have called.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I didn't know what I was doing.",
        "Meg: Well, it could be a little overwhelming, but after a certain point, nature kind of takes over.",
        "Dusty: She passed out and almost bled to death.",
        "Meg: Is the baby okay?",
        "Dusty: He's in the I.C.U. he's premature. Jennifer had to have surgery. Aw, man.",
        "Meg: Dusty, all kinds of things can go wrong during childbirth. You shouldn't blame yourself for anything going wrong or --",
        "Dusty: I'll call -- I'll talk to you later. Your sister's up in the neonatal unit.",
        "Will: Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that's why you're here, right? To see Jen and her baby?",
        "Will: What? No. I didn't even know she'd had her baby. We're here to see a friend.",
        "Celia: Go see your sister, Will. I'll find Gwen, tell her you'll come by. Give these to her. I'll buy some more for Gwen. Go.",
        "Will: Okay, all right. I'll see you later.",

        "Gwen: Are you my baby's father?",
        "Casey: It's a real question, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: One that you already asked me.",
        "Casey: And you totally dodged.",
        "Gwen: And you totally let me.",
        "Casey: Stop it, Gwen. Just tell me the truth, all right? Because it's killing me to think that --",
        "Gwen: Yeah? Well, then don't. You know, I always figured that thinking was a slightly painful process for you. So, now that we've fixed your little problem, you can leave. I don't feel so great.",
        "Casey: Look, Gwen, I know Will isn't the father, okay? He told me.",
        "Gwen: I don't believe you. He wouldn't say that.",
        "Casey: I was at the hospital, all right? They told me you just walked out, and that the baby's in an incubator.",
        "Gwen: Remind me, why exactly do you suddenly give a damn?",
        "Casey: Because you can't just walk out of a hospital, that's why. I mean, you gotta get checked out or --",
        "Gwen: Aw, gee. Uh-huh. I wonder what I did all this time without your two cents? Where were you when I was back there trying to figure things out? I've been alone this whole time, Casey. I've being worried alone. Getting sick alone. Giving birth to this baby alone. Where were you? Oh, oh, I know. You were trying to score with your girlfriend. You treated me like dirt, Casey! So what makes you think that you have any right to show up on my doorstep and mess with my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wait a minute. Back up.",
        "Craig: Huh?",
        "Katie: You want to adopt a baby? Again?",
        "Craig: Rosanna's with the attorney now.",
        "Katie: And you decided this when? I just talked to you. You were still seething about what happened in court.",
        "Craig: Like I told you, I had to move on.",
        "Katie: You've never moved on from anything this quickly.",
        "Craig: Well, people change. I change. I've had to.",
        "Katie: In a week?",
        "Craig: Why is it so hard for you to believe that I might feel pain, Katie? That your pig-headed, self-centered brother might actually have a heart?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like that.",
        "Craig: Well, you do, okay? When Bryant died, I nearly lost my will to live. Okay? When I lost Cabot, a piece of me went with him. When Jennifer shut me out from my son, okay? Do you get the picture? Now, Rosanna understood how I felt, because she felt that, too. But she convinced me to open my heart again to another child. That's exactly what we're gonna do.",
        "Katie: And she trusts you after your last adoption nightmare?",
        "Craig: She's making a leap of faith.",
        "Katie: But Craig, with your record, how are you even gonna find an agency to help you?",
        "Craig: A private attorney's handling all the details. It's gonna be perfectly legal.",
        "Katie: So you're telling me you're really gonna do it right this time?",
        "Craig: I sure hope so. I've been through a lot of pain, Katie. I've learned a lot of lessons. Don't you think I deserve a second chance?",

        "Mike: I'm not really sure. I wasn't there.",
        "Dusty: She fell and went into labor early.",
        "Mike: Come on, let's go see if she's awake.",
        "Dusty: Hey, don't start anything with Jen that you can't finish.",
        "Mike: Look, you were there for her, Dusty. I appreciate that. Right now, she's asking for me.",

        "Jack: Well, I think we've put together an awesome plan, Mrs. Snyder, if I do say so myself. It's going to be one hell of a celebration.",

        "Jack: Mm-hmm. Mmm. I would love to continue this thought, but I gotta go. We're done here, right?",

        "Jack: Honey, can it wait? I'm really late for this work thing.",
        "Carly: Yeah, all right, go ahead. I would sound like a broken record, anyway.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, let's make this about us today, okay? Can we do that?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. As long as you promise we can get back to it right after the party.",

        "Kim: Oh. Okay. What's up?",
        "Carly: Take a look at that. Do you happen to know that woman?",
        "Kim: Well, it would help if it weren't quite so blurry.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. It was the best I could do.",
        "Kim: It's funny, as I look at her, she looks kind of familiar, but I can't really place her. What's her name?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I just know that she was involved in some scandal at a family health clinic years ago.",
        "Kim: Ah. I don't mean to pry, but what does that have to do with you?",
        "Carly: I'm not sure. I know that she was connected to my father somehow. I found out that he was in town years ago. And I thought that if this event made the news, then maybe it would be in the WOAK archives and maybe I could track her down.",
        "Kim: Without a name -- do you know what it was that happened? Maybe we could search for a -- I don't know, a key phrase or a word of some kind. A year?",
        "Carly: No. I thought maybe you catalogued your news stories.",
        "Kim: We do, we use the traditional Boolean method, but -- like I said, it's, you know, a name, a year or an event.",
        "Carly: Oh. Do you think that maybe somebody could go through the footage and give it a look?",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Kim: I'm sorry, but do you have any idea what you're asking here? We do an hour of news every night of the week, every week of the year. And frankly, we just don't have the time or the resources to have somebody searching through 10 years or 20 years of footage looking for a blurry picture of a woman. You know, until you can find out something more, it'd be like looking for a needle in a haystack.",

        "Casey: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Gwen: It means I gave him away, genius! But why do you care? Why couldn't you have been here when you could have done something about it? When you could've made a difference? When I needed you, you couldn't be bothered. You show up now, demanding answers?",

        "Meg: And how about the baby's mother? Do you feel connected to her?",
        "Dusty: Whatever. I'm just saying I feel very different now.",
        "Meg: Well, whenever I've assisted at births, it always does feel like a miracle.",
        "Dusty: I hope he makes it. He's very little. He's got this funny little red mark on the back of his neck.",
        "Meg: Well, you don't need to worry about that. That's called a stork bite. It's just a birthmark that fades after a few months.",
        "Dusty: Good. I wasn't worried. I gotta go back to the hospital. See what's going on. Thanks for listening to my delivery story.",

        "Will: Absolutely. Why not?",
        "Jennifer: He's just so little.",
        "Will: Yeah, but he's got our genes. And that makes him a survivor.",
        "Jennifer: You really think so? Well, we have -- we have made it through some rough patches, haven't we?",
        "Will: Yeah. But we can get lucky now and then. I mean take the kid, for example. What's his name?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I haven't named him yet. I was waiting to see --",
        "Will: You know what? I've got first dibs on his nickname, okay? Lucky. 'Cause he's gotta be a lucky kid if he gets to have a mom like you.",

        "Kim: Well, she does have her secrets, doesn't she? Do you have any idea, I mean, why she might be involved?",
        "Carly: No. No, except that I think she was working at the clinic at the same time that this scandal happened.",
