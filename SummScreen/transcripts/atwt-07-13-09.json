        "Alison confronts Larry about what a terrible thing he did and how she will never forgive him, as Larry tries to defend himself. Emily finds Hunter hidden under the covers of his bed in his disheveled room, as she pleads with him to simply join her for lunch (leaving out who else will be there). He finally agrees, as Emily calls Alison to ask her to lunch as well because Susan will be there too. Alison tells Larry what Emily told her and he insists on going too, much to Alison's chagrin. Once at lunch, Hunter is not sure he is keen on hanging out with everyone and becomes angry and bitter when he learns his connection to Larry and decides he wants nothing to do with any of them, as he stomps off. Susan can't believe how Hunter is related to them and how Larry betrayed her again. Meanwhile, Alison goes after Hunter, as Larry, Susan and an anxious Emily stay behind. Larry ridiculously tries to defend himself again and winds up on the business end of Susan's knee to a sensitive area. Alison catches up with Hunter, who is pretty sure that he can't handle this newfound weird connection to them all, but Alison promises him that they may not have the relationship he was hoping for, but she could use a brother. She also promises that this may be very strange, but when the chips are down, they are the people that will be in his corner. Alison convinces Hunter to go back to lunch with her where Emily, Alison and Susan welcome into their family. Rosanna asks Jack for his help with Carly, while Janet is not pleased at all that Jack is smack dab in the middle of this again. Carly wants out of the hospital, as Jack and Rosanna arrive promising that the only way she will get better is to admit she has a drinking problem. Carly won't hear any of it and wants Craig to side with her. The doctor agrees to release Carly, as Craig tries to get her to see that she does need help. Carly pleads with him desperately not to send her away and begs him to stay with her and be the one to get her through this. She asks him to take her away without telling anyone, and Craig finally relents. Up at a cabin, Carly is overjoyed and thrilled to be with Craig, as he admits that she taught him how to love unconditionally and that he is a better man because of her. They make love and afterwards, Carly wants to make dinner, but when she finds cooking wine in the cupboards, she doesn't tell Craig and sends him to the store for pasta. with promises of making him a romantic dinner. Once he leaves, Carly hesitates for a while, but then finds herself drinking the entire bottle of wine. Craig calls Janet to have her call Jack and Rosanna to let them know that Carly is fine, and they will be home when he gets her through this. When Janet tells Jack, he snaps at her annoyed that she doesn't know where Craig took her. Janet is aggravated that Jack continues to put her after Carly. Jack goes home after her and asks her to have patience, but Janet admits that she is fresh out; she didn't sign up for this ongoing drama and she won't live like this forever. Carly is finishing up the bottle of wine when she hears Craig come home, so she hightails it out of the room. An unsuspecting Craig comes in and is worried when he can't find Carly anywhere."

        "Emily: Hunter's probably not even here. He said he was catching a bus out of town. I'm sorry, could you please hurry up?",
        "Landlord: It's got to be one of these.",
        "Emily: I just hope there's something -- something that tells me where he's gone.",
        "Landlord: What's your relationship with this Hunter kid, again?",
        "Emily: Uh, he's my, uh -- we're business partners. I'm sorry, could you please hurry up? This is sort of urgent.",
        "Landlord: Well, he should've returned his keys. He's not getting a security deposit back.",
        "Emily: Well, I don't think he wants it back. Okay? He wasn't planning on coming back.",
        "Landlord: Ah.",
        "Emily: Oh, good.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Landlord: Oh, I got to take this.",
        "Emily: All right, fine. You take that, and I'll go inside. I promise, I won't touch a thing, and I'll lock the door on the way out. Thank you. Oh. Oh! Hunter?!",
        "Hunter: Go away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Larry: Alison. Good morning. Nice to see you so bright and early. Makes me feel at home.",
        "Alison: This isn't a social call. How could you?!",
        "Larry: What have I done now? No, seriously, what's the matter?",
        "Alison: You fathered a child -- a son that you have ignored your whole life -- and now you're acting like you know nothing about it?!",
        "Larry: All right, hold on just one second.",
        "Alison: No! You come back into my life, and you say that you want to have a relationship with me!",
        "Larry: Yes, I do, and that hasn't changed. That will never change.",
        "Alison: No, you do the whole song and dance that you want to make it up to me for being such a lousy father! Am I really supposed to believe that now? Am I supposed to believe that you really care about me?!",
        "Larry: Yes, I care about you, because I love you.",
        "Alison: You've never loved anyone but yourself. All you do is use people.",
        "Larry: That is not true!",
        "Alison: Your ugly secrets have ruined everything. Everything. And I will never forgive you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly moans]",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "Craig: Hey, it's all right. You okay?",
        "Carly: No, I'm not.",
        "Craig: You still feel sick?",
        "Carly: I feel terrible.",
        "Craig: I'm not surprised. They had to pump your stomach so you wouldn't get alcohol poisoning.",
        "Carly: Oh, God.",
        "Craig: You took off in the limo and cleaned out the mini-bar.",
        "Carly: Craig -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Craig: I know. It's okay. The worst is over now. It's going to get better from here on out. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: Well, did you get Sage off to camp okay?",
        "Jack: Once she got on the bus with all her friends, she waved at me and never looked back. It looked like she was going to have a blast.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. She deserves it.",
        "Jack: Yeah. And, honestly, I'm kind of glad she's getting out of town for a while. She's got to concentrate on being a kid again. She shouldn't have to worry about her mother.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, Parker's already been on the phone twice to the hospital.",
        "Jack: Really? Any changes?",
        "Janet: Apparently, she's well enough to be released later, and Craig is with her.",
        "Jack: Well, that doesn't exactly put my mind at ease. But, you know what, Craig's the least of my problems right now. I just got to protect Parker.",
        "Janet: I know. I managed to convince him that his mother would not need him today, so I told him to take advantage the farm while he's here. And he went horseback riding with Liberty.",
        "Jack: Well, thank you.",
        "Janet: Aw, it's the least I could do.",
        "Jack: No, no, it's not. I know how you feel about Parker and Liberty hanging out together.",
        "Janet: I know, I know, I know, but they are family, after all. And you know, he really needs a friend right now. So who knows? Maybe enough time has passed where they can be friends.",
        "Jack: I certainly hope so.",
        "Janet: This could be good for both of them.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right.",
        "[Vehicle door closes]",
        "Jack: Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey. Come on in.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Rosanna: Well, um, I need your help. Carly's getting out of the hospital, and she's in a bad way.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure there's that much I can do.",
        "Rosanna: She needs you, Jack. Now more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I thought we were going to lose you.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. But I swear to you, it'll never happen again.",
        "Craig: I should have known that this was too much for you to handle right now.",
        "Carly: No, please don't do that. None of this is your fault, Craig.",
        "Craig: I should have insisted that we wait. I knew there were too many unresolved issues for you. But, I promise you, we're going to get you the help you need.",
        "Carly: You're all I need. If I have you, I know I'll be fine.",
        "Craig: I'll be here for you, Carly. I promise, I'll always take care of you.",
        "Carly: You don't know how good it feels to hear you say that.",
        "Craig: You can count on it.",
        "Carly: Good. Get me out of here. I want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: We need to get Carly into a program. Thank you. Not just meetings where she can drop in and out. She needs to go to rehab.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: So we have to be really strong on this. We can't let her talk her way out of it this time.",
        "Janet: Hold on, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, \"We\"? Jack and Carly aren't married anymore. His responsibility is to the children. That's it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, yeah, maybe legally, but then you were married for a very long time. They shared a life together. Their children aren't exactly a separate issue. I mean, Carly's well-being is important to the children, so it should be important to Jack, too.",
        "Jack: Of course it's important to me, Rosanna.",
        "Janet: Jack isn't Carly's keeper.",
        "Jack: Listen, I know you don't like me being pulled back into Carly's craziness, but this time, Janet -- come on -- it's different. What do you need me to do?",
        "Rosanna: I just need you to come with me to the hospital and make sure that Carly goes into a rehab.",
        "Jack: All right, I will be there. Janet. Just give us a minute, please, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah, sure. And thank you.",
        "Jack: Janet, look. You and I both know that Carly is not going to agree to going into a rehab without putting up one hell of a fight. Now, listen, the kids are upset. They are. And what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to throw my hands up in the air and let Carly sink or swim? What kind of message is that sending?",
        "Janet: You are a great father. And you have to do what is right. But I can't help but feel that Carly's problems are a bottomless pit!",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I'm not going to get swallowed up! I promise!",
        "Janet: Oh, my God! You say that every time! And then Mt. Carly erupts, and Jack is never seen or heard from again!",
        "Jack: Believe me, the last thing I want to do today is go to the hospital and deal with Carly's stuff! But the one way I'm going to get through it is knowing that I have you to come home to. That makes it so much easier for me, knowing that I have a loving, caring, understanding, sane wife. I don't know what do without you.",
        "Janet: Mmm. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay, is this purely psychological, or are you not -- you look terrible. Oh, my word, are you --",
        "Hunter: Don't touch me.",
        "Emily: Do you have a fever? You feel clammy. When was the last time you ate something?",
        "Hunter: I don't remember.",
        "Emily: Okay, that's it. I'm getting you something to eat right away.",
        "Hunter: Don't bother.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not going to let you faint on top of everything else.",
        "Hunter: Stop trying to act like my mother!",
        "Emily: It's not an act! Okay? Whether you like it or not, I'm your mother.",
        "Hunter: I don't like it! I hate it!",
        "Emily: Well, too bad! You got to deal with it!",
        "Hunter: No, I don't have to deal with it! There may be some kind of freaky biological connection between us, but I don't need another mother and I don't want anything to do with you! So just leave!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Larry: Aurora Hunter was desperate to have a child. She couldn't get pregnant. She tried every procedure. Nothing worked.",
        "Alison: So, why not try stealing someone else's baby?",
        "Larry: That's not exactly what we did.",
        "Alison: Yes, it is!",
        "Larry: Look -- after she got pregnant, but before she delivered the baby, she told me to stay away. She said she didn't want me to have any part in her son's life.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. And we all know how tough it is to convince you to give up your parental rights.",
        "Larry: All right, yes, yes, yes, you're right. I wasn't there for him. I regret that. But there were other people's feelings to consider here. What about your mother?",
        "Alison: My mother? Since when have you ever, ever cared about her feelings?! You treated her horribly! You lied to her! You lied to my sister, to all of us for my entire life! It's sick!",
        "Larry: Yes, I wish I had done things differently. But it wasn't entirely selfish. Look, I helped to create a life. It was the longtime dream of Hunter's mother. She loved him, and I know that Hunter loved her. That's not a bad thing, Alison.",
        "Alison: Didn't you ever want to meet him?",
        "Larry: Of course I did, all the time! Now that Aurora is gone, maybe finally I have a chance to get to know him. My hope is it's not too late to make things right with you and Hunter both.",
        "Alison: Are you insane?",
        "Larry: No. Listen, you have to believe me!",
        "Alison: I can't even look at you! I'm serious! And -- and the chance of getting to know Hunter, well, that is just -- that's a lost cause.",
        "Larry: Why?",
        "Alison: Because, when he found out, he freaked and took off. He's gone.",
        "Larry: Gone where?",
        "Alison: I don't know. It's not like he was telling anybody where he was going.",
        "Larry: We have to find him.",
        "Alison: We?",
        "Larry: Yes. We have to go look for him together.",
        "Alison: Why would I want to help you find Hunter?",
        "Larry: Alison, we are connected to him. He's alone. The woman who raised him -- his mother who raised him is dead. He needs his family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Did you ask about getting my release papers?",
        "Craig: Well, there's no rush. The doctor hasn't come in to see you yet.",
        "Carly: I don't need to see the doctor. I'm fine. I just want to go home and see my kids.",
        "Craig: And your kids are fine. Sage is off to camp. Parker's staying at the farm. You need to take care of yourself now.",
        "Carly: Which I can do at home.",
        "Rosanna: Hey! You look so much better!",
        "Carly: Thank you. What are you two doing here?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, we just thought we would stop by to cheer you up, right?",
        "Carly: Well, you didn't need to bring those. I'm not staying.",
        "Craig: We're just waiting to hear what the doctor has to say.",
        "Carly: He'll say that I can go home. What else would he say?",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, Carly, you've -- you've been through a lot.",
        "Carly: And I've learned my lesson.",
        "Jack: What does that mean, exactly?",
        "Carly: It means that it won't happen again. I was stressed out. I let myself get overwhelmed with all the details of the wedding, and I didn't -- I didn't realize what I was doing.",
        "Rosanna: That's just not the case. I mean, Craig was the one who took care of all the details of the wedding, not you.",
        "Carly: Well, being a bride can be nerve-racking enough, Rosanna, as you ought to know.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I know. Can we -- let's just tell the truth here, can we?",
        "Carly: And what truth is that?",
        "Rosanna: You're an alcoholic, Carly. And you need to get help if you want to stop drinking.",
        "Carly: You're my sister. I don't need you coming in here and calling me names.",
        "Rosanna: Honey, that's not what I'm doing.",
        "Carly: You put her up to this, didn't you?",
        "Jack: We're here because we care about you, Carly.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: We're worried.",
        "Carly: You told her that I was a -- a lost cause, right, and she believed you?",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, if I believed that you were a lost cause, I wouldn't even be here. Rosanna asked me to come along because she thought she might need help convincing you to go into treatment.",
        "Carly: I don't -- I don't need treatment, Craig. Would you tell them?",
        "Craig: Carly -- they're right. You do need help.",
        "Carly: I -- I don't believe that you're turning on me, too.",
        "Craig: I'm not turning on you. I'm standing by you.",
        "Carly: Not five minutes ago, you said that you would do anything you could for me. Now you're going to walk away when I need you? Why would you do that?",
        "Craig: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is, if you're siding with them. You're -- you're all in this together. You want to punish me. Well, I'm not going to let you do that. I'm not going to let you run my life!",
        "Craig: Carly --",
        "Carly: I won't! No, get off me!",
        "Craig: Carly, calm down. You can't just walk out of the hospital until the doctor examines you.",
        "Carly: That's ridiculous. I'm not sick. I'm fine.",
        "Craig: It's just procedure. And then we can sign the release forms, okay?",
        "Carly: Do you mean that? Or are you just stalling so these two can drag me off to rehab?",
        "Rosanna: That's not -- we're here because we love you, because you have a disease, and all you have to do is admit it if you want to get well again.",
        "Carly: You want me to feel ashamed. I won't do that.",
        "Jack: We want you to get better. And one way to start is to think about the people who are counting on you, Carly. Think about what this is doing to Parker and Sage, seeing their mother go through this.",
        "Carly: Are they okay?",
        "Jack: Parker's -- he's fine. He's coping. And Sage will be better off at camp this summer. She needed to get away.",
        "Carly: Camp will be good for her. And Parker -- I -- I know he'll be all right.",
        "Jack: He's worried about you, though. So is Sage. Wouldn't you like to show her that you're doing the right thing and you're taking care of yourself while she's away, huh? Wouldn't you like to be 100% when she gets home?",
        "Carly: I'm going to be fine.",
        "Jack: Not if you don't get the help you need!",
        "Carly: Oh, don't tell me what I need.",
        "Craig: Okay, why don't we all just take a breath, okay?",
        "Carly: I just want to get out of here, please! Finally.",
        "Craig: Great. Why don't we ask the doctor what he thinks about you going home?",
        "Doctor: Everything all right here?",
        "Carly: Oh, it will be, as soon as you give me the okay to get out of here.",
        "Doctor: If you don't mind waiting outside --",
        "Craig: Carly was feeling pretty ganged up on. I'm not sure it's good to push her into a corner like that.",
        "Rosanna: Well, she has to admit that she has a problem.",
        "Jack: Rosanna's right. She's in denial, Craig, and that's not healthy. You want to do what's best for her, right?",
        "Craig: Of course I do.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then you have to make sure that she gets herself into a rehab.",
        "Jack: Why don't -- why don't you see to her release from here? Rosanna and I will do some research. We'll find a facility that can take Carly right away and start making preliminary arrangements. But we all have to be together on this. If we are, then I'm pretty sure that Carly will see that this is for the best. She has got to get better for her children.",
        "Craig: I agree.",
        "Jack: Good. We'll get the ball rolling. You bring Carly back to her place, and then we can take it from there.",
        "Rosanna: And no matter what she says, you know what she needs, don't you?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Jack: Good. We'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not going to push this whole mother-son thing down your throat.",
        "Hunter: Then why do you keep bringing it up?",
        "Emily: Look, it -- it -- okay, look, the only thing I would love from you is just to be your friend, nothing more than that.",
        "Hunter: Whatever.",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay, so, uh, as your friend, I don't want you to starve to death?",
        "Hunter: You're not going to drop this, are you?",
        "Emily: My buying you a sandwich will not lock you into a lifetime commitment. How about that?",
        "Hunter: Really? You know, because if I go out with you, I do not want to spend the whole time talking about this amazing, new connection that we have.",
        "Emily: Okay. All right, no problem. I'll -- I'll go while you finish getting dressed. Okay. Oh, I need reinforcements.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Alison: I have to take this. Hey.",
        "Emily: I found Hunter. He didn't take off.",
        "Alison: You're kidding. Where is he?",
        "Emily: In his room, in bed, with the covers pulled over his head. Apparently, he's not handling things very well.",
        "Alison: Can you blame him?",
        "Emily: Uh, no. I convinced him to let me take him out for a bite to eat. I didn't want him to starve to death on top of everything else.",
        "Alison: I am so glad you found him. I was really getting worried.",
        "Emily: Yeah, me too. I called Mom and asked her to join us.",
        "Alison: You really think Hunter's ready for that?",
        "Emily: Well, better now than never. Listen, do you mind coming along, Honey? It might make things a little easier.",
        "Alison: I doubt seeing me will help.",
        "Emily: You have to. I mean, the most important thing is to make him see that he's not alone.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll go. I'll be there.",
        "Emily: Thanks, Ali, thanks. We'll be at the Lakeview. We're leaving now.",
        "Alison: All right. I'll see you there.",
        "Larry: Alison? Alison! What's going on?",
        "Alison: Emily found Hunter. She's taking him out to lunch with the family.",
        "Larry: Well, in that case, I should be there. Don't you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: Hi. I didn't know you were bringing a guest.",
        "Emily: Yeah, Ali's coming, too.",
        "Susan: Oh.",
        "Hunter: What? I thought it was just you and me.",
        "Emily: Sit down, Hunter.",
        "Susan: I thought it was just going to be family. Why did you bring somebody from the office?",
        "Emily: Actually, Hunter's not just a colleague. We're lot closer than that.",
        "Susan: Oh, I hope this doesn't mean what I think it means.",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Susan: If you didn't learn your lesson with Casey --",
        "Emily: It's not that. Trust me.",
        "Susan: What is it?",

        "Hunter: Join the club.",

        "Craig: I want to, Carly. But I also believed that you were sober before the wedding, and you weren't.",
        "Carly: Don't treat me like everybody else does. I can get through this if you have faith in me.",
        "Craig: I believe that you're serious about getting well, but I don't think you can do it on your own.",
        "Carly: But I won't be on my own. I'll have you. You'll help me, won't you? You always say we can do anything together.",

        "Carly: No, you won't. If you send me off to some rehab, they'll separate us. They'll cut me off from everybody I love. They'll put me through hell. And I -- I won't be able to take that. Craig, I admit that I have a problem. And if you love me, you can help me fix it. You can get me through it.",
        "Craig: Carly, I love you. I want what's best for you. But most of all, I want you to get well.",
        "Carly: If you mean that, then take me away, Craig. We don't have to tell anybody where we're going, and we can stay there until I'm better.",

        "Craig: Oh, I know it's isolated, but don't worry, I'll be here the whole time. You be safe.",
        "Carly: I'm not worried. I'm happy. You bringing me here was the most thoughtful thing you could have done for me.",

        "Craig: Really? Guess I picked the right one.",
        "Carly: I guess you did.",
        "Craig: Actually, I did it for the both of us. Getting away together is something I thought we've needed for a while.",
        "Carly: Yeah, and you know, technically, we're not married, this does to feel a bit like a honeymoon, doesn't it?",
        "Craig: You're right. Maybe I should get a little atmosphere going then, huh? Feel like a fire?",
        "Carly: I'd love it.",

        "Carly: Obviously, more than you. I hope that doesn't hurt your pride.",
        "Craig: My pride is not an issue when I'm with you. You've already taught me something much more important.",
        "Carly: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Craig: How to love unconditionally, unselfishly. How to want someone else's happiness more than my own. Loving you has made me a better man.",

        "Rosanna: Oh, I have been saying that all along.",
        "Jack: I just -- I guess I just wanted to believe it, for Carly's sake. But how could it be good for Carly if Craig deliberately ignores what she's been doing?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, even worse than that, he's been covering for her.",
        "Jack: It's no wonder she got so drunk at the wedding, 'cause on some level, she knew that marrying Craig was a big mistake.",
        "Rosanna: That means it's even more dangerous that she's with him now. I just hope that he brings her home before it's too late.",

        "Carly: No, it's -- it's too late for breakfast. Maybe there's something here I can make. There's tomato sauce. Fava beans. I could make some pasta if there is any. No, no pasta.",
        "Craig: Well, there's a general store at the turnaround. Why don't we go get some?",
        "Carly: Um, why don't you go ahead? And I'll start that sauce.",

        "Carly: No, I'm sick of the car. Really, what is this? You don't -- you don't trust me? There's no alcohol here.",
        "Craig: Sorry. I didn't want to make you feel like a prisoner.",
        "Carly: You don't have to worry. This place is too remote for me to get in trouble. You go ahead. You get the pasta, and I'll have the sauce simmering when you get back.",

        "Craig: Everything's fine. But if by \"Over there\" you mean at Carly's, we're not there.",
        "Janet: I thought that you were going to take her out of the hospital and then put her into rehab.",
        "Craig: Yeah, that was the original plan, but we decided to do things differently.",
        "Janet: What do you mean?",
        "Craig: It means we're taking care of it ourselves. I've taken Carly away, and I'm going to make sure that she's not drinking.",

        "Craig: I'm positive.",
        "Janet: Did you tell Jack and Rosanna?",

        "Susan: Oh, it is. I'm so sorry. I -- I -- I can't tell you how happy I am that I have another grandson. And you never told me!",
        "Larry: I had to keep my word to Aurora. Look, uh -- this may be hard for you to hear -- for all of you to hear. I cared a great deal for your mother. She was a wonderful woman. And after all this time, I'd be honored if you would allow me to be a father to you, as well as to Alison. We're family.",

        "Hunter: This will never feel normal for me.",
        "Alison: You'd be surprised how you can adapt to a situation when you have no other choice.",
        "Hunter: But I do have a choice. I can ignore the whole thing.",
        "Alison: That's true, but it won't change anything. And as weird as this is, it's -- it's given you something that you didn't have before -- a family.",
        "Hunter: That's really not what I wanted from you, Alison.",
        "Alison: I know. But now I'm your sister, and that's just the way it is. So look on the bright side. At least we didn't --",
        "Hunter: Oh, could we please not talk about that?",
        "Alison: For what it's worth, I -- I really wasn't ready for a new boyfriend, but I could use a brother.",

        "Larry: Look, I know I have done many things wrong. All I can do is apologize sincerely, and I have done that. Don't I deserve something in return?",

        "Janet: Hey! And that would have worked why? Don't shoot the messenger, okay?! I got in my car and I drove all the way down here because I thought this was news you should hear in person! Don't jump down my throat!",
