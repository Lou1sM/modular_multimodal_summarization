        "Gabriel: Oh, no. Don't do it like that. Try to go with the grain there. There you go.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Parker. Wow. When was this delivered?",
        "Liberty: It wasn't. Gabriel built it.",
        "Janet: It looks so professional.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. Well, it's 'cause I'm getting paid.",
        "Liberty: And he measured it so it'll fit, like, perfectly -- perfectly in the corner of my room.",
        "Janet: Okay. You know what? If Al's ever needs a makeover, I'm gonna have them call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Any word on Barbara Ryan? Nothing? No, don't put out an APB yet. I know Barbara. She's got a quirky side, and that's putting it mildly. So if her son thinks she's missing, it probably means she just took a vacation and didn't tell anybody. Hey, give me a call as soon as you find anything out, okay? Thanks. What are you doing? Get a bowl.",
        "Parker: My bad.",
        "Jack: So, what have you got planned for today?",
        "Parker: Nothing.",
        "Jack: Nothing? How about looking for a summer job?",
        "Parker: That's been my summer job so far, looking for one.",
        "Jack: I have a suggestion.",
        "Parker: Let me guess -- look harder.",
        "Jack: You read my mind.",
        "Parker: Dad, have you watched the news lately? Because the unemployment rate, seriously, it's ridiculous.",
        "Jack: You can't just loaf around all summer until school starts again in the fall.",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Jack: The computer. Find a job-hunting website. Type in \"Seasonal employment\" and \"Oakdale.\" You'll find something. Give it a shot, okay?",
        "Parker: Fine.",
        "Jack: Good luck.",
        "Parker: [Sighs]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Parker: Hello? Yeah. This is Parker Snyder. Excuse me? Yeah. Yeah, I'd definitely be interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, what's French for \"Nice to meet you\"?",
        "Lily: \"Enchant\u00e9.\"",
        "Carly: Yes, that's it. You're perfect. I love working with you. Hey, are you bringing a sweater?",
        "Lily: No. I checked the weather. It's gonna be hot.",
        "Carly: Well, you never know.",
        "Lily: Carly, it's New York City in July.",
        "Carly: Oh, I know. I'm probably over packing, but I just want to be prepared, especially for our meeting with Fran\u00e7oise.",
        "Lily: I can't believe that in a few hours we're gonna be in her office, signing the contract.",
        "Carly: I know. We are gonna be international businesswomen with our very own fragrance line.",
        "Lily: I'm so excited about this.",
        "Carly: And we get to celebrate in New York!",
        "Lily: I'm so happy that you are able to take some more time away from home.",
        "Carly: Well, Sage is at camp, and Parker's at the farm with Jack. So it's perfect. Lily, I'll call you when I'm ready to go to the airport, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay. See you soon, Partner. Carly is 100% on board.",
        "Craig: Well, congratulations, Partner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You said Craig wasn't around. So why can't Johnny spend the day with me? I know you're just a babysitter, Maggie. Guess I got no choice, then.",
        "Janet: That's not the face of a happy man.",
        "Dusty: I can't believe this guy.",
        "Janet: Gee, let me guess -- Craig?",
        "Dusty: He told the babysitter not to let Johnny anywhere near me.",
        "Janet: What? Why would he do that?",
        "Dusty: Payback.",
        "Janet: For what?",
        "Dusty: Well, Craig wanted to buy into Worldwide. I set the price so high he couldn't meet it. Now he's keeping my son away from me.",
        "Janet: Oh, Dusty, that's awful.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Even worse, he somehow came up with the buying money anyway.",
        "Janet: So let me get this straight. He still won't let you see Johnny?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh, Dusty, I wish there was something I could do to help.",
        "Dusty: I don't think anyone can help me with this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, mon amie, Fran\u00e7oise. You know how I like le bonne nouvelle particularly when I'm in the office. So please don't disappoint me.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Everything is set. The meeting is confirmed, and the final contract has been draw.",
        "Lucinda: Good. All right. Then let me know the moment my daughter leaves the office, 'cause I want to be there the first minute of the beginning of Craig Montgomery's destruction.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: So, you are certain you want to move forward with this?",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course I am. I'm haven't been able to put a plan like this in motion for a while.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: What about your daughter?",
        "Lucinda: What about my daughter?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: When all is said and done, she's going to receive quite a shock.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Well, of course, she'll be upset when she discovers she's bought a factory that doesn't exist, but that's okay. I'll find some way to make it up to her.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: And what if she never forgives you?",
        "Lucinda: Well, that won't happen, because she'll never know that I was behind this. Will she, Fran\u00e7oise?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: If I may ask, risking your relationship with your daughter like this, you really hate Craig Montgomery that much?",
        "Lucinda: My friend, look. It's a matter of simple justice. That man deserves everything that's coming to him.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: He must have done terrible things to you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, repeatedly, and with relish. Well, once this contract is signed, my daughter's secret partner will end up irreversibly, I hope, in bankruptcy. [Sighs] And all will be well with the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Right. You want to make sure that item is changed in the final version, and don't sign this until you read it all the way through.",
        "Lily: I won't.",
        "Craig: Otherwise, you're just asking for trouble.",
        "Lily: You're making it look like I've never done a business deal in my life.",
        "Craig: It's the first deal you've made with my money on the line.",
        "Lily: Don't worry.",
        "Craig: We're not talking about pocket change here, Lily. This is a major investment for me.",
        "Lily: Carly and I are gonna make money, not lose it.",
        "Craig: Promise?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Everything we're doing is pointing towards success. We've got a great product, we've got a terrific promotional concept, and now we have established ally in Fran\u00e7oise.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Are you sure you trust her? She has done business with your mother.",
        "Lily: That's why I trust her. When my mother pushed, she pushed back. She's got guts. She's not afraid to take a stand.",
        "Craig: Or she has a death wish.",
        "Lily: Craig, look. I know that you have reasons not to trust my mother, but in this situation, I guarantee she will not interfere.",
        "Craig: What makes you so sure?",
        "Lily: As unscrupulous as my mother is dealing with you, she would never, ever do anything to hurt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, hello, there.",
        "Carly: Hi, Jack. I'm sorry that I can't talk, 'cause I'm busy. I'm packing, and I have to call Lily, and I have to get to the airport. If I don't get to the airport, I'm gonna miss the plane. It's the only plane that's gonna get me -- what's wrong?",
        "Jack: Nothing that I can see.",
        "Carly: Oh! Oh. You like the outfit?",
        "Jack: Do I like -- obviously, this is the outfit you're wearing to the contract signing?",
        "Carly: That's the plan. Unless -- unless it's too much, 'cause I -- is it?",
        "Jack: No. I'd sign a contract to sell my soul if you walked in looking like this. Carly --",
        "Carly: Jack, if you came by just to tell me how absolutely stunning I am, mission accomplished, but I really do have to get going.",
        "Jack: Actually, there is something else I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "Carly: What -- what is it?",
        "Jack: I think we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, that's it. We're done.",
        "Liberty: Now what?",
        "Gabriel: I'm gonna go to the barn, get some rags, wipe this baby down, and then paint it.",
        "Liberty: Sweet.",
        "Gabriel: Okay.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Parker: You guys ready for this? I got a job.",
        "Faith: Are you serious? That's awesome!",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, not technically, because it's a job offer, but --",
        "Liberty: Doing what?",
        "Parker: A TV commercial.",
        "Liberty: Get out of here!",
        "Parker: Yeah, no. It's for a sportswear line, tennis stuff, and they're filming it today, and they want me to be in it.",
        "Liberty: Parker, that's so cool!",
        "Parker: I know, and, I mean, talk about good timing. My dad's been on my case to get a job for a while now, and then, boom, my phone rings. I mean, also, it's only for one day, but it's gonna pay enough, as if I was to, like, mow lawns for an entire summer. This is awesome.",
        "Liberty: Gosh, I'm so happy for you! Aah!",
        "Faith: Our TV star.",
        "Parker: Okay. So, I need to go get the okay from my parents. So I should go do that.",
        "Liberty: Well, where are they shooting the commercial?",
        "Parker: Oakdale Country Club.",
        "Faith: I have a great idea.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Gabriel: What's this about a commercial?",
        "Liberty: Oh, Parker's doing one for TV.",
        "Gabriel: You mean dressed up, like, in a giant wiener costumer or something, right?",
        "Liberty: No, as an actor.",
        "Gabriel: [Laughs] You're talking about that guy?",
        "Liberty: He's good!",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. If you put Parker in a commercial, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna sell anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Now, I know Parker's incredibly frustrated not being able to find work. If only he hadn't given up on that summer study program in New York.",
        "Jack: Oh, please. Let's not go back there.",
        "Carly: Well, that was a bad decision, and I know you encouraged it.",
        "Jack: No. That is not -- we had been over this. He came to me, and he was very clear about what he wanted to do.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: There is another option, however. Will said that he and Gwen would love to have Parker come to Carbondale for the summer.",
        "Carly: Are there a lot more jobs to be had in Carbondale?",
        "Jack: What do I know about Carbondale?",
        "Parker: Hey. Mom, Dad, you're not gonna believe what just happened.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Parker: I'm gonna be in a commercial, a TV commercial, and it films today.",
        "Carly: Wait. Just slow down. What are the details?",
        "Parker: Well, an ad agency just called me. I got a call from them, and they're filming a commercial at Oakdale Country Club.",
        "Jack: What, for golf?",
        "Parker: No, no, for tennis. It's a whole new sportswear line, and they said that the job was mine!",
        "Jack: Parker, that's fantastic.",
        "Carly: Wait. How did the agency know to call you?",
        "Parker: Well, the account executive, he saw some of the photo work that I did for Midday Sun water.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "Parker: And all we need is an okay from you guys, and I'm good to go, and it films today.",
        "Jack: Okay. Wait -- wait a second. This is a new line of clothes. Don't you think Craig could be involved?",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Believe me, Craig is completely out of the rag trade now. Trust me on that.",
        "Parker: Hello. Guys, did I mention that it films today? So you're gonna let me do it, right?",
        "Carly: Oh. No, Sweetheart. I'm sorry. You can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Carly said she would call when she was packed and ready to leave. What is taking her so long?",
        "Craig: Relax. Carly runs on Carly time.",
        "Lily: What does that mean?",
        "Craig: That means she'll wait until the last moment and then arrive in the nick of time and dazzle when she does.",
        "Lily: You lied to me.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: I asked you if you were still in love with Carly, and you said no, but you are.",
        "Craig: Pbht! Who uses words like \"Love\" anymore?",
        "Lily: I do, when they fit.",
        "Craig: I have great respect and admiration for Carly.",
        "Lily: Hmm. And it's nothing more than that? You're risking an awful lot of money to get her back on her feet.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but the two of you are gonna make me money. This whole thing's about profit. Don't forget that.",
        "Lily: And beyond that, you don't care about Carly?",
        "Craig: Oh, I care. I just care about myself more.",
        "Lily: How so?",
        "Craig: Well, let me tell you. When I was in jail, Gabriel came to see me one night. It might have been day. It's hard to tell when you're in jail. The point is, he looked at me with such hatred and disgust, I had the uncanny realization that I might be looking at myself. He does have my eyes, you know.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I've noticed that, actually.",
        "Craig: Being in a cell gives you a lot of time to think, and I thought about that moment with Gabriel, and I had to face the fact that I am a very selfish man. I've done some terrible things to people. And then I was released, and I came up from the darkness, into the sunshine. You know, sometimes a good metaphor's all you need to remind yourself that you've been given a second chance.",
        "Lily: You're reinventing yourself.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm trying to, anyway. Then again, maybe jail just made me delusional.",
        "Lily: Oh. I think this is a great step forward.",
        "Craig: You do?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I've been wanting to reinvent myself for quite a while, put all my regrets and mistakes behind me. I mean, that's why I'm so excited about this project. It's a chance for me to start over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Lucinda, you got a great head for business, but this time, you screwed up.",
        "Lucinda: Talking about Craig?",
        "Dusty: This guy's making my life hell.",
        "Lucinda: What's he done now?",
        "Dusty: He won't let me see my son.",
        "Lucinda: [Sighs] So much. So much! With a pledge that this is strictly business.",
        "Dusty: He's out of control.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it won't last.",
        "Dusty: Why? You know something?",
        "Lucinda: No. I mean -- I just know that things tend to end badly for Craig Montgomery, and I have a sense -- entre nous -- that it's gonna happen to him again, very soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I'll be right back! Johnny! Hi, Sweetie! Oh, I missed you so much! I missed you, missed you! Hi, Maggie. It's good to see you.",
        "Maggie: It's been a while.",
        "Janet: I know. Well, Dusty and I are on different schedules, but that doesn't mean I'm still not attached to this kid right here.",
        "Maggie: I think he feels the same way. He talks about you all the time.",
        "Janet: Oh! Hey! I have an idea. Why don't you come to lunch at Al's? We have your favorite today, chicken nuggets.",
        "Maggie: Sorry. I have a few hours of errands to run.",
        "Johnny: Please, please, please, please!",
        "Janet: Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you go run your errands, leave Johnny with me at Al's to get some chicken nuggets, and then you can pick him up on the way back.",
        "Maggie: Well, I guess that would be okay.",
        "Janet: Great! Thanks, Maggie. See you later. Come on. Let's go get some chicken nuggets. There we go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: Hi. Are you hungry?",
        "Dusty: Not really.",
        "Janet: Well, drop whatever you're doing and come to Al's right now.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Janet: We've got a special today you won't want to miss. Hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What do you mean that I can't take the job?",
        "Carly: It's too last-minute.",
        "Parker: No, it's not. I can be at the country club with plenty of time for the shoot.",
        "Carly: Well, I can't. I have to be in New York today for business.",
        "Parker: Mom, I have to do this commercial. I already told them that I'd be there.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe they can reschedule it.",
        "Parker: No, no. The agency guy said that the crew's already there setting up.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry, Honey. It's just not gonna work out.",
        "Parker: Mom, they're gonna pay me $2,000. Dad has been on my case endlessly to get a job, and here a job just finds me all of a sudden, and you want me to blow it off?",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Let me talk to your mother for a minute. Go -- go into the kitchen and grab yourself something to drink, okay? Go. Go on. I think we should let him do this.",
        "Carly: Well, if it were any other day, I would, but if I can't be there with him, Parker's not taking the job.",
        "Jack: Oh, I see. This is about protecting Parker.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: See, this is where you and I butt heads. I think we have a different perception of what protection means.",
        "Carly: It means doing what's best for him.",
        "Jack: And what's best for him is having him turn down a very exciting, well- paying job because it doesn't fit into his mother's schedule?",
        "Carly: [Groans] Oh. I'll call Lily. She'll have to understand.",
        "Jack: You're canceling your trip?",
        "Carly: That's show biz.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: This is ridiculous. If Carly doesn't call in like two minutes --",
        "Craig: Told ya. Nick of time. Never fails.",
        "Lily: What? Are you trying to give me a heart attack?",
        "Carly: If it didn't happen already, it might now.",
        "Lily: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: I can't go to New York.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry, Lily.",
        "Lily: What? What about signing the contracts?",
        "Carly: You'll have to sign it yourself. It's just as binding with one signature.",
        "Lily: No, but it won't be the same without you there.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm disappointed, too, but Parker needs me.",
        "Lily: Is he all right?",
        "Carly: Well, he will be when he finds out I'm sticking around just tell me you're not mad at me, please.",
        "Lily: Of course I'm not. I mean, the kids come first. That's a given.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Lily: Look, we're gonna have lots of contracts to sign, because we're gonna be hugely successful.",
        "Carly: And that starts now. You go get 'em, Partner.",
        "Lily: I will. Talk to you later. [Sighs]",
        "Craig: I take it Carly can't make the trip.",
        "Lily: No, she can't, and I don't think I can, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Johnny: Daddy, have a nugget.",
        "Dusty: Thanks, Buddy. Where you sitting? All right, get over there. I'll be there in a second.",
        "Janet: Hey, sorry we started without you, but the little guy was very hungry.",
        "Dusty: You set this up?",
        "Janet: Anybody ever tell you you're very sexy when you smile?",

        "Gabriel: He has?",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm. His biggest job so far was for this drink called Midday Sun water. They put his picture on the label.",

        "Gabriel: Whatever. Whatever.",
        "Liberty: He's an awesome tennis player. That's how he got the job. And when they put his picture on that label, it was, like, all the kids in school were drinking Midday Sun water. They all wanted to be cool like Parker.",
        "Gabriel: No, no. Now, that's not possible, because Parker isn't cool.",
        "Liberty: Okay. How many labels has your picture been on?",

        "Craig: Well, you said yourself this isn't your first deal.",
        "Lily: It just kind of feels like it is. I'd call Fran\u00e7oise and cancel if it wasn't so important.",

        "Faith: You were incredible. I could never look like that on the tennis court.",
        "Parker: No. No, you totally could. Okay, let's try a serve first. So, I want you to take the racket, and you're gonna take the ball, and you're gonna throw the ball up in the air, and you're gonna hit it as it's coming down, okay? Okay. I think you need a little bit more focus and possibly the proper stance. So let's try that again, okay. Now I want you to loosen up your shoulders, okay?",

        "Fran\u00e7oise: You seem to understand him very well.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you know, it's not a case of familiarity breeding contempt. It's hatred. I despise him, and I adore what's happening to him.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: And you think he has no idea what's coming?",
        "Lucinda: No, absolutely not. That's what makes it all so delicious. He thinks now that he is the silent partner in Carlisle fragrances and he can pump money into the business and hope and hope and hope that he's gonna get his Carly back. Idiot.",

        "Lily: What? We can't spend the night in this place.",
        "Craig: Well, the idea is to be able to zip back to the terminal the moment the strike is settled. I mean, that's why they have airport hotels.",
        "Lily: This place is a dump.",
        "Craig: We're not moving in, for crying out loud. I mean, if we get a hotel in the city, there's no telling how long it'll take us to get back here.",
        "Lily: I don't think a taxi would take that long.",
        "Craig: The point is, once the flights are rescheduled, they'll be so backed up, we could be stuck here for three or four days.",
        "Lily: I'll call my mother and have her send the jet.",
        "Craig: And give Lucinda the satisfaction of bailing you out again. Way to reinvent yourself.",

        "Craig: Of course I did.",
