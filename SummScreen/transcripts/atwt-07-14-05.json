        "Jennifer: I guess.",

        "Rosanna: What's this? Has Santa come early?",
        "Craig: I guess I overdid it a little, you know, huh? It started with a couple of squeaky toys, and kind of grew from there.",
        "Rosanna: But why?",
        "Craig: Why not? I know I might've seemed a little less than ecstatic about the adoption routine.",
        "Rosanna: Definitely lukewarm.",
        "Craig: But, Rosanna, I'm happy. I'm really happy.",
        "Rosanna: About the adoption?",

        "Emily: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. He gets that way when he's hurt. Maybe I should leave.",
        "Paul: Hal has a choice -- he can either get used to seeing us together or he can leave.",
        "Emily: It's not that black and white, Paul.",
        "Paul: With Hal, everything's black and white. There's a cafeteria downstairs. Why don't you get something to eat?",

        "Will: Like you care.",
        "Paul: I do care. Okay, look, we're all a little tense and --",
        "Will: Paul, you hurt him. People lie and they cheat all the time, and all they think about is themselves.",

        "Henry: Does this beauty have a name?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sure she does. I just don't know what it is.",
        "Henry: Hmm, what's the date on this photo?",
        "Carly: I don't know that, either.",
        "Henry: Humph.",
        "Carly: So, could you ask around for me, Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, unfortunately, I'm analyzing traffic patterns these days. I'm a limo driver or as I prefer to call it -- transportation specialist.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, don't let me get in the way of your upward mobility.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. Tell you what, let me think about it, huh?",
        "Carly: All right. Well, you think, and I will scan this picture and get you a copy.",
        "Henry: I haven't agreed to anything.",
        "Carly: The only thing the Henry I know loves more than a dry martini is cold, hard cash.",
        "Henry: Well, lucky for you, the Henry you know is back. Why isn't hubby on the case?",
        "Carly: Well, he is, but you are the one with friends in low places.",
        "Henry: You flatter me.",
        "Carly: I'm just doubling my odds, Henry. Between you and Jack, this mystery can't stay a mystery for long. Ciao.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Iris, please, sit down. I'm not here to make trouble for you.",
        "Iris: Ray Tenney and that brat gave me a lifetime of trouble. I can't help you, Detective.",
        "Jack: I already know what happened.",
        "Iris: All of it? Did she tell you?",
        "Jack: No. She has no memory of it.",
        "Iris: Yeah, well, she's lying just like her old man.",
        "Jack: It's true. She doesn't remember anything from back then, not her father being here, not you, not your son. She found a picture of you and Ray together at a Founders Day celebration, and ever since she found it, she's been trying to locate you. She doesn't even remember your name, Iris.",
        "Iris: I have enough memories for all of us, none of 'em any good. So, what are we here to dance down memory lane?",
        "Jack: I don't want Carly to know what happened, and I need your help to keep her from finding out the truth.",
        "Iris: Why should I help you?",
        "Jack: I don't want Carly hurt.",
        "Iris: Who kept me from getting hurt?",
        "Jack: I know you must have gone through hell.",
        "Iris: You don't know what hell is.",
        "Jack: But I love Carly.",
        "Iris: My condolences.",
        "Jack: And I'll do whatever it takes to protect her.",
        "Iris: She's trouble. Always was, always will be.",
        "Jack: Iris, she was just a kid back then.",
        "Iris: She was a bad kid.",
        "Jack: I've been checking up. You've been here in Oakdale. In all these years, you left her alone, why?",
        "Iris: 'Cause I don't want to lay my eyes on her again.",
        "Jack: Great. That's exactly how I feel. Business as usual. We've got a good thing here, Iris. We have three kids.",
        "Iris: You know what I got to show for my life? A nasty cigarette habit and a fifth of gin on a good night. I'm just asking, if I play nice, what's it worth to you?",
        "Jack: You shaking me down?",
        "Iris: I'm not that stupid to shake down a cop. I'm just asking as a friend.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack. It's you. Jack, you found her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I guess I was hungrier than I thought.",
        "Celia: It's good you ate.",
        "Gwen: You don't have to clean up.",
        "Celia: No, I want to help.",
        "Gwen: Look, stop, okay?",
        "Celia: Gwen, I know it doesn't matter what I think, but what you did for the baby was really brave.",
        "Gwen: No, if I had been brave, I would've kept him. I guess I don't need this shirt anymore.",
        "Celia: I want you to keep it.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Celia: It was a gift. We're friends.",
        "Gwen: I've been a pretty rotten friend.",
        "Celia: No, you're not.",
        "Gwen: I haven't been straight with you.",
        "Celia: You don't have to tell me about your personal business. I understand.",
        "Gwen: What about your personal business? What about your boyfriend? I should have told you about Casey. You've got a right to know the kind of guy he really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'll catch up with you later, okay?",
        "Casey: No, now.",
        "Paul: Why don't you guys talk? I'll go check on Jen.",
        "Casey: Thanks, Paul.",
        "Paul: Don't call Mother. It's the last thing Jennifer needs right now.",
        "Will: I won't. All right, what do you want?",
        "Casey: Why did you say you were the father of Gwen's baby?",
        "Will: We can't all be virgins like you, Casey.",
        "Casey: You're not the father. I just saw Gwen. She told me the truth. I'm the father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh. They had a faster one, but I restrained myself.",
        "Rosanna: How long before he grows into this?",
        "Craig: High school state championships, he'll pitch a no-hitter.",
        "Rosanna: This is ridiculous, we can't keep all this stuff.",
        "Craig: Why not? We can devote the northwest wing to his hobbies.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: We don't even know he'll like baseball.",
        "Craig: Well, then we get him a hockey stick, or a lacrosse stick, or a high- jump pit. Whatever.",
        "Rosanna: Craig -- up till now, you've been very supportive of the adoption, but I know all you've really wanted was to raise your biological child.",
        "Craig: I'm won't deny that.",
        "Rosanna: So, I don't understand. What's changed?",
        "Craig: Nothing's changed. It doesn't mean I can't love this child. Rosanna, I can be a good father. And I've got five years to prove it. Which doesn't mean that this is a test drive for anything, this adoption. Okay? But one day, they are going to reverse that restraining order, and the three of us will be here, welcoming our new son. They'll be brothers, friends, running around here making so much noise, our ears will explode.",
        "Rosanna: That will be wonderful.",
        "Craig: Yeah. So let's get busy making it come true.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, I have to go to Detroit today. They're drafting the final papers for the adoption.",
        "Craig: Want me to come?",
        "Rosanna: No, I was kind of hoping that you would stay here just in case something comes up with the baby.",
        "Craig: All right. All right. You'll give the hourly reports?",
        "Rosanna: That'd be great. Craig, this is it. This is final. Are you sure about this adoption?",
        "Craig: I've never been more sure about anything in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to get back into bed, I want to see the baby.",
        "Mike: Dusty said Dr. Maddux is still with him, so just get some rest for a little while until we can go in there.",
        "Jennifer: Have you seen him?",
        "Mike: Not yet.",
        "Jennifer: What name did they put on the isolet?",
        "Mike: Kasnoff.",
        "Jennifer: And you're still okay with that? It's amazing, he's only a few hours old and I've already managed to mess up his life.",
        "Mike: No, no, come on, don't do this. Let's focus on the baby.",
        "Jennifer: This was supposed to be the happiest day of our life, Mike.",
        "Hal: Well, now you've done it. You've gone and made me a grandfather.",
        "Jennifer: Daddy.",
        "Hal: How you feeling?",
        "Jennifer: I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Hal: How's the baby?",
        "Jennifer: Fine, I guess. Dr. Maddux is still examining him.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm gonna go see how it's going.",
        "Hal: Hey, I'm not trying to chase you out.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, I want him to check on him. But come get me as soon as they'll let us in, right?",
        "Mike: I won't be long.",
        "Hal: Hey, Mike looks like he's holding up pretty well. Everything okay?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I think I'm just groggy from all the anesthesia.",
        "Hal: Well, then you just close your eyes. And you try and get some sleep, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Will you wake me up as soon as Mike gets back?",
        "Hal: That I will. You know, sometimes, when I'm all alone in that creaky, old house, I can swear I still hear your laugh coming from the den. That's when I miss my 8-year-old girl.",
        "Jennifer: She really misses you, too, Dad.",
        "Hal: Sleep tight, baby. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Excuse me, Miss --",
        "Nurse: Not now.",
        "Dusty: They don't tell you anything.",
        "Mike: Maybe they'll let me in.",
        "Dusty: No, they won't I tried. How's Jen?",
        "Mike: Tired. I'm running out of things to say to her. I've gotta come up with something. Doctor, how's the Kasnoff baby?",
        "Dusty: Is he stable?",
        "Dr. Maddux: Are you Mr. Kasnoff?",
        "Mike: No, I am.",
        "Dr. Maddux: I'm very sorry, Mr. Kasnoff, but I wasn't able to revive the baby.",
        "Mike: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Maddux: His lungs weren't fully developed. There's a drug that's used to stimulate growth. We administered it as soon as the baby was brought in, but to minimal effect. And in this case, there were just too many other complications.",
        "Mike: So try another drug. Do an operation.",
        "Dusty: Mike, the baby didn't make it. He didn't make it.",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Dr. Maddux: I'm very sorry for your loss. Would you like me to speak to Mrs. Kasnoff?",
        "Mike: No, I'll do it.",
        "Dr. Maddux: Please don't hesitate to have the nurse page me if you or your wife have any questions. My condolences.",
        "Dusty: I thought I got him to the hospital in time.",
        "Mike: I mean, a lot of babies come early. I don't understand.",
        "Dusty: I should've called an ambulance, I guess.",
        "Mike: It's not your fault.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: We need to tell Jennifer.",
        "Mike: I can't do it, Dusty. I cannot walk back in there and break her heart all over again.",

        "Carly: There was a little boy. And I knew him. Who was he? What happened to him?",
        "Jennifer: I can take the truth, okay? Is it Mike? Did he leave? Is that what you're so afraid to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You want me to go in there with you?",
        "Mike: No. No, I've gotta do it alone.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'll get the doctor. I'm sure Jennifer's gonna have questions.",
        "Mike: Thanks.",
        "Paul: Hi. What's going on in the nursery? Why is it all wraped up?",
        "Dusty: Mike's in there with Jen. He should be out in a sec.",

        "Hal: You okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've gotta take care of a few things.",
        "Hal: A few things. Hey, it never ends, Mike, not even when they're all grown up. Parenthood -- it's forever.",
        "Mike: You'll stay with her, right?",

        "Casey: It was one time.",
        "Will: That's all it takes, genius.",
        "Casey: I don't get it. Why did you run around telling everyone it was you?",
        "Will: Because she had nobody else.",
        "Casey: I would have been there.",
        "Will: Yeah, right, and skip out on your virginity pledge? Just go home, Casey.",
        "Casey: You know, why would you ruin your entire life for a girl like Gwen?",
        "Will: Don't put her down.",
        "Casey: You don't love her.",
