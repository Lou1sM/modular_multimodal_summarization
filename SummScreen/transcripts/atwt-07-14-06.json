        "Katie: Finally here. Home sweet home.",
        "Mike: Good, huh?",
        "Katie: Yes, compared to the honeymoon cruise from hell -- its paradise.",
        "Mike: Hey, I told you forget about that, okay? We're together. We're home.",
        "Katie: Someone's going to have to bolt the door, turn off the phone --",
        "Mike: Hey, hey, where you going -- where you going? Our honeymoon may have gone to the way side, but we are still newlyweds.",
        "Katie: Oh, you know, this is technically, the second time -- [Katie screams] You've carried me over the threshold.",
        "Mike: I might do this every day for the rest of our lives.",
        "Katie: I have a feeling we're not going to unpack. Or even go upstairs.",
        "Mike: You're right about that. I'm a show you what it feels like to be happily married.",
        "Katie: What was that?",
        "Mike: Simon Frasier, if you are in this house you're a dead man.",
        "Carly: Did you just say Simon? Frasier? Why would you think he'd be here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Well, it looks like my mom beat us here.",
        "Lia: I didn't know it was a race.",
        "Casey: You could have been ready when I picked you up.",
        "Lia: I wanted to look good for you.",
        "Casey: Lia, this isn't about looking good, it's a police investigation.",
        "Lia: Yeah I know. That fire last night. How scary was that?",
        "Casey: My mom wants to ask you a couple questions. How scary is that?",
        "Lia: You know, it was my sweater that got torched. The more I think about it -- I'm pretty sure I know who torched it.",
        "Casey: You're kidding. Who?",
        "Lia: Your ex-girlfriend, Maddie Coleman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Oh, hey Maddie, you dashed out before I had a chance to tell you what happened at Crash last night.",
        "Maddie: Oh, what? One of Casey's acts from Chicago brought down the house?",
        "Lisa: No, no, no, no. We had a fire.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Lisa: Yes. I'm not talking the burning of Atlanta, it was just a small trash fire. But nonetheless, people were really, really, spooked.",
        "Maddie: Is everyone okay?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, thank goodness for that -- they are. Well, we were just kind of concerned and the fire chief said he suspected arson. And now the police are there and they're kind of you know, scratching around, sniffing about.",
        "Maddie: So what are you doing here, now?",
        "Lisa: Well, 'cause the kitchen is closed at the club right now, because of the investigation. I have come by to get coffee for everyone. I just have to say the idea of a fire bug is just -- what did they have in for me?",
        "Maddie: Maybe it had nothing to do with you.",
        "Lisa: You don't have any idea who might have done this do you?",
        "Maddie: How could I? I wasn't even there.",
        "[Lisa laughs]",
        "[Jade is standing in the doorway and here's their conversation]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Good morning. I heard you walking around so much last night, I was going to come knock on your door, but I decided not to disturb you. Would you like some coffee?",
        "Dusty: Do me a favor?",
        "Barbara: Sure.",
        "Dusty: Look after Johnny. I've got to go out for awhile.",
        "Barbara: Sure. Dusty you're not going to Emily's hearing? I don't think that's a very good idea. Piling that much stress on top of all that grief --",
        "Dusty: I'm not going near that hearing.",
        "Barbara: I think that's a wise idea --",
        "Dusty: Will you watch my son?",
        "Barbara: Of course I will.",

        "Emily: It's fine.",
        "Susan: Emily, for what it's worth, you look wonderful in that outfit --",
        "Emily: Thank you. Really. I appreciate you bringing me my clothes. I spent the whole morning getting ready. Ready for what? I don't know.",
        "Susan: You have to stay positive. The judge can't ignore the fact that you put your unborn baby at risk to save Jennifer's little boy.",
        "Cass: I'm afraid one selfless act doesn't wipe the slate clean.",
        "Susan: Well, it has to count for something.",
        "Cass: Susan, your daughter kidnapped Dusty Donovan and threatened his life. Her whole future depends on the judge ruling whether or not she was sane at the time.",
        "Susan: Well let's just hope and pray the psychiatric evaluation helps us.",
        "Cass: Prayer is good. If we can get God on our side, along with a friendly witness --",
        "Emily: See, I thought -- I thought that would be Dusty. If Jennifer were still alive, I know she would have gotten him to testify on my behalf. Say a good word -- for me. Maybe there's still hope. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: I didn't expect to see you here, you know. After yesterday I --",
        "Meg: Yeah, well I figured that it wasn't our first fight and it's not going to be our last.",
        "Paul: I was a little worried. You didn't come home last night I started --",
        "Meg: Paul, we made a commitment. No matter how many fights or misunderstandings -- I'm yours. I'm always gonna be by your side, no matter how long it takes me to get there.",
        "Paul: You're amazing.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, that's what true, forever, love will do to a girl.",

        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Barbara: Where are you?",
        "Paul: At the courthouse -- Emily's hearing is about to start.",
        "Barbara: Yes, that's why I'm calling. Dusty won't be there. You know what that means.",
        "Paul: He won't be able to stand up for her.",
        "Barbara: So -- prison or padded cell. She'll be put away and you will get custody of the baby.",
        "Paul: All right. I'll let you know how it turns out. Dusty's a no show. We don't have to worry about him standing up for Emily.",
        "Meg: Well, it looks like you're going to get what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Well, darling gotta run. Margo's waiting for her caffeine fix.",
        "Maddie: Ok, well let me know, and good luck on finding whoever set that fire.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, sure. I'll keep you posted. Bye-bye, now",
        "Maddie: Thanks.",
        "Jade: What went down just now?",
        "Maddie: Apparently somebody set fire to Crash.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I know. I was there.",
        "Maddie: Well, then you must know more than I do because I wasn't.",
        "Jade: Yes, you were.",
        "Maddie: Look, I don't know if you saw someone who looked like me or what, but I --",
        "Jade: No, I saw you, Maddie Coleman, the original -- the one and only. So why'd you lie about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie would never do anything like that out there. It's not like her. You know what, do me a favor -- don't share this bent theory of yours with my mom.",
        "Margo: Hey, hi. Just who I'm looking for.",
        "Casey: Hey, how's it going in there?",
        "Margo: Uh, okay. Listen I have some questions about what happen here last night. Do either one of you have know how or why this fire got started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So as we left the island we waved goodbye to Simon for hopefully, the rest of our lives.",
        "Carly: I hate that he crashed your honeymoon like that. Well, now here I am doing the exact same thing! Really what I meant to do was just sneak in, and put the champagne on ice and sneak out -- you never would have seen me, so -- I'm gonna leave now.",
        "Katie: No, no, that was so sweet. Why the rush?",
        "Mike: Stay, have a glass.",
        "Katie: Yeah, tell us what we missed while we were gone.",
        "Carly: You know, I was sort of hoping that you'd have one perfect day before you heard about this.",
        "Katie: Why, what's going on?",
        "Carly: I hate that I have to tell you.",
        "Mike: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: She was fine. Everything was perfect, really -- and then Jennifer came down with pneumonia. And there was serious complications.",
        "Katie: Oh, Hun -- we should go to the hospital.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Katie, you're too late. She's gone.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: Oh my God. I don't believe it.",
        "Carly: No -- no one can. Everyone's devastated.",

        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: What are you doing here?",
        "Henry: Obviously, I'm here to help Emily.",
        "Susan: Help? How can you possibly --",
        "Henry: I can talk to the judge. I can tell him that you have changed. I can tell him that you took a momentary sabbatical from reality, and that everything is all better now.",
        "Susan: You are not getting anywhere near that judge. Emily's had enough of your help. You're the last person she needs to see in this courtroom today. Please.",
        "Henry: Do you want me to leave?",
        "Emily: Maybe it's best. I'm sorry. You've been such a good friend, I'm sorry.",
        "Susan: Say goodbye, Emily. The hearing's about to start.",
        "Emily: Henry -- Henry!",
        "Bailiff: All rise for the honorable Judge Marcus Carruthers.",
        "Judge: To be clear, the purpose of this hearing is to establish the defendant's mental capacity at the time the crime occurred and to decide if she's competent to enter a plea at this time. Mr. Hughes, Mr. Winthrop, I assume you both have copies of the psychiatric report?",
        "Cass: Yes, your honor.",
        "Tom: I do, your honor.",
        "Judge: Fine. Mr. Hughes, we'll begin with the state's argument.",
        "Tom: The facts in this case are in dispute. The defendant kidnapped Dusty Donovan, held him prisoner, threatened his life. The question is, was she sane? Did she know that she was doing wrong when she committed these heinous acts? Well, the prosecution believes that she was fully aware, we intend to move forward this case and prosecute her according to law.",

        "[Dusty enters the house where Emily held Dusty prisoner]",
        "[Dusty remembering]",
        "Emily: Now shut up!",
        "Dusty: She deserves what she gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Your honor, several court-appointed psychiatrists interviewed the defendant for hours. It's noted that she feels remorse for what she did. Regret -- after the fact, regret does not cancel out reality. She knew what she was doing. She knew it was wrong, and she came up with an excuse about being jilted at the altar which brought on some kind of psychotic break? Imagine living in a world where someone suffers a rejection and turns criminal. I mean, a broken heart, a wounded ego -- are these excuses to terrorize and intimidate. They are the definition of insanity. It does not mitigate her criminal behavior.",
        "Judge: Mr. Winthrop, you've had a chance to review the same evaluation?",
        "Cass: Oh, I have, your honor.",
        "Judge: You care to comment?",
        "Cass: I've read better fortune cookies.",

        "Carly: She was buried yesterday.",
        "Katie: No. Jen and Dusty -- they were just finally getting a break.",
        "Carly: They were married in her hospital room.",
        "Mike: Jennifer, I've never -- I don't know what to say. What's going to happen to the baby?",
        "Katie: Excuse me.",
        "Carly: I think that I should probably go now.",
        "Mike: No, actually will you stick around a little longer? There's something I've got to do, and I don't want to leave Katie alone.",
        "Carly: Okay. Is there something that I should tell her so she doesn't worry about you?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah. Just tell her I love her.",
        "Katie: Where's Mike?",
        "Carly: He said that he had to go and do something. And he told me to tell you that he loves you.",

        "Lia: All right, here's what i know. I left my sweater on the chair to go dance with Casey. He's a really great dancer.",
        "Margo: I'll write that down.",
        "Lia: I left my brand new sweater on the thing and the next thing I know it's in the trashcan on fire.",
        "Margo: Okay, so any idea who started the fire?",
        "Casey: Don't look at me. I was cranking out tunes all night.",
        "Margo: All right.",
        "Lia: Yeah, and then he was dancing with me. We were together like the whole night.",
        "Lisa: Here we are, here we are. Reinforcements --",
        "Margo: Thank God, just in time. Come on, I'll get you up to speed.",
        "Lisa: Okay, bye.",
        "Margo: Casey, don't go anywhere. I'm not done with you.",
        "Casey: Okay. Thanks for not saying anything.",
        "Lia: Yeah, well I did it for you.",
        "Casey: Whatever. I appreciate it.",
        "Lia: Look, I get you wanting to protect Maddie, since you went out.",
        "Casey: It's more than that --",
        "Lia: But you're lucky you stopped seeing her. I mean, the girl's a major head case. I'm talking major issues.",
        "Casey: Hey Mom, is there any reason we can't open the club tonight?",
        "Margo: I don't see why not. There's no more evidence we can put together here, unless, of course, you remember anything?",
        "Casey: Lia, why don't you go inside and pick out the songs on the playlist you like.",
        "Lia: Absolutely. Bye.",
        "Margo: What's going on?",
        "Casey: I need to talk to you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, shoot.",
        "Casey: Not as a cop. As my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Okay, yeah, I was at Crash. But, I left before Casey's set finished, and that was before the fire.",
        "Jade: Then why did you lie?",
        "Maddie: Why get involved with the police for no reason?",
        "Jade: You're not as smart as you look, because lying to the police is a sure way to get involved. If they question me, who was there, and who I saw, I'm not lying.",
        "Maddie: Oh, right, I forgot you are all about the truth, right, Jade? Please, you rode into town on a lie, and you've been lying ever since. Maybe I should tell the police to crank up the polygraph machine, because for all anyone knows, you set the fire.",
        "Jade: Don't even. Look, I don't know what you did or why you did it, but don't try to hang it on me? Uh-uh. That is so not going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: Your honor, this report contains no surprises. The Emily Stewart seated here today is as sane as you or I. What this document fails to do, is give us any insight into her mental state at a very difficult time in her life. So, we're left to ask our own questions, and draw our own conclusions. What kind of woman kidnaps a man and holds him prisoner, and then risks, not only her own life, but that of her unborn child to save that man's baby? The first is an act of a desperately troubled woman. The second, a selfless act of mercy. Cynics may claim that Emily did this to save herself, but I'm here to tell you, my client's sole motivation was to save a child's life and at no time did she ask for or expect any mercy in return.",

        "Dusty: What am I doing here? I'm remembering all that time I was here without you. We were robbed.",
        "Jennifer: But don't you think it's a waste to remember the times that we weren't together, when you could remember all the times we shared instead?",
        "Dusty: You, me and Johnny. You're in my head all the time. Like a movie. And it ends way too soon.",
        "Jennifer: No. It's not over. It's not. You have Johnny. Who's alive because of Emily. And he needs you. He's the future, Honey. This place is the past. You have to let it go.",
        "Dusty: I'm not sure I can.",
        "Jennifer: There's nothing for you here. It's all out there. You and our son. Life just waiting to happen. Millions of home movies waiting to be made.",

        "Emily: The insanity began when my fianc\u00e9 broke things off moments before we were supposed to be married. Look, it's not an excuse. I -- I'm just telling you that's, that's when I just -- I snapped.",
        "Judge: And your present state of mind?",
        "Emily: Well, I've been working with a therapist for several weeks now. When I look back to what I did, it's like looking at another person. I mean, I don't know who that person was. It's certainly someone I didn't want to be. And when the chance arose to donate my unborn child's stem cells to save another child's life, I swear to you, it wasn't about chalking up points to save myself. It was a chance to finally do the right thing.",

        "Paul: Paul Ryan. I'm the baby's father. And I'm completely committed to getting full custody of this child and raising it in a loving and stable home.",
        "Emily: Your honor -- your honor whatever you decide, I know I have to live with. All I know is that, giving up this child -- knowing that the first time I hold him or her may be the last -- I swear to you, it's the worst punishment I can imagine.",

        "Henry: I tell ya, usually when people are mean to me I head straight for the martini shaker, but in this case, sweetie, I think I need a shoulder with a two-gallon tear capacity. I tell you Emily's been putting me through this stuff --",

        "Casey: No, no, no. It's Maddie. She's really freaking me out.",
        "Margo: Well, she's freaking you out, how?",

        "Casey: Well, Lia thinks that Maddie got jealous when she saw us in the club together, and burned her sweater.",
        "Margo: Why didn't Lia tell me this?",
        "Casey: Because I asked her not to. 'Cause I don't want Maddie to get in trouble. I mean, even though I'm really bummed she broke up with me for reasons that make zero sense, I didn't want to see my mom dragging her off to jail.",
        "Margo: You have my word that I will not clamp Maddie into irons and drag her down to the station. Thank you for talking to me. You're learning.",
        "Casey: I'm working on it, mom, but this whole thing with Maddie feels really bad.",
        "Margo: I know. And it feels worse that you can't help.",

        "Maddie: Henry, please. Don't make this into a big drama. I am fine. Nothing is wrong.",

        "Maddie: Well, if it's two for the road, then I'm there. But I don't even need to get out of town anymore. Everything is cool.",
        "Henry: Everything is not cool, Maddie. I need you to be straight with me and lay it on the line. Tell me what is going on! I'm tired of this! What's wrong with you?",

        "Judge: Ms. Stewart, would you please stand? It is to your credit that you have expressed sincere remorse for your wrongdoing. And you saved the life of a child. That in itself is no small thing. But as the district attorney pointed out, good deeds and regrets do not mitigate charges of kidnapping and attempted murder. It's therefore my ruling that you enter a plea on these charges and be remanded back into police custody until such time as a court date can be set.",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Cass: Your honor, I need a moment to confer with my client before we enter a plea.",
        "Judge: All right, Mr. Winthrop, but be brief.",
        "Cass: Thank you.",
        "Meg: You won.",
        "Paul: We did.",
        "Meg: We won. Let's go.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Cass: This was not unexpected. Getting the judge to buy that you were insane was a long shot at best and didn't pay off. But, it was only out first roll of the dice.",
        "Emily: Okay, what are you saying? That I have other options?",
        "Cass: Limited, but yeah. I had breakfast with tom this morning. And the D.A.'s office is willing to cut a deal if you plead guilty.",
        "Emily: What kind of deal? A suspended sentence?",
        "Cass: You'll have to do time. At least ten years. But with good behavior --",
        "Susan: Ten years!",
        "Emily: Ten years.",
        "Cass: It could be a lot worse. If you nix the deal and go to trial, a jury might be a lot less sympathetic.",
        "Emily: Ten years?",

        "Katie: That's a good idea. Only one problem. We don't have any food in the fridge since we were gone.",
        "Carly: Well, that's not a big problem. So we'll go shopping. That'll eat up some time.",
        "Katie: You're really sweet. I just don't want to leave. I just want to be here when Mike gets home, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay. Just don't make yourself crazy. He said he'd be right back.",
        "Katie: I know. It's just until he's in front of my face, safe. I just -- he didn't say where he was going? I'm sorry I'm acting like such a baby. It's just that so much has gone wrong. Starting with Nick.",
        "Carly: And then your ex shows up on your honeymoon.",
        "Katie: And then Mike almost loses me. He just lost his cousin and he was terrified he was going to lose me. And then we come home and find out that Jennifer's gone -- I mean, how much does one person have to take? I should go find him.",
        "Carly: No, you know what? I don't think that's such a good idea. Okay?",
        "Katie: Could you call Jack? Maybe just have him keep an eye out for him, nothing official.",
        "Carly: No, no. If you want a favor from Jack, you're going to have to call him yourself. As not together as we were when you left, we're even more not together now.",
        "Katie: Oh, Carly, I'm sorry. I know that's not what you wanted.",
        "Carly: No. Nope, but it's what I got. And it's my fault I made such a mess of things. But I'm going to start over. I'm gonna get a loan. I'm gonna start my own business.",

        "Nancy: Or a man in love. Same difference.",
        "Mike: This just felt like an emergency. After the disastrous honeymoon and nearly losing Katie, it's not just going through the motions. They mean something.",

        "Katie: It's okay. It doesn't matter. You're my husband, I'm your wife, we have each other.",
        "Mike: You know, it was bad enough when I thought I lost you. I mean, I can't even go there. But after hearing about Jennifer, it just drove it home, how precious every moment is. And why this can't wait.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: I called Nancy from the islands because I needed some help with something -- something that, you know, I figured I'd get around to sooner or later when we got back. But, you know, that's when it hit me. Mowing the lawn is something you get around to, or washing the car. This is not something you put on or off your to-do list. It's way too important.",
