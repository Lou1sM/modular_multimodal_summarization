        "Dusty takes Janet to Metro. They laugh about her eating for two and both admit they have missed each other. Jack and Carly come in; what a coincidence .they are all having dinner. Dusty invites them to sit with him and Janet even though it's a bit awkward with small talk. Janet feels that Carly is upset at Janet's new living arrangements when she hears that Gabriel is fixing up a place on the Snyder farm. They begin to squabble and Carly walks out so they can just talk about her behind her back. Of course Jack follows. At the door she tells him that she is tired and they should call it a night. He confesses that he wanted to tell her about the cabin, but it was never the right moment. He was feeling closer to her and didn't want to lose that. He won't be spending any nights under the same roof with Janet. She is having his baby but that is all. She says if they are going to be a couple again, then he has to let go of Janet. He tells her one more time that he does not want to get back together with Janet; he wants to be with Carly. He kisses her and wants to do more, but Carly puts the brakes on and says they can not do this. He wants to know what they have to do to get back together. She says they both have a lot to think about. Oliver and Luke play chess. Luke picks up on the word when Oliver lets slip that they are in a relationship he doesn't do relationships. Oliver says he needs to go talk to Bob and yes he is capable of doing this by himself having an adult conversation with another adult. Kim tells Bob that they haven't even sold to Invicta yet but Mona Cross is running around acting like she owns the place. Oliver interrupts and tells Bob that he will be making a big mistake by hiring the candidate they are discussing. Luke rushes up and apologizes, but says what Oliver is trying to say is that he wants his job back. Bob tells Luke that it is not appropriate for him to be here discussing this. He tells Mona that this has never set well with him and she is prejudiced just because Luke and Oliver are gay. Memorial is not for sale to Invicta. Luke and Oliver are happy to hear the news and plan to celebrate now that Oliver has his job back. Luke teases that he can thank him any time he wants to. Oliver says he could have handled this all by himself. He invites Luke out on a real date to a movie.....or they can skip the movie and just go back to his place. Bob tells Oliver that he wants to recommend him as his replacement as COS. He can work on his people skills and do just fine. Kim tells Bob that he has lost his mind.",
        "Craig tells Lily that it looks like according to the flip that he wins. He will give her the choice of pillows. He lies on the bed and she takes the chair and declares that it will be a long night. He's the gentleman and changes with her. First boo boo, the lights go out. Craig is not afraid of that and tries to make the most of it, but when Lily discovers a mouse, well then he hides behind her. With a broom, he chases it under the bed. Lily mentions Holden marrying Holden and hopes this perfume venture works as she can not accept another failure. He guarantees her that Carlisle will not lose. She shouldn't listen to Lucinda, just follow her gut and trust her own decisions. He breaks into the vending machine so they can have a few snacks to eat. She allows him to rub some ice on her back rather than get into that bathtub. He tells her that she has a beautiful back. She says he is barking up the wrong tree. They're known each other for years and she is not sure why they never got together, but she's finding him nice. She does remind him the reason they never got together was because he scarred her sister for life and slept with her mother. Ouch, he doesn't want to hear anymore. He tells her those days of playing games are over and he just wants to help Lily now. Someone Janet used to know walks into Metro and she greets Tony .it was Tony Nero, now Blackthorn. He graduated from shoplifting to legitimate commodities and he's in town doing business with Lucinda Walsh. They both compliment each other on how fine they look now. Dusty tells Janet that he better go run a check on him as he might be hustling Lucinda. His gut is telling him something. She was wrong about Ralph and he guarantees her that she is also wrong about Blackie, the back-home punk."

        "Dusty: You sure you don't mind having dinner in a place you used to work?",
        "Janet: Oh, just as long as my boss doesn't find out. He was very mean to me.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I'm sure he wasn't that bad. [Laughs]",
        "Janet: Okay. So, if this is your thank you to me dinner for setting up that lunch with Johnny, does that mean that I get to have whatever I want?",
        "Dusty: Anything and everything, my sweet.",
        "Janet: Really? You're gonna regret that, 'cause I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm eating for two.",
        "Dusty: I miss being with you.",
        "Janet: I miss you, too.",
        "Jack: Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Uh, hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Janet: We're having dinner.",
        "Carly: Well, that's a coincidence. So are we.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: What are you waiting for?",
        "Luke: What are you waiting for?",
        "Reid: You. It's your turn.",
        "Luke: You know what I'm talking about. When are you gonna call Bob Hughes and ask for your job back?",
        "Reid: That's gonna put your knight in jeopardy.",
        "Luke: Every day you wait is a day that he could give the job to somebody else.",
        "Reid: Well, that's what he should do. Will you move already?",
        "Luke: You don't mean that.",
        "Reid: Bob's not gonna give me my job back. Checkmate. I can't believe I'm in a relationship with somebody so cloyingly naive, not to mention lousy at chess.",
        "Luke: So, this is a relationship, is it?",
        "Reid: You're right. What was I thinking? I -- I don't do relationships.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So, you do realize why Mona Cross wants to meet you over drinks, I assume. The woman has a crush on you, Darling.",
        "Bob: Oh, really?",
        "Kim: Yes.",
        "Bob: Oh, I thought she wanted to discuss candidates for the new neuro-wing.",
        "Kim: Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Laughs]",
        "Bob: She really rubs you the wrong way, doesn't she?",
        "Kim: Oh, you bet she does. I mean, Invicta hasn't even purchased the hospital yet. She runs around acting like she owns the place. I certainly hope her candidates are smart enough to find their way out of a paper bag.",
        "Bob: Well, to be honest with you, so far, I'm not impressed.",
        "Kim: Really? I'm surprised. No one rises to the level of the great Dr. Reid Oliver. Imagine that. Now, my darling, on that note, I am going to leave you. Try not to miss me too much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Guys, would you like to have dinner together?",
        "Janet: Uh, unless you'd rather go someplace else.",
        "Carly: No, that -- that sounds nice. Sure. Well, thank you.",
        "Jack: You're welcome.",
        "Carly: You know, I wasn't even supposed to be in town for dinner. I was supposed to be in New York closing a business deal with Lily, but you're not gonna believe this. Parker got a job on a television commercial.",
        "Janet: Good for Parker!",
        "Dusty: That's great.",
        "Janet: What's the commercial?",
        "Carly: It's a line of young men's sportswear.",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "Janet: Great! Good!",
        "Carly: Well, this is nice.",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, looks like I win. Shall we? Okay. It's your loss, but I'll tell you what -- I'll give you your choice of pillow. Which do you want, rock-hard or paper-thin?",
        "Lily: Such a sport. Toss me one. [Grunts] Why did those baggage handlers have to go on strike today? We'll get a flight out of here tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Out of some airport, come hell or high water.",
        "Lily: All I had to do was sign those contracts with Fran\u00e7oise. Why didn't I just have her fax them to me?",
        "Craig: How's that chair working for you?",
        "Lily: It's gonna be a long night.",
        "Craig: [Laughs]",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Craig: Oh, you are so gullible. Do you really think I'd let things go like this? Come on, get up. Get over there. Lie down.",
        "Lily: You think I'm gonna protest? I'm not.",
        "Craig: I know it.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] Much better.",
        "Craig: Good. Just watch out for the bed bugs, that's all.",
        "Lily: What bed bugs?",
        "Craig: You are way too easy.",
        "Lily: I guess we should at least be grateful we have a roof over our heads.",
        "Craig: Yeah, and 200 cable channels, a stunning view of the parking lot, and easy access to the sky king world-famous cocktail lounge. Could be worse.",
        "Lily: You and your big mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Cheers.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Oh, it's probably about Barbara Ryan. Yeah, I got to take this. Excuse me.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Janet: What's going on with Barbara Ryan?",
        "Carly: Oh, not much. I guess her family hasn't heard from her in a couple of days.",
        "Janet: Oh, I hope she's all right.",
        "Carly: I'm sure she is. And what about you? Are you having much morning sickness or swollen ankles?",
        "Janet: No. However, I do have to go to the restroom quite a bit. If you'll excuse me.",
        "Carly: So, are you and Janet back together?",
        "Dusty: Are you and Jack?",
        "Carly: I really admire the way you've hung in there with her, Dusty, considering how she jerks you around.",
        "Dusty: She doesn't jerk me around.",
        "Carly: So you say.",
        "Dusty: No, you know. You just got to learn to not push too hard. Good things come to those who wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: I can't just ask Bob to give me my job back.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Reid: Even if he did agree to give me my job back and he could convince Mona Cross to do the same, there's still the little matter of our non-relationship being against Invicta corporate policy.",
        "Luke: Well, I think Mona might give ground on that.",
        "Reid: Don't count on that.",
        "Luke: Well, if she doesn't, I'll quit the board.",
        "Reid: Like hell you will. And who are they to say who I can and can't relate to, and how could Bob have agreed with them, making me choose between my job and you? I've lost all respect for that man.",
        "Luke: No, you haven't.",
        "Reid: What was he thinking, selling to those robots, anyway? Memorial is a fine institution. They're gonna ruin it.",
        "Luke: Ah. So now your true feelings come out. Look, Reid, Memorial can't be ruined by Invicta, not when there's passionate, dedicated people like you on staff there.",
        "Reid: Practice your opening moves. I'll be back.",
        "Luke: Wait. You're gonna go speak with Bob? I'll come with you.",
        "Reid: I'm not a child. I'm perfectly capable of having a civil conversation with another human being.",
        "Luke: Since when?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mona: And Invicta's top pick, Dr. Richard Meredith. He wrote a groundbreaking paper on acoustic neuromas that was published last fall.",
        "Bob: Yeah, I know. I read it. It was really a summary of other researchers' findings.",
        "Mona: Well, he's lectured at Johns Hopkins.",
        "Bob: I know, but I keep hoping for a candidate who has more clinical experience, like Dr. Reid Oliver. To me, he's the kind of man that should be --",
        "Reid: Bob, can I have a minute alone now?",
        "Bob: Actually, we're in the middle of something. Call me later.",
        "Reid: Yeah, it'll just take a minute. Hey, who's this? Another unqualified candidate for my position? Richard Meredith. You cannot be serious.",
        "Mona: Dr. Meredith has an excellent reputation.",
        "Reid: Dr. Meredith is a self-aggrandizing, plagiarizing idiot.",
        "Bob: Reid",
        "Reid: You hire this guy, you might as well light a match to the neuro-wing right now.",
        "Luke: Excuse me. Hi, Ms. Cross.",
        "Reid: You followed me?",
        "Luke: What Dr. Oliver was trying to say is he would like his job back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Power's blacked out all over the city. Probably morning before it comes back on.",
        "Lily: Oh. My stomach's growling. We didn't eat. Why don't we go down to that famous lounge and have a bite?",
        "Craig: Because they just closed it.",
        "Lily: Oh, no.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lily: And I bet the vending machines won't work without electricity.",
        "Craig: It's all right. I liberated us some provisions from the bar. Candles and matches, a bottle of single malt.",
        "Lily: Craig!",
        "Craig: What, you prefer a blend? Got some olives and a flashlight. Janitor will never miss it.",
        "Lily: Could you find one of those little battery-powered fans?",
        "Craig: Yeah, it is awfully hot in here, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Yeah. It's just gonna get hotter now that we don't have the A.C., and the window will only open like 3 inches.",
        "Craig: Well, we do have ice for the scotch. Maybe if we get hammered enough, we won't notice the heat.",
        "Lily: [Laughs] I'll light. You pour. I just want to say that I really am grateful that you came here today. I don't know what I would have done here by myself.",
        "Craig: You would have stolen your own bottles of scotch.",
        "Lily: No, seriously. Cheers.",
        "Craig: Cheers. Mmm. [Laughs] Mm-hmm.",
        "Lily: Seriously, you really helped me with Fran\u00e7oise. Ah! Would you look at that? We have a mouse.",
        "Craig: Very funny. Nice try, though. A mouse?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: Is it big? Is it coming this way? [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Carly: Is everything okay?",
        "Jack: No. Everything is great.",
        "Carly: You look happy.",
        "Jack: I am. Happy to be with you.",
        "Dusty: So, Jack, how's work on that cabin going? Janet says it's looking great.",
        "Janet: Oh, Gabriel's doing a great job. You know, Jack, I'll have to admit, when you first pitched me the idea of moving into the cabin with Liberty and the baby, I was a little skeptical, but I think you were right. I think it'll be great. That way we'll be just close enough to you until the baby's born but still have our own space.",
        "Carly: Jack. What cabin are they talking about, and why does everyone seem to know about it but me?",
        "Jack: I hired Gabriel to fix up the cabin. You know, the one by the pump house.",
        "Carly: And Janet and Liberty and the baby are going to live there.",
        "Jack: I was gonna tell you about it, Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm sure it just slipped your mind.",
        "Janet: It's a -- it's a really good arrangement for everybody.",
        "Jack: Listen, Janet and Liberty, they'll be able to stay in a place of their own with no expenses.",
        "Janet: Well, I'm paying utilities.",
        "Jack: Yes. And Janet will have people close by once the baby's born to help.",
        "Carly: And how long do you plan to stay there, Janet?",
        "Jack: I'm sure, at some point, she's gonna want to move back into town, right?",
        "Carly: But for now she'll be in the bosom of your family, which is so reasonable and so practical.",
        "Janet: Carly, I can tell you're upset about this.",
        "Carly: I'm not upset! I'm simply surprised. This is the first that I'm -- that I'm hearing about this little arrangement.",
        "Janet: Listen, if you think about it, it's a very good solution, because I'm low on money, and --",
        "Carly: Well, I know that Dusty wanted to help you, but you wouldn't accept his help. You'll just accept Jack's help.",
        "Dusty: I respected the decision.",
        "Carly: Yes, of course you did, if you want to hold onto her.",
        "Janet: Listen. What goes on between Dusty and I is none of your business. Now, if you're threatened by me --",
        "Carly: Oh, wishful thinking.",
        "Janet: Wouldn't you rather have me living across the farm than under the same roof as Jack?",
        "Carly: What I want, apparently, doesn't matter at all in the situation.",
        "Jack: Oh, Carly.",
        "Carly: In fact, the only thing that is supposed to matter to anybody is the baby.",
        "Jack: You had to bring up the subject, didn't you? You just had to. You couldn't --",
        "Dusty: I didn't know you were keeping it from her.",
        "Jack: I'm not keeping a thing from her.",
        "Carly: You know what? If you guys want to talk about me like I'm not here, I'll help you out. This has been swell. Have a great meal.",
        "Jack: Carly, wait. I'm coming with you.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Please, stay. You can discuss colors for the nursery.",
        "Jack: Carly, please.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I got it, Jack.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: The next time I invite them to join us for dinner, shoot me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mona: Dr. Oliver chose to resign, Mr. Snyder. That ship has sailed.",
        "Luke: And do you share this vision?",
        "Bob: Luke, it's not appropriate for you",
        "Reid: You don't owe them an explanation, Luke.",
        "Luke: I just don't see where the ethical dilemma is here.",
        "Bob: I need a moment alone with Ms. Cross, please.",
        "Luke: All right. We'll wait in the lobby.",
        "Reid: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Luke: I am saving you from yourself.",
        "Bob: You know, Luke has a point.",
        "Mona: I don't think we ever were. Between you and me, I don't think this is the best test case to use.",
        "Bob: Why is that?",
        "Mona: Oh, it's just a hunch.",
        "Bob: Is it because Luke and Reid are gay?",
        "Mona: I didn't say that.",
        "Bob: You don't have to say it. Ms. Cross, I found it very interesting what Invicta's plans for Memorial are, but after careful consideration, we're declining your offer. Memorial is not for sale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No, no! Don't kill it!",
        "Craig: Well, what do you want me to do, escort it out of the room?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes! That's a good idea! Shh! Give me that! Now, listen. Be quiet.",
        "Craig: Well, that's not gonna work.",
        "Lily: Shh!",
        "Craig: Mice don't eat olives. You'd be better off with the scotch.",
        "Lily: Shh! Be quiet. Look. Look, he's gonna go investigate the olive. See? Goodbye, mouse.",
        "Craig: Well, you know your rodents, Lady.",
        "Lily: I'm good at something.",
        "Craig: You're good at a lot of things.",
        "Lily: Name.",
        "Craig: Oh. Uh -- ow! Okay. You're a great mom.",
        "Lily: Tell that to Faith.",
        "Craig: Faith's a teenager. They hate their parents on principle.",
        "Lily: She doesn't hate Holden or Molly. Molly. I can't believe he's gonna marry her. Please let this company succeed. I can't face another failure.",
        "Craig: This company is going to make it.",
        "Lily: You hope so. You're the only one backing it.",
        "[Remembering]",
        "Blackthorn: I don't get your point, Mr. --",
        "Craig: Montgomery. Craig Montgomery. My point is, if you're going head-to-head with Lucinda Walsh, you need me.",
        "Blackthorn: Sounds like its mutual.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: If Carlisle fails, you'll lose a bundle.",
        "Craig: Carlisle is not gonna fail. We're gonna make out like bandits on this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why did I have to bring up the cabin?",
        "Janet: Well, I assumed that Jack had told her, too.",
        "Dusty: They were getting along so well. I hope this isn't another setback.",
        "Janet: Do you care?",
        "Dusty: Well, when they're happy, it seems to be easier for us.",
        "Janet: Okay. Let's not ever double date again.",
        "Dusty: Never. I'll be right back.",
        "Janet: Blackie? Is it really you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm tired. Let's just say good night.",
        "Jack: If we do that, we're cowards, and we'll never solve anything.",
        "Carly: Say what you have to say.",
        "Jack: We were so close to getting it back today, Carly.",
        "Carly: It?",
        "Jack: Us, the way we're good when we're good. Please don't dismiss that because I didn't tell you about the cabin.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Jack: I tried to tell you. Each time I was going to, then something else would happen where I felt that much closer to you.",
        "Carly: So you avoided it?",
        "Jack: No. I felt like we were making progress. I didn't want to lose momentum.",
        "Carly: You want me to be honest with you, Jack? It was really humiliating to sit there and hear it from Dusty with Janet there.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I am. But can you please try to forget how you heard about it and focus on what a great idea it is? Think about it. Janet living out in the cabin, I won't be under the same roof as her.",
        "Carly: I thought that Janet staying at the farm was gonna be a temporary situation.",
        "Jack: It is.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, then how long do you see her staying in the cabin, Jack? Six months? A year? Two years? What? How long?",
        "Jack: I can't say! How do we know where any of us are gonna be? I might move back in here with you and the kids, and Janet and Dusty, they might get back together, and she'll move in with him.",
        "Carly: And you'd be okay with that?",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because you seem to have this burning need to be a part of her life, Jack. You like her where you can keep an eye on her.",
        "Jack: Carly, please. Janet's having my baby.",
        "Carly: This is not about the baby. This is still about Brad, about the way he died, about the guilt you feel, and if we are gonna be a couple again, you have to put this connection you have with Janet someplace where it can't hurt us like this anymore.",
        "Jack: And that's what I'm trying to do with this cabin. Don't you see that? I'm trying to keep my obligation and, at the same time, put distance between the two of us. It's a tough situation. I'm doing the best I can here.",
        "Carly: I know that.",
        "Jack: Okay. Obviously, I haven't made it clear enough, so I'm gonna say it again, just so there's no doubt whatsoever. I don't want to get back together with Janet. I want to be with you. Carly, I only want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We just saw Mona leave.",
        "Reid: Yeah. She did not look happy.",
        "Bob: Well, she failed in her mission to buy Memorial hospital.",
