        "Carly: Look, Jack, normally I would sit back, and I would trust your instincts more than mine. But Iris is hiding something. I can feel it. She lied to us just now --",
        "Jack: How can you be so sure? We just met her, Carly.",
        "Carly: I know. I'm tied to her, somehow. I can't explain it, but its like -- it's all connected. Iris, and my father, and her son, and me. And that woman did not tell us the whole story!",
        "Jack: Carly, you are too close to this.",
        "Carly: I can't believe that you didn't notice it.",
        "Jack: Notice what?",
        "Carly: Her body language. The way she looked at me. She hates me.",
        "Jack: Well, of course she hates you, honey. Your father let her take the fall for his criminal activities. She probably hates me, too. So what? She's an angry woman who likes the bottle.",
        "Carly: You know something, don't you? What's going on here, Jack? Are you lying to me, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Celia, I'm glad you're here. Let's go grab some coffee. [Celia slaps Casey] What did I do?",
        "Celia: I thought I knew you! I thought you were a better person than that!",
        "Casey: I don't know what you're talking about. So if you're going to accuse me of something, just go ahead and do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yeah, neonatal. This is Craig Montgomery. Yeah, yeah, thank you, I know my wife spoke with you earlier. I just wanted to make sure that you are handling our adoption process with confidentiality. It's everyone's wish, particularly the birth mother's, that our identities be withheld. Oh, good, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. Now, how's he doing? Of course he is. He's a fighter, like his old man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Sorry about the baby? What are you talking about? What happened?",
        "Emily: I am so sorry. I -- I thought you knew.",
        "Barbara: Knew what? You know what, Emily? What are you even doing here? Aside from my very foolish son, no one in this family wants you around.",
        "Hal: Barbara, stop it. You need to listen to me. The baby didn't make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Is that everything?",
        "Nurse Bently: Yes, Mr. Kasnoff, thank you. Will you be taking care of the funeral arrangements privately?",
        "Paul: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Nurse Bently: Please contact me as soon as the arrangements have been made. I'm very sorry for your loss.",
        "Paul: I can take care of that, come on.",
        "Mike: No, no, no. I'll have to talk to Jen about it.",
        "Paul: Of course. You think she's awake?",
        "Mike: I hope not. How am I going tell her that her baby's dead?",
        "Katie: Mike?",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Paul: Excuse me.",
        "Katie: Something's happened. The baby?",
        "Mike: He didn't make it.",
        "Katie: What? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. How's Jennifer?",
        "Mike: She doesn't know. She's still sleeping.",
        "Katie: Oh, Mike \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Why -- why won't you tell me what's going on? I've been asking to see my son all day, and there's just excuses.",
        "Dusty: You gotta calm down. You're still weak, you don't wanna work yourself up like this.",
        "Jennifer: Something's wrong, isn't it? Oh, I have to see my baby.",
        "Dusty: Jen, wait! Jen --",
        "Jennifer: What happened to my baby? No -- oh, my God! Oh, God, no! No, no!",
        "Jennifer: No, tell me -- tell me it's not true. Tell me my baby's okay.",
        "Paul: We need to get you in a roller, all right? You need to lie down.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, my God! Oh God, my baby.",
        "[Jennifer sobbing]",
        "Barbara: Jen, honey.",
        "Mike: No, not now, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: For God's sake, I'm her mother!",
        "Dusty: Barbara. C'mon, let's take a walk.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no.",
        "Dusty: Don't make a scene. Listen to me, it's not about you, okay? Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Katie: Mike, is there anything I can do?",
        "Mike: No. No, not now. Thank you, though.",
        "Katie: Poor Jennifer. I can't imagine what she's going through right now, what she's feeling -- or you.",
        "Mike: I need to go be with her.",
        "Katie: Okay, I understand. But Mike? Craig needs to be told. He is the father. He has a right to know.",
        "Mike: A right to know? Craig has no rights!",
        "Katie: No, I know you're upset right now --",
        "Mike: I don't want you to tell him anything. I don't want him anywhere near this hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: Margo! What a pleasant surprise!",
        "Margo: Wow, you're in a good mood.",
        "Craig: Well, I have the world on remote here. Oh, feel free to applaud. [Margo claps] Thank you.",
        "Margo: Put this together all on your own, did ya, Craig?",
        "Craig: Why are you so shocked?",
        "Margo: Because I'm the woman who taught you to use the garage door opener -- and I'm sure that Phyllis still programs the VCR.",
        "Craig: Well, I have a new son to show the world to, and I'm not gonna mess it up. I'm working on a potential father of the year.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm so pleased. Is he doing well then?",
        "Craig: Yes, he is growing stronger every minute. He obviously has very good genes.",
        "Margo: Well, don't start pretending they're yours now.",
        "Craig: I'm going to love this boy as my son. All right, come here. Let me show you something. Come here. I'm going to make a movie of his life, from the minute we carry him through that door until the day that he pushes me out of the way and walks out of it on his own.",
        "Margo: You know what, Craig? It takes a lot more than videos and really cool toys to send a child on a journey like that.",
        "Craig: You're not going to give me an inch, are you?",
        "Margo: Oh, I've given you miles, Craig -- miles.",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah, I remember. But I'm going to surprise you this time, sister. Yes, I am.",
        "Margo: Speaking of surprises, how is Rosanna?",
        "Craig: Oh, she's elated. She's in Detroit right now with lawyers, finalizing the adoption papers. She's going to be so -- so thrilled with the progress of this baby. What?",
        "Margo: I'm just having a little problem believing that you're so easily at peace with this restraining order. No appeals, no threats? No going to the hospital and banging on Jennifer's door?",
        "Craig: Do you think it would do any good?",
        "Margo: Well, it's never stopped you before, Craig.",
        "Craig: I want this adoption to go through. And I owe it to Rosanna.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, you do.",
        "Craig: So if I show up at the hospital and make a fool of myself, how do you think the birth mother is going to react?",
        "Margo: Craig, that's thoughtful.",
        "Craig: So I'm restraining myself, for everyone's sake.",
        "Margo: Amen.",
        "Craig: This adoption is changing my life.",
        "Margo: Oh, Craig, that's an awful burden to put on a little boy.",
        "Craig: Well, fret not. This child will know no one else's burden. I'm gonna make sure of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: The last thing Jennifer needs right now is you bringing your brother here and him making a damn scene, which is exactly what will happen if you tell him.",
        "Katie: He is the father, though, Mike. He just lost his son.",
        "Mike: He has no rights. A judge already made that clear.",
        "Katie: How can you be so --?",
        "Mike: Heartless? That's your brother, not me. You know that better than anyone.",
        "Katie: But what if it was you, Mike? What if you had just lost a son?",
        "Mike: I have.",
        "Katie: I know. I know, I'm sorry. I know you're in pain right now. And this is impossible to understand. It's gonna take a lot of time to get through that pain to find closure, but don't you think Craig deserves that chance, too?",
        "Mike: Let it go. You are not going to change my mind in this. I gotta go be with Jennifer.",
        "Katie: You're blaming yourself, aren't you? Don't. This is not your fault.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, it most certainly is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why would you think I would lie to you?",
        "Carly: Because you're telling me that you buy that woman's story, and I don't believe you. You are more cautious then that, you're more suspicious than that. You don't take anything at face value, do you?",
        "Jack: Carly, listen to me. I'm on your side. No one wants this over more than I do. I found Iris, didn't I?",
        "Carly: Yeah --",
        "Jack: Yeah, and despite your gut feelings about it, she gave us a plausible explanation. Your father embezzled funds and left her holding the bag. Now just because that's not how you think it went down, that doesn't necessarily mean she's a liar.",
        "Carly: Hannah told me not to dig for the truth because I couldn't handle it. Does an embezzlement scandal sound like something that I can't handle? Come on, Jack.",
        "Jack: All right, okay. There are some loose ends, I'll give you that. And I will tie them up. I promise. But not today, honey. We are supposed to be planning our anniversary party. Tonight's supposed to be about having fun and celebrating everything good in our lives. Why can't we focus on that and put everything else aside?",
        "Carly: Do you think that I want to be this confused and --",
        "Jack: Obsessed?",
        "Carly: Determined. Well, I don't. I hate it. But I can't make it go away.",
        "Jack: Well, maybe I can. Here's a list of everything that needs to happen before the party tonight. You won't be able to think about anything else.",
        "Carly: That's a nice try.",
        "Jack: No, honey -- no list, no party. That's the reality.",
        "Carly: Fine.",
        "Jack: First thing, you gotta take this over to Artie at Yo's. He's gotta have it by 3:00.",
        "Carly: Oh! Ooh, that's cash.",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Carly: Are you sure you trust me with this?",
        "Jack: I ran out of checks. Listen, do you want this party? Just get that to where it needs to get, and by 3:00. I've gotta go pick up the cake. Butterscotch-mocha.",
        "Carly: Ah, my favorite.",
        "Jack: Of course. This party is gonna be awesome. And we're going to have a wonderful time, during and after. So wear something beautiful that I can peel off of you, with my teeth, very slowly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I don't know what you think I did, but I don't appreciate being slapped.",
        "Celia: You know exactly what I'm talking about -- you and Gwen.",
        "Casey: Me and Gwen?",
        "Celia: You slept with her. How could you lie to me like that?",
        "Casey: It was a long time ago. It was before you and I were even together.",
        "Celia: That makes it all right to lie to me about it, to pretend you were a virgin? You were going to take a commitment vow with me.",
        "Casey: You think I didn't want to tell you? I tried, like, 1,000 times. I just couldn't find the right way.",
        "Celia: So you lied, about something this big? How could you do that? How could you be with me, and make all those promises?",
        "Casey: I was scared. I didn't want to lose you.",
        "Celia: I want to hear it from you, now. Just say it. Tell me you're the father of Gwen's baby.",
        "Celia: Look me in the face and tell me the truth.",
        "Casey: Celia, I swear to you, this is the only lie I've ever told you. Gwen and I had sex, yeah. One time. Only one time. It was a messed up situation -- one that I wasn't too proud of. We were at a party, and we both got pretty wasted. And we even hated ourselves after for doing it. It was stupid. I just wanted to forget about it.",
        "Celia: Did Gwen just want to forget about it?",
        "Casey: We both felt pretty bad.",
        "Celia: So you what, lied? Oh, don't worry about dumb old Celia, she's too stupid ever to figure it out, right?",
        "Casey: It wasn't like that, all right? I didn't know the baby was mine until today.",
        "Celia: Do you expect me to believe that?",
        "Casey: Celia, it's the truth, I swear it. Gwen's the only girl I've ever had sex with. You gotta believe me. I did everything wrong, but I did it to hold onto you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You ran off to Chicago, you made Jennifer feel terrible for taking on Craig --",
        "Mike: I'm not gonna get into this with you, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you're gonna get into it with me. Do you know why? Because this is all your fault. Because of you, my grandchild is dead.",
        "Dusty: What does it take to calm you down?",
        "Barbara: You know what, you don't wanna take me on today. My little girl is in there, and she's lost her baby. She's devastated. And I'm all she has. Do you understand that? I am all she has.",
        "Katie: Don't let her get to you, Mike. This is not your fault.",
        "Mike: Yeah, it is. She's right. I never should've let Jen run off like that, knowing how upset she was.",
        "Katie: And what could you have done to stop her?",
        "Mike: I don't know. I can't even bring myself to go in and face her right now.",
        "Katie: I'm sure Jennifer doesn't blame you. And I'm sure what she really needs right now is just to be with you. She needs you. And you know what? You need her, too. This is a loss that you two have to share.",
        "Mike: Thank you. I'm sorry for blowing up at you earlier. I understand that you think Craig has a right to know, and if you want to tell him I can't stop you, but I don't want him here. If I see his face anywhere near Jennifer, I won't be held responsible.",
        "Dusty: The last thing Jennifer needs right now is you screaming at everybody.",
        "Barbara: I will stop screaming if you will just get out of my way and let me see my daughter. She needs me. I'm her mother. Please Dusty, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: This is a relatively small town. And you're bound to run into Jennifer and your biological son. And your adopted son and your biological son are going to be in play groups together, or school together, or little league team together.",
        "Craig: Great.",
        "Margo: But you can't approach him, you can't talk to him. That's going to hurt, Craig. It can't help but hurt. And at some point, your adoptive son is going to put two and two together and wonder what's going on.",
        "Craig: Well, what am I going to do, right? I have to make the best of it. We all do.",
        "Margo: Wow, that's downright fatalistic.",
        "Craig: No. No, it's realistic. But if you think that I am going to love my adopted son any less, or that he will ever feel anything like second best in this house, you are very, very wrong. Okay?",
        "Margo: It's just that kids are surprisingly sensitive. They sense things.",
        "Craig: Little Phillip will never sense anything but 110% love.",
        "Margo: Phillip? You're naming him Phillip?",
        "Craig: Well, I'm kicking it around.",
        "Margo: As in Prince Phillip?",
        "Craig: Little prince? Yeah.",
        "Margo: I want to believe that this is real. I do, I do, I do wanna believe. I do.",
        "Craig: We control our own destinies, Margo. And I'm in a happy place right now, okay?",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Craig: I'm in a good place, so be happy, not skeptical.",
        "Margo: All right, all right.",
        "Craig: All right?",
        "Phyllis: Your sister is here to see you, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: My sister's already here.",
        "Phyllis: I mean your other sister.",
        "Craig: Ah, Katie. We were just discussing names for my son.",
        "Katie: Oh, man, there is no easy way to say this.",
        "Margo: What? What happened?",
        "Katie: It's about your son.",
        "Craig: What about my son?",
        "Katie: He died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: How is she?",
        "Paul: I -- I can't get through to her, Mike. Maybe you'll have better luck.",
        "Mike: Don't count on it.",
        "Paul: I can't tell whether she's trying to deny the reality or if she's trying to search for a way to deal with the reality.",
        "Mike: Look, Paul, before the accident, Jen and I weren't in a very good place. I don't know --",
        "Paul: Mike, it doesn't matter what place you were in. Right now, she needs you more than she needs any of us.",
        "Jennifer: Mike.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Jennifer: He didn't make it.",
        "Mike: I know.",
        "Jennifer: It was -- it was too soon. It just -- he wasn't strong enough.",
        "Mike: There was nothing anybody could have done.",
        "Jennifer: He just -- he just couldn't hold on, I guess. I didn't give him enough strength to hold on.",
        "Mike: Hey, it is not your fault.",
        "Jennifer: I'm so tired. I'm just tired.",
        "Mike: Rest. Get some sleep, okay?",
        "Jennifer: No, I can't. I can't close my eyes. 'Cause he's gone. He didn't even have a chance.",
        "Mike: I wish there was something I could do. Something I could -- something I could say.",
        "Jennifer: Like what?",
        "Mike: We all love you very much. Okay, Jen? You are not alone. We're here for you. I'm here for you.",

        "Henry: Lady, you just hired yourself a shamus.",
        "Carly: Is that -- is that what I need?",
        "Henry: Now give me the skinny.",
        "Craig: I should go to the hospital.",

        "Jennifer: God should've punished me, not my little baby. I'm the one who lied to you. I'm the one who tricked Craig. He should've punished me.",
        "Mike: Hey, don't say that. That -- this is not your fault.",
        "Jennifer: No, it is my fault! I killed my baby.",
        "Mike: Jen, Jen, that's not true. Please, don't ever think that.",
        "Jennifer: No, don't. I don't deserve to be comforted. I don't deserve to feel safe. I've made a mess of everything, and now my baby is dead.",

        "Craig: What do you mean, my son has died?",
        "Katie: He was just born too soon. His -- his little lungs hadn't developed, and he went into respiratory failure. They couldn't save him. Craig, I'm so sorry.",
        "Margo: Oh, Craig.",
        "Craig: How's the mother?",
        "Katie: Jennifer seems okay. I mean, physically, yeah, she's -- but emotionally, I'm sure she's a wreck.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm so sorry. This has gotta be devastating for you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Are you sure it was my son? I mean, hospitals make mistakes all the time.",

        "Margo: You can't get within 50 feet of Jennifer.",
        "Craig: Under these circumstances, I think the order can be lifted.",
        "Margo: Well, the law is not gonna see it that way. I'm sorry, Craig.",
        "Katie: Margo's right. The worst thing you could possibly do right now is to show up at the hospital. And I know it seems unfair at this point, but you just can't.",
        "Craig: My son is dead.",
        "Margo: Yes, but you have another son that was just born, Craig. And he's counting on you and Rosanna. If you violate the restraining order, you could be arrested. You could lose your right to adopt him.",
        "Craig: I believe a man has a right to pay respects to his child. And I don't think there's a judge in the state who wouldn't agree with that.",
        "Katie: But you're gonna have to get past Mike, and there's no way he's gonna let you anywhere near Jen or the baby.",

        "Paul: No, you're not.",

        "Emily: I want to be here for you. I really do. I just don't want to add insult to injury. Your family's got enough to deal with. I mean, even Barbara -- I hate that woman, and this has gotta be killing her. I'm sorry, I think I should go. I really need to go.",

        "Carly: Hey, Kim, it's Carly. You're not gonna believe this, but I found her -- the woman in the picture with my father. I found her. Her name is Iris Dumbrowski. And she gave me the runaround. She's lying to me. So if you can find out anything about her, Iris Dumbrowski, I'd really appreciate it. Something big is going on. Thanks, Kim. Business must be slow.",
        "Henry: Yep, it's as slow as the I-75 at 4:00 in the afternoon. What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Looking for Artie.",
        "Henry: That's funny, so am I.",
        "Carly: Well, if life is so boring and business is so slow, then why don't you take that private eye job I offered you?",
        "Henry: Because, first of all, I'm retired. And second of all, finding a woman without a name is as easy as finding a martini olive in a pile of marbles.",
        "Carly: Oh, I've got her name. I even found the woman.",
        "Henry: You did? Wow. So, I guess you don't need my help after all.",

        "Celia: But it's not just you and me, Casey. You have a baby now with another girl. That's always going to be there. How can I ever trust you again?",
        "Casey: Come on, Celia. Don't say that. I made a mistake. I'll do anything to fix it.",
        "Celia: No, you've got bigger things to worry about right now. You have a baby, Casey, with another girl. And it's not right for will to take on the responsibility that belongs to you. So what are you going to do about that? What are you going to do about Gwen and your baby?",

        "Casey: Not maybe, definitely.",
        "Celia: But there's no way I could forgive you for the way you treated Gwen. You used her. You threw her away. There's no way I'll ever believe that you didn't know, deep down, that that baby was yours, right from the beginning.",
        "Casey: Celia, I swear --",
        "Celia: Stop it. You did know, but you chose to ignore it. And that's unforgivable.",

        "Barbara: No. Honey, you didn't. He was just too little to survive.",

I know Johnny is with me every single day. I feel him. I know he's here. But the one thing that haunts me Jen, the one thing I will regret my whole life, is that I never got a chance to hold him, to kiss his little forehead. I let him go. You have that chance. Don't let that slip away.",
