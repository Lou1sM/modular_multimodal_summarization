Tom says no because Emily is dangerous and he must do anything possible to keep her away from his children. Barbara hires a lawyer who tells her the only hope to make Paul a free man is to hire Rick Decker to help determine who killed Sofie . Barbara makes a deal with the devil despite her better judgment. Rick tells Barbara he has found a higher power in prison and the only thing he wants to do is help people.

Chris promises Allison that he will keep an eye on Rick and he won't let him hurt her.

        "Emily: Casey! Where have you been?! I've been looking everywhere for you! Why aren't you answering your phone?!",
        "Casey: Uh, no juice. I left the charger at my parents'. Like, does -- does this mean you want to see me again?",
        "Emily: I can't, Casey. Especially not now.",
        "Casey: What is this?",
        "Emily: An order to appear in family court. Your father has already started the process to take away my parental rights.",
        "Casey: He can't do this. No, no. It's just a threat. That's all it is.",
        "Emily: You know your father like I do. He doesn't make empty threats.",
        "Casey: So, you're just gonna give up, let him take away your son?",
        "Emily: If he does that, Casey, it will kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daniel: Okay, Dad. Talk.",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Daniel: You said you'd tell me what was going on when we got home. So, we're home. Why'd you take me out of camp?",
        "Tom: I just wanted to talk to you about a few things. There's gonna be some changes in the way the family operates.",
        "Daniel: Are you and Margo splitting up?",
        "Tom: No, no. It's nothing like that. We're fine.",
        "Daniel: Then, what kind of changes, Dad? You're scaring me.",
        "Tom: Well, first off, you're, uh -- you're not gonna be going on vacation with your mom this year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Case, I need your help. You've got to make your father stop. You're the only one who can do this.",
        "Casey: Maybe before, but after you left the other night, I was so disgusted with how they treated you, I moved out.",
        "Emily: Where to?",
        "Casey: I've been playing it by ear. You know, crashing on people's couches. I didn't even say good-bye. You know, they're -- they're not gonna listen to anything I say now.",
        "Emily: Yes, they will. They will. There's one thing you can do that's guaranteed to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hi.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here? I thought you resigned.",
        "Chris: I just had some loose ends I needed to tie up.",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Chris: Uh, my dad told me you accepted his offer to be reinstated in the nursing program. I'm glad. I always thought you'd be a good nurse.",
        "Alison: You've got a funny way of showing it.",
        "Chris: Yeah. I guess I do. But, uh, I'm happy you're giving the program another try.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm not doing it to make you feel better. I'm doing it because I have something to prove to myself.",
        "Chris: You can do it, Ali. Once you figure out how to believe in yourself, nothing can stand in your way.",
        "Susan: Why are you still harassing my daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, I can't get a hot shower, but maybe, uh -- maybe I can get a foot rub?",
        "Margo: Not in the mood, Paul.",
        "Paul: I'm so surprised.",
        "Margo: You've got a visitor.",
        "Meg: Hey!",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: Oh --",
        "Paul: Sorry about the cuffs.",
        "Meg: Mm. Are the handcuffs really necessary?",
        "Margo: Yes, they are.",
        "Paul: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Margo: I know you're not. You two have two minutes.",
        "Meg: I've been trying to see you ever since they brought you in here. Have you gotten any sleep?",
        "Paul: No. My life is completely out of control. Never thought I'd be digging up a body.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. How did this happen? I thought Sofie would be out of our lives.",
        "Paul: Well, at least we've accomplished one thing. At least we've kept suspicion off of my mother.",
        "Meg: Well, you can stop worrying about that. Barbara didn't kill Sofie. Somebody else did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Detective Snyder caught your son moving Sofie Duran's body into the trunk of his car.",
        "Barbara: I know it looks bad.",
        "Lawyer: It looks bad?",
        "Barbara: He didn't kill that girl.",
        "Lawyer: All right. If you're right --",
        "Barbara: I'm positive.",
        "Lawyer: Good. That means that the perp is still out there, and he probably left some evidence behind. So our job is to find that evidence. Because all we have to do is to establish reasonable doubt in the mind of one member of that jury.",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. You're talking about this going to trial? It shouldn't get that far. My son is innocent. I don't want you getting him off on some kind of technicality. I want him free, with his reputation intact.",
        "Lawyer: All right. First things first, Barbara. You're paying me to make sure that Paul doesn't spend the rest of his life in prison. Now, this case against him is a circumstantial case. But as far as these things go, it's -- it's a very strong case.",
        "Barbara: Are you saying that you can't win?",
        "Lawyer: No. Not without help I can't. But I know a, uh -- a forensic specialist who I've worked with in cases like this -- cases that I thought were dead in the water. And if anybody can find evidence to clear Paul, this is the guy who can do it.",
        "Barbara: Great. Hire him. I don't care how much it costs. I just want my son's freedom.",
        "Lawyer: Well, I just -- I need to warn you, though. Um, he comes with a bit of baggage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: If my mother didn't kill Sofie --",
        "Meg: No. There is no \"If.\" You should have seen the look on her face when I told her the news. She was completely shocked.",
        "Paul: Okay, but if it wasn't her and it wasn't you and it wasn't me, then who killed Sofie?",
        "Meg: Well, the police will figure that out.",
        "Paul: They think they already have.",
        "Meg: That's because we made them think that. Look, we don't have to protect anyone anymore, so we don't have to lie anymore.",
        "Paul: Yes, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So your expert has baggage. What's his problem?",
        "Lawyer: Well, he's currently enjoying the hospitality of the Illinois Department of Corrections. But this is what makes him so good at what he does. He understands a criminal mind, because, um, well -- because, frankly, he has one.",
        "Barbara: That's not exactly a glowing recommendation. Isn't credibility an issue?",
        "Lawyer: Well, the prosecutors ask him this every time he gets on the stand, and his response is that he's got nothing left to lose. He has won 14 cases in a row. He's closed them all. Murders -- cases that the cops just throw up their hands. He's batting a thousand, and this is why the D.A.'s office allows him to go out and do this work in the field.",
        "Barbara: Great. I'm a little worried about the criminal mind, though. Isn't he dangerous?",
        "Lawyer: No, no, no, no. Not at all. He's got security with him at all times.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I see. So it's safe, so long as he's handled?",
        "Lawyer: Barbara, my investigator's the least of your problems, and I'm not gonna mince words with you, all right? The cops already have this case in the black, and they're not gonna work overtime to open it up again, just based on our say so. If Paul is innocent, then my expert is the man who can win his freedom. I guarantee it.",
        "Barbara: A guarantee -- that's something you hear very often from an attorney.",
        "Lawyer: Well, you can take this one to the bank, all right? My expert will make sure that Paul walks out of that courtroom a free man.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Does your expert have a name?",
        "Lawyer: Why don't I just go take you to meet him right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Full disclosure? We tell Margo everything?",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know we have to, Paul.",
        "Paul: Even the part where Sofie said that you killed her?",
        "Meg: Well, that's not proof of anything except that Sofie wanted me to suffer.",
        "Paul: It's called a dying declaration, Meg. People have been convicted for way less.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, the difference is that we're not guilty. Look, it's the only way. We have to tell the whole truth.",
        "Paul: Oh, right, 'cause that always works.",
        "Meg: I'm not afraid.",
        "Paul: Well, I am. I am afraid, Meg. I don't want to lose you.",
        "Meg: You won't. You have to trust me. I have nothing to hide.",
        "Margo: Okay, Guys. Time's up.",
        "Meg: It'll be okay.",
        "Paul: I'm ready to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hi. I'm Barbara Ryan. And you must be the forensics expert I've heard so much about.",
        "Rick: No. Actually, I am.",
        "Barbara: Rick Decker.",
        "Rick: Long time, no see, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: This man is a serial murderer. He tried to kill me and several of my close friends, and God knows how many other people as well.",
        "Rick: That was then.",
        "Barbara: Don't give me the \"I've changed\" speech. I know better than to trust any word that comes out of your mouth.",
        "Rick: I have changed, Barbara. Prison -- prison has had a positive effect on me.",
        "Barbara: Anything that keeps you far from decent society is positive.",
        "Rick: Define \"Decency.\"",
        "Barbara: Anything that's not you!",
        "Rick: I'm reformed. I -- I found a higher power while I was in jail. Now, it wasn't easy, but I have changed my life. I'm all about doing good for others now.",
        "Lawyer: Listen, you should hear him out, Barbara, because I really believe that he's Paul's best chance.",
        "Barbara: So, you're in law enforcement?",
        "Rick: I'm in the truth-seeking business. I care about justice, legality notwithstanding.",
        "Barbara: I can't do this.",
        "Rick: Barbara, I am a scientist. I have volumes of medical information stored away inside my head.",
        "Barbara: Don't forget, I know exactly what those volumes of information have been used for. You can't tell me that you're now doing them for the greater good.",
        "Rick: Look, I may have been a flawed human being, but I was a very effective doctor.",
        "Barbara: Dr. Kevorkian's evil twin.",
        "Rick: That's funny.",
        "Barbara: It would be if it wasn't true.",
        "Rick: Barbara, please, consider the situation. I take my -- I take my two areas of expertise, then I get inside of the head of others who think the way that I used to think.",
        "Barbara: Murderers.",
        "Rick: Maybe in -- in this small way, I -- I can redeem myself.",
        "Barbara: That would be between you and your higher power.",
        "Rick: I've done a lot of work on myself while I've been away. I've -- managed to let my anger go, Barbara. And I'd like you to be the first to know that I forgive you for betraying me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Just tell me about the last time you saw Sofie alive.",
        "Paul: I went to her room at the Lakeview, and I went to knock on the door, but it was open. So I went in, and I saw her lying unconscious on the floor, so I tried to wake her up.",
        "Margo: How?",
        "Paul: I shook her.",
        "Margo: Was she dead?",
        "Paul: Barely breathing. And then I saw the needle next to her, and I just figured that she'd O.D.'d.",
        "Margo: Sofie was an I.V. drug user?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I just saw a needle there, and I thought maybe she'd taken something.",
        "Margo: Okay. Then what?",
        "Paul: She sort of stopped breathing. And so I tried to call 911, and then she died. But I was trying to save her, Margo. I swear.",
        "Margo: Well, I don't get it, Paul. If you didn't kill Sofie, why did you try to hide the body?",
        "Paul: Because I knew how you guys think.",
        "Margo: Covering up the crime?",
        "Paul: I -- I don't know. What can I say? I -- I wasn't thinking clearly.",
        "Meg: He did it because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You're fired.",
        "Lawyer: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: I don't even want to be near this degenerate, let alone have him anywhere near my son's case! If you had done your research, you would realize that there is history here!",
        "Lawyer: I know all about your prior dealings with Dr. Decker.",
        "Barbara: Then what are we doing here?",
        "Lawyer: Because I owe my client the best possible defense. And in my opinion --",
        "Barbara: Your opinion no longer matters to me. So have your secretary bill me for the hour and a half that you worked for me.",
        "Rick: How badly do you want to see your son Paul free, hmm? Because I have seen the evidence, and I'm your best shot -- maybe your only shot.",
        "Barbara: Interesting choice of words.",
        "Rick: Think about it, Barbara. Don't let your pride be the death of your son. I've said my peace. It's in your hands now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mom, I appreciate you wanting to protect me, but I can handle it.",
        "Susan: I can't. You've suffered enough at the hands of --",
        "Alison: Mom, please.",
        "Chris: It's all right. She's right. Uh, I just want to tell Alison how happy I am she's back in the nursing program.",
        "Susan: Why? Do you think that lets you off the hook?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "Susan: Good answer, because no apology is ever gonna make up for how you manipulated my daughter or how you and your brother went after her in court. We should sue you for defamation of character!",
        "Alison: Mom, stop it! I'm not suing anyone! Just back off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daniel: We're going to the Grand Canyon. She even got us a permit to go camp down at the bottom. Do you know how hard those are to get? Do you know how many strings she had to pull?",
        "Tom: I'm sure she did.",
        "Daniel: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Tom: It means if you want to go to the Grand Canyon, Margo and I can take you.",
        "Daniel: Dad, why are you being such a lawyer?",
        "Tom: I'm sorry, Danny. We just have to make some changes. And, uh, what it basically means is you're not gonna be spending much -- much time with your mom anymore.",
        "Daniel: But I don't get to spend time with her as it is.",
        "Tom: I know. But this isn't a discussion. The decision's already been made.",
        "Daniel: So you're telling me to suck it up? You're saying I can't see my mom, and you expect me to accept that? Don't these decisions have to be passed through, like, a judge or something?",
        "Tom: Yeah, they do. That's why we have, uh, a court date to change the custody agreement.",
        "Daniel: Okay. Sure. So, what did Mom do this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Forget it, Emily. My parents aren't gonna listen to me, especially about you.",
        "Emily: They will if you tell them what they want to hear.",
        "Casey: I -- I don't understand.",
        "Emily: Just tell them that you will do what they want -- that you will never see me ever again.",
        "Casey: What?! No!",
        "Emily: Casey, just admit to them that our relationship was a big mistake and you're over it, and move back home.",
        "Casey: But that is a lie. And nothing we did was a mistake! And -- and I'm not over it.",
        "Emily: Casey, I am not asking. I am begging you. If you love me, please do what I need you to do.",
        "Casey: I do love you, and that's why I am not gonna say anything bad about you to my parents, or to anyone else.",
        "Emily: You are not hearing me. I can't go on if I lose my son.",
        "Casey: Of course you can go on. You love a good fight, and -- and you're not gonna let my dad get away with this, and you're not gonna let him treat you like dirt.",
        "Emily: You are only making things worse!",
        "Casey: How?",
        "Emily: The longer you stay away from home, the more your parents are gonna hate me. Will you just do it? Just say whatever you need to say. I'll know you won't really mean it.",
        "Casey: No, no, no! You can't ask me to do this.",
        "Emily: Yes, I can! I don't care if you tell your father I'm the biggest slut in the Midwest. You just do it. Just tell your father. Make him promise that in exchange for giving me up, I get to stay in my son's life.",
        "Casey: You really think this is gonna work?",
        "Emily: It has to work. It has to work. His son for my son.",
        "Casey: What about me? When did I get demoted from boyfriend to bargaining chip?",
        "Emily: Casey, listen to me. We're talking about my son -- my son! He's just a little boy, okay? Think about him. He needs me, and he -- I need him more than anything in the world, and I'm sorry it has to come down to this that I have to choose, but it's just the way it is.",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. I'll do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Look, I'm not about to go into all the specifics with you.",
        "Daniel: Dad, I have a right to know what's going on.",
        "Tom: I understand how you feel.",
        "Daniel: Then tell me. I can handle it.",
        "Tom: You're just gonna have to trust me and let me be the parent on this one.",
        "Daniel: So, you're saying, \"Shut up and go away\"?",
        "Tom: No, it's nothing like that. This is just a very -- special situation.",
        "Daniel: Then what is it, Dad? Why am I here? I mean, I have no say in what's going on! You could have at least left me at camp for a couple more weeks, have fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Before I crawl into bed with this devil, just tell me this is absolutely the only way.",
        "Lawyer: I wouldn't have called on Decker if I didn't think so. But his record does speak for itself.",
        "Rick: I can exonerate your son, Barbara. He can walk away from this free and clear or spend the rest of his life in prison. You hold the key.",
        "Barbara: All right. As my stomach turns. You're hired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul left something out of his story.",
        "Paul: Meg, please don't do this.",
        "Margo: You know, I'd really like to hear what your wife has to say. I mean, we can talk here, or I can take you to another interview room, make you more comfortable, Meg.",
        "Meg: It's okay. I have nothing to hide. Sofie was still conscious when Paul found her, but just for a minute.",
        "Margo: I see.",
        "Meg: She was conscious long enough to tell Paul that I had given her the drugs -- the overdose. And when Paul asked her who had done --",
        "Paul: No, hold on. All Sofie said was \"Meg.\" She didn't say, \"Meg killed me.\" She just said the word \"Meg.\"",
        "Margo: All right. Let me get this straight -- Sofie told you that someone had given her an injection, and she said that it was Meg.",
        "Meg: That's right. And that's why Paul had to cover it up. He thought that --",
        "Margo: I get the picture.",
        "Paul: But Meg didn't kill Sofie.",
        "Margo: But you didn't know that at the time, did you? Otherwise, you never would have disposed of the evidence. And you -- I hope you know that by telling me this, you implicate yourself.",
        "Meg: I didn't kill Sofie.",
        "Margo: Then why did she say that you did?",
        "Paul: Because Sofie was a jealous freak. I mean, a bogus rape charge -- doesn't that prove that.",
        "Meg: S -- she wanted to hurt Paul! And when that blew up in her face --",
        "Margo: All right! You know that I could arrest you right now.",
        "Paul: What for?!",
        "Margo: Well, for starters, obstruction of justice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I -- I didn't mean to cause trouble.",
        "Susan: Why are you still here?",
        "Chris: Yeah. I'm leaving right now.",
        "Alison: No, Chris, stay.",
        "Susan: Ali --",
        "Alison: Mom, I mean it. I can fight my own battles.",
        "Susan: But you're not.",
        "Alison: I also get to choose them, okay? And this one isn't worth it. And that's my right to decide, and that's what I'm gonna do. Chris admitted he was wrong, and that is enough for me.",
        "Susan: You sure about that?",
        "Alison: Yes. Now, all I want to do is finish filling out this paperwork and get on with my life. Will you please let me do that, the both of you?",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Susan: It's the E.R. I've got to go.",
        "Alison: Thank you, switchboard.",
        "Chris: She was ready to throw down with me.",
        "Alison: Don't antagonize my mother. I have no doubt that she could take you.",
        "Chris: Yeah, no question. And for the record, she's right. If you took me back to court, you'd probably win. We fought dirty. I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: No, you're not. You and Tom would do the same exact thing if you had your back against the wall.",
        "Chris: I'd like to think we wouldn't.",
        "Alison: Physician, no thyself.",
        "Chris: It's \"Heal thyself.\"",
        "Alison: Same thing. Anyway, the last thing I want is to go back to court and relive this thing all over again.",
        "Chris: What do you want, Ali?",
        "Alison: I want to be a nurse and to never see you again, as long as I live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg had nothing to do with this. She didn't even know Sofie was dead. She didn't know about any of this till it was all over.",
        "Margo: Here's the point -- after she found out, she didn't come to the police. Knowledge of a crime after the fact qualifies as obstruction.",
        "Meg: But there was no crime! Paul didn't do it!",
        "Paul: No. All I did was move a body. Charge me with whatever law that is that I'm breaking, and I'll confess to it. But, Margo, isn't it more important that we figure out who really did kill Sofie?",
        "Lawyer: Not another word, Paul.",
        "Margo: Who let you in here?",
        "Lawyer: The duty officer. I'm Mr. Ryan's attorney.",
        "Paul: I don't need a lawyer.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you do, Honey.",
        "Lawyer: Your mother's right. As you can see, Mr. Ryan's bail has been posted, so I'd like him released immediately, please.",
        "Margo: This isn't the end of this conversation.",
        "Lawyer: Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: The desk sergeant will get your personal belongings to you.",
        "Barbara: Let's get you two out of here. You've been through an ordeal tonight. You need some rest.",
        "Margo: Make sure that rest is here in Oakdale. No spontaneous honeymoons to, say, a country with no extradition treaty.",
        "Barbara: That's unbelievably insulting.",
        "Margo: Is it? I thought I was just being clear.",
        "Lawyer: I'd, uh -- I also brought a forensic specialist with me to assist in the case. He needs access to the autopsy report.",
        "Margo: All right. Great. I'll call the medical examiner. As soon as the report's done, he'll fax it over. What's this forensics guy's name?",
        "Lawyer: As a matter of fact, I think you know him.",
        "Margo: What is this maniac doing here?",
        "Rick: Nice to see you, Lieutenant. I'm here to lend, uh, a helping hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, Dad.",
        "Tom: Come by to pick up the rest of your things?",
        "Casey: Actually, no. I called the office, and they said you were home, so I -- what's going on? Why are you here in the middle of the day?",
        "Tom: I ran up to camp to pick up Daniel and bring him back.",
        "Casey: Already?",
        "Tom: Yeah. We just have a few things we need to talk about.",
        "Casey: Talk to the judge?",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Casey: I already heard about the court order. You don't waste any time, do you?",
        "Tom: Well, I'm not discussing this with you, Son. You made your decision.",
        "Casey: Dad, please, just listen, okay?",
        "Tom: And why should I?",
        "Casey: Because I think you and Mom are going to be happy with what I have to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You get the hell out of my station.",
        "Rick: I would love to, but I'm here on business.",
        "Margo: This is your investigator?",
        "Lawyer: That's right.",
        "Margo: What the hell were you thinking, hiring this lunatic?!",
        "Paul: That's a really good question. Mom, what's going on?",
        "Rick: She brought me here to help you. And I can assure you that as long as your check clears, I'm your loyal servant, Paul.",
        "Paul: What were you thinking?",
        "Barbara: I know it seems rather odd.",
        "Paul: It seems a little psychotic. He's a serial killer. What if he comes after you again, Mom?",
        "Barbara: I am willing to take that chance if it means saving your life.",
        "Rick: I can get you out of this, Paul. Now, regardless of what you may or may not think of me, I'm excellent at what I do.",
        "Paul: What you do is murder. What, this case involves syringes, so he's the obvious choice? I want him out of here.",
        "Barbara: He stays.",
        "Paul: No. It's my decision.",
        "Margo: It really doesn't matter, because this man isn't getting anywhere near my evidence.",
        "Rick: Oh. Well, then, I'll perform my own autopsy.",
        "Margo: Good luck with that. You're serving life in prison without parole. You have no jurisdiction.",
        "Rick: Well, I have a court order that says I do.",
        "Paul: So, in Oakdale, a convicted murderer can bum around a police station and play detective.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Paul, please, shut up.",
        "Rick: No. I'm not offended.",
        "Margo: Sociopaths rarely are.",
        "Rick: No, it's a legitimate question. It just so happens that my particular skill set has been proven to be very useful to law enforcement.",
        "Margo: You're working for the defense, Decker.",
        "Rick: Because Paul is innocent. You do want to find the real killer, right?",
        "Paul: Margo, you didn't answer my question before. Do you really want to find out the truth, or are you just trying to score one in the \"Win\" column?",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Let's go home. We'll talk about it.",
        "Rick: Well, in that case, I'm going to head back to the hospital and get started -- unless the good lieutenant has any objections.",
        "Margo: According to this, I can't stop you. Out you go. Everybody go. We'll be in touch. [Telephone rings] Hughes.",
        "Tom: Hey, Hon. Uh, can you get home for a little while? Uh, Casey's here. He wants to talk to us.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Glad to see Chris isn't bothering you anymore.",
        "Alison: He's not, and he's not going to. He is leaving Memorial for good.",
        "Susan: I know. Can't say I'm sorry about it.",
        "Alison: I'm just glad I won't have to run into him every time I turn the corner. That's why I didn't want to go back to court, Mom. I just want him out of my life for good.",
        "Susan: I can't tell you how happy that makes me to hear you say that.",
        "Alison: Anyway, I got to get these downstairs.",
        "Guard: What?",
        "Rick: It's my ex-wife. I'd, uh -- I'd prefer not to have to deal with her right now.",
        "Guard: Yeah, I got one, too. I know exactly how you feel.",
        "Rick: I seriously doubt that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Why would my mother throw in with a guy like Decker, especially after what he did to her?",
        "Meg: I don't know. But if he could help us in any way --",
        "Paul: He's a serial killer. He's got to be working some kind of an angle.",
        "Meg: Well, somebody murdered Sofie and her baby. The only way to come through this okay I -- is to figure out who it was.",
        "Paul: There's got to be an easier way to figure it out.",
        "Meg: Well, your lawyer doesn't think so.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe I should get another lawyer.",
        "Meg: Paul, I have a feeling about this. I do agree with you, Rick Decker is -- is a disgusting human being. But if he can find evidence to exonerate you, then I'm gonna thank him from the bottom of my heart. In the meantime, I'm just glad you're home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hi, Mom.",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Tom: Did you have any trouble getting away?",
        "Margo: Uh, it's been a hell of a day so far. I hope you're gonna make it better, not worse.",
        "Casey: I'm gonna try.",
        "Tom: So, go ahead?",
        "Casey: I'm done with Emily, okay? I mean it, Mom. You know, I had a lot of time to think about it, and -- I saw how crazy it really was, and I'm over it. And if it's okay, I would -- I would like to move back home.",
        "Margo: Yes, yes, yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison screams]",
        "Alison: Stop him! What are you doing?! That man is insane! Stop -- what are you doing?! He is insane!",
        "Chris: Let her go! What the hell are you doing?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Casey, it's me. You've got to be at your parents' by now. What's going on? Call me as soon as you know anything.",
        "Susan: You have lost your mind. I wasn't sure before, but now I'm sure.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? Calm down. It's not what you think.",
        "Susan: The fact that you have any contact with that boy at all --",
        "Emily: He's -- he's -- Casey's with Tom right now. He's trying to convince him not to take Daniel away from me.",
        "Susan: Well, why should Tom do anything Casey says after your little Mrs. Robinson act?",
        "Emily: You know what? Thank you for your support, Mother.",
        "Susan: In fact, Casey could make things worse.",
        "Emily: Well, unless you have a better idea, Casey's my only shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, I am so glad. I'm so glad. Here, sit. Eat. I'm so glad. Listen, Honey. The last thing that you need in your life right now is a woman like Emily Stewart.",
        "Tom: Oh, and I agree. I mean, we know how much you've done to turn things around. But to get involved with a woman with her past --",
        "Casey: Her past doesn't bother me.",
        "Margo: Well, all the more reason you should stay away from her.",
        "Casey: You know, I -- I bet there are plenty of girls' parents out there that would think the same thing about me. You know, being an ex-con and all. You know, do you think they would be right?",
        "Tom: It's not even the same thing.",
        "Casey: It totally is!",
        "Margo: No, it's not! Emily is irredeemable. You're not. She -- I don't want to talk about her. I don't care about her. I just don't want to lose you. And I'm so happy that you're back home.",
        "Tom: Hey, we both are.",
        "Casey: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Margo: Casey -- Casey, I promise you, I give you my word, that I'll -- I won't interfere with your privacy.",
        "Casey: Actually, I want a little more than that. I want you to drop the -- the case against Emily and let her have her parental rights.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: All right, just calm down. I'm with the cops. I didn't hurt the girl. I'm guarding the prisoner in there.",
        "Chris: In the morgue?",
        "Alison: It's Rick Decker. He had a syringe. That's how he killed all those people before!",
        "Chris: What? Decker's back? No, he got life without parole.",
        "Alison: He did. He did. And then -- then I saw him standing over Sofie and -- I just -- I forgot that she was already -- it was so -- it was just like before! It was like he never left.",
        "Chris: It's the morgue, Ali, okay? When they're in there, usually, the worst is over.",
        "Alison: I know, but you never know with that guy. He's pure evil.",
        "Chris: You'd better keep an eye on him.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Chris: It's okay. I've got you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hey. How did everything get so crazy?",
        "Paul: I don't know. But as long as we're together, nothing bad can happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Casey, what you're asking -- it's impossible.",
        "Casey: No, it's not. All you have to do is withdraw the court case. Say you changed your mind, you know? I bet it happens all the time, Dad.",
        "Tom: Then it goes against my conscience.",
        "Casey: But your conscience has no problem taking Daniel away from his mother? He loves her. Mom, look. What if you and Dad got a divorce, and he wouldn't let you see me anymore? You already know what it feels like to lose a son.",
        "Margo: Casey, stop. Stop bringing up Adam.",
        "Casey: Mom, so help me. Say something.",
        "Margo: No, it's not my place. This is between your father and Emily. And your father is not wrong. Emily is troubled. And Daniel needs to be protected from her.",
        "Casey: She loves him more than anything in this world.",
        "Tom: She's a prostitute, and I don't want her near either one of my boys.",
        "Casey: That's not your call, Dad.",
        "Tom: It is my call! I'll do anything in my power to keep her away from my children!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You're a smart woman. Casey Hughes? How could you?",
        "Emily: He's so sweet, Mom. Honest.",
        "Susan: And forbidden.",
        "Emily: Maybe.",
        "Susan: I'm sorry, Baby. I love you, but you have the common sense of an earthworm when it comes to picking the men in your life.",
        "Emily: At least I didn't marry a serial killer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, isn't this a pretty picture? It's like old home week.",
        "Chris: This guy says you're working for the cops now.",
        "Rick: That's right, forensic specialist. I get inside my enemy's mind. It's something I do easily, and quite well.",
        "Alison: This is really creeping me out.",
        "Chris: I don't know how you managed to maneuver your way to the other side, but as far as I'm concerned, you are and you always will be a killer.",
        "Rick: You can't take back the past, right, Alison?",
        "Chris: I'll be watching you.",
        "Rick: Be my guest. I'm truly sorry that I frightened you. See you again soon. Under better circumstances, I hope.",
        "Chris: Hey, don't let him get to you.",
        "Alison: I have to get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: They can't pin Sofie's death on you, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's not me I'm worried about. I finally have you here in my arms. I don't want anybody to rip you away from me.",
        "Meg: We fought so hard to get here. We won't let anybody take it away.",
        "Paul: How do you know?",
        "Meg: Because we're innocent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I can't believe you're the one hope to save my son.",
        "Rick: Believe it, Barbara. Because I've got good news for you. I can prove that Paul isn't the killer.",
        "Barbara: How?",
        "Rick: Sofie Duran was killed by a medical professional, someone who works at Oakdale Memorial.",
        "Barbara: How do you know that?",
        "Rick: Syringe came from the same lot at the hospital, private purchase order.",
        "Barbara: Anyone could have found that. They could have taken it from the garbage.",
        "Rick: Yes, but any non-professional would have just jabbed the victim and let the drug take its course. No, this injection went into Sofie's vein the very first try. No damage to the surrounding tissue.",
        "Barbara: So you're saying whoever it was knew what they were doing.",
        "Rick: It wasn't beginner's luck. Anyway, we're looking for a doctor or a nurse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mmm. [Cell phone rings] Aww. Hello?",
        "Barbara: Honey, it's me. Is Meg there?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you could say that. Meg's here with me.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Don't say anything, but we may have a problem. Meg may not be as innocent as she's led us to believe.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Meg: Are you saying I'm a suspect?",
        "Cole: You killed Sofie. I know you did because I saw you do it.",
        "Rick: It's well and good.",
        "Lily: Holden Snyder is a good, good man. Sometimes, it's a lot to live up to.",
        "Holden: I'll end my marriage for us."
