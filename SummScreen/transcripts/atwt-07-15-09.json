        "Luke shares with Noah a screenplay he wrote and Noah thinks this is what will help him out of the dumps. Meg learns that Paul is the one that caused the problems between Dusty and Damian, as Lily thinks this is going to be handled by the police. Meanwhile, Paul thinks he is sitting pretty when it comes to Meg. Damian and Dusty discuss framing Paul with a bomb, as Damian can't help but be leery of this plan. Noah meets his new professor and offers him Luke's screenplay to be approved for his project. Against Emma's advice, Meg goes to see Paul to confront him about his actions. Paul doesn't seem too upset, as Meg tells him that he has ruined any chance for them getting along and has forced her to feel she has to protect Eliza from him. Luke officially moves out and shares his good news with Lily and Holden about Noah using his screenplay for his senior project, but he also doesn't think that school is in the cards for him now. Noah's professor doesn't think Luke's screenplay is right for Noah and wants him to do something of his own. Noah is down about not being able to work with \u0091his boyfriend', as his professor tells Noah that he is willing to work closely with him on his senior project. Dusty goads Paul into meeting with him at Damian's warehouse, as Dusty has purchased the bomb. Damian admits to Meg about Dusty's and his plan, as she is upset that he is stooping to Paul's level. Damian tells her that he will get in touch with Dusty and call it off, as Meg races off too. Holden is unsure about Luke not continuing with school, but Lily supports him. Noah interrupts their conversation to speak privately with Luke where he breaks the bad news about his screenplay. Dusty and Paul meet, as they argue about what he has done. When Paul sees Damian arrive, he realizes he is being ambushed, but Damian wants out. Luke realizes Noah is working on a screenplay that doesn't involve him and wonders how he will explain not going back to school now. Meg shows up as Damian and Dusty are talking about what is going down and Paul realizes what they had planned for him, as Dusty realizes there is a problem with the timer on the bomb. Luke tells his parents that Noah is working on the screenplay alone and he may consider going back to school after all. Dusty yells for Meg and Damian to get out of there, as Paul grabs the bomb and takes off with it, as Dusty, Damian and Meg all watch the bomb explode."

        "Luke: Well, this is the last one.",
        "Noah: Okay.",
        "Luke: What? No cracks about how we're going to need another room just for my CD collection? Noah -- you okay?",
        "Noah: Sure. You ready?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Are you?",
        "Noah: Yeah. What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Luke: Well, you've been out of it all morning. Is this about your father?",
        "Noah: No, okay? My father is no longer part of my life. I -- I made that official when I burned all of his things. But along with all the medals, pictures, and stuff, went all the footage from my documentary.",
        "Luke: Are you afraid that you won't be able to find another senior project?",
        "Noah: I don't know how I'm going to come up with a whole new concept, shoot, and edit it in time to graduate.",
        "Luke: Well, uh, maybe I can help you.",
        "Noah: Oh, wait. Don't tell me. You've got a fully shot movie in there along with your comic books.",
        "Luke: Well, you are half right. How about a completed script?",
        "Noah: You're kidding?",
        "Luke: No. I -- I found it when I was packing. I -- I wrote it last year in a burst of creative energy.",
        "Noah: This is a short film?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I mean, I don't know how good it is, but I wasn't going to do anything with it anyway. So if you like it, what do you think?",
        "Noah: This is exactly what I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, tell me, what's new?",
        "Lily: Well, I guess you were as surprised as we were to hear about Paul.",
        "Meg: Surprised about what?",
        "Lily: I thought that Dusty had spoken to you.",
        "Meg: Well, Dusty came over, but Paul was here, and things got a little tense, so he left.",
        "Lily: And Damian didn't try to call you?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Well, with everything that has been going on between Dusty and Damian, I'm just trying to keep my distance. What's going on?",
        "Emma: What's Paul done now?",
        "Lily: It turns out the recent war between Dusty and Damian was all Paul's fault.",
        "Meg: Are you saying he somehow provoked them?",
        "Lily: He did a lot more than that. All those dirty tricks -- Damian's fuel line being cut, Worldwide losing a big client -- it was Paul all along.",
        "Meg: Why would he do something like that?",
        "Emma: Why would Paul do anything?",
        "Lily: Good way to keep the two of them busy, don't you think? Too busy to go after you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You're in a surprisingly good mood.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, why not? Meg and I are finally getting along. Spending more time with Eliza than I ever have.",
        "Barbara: Since when?",
        "Paul: Since, uh, Damian and Dusty have been showing their true colors. Meg can finally see those two for who they really are.",
        "Barbara: And who are they exactly?",
        "Paul: Two vicious, angry, controlling men.",
        "Barbara: Mm. Everything she's accused you of being.",
        "Paul: Exactly. Only those two are way worse than I ever was. And I get to be the loving, caring dad and coming out smelling like the proverbial rose.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's because you are a loving, caring dad.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. Well, Eliza -- she makes it easy, just like her mom. She's an angel.",
        "Barbara: Congratulations. You're finally doing everything right where Meg is concerned.",
        "Paul: I think I can honestly say for the first time in a long time that Meg is glad when she sees me.",
        "Barbara: Sounds good.",
        "Paul: It is good. Why do I get the feeling that you don't want to let it go at that?",
        "Barbara: Because I can't. Because you've been here with Meg before, and then something happens, and you get crushed.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but things are different now. I mean, this time, I'm finally doing it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know, I can't believe he's done it again. Just when I was starting to trust him, he started up with his lies.",
        "Emma: Sounds just like Paul to me.",
        "Meg: How could he think he could possibly get away with that?",
        "Lily: Because he almost did. I mean, it was really pretty clever when you think about it. If he had attacked Damian or Dusty directly, it might have been suspicious.",
        "Meg: So by siccing them on each other, making the other one believe that they were responsible --",
        "Lily: They were bound to escalate things on their own, and they did. Fortunately, they found out what was really happening, and they've turned everything over to the police, and they're going to let them handle it.",
        "Emma: It's something they should have all done in the first place.",
        "Meg: Mom, would you mind watching Eliza for an hour or two?",
        "Emma: Why?",
        "Meg: Because I'm going to give Paul a piece of my mind.",
        "Emma: Meg Snyder, don't you dare!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I've been thinking about the Paul situation.",
        "Damian: So have I.",
        "Dusty: Yeah? What's your take on it?",
        "Damian: You know, I was wondering if it would not be best after all to just turn the whole mess over to the authorities and let them handle it.",
        "Dusty: It'd spoil this. If we turn him in, he won't do time.",
        "Damian: Huh? Even with everything we have against him? The -- the positive identification alone would be enough --",
        "Dusty: No, no. It means nothing, trust me. He'll walk.",
        "Damian: All right. So what's your suggestion?",
        "Dusty: Stick to our agreement. Make Paul pay for what he's done.",
        "Damian: I have to admit that, uh, it would be nice to get Paul out of our lives and Meg's for a good long time.",
        "Dusty: I know just how to do it. It's simple. We do to Paul what he did to us. We set him up.",
        "Damian: How?",
        "Dusty: We need to use your warehouse down at the docks.",
        "Damian: All right. That can be arranged, depending on what we use it for.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to put a bomb there.",
        "Damian: Are you insane?",
        "Dusty: No. Paul is. Which is why he'll be responsible.",
        "Damian: Nobody would believe he'd do something so -- drastic.",
        "Dusty: Paul? Paul doing something that drastic? Are you kidding me? Nobody's going to bat an eye.",
        "Damian: When you say a bomb, you mean something that looks like a bomb, huh?",
        "Dusty: No, no. It's real. But you're going to get there with the cops in time to turn it off. I'll make sure you'll find Paul.",
        "Damian: It'd just be the same. It won't be enough to convict him.",
        "Dusty: It will be if it looks like he planted the bomb to kill me and frame you for my murder.",
        "Damian: So Paul goes to jail for something he didn't do instead of something he did?",
        "Dusty: The point is he goes to jail for a lot longer than he'd get for cutting a fuel line or stealing a laptop.",
        "Damian: Just one problem.",
        "Dusty: Only one?",
        "Damian: What if the police don't get there in time, and the bomb goes off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, I will get these over to the apartment. Uh, do you know how long your meeting with your advisor's going to be?",
        "Noah: No. No idea. But I will have something to talk about, thanks to this.",
        "Luke: Well, that -- that is very, very rough.",
        "Noah: Well, you will have plenty of time for rewrites when we start shooting.",
        "Luke: Oh. So we're working on it together?",
        "Noah: We have to be.",
        "Luke: I like the sound of that.",
        "Noah: You're going to work for me, Mr. Snyder. I run a tough set.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Luke: Well, now I am very excited.",
        "Noah: Professor Jarvis, I really hope I haven't kept you waiting.",
        "Mason: You haven't, and there's no need to be so formal. Please call me Mason.",
        "Noah: Okay, uh, Mason. Uh, I was really hoping I could talk to you about my senior project.",
        "Mason: Oh. I am really looking forward to seeing that. Your idea of exploring your relationship with your father in the military was fascinating, and it's timely.",
        "Noah: Thanks. Um, but I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to continue working on that project. Personal reasons.",
        "Mason: Oh. What do you propose to do?",
        "Noah: I have a screenplay ready. I just need your approval, and I can get started working on it right away.",
        "Mason: All right. If it's anything like your first project, I look forward to reading it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Thanks for the coffee, but I really should be getting home now.",
        "Emma: Would you like another cup of coffee, Lily?",
        "Meg: She said she wanted to go, Mama.",
        "Emma: Just a minute. I'm just being polite.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Meg, I'm -- I'm sorry if by telling you about Paul, I caused any problems.",
        "Emma: No, no, no.",
        "Meg: No, Lily, its fine. I needed to know.",
        "Emma: You did the right thing. Maybe now she'll cut him out of her life for good instead of just pretending to do so.",
        "Lily: Would you look at the time? Uh, I've got to go.",
        "Meg: Mama, I need to go see Paul to tell him about his behavior.",
        "Emma: What are you going to do? You going to give him another lecture? Meg, it is a waste of time. He does not listen, not even to you. Now, listen to me. The best thing you can do is just let Dusty and Damian handle this whole situation.",
        "Meg: He needs to know that his actions have consequences!",
        "Emma: Yeah, and so he can make another whole hundred excuses of why he did things. And you're just going to fall back into that old pattern again, feel sorry for him.",
        "Meg: How can you still think that I'm susceptible to him? Trust me, what I feel for Paul is not love!",
        "Emma: Opposite of love is not hate. It's indifference. And if what he's done can provoke this kind of feeling in you, he still has a hold on you.",
        "Meg: I am not going over there because of some kind of hold he has on me. I'm going over there to make him understand that I know what he's done and that I'm not going to forgive him for it.",
        "Emma: Meg, how many times have you done that?! What makes you think that this time will be any different?",
        "Meg: I need to say it. So are you going to watch Eliza for me, or should I take her with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'll set the timer so you'll have plenty of opportunity to get the police to the warehouse. Don't worry. I'm going to be there, too. I have no intention of dying just to put this guy behind bars. Nobody's getting hurt, except Paul.",
        "Damian: I assume you already have the bomb?",
        "Dusty: Not yet.",
        "Damian: All right. Let me at least set you up with someone who won't sell you a piece of junk.",
        "Dusty: Friend of yours?",
        "Damian: He's a demolition expert who's done some construction work for Grimaldi shipping. But he's not averse to making some cash on the side. Talk to him. He can make the necessary arrangements. Timing here will be crucial.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to tell me that. So -- how does it feel to be on the same side for a change?",
        "Damian: I don't plan to make it a habit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Meg.",
        "Meg: Barbara, I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Barbara: Well, I didn't expect to see you, either.",
        "Barbara: What a nice surprise. Where's Eliza?",
        "Meg: Uh, she's at home. Uh, Paul, we -- we need to talk.",
        "Paul: Okay. You want some tea? It's herbal.",
        "Barbara: You know, we need to plan a family outing is what we need to do. A picnic --",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm sorry, Barbara, but this is not a social call.",
        "Paul: So I guess the, uh -- the tea is probably out of the question.",
        "Barbara: What's wrong?",
        "Meg: Your son has been up to his old tricks again.",
        "Barbara: What have you done, Paul?",
        "Paul: I have no idea. But whatever it is, I'm sure we can work it out. Why don't you come sit down --?",
        "Meg: Forget it, Paul. I am not falling for your lies anymore.",
        "Paul: Okay, what is it that I am supposed to have done?",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: You have been sabotaging Dusty and Damian. You wanted each of them to believe that the other one was out to get them.",
        "Barbara: Why would Paul do something like that?",
        "Meg: Because by pitting them against each other, they would look bad and make you look good.",
        "Paul: Okay, I'll grant you that sounds like something that I might do.",
        "Meg: No, you have been trying to drive them out of my life so you could go right back into it!",
        "Paul: So what, you're taking Dusty's word over mine? Or is it Damian's words you're listening to these days?",
        "Meg: Lily told me.",
        "Paul: Oh. Well, do you have any proof? Do you have anything that would hold up in a court of law?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I -- I don't know. But if there were, I'm sure you'd find a way to get around it like you always do.",
        "Paul: Might I remind you that you were the one who decided not to press charges against me the last time?",
        "Meg: Well, those days are over. Dusty and Damian are on a warpath, and I -- I'm not lifting a finger to help you this time.",
        "Paul: Okay. So what? Two half-wits are after me, and I'm supposed to what, be threatened?",
        "Meg: I don't care if you're threatened or not. I no longer care about anything you do.",
        "Paul: Well, the fact that you're standing here says otherwise.",
        "Meg: I came here to make something very clear to you. You have driven me away. You have destroyed any remaining goodwill I had towards you.",
        "Barbara: Meg, no matter what Paul has done, he's still Eliza's father, and you two have to work this out.",
        "Meg: No, no, we don't! Paul, you have finally trashed any chance you had to be part of your daughter's life.",
        "Paul: You don't mean that.",
        "Meg: What do you have to give her that is of any value? If she's going to learn the difference between right and wrong, she's not going to learn it from you now, is she?",
        "Barbara: Don't do something you'll regret, Meg.",
        "Meg: I'm done, Paul. Finished. I will never trust you again. I didn't want to have to protect my daughter from her own father, but you have given me no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So, I told Meg what Paul had done.",
        "Holden: Yeah? How did she take it?",
        "Lily: About how you'd expect. When I left, she was making noises about going to see Paul, but Emma was dead set against it.",
        "Holden: I think Mom was right. Frankly, I wish Meg would stay away from all the men in her life right now. None of them are any good for her.",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Lily: You can't possibly be comparing Damian and Dusty to Paul.",
        "Holden: They all use every trick in the book to get what they want. And as far as Meg's concerned, it's just the same jerk, different day.",
        "Lily: You are never going to give Damian and Dusty the benefit of the doubt, are you?",
        "Holden: I don't have to. You cut them enough slack for the both of us.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Lily: Luke --",
        "Luke: Ah!",
        "Lily: You are just in time to keep your father from digging himself in any deeper.",
        "Luke: Ah! Well, you are on your own, Dad. I just took my last box to our new apartment. So as of now, I am officially moved out!",
        "Lily: Oh, well, Sweetie, I'm so happy for you.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Lily: I'm so sad for me.",
        "Luke: Oh, Mom! Mom.",
        "Lily: I don't want to see you go.",
        "Luke: Come on. I'm just moving in to across town, not across the country.",
        "Holden: Same thing as far as your mom's concerned.",
        "Lily: Don't pretend like you're not going to miss him.",
        "Holden: Hey, I'm glad to see him go. He needs to get out there and fend for himself.",
        "Luke: Oh, thanks, Dad.",
        "Lily: When can we have you and Noah over for dinner?",
        "Holden: Hey, will you at least let him get out the front door before you start?",
        "Lily: How about tomorrow night? And the night after that?",
        "Luke: Uh, well, I actually have asked Noah, but I just want you guys to know we're going to be pretty busy this summer. Noah is going to be making his senior project off of a script that I wrote.",
        "Lily: Oh! That's so wonderful.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. We're really excited to be working together. But it's going to be really intense, because, you know, making a film is like 24/7. I'm going to have so many rewrites, I'm probably going to be pulling my hair out.",
        "Lily: So what? You're making a movie!",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Holden: Luke's right. It's a big commitment. And you've got all your work at the foundation. Where is school going to fit?",
        "Luke: It isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Well?",
        "Mason: I can't let you do this.",
        "Noah: Why not?",
        "Mason: Well, for one thing, it's way too complex for a short. There's no clear arc for your protagonist. The transitions are all muddy.",
        "Noah: Okay, I -- I know it's not perfect. I know it needs work.",
        "Mason: Noah, you can do much better than that. Unless you don't want to. Come on, what's going on? This, uh -- this Luke Snyder -- what, you owe him money? You owe him a favor? What's going on?",
        "Noah: He's my -- my boyfriend.",
        "Mason: Oh.",
        "Noah: He's a good writer, too.",
        "Mason: I didn't say that he's not. And I -- I'll even say that that script shows promise. Noah, the choice between art and love is a lot older than either of us.",
        "Noah: Never thought of it as a choice.",
        "Mason: Well, when you're lucky, it isn't. But when it arises, choose the art. Hopefully, the love will be more forgiving.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but Luke is really looking forward to working with me on this. I don't know how to break it to him.",
        "Mason: Make me the bad cop. Tell him that your evil advisor wouldn't let you do his script.",
        "Noah: But I -- I have to do this screenplay. I -- if I don't, I don't have a -- a senior project -- I mean, not one that will be done in time to graduate with the rest of my class.",
        "Mason: You haven't got anything else?",
        "Noah: I've got one idea, but I -- it's sketchy. I mean, I tried to write out the whole thing, and I could just get a paragraph.",
        "Mason: All right. Let me see it. Come on. Let me see it. They say the million- dollar deal has been made for the words on the back of a cocktail napkin. Let me see.",
        "[Mason sighs]",
        "Noah: It's lousy, huh?",
        "Mason: Well, I don't know if I'd give you a million dollars for it, but, uh -- no. Noah, now we're talking.",
        "Noah: Really? I mean, you like it?",
        "Mason: Yeah, yeah. No, this is the seed to a good film.",
        "Noah: But how do I get from a paragraph to a full screenplay that I can shoot and edit with the time I have left?",
        "Mason: Looks like you need some help. Lucky for you, I am the man to provide it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Dusty and Damian are likely to press charges, and those charges will probably stick!",
        "Paul: Mom, I don't care about that. If -- if Meg succeeds in keeping me out of Eliza's life, I don't care if I go to jail!",
        "Barbara: Well, I do. And I want to know why -- why you always do the most insane thing imaginable instead of being straight with people?!",
        "Paul: Well, I learned from the best, didn't I? Tell me, Mother, when were you and James ever straight about anything?",
        "Barbara: I am not going to stand by and watch this happen, because you are headed for a disaster.",
        "Paul: Suit yourself. Get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Well, I hope you got that out of your system.",
        "Meg: I did, and it feels great. Thanks for asking.",
        "Emma: Good. Now maybe you can stay clear of him altogether.",
        "Meg: That's exactly what I plan to do.",
        "Emma: Damian, hello. Come in, come in.",
        "Damian: Hello, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Emma: Hi.",
        "Damian: Meg -- Meg, please, if you could just hear me out for a second. I --",
        "Meg: Okay, look, I owe you an apology.",
        "Damian: You do?",
        "Emma: Let me -- let me let you two be private. I'll check on my granddaughter here.",
        "Meg: I heard what Paul did to you and Dusty.",
        "Damian: So Dusty told you?",
        "Meg: Well, I'm -- I'm afraid I didn't give him a chance. Lily told me.",
        "Damian: Well, at least you know the truth.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry I blamed you for what Paul did.",
        "Damian: It's understandable.",
        "Meg: No, it's not. It's not. I -- I can't seem to get it through my head that Paul will never be the man I want him to be.",
        "Damian: It's always hard to believe that the people we love are capable of terrible things.",
        "Meg: Thanks. Anyway, I just came back from Fairwinds.",
        "Damian: Why would you go there?",
        "Meg: To tell Paul that I knew what he did and why and that he wasn't going to get away with it.",
        "Damian: Good.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I'm glad it's over.",
        "[Damian sighs]",
        "Damian: Oh, I only wish it were.",
        "Meg: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Damian: Meg, I have a confession to make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That's right. The Grimaldi warehouse on the docks. See you in a few.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Paul groans]",
        "Paul: Dusty. I should have known.",
        "Dusty: You were expecting my call?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Your girlfriend just left. I was, uh, kind of just waiting for you to weigh in with your usual empty threats.",
        "Dusty: Meg was just there?",
        "Paul: So, what are you going to do this time, huh? What do you and Meg have planned that you haven't already done to me?",
        "Dusty: You and I need to settle this, if you can remember how to be a man.",
        "Paul: Is that supposed to wound me?",
        "Dusty: No. That comes later. If you want to continue this conversation, you can meet me at the Grimaldi warehouse on the docks.",
        "Paul: The Grimaldi warehouse? Why?",
        "Dusty: So we can talk undisturbed.",
        "Paul: What do you want to talk about?",
        "Dusty: Only one way to find out, Paulie boy.",
        "Paul: When?",
        "Dusty: Now. Come alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Creaking noise]",
        "Dusty: Hey, you must be the demolition guy. I'm Dusty. I hear you do good work.",
        "Man: Well, I'll have to send Mr. Grimaldi a \"Thank you\" note.",
        "Dusty: You bring what we talked about?",
        "Man: Money first.",
        "Dusty: Let's get ready. I want you to set the timer, and I need you to walk me through what I have to do to turn it off.",
        "Man: You, uh, used to dealing with things that go boom? These babies are pretty sensitive.",
        "Dusty: Well, so am I. I'm a fast learner.",
        "Man: What are you going to blow up?",
        "Dusty: With any luck, nothing. Thanks. Let's hope we don't have to do business again.",
        "[Creaking noise]",
        "Dusty: I hope you're checking your messages, Damian. The bomb's all set. Paul's on his way. I'm counting on you to show up with the cops.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So Dusty wants to plant a bomb to frame Paul?",
        "Damian: I'm afraid so.",
        "Meg: Lily told me that you guys are going to go to the police to let them handle all this.",
        "Damian: Well, in a way, I'm supposed to bring the police to the warehouse with me.",
        "Meg: You know, it's bad enough I find out about Paul's involvement in all of this. Now you two want to take this madness to a whole new level!",
        "Damian: I never should have agreed to go along with Dusty's plan, I know, but --",
        "Meg: I don't understand why you were even tempted.",
        "Damian: I fell back into old habits. What can I say? A few years ago, I would have stopped at nothing to make Paul pay for his crimes, but now I -- I don't want to be that man anymore, thanks to you.",
        "Meg: I don't know what you want me to say. I -- I mean, you come over here, a -- and you tell me that you're part of a plan to frame an innocent man for attempted murder.",
        "Damian: Whoa. If Paul were truly an innocent man, none of this would be happening, Meg. Look, I -- I just came over to tell you the truth, okay? I didn't want you to find out from someone else and think I'd acted without even considering your feelings. That's all.",
        "Meg: So, what are you going to do now?",
        "Damian: I'm going to tell Dusty that I'm not going to take part in any of this. As much as I despise what Paul has done, I don't want to lower myself to his level.",
        "Meg: Well, it's a shame Dusty doesn't share this view.",
        "Damian: I'll convince him to let the authorities take care of Paul.",
        "Meg: That's the only sensible thing.",
        "Damian: Yeah. Ciao, Meg.",
        "Emma: Bye, Damian.",
        "Damian: Bye.",
        "Emma: What's going on?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I -- I thought this whole thing was over, but it's not, and --",
        "Emma: What are you talking about?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Mama, would you mind watching Eliza for a little while again, please?",
        "[Emma sighs]",
        "Emma: What is it this time?",
        "Meg: I need to stop World War III.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: When did you decide that you're not going back to school?",
        "Luke: Well, it wasn't a decision. I just have so much else going on right now. The foundation is working on a lot of really good projects.",
        "Holden: I -- I thought that the work at the foundation was supposed to be a way to make up for what happened with the school election, to prove to the dean and the faculty that you deserved a second chance to go back to school.",
        "Luke: Well, originally it was, yes, but it's become so much more than that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but is this what you want to do for the rest of your life?",
        "Luke: Dad, I -- I don't know if I want to make the foundation my career.",
        "Holden: Well, then, go back to school and keep your options open!",
        "Luke: Dad, honestly, I couldn't see myself being fulfilled going back to college right now.",
        "Holden: No, not right now, but you need to think about your future.",
        "Lily: Holden, if Luke's not ready to go back to school, I don't think we should push him.",
        "Holden: I'm not pushing.",
        "Lily: And -- and this movie that he's working on with Noah this summer -- it sounds like a great project.",
        "Holden: Okay --",
        "Lily: Who knows? He might end up being a filmmaker.",
        "Holden: How is this project that you're going to help Noah on going to get you anywhere?",
        "Luke: I'm going to be just as involved as Noah. And who knows? Mom might be right. This could lead to something.",
        "Lily: And this way, he'd have something to show the O.U. faculty, if one day he does decide to join the film program.",
        "Holden: Fine. You have to do what you think is best.",
        "Luke: Well, thank you for understanding.",
        "Noah: Oh. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Lily: Hi, Noah.",
        "Holden: Hi, Noah. I understand a congratulations are in order. You and Luke are going to be working on a project together?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I told them about the film.",
        "Noah: Uh, that's actually what I needed to talk to you about.",
        "Luke: Oh, of course, of course. Do you guys mind?",
        "Holden: Of course not.",
        "Lily: We'll leave you groovy, indie filmmakers to work.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Luke: So, what did he say? When can we start?",
        "Noah: We don't. He doesn't think I should shoot your script.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm here. What do you want?",
        "Dusty: Talk.",
        "Paul: That's the part where you use words. You know that, right?",
        "Dusty: I want to see if there's any way we can settle this.",
        "Paul: All right. Let's negotiate. These are my terms. I want my family back, and you and Damian can pretty much go to hell. You have a counteroffer?",
        "Dusty: I'll never let Meg go back to you.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, that pretty much ends the settlement negotiations.",
        "Dusty: I wish I could have been there when she let you have it.",
        "Paul: I'm sure she'll fill you in on all the gory details.",
        "Dusty: You set me and Damian up to destroy each other!",
        "Paul: Okay, that sounds interesting. Do you have proof?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, I do.",
        "Paul: I don't think so. I don't think you have enough, or you wouldn't have asked me here to negotiate.",
        "Dusty: You're too slippery for the cops, and I don't trust them to keep you from hurting anyone else.",
        "Paul: So you're going to take the law into your own hands?",
        "Dusty: You got it.",
        "Paul: Is that why I'm here at the docks? Don't tell me I'm going to swim with the fishes.",
        "Dusty: Nah. That's too crude.",
        "Paul: Well, you ought to know. Come on, Dusty. Don't keep me in suspense. How are you going to take care of me?",
        "Dusty: We need to come to an understanding.",
        "Paul: I don't see how that's ever going to happen. You got nothing. What the hell kind of ambush is this?",
        "Dusty: Are you alone?",
        "Damian: I am.",
        "Paul: Dusty, the two of you can't beat me up by yourselves? You were expecting Damian to what, bring hired help?",
        "Dusty: What are you doing?",
        "Damian: What I have to.",
        "Paul: What is he talking about?",
        "Dusty: Are the cops outside or not?",
        "Damian: Not. I came here to tell you the deal is off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Why would he turn you down like that?",
        "Noah: Mason thinks there might be some problems with the script.",
        "Luke: Wait, wait, wait. Who the hell's Mason?",
        "Noah: My advisor.",
        "Luke: Professor Jarvis?",
        "Noah: Oh.",
        "Luke: So he's \"Mason\" now?",
        "Noah: Okay, it really doesn't matter. He's my advisor. He's got veto power over my senior project.",
        "Luke: And he vetoed my script. Did he tell you why?",
        "Noah: He said there was some problems with the structure. He thought it had promise, though.",
        "Luke: Okay, well -- well, then, I can get some rewrites cooking. You know what? I have an idea to fix the structure.",
        "Noah: That won't work.",
        "Luke: Why not? Can't you just tell him that I need a little bit of time? I mean, would -- would a week be too much?",
        "Noah: I told him one of my ideas, and Mason -- Professor Jarvis -- he really liked it.",
        "Luke: But you told me that all of your ideas were really sketchy.",
        "Noah: Well, they are.",
        "Luke: So he would rather have you start from scratch than work from a completed script?",
        "Noah: He said he would help me work through it into a full screenplay. He's my advisor, Luke. I've got to do what he says.",
        "Luke: If you say so.",
        "Noah: We can work on something else together.",
        "Luke: No. You know what? It's okay. I mean, the only reason it matters at all is because dad got on his \"Luke needs to go back to college\" kick, and the only way I could shut him up is by saying that I would be busy working on your movie.",
        "Noah: But now that you're not, you could come back to O.U.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: Maybe it's time, Luke.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Oh! My boyfriend is turning into my father! Oh, it's so weird!",
        "Noah: I am not turning into your father. I just want you to find something that grabs you the same way that filmmaking grabs me.",
        "Luke: Noah, I have to tell you that the idea of going back to college does not grab me at all.",
        "Noah: Ah, but it might lead to something.",
        "Luke: Noah --",
        "Noah: If that does, would you just think about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hi, Emma. Um, I was hoping to talk to Meg.",
        "Emma: Well, I'm afraid she's not here.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, maybe you and I could have a talk.",
        "Emma: Of course. Come in. Would you like some coffee?",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. Thank you.",
        "[Barbara clears throat]",
        "Barbara: I just saw Meg at Fairwinds.",
        "Emma: When she went to talk to Paul.",
        "Barbara: If you could call that talking.",
        "Emma: Well, considering what he's done, he probably got off very lightly.",
        "Barbara: Meg needs to understand that no matter what Paul has done, no matter how irrational it might seem, it's always done out of love.",
        "Emma: Love?",
        "Barbara: Mm.",
        "Emma: Kind of twisted love, if you ask me. Now look, Barbara, please -- I know Paul is your son, but please -- please do not defend him to me, because he's used up every chance he's going to get. The best thing you can do for your son is to convince him that Meg is through with him.",
        "Barbara: I'm really not talking about Meg. I'm talking about the love he has for his daughter.",
        "Emma: Loving his daughter does not excuse the hell that he's put her mother through.",
        "Barbara: If Meg would just continue to let him see Eliza -- Emma, surely you don't want to deprive your granddaughter of her father.",
        "Emma: Barbara, are we forgetting how Paul tried to keep Eliza away from Meg?",
        "Barbara: I know he's made mistakes. He realizes that. He's tried to make up for it, too.",
        "Emma: By making a hundred more mistakes. Now, listen, if my Meg wants to cut Paul out of her life and her baby's life, he has really earned it.",
        "Barbara: You're angry, and I understand that. I really do. But -- but holding on to the past is not going to help Eliza. Now, we have to be better at that. We have to work together to help our children raise their daughter.",
        "Emma: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Barbara.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Emma: No. I love my daughter too much to see her go down that path again. No, no. Far too painful.",
        "Barbara: Want to talk about pain? If Meg goes through with her threat to keep Eliza away from Paul, she will end his life as surely as she was holding a gun to his head.",
        "Emma: And Paul will only have himself to blame.",
        "Barbara: Can Meg live with destroying my son? Can you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We had an agreement, Damian.",
        "Damian: Well, I reconsidered and decided I couldn't go through with it.",
        "Dusty: You were on board just a few hours ago.",
        "Damian: In the past, I would have gone through with your plan, but I have different priorities now.",
        "Dusty: This would have worked.",
        "Damian: Not this way. Not by stooping to Paul's level. I couldn't do that to Meg.",
        "Dusty: I see. You told her, didn't you?",
        "Paul: Told her what?",
        "Dusty: Shut up! Well, if the cops aren't coming, I got to activate the bomb.",
        "Paul: The -- what? You're going to blow me up?!",
        "Damian: Weren't going to kill you, Paul. Just scare you.",
        "Dusty: Put you where you belong.",
        "Meg: What the hell's going on here?",
        "Dusty: Meg, get out of here.",
        "Damian: He's right. You need to go. It's not safe.",
        "Meg: I am not going anywhere, not until I know that you're going to stop trying to hurt each other.",
        "Damian: I told you I was going to put an end to all this.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, and yet here you are with him and Paul, just the way Dusty planned.",
        "Paul: Poor Meg. So many men, so little trust.",
        "Damian: I told Dusty I wasn't going to play his little game. But Paul was already here when I arrived.",
        "Meg: Is that true?",
        "Dusty: Damian's an idiot? Yeah, it's true.",
        "Meg: Is this finally over?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Don't -- don't ask me. I'm the victim.",
        "Meg: You kept your word.",
        "Damian: And I always will.",
        "Paul: Oh, Meg, please. Don't be so quick to believe Damian. Who knows what he really wants from you? I mean, aside from --",
        "Damian: You shut your mouth.",
        "Meg: Okay, y -- you know what? Let's just get out of here. Come on.",
        "Dusty: We can't do that.",
        "Damian: Why not?",
        "Dusty: Something's wrong with the timer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey. You done so soon?",
        "Lily: I was going to make you some sandwiches so you guys could keep working.",
        "Luke: Yeah, um, Noah had to go.",
        "Holden: So, what's the next step on the movie?",
        "Luke: Uh, you're going to have to ask Noah. I'm not working on it anymore.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Luke: Just some school stuff.",
        "Holden: Is it because you're not a student?",
        "Lily: Holden --",
        "Holden: I'm just asking. Sometimes they don't let kids who aren't enrolled in school work on projects. Maybe Noah can't use an outsider.",
        "Lily: Will you just let this go?",
        "Luke: No, you know what? Dad's right. I got to thinking, and maybe I should look into going back to school.",
        "Holden: I don't think you'll regret it, Luke. I really don't.",
        "Luke: All right. Well, then, I will start making some calls.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll go talk to Lucinda so she can get things started on her end.",
        "Lily: What caused this change of heart?",
        "Luke: Um, you know, it's like I said. My summer opened up. Might as well take some classes.",
        "Lily: What happened with Noah?",
        "Luke: We just decided that it would be best if we didn't work on this together.",
        "Lily: You both decided?",
        "Luke: That's what I said.",
        "Lily: You're okay with that?",
        "Luke: Noah needs to do what's right for his project. And I'm sure it'll all work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I used to pray that no one would never compare Paul to James, and now, god help me, I'm doing it myself. Paul couldn't help who his father was, and Paul can't help that he has something inside of him that drives him to do awful things.",
        "[Emma sighs]",
        "Emma: Barbara -- Barbara, we all -- we all have our crosses to bear, and we all have our -- our battles to fight. You know, the important thing is we just can't -- we can't let those things be an excuse for hurting other people.",
        "Barbara: He's my son, Emma.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry, Barbara. My heart really goes out to you. But Meg is my daughter, and I have to think of her first. And I'm going to do everything I can to encourage her to stay as far away from Paul as she can.",

        "Dusty: You can blow up into a million pieces! Damian, get Meg out of here!",
        "Meg: No, I'm not going anywhere!",
        "Damian: You heard what he said. There's a bomb, and it's going to go off.",
