        "Lucinda: Have you heard from Lily?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: No. You?",
        "Lucinda: No. And I'm just a bit worried.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Well, I would not be. Uh, she's in good hands, no?",
        "Lucinda: What do you mean?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Well, she's with her business adviser, Monsieur Montgomery.",
        "Lucinda: Oh! No, no, no, he's not. He was there at the signing, and then they parted ways after that.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: I think not. I rang Lily last night to let her know that she was welcome to stay at my place.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Fran\u00e7oise, you are so nice. Thank you.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: She did not take me up on my offer. She said she found a room near the airport at the Sky King Motel.",
        "Lucinda: I know, I know. She texted me. It sounds just hideous.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: She wasn't alone when I called. She had company.",

        "Fran\u00e7oise: Oui. I recognized his voice in the background.",
        "Lucinda: Lily and Craig? No. No, no. It's -- that's not possible.",

        "Holden: Things are going pretty good right about now, don't you think?",
        "Molly: Yeah. You should see the bridesmaid dress I picked out for Faith. She is gonna look so beautiful in it.",
        "Holden: You know, I'm so happy that you guys get along and she feels like she can tell you things that she can't tell me or Lily.",
        "Molly: Yeah. I just got to be careful. I don't want to step on Lily's toes. I mean it. She was so cool with the whole Silas situation. I don't want to press my luck with her.",
        "Holden: Why are you so afraid that things are gonna go wrong? Everything is gonna be great. We're gonna have a great wedding and an amazing life together.",
        "Lucinda: Holden! Oh! This is fate -- fate that I ran into you. Uh, can I have a word with you?",
        "Molly: I'll go get us a couple iced --",

        "Craig: Yeah, I'm charming, I'm gallant, and I'm extremely helpful in a crisis. I know.",
        "Lily: Funny, those weren't exactly the adjectives I was considering using.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on. Who takes care of you like I do, Baby? I battled a vending machine last night for you, and I won.",
        "Lily: You weren't so brave when that little mouse was scurrying around our room.",
        "Craig: I'm better with inanimate objects. How did you sleep?",
        "Lily: Mm, considering the heat and all that scotch we drank, not too well.",
        "Craig: Want me to see if I can find you some aspirin?",
        "Lily: No. I'll be fine. How long have you been up?",

        "Craig: Let me call the airport.",
        "Lily: Oh, please let the flights be operating. I cannot spend another night in this dump.",
        "Craig: You and me both, Kid.",
        "Lily: No messages. I guess we didn't miss anything too important.",
        "Craig: Hey, considering the hand we were dealt, I think we did a damn good job at entertaining ourselves.",
        "Lily: You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, I really had fun last night, Craig.",
        "Craig: Me too.",

        "Lucinda: Lily had to fly to New York yesterday to sign the contract on the -- on the perfume.",
        "Holden: I know. She texted me. She told me that she was going in case something came up with the kids.",
        "Lucinda: I know. But then there was this strike in -- with baggage handlers.",
        "Molly: Right. We heard about that on the news last night, right before we went to bed. Didn't we, Holden?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, how lovely. And then on top of everything, there was a power outage in New York.",
        "Molly: Wow. Talk about bad luck.",
        "Holden: So she got stuck in the airport overnight?",
        "Lucinda: No, she found a motel nearby.",
        "Holden: Well, then, what's the problem then?",
        "Lucinda: I -- I googled it. I went online. And it's just -- it's hideous! It's hideous. She probably had to fight off vermin all night long.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, I heard the strike ended this morning. I'm sure she's on a plane, on her way back home.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't -- I don't think so.",
        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Lucinda: Well, because in New York City, I mean, they're not gonna get the airport up and running so quickly. Now, I'm sending the -- the jet. I cannot go, because I have a doctor's appointment, but you -- you can go in my stead.",
        "Holden: Wait a minute. Why does anyone have to go at all? It's your plane, your crew. They know Lily. She can get on the flight herself. She's handled a lot worse in her life, Lucinda. This is just a canceled flight and a couple of cockroaches.",
        "Lucinda: Well, not this particular cockroach.",
        "Holden: Excuse me?",
        "Lucinda: [Sighs] I just -- of course she can do it herself, if she has to. I just thought she's the mother of your children.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, it's a power outage and a canceled flight. She will be fine.",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. All right. You obviously have better things to do.",

        "Janet: I'll put it right here on this chair, and then I can take her with me from room to room, right? And that way, I can get a little exercise. I won't gain too much weight.",
        "Dusty: If you stop skipping out on meals, you won't have a problem with that.",
        "Janet: Well, don't diss my friends and I won't skip out.",
        "Dusty: What do you call your friend -- Tony, Blackie, Anthony?",
        "Janet: See? You're doing it again.",
        "Dusty: Well, he keeps changing his name.",
        "Janet: Well, so do a lot of Hollywood actors. Are you gonna run a background check on them, too?",
        "Dusty: Want to know why I'm worried?",
        "Janet: Not particularly, no.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda says he's an operator.",
        "Janet: He's an, um, commodities trader, broker, something like that.",
        "Dusty: He's trying to muscle his way into Worldwide. Millions of dollars are at stake. You're calling me suspicious?",
        "Janet: Okay. All right, all right. I -- I guess I understand. I, uh -- I overreacted a little bit myself last night.",
        "Dusty: Let's call a truce, okay?",
        "Janet: I don't know. Mona, what do you say? Should we call a truce? [Italian accent] Si, s\u00ed. I call a truce. She said okay.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Janet: Oh, excuse me. I'm expecting the feed store to be delivering. Hi.",
        "Delivery man: Hi. Are you Janet --?",
        "Janet: Ciccone. Ciccone, yeah. That's me. I know. It's hard.",
        "Delivery man: Sign here.",

        "Janet: Ooh! Sounds good. Thank you very much.",
        "Delivery man: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Hold on a second. I got something for you.",

        "Craig: Hold it. All flights delayed. Some are canceled.",
        "Lily: Boo! What about ours?",
        "Craig: It says we need to key in the flight number.",
        "Lily: 552.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lily: Oh. I'll get that. You get us out of here.",
        "Craig: As you wish.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Bonjour, Lily. I brought a copy of the, uh, signed contract for you. I thought why mail it, since you are still in town? Oh! Pardon.",
        "Craig: Bonjour.",
        "Lily: Craig -- this isn't what it looks like. There was only one room left, and -- Craig slept in the chair. Just -- just give us a second. We'll put our clothes on.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Oh, Ch\u00e9rie, please. What grown people do is their own business. Will, uh -- would it trouble you if I check my messages?",
        "Lily: No, no. Go right ahead.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: I simply cannot -- this light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Mm. Cottage cheese and pimentos. Who would have thought? [Laughs] You look really grossed out.",
        "Dusty: No. Your body's telling you what you need. Hey, I know there's a story behind these chocolates. What do you call them again?",
        "Janet: Turtles. Uh, when I was in middle school, the girls and myself -- we would sell these after school for various, uh, school activities -- sports and whatnot. And one year -- never mind.",
        "Dusty: Come on. Tell me.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, because it'll make you dislike Blackie even more.",
        "Dusty: No judgments. I promise.",
        "Janet: All right. One year, a whole box of these went missing from Mr. Carlucci's garage. Rumor has it Blackie was the culprit.",
        "Dusty: Stealing chocolates from the kids -- that's not nice.",
        "Janet: I thought you said no judgments. Never too early for chocolate. You want one?",
        "Dusty: Can't. It would make me an accessory.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. Try one, please.",
        "Dusty: No, I'm good. I got coffee. I'm good.",
        "Janet: Mmm. Oh, these are really good. But as good as these chocolates are, they are no comparison to this beautifully framed work of art.",
        "Dusty: I got to get going.",
        "Janet: Really? Why? Come on. Please stay. I -- I promise, okay, no more joking. I'll make you a real breakfast.",
        "Dusty: I got a meeting. I'll call you later.",
        "Janet: Hey, Dusty -- thanks for Mona.",

        "Fran\u00e7oise: Here is the deed to the building.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Uh, the workers' safety regulations. And this is the latest inspection from the provincial government.",
        "Lily: Wow. That's a lot of inspections. And it's in French, so I can't read it that well.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Oh, well, I can translate whatever you don't understand.",
        "Lily: Does this say that there's something wrong with the water quality?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Oui. Uh, the plant's, uh, filtration system must be upgraded. Also, the sewer lines and, uh, some electrical things must be brought up to code.",
        "Lily: This doesn't sound like minor upgrades.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: No, no, it's not.",
        "Lily: Fran\u00e7oise, how much is this gonna cost me?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Total? I'm not sure. Maybe, uh, 500,000 Euros.",
        "Lily: [Gasps] That's three-quarters of a million dollars.",
        "Craig: [Sighs] Is it essential that we make these upgrades right now?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: The inspector says so.",
        "Craig: And what if we don't make them?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Uh, fines -- large fines. You see, uh, this is how business is done.",
        "Craig: You're saying that it's a bribe.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: I am saying it is a good idea to make friends with the inspector early on. He is a cousin of the mayor.",
        "Lily: Mm. Really? Well, you can tell the inspector and the mayor that I don't pay bribes.",
        "Craig: Well, it's not that simple, Lily.",
        "Lily: It is to me. I mean, if these upgrades are legitimate, that's one thing. But if these are just made up so that some corrupt public official can squeeze money out of us --",
        "Craig: We have plenty of time later on to tell him what's what. The important thing is to get the fragrance into production.",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Craig, this is a lot of money.",
        "Craig: Yes, but it's my money.",
        "Lily: Which is why I can't let you do it.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because this will just be the first in a long line of expenses. If we go down this road, you could end up losing your shirt.",
        "Craig: Listen, all we have to do is pay enough to bring the factory up to code. It's not that big a deal.",
        "Lily: Yes, it is. This is extortion, and I won't do it. The deal is off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily can get on a jet without my help.",
        "Molly: Yeah. You do know why Lucinda was pushing the \"She is the mother of you children issue,\" right?",
        "Holden: Yes. Because she wants to manipulate me back into Lily's life any way she can because she thinks we're destined to be together.",
        "Molly: Yeah, like everyone else.",
        "Holden: But you know what? Lucinda needs to stop meddling in everyone else's life and just worry about her own.",
        "Molly: I'd like to hear you tell her that. That should make a really big impression. [Laughs] Holden, I mean it. If you want to go pick Lily up in New York, the jet probably hasn't left yet.",
        "Holden: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Molly: Caught. No. What do you think?",
        "Holden: I think maybe you want me gone so you can meet the caterer all by yourself and pick out all the food all by yourself.",
        "Molly: Oh, you think -- oh, the caterer! I totally spaced. What time is it? We need to get home and get showered. Come on.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right. Um, I have an errand to run.",
        "Molly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: I got to go to the bank. Why don't you, uh, go over to the Lakeview, and I'll meet you there?",
        "Molly: Okay. All right. I really hope we like the chef's food and that he can do what we want within our budget.",
        "Holden: Would you stop worrying about our budget? I want this wedding to be the wedding that you have always wanted to have.",
        "Molly: As long as you're at the altar, it will be. Oh, you make me so very happy. Mm. I'll see you soon.",

        "Fran\u00e7oise: I am sorry. I don't understand.",
        "Lily: I'm backing out of the deal.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: This is something you cannot do.",
        "Lily: I can, and I am. There's a clause in the contract -- what is it, page five? That says that you will disclose to the buyer any and all financial obligations pertaining to the sale of the property. You knew about these inspections and what they would cost me, and you didn't disclose it. That puts you at fault and makes the contract null and void.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: You know that if you try to buy another factory in the same region, you will encounter the same inspection issues, I can guarantee you.",
        "Lily: Well, then, I won't be buying a perfume factory, because I refuse to play that game.",
        "Craig: Maybe we should all just take a step back and look at the big picture.",
        "Lily: Which is?",
        "Craig: That this facility has everything you need under one roof.",
        "Lily: But it's not worth it.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: No, no, it's fine. I can easily find another buyer. I will have the money put back into your account by the end of the day.",
        "Craig: Uh, no, Fran\u00e7oise. S'il vous plait, un moment.",
        "Craig: Lily, you can't let this deal fall apart over a few lousy Euros.",
        "Lily: It's hardly a few lousy Euros.",
        "Craig: Listen, when you think of the capacity that this -- this facility has to generate profit, 500,000 Euros is a drop in the bucket.",
        "Lily: Are you really okay with putting out more money?",
        "Craig: I am. But will you be?",
        "Lily: It's your call. You are the silent partner in all this, after all.",
        "Craig: Okay. Fran\u00e7oise --",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Huh?",
        "Craig: We have decided to pay the upgrades.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: You mean the deal is back on?",
        "Craig: We'll wire you the money as soon as we get back to Oakdale.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: [Laughs] C'est merveillieux. Merci bien. This is a good decision, Lily. You will not regret it.",
        "Lily: And, Fran\u00e7oise, no more surprises, no more undisclosed financial obligations. Because if you do, the deal really will be off.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Absolument.",
        "Lily: All right. I'll walk you to the stairs?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Merci.",

        "Craig: Holden, is that you?",
        "Holden: What are you doing in Lily's hotel room?",
        "Craig: You know, it's the most amazing coincidence. I was in New York doing some business, and I went out to the airport to catch my flight home. And wouldn't you know, that's when the baggage-handlers strike settled. And -- and so I went out to the taxi stand to stand in line for a cab, and who was there? Lily.",
        "Holden: And you both just happened to pick the same hotel?",
        "Craig: More like it picked us. It was the only hotel close to the airport that had any vacancies. So we, uh, snapped up the last two rooms.",
        "Holden: That still doesn't explain what you're doing in her room, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm sharing a cab back to the airport with Lily. Holden, all these questions, you almost sound jealous.",
        "Holden: Put Lily on the phone.",
        "Craig: She's not here. She went down to the desk to settle her bill.",

        "Lily: Was that the airline?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lily: Do we have a flight?",
        "Craig: No. I was on endless hold, and then I got cut off. I think we should just go down to the airport and get on the first flight we can.",
        "Lily: I agree.",
        "Craig: Okay. Do you have all your stuff?",
        "Lily: What stuff? I didn't bring anything.",

        "Dusty: Well, she grew up with the guy. Old friend from Chicago, A.K.A. small- time punk called Blackie.",
        "Lucinda: Blackie? That's quaint.",
        "Dusty: He sent Janet chocolates today.",
        "Lucinda: Well, no wonder you're knickers are in a twist.",
        "Dusty: He says he's doing business with you.",
        "Lucinda: Did he now?",
        "Dusty: You don't seem surprised.",
        "Lucinda: Why would I be?",
        "Dusty: You're not returning his calls.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, gosh. There are many people I wouldn't know, many men, from Adam. They claim that they do business with me, you know? Smell the goodies. When you're rich and powerful, you're everyone's best friend.",
        "Dusty: Well, Blackthorn specifically said he was doing business with you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, maybe -- maybe, Darling, he was just trying to impress his former girlfriend.",
        "Dusty: Janet was never his girlfriend.",
        "Lucinda: Well, maybe he would have liked her to have been or he's thinking she's going to be.",
        "Dusty: Whatever, whatever.",
        "Lucinda: And -- and this is what's got -- got you so upset?",
        "Dusty: This guy is trying to infiltrate our company, Lucinda. I want to put an investigator on him.",
        "Lucinda: No. I -- I think that would be --",
        "Dusty: You don't think he's after Worldwide?",
        "Lucinda: No, I don't, okay! I don't! Back off, please.",
        "Dusty: Is that an order? Sounds like an order.",
        "Lucinda: You're the one that told me Janet doesn't like it when you manipulate and when you're jealous. So why would you bother Janet about anything so trivial?",
        "Dusty: Now you're concerned about my love life?",
        "Lucinda: [Laughs] Darling, mwah! I just want you to be happy. That's all I want.",
        "Dusty: Since when?",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Forget about it. Do whatever you want. Go. Go and investigate Blackthorn right until the cows come home. But when Janet gets upset 'cause you're sticking your nose in her business, don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, hi. It's me. I was just calling to make sure that you're okay. You're probably on a flight home already. Listen, uh, I'm calling because -- I'll call you back later. Bye-bye.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hey. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Janet: I've got the day off today. Let me tell you, as hot as it is outside, it is downright freezing in that root cellar.",
        "Holden: Aren't those the pickles my mother made last fall?",
        "Janet: I had a craving. Do you think she'd mind?",
        "Holden: No. They're there to be eaten. How are you feeling?",
        "Janet: Um, so far, so good, but let me tell you, come September and it's sweltering outside, you can find me in the pond. I'll be the whale in the bathing suit.",
        "Holden: I don't think so. It's been a while since we've had a baby in this house.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] They grow up so fast, don't they? Gosh, I can't believe Liberty already graduated from high school.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Life keeps moving forward, even with all its changes.",
        "Janet: It sure does. And, you know, no matter how hard you try, you just can't explain your past to somebody. No matter how well you know them or how much you love them, they just don't understand, because they weren't there. Where did that come from?",
        "Holden: No clue.",
        "Janet: Okay, sorry. Do you want some breakfast? I can make you some breakfast.",
        "Holden: No, no. I'm actually heading out to the Lakeview to meet Molly. Wedding plans.",
        "Janet: Oh. All right. Well, how about a pickle? You better take one now, 'cause I guarantee you, in ten minutes, they'll be gone.",
        "Holden: They're all yours. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Mr. Blackthorn, uh, don't turn around. Just wait for the elevator. I'm gonna read my newspaper. You really have to learn to keep your mouth shut.",
        "Blackthorn: Excuse me?",
        "Lucinda: You told Janet Ciccone you were doing business with me.",
        "Blackthorn: How do you know Janet? Dusty Donovan.",
        "Lucinda: You made a mistake there, Mr. Blackthorn. Or what exactly did you tell her? Should I call you Blackie?",
        "Blackthorn: It was an offhanded comment. That's all. Nothing more. I'm surprised it even registered with her.",
        "Lucinda: It's a big mistake. Now Mr. Donovan is asking questions.",
        "Blackthorn: Let him. He's not gonna find out anything.",
        "Lucinda: You don't know him. When there's something that interests him, he's like a dog with a bone.",
        "Blackthorn: Then find a way to distract him.",
        "Lucinda: That's easier said than done.",

        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Lily: I just got your message. I was on the plane. Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. I was just calling to check on you.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Holden: I ran into Lucinda this morning, and she told me that you got stuck in New York overnight.",
        "Lily: Can you believe it? A strike and a blackout all in the same day -- I mean, how often does that happen?",
        "Holden: Not too often, I imagine. Good thing you had Craig there to keep you company.",
        "Lily: How did you know Craig was with me?",
        "Holden: Because when I called your hotel room, he answered the phone. He didn't tell you?",
        "Lily: Why were you calling me?",
        "Holden: To see how you were doing.",
        "Lily: Did you call to check up on me for my mother?",
        "Holden: Oh, right, right. I always do everything your mother tells me to do. I always have, right?",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Holden: She was worried about you. That's all.",
        "Lily: Ah. Was she worried that I was in a strange new place or that I was in the evil clutches of Craig Montgomery?",
        "Holden: Both.",
        "Lily: Listen, Craig is practically family. He was living here until not too long ago. His son still lives here.",
        "Holden: So you guys just happened to run into each other?",
        "Lily: Yeah. That's right.",
        "Holden: Whereabouts?",
        "Lily: Midtown.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, that's strange, because Craig said that you guys ran into each other at the airport.",
        "Lily: We ran into each other midtown first and then we happened to be waiting for the same flight. And then that got canceled, so we shared a cab to the motel, and we booked a couple of rooms. What?",
        "Holden: Did I say anything?",
        "Lily: Sometimes you don't have to. Look, you can call the motel and -- and see about our reservations. You can find out what movies we rented.",
        "Holden: How did you watch the movies during a blackout?",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You know what I mean.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I'm sure you guys found a way to entertain yourselves.",
        "Lily: Holden, I went to New York on business -- my business. Who I ran into there is none of your concern.",
        "Holden: Got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Anthony, thanks for coming by.",
        "Blackthorn: No problem. What's up?",
        "Craig: I just got back from New York. Came across an opportunity I think we need to jump on right away.",
        "Blackthorn: What kind of opportunity?",
        "Craig: Increasing our stake in Worldwide.",
        "Blackthorn: Really? How much are we talking about?",
        "Craig: 500,000 Euros.",
        "Blackthorn: That's a lot of dough. Euros why? Worldwide is an American company.",
        "Craig: With international holdings. Oh, and I do need that money in my account by the end of today.",
        "Blackthorn: That's a quick turnaround. I got to talk to my peeps.",
        "Craig: I thought you said capital was no problem. Besides, this -- this gives us a chance to take an even bigger chunk out of Lucinda Walsh's hide. Isn't that what we both want?",
        "Blackthorn: For me, this is strictly business. For you, it sounds personal.",
        "Craig: I'm motivated. That's a good thing.",
        "Blackthorn: As long as it doesn't cloud your judgment.",
        "Craig: Well, you know, maybe you're not the right partner on this particular project. It's okay. I can get another backer.",
        "Blackthorn: Take it easy. I'm in. It's just starting to get a little expensive.",
        "Craig: You got to spend money to make money, my friend. And I can guarantee you this investment is gonna pay off big-time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.",
        "Molly: It's all right.",
        "Holden: No, it's not. I know how important choosing the menu for the reception is for you.",
        "Molly: For you, too, right?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Absolutely. So, uh, what have you tasted so far?",
        "Molly: Just the entrees.",
        "Holden: Yeah? Which one should I try? Which one did you like?",
        "Molly: Well, I like the pasta and the fillet, but they're not gonna taste as good now that they're cold.",
        "Holden: That's good. I like that. That's good, too. That's a keeper.",
        "Molly: Holden --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Molly: Food interests you about as much as fashion does. So what's up?",
        "Holden: Nothing.",
        "Molly: Oh, come on. I'm gonna keep bugging you until you tell me.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. When I went home, I kept thinking about everything that Lucinda said and about Lily being stranded in New York. So I decided to call her motel. When I did, guess who answered the phone?",
        "Molly: I don't know.",
        "Holden: Craig.",
        "Molly: No way. Craig was in Lily's hotel room? What was he doing there?",
        "Holden: He claimed they ran into each other at the airport and then wound up finding rooms at the same hotel.",
        "Molly: Well, I guess that's possible.",
        "Holden: Except when I talked to Lily about it, she said that they ran into each other in midtown.",
        "Molly: So you think one of them is lying.",
        "Holden: It sure looks that way.",
        "Molly: And you think because of that that they're involved?",
        "Holden: What other explanation could there be?",
        "Molly: Holden, Lily is very needy right now, and yeah, she's made some terrible choices in the past, like with Damian, but Lily's too smart to get involved with Craig Montgomery.",
        "Holden: Are you just saying that to make me feel better, or do you really believe it?",
        "Molly: Lily is not involved with Craig, Holden. I'm sure of it. And even if she was, it's like you said to Lucinda. Lily is a grown woman. She's perfectly capable of taking care of herself.",
        "Holden: She is.",
        "Molly: So she doesn't need saving from Craig or anybody else, right? Especially not from her ex-husband.",
        "Holden: Right. So whatever's going on between Lily and Craig -- I'm staying out of it.",

        "Lucinda: I'll check. Um, what's it a photo of?",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: You will see.",
        "Lucinda: It's downloading. Oh. My heavens.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: I thought you would find it interesting.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's not. It's not interesting. It's -- it's appalling. This was not part of the plan.",
        "Fran\u00e7oise: Pardon?",
        "Lucinda: [Sighs] How did this happen? [Sighs] I couldn't save Sierra. I certainly couldn't save Bryant. But you're gonna hurt Lily? Over my dead body. Hello, Darling. Yeah, it's me, and you know who that is. I think it's time for you to come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Blackthorn clears throat]",
        "Blackthorn: That answers my question. You got the turtles. So, are they as good as the ones you used to sell when we were kids?",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh. They are so much better. You should try one. Do you want some coffee or something?",
        "Blackthorn: Absolutely, if you got time.",
        "Janet: Sure I do.",
        "Blackthorn: All right. She takes hers black.",

        "Janet: Pregnant, Italian. See the resemblance?",
        "Blackthorn: Forget about it. You are much prettier.",
        "Janet: Aw. You always were a sweet talker. Dusty brought her over this morning. In fact, I thought that was Dusty when you knocked just now.",
        "Blackthorn: Listen, you and me -- we, uh -- we can be honest with each other, right?",
        "Janet: Sure.",
        "Blackthorn: Look, I know I can get a little talkative when I trust someone, and I trust you. But you don't -- you know, you don't have to tell your boyfriend everything I say, okay?",
        "Janet: What are we talking about?",
        "Blackthorn: I mentioned that I wanted to do business with Lucinda Walsh.",
        "Janet: You said you are doing business with Lucinda.",
        "Blackthorn: My point is, somehow, it got back to your boyfriend.",
        "Janet: Well, that's 'cause I told him. Blackie, you didn't tell me to keep it a secret. And, by the way, Dusty's not my boyfriend.",
        "Blackthorn: Oh. What is he then?",
        "Janet: We're working that out.",
        "Blackthorn: Well, on second thought, uh, I will have one of these here -- turtles.",

        "Molly: What do you like?",
        "Holden: I like both of your choices.",
        "Molly: The pasta and the fillet? Okay, and what about for starters? The little puff-pastry, smoked-salmon thingies?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Molly: And the eye of newt? Yeah, good save. Holden, are you really that worried about Lily possibly being involved with Craig?",
        "Holden: For the sake of my kids, yes. She already made one bad choice that affected them.",
        "Molly: Exactly. That's why she won't do it again. She knows she messed up with Damian, and she knows what it cost her.",
        "Holden: So she'll use better judgment now?",
        "Molly: Right. So that means that Craig is kicked out of the picture. Anybody who would get involved with Craig is nuts.",
        "Holden: You're right. Lily doesn't need my advice. She can take care of herself. But you can't.",
        "Molly: I can't?",
        "Holden: No. You need my help in making a decision on this wedding cake. So why don't we do that? We got vanilla, chocolate. Let's try the vanilla.",

        "Craig: I didn't? Oh. Sorry. I -- I meant to do that.",
        "Lily: Oh, please, Craig. I know you. You purposely kept Holden's call from me, and I want to know why.",
        "Craig: Okay. I meant to tell you, really. I was going to tell you on the way to the airport. I was going to tell you on the plane.",
        "Lily: But?",
        "Craig: Holden wanted to know why I was in your room, and I had to come up with a plausible excuse. And I couldn't let him know that I'm backing Carlisle fragrances.",
        "Lily: So you just told him that we ran into each other at the airport?",
        "Craig: Yes, yes. And I was gonna tell you what I told him so we'd have our stories straight, but --",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Craig: I know how much you hate lying, and I knew that if you found out I had lied to Holden that you might not want to be in business with me, and I just didn't want that to happen, so I -- I found a way to justify in my mind to just avoid the whole issue, okay?",
        "Lily: Hmm.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: What a coincidence. I do hate lying. And that's exactly how I feel right now. I don't feel comfortable with this whole silent-partner thing. So we're gonna come clean.",
        "Craig: No, really.",
        "Lily: Yes. I'm telling everyone that you're bankrolling Carlisle fragrances. We'll just let the chips fall where they may. And if you don't want to be part of the company under those terms, I will buy you out.",
        "Craig: No, no. I -- I want to be a part of it, if -- if you want me to be. I just want you to consider the consequences.",
        "Lily: I know that Carly will be angry with me.",
        "Craig: Angry? She'll be more than angry. She'll quit. And Holden will find ten different ways to say I told you so. And Lucinda -- well, Lucinda will just use that as an excuse to second-guess every move you make for the rest of your life. Personally, I think that would be a shame, because I saw you with Fran\u00e7oise. You are one hell of a good businesswoman. But you do what you have to do.",
        "Lily: All right, all right. We'll keep these financial arrangements until the company is off the ground. But then full disclosure.",
        "Craig: That's my girl.",
