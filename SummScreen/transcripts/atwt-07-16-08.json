        "Carly: I've forgotten how amazing New York City is -- the people and the buildings, the energy.",
        "Neal: Not to mention the shopping.",
        "Carly: Oh, yes. Can't forget that. The incredible, amazing shopping.",
        "Neal: I wish you'd let me pay for something.",
        "Carly: No. No, you paid for lunch. You're paying for the hotel rooms. The shoes are on me. Literally! You like them! Aren't they great?",
        "Neal: Beautiful.",
        "Carly: Neal, thank you so much. This trip is exactly what I needed. I didn't even know how much until we got off the plane.",
        "Neal: Well, that was the point. And to think, this is just the first stop. We haven't even gotten to Paris yet.",
        "Carly: Paris? You're spoiling me. And I love it.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Neal: May I say, just for the record, you have the most intoxicating laugh. You should do it more often.",
        "Carly: I could work on that.",
        "Neal: Please. Do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Barbara: This is what happens when you hang up on your mother. You force her to show up in person.",
        "Paul: You couldn't take a hint? If this is about what you were saying on the phone, I don't want to hear another word about it. You can turn around and leave.",
        "Meg: Wait, wait. What was she saying on the phone?",
        "Paul: Doesn't matter.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it does matter. Paul, no more secrets. Remember? You promised. I want to know.",
        "Barbara: Rick Decker has completed his autopsy on Sofie.",
        "Meg: Did he give you the results?",
        "Barbara: In person. It seems there's enough physical evidence to prove that Paul is innocent.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: That's great.",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Meg: See, I told you. It's over.",
        "Barbara: Unfortunately, that's not true.",
        "Meg: Why? If Paul's in the clear, then I --",
        "Barbara: Well, this new evidence implicates you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Guard: Are you almost done?",
        "Rick: Well, considering the luxury accommodations the state provides, I'm in no rush to get out of here, even if here is the hospital morgue.",
        "Susan: The morgue is exactly where you belong.",
        "Rick: Susan. As lovely and irreverent as I remember you every night.",
        "Susan: Spare me your flattery. Alison said she saw you. Wow. Only you would have the unmitigated gull to show your face around here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Rick Decker thinks that I murdered Sofie and you believe him?",
        "Barbara: I didn't say that, Meg.",
        "Paul: You don't need to listen to anything she says.",
        "Meg: But you think it's true. You think I did it.",
        "Barbara: Apparently, the syringe used to kill Sofie was purchased for use at Memorial Hospital, and due to the accuracy of the injection, Rick thinks it must have been administered by a medical professional.",
        "Meg: And that would be me, right? A medical professional? The same medical professional who sat up with you when you were sick? Who held your hand and wiped your forehead when you had nausea and the shakes? The same person would plunge a needle into a pregnant woman's arm and leave her for dead?",
        "Barbara: I'm only telling you what the report is going to say. I'm not accusing you of anything, Meg.",
        "Meg: You don't have to. The look in your face says it all.",
        "Paul: Meg. Hey, where you going?",
        "Meg: I'm going out. You can deal with her. I'm done.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Is this how you get your kicks now? Slicing open the dead?",
        "Rick: I work for the state now as a forensic specialist.",
        "Susan: That's right up your alley, isn't it? Although it must be a bit of a letdown in some ways.",
        "Rick: How's that?",
        "Susan: Everybody's already dead. They can't suffer at your hands the way the rest of us did.",
        "Rick: She's a little bitter over the way our marriage ended.",
        "Susan: No, I'm just bitter that I married you at all.",
        "Rick: Well, you know, I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Susan: Hmm.",
        "Rick: Because despite everything, you can't deny we had our moments, my darling.",
        "Susan: Don't call me that.",
        "Rick: Oh? And these hands that you say you suffered at, well, there was once a time when they could get you to do anything I wanted.",
        "Susan: Hmm. Want this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Neal.",
        "Neal: I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: No, no. It isn't you.",
        "Neal: I kissed you.",
        "Carly: Yes, you did. And, um, it was very nice. I'm just not -- I'm not ready for anything like this right now.",
        "Neal: Beautiful city, beautiful lady. Can't blame a guy for trying. As long as he didn't make a hash of it, right? I mean, the last thing I want to do is scare you off.",
        "Carly: You didn't.",
        "Neal: Good. Listen, Carly, this trip -- there's no strings attached, no expectations. All I want is for you to have a good time.",
        "Carly: I am. I am having a very good time, except my back is killing me. Honestly, I do not know how women run around this city in shoes like these. I really don't.",
        "Neal: Well, say no more. I know exactly what you need -- a massage. Not from me. From the spa downstairs. Why don't you give them a call and have them come up and work their magic?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. And while I'm being ridiculously pampered, what will you be doing?",
        "Neal: Well, I've got that meeting to prepare for. If I want to make a good impression, I better get to work. Why don't you call Scott and have him come up?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Neal: And I'll check in on you later.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Neal: Pleasure.",
        "Carly: Hello. This is Carly Tenney in Room 312. I would like to arrange for an in-room massage, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This foundation you are starting for sick children and their families, it's a wonderful idea.",
        "Luke: Well, seems like the least I could do with all the good luck I've had. And if this foundation helps even one sick kid, well, I guess it's worth it.",
        "Lily: You astound me. You do. I mean, you could have done anything with this money from Damian.",
        "[Luke chuckles]",
        "Luke: Yeah, I could have given it back. But if I did that, then Damian would know that he still gets to me. And at least this way I feel like I'm doing something good with the Grimaldi name.",
        "Lily: It's the Luke Snyder foundation. You remember that.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just --",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: Dad seemed awful quiet when I got that letter from Damian. Are you sure he's okay with me doing this?",
        "Lily: He trusts you to make the right decision. He believes in you 100%.",
        "Luke: I hope so 'cause part of the reason I'm starting this foundation is because I feel it's something that Dad would do.",
        "Lily: I agree. Holden Snyder is a good, good man. Sometimes it's a lot to live up to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay, Scott, I'm ready. Scott? [Knock on door] Yeah, Scott, the door's open. Come on in. I know that I shouldn't be embarrassed, and I'm gonna try not to be embarrassed. I know there's nothing here that you haven't seen before, right so, I'm ready. You can just start -- my back here.",
        "Holden: Hi, Carly.",
        "Carly: You can't be here. You have to go.",
        "Holden: No, I can't.",
        "Carly: No, you need to go.",
        "Holden: I need to --",
        "Carly: The masseur is coming back. He'll be here in a second.",
        "Holden: No, he's gone. I paid him off.",
        "Carly: What are you thinking? What are you doing here?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing.",
        "Carly: You need to go home. You need to forget about me.",
        "Holden: I've tried that. It doesn't work. I've tried to get you out of my mind. I can't do it.",
        "Carly: You need to try to think about your wife. You need to think about Lily.",
        "Holden: Oh, I have, trust me. Carly, I sat on that plane before we took off. I could have walked off that plane, but I didn't do it.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you?",
        "Holden: Because I can't stand the thought of you being here with that guy.",
        "Carly: This isn't like that. Neal and I are in different rooms. We're on different floors.",
        "Holden: Yeah? For how long?",
        "Carly: That isn't fair.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on. I've seen the way he looks at you. I heard him say how beautiful he thinks you are. It drives me nuts. I don't want him anywhere near you.",
        "Carly: Stop it! You have to stop this! Who I'm with and where I go shouldn't matter to you at all.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Carly: Because you're married.",
        "Holden: Am I? My marriage, I don't know what it is anymore. I've tried to fix it. I can't do it. I've taken time. I've taken space. It doesn't work. I want to be with you. All the time. You say you feel the same way and I'll end it.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Holden: I'll end my marriage for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Are you gonna do anything?! She just threw hot coffee on me!",
        "Susan: Too bad it wasn't sweetened with potassium chloride.",
        "Rick: That was a lifetime ago.",
        "Susan: Only to the people you murdered.",
        "Rick: Would you get her out of here? She's impeding government business.",
        "Susan: Don't worry. I'm gonna send my congressman a letter of apology. I -- I can show myself out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, I just have a couple of questions about the night of the murder. You said that you saw Paul Ryan in the hallway outside of Sofie Duran's room. Um, how did he seem to you? Was he upset? Was he agitated?",
        "Wendy: He seemed fine. Little annoyed I left my cart in front of his door. It was his girlfriend who was upset.",
        "Margo: His girlfriend?",
        "Wendy: Meg Snyder.",
        "Margo: Meg Snyder was here the night of the murder? When?",
        "Wendy: Uh, little before I saw Mr. Ryan. She was inside the room with Sofie Duran. I heard them arguing.",
        "Margo: Really? What were they arguing about?",
        "Wendy: I was stripping sheets in the room next door, so I really couldn't make it out, but it didn't sound friendly.",
        "Margo: Uh, Wendy, why didn't you tell us this before?",
        "Wendy: Management expects us to use discretion when it comes to our guests.",
        "Margo: The police expect you to talk when you're being questioned in a murder investigation.",
        "Wendy: Is Miss Snyder gonna be in trouble because of me?",
        "Margo: It's Mrs. Ryan now, and that remains to be seen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, if it isn't the pride of Memorial's nursing staff herself. And if you forgive me for saying so, Mrs. Ryan, you look angry enough to kill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Just bothered me that Dad seemed so distant after I decided what to do with the money. Do you think it's because the money came from Damian?",
        "Lily: What difference does that make?",
        "Luke: Well, when Damian came back a few years ago and wanted me to go to Italy with him, and when I said yes, the look on Dad's face -- it's like he felt I was choosing between the two of them, and I don't want the money to be a reminder of that.",
        "Lily: It doesn't. See your dad knows that Damian tricked you. He would -- he would never hold that against you.",
        "Luke: I hope so. Because if I did have to choose, I would choose Dad every time. He's my father. He's the man who raised me. He knows I can't be bought off. I just -- I want him to know how much I love him.",
        "Lily: Oh, Baby, he does. He is so proud of his son. And so am I. You know what? He's just -- he's just been a little distracted lately. He's -- he's got a lot on his mind.",
        "Luke: Like what? Mom, are you and Dad okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You are not gonna end your marriage.",
        "Holden: Carly --",
        "Carly: You are not gonna leave Lily for me. You need to go home, Holden. You need to leave me alone.",
        "Holden: I can't do that.",
        "Carly: Yes, you can. You can go back to Lily, and you can put all of this out of your mind.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. If I do that, what are you gonna do?",
        "Carly: Whatever I have to.",
        "Holden: Oh, so you think that running off to Paris with Neal is gonna make you forget about us and how you feel about me?",
        "Carly: If you think this is any easier for me, you're wrong. I hate needing to go halfway around the world to forget what I'm feeling.",
        "Holden: So you admit it. You're running away.",
        "Carly: We all know that I am more than capable of ruining my own life. But I'm not gonna do that to you. I'm not gonna do it to Lily. Damn it!",
        "Holden: Here, let me get it. Carly, I don't want to chase you away.",
        "Carly: I can't be what you want me to be.",
        "Holden: And what's that?",
        "Carly: Yours. May I have the robe, please?",
        "Holden: Carly, sending me away is not gonna change one thing. It's not gonna make me stop thinking about you. And we meant it, every second --",
        "Carly: Stop it! You have to stop it! You can't say these things to me! It isn't right!",
        "Holden: I can't do what's right anymore.",
        "Carly: I can! And I won't do it! I will not be that woman! I will not be that woman who steals her best-friend's husband! I won't do it! I couldn't live with myself if I did it!",
        "Holden: I can't live with myself right now. Being so close to you, I just --",
        "Carly: Just what?",
        "Holden: I need you. I need to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You think you're clever, don't you?",
        "Rick: In what way?",
        "Meg: I look like I could kill?",
        "Rick: That was just a figure of speech.",
        "Meg: No, it's not. Not when you're going around trying to accuse me of murder.",
        "Rick: I never accused you of anything. Well, now, this is interesting. I tell Barbara that I believe that Sofie Duran was killed by someone who works at the hospital, and then you come charging in to defend your good name. Why is that?",
        "Meg: I just want to know why you're trying to pin this on me.",
        "Rick: Meg, I never said you did anything. I mean, if my educated opinion led Barbara to suspect you, then I suggest you bring it up with her, not that I would expect you to take responsibility for anything notwithstanding.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? Why is that?",
        "Rick: Because you're a woman. And women, they never take responsibility for any of the damage they inflict -- the pain, the suffering. No, they just -- they just move on to the next victim.",
        "Meg: Well, that's ironic coming from you.",
        "Rick: You know, I never understood how that kind of behavior earned you and your kind the title of the weaker sex.",
        "Meg: I'm gonna say this once because I have no desire to waste my time with you, but I didn't kill Sofie Duran.",
        "Rick: But you could have. Very easily. And given your vocation, you'd know how to cover your tracks, how to make sure you didn't leave a bruise, how to use a cephalic vein for maximum impact. And you'd know how to inject the needle at exactly 45 degrees to make sure that there was no sudden swelling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Lisa, did you ever hear or see Meg Snyder threatening Sofie Duran?",
        "Lisa: She is the most lovable, gentle person in the whole world. You can't even compare her to Paul or even Barbara for that matter.",
        "Margo: Barbara? Why'd you bring Barbara into the mix?",
        "Lisa: No reason whatsoever.",
        "Margo: No?",
        "Lisa: It's just that -- no. It's just that I used her as an example.",
        "Margo: As in an example of someone who might threaten Sofie Duran?",
        "Lisa: Oh, no, no, I didn't say that.",
        "Margo: Lisa, we can have this conversation here where it looks like we're having a cozy little chat, just you and your gorgeous daughter-in-law, or we can take it down to the station where it won't be so cozy.",
        "Lisa: I don't want to do that.",
        "Margo: No, you don't want to do that.",
        "Lisa: Now, okay, look, all I -- I can remember is I do know and Sofie said that Barbara had threatened her.",
        "Margo: Threatened her how?",
        "Lisa: I -- she told Sofie that she would kill her if she didn't leave Paul alone and disappear.",
        "Margo: Barbara Ryan threatened to kill Sofie Duran.",
        "Lisa: That is only what Sofie told me. I never heard Barbara say that.",
        "Margo: Did you believe her?",
        "Lisa: No, of course not. She was such a liar.",
        "Margo: Well, somebody killed Sofie. And between Barbara and Paul and Meg, it's not so much a question of why. It's who got to her first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Get away from me!",
        "Guard: Hey, break it up!",
        "Rick: That woman just attacked me!",
        "Paul: No, he came after my wife with a syringe.",
        "Guard: Is that true?",
        "Rick: No! I mean, yes. I was trying to explain to her how I came to my -- my autopsy report.",
        "Paul: My wife did not kill Sofie. You take that report, you get out of town. I don't want you on this case anymore.",
        "Rick: Okay, fine, Paul.",
        "Paul: And you stay away from my family!",
        "Rick: Anything, Paul. Just to make it easier on you.",
        "Guard: Come on, let's go.",
        "Rick: Don't forget my report.",
        "Guard: Yeah, okay, good. Get out. Come on, Decker.",
        "Margo: Ah, Webster, take the good doctor back to the holding cell, the one with no windows.",
        "Webster: You got it. Dr. Decker, this way if you will.",
        "Rick: Just a minute. Detective.",
        "Margo: Lieutenant.",
        "Rick: Lieutenant, I hope you get a chance to read my autopsy report on the Duran girl.",
        "Margo: No, I don't think I will. We had our own autopsy done by a doctor who's not serving a life sentence for multiple homicides.",
        "Rick: Oh, that's the trouble. Your M.E. can look at the body only in technical terms. I bring a different perspective to it.",
        "Margo: Would that be the \"How I would have done it\" perspective?",
        "Rick: It's worked in 14 prior cases.",
        "Margo: Do you have any idea how disturbing you are?",
        "Rick: What do you care if it helps solve the case? Leave the report for her. I'm sure she'll want to read it. Enjoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, Barb. Looking good, you know, considering.",
        "Barbara: Cole Norbeck? What the hell are you doing in here? How did you get in here?",
        "Cole: I wanted to talk.",
        "Barbara: I don't want to talk. Get out of here!",
        "Cole: Still with the orders, huh? I read somewhere how near-death experiences can actually humble some people. What happened? No white light waiting for you?",
        "Barbara: You know what's waiting for you? A cell. I'm calling the police.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, you do and you'll have to explain this.",
        "Barbara: That's my medication. Give that to me.",
        "Cole: No. See, this is morphine. And that's what killed my Sofie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know it's been tough on you watching us go back and forth for so long.",
        "Luke: I just want things to be good between you guys again. I hate seeing you so sad.",
        "Lily: Happy. [Luke laughs] Your dad has moved back in. And even though we haven't had a chance to go away, the fact that he wants to means so much to me.",
        "Luke: It's a shame that you couldn't go to Louisville with him.",
        "Lily: I didn't say everything was perfect. But you know what? We're going back to what's important. We're finding all those little things that make each other happy. You know, the stuff we took for granted. I think we're gonna be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We shouldn't have done that. We should have stopped ourselves.",
        "Holden: How?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Neal: Carly, it's Neal. How's the massage coming along all finished?",
        "Carly: Neal, the massage guy just left. I was just gonna call you.",
        "Neal: That's all right. May I come in?",

        "Holden: Carly, stop.",
        "Carly: I can't help it. I'm such a liar. And I'm good at it, too, because that was easy. That's all an affair is, really, isn't it? One lie on top of another.",
        "Holden: No, this isn't that.",
        "Carly: This isn't what? This isn't an affair? Where does Lily think you are right now? Out getting milk? If we're gonna do this, we may as well call it what it is.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. Fine, it's an affair. But you know what? It's not just -- it's not just sex for me. I have feelings for you. And I'll tell you what -- they're real, just like the feelings you have for me.",
        "Carly: But I've got no right to have them. I wish to God I didn't.",
        "Holden: So what are you gonna do now?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I can't just go home with you.",

        "Margo: I spoke to one of the maids at the Lakeview. She said she heard you arguing with Sofie Duran the night of that Sofie was murdered. Is that true?",
        "Meg: Yes, I did go see Sofie that night.",
        "Margo: And you argued?",
        "Meg: Yes, but it certainly wasn't the first time.",

        "Margo: Well, that must have been a shock.",
        "Meg: Uh, not at first. 'Cause I didn't believe it. So I went over to her room to confront her about it.",
        "Margo: What did she say?",
        "Meg: Uh, that it was true, and she showed me a sonogram and told me that they went to the appointment together and that Paul believed that the baby was his.",
        "Margo: That must have been very upsetting.",
        "Meg: What do you want me to say, Margo? I mean, Sofie had accused Paul of rape. I mean, I had every reason to believe that this was just another lie.",
        "Margo: Until she showed you that sonogram. Listen, I can't imagine what you were feeling, showing up and thinking that Sofie was once again gonna lie through her teeth, and then it turns out that she's telling the truth. And now she has photographic evidence and once again you're the last to know. You were angry.",
        "Meg: Yes, I was angry.",
        "Margo: Were you angry enough to kill her?",
        "Meg: I would never, under any circumstances. For God sake, she was pregnant.",

        "Dr. Schiller: Is this Paul Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I am so sorry, but there was a mix-up I my office when you and Sofie were here.",
        "Paul: What kind of mix-up?",
        "Dr. Schiller: I'd rather explain it to you both in person. Would you be able to stop by my office?",

        "Barbara: No.",
        "Cole: I think you took a happy shot, because by now, you're real good at it. You started to relax, started thinking about Sofie and all the things she'd done to you. Then you got mad, real mad. So you took your needle and you filled it with juice. You went to Sofie's room and you knocked on her door, only Sofie was on to you. She wasn't gonna let you in. So you said you wanted to talk about your grandchild. You wanted to find a way to be a family, the one thing Sofie wanted more than anything. Smart but cold. So she let you in, but you were so high that she couldn't even close the door before you jammed the needle in her arm.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no.",

        "Paul: Look, I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. On the phone, you said there was some kind of a mix-up. Was there something wrong with the baby?",
        "Dr. Schiller: No, no. I don't think so. I just wanted to see Sofie to do another sonogram.",
        "Meg: Another one? Why?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, I'm going to look into how this happened, but I believe that there may have been a clerical error with the original one.",
        "Paul: How could there be a clerical error with a sonogram?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, there was a sonogram attached to Sofie's file, but our clerk found another one in the filing cabinet with her name on it.",
        "Meg: So there were two?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Yes, and they don't match up. The one that we found in the filing cabinet indicates that the fetus was actually much younger than we had initially thought.",
        "Meg: Younger? So you're saying you miscalculated the date of conception?",
        "Dr. Schiller: According to this second sonogram we found, yes. Based on the weight and the size, there's no way that Sofie was two months pregnant at the time of this sonogram.",

        "Paul: It wasn't my baby.",

        "Carly: No. At least no pressure from you anyway.",
        "Neal: You're not making any sense.",
        "Carly: Neal, I like you. You're smart. You're funny. You're very handsome. The truth is, I was using this trip and you to help me get over somebody else. That isn't fair. I'm sorry.",

        "Carly: How did you know? Did you know all this time?",

        "Carly: Oh, I am so sorry.",
        "Neal: No, don't be. Clears a lot up for me. I never knew what I did to rub the guy the wrong way. Now I know.",

        "Carly: I didn't plan any of this.",
        "Neal: The whole thing or him following you to New York?",
        "Carly: All of it. I don't even know how to explain how it happened. I haven't told anybody about it. I don't really have anyone to talk to. I think maybe if I had, if I had spoken to somebody, I probably would have come to my senses and just stopped it.",
        "Neal: Carly, these things happen. Emotions get muddled, tangled up. I'm not saying what you did is right, but I'm not going to judge you for it.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Although you have every reason to.",

        "Meg: So, it wasn't your baby. Sofie did lie about everything, and she deceived the both of us.",
        "Paul: Yeah, not just us. Think about it -- somewhere out there, the real father of Sofie's baby may not even know that he is a father.",
        "Meg: Or maybe he does. Maybe he's the one that switched the sonograms.",
