        "Barbara gives a stunned Will and Gwen access to his trust fund. When they see the size of the check, Gwen and Will dream about what they can do with the money. Gwen and Will thank Barbara for this, as Will reaches out a bit to her. Maddie watches Lia kiss Casey while brandishing a knife. Jade interrupts and Maddie is able to cover, but Jade is more and more suspicious of her behavior. Jade asks Casey if the police know more about the fire and if they will arrest the person? Casey wonders why she cares? She thinks she knows who started it. Outside, Maddie sees Lea's car and goes into a trance as she envisions Casey and Lia kissing inside. She stabs at her car seats as she sees herself fending off someone in a darkened room in the same stabbing motion. Lia sees Maddie destroying her car and Casey rushes to her side. A freaked out Maddie yells for him not to touch her. Casey tells Gwen to call his mother. Simon approaches Lucinda about a job, but hides when Katie and Mike appear. Lucinda thinks Simon is back for Katie but he claims he is back to settle down for good, but it has nothing to do with Katie; Lucinda is suspicious. Simon sends back Katie's ring with a cordial but simple note, and Katie sees this as a sign that he is now accepting they are together forever; Mike is skeptical. Emily seems ready to plead guilty when Dusty barges in on the proceedings wanting to be heard. Paul tries valiantly to stop him, but Dusty will not be deterred. He tells Tom if he goes to trial, it will be without his testimony. Tom reluctantly admits without Dusty they have no case. A desperate Paul tries to stop Emily's imminent release by tearing open his shirt to reveal his bullet wound scar, which Emily gave him. Meg testifies on his behalf and she is convincing as a nurse, but when Cass questions whether she actually saw Emily pull the trigger, the case falls apart. The judge reluctantly drops the charges on that count as well and sets Emily free. As Emily and Susan celebrate, a determined Paul threatens that he will not let her hurt their child, but Emily orders him out of her way since he can't touch her anymore."

        "Jade: Maddie? What are you doing?",
        "Will: Thanks. Didn't you get anything?",
        "Gwen: I'm not thirsty. Unless you have an extra three bucks.",
        "Will: No. So we'll share.",
        "Gwen: No, it's okay. You're the one who needs to think. You get the caffeine.",
        "Will: This is so lame.",
        "Gwen: I get paid tomorrow.",
        "Will: I got to go back to the hospital job.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. You finish school, all right? We'll make it. Besides, your mom said that she was going to give you the trust fund, so --",
        "Will: Oh right, the trust fund, the magical, mythical trust fund that she likes to dangle in our faces.",
        "Gwen: I don't think she was lying. I mean, not now. If anything, it seemed like she was desperate to keep us around.",
        "Will: Yeah, after the memorial, it was probably pretty hard to be alone. So she said whatever it took, you know, to get us to stay.",
        "Gwen: But you don't think she meant it?",
        "Will: Well, that's the thing with barbara ryan -- she absolutely means it, at the time.",
        "Gwen: That's why she's so convincing.",
        "Will: Yeah, exactly. But it never lasts.",
        "Gwen: Okay. So, I guess we are on our own. I get a paycheck tomorrow. If I perform a couple of times this week that's a few extra bucks.",
        "Will: So how's it look? You think we can go on a date?",
        "Gwen: You mean that magical, mythical date that we keep talking about? Let's see -- oh boy, well -- no movies out for a while. But we can buy pay-per-view at carly's, and pop our own corn. That's only, like, 69 cents a bag.",
        "Will: So, we're set. 'Cause I didn't see any of the movies that came out last summer.",
        "Gwen: All right. We have a date.",
        "Barbara: Hey, guys. I'm glad I found you. Carly said you might still be here studying.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm trying to catch up.",
        "Barbara: Good.",
        "Gwen: Is everything okay?",
        "Barbara: I hope so. It's about your trust fund.",
        "Will: Let me guess.",
        "Barbara: Well, it's been a little more complicated than I thought.",
        "Will: Uh huh.",
        "Barbara: But, I've done it. You'll be getting your money today.",
        "Mike: You still got it?",
        "Katie: It's never coming off my finger.",
        "Mike: Well, it's insured this time.",
        "Katie: I mean it. I am never letting this ring go again.",
        "Mike: Well, just in case you get washed out to sea and stuck on an island with a con man you used to be married to --",
        "Katie: Like that could ever happen! So glad to be home.",
        "Mike: I hope not too glad to go out.",
        "Katie: Are we still celebrating our never-ending honeymoon?",
        "Mike: Maybe. Why don't we start with a table for two at the lakeview?",
        "Katie: Sounds perfect.",
        "Lucinda: Um, I don't want anything. Look -- I think there's been a mistake, but I'm going to ask anyway. Are you missing any cash from your cash register?",
        "Bartender #1: Not that I know of, ma'am.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Has any wealthy female guests said that somebody's stolen all her money?",
        "Bartender #1: No, ma'am.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I was afraid of that. I'm the victim of a prank. Unless, of course, there's been a big lug of a guy with a down under accent and a big smile lurking around your bar? All right.",
        "Simon: Ah, it always did take you forever to ask the right questions.",
        "Lucinda: Simon!",
        "Simon: In the flesh. Come on, you can be honest with me. You always have been. You missed me, didn't you?",
        "Judge: Ms. Stewart, tell the court how you plead.",
        "Emily: Your honor, on advice of my counsel, I --",
        "Dusty: Wait!",
        "Judge: And who are you?",
        "Dusty: I'm the victim, and I want to be heard.",
        "Cass: Your honor, we request an immediate recess.",
        "Dusty: Not before you hear what I have to say.",
        "Tom: Your honor, mr. Donovan was the victim in this crime. He has understandable concerns. He doesn't wish to see this defendant escape without punishment. Perhaps if we can assure him that there is a deal in place that guarantees jail time --",
        "Dusty: I don't care about your deal.",
        "Cass: Your honor, the district attorney is absolutely right. We have already been through substantive negotiations --",
        "Dusty: You want to be a hero, counselor? Sit down.",
        "Cass: Your honor, we still request a recess, a brief recess.",
        "Judge: You have one minute.",
        "Cass: Thank you, sir.",
        "Tom: We will get you your justice, dusty.",
        "Dusty: No you won'T. You can'T.",
        "Paul: What's dusty going to do? He's going to let emily go.",
        "Meg: We don't know that. He could want emily in jail for life.",
        "Paul: Meg, you know him. What do you think he's going to do?",
        "Meg: I can't tell. But if he tries to let her off the hook, we'll deal.",
        "Judge: Okay, let's have it. First, ms. Stewart will enter a plea. Ms. Stewart? Counselor? The charges are felony kidnapping and attempted murder. How does the defendant plead?",
        "Emily: Not guilty. Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs",
        "Tom: Your honor, may we approach?",
        "Paul: Dusty, you can't let emily go. Not after what she did to you.",
        "Dusty: Get away from me.",
        "Susan: Emily, we should've talked to dusty ourselves before the hearing.",
        "Emily: No, this is right.",
        "Susan: What makes you so sure he's here to forgive you?",
        "Emily: Mother, this is what I've been hoping for all along. He loved jennifer, and she wanted this.",
        "Susan: Paul loved jen --",
        "Emily: It's not the same.",
        "Susan: Then why won't dusty even look at you?",
        "Cass: My client hadn't formally entered a plea. She has the right to change her mind.",
        "Tom: So, you really want to take your chances with a jury? Really? I mean, even if dusty is here to tell us all that he's forgiven emily, there's still evidence.",
        "Judge: Okay, the deal you two had is obviously off the table, correct? So, let's step back and set a trial date. A plea has been entered, and we're proceeding. I'll expect filings by --",
        "Dusty: Your honor! I want to be heard.",
        "Judge: And you will be, mr. Donovan. Now that a trial's been set, you can testify and then you can give a victim's impact statement --",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no, no. I don't want a trial.",
        "Judge: That's not up to you, mr. Donovan. The district attorney has a case. He can still present it.",
        "Dusty: No, you won't go to trial with me. I'm done.",
        "Tom: Dusty, let's talk after the hearing.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. I'm done talking. I'm done with all of it.",
        "Tom: You need to decide this, then.",
        "Dusty: You go to trial, you go without my testimony. You understand? It's over.",
        "Jade: What's your problem?",
        "Maddie: Who says I have one?",
        "Jade: Bad move.",
        "Maddie: What? I haven't done anything.",
        "Jade: You're not watching casey and lia?",
        "Maddie: I saw them, but I wasn't watching them. Casey and I broke up, so, whatever --",
        "Jade: Uh huh.",
        "Maddie: Why are you hanging around here for?",
        "Jade: I work here. I came here to set things up and open up. We're lucky this place didn't burn to the ground.",
        "Maddie: We?",
        "Jade: Everybody. Especially the person who set the fire. Maybe the cops will go easy on them.",
        "Maddie: I hope not.",
        "Jade: You're a real freak for punishment, aren't you? I'll see you around. [ Jade clears throat ] Sorry. I have to get set up for tonight.",
        "Casey: No problem.",
        "Lia: Hey, you want to go somewhere?",
        "Casey: Like -- ?",
        "Lia: I don't know. Someplace we can be alone.",
        "Casey: You know what, jade's right. If we're going to open tonight, I need to make sure the sound system's working, so --",
        "Lia: I wonder if that's why she did it.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Lia: Maddie. I mean, if she wanted to punish you, what better way to do it than set a fire. I mean, you love this job.",
        "Casey: Lia, back off. Maddie did not start the fire.",
        "Lia: I'm just -- I'm worried about you, okay?",
        "Will: I'm getting my trust fund?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Will: Really?",
        "Barbara: Yes, really. And I'm sorry it took so long, but there were a lot of conditions that had to be adjusted in order for you to get early access, and I had no idea there was so much paperwork involved, but honey -- I've done it. It was good for me. I needed to focus on something.",
        "Will: Great.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you should stay busy, barbara. It'll be good for you.",
        "Barbara: Over here, jess. Now, jessica has everything with her, and assuming everything's in order --",
        "Will: We're signing papers today?",
        "Barbara: Are all the papers ready?",
        "Jessica: Yes they are. I just had to wait for the bank to set up the account. How're you doing?",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Jessica: This will remove any previous codicils or restrictions. Barbara, I just need your signature here.",
        "Will: I'm getting my trust fund?",
        "Barbara: Yes, honey.",
        "Will: What's the catch?",
        "Jessica: There is no catch.",
        "Will: No, I get it, like, when I'm 50, you know -- or she picks out my clothes and my career for --",
        "Barbara: I deserve that.",
        "Jessica: Will, you're getting your trust fund. Right now. So, as of today, you're going to have a lot of your friends eating their hearts out.",
        "Lucinda: You think I missed you? Well, yes, as a matter of fact -- you know, somebody should keep their eyes on you at all times, as a public service.",
        "Simon: Well, I missed you too.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Simon: And I heard about lily. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah. But she's going to be back on her feet. I'm determined.",
        "Simon: Good. Then it'll happen. In the meantime, if I can help you, if you need anything, absolutely.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you, thank you. Well, look. You've brought sincere simon back to town. Oh, what is going to befall us? What is going to happen? What are you here for? Why did you lure me to this bar?",
        "Simon: Lure you? No. This is all completely innocent. I just want to buy you a drink.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, because I'm one of the few people left in town that you haven't bilked?",
        "Simon: One of the few who appreciated a fellow-- entrepreneur.",
        "Lucinda: Entrepreneur? You know, that's what's wrong with the french. They have no word for entrepreneur. So, what is this latest caper?",
        "Simon: Caper? No. Come on. No caper, no scam.",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing here in town?",
        "Simon: No, no.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well come on. Come on, let's say hello to the happy couple.",
        "Simon: Lucinda, no.",
        "Lucinda: Come on, come on.",
        "Lucinda: Hi!",
        "Mike: Hi, lucinda.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Nancy hughes informed me that you were off on a very luxurious honeymoon cruise. Getting into that -- your royalty money, right?",
        "Katie: Well, yeah, we tried, but -- how's lily?",
        "Lucinda: No change, but we're hoping for the best. I was reading to her at the hospital and I got the biggest surprise. Look who's --",
        "Mike: Something wrong with the bar?",
        "Lucinda: No, it's surprisingly empty. Lisa needs more customers.",
        "Mike: I think everyone's in the dining room.",
        "Katie: Actually, we have reservations, so --",
        "Lucinda: Go ahead. Go ahead.",
        "Katie: Good to see you.",
        "Mike: Bye.",
        "Lucinda: Have fun. Enjoy yourselves. I would've looked for you behind a potted palm, but there wasn't one big enough for your ego.",
        "Simon: Thank you for not telling them I was here.",
        "Lucinda: Well, it's a temporary reprieve, simon. So, tell me now. What's going on? Why are you hiding from katie and her new husband? Oh!",
        "Will: I don't believe this. So, gwen's name can be on all the accounts, we can share the money?",
        "Barbara: That's for you to decide, will.",
        "Jessica: I need you to sign here as well.",
        "Barbara: Would you like to explain to him how this works?",
        "Jessica: Of course. Of course you won't be getting the money all at once. The fund will be transferred in installments. That's for tax purposes, among other things. This is the first installment. After that, the money will be transferred in regular payments.",
        "Barbara: Do you think that's enough to start with?",
        "Will: Um, yeah. We can make that work.",
        "Barbara: And if you ever need more cash, there's a mechanism in place, right, jess?",
        "Jessica: That's correct. If you need more cash for any reason, just call me and I'll walk you through the procedure.",
        "Will: But this much is mine right now. It's not like you're holding onto it until I get my diploma?",
        "Barbara: Honey, you know that I'm hoping you're gonna finish high school, but that money is yours. You decide how to use it.",
        "Jessica: Will, I'm gonna need your signature as well.",
        "Will: Wait.",
        "Barbara: What, what?",
        "Will: I can't, this is just so weird. I don't even know what to ask, but there has to be a catch.",
        "Gwen: I believe her.",
        "Barbara: Why thank you. Listen to that smart girl you married, all right?",
        "Will: No strings, no surprises?",
        "Barbara: No strings. Oh, but there is something I want.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Barbara: Be happy. Both of you.",
        "Jade: Your grandmother called. She wanted to know if the sound system was okay.",
        "Casey: It seems to be.",
        "Jade: It's funny, in here, it's like the fire didn't even happen.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Jade: So, is your mom gonna arrest whoever did this?",
        "Casey: That's her job.",
        "Jade: Well, do they have any leads?",
        "Casey: I didn't ask.",
        "Jade: Well, they're gonna keep questioning people, right? I mean, talking to the witnesses. The police aren't giving up yet, are they?",
        "Casey: What's it to you?",
        "Jade: I know that this a sore subject, casey, but I think I know who set that fire.",

        "Casey: Come on, it'll be fun.",
        "Tom: Dusty, I will make this as easy on you as I can, but I need your testimony.",
        "Dusty: No. Emily goes loose.",
        "Cass: Your honor, may we approach again, please?",
        "Judge: Where are we?",
        "Cass: Without donovan, he's got nothing to corroborate any physical evidence he allegedly has. No case.",
        "Judge: Mr. Hughes, is that right?",
        "Paul: Dusty, look, I know you're trying to do what jennifer wanted. But emily could snap at any moment. I mean, look at what she did to you. Nobody saw that coming. She could snap again, and this time an innocent child would be hurt.",
        "Dusty: The same way you kept johnny away from your sister?",
        "Paul: Well, yeah, but -- I mean, I've learned -- I don't know, dusty, it's not the same to me somehow.",
        "Dusty: It's done.",
        "Judge: Gentlemen, make your motions.",
        "Cass: Your honor, given these latest developments, we respectfully request that the charges against ms. Stewart be dropped.",
        "Judge: Counselor?",
        "Tom: Without mr. Donovan's corroborating testimony, we would choose not to proceed at this time.",
        "Judge: The charges against emily stewart are hereby dismissed. The defendant is free to go.",
        "Paul: Wait! No, no, no, you can't just let her walk!",
        "Judge: Order!",
        "Paul: You have to lock her up!",
        "Judge: Bailiff?",
        "Paul: She shot me. And I want her arrested for that! She did, emily shot me!",
        "Cass: Oh, come on.",
        "Paul: What, you don't believe me? Look! Emily wanted me dead, and she damn near got her wish!",

        "Judge: Ms. Stewart shot you?",
        "Paul: Yes, emily shot me and everyone in this room knows that.",
        "Judge: And to think, my day started off on the boring side. Go on.",
        "Cass: Your honor, this is not the proper forum for this.",
        "Judge: This started out as a competency hearing. Shooting a man is relevant.",
        "Emily: No, but he's only trying to take my baby away.",
        "Cass: Emily --",
        "Emily: That's why he's bringing it up now!",
        "Cass: Sit down.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Cass: Your honor, my client is right. Mr. Ryan is trying to smear her.",
        "Paul: Smear her? She shot me! Look!",
        "Judge: We see the scar, mr. Ryan, enough. Counselor, is this true? And if so, why am I the last to know? Shouldn't this be in the defendant's file? Shouldn't there be charges?",
        "Tom: It's not quite that simple, your honor. At the time mr. Ryan was shot, he was a fugitive from the law. But he didn't report the shooting. He, in fact, staged his own death. By the time he was found, he was claiming the gunshot wound was self-inflicted. He never pressed charges.",
        "Paul: Exactly, I went easy on emily and look what happened. She kidnapped and nearly killed another man. Even if dusty wants her to go free, I don't! She could hurt somebody else. I want her arrested for shooting me!",
        "Judge: Fine, fine. Go to the police and swear out a complaint.",
        "Paul: No! I want it done now.",
        "Judge: That's not the procedure.",
        "Paul: Procedure? Look, I swear to you, she is a dangerous woman. She doesn't belong on the streets.",
        "Meg: Paul, it's okay.",
        "Judge: Counselor?",
        "Tom: Obviously we agree that ms. Stewart needed to be held. She had already confessed to her other crimes and was ready to plead guilty an hour ago.",
        "Cass: Because she felt trapped, your honor, and she was hoping to receive mental health care, not because she felt criminally culpable.",
        "Judge: Okay, enough. I get the drift. Everybody pipe down! Is there any supporting evidence for this claim that you can present? Anybody here who can testify for you?",
        "Paul: Absolutely. Meg snyder.",

        "Simon: Oh, great, yeah. I'm glad you find it funny.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's not that funny.",
        "Simon: No, I know, mike and a certain heiress definitely did not. And not once -- not once has he thanked me for saving katie's life.",
        "Lucinda: I find it very hard to believe that you could not differentiate between a luxury resort hotel and a barren wasteland.",
        "Simon: I know, it's strange. Like, in the last minute, my outback skills seemed to have failed me.",

Or if you'd like to take some of the cash and set up a separate account, that wouldn't be difficult either. Most importantly, this is the trust officer at the bank, he's really looking forward to meeting you. He is incredibly smart, great at investments and money management. His only job is to look out for your interests. So, before you buy that mansion on lake michigan or any other extravagant, give him a call.",
