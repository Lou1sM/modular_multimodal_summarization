        "Jack: Maybe in his own sneaky way, Brad hit on something. It's you and I -- we're good for each other, Katie. So, why not? What are we waiting for? We're not kids. We know what we want. Let's do it. Let's go for it.",
        "Katie: Jack, are you -- are you asking me to marry you?",
        "Jack: I guess I am. Marry me, Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're wrong, Jack. We are not over. Hi, Parker.",
        "Parker: You knew I was coming by, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, sure. And I've got cornbread in the kitchen to prove it. Why don't you go cut yourself a piece, huh?",
        "Parker: You okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Go ahead. Parker! Parker, could you come in here, please? I have to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, Mom, how are you?",
        "Gwen: Were you able to sleep at all?",
        "Barbara: No, no. I just rested. I kept hearing the phone ring.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, it's in the paper now, so people have been calling and I took a list of names, if you want to call them back.",
        "Barbara: You spoke to everybody?",
        "Will: Briefly. I didn't really know what to say.",
        "Barbara: What is there to say? I'll -- I'll call them in a couple of days. Thank you so much for being here. Both of you.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Will: I'll get it, Mom.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. I'll get it. I'll get it.",
        "Kim: Hi, Darling.",
        "Barbara: Hi. They're beautiful.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, I wish I could take credit for this, but we ran into the florist on the way up and we offered to deliver them. How are you doing?",
        "Barbara: I've had better days, that's for sure.",
        "Kim: \"Deepest sympathy. Lucinda.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know its fast, and we really haven't even talked about it, but I think -- I think you know that I love you. And I think you love me, too.",
        "Katie: I do. I do. I love you so much.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Okay. So, let's do this. What are we waiting for? Katie, will you marry me?",
        "Katie: Oh, Jack. I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Deepest sympathies!",
        "Will: Mom!",
        "Barbara: Get those things out of here!",
        "Kim: All right, all right. All right.",
        "Barbara: She wanted this to happen. She wanted this to happen.",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry. I never would have brought those flowers up here, if I knew they were from my mother. I'm so sorry. Let me clean it up.",
        "Kim: Come on, let it go. Come on. Lucinda is not the issue, Paul is.",
        "Barbara: Paul is gone.",
        "Kim: Well, but you need to mourn his passing.",
        "Barbara: I can't go through another --",
        "Kim: No, no, no. No, no, no. No, but you need to say good-bye. I mean, you can do something simple, something informal. We all need to say good-bye. We could do -- I don't know -- our own memorial service right here. Maybe today.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Kim: You think?",
        "Will: I think that's a good idea. Mom, what do you think?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we'll keep it real simple. Just us?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Gwen: How about we just go -- we'll go get changed, so you can think about it?",
        "Will: You'll be here?",
        "Kim: I will. Go right ahead.",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry. I did not know those flowers were from my mother.",
        "Will: It's okay. I think my mom blames Lucinda for Paul's death.",
        "Lily: That's why it was very insensitive of my mother to send flowers under the circumstances. I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: I should probably go get changed.",
        "Lily: Oh, before you go, I think you both should know that Jade has left town.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Lily: Well, she told me what happened in Branson, and she just wants to have a fresh start.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I can understand that.",
        "Lily: You know, Jade and I didn't get a chance to get very close, there were a lot of misunderstandings, a lot of missed chances, but I'm glad she worked things out with the two of you before she left.",
        "Gwen: I think she'll come back.",
        "Lily: I hope so.",
        "Will: We should get going.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Gwen: See you later.",
        "Lily: Bye.",
        "Kim: Honey, please go in and lie down.",
        "Barbara: I have to return these phone calls.",
        "Kim: Nobody expects to hear back from you today.",
        "Barbara: We're going to have a -- a service today? How can we possibly get anything pulled together for today?",
        "Kim: You know what? You just tell me who you think should be here, and I will make the calls, okay?",
        "Barbara: Just a short list. I guess you, and the kids and me.",
        "Kim: Unfortunately, Bob is at that out of town convention and he won't be able to make it. But, I think anybody who cared about Paul should be here.",
        "Barbara: It's just such a waste. Such a waste. And it's unfair. He lived life to its fullest. He was such a creative spirit. And we had our moments.",
        "Kim: I know. I know.",
        "Barbara: We were getting along so well lately and -- after Jennifer died, he was so giving. He was so good to me.",
        "Kim: I know, Sweetheart. This is your chance to give back. It's you chance to honor Paul and say good-bye. And I promise you, that I will make certain that everybody who loved him is here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. You just seemed cold. I'll let you rest.",
        "Meg: Wait, wait. I've been thinking.",
        "Craig: About Paul?",
        "Meg: Yes. And about you and me.",
        "Craig: Look, Meg, whatever you want to do, I'm going to leave that up to you.",
        "Meg: You need to know that I made a decision.",
        "Craig: No, I know. You want an annulment.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I don't understand. They're not just going to just declare someone dead. They haven't even found a body. It says so right here.",
        "Carly: I think they know from experience. The height of the cliff, and temperature of the water and so forth.",
        "Parker: So, they're guessing?",
        "Carly: Well, and the fact that no one has seen him.",
        "Parker: Well, that doesn't mean anything.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, you read about that. He was. But Jack got very lucky. We all got very lucky. I'm sorry, Parker. I know it's like one bad thing after another, but --",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: You are too grown up for me to pretend that life isn't like this sometimes.",
        "Parker: Sometimes?",
        "Carly: I know sometimes it feels like you can't catch your breath. And you know what I do at times like those? I think about you, and your brother and your sister, and I picture your faces and I think about how much I love you. And it gets me through.",
        "Parker: Everyone I have, it's like I can't hold on to them. If they don't die, they just leave.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and Dad, he went to D.C. for a conference, told me he'd be home for my birthday, he never came back.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Parker: No, you don't know what it's like. You have no idea what it feels like to lose someone forever.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Here. What is it exactly that you don't know? That you don't know? You don't know how you feel? You don't know if you want to get married again? Is it me?",
        "Katie: No, I know how I feel. And nothing would make me happier than to marry you. But, not because you're brother forced your hand. I mean, after all, he did start this whole thing with a fake jeweler and the fake phone call.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, all right. But, when you thought you were getting a ring from me, that made you happy. Yes?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yes, it made me happy. I will admit it. But, then I started thinking and I thought, what am I thinking? We've only been dating for a couple months.",
        "Jack: All right. You're right. I did this all wrong. But Katie, I love being with you. Everything about you. And I trust you. Everything you say, I believe that you really mean it. And I -- I want to marry you, not just because you're beautiful, and you're smart, and you're sexy and you're fun, but because I think we could build a life together. That would make both of us happy.",
        "Katie: I want that too. So much.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Katie: But we have a lot of stuff to deal with. I mean, I know you keep telling me that Carly is over you, but I don't buy it. Especially after this latest stunt, the jeweler? You can't tell me she wasn't part of that. I wouldn't believe it! And you're not saying anything.",
        "Jack: I've been thinking of a way to tell you this.",
        "Katie: Just say it.",
        "Jack: I don't know for sure if she was a part of that whole phony jeweler, but I do know that she's still interested in me.",
        "Katie: Because?",
        "Jack: She told me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: None of this means that I don't appreciate your support the last few days. It was very kind of you to let me stay here.",
        "Craig: Whatever your motives, Meg, I married you because I loved you. I don't say that to make you feel guilty. I -- I care about you, you needed a place to stay, I was glad to help.",
        "Meg: You helped. A lot, but we both know --",
        "Craig: Okay, you know what? I really don't need to hear it again, thank you.",
        "Meg: I care about you, Craig.",
        "Craig: No. No, you married me to right a wrong. I took Lucinda's company, you were going to give it back to her.",
        "Meg: And if I had to do it all over again, it would be very different. But, let's just agree that it was a mistake, and --",
        "Craig: Fine, I'm going to get my attorneys to start. Let me know.",
        "Lily: Meg?",
        "Meg: Hi. Hey, is everyone all right?",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't mean to alarm you. I tried your phone.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I turned it off what's happened?",
        "Lily: Well, Barbara's having sort of a memorial service at her suite. For Paul. Thought you should know.",
        "Meg: Well, I can't imagine she'd want me there.",
        "Lily: I didn't really buy her, so last minute. But, she did say that she wanted anybody there that cared about Paul. And nobody cared about him more than you.",
        "Meg: I loved him. With all my heart.",
        "Lily: Exactly. So, at least think about it.",
        "Craig: Meg, do you want your own attorney -- Lily.",
        "Lily: Craig. Actually, I was just leaving. And maybe you should go with me.",
        "Meg: Thank you, but I can't leave just yet.",
        "Craig: Meg has been staying here.",
        "Lily: Holden and I offered for her to stay at our house and she agreed initially, and then she got cold feet. Why was that?",
        "Meg: It was just for a day or two. I needed to be alone.",
        "Lily: We would have left you alone.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. And I was planning on visiting, but Craig and I, we --",
        "Lily: Craig and I? Why are you keeping up this pre-tense, Meg?",
        "Meg: I'm not. It's just that we have some things to settle.",
        "Craig: There are some legalities to be hammered out. Meg has asked me for an annulment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Remind me again. Why are we celebrating?",
        "Vienna: Because Katie and Jack are going to have a wonderful life, thanks to me.",
        "Henry: I'm afraid to ask.",
        "Vienna: Who would be very unhappy if Katie and Jack got married?",
        "Henry: That's a good question. Are they getting married?",
        "Vienna: What, you don't think they should?",
        "Henry: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess if they want to, sure.",
        "Vienna: Well, they belong together.",
        "Henry: I can think of two of three people who disagree with that.",
        "Vienna: Exactly. Brad and Carly.",
        "Henry: Right, right. Brad and Carly, Brad and Carly. So, you're telling me that Brad and Carly did something not very nice?",
        "Vienna: Horrible. Brad had someone calling at the studio pretending they were the jeweler. And he knew that if Katie overheard, she would think that Jack had bought her an engagement ring.",
        "Henry: And she would think this, why?",
        "Vienna: The point is, Katie got her hopes up. And then when Jack didn't ask her to marry him, you know, she was crushed. But I knew something was kosher.",
        "Henry: Not kosher.",
        "Vienna: Huh?",
        "Henry: Never mind.",
        "Vienna: So, I went to talk to my friend, the jeweler, and it turns out, everything was a trunk of lies.",
        "Henry: That clears it right up.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, it certainly does. And now, Jack and Katie, they can live happily ever after.",
        "Henry: I am sure they are very grateful. Um, I'm just curious though, since Katie is usually a self-starter. Why did you feel you had to interfere?",
        "Vienna: For you, Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Katie, I know that this proposal comes on the heels of a lot of family stuff with Brad, now Carly.",
        "Katie: I want to know what she said. And not the watered down version. I want to know exactly what she said.",
        "Jack: She said she loves me and she wants me back.",
        "Katie: Okay, I knew that.",
        "Jack: And she kissed me. Listen, I don't want to lie to you. For a moment there, I thought it felt like old times. But then I set her straight.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Jack: I told her I was in love with you.",
        "Katie: You told her that? You said those words?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, I realize it kind of comes a shock to you because somewhere along the way I forgot to tell you those words myself. But I -- I do. I love you, Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh, Jack. This is so backwards.",
        "Jack: I know. I know it is. I know. First I ask you to marry me, and then I tell you I love you. I'm out of practice.",
        "Katie: It's okay. I love you, too.",
        "Jack: So, I'm forgiven? [Laughter] For being backwards?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I guess it kind of works for us. So, let's go backwards again and you can tell me more about Carly. [Jack laughs] So, you told her you loved me, and --",
        "Jack: Yes, and that I wanted to be with you. And that she's just going to have to get used to it.",
        "Katie: And then what?",
        "Jack: And then I left. And I realized that this is not the best time to be talking about Carly, but I really don't think that we should be keeping anything from each other. I know that you don't want that.",
        "Katie: No, I don't want that. So, in the interest of full disclosure, I will tell you that it's not easy to hear that Carly put her cards on the table. I guess I'm sure there was a part of you that loved to hear that she wants you back.",
        "Jack: My ego had a moment, yes. But luckily -- luckily, I've got a very good memory. I don't want to live like that anymore.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Katie: It could be about the kids.",
        "Jack: Yes, it could be. What's up?",
        "Carly: Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. It's about Parker. And I know that we talked about telling him about Paul together, but it's in the paper.",
        "Jack: So, he knows?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: How's he doing?",
        "Carly: Not good. He's back to how I left and how he can't trust anybody and then he ran out.",
        "Jack: He left the house?",
        "Carly: No. No, not yet. He just went to his room. Could you come by and talk to him, Jack? I don't want him running off.",
        "Jack: I'll be right over. Parker just found out about Paul. I really got to get over there. He's a mess.",
        "Katie: To Carly's?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Look, I can't promise that anything's going to be different. Katie, I have three kids with a woman who's not exactly honest. She's going to be a part of our lives. That is, if you'll say you'll marry me. Katie, I love you, and I want you to be my wife. [Jack laughs] But you gotta know what comes with the package, okay? Parker, he still has a lot of problems. And J.J. and Sage, they need a lot of attention.",
        "Katie: I know. I know that. I love your kids.",
        "Jack: They're crazy about you. But, you have to know that there will be moments, like this. Carly's going to call and I'm going to have to go over there.",
        "Katie: It's okay. You know I understand that. I want you to go.",
        "Jack: So, you do? You do understand?",
        "Katie: Jack, you just told me about Carly saying she wants you back and kissing you. Because you know that I don't want you holding anything back from me. And I love that you know that. And I love that you and I are so honest with each other, no matter how hard it is. I think that came out of being friends first, because we were never trying to put that perfect person forward.",
        "Jack: Well, half that time we were talking about how awful we felt.",
        "Katie: Exactly. So, I trust that in you. When you tell me how you feel, it's exactly how you feel. So, if you tell me that Carly kissing you just convinced you that I'm right, then I believe you.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Katie: So -- you really want to propose, I think you know the answer.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know, I'm going to do this right.",
        "Katie: Yeah?",
        "Jack: Yes. I'm going to ask you again, officially. I'm going to make this something special. Something that we both -- we both remember, with the ring, and the music and the whole nine yards. So, the next time, when you say yes -- if you say yes --",
        "Katie: Hey, just don't ask me to marry you, unless you want to get stuck. Don't say you weren't warned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: So, you made sure Jack and Katie would get married for me?",
        "Vienna: Because I know how much you love her. She's your best friend. And now that you're happy, I know that you want her to be happy, too.",
        "Henry: Well, you're right, I do.",
        "Vienna: And it didn't hurt that Brad got furious.",
        "Henry: That's my girl.",
        "Vienna: And that tacky Carly, she doesn't deserve Jack. And now she can't have him.",
        "Henry: Well, there'll be no dancing in Milltown tonight.",
        "Vienna: Are you proud of me?",
        "Henry: Yes. I'm very proud of you. But, tell me -- altruist that you are, is there some other reason that you want Katie to be happy? You don't have to worry, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I'm not worried. I mean, my mother was right in a lot of things -- never to trust a pretty woman.",
        "Henry: Is this about your mother?",
        "Vienna: My mama is a beautiful woman, but unfortunately, one beautiful woman wasn't enough for my father. So, she always warned me never to have a pretty best friend. She'll just steal your man.",
        "Henry: You're not going to lose me.",
        "Vienna: I know.",
        "Henry: You do?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, because you make me happy, and I make you happy. So, why would you leave me? As fun as you are, just sometimes, I get a little lonely and I just want to talk to a girl and in the past I've had a problem trusting people. And now, things have changed with Katie and I really like her. Is that okay?",
        "Henry: Of course it is.",
        "Vienna: So, she can be my best friend, too?",
        "Henry: I insist on it. And you're right. You're right, you do make me happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: An annulment? Good.",
        "Meg: Let's not turn this into a confrontation.",
        "Craig: It's all right Lily is angry with me.",
        "Lily: With very good reason.",
        "Craig: You know what? We all have our reasons. Good and bad.",
        "Lily: I'm not going to debate this with you. I need to get back to Barbara's. Please, please consider coming by. Craig.",
        "Craig: Lily. Nobody gives anger better than Lily, of course, except her mother. Now Sierra was never like that. But, then again, she had a sense of humor.",
        "Meg: Well, that must be why she married you.",
        "Craig: Yes, must be. Lawyers are hard at work. What did Lily want?",
        "Meg: I turned my phone off.",
        "Craig: Seemed like she wanted you to go somewhere with her.",
        "Meg: Barbara's having a memorial for Paul.",
        "Craig: Of course she is.",
        "Meg: Today.",
        "Craig: And you want to go?",
        "Meg: Does it matter what I want?",
        "Craig: Of course it matters. You loved him. So go.",
        "Meg: Barbara doesn't want me there.",
        "Craig: So, what?",
        "Meg: So, I don't want to make things worse.",
        "Craig: How can you make things worse, Meg? The man is dead. It doesn't get worse than that.",
        "Meg: If it weren't in her home --",
        "Craig: Oh, you know what? Why are you even so worried about what other people think?",
        "Meg: You know, I'm not like you, Craig! I don't do whatever I want and to hell with everybody else!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: How you doing?",
        "Will: I'm okay. I don't know. I guess I thought when I hit the shower, I'd cry, but nothing. I guess I just feel kind of numb. Like I'm in shock. It hasn't really hit me yet.",
        "Gwen: It's going to take some time.",
        "Will: You know he was the only one until you that never really cared what people thought about me.",
        "Gwen: Well, he loved you.",
        "Will: I love him. It's kind of weird. It's like everybody's disappearing, you know? Casey's in prison.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Now Jade's left town. I don't know. I don't know. I just wish --",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: No, it's pointless. It's life. You know, you don't get do-overs.",
        "Will: And if you did?",
        "Gwen: I wish that everyone could be happy.",
        "Will: You okay?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm fine. I just think I've been fighting something since I've got back from Branson. Something I ate, or I didn't eat. It's just probably stress or something. What are you doing?",
        "Will: Calling my mom. We're staying home. I don't want you getting any sicker.",

        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Thanks for coming. Kim just called, and she said that Barbara's having sort of a impromptu memorial service for Paul at the Lakeview. Before you say anything, Jack, I know that we were supposed to talk to Parker together about what happened. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: No, I understand. Once it hits the papers.",
        "Carly: Yeah, and you know how he's always online. That's the only reason that I called you here. I mean, I heard what you said about you and Katie. Okay?",
        "Jack: Well, I hope so. Carly, I'm not out to hurt you. But, if you or Brad continue to interfere --",
        "Carly: No, I'm not -- I'm not interfering. I just need some help with Parker, okay? This brought up a lot of feelings for him, and it's the last thing he needs.",
        "Jack: Well, at least he didn't run away. That means he feels safe here with you.",
        "Carly: Well, clearly not safe enough to talk to me. He brought up how I left, and how he doesn't know if I'll do it again. So, I said the only thing that I can say, that I made a mistake. That people make mistakes and they learn from them.",
        "Jack: I'll talk to him. What time's the memorial?",
        "Carly: She said to come over. So, I thought I'd take him, if he wants to go. Unless you think that it's too much for him.",
        "Jack: Let's see what Parker thinks.",
        "Carly: I don't care what you say, Jack. I'm not giving up on us.",

        "Gwen: Hey, don't do that. We need to go.",
        "Will: Not if you're sick.",

        "Will: I've never -- and I mean, never -- heard you complain about being ill before.",
        "Gwen: I wasn't complaining.",
        "Will: We're staying home.",
        "Gwen: Your mom needs us to be there.",
        "Will: Well, she's going to have to understand.",
        "Gwen: You need to be there.",
        "Will: I can deal with saying good-bye to Paul in my own way. Okay?",
        "Gwen: Fine. Then I need to be there, okay? You're mom's right. We're the only family we've got and we need to stick together.",
        "Will: Fine, but if you start to feel any worse then you're going to tell me.",
        "Gwen: I swear. I'll tell you. You can take me to the ER if you want. Look, you're already dressed, your mom is waiting for us, we'll just go over there for like an hour, maybe two. We'll come back here, we'll unplug the phones. We need to do this. And I know it's not easy for you. I know you're not looking forward to it.",

        "Meg: I don't have a right to intrude on Barbara's grief. And she blames me, and I don't want to cause a scene.",
        "Craig: It'll only be a scene if Barbara wants a scene. And okay, yeah, this is at her house, but that's her choosing. She can just as easily have rented a ballroom downstairs if she didn't want to travel.",
        "Meg: Now I know why Lily doesn't debate you.",
        "Craig: Because I am right.",
        "Meg: Okay, fine. Fine, okay? You are right! But Barbara will still be upset.",
        "Craig: So, what. So, Barbara's going to be upset anyway. What are you going to do? Make her a little bit more upset. Who would care?",
        "Meg: I care.",
        "Craig: Fine. Then, just stay home and be miserable.",
        "Meg: You're no help.",
        "Craig: Oh, you know what? Actually, I am a lot of help. I am laying out your options. You can either go, knowing it is going to be gruesome, but at least you would've been there. Or you can stay here and feel terrible about what you're missing.",
        "Meg: It's not about what I'm missing.",
        "Craig: It's about saying good-bye.",

        "Henry: It is soon. I -- for someone who's like completely allergic to this entire thing.",
        "Katie: Well, I love the idea, and so does Jack. And we're going to have a nice night where he proposes formally and gives me the ring.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that's so romantic.",

        "Vienna: I was happy to do it. Did Brad tell you anything more?",
        "Katie: No, not really. Although he does seem to think the fact that he has some weird little crush on me justifies him sabotaging his brother.",
        "Vienna: Right. So, did he mention Carly?",
        "Katie: Oh, no. He wasn't going to admit that she was part of it.",
        "Vienna: So, what do you think?",
        "Katie: I think she knew about it, at the very least. I'm sure she was cheering him on.",

        "Vienna: Well, then you have to stomp his ex-wife before she stomps you.",
        "Katie: But she's the mother of Jack's kids. I can't take Carly out. It'll make his kids miserable. I just have to trust the fact that he loves me. And he does.",
        "Vienna: Wow, you're a wonder woman.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not. I just trust him. We talk about everything, and when he tells me how he feels, I believe him. I'm not afraid of Carly. I mean, sure, they had chemistry. They still do. But, he doesn't trust her. Even when I brought the fact up that she probably had something to do with the jewelry thing, he didn't defend her. And that's a big step. So, she can plot and scheme all she wants, but things are not going to change. Jacks wants to marry me and Carly's just going to have to get used to it.",
