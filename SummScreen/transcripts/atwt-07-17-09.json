        "Katie: You promised you would stop being Geneva Swift once Vienna was off \"Oakdale Now.\" Well, she's off.",
        "Henry: I know. What can I say? Things have changed.",
        "Katie: The only thing that's changed is that you got what you wanted. It's time to say goodbye to your fabulous creation, Henry. Time for Geneva to give her final curtain call in the sky.",
        "Henry: You're talking about murder, Katie.",
        "Katie: You can't murder someone who doesn't exist! Why have you gotten so pathologically attached to this woman? Oh, good grief, you've got me acting like she's a real person, too!",
        "Henry: Yeah, because she is! To all the wonderful people out there in TV land, Geneva Swift is real!",
        "Katie: She's a wig and a padded bra!",
        "Henry: Now, you could say that about a lot of women on TV, Katie. Anyway, she's full of a lot of life, and she's got a lot of life ahead of her -- a rich, famous, adored, wonderful life.",
        "Katie: Henry!",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Stardom is calling Geneva Swift, Bubbles, and who am I to stand in her way?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Dusty: So, how you gonna get me out of here?",
        "Bonnie: You mean, getting you out of the mess that you stupidly confessed your way into? I don't know. That depends on Paul Ryan.",
        "Dusty: He's not gonna admit what he did.",
        "Bonnie: Well, apparently, he's smarter than you are. Here's the deal, Dusty. You shut up, and I will make Paul out to be the bad guy. That is the only way that you are gonna get out of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You were in an explosion. You just came out of the surgery. So don't -- don't try to talk if you can't.",
        "Paul: I was in an explosion?",
        "Barbara: You don't remember?",
        "Paul: Well, why don't you tell me who you are, and then we'll take it from there?",
        "Barbara: I'm your mother, Paul.",
        "Paul: Paul? I'm -- I'm Paul?",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God, you don't even -- you are Paul Ryan. And I'm your mother. Does that mean anything to you?",
        "Paul: You're my mom?",
        "Barbara: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, you seem like a nice lady, so I'll take your word for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Are you all right?",
        "Meg: While I was upstairs, I, uh, called the hospital.",
        "Damian: How's Paul?",
        "Meg: He regained consciousness a few minutes ago. Barbara's in talking to him right now.",
        "Damian: Do you want to go see him yourself?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: No. No, that's the last thing I want to do. The only reason I called is so I can make sure he's okay so I can stop worrying.",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "Damian: That might be easier said than done.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, you know, I really need to distance myself from Paul and from Dusty, for that matter. You know, any of us could've been killed in that explosion. Eliza could've lost both her parents!",
        "Damian: Thank God she didn't.",
        "Meg: You know, you, Dusty, Paul -- everything's become so complicated. I need to simplify my life. I can't subject my daughter to that kind of risk again.",
        "Damian: I think that's wise. Please, this distance you're talking about -- I hope that doesn't apply to me, because distance from you is the last thing I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Kim is thinking about hiring Geneva Swift full time to be our co-host. I mean, can --can you believe that one!",
        "Katie: Wow! No, no, I can't believe it.",
        "Brad: I mean, that show is gonna become all about her and her hang-ups!",
        "Katie: Well, let's not get carried away. Maybe she won't want to be on the show on a permanent basis.",
        "Brad: Oh, you don't know this woman the way I do. Okay? You give her an inch, she'll take our show.",
        "Katie: Well, if she's that crazed with power, then maybe Kim won't be able to meet her demands.",
        "Brad: No, Kim -- Kim is dead set on hiring her. We got to do something, man. I thought the sexual-harassment suit -- I thought that would be enough, but there's got to be -- I mean, maybe there's another way to get rid of her.",
        "Katie: Like what?",
        "Brad: Let's start with one simple question. What do we really know about Geneva Swift?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: This should put a smile back on that irresistible face.",
        "Vienna: Yes, they're beautiful.",
        "Henry: Yes, they are beautiful. What else do you need? Do you need something bigger, a different color, different color? Just -- you just have to ask.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I don't know what I want. I've never been fired before. I feel like I'm never gonna be happy again.",
        "Henry: Yes, you will be. I should know. I've been fired many, many times.",
        "Vienna: Oh, what did you feel like? Tearing out the hair of the woman responsible?",
        "Henry: Kim Hughes?",
        "Vienna: No, of course not! Geneva Swift!",
        "Henry: Oh, look. Look at it this way. \"Oakdale Now\" just wasn't meant for you.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but I love that show!",
        "Henry: Yeah, you love it so much, your back is having spasms. Your health is far more important than some silly TV program.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I suppose you're right.",
        "Henry: Of course I'm right. And you'll see. In a little while, you'll be watching \"Oakdale Now,\" and Brad and Katie will be chatting there with Geneva, and it'll roll right over you.",
        "Vienna: Hang on a minute. What do you mean? Well, she -- she's not gonna be on the show once Katie gets back, right?",
        "Henry: I'm afraid she is.",
        "Vienna: Who told you that?",
        "Henry: Katie.",
        "Vienna: She told you that they they're replacing me with that -- that -- that blob?",
        "Henry: Well, now, that's -- that's a little harsh, don't you think?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no! That woman has no taste, and she had certainly no talent!",
        "Henry: Actually, she's pretty funny and she's pretty smart.",
        "Vienna: No, she is pushy, she's hideous, and she's impossible! Hey, hang on a minute! Why are you defending her?",
        "Henry: I'm not, I'm not. She's horrible.",
        "Vienna: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Forget everything that I said. Here, have some chocolate.",
        "Vienna: No, I don't want any chocolate.",
        "Henry: Well, there's got to be something that will make you feel better.",
        "Vienna: Yes. Killing Geneva Swift.",
        "Henry: Yeah, besides that.",
        "Vienna: Well --",
        "Henry: Oh. Oh! I've missed that smile.",
        "Vienna: We could, uh -- we could make love.",
        "Henry: Yes, we could. I've missed that, too. What -- what about your back?",
        "Vienna: Oh, d-don't think about that. We'll just have to take it easy for a little while, and we'll be back to normal speed in no time.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: Let me go get ready.",
        "Henry: Hmm, me too.",
        "[Vienna chuckles]",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "[Henry clicks tongue]",
        "[Geneva's voice]",
        "Henry: Hey, Kim, how are ya?",
        "Kim: Just great, and I have wonderful news. We've set up the press conference to announce that you're going to be a permanent part of \"Oakdale Now.\"",
        "Henry: Well, hey, that sounds lovely. I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Kim: No, no, no, no. I need you at the -- at the Lakeview now.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Vienna: Mmm! Come get me, Tiger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Do you remember how you ended up here?",
        "Paul: The nice lady said I was in an explosion.",
        "Barbara: He doesn't know I'm his mother.",
        "Paul: I'm really sorry. I don't mean to upset anybody.",
        "Barbara: You can see why I called you, Bob.",
        "Bob: Barbara, we'll talk outside.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Paul: Um, excuse me. Doctor, she seems a little out of sorts. Maybe you could give her a little something for her nerves.",
        "Bob: I'll see what I can do.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Barbara: What is wrong with him?",
        "Bob: Well, we won't have any answers until we run some tests.",
        "Barbara: Do you think it -- it's the microchip?",
        "Bob: It's possible. It's not unusual for a patient to be disoriented after brain surgery.",
        "Barbara: He looked at me straight in my eye and didn't know who I was, Bob.",
        "Bob: Barbara, this could be temporary. Sometimes these things heal themselves.",
        "Barbara: What can I do? Can I do something to help?",
        "Bob: Well, you can be there for him. And if he's surrounded with people that he loves, it could trigger his memory.",
        "Barbara: Of course, of course. I should've thought of that myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm not blaming you, Damian. You tried to stop Dusty from planting that bomb.",
        "Damian: So you're not gonna stop seeing me?",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Not unless you give me a reason to.",
        "[Damian sighs]",
        "Damian: You take very good care of Eliza. I just hope that, one day soon, that you will realize that you deserve someone to take care of you, too.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: I -- I should probably see who that is. Barbara? Is anything the matter?",
        "Barbara: Meg -- Meg, you need to come to the hospital immediately. Paul needs you.",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: No, he needs good doctors to help him get well. And he has that at Memorial.",
        "Barbara: He's lost his memory.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Barbara: He didn't -- he didn't know -- he didn't know that I'm his mother.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Look, I -- I'm sure Bob told you that there's a certain amount of confusion after brain surgery.",
        "Barbara: And Bob also said that he needs people around him to help him reconnect with his world -- people who love him, and that means you.",
        "Meg: I don't know if that's true.",
        "Barbara: I do. You can get through to him like no one else can. Now, I need you here. Please. And he does, too.",
        "Meg: I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Damian: Did something happen to Paul?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: His mother says that he lost his memory. He didn't even know who she was.",
        "Damian: That's awful.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it is -- if it's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Paul was engaging in industrial espionage.",
        "Dusty: What? He was trying to get Meg back.",
        "Bonnie: No, work with me, here, Dusty. You were trying to protect your business by putting the fear of God into a man who was trying to destroy it. I mean, you didn't have the best judgment, but you never intended to cause bodily harm.",
        "Dusty: You think a jury's gonna buy that?",
        "Bonnie: Well, we have proof of what Paul did. All we need now is some sort of testimony to say you never intended to detonate the bomb.",
        "Dusty: Then we need Damian after all. He's not gonna back me up.",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. We'll give him one more chance. Maybe he'll have a change of heart. But luckily, our case doesn't depend on him. It depends on my ability to paint Paul Ryan as the spawn of Satan. It's our only hope. Come on, let's get you bailed out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: So, what are you going to do?",
        "Meg: I have no choice. I have to go to the hospital.",
        "Damian: Because if you don't, then it turns out there's something really wrong with Paul, then you're never gonna forgive yourself.",
        "Meg: Stop reading my mind, okay?",
        "Damian: Come on, I'll drive you.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. I have to do this myself.",
        "Damian: There's got to be something I can do for you.",
        "Meg: There is. You can make peace with Dusty.",
        "Damian: Meg, I'd do anything for you --",
        "Meg: Look, I can't take wondering what terrible thing is gonna happen next. And if what you want is some kind of future for us, then you have to put an end to this war between you and Dusty.",
        "Damian: What about Paul?",
        "Meg: I'll take care of Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What are you doing?",
        "Brad: Finding out who Geneva Swift -- if that's her name -- really is. I don't believe it.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: She's got fan sites. I mean, the woman's been on TV for like, what, two minutes. She's already got -- four fan sites.",
        "Katie: Well, how many do you have?",
        "Brad: That's not the point.",
        "Katie: Did you find out anything else?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Katie: Good, that settles it.",
        "Brad: No, no, it doesn't. What does it tell you that she doesn't exist on the internet except for four stupid fan sites?",
        "Katie: That we should drop it.",
        "Brad: No. Listen to me, listen to me. The woman -- okay, she's -- you don't understand, okay? She is a threat to our careers, to our baby's future. Okay, do you really want Brad Jr. sweeping floors in order to pay for college?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brad: Oh, here. Can you get that?",
        "Katie: Hi, Kim. Hold on, let me get Brad for you. Oh. Are you sure? She did? Well, yes, of course you're sure. A press conference? Okay. Yeah, I'll tell him. Thank you.",
        "Brad: A press conference for what?",
        "Katie: Geneva Swift has agreed to permanently co-host \"Oakdale Now.\"",
        "Brad: I told you -- I told you she would jump at the chance.",
        "Katie: I can't believe she actually went through with it.",
        "[Brad sighs]",
        "Brad: Okay, when is the press conference?",
        "Katie: At the Lakeview in a few minutes.",
        "Brad: Okay, I got to be there. I mean, I'm sorry. I really hate to leave you like this.",
        "Katie: Well, you may not have to. Kim said if I'm up to it, she wants all three of us there to welcome Geneva to the team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I can't do this, I'm sorry.",
        "Vienna: What are we doing? Are we playing the seminary student and the stripper?",
        "Henry: No, no, I can't do that. I mean, I'm worried about you, about your back. I'm afraid I might hurt you.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. I'll be fine. We just, uh, we just have to be a little more conventional for awhile.",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay. If I'm gonna be conventional, then I'm really gonna need a lot of champagne.",
        "Vienna: No. Why not? Why not? Is it because I got fired and I'm not desirable anymore?",
        "Henry: What? Sweetie, no! No, that's not it. No. It's just, um, well, I, uh -- you know what? I'm upset about you being fired. I'm upset about it, and I just need to get some air and sort of work through these feelings, okay?",
        "Vienna: No, but we can work through this together, like we always do. I need you here, Henry.",
        "Henry: I know, but I'm gonna be good for either one of us right now. And I swear, I'll be back and rearing to go, okay?",
        "Vienna: What's in the bag?",
        "Henry: Um, laundry. I've got to drop off some laundry on the way, okay?",
        "Vienna: Okay. Please come back soon.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.",
        "[Exhales deeply]",
        "Henry: Now where the hell am I gonna put on my dress?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How is Paul?",
        "Bob: His condition is stable, his vitals good, and he's responds completely to stimuli.",
        "Barbara: But his responses make no sense.",
        "Meg: Maybe because he doesn't want them to. Barbara, I told you I never wanted to see Paul again. If it turns out to be one of his little acts --",
        "Barbara: Please, just go and see for yourself, okay?",
        "Meg: Come here, Sweetie.",
        "Barbara: Come on, Sweetheart. I know, I know.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: Your mother says that you don't know who you are. Does that mean you don't know who I am either?",
        "Paul: No. But -- I wish I did.",
        "Meg: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Paul: I don't mean to be rude. I'm sorry. And don't take this the wrong way, but you are one incredibly sexy woman. Are we involved? Because that would -- that would -- wow, that would make my day.",
        "Meg: Do you really think you can get away with this, that this little act of yours is gonna make me forget everything that you've done?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Here's what I do know -- I woke up in this hospital bed a few minutes ago, and I don't know how I got here. And this is what I've figured out so far -- I have a very emotional mother and a super hot girlfriend who apparently is a little angry at me. Other than that, I'm pretty much a blank.",
        "Meg: Oh. Well, you're taking this very calmly.",
        "Paul: That's bad?",
        "Meg: Well, most people, when they lose their identity, they tend to get a little bit more upset than this.",
        "Paul: I don't remember what most people would do, so I'll just have to let you be the judge of that.",
        "Meg: Okay, so, so, you're telling me that you don't feel the slightest bit of frustration that you've lost your memory?",
        "Paul: Well, if I don't know what I lost, why would I miss it? You're beautiful. Really. Whatever memories I have of you, I'd really like them back.",
        "Meg: Really? Do you want to know about us?",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Meg: Let's start here. I am not your girlfriend.",
        "Paul: Seriously? I want you to be my girlfriend.",
        "Meg: We used to be married.",
        "Paul: Oh. \"Used to be.\"",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's right. Do you really want to know more about our relationship?",
        "Paul: Only if you want to tell me.",
        "Meg: We used to be happy. Really happy.",
        "Paul: Well, that's great.",
        "Meg: Until you trashed it. You destroyed it with your anger and your jealousy.",
        "Paul: Jealousy? Did I have a reason to be jealous?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: So I'm an idiot?",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "Paul: Oh, no!",
        "Meg: I swear to you, if this is another one of your little lies --",
        "Paul: No. How can I be lie when I don't even remember what it is I'm lying about?",
        "Meg: I promise you, I will make sure that you don't spend any time with Eliza ever again.",
        "Paul: Okay, if you think that's the right thing to do. Who's Eliza?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: The person who I'm not supposed to spend time with. You don't have to tell me, but I really -- I'm curious.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop it, Paul. Playing games with me is one thing, but don't you dare deny the existence of our daughter!",
        "Paul: We have a daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Listen, I'm gonna go. I'll round up the reporters.",
        "Brad: Okay, Kim, Kim, can you just rethink this, please?",
        "Kim: Oh, listen, I'm gonna hire Geneva.",
        "Brad: She is a sexual predator.",
        "Kim: Listen to me. I want you to stop using that term. You have made your complaint. We have addressed it. Now, what you have to do is focus on getting ready for this press conference, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey, hey.",
        "Clerk: Anything I can do for you, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I need another room, just for a few hours.",
        "Clerk: I presume you don't want Ms. Hyatt to know about this.",
        "Henry: Get your mind out of the gutter. But, no, you don't have to bother her about it, no.",
        "Clerk: Room 415 isn't due in till later tonight.",
        "Henry: Much obliged.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Vienna: Darling, did you forget your key? Oh.",
        "Brad: Sorry. Obviously you were expecting Henry.",
        "Vienna: Yep, I was. What are you doing here?",
        "Brad: I just wanted to see if you were okay after, you know, being fired. But it seems like you and Henry are making the most of your unemployment.",
