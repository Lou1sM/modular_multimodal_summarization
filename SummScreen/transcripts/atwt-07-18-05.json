        "Jack: Artie, you're sure Carly didn't come by with the deposit?",
        "Bartender: I'm sure.",
        "Jack: No, she knew that the party was tonight, though, buddy. I gave her the money.",
        "Bartender: Maybe she went shopping instead?",
        "Jack: I know she was going shopping, but she wouldn't -- she wouldn't flake on something like this. Maybe she gave it to somebody else. Another bartender, maybe?",
        "Bartender: I'm the only who's been here all afternoon. Now look, the place is still available, if you want to book it.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Sounds good, yes. Where the hell are you, Carly?",

        "Iris: You're gonna make my day?",
        "Henry: Yes, ma'am, you are the winner of the consumers' warehouse sweepstakes.",
        "Iris: I didn't enter any contest.",
        "Henry: You didn't have to. There's no entry required. Let's get this party started!",
        "Iris: Wait.",
        "Henry: There's no need to wait! The check is right here.",
        "Iris: The check?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Iris: I still don't understand how I'm in this contest.",
        "Henry: Two words, Ms. Dubrowski -- bulk buying.",
        "Iris: What?",
        "Henry: Yeah, we're all about bulk buying at consumers' warehouse. You're automatically entered every time you shop.",
        "Iris: Yeah, but I don't buy in bulk.",
        "Henry: Of course you do, that's the American way.",
        "Iris: No, I don't.",
        "Henry: You only buy one roll of paper towels? You never get the 12-pack? What about toilet paper? Cocktail onions? Instant noods?",
        "[Can rustling]",
        "Iris: Somebody's out there.",
        "Henry: You know, Ms. Dubrowski, hold on just a second. We've only got a little bit of time to take care of this paperwork.",
        "Iris: Wait, I told you. Somebody is out here. Now, you need to leave now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What do you mean, you know what I did?",
        "Celia: You pretended to be the father of Gwen's baby when it was really Casey.",
        "Will: Who told you that?",
        "Celia: You did.",
        "Will: What?",

        "Celia: I need to know why.",
        "Will: Why what?",
        "Celia: Why you did it. Why did you go to so much trouble? You let Casey off the hook and took on all this stuff that wasn't yours to handle. Why?",

        "Rosanna: Hello, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry to drop by unannounced. The adoption papers didn't have your phone number on them, just your address.",
        "Gwen: Come in.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. How are you feeling?",
        "Gwen: Different. I don't know, before, I'd -- it was, like, full. Now it's --",

        "Gwen: Whatever.",
        "Rosanna: I saw the baby.",

        "Gwen: Good.",
        "Rosanna: Did you see him?",
        "Gwen: The doctor said I could. Or couldn't. I don't know, I figured it'd make it way too real.",
        "Rosanna: Gwen, if you think that just looking at this little boy is gonna make you change your mind, then you're not ready to let him go. My husband and I need you to be absolutely sure about this. So, please --",
        "Gwen: Hey. I'll be sure.",
        "Rosanna: You have doubts?",
        "Gwen: Not about you. But your husband is a different story.",

        "Jennifer: That is not my baby.",

        "Rosanna: My husband is very excited about this baby.",
        "Gwen: That's what he said, not how he looked.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's just Craig. He holds back. That's what he's like when he cares about something. And he does care about this baby just as much as I do.",
        "Gwen: Don't worry. You'll get the baby, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Look, if you have any doubts, I need to know them now.",
        "Gwen: Look, even if your husband isn't that into it, the baby has you, and you'll be great. That's more than most kids have. We're on.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Can I get you something to eat? You look a little pale.",
        "Gwen: I ate something a little while ago. I'm good.",
        "Rosanna: Are you sure? Maybe I can get you something for later?",
        "Gwen: I can take care of that.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't have your bank account information so, this is for you. Its cash --",
        "Gwen: This is way too much.",
        "Rosanna: No, that's not possible. What you've given me, no amount of money could possibly express. So, please let me make some part of your life a little easier.",
        "Gwen: Just give the kid a good home. That's all I want.",
        "Rosanna: If there's ever anything that you need --",
        "Gwen: Thanks, but when it's settled, I don't think we should have contact. It's better for the kid, right? I think that his life with you should be it.",

        "Rosanna: Well, no, I'm already back.",
        "Margo: You gotta get over to the hospital right away. Jennifer's baby died.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no. Does Craig know?",
        "Margo: Yeah, he does. He's on his way to the hospital now. And I don't know what he's gonna do when he gets there.",

        "Katie: Mike, I'm sorry to bother you, but it's Craig.",
        "Mike: What about him?",
        "Katie: I told him about the baby, and he got it in his head that he needed to be here. I'm so sorry, I tried.",

        "Dusty: Did I see what?",
        "Jennifer: That's not my baby.",
        "Dusty: Why are you saying that, Jen? Why are you saying this?",
        "Jennifer: Because it can't be! You -- you delivered him. You -- you held him. That baby in there -- that's not him. That's not, I know it. There's been a mistake.",
        "Dusty: You need to rest. Do you hear me? You gotta rest now.",
        "Jennifer: But then you'll straighten it out, right?",
        "Dusty: I will.",

        "Celia: So you didn't do it for Gwen?",
        "Will: So, how'd you leave it with Casey?",
        "Celia: I left it.",
        "Will: As in?",
        "Celia: We're broken up. What else? I couldn't stay with him.",
        "Will: You're sure?",
        "Celia: Of course I am.",

        "Celia: Yeah, right.",
        "Will: Gwen never told, I never told.",
        "Celia: He knew he slept with her. Baby or no baby. He should have told me that.",
        "Will: He just didn't wanna lose you.",
        "Celia: So he lied about who he was? What he'd done? Do you remember how mean he was to Gwen?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Celia: Who does that?",
        "Will: A guy who's scared and wants it all to go away.",
        "Celia: Don't defend him.",
        "Will: I'm not. I just get it. He cares about you a lot. And when you care about someone, you want them to see your best. Not the ugly parts.",
        "Celia: Most people don't have ugly parts like that.",
        "Will: But everybody keeps things to themselves. You never kept a secret from Casey? Me, too.",
        "Celia: I was an idiot.",
        "Will: How, about what?",
        "Celia: Me and my commitment rings. Casey played me. I'm such a loser.",
        "Will: No, you're not.",

        "Henry: Oh, that's mine. I must've dropped it.",
        "Iris: Aren't you going to answer it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. Consumers' warehouse sweepstakes, mobile. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's right here. Iris Dubrowski. Yeah, yeah. I think she's exactly what you're looking for. Yeah, very photogenic. What, are you kidding me? Listen, she has got two cases of canned tuna in the kitchen, she's got a 24-pack of saltines, and get this al, get this -- she's got ten quarts of sweet gherkins, still shrink-wrapped. How about that for some lunch, huh? [Henry laughs] Yeah, yeah, we just gotta wrap up some paperwork. No problem. Okay. All right. Buh-bye. That was the home office, now. I covered for you.",
        "Iris: Yeah, what was that about?",
        "Henry: Listen, listen, if they found out that you don't bulk buy, they're gonna take that six-figure check right out from underneath you.",
        "Iris: Six figures?",
        "Henry: That's what I said. So sweetheart, let's just take care of this paperwork. We're gonna make you rich, huh?",
        "Iris: Don't you want a picture, me with these balloons?",
        "Henry: I would love one, but, you know, after the paperwork, okay? Just take a second. There you go. Just hold on to those. All right, okay. How long have you lived in Oakdale?",
        "Iris: 35 years.",
        "Henry: Okay, 35. At your current residence?",
        "Iris: Why do you need to know about my house?",
        "Henry: I just -- we just need to establish, you know, legal residency, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what, it's not even that important. Let's just move on down here. Employment, employment. You're not gonna need to work once you have all this money, believe me.",
        "Iris: It's that much?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Let's just get down to the legal stuff. Any outstanding liens, pending lawsuits, any creditor who could attempt to extend their claim to consumers' warehouse Inc. Or any of our subsidiaries?",
        "Iris: No.",
        "Henry: Okay, any outstanding warrants?",
        "Iris: No.",
        "Henry: Okay, any felony convictions?",
        "Iris: What?",
        "Henry: Yeah, just -- I'm sure with you it's just a -- I don't know, it's not that important, but I do have to know. Have you ever been convicted of a crime? It's important, but I do have to know. Have you ever been convicted of a crime?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You have to straighten this out.",
        "Dusty: I will.",
        "Jennifer: And I wanna see Craig.",

        "Barbara: Honey, we'll be right back.",
        "Jennifer: I wanna see Craig.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Jennifer: He knows. I wanna see him.",
        "Paul: He knows what? I think it's a really terrible idea.",
        "Mike: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Craig: She just said she wanted to see me.",
        "Mike: She's beside herself with grief. She doesn't know what she wants.",
        "Craig: You're speaking for her all the time now?",
        "Paul: You can't come in.",
        "Jennifer: No, let him in. He's the only one who knows.",
        "Paul: Knows what?",
        "Jennifer: You saw. Didn't you? You saw the baby.",
        "Craig: I did.",
        "Jennifer: Then you know. Then you know that that's not our baby. You saw it, didn't you? That couldn't be our baby.",

        "Will: Don't be. I'm glad you'll even speak to me.",
        "Celia: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Will: Because I lied to you too.",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Will: I told you I was the father. That was a lie.",
        "Celia: You were protecting Gwen. Protecting Casey who didn't deserve it.",
        "Will: Okay, Casey did a bad thing, but --",
        "Celia: No, don't defend him. That's how he thinks, too. He thinks of himself first. You're not like that. You took care of other people first.",
        "Will: Not just other people. I did it for me, too.",
        "Celia: What did you get out of it, Will?",

        "Jessica: I was gonna leave this with the bartender, but -- I have an arraignment tonight.",
        "Jack: Oh, sorry you can't make it. Thank you.",
        "Jessica: Jack, you all right? What's going on?",
        "Jack: Carly's not here. I can't reach her on her phone.",
        "Jessica: Is there reason for concern?",
        "Jack: I don't know yet.",
        "Jessica: Is she still trying to find out about Iris and the child?",
        "Jack: I don't think so.",
        "Jessica: But you're not sure?",
        "Jack: I backed off her for now. And she promised that she'd leave it alone, at least for tonight.",

        "Henry: Hank. Hank Snickerman.",
        "Iris: You got any I.D., Hank?",
        "Henry: Yeah. I am so sorry, I thought I showed that to you when I came in. Yeah, it's just right there. I really apologize. Now here I am, coming in, what nerve, bringing in some kind of rap sheet. I haven't even showed you my I.D.",
        "Iris: No offense intended.",
        "Henry: You know, there's none taken. There really isn't. Honey, you're gonna have to have a bit of savvy to take care of all this kind of money. You know, I'm glad to see you got it on the ball. I really am. Let's finish up with this paperwork, and then we'll get set up for our photo shoot. What do you say about that, huh?",
        "Iris: Yay!",
        "Henry: Aren't you excited? All right, where were we? Oh, yeah. Any trouble with the law?",
        "Iris: When you say \"trouble\", you mean, like, parking tickets?",
        "Henry: No, no, no. More like felony. You know, even a small one, we have to make adjustments. We don't have to -- not gonna take away the prize, anything like that, don't worry. But we have to tailor the pr a little bit, so --",
        "Iris: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ever pass a bad check?",
        "Iris: No.",
        "Henry: Illegal gambling?",
        "Iris: No.",
        "Henry: Embezzlement?",
        "Iris: No.",
        "Henry: Pandering?",
        "Iris: That's a crime?",
        "Henry: Yeah, you know, that shocked me too. Because in show business and marketing, we just call that a good day's work.",
        "Iris: No pandering. How many more of these do you got?",
        "Carly: None.",
        "Iris: What are you -- how did you even --?",
        "Carly: You told my husband that you were arrested for embezzling. You said that you covered for my father. You said that was the deep, dark secret that's been kept from me for all these years.",
        "Iris: I want you outta here.",
        "Carly: Not until you tell me the truth.",
        "Iris: Don't you call me a liar.",

        "Carly: I'd love to have my husband here. He didn't buy that embezzlement story any more than I did.",
        "Iris: He's the one who told me to come up with it in the first place.",
        "Rosanna: Your own son just died and you haven't shed a tear. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Whoa.",
        "Iris: Nice scam.",
        "Henry: Technically, I didn't take anything from you, so it's not a scam.",
        "Iris: You have no idea what you just took. Now I want you both outta here.",
        "Carly: Too bad.",
        "Iris: You think you're too old to get whipped, girly?",
        "Henry: Wait, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's not a mud ring around here, ladies. So let's just settle down here, okay?",
        "Iris: Take a walk, hank. And you can go, too.",
        "Carly: Or what. You'll call the cops?",
        "Henry: Oh, hey, not the \"c\" word.",
        "Carly: I'd like to have the cops here, myself.",
        "Henry: What do you mean, you'd like to have the cops here? We're taking credentials, taking names. Let's just go, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, not until she tells me the truth.",
        "Iris: You know what, I don't have anything to tell you.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you know what, we've got everything we want. Let's just go on to plan \"B.\"",
        "Iris: You know what, I'm just going to call the cops.",
        "Carly: Fine. You can go, Henry.",
        "Henry: I don't think I should leave you here alone.",
        "Carly: No, I will be fine. And don't worry about the police, I'll cover it for you.",
        "Iris: I'm dialing.",
        "Henry: On my way!",
        "Carly: You like to bluff, Iris? Go ahead, call the police. Please. I'd love to have my husband here. He'll get the truth out of you.",
        "Iris: You think?",
        "Carly: Oh, he didn't buy that embezzlement story any more than I did.",
        "Iris: No? That's funny. Because he's the one who told me to come up with it in the first place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, that was a pretty good story, the embezzlement.",
        "Jack: I thought so. Carly called me an amateur chump for believing it.",
        "Jessica: Well, it'll be hard keeping the truth from her.",
        "Jack: Which is why I got to get her off this whole thing, jess.",
        "Jessica: If she finds out --",
        "Jack: No, don't even think that right now. I can't think about it.",

        "Jack: Is she emotional? I'm more emotional than she is, at this point. She's frustrated. And fragile? We're talking about Carly here. But this -- this would ruin anybody.",
