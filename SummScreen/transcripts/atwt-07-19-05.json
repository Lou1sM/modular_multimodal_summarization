        "Gwen: Yeah. The -- the food stinks. I figured I'd be better off at home.",
        "Bob: You just gave birth. Even a healthy young woman like yourself needs some follow-up care to make sure there are no complications.",

        "Iris: I warned you to let it go.",
        "Carly: Is that possible?",
        "Iris: What?",
        "Carly: Well I couldn't -- I wouldn't have hurt a child. I was just a child myself.",

        "Carly: No.",
        "Iris: You have kids, Carly. You know what it's like -- two's company, three's a crowd. You wanted your daddy all to yourself. You didn't want any part of my kid.",

        "Susan: What?",
        "Alison: Aaron and I talked about it, but then he got me this perfect job, and found a perfect place to live. We get to be together and have everything we want, only not here. Mom, this is good news!",

        "Bob: I didn't say that.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I promised a couple a kid, I'll do it.",
        "Bob: If that's what you want. Who is it that's so sure that you're going to back out?",
        "Gwen: The mom, would-be mom. Will-be mom. She came to me and said that if I can't even look at the baby, then I'm not ready to give him away.",
        "Bob: Did you feel pressured by this woman?",
        "Gwen: No. I feel bad for her. I know she wants this kid really bad. And she doesn't want to get burned. I get that.",
        "Bob: Look Gwen, this is your decision to make. And, you work it out whatever way is best for you. That's the main thing.",
        "Gwen: It's about the kid, not me.",

        "Rosanna: That's an understatement.",
        "Craig: I was just -- I looked at the birth mother, Gwen. I kept seeing the baby with nose rings. Tattoos. And I got a look at him --",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on, don't tell me you were comparing our baby to yours.",
        "Craig: Well, no. No. The truth is I really never got much a glimpse of either of them before he died. This baby is so healthy and strong.",
        "Rosanna: I think you're using this baby.",
        "Craig: Well, sure. So are you. Rosanna, this is going to help us. You know? Besides, this kid is going to have a couple parents falling all over each other to make him completely happy. What's wrong there?",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's just a little unnatural. You know? You're like a -- a faucet. You're on and excited now. But what happens when you switch off?",
        "Craig: I don't switch off on my children.",
        "Rosanna: So you can really think of this baby as yours?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do. Okay? Now come on, let's go to the hospital.",
        "Rosanna: No, I can't go now. Don't you think it's a little -- it's going to be uncomfortable. I mean, with Jennifer there right now?",
        "Craig: No, I checked. Jennifer's asleep, the unit's cleared out. It's the best chance we're going to have to see our baby before we bring him home.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I didn't get a peek at him today.",
        "Craig: So, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Jack: Iris Dumbrowski.",
        "Henry: Yeah, so you said. Is she a friend of Carly's? Maybe they're out shopping? Had a spa day?",
        "Jack: Henry, I will call the taxi and limousine commission and yank your license.",
        "Henry: That's cold, Jack. That's also blatant abuse of power.",
        "Jack: I'm ruthless like that.",
        "Henry: I'd love to tell you, but I can't. Client privilege.",
        "Jack: There's no such thing as limo Driver/passenger confidentiality.",
        "Henry: She didn't hire me as a driver.",
        "Jack: She hired you? As in, paid you?",
        "Henry: Uh-huh. At a discounted rate, I might add. And I earned every penny I can assure you.",
        "Jack: Doing what? I'm mentally running down your rap sheet in my head. You're still a P.I.?",
        "Henry: Well, my license is current in some state.",
        "Jack: She hired you to find Iris Dumbrowski. Right?",
        "Henry: No. Absolutely not.",
        "Jack: Because she'd already found Iris, hadn't she? She wanted you to dig up information.",
        "Henry: Is that gorgeous little girl of yours around? I haven't seen Sage in months.",
        "Jack: What'd you dig up, Henry?",
        "Henry: I bet she's breaking hearts at the wading pool.",
        "Jack: Better answer this one, or you're going to go walking out of here with a limp! Do you understand that? Do you know where Carly is right now? Yes or no?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Jack: Is she okay?",
        "Henry: I would never leave a woman in harm's way.",
        "Jack: There's all kinds of harm, Henry. Did she seem okay to you?",
        "Henry: Sure.",
        "Jack: You don't look sure.",

        "Iris: Why are you trying to play with me?",
        "Carly: No, I'm not. Iris, I don't remember it. I don't. I've seen pictures of you with my father. I remember your voice, but I don't remember you talking to me.",
        "Iris: Oh, I was. And it was you.",
        "Carly: Doing what? I still don't even know what happened.",
        "Iris: Oh, you know.",
        "Carly: No, if I did I wouldn't be here, Iris! Come on! This isn't getting us anywhere.",
        "Iris: I will not go there again.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Iris: I lived it once. I am not going to cut myself open for your amusement.",
        "Carly: This is not funny to me.",
        "Iris: You want to remember, little girl? Well, it's all locked up in your mind. You drag it out yourself.",
        "Carly: I would if I could. All right, what about your son?",
        "Iris: What?",
        "Carly: Well if you don't want to talk about this, that's fine. But maybe I should speak with him? If what you're saying is true, than I probably owe him an apology.",
        "Iris: You get the hell out of here! I swear I'll call the cops. Your husband would be plenty mad you're here, wouldn't he?",
        "Carly: I will be back, Iris. I can't let this drop.",

        "Alison: Yeah. We thought about it, we planned, we're being very grown up.",

        "Susan: What about your car? Is it going to make the drive?",
        "Alison: I'm going to sell it and buy a new one. Aaron's already looking.",
        "Susan: Well.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Susan: Wow. You two are going to be on your own.",
        "Alison: Well, his family's there. Yeah, they're in total chaos with his mom, but I'm used to that. Not lately, I just mean --",
        "Susan: Yeah, I know what you mean. It's okay. I guess I'm the one who's going to be on their own.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Susan: No, don't apologize. Hey, who told you to go for it when he first moved out there? I said nothing should make you pass up true love. Not anything.",
        "Alison: And I won't. What?",
        "Susan: I'm just remembering the first time I saw your beautiful face. My miracle baby. I was always so proud of you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, right. Even when I was in jail?",
        "Susan: What am I going to do without you?",
        "Alison: Mom, there are planes. You can come visit. And not like, right away, but, you know, as soon as we get settled.",
        "Susan: Yeah, I know. I'll give you two room to breathe.",

        "Carly: It's no wonder you loved the embezzlement story. You're the one who told her to make it up.",
        "Jack: Iris said that?",
        "Carly: And I believe her.",
        "Jack: So now you trust Iris more than me?",
        "Carly: You want to look me in the eye and say it's a lie?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Why Jack?",
        "Jack: I wanted to protect you.",
        "Carly: From what? From the truth? So Iris told you the whole story? Well, I know, Jack. So, there's no point in holding back.",
        "Jack: What do you think I'm holding back from you?",
        "Carly: Iris says I hurt her son.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",

        "Jack: She didn't tell me anything more!",
        "Carly: You swear it?",
        "Jack: I swear. She said she didn't want to say another word about it.",
        "Carly: So all you got was this story about how I hurt her little boy?",
        "Jack: Did she tell you anything else?",
        "Carly: No. She kept going in circles. She wouldn't give me any details. When I said that I wanted to speak to her son, she refused to let me contact him.",
        "Jack: Did she say why?",
        "Carly: No. Why do you think?",
        "Jack: It's hard to say what drives the woman.",
        "Carly: Except that she hated me. She made that pretty clear. I guess I was nothing more than a nuisance to her when she was connected to my father.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you don't remember any of that, right?",
        "Carly: No. That's what's so frustrating. Because don't you think that if I did something that horrible, I would remember some part of it?",
        "Jack: You think Iris is lying to you?",
        "Carly: That, or -- or she just remembers it wrong. That's the only other good explanation I can think of why she's acting that way.",

        "Jack: No, I didn't say that, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, you do, Jack. You went to a lot of trouble to keep me from even asking Iris a simple question. Why?",
        "Jack: Sit, come on, you know how precious you are to me. And after everything you've been through this past year, most of it because of me, one way or another --",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: I would do anything to keep you from getting hurt again, Carly. Especially for no reason.",
        "Carly: I am not a china doll, Jack. Really, I will not break. You have to stop being so scared for me.",
        "Jack: No, not in my life. I'll try. So you'll let this thing with Iris go now? Right?",
        "Carly: No. Not until I know for sure, Jack, but when you start holding out on me, that's when I get frightened.",
        "Jack: Okay. All right. So, I find out anything new, I come straight to you. In the mean time, you stay out of it. Huh? Deal?",
