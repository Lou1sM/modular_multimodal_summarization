        "[Baby crying]",
        "Jack: Carly?",
        "Carly: Jack. Oh, you startled me.",
        "Jack: You're starting to scare me, honey. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: Nothing. I'm fine. Just a little rattled, that's all. I didn't sleep very well.",
        "Jack: More bad dreams?",
        "Carly: Eh -- sort of. I keep having these strange flashes. Of a little girl, blonde, and she's walking towards a baby carriage and -- the baby in the carriage is screaming like crazy. Anyway, that's what just happened. It hit me just now.",
        "Jack: You're just upset by what Iris told you, about you somehow hurting her son when you -- when you were a kid. But I thought we decided that she was probably making all that up?",
        "Carly: Jack -- I'm starting to remember things. You don't remember things that haven't happened, do you?",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what I want you to do? I want you to go back to bed. Honey, you're stressed out. That's what's causing this.",
        "Carly: No, no, Jack. I think it's more than stress. And I'm scared.",
        "Jack: Why do you think I want you to let this whole thing go?",
        "Carly: What if it really happened?",
        "Jack: Honey --",
        "Carly: What if Iris was right and I really did something that hurt that little baby?",
        "Jack: Don't do this to yourself, please.",
        "Carly: Please, Jack. You said you would help me. I have to know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yes, Mother, I have taken care of all of the service arrangements. Everything should get started around 2:00 P.M. I'll see you there.",
        "Emily: How's your sister?",
        "Paul: Barbara says that she's still calm. And that she's not talking about it. So, no change there. I guess my mother spent the night at the hospital. They're gonna release Jennifer just in time to go to the service. I just have never seen her so remote.",
        "Emily: She lost her baby, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. I wish she would talk to me about it. Or Will, or even Barbara.",
        "Emily: So, your mother's actually behaving?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. So far, so good. You know what, I'm gonna go to Java and pay for all the catering. And then I'll come back here and get changed, and we can go to the church together.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm not gonna go to the service with you. I think it's a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I could be wrong, but I don't think this is such a hot idea.",
        "Jennifer: I just can't seem to stay away.",
        "Dusty: You've got a long day ahead of you.",
        "Jennifer: The service. I shouldn't -- I shouldn't be here.",
        "Dusty: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Mike sobbing]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Katie: Mike? It's me. Open the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna, you here?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much, Mrs. Bently. Well, I'll see you there. And I apologize for the short notice.",
        "Nurse Bently: Not at all. Although I am curious. It sounds so urgent.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't worry, it's no mystery. It's just that, as nurse supervisor, I thought perhaps you could answer a few questions that I have, that's all. Great. I'll see you soon. Good-bye.",
        "Craig: Hello.",
        "Rosanna: Hello. Ahh -- have you been home?",
        "Craig: Ah, yes, I've been home a while. I was looking for you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Well, I've been out.",
        "Craig: Yes, you got out early, didn't you.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I did. I had some errands to run.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm glad you're back. I have a surprise for you.",
        "Rosanna: You do? A surprise? For me?",
        "Craig: Yes. Two, actually. First of all, this.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Craig, they're beautiful.",
        "Craig: Huh? Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: What's the occasion?",
        "Craig: No, no occasion. They're just flowers. And Phyllis has made us a brunch. It's out in the gazebo. You hungry?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's lovely. Well, I would love to, but I can't. I have a lunch appointment. And I have to go right now.",
        "Craig: Why don't you cancel it?",
        "Rosanna: I can't. This is something that just can't be postponed. Sorry.",
        "Craig: Is something wrong? You seem nervous.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. Listen, thank you so much for these. They're so beautiful. Would you have Phyllis put them in some water for me?",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much. I'm so sorry to be missing what I'm sure is going to be a beautiful brunch.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Well, it'll keep.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Are you not going to the service because of Hal and Barbara?",
        "Emily: I think Hal's right. What he said, I'm not part of your family, Paul. And I don't want this to be harder on anybody than it already is.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but what about me? I could really use you sitting there with me.",
        "Emily: It's going to be a tough day for you, isn't it?",
        "Paul: Yeah, for everyone. The most important thing is what Jennifer wants. Yeah, you're right -- look, I don't wanna make this tougher for you. If you don't want to go, I totally understand.",
        "Emily: Okay, just -- can I let you know when you get back?",
        "Paul: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Paul: And whatever you decide it's okay.",
        "Emily: Thanks. It's nice to be needed for a change.",
        "Paul: It's not just about need. I really want you there with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: No, it's urgent that I speak with Mrs. Bently. She didn't tell you where she's having lunch. Isn't that standard nursing procedure? No. I don't want to leave her a message. I want to talk to her in person. Thank you. For all your help. Rosanna, what are you trying to find out? Oh, Margo, I can't now. I'm busy.",
        "Margo: Craig, I know where you're going. That's why I'm here.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: How could you know?",
        "Margo: Oh, just intuition. But I'm not gonna let it happen.",
        "Craig: Let what happen?",
        "Margo: Let you crash the service. You're not going anywhere. You're staying right here, with me. I'm not letting you out that door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for meeting with me, Mrs. Bently.",
        "Nurse Bently: You said you had some questions.",
        "Rosanna: Well, actually, I was hoping you would accept this.",
        "Nurse Bently: Oh, wow. That's very generous. To what does the nurse's organization owe the honor?",
        "Rosanna: Well, you saved my son's life. You and your staff. I'm incredibly grateful, and I would just like to thank you all. In fact, is it possible that I could have a list of everyone's names and addresses?",
        "Nurse Bently: I'll need to check with them first, but I don't think it'll be a problem.",
        "Rosanna: That would be wonderful.",
        "Nurse Bently: Although I'm not sure about Kristin Thompson. She just left us.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. I remember her, she was especially helpful. What happened?",
        "Nurse Bently: She just up and quit, right in the middle of a shift.",
        "Rosanna: Personal problems?",
        "Nurse Bently: Quite the opposite. Apparently, she won some sort of sweepstakes, cashed it in and took off. Kind of odd if you ask me.",
        "Rosanna: Did she happen to leave a forwarding address?",
        "Nurse Bently: No, I'm sorry. You'd've thought she'd leave one, so we could send a final check, but I guess she didn't need it anymore.",
        "Rosanna: She just up and left in the middle of a shift?",
        "Nurse Bently: Luckily it was a rather slow day on the ward. Only two premies born.",
        "Rosanna: Only two?",
        "Nurse Bently: That's right. Yours and the Kasnoff baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Look, if you can't deal with this today, people will understand. If they don't, too bad. Your health is the most important thing. Even if you -- don't feel up to it.",
        "Jennifer: Who's ever up to burying their child? But maybe -- maybe by going there, by doing it, facing it -- maybe I could find this peace that everyone keeps talking about.",
        "Dusty: I hope you do. I really do. What do you want me to do?",
        "Jennifer: Get me out of here.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Where do you want to go?",
        "Jennifer: I want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Don't take this the wrong way. I really appreciate you stopping by, but this is something I want to take care of this on my own, all right?",
        "Katie: Mike, nobody should have to take care of this alone. It's too impossible. Jennifer's gets released today.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm sure she's gonna come home before the service. We haven't had a chance to figure things out yet.",
        "Katie: So this is still her home. Oh -- did you make this? It's so beautiful.",
        "Mike: It's useless now.",
        "Katie: No, don't say that.",
        "Mike: What am I supposed to say? Where am I going to do put this thing? I don't -- I don't have a place for it. It's -- it's too big for the box. Maybe I could just break it up.",
        "Katie: No, no. That's not the answer.",
        "Mike: What is the answer? Things don't make very much sense to me right now.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Mike. I'm so sorry. I don't even know what to say to you. What can I do? How can I help you?",
        "Mike: You being here is enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Iris: What? What? Oh, it's you. What do you want?",
        "Jack: I want to know what the hell happened between you and my wife. I thought we had a deal, Iris.",
        "Iris: Carly blindsided me. She hit me with a left with some huckster who pretended that I'd won a bundle of money, and they started asking me all these questions, and that's when he caught me up in a lie.",
        "Jack: What lie?",
        "Iris: I said I'd never had a run-in with the law. And, wuff -- that was it. Your wife was off and running.",
        "Jack: You were supposed to prevent that from happening.",
        "Iris: Hey, you're the one who dragged me back into this. You want to keep this story dead and buried, then you start by putting a leash on you wife.",
        "Jack: I am doing everything i can to make sure she doesn't dig into this any further. I need your help, though.",
        "Iris: You think I want to dredged this back up again? It took a long time for me to put it to rest and I want it to stay there. But if your wife backs me into a corner, I promise you, the only thing she's gonna find is trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, Kim. Come on in.",
        "Kim: Hi, darling. I can only stay a couple of minutes. How are you doing?",
        "Carly: Don't ask.",
        "Kim: Ahh. All right, I won't. Actually, I have some kind of interesting news about the woman you told me about? Iris Dumbrowski?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh?",
        "Kim: I found a news story from I don't know how long ago. The thing is, Ray isn't mentioned at all, so I don't really know if it has anything to do with you and your family or not.",
        "Carly: You have the tape?",
        "Kim: Yeah. Viola.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "Kim: So, the thing is, I don't know if this is important or not.",
        "Carly: What was the news story about?",
        "Kim: I haven't had a chance to really look at it all. All I know is it has something to do about a missing baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, you're really leaving today? I mean, right now? It's so soon.",
        "Alison: Well, for you maybe, not for me. I can't wait to get to Seattle and see Aaron. It's been way too long.",
        "Emily: I know. I know it has. I'm so happy for you, ali. I'm just -- I'm gonna miss you so much.",
        "Alison: Me, too.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I have a present for you. It's no big deal. No big deal.",
        "Emily: You do? What did you bring me?",
        "Alison: It's just something I thought you might like.",
        "[Emily gasps]",
        "Emily: Alison, I remember this. Oh, you were, like, seven when you made this. You said that this is where you were going to live in when you grew up.",
        "Alison: I keep waiting. I keep putting it on my wall wherever I live.",
        "Emily: Honey, I can't keep this. This is your dream, honey.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I've got my dream. It's in Seattle with Aaron. Emily, it's your turn. Maybe this'll help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I can't do this.",
        "Katie: What, you can't grieve? Mike, you wanted this baby just as much as Jennifer did. How many times do you have to almost be a father? I was with you in Montana, I know what you're going through.",
        "Mike: I guess you do. All right. I've gotta get this stuff out of here before she -- before she comes back here.",
        "Katie: Let me do it.",
        "Mike: No, no, I can't. I can't ask you to do this.",
        "Katie: Please, Mike, I want to. I know you feel responsible for what happened, and so do I. Not because we found each other again. Although I would take everything back if it would change this. Because I know we love each other. And if we didn't find each other in Chicago, it would've been somewhere else.",
        "Mike: Only it was Chicago.",
        "Katie: I know. And I'm so sorry that Jennifer saw us together, and I'm sorry that we didn't sit her down or make her go to a doctor or at least make her call her brother or mother or something. [Katie sobbing] I mean, the fact is, we both care about her and the baby, and we really messed up. We blew it.",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, we did.",
        "Katie: And, I mean, maybe she would've lost the baby anyway. But that's not the point. You lost a baby and that's enough for today. So, please, just let me do this. Let me help you. You go get dressed, and I'll take care of this stuff, okay?",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Oh, God, please help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, Margo. I had no idea Jennifer's family was planning a service today.",
        "Margo: Yes, you did.",
        "Craig: No. I've been preoccupied. I have a son coming. I have to prepare for his arrival. But I have no intention of going to that service. Margo, it would be inappropriate. And I accept that. So you can lose the house arrest. Okay?",
        "Margo: Okay, Craig, consider it lost. I know that you're hurting, Craig. I know after Bryant, and now this. I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: Thank you. But I can't give in to grief anymore. I just can't. And I have a son coming. You know?",
        "Margo: I'm glad that you have this new son in your life.",
        "Craig: Not nearly as glad as I am.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry I was so hard on you when I came in. I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: You're were just looking out for me.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Well, all right, then I guess I'll go. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Margo: And take care of yourself.",
        "Craig: I always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Bently: I'll get you the names and numbers of my staff.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, thank you. And if, by any chance, you happen to run across an address or contact information for Ms. Thompson, I'd really appreciate it.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'll see what I can do. Good-bye, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Rosanna: Good-bye, Mrs. Bently.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Paul: If that's your husband calling, why won't you answer it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna, it's me. Listen, I want to talk to you, but I'm on my way out, so call me when you get the message, will you? Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: Hello. What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Paul: I'm available if you ever need to talk about anything.",
        "Dusty: I knew this was a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: We're burying our son today, Craig.",
        "Craig: I know. I know. And I have no intention of going to the service, if that's what you're worried about. I know I'm not welcomed.",
        "Jennifer: You -- I'm here to tell you that you are welcome, Craig, if you want to attend. And no one will keep you out. I'll make sure of that.",
        "Craig: That's very generous.",
        "Jennifer: Our history is what it is, Craig. And it's in the past. He was your son, too. You deserve a chance to say good-bye.",
        "Craig: Thank you. I know it took a lot for you to come here today. Thank you. But my presence upsets your entire family, you know that.",
        "Jennifer: I don't care. Today is about our child. Nothing else. The service is at 2:00 at Luther's Corner Church. You are welcome, and so is Rosanna. I think you should be there.",
        "Dusty: That's the woman you tried to destroy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Hello, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hello, Mother.",
        "Susan: I just -- Alison, if you don't hurry up, you're going to miss your flight.",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You've been out in the car waiting for her this whole time?",
        "Susan: I didn't know if I'd be welcome.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? After some of the things you said to me, I should slam this door in your face. But for Alison's sake, come in.",
        "Susan: Well, if you're really sure. [Emily groans] Paul's not here, is he?",
        "Emily: Oh, for crying out loud, do you need a written invitation? He's not home.",
        "Alison: Emily, why don't you come with us to the airport? We could have lunch before my flight.",
        "Emily: Oh, honey, I would love to go, but today's the day of the service for Jennifer's baby, and Paul asked me to go with him.",
        "Alison: Oh, oh, right. I'm sorry. I should've known. I'm sorry.",
        "Susan: You're really going to go to that?",
        "Emily: Yes, I'm really going to go. Paul asked me to go.",
        "Susan: You think that's smart?",
        "Emily: You know what? I'd stop it right now, because I could very easily unwelcome you.",
        "Susan: Well, do whatever you want. But I think that you should be with your family. Go to the airport, send your sister off, but if you insist on tagging along with Paul to a service where you're not even wanted, it's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it's nothing. Craig has been trying to pull me away from work all morning and have lunch with him, but I've just been too busy. I finally just stopped answering the phone.",
        "Paul: Do you mind if I sit down?",
        "Rosanna: No, please. How is Jennifer?",
        "Paul: She's putting on a brave front, but she's falling apart inside.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sure. It can't be easy. It's just going to take her a lot of time and -- all you can do now is just give her as much support as you possibly can.",
        "Paul: I will. We all will.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, will you do me a favor? Will you please extend my deepest sympathies to Jennifer? I know that she must hate me for marrying Craig, but I hope that she knows that I never would've let him take her child away from her.",
        "Paul: None of that matters now. And it was always about Craig. Not about you. But Craig has a child now, and Jennifer doesn't. Where's the justice in that?",
        "Rosanna: There's no justice. No justice at all. It just isn't fair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I want to know exactly what you said to Carly.",
        "Iris: Just that she hurt my kid. Nothing else.",
        "Jack: You think that was going to get her off your back?",
        "Iris: I told her she'd regret it if she dug any further.",
        "Jack: That's like catnip to someone like Carly. She's not going to stop, Iris. She's going to want to get to the truth.",
        "Iris: Why do you think she was here in the first place? She was digging for answers. Obviously she didn't buy that embezzlement story you cooked up, so don't blame me. You're the only one who can stop her.",
        "Jack: You stay away from her from now on. You understand me? Don't go anywhere near my wife.",
        "Iris: No. And you keep her away from me. Because if she ever finds out the truth after all these years -- I don't think she'll be able to handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Come on, Carly. All you have to do is press play.",
        "Newscaster: Meanwhile, just outside Luther's Corners, police are still investigating the disturbing disappearance of the newborn who was presumably left in a baby carriage in the woods.",
        "[Carly remembering]",
        "Iris: My boy! My beautiful boy! What have you done to my boy?",

        "Emily: I want to see you off, honey.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what about Paul?",
        "Susan: Paul will be surrounded by his entire family.",
        "Alison: But he wants Emily to be there, Mom.",
        "Susan: Honey -- [Susan chuckles] Honey, if he really cared about Emily, he'd want to protect her against what's surely going to happen if you show up there.",
        "Emily: Okay, stop it right there. From now on, you are to keep your opinions about Paul to yourself. The man is in my life, and I want him there. So back off, okay?",

        "Susan: Yeah, okay.",
        "Alison: Both of you, both of you. These are my last few hours in Oakdale, and I'd like them to be about me, if you don't mind. Emily, you're going with Paul because he wants you to be there. And Mom, not another word about it, okay? Emily can say good-bye to me just as easily here as she can at the airport. Okay, end of discussion. Picture time. Okay? Get close. No frowning.

        "Paul: It's not your fault. You should just be happy and thankful that you have that child in your life.",

        "Katie: Oh, I put everything in the trunk of my car. I figured I'd hold onto it for a couple of days in case Jennifer wants some of it back. If not, I'll just take it to the hospital thrift shop.",

        "Carly: Yeah. It was stupid of me not to listen to you, Jack. It was stupid to pursue the whole thing with Iris and my father. What matters to me is you and me and our kids and our life together. And I don't ever want to do anything to mess that up.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. But I gotta ask, where's this coming from? What happened? Something had to make you change your mind.",

        "Jack: Me?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I saw what this was doing to you. I saw what it was doing to us. And I suddenly realized that it just -- it just wasn't worth it. I was making myself crazy over something that I might never find the answer to. I think I ought to just leave the past in the past.",

        "Margo: Well, then don't. Don't. Listen to me. Mike and Jennifer are going through something devastating right now. Nobody should have to go through something like that. You've got to be sensitive to it, Katie.",
