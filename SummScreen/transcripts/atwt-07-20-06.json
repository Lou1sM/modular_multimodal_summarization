        "Jade: Is Casey working tonight?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. We may need you to cover. He called, he said something about Maddie -- helping her out.",
        "Jade: I think she's finally gone off the deep end, slashing Lia's car.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just -- I wish I knew what was going on with her. Anyways, thank you for coming early and helping out with deliveries and everything.",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah, I can definitely use the overtime. And riding in with you saves me bus fare. So --",

        "Maddie: Can I go home?",
        "Henry: Our sister Eve has been a miracle worker. She's got a lawyer, and we're working on getting the bail set.",

        "Maddie: Yeah, can I use your cell phone, Henry?",

        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, she is.",

        "Margo: Maddie -- Maddie got through the night just fine. Her brother and sister are with her. And she has expressed remorse for what she's done.",
        "Lia: We've all done stupid stuff -- you know, pranks and stuff.",
        "Casey: Maddie wouldn't have trashed your car unless something was wrong with her, Mom. Something bad's going on.",
        "Lia: She's such a sweet girl. I mean, I wish there was something we could do for her.",
        "Margo: Wow, that is very -- that is extremely generous of you, Lia. And you know what? I'm gonna take you up on that. There is, in fact, something you can do to help to Maddie.",

        "Katie: And you're just calling me now? Who is this? I mean, what company is he with?",
        "Carly: I don't know I couldn't get the whole e-mail, so I couldn't do any research. I just hope I don't blow it.",
        "Katie: You're not going to. Listen, as soon as he sees that business proposal, he's gonna hire you right away.",
        "Carly: You think so? Even though I have absolutely no experience in interior design?",
        "Katie: Listen, just go be your confident self. Grab a table early and just site there and practice being authoritative. And call me as soon as you're done.",
        "Carly: Hey, why don't you meet me afterward? Come to Lakeview in an hour, and we'll celebrate.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'm there. Good luck! [Saw running] What are you doing?",
        "Mike: Building our future.",
        "Carly: Thank you. And later, could you bring over a bottle of your best champagne? With two flutes already filled and the rest of the bottle on ice? But don't bring it over until you see me talking to my girlfriend. She's cute as a button -- long, blonde hair.",
        "Bartender: Got it.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Because, you know, I'm meeting a potential backer here, you know, in just a couple of minutes.",

        "Holden: That's great news!",
        "Lucy: So we're taking Lily and the baby off the critical list for now.",

        "Lucy: Did Grandmother go home?",
        "Holden: Yeah, she's with the girls right now.",
        "Lucy: And Luke?",
        "Holden: I tried to call him about 20 times last night. I finally left him message and told him that the situation was critical for both Lily and the baby.",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm sure he'll call you back. That's not like him --",

        "Cop #1: We've got an SVA with injuries. Request an ambulance. Mill Road at Highway Ten. How's he doing?",

        "Holden: Lucinda left him messages, I have Jack trying to figure out where he is --",
        "Lucy: Did you call Damian?",
        "Holden: I did. I left a message for Damian, told him to have Luke call me, but I haven't heard from him either. What you said about the breech reversal, you said it was working. What exactly does that mean?",
        "Lucy: Well, we've bought some time. But I'm sure Dr. Hughes already told you -- there's no guarantee that the baby won't move back into the breech position again.",
        "Holden: Then we're back where we started. Where I could, lose Lily or the baby. Or both of them. [Cell phone rings] Luke?",

        "Holden: What do you mean, looks like?",
        "Jack: He was in a car accident. Off Highway Ten at the Mill Road.",

        "Eve: Maddie, the lawyer was really clear about this.",
        "Henry: You can't have contact with anyone on the case, not Casey, not Lia --",
        "Maddie: I don't want to talk to Lia! I need to talk to Casey.",
        "Henry: Why, Sweetheart?",
        "Maddie: Because I need to explain to him. I need to get him to understand --",
        "Eve: Honey, how do you explain what you did without getting into what you told us last night? Are you ready to tell this boy you were attacked back in Chicago, because last night, you made it pretty clear that you didn't want to talk about this with anyone?",
        "Maddie: I know, but, I just --",
        "Henry: Give her a break.",
        "Eve: I just don't think it's time to be calling someone who's just going to ask a lot of questions she can't answer.",
        "Henry: I know. I agree with you. Just stop being so hard on her.",
        "Eve: You're too easy on her. Look where she's ended up. I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: No, no. You're right. It's true.",
        "Eve: No, it's not. Maddie -- I let you down, Maddie. I should have realized something was terribly wrong when you left Chicago so quickly.",
        "Maddie: It's okay.",
        "Eve: It will be. I've decided to stay here in Oakdale with you and Henry for a while.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Henry: What about Louis? Won't he be upset that his wife ditching him?",
        "Eve: He'll barely miss me. He's on the road so much anyway.",
        "Henry: Okay, well that's great. Right, Maddie?",
        "Eve: I know I can be a little bossy sometimes. But I love you, Maddie. And you need me, don't you? Honey, don't worry. Soon it will all be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lia: I want to help Maddie. I mean, you know I do. What about my car?",
        "Casey: You've got insurance, right?",
        "Lia: Okay, what about the deductible?",
        "Margo: I'm sure that Maddie and her family will be more than happy to take care of that.",
        "Lia: Oh, that's okay -- I guess.",
        "Margo: Okay, so then you'll drop the charges? Effective immediately?",
        "Lia: Sure, but --",
        "Casey: But what? What's the problem?",
        "Lia: What if Maddie's dangerous or something?",
        "Casey: She's not. I promise. Please?",
        "Lia: All right. I'll drop the charges.",
        "Casey: Thank you! Geez!",
        "Lia: You better stick around to protect me. Just in case --",
        "Casey: I will. I will. So what happens next?",
        "Margo: Next, Maddie gets out of jail, and then she gets the help that she needs to deal with some things.",
        "Casey: What things?",
        "Margo: Just some personal things. I can't talk about them, Casey.",
        "Lia: Mrs. Hughes? Look, I don't want to start trouble or anything. And I want to help Maddie, but --",
        "Margo: What? What is it?",
        "Lia: I'm a little scared of her right now. I mean, her and Casey used to go out. And now me and him are hanging out. And that seems to be what set her off.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. And I'm gonna make it very clear to Maddie that she's to stay away from both of you and Casey for a while.",
        "Lia: Thank you.",
        "Casey: Mom, I need to talk to her. I need to see her.",
        "Margo: No, that's not a good idea right now.",
        "Casey: But, Mom --",
        "Margo: It's not a good idea right now, Casey. It's for Maddie's sake. Look, she needs some time. And you're just gonna have give it to her. Thanks so much, Lia.",
        "Lia: It's okay. Are you okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Thanks for dropping those charges.",
        "Lia: See, I'm not like all people think. I can be nice.",
        "Casey: I'm starting to believe that.",
        "Lia: We should go do something tonight. Just the two of us.",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Lia: So I can show you just how nice I can be -- to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, um, we had breakfast. I go out for a couple of errands and I come home and there's all this. What are you doing?",
        "Mike: I'm building an extended deck for the house.",
        "Katie: Okay. Why?",
        "Mike: I love you. I love this house. But it's not really mine.",
        "Katie: What are you talking about? Of course it's yours.",
        "Mike: I didn't forget this place started out as your dream house with Simon.",
        "Katie: I don't think of it that way anymore. I mean it. You and I fell in love here. We christened practically every square inch of this place with an emphasis on the couch for some reason.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm staking a claim.",
        "Katie: On me or on this place?",
        "Mike: Both. I don't know. When I saw Simon, it just got me thinking -- he thought he had a shot with you.",
        "Katie: He was wrong.",
        "Mike: Well, that's because you made a choice. To be with me and only me. All right, and I'm making a choice to build something for us. All right, come here. Close your eyes. Wood has memory. Okay, touch, sound, vibration. It all becomes part of the wood. Gives it texture.",
        "Katie: I never thought of it that way.",
        "Mike: My love for you is already in here. When I see you, I think about you coming out here, barefoot, having your morning coffee. Us dancing out here on a summer night. Barbecuing, holding our babies together out here. Too mushy?",
        "Katie: No, and what would we do after we put the kids to sleep?",
        "Mike: I'll come out here and I'll hold you. And we'll watch the night together. That's the life. That's our life. And it begins right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're a dead man, Frasier!",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah. I've heard that a few times before. Actually, do you want to have a seat? Should we --",
        "Carly: What game are you playing here? You let me think -- how can you do this?",
        "Simon: I'm prepared to make you a serious business offer, Carly.",
        "Carly: You don't know anything about my business --",
        "Simon: Yeah, you see. I was here last night and I overheard your less than successful chat with a certain banker.",
        "Carly: You had no right to eavesdrop on me and any conversation I have with anybody!",
        "Simon: That guy really was a drone, wasn't he? Shall we get a cup -- you already got a cup. Can I get coffee?",
        "Carly: Simon, I'm not doing anything with you.",
        "Simon: Well, I think you'll have second thoughts about that. See, I picked up your card, and I checked out your website. Now, Carly, I think your business definitely has tremendous potential.",
        "Carly: And you would like to invest?",
        "Simon: Yes, yeah. I would actually. That would be nice.",
        "Carly: With what?",
        "Simon: Money, whatever you need.",
        "Carly: You have money?",
        "Simon: Lots of it. So, shall we talk?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes, we should talk. And let me start my pitch by saying this, you can take your money and shove it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lucy. Have you seen Luke?",
        "Lucy: You don't know where he is?",
        "Damian: He didn't come home last night? I was hoping he would to come back here to visit his mother.",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Damian: Hey, you know something, right? Has something happened to Luke? Lucy, please tell me. Where's my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How is he?",
        "EMT: Nothing serious. A few cuts. The kid's lucky.",
        "Holden: Luke! Are you okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Paramedics just checked him out. Nothing but bumps and lumps.",
        "Holden: What happened? Have you been drinking? Luke?",
        "Jack: He tested at a 1.1 and given that the accident happened hours ago, he was probably pretty intoxicated when he was actually driving.",
        "Luke: Look, Dad. I got this message on my phone about Mom. Is she okay?",
        "Holden: So, you got my message, you knew your mom was in critical condition. But you went and got drunk anyway --",
        "Luke: I mean, look. It happened after -- is Mom okay?",
        "Holden: Mom's fine. What are we looking at here, Jack?",
        "Jack: For starters, he's gonna have his license suspended. And he could be facing criminal charges.",
        "Holden: How could you do this, Luke? How could you start drinking again?",
        "[Luke remembering]",
        "Luke: I don't need any, no.",
        "Ada: I thought you said you wanted to have fun?",

        "Gwen: Yeah, we'll probably just gonna get a small place down by campus.",
        "Jade: Oakdale U?",
        "Will: Yeah. Now that we can afford to go --",
        "Jade: Oh, you're going straight from summer school to college? If I were you, I would be taking a break on a nice, hot beach.",
        "Will: We might try and squeeze that in, too.",
        "Gwen: I'm excited. We finally get to have a place of our own. You know? Like real newlyweds.",
        "Jade: That's great. I'm really, really happy for you guys.",
        "Gwen: Oh, jade -- with staying at Carly's, I didn't even think --",

        "Gwen: I'll talk to my sister. I'm sure that she'll let you stay.",
        "Jade: No, please don't. Carly would probably say okay to be nice, but she hardly knows me. And you guys have already done so much for me. Will got me this job, and I've actually saved some money. So, --",
        "Gwen: Enough for rent and a security deposit?",

        "Jade: It just blindsided me, you know. You guys moving out. I just -- I need a second.",
        "Will: You don't have enough money for a decent place, do you?",
        "Jade: Let me worry about that.",
        "Will: Well, you can let us help you try to figure something out.",
        "Jade: Will, please. Let's just get real here.",
        "Will: I thought we were already there.",
        "Jade: Oh, come on. You got to be relieved that we aren't going to be living in the same house together anymore. So, you don't have to see me every day and be constantly reminded of what we did.",
        "Will: I'm worried about you.",
        "Jade: I bet you are. You've got money and I don't. You think I'm gonna make you pay to keep me quiet?",

        "Henry: Hey, is it time for the arraignment?",
        "Margo: I have good news. The charges have been dropped. You are free to go, Maddie.",

        "Margo: There is a condition, however.",
        "Henry: Sure, fine. Whatever gets her out of here, we are all over it. What's the deal, Margo?",
        "Margo: I need you to make me a promise.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Margo: You promise me that you will talk to someone, get the help you need to deal with what happened.",
        "Maddie: I hate -- I hate talking about it.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. Listen to me, Maddie. You have been sexually assaulted. You didn't deserve it, you didn't ask for it. But you do have to deal with it. Because it's going to be eating you up inside. And all the fear and all that pain, it's gonna find its way out somehow.",
        "Maddie: Like with Lia's car. I'm really sorry.",
        "Margo: It's okay. Listen, I made a list of therapists. Just pick one and stick to it.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Henry: All right. Let's -- thanks Margo. Let's get you home.",

        "Maddie: I really need to talk to him. I've been --",
        "Margo: You know what? No, it's not a good idea if you see him.",
        "Maddie: I need to talk to him, though.",
        "Margo: No, I think that you need to deal with the assault and come to grips with that. And maybe later.",
        "Maddie: I can't see Casey?",
        "Margo: Maddie, whose sweater did you burn? Whose car did you slash?",
