        "Iris claims to have changed her ways and tells Gwen and Will that she is clean and sober because she has found God. Gwen doesn't believe Iris but wishes that what she told her was true. When Gwen tries to call the police to tell them Iris is in town, Iris threatens to take Barbara to jail with her, because Barbara was also involved in the adoption scam that gave them Hallie. Iris and Gwen agree that if she leaves town now, Gwen won't call the police. Iris gives Will the first installment to pay Barbara back for the money Barbara gave to her. Gwen knows Iris isn't going to leave town until she gets whatever it is she wants, so she asks Will to call Paul and see if they can move into Fairwinds until they find Barbara. Gwen is right about Iris who calls the Wagon Wheel Motel to make a reservation.",
        "Lucinda decides to speed up the pace of her plan to ruin Craig. She calls her friend Francoise to let her know because she doesn't want Lily to suffer too much and have time to heal from the pain. Lucinda feels badly about her plan when Lily tells her how happy she is about the new perfume company, since she has something positive to focus on that helps her keep her mind off Holden's wedding. Gabriel overhears Lucinda's call to Francoise and knows Lucinda wants to ruin Craig.",
        "Holden warns Craig to stay away from Lily and keep her away from whatever shady business he is doing now. Craig tells Holden that he will stay away from Lily only if he wants him to do so, and besides Lily isn't Holden's concern anymore since he is marrying Molly. Molly and Holden make the final wedding plans but he is distracted because he worries that Lily is getting too involved with Craig. Molly tells Carly that Lily and Craig bumped into each other in New York. She worries that Craig is up to something since neither Lily nor Craig mentioned anything to her about running into each other in New York. Craig wants Gabriel to work with him once he has finished the cabin, but Gabriel thinks working with Craig is a bad idea. Carly thinks she has figured out what Craig is up to now and bursts into his hotel to confront him about his latest scheme."

        "Iris: Look, I know what you're thinking, Gwennie.",
        "Gwen: The only reason I'm not saying it is because we don't use that kind of language in front of Hallie.",
        "Iris: Oh, you are such a good mommy. And you're right. I apologize. I should not have been helping myself to Barbie's perfume. But, you know, what did it matter? She wasn't here?",
        "Gwen: How did you know Barbara wasn't here?",
        "Will: How did you get in?",
        "Iris: Well, the cleaning crew here is so nice. They were in here, and they were cleaning up. And they wouldn't let me in, so I started showing pictures of Gwen and me.",
        "Gwen: It must have been a really old photo.",
        "Iris: And when they realized that I was Gwennie's mama --",
        "Will: Why did you come back here, Iris?",
        "Iris: Well, for one reason, I wanted to see my beautiful granddaughter. Come to Grandma, beauty!",
        "Gwen: You don't know this lady, Baby. Stay right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I can't believe this is all ours. [Laughs]",
        "Lily: Signed, sealed, and paid for. We own a perfume factory.",
        "Carly: We do, in France.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Carly: And you got every single concession we wanted from Fran\u00e7oise. How did you do that?",
        "Lily: It wasn't easy.",
        "Carly: I wish that I'd been in New York with you.",
        "Lily: Oh, then it would have been two of us stuck in a yucky motel with no A.C. or no lights.",
        "Carly: And besides, it doesn't seem like you needed me at all. You did a great job all on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Yes, yes. I got the photos of the property. I got them, and, uh, I've looked at them. I approved them. I want you to, uh, e-mail me the confirmation on the changes, and we'll -- then we'll talk. Okay. Thank you. [Lucinda sighs] Oh, God. Holden! Holden, we need to talk. Um -- are you living here now?",
        "Gabriel: No, I'm just working here.",
        "Lucinda: What were you doing upstairs?",
        "Gabriel: Washing up. I'm on a break while the paint dries. Is that okay with you? Oh, and Holden's not here, by the way.",
        "Lucinda: My granddaughter tells me that Jack has given you a job fixing up a cabin.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, so?",
        "Lucinda: Well, that does give me pause.",
        "Gabriel: Why's that?",
        "Lucinda: You took a sizable chunk of my money --",
        "Gabriel: No, you gave that to me.",
        "Lucinda: -- To go away.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, uh, whoops.",
        "Lucinda: Now you subject yourself to manual labor, rather than living a life of leisure and style?",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, well, actually, about that money, I lost that in a poker game.",
        "Lucinda: You are more like your father every day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You ordered the food?",
        "Molly: Would I let you starve at your own wedding?",
        "Holden: Music?",
        "Molly: Got to have a first dance, yeah.",
        "Holden: Flowers?",
        "Molly: [Laughs] How much do I love you? What groom remembers flowers? And yes, before you ask, Carly's been working on the dress since the minute I said the word \"Wedding\" to her.",
        "Holden: I was hoping you'd just wear flowers and nothing else.",
        "Molly: Well, I'm saving that for the honeymoon, Baby.",
        "Holden: [Chuckles] So all I have to do is just show up.",
        "Molly: Yep. That's it.",
        "Holden: I won't be late.",
        "Molly: I got to go.",
        "Holden: Already?",
        "Molly: Yes. I asked Carly to help me find a cocktail dress for the rehearsal dinner, so I'm meeting her at Fashions. Do you want to come?",
        "Holden: No, no. You go ahead and get started. I'll catch up in a while.",
        "Molly: Okay. Love you.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Craig: You wanted to see me?",
        "Holden: I thought you were going to call me, set up a time.",
        "Craig: I'm here. You're here. What do you want?",
        "Holden: I want to know what you were really doing with Lily in New York.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Tell me all the details. I want to hear the entire horror story.",
        "Lily: Horror story?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- New York in the middle of a blackout with an airport strike. It must have been a nightmare. How did you manage?",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Craig: Do you have to be so mesmerizing? You have a beautiful back, by the way.",
        "Lily: I just asked myself \"What would Carly do?\"",
        "Craig: We've already had this conversation, Holden, when you called Lily's room looking for her.",
        "Holden: Right. And I spoke to Lily about it when he got home.",
        "Craig: Then why are we here?",
        "Holden: Well, you see, the things is, what you said and what she said -- two different stories.",
        "Craig: So Lily and I didn't use exactly precisely the same language when describing our trip. How maddeningly autonomous of us.",
        "Holden: Don't mess with me, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh. You really expect me to take this seriously? I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: You told me that you and Lily bumped into each other at the airport and that you ended up staying at the same airport hotel. Isn't that what you said?",
        "Craig: What did Lily tell you?",
        "Holden: That you ran into each other in midtown.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: This is what you have questions about? This is the mystery keeping you up at night?",
        "Holden: Why won't you just tell me what's really going on?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Holden: No?",
        "Craig: I don't owe you any explanations, Holden, and neither does Lily, for that matter. If you didn't get the memo, you're not married to her anymore.",
        "Holden: She's still the mother of my children.",
        "Craig: It doesn't make her an indentured servant. Oh, you didn't forget that you're marrying someone else pretty soon, did you?",
        "Holden: Why can't you just give me a straight answer?",
        "Craig: All right, I'll answer your question, if you answer mine.",
        "Holden: Which is?",
        "Craig: If you're no longer in love with your ex-wife, why would the details of any time I spend with Lily be so important to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Lily -- Lily!",
        "Lily: What? What's the matter?",
        "Carly: There's -- there's a charge here for 500,000 Euros.",
        "Lily: Oh, that.",
        "Carly: Oh -- we didn't discuss this! Francoise never mentioned 500,000 Euros.",
        "Lily: It's just the price of doing business overseas. It -- it doesn't matter.",
        "Carly: Now that we have to come up with this kind of money, where are we gonna get it?",
        "Lily: I covered it.",
        "Carly: You took care of this?",
        "Lily: Yeah. It was -- it was a negotiating point. I -- I was forced to make a decision on the fly, so I did.",
        "Carly: Yowsa. That's a lot of money.",
        "Lily: I know. And I'm sorry that I didn't mention it earlier. It was just, um, you know, it was something I had to do. There was no way around it, not if we wanted the factory, so I just made an executive decision.",
        "Carly: Ah. Well, now I know you were lying before.",
        "Lily: What?!",
        "Carly: When you said that you handled things the way I would have. 'Cause if Fran\u00e7oise had tacked on half a million Euros with me there, I would have torn the hinges off the door getting out of there.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Lily: It really wasn't that bad.",
        "Carly: I know I've been talking a lot about a lot of money, but sheesh.",
        "Lily: Its okay, I promise you.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right. Well, you're the money. I'm the fragrance. So no arguments from me. Wow. Thank you.",
        "Lily: For doing my job?",
        "Carly: Yeah, and being up front with me about the finances. When I was in business with Craig, I didn't really know what was going on, obviously.",
        "Lily: We're in this together, Carly.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, I hate to cut this short, but I -- I have to go. There's something I need to do.",
        "Lily: Okay. No problem.",
        "Carly: Oh, hey, um -- you're being honest with me, so I, uh -- I ought to be honest with you.",
        "Lily: What about?",
        "Carly: This thing that I have to do. Um, I have to go meet Molly.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Carly: I'm making a wedding dress, and she wants me to help pick something out for the rehearsal dinner.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Carly: Do you feel weird about that or uncomfortable at all?",
        "Lily: Carly, she's your cousin. It would be weird if you weren't involved in this.",
        "Carly: So you're okay with it?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Carly: Well, I have been in your position once or twice. I was nowhere near as graceful. [Laughs]",
        "Lily: Nothing's gonna change it. I mean, I have to face it. Holden's not my husband anymore. He's never coming back to me. So I just have to point myself forward and never, ever look back.",
        "Carly: Does that work?",
        "Lily: I don't know. It does for my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Holden has a phone, you know.",
        "Lucinda: Am I making you uncomfortable?",
        "Gabriel: No. No, but you sure are trying hard.",
        "Lucinda: I'm just -- I'm just trying to put the pieces together. That's all. And your conniving father managed to engineer somehow a huge payoff from the insurance company after the fire.",
        "Gabriel: So?",
        "Lucinda: And you certainly managed to get a sizable chunk of that from him. And yet here you are, toiling under the summer sun for minimum wage.",
        "Gabriel: Craig offered me money.",
        "Lucinda: As expected.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. I turned him down.",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Gabriel: Because I'm not for sale.",
        "Lucinda: [Chuckles] Since when? Although I -- I really am surprised that you take so little interest in your father's business dealings now, when you think there was a time when there was nothing that interested you more. And yet now that he's thriving, you don't seem --",
        "Gabriel: Okay, what is it you want to hear from me?",
        "Lucinda: What is Craig up to?",
        "Gabriel: How the hell should I know, okay? I don't work for Craig. I didn't take his money, and I don't care about his job, okay?!",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Gabriel: No, no, no. Wait a minute. What is it with you?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, me? Clarify.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. Why do you get such a kick out of hurting people? Just because you can?",
        "Lucinda: I never hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it.",
        "Gabriel: What about, uh -- what about Lily?",
        "Lucinda: Now, what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Gabriel: Nothing. I just see you guys fighting a lot. I'm just wondering, did you ever do anything to hurt her?",
        "Lucinda: Why are you asking?",
        "Gabriel: Well, you're always coming down hard on Craig for being such a lousy father, such a lousy person. I'm just trying to figure out who you are.",
        "Lucinda: Would you just be kind enough to tell Holden that I stopped by and I need to talk to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Are you like one of those people that reads the obituaries and then heads to the dead person's address to see if she can buy up their real estate?",
        "Iris: Oh, dear heavens. Is Barbara passed on?",
        "Gwen: Come on, Mom. Save the act for somebody who hasn't seen it 2,000 times.",
        "Iris: You think I'm acting here?",
        "Gwen: I know you wouldn't be here if you didn't know Barbara was missing. You heard that, and you jumped on the fastest thing smoking. You talked your way into this room, and if we hadn't come back, you would have moved on from Barbara's perfume to her jewelry.",
        "Iris: [Scoffs] I am so misunderstood.",
        "Gwen: You are so full of it. You have five seconds to tell us what you want. Okay. Will, call security.",
        "Iris: All right, all right, all right. Maybe I did see something posted on your wall, Gwennie, about Barbara getting in touch with you.",
        "Will: I knew it.",
        "Iris: Look, I did not come back to Oakdale to take advantage of the situation.",
        "Gwen: [Scoffs] Yeah, right.",
        "Iris: I came back to offer my assistance.",
        "Gwen: You want to assist us? You can walk out of here and never come back again.",
        "Iris: Look, I made a lot of mistakes, I know, but God knows I paid the price for all of them.",
        "Gwen: What price? Did you end up in prison? Because that's where you belonged.",
        "Iris: Not prison, but I -- I did end up in jail.",
        "Gwen: Oh, good. What'd you do?",
        "Iris: Well, after I left here, I -- I lost all of Barbara's money.",
        "Gwen: That's not surprising.",
        "Iris: Yeah. I thought I was set for life. And instead, I ended up in some drunk tank in Indianapolis. Do you want to know something, Gwennie?",
        "Gwen: Hmm?",
        "Iris: Sometimes it's at the bottom of a barrel where a light above shines brightest. Amen. You know me, Gwennie. You know that when I make mistakes, I run, and I keep on running. Well, why would I come back?",
        "Gwen: 'Cause you thought you'd hit the lottery again?",
        "Iris: No, because I've changed.",
        "Gwen: Again?",
        "Iris: Yes. I -- I've turned myself over to a higher power, and I've been clean and sober ever since.",
        "Gwen: You do know I've heard this before, right?",
        "Iris: Please believe me this time, okay? And one of the reasons why, um, it's very important for me to help you find Barbara is that I have a down payment on all the money that she gave to me, and I want to give it to her in person, and I want to make amends. But now that I heard that she's disappeared, just my luck, huh?",
        "Gwen: Because everything is about you.",
        "Iris: Why can't you give me any credit? Look, I'm trying to do a good deed here. I mean -- [Voice breaking] First, Barbara's gone, and now my kids -- they don't even forgive me.",
        "Will: Is that my mother's handkerchief, too?",
        "Iris: I don't understand why you're treating me like this!",
        "Gwen: Mom, this isn't about you, okay? We are in the middle of a crisis, and the last thing that we need right now is you coming in here and try to run some stupid scam.",
        "Iris: No, I swear, I was trying to pay Barbara back!",
        "Will: Well, that's fine. You want to leave the money with me? I'll make sure she gets it.",
        "Iris: Can't I even hold my grandbaby for just one minute? I mean, she's -- she's all I have left of Cole since he's been locked up.",
        "Will: Cole has nothing to do with her life. She is ours, and I don't want you anywhere near her. Goodbye.",
        "[Iris sighs]",
        "Hallie: Grandma, stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Uh, Molly, hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I was in a business meeting with Li -- ly.",
        "Molly: Honey, its okay. I'm not gonna lose it every time you mention her name.",
        "Carly: Wow. You two are so grown up about this.",
        "Molly: What does that mean?",
        "Carly: Well, she doesn't mind if I talk about you, and you don't mind if I talk about her.",
        "Molly: That's a shift.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I don't know when it happened or how it happened, but Lily is moving on.",
        "Molly: Yeah. That's what she says.",
        "Carly: No, I could tell she meant it.",
        "Molly: I don't care if she didn't. It wouldn't matter to me, because things are so great with Holden, and nothing is ever gonna change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why are you still hung up on your ex-wife?",
        "Holden: I'm not.",
        "Craig: Then why don't you tell me why you're so indignant that Lily and I become close?",
        "Holden: Close?",
        "Craig: Well, \"Closer\" would be more accurate.",
        "Holden: So what are you saying, that there is something going on between you two?",
        "Craig: A gentlemen never tells.",
        "Holden: There are no gentlemen at this table. There's just you and me -- a guy who's going to pound you into the ground if you don't tell me what I need to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mother, I am so happy to see you. Mwah!",
        "Lucinda: [Laughs] Honey, well, it's good to see you so happy and smiling.",
        "Lily: Ask me why.",
        "Lucinda: Is there a man involved?",
        "Lily: No. But I have great news. I've done it -- well, actually, Carly and I have done it.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. You're talking about the business venture.",
        "Lily: Yes. I closed the deal to buy Fran\u00e7oise Pacaud's perfume factory in France. Carlisle Fragrances has a new home.",
        "Lucinda: Really?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I suppose you think I should be thanking you for making the introduction, but I closed the deal all on my own.",
        "Lucinda: I bet you that Fran\u00e7oise drove a hard bargain.",
        "Lily: You could say that. She's not easily intimidated.",
        "Lucinda: I -- I remember.",
        "Lily: Is that why the two of you stopped doing business?",
        "Lucinda: Mm, in part.",
        "Lily: Well, I intend to make it work. With Carly's creative genius and my financial savvy, we can't lose.",
        "Lucinda: I -- I suppose not.",
        "Lily: I know so.",
        "Lucinda: And to think you did this all on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I'm actually really glad that you're in business with Lily.",
        "Carly: Oh, you are? Really? What's in it for you?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Molly: Lily with a project is Lily not obsessing about my fianc\u00e9, and that's all good for me.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Well, then, it's very good for you, because she's very much focused on this project. And it turns out that she is good in a crisis.",
        "Molly: You guys have already had a crisis?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Well, she was in a blackout in an airport motel room alone, and she still managed to close the deal on our factory in France.",
        "Molly: Alone? I think I like this blue dress. I might try --",
        "Carly: Wait a minute? What -- what is that? You know something. What is it?",
        "Molly: No, I don't. I don't know anything about anything, really.",
        "Carly: Oh, Molly, I'm not buying it. Spill, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: This is a picture of your mommy when she was your age.",
        "Gwen: Um, we were just about to give Hallie some dinner.",
        "Will: Yeah. Why don't you take her down to the lounge, and I'll make sure Iris gets on a bus?",
        "Iris: You want me to leave already?",
        "Hallie: Grandma, stay, so Daddy won't be sad.",
        "Iris: Oh, you are so precious. You've noticed how sad your daddy seems, haven't you?",
        "Gwen: Don't you dare.",
        "Iris: Well, I'm not your Grandma Barbara, but I am your Grandma Iris, and I would be happy to have dinner with you. Would you like that? Yeah?",
        "Gwen: Come here, Hallie. Come here. Come on.",
        "Will: After you, Iris.",
        "[Iris sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I don't have any details, Carly. You know, I know this is not my color --",
        "Carly: Ooh, you must know something good or you wouldn't keep trying to change the subject.",
        "Molly: How would I possibly know about anything that's going on with Lily?",
        "Carly: Because Holden found out and he told you, and now you're gonna tell me. Who was Lily with in New York? I didn't know she was even seeing anybody.",
        "Molly: She isn't -- I mean, as far as I know.",
        "Carly: Molly, just tell me. I'm just gonna call Holden and ask him myself.",
        "Molly: All right. Lily was in New York with Craig.",
        "Carly: Craig Montgomery Craig? They're -- [Carly laughs] No way. No, they're not.",
        "Molly: No, I don't know. I doubt it.",
        "Carly: With Craig?!",
        "Molly: No. I mean, well, it's probably not a big deal. Holden just said that Lily and Craig were in New York at the same time. They ran into each other. There was a blackout and a strike at the airport.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. No, I know all that. And?",
        "Molly: And they were stranded, so they ended up spending the night in the same airport motel. End of story. Oh. Lily didn't mention a word of that to you?",
        "Carly: No. No, she didn't mention a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Even though you despise me, you have to admit, when it comes to ex- wives, I know a thing or two. I've had so many.",
        "Holden: What is going on between you and Lily?",
        "Craig: Now, you see, that's what I'm talking about. You have to stop injecting yourself into her life. You must deal with life one wife at a time.",
        "Holden: Craig, I'm not gonna ask you again.",
        "Craig: Lily is doing amazingly well. She loves her new work and quite frankly is thriving without you in and out of her life every 30 seconds.",
        "Holden: And where do you fit in?",
        "Craig: Nowhere and with nobody. Such is my fate.",
        "Holden: I know you're up to something.",
        "Craig: And what could that be? What am I doing that could possibly be so wrong?",
        "Holden: I don't know. But whatever it is, leave Lily out of it.",
        "Craig: All right. I'll keep my distance from her --",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Craig: -- If and when she asks me to.",
        "Holden: I said leave her alone.",
        "Craig: Well, fortunately, that's not your call to make. Next time, at least buy me a cup of coffee. I feel so used.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: The purchase of the factory and -- and all that, I didn't do it alone, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey. Oh, Honey, I just -- I'm just so relieved. Oh, I was hoping -- all right, sit down. Tell me. Tell me all about it.",
        "Lily: There's nothing really to tell. I mean, I -- I'm just saying that Carly is the creative force behind the project.",
        "Lucinda: Carly is?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm so lucky to have a partner like that who will listen to my suggestions, who will give me excellent business advice.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, Carly does that for you?",
        "Lily: Well, I mean, you know, Mother. This isn't the first company that Carly's been involved in.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, come now, Darling. Come on. Give yourself some credit. Give credit where credit is due. Francoise is a very tough negotiator, and -- and you had to be very clever handling her to get what you wanted.",
        "Lily: The only handling Fran\u00e7oise responds to is cash. But I was lucky. I had access to the funds I needed to close the deal.",
        "Lucinda: And what resources did you use?",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter. I'm just so excited about this.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lily: It's come about at exactly the right time. It's exactly what I needed right now.",
        "Lucinda: I just haven't seen you so enthusiastic about anything for a long time.",
        "Lily: I am. I'm really happy about this.",
        "Lucinda: You sound surprised.",
        "Lily: Well, I mean, when I first started this project, it was just for distraction, a way to put Holden and Molly in my rearview mirror.",
        "Lucinda: And now it's more than that.",
        "Lily: Yeah. It's given me a way to express myself other than, you know, somebody's mother or an ex-wife or --",
        "Lucinda: Or a daughter.",
        "Lily: The process of conceptualizing the product, of securing the factory, of -- of designing the marketing, it's -- it's given me focus, you know? It's really given me a purpose in my life.",
        "Lucinda: I can see that.",
        "Lily: You know, for the first time in a long time, I can actually say I'm proud of myself.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lily: Don't be snide, Mother. I hope you can be proud of me, too.",
        "Lucinda: Lily -- Lily, I'm always proud of you. Never forget that. I'm always proud of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I went out to the cabin to see how your summer job was coming along, and I noticed you weren't there, so I --",
        "Gabriel: So you thought that I quit?",
        "Craig: No. I noticed the wet paint, so I figured you were taking a break. What are those?",
        "Gabriel: Liberty said something about her mom liking French doors, so I thought I'd draw up some plans and see if Jack wanted to add it to the job.",
        "Craig: That's very industrious. So, how are things with Liberty?",
        "Gabriel: Well, she's got her own summer job, you know, so I don't see her that much.",
        "Craig: Lives do get busy. You know, Gabriel, you are destined for greater things.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. Maybe I'll get to winterize a six-room cabin next.",
        "Craig: You've got more potential than that. You won't have to be doing back- breaking work for the rest of your life.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I like this, 'cause, I don't know, I feel like I've done something at the end of the day. I like that feeling.",
        "Craig: Well, there's more than one way to get that feeling. Might be time for you to start considering your other opportunities.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, like what?",
        "Craig: Well, I wouldn't want you to renege on your job. You need to finish what you started. But once you're done with the cabin, I'd like you come work for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: And here comes a plane pulling into the landing!",
        "Gwen: We don't like Hallie to play with her food.",
        "Iris: Oh, but look. She almost finished everything on her plate. So now it's time for dessert. How about a big hot-fudge sundae, huh?",
        "Gwen: Mom, she can't eat a big dessert like that. We'll just get her a little scoop of ice cream or something.",
        "Iris: Oh, but sundaes are so pretty, and you and Will can help her finish it. Come on, Gwennie. It's what the kid wants.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me for a second.",
        "Iris: Where are you going?",
        "Gwen: I'll be right back.",
        "Iris: Ah, Gwennie, you got to be a pretty rotten kid to call the cops on your own mama. Did it ever occur to you that if you turn me in, it's the same as selling Will's mom right up the river with me? She's involved with that baby- selling deal, too.",
        "Gwen: No. They won't prosecute Barbara. I'll explain everything.",
        "Iris: Yeah? So will I. And I promise you, if you send me to prison, you're dragging Barbara up that river with me.",
        "Gwen: You've actually thought about this?",
        "Iris: It's what I do. Now, I want you to listen to what I have to say, Gwennie, okay? That sweet little daughter of yours -- she's gonna run out of grannies if you make that phone call. And that is gonna be one hell of a conversation you're gonna have with her when she asks you what happened to her Grandma Barbara and her Grandma Iris.",
        "Gwen: And what happens if I don't call the cops?",
        "Iris: We just have a lovely visit.",
        "Gwen: Somehow you knew that Will and I would be in Oakdale with Hallie, and you knew that Barbara was missing, and you came here to get something. What?",
        "Iris: To make amends, like I said.",
        "Gwen: What do you want, Mom?",
        "Iris: Why don't you believe me?",
        "Gwen: Because I know you. So you have two choices. Either I go over to that front desk and I use their phone to turn you in to the police or you can walk out of here on your own.",
        "Iris: Oh, Gwennie, you don't want to do that.",
        "Gwen: Get out of here, Mom!",
        "Iris: Now? I haven't even said goodbye to Hallie. That could scar her for life. What kind of a mother are you?!",
        "Gwen: Okay. But that's it. No more stories about me as a kid. No more promises of the good times that you're gonna have. You go back in there, you say goodbye, and then you get your butt to the nearest bus station, and you leave us alone. I don't ever want to see you again. Are we clear?",
        "Iris: Crystal. I can help you with your life. I can make things easier for you.",
        "Gwen: You're right. You can, with one word -- \"Goodbye.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Start with this. We'll see what works. What are you waiting for?",
        "Molly: Tell me why this thing with Lily's bothering you so much.",
        "Carly: It's not.",
        "Molly: Yeah, that's what Holden said. But I still wish he hadn't found out about it.",
        "Carly: Why? I thought things were going really well with you and Holden.",
        "Molly: They are. But you know how the Snyder men feel about Craig. Holden doesn't want Craig anywhere near Lily and the kids.",
        "Carly: I don't blame him. Jack feels the same way.",
        "Molly: Well, if you want Lily to have a successful business with you, find a nice, safe guy, and live happily ever after --",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. Far away from you and Holden?",
        "Molly: No. She can live close by. Be nice if she kept her distance though.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Molly -- he loves you.",
        "Molly: You know, I just don't want to worry about her. The less he worries about Lily, the less he thinks about Lily as someone he has to worry about, you know?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. Try that on.",
        "Molly: Are you jealous?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Of Lily and Craig? No way. I can't even stand being in the same room with that man.",
        "Molly: Uh-huh. Then why are you letting it get to you?",
        "Carly: Because I'm standing here, and I'm trying to convince myself that it was just an innocent coincidence that my new, perfect business partner and my old, lying, bottom-feeding ex-business partner just happened to be in the same city, in the same blackout, in the same cheesy motel.",
        "Molly: But you don't believe it?",
        "Carly: What's weird is that I've seen and spoken to them both, and they didn't say anything about it, neither one of them.",
        "Molly: Maybe because it's not important.",
        "Carly: Maybe because it was.",
        "Molly: Mm, why don't you just forget that I said anything? Coincidences do happen, Carly.",
        "Carly: Sure they do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Did you mean that, Mother, that you've always been proud of me?",
        "Lucinda: Apparently, I have never said that nearly enough.",
        "Lily: It's not your fault I'm so insecure. I've had a rough couple of years.",
        "Lucinda: It pleases me deeply that you have found the satisfaction in this business venture and on top of it that it's made you feel so good about yourself.",
        "Lily: Thank you, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Of course, you know -- [Lucinda clears throat] -- This is just one venture. This is one business. Now that you know that you can handle a successful proposition like this, I mean, you could -- you could handle, start businesses anywhere in the world, any field, anytime.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Lily: I don't need to worry about that. I'm quite happy with Carlisle Fragrances. I love it.",
        "Lucinda: I can see that. I -- I really can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Are you ever going to give me a chance to prove myself to you?",
        "Gabriel: How are you gonna do that?",
        "Craig: Well, if you come to work for me, you'll spend time with me every day. You'll -- you'll get to know me.",
        "Gabriel: I already tried that, and it really messed me up watching you lie to Carly, stealing Parker's money.",
        "Craig: Okay, well, that was a special circumstance.",
        "Gabriel: Even though you won't admit it, we both know you burned down your own building.",
        "Craig: You know, I've done a lot of soul-searching since then.",
        "Gabriel: No, but you're still the same guy. That's the thing. You're the same guy, the guy who slept with my mom when you were married to someone else. You walked away from her. You never even thought about her, not even once.",
        "Craig: You know that Lucinda Walsh is the one to blame for that.",
        "Gabriel: Right. Did she impregnate my mom? Should I call her dad?",
        "Craig: She's the reason I never knew you existed. She's the reason that you grew up feeling alone and -- and rejected when you didn't have to! And if I ever have the chance to pay her -- I'm sorry. It just gets to me sometimes.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. You really hate her, don't you?",
        "Craig: Hate's a useless emotion, especially when you realize that things that go around eventually come back around.",
        "Gabriel: I guess.",
        "Craig: All right, look, no pressure on this, but do us both a favor and at least consider coming to work for me.",
        "Gabriel: I just don't think it's such a good idea.",
        "Craig: My company's really starting to take off. And who knows? Maybe Liberty Ciccone might enjoy dating a guy with a platinum card. Could be worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: [Laughs] Again, please.",
        "Holden: Didn't I do it right the first time?",
        "Molly: I'm just trying to make sure you are who I think you are.",
        "Holden: Marry me.",
        "Molly: Yeah. You're my guy, all right. Mm.",
        "Holden: How'd the, uh, dress hunt go? You buy anything?",
        "Molly: I have a couple things I want you to look at and see what you think. The problem is, I'm trying to decide whether to go bridal or sexy. I think I know what you would say. Hey. Where'd you go? Am I boring you to death, or is there something wrong?",
        "Holden: No. Everything's perfect. So is my bride to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Some things have to be said in person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Well, I -- I guess it's time for me to leave. But I have something that I want to give to you both -- something -- something that I've been holding on to for a long time. This book -- it's basically saved my life.",
        "Will: How nice.",
        "Gwen: What's that?",
        "Iris: It's the down payment for Barbara.",
        "Will: That was for real? You're really paying her back?",
        "Iris: I was divinely guided. I am gonna continue to pray for Barbara for her to come home soon, safe and sound. And would you please do me a favor and please give that to her for me?",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Iris: Is that it? That's all you got to say?",
        "Will: Do you want a ride to the bus?",
        "Iris: No, thank you. Well, goodbye. Oh, my sweetheart. You are so sweet and beautiful, inside and out, just like your mama was. God bless. [Smooches]",
        "Gwen: I know she's a liar. I know I can't believe anything she says, but --",
        "Will: You want to believe her?",
        "Gwen: She's my mom, and that means something to me. I just wish it meant something to her. Come on, Hallie. Come on. Let's go upstairs, okay?",
        "Will: Want me to give Hallie her bath?",
        "Gwen: No. I think we should pack.",
        "Will: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: We need to get out of here.",
        "Will: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Gwen: My mom -- she left too fast. I think she'll come back.",
        "Will: Even after we threatened to call the cops?",
        "Gwen: That won't scare her for long, Will. She came back to Oakdale because she wants something. And whatever it is -- she doesn't have it yet.",
        "Will: Okay, but I don't know where we're gonna go. There's no other hotel around, and I'm not taking the two of you to the Wagon Wheel.",
        "Gwen: Maybe we could find someplace in Chicago.",
        "Will: I want to stay closer than that in case there's any word on Mom.",
        "Gwen: But someplace close that's safer. I think we should stay with your brother.",
        "Will: You want to stay with Paul and Emily?",
        "Gwen: I don't want to, but I think we should take them up on their offer and stay at Fairwinds until we find your mom.",
        "Will: Okay. I'll call them right now. But try not to worry. I really think we've seen the last of Iris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Is this the Wagon Wheel Motel? Yeah, I need a room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Uh, no, Fran\u00e7oise. What?! No, I can't speak any louder. Look, I want to pick up the pace of the plan, all right? Uh, if -- if my daughter is going to be hurt, you were right about that. Uh -- I don't want the agony to be prolonged. The sooner it's over, the sooner she'll have -- she'll have a chance to heal and move on. Uh -- oh. Craig Montgomery? The sooner he's ruined, the sooner the better. Isn't that the point of all of this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: What do you think?",
        "Holden: You look like a million bucks.",
        "Molly: [Laughs] I was hoping you'd say that. Help me with my zipper?",
        "Holden: You and Carly both have excellent tastes.",
        "Molly: Oh, we had a really good time together. We talked a lot.",
        "Holden: About the wedding?",
        "Molly: Yeah, and about Lily.",
        "Holden: What about her?",
        "Molly: Just that, you know, it's good that she's working with Carly and just got this new friendship going with Craig. She's really carving out a new life for herself. And that can only be good for everybody, right?",
        "Holden: Right. I just want her to be happy. You're so beautiful.",
        "Molly: So are you. Hey. Are you still with me?",
        "Holden: Forever.",

        "Jack: What brings you to little old Oakdale?",
        "Carly: You wanted to make me think that you and Lily spent the night together.",
        "Lily: It's real. It's happening. You are marrying Molly.",
        "Craig: Lily deserves to be fulfilled -- in every way.",
        "Lucinda: I'm warning you. You stay away from her. Sierra!"
