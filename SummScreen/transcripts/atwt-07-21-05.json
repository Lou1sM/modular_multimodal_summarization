        "At the Luther's corners church Jennifer's family and friends mourn the loss of little John Dustin Kasnoff. Gwen arrives at the church just before the end of the service to support Will and because she felt she should be at the funeral. At the hospital Rosanna's suspicions about Craig grow when Bob informs her that Craig didn't show up for the funeral of his baby even though Jennifer invited him. Rosanna wonders why Craig was so eager to see their adoptive baby instead of going to his biological son's funeral. Later Rosanna's suspicions about Craig are confirmed when she looks at the baby's foot print from the hospital and she notices it isn't the same picture the nurse who mysteriously quit her job in the middle of her shift showed her the day her baby was born."

        "Luke: You better duck when you tell her that.",
        "Lily: It's on the desk. I've been doing a lot of research on relaxation techniques, visual therapy. It's supposed to enhance the immune system.",
        "Luke: Is Grandma supposed to chant?",

        "Barbara: Hi, honey.",
        "Paul: Come on in. Did you talk to Jennifer?",
        "Barbara: Yeah. She doesn't want to go with me to the church. I was hoping I could ride with you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's fine. I gotta call the florist.",

        "Barbara: And a spray. I can't call Hal.",

        "Will: I don't want it.",
        "Celia: Will, I'm so sorry.",
        "Will: It's weird. After the stuff with Gwen and then my sister, I feel like I've aged ten years overnight.",

        "Minister: I've spoken with Mrs. Kasnoff. I understand it's a difficult time. Is she with you?",
        "Mike: She's on her way.",
        "Minister: We discussed the service briefly and I've talked to her parents, but is there anything you'd like to say?",

        "Jennifer: I will.",
        "Minister: If it's all right, I'd like you two seated alone in the first pew. The immediate family will be seated directly behind you, and other family and friends are welcome to sit where they wish.",
        "Mike: Are you okay with that?",
        "Minister: I know God has tested you both in these last few days. But I'll do everything I can to honor the memory of your son today.",

        "Minister: I'd like to go over some of your requests for the service if you're up to it.",
        "Mike: Why don't I go outside and greet people as they come in?",

        "Katie: I had to come. I had to make sure you were okay.",
        "Mike: This isn't a very good idea.",
        "Katie: I know. Being here feels wrong. But not being here feels worse.",
        "Mike: Maybe you should go.",
        "Katie: Is that what you want?",
        "Mike: It's better.",
        "Katie: Okay. If you don't mind, though, I mean I won't go in or anything, but I just need a minute to say a little prayer for my nephew. I loved him, too.",

        "Celia: What does it look like?",
        "Gwen: It looks like your taste in guys shot up 1,000 points. So where is the party? C'mon, you guys are seriously overdressed for this place.",
        "Celia: We're going to a funeral.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry.",
        "Will: It's for my nephew. My sister had her baby the same night you had yours.",
        "Celia: He was premature, too.",
        "Gwen: It's twisted. I did everything wrong and my kid's fine. And your sister lost hers. I gotta get out of here.",
        "Celia: Gwen, wait. Come with us.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I'm not good at the whole death thing. Besides, I've got too much to do.",
        "Celia: Well, if you change your mind, it's at the church in Luther's Corners.",
        "Gwen: I won't. I'll see you guys around.",
        "Will: Bye. Celia, why'd you ask her to go to the funeral with us?",
        "Celia: I don't know. Gwen always acts like she's so tough, but she's got nobody, Will. It's sad.",
        "Will: You can't always make people happy. I learned that the hard way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Emily is coming to the church. That's the end of this discussion. Thank you.",
        "Barbara: So, what was it, Em? The Suzy Homemaker years, being a wife to Hal, being a mother to Will, Daniel, and Parker, the \"my three sons\" fantasy come true?",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, are you lecturing me on marriage?",
        "Barbara: No, darling. Etiquette.",
        "Paul: That's enough.",
        "Barbara: Hal is in pain.",
        "Emily: I know he's in pain.",
        "Barbara: And yet, he's burying his grandson. And you two are going to flaunt this affair in church?",
        "Paul: You're lucky the church doesn't fall down around you.",
        "Emily: She's right. Maybe I shouldn't go.",
        "Paul: What she did to Hal was much worse.",
        "Barbara: I didn't have an affair with a man he considered his son.",
        "Emily: I don't want to make this day any harder for Jennifer.",
        "Paul: How could this day possibly -- I'm, sorry, but how could this day be any harder for Jennifer?",
        "Barbara: Jennifer is torn up with grief. And if she wasn't so despondent, she would never approve of you two. This is disgusting beyond measures.",
        "Paul: Okay that's enough -- look, everybody is sick over losing this baby. And I don't know how I'm gonna get through this day. But I know one thing, I know that -- I know two things. I know I want Emily with me. And I know that I need Emily with me. So that is where she will be. You -- live with it.",

        "Kim: Mike, I'm so sorry for your loss, dear.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Hal: Honey, do you need some water? Anything? You okay?",
        "Jennifer: I'm fine, I'm fine. Dad, I might need your help a little bit later.",
        "Hal: Sure, anything.",
        "Jennifer: Could you keep an eye on Craig when he gets here?",
        "Hal: What's that bum doing coming here?",
        "Jennifer: I asked him to come.",
        "Mike: You what?",
        "Jennifer: He's the baby's biological father. He has a right to say good-bye.",
        "Bob: Jennifer, are you sure?",
        "Jennifer: Craig loved this baby. In his own way, he did. And I just -- I want to let go of all this pain and move on, and I want that for all of us.",
        "Hal: I'll make sure that he and your mother don't get into it.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Kim: Should we sit down?",
        "Hal: I'll be sitting right behind you.",
        "Mike: Why didn't you tell me about Craig?",
        "Jennifer: I didn't know I had to run by you.",
        "Mike: It just would have helped to know what to expect.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's the thing about life, Mike. You never know what to expect.",

        "Rosanna: Craig, will you help me with this?",
        "Craig: Oh, okay.",
        "Nurse Jacobs: You came at a perfect time. He just woke up from his nap.",
        "Rosanna: Is there someone already in the unit?",
        "Nurse Jacobs: No, why?",
        "Rosanna: There's a woman's ring here.",
        "Nurse Jacobs: That's my fault. It belongs to Nurse Thompson. Lucky girl, off living the life of luxury.",
        "Rosanna: And she left her jewelry behind?",
        "Nurse Jacobs: It's costume, I think.",
        "Craig: Well come on, now. We're not here for the lost and found. We're here to see our son.",
        "Nurse Jacobs: I need you to scrub at least three minutes with the antiseptic soap.",

        "Lily: All right, that's enough. Please.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, he's got a point. Impressing you is a bonus.",

        "Keith: Well, I guess I should go.",
        "Lily: I'll walk you out.",

        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Lucinda: Well, how do I look? Don't answer that.",
        "Luke: Well, you're completely wireless with full access to your office and I set you up with a new browser. 'Cause your old one wasn't working too well.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful.",
        "Holden: Come on, sit down. Doctor's orders.",

        "Lily: Hey, why sugarcoat it?",
        "Keith: All right, well, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Lily: Good. Stubborn is good. My mother gets stubborn.",
        "Keith: Well, good. Then I have that in common with her. And it's just a question of time before I win her over. So, if you need me, call me.",
        "Lily: I will.",
        "Meg: Do you think that's smart to do in front of Lucinda?",
        "Lily: Well, I wasn't doing anything in front of my mother, but if I were, it really is none of your business.",
        "Meg: Lily, you could date axe murderers for all I care, but when it upsets my patient -- it becomes my business.",

        "Dusty: You went in for the kill, Katie.",
        "Katie: It wasn't like that.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's alone. Her baby's dead. You got Mike. How was it?",

        "Craig: Is it safe to unhook the monitors?",
        "Nurse Jacobs: They're a precaution at this point. And I'll be in the unit the whole time. He's doing beautifully. Aren't you, little angel? So, who would like to be the first to hold him?",
        "Craig: Oh, I think that honor belongs to his mother.",

        "Minister: This is a day of deep and conflicting emotions. Sadness at the passing of a beloved baby boy, and joy in knowing he is resting in the arms of God. John Dustin Kasnoff lived a perfect life. It was a life of innocence. It was a life of love. It was a life not touched by sin. He never knew a lie or a deception. He never knew anger or envy. His life was pure. He knew only light. He never knew darkness. A newborn is the personification of God's love. And in his brief life, John Dustin knew great love. Love from his father, and love from his mother. It's very clear from all of us gathered here that he has touched the lives of many in a unique and powerful way, as only the innocent can. No words of comfort can erase the pain of this loss. Jennifer, Michael -- I pray that you find comfort in each other. Be kind to each other. Care for each other. And reach out to those who have helped you through this difficult time. Let them sustain you. Know in your hearts that you were given a gift in the life of this child. Through the years, your memory of him will never fade and the love you have for him today will only grow in your hearts and be with you always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You came into our lives at the perfect time. Your mom and I couldn't ask for anything more. Are you ready to meet the most incredible Mama a guy could have? You ready? You ready, Mama?",

        "Both: Ask her!",
        "Gwen: Still no secrets?",
        "Will: My family's built from secrets.",
        "Gwen: My kid's living here. The parents who are going to adopt him, they're raising him right her in Oakdale.",
        "Bob: Well, I know that he personally was invited by her. Even asked if he wanted to say a few words.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. That can't be.",

        "Minister: I ask that we keep John Dustin's parents in our prayers and ask the lord our savior to watch over them as he receives this child into the kingdom of heaven, where he will have eternal life. Amen.",
        "All: Amen.",
        "Minister: And now Jennifer has a few words she'd like to say.",
        "Jennifer: My son -- my son was a miracle. I understand now what it is to want everything for your child. To want to protect him, to keep him safe, even if -- and how it feels when no matter what you do, you just can't.",
        "Paul: Shh. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I want you to finish for me, please.",
        "Paul: I named him John because it means \"God's gift,\" and he was a gift. His name honors another little boy who went before him -- a son our mother lost. He's named Dustin for the man who brought him into this world. Oh, boy. I want my baby's life to count for something more than the sadness we feel today. I want those of us who loved him to try and heal old wounds that still haunt us, to live without bitterness. And now, I'd like John Dustin's biological father, Craig Montgomery, to come forward and say a few words.",

        "Rosanna: He seems so content.",
        "Craig: Well, he's safe in your arms.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, look, he's trying to kick his way out of the blanket.",
        "Craig: Five toes, all accounted for.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, look at that.",
        "Craig: Here, let me, let me. I don't think he'll be borrowing my shoes anytime too soon.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I should hope not.",
        "Craig: Look.",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Craig: A little crease in his foot there.",

        "Hal: I got another postcard from Danny.",
        "Emily: You did?",
        "Hal: From camp. I sent him one of those care packages full of junk food. You can never take it for granted. Not your kids, not anything, for one damn minute.",

        "Hal: I'm not your charity case, Emily. Don't keep your boyfriend waiting.",

        "Paul: I think its best that he didn't.",
        "Paul: Can I drive you home?",

        "Gwen: Sorry, that was a rotten thing to say.",
        "Will: So why are you here?",
        "Gwen: Beats me. Being here just felt right.",
        "Will: You don't know Jen, you didn't know the baby.",
        "Gwen: No, but a cool guy told me that friends show up for each other. So I figured I'd give it a try.",

        "Meg: Well, I finally convinced your mother to go upstairs and get some rest.",
        "Lily: The good deeds never end.",
        "Meg: Meaning?",
        "Lily: Okay, we have to get something straight. You -- you have to stay out of my personal life, okay?",
        "Meg: Look, I have nothing against Keith. I just want Lucinda's energy focused on healing.",
        "Lily: And Keith is preventing that?",
        "Meg: He's not helping.",
        "Lily: My mother is angry that he's alive. So do you have any other advice?",
        "Meg: Look, I'm not the enemy here, Lily.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but you have all the answers.",
        "Meg: No, not even close.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you do. For me, for my mother --",
        "Meg: You know, maybe you're just used to getting what you want.",
        "Lily: Oh, so you're jealous.",
        "Meg: Of what?",
        "Lily: You've always been jealous since day one. Since the day --",
        "Meg: You know, drop the princess act, Lily. Not impressed.",
        "Holden: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Both: Ask her.",
        "Holden: Can we just try to keep it down? Your mother is trying to sleep.",
        "Meg: Fine. I have to go to the pharmacy and pick up some 'scrips anyway.",
        "Holden: What was that all about?",
        "Lily: Oh, I just let her get to me, that's all.",
        "Holden: Meg or your mother?",
        "Lily: Both. I mean, Keith came by. He wanted to do something nice for my mother. He brings flowers.",
        "Holden: Lily, I know that this is difficult. I know you want to make a go of it with Keith. But if spending time with him gets in the way of your mother getting better -- I know you. You'll never be able to forgive yourself.",

        "Henry: Here you go, sweetheart. Drown your sorrows.",

        "Henry: Yeah, well, that's the buzz.",
        "Katie: Do you still have this town wired?",
        "Henry: Bars and limos, baby, bars and limos. They're the best places to get the dirt.",
        "Katie: It's kind of true.",
        "Henry: What, are we looking to Dusty for the truth now? Come on.",
        "Katie: Mike and I were together in Chicago.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, okay. Now, spare me the visuals on that, all right?",
        "Katie: So Jen found out.",
        "Henry: And then, what, went into premature labor?",
        "Katie: No. She went to her mother's cabin and fell off a chair or something.",
        "Henry: Did you pull the chair out from underneath her?",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Henry: Did you trip her?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Henry: Did you cause her bodily harm?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Henry: Then how, please tell me, how it is your fault?",
        "Katie: You know how.",
        "Henry: What? Why, because you lied to yourself about being over Mike? Because you tried to make it work with me? Because you convinced yourself that you and Mike and Jen could all be friends?",
        "Katie: No, because I slept with a pregnant woman's husband. Get it, Henry? I'm a rat.",

        "Gwen: I know my kid didn't die, but he's kind of gone, too. Maybe I should have held him when I had the chance.",
        "Will: So go back. Tell them you changed your mind.",
        "Gwen: No, it's too late. That kid will know six languages by the time I figure out English.",
        "Will: Gwen, its okay to miss him.",
        "Gwen: Who said I miss him?",
        "Will: Maybe you can get his parents to send you some pictures.",
        "Gwen: No. I had them put it in the contract -- no contact.",
        "Will: Well, a good lawyer can fix that.",
        "Gwen: Forget it. Being here just made me think about him. No big deal.",
        "Will: But what if you change your mind?",
        "Gwen: I won't. You still good at secrets?",
        "Will: My family's built for secrets.",
        "Gwen: This is a pretty good secret. My kid's living here. The parents who are gonna adopt him, they're raising him here in Oakdale.",
        "Will: You're sure?",

        "Rosanna: Pardon?",
        "Bob: Well, there was a service for Jennifer's baby.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. Well, I'm sure that he didn't want to upset Jennifer.",
        "Bob: Well, I know that he personally was invited by her. Even asked if he wanted to say a few words.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. That can't be.",
        "Bob: Well, I -- I was surprised that she asked him to come. But she was surprised that he didn't show up. Maybe this is a healthy way for her to handle her anger.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sure it is.",
        "Bob: Well, it was a lovely service. But burying a child is just about the worst thing that can happen to anybody. I'm sure that nobody will blame him for staying away.",

There's something that I want to say, and need to say it, so I'm gonna say it. I was a little bit afraid this morning, all right? Not about dying, and not even about the cancer. I was afraid and worried that I wouldn't be me. For example, I wouldn't be able to be your mother anymore.",
        "Lily: You'll always be my mother. You know that.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't know. The way things are heading. I don't want us to be like that. I don't want us to remember ourselves like that. And I see where it's going, and my point is, that it is not the job of you two kids to take care of me.",

        "Lily: Yes, of course I do. You know that.",
