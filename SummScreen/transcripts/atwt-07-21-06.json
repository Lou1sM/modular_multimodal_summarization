        "Will: All I'm talking about is giving Jade some of the trust fund money, so that she can have a place of her own. Someplace, not a roach motel. You're okay with that, right? You were all about her having a decent place.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, no I was. I am.",
        "Will: So, come on Gwen. If some money falls into our laps, what's wrong with using some of it to help out a friend?",
        "Gwen: You know, when you put it like that, nothing.",
        "Will: Okay, so stop stalling and tell me what Maddie said to you outside. Because, you know, you went out there, you talked to her, you come back in, and you look like that.",
        "Gwen: Well, it's hard to see her like that. You know? She's having a rough time.",
        "Will: Right and she's got no use of Jade. So, when she saw Jade hug me after I told her about the money, I don't know what went through her mixed-up head, but it's obviously got you suspicious.",
        "Gwen: Actually, I was a long way from suspicious until you started answering questions I didn't even ask. So, what's got you on the defense, Will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lia: The way you've been acting, it's no wonder why Casey is running the other way. So roll over, Maddie. You are dead to him.",
        "Maddie: That's not true. You don't know Casey at all.",
        "Lia: Yeah, well, I know this. He crossed you off his playlist. Don't worry. He will be anything but lonely 'cause he's got me now. And we're breaking into the country club pool tonight.",
        "Maddie: You're what?",
        "Lia: We thought we'd go skinny dipping. And after that, who knows?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No, no, no! There has to be some mistake. Just let me call my bank.",
        "Bartender: Do you have another card?",
        "Carly: No. I'm afraid they are all from the same maxed-out deck.",
        "Bartender: Well, there's a cash machine in the lobby.",
        "Carly: Not much chance of a payoff there, either.",
        "Bartender: Perhaps Mrs. Grimaldi can be of assistance.",
        "Carly: No, no! There's no reason to get Lisa involved in this, is there?",
        "Bartender: Sorry ma'am. She's the owner. If a customer can't pay, we must contact her immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why don't you have a seat? Can I get you anything? Coffee? Aspirin?",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Well, here's the run-down. You're gonna be arraigned by a judge. And you're gonna be charged with driving under the influence, and given your blood alcohol level, you are looking at extreme DUI.",
        "Luke: Whatever, I'm just worried about my mom. Can you go check to see how she is?",
        "Jack: Sure, I'll call the hospital.",
        "Damian: Not to worry, my boy. Not to worry, my boy. I've hired a lawyer, what you call a heavy hitter. I'll get you out of this. How are you, Luke?",
        "Luke: How do you think? My mom's in the hospital, having a tough time with the baby and I go and get into stupid trouble. Who needs that?",
        "Damian: Don't be so hard on yourself, all right?",
        "Luke: I know I messed up. I wouldn't blame my dad if he never spoke to me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: A man's got to do what a man's got to do.",
        "Simon: Well, that's a very good attitude, Michael.",
        "Mike: And I've just got to do this.",
        "[Mike punches Simon]",
        "Katie: Mike! What are you doing?",
        "Mike: Just letting Simon know where I stand.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, my friend, that's a habit you're gonna want to break.",
        "Mike: Well, pay attention -- it won't have to happen again, will it?",
        "Katie: What is going on? What are you doing here, Simon?",
        "Mike: Your ex is marking his territory.",
        "Simon: No, not -- although I do love what you've done with the place. Katie, I'm here to tell you that I'm staying in town. I wanted you to hear it from me before you heard it from anyone else, that's it.",
        "Katie: Well, that's a little too late. I just talked to Carly at the Lakeview. She told me about your little scam -- offering to invest in her business. Simon, come on!",
        "Simon: What is it with you guys and thinking I'm trying to scam? This is no scam.",
        "Mike: Everything you do is a scam.",
        "Simon: I offered her a business deal. That's all.",
        "Mike: Business deals require cash. And without that girlfriend you had on board ship, I don't know where you're gonna come up with it.",
        "Simon: All right then, so I guess this is where I bring you up to speed, right? I struck oil.",
        "[Mike scoffs]",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Simon: You heard me. Black gold. I'm rolling in it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'm sorry if I'm defensive, but why was Maddie narcing on us when there was nothing to narc on?",
        "Gwen: She just overreacted.",
        "Will: Which is what she does lately. You know how weird she's been.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, her problems are a lot worse than I thought.",
        "Will: And we don't need her making problems for us.",
        "Gwen: I didn't really, you know, believe what she said anyways.",
        "Will: So, what'd she say?",
        "Gwen: You know what would have been nice, Will? It would have been nice if you would've talked to me before offering her the money.",
        "Will: You were the one that was stressing about her not having a place to live. And you didn't buy what she said about having money saved.",
        "Gwen: Well, yeah, for sure not enough for first and last and a security deposit, no.",
        "Will: Right. So I stepped up, I did us all a favor. Now she'll have a place to live and we don't have to worry about her being homeless. You would've been okay with that until you talked to Maddie and she messed it up.",
        "Gwen: Maddie didn't have anything to do with it. I just thought the two of us would've talk before making any kind of financial decision.",
        "Will: But you would have said yes, anyway.",
        "Gwen: You know what? You're right. It's none of my business, you know, getting into it with you about the money. It's yours. It's your trust fund. You can do whatever you want with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Wow, Casey must be really hard up if he's wasting time with you.",
        "Lia: Yeah? Well, maybe Casey wants a girl who doesn't go postal every ten minutes. [Cell phone rings] Hey, Baby, where's my guy?",
        "Casey: At the country club, but I'm really not sure about this.",
        "Lia: Well, I'm on my way there. Don't peel anything off until I get there.",
        "Casey: Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. This idea of breaking into the club -- -let's just forget about it.",
        "Lia: Why? It's getting me hot just thinking about it. I will see you in a few.",
        "Casey: No, no, Lia, wait, don't hang up.",
        "Lia: Oh and just so you know, there's no hard feelings Daddy already ordered me a new Beemer. Bye!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: If you have money, it's because you cleaned Vienna out.",
        "Simon: Vienna, yeah -- oh, no, no, Vienna is chump change compared to what I'm now worth.",
        "Katie: Oh, really? Well, don't stop there. Do tell us more.",
        "Simon: Oh, okay. Well, after you sold my sheep farm in Australia, I scraped enough money to buy it back. Long story short, the well ran dry. So I started digging a new one and instead of water, I struck oil. Lots of oil -- blah, blah, blah, here I am. Life changes in an instant, doesn't it?",
        "Katie: So here you are in the famous millionaire's playground, Oakdale.",
        "Simon: Well, why not? I've got to start investing somewhere, why not here? I've already put the word out to Lucinda Walsh. So, we'll see.",
        "Katie: You and Lucinda, business partners? Oh, that I have to see.",
        "Simon: All right, what's it gonna take for you to believe that I'm just a simple, innocent businessman now here in the great land to try my luck?",
        "Mike: You know, you're so full of it --",
        "Katie: Simon, I know you're lying. Because if you had really struck it rich, you would've use that to get to me on the cruise ship. And you didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Kevin begged me to keep her busy while he did his thing. And Ada, she had all these refreshments and --",
        "Damian: So you took a drink.",
        "Luke: I took more than one. You know, Ada jumping me -- that's one thing. Close your eyes, enough vodka can get you through anything. Or not. But it was more than that.",
        "Damian: Tell me.",
        "Luke: I was with this girl who I didn't want. And I felt totally alone, like a total outsider. Kevin doesn't know a damn thing about me or who I am. And none of my friends do. It's all a lie. And it builds up so much that I just want to scream -- \"I'm gay. This is who I am.\" But I can't. So I just keep up the act. And it makes me sick.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry. I hate to see you so unhappy.",
        "Luke: It gets so bad sometimes that I just want to live anywhere but here, 1,000 miles away, where I know nobody. And there is nobody to disappoint.",
        "Lyle: I'm Lyle Brennan.",
        "Damian: Mr. Brennan, thank you for getting here so early. I'm Damian Grimaldi. This young man is my son, Luke.",
        "Lyle: Luke, it's not much fun, is it? Well, we're gonna work on getting you out of here, all right? Mr. Grimaldi, I'd like a few minutes alone with the boy before we head over to court.",
        "Damian: Of course. Luke, I'll be right outside, okay?",
        "Jack: Holden called. Lily's stable and the baby's fine.",
        "Damian: Oh, thank God. I'll pass the good news on to Luke.",
        "Jack: No, Holden will do that. He's on his way here now. He wants to be here for the arraignment. Can you just make sure that Luke stays put until his dad gets here?",
        "Damian: Of course. Naturally, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I just can't believe that I'm over my limit. Well, that far over. Would you check again, please? Yes, certainly, I understand. Well, I'll be down in the morning to straighten everything out. Thank you.",
        "Lisa: So, along time ago, my grandmother told me that a lady should always have 30 cents in her purse. Let's see, that was 10 cents to go to the movies, 10 cents to get home and 10 cents for mad money. And I told her she was way behind the times. That was not nearly enough money for me then and it's certainly not enough for us now.",
        "Carly: I know. I'm so sorry, Lisa. I had no idea that this credit card was maxed out.",
        "Lisa: No big deal, it's just a bottle of champagne.",
        "Carly: Your best bottle of champagne.",
        "Lisa: Well, I just guess we just better drink it up then. I mean, it's very difficult to put a cork back in a champagne bottle, right? Honey, I'll be glad to take a personal check.",
        "Carly: There's a problem there. You see, I don't happen to have any cash in my bank account, right now, at the present time. You see, I've been living off my credit cards, just while I'm trying to get my new business up and running.",
        "Lisa: Carly, I don't understand, why are you just living off your -- off plastic? I mean, I know you and Jack are separated, but doesn't he -- surely he pays spousal support.",
        "Carly: No, no, Lisa, this is my problem. Not Jack's!",
        "[Jack steps into the room and hears this]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: How can you act like the trust is my money? You're my wife. My partner. It's ours, okay? And you're right. I probably should've asked you before I offered any of it to Jade.",
        "Gwen: Look, I didn't care about the money to begin with. That's still how I feel. But money does things to people. You know, like those lottery winners who get all messed up. And you know, end up in jail -- forget about their families. I don't want that to happen to us.",
        "Will: You mean broke, toothless and selling our sad story to \"The Intruder\" for a case of beer?",
        "Gwen: Come on, you know what I mean. Money changes people. And I don't want it to change us.",
        "Will: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Gwen: Promise?",
        "Will: Yeah, I swear on this. Nothing ever gonna come between us -- for sure not money. From now on, any decisions we make about money, it's gonna be a joint decision, okay? And if you don't want me to give Jade any money then --",
        "Gwen: No, come on, I didn't say that.",
        "Will: I just want to be fair, okay? And if you have any problem with Jade getting the money, then I'll just tell her to forget it.",
        "Gwen: Who do you think you're fooling? Come on. You're not that mean and neither am I. So, I just want us to be honest. No more, \"I was gonna tell you's\" or \"I didn't think it was important\" or \"I forgot\" or you're gonna end up sleeping on the couch.",
        "Will: I hear you.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: So, don't you have something to tell me?",
        "Gwen: Nope, I don't think so.",
        "Will: What did Maddie say to do about me and Jade?",
        "Gwen: She said that she saw you guys in each other's arms. And that when you saw her, you jumped apart. Like you were guilty or something.",
        "Will: Is that all she said?",
        "Gwen: Pretty much.",
        "Will: Right, that's what I figured. Which is why I officially wanted to set your mind at ease, you know, once and for all.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Tell me, do I have any reason to be worried about you and Jade?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lia: Come on, Casey! We got the whole club to ourselves. Let's make the most of it. [She sees it's Maddie on Casey's cell phone and hangs up on her] Maddie. Get lost.",
        "Casey: Hey, was that my phone?",
        "Lia: No, it was mine. But there will be no phone call interruptions on this perfect night. Hey, you know what would feel really good right now? A nice, hot steamy shower.",
        "Casey: The locker rooms are closed.",
        "Lia: So we go break in, get some soap, I'll do your back, and you can do whatever you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Holden, I'm glad you could make it. Luke will be happy, too.",
        "Holden: Where is he?",
        "Damian: Upstairs.",
        "Holden: In the arraignment?",
        "Damian: Is over. Luke will be down as soon as he's processed. And he was so happy to hear the good news about Lily.",
        "Holden: Jack got you the message that I wanted to be here for the arraignment, and yet you find another way to cut me out of Luke's life.",
        "Damian: Not so. Look, the gentleman who just left is Luke's lawyer, Lyle Brennan.",
        "Holden: Why would they hire a lawyer without talking to me first?",
        "Damian: Well, you weren't here. Naturally I wanted Luke to be well- represented. And Mr. Brennan had other clients so, we had to proceed without you.",
        "Holden: I see. So everything worked out just how you wanted it.",
        "Damian: I volunteered to take Luke to the police station so that you could attend to your wife.",
        "Holden: You have been trying to drive a wedge between me and my son ever since you came back to Oakdale.",
        "Damian: That's absurd.",
        "Holden: No, what's absurd is you buying him that sports car and giving him all that money that you have been giving him. Then you allow him to go to some party where he gets drunk -- he crashes his car. You show up here playing superdad. It couldn't work out more perfectly, could it, Damian? It's exactly what you have been angling for.",
        "Damian: I love the boy.",
        "Holden: You know what, that's enough! This has to stop. I don't what you do, I don't care where you go, I want you to stay away from my wife and I want you to stay away from my kids.",
        "Luke: Dad, lay off Damian. He is so not the problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, what are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Lisa called me. Hi, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Hi.",
        "Carly: Something about a cash shortfall and an unpaid bottle of champagne?",
        "Lisa: Well, the bubbly's on the house. But I got concerned when the bartender told me he had to cut the card up.",
        "Carly: Lisa, why don't you say that a little bit louder? Because I think there's somebody in the lobby who maybe didn't hear it.",
        "Lisa: I'm very sorry, Honey, but it seems that you're having a cash flow problem, so I called Jack.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm very sorry, Jack, that you wasted your time with a trip over here. I don't need your help.",
        "Jack: No?",
        "Carly: Absolutely not.",
        "Jack: Oh. Okay. Well then , maybe you could loan me 20. I'm a little short. Just until payday.",
        "Carly: Here was the rule when we separated. You would provide support for the children. And you've done that and you've been generous. Beyond that, I am not your responsibility. Lisa was very wrong to call you and you were wrong to come running over here over something as simple and silly as --",
        "Lisa: A $300 bottle of champagne. Carly likes the best.",
        "Carly: Whatever. The point is that I am going to find a way to pay for it on my own.",
        "Jack: Okay, Carly, why don't we get real for a second? Between the empty bank accounts and the maxed out credit cards, you need some help.",
        "Carly: Not from you.",
        "Jack: Look, my sole deal here is to make sure you're taken care of because you're the mother of my kids. I'm sorry, Lisa. Hey, listen, thanks for offering to foot the bill, but I am gonna take care of this tab, and then you and I, maybe we should go someplace and have a little talk.",
        "Carly: No. No, Jack! I'm not gonna do that. You are not my husband anymore. I don't need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How is it you neglected to mention that you had struck oil and oh, also, planned on moving back to Oakdale when we were on the cruise ship?",
        "Simon: Because it had nothing to do with you.",
        "Katie: So you just picked a random small town to live in, and it just happened to be mine.",
        "Simon: Wow, you really are convinced that everything I do is all about you, aren't you?",
        "Mike: You think so? You tried to keep Katie captive on a deserted island knowing you were sitting on a golf course. And look how Vienna just suddenly disappeared now that Katie's back in your life. And not to mention all the other times --",
        "Simon: You know what, Mike, apart from a fairly suspect right hook, you've got a very vivid imagination.",
        "Mike: For good reason. You're a con man. Your only interest in doing business with Carly is to get closer to Katie.",
        "Simon: Ah. Got me. 'Cause I got nothing else better to do. You got me all figured out, haven't you?",
        "Mike: I do. Just in time. I'm gonna call Jack, have him run a little check on you. If it turns out of your money came from Vienna's little diamond collection, I'll make sure he runs you straight back to that little sheep farm that you're so fond of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: Telling lies. They don't feel good. I know that there's no way that you'd ever lie to me again.",
        "Katie: I don't want to have to run into you around town and have to make chit chat and all of that. I just can't do it. You owe me that, please.",
        "Carly: I appreciate you coming to my rescue, but you don't have to do it anymore.",
        "Lia: I am going to take a long, hot, steamy shower with or without you.",
        "Casey: Lia, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: So this is what it's come to, huh? You know what, I really did just stop by to tell you my plans. Just so you wouldn't think I had any secret agenda.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't think you have him convinced.",
        "Simon: Who, Mike? Oh, well, yeah, can't win them all.",
        "Katie: He's too smart to fall for your games.",
        "Simon: Yeah. He is smart, isn't he? Very punchy. Oh, not to mention, obviously extremely good with his hands. You know what, jackpot. You got it all.",
        "Katie: I do have it all. A wonderful husband, a wonderful life -- you can have a life for yourself too here, if that's what you want. But just please stay away from me and Mike and my family and friends. I don't want to have to run into you around town and make chit-chat and all of that. [Door opens] I just can't do that, okay. You owe me that. Please. Did you get a hold of Jack?",
        "Mike: Voice mail. I asked Jack to run a little background check on Simon here.",
        "Simon: Good. That's good news. 'Cause whatever background check he runs, I'm sure it's only going to confirm my story.",
        "Katie: Yeah, whatever. Listen, whatever you have planned here, if it does include me, just back off, okay? Mike and I are solid. Our love is solid. There's no way you can break us up. And as for Carly, please stay away from her too, okay? Back off. Is that clear?",
        "Simon: Crystal.",
        "Katie: I rushed home as soon as Carly told me that Simon was back.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry it got rough.",
        "Katie: I'm not. At least he knows where we both stand now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly, don't be ridiculous.",
        "Carly: More with the compliments.",
        "Jack: Here, Lisa, this should be enough to cover the tab -- with tip.",
        "Carly: Lisa, do not -- I repeat, do not touch that money.",
        "Lisa: Okay -- I think I'm going to leave the two of you alone for a few minutes, and how about that?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why can't you just let me pay?",
        "Carly: Because, Jack. I have to pay on my own. At least that's what I will try to do.",
        "Jack: What are you trying to prove, here? Am I supposed to feel guilty because you won't let me help you?",
        "Carly: I don't know, Jack. Feel however you feel. This is about me making a commitment to myself -- to get by without taking a handout.",
        "Jack: Carly, nobody does it all on their own.",
        "Carly: Well, I have to. And I can do it.",
        "Jack: Well, just because you can doesn't mean you have to.",
        "Carly: Jack, if I let you bail me out every time I hit a rough patch, I will never stand on my own. So, I appreciate you coming to my rescue, but you don't have to do it anymore.",
        "Jack: And what about the unpaid bar bill?",
        "Carly: Lisa? So, I'm ready to take care of that bill now, okay?",
        "Lisa: Oh, why don't we just wipe the slate clean? As I said, it really is just a simple --",
        "Carly: No. No, no. No handouts from you either. I am ready to work that bar tab off.",
        "Lisa: In the name of all the saints above, doing what?",

        "Gwen: What kind of hug?",
        "Will: Are you serious? It was a like a thank you hug. A generic hug, a nothing hug.",
        "Gwen: Nothing like the power hugs that you give me?",
        "Will: No, not even close.",
        "Gwen: Or the tickle hugs? Or the hugs that turn into something else kind of hugs?",
        "Will: Definitely not.",
        "Gwen: That's what I thought.",
        "Will: Excuse me?",

        "Will: So then, what's with all the questions?",
        "Gwen: You're the one who made the big deal about what Maddie said. I was just trying to clear the air. Make sure there was no hug malfunction.",
        "Will: Well, I hope that you meant it when you said you believe me. Because I'd hate for this Jade thing to be hanging over us.",
        "Gwen: No way, no how. And believing you? We've done lies. They don't feel good. I know there's no way you would ever lie to me again.",

        "Lia: Why?",

        "Lia: Come on. We just got here.",
        "Casey: I know, but you know what, there's probably a guard here, getting ready to make the rounds.",
        "Lia: So? Doesn't that just make it more exciting?",

        "Luke: What? Dad, that's crazy.",
        "Holden: No. I don't know what he's been telling you, but I know this -- I miss you, and I want you home. I've always wanted you with us, even though I haven't always said that. And I get this feeling that he's telling you something different, that I don't want you around. And if that's the case, then I want you turn around and ask him why he's been lying to you.",
        "Luke: Look, Dad. Damian never led me to believe you didn't want me around. You did that all yourself.",
        "Holden: Luke, you're wrong.",
        "Luke: No, Dad. It happened the day Mom fell in the coma. I think we all remember that, right? It began right after I sneaked into her hospital room.",
        "Holden: I told you that I didn't hold you responsible that.",
        "Luke: Yeah, you told me that. But when I was going to leave, and I wanted to say goodbye to her, I knew at that minute that my prayers weren't wanted. You didn't want me holding her hand, or talking to her, or try to pull her out of it because you blamed me for what happened to Mom and you wanted me gone. So don't, Dad. Don't even put this on Damian because this is all on you.",

        "Gwen: I know Maddie's got a lot of stuff going on, but I can't help being ticked at her for making a big deal about you and Jade.",
        "Will: So I say forget about Maddie. It's not like we don't have a great future ahead of us. I'm acing summer school, and I get my diploma. And we'll go to college. And we'll meet between classes. Then on the way home, we can stop at the grocery store so we can cook dinner in our very own house. Then we can share the last strand of spaghetti lady-and-the-tramp-style.",
        "[Will laughing]",
        "Gwen: Let me guess, you're the tramp.",
        "Will: Then we can watch TV and study together and think about how lucky we are. And how we have everything. I don't think we should let anything get in the way of that, ever.",
        "Gwen: You're right, we have too much to look forward to. I have an idea, we should stop at the store on the way home and pick up spaghetti fixings and eat dinner in bed. What do you say, Tramp?",
        "Will: Woof.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'll stop at the store and meet you at home. Don't be long.",

        "Casey: Lia, you're making way too much of this --",
        "Lia: No, you are. Maybe you're thinking about loser-girl Maddie. But, I mean if she's the one who you want to be with --",
        "Casey: I wasn't even thinking about her.",
        "Lia: Okay, so what is the problem? We're here. We're nearly naked. Stop talking and start doing more of this.",

        "Carly: Ahh, so what? I'll just sign a waiver or something. You have a pen?",
        "Lisa: Stop it now. It does not work that way.",
        "Carly: I will not take no for an answer.",
        "Lisa: Okay, look. If you won't let me comp the champagne, then let's just say you owe me, okay?",
        "Carly: No. Lisa -- I have no idea how long it's going to take for me to get my business off the ground, and I don't want a debt hanging over my head. Just come on! Let me wash the dishes to pay for the champagne.",

        "Holden: Luke, please. The last thing I would ever want is for you to feel unwanted. I made a mistake that day at the hospital. I should have asked you to stay. And if I did, maybe Mom would've heard more of your voice and maybe she'd be awake by now. That mistake does not change how I feel. I want you home.",
        "Luke: Well, I'll try to come by more.",
        "Holden: No, don't come by. Come home. I want to help you with your legal problems. And the drinking. If that was a cry for help last night, I heard it. And help that I'm offering is not the kind of help you're going to get from Damian. Sport cars are not the answer here. So, please come home with me. We'll stop by and see your mom on the way.",
        "Luke: Look, Dad -- I'm so sorry about the drinking. I know, we were stupid, especially with my kidney. And I never should have gotten behind the wheel of that car. I'm sorry for getting into trouble, and dragging you into it. You and Mom both deserve so much better from me. But right now -- I'm feeling so lost, like I don't know where I belong.",
        "Holden: You belong with your family.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you have so much going on right now, Dad. You have Mom, and the baby, and you have to take care of the girls -- you don't need all my baggage on top of that. So, I mean, I'll still look in on Mom, if that's okay.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, of course it is.",
        "Luke: But I can't come home right now, Dad. I'm sorry.",
        "Damian: That took courage.",
        "Luke: It's funny. The last thing I feel right now is brave. Do you think I was too hard on my dad?",
        "Damian: You spoke your mind and your heart. That's never a bad thing.",
