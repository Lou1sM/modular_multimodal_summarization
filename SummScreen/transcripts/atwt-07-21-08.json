        "Meg and Paul go to Mike for help with Sophie. Mike doesn't know how to help because he knows nothing, but then he off handedly mentions Col and Meg and Paul's interest is piqued. Cole surprises Barbara in her room and holds a gun to her telling her that he has a Plan B. Allison receives a gift from her long lost dad. Cole takes Barbara hostage and is almost caught when their paths cross with Lisa. Aaron convinces Allison to see what he dad sent her; she finds a note that isn't signed and a bracelet. Paul and Meg separately talk to people in Sophie's life and come to the same conclusion that Cole is at the top of their prime suspect list. Cole brings a blindfolded Barbara to his hide out and tries to get her to write a note to Paul wanting $100,000, but she refuses. An increasingly unstable Cole shoots up and then looses it when he confesses to Barbara about how he taught Sophie a lesson by killing her when she lied and disrespected him; Cole acts erratically and continually threatens Barbara. Barbara realizes that Cole is the father of Sophie's baby too. Bob and Susan try to mend fences. Allison and Chris run into one another when they are both out for runs. Meg and Paul know something is seriously wrong when Lisa tells them that she saw Barbara with Cole and they find her room partly ransacked. Barbara decides her only way out of this is to pretend to go along with Cole and write a letter. Cole delivers the letter to where he thinks Paul will be, but he comes across Mike instead and gives it to him. Barbara is able to get herself free and is able to arm herself with a syringe of drugs for when Cole comes back. Barbara tricks Cole and injects the drug into him causing him to lose consciousness. She calls Paul and describes a bit of her surroundings so Mike is able to guess where she is. Aaron finds Chris and Allison having fun running, but he becomes more concerned when Allison almost faints. Cole awakens through and realizes what Barbara did and tries to attack her. Susan tells Bob about Allison's strange gift from her father and how she feels it is a bad omen. She also tells him though that she won't let Chris weasel his way back into Allison's life. Paul and Meg go looking for Barbara where Mike thinks she is and find an empty but ransacked room. Barbara is hiding and comes out when she realizes whom it is. Barbara is admitted to the hospital for observation. Barbara apologizes to Meg. Meg helps Susan out when she goes to fill Barbara's prescription, but she finds trouble waiting instead when Cole shows up with a gun wanting drugs. Cole shoots Meg. Mike sees Cole racing from the hospital and captures him. He then tells Paul the good news who in turn thanks him for all his help. Barbara is happy to hear about news of Cole being caught and is sure their nightmare is over now. However, Meg is lying unconscious in a pool of blood in another hospital room."

        "Meg: Hey, Mike. Can we talk to you?",
        "Mike: That's a great way to start off a day.",
        "Meg: We need your help.",
        "Mike: Why? He's out of jail. He got away with murder.",
        "Paul: I didn't kill Sofie. I don't care if you believe me.",
        "Mike: I don't.",
        "Paul: It's Meg that's in trouble.",
        "Mike: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Meg: The police think I did it, and they have evidence that makes me look pretty bad.",
        "Mike: What evidence?",
        "Meg: It -- it doesn't matter. What matters is that I find a way to clear myself.",
        "Mike: And I can help how?",
        "Meg: You knew Sofie towards the end. Uh, maybe you knew something about her life -- what she was thinking --",
        "Paul: Was she seeing someone? Anything that can help lead us to the real killer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Not so fast, Babs. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I would like to help you out, but I just don't think I can offer you information about Sofie that you don't already know.",
        "Paul: Mike, did she ever mention any other friends? Anyone she was seeing?",
        "Mike: Uh, she was pretty much obsessed with you.",
        "Meg: There was somebody else, Mike. The baby -- Paul wasn't the father.",
        "Mike: And how do you know that?",
        "Meg: The baby wasn't far enough along to be Paul's. Sofie must have found out a way to get the records to say what she wanted them to say. I don't know. Somebody she knew at the hospital. We don't know.",
        "Mike: Hmm -- I don't think so.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Mike: Well, because according to her ex, Sofie didn't have any friends.",
        "Paul: Her ex? What do you mean, her ex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You are even more vile than I thought.",
        "Cole: Now would be a good time for you to shut up!",
        "Barbara: Not just blackmail, huh, but common theft? Give me my jewelry back, Cole!",
        "Cole: No. That jewelry was interest on the 100 grand you still owe me.",
        "Barbara: I owe you nothing.",
        "Cole: Sure, but if you want to keep me from going to the cops and telling them how you killed Sofie --",
        "Barbara: Get out of here.",
        "Cole: Need I remind you of what I saw? You were stoned on morphine. You shot her up with a syringe.",
        "Barbara: And you think the cops are gonna take your word over mine? You, with the sterling character and the unassailable credibility?",
        "Cole: You think you're so smart, don't you?",
        "Barbara: It's not so hard to be smarter than you.",
        "Cole: Well, you aren't. See, just now, you kind of convinced me that going to the cops wouldn't be such a good idea.",
        "Barbara: Excellent.",
        "Cole: Which, uh, means we're gonna go to plan \"B\".",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Mom.",
        "Susan: Hey.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here? I thought you were on duty.",
        "Susan: Well, uh, there was something that I wanted you to know before you started classes today.",
        "Alison: You seem upset.",
        "Susan: No, no. I'm relieved, actually. Uh, Paul fired Rick Decker, so you don't have to see him or deal with him ever again.",
        "Alison: Thank God.",
        "Susan: I'm just sorry you had to go through that.",
        "Alison: Oh, Mom, I know it was no picnic for you, either. But thank you for telling me. I'm good, really.",
        "Susan: Good. There is one more thing. This came for you today.",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Susan: Nothing. It's just -- it's from your father.",
        "Waitress: Hey, Doc. You coming in?",
        "Chris: Uh, I kind of changed my mind. Call me Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When you talked to Cole, where was he?",
        "Mike: I don't know. I -- I called him on his cell phone. I got the number from Sofie's book.",
        "Meg: Had he talked to Sofie?",
        "Mike: I got the impression that he hadn't seen or talked to Sofie since he left town. Look, I wish I could help you. I know you didn't do this. But I don't have anything to give you.",
        "Meg: It's no use. We're never going to find who --",
        "Paul: No, you're wrong. And we're not giving up until we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So, um, you and me -- we're gonna go for a little ride.",
        "Barbara: Where?",
        "Cole: Wherever I want. I'm the one with the gun.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Barbara: Paul --",
        "Cole: Not a sound, or you're a dead woman.",
        "Meg: Can we get a cup of coffee before we talk to your mom?",
        "Paul: Sure. You're not still mad at her?",
        "Meg: What, me hold a grudge because she accused me of murder?",
        "Cole: Move.",
        "Lisa: Oh, hi. Honey, I've been looking -- what in the world are you doing with him?",
        "Barbara: I am so glad to see you.",
        "Cole: Uh -- uh, you two can chat later. I'm sorry. Ms. Ryan and I have some unfinished business to take care of, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I guess this is a little unexpected.",
        "Alison: Unexpected? Uh, yeah. I haven't heard from the man in I don't know how long.",
        "Susan: I know. I debated with myself, uh, whether I should bring it to you. But then I decided it wasn't my decision. However, there is, um, a nice, uh -- oh, trash can right over there if you need it.",
        "Alison: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Aaron: Susan, Susan, sit, sit, sit.",
        "Susan: No, no, no. Sit, sit. I'm going. Hope I did the right thing.",
        "Alison: Bye, Mom.",
        "Aaron: What was that all about?",
        "Alison: Uh -- this is from my father.",
        "Aaron: The guy who fell off the face of the earth?",
        "Alison: Uh, apparently, they have a post office there. My mom says I should just throw it away.",
        "Aaron: Without knowing what's inside?",
        "Alison: Hmm. There's a note. What harm can it do? \"Dear Alison, I heard through the grapevine that you're in nursing school. I wanted you to know that I was proud of you.\" It just stops. What, he didn't know how to sign it? \"Larry,\" \"Dad\"? The man who gave you life --",
        "Aaron: Okay. Maybe your mom was right. Maybe that trash can deal sounds like a pretty good idea.",
        "Alison: No. I mean, I already -- I already opened it, read the note. Might as well check out the merchandise. So, what am I supposed to do with this?",
        "Aaron: Do you like it?",
        "Alison: I guess. I mean, it's not horrible. If I saw it in the store, I -- I might try it on.",
        "Aaron: So try it on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, so let's think about this. Sofie didn't know anybody, she didn't she anybody, but she somehow managed to get pregnant.",
        "Meg: So you think the father was the killer?",
        "Paul: Could be. Why don't we split up and separately try to talk to everybody that Sofie dealt with.",
        "Meg: So we give them another chance to tell us that they don't know anything?",
        "Paul: No. Somebody knows something. Maybe they don't even know that they know something.",
        "Meg: Okay. Well, wait, wait, wait. I thought we were gonna go see your mother. She knows that we're coming.",
        "Paul: Well, let her wait. What else does she have to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Please, can I take this blindfold off? Please.",
        "Cole: Like what I've done with the place.",
        "Barbara: How long have you been in here?",
        "Cole: Hmm. I got an idea. How about, um, you don't ask any more questions and you do what I tell you to do? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You know, I never knew why he just stopped -- caring.",
        "Aaron: Maybe he didn't. Maybe he just stopped writing.",
        "Alison: Well, my mom's theory is he is the reason why I'm so screwed up about men.",
        "Aaron: Do you still think about him a lot?",
        "Alison: I try not to.",
        "Aaron: Meaning you do?",
        "Alison: So, what does it mean if I wear this thing? Well, I guess there's only one way to find out. It looks nice, doesn't it?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, it does.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Hey! Fancy meeting you here.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, not exactly. Your co-workers told me you'd be here. Uh, do you have a minute?",
        "Alison: You know what? He does. I actually -- I'm gonna go run off my nerves. Starting up nursing school again. Hope the, uh, second time's the charm.",
        "Meg: Well, good luck.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Aaron: What's going on?",
        "Meg: I want to talk to you about Sofie.",
        "Aaron: Right. Are you in trouble?",
        "Meg: Yeah, and it could get worse.",
        "Aaron: Okay. What can I do to help?",
        "Meg: Is there anything you could tell me to help figure out what happened to her?",
        "Aaron: You know, it's weird. There's not much I can tell you about Sofie, period. I thought we were friends for awhile. You know, I thought I could get close to her. But she kept a lot inside. And after a while, I just realized I didn't know her at all.",
        "Meg: Yeah. A lot of people felt that way about her.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I mean, when I found out what happened, I wasn't really surprised.",
        "Meg: Really? Why?",
        "Aaron: Sofie doesn't make good choices. You know, she doesn't read people very well.",
        "Meg: Yeah. She's also pretty good at using them. Sorry.",
        "Aaron: No, that's okay. You know, she was -- she was just, uh -- she's a very weak person. And I think that was because, you know, she let herself get abused for so long, over and over again.",
        "Meg: Uh, uh, what? Uh, abused? By whom?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Her ex-boyfriend, Cole Norbeck. Guy's a real jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: So, yeah. Yeah, Sofie had a really rough life.",
        "Paul: She never talked to you about her family or her friends?",
        "Chris: She was pretty much alone except for that jerk that got her pregnant, tried to sell her baby.",
        "Paul: She wasn't a part of that?",
        "Chris: No. She really wanted to keep it. But she was just so under his thumb, like she had no will of her own.",
        "Paul: Did you ever sleep with Sofie?",
        "Chris: You can go now.",
        "Paul: I'm not the baby's father. But we need to find out who is, for Meg's sake.",
        "Chris: I didn't sleep with her, all right? I felt sorry for her. That's it.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Chris: You know, I -- I think Aaron tried to help her, too, but she didn't know how to deal with a guy trying to be nice to her, like -- like after Cole. She was only attracted to creeps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Pen, pen -- where's the damn pen?",
        "Barbara: Why is it you can't put your hands on one? You keep the place in such good order.",
        "Cole: Don't talk to me like that.",
        "Barbara: Talk -- if I talk to you, I'll talk to you seriously, okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah. You know, if it's about the $100,000 that you're gonna find me, then yeah, sure.",
        "Barbara: It's about the $100,000 you're going to lose. You see, Cole, I have cancer.",
        "Cole: We all have something, Lady.",
        "Barbara: Well, my immune system is depleted, and I have to be very careful about where I go, what I'm exposed to, and this place -- this place is very dangerous for me.",
        "Cole: I don't care.",
        "Barbara: Well, you should, because you won't have any cash if I'm dead.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and that's why you're going to do exactly what I tell you to do. So, you don't die and I get rich. There it is. Okay, start writing.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Cole: You're going to tell your son that you want $100,000. Or it won't be the cancer that kills you.",
        "Barbara: Sorry. No.",
        "Cole: What the hell do you mean, no?",
        "Barbara: Surely even you understand a simple negative.",
        "Cole: I just threatened to kill you.",
        "Barbara: Whatever. I am cold. And I am exhausted. And I am wet. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna be stuck in this hole in the ground with the likes of you.",
        "Cole: I'm not joking around, Lady!",
        "Barbara: And neither am I! I am sorry I ever met you. I am sorry I ever tried to do business with you. And I am sorrier still that I spent this time trying to stay alive only to die in this filthy pit with a pathetic loser like you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, hey.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: So, what did you find out?",
        "Paul: All Chris said was that he was pretty sure that Sofie was right under Cole's thumb.",
        "Meg: You know, Aaron said the same thing -- no other friends or connections.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and Chris also said that he's not the father of Sofie's baby.",
        "Meg: Okay. So -- so, do you think it could be Cole?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Mike said that Cole was out of town, pretty much out of touch.",
        "Meg: Well, it's just --",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm gonna get real psychological here, but when a guy abuses a girl like that and he is her whole world, a lot of times, the guy's obsessed with her, too. So, why would he just walk away from a person who -- who thinks he's the center of the universe?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Doesn't make sense. Maybe Cole left because he was in some kind of hot water.",
        "Meg: Okay. Could he have maybe come back when it cooled down?",
        "Paul: I don't know. If he was here long enough to get Sofie pregnant, maybe he was here long enough for someone to see him.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but was anybody looking?",
        "Paul: It's worth thinking about. All right. You ready to face your brand-new, devoted mother-in-law?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Can't wait.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Paul: That's weird. Where do you think she went?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You're making this harder than it has to be.",
        "Barbara: You know what I think? I don't think you've thought this completely through.",
        "Cole: Shut up!",
        "Barbara: I don't think you really know how you're gonna get out of here.",
        "Cole: Shut up!",
        "Barbara: Oh, God.",
        "Cole: You got a real big mouth. You know that, Lady?",
        "Barbara: Well, that certainly explains a lot. How long have you had a drug problem?",
        "Cole: I wouldn't call it a problem. I like it.",
        "Barbara: You need help.",
        "Cole: I need money.",
        "Barbara: If you let me go -- oh!",
        "Cole: I'm not letting you go. You can lie all you want now, because it doesn't bother me now. Nothing bothers me.",
        "Barbara: For how long?",
        "Cole: Long enough for you to write that letter.",
        "Barbara: I already told you, I'm not gonna do that.",
        "Cole: Okay, fine. I'll write it myself. But, um, you are gonna pay, because at this point, I got nothing to lose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: We've been avoiding each other for a while.",
        "Bob: Yeah. Ever since Alison and Chris wound up in court.",
        "Susan: Sorry that got so unpleasant.",
        "Bob: Well, we were certainly on different sides on that issue.",
        "Susan: Yes, but it's understandable that you would support your son no matter what. But to have him resign from the hospital -- I felt for you. That must have hurt.",
        "Bob: Well, not the way I wanted things to turn out.",
        "Susan: I know. You must have had very high hopes when he came back to the hospital. So talented -- one of the best in his field. You must have been thinking that he'd take over for you one of these days.",
        "Bob: Well, that was the plan, but, uh, kids don't always follow the plan.",
        "Susan: God knows mine haven't. But I -- I think Alison is on the right road, finally.",
        "Bob: And she's happy to be back in the nursing program?",
        "Susan: Thrilled. And thank you. But, uh, scared to death that she's gonna blow it, which makes this really odd thing that showed up today seem like a very bad omen.",
        "Bob: What happened?",
        "Susan: Larry. Out of the clear blue, he sends her a present.",
        "Bob: What was it?",
        "Susan: I didn't stick around to find out. You believe it? I took one look at her and saw about 10 years of hurt in her face. And I -- I pretty much handed her the present and I ran. I don't even know if she opened it.",
        "Bob: I take it Alison doesn't hear from her father very often.",
        "Susan: Try never. How could he do that -- just drop out of her life? He's an educated guy. He reads all the literature. He must know how damaging it is for a kid to feel like their father doesn't care enough to -- to even check in once in a while.",
        "Bob: Well, do you think maybe his sending this gift is -- he's trying to change that?",
        "Susan: It's a little late for that. Because of him, she's a very confused young woman who makes very bad choices when it comes to men.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey. I don't mean to hassle you, but you all right?",
        "Alison: What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Chris: Think a body like this is an accident?",
        "Alison: You're running, voluntarily?",
        "Chris: Yeah. I actually like it, you know? And I have a lot more time on my hands, so --",
        "Alison: Yeah. I thought, uh -- you know, I thought running would be a good idea -- a new part of a healthy lifestyle and stuff.",
        "Chris: It is. It's great.",
        "Alison: Yeah. That's because you don't loathe it. As soon as I can move, I'm getting in my car and heading to the first drive-through window I can find.",
        "Chris: Did you warm up at all? Did you -- did you stretch?",
        "Alison: No. I skipped that part.",
        "Chris: Well, let me show you. And if you still don't like running after a proper warm-up, I'll just butt out.",
        "Alison: What, it really makes that much of a difference?",
        "Chris: Yeah. If you warm up, running can, you know, really feel great. But first you need to relieve the tension in your shoulders and, uh, upper body.",
        "Alison: I like tension. It's my friend.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. Good. Well, first, uh, bend down at the waist and let your arms hang down.",
        "Alison: You're making fun of me! I have never seen runners do that.",
        "Chris: Alison, you are so tense. Okay, you need to be loose to get loose. Really, just -- just trust me, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Think she would have called. Hey, Lisa, you seen my mother?",
        "Lisa: Uh, yeah. She -- well, she left just a while ago.",
        "Meg: Left?",
        "Lisa: Yes, with that dreadful Cole person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Where should I tell him to leave the money?",
        "Barbara: You're asking me?",
        "Cole: \"Leave the money in the car.\" Um, \"When you park the car at the entrance.\" I want to go to sleep.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no. I -- I can help you. I can help you, Cole. You know what? A letter's gonna take too long. Why don't we -- why don't we just call Paul?",
        "Cole: I'm high. I'm not stupid. No phones.",
        "Barbara: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Cole: No, you're not. You're trying to trip me up. But you know what? I'm smarter than you. You're just richer. You think you can run the world because you have so much money.",
        "Barbara: No, not at all. I didn't say that. I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: You have all this money. You think that makes you special!",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no!",
        "Cole: You're been talking to me like I'm dirt!",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Cole: And now you're gonna pay. I've been kicked around all my life. People hold out on me, they pay. You understand? They pay.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. They pay!",
        "Cole: Like Sofie. She held out on me, and I made her pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: One of the housekeeping, uh, staff members told me that, uh, Cole had been hanging around for the -- oh, for the last couple of weeks. And he's been harassing all these, uh, people, especially the female people, trying to get free drinks and everything. The only thing I didn't understand was why in the world was Barbara hanging out with him? You know, especially after the baby stuff.",
        "Paul: You're right. What would my mother want to do with Cole?",
        "Meg: Well, maybe she caught him in the act.",
        "Paul: Where the hell did he take her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What do you mean, you made Sofie pay?",
        "Cole: You're so smart, you figure it out.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God. You killed her. They said whoever killed Sofie was a medical professional, but it was --",
        "Cole: Just someone who's good with needles?",
        "Barbara: Why? She couldn't hurt you.",
        "Cole: She didn't do what she was told to do. She didn't pay, and she was using my kid to work your son.",
        "Barbara: She was pregnant with your baby?",
        "Cole: Yeah. She tried to play me. I don't get played.",
        "Barbara: So you killed her and your own baby?",
        "Cole: Yeah. She looked me right in the eye, and she lied to me.",
        "[Cole remembering]",
        "Sofie: I only have $5,000.",
        "Cole: And she thought I'd just take her word for that.",
        "Meg: As a matter of fact, why are you still even here?",
        "Sofie: What are you even talking about?",
        "Meg: Paul paid you $100,000 to start your life over again.",
        "Sofie: Hey, Cole. What are you doing here?",
        "Cole: That's not what you want to really know. You want to know how much I just heard.",
        "Sofie: I -- I was just gonna call you.",
        "Cole: No, you weren't. Just like you weren't gonna tell me about the $100,000.",
        "Sofie: You're right. You weren't even worth the $5,000.",
        "Cole: Stud fee, huh?",
        "Sofie: Severance fee. You're out of my life, and you're out of my baby's.",
        "Cole: My baby, too.",
        "Sofie: You don't even care about the baby! You just care about the drugs.",
        "Cole: Which takes money!",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well, I'm not putting my money up your arm.",
        "Cole: You don't call the shots anymore!",
        "Sofie: Okay, look, Cole, you know, I have heard your empty threats about five or six times. So, you know what? I've finally woken up. I know what a loser you are are. I know what a junkie loser you are.",
        "Cole: Empty threats, huh?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, that's right. I'm calling Paul.",
        "Cole: This isn't empty. You should be a little more careful about who you call a loser.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: And you had all that money, and you --",
        "Cole: Want more? And now that you know how good I am with one of these, maybe you'll be a little bit more cooperative.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay. Whatever you want, I'll do as you want. I'll write it.",
        "Cole: Good.",
        "Barbara: Aren't you forgetting something?",
        "Cole: Hmm?",
        "Barbara: You have to untie me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Well, as a peace offering, this is pretty tasty.",
        "Susan: Least I could do. I heard the other day that, uh, Chris is planning to leave town. Is he gonna look for a position at another hospital?",
        "Bob: No. He's changed his mind about that. He's gonna stick around.",
        "Susan: Oh, really?",
        "Bob: Something wrong with that?",
        "Susan: I just thought that, uh, if he's not gonna be on staff here, he'd want to make a fresh start, after the damage to his reputation.",
        "Bob: Ho, ho! You actually clocked 10 minutes before you got back on his case.",
        "Susan: Can't pretend that I'm crazy about the idea of Alison running into him all the time. They're not a good combo.",
        "Bob: But, you know, he's apologized I don't know how many times. He's done everything he can to make amends.",
        "Susan: That may be, but she's vulnerable, and he's not above playing on it. So, I'm sorry. If I see him looking for any excuse to get back into her life again, I'll do everything in my power to nip that in the bud. Pie's on me. Enjoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: See? You're already more flexible. [Alison chuckles] Uh, now, let's -- mm.",
        "[Chris chuckles]",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Chris: Well, I was just gonna show you, uh, a better hamstring stretch, but, uh --",

        "Cole: No.",

        "Mike: Yeah. He looked like a junkie to me.",

        "Barbara: Paul, Cole took me. He took me.",
        "Paul: Mom, I know.",
