        "Noah: Well, what do you think? It's -- it's pretty lame, huh?",
        "Mason: No. No, I think what you got so far is great. It's very visual, and you managed to do what a lot of young screenwriters have a really hard time doing. You tell a lot of story without too much talk. It's good.",
        "Noah: I've got a long way to go before I even finish the first draft, though.",
        "Mason: Hey, you're off to a great start, Noah.",
        "Noah: I don't know, I wish Luke was here. I mean, he's the real screenwriter.",
        "Mason: Stop it. Stop underestimating yourself. You can do this. I know it.",
        "Noah: Thank you.",
        "Mason: All right.",
        "Luke: Hey. Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.",
        "Noah: Hey, Noah. It's okay.",
        "Luke: Uh, I thought that maybe since you're done with work, you want to hang out. But if you're busy --",
        "Noah: No, no, no. It's okay. My faculty advisor was just helping me get back on top of senior project. Mason Jarvis, this is Luke Snyder, my boyfriend.",
        "Mason: Ah, nice to meet you, Luke.",
        "Luke: You, as well.",
        "Mason: I read your screenplay.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, it didn't exactly get two thumbs up, huh?",
        "Mason: I didn't think that the subject matter was a good fit for Noah right now. But, no, seriously -- for what it's worth, I thought it really showed potential.",
        "Luke: Well, coming from you, that's worth a lot. Noah loves your class. He talks about it all the time.",
        "Mason: Really? Well, I think that your boyfriend has a real future as a filmmaker.",
        "Luke: So do I. I just hope he just remembers to thank me when he wins his first academy award.",
        "Noah: Luke is on a quest to make me an egomaniac.",
        "Luke: Hey, someone has to believe in you.",
        "Mason: You've got good taste. Noah's got talent.",
        "Luke: I know. He does. Well, I guess I will let you guys get back to your work. Um, should I call you later?",
        "Mason: Luke, wait. You know, why don't you join us? Noah and I were just about done. I'd love the chance to get to Noah's other half.",
        "Luke: Okay, thanks. I'll take you up on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Home, sweet home.",
        "Paul: Wow.",
        "Barbara: Now I don't want you exploring too much, because the doctor said that you have to rest. You're supposed to be off your feet.",
        "Paul: I live here?",
        "Barbara: Yes, you live here. And it even has a name. It's called Fairwinds. Ring a bell at all?",
        "Paul: Sounds like a country club. Am I a golfer?",
        "Barbara: Not so much.",
        "Paul: I own this? I'm totally loaded?",
        "Barbara: You are rather well off.",
        "Paul: Great. Mom -- maybe you could tell me something about my father.",
        "Barbara: Have a seat. Your father -- um, your father's name is James Stenbeck.",
        "Paul: Stenbeck.",
        "Barbara: And he died last year.",
        "Paul: Um, I don't have his last name -- am I a bastard?",
        "Barbara: No, that would be your father. Though not in the technical sense.",
        "Paul: Not a nice guy?",
        "Barbara: Not a nice man. In fact, I would say he -- he was a monster. And you should be glad that he's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Dusty, we were supposed to have a meeting this morning. Don't you think it would be wise to discuss your defense?",
        "Dusty: Why? What's the point?",
        "Bonnie: Uh, you're charged for attempted murder, Dusty. You could go to jail for a long time. So why are you acting like this is not some big deal? I mean, I know -- I know, you never intended for anyone to get hurt. But Paul Ryan was seriously injured because of a bomb that you put in that warehouse. He could've been killed -- along with Meg and Damian.",
        "Dusty: Nobody died. Paul's going to be fine.",
        "Bonnie: Which is lucky for you. Look, I've found some evidence to prove that there were extenuating circumstances. I think the jury's going to have to take that into account because of your mental state. But look, we have to be on the same page --",
        "Dusty: Forget it. I've decided to plead guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, none of this would've happened, if Dusty hadn't set that bomb.",
        "Holden: Meg, you could have gotten yourself killed.",
        "Meg: And Eliza could've lost both her parents.",
        "Holden: You know what? Paul, Dusty, Damian -- all of them are bad news, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Meg: Paul was the one that saved our lives.",
        "Holden: Yeah, this time. But what about all the other times when he put you and the baby in danger? You don't owe Paul Ryan a thing. You need to stop being his victim.",
        "Meg: Isn't the victim the person that ends up in the hospital?",
        "Holden: Look, I'm glad he's okay. But that doesn't change the facts --",
        "Meg: Okay, look -- Holden, stop. You don't know the whole story. Paul needed surgery and they found a microchip in his brain.",
        "Holden: Did I really just hear what I think I heard?",
        "Meg: I know, I know it sounds very science fiction. But this little piece of metal -- this thing could have been controlling his behavior for years.",
        "Holden: As far as excuses go, that's very creative, Meg.",
        "Meg: Look, I've always wondered how Paul changed from being the person that I loved, to someone who was obsessive, and paranoid, and dangerous. Maybe this was reason why his brain wasn't working it should have been.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on. Don't tell me you really believe that.",
        "Meg: I believe that if we get help for Paul, the way that he needs it, then he could be the man that he was supposed to be. And we just need to find the right doctor.",
        "Holden: Wait, wait, wait -- you have too many things on your plate. You don't need to be responsible for his recovery.",
        "Meg: I won't be doing it myself.",
        "Holden: Who's going to help you?",
        "Meg: Damian. Look, I was surprised when he made the suggestion, but I really think he's being sincere.",
        "Holden: All he wants is to get on your good side. And if you fall for it, you're crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I've done some research, and I found a neurologist who can help Paul. A specialist in post-traumatic stress and memory loss.",
        "Lily: Since when are you concerned about helping Paul Ryan? He tried to ruin you.",
        "Damian: And Dusty as well. But then Dusty tried to retaliate and I didn't stop him in time, so I have to make up for that.",
        "Lily: By finding Paul a doctor?",
        "Damian: The problem is, the guy is based in New York. And he'll need to get special permission to be able to work at Memorial.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well there's a procedure to get visiting privileges.",
        "Damian: I'm aware of that, but it could take far too long. Paul needs to be evaluated right now. And if there is a treatment, it must begin as soon as possible. Perhaps you can help.",
        "Lily: What would you want me to do?",
        "Damian: Isn't Lucinda on the hospital board?",
        "Lily: Yes. And I'm sure she could expedite this. But let me ask you something first. Are you sure you're going to all this trouble just to help Paul?",
        "Damian: Lily, I already explained to you, I have an obligation to make up --",
        "Lily: You're a liar.",
        "Damian: I am not lying to you, Lily.",
        "Lily: Then you're lying to yourself. Paul Ryan went out of his way to make you liable for millions of dollars. You're not the kind of person to just forgive and forget something like that.",
        "Damian: I'm trying to show I've changed.",
        "Lily: You're trying to show Meg you've changed.",
        "Damian: Look, Meg is suffering right now. The father of her child doesn't recognize anyone in his family, including his own daughter.",
        "Lily: So you think if you help Paul you can get closer to Meg.",
        "Damian: I'm just trying to show Meg that I'm able to do the right thing. Although I wasn't able to stop Dusty from trying to hurt Paul.",
        "Lily: So you're sticking to your story that he's the only one responsible for this?",
        "Damian: I did not want to be involved, Lily. But I couldn't talk him out of planting that bomb.",
        "Lily: I still can't believe he went that far in trying to frame Paul.",
        "Damian: And then Paul saved our lives. So I owe him for that, as well.",
        "Lily: You have a very interesting take on this. Dusty has a much different version, to say the least.",
        "Damian: He's jealous. Meg rejected him and then turned to me as a friend. So Lily, listen -- I am doing a favor for your sister-in-law. Tell me -- are you willing to help me, or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: This crusade to find a miracle cure for Paul, doesn't that sound just a little bit fishy, Meg?",
        "Meg: Well, if it helps Paul, then it will help Eliza. And if Eliza is happy, then it helps me.",
        "Holden: Damian's just trying to change people's minds about him. He started with Luke and Lily, and now he's trying to get to you.",
        "Meg: If Damian is genuinely trying to be a better person, what's the problem?",
        "Holden: You just need to know how he operates. You need to keep your eyes open.",
        "Meg: I am. Look, Paul has done a lot of bad things. And so has Dusty. And Damian has made mistakes. And as far as I can see, there's enough blame to go around.",
        "Holden: That's why you need to stay away from all three of them.",
        "Meg: Look -- right now, I am just trying to get whatever help I can get. And I am grateful to Damian for what he's doing.",
        "Holden: All right. I understand what you're feeling. But what if the three of them go at again, and you're smack in the middle?",
        "Meg: Okay, look -- I know you're trying to protect me. But I promise you, if I run into any kind of problem, the first thing I'm going to do is run straight to my big brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: You know, when the time comes, you should consider going on the festival circuit. If you win a couple of awards, it'll really help you get some financing for your next project.",
        "Noah: Okay. Wait, I've got to write a decent screenplay first. And then I'm just concerned about graduating. The film festivals, they, um, they might have to wait.",
        "Mason: Don't knock it so fast. That's how I got my start. A few years ago, my documentary, screened at Cannes, Florence, Lisbon. It's great, it's how I met my other half.",
        "Noah: That sounds awesome.",
        "Mason: Yeah, it was. The same thing could happen to you two. Let me tell you, walking the red carpet together -- romantic.",
        "Luke: Sounds like a blast. Hey, maybe I can help you write your acceptance speech. You know, it can't all be about Professor Jarvis. There has to be a nice, long section about your incredibly supportive boyfriend.",
        "Mason: Just so you know, it's not Professor Jarvis. It's Mason, please.",
        "Luke: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Mason: Sure.",
        "Luke: I think I'm, uh, embarrassing Noah with all this award talk.",
        "Mason: He should be lucky to have someone who believes in him so much.",
        "Noah: I -- I am. I am lucky, I know it.",
        "Mason: You guys make a great couple. Which reminds me, I have someone waiting for me for dinner. I should get going. Luke, it was nice to meet you.",
        "Luke: Yes, you as well.",
        "Mason: Yeah. Noah, keep up the good work.",
        "Noah: Oh, thanks again.",
        "Mason: I'll see you soon.",
        "Luke: You sounded kind of intimidated by him earlier. But he's a nice guy.",
        "Noah: Yeah, he's okay.",
        "Luke: So, uh, are we going to hit up any of those red carpets anytime soon?",
        "Noah: Don't hold your breath.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Dusty, you would be a total fool to plead guilty.",
        "Dusty: I've made up my mind.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, why? Why? I mean, the jury -- there's a really great chance that the jury is going to be on our side. Look, you were deliberately provoked and you responded. You never intended to cause harm to Paul. I mean, if we play our cards right, Dusty, there's a good chance we might even get a dismissal.",
        "Dusty: That's not going to happen.",
        "Bonnie: Why are you so hell-bent on doing hard time in jail? You're just crazy!",
        "Dusty: Maybe.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. Okay. What if you -- what if you do 10 to 15 for attempted murder? By the time you get out, Johnny's going to be all grown up. Is that what you want, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I don't see him that much, anyway. Craig's in charge of his life. That's not going to change.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, look -- I know you feel like hell right now. But I am too good of a lawyer to stand by and watch you ruin your life, Dusty. I am not letting you plead guilty. There's --",
        "Dusty: Then you're fired. Have a great life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well, look who it is.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "Barbara: No, no. Not at all. I didn't even realize that you know that Paul was out of the hospital.",
        "Meg: How are you doing? How's the progress with your memory?",
        "Paul: Um, great. I don't remember anything.",
        "Barbara: You know, we were just sitting and looking at some family pictures, and nothing was sparking. So, I think he needs one-on-one contact with people who were important to him, okay? See if you can get something going. I'm going to leave you two alone.",
        "Meg: Um, you know, I know you're still recovering. Maybe you should be resting.",
        "Paul: I'd rather stay here and look at you. Feels pretty good to do that.",
        "Paul: I don't understand.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: How I could forget someone so beautiful. You're memorable. We have a kid together, huh?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: How old?",
        "Meg: Seven months.",
        "Paul: And already, she doesn't live here?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: She used to?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Did you and I live here together before the baby was born?",
        "Meg: For a while.",
        "Paul: And how was that?",
        "Meg: Well, that's a hard question.",
        "Paul: You don't want to tell me?",
        "Meg: It was wonderful for a while, in the beginning. We were very much in love. But it wasn't easy. And we tried really hard, but things always went wrong.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I'm not sure exactly what I'm sorry for, but I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: I guess you and I weren't meant to be.",
        "Paul: That's too bad. So, why exactly did we break up?",
        "Meg: Do you really want to know?",
        "Paul: Sure.",
        "Meg: I couldn't trust you, Paul. You were a compulsive liar. You were jealous. You had these terrible mood swings, and when you didn't get your way, you were violent.",
        "Paul: Did I hurt you?",
        "Meg: No, you didn't hurt me physically. But you were out of control in other ways. You were so desperate, you kidnapped our daughter.",
        "Paul: I did that to you? I did that to that little, innocent girl? I did that?",
        "Meg: You did a lot of things I didn't understand.",
        "Paul: I'm a terrible person. Why are you here? Meg, why do you want to have anything to do with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I've got so much work to do for this script. I'm never going to be ready.",
        "Luke: Don't worry. You'll finish it.",
        "Noah: How?",
        "Luke: I'll help you.",
        "Noah: Mason said I've got to write this on my own.",
        "Luke: Okay, well maybe if you bounce some ideas off of me or something.",
        "Noah: Thanks. But I'm just so distracted. I keep getting ahead of myself, like I'm worried about a shooting schedule when I don't even know what it is I'm going to be shooting!",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, don't worry. It'll be fine.",
        "Noah: I hope so, because Mason may seem like a nice guy, but he will flunk me, if I'm not done on time. And then I will not graduate.",
        "Luke: Well, I thought you said that Mason was supportive.",
        "Noah: He is. He likes my ideas. But now I've got to produce.",
        "Luke: Noah, you are going to be great.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad you think so. I wish I was as confident in me as you were.",
        "Luke: Well, you know, I think I have an idea to get your confidence up.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Luke: You've got to stop. Just stop what you're doing. You're stressing yourself out. You can't work like this.",
        "Noah: Okay, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Luke: Take the night off.",
        "Noah: Luke, I've got a deadline!",
        "Luke: It's one night, Noah. And then you can start back up tomorrow refreshed. And you will hit it out of the park.",
        "Noah: I don't know, it sounds great, but --",
        "Luke: Noah, I am taking you out tonight. We're going to go to Metro. We're going kick back, get some sushi, dance a little bit. Trust me, you'll get twice as much done tomorrow, if you just relax tonight.",
        "Noah: All right, I'm convinced.",
        "Luke: You are? How'd I do that?",
        "Noah: Sorry. I don't have time to answer stupid questions. My boyfriend is taking me out on the town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Any luck?",
        "Lily: Yes. She doesn't think it'll be a problem.",
        "Damian: Well, the problem may be getting Dr. Frankel to come to Memorial. His office is telling me he's not taking new patients.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's too bad. So, are we back to the drawing board?",
        "Damian: Not necessarily. I mean, I'm sure if we went to New York, and made a personal plea to the doctor himself, we may be able convince him. Can we take Lucinda's jet? That way, you'll be home in time for dinner.",
        "Lily: You want us to just drop everything and run off to New York.",
        "Damian: It's for a very good cause. I mean, I could go by myself, but I'm sure the good doctor will be unable to say no to you. And think of how relieved Meg will be if Paul recovers and Eliza gets her father back.",
        "Lily: All right, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I fired you. Can't you take a hint?",
        "Bonnie: I'm not letting you fire me.",
        "Dusty: Well, you're not getting paid. So don't bother yourself.",
        "Bonnie: Look, this is not about the money Dusty, and you know it.",
        "Dusty: Then what's it about?",
        "Bonnie: Okay, I know you don't like the way Meg has been treating you. She has hung you out to dry and she has sided with Damian. And you're just angry about that.",
        "Dusty: Meg can do whatever she wants. I don't care.",
        "Bonnie: No, that's what you say, Dusty. But you think she picked the wrong side, and she should've chosen better.",
        "Dusty: I've given up on Meg.",
        "Bonnie: No. No, you want to fight back.",
        "Dusty: Nope, I'm tired of fighting.",
        "Bonnie: What, do you want to ruin your life?",
        "Dusty: It's my life. You don't have a say.",
        "Bonnie: What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Dusty: I don't give a damn anymore!",
        "Bonnie: Well, I do!",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know why I do, but I do. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm not sure why I'm here. I guess I somehow feel responsible.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Meg: If I had recognized this problem, and I got you the right help instead of turning against you, maybe things wouldn't have gotten this far.",
        "Paul: I don't understand.",
        "Meg: The change, it was so extreme. I should have sensed that there was something causing it.",
        "Paul: I had a microchip in my brain, right? How could you know something like that?",
        "Meg: Because the doctors gave me the usual explanations, and I just accepted them. I should have tried harder to get to the bottom of it. I should have looked for the right treatment for you. And maybe then, you wouldn't have done the terrible things that you did.",
        "Paul: Like kidnap your daughter.",
        "Meg: Our daughter.",
        "Paul: Right. So, you're only here because you feel somehow responsible for what happened to me?",
        "Meg: Sort of.",
        "Paul: Oh, well then okay, no -- no problem. I'm fine, I'm okay. You can go.",
        "Meg: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Well, thank you for your concern. But whatever happened, I don't remember. And whatever's going to happen, well it can't have any connection to something that I don't even remember. So, thank you for checking up on me, but I'm be okay. You should go. And you don't ever need to feel like you have to come back.",
        "Meg: It sounds like you're giving me the brush-off.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. It's not that. It's just -- it's -- look, if I'm as bad as you just described, really what you should do is walk out that door and never come back.",
        "Meg: You don't really want me to leave.",
        "Paul: Well, you're very attractive. But there's no reason for you to be here.",
        "Meg: There's a very good reason. I want to help you.",
        "Paul: I don't remember you. I don't. I don't think I'm ever going to remember you.",
        "Meg: Well, you have to try.",
        "Paul: Why? More to the point, why do you want me to go back to being who I was?",
        "Meg: Because I think it'll be different this time. You'll react to things differently, not the way you used to.",
        "Paul: You wanted a divorce, right? And you wanted me out of your life.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Paul: Well, now that can happen.",
        "Meg: No, I'm not going to give up on you. What about our daughter? Don't you want to get to know her? Don't you want to be in her life while she's growing up?",
        "Paul: Not really. I mean, she's very beautiful. But I can't make myself feel things that I don't naturally feel.",
        "Meg: You don't mean that.",
        "Paul: I do. I do. I feel no connection to her. And you can wait around, you know, if you'd like, for something like that to happen, but I don't think it's going to happen. And if I am as bad as everybody says I am, aren't the two of you better off without me?",
        "Meg: Eliza needs her father.",
        "Paul: I don't remember her, and at this age, she's never going to remember me. Now you can go be with somebody who will be better for her.",
        "Meg: How can you give up? I'm not giving up. I want our daughter to have her father in her life. So if you just give this some time --",
        "Paul: Time won't turn me into who you want me to be. Look, if you need money, I can pay you child support. My mommy said that I've got tons of money and I'm willing to share --",
        "Meg: It's not about the money. It's about a little girl who needs the one man in her life who will always love her, no matter what.",
        "Paul: But that's not me. And it never will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What was that for?",
        "Bonnie: It was supposed to be a wake-up call. To snap you out of your pathetic, self-pitying funk.",
        "Dusty: So, it was a mercy kiss?",
        "Bonnie: I mean, I could've hit you upside the head, but I thought you'd enjoy kissing me more.",
        "Dusty: You're wasting your time.",
        "Bonnie: Who says?",
        "Dusty: I do. I'm a mess. You deserve better.",
        "Bonnie: Who says -- who says you always have to come and save the day? You know, why can't the damsel, you know, save the white knight?",
        "Dusty: Because it doesn't work.",
        "Bonnie: It works for me. Come on, I'm all about equal rights. Pretty strong. I can just pull you up on my horse, and we could gallop off into the sunset, no problem.",
        "Dusty: Tempting offer.",
        "Bonnie: Why don't you give in to temptation, Dusty? I can handle it.",
        "Dusty: I'm not sure I can.",
        "Bonnie: Just don't underestimate yourself, okay?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Holden: Dusty. Bad time?",
        "Dusty: No, no. It's fine.",
        "Holden: Hey, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Hey. Good to see you, Holden.",
        "Holden: Am I interrupting?",
        "Dusty: No, you're not. It's okay.",
        "Bonnie: You know, I should go. I should -- take care.",
        "Dusty: Let me guess. This isn't a social visit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Whoa. Don't look now, but there's your faculty advisor.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Do you think that's the significant other he was talking about?",
        "Noah: They do look like a couple.",
        "Luke: Did he tell you he was gay?",
        "Noah: It never really came up.",
        "Luke: Should we go over and talk to them?",
        "Noah: No, whatever they're talking about looks pretty intense. Maybe we should go someplace else.",
        "Luke: Too late. Hi!",
        "Mason: Hi!",
        "Luke: Good to see you again.",
        "Mason: Good to see you two. Hi, join us, please. Please, join us.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Luke: Snyder.",
        "Mason: -- Snyder.",
        "Luke: Hi, it's nice to meet you.",
        "Noah: What's going on?",
        "Luke: Well, um, maybe we should do this at a different time. I mean, if you guys were in the middle of something.",
        "Mason: Actually, we were. Lover's quarrel. I'm sure you two know what that's like. But I, for one, am ready to kiss and make up. George?",
        "George: This is so typical of you, Mason. Bring in a crowd. Let's have a party, pretend nothing's going wrong. I'm not going to put up with this anymore.",
        "Mason: He's usually a lot more social.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I know you're angry at me for what could have happened to your sister, and I don't blame you.",
        "Holden: Luckily, she wasn't hurt.",
        "Dusty: She came too close. So if you want to take a swing at me, go ahead.",
        "Holden: Seems like you're beating yourself up enough. I just want to know the real story.",
        "Dusty: Damian and I devised a plan to put Paul in prison. I planted a bomb at the warehouse. Damian was to show up with the cops in time to turn the bomb off.",
        "Holden: Only it didn't go down that way.",
        "Dusty: Not only did Damian back out of the plan, he decided to tell Meg everything. Meg shows up at the warehouse to stop it. You know the rest.",
        "Holden: So, Damian was in on the whole thing?",
        "Dusty: Until the last minute when he decided to bail. This guy hooks me up with this demolition expert who sells me, for a lot of money, a faulty timer on the bomb. He probably did it on purpose. This guy --",
        "Holden: Only he denies all that.",
        "Dusty: Yep. What do you think?",
        "Holden: I think that Damian is trying to get on Meg's good side.",
        "Dusty: Me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: The surgeons found a -- something they didn't expect to find, a microchip. They removed it, Paul came through the operation well, but when he woke up -- total amnesia.",
        "Lily: We're trying to help him remember who he was.",
        "Damian: And find out if this microchip was controlling his behavior somehow.",
        "Lily: Paul has a very young daughter. She needs her father. The whole family is very concerned.",
        "Dr. Frankel: It does sound like an interesting case.",
        "Damian: I know you're a very busy man, but I can promise you'll be well compensated for your time. We can arrange a private jet to fly you back and forth from Oakdale and New York. And we've already made all the arrangements so you can have anything you need at Memorial hospital.",
        "Lily: When Damian read about your research on memory recovery, we knew this case would be perfect for you. Please, say you'll help us.",
        "Dr. Frankel: Maybe I can clear my schedule for a few days.",
        "Lily: That would be wonderful.",
        "Dr. Frankel: I'll call you as soon as my plans are finalized. And I hope I'll be able to help your friend. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Damian: Thank you so much.",
        "Dr. Frankel: Yeah.",
        "Damian: I knew with you here we could convince him. I just didn't know you thought so highly of Paul Ryan.",
        "Lily: I don't. I'm doing this for Meg and Eliza.",
        "Damian: Now who's the liar?",
        "Lily: Well, if it's for the right reason.",
        "Damian: My sentiments exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I don't want Meg put in any more danger.",
        "Dusty: That's not going to happen.",
        "Holden: You need to stay away from her. I'm serious, Dusty. She didn't get hurt this time. But I don't want to risk it again.",
        "Dusty: I'll leave her alone. But you gotta keep her away from Damian.",
        "Holden: I'll keep an eye on him.",
        "Dusty: I'm fully responsible for what happened.",
        "Holden: Well, that's more than Damian would say. He never takes the blame.",
        "Dusty: I care about your sister very much. She doesn't want me in her life. I got the message.",
        "Holden: Well, that's good. Now, if I could just get Damian to back off, I could finally rest easy.",
        "Dusty: Well, it's not my problem anymore. It's up to you and your family to deal with Damian Grimaldi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So how was your visit with Meg?",
        "Paul: Great. I told her to leave and never come back.",
        "Barbara: You what?",
        "Paul: Well, I don't remember her or her daughter. And after the things that I did to her, I don't know why she even wants me around.",
        "Barbara: No, no, she knows that you're not responsible for those things! She's willing to give you another shot.",
        "Paul: I don't want another shot.",
        "Barbara: Why are you trying to alienate her?",
        "Paul: I don't even know her. Look, I know you want her to mean something to me, but she doesn't.",
        "Barbara: Give it some time. Meg and Eliza are your family. And if you could just trust that --",
        "Paul: She's better off without me and so are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: Thank you guys for the company. Sorry about how the evening got started. George was in, uh, one of his moods.",
        "Luke: How long have you guys been together?",
        "Mason: Feels like forever. We met at Cannes when my documentary was screening there.",
        "Noah: Oh, is George a filmmaker, too?",
        "Mason: No, no. George isn't, uh, visual.",
        "Luke: What does he do?",
        "Mason: Nothing. Nothing. George comes from a very wealthy family. So, he doesn't really need to work. He's got it pretty easy. At first it was amazing. We first met in Europe -- traveling around, following my film at festivals. But then I landed this teaching gig, and we settled down in Oakdale. Well, my George doesn't have anything to do during the day. So when I get home, he can be a little bit needy. It can be very intense being the center of someone's life, when that person doesn't really have a life of his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Now, didn't I tell you I'd have you back home in time for dinner?",
        "Lily: I am so glad that we got that doctor to treat Paul. You know what? I am going to call Meg right now and tell her.",
        "Damian: Would you mind if I gave her the news? I mean, I was going to stop at the farm before I head back to the hotel.",
        "Lily: Sure, yeah. You'd probably want to get going, then.",
        "Damian: Do you want to come along with me to the farm?",
        "Lily: No. I've got to make dinner for Holden and the kids.",
        "Holden: Hello, Damian.",
        "Damian: Holden, good evening.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Damian: Uh, nothing much. I was just leaving. Thanks again for coming along with me.",
        "Holden: Where did you go?",
        "Lily: We went to New York. We found a specialist that may be able to treat Paul.",
        "Holden: That's good. That's good. I'm sure Meg will appreciate that.",
        "Lily: Thanks. I'll go see what I can throw together for dinner. Good night, Damian.",
        "Damian: Good night. Holden.",
        "Holden: Damian.",
        "Damian: Yes?",
        "Holden: Do you have a second?",
        "Damian: Sure.",
        "Holden: I talked to Dusty today. He told me everything that you two did to set up Paul.",
        "Damian: It was Dusty's idea. I told him I would have nothing to do with it.",
        "Holden: Well, according to Dusty you did say \"No\" after you said \"Yes.\"",
        "Damian: In the end, I think I did the right thing.",
        "Holden: No, no, you did what you thought would get you what you want. You got Meg on your side, just like you did with my wife. Why do you keep trying to weasel your way back into my family?",
        "Damian: I did nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Holden: You may have Meg fooled, you may have Lily fooled, but not me.",
        "Lily: Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, everything's great. What's for dinner?",
        "Lily: It's a surprise!",
        "Lily: I am so proud of you, Holden.",
        "Holden: I know, I even remembered the napkins this time.",
        "Lily: That's not what I'm talking about. You didn't freak out when I told you I went to New York with Damian. I was so scared you were going to be angry with me.",
        "Holden: There's no reason to be angry. I just want to keep my eyes open.",
        "Lily: Still don't trust him?",
        "Holden: I just don't want him becoming a part of this family by setting his sights on my sister.",
        "Lily: Meg is a big girl. I'm sure she can handle herself.",
        "Holden: Yeah, that's what she says. But what if she gets in over her head?",
        "Lily: All he's doing right now is trying to help her. And you said yourself that finding a doctor was a good thing. So let's just leave it at that and not look for trouble.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. For now, I will give him the benefit of the doubt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Mason, you really did not have to pay for this.",
        "Mason: It was the least I can do. You guys saved my evening. Besides, it was nice to get to know the two of you.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: It was great to see you again.",
        "Mason: Right on. Stick to this guy, he's going place.",
        "Luke: I know. I'm lucky.",
        "Mason: Yes, you are. See you later.",
        "Noah: Oh, thanks again.",
        "Mason: Okay. Good night.",
        "Luke: Well, he's nice.",
        "Noah: Yeah. His boyfriend seems a little needy though, huh?",
        "Luke: You know, when George and Mason were arguing, I couldn't help but think that that could be us in a couple years.",
        "Noah: Are you crazy? After all we've been through? No way.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Noah. You're going to be this great filmmaker, going to all these film festivals and awards shows. And I'm going to be stuck at home, keeping your dinner warm.",
        "Noah: You will not. You'll be writing, we'll be working together. Just because we couldn't use your script in this project doesn't mean it's bad.",
        "Luke: Well, Mason wasn't very impressed.",
        "Noah: That's one guy's opinion. That's why you're going back to school, to work on your writing.",
        "Luke: No, I am going back to school because everyone, including my parents, tell me that I have to go back to school. So, I really don't want to get into it, okay?",
        "Noah: Okay. Okay. Sorry to bring up a sore subject. You know, I really don't want to fight about this. I mean, then we'll really be like George and Mason.",
        "Luke: That will never happen.",

        "Bonnie: So, you hire a new lawyer yet?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I'm keeping your files in case you change your mind. If you let me, Dusty, I really think I could help you.",

        "Paul: Um, Meg's sister-in-law.",
        "Barbara: Lily?",
        "Paul: Yes. Lily. She and some other guy found a specialist for me, some kind of brain specialist.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful. Maybe this doctor can help you get your memory back.",
        "Paul: Well, yeah. That's -- that's the idea. But I'm pretty sure that I don't believe in miracles.",
        "Barbara: But I do. And you can be you again.",
        "Paul: Yeah. After all the scary things people have been telling me about me, I don't think I want to be Paul Ryan anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lily and I went to New York and found a specialist who is very intrigued by Paul's case. And, uh, we convinced him to come to Memorial to help Paul.",
        "Meg: That's wonderful.",
        "Damian: You don't seem too happy about it. What's wrong?",
        "Meg: I went to see Paul today. He said he doesn't want to see me or Eliza again.",
        "Damian: That must have been painful to hear. But you can't take it to heart if he doesn't know what he's saying.",
        "Meg: It's not just that. I mean, for months, I was trying to keep my distance from Paul, to trying to get him out of my life, and now that's what he wants. It just doesn't feel right.",
        "Damian: What do you really want, Meg? I mean, do you want to get Paul back?",
        "Meg: No, no. But -- say this doctor can help. Will Paul be the same person he was or will he be a different man? A better man?",
        "Damian: We won't know until it happens.",
        "Meg: I know. That's what scares me.",
