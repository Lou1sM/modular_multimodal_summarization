Allison falls into the pond with the dress, but gets the key before the brainiac from Latin does. Emily and Chris get to the Old Mill too late, Emily falling and puncturing her hand on a rusty nail, Chris bandaging it and taking her to the hospital.

        "Henry: I had a poppy seed bagel for breakfast --",
        "Mike: Your teeth are fine.",
        "Henry: Okay, there's nothing less appealing than a smile peppered with poppy seeds.",
        "Mike: I'll try to remember that.",
        "Henry: And how's my cologne?",
        "Mike: You're asking the wrong guy.",
        "Henry: What are you wearing?",
        "Mike: What am I wearing?",
        "Henry: What is it, musk, musk and more musk?",
        "Mike: Okay, you get any closer, I'll swear out a complaint.",
        "Henry: One more thing, she's mine, you understand? Okay? We get to the Lakeview, you suddenly remember that you have to level a deck or deck a level or whatever it's going to take to get you and your musky tools outta there.",
        "Mike: Fine. Whatever.",
        "Hal: What can I do for you boys?",
        "Henry: Nothing. Not a thing. We're just browsing.",
        "Mike: We're here to pick up Nikki.",
        "Hal: Nikki? She signed out a while ago.",
        "Henry: But, what? We have a date. She promised.",
        "Hal: Well, I wouldn't know about that.",
        "Henry: Well, where'd she go?",
        "Hal: Beats me. But, maybe she stood you up because of that cologne -- or whatever it is you've got between your teeth. It looks like poppy seeds or something.",

        "Emily: So, did you figure out the clue yet?",
        "Chris: What clue?",
        "Emily: What clue? The clue your father and you were staring at a few minutes ago. What's with you? I thought you were really into this contest.",
        "Chris: Well, yeah, and I thought that you quit.",
        "Emily: Well, I did. But, like I told you, I'm back in.",
        "Chris: Didn't you have plans with Hal?",
        "Emily: I tried, he -- he got busy. It happens.",
        "Chris: It happens a lot?",
        "Emily: Can we talk about the clue?",
        "Chris: Yeah, sure. Emily, I just thought, if you wanted to talk --",
        "Emily: There's nothing to talk about. Come on, half the town is after this key. Let's go, the clue -- \"a treasure chest is the goal of many, but without youth it isn't worth a penny.\"",

        "Lisa: My dear, when you walk into the ballroom in this sequined gown --",
        "Mrs. Bevington: And I have your word? Bunny Farnsworth will never get her hands on this dress?",
        "Lisa: Sheila, would I ever do a thing like that? Besides, this gown is just a one of a kind, darling. And when you think about it, bunny doesn't have your figure -- oh, she could never carry it off.",
        "Mrs. Bevington: Oh, Lisa -- you're my secret weapon.",
        "Lisa: Yes. Alison? Honey, I'm so sorry that I left you -- Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, this is it. So, the key must be in this Old Mill. But there's a lot of territory to cover, so we should start inside first.",
        "Aaron: Well, the clue is a treasure hunt.",
        "Alison: Like a pirate's treasure? Or what about on the cereal box? You know, the Irish man with the pot of gold?",
        "Aaron: So, what do we look for, a rainbow? I mean, seriously.",
        "Kevin: How did you get here?",
        "Alison: What, do you think that you're the only person with a brain, Kevin?",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: Obviously not, since we did get here first.",
        "Dean: You found the key?",
        "Kevin: Because we have five keys. And at last count you had what, like one? Dean; Unless you found the key.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe we did and maybe we didn't.",
        "Kevin: They don't have it.",
        "Dean: I'm going to look outside.",
        "Aaron: Hey!",
        "Kevin: Nice dress.",
        "Alison: Well, enjoy it, Kevin. Because this is as close as you'll ever come to a bride. No, I saw it first!",
        "Kevin: Well, that's as close as you'll ever get to it.",
        "Alison: No. No. Don't touch the dress.",
        "Kevin: So what. You'll never understand it.",
        "Alison: No, that's mine! Kevin -- I got it first. It's mine! Give it to me. Give it to me.",
        "Kevin: Not anymore.",
        "Alison: I had it first. No, that's not fair. You stole that map from me!",

        "Jack: Oh, that water felt so good.",
        "Carly: Yes, good, but cold.",
        "Jack: I'll take a pond over a pool any day, I'll tell you that.",
        "Carly: Me, too. I'm just glad Emma can't see us from her window.",
        "Jack: Why's that, Mrs. Snyder?",
        "Carly: Because I do believe my husband is getting ideas.",
        "Jack: I meant what I said, you know. About wanting another child. And another, and another -- little girls just like their mommy. Blonde curls, bad tempers.",
        "Carly: I see. Well then, why don't we go ahead and get started on your project. Unless you think we have to get home.",
        "Jack: No, Emma's got the kids. I've got one of my best guys looking after Molly. We've got all the time in the world.",

        "Molly: You killed him.",
        "Starziak: I've got nothing to lose.",
        "Molly: I promise, I promise I won't testify.",
        "Starziak: You're right, you won't.",
        "Molly: Why make it any worse for yourself? I was never going to testify. When you told me to back off, I promised I would. I was just stopping by to say goodbye to my family. Please, you can take me anywhere. I'll go to Pittsburgh. I'll go to New Orleans. I promise. I swear you will never see me again.",
        "Starziak: And neither will anyone else.",

        "Emily: What is all that?",
        "Chris: Well, I got a phone book, I got an almanac, Oakdale street guide --",
        "Emily: Well, that's great, but this is all we need.",
        "Chris: What, you just carry that around with you?",
        "Emily: Yeah, actually I do. And I think we're making too much out of this little clue. I mean, \"without youth\" could just mean old, right?",
        "Chris: Right. Well, what's old in Oakdale? We got the Old Hickory Barbecue, we got the Old Garden Center, we got the Old Reliable.",
        "Emily: What's the clue again?",
        "Chris: Okay. \"A treasure chest is the goal of many, but \"old\" isn't worth a penny.\"",
        "Emily: And guess what isn't worth a penny.",
        "Chris: Mil -- it's an ancient coin of little value, less than a penny. But --",
        "Emily: Old Mill.",
        "Chris: Oh, you're a genius.",
        "Emily: We should get going.",
        "Chris: Let's go.",
        "Emily: Let's go. Oh, get the paper.",

        "Kim: Yoo hoo.",
        "Lisa: Oh, hi, honey.",
        "Kim: You almost ready? I hope you are because, I just hung your \"closed\" sign up --",
        "Lisa: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I'm almost ready.",
        "Kim: Listen, you know what? There's a great new Thai restaurant over on Commerce Street. I thought maybe you'd rather eat there than at Lakeview. What do you think?",
        "Lisa: Bite your tongue. You know Lakeview is my pride and joy.",
        "Kim: Ah. Okay, okay. Honey, is everything all right?",
        "Lisa: Well, I don't really know. Alison was in here earlier trying on wedding gowns --",
        "Kim: Oh. Did she buy anything?",
        "Lisa: I don't really know. You see, she was trying on this very expensive gown, and Sheila Bevington came in --",
        "Kim: I bet she was looking for something for the benefit.",
        "Lisa: You know how picky she can be. So I left Alison in the wedding gown and I took Sheila and started to help her. And then I came back to help Alison, and she was -- she wasn't here.",
        "Kim: Well, let's see. Let me guess. She's canceled the engagement and she's moving to California.",
        "Lisa: Well, I hope not. Certainly not with my gown.",
        "Kim: What do you mean?",
        "Lisa: Honey, I have looked everywhere. I looked for the gown. I looked in the dressing room, I looked in the racks, couldn't be found. But, you know what I found? Alison's clothes in the dressing room.",
        "Kim: Well, she's probably in the bathroom.",
        "Lisa: No, no, no, no. She's nowhere to be found.",
        "Kim: Well, she certainly wouldn't -- walk out in it. You think?",
        "Lisa: I don't know what to think. Now, I hate to accuse anyone, but, oh my, this was a very expensive gown.",
        "Kim: Well, so, what are you going to do?",
        "Lisa: The only thing I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is so unfair, we got here first. I saw that treasure chest first, and I found that map first. And now he's going to win? And it's $300,000, Aaron. Do you know you could buy with $300,000? You could get a two bedroom condo with a pool and a wet bar and two parking spaces. If he just hadn't torn the map. That's it. Aaron. Aaron, we could go to the paper and we could show them the torn map. And then they'll have to believe us. Aaron. Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on.",
        "Aaron: I know where this place is.",
        "Alison: Where what is?",
        "Aaron: This place. This place on the map. It's by the pond. This is the Old Duck Blinds.",
        "Alison: Where they used to go hunting?",
        "Aaron/Alison: Treasure hunt!",
        "Alison: But they have the, they have the part with the \"x\" on it.",
        "Aaron: It doesn't matter. Look how small the scale is. Look, an inch is like a yard here. If I get us to the Duck Blinds, then the \"x\" has to be maybe 10 feet, 20 feet away.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what if they've already found it?",
        "Aaron: Then we just take our ripped half to the newspaper and complain. And if they haven't --",
        "Alison: Then we beat them to it!",
        "Aaron: Yes!",
        "Alison: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, will you give me my shirt? Do you realize how long it's been since we've had an afternoon to ourselves? We really should do this more often, just you and me and nothing planned. Oh, Jack. Jack. I'm going to keep these, and then dry them, and then press them in a books so I'll never forget this day.",
        "Jack: I'm starving.",
        "Carly: I wonder why.",
        "Jack: You want to hit Mabel's on the way home?",
        "Carly: Oh yeah.",

        "Molly: My cousin is a cop. And he will hunt you down.",
        "Starziak: I don't think so. Not when he realizes that his family could be next.",

        "Molly: My husband -- he had so much money, and I'll give you all of it. I promise. You can take me with you, I'll help you get away.",
        "Starziak: And then what? I let you go and you go crying to your cousin.",
        "Molly: No, no, no, no!",
        "Starziak: Let me tell you something about the law. That cop? That's my third strike. There's no way I'm spending the rest of my life in a cell. Say goodbye, Molly.",

        "Lucy: Until today, I never officially realized what \"shopping till you drop\" meant. But now, I've dropped.",
        "Lucinda: Well, my darling. That's what we said hours and hours ago. Then we had ourselves a stiff lemonade, and low and behold, we got our second wind.",
        "Lucy: Well, that may be true. But just so that you know, there will be no third wind. I think I have every piece of clothing that I'll ever need and more.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know about that. What about a nice little black dress?",
        "Lucy: No, I don't think so.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, come on. With sexy shoes to wear to the dean's reception? The reception for the incoming freshmen?",
        "Lucy: Reception? No, no, I don't think so. Maybe back in your day, when things were a little more civilized.",
        "Lucinda: Where did you get that idea? Oh, my darling. The '60s were decidedly uncivilized, and that's on record.",
        "Lucy: Well, either way, I don't think I'll be needing a little black dress for any receptions. I mean it, I'm done.",
        "Lucinda: I do envy you so.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Lucinda: Well, 'cause you're heading into uncharted territories with new friends, new experiences, new horizons.",
        "Lucy: Just because it's new doesn't mean that it's going to be better than here.",
        "Lucinda: Of course it's going to be better.",
        "Lucy: How can you be so sure?",
        "Lucinda: Sweetheart, just wait. First few weeks, you're just going to be giddy, giddy, with the taste of freedom.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but freedom from what?",
        "Lucinda: From people, who because they're older than you are, think they're wiser.",
        "Lucy: People like Dusty Donovan?",
        "Lucinda: Or me, or Lily. You know, people who keep throwing free advice at you, as well as little black dresses.",
        "Lucy: No, I have no problem with free advice. You know why? Because I don't have to take it if I don't want to. I make my own decisions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: She stood me up on our first date.",
        "Mike: It wasn't exactly a date, Henry. We were just supposed to hang out together.",
        "Henry: Well, it would've been. As soon as you left.",
        "Mike: Come on. I'll buy you a beer, we'll shoot some pool.",
        "Henry: Great.",
        "Mike: It's better than going home and staring at the walls.",
        "Henry: Yeah, the cottage is so empty with Katie gone. But who needs 'em, anyway, huh? As long as we've got each other.",
        "Mike: Right.",
        "Henry: And a big glass of vodka, with just a stern look at the vermouth.",
        "Bar patron: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.",
        "[Laughter arises from the crowd watching the pool game]",
        "Hawk: Looks like the hustler just got hustled. I told you not to take that bet, bubba.",
        "Bubba: I didn't see you taking the cue out of my hand.",
        "Nikki: Ah, but he left that up to me. Pay up, big guy. Unless you want go again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay. So far so good.",
        "Chris: Yeah, either we beat the competition here, or they've already come and gone.",
        "Emily: A treasure chest. Go look! Look, look, look!",
        "Chris: Come and gone.",
        "Emily: That is so not fair. You know, you figure out the clue, you should at least get the stupid key.",
        "Chris: We'll get the next one, okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, if there is a next one. Don't you read the paper? The computer whiz. He has all five keys. He probably has this key, which means no more $300,000. Alison's $300,000.",
        "Chris: Its okay, Emily. She'll survive.",
        "Emily: Yeah, she'll survive. I forgot, she's marrying a doctor. She will survive. Well, it was fun while it lasted, right?",
        "Chris: And who knows, maybe it's not over.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Chris: You hungry?",
        "Emily: Maybe. What do you have in mind?",
        "Chris: Well, we solved the clue. I figure we, at least, deserve a treat.",
        "Emily: I like treats.",
        "Chris: A \"tons o' fun\" sundae at Al's?",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? Have you ever had that?",
        "Chris: What do you think?",
        "Emily: I'm thinking, I remember Daniel that. It took three of us to finish it.",

        "Susan: Obviously, she's gone. She's not a patient girl, maybe she got tired of waiting -- she hung up the dress somewhere and left.",
        "Lisa: You know something, Susan, you're not listening to what I'm trying to tell you. The dress is not here.",
        "Susan: What are you implying?",
        "Lisa: I've looked everywhere for the dress. And her clothes were left back there in the dressing room. So, what do you think this girl did? Do you think she just waltzed out of here in her bra and panties?",
        "Susan: Well, I don't know. I don't know what happened.",

        "Kevin: Yeah, so you can steal it?",
        "Alison: You're so lying, if you had the key, then you'd be home by now. Aaron, check out over there and I'll look over here, okay?",
        "Alison: You're a brave, duck. All this noise and you didn't fly away? It's a decoy.",

        "Chris: Oh. Sorry, sorry. Just bear with me.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Oh, it hurts.",
        "Chris: Okay. All right. Can you wiggle your fingers? Okay, that good. That's good. I don't think you damaged any of the tendons.",
        "Emily: That's good, right? That's a good thing. Oh, God. I cannot stand the sight of blood. I mean, Daniel, ouch --",
        "Chris: Sorry.",
        "Emily: -- He skins his knee, busts his lip, I take care of him. No problem. But, me? I get a hangnail and I --",

        "Lisa: Yes.",
        "Susan: What was he doing here?",
        "Lisa: I have no idea. But they were talking about that contest that's in the newspaper. Then, Sheila Bevington came in. And I had to get her set up in a dressing room. And when I came back, Aaron was gone, Alison was gone -- and the dress was gone. That's when I called you.",
        "Susan: Why did you call Kim? So you could both gang up on my daughter?",
        "Lisa: Why no --",
        "Kim: I was already here, Susan. I was here because Lisa and I have a dinner date. And as far as Alison is concerned, she managed to do this all on her own.",
        "Susan: Do what on her own? I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.",

        "Lucy: Good-bye. I mean, it's not like I'm leaving tomorrow.",
        "Lucinda: No, but honey, it's going to be sooner than you think. That's why I just wanted to give you something. I wanted to give it to you now.",
        "Lucy: Well, what is it?",
        "Lucinda: It's just something that belonged to me once.",
        "Lucy: Oh, thank you. It's so pretty.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling. It's a dime a dozen. It's a circle pin. When I was your age, everybody wore them. All the girls that wrote into contests in magazines, and went to college. And had clothes and wonderful hair and manners. All the people that I had no use for.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Lucinda: Because I wasn't one of them. And they knew it, I hadn't had their advantages. Well, someone noticed that underneath my raging ambition and my raging attitude, that I had something that I wanted. A secret. I wanted somebody to like me. Not everybody, just somebody to think that I had potential and value.",
        "Lucy: And this person gave you this?",
        "Lucinda: For my birthday. And then I had something that I had never had before. I had -- I had the pin. But, I had a friend. Honey, it opened up my life.",
        "Lucy: Well then, you should keep it.",
        "Lucinda: No. No, I want you to have it. I do. And you don't have to wear it, God forbid. But you could take it out from time to time, look at it, and just remember. Change can be good. Life can open up in ways that you never dreamed of. Okay? I know. I know there are things that you're afraid to leave behind because you're not sure because nobody can tell you what's going to replace them. But there's a big world out there. It's full of wonderful surprises.",
        "Lucy: Is there something wrong with loving the world I'm in now?",

        "Mike: D.C.'s a nice place to visit.",
        "Nikki: Nah, I hate it. They have me in this cubicle. I can hear the guy next to me, he's a mouth breather. [Mike laughs] all I do all day long is stare at my computer screen and dream about what I'm going to have for lunch. Not what I signed up for.",
        "Mike: Which was?",
        "Nikki: To be a supercop, like my dad. That's why this case was so important to me. It was my one chance to prove myself in the field, and I blew it.",
        "Mike: I don't believe that.",
        "Nikki: I lost the suspect. Trust me, it's over. They're gonna stick me back behind that computer screen. \"Here lies Nikki Munson, she died of boredom.\"",
        "Mike: So quit your job. Tell your boss what he can do with his computer and come work for your dad.",
        "Nikki: Don't think I haven't thought about it. But losing that suspect hasn't exactly endeared me to the Oakdale PD. Unless I want to make shakes at Al's Diner, I don't think there's much hope for me here.",
        "Henry: All right, here's a martini for me, some domestic swill for you and JD for the lovely little lady.",

        "Hal: He didn't wait for backup?",
        "Carly: I don't think he had much of a choice, Hal. He asked me to call you, to ask you if you would send a unit over to the hospital.",
        "Hal: Are you okay there by yourself?",
        "Carly: Yeah. It's just that the body, Officer Kane, is still here on the floor. And I'd really like the paramedics to take a look at my cousin. Do you think they'll be there soon?",

        "Susan: Wait. Just back up. Is this about that stupid contest?",
        "Alison: Mom, it's not a stupid contest. If I win, then I get $300,000. And look, I only need four more keys and then I'll win. And I can buy a dozen wedding dresses.",
