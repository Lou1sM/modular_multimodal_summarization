        "Meg is anxious to leave the hospital, but Paul is going to keep her preoccupied by something else, which is guaranteed to put a smile on her face. Allison tears into Aaron for no apparent reason. Aaron is worried about how Allison is acting \u0096 erratic and moody \u0096 it is like she is on drugs. Kim worries about Chris taking so much time off and offers him a job at the station, but he explains that he is just taking his time before he jumps into something again. He doesn't want her to worry. Daniel wants his dad to tell him why he doesn't want him to be with his mom anymore. Emily pleads with Margo not to take her to court. Margo tells her to give up custody and they won't put her profession front and center, but Emily won't give up Daniel. Casey pleads Emily's case, but Tom won't budge. Paul goes to sees Emma about a favor. They butt heads at first, but then they agree to a truce and she agrees to help him. Allison tells Aaron to leave her alone because he is not her friend, as Chris watches. Chris tries to help Allison too, but she turns her anger on him. He suggests she have a physical since she is exhibiting strange symptoms, but she won't listen to him either. Allison fidgets so much that she breaks her bracelet. Paul asks Meg to marry him again, and then brings in Emma and Barbara. They are all prepared for a wedding, which thrills Meg. Meg receives gifts of something old (a veil of Emma's), new (the wedding dress she liked from Fashions), borrowed (family bible) and blue (a gift Barbara thinks came from Gwen). Paul even convinces Meg's minister to preside over the ceremony. Emma jokes with Paul about him making it hard for her to dislike him. Tom and Emily's hearing starts and Tom is prepared to show his evidence, but then he sees Casey come in and sit on Emily's side. He changes his mind, much to the courts chagrin and the case is dismissed. Margo is furious, as Tom explains why he did what he did. Allison apologizes to Aaron and explains that she didn't know what happened to her. Chris tells Susan that he is worried about Allison and her behavior and health, as Susan tells him to leave them all alone. Meg and Paul's wedding starts, but Meg faints as she is saying her vows to Paul. Meg finally awakens and admits to feeling off and even hallucinating, but no one suspects it might be from the necklace she was wearing. Emily tells Casey he was the main reason she still has her son. She kisses him passionately in public and tells him that she no longer cares who knows about them; she loves him. Allison sees them and Emily tells her the same thing she just told Casey. Allison flatly tells them congratulations before she walks off. Meg and Paul are married. Chris receives an unsigned note and gift; it is a watch and based on what the note said, he assumes it is from his mother. He leaves her a message thanking her for her support, but not mentioning the actual gift. Paul and Meg revel in their newfound wedded bliss again, as the necklace sits nearby on Meg's bedside table."

        "Meg: Oh.",
        "[Meg groans]",
        "Paul: Are you okay?",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, I just forgot about the bullet wound. I hate when that happens.",
        "Paul: I'll call the nurse and get you something for pain.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. It just hurts when I roll over on it. I'm fine.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna call room service, get some coffee. [Meg laughs] You want coffee?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: You want pizza? Anything? What do you want?",
        "Meg: Yeah, home.",
        "Paul: You want to go home?",
        "Meg: I want to go home.",
        "Paul: You know you can't. They need to observe you for at least another few days.",
        "Meg: But I feel fine. Come on. You're -- you're my rich, powerful husband. You're supposed to be able to give me whatever I want.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: So, what do you want? You want balloons?",
        "Paul: How about farm animals? [Meg laughs] Or like little dancing gazelles? I adore you.",
        "Meg: Beautiful words. You always say beautiful words. Is Mama here?",
        "Paul: No. Why? Is that what you want?",
        "Meg: You know, I think she's starting to like you. She said a lot of nice things about you yesterday.",
        "Paul: Nah, she was just humoring the gunshot victim. Look, isn't there something else I can get you?",
        "Meg: I want Mama to like you. It's really my fault that she missed the wedding.",
        "Paul: I got somewhere I need to go. But I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Meg: Okay. And then -- and then you will bring flowers and Mama and beautiful words.",
        "Paul: If that's what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hey, Beautiful. What are you drinking? I'll get it.",
        "Alison: Arsenic, rat poison, whatever they've got on tap.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you got your test back. The results, huh?",
        "Alison: Yep. Read it and weep.",
        "Aaron: A \"C.\" That's not bad.",
        "Alison: I have to maintain at least a \"B\" average to stay in the nursing school.",
        "Aaron: You'll do it, okay? Okay, it's gonna take some time. It'll take a while to get into it, but listen, you'll be fine.",
        "Alison: Don't patronize me! You're not helping!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: What about you? What are you up to today?",
        "Chris: You know, read, eat, sleep. That's pretty typical for me these days.",
        "[Chris chuckles]",
        "Kim: I'm really glad that you've taken the time to slow down and, uh, you know, think about what you're gonna do with the rest of your life. But it does occur to me that there might be such a thing as having too much time on your hands.",
        "Chris: Oh, is there?",
        "Kim: I just mean that you've gone from 100 miles an hour to nothing, so -- I mean, isn't it kind of boring to just lounge around all the time?",
        "Chris: It's working for me.",
        "Kim: Okay. Okay. If you change your mind, let me know. I could probably find something for you at the -- at the station.",
        "Chris: Why would I want to -- oh, oh, okay. This is coming from Dad, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: There's your coffee.",
        "Aaron: Thanks. Where's my apology? I guess I'm not getting one.",
        "Alison: You don't deserve one. I know you're trying to be all encouraging, but don't, okay?",
        "Aaron: You make it sound like a kick in the teeth.",
        "Alison: Sometimes hearing \"You can do it, Alison\" every 10 minutes makes me feel like a loser. Why do I need a cheerleader for something that everybody else is able to do without even thinking twice about it?",
        "Aaron: All I said was that there's nothing wrong with a \"C.\" And if I keep telling you that you're gonna make it through school and you're gonna be a great nurse, that's not cheerleading, okay? It's the truth.",
        "Alison: You didn't even want me to go back to nursing school. You wanted me to run off to Seattle with you and hang out.",
        "Aaron: That was before I knew how important it was to you.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Aaron: What's with your hostility?",
        "Alison: I'm not hostile. It's not my fault you're getting on my nerves.",
        "Aaron: I didn't even do anything. And why are you acting like -- why are you acting all weird, like --",
        "Alison: Like what?",
        "[Aaron sighs]",
        "Aaron: Never mind. Never mind, okay? Do you -- do you still want to go to the pond and go swimming like we planned before work?",
        "Alison: No, no, no. Say it. Say it. What were you gonna say? I'm behaving like what?",
        "Aaron: Like maybe you're on drugs again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daniel: So, you and Mom have to have a court hearing?",
        "Tom: Well, your mom and I both love you. You do know that.",
        "Daniel: Yeah. So?",
        "Tom: So sometimes we don't agree on what's best for you. We're gonna ask a judge to help us figure it out. Understand?",
        "Daniel: I guess.",
        "Tom: Look, um, I hope this won't be necessary, but it's possible the judge may want to talk to you at some point.",
        "Daniel: About what?",
        "Tom: You know, about your life, stuff that makes you happy.",
        "Daniel: Stuff about Mom?",
        "Tom: Maybe, but nothing you can't answer.",
        "Daniel: Today at the court hearing, are you gonna ask the judge to take away Mom's shared custody?",
        "Tom: For the time being.",
        "Daniel: Then tell me.",
        "Casey: Tell you what?",
        "Daniel: Tell me why Dad doesn't want me to see my mom anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I have no idea how long this hearing is gonna last. These are active files. They go to Griffin.",
        "Cop: I'll put them on his desk.",
        "Margo: Okay, I'm gonna make some more notes on these, but you find me before I leave.",
        "Cop: Will do, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: Please, thank you.",
        "Emily: Clearing your whole day, Margo? The hearing's gonna take, what, an hour. What are you planning to do afterwards?",
        "Margo: Go away, Emily.",
        "Emily: You and Tom planning to have a big party after you steal my son away from me?",
        "Margo: Well, the first part of the hearing, where Tom makes his statements, is gonna take at least an hour. And then the judge is gonna want to talk to Daniel.",
        "Emily: What? The judge is gonna want to talk to my son about me?",
        "Margo: Oh, would you please relax? I'm sure she knows what she's doing.",
        "Emily: Look, I know you loathe me. I get that.",
        "Margo: You have no idea how much I loathe you.",
        "Emily: But you love Daniel. You love Daniel. Why would you do this to him? Why would you do that? If he finds out that -- that I was a prostitute -- Margo, please. I'm begging you. No child should hear that about his mother.",
        "Margo: One simple solution to that -- don't fight us. He won't find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I just got off the phone with Trey Jackson. He and his brothers just set up a full-blown interactive gaming center in their house and they want to know if he could come over.",
        "Daniel: Really? Right now?",
        "Casey: If it's cool with Dad.",
        "Daniel: Can I, Dad? They got, like, a whole arcade system in their basement.",
        "Tom: Sure. Be home for lunch.",
        "Daniel: Yeah. You, uh -- you coming, Casey?",
        "Casey: I'll catch you later, Man, okay?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Tom: You had no right to do that. You knew that I was probably talking to him about any questions the judge might have.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know, but --",
        "Tom: Just trying to get him off so you can talk to him alone?",
        "Casey: Okay, wait a minute.",
        "Tom: Or maybe trying to spin this custody agreement so that you could turn him against your mother and me? I'm not gonna stand for it!",
        "Casey: Hey! I want him out of the house so I could talk to you, so he wouldn't hear. God, I would never mess with his mind by trashing you and Mom. And you know what? Maybe you should do the same thing by not trashing Emily.",
        "Tom: My responsibility is to bring him up the best that I can. And that is what I intend to do.",
        "Casey: By poisoning his mind against his mother?",
        "Tom: He's not gonna hear any stories about what Emily did. The story he'll get is that she and I couldn't agree upon his care, so the judge awarded me full custody.",
        "Casey: Do -- do you really think Daniel is that stupid? He's gonna know that there's more to this than that.",
        "Tom: I'm sure there will be questions. Margo and I can handle it.",
        "Casey: He's not gonna ask you a damn thing. He's gonna go back to his boarding school with his questions. And then he and his friends are gonna look on the internet, research the case, and find out everything!",
        "Tom: Fine. I'll have the records sealed.",
        "Casey: Okay, that might slow him down, but its not gonna stop him from getting answers. And then who's he gonna hate? Huh? His mother for being a prostitute? You for outing her? Or himself for being the reason everyone knows?",
        "Tom: This is all Emily's doing.",
        "Casey: She's not doing anything anymore. It was a crazy, self-destructive time in her life, and she snapped out of it and ended it. She is not the same person anymore.",
        "Tom: Really? So, she sleeps with unknown men for money. She sleeps with other people, including me, before you say it, and now she's sleeping with you? I'm sorry. Sounds like the same Emily to me.",
        "Casey: She is still a good mother to Daniel.",
        "Tom: Stop bringing up Daniel like that's what we're fighting about. You're not here trying to protect your brother. You're trying to protect what you have going on with Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: There's no need to put this out there where Daniel can get a hold of it.",
        "Margo: Then sign over custody to us and there's no way that Daniel will know about your sleazy past from Tom or me.",
        "Emily: I'm not signing my son over to you, Margo. He'll -- he'll hate me for abandoning him. Is that what you want?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Emily: I can't believe you could be so heartless. You love Daniel. Don't you love him enough to -- to keep him from the pain this is gonna cause him?",
        "Margo: Don't you dare question my commitment to Daniel. You have damaged my family enough, and it ends today. Now.",
        "Emily: This isn't about Daniel. This is all about Casey. This is about me and Casey. And you can't handle it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to fight. I am begging you, okay? Right now, what can I do to change your mind? Anything and I will do it.",
        "[Margo chuckles]",
        "Margo: See you in court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, that's what it comes down to? Me and Emily?",
        "Tom: There's more to it than that.",
        "Casey: Yes, there's Daniel. And he's a great kid. And that's partly because of Emily. Do you really think by cutting his mom out of his life that's the best thing for him?",
        "Tom: That is my decision, yes.",
        "Casey: A decision you made because of what Daniel needs? Or because you got issues with me?",
        "Tom: I'm very clear about what I'm doing, Casey, and why, and it has very little to do with your relationship with Emily.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'll buy that. But what about my other big issues? I'm an ex-con. Maybe this isn't about Daniel. Maybe this is about the sons you tried to save and you couldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: What do you want?",
        "Paul: I want Meg to be happy. And on some level, that means I got to get along with you, so I guess we have a problem.",
        "Emma: Yeah, we do have a problem. 'Cause I don't like you. I don't think you're a good person.",
        "Paul: I don't like you much, either.",
        "Emma: I've seen the damage you've done. I've seen my daughter thrown in jail. I have seen her lose a job that she loves because of you. I've seen her jump into a marriage that was doomed all because of you. You have -- you have caused her nothing but anguish.",
        "Paul: Go ahead. Don't be afraid.",
        "Emma: And every time she has managed to pull away from you on her own, you have dragged her back. No, I don't like you. I don't like what you've done to my daughter. Why couldn't you just leave her alone?",
        "Paul: I'm never gonna leave her alone. I think it was a mistake to come here and talk to you.",
        "[Emma sighs]",
        "Emma: Paul, I -- I want Meg to be happy, too. I know that she needs my blessing. I know that she needs my approval. But how can I give her that when I don't see anything good in you? I want to. But I just can't.",
        "Paul: Well, Meg can. Maybe you could take her word for it.",
        "Emma: Do you think that I -- I have been unfair to you?",
        "Paul: No, I think that when you look at me, all you can see is my anger and my jealousy, which has been off the charts.",
        "Emma: And all that's changed, has it?",
        "Paul: Loving Meg has changed everything. I've had to learn to be patient. I've had to learn to have faith that someone like Meg could love someone like me. And every morning, I have faith that when I wake up, that she will still choose to be there next to me.",
        "Emma: Can you promise me -- promise me that you won't hurt her?",
        "Paul: No, but I promise you that I will never hurt her intentionally. And, Emma, I promise that I will love her as long as she'll have me. That's a promise that I can actually keep.",
        "Emma: What was the favor you wanted?",
        "Paul: You going soft on me?",
        "[Emma chuckles]",
        "Emma: No, I'm just -- I'm just accepting what is. And I'm praying to God that he knows better than I do. What is the favor?",
        "Paul: My wife wants three presents. And you're one of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Son, come on. Your father is concerned about your future. We both are.",
        "Chris: But he just dismisses the fact that I've worked on stuff since med school.",
        "Kim: He knows how hard you've worked.",
        "Chris: Then why can't he understand that I need a little time to figure out what I want to do next? No, he just sees that as me loafing around.",
        "Kim: Does it occur to you that maybe you're just a little bit too sensitive?",
        "Chris: Mom, I'm a grown man. I pay my own bills. And, yes, I get a little sensitive when my daddy tries to tell me what to do. I just need a little time, Mom. Maybe a few weeks, maybe a few months.",
        "Kim: Oh.",
        "Chris: Well, think of it as a sabbatical -- time to look back and see where I've been and decide where I'm going.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "[Chris laughs]",
        "Chris: It takes as long as it takes or, you know, until I run out of money, whichever happens sooner. [Laughter] I'm gonna be fine, okay?",
        "Kim: Okey-dokey. Okay.",
        "Chris: See you later.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Bye.",
        "Alison: I can't believe you think I'm doing drugs again.",
        "Aaron: Well, you're practically biting my head off, okay? And your eyes are doing funny things, and you won't stop fidgeting with that little bracelet that your dad got you. What am I supposed to think?",
        "Alison: You're supposed to be my friend. But you're not, not really. You're just waiting for me to fail.",
        "Aaron: What? Since when? Are you crazy? When?",
        "Alison: Since always, probably. I just didn't see it before.",
        "Aaron: Okay, you're upset. And I probably shouldn't have said a thing about you being on drugs.",
        "Alison: You know what? I know you don't really believe in me, so just stop pretending, okay? Just go away.",
        "Chris: Put this on.",
        "Alison: I don't need it.",
        "Chris: Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Where have you been?",
        "Paul: You sent me on an errand. You don't remember?",
        "Meg: I remember telling you I wanted to go home.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. They need to observe you for at least another day.",
        "Meg: But I'm not bleeding, and I'm not unconscious. And I can channel-surf at home in my own bed, cuddling my own husband.",
        "Paul: Well, that's true.",
        "Meg: And my mama hasn't even come by. I mean, I've been shot by a homicidal maniac and I'm in the hospital. She hasn't even called. I don't think she's even home.",
        "Paul: Well, she'll be here soon.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Even though she doesn't approve of your brand-new husband.",
        "Meg: Well, I didn't, either, for a long, long time.",
        "Paul: Really? But you like me now.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Paul: So, will you marry me?",
        "Meg: We're already married.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but your mother wasn't here.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.",
        "Emma: Well, don't be too sure.",
        "[Emma chuckles]",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: Waiting for to answer me. Will you marry me here, right now?",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: How did he talk you into this?",
        "Emma: No, he didn't. You did. You love him, so I thought I might as well try to tolerate him a bit.",
        "Paul: See? We're making headway.",
        "Emma: Are you up to another wedding?",
        "Barbara: Don't you think this is happening without me.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Paul: I'm still waiting. What do you say?",
        "Meg: I do.",
        "Meg: Am I getting married in this hospital again?",
        "Barbara: No, you are not, because I went over to Fashions and I picked up that dress that you saw that you liked so much, so you'll have something new.",
        "Meg: But, I --",
        "Paul: Look, I talked to Susan, and your doctor says it's okay if you stand up, if it's just for a few minutes.",
        "Emma: And I brought you this.",
        "Meg: Your mantilla.",
        "Emma: Mm-hmm.",
        "Meg: Mama wore this to all our christenings.",
        "Emma: Hopefully, it will bring you much happiness and many healthy babies.",
        "Paul: Thank you, Emma.",
        "Emma: Be a good husband. That's the only thanks I need. Now that -- that was the something old. And here is something borrowed -- family bible.",
        "Barbara: And this morning, I received a present from Will and Gwen.",
        "Paul: You heard from them?",
        "Barbara: I did.",
        "Paul: How are they doing?",
        "Barbara: They're fine. But they heard about Sofie and everything we went through with Cole. And they knew I'd be traumatized. They sent me a little present, and I would be honored if you wore it as something blue.",
        "Meg: It's lovely. How did you know how much this would mean to me?",
        "Paul: You promise me you'll take it easy, okay? 'Cause the sooner you get better, the sooner I get to carry you over the threshold.",
        "Meg: Again.",
        "Paul: Again. Again and again and again.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, okay. That's enough, you two. You have to get out of here so we can get this girl ready for her wedding. Come on, go.",
        "Emma: Hey, Sweetheart. So, how do you feel?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Like a bride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know you think you went wrong somewhere with me and Adam, and --",
        "Tom: Case, I love you and I'm proud of you. I am.",
        "Casey: The thing you did right, you and Mom -- you weren't perfect. You did bad things sometimes. You even cheated on each other. Okay, yes, but it proves something. That good people can make mistakes and come out on the other side better. No matter what, you always forgave each other, and us. Now, why can't you forgive Emily?",
        "Tom: I guess some things are just worse than others. And I am not gonna allow Emily to be some kind of a -- or have a toxic effect on Daniel's life.",
        "Casey: I'm an ex-con. What kind of toxic effect do I have on his life?",
        "Tom: It's not even the same thing.",
        "Casey: Yes, it is! It is exactly the same thing. Daniel is not responsible for anything here, anything, but you're making him suffer for it.",
        "Tom: I am being his father.",
        "Casey: Well, be my father, Dad. Love me enough not to do this.",
        "Tom: I got to get to court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Are you warmer now? Have the chills stopped?",
        "Alison: Enough questions, all right? I don't need your help. I wish everybody would just leave me alone.",
        "Chris: You still look a little shaky and flushed. Why don't you have some of this tea?",
        "Alison: I don't want it.",
        "Chris: Did you eat breakfast?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: Were you nauseous again?",
        "Alison: Just leave me alone, okay?",
        "Chris: Okay, I get that you don't want my help, Ali, but you were dizzy yesterday at the track, too. Maybe you should get a checkup or something.",
        "Alison: From you? What, is this your way of coming on to me? Are you offering to give me physicals now?",
        "Chris: You need to find out why your eyes are glassy, why you've got chills and nausea. And why you're suddenly coming on to me when we both know I'm the last guy you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What are you doing here? You -- you can't be here. You mom and dad cannot can't see you with me, Casey, especially not now.",
        "Casey: I came to warn you. I tried to talk to my dad, you know, and get him to back off.",
        "Emily: Why did you do that?",
        "Casey: Because I feel like this is partly my fault. You know, if you and I weren't --",
        "Emily: Casey, what am I gonna do? They've already won this and it hasn't even started. What am I gonna do? Your father tells the judge what I did -- Margo says I should just drop the case.",
        "Casey: No, you cannot do that. Daniel is your kid. You got to fight for him.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, if it ends up hurts him more than --",
        "Casey: Oh, it's gonna only hurt him more if he thinks you don't want him.",
        "Emily: Are you gonna be here? I mean, I know you have to sit with your mom and dad.",
        "Casey: I think it's only gonna make it worse for you, Emily. Look, I wish I could sit with you. I wish I could hold your hand.",
        "Emily: No, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. There's no sense in making them angrier than they already are, your mom and dad.",
        "Casey: I'm pulling for you, Emily. With everything I have, okay?",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Casey: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You don't care about my health. All you want to do is get me into bed, as usual. And I wasn't coming on to you. I was being sarcastic.",
        "Chris: Okay, the chills and nausea -- did you fake those, too?",
        "Alison: Like you care.",
        "Chris: If you don't want to believe me, don't, okay? But your mother's a doctor. Ask her to look at you, all right?",
        "Alison: I'm busy -- studying. Damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Mr. Hughes, I understand you have new evidence regarding the fitness of the mother and are filing a motion to deny all visitations from this time forward. Mr. Hughes?",
        "Tom: Yes, your honor, that's correct.",
        "Judge: Fine, let's hear your evidence.",
        "Tom: Although Ms. Stewart and I have shared custody of our son, Daniel, since his birth, certain facts have recently come to my attention that lead me to believe that further contact with Ms. Stewart is not in the best interest of our child.",
        "Tom: The evidence will indicate --",
        "Judge: Mr. Hughes, do you have evidence to support your claim?",
        "Tom: Actually, your honor, no, I don't.",
        "Judge: Then would you mind telling me what we're doing here?",
        "Tom: I apologize. I've decided to withdraw my suit.",
        "Judge: As a former district attorney, you should have more respect for the court's time.",
        "Tom: I do, your honor. I just find that I've -- I've rushed to judgment.",
        "Judge: If only you had reached that conclusion earlier. This case is dismissed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Damn.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Meg: I got your flowers.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Barbara: Did you get the judge?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it's a holy day, so I got a holy guy.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Meg: Reverend Strickland! Oh, it is so good to see you.",
        "Minister: You've grown into a beautiful young woman, as I predicted. Emma.",
        "Emma: I thought you were going to South America.",
        "Minister: I leave tomorrow. I explained that to this young man, but he wouldn't take no for an answer.",
        "Meg: That's why you wanted to have the wedding today.",
        "Paul: Well, yes. Either that or we could wait for a year for Reverend Strickland to get back from South America.",
        "Minister: Well, I'm honored that you went to so much trouble, and pleased, seeing as how this one sat in my pews since she was in pigtails.",
        "Emma: You are making it hard for me not to like you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, you started it.",
        "Minister: Well, let's take our places. Considering the circumstances, I'll keep it brief, and I'm going to let the couple say their own vows.",
        "Paul: I'll go first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I broke my bracelet. Did I break us, too?",
        "Aaron: What was going on with you before?",
        "Alison: I have no idea, Aaron. I am so sorry I snapped at you like that.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I was out of line, too, thinking that you might be on drugs. But you were acting so weird.",
        "Alison: I know. It was weird, wasn't it? I don't have any idea what made me so angry.",
        "Aaron: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Susan, can I -- can I speak to you for a minute?",
        "Susan: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Chris: Then can you listen, okay? I'm worried about Alison.",
        "Susan: Are you kidding me? She doesn't need your concern. How many times and in how many ways has she asked you to stay out of her life?",
        "Chris: Oh, she's made it very clear, believe me. But she's exhibiting strange behavior and some troubling symptoms.",
        "Susan: Well, maybe that's your fault. Maybe if you respected her wishes and left her alone, that would help.",
        "Chris: All I'm trying saying is I think you should give her a physical, okay?",
        "Susan: Stay away from my daughter. And now that we don't work together, stay away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, this morning, you asked me for flowers and your mom and beautiful words. And since your mom's here and there's flowers -- gorgeous. Exquisite. Breathtaking. All mine. Friendship. Romance. Passion. Hope. Forever with me. Those are the most beautiful words I could think of. Forever with you.",
        "Meg: I love you so much. You are my everything. You are --",
        "Emma: Oh!",
        "Susan: What happened?",
        "Emma: Oh, she -- she fainted. I mean, she was only on her feet for a few moments.",
        "Susan: Paul, take that necklace off. It's in my way.",
        "Emma: Oh, Sweetheart. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Why did you -- why did you -- why did you let her get away with this?",
        "Tom: Well, she didn't.",
        "Margo: Yes, she did, Tom. She just walked out of here, and she's still got shared custody of Daniel.",
        "Tom: Did you see your son walk in the courtroom?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Tom: Did you see where he sat?",
        "Margo: So? He's still infatuated with her?",
        "Tom: So I had to make a decision. I either lose my son or keep them both.",
        "Margo: Oh. Explain this to me, Tom.",
        "Tom: Casey came by the house earlier and begged me to let her off the hook.",
        "Margo: What? So you caved?",
        "Tom: No, I came here with every intention of keeping Emily as far away from Daniel as I possibly could.",
        "Margo: Why did you do this?",
        "Tom: Because I think I finally started to see the pattern. Every time we fight with Emily, we win the battle and lose the war. She'll gonna play the victim no matter what.",
        "Margo: Oh, she always does. I know that.",
        "Tom: I mean with me, with Chris. I finally decided that we don't have to do any of the heavy lifting around here anymore. I mean, we don't need to keep her away from Daniel or Casey. Eventually, they're gonna see the same thing we do and she will alienate herself all on her own.",
        "Margo: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You did this for me.",
        "Casey: I'm glad I could help.",
        "Emily: Let's get out of here so I can kiss you.",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I got a \"C\" on my first test, Aaron. That's not good.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but it's not terrible. I mean, think about it. Without -- without Chris's help or Meg's help or anybody, you raised your average a whole grade point, studying on your own. You keep that up, you'll be making B-pluses by the end of the week.",
        "Alison: You really think so?",
        "Aaron: I never lie to you.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I am so sorry I blew up at you. I heard myself saying these horrible things, and the whole time, I was just thinking, \"Shut up!\"",
        "Aaron: When was the last time you ate?",
        "Alison: Well, I didn't really feel good this morning, so I skipped breakfast and I really just had coffee.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, that'll make anybody crazy. I'm gonna make you a sandwich. And I'll even throw in a virgin pi\u00f1a colada.",
        "Alison: Oh, my hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You know, Susan, before Meg fainted, she had her hand on her heart and she -- she looked very distressed. Did you hear anything in the stethoscope at all?",
        "Susan: Were you in any pain?",
        "Meg: No. It was more like a flutter. It's not the first time Paul has made my heart race like that. That's when I got light-headed, and -- and even for a second, I was hallucinating.",
        "Paul: You have any idea what happened?",
        "Susan: Actually, I've found nothing. Her heartbeat was a little rapid when I first examined her, but it's subsided, and everything else looks normal. Maybe it was just this second wedding -- jitters.",
        "Paul: You know what? This is all -- this is my fault. I think we should have waited until you were 100%. If you don't mind, maybe you could give my bride some time to rest.",
        "Meg: No, no, no! No. I will feel a lot worse if we don't finish what we started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You gave me back my son, Case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, that was good.",
        "Aaron: Well, I'd offer you dessert, but I don't want you to take it the wrong way.",
        "Alison: Well, this is for you. Take that any way you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What are you doing? We're in public.",
        "Emily: I know. I know and I don't care. I love you, Casey. I love you, and I don't care who knows it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: This is like handing Emily a blank check. Just you can do whatever you want. We'll look the other way.",
        "Tom: Just hold on for one second.",
        "Margo: I hate this.",
        "Tom: Yo, Dan, are you here?",
        "Margo: I hate this. I hate Emily.",
        "Tom: He must be still at Trey's.",
        "Margo: I hate that she's gonna -- that she's gonna win again. And this is not just about Daniel. This is about with Casey, too.",
        "Tom: Well, I think we need to just let this thing run its course.",
        "Margo: Really? Do we? Do we just wait until she gets pregnant or they get married or she -- she gives him some horrible sexual disease?",
        "Tom: Oh, stop it.",
        "Margo: Because the woman is out of control, Tom! Who knows what she's gonna do next? And as far as her and Casey being a couple, I can't accept that. I won't accept that.",
        "Tom: And you think that's gonna make a difference to Casey? He's a grown man. He's gonna do what he wants, no matter what his parents say. So if we dig in, we lose him. And that just gives Emily another win to add to her list.",
        "Margo: Oh, no. I'm not gonna give Emily another win. I'm gonna find some way to stop Emily, permanently.",

        "Emily: Hi, Ali.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Emily: Um, in case you're wondering, Casey and I love each other. And we're together. So don't give me any grief about it, okay?",
        "[Alison scoffs]",
        "Alison: Congratulations.",
        "Casey: See? That -- that was easy.",

        "Chris: All right. Uh, no address? When did it come in?",
        "Clerk: It was delivered by messenger earlier.",
        "Chris: Oh, all right. [Chris clears throat] \"Take all the time you need.\" Hey, Mom, it's me. Uh, thank you for everything, seriously. Not just the obvious, but, you know, um -- you always understand. Talk to you later.",

        "Minister: You certainly may.",
