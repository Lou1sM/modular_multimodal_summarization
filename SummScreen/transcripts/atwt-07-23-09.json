        "Sage: What is that?",
        "Parker: You smell it, too?",
        "Sage: It smells like that time when the raccoon got into the garage and died.",
        "Parker: Yeah, you made Dad bury it in the backyard.",
        "Sage: It was just looking for food.",
        "Parker: Fortunately, I don't think it's a dead raccoon this time. I think Aunt Rosanna's cooking.",
        "Sage: What are we going to do?",
        "Parker: We're going to get out while we still can. Come on.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, I thought I heard you guys.",
        "Parker: Hey, we're just leaving.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. It's lunchtime.",
        "Sage: We're not hungry.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you have to eat.",
        "Parker: Oh -- we had a big breakfast.",
        "Rosanna: You didn't have any breakfast.",
        "Parker: Not here. We ate at the diner.",
        "Sage: Yeah, pancakes and waffles and toast. I'm stuffed!",
        "Rosanna: Aww -- well, come on. I made something really special.",
        "Parker: Yeah, we kind of figured that out.",
        "Rosanna: It smells delicious, doesn't it? Um, come on, sit down and I'll get your lunch.",
        "Sage: This is our chance.",
        "Parker: What? No, no, no. Sage, Sage, we can't.",
        "Sage: Why not?",
        "Parker: Because we'll hurt her feelings.",
        "Sage: Since when do you care about anyone's feelings?",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah, since when do you want to take after me? Come on.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, here we go.",
        "Sage: What is it?",
        "Rosanna: Taste it first. What do you think?",
        "Parker: Tastes as good as it smells.",
        "Sage: What is it?",
        "Rosanna: It's whole wheat pasta with Swiss chard. It's a special vegan recipe.",
        "Sage: Vegan? What's that?",
        "Parker: It means all the food tastes like green sandpaper.",
        "Rosanna: No. It means that it's a healthy, vitamin-rich, environmentally sensitive, humane way to eat.",
        "Parker: And it tastes like green sandpaper.",
        "Rosanna: Sage, help me here. What do you think?",
        "Sage: Green sandpaper.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I give up. Get in the car. Let's go out.",
        "Parker: Oh, real -- I mean, if that's what you want, then, I guess. Get out of here.",
        "Rosanna: It's so good!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Your grandmother convinced Dean Brewster to meet her. He's coming over today.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Lily: She told him that you'd like to be reinstated so that you can go back to school.",
        "Luke: And what did he say?",
        "Lily: Well, he didn't say no.",
        "Luke: Well, that's good.",
        "Lily: He's on his way now, so can you come home?",
        "Luke: Now? I have a lot of stuff to do for the foundation.",
        "Lily: Well, it can wait. Honey, I think it's really important for you to talk to him yourself.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Lily: Then you'll come home and talk to him?",
        "Luke: I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Lily: Okay, don't keep him waiting long.",
        "Luke: I won't. Tell Grandmother thanks for doing this.",
        "Lily: You can tell her yourself when you see her. See you soon.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "[Lily whistles]",
        "Lily: You look very handsome.",
        "Holden: I'm going for respectable.",
        "Lily: Well, you look respectable, too. You're going to make a great impression.",
        "Holden: I don't want to blow this. I really want this to work out.",
        "Lily: Ooh, then you better fix your tie. There you go.",
        "Holden: Where is Luke?",
        "Lily: He's at the foundation. He'll be here soon.",
        "Holden: That's good. I really, really want this to go well. He needs to go back to college.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm. So he can spend less time with Damian?",
        "Holden: No, so he can be with Noah and his friends, doing what he should be doing.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Holden: You don't believe me?",
        "Lily: Honestly? No, I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, Grandmother seems to think that she can strong arm the dean into letting me back into OU.",
        "Damian: Your grandmother can be very persuasive.",
        "Luke: Yeah, especially when she's throwing around all her money.",
        "Damian: Well, universities are businesses, and right now, they can't afford to lose customers or contributors.",
        "Luke: But, do you really think its okay that they blackmailed the school into letting me back in?",
        "Damian: Well, I don't see how anyone gets hurt by you taking classes and getting your degree.",
        "Luke: Well, what about the kid out there who worked really hard to get into college? Whose place I'd take?",
        "Damian: Come on, if it's not you it'll be someone they want on the football team. That's h it works.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that doesn't mean its right.",
        "Damian: No, it doesn't mean its right. But this isn't the really, uh, the most important issue here, is it?",
        "Luke: What is?",
        "Damian: How do you feel about going back to school?",
        "Luke: Everyone says I should go.",
        "Damian: Well, what do you think?",
        "Luke: Well, I guess I agree. I mean, I probably should go.",
        "Damian: Yeah. Well, is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Uh, sure, I can meet this afternoon. What time?",
        "Johnny: Daddy, can I go sit with Parker and Sage?",
        "Craig: Uh, Ed, can you hold on just a moment? We have to ask and make sure it's okay for us, all right? Hey, guys.",
        "Rosanna: Hello.",
        "Craig: Hi, Johnny would like to sit with you. Do you mind?",
        "Rosanna: No, not at all.",
        "Craig: Great.",
        "Rosanna: Come on.",
        "Craig: Go ahead. Go ahead. Don't forget your cars.",
        "Rosanna: I'll take your cars. Yeah? I can take this one, right? Yeah, oh, you got it.",
        "Craig: Sorry about that, Ed. No, that's fine. I should tell you though, that Carly Tenney won't be with me today. No, no, everything's fine. She just needs to finish up another project. I know you like her work, so do I. And I want you to know that we intend to deliver everything that she promised. Uh, well, I'm sure we'll figure that out when we get together. Okay, we'll see you soon, thanks. What?",
        "Rosanna: Business problems?",
        "Craig: Uh, I hope not. We have a pretty big deal going with this guy, Ed Lazarus, and I'm not sure I can close it myself.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, I'm sure if you just whip out the old Montgomery charm --",
        "Craig: Yeah, it doesn't seem to work with him. He's a bit of a ladies' man.",
        "Rosanna: Ah, well, then you do have a problem, don't you? I know that look. What?",
        "Craig: Nothing. I was just wondering -- what are you doing this afternoon?",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on. Come on. Come on.",
        "Rosanna: Forget it.",
        "Craig: I could really use your help at the meeting.",
        "Rosanna: No way, Craig. There's no way I'm going anywhere with you.",
        "Craig: Come on, is it really that much to ask you to fill in for your sister?",
        "Rosanna: Um, no, actually not if anybody else was asking. But haven't you figured out by now that the farther you and I stay away from each other, the better it is for everyone?",
        "Craig: I thought we made a pretty good team when we convinced Carly to go to rehab.",
        "Rosanna: What shocks me is that you think you can't close a business deal by yourself.",
        "Craig: Like I said. This guy was really into Carly. So I don't know how to explain to him that she won't be working on our vitamin water project for a while.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then I really don't know what difference it would make if I was there? I mean, obviously, he's going to see I'm not Carly.",
        "Craig: Clearly. But you're smart, you're experienced in business. So, it couldn't hurt. And you'd be doing something really good for Carly. If she knew that she'd have a whole new source of income waiting for her when she gets out of rehab. Something she could count on --",
        "Rosanna: Hmm. I just don't think that you and I should be doing anything together.",
        "Craig: Fine. Forget I asked. I'll handle it myself.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I, um, I hope I don't regret this, but I'm gonna go with you.",
        "Craig: What changed your mind?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I want Carly to have her own life when she gets back.",
        "Craig: So do I.",
        "Rosanna: I want her to be able to dump you.",
        "Craig: Well, that's where you and I -- diverge.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: But we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Is there a restaurant near where we're going to meet this Lazarus person?",
        "Craig: We're meeting in a restaurant. Why?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, good, that's great. Because I gotta feed the kids.",
        "Craig: Can they watch Johnny?",
        "Rosanna: I don't see why not.",
        "Craig: Great. I really do appreciate this.",
        "Rosanna: I'm doing it for my sister, not you.",
        "Craig: Of course.",
        "Parker: Hey, can we get something to eat already? We're starving.",
        "Rosanna: I thought you said you weren't hungry. Hey, don't worry about it, there's been a change of plans though. Um, we're going to go to Chicago.",
        "Sage: Why?",
        "Rosanna: Because I have some business to take care of for your mom, and I thought maybe you guys could to do me a favor and take care of Johnny.",
        "Parker: Can we just get something to eat first?",
        "Rosanna: Well, don't worry, there's a restaurant near where we're going. But I have soy nuts and tofu crackers in my bag. So you can kind of munch on them in the car, okay?",
        "Parker: Oh.",
        "Rosanna: I'm joking.",
        "Parker: Yeah, we got that.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, if we're going to hang out, you're gotta have to work on learning my sense of humor here.",
        "Parker: Oh, we will, as soon as we see it.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, okay. All right, I deserved that. But next time -- I'm gonna getcha. Come on guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hello. Hi, Dean Brewster.",
        "Dean Brewster: Hello, how are you?",
        "Lily: Lovely to see you.",
        "Dean Brewster: Good to see you.",
        "Lily: You remember my husband, Holden Snyder.",
        "Dean Brewster: Of course.",
        "Holden: Good to see you again.",
        "Lily: Mother. Thank you so much for coming over. I know you're a very busy man.",
        "Dean Brewster: Well, it's the least I could do. Your family has done so much for the university.",
        "Lucinda: The dean and I have discussed the Luke situation. And I have let him know that we all in agreement that at the time, Luke deserved to be expelled. However, we feel that he's worked so, so hard to make up for his lapses, that he's ready -- he's ready to be a member of the community and have a wonderful educational experience.",
        "Holden: And we understand that this is a sensitive situation for you. We're not trying to pressure you in any way whatsoever.",
        "Lucinda: Of course, if we are, we don't mind.",
        "Dean Brewster: The truth is, your son has committed a serious offense. He violated the university's code of ethics.",
        "Holden: He understands that. And he has regretted it since it happened.",
        "Lily: That's why he threw himself into his work with the foundation. I'm sure my mother has told you all about that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, absolutely. Allen is very aware of the many groups that have been helped by Luke, despite his earlier mistake.",
        "Lily: That's right. All he's asking for is a second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Forget about everyone else and just tell me if going to school is what you think you should be doing right now.",
        "Luke: Well, that is the million dollar question, isn't it?",
        "Damian: Yes, it is.",
        "Luke: I don't know the answer.",
        "Damian: I think you do.",
        "Luke: When I think about going back to school -- I think about the papers, I think about the deadlines, I think about the classes. And honestly, it feels kind of like a chore. Like, I'm really afraid that I'd just be going through the motions.",
        "Damian: Then why do it?",
        "Luke: Don't let my parents hear you say that.",
        "Damian: I'm not talking to your parents, I'm talking to you.",
        "Luke: You really don't think that I should go back to school?",
        "Damian: I think you have to want it, otherwise, it'll be just like you said, a chore. I mean, do you really want to start something you might not be able to finish?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but if I don't go back to college, I don't know what I'd do instead.",
        "Damian: What about the foundation?",
        "Luke: Oh, the foundation. The foundation is great. But it's set up. You know? They don't need me here every day. And I thought it would be awesome to work on that movie with Noah, but he's kind of doing that without me now, so.",
        "Damian: Hey, get a job!",
        "Luke: Who would hire me?",
        "Damian: Oh, come on, there are plenty of businesses that could find a place for someone who's proven himself as a manager.",
        "Luke: Uh, yeah, but I've never been interested in business.",
        "Damian: You weren't interested in running a foundation, either. But you've done a great job, and, I would guess, learn a lot in the process.",
        "Luke: Yeah. It was a challenge.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well that's what I'm talking about. The kind of experience I'm talking about. Taking on challenges, meeting them. Finding out what you can do. How far you can go. You know, seeking your own way, not just following a path laid down by somebody else.",
        "Luke: But, Damian, in this economy, who would hire me?",
        "Damian: I know I shouldn't be saying this. Your father will blame me for luring you away from college, and your mother would probably agree with him.",
        "Luke: Because we're talking?",
        "Damian: Because it's always been my dream that one day you'll join me in the family business.",
        "Luke: The family bus -- you mean, the Grimaldi Shipping lines? Did you just offer me a job?",
        "Damian: I desperately need someone I can trust. During that oil spill, I had no one I could count on, the possibility was sabotage. Who better to have at my side than my own son? What's the matter?",
        "Luke: Nothing. It's just we've never really talked about me working for you.",
        "Damian: Well, because I never thought you'd be interested. And I always knew how your parents would react, so I never brought it up.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it's my life, not theirs.",
        "Damian: I know. Does that mean you'd be interested? You'd consider it? Would you want to work with me?",
        "Luke: I don't know anything about shipping.",
        "Damian: Don't worry, you'll learn about the business from the bottom up. But, of course, I would love to get you involved in strategic decisions and special projects.",
        "Luke: Kind of like on-the-job training?",
        "Damian: Exactly. And you said you always wanted to travel. Shipping is the original global industry. Our ships go everywhere in the world.",
        "Luke: Yeah, that sounds kind of cool. But how long would I have to be gone for?",
        "Damian: Well, that depends on what you're doing.",
        "Luke: Oh.",
        "Damian: But if you're concerned about Noah, there's no reason why he couldn't go with you. I mean, filmmaking isn't the kind of job where you have to stay in one place. And think about all the exotic locations he could be using.",
        "Luke: Oh, that sounds awesome.",
        "Damian: Mm-hmm. You'll be sharing the great adventure.",
        "Luke: That sounds like fun. Definitely more fun than sitting in a classroom at O.U.",
        "Damian: And you'll probably be learning a lot more than that. And one day, if you like this shipping business, you could take over the company.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Damian: I always wanted to be able to hand it down to you, Luke, and then to your sons.",
        "Luke: If I ever have sons, you know they're not going to be out of a traditional marriage.",
        "Damian: Hey, I just want you to be happy, Luciano. In your life, and in your work.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Luke: I have to take it, it's my grandmother. Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Dean Brewster is here in your home. Right now.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Lucinda: Well, where the hell are you, Darling? Your mother and Holden and I, we've been singing your praises, but he's really got to hear from you personally.",
        "Luke: I'll come as soon as I can.",
        "Lucinda: Now, Luke. This is your best chance. And he's got to see that you want so much to go back to school.",
        "Luke: I know. I'll be there soon.",
        "Lucinda: Good. I'll see ya.",
        "Luke: I have to go.",
        "Damian: Will you think about my offer?",
        "Luke: Of course.",
        "Damian: And you should listen to this dean as well.",
        "Luke: I will.",
        "Damian: Hey, don't take this lightly, okay? This could be the most important decision you ever make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: We should not be here.",
        "Rosanna: Why not?",
        "Sage: Daddy said he doesn't want us to be around Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you're not here with Craig, you're here with me.",
        "Sage: But Craig's here, too.",
        "Rosanna: But Craig's here for a business meeting. You guys are looking after Johnny.",
        "Parker: Let's just order something to eat before I pass out.",
        "Rosanna: Ah, yes. That's a very good idea. Excuse me, um, hi. When you have a minute.",
        "Teri: Uh, sure, yeah. Hey, kids.",
        "Rosanna: This is Parker and Sage. They're going to be dining by themselves, with a little boy named Johnny, who is in the bathroom. I was wondering maybe if you could help me out and kind of keep an eye on them a little bit for me?",
        "Parker: I can look after myself.",
        "Sage: Yeah, and so can I.",
        "Teri: Uh, don't worry. I won't let them set anything on fire.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, thank you so much. See you guys later, okay?",
        "Teri: You know, you're named after my favorite herb?",
        "Sage: Really?",
        "Teri: Yep, totally. Where you guys from?",
        "Parker: Uh, Oakdale.",
        "Teri: Really?",
        "Parker: Have you been there?",
        "Teri: Nope.",
        "Craig: Okay, pit stop over. Is Lazarus here?",
        "Rosanna: How should I know.",
        "Craig: I don't see him. Hey, Johnny, why don't you go sit with Sage and Parker, right there? Well, there he is. Hello, Ed. Good to see you. Uh, this is Rosanna, Carly's sister. Unfortunately, Carly couldn't make it with us today.",
        "Lazarus: My pleasure.",
        "Rosanna: Nice to meet you.",
        "Craig: Excuse me, do you mind if we take this table?",
        "Teri: Sure.",
        "Craig: Thank you. You just follow my lead. I'll get us through this.",
        "Sage: I can't read this.",
        "Teri: It's in French.",
        "Parker: Where does it say cheeseburger and fries?",
        "Teri: Uh, I don't think your mom would approve of that.",
        "Parker: Oh, she's not our mom, she's our aunt. Our mother's in --",
        "Sage: Europe.",
        "Teri: Really? Where is she?",
        "Parker: No, she's not. Why are you lying?",
        "Sage: Can we just order.",
        "Teri: Why don't you leave that to me?",
        "Craig: We've got everything set up, which means we're piggybacking on the vodka business until the vitamin water can generate its own revenue stream.",
        "Rosanna: Can I say --",
        "Craig: We estimate that will take about six months, at which point we'll be ready for your investment, and we can begin diversifying the line.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me. Can I see the financials please?",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: The financials. I'd like to get up to speed on the project.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: Sorry. Can I talk to you for a minute, please?",
        "Craig: Now?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, now.",
        "Craig: Ed, order yourself a drink. This won't take long.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse us.",
