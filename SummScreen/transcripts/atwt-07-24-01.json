        "\r\nCraig: Oh!\u00a0 But since you're down there --",
        "\r\nCarly: Craig!",
        "\r\nCraig: I couldn't resist.\u00a0 What?",
        "\r\nCarly: I just can't risk being seen with you.\u00a0 If Jack finds out, if anybody\r\n\r\nfinds out --",
        "\r\nCraig: Well, you have a lot more to worry about than Jack at the moment.",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh, I wish I could just be reading about you in the newspaper, that\r\n\r\nmaybe we could just be a passing acquaintance or something, you know?",
        "\r\nCraig: We're star-crossed, Carly.\u00a0 What do you want?",
        "\r\nCarly: The only reason I am here and in trouble yet again is because of\r\n\r\nyou.\u00a0 Paul Ryan is on the warpath.\u00a0 He says all he's doing is protecting his\r\n\r\nmother, but for some -- some reason, that means trashing me in the process.",
        "\r\nDo you know what he's telling everybody?\u00a0 He's telling everybody that I am\r\n\r\nyour mistress.",

        "\r\nCarly: This is actually pretty serious!\u00a0 I would like this rumor squashed\r\n\r\nbefore it gets out of hand.\u00a0 And if he wants to drag you name through the mud,\r\n\r\nthat's just fine with me.\u00a0 But why do I have to be any part of it?!",
        "\r\nCraig: It's too late for that now.\u00a0 Barbara has bought her baby's little rumor\r\n\r\nabout us being in cahoots.\u00a0 Actually, they're spinning a tale to the police now.",

        "\r\nCraig: Barbara won't be content just trying to ruin my life.\u00a0 She wants\r\n\r\nyours, too. \r\n"
