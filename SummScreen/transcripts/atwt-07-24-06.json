        "While talking to Lucinda about Luke's accident, Holden admits he blamed Luke for Lily's fall. Lucinda defends the feelings he had. Damian presses Luke to move to Malta with him, but Luke worries what will happen if his family needs him in the meantime; Damian plays Luke about how his family would want him happy. When Lucinda calls Luke, Damian answers and won't let her talk to him. Simon wants Carly to partner with him, but Carly tells him to take a flying leap. Simon continues to work her when he tells her he has a job for her to redecorate an apartment building he just bought. Casey finds a murdered Lia in the shower (think Psycho scene), and immediately calls his mom for help. Margo questions him and worries to Tom that their son is the only suspect they have. Maddie wonders how something happened when Eve wonders where she has been all night? Maddie claims to have been out walking around since she couldn't sleep, but Eve is concerned she ran right to the shower when she came home. Margo comes looking for Maddie to question her about Lia's death. Carly relents and takes Simon up on his job offer so she can prove to Jack she can be independent from him. Lucinda and Damian have it out, which Luke overhears and then comes to Damian's defense. Carly tells Katie and Mike she accepted Simon's offer for a job. Maddie recalls seeing Casey and Lia together in the shower area of the country club the night Lia was murdered, but when she is pressed about where she was last night, she tells Margo she was home all night."

        "Lucinda: Lucy said -- she promised that she would call us if anything happened at the hospital, so --",
        "Holden: You know what, this is -- it's not about Lily.",
        "Lucinda: What is it?",
        "Holden: It's about Luke. I got into it with him again last night.",
        "Lucinda: About what?",
        "Holden: Damian bought him a new car. [Lucinda scoffs] He got drunk. He had an accident.",
        "Lucinda: Is he okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, he's fine. Just a few scrapes and bruises. But he is in big trouble with the cops.",
        "Lucinda: Why? Why would Luke drink again? He knows better. He does.",
        "Holden: He's confused.",
        "Lucinda: Thanks to Damian.",
        "Holden: No, it's not all Damian's fault. He thinks I blame him for Lily's fall.",
        "Lucinda: That's absurd.",
        "Holden: No, it's not absurd. He's right. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Luke, you spoke of a new start, far away from Oakdale. Have you thought more about coming back to Malta with me?",
        "Luke: Yeah, a little bit. But with Mom still in the hospital, if something should happen --",
        "Damian: You'd be a few hours away from home with my jet at your disposal. There are great schools in Paris and London -- places where every lifestyle is embraced. Plus, you'll have a home with me, a home that will be yours someday.",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds really cool, Damian, but my home is here with my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Good morning, Carly.",
        "Carly: Simon.",
        "Simon: You -- you looking for something?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- yes, I was here pretty late last night, I think I may have dropped my cell phone. Close encounter with steel wool.",
        "Simon: Ouch. What, is Lisa short-staffed?",
        "Carly: No. No, it's the going rate for a half-decent bottle of champagne. I ordered it to celebrate my new partnership. Before I knew that my new partner was you.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, I do realize that was partially my fault.",
        "Carly: Partially?",
        "Simon: So, as a result out of the goodness of my heart, I'm gonna spring for that. I'm gonna pay for that bottle of champagne.",
        "Carly: Too late.",
        "Simon: Fair enough. So, listen, did you have a little think about the chat we had? Because, you know, without a real investor --",
        "Carly: No, no, no, stop right there.",
        "Simon: --To get your design firm off the ground --",
        "Carly: I'm not even listening to you. Can't hear you. Don't hear you.",
        "Simon: You are out of options. Unless, of course, you've got a rich old aunt somewhere on life support.",
        "Carly: Hey, Simon, unless you want to be on life support, I suggest you mind your own business and stay out of mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Lia? Come on, we've got to go. The morning maintenance shift's gonna be coming on soon. Lia, shut the water -- oh, my God. Oh, my God. [Lia's was stabbed to death \"Psycho style\" blood is all over the stall]",

        "[Phone rings]",
        "Margo: Detective Hughes.",
        "Casey: Mom?",
        "Margo: That's Detective Mom to you. What's up? What are you doing up so early? Case? Casey, you still there?",
        "Casey: I'm here.",
        "Margo: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Casey: I'm at the club.",
        "Margo: At Crash?",
        "Casey: No. The country club.",
        "Margo: What are you doing at the country club?",
        "Casey: She's dead, Mom.",
        "Margo: What? What did you say?",
        "Casey: Lia's dead.",
        "Margo: Case? Casey, are you still there?",
        "Casey: Mom --",
        "Margo: Reynolds, I want you get an ambulance over to the Oakdale Country Club now! Okay, Casey, an ambulance is on the way.",
        "Casey: It's too late for an ambulance.",
        "Margo: Did you take a pulse?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Margo: You gotta do that Casey.",
        "Casey: I can't, Mom.",
        "Margo: Yes, you can. I'll talk you through it. Don't disturb the body. Don't move the body in any way, but gently place two fingers on the side of her neck.",
        "Casey: Mom --",
        "Margo: You gotta do it, Casey. Gently place two fingers on the side of her neck.",
        "Casey: There's so much blood --",
        "Margo: You can do this. Do you feel anything?",
        "Casey: No, nothing.",
        "Margo: Then stand back. Do not touch the body. Help is on the way, Honey. They'll be there any minute, okay? You stay on the line with me, okay, Honey? Casey? Casey?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: How did this happen? How?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Good morning.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. How long you been out here? When did you start?",
        "Mike: Right before sun-up. I mean, can you believe it? A conman like Simon Frasier ends up striking oil?",
        "Katie: I know. There's no justice in this world. But he's here and we're gonna have to learn how to deal with it.",
        "Mike: How?",
        "Katie: He knows I'm a lost cause. He'll move on.",
        "Mike: After how many detours of him running into you accidentally on purpose?",
        "Katie: Well, Every detour would lead to a dead end. Believe me.",
        "Mike: Well, I like the dead part. Can I get that in writing?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. And I'll seal it with a kiss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Oh, hey --",
        "Carly: The answer is still no.",
        "Simon: If you think this has got something to do with me and Katie, you're wrong. What's it going to take for me to prove that to you?",
        "Carly: You could leave town?",
        "Simon: You've got a lot to learn about business, Carly.",
        "Carly: You have a lot to learn about friendship, Simon.",
        "Simon: Well, Carly, a real friend wouldn't want you washing pots and pans to pay for a measly bottle of domestic champagne. Next thing is, you'll be losing your house.",
        "Carly: I am not going to lose my house.",
        "Simon: Well, you have no money, no clients, and oh yeah, no investors. And a resume that says, \"hey, I want to be an interior designer, but you know what, you're gonna have to trust me on that.\"",
        "Carly: For the last time, Simon, I am not taking your money.",
        "Simon: Well, good, because I'm not offering money. I'm offering you a job. One that's gonna keep your hands dry and your mortgage paid. So tell me, does that not just sound a little bit interesting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I don't believe it. I don't believe that you told Luke that he was responsible for Lily's accident.",
        "Holden: Not in so many words --",
        "Lucinda: Not in any words.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, I was angry -- because I told him over and over again, no arguments, not to stress Lily out.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, can one can be a mother and not be stressed?",
        "Holden: When Luke came out, it was so crazy at the house.",
        "Lucinda: And then Damian came into town.",
        "Holden: When he told me about Lily's fall, I was angry, and I did not want to deal with him.",
        "Lucinda: Did you yell at him?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Lucinda: Did you tell the kid you don't love him any more?",
        "Holden: Of course not. But he could tell I was worried that he might make things worse for Lily. I didn't let him sit with her that night. I sent him home.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, because he'd had a hell of a day. And you were doing it for his own good.",
        "Holden: Maybe, but he knew I didn't want him there. I pushed him away. And now, I can't get through to him. Now, I can't help him out.",
        "Lucinda: I don't care how many times you tell me all the mistakes you have made with this boy. I am so grateful and I thank God every day that you raised this boy.",
        "Holden: Yeah well, I'm not so sure Luke feels the same way.",
        "Lucinda: You are the best father the kid could have asked for.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I can't help him if he doesn't let me in. How am I going to make it so that I can get close to him again?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I can give you a first step. You've got to rid yourself of Damian and Damian's influence. Then the boy will probably spontaneously come home again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Luke, I'm not trying to separate you from your family.",
        "Luke: It's just not a good time.",
        "Damian: Boys not much older than you leave for college, travel, even join the military. It's part of growing up.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but this is different.",
        "Damian: Because of your mother?",
        "Luke: Yea.",
        "Damian: Lily wouldn't want you to put your life on hold. Besides, it's a trip to Europe, not forever.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but what about my dad and my sisters?",
        "Damian: What about you, Luke, and your happiness?",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Damian: You're not fine, Luke. Uh-uh. It's time to make some hard choices. Time to find a place that may not be the home you're used to, but a place where you can finally feel like you can be yourself.",
        "Luke: That does sound nice.",
        "Damian: Holden and Lily love you very much. They want you happy, no matter where you may be. Come to Malta with me. What do you have to lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Here, baby, drink this, okay? All right? You think you can talk now? What were you and Lia doing in the club after hours?",
        "Casey: She thought it'd be cool to sneak in and go for a swim. I didn't want to, but I didn't have anything else to do, so -- and then when we got done swimming, I was ready to go, but she wanted to take a shower.",
        "Margo: The locker rooms were open?",
        "Casey: No, we found a window that wasn't latched. I know, Mom, I know it was stupid idea and I was trying to get her to leave, but she wouldn't. So I split and I just went and listened to music.",
        "Margo: Where? Where'd you go?",
        "Casey: The car. And after a while, I came back in because she was taking forever and I came in to get her to leave with me. And then --",
        "Margo: And that's when you found her?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: How long were you gone?",
        "Casey: I don't know.",
        "Margo: Five, ten minutes? More?",
        "Casey: I don't know, Mom. I listened to one of my play lists.",
        "Margo: Good, good. How many songs?",
        "Casey: Eight, maybe? I can check.",
        "Margo: It's important, Casey.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'll check then. I mean, it couldn't have been that long, 'cause I figured she'd get bored and come out.",
        "Margo: All right. Did you see anybody here?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Margo: A maintenance man, a groundskeeper.",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Margo: Were there any cars in the parking lot?",
        "Casey: No, Mom.",
        "Margo: Okay. Okay, so you went back into the shower? How did you get -- the window, okay.",
        "Casey: No, when I went out to my car, I left the door unlocked.",
        "Margo: Okay, walk this through one more time for you.",
        "Casey: I already did.",
        "Margo: I know, just do it again, Honey.",
        "Casey: I called her name. And the only thing I could hear was the water splashing in the shower. So I called her name again even louder, nothing. So I went in, and she was lying in the shower. And when I shut the water off, I could see that she wasn't --",
        "Margo: It's okay. It's okay. It's all right, its okay.",
        "Tom: Hey, I got your message. What happened?",
        "Margo: Lia was found murdered in the shower.",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Margo: Yeah, Casey found her.",
        "Tom: Are you okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah --",
        "Tom: Where were you when this happened?",
        "Margo: He was waiting in the car.",
        "Casey: Mom, can I wash my hands now?",
        "Margo: Yeah, Baby, go wash your hands. The men's room outside of the manager's office.",
        "Tom: Do you want me to go with you? What on earth is going on down here, and what the hell is that kid doing out in the middle of the night?",
        "Margo: That's a lecture for another day, Tom.",
        "Tom: So, he was in the car?",
        "Margo: Yes. But unfortunately, nobody saw him there, not the greatest alibi.",
        "Tom: So how did this young girl die?",
        "Margo: Multiple stab wounds.",
        "Tom: He didn't see anybody coming or going?",
        "Margo: No. Looks like we've just got to face it. As of now, our son is the only suspect I've got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Look, talk to the late shift. I want to know what they saw, if anything. Then go to the club manager, ask him for a list of people that might have keys or access to this building. I want to know if anybody saw those kids last night.",
        "Cop: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Maddie, where on earth have you been? I have been worried sick. You're lucky I didn't call the cops to go out looking for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Don't get me wrong, I would love to drop kick Damian back to Malta, but that is not going to happen.",
        "Lucinda: Why not?",
        "Holden: Last night, I tried to tell him to stay away from my family and Luke jumped in to defended him.",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course he did. Damian's buying him cars and drinks and God knows what else?",
        "Holden: No, no, it's more than that. The night that Lily fell -- Damian knew Luke felt rejected, and he saw an opening. Luke now has a friend, an ally.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, you've reached your objective. I think I can deal with that. I'm sure I can come up with a way to get Damian out of the picture.",
        "Holden: What are you going to do?",
        "Lucinda: Well, Mitchell Larson at the state department, I could make a phone call.",
        "Holden: No, no, don't. Luke has found somebody to lean on right now, and I don't want to take that from him. I don't know how he'll react.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Is it my turn? Should Grandmother have a chat with him? Somebody's got to keep reminding him that this family needs him as much as he needs us right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Even if everything was okay with my mom, I doubt that she and my dad would want me traveling with you.",
        "Damian: That would be short-sighted on their part, Luke. A young man needs to see the world. And if Holden weren't so overwhelmed by his own problems right now, he would realize that. Look, he's a good father. He loves you very much. I don't deny that. But he hasn't seen how you've outgrown this town, your friends and schoolmates. So make that clear to him. No matter how he resents me, he wants what's best for you.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Damian: He'll make noise at first, but perhaps, in a way, it will be a relief to know that you're well taken care of and happy. Look, we don't have to decide anything now. Let me check with that Sergeant and see if they're ready to release you.",
        "Luke: Thanks.",
        "Damian: Excuse me, my son's been here all night, and I was told he'd be released in the morning.",
        "Cop #3: The paperwork just came through. Here are his things. Check them against the voucher, and then sign out with the desk sergeant.",
        "Damian: All right, thank you, Officer. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Damian? Why are you answering Luke's phone? Where is he?",
        "Damian: Luke cannot answer the phone right now.",
        "Lucinda: I want you put him on the line immediately.",
        "Damian: I told you, he can't right now. We're still at the police station.",
        "Lucinda: Don't you lie to me, Damian.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry, Lucinda, you'll have to try later. Have a nice day.",
        "Lucinda: Damian!",
        "Damian: You're a free man. Hungry?",
        "Luke: I'm starving.",
        "Damian: Well, then let's get out of here and grab something to eat before we get home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're offering me a job?",
        "Simon: Yes.",
        "Carly: As what? Like a go-between? Like, I find ways for you to run into Katie on a regular basis? Is that it?",
        "Simon: No, no, see this -- no. See, I want you to design a fantastic lobby and interior units for this new apartment building I just bought downtown. The place is a mess. It's run down in years of decay. And I don't know much about real estate, but I know even less about colors and swatches. But it turns out I do a thing or two about turning a buck. A few million, actually.",
        "Carly: And you want me to help you turn them on this project?",
        "Simon: Bingo. Yes, yes, we're getting it now, yes.",
        "Carly: A woman with a credit history who made Mr. Oakdale N0ational go screaming for the exit?",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, unlike Mr. Oakdale National, I actually looked at your stuff, and I think you have talent and style. And I have a building in desperate need of both.",
        "Carly: Oh, you're good. You're very good. You're making this up as you go along.",
        "Simon: Oh, if I am, it's all true. I've got the paperwork to prove it. I've got all of the things with the right signatures, the right seals. It's a legitimate offer.",
        "Carly: Define legitimate, I mean, in Simon Frasier's native tongue.",
        "Simon: Carly, listen, if you don't want me to invest in you, so be it, but maybe I need you to invest in me. All right, yeah, that was really cheesy. Look, it's just a job. If you hate it, you quit.",
        "Carly: Simon, the world is full of rundown buildings with experienced designers. So why me? Why here? And why now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Dad, I --",
        "Tom: Casey, you know the drill. Tell the truth, let the cops figure out who did this.",
        "Casey: Dad, I don't get it, though. Why would anyone want to hurt Lia? She didn't do anything.",
        "Tom: No, she didn't.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, Baby. But I need you to you to give a statement now. Are you up for it?",
        "Dallas: Margo, you got a sec?",
        "Margo: Yeah, of course.",
        "Dallas: It's the coroner. He just got here.",
        "Margo: Oh, all right. Tell him I'll be right there. Um, I'm sorry. This is going to have to wait. I'll be right back.",
        "Tom: I'm staying with him.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Casey: Did Mom talk to you?",
        "Tom: Not much. Just told me what she knows so far.",
        "Casey: She doesn't believe me.",
        "Tom: That's not true.",
        "Casey: No, Dad. I can tell. She thinks I did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Walt.",
        "Walt: Margo. Who covered the body?",
        "Margo: My son.",
        "Walt: Wish he hadn't.",
        "Margo: Yeah, me too.",
        "Dallas: What have you got?",
        "Walt: The girl died of multiple stab wounds. The angle and the degree of the openings suggest a frontal assault. Defensive wounds on the arms, wrists. Bruising to the shoulder and pretty nasty bleeder at the base of the skull. She put up a hell of a fight.",
        "Margo: Did you find the weapon?",
        "Dallas: No, not yet. But I've got men combing the grounds, going through every dumpster, every square inch of this place.",
        "Margo: Good.",
        "Walt: We'll have to be back at the lab to be sure, but my guess, it was a butcher knife, long blade, 8 to 10 inches.",
        "Margo: What was happening?",
        "Casey: Maddie, she was taking it out on the car.",
        "Dallas: Hey, you okay?",
        "Margo: Find that knife, Dallas.",
        "Dallas: Okay.",

        "Eve: You do not get to ignore me, young lady.",
        "Maddie: If I wanted this kind of abuse, I'd go back with Mom.",
        "Eve: Where have you been?",
        "Maddie: Out, okay? I was out. I woke up early, and I went for a walk. Is that a crime?",
        "Eve: Maddie, I got up at 3:00 and checked your room. You weren't there. Didn't you learn anything from the last time you snuck out?",
        "Maddie: Just leave me alone, Eve.",
        "Eve: I have left you alone far too long. I want to know who you were with and what you were doing.",
        "Maddie: I told you, I went for a walk.",
        "Eve: Then Honey, why do you look like you are about ready to cry? Please, Honey, I know something happened. Tell me. And I want the truth this time.",

        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",

        "Casey: And mine's all over the place.",
        "Tom: Nobody's going to let you get implicated for doing something that you didn't do. Now, if your mom seems scared, it's because she hates that you had to go through something like this. And so do I. Finding a murder victim -- it's something that sticks with you for awhile.",

        "Lucinda: You can talk about stability after what you put us all through in Malta? With your mother and with the crazy intrigues and inbred political strife that nearly killed the kid when he was little.",
        "Damian: Which is why I kept a safe distance for so many years, Lucinda. Until the danger had passed.",
        "Lucinda: No, you are the danger.",

        "Lucinda: I think you love to control \"your son.\" But he's smart.
