        "Craig: And when you were working towards that MBA, did you even encounter the words \"Due diligence\"? Do you know how many millions you could have cost this company in legal fees, in lost production time, in man hours -- not to mention the tax liabilities?",
        "Employee: I apologize, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Your apology is not accepted. You will fix this. And for every hour it takes you to fix this, I will deduct $100 from your salary.",
        "Employee: $100 an hour? I don't make anywhere near that.",
        "Craig: Well, then I suggest that you do this fast. Or you can quit.",
        "Employee: I'll fix it, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: See that you do that. Out. You're frowning. I guess you heard.",
        "Meg: Enough to be thankful I'm not working for you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, if you decide to keep the company, you won't be working for me. You'll be working for you.",
        "Meg: Well, I would still have answer to the board of directors and to the shareholders.",
        "Craig: You've been studying.",
        "Meg: I've been wasting my time, imagining me, Meg Snyder, as CEO of Worldwide Enterprises.",
        "Craig: Or you can keep the name Montgomery Enterprises. I think it's got a great ring to it.",
        "Meg: Well, you know, by the time I learn enough to do any good, I'm sure the company would be bankrupt.",
        "Craig: Now, first lesson, it's not actually a company. It's a corporation.",
        "Meg: People would be out of work, factories will close, towns would die.",
        "Craig: Cities would collapse, universes would collide. And generations from now would ponder -- indeed, if there were any generations left to ponder after this cataclysm -- who is responsible for this? They would all point to you. It's Meg Snyder's fault.",
        "Meg: And they'd be right. Keep the company, Craig. I can't do this.",
        "Craig: You can't?",
        "Meg: I don't want to do this.",
        "Craig: What do you want to do?",
        "Meg: I want my life to mean something. I want my work to mean something. Yelling at employees and learning about profit margins and pretax income margins, it's not me.",
        "Craig: Have a seat.",
        "Meg: It's not going to work, Craig. You can't talk me into this.",
        "Craig: You're going to talk yourself into this. Relax. This might take a while.",
        "Meg: I don't want to do this, do you hear me?",
        "Craig: All right, there is a high-powered corporate executive inside of you and she's waiting to come out. Sit.",

        "Pam: The perfect ending to what has otherwise been a horrific day.",
        "Vienna: Oh, it was my pleasure.",
        "Pam: Have you been doing massage long?",
        "Vienna: As a business? No. But I've been studying it my whole life.",
        "Pam: Well, you certainly have found your calling.",
        "Vienna: Oh, calling. Oh. Oh, oh, my God, Henry. Oh, Darling.",
        "Henry: Oh, hey. Sorry, I fell asleep.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I forgot you were waiting.",
        "Henry: Well, it's worth the wait, Sweetie. Me, too. Hi.",
        "Pam: I don't believe we've met.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, this is my new client, Pam. Pam, this is my Henry.",
        "Henry: Hi. I don't mean to interrupt there at all.",
        "Pam: Oh, no, we were done. Do you work and live in this suite? That must make things difficult.",
        "Vienna: Yes, we've been looking for a bigger place.",
        "Henry: Yeah, she's gotten so successful, she already needs to expand.",
        "Vienna: He's proud of me.",
        "Henry: That I am, indeed. But it's hard to find someplace that's suitable and reasonable as well, you know?",
        "Pam: Well, isn't this lucky? I have the perfect place for you two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: I don't like this place.",
        "Ava: Get over there and sit down.",
        "J.J.: But why did you take me here? What are you -- what are you going to do?",
        "Silas: We don't want to hurt you, Kid. We just want the key. It was supposed to be in the music box and it's not. We need to find out why.",
        "J.J.: Well, I don't know why. I don't know anything about this key. I just want to go home.",
        "Ava: Okay, sit down.",
        "Silas: Ava, take it easy on the kid.",
        "Ava: The kid needs to do what he's told.",
        "J.J.: Are we in Oakdale still?",
        "Ava: You know what? If you're getting any ideas about that cop tracking us here, forget about it.",
        "Silas: As soon as Snyder gives us the key, we'll let you go.",
        "J.J.: What if my dad doesn't have the key?",
        "Silas: The cop was playing dumb with us on the phone. Like he didn't know what I was talking about.",
        "Ava: But you're sure he's got it, right?",
        "Silas: He just doesn't want to hand it over. Don't worry, I've got a lot of ways to make that detective change his mind.",

        "Carly: What does he want? Where's J.J.?",
        "Katie: You've got to call the station. Put out an Amber Alert.",
        "Jack: I didn't -- I didn't recognize his voice, did you?",
        "Carly: No, it wasn't familiar to me.",
        "Jack: What about background noises? Anything that could help us with",
        "Carly: Oh, God, no, I wasn't even listening for that.",
        "Jack: What exactly did he tell you the first time he called?",
        "Carly: He asked for you.",
        "Jack: For Jack? For Mr. Snyder?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I think he said Detective Snyder.",
        "Jack: You're sure?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- yes.",
        "Katie: Are we even sure he has J.J.?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes, because he put J.J. on the phone long enough for him to say that they want some key.",
        "Jack: He said \"They\"? So the kidnapper's not working alone?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Right, because J.J. got the phone and he said, \"Mom, they want a key.\" And I asked him if he was okay, but then the guy must have taken the phone, because he didn't answer me. And he just said that J.J. was fine.",
        "Jack: That's exactly what he told me, too. He said that J.J. was fine.",
        "Carly: What if he's not?",
        "Jack: Now Carly, the more details we have, the quicker it's going to be to find him, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Right, okay, so after he asked for Detective Snyder, what did you say?",
        "Carly: I told him that you don't live here anymore.",
        "Jack: What then?",
        "Carly: He said that I'd better find you because you have something that he wants.",
        "Katie: This key, whatever it is.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Right. And then he said that I better not make him mad. God, Jack, what if they hurt him?",
        "Jack: No, they're not going to hurt him. Hey, Carly, they're not going to hurt him. We're not going to let them. Because we are going to find him, okay? Calm down. Listen to me, what else did he say?",
        "Carly: He said that I had 20 minutes to find you and bring you back here to answer the phone or he didn't know what would happen.",
        "Katie: I don't understand. Do you guys know what this key is that's he's talking about?",
        "Jack: No, I have no idea what this key is.",
        "Carly: What do you mean you have no idea? If you don't know, then how are we going to get him back, Jack? You have to know what he's talking about!",
        "Katie: Maybe it's all just a mistake.",
        "Jack: It's not a mistake. He asked for me by name. Katie, he took my kid. Carly. Stop it.",
        "Carly: We've got to call him back. We have to tell them that we want him back! You have to get him back for me! You get him back!",
        "Jack: I will. I'll get him back.",

        "Meg: A poker game is not going to change my mind about keeping this company. I'm not doing it, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, this isn't a poker game. This is your life. Or rather, you life as Meg Snyder, CEO. I will stand in as your life Meg Snyder, atrocious waitress.",
        "Meg: I am not an atrocious waitress. Distracted, maybe, but not atrocious.",
        "Craig: Meg Snyder, atrocious waitress, loses one chip for self-delusion. Shall we begin?",
        "Meg: Can I stop you?",
        "Craig: So, there's a local disaster. I know. Local hospital burns down. What does Meg Snyder, atrocious waitress, do?",
        "Meg: Help them rebuild it. Why two?",
        "Craig: Well, you gotta buy a saw, hammer, nails --",
        "Meg: I already own a fully loaded tool kit.",
        "Craig: I stand corrected. So, what does Meg Snyder, CEO, do?",
        "Meg: Help them rebuild.",
        "Craig: How?",
        "Meg: Supplies, construction workers, equipment. I'm sure worldwide owns a couple bulldozers.",
        "Craig: I'm sure a couple.",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm. Okay, so how many chips is that?",
        "Craig: Okay, well, that would be -- one.",
        "Meg: Okay. That can't be right.",
        "Craig: Well, you see, with all the raw materials, the personnel, the eager lenders you have wanting to do business, you could finance a state of the art hospital and not even scratch your bottom line. You've got the chips, Meg. What do you want to do?",
        "Meg: I would love to start a literacy foundation.",
        "Craig: You already have one.",
        "Meg: I do?",
        "Craig: I see it is time to start a list.",
        "Meg: Okay, how many chips is it going to take to end world hunger?",
        "Craig: We'll look into that.",

        "Tom: Feeling better?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Tom: That headache, though, the one that made you sleep all the way from the prison?",
        "Margo: Well, that's still there, but, you know, I'll work through it.",
        "Tom: Even though you weren't scheduled to work tonight?",
        "Margo: It's duty. Duty calls.",
        "Tom: So I go out and get dinner, and you're not there when I come home.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I didn't leave a note, but, you know, I wasn't that hungry, so I wasn't going to eat.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, that happens every time we visit him. You don't eat. You don't sleep.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but I do up my meds, so are we done?",
        "Tom: And you don't talk to me. So how are we going to fix that one, Margo?",
        "Margo: Are we going to have a fight? Because this is not the time or the place.",
        "Tom: Okay. Let's make an appointment, okay? We'll set a time where you remember that you're my wife and we'll actually have a conversation.",
        "Margo: Wanna have a conversation? You wanna talk about how good Casey looked, because he didn't look good. He looked like he'd aged like what, five, six years. Or we could talk about, you know, how happy he was and how talkative he was --",
        "Tom: I know he wasn't happy.",
        "Margo: He didn't even smile. But what we can talk about -- we can talk about how the guards looked at us. The chief of detectives and the former D.A. coming to visit their son in prison.",
        "Tom: So you're terrified that one of them will slip. They'll mention to some perp that we put away that Casey's our son and they'll go after him?",
        "Margo: No, I'm terrified of what Casey's becoming. Because that man that we saw in prison, that's not our little boy anymore. That's not our Casey. And I don't think that we're ever going see that kid again. No, no, don't -- don't tell me that everything's going to be all right, because it won't be. It won't be, Tom. It just won't be.",

        "Pam: I'm a real estate agent.",
        "Vienna: Really?",
        "Henry: Oh, okay, Miss Dennison. I don't -- no offense, but I've talked to a lot of agents and I think I've seen every vacancy in town.",
        "Pam: Well, you haven't seen this one yet, because it's not on the market. It's still under construction.",
        "Henry: Great, well, call us when it's constructed.",
        "Pam: Oh, it's the perfect setting and layout for a spa.",
        "Vienna: Ooh, tell me all about it.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Sweetheart, Darling. Don't get too excited. It's not finished, yet.",
        "Pam: It's got space and light. Gorgeous views.",
        "Henry: Great, I can't wait to see them. As soon as there's something to see.",
        "Pam: Well, actually, there's a little bit of a problem. Someone else at my company is showing it to another client tomorrow. And I think they're going to sign the deal. If you want to see it, it's got to be tonight.",
        "Henry: Tonight? That's out of the question.",
        "Vienna: Oh please, Darling, what do we have to lose? I'm free and you're free. Let's go right now.",
        "Henry: Honey, Honey. Okay, okay, anything for you.",
        "Pam: Wonderful! Do you happen to have a flashlight? Because we're going to need it.",
        "Henry: This place doesn't have any lights yet? Vienna --",
        "Vienna: You know, Henry, he will find the perfect light. He's brilliant at everything. Now tell me all about the views and the spa. And oh, God. I'm having my own spa!",

        "Ava: Why do you keep looking at him like that?",
        "J.J.: Is he going to hurt my dad?",
        "Ava: Nobody's going to get hurt if he comes across with the damn key. Okay?",
        "J.J.: Please, leave my dad alone.",
        "Silas: Stop calling him your dad. Jack Snyder is not your dad. Your dad was Les Sweeney.",
        "J.J.: That's not true. He never acted like a real father. He beat my mother. And he killed her. Then Jack adopted me. He's my father.",
        "Silas: Les was your flesh and blood! Now you respect that, or I'll make you wish you had!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: These are the most recent pictures I have. They've been taken since I've been back.",
        "Jack: Okay. This one. He was wearing this shirt today.",
        "Katie: I thought you might want this.",
        "Carly: No, thank you. What's next?",
        "Jack: J.J. was still out at the farm when I left.",
        "Katie: Do you think that's where they grabbed him?",
        "Jack: Well, it was somewhere between here and there. Either way, I gotta get out there and start looking for clues.",
        "Carly: Yeah, let's go.",
        "Jack: No, I want you to stay here in case the kidnappers call back.",
        "Carly: And say what?",
        "Jack: Carly, you won't have to deal with them alone, okay? I'll call the station, I'll have them send over a crew. They'll put a trace on any calls. Katie, you come with me.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no, no, no. If anybody's going with you, Jack, it's gonna be me.",
        "Jack: Carly, if they call back, they're going to want to talk to a guardian.",
        "Carly: Jack, if he's left some kind of clue, I will see it. If there's evidence, if he's been hurt -- I need to know, Jack. Don't ask me to stay here and do nothing.",
        "Katie: What about Parker and Sage? Should we pick them up?",
        "Carly/Jack: No.",
        "Katie: I guess you already discussed this.",
        "Jack: No, we haven't. I'm just guessing that we want to keep this from Parker and Sage as long as we can. They're sleeping over at friends' houses.",
        "Carly: Maybe we'll have good news by morning.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm just here to help. Whatever you need me to do.",
        "Carly: Great. Well, why don't you stay here and wait for the police, while Jack and I go find our son.",

        "Meg: And I'm supposed to memorize all this?",
        "Meg: Yeah, and that took years.",
        "Craig: So we'll give you a couple of weeks. Relax, seriously. Anything you forget, you can look up. It's gonna be all right.",
        "Cleaning woman: I didn't know anybody was still here.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's okay. Can you come back later?",
        "Cleaning woman: Sure. Congratulations. I heard you two just got married. You make a great couple.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Good night.",
        "Craig: Why did you do that?",
        "Meg: She's an employee of the company. And unlike some tyrannical executives I know, my management style tends to be nice. You know, mean is so last millennium. You should try it.",
        "Craig: She thought we were married, Meg.",
        "Meg: We are.",
        "Craig: But we're planning on changing that. Aren't we?",

        "Margo: What do you want me to do, Tom? You want me to open a vein?",
        "Tom: I want you to come home. And I want to have dinner.",
        "Margo: I'm not gonna pretend.",
        "Tom: My grip on reality is just as strong as yours. I can see what's happening to Casey. But the only chance this kid has of coming out of this is us. If we lose each other, he's got nothing to come home to, and we let him down again.",
        "Margo: I just should've seen it coming. I knew he was in trouble.",
        "Tom: We raised him. We taught him. If we intend to save him, we have to do this together, including this hell where we visit him, we miss him, we hate what's happening to him -- because if we lose each other, we may lose Casey in the process. [Phone rings] Hey. Come home.",
        "Margo: Hughes. Yeah, yeah -- patch him through. Tom, Tom. Wait -- please. Just wait -- just let me take this, and then I will come home with you. Yeah.",
        "Jack: Margo.",
        "Margo: Jack, you know, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Can I get back to you?",
        "Jack: J.J.'s missing. I think he was kidnapped.",
        "Margo: When did this happen?",
        "Jack: Less than an hour ago.",
        "Margo: Where was he last seen?",
        "Jack: I guess at the farm, but -- that's where I saw him just before I left.",
        "Margo: Was anyone there with him?",
        "Jack: He was home alone. And I had to go. I had a date with Katie. But he was going to ride his bike out to Carly's.",
        "Margo: You sure that he was taken?",
        "Jack: We got a call.",
        "Margo: Ransom?",
        "Jack: Listen, can you send a team out to the house in Milltown so they can put a trace on the phone? I want to get out to the farm.",
        "Margo: Yeah, and I'll send forensics out there now.",
        "Jack: No, no. Let me go check it out first. I don't even know if he was taken from there -- maybe, maybe somewhere along the way?",
        "Margo: Jack, we're going to find him.",
        "Jack: Sage and Parker, they don't know about this yet.",
        "Margo: No, no. No press. Tom is here. And he can help with that. We'll handle this. Yeah.",
        "Tom: So listen, I'll call Kim. Maybe she can keep a handle on the press so nothing leaks. Amber alert?",
        "Margo: No, not yet. You know, I've got to get busy with this. I'm really glad that you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Margo's on her way?",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack, J.J.'s out there somewhere. If you ask me to stay here, I will just get in my car. I won't forgive myself.",
        "Jack: Okay, you're right. You are right. Will you please -- I think it's a good idea for you to come with me out to the farm, okay? So go grab a jacket. It looks like it's gonna be a long night.",
        "Carly: I'll be right back.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I know this has been rough on you. Thank you. Thank you for understanding.",
        "Katie: Hey, don't even think about me. We all need to do what we can for J.J. -- I just want to help. Just tell me what you need.",
        "Jack: What I need is a hug.",
        "Katie: He's going to be okay.",
        "Jack: Say it again.",
        "Katie: He's gonna be okay, Jack. He's such a smart kid, and he's yours. If there was any way to leave a clue, he would've left it. You just have to find it.",
        "Jack: And you're gonna stay here -- you're gonna wait for Margo, you're gonna fill her in?",
        "Katie: Absolutely. And just call me -- whenever you hear anything or find anything.",
        "Jack: I'm really sorry about tonight. Listen --",
        "Katie: No, don't even say a word about it. Honey, it's okay. Our engagement will happen when it happens -- when J.J.'s here to celebrate.",
        "Jack: I love you.",
        "Katie: It's okay.",

        "Vienna: Oh, Henry! Isn't it beautiful?",
        "Henry: How can you tell?",
        "Vienna: You remember the picnic we had that day by the river?",
        "Henry: Yeah, whipped cream, the chocolate syrup. I remember that.",
        "Vienna: Scenic Park. Isn't that around here?",
        "Pam: Oh, you'll have the perfect view of it from that window over there.",
        "Vienna: Henry, it's a sign. Can you shine the light over there? Oh, double sinks!",
        "J.J.: Help!",
        "Vienna: What was that? I heard someone yelling.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm sure it was the patron saint of homeowners screaming at us not to buy a pig in the poke or a house in the dark.",
        "Vienna: Listen, listen.",
        "Pam: More than likely it was a bird. There's a natural habitat near here. I've even spotted a bald eagle in this area.",
        "Henry: And amber waves of grain as well? Thanks for bringing us here -- we'll let you know, okay?",
        "Pam: Well, it would be a shame to lose it.",

        "Henry: Vienna, that's just a chance we're gonna have to take.",
        "Pam: Well, you have only until tomorrow. I mean, if you don't act fast, it'll be gone forever.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "[Pam, Vienna and Henry leave. Ava and Silas come out from hiding]",
        "Ava: They're gone, but that little brat almost got us caught. We're going to have to do something about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So Jack doesn't know this guy? He didn't recognize his voice -- at all?",
        "Katie: No, no. Nothing at all. He doesn't know what this key is. He doesn't know where it is.",
        "Margo: And neither does Carly? What?",
        "Katie: Well, she never actually said she didn't know anything.",
        "Margo: Oh, please. Come on. It's Carly's son who's missing. She's not gonna withhold information from us.",
        "Katie: No, of course not. I just don't know what to make of her most of the time. That's it. That's all the information we have up to this point.",
        "Margo: All right, all right then. We just sit here and wait for the creep to call again.",
        "Katie: Actually, I'm going to get going since you're here.",
        "Margo: What, you're going home?",
        "Katie: No, I'm gonna run out to the farm, see if Jack needs my help.",
        "Margo: Katie, no, Katie.",
        "Katie: What? I'm no good here.",
        "Margo: And Carly is there.",
        "Katie: That doesn't mean Jack wouldn't want me there. I'm sure they could use an extra pair of eyes.",
        "Margo: I'm sure you'd like an extra pair of eyes there to keep an eye on your boyfriend.",
        "Katie: Just because you're my sister does not mean you can --",
        "Margo: It's because I'm your sister I know where you're coming from. You don't want Jack around Carly.",
        "Katie: I'm worried about J.J.",
        "Margo: Well, then worry here.",
        "Katie: Jack is upset. He needs me.",
        "Margo: Carly's son is missing. Carly is upset. Now do you really want to add to that stress by being another person that Jack has to worry about?",
        "Katie: I would not let that happen. But if I'm going to be Jack's wife, I need to be there, by his side, especially during times --",
        "Margo: Wait, wait, wife? What?",
        "Katie: Jack was proposing tonight. He rented out the entire Lakeview Lounge, we had it all to ourselves. He had just presented the ring when Carly walked in and told us about J.J.",
        "Margo: Oh, Katie.",
        "Katie: It's okay. Once J.J.'s safe, we're gonna go through with the engagement.",
        "Margo: You know, it's just that you and Jack have been dating for four weeks now maybe -- and your divorce from Mike is barely final. And you're engaged?",
        "Katie: Well, what? You think we should wait? Why?",
        "Margo: Not that anyone's counting, but doesn't Jack make husband number four? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, listen, Honey. It's just that you of all people should know that jumping into things doesn't always work. Are you sure?",
        "Katie: A few weeks ago a lady held a gun to me. You and Jack, you're cops. You're in danger everyday. Your husband, who we thought was the healthiest person alive, just almost died of a heart attack. Life blindsides you. I'm not just gonna wait around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: That's exactly where it was when I left.",
        "Carly: You're sure?",
        "Jack: Yes, I remember talking to him before I went to go see Katie. I told him that I didn't want him hanging out here too long. I didn't want him on the road after dark.",
        "Carly: I said exactly the same thing.",
        "Jack: Okay, so we have to assume that he was abducted here.",
        "Carly: We should get the forensics guys here, right? Maybe they can get some prints from the bike?",
        "Jack: There are plenty of footprints. But people are going in and out of this place all the time.",
        "Carly: Luke was here after J.J. left.",
        "Jack: How do you know that?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I called him. God, I can't believe I forgot to tell you, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. You can tell me now Carly -- please.",
        "Carly: I called here because J.J. was late, and Luke answered the phone.",
        "Jack: When was this?",
        "Carly: Must've been about 15 minutes before the guy called me.",
        "Jack: No, thank you. Thank you for telling me about that phone call to Luke. It's going to give us a timeline. O'Neal, its Snyder. No, thank you for doing everything you can. I know you are. Listen, has Margo left yet? Hold on a second. Carly -- yeah, can you fill her in for me? Can you tell her that we're at my aunt's farm and that we think that this is where J.J. was abducted? Right. So can you send a forensics crew out here? Maybe some uniforms? Start canvassing the area -- find out if anybody heard or saw anything suspicious? Thanks, right. Bye.",
        "Carly: Wasn't this Julia's?",
        "Jack: Yeah, J.J. had that out earlier.",
        "Carly: Why? Was he missing her?",
        "Jack: I guess. I just chalked it up to him feeling insecure about the -- the changes going on in our family.",
        "Carly: Like you and Katie. It looks like he broke it.",
        "[Jack remembering]",
        "Silas: The key that was in the music box. I want it. Just as much as you want your son back.",
        "Carly: Jack? What is it?",
        "Jack: I think -- I think I'm getting the feeling that it wasn't just nostalgia that made J.J. pull this box out. This is the clue we need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So how much longer is this study session going to last? Should I make some fresh coffee?",
        "Craig: Why don't you answer my question?",
        "Meg: Look, it was easier and quicker to let that nice woman assume we were happy newlyweds than to explain to her we're getting our marriage annulled.",
        "Craig: And that's the only reason?",
        "Meg: Well, I was waiting for you to say something, but you didn't. Why didn't you?",
        "Craig: Same reason.",
        "Meg: Okay. I want to go over the financials -- they don't seem to be sticking in my head. Now why do we need a finance division and also a banking division? What's the difference?",
        "Craig: I lied. About my reasons for not clarifying for the cleaning woman. And since we have opted to be honest in all things with each other, do you want me to be honest about this, Meg?",
        "Meg: I wanted it until you asked me if I wanted it. And now I'm not so sure.",
        "Craig: Well, be sure.",
        "Meg: Okay, go ahead. Be honest.",
        "Craig: All right. For just a moment, I was really enjoying the fantasy of you actually being my wife. I've left you speechless.",
        "Meg: I'm leaving. Just give me an hour, and I'll have my things packed and I'll be out of there before you even get home. Just promise you won't follow me.",
        "Craig: Why are you leaving?",
        "Meg: Because tonight, here, I thought we were at the same place. There were things we weren't talking about -- things we weren't saying. But we still knew the truth.",
        "Craig: That you love Paul.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Craig: And that Paul is dead. Too true for you? I'm sorry, Meg. I shouldn't have started this.",
        "Meg: No, you know what -- I started it. By coming here tonight. And by moving into Fairwinds with you.",
        "Craig: You can stay there as long as you like. I am not pressuring you.",
        "Meg: The pressure's in me. Like the same part of me that believes that I could do this. That I could run the corporation. That I could change the world.",
        "Craig: You can.",
        "Meg: But I won't use you to do it. I made it clear that I need to separate myself, and yet, here I am. In your boardroom, in your home. What kind of hypocrite am I?",
        "Craig: Stop it! It's enough! You take everything that I do or say, and you turn it against yourself.",
        "Meg: I won't lead you on, Craig.",
        "Craig: That might have bite if I was the kind of man that could be led. I am not. You said you wanted to get control on your life, Meg. I am trying to help you.",
        "Meg: That's because you're in love with me.",
        "Craig: You think that's the only reason?",
        "Meg: Well, why else would you go through so much trouble?",
        "Craig: You forget how much I enjoy sticking it to Lucinda. The idea that you would actually keep the company instead of giving it back to her -- oh, that -- that pleases me.",
        "Meg: You are so warped.",
        "Craig: I do what pleases me, Meg. But whenever I do that and it somehow benefits you in any way, you castigate yourself and you treat me like a cad. That is a lose-lose situation. So I give up. If you feel that you are somehow compromising yourself by merely being in my presence -- you know where the door is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: You'd better not pull that stunt again.",
        "Ava: You think the kid's going to keep his mouth shut just 'cause you tell him to? Gag him.",
        "J.J.: No, no. I won't yell again. I swear!",
        "Ava: How about you don't talk, period? You are lucky that Silas was such a good friend of your old man's. It was up to me, I'd have shut you up permanently.",
        "J.J.: My real dad? He was your friend? I only heard bad stuff about him. Stuff my mom told me before -- before she died.",
        "Silas: Don't believe any of that. Les was a good guy. A real pal. In prison, you got to be careful.",
        "Ava: Yeah, everywhere you look, there's criminals.",
        "Silas: And when Les said he had your back, he meant it. And when he told me where he hid that key -- that was for real, too. That detective you've been living with, he probably found that key and emptied the safe deposit box.",
        "J.J.: Jack wouldn't do that.",
        "Ava: Are you hearing this? Like there's no such thing as a crooked cop.",
        "J.J.: Jack is the good guy. He's my real father, not Les. Les is a liar.",
        "Silas: You shut your mouth!",
        "J.J.: You shouldn't have believed him. There's no key. There never was. He lied all the time to make people like him. He lied!",
        "Silas: You're lucky I still need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So the key the guy's looking for was in this box?",
        "Jack: There's a secret compartment. It's been opened.",
        "Carly: By J.J., you think?",
        "Jack: I have no idea. I asked him why he got the box out, he -- he said something vague. I just assumed that he was feeling embarrassed about missing Julia. Now --",
        "Carly: Okay, so somehow this kidnapper goes to J.J., and he asks him about the key?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Only he didn't find it.",
        "Carly: So some stranger walks up to J.J., talks to him about a key in a box and J.J. doesn't say anything to us? That's not like him.",
        "Jack: He probably scared him, okay. He probably threatened to hurt us. Or Parker or Sage.",
        "Carly: J.J. must have been so terrified. How could we not have known?",
        "Jack: Oh, I thought it was strange that he got the box down, too. I just thought that he was feeling insecure. That's all. So it kind of made sense to me that he'd want to connect with something of Julia's.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe he wouldn't be so insecure if he wasn't upset about you proposing to Katie!",
        "Jack: Don't. Don't try to put this on me and Katie, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You want me to go?",
        "Craig: You're a free agent. You can leave this room. You can leave my home. I'm not holding you. The annulment is in the works. I will have my lawyer notify you when it's done. In the meantime, this company is yours. You can do with it whatever the hell you want.",
        "Meg: You mean the corporation. What's in it for you?",
        "Craig: It frees me, too. I don't have to stand by and watch as you take every single goodwill gesture and turn it into some kind of self-flagellation. Number one, you don't deserve it. Number two, it's not attractive. There's the door. What's the holdup?",
        "Meg: I'm waiting for my mother to shut up. She's in my head. You know, she finally showed some faith in me. She believed that I could do this. And I was ready to give it all up. Let her down again.",
        "Craig: You gonna start whining again?",
        "Meg: You know, you're really mean. You know that? I'm gonna tell you what I'm going to do. I am not going to walk away not this time.",
        "Craig: That's your choice.",
        "Meg: Fine, give me the files. I want to go through them again.",
        "Craig: Well I don't know, that would entail me helping you. Can you handle me helping you?",
        "Meg: Well, you could do this on your own. So can I, if you want to go home. Okay, I don't want you to go. How late can you stay?",
        "Craig: I can stay as late as you would need.",
        "Meg: All night would be good. I don't -- I haven't been sleeping. Thinking about Paul.",
        "Craig: I'll make some fresh coffee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Let's have champagne and celebrate my new spa!",
        "Henry: Vienna, Sweetheart -- don't you think you're being a little premature?",
        "Vienna: Ooh, I have a better idea.",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Vienna: Let's have a nice, long, warm, hot bubble bath while we drink champagne and celebrate my new spa.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie -- Vienna, I -- I can't concentrate when you do that.",
        "Vienna: Oh, but think about hot, soapy water. You and me.",
        "Henry: No, no. No, not another word, okay. Not another soapy, sensuous syllable, all right? Not until we discuss this. Thank you. Okay, there are a some problems with this. First of all, it's not finished. Second of all, we saw it with a flashlight, which means we didn't get a very good look around. What are you doing?",
        "Vienna: You told me not to talk.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but I didn't tell you to take your clothes off, either. What are you -- come on. Not until we discuss this.",
        "Vienna: I think that we should see Pam first thing in the morning and sign the papers.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. Be practical. All right, Sweetie. Be practical, all right. You're going to have to drop a big chunk of your money into this thing just to secure it. And then to fix it up and then there's the everyday expenses of running a real business and meeting payroll and everything. It's a real big risk. And if it doesn't work out, your luxury lifestyle is over, I'm afraid.",
        "Vienna: What's the problem? We do this -- I still have you, you still have me. It's a free risk!",
        "Henry: It's risk-free.",
        "Vienna: That's what I said.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I don't like all this waiting.",
        "Silas: We gotta give Snyder enough time to get us the key.",
        "Ava: How much time?",
        "Silas: We gotta at least wait till the banks open. I mean, maybe he has a safety deposit stash of his own.",
        "Ava: You know, what if he really doesn't know anything about the key, huh? What if the kid is right? What if there is no safe deposit box in El Paso full of cash? What if Les was just yanking your chain?",
        "Silas: Les wouldn't lie.",
        "Ava: The guy was a con, Honey.",
        "Silas: Well either way, we're gonna wait until the morning.",
        "Ava: And then what?",
        "Silas: We cover our tracks.",
        "Ava: No. No, after all we've been through, stealing this kid -- we at least ought to come up with something.",
        "Silas: Well, what else are we gonna get besides with the key?",
        "Ava: Ransom. Snyder wants the kid back, we'll make him pay.",
        "Silas: You're a real genius, you know that? You don't think I had a plan B?",
        "Ava: So what are you waiting for?",
        "Silas: Maybe it's time.",
        "Ava: Wait a minute, wait a minute. The guy's a detective. Even if we told him not to do it, those phones are going to be bugged. I got a better idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing here, Katie?",
        "Jack: Was there another call? Is there news?",
        "Katie: No, no. No news. Margo's at Milltown, and they have everything set to monitor the calls. I just thought I'd come here and see if I could help.",
        "Carly: Well, you can't.",
        "Jack: Carly, why don't you call Margo and tell her what we found.",
        "Katie: I thought J.J. was okay with us. He didn't want us to get engaged?",
        "Jack: No, it's just -- Carly's just emotional, okay? She doesn't know what she's saying.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Jack. This is awful enough. I don't need to be making it worse for you. I'm just gonna go. I'm sorry --",
        "Jack: No, no, no. Please, don't go. I want you here with me.",
        "Katie: J.J.'s got to be okay. For you and Parker and Sage. I didn't realize it, Jack, but I love those kids as if they were my own.",
