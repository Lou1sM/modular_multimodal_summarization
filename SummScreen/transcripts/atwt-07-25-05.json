        "Lily: Any time.",
        "Keith: You know, it's dangerous sneaking around a place like this.",
        "Lily: Is that a fact?",
        "Keith: Yes, and had I been playing for money here, which I'm not, because I don't gamble anymore. I gave up the greyhounds, as you know.",
        "Lily: Thank goodness. Thank you, thank you.",
        "Keith: But you could've been in trouble.",
        "Lily: Maybe I am already.",
        "Keith: What are you talking about? Something I don't know about?",
        "Lily: No. It's just everything. I'm sorry for everything.",
        "Keith: You kind of lost me here. What do you feel that you're sorry about?",
        "Lily: I'm sorry about dragging you into all my problems and my family. I'm sorry about it.",
        "Keith: You didn't drag me into anything. I came willingly.",
        "Lily: Still -- after everything that's happened, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me this was all a mistake.",

        "Jennifer: I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Don't apologize. You're a very brave woman. You can cry all you want to.",
        "Jennifer: I just feel so out of control.",
        "Dusty: That's okay. What's wrong with that? I'll leave if it makes things easier for you.",
        "Jennifer: No. No. Please -- stay. Please.",

        "Craig: Rosanna, I'm not going to let you go anywhere. I'm not gonna let you.",
        "Rosanna: Please, Paul, I need to see you. I need to tell you the truth.",
        "Paul: Just calm down. You're not making any sense.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you'll understand everything when I tell you what's happened.",
        "[Car horn honking]",
        "Paul: Are you driving?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Paul: You need to calm down. And better yet, why don't you just pull over to the side of the road?",
        "Rosanna: Look, I can't. There's no time.",
        "Paul: What's going on?",
        "Rosanna: Please, Paul. Can you meet me someplace?",
        "Paul: It's Rosanna. Rosanna, listen. You gotta give me more than that.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Paul, you told me that if I ever needed you, that you would be there for me. Now, please, I need you now. Just meet me someplace. Please, help me.",
        "Paul: I'll come meet you. You gotta tell me where you are.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I just started driving. I had to get away from Craig.",
        "Paul: Craig? Why? What did he do to you?",
        "Rosanna: Look, just tell me where to meet you.",
        "Paul: Well, are you close to Java?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Paul: Fine. I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Rosanna: Please hurry!",
        "Emily: Can I ask what's going on?",
        "Paul: It's Rosanna. She's -- she's in some kind of trouble. I think Craig is after her. She said something about him chasing her.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, if that's the case, shouldn't she be going to the police? Why is she calling you?",
        "Paul: I don't know. She's just -- she's very upset. I think she's in real trouble. I'm only going because I think she's really in trouble.",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay, so, if she needs you, then I guess you gotta go.",
        "Paul: Well, it's not like she would make something like this up.",
        "Emily: You know her better than I do.",
        "Paul: Look, I'll be at Java. I'll just be there a few minutes to figure out what's wrong. And I'll try and calm her down. She asked me for my help.",
        "Emily: Okay, it's okay. Go, do what you need to do. I mean it, its okay. I'm okay with it. If she's in trouble and she doesn't have anybody else to call, obviously she needs you. So I guess you've gotta go.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Celia, are you all right?",
        "Celia: What's wrong with you? Both of you. Are you crazy?",
        "Will: We had an argument and things got out of hand.",
        "Gwen: Out of hand? You guys looked like you were gonna kill each other.",
        "Manager: What happened here? What are you doing to my place?",
        "Casey: We had a little accident. Sorry. We'll take care of it.",
        "Gwen: Good. It's about time you took care of something.",
        "Will: Are you sure you're okay? That was a really mean fall.",
        "Celia: It just stunned me a little. I'm fine. Now tell me what you were fighting about.",
        "Will: What do you think? Everything. Gwen. The baby. It all just came to a head.",
        "Casey: And we lost it.",
        "Gwen: Why do guys always think they have to beat each other up to a bloody pulp to make a point, huh?",
        "Manager: So, tough guys -- who's gonna pay for all the broken merchandise?",
        "Will/Casey: He is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You know, you're the only one who seems to understand.",
        "Dusty: That's not true.",
        "Jennifer: No, it is true. Everybody else is just, they're walking on eggshells, trying to get me to be strong, giving me advice on how to get past my grief. As if skipping over it would really make it any less painful.",
        "Dusty: They're just trying to help. It's tough, you know, to know what to say.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. You seem to, though.",
        "Dusty: That's 'cause I wing it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you do a pretty good job. Maybe it was because you were there when he was born. You know that you and I are the only ones who knew him his whole life?",
        "Dusty: That's true. I never thought of it that way.",
        "Jennifer: You even got to hold him in your arms. I didn't even get that.",
        "Dusty: You gave him life. I mean, you loved him more than anything in the world.",
        "Jennifer: Still -- do you think -- do you think that I'm being punished?",
        "Dusty: No. No way. For what?",
        "Jennifer: For getting drunk and sleeping with Craig?",
        "Dusty: You got pregnant, Jen, not punished.",
        "Jennifer: It was so stupid. And then I shut Craig out. And then you and I -- we set him up to get in trouble with the law just to keep him away from his own child.",
        "Dusty: It was the lesser of two evils.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but maybe I'm just as bad as Craig. And maybe, maybe this is my penance for that.",
        "Dusty: God didn't kill an innocent baby to punish you for a mistake. Bad things happen. It may not be right. It may not be fair. But it's real. It's real. And you survive it.",
        "Jennifer: I don't know if I can.",
        "Dusty: You will. I promise. I'll make sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Paul? I'm on my way.",
        "Craig: It's not Paul. It's me. Now just hear me out.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, I don't have anything more to say to you.",
        "Craig: I'm trying to hold onto my son here. The only way I know.",
        "Rosanna: That's the problem. It's the only way you know. What you did is horrible. It's beyond forgiveness.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. Look, I know you're upset. But think, all right? We have a son. You've held him, you love him. So why throw away a chance at a whole new life here?",
        "Rosanna: We're talking about -- Jennifer thinks her baby is dead! How monstrous can you be?",
        "Craig: It's not my fault. One baby survived and one didn't. I did not make that happen.",
        "Rosanna: You deliberately switched those babies.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, we have a son who needs us. Who we love very much. Now, if you tell anyone about this, we will probably lose him forever. Do you want that?",
        "Rosanna: Unlike you, I will not destroy another person's life just to get what I want.",
        "Craig: Just stop the car, will you, and pull over. We can work this out face to face.",
        "Rosanna: Look, there's nothing to work out. Wait a minute -- did you just tell me stop the car? Where are you? Oh, my God, are you following me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Lily, you know, you can't scare me off. I love you. I will do and help you any way i can.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Keith: Yes.",
        "Lily: Even if it means making enemies of my entire family?",
        "Keith: Well, you know, your mother hates me and she has every reason, she's sick right now and she hates the world. And your son -- you know, his parents are getting divorced, so that's not good. That stinks in anybody's book. And here I come in. So I understand that. But what's important to me is how you feel.",
        "Lily: I feel stuck in the middle. I wanna be with you. But I don't want to make everybody else miserable.",
        "Keith: Yeah, but you know, you'll drive yourself crazy if you try to make everybody happy.",
        "Lily: I can't be selfish. I have to be sensitive to my family and, of course, to you.",
        "Keith: Well, I'm here as long as it takes. 'Cause I wanna be with you. I think we ought to dance.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Keith: Come on.",
        "Luke: Forget it, man. This place blows. Let's go to another bar.",

        "Meg: Hello, Barbara. It's been a while.",
        "Barbara: Well, what a surprise. Meg. I didn't know you were back in town.",
        "Meg: I haven't been back that long.",
        "Barbara: I'm surprised you came back at all.",
        "Meg: So am I.",
        "Barbara: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: I just came to pay my respects. I heard about Jennifer's baby. I'm sorry. That's a terrible thing to have to face.",
        "Barbara: Yes, it is. Honey, I brought the car around.",
        "Dusty: Ready to go home?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Where else am I going to go?",
        "Barbara: I underestimated you.",
        "Dusty: Well, it wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Barbara: You've been a very good friend to my daughter.",
        "Dusty: I hope so. I'm here if you need me.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: Yes. Thank you, Dusty.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Dusty: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: I was in the neighborhood.",
        "Dusty: I see.",
        "Meg: You okay?",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Meg: Would you rather be alone?",

        "Susan: Hi.",
        "Emily: What do you want?",
        "Susan: Is Paul here?",
        "Emily: No, Paul's not here.",
        "Susan: I didn't want to intrude.",
        "Emily: What are you doing? Is everything okay with Alison? Did she get off all right?",
        "Susan: Oh, sure, sure. Her plane was delayed, but she's on her way to Seattle. I miss her already.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I miss her, too. But you didn't come here to tell me how much you miss Alison, so what do you want?",
        "Susan: You're still upset about before.",
        "Emily: I'm upset about a lot of things. But don't worry, you're still at the top of my list.",
        "Susan: I know I am.",
        "Emily: You just drive me crazy! Every time we get together, you hassle me about Paul, and it's, frankly, driving me crazy!",
        "Susan: I know. I'm sorry. That's why I came back. Where is he, anyway?",
        "Emily: He went to go help a friend.",
        "Susan: Who?",
        "Emily: What does it matter who?",
        "Susan: Rosanna, by any chance?",
        "Emily: Why would you say it like that?",
        "Susan: From the look on your face.",
        "Emily: Didn't you just say something about an apology?",
        "Susan: I'm worried about you. Anything I say about Paul and about the way you're living your life, is only because I don't wanna see you get hurt. And I'm afraid you will be.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Paul is not going to hurt me.",
        "Susan: Maybe not intentionally. But aren't you a little worried that his ex- wife, a woman he supposedly hates, is suddenly his best friend? His friend in need? She calls, he runs. And you're here, all by your lonely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna, this isn't doing either of us any good. Will you just pull over? Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Paul, it's me. Please hurry. Craig's following me. [Car horn honking] He's right behind me.",
        "Paul: Don't panic. Tell me where you are.",
        "Rosanna: Um, High Street and Juniper.",
        "Paul: That's good. You're close to Java. You should be there in a minute. I'm on high street, too, all right? We should get to Java around the same time. If you do get there before me, though, you get into that lot, you keep the doors locked and you stay in the car, you got it?",
        "Rosanna: Please, hurry! Please! He's catching up with me!",
        "Paul: Well, don't let him catch you. You stay ahead of him. You're almost there.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, pull over, will you? You're going to get us both killed here. If you don't stop the car, I'm gonna have to make you!",

        "Dusty: I mean, it's not like I'm his father or anything. I just delivered this kid. I feel like I let him down.",
        "Meg: You brought him into this world. It's kind of like you helped bring him to life.",
        "Dusty: He's gone now.",
        "Meg: It's not your fault, Dusty. Or anyone's.",
        "Dusty: But he's gone. And he took a piece of Jen with him. She'll never get it back.",
        "Meg: No, she won't. You're right.",

        "Gwen: I'm doing good, by the way, just in case you were wondering. I just had a baby and all, and I had to give it away, because I figured I'd be a real lousy mom, 'cause my life's so screwed up. But I'm good. Back in action. Good as new.",
        "Casey: Quit trying to guilt trip me, Gwen, all right? You're the one who kept the baby a secret. You never told me I was the dad. You never gave me a chance, so don't blame me. We both messed this up and you know it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I do. Let me ask you something. If I had told you from the beginning -- if you had known all along --",
        "Casey: Don't even go there. What's the point? You didn't. I didn't. And this is where we are because of it. You gave our kid away, I lost my best friend and the girl I love. It all stinks. I wish we'd never even met.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Me, too.",

        "Emily: Paul is working through his anger towards Rosanna. I think he's come to terms with the fact that she did what she did because she was manipulated by James. He doesn't hold it against her. I guess it wasn't her fault.",
        "Susan: Am I missing something here, or are you?",
        "Emily: What do you mean?",
        "Susan: If James forced her to break up with Paul, then maybe she never actually fell out of love with him. And she certainly didn't marry Craig Montgomery for love. No way. So in this scenario, what's to prevent Paul and Rosanna from getting back together?",
        "Emily: Me.",
        "Susan: So, Paul's fallen out of love with Rosanna and in love with you? Is that what you're trying to tell me?",
        "Emily: We're making a go of it, Mother.",
        "Susan: Making a go of it?",
        "Emily: You know what, I'm not having this conversation with you. I'm not talking to you about this, because you twist my words every time.",
        "Susan: What about you and Hal? Is there no going back?",
        "Emily: Oh, Mother, it is over. It is over with me and Hal. It was over before we actually ended it.",
        "Susan: But you were so good together.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, we could've been. I mean, if it wasn't for his job and his ex-wife and his children, maybe.",
        "Susan: Yeah, so now you're living with a man who runs every time his ex-wife calls.",
        "Emily: Paul told me he still has feelings for Rosanna. He also told me he's never going back to her. And guess what? And I believe him.",
        "Susan: So why is he with her right now instead of here with you?",
        "Emily: Because she needed him, so he went to her. I trust him, mother. I trust him completely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Get your hands off me!",
        "Hal: Break it up. Break it up.",
        "Craig: Cuff him, Hal. He's out of control.",
        "Paul: He tried to kill Rosanna. He ran her off the road. I saw the whole thing!",
        "Hal: Both of you, shut up and calm down.",
        "Craig: I need to see my wife.",
        "Hal: Let the EMT do their job. Now, I need to know what happened here. First your side of the story, then yours, Paul.",
        "Craig: We were on our way to the hospital, Hal, to see our son -- separate cars.",
        "Hal: Why?",
        "Craig: Because I had somewhere to go afterwards and Rosanna wanted to go home. So, I followed her and she sped up and -- I don't know. She was losing control of her car. So I caught up to her.",
        "Paul: That's a lie.",
        "Craig: And our cars collided.",
        "Paul: I saw the whole thing. He was in his car. He pulled his car up beside her car! He tried to ram her with his car!",
        "Craig: Why would I want to ram my wife?",
        "Paul: She was running from you. She was terrified.",
        "Craig: Oh really?",
        "EMT #2: Excuse me, we've been able to stabilize her. She's in and out of consciousness, but she keeps asking for someone.",
        "Craig: I'm her husband. Craig Montgomery.",
        "EMT #2: She's asking for someone named Paul. Just one person at a time, given the circumstance.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.",

        "Luke: Oh, man. I was just counting on scoring some beers. But vodka, my friend -- this is too good to be true.",
        "Kevin: It was the story about us needing to impress our girlfriends. That did the trick.",
        "Luke: A good friend of mine says that works quite often.",
        "Kevin: Well, I guess he was right. Hey, I'm going inside to use the bathroom.",
        "Luke: What, are you crazy? You can't go in there all messed up like that. They're gonna know you're drunk. Go to the dumpster.",

        "Dusty: Geez.",
        "Jennifer: I can't really breathe.",
        "Dusty: Take a breath. You're stressed out. You want me to get you some water?",

        "Dusty: How about some company?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I would love some company. Come here. Talk to me. Tell me a story. Anything. Not about him.",
        "Dusty: I was watching the news. There was a woman who hiked across the grand canyon and back. Took about two days, 40 miles total. She had gear, water, and she almost passed out halfway through. But she never gave up. The reporter asked why she did it. And she indirectly answered. She said by doing it, by finding herself in this amazing place, she realized that she was a part of something much bigger than herself. And by seeing other hikers out there, periodically, reminded her that she was never alone.",
        "Jennifer: That's an interesting thought to have.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I thought it was a perfect answer.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I guess it is.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you go to sleep now? You're gonna get through the canyon. And I'll be waitin' for you on the other side.",

        "Emily: Yeah, and I want to believe you mean that, but you don't.",
        "Susan: No. I know I'm a little overly judgmental sometimes.",
        "Emily: Well, that is one way of putting it.",
        "Susan: But it's only because I really care about you.",
        "Emily: Mother, you are a worrywart. You love to worry.",

        "Emily: That, too.",
        "Susan: And I understand. I do. Maybe you're right about Paul. Maybe you have a lot of things in common. You have these complicated pasts that you're trying to dig out of. Maybe you could build on that.",
        "Emily: Build on my lousy history? That's great, thank you.",
        "Susan: I only want you to be happy, hon. But please, be careful.",
