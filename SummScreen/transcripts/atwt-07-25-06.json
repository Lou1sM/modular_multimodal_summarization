        "Katie: You said you'd never work for Simon.",
        "Carly: I know! I know! And I meant it. I think he's a creep. I really today. Especially after what he pulled on that island.",
        "Katie: Then why?",
        "Carly: I'm broke. I couldn't even pay my bar tab at the Lakeview.",
        "Katie: Last night? Why didn't you say something?",
        "Carly: You were already gone. Then Jack showed up and tried to shove money at me. And I wouldn't take it. So I ended up washing dishes.",
        "Katie: Lisa made you wash dishes?",
        "Carly: No. No. I insisted. Look, if Jack doesn't want to be my husband anymore, I don't want to live off his money. I have to make it on my own.",
        "Katie: By working for Simon.",
        "Carly: I have to start somewhere. Look, guys, right now it seems like Simon's the only game in town for me. But if it would interfere with our friendship, Katie, I couldn't take it. Please, please tell me that you understand.",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "Carly: You do?",
        "Katie: Of course I do.",
        "Carly: That's great, thank you.",
        "Katie: But you still can't work for Simon. Not now. Not ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: Mr. Frasier.",
        "Simon: Good evening.",
        "Waiter: Will you be dining alone, sir?",
        "Simon: Like this? No, I don't think so. Listen, I'm here to meet a very reluctant lady and I want to impress her. So I'll need nothing but your best tonight. Best table, best server, best champagne.",
        "Waiter: I'll arrange it.",
        "Simon: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: A lucky lady?",
        "Simon: Lucinda!",
        "Lucinda: Look at you, you're dazzling, you're magnificent.",
        "Simon: How's Lily?",
        "Lucinda: You're trying to distract me.",
        "Simon: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Well, no one can. Is Katie the reluctant lady?",
        "Simon: There's more than one beautiful woman in this town.",
        "Lucinda: Ooh. I think it's going to take more than a romantic meal to separate Katie from her new spouse.",
        "Simon: Fortunately, that's not my plan.",
        "Lucinda: And anyway, even if you manage to catch her, are you sure you can keep her? I'll give you my advice, don't do a walk about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are we doing here, kid? Hey, you couldn't sleep, either. The fresh air is good for us. And this is where I proposed to your mom, remember? Your mom died out here. She's not at home, and that's the way it is. There's no going back. So we've got to move on. And that's what we're doing, Pal, that's what we're doing. Starting tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: I was just calling your house.",
        "Casey: Looking for me?",
        "Dallas: Looking for Casey. I have a few more questions about what happened to your girlfriend.",
        "Casey: She wasn't my girlfriend. Maddie's my -- I don't have a girlfriend.",
        "Dallas: But you were on a date with Lia last night. Right?",
        "Casey: My mom can ask me whatever you guys need to know.",
        "Dallas: Unfortunately, Margo's not back yet.",
        "Casey: Where did she go? I thought you said she was going to be here?",
        "Dallas: I thought she'd have been here by now.",
        "Casey: Where did she go?",
        "Dallas: Casey, this is a murder investigation.",
        "Casey: Mom went to see Maddie, didn't she? First she was afraid I killed Lia, and now she thinks Maddie did it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Where were you last night, Maddie?",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Lia: Don't forget that. I'm taking a shower.",
        "Casey: Lia, wait --",
        "Casey: I wasn't even thinking about her.",
        "Lia: Okay then what is the problem? You're here. I'm nearly naked. Stop talking and start doing more of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, I'm not going to ask you one more time, where were you last night?",
        "Maddie: Right here. I never left the suite, I was here the whole time.",
        "Margo: Were you alone?",
        "Henry: Of course she wasn't alone! She was here with us. Eve and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Lucinda, I know how you pride yourself on being right.",
        "Lucinda: I generally am.",
        "Simon: But I'm not expecting Katie.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, then this and the champagne, the perfection is for someone else?",
        "Simon: I've hired a designer to decorate one of the buildings I just bought downtown. She's a little wary, so I'm just trying to --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, got it, she's a smart cookie. I know all the interior designers worth knowing in this town, maybe I can help. What's her name?",
        "Simon: Carly Snyder. You may know her? You approve, good.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, she designs dresses not interior spaces. Do you want to lose money?",
        "Simon: I think she can add a fresh slant to really put this development on the map. Does that sound convincing? Look I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just trying to live the life I dreamed off. Now all I need is --",
        "Lucinda: The right girl.",
        "Simon: No. Just trying to enjoy my life. Thank you for caring about me. [Simon gives Lucinda a great big kiss on the mouth]",
        "Lucinda: Hey, a kiss like that, you might just get the right girl.",
        "[Lucinda leaves]",
        "Waiter: Shall I present the champagne Mr. Frasier?",
        "Simon: A scotch on the rocks. I've got one last detail to attend to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'll be fine, Katie. I've handled a lot worse than Simon.",
        "Carly: No!",
        "Katie: I know you don't want to mix money and friendship, but --",
        "Carly: Katie, I'm not asking your permission. I've already taken the job.",
        "Katie: But you can't!",
        "Mike: Katie --",
        "Katie: She can't! You're too smart to let Simon take advantage of you. Jack just said the exact same thing.",
        "Carly: You spoke to Jack about this? When?",
        "Mike: I asked Jack to check out Simon's financial portfolio. We weren't butting into your business, Carly. We were just --",
        "Carly: Scoping out the enemy. I get that. What did Jack find out?",
        "Mike: Apparently, Simon's as rich as he says he is.",
        "Carly: Oh, well at least I know his check won't bounce.",
        "Katie: But you can't trust him. What if he runs out on you? Leaves you hanging? He's done this to me several times and I was married to him.",
        "Carly: I need to pay my own way.",
        "Mike: Get another job while you're building your business.",
        "Carly: And spend twice as much time away from her kids?",
        "Katie: Whose side are you on?",
        "Carly: Katie, I have to do this.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Carly: Because when I couldn't pay that bill, and Jack showed up. I almost took his money! Almost got sucked right back in. I make a mistake and Jack runs to the rescue. That was always our pattern. But it has to stop now. I'm more than capable of taking care of myself.",
        "Katie: Of course you are, but --",
        "Carly: For the first time in a long time I was standing on my own two feet and it felt so good. I really want to be able to feel that way again. That's why I need to take this job.",
        "Mike: We get that. Don't we, Katie?",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Simon: Carly, I need you to meet me at the Lakeview right away.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Simon: You'll find out when you get here. And wear the most striking thing you've got in your closet.",
        "Carly: But --",
        "Simon: No questions. Just get here.",
        "Katie: That was Simon.",
        "Mike: How do you know that?",
        "Katie: Look at her face. That's what he does. He reels you in. He makes you think you have a choice and then all of a sudden --",
        "Mike: Carly, take the job or don't. Whatever, we're here for you.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Katie: How can you be supportive of this? Don't you care about Carly?",
        "Mike: Yes I care about Carly, but I care more about us. And that's why we're keeping our noses out of Carly's business. Even if that business is Simon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie is not a murderer.",
        "Tom: Don't get yourself all worked up, not exactly we have all the facts.",
        "Casey: Dad, this is Maddie we're talking about. She thought Bambi was a horror flick. She wouldn't kill that spider in her room. She couldn't do this to somebody.",
        "Dallas: Margo should be back soon --",
        "Casey: This is all your fault. Ever since you came her Maddie's been acting like a bad --",
        "Tom: Apologize.",
        "Casey: No, I'm not going to apologize. You try to pin Maddie for murder.",
        "Dallas: Why would I do that do that?",
        "Casey: I don't know, maybe to get back at her for blowing you off in Chicago. And you're not going to get away with it because I'm stake sticking by Maddie's side even if nobody else will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Is that true, Eve? Are you confirming, on the record, that Maddie was here with you all night?",
        "Eve: Yes, Maddie was here. All night.",
        "Margo: How do you know?",
        "Eve: I beg your pardon?",
        "Margo: Well, I'm assuming that at some point you went to bed. Did you all sleep in the same room? One big happy family? How do you know she didn't sneak out?",
        "Maddie: We were all watching TV. \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"",
        "Margo: Are you sure? Maddie, I know that you're scared but I really need you to be straight with me.",
        "Maddie: I have been.",
        "Margo: All right, if anything else --",
        "Maddie: It won't.",
        "Margo: The same goes for you two. If you remember anything --",
        "Henry: We'll call you.",
        "Margo: I really need Casey and Maddie to keep their distance.",
        "Henry: We'll make sure there's no contact. Thanks a lot. Thank you.",
        "Eve: Are you out of your mind?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What if I can't let it go?",
        "Mike: Hand me that plane, will you? I want to make sure this is level.",
        "Katie: Simon's using Carly to get to me.",
        "Mike: And as soon as he figures out it's not going to work, he'll back off. Isn't that what you told me a little while ago?",
        "Katie: That was before he got Carly involved.",
        "Mike: We'll be there to help Carly if she needs. But in the meantime, we stay out of it.",
        "Katie: If you weren't so worried about Simon, why did you punch him before?",
        "Mike: That was just a warning to let the guy know not to come around here again.",
        "Katie: And if he ignores your warning?",
        "Mike: I'll do worse next time.",
        "Katie: Maybe I should punch Simon, then I won't be worried about what he's going to do next.",
        "Mike: I can help you stop worrying.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "[Mike kisses Katie]",
        "Mike: Better?",
        "Katie: Getting there. Just don't let go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: May I seat you, Mrs. Snyder?",
        "Carly: No, thank you. I'll wait. So, Simon, if we're going to be working to the...",
        "Simon: If?",
        "Carly: Don't ever order me around.",
        "Simon: Don't ever keep me waiting.",
        "Carly: I didn't. I came right -- look, I have children. I have a life. I'm not going to just drop everything and come running every time you have some kind of whim.",
        "Simon: Well, you look stunning. So as whims go, I'm pleased with this one.",
        "Carly: It's the only one you get.",
        "Simon: So, how are those dishpan hands? Still a tad wringly?",
        "Carly: So what's the urgency, Simon? And why am I all gussied up?",
        "Simon: How long has it been since you've worn that dress?",
        "Carly: You know honestly, I don't remember.",
        "Simon: That's why.",
        "Waiter: Ready for your champagne, Mr. Frasier?",
        "Simon: Yeah, I think that's a grand idea. I think it's time that we sealed this deal.",
        "Carly: Wait just a minute. I'm not sure we've got a deal to seal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: And get them to wrap it up to keep it warm. If my son-in-law won't eat here, we'll take the food to the hospital.",
        "Waiter: Certainly, Ms. Walsh.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. Thank you. Hey, hello. Hi, Dusty. Hello little guy.",
        "Dusty: I just called your house, they said you were here. How's Lily?",
        "Lucinda: Come on, sit down.",
        "Dusty: No thanks. I do have something I'd like to talk about.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, dear, is it bad news? Should I sit down?",
        "Dusty: About Street Jeans --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, don't worry about that. It's all settled, I've spoken to the board. I've had dinner with the chairman. And we have no plans, no plans to dismantle the company.",
        "Dusty: I want you to shut down the company. The sooner, the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Casey: I'm going to be with Maddie.",
        "Margo: Casey I asked you to stay away from Maddie, that is exactly what you're going to do. Are we clear?",
        "Casey: You didn't arrest her?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Casey: Because she had an alibi.",
        "Margo: Have you talked to Dallas? We have some follow-up questions.",
        "Casey: I'm not talking to you. Anything I say you can use it against Maddie.",
        "Margo: Okay, fine, then talk to us.",
        "Dallas: He's in the interrogation room.",
        "Margo: Thank you for being patient with him.",
        "Tom: I'm with Casey, Maddie had nothing to do with it.",
        "Margo: That remains to be seen. I want to concentrate on the murder weapon.",
        "Dallas: Those wounds exactly like --",
        "Margo: Exactly.",
        "Dallas: I'm going to get the knife.",
        "Margo: I'm going to call the coroner thanks.",
        "Tom: Maddie's a serious suspect?",
        "Margo: Hey, it's Hughes. No, I gotta talk to the coroner. Look, Carol, we're all really busy tonight, huh? Fine. All right. I understand. Would you please just tell him to drop by on his way home when he gets a minute? Thanks.",
        "Tom: What did Maddie say?",
        "Margo: Oh, she said that she was home all night in her sister's room.",
        "Tom: Alone?",
        "Margo: No. No. Henry and Eve were there with her. They confirmed it.",
        "Tom: And don't believe them?",
        "Margo: Not a word. What's the matter, Kiddo?",
        "Casey: Where's my bag?",
        "Margo: It's over there, Sweetheart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: We shouldn't have lied to the police.",
        "Henry: Better us than Maddie going to jail for something she didn't do.",
        "Eve: What if someone saw her last night at the coffee shop or at the club?",
        "Henry: Then we'll point out that there are lots of girls with long dark hair.",
        "Eve: But what if she was at the country club, Henry?",
        "Henry: Not a possibility.",
        "Eve: We both know she wasn't here!",
        "Henry: Eve, she did not kill that girl.",
        "Eve: Look at her. She's not acting like herself and she hasn't for days. There's no telling where she was or what she might've done.",
        "Henry: You are not telling me that you think our sister is capable of killing someone.",
        "Eve: But she lied so smoothly to Detective Hughes --",
        "Henry: Maybe she didn't lie. Maybe she didn't lie. Maybe she was walking \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" just not here.",
        "Eve: Was it on?",
        "Henry: Maybe she rented it. Maybe she owns it. She's a big Audrey Hepburn fan.",
        "Eve: We both know she wasn't watching a movie. She was doing something -- something she didn't want the police to know about. And if we're going to help her -- I'm calling Margo Hughes.",
        "Henry: No. Hold on, hold on. She needs help. And we're going to get her that help. But before we dive in and start getting the cops involved we need to find out exactly what we're dealing with, right? We need to find out what really happened tonight. Maddie? Hey, Maddie. You doing okay, Sweetheart?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Thank you, Henry. You helped me today, thank you.",
        "Henry: Oh, baby. I love you.",
        "Maddie: I love you.",
        "Henry: Love you so much. But we lied today, and Eve and I we need you to do is tell us the truth. Can you do that? Can you please tell us what happened last night?",
        "Maddie: If I tell you, promise not to hate me?",

        "Coming up on: As the World Turns.",
        "Carly: It's been so long, I'm not sure I remember what it is.",
        "Simon: It's about time she jogged your memory, don't you think?",
        "Casey: I know Maddie said she never wanted to see me again but I need to see her. She's feeling alone or scared then she needs to see me.",
        "Jade: Stay out of my business. If you don't, I'll tell Casey's mother the cop what I saw you toss in the river just thank you.",
        "Maddie: Ask me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm going to be tied up here for a while, and Casey's going to find Maddie. But you can't let him, Tom.",
        "Tom: Do you really believe Maddie would hurt somebody? Especially Casey? They're crazy about each other.",
        "Margo: Would you have thought that this girl would be taking a knife to someone's car?",
        "Tom: That's a car, not a human being.",
        "Margo: I'm not saying she did it. But I'm not certain she didn't.",
        "Tom: Margo --",
        "Margo: She's withdrawn. She's vague. Sometimes the real Maddie is there, and sometimes it's not. Maybe she's having blackouts, maybe she's flashing back to when she was assaulted. But when she did back there and she relives what that frat boy did to her do you want our son in the line of fire.",
        "Tom: Maybe Casey can help her.",
        "Margo: I don't think that Maddie would ever deliberately hurt Casey. But what if she freaks out. What if she loses it? What if for that moment she thinks that he's someone else.",
        "Dallas: Detective Hughes, your son, he's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Its okay, Maddie. Whatever, whatever happened last night, its okay.",
        "Maddie: I don't remember where I was last night.",
        "Henry: Maddie --",
        "Maddie: I don't -- I don't know why. When I try to remember, I get nothing.",
        "Henry: Why didn't you tell us this before?",
        "Maddie: Because Mrs. Hughes would have thought that I -- so I didn't say anything. I said that I was here.",
        "Henry: You remember anything about last night? Anything at all?",
        "Maddie: I was probably just sitting somewhere daydreaming. You know how I get when I get inside my head. Just like the whole world disappears around me. I'm really tired. Can I go lie down?",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure.",
        "Eve: What do we do now?",
        "[Henry starts to go inside Maddie's purse, Maddie comes back into the room and grabs her bag]",
        "Maddie: Oh, there it is. I keep losing this.",
        "Eve: She's hiding something, Henry.",
        "Henry: You don't know that. It could be her diary in there. It could be her own copy of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" We don't know. If that's the cops again, we protect Maddie. Do you understand me? Promise me, Eve.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I need to see you. Please, open the door.",

        "Simon: Are there some points you want to negotiate?",
        "Carly: No. No, it's not that. It's that -- you're sneaky.",
        "Simon: As are you.",
        "Carly: I don't want you to break up Mike and Katie's marriage.",
        "Simon: Is that an option?",
        "Carly: That's what this is about I'm not interested. No matter how desperate I am for the money, I won't do it.",
        "Simon: You want to know why I really came back to Oakdale.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'd love to know.",
        "Simon: I love Katie. Always have. Probably always will. Was I hoping to bump into her when I came back into town? Yeah. But I did. I've done that. Now I realize that yeah, we're pretty much over.",
        "Carly: Pretty much?",
        "Simon: Have you given up hope that maybe one day you'll get back together with Jack? See, we can't decide to stop loving someone. We just hope one day maybe we will.",
        "Carly: Since there's no hope for you and Katie, why stay?",
