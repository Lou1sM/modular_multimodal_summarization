Ava thinks they will do whatever they can in order to get their son back. A shocked Brad is silenced when he realizes Carly is not crying because of Jack and Katie's engagement, but rather because J.J. has been kidnapped. Jack is called to the station and Carly unleashes her wrath on Katie. She blames her for causing J.J. to be vulnerable to these kidnappers because of her own agenda to get Jack to propose. Jack's family will always come first and Katie won't be able to live with not being the center of Jack's attention. Ava goes to deliver the note. Lucinda wonders what Meg is doing? She wonders if Meg really blames her for Paul's death and that is why she is keeping the Company? Meg defends her actions, as Lucinda gets nasty causing Meg to slap her.

        "Craig: Well, I see my crash course has tired you out.",
        "Meg: Business plans, quarterly reports, stock options -- it's a lot to take in.",
        "Craig: Well, you're getting the basics. Give yourself some time.",
        "Meg: I don't know, Craig. Corporate logistics is beyond me.",

        "Meg: I think it might be better if I just hand over Worldwide back to Lucinda.",
        "Craig: It's yours. You can do whatever you want. I do believe, though, that once you get a handle on this, you're going to learn to love it. And who knows -- you might even be a bigger power broker than even Lucinda.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling. I hope you're not falling for the garbage he's spewing out.",

        "Holden: Thank you so much for helping us out.",
        "Lily: If you see this boy, please let us know. All the information is at the bottom of the sheet. He was last seen in Luther's Corners. His name is J.J. Snyder. Thank you. We've handed out so many fliers. I wish someone would recognize him.",
        "Holden: We just need to stay with it.",
        "Lily: Can't this family get a break? If J.J. doesn't come back --",
        "Holden: You know what? You can't think like that. We need to try and stay positive for Jack and Carly.",
        "Lily: I know -- I just wish there was some way.",
        "Merchant: Excuse me.",
        "Lily: You recognize the boy?",
        "Merchant: I saw him yesterday. On the bench, by my store.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Merchant: Yes. He was talking to someone.",
        "Holden: Any idea what the man looked like?",
        "Merchant: Oh, it wasn't a man. It was a red-haired woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: You think his parents have 100 grand?",
        "Ava: If not, they'll get it.",
        "Silas: Does it bother you that you're giving them a sample of your handwriting?",
        "Ava: That's why I wrote it with my left hand, genius. Hey, they can trace computers, too. You want me to cut words out of magazines -- you need to supply the magazines first.",
        "Silas: You're giving me a headache, okay? It's too early for that.",
        "Ava: You're feeding the kid?",
        "Silas: Gotta keep him healthy.",
        "Ava: I don't know why you bother. Especially after the crybaby tried to give us up last night.",
        "Silas: Like I said, I'm protecting our interests.",
        "Ava: You know, you better hope that your parents deliver, pronto.",
        "Silas: How can they when they haven't gotten the letter?",
        "Ava: Oh, they'll get it. And after a night of imagining the worst, they'll be ready to give us anything that we ask for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No word on your end, either? No, I'm betting we're going to hear something soon. Right. Let me know what you find at Carly's place? Thanks. Margo hasn't heard anything, either.",
        "Carly: Why haven't they contacted us, Jack? They've had J.J. all night.",
        "Jack: Maybe they're giving us more time to find this key.",
        "Carly: There is no key.",
        "Jack: They don't know that.",
        "Carly: What if they've got somebody watching us? What if they get angry and they take it out on him?",
        "Jack: It's not going to come to that. We are going to find J.J., Carly.",
        "Carly: When? We don't even know who these people are.",
        "Jack: Easy, easy -- we'll take it one step at a time.",
        "Katie: Coffee's on the table -- pancakes are ready. Anyone hungry?",
        "Carly: How could anybody even think about food?",
        "Jack: Katie's just trying to help, Carly.",
        "Carly: Right. I'm sure she doesn't take it personally.",
        "Katie: No, of course not. I understand.",
        "Carly: How could you? You're not a mother.",
        "Katie: I know how much you love him.",
        "Carly: I don't think anybody knows that. My whole world has just stopped.",
        "Brad: Whoa. What's going on in here? Sounds like someone's upset about you two getting engaged.",
        "Jack: Not now, Brad -- please.",
        "Brad: Hey, Carly -- look, I know it blows, but you've got to look at it this way -- okay? If you can't have Jack, at least you got the best part of him -- his kids.",
        "Jack: Brad --",
        "Brad: Hey, Man, I'm just trying to lighten things up, Man. You know what? You two, the happy couple -- I mean, shouldn't you be celebrating?",
        "Katie: You were wearing those clothes yesterday.",
        "Brad: So what.",
        "Katie: Did you just get home?",
        "Brad: Yeah, it happens -- I mean, you know how it is. So, suppose you tell me why the bride-to-be would care. Wait a second, oh -- perfect timing. Are they still hot? These are really good, by the way. What is going on with you? Why are you guys so down? Something happen with the proposal or what?",
        "Jack: It was cut short, because J.J. was kidnapped.",
        "Brad: What the hell? Wait, you're not kidding?",
        "Brad: Okay -- oh, Man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't know what to say. Was this some -- some revenge thing? Some perp that you arrested that wants to get back at you? Doesn't matter, it doesn't matter -- whatever it is -- what do you need me to do?",
        "Jack: Nothing, no. We're just -- we're just waiting to be contacted.",
        "Brad: Okay, I'm just gonna go upstairs and change and then, you know -- all right, hey, Bud -- it's going to be all right, Man. It's gonna be all right, all right?",
        "Jack: Thank you. Yeah.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Holden: Hey, I've got a lead. I'm with a man who saw J.J. in Old Town yesterday. He recognized him from the flier.",
        "Jack: Tell me.",
        "Holden: He's the guy who owns the antique store. He said J.J. was on a bench talking to some woman.",
        "Jack: When?",
        "Holden: Late yesterday afternoon. He was with her for a while. We're going to head downtown and we're going file a report.",
        "Jack: I'll meet you there.",
        "Carly: Was that them?",
        "Jack: No, it was Holden. He found someone who might be able to help us. I've got to meet Holden at the station.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm gonna go with you.",
        "Jack: No, no, Carly -- I want you to stay here in case J.J. manages to get away and comes home. Please? I'll be in touch.",
        "Katie: Sounds like Holden has a real lead -- that's great news.",
        "Carly: I'll do that, okay?",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. I don't mind.",
        "Carly: You know, I really need something to do right now.",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, in that case, I think I'm going to head over to your house and see if Margo could use any help.",
        "Carly: She's got a whole police force behind her, Katie. Sometimes you've got to sit back and let people do their job!",
        "Katie: I'm just going to check anyway, make sure there's not something I can do.",
        "Carly: I think you've done enough. 'Cause, you know, I can't help thinking, that if it weren't for you, none of this would've happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: A new deadline will cut it close. They'll need time to come up with 100 grand.",
        "Ava: I don't want to drag this out, okay? If they love the kid, they'll come up with the cash as soon as they read my note.",
        "J.J.: But my parents -- they don't have a lot of money, okay? And -- my mom's trying to keep a steady job, and my dad's a cop.",
        "Ava: Yeah, yeah. Life's tough all over, Kid.",
        "Silas: Hey! Watch what you're doing. Don't lose that letter.",
        "Ava: Relax. Just make sure you keep the kid quiet while I'm gone, all right? We don't want any visitors.",
        "Silas: Aren't you forgetting something?",
        "Ava: Like what? Oh, right. Better?",
        "Silas: I don't know. I was beginning to kind of get used to the new you.",
        "Ava: You're all charm, Silas. I won't be long.",
        "J.J.: Now what?",
        "Silas: You know that guy you call your dad? Now we'll see just how much he loves you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Am I understanding this correctly? You're teaching Meg how to be a CEO?",
        "Craig: Well, that's the goal. But we are starting with business fundamentals.",
        "Lucinda: Make sure he teaches you about shady deals, cause he's a master of those.",
        "Craig: Actually, Meg is learning very quickly.",
        "Lucinda: So, despite the annulment, you've assigned the company to Meg? You kept your word?",
        "Craig: And that surprises you?",
        "Lucinda: Not entirely.",
        "Craig: Well, thank you for that.",
        "Lucinda: We both know that keeping your word is a cover for something else. The question now is -- what's in it for you?",
        "Craig: Well, maybe I'm a natural born teacher. I am finding this entire process very satisfying.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, why? Why is that? We both know that you wouldn't be supporting Meg as the CEO unless you were getting something in return.",
        "Craig: Oh, I will. I will. I get to watch you squirm as Meg takes this corporation way beyond your limited horizons.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, now I've got it. He's training you to do his bidding.",
        "Meg: I can think for myself, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, this isn't a nursing school.",
        "Meg: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, Darling -- I mean, don't get your nursing credentials in a twist. I mean, I have nothing against the nursing profession. But for heaven's sake, your checkered career at the hospital -- I mean, you pile mistake upon mistake until you finally had to dwindle into wearing a different kind of uniform as a waitress in a diner. And serving -- I'm sorry, my dear, I'm sorry, but serving a milkshake to me does not make you ready and able to run a corporation like Worldwide.",
        "Meg: I never said I was ready. In fact, I was just telling Craig that I think we should hand the company over to you. It might be the wisest move.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, something sensible at last.",
        "Meg: But as you pointed out, I rarely make wise moves. And since my life has been a series of mistakes, what's one more?",
        "Lucinda: One too many. Let's stick to the original plan.",
        "Meg: I have a new plan. I am keeping the corporation -- for myself.",
        "Lucinda: I take this as a personal betrayal.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, you lost, Lucinda. Just get over it.",
        "Lucinda: Have you made this decision, Meg, out of some misguided anger against me?",
        "Meg: Actually, I'm trying to be positive. My mother suggested that I keep the company and do something worthwhile with it.",
        "Lucinda: Your mother knows nothing about business.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? Since when? She's run a farm almost single-handedly for almost two decades now. And even if she doesn't know anything about business, she knows plenty about me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, so, you think that Mama knows her offspring and so that she has faith that you can do the impossible. Is that it?",
        "Meg: She believes people can reinvent themselves. Even me.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, look. If you blame me and punish me and keep my company for Paul's death, you're helping him.",
        "Meg: My decision has nothing to do with Paul.",
        "Lucinda: Of course it has something to do with Paul. Paul was part of the whole scheme of getting Worldwide back and of settling old scores.",
        "Meg: At the beginning, maybe, but not at the end. Paul wanted to stop.",
        "Lucinda: But neither of you took any action. And so, what happened? The action that was taken led to his untimely death.",
        "Meg: And I blame myself. No one else.",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you blame Craig? He's the one who lured Paul to the cliffs. But, no! You stand here drinking in his every word, his every syllable. And ignoring the fact that the only scheme that worked around here, was his scheme to get rid of Paul Ryan. It's a lifelong objective and he finally accomplished it.",
        "Craig: How many times do I have to say this? Paul slipped. I had no intention of anyone dying.",
        "Lucinda: You hated -- hated Paul. And yet, Meg stands here grieving and loving, and she's blaming me? Blaming me? Why? Oh, you find him that good in bed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Not knowing where J.J. is, there's nothing more stressful. You haven't slept since you got the news. I don't blame you for being upset, but to suggest that I set this in motion --",
        "Carly: I think you did. I think you did set it in motion.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Carly: You were so upset when Jack didn't propose. And you made him feel guilty and embarrassed. And he was pushed into doing something he wasn't ready for. And the children certainly weren't ready for.",
        "Katie: I don't think Jack felt pushed into anything, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, he wouldn't admit it. But I know Jack. And I know my kids. And I know that J.J. agonized over this. His family falling apart, his life changing -- and not for the better.",
        "Katie: Of course it's a big adjustment. Not only for J.J., but Sage and Parker, too. That's why Jack and I were going to talk to the kids together.",
        "Carly: When? After the fact? After he'd already proposed? J.J. felt helpless. It was like his life was changing at warp speed and there was nothing he could do about it. He was vulnerable and he was easy prey for whoever snatched him.",
        "Katie: Stop, please, okay? I am so sick about what's happened to J.J. but it's not because of me!",
        "Carly: Think what you want. I call it like I see it.",
        "Katie: I would never do anything to hurt him. I love him, Carly. I do! He's going to be part of my family.",
        "Carly: No. You may be planning on being Jack's wife, but you will never be a part of J.J.'s family, Katie, so you may as well start facing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: Why are you squirming?",
        "J.J.: I can't sit like this. My leg fell asleep.",
        "Silas: Why haven't you touched your breakfast yet?",
        "J.J.: I can't eat my food.",
        "Silas: Hey, I paid good money for those eggs. Now you chow down, because that's all you're going to get.",
        "J.J.: Like I care.",
        "Silas: You got a smart mouth. You know that? You better shut up, or I'll shut it for you.",
        "J.J.: How am I supposed to eat with both my hands tied behind my back?",
        "Silas: Okay, you made a point. I'll untie one hand and give you a plastic fork. Now, you better not try any funny stuff.",
        "J.J.: Thank you.",
        "Silas: Just finish up before Ava gets back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So you didn't get a close enough look to work with a sketch artist?",
        "Merchant: Sorry, I only the saw the woman from behind.",
        "Jack: No, that's okay. We know the approximate height, weight and hair color. That's more than we knew before. Listen, do you remember seeing this woman either leave with J.J. or follow him at all?",
        "Merchant: No. Honestly, I thought maybe she was his mother.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. I think that's all for now. Thank you. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. If we do bring somebody in, we're going to need you to come back for an I.D. thanks, again.",
        "Holden: Jack, I'm sorry. That wasn't much to go on.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know it was a long shot, but I'm staying with it. Thanks.",
        "Holden: How long has it been since you heard from the kidnappers?",
        "Jack: A long time, which isn't good. It's not the standard protocol.",
        "Holden: Any idea why?",
        "Jack: I don't know what's going on, but I want to think that these people have a plan. Because the thought of them holding my son captive and panicking, it's not good.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, I hear you.",
        "Jack: Before you called, Carly was asking me why the kidnappers haven't called yet.",
        "Holden: What did you say to her?",
        "Jack: It's not so much what I said, it's what I knew she was thinking. That it might be too late. That J.J. might be --",
        "Cop: This was left for you, Jack. It just came in.",
        "Jack: Hold on one second. Thank you.",
        "Holden: From them, huh?",
        "Jack: It looks like it. Looks like they're trying something new.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You may have bribed Sage into wanting you around -- what little girl wouldn't want a shopping spree and a makeover at a TV studio? But J.J. is different. He's not so easily influenced.",
        "Katie: I'm not trying to bribe your kids, Carly.",
        "Carly: J.J. wants me and Jack -- he wants us together.",
        "Katie: Of course he does. That's what every little kid wants. His parents together. But it's not always the best thing for everyone.",
        "Carly: You don't know what's best for anyone except yourself. You expect to be the center of attention, the focus of Jack's life. And if he takes the spotlight off you for even a moment, you crumble. Well, Jack's kids will always come first to him. So, really -- realistically, how long will this romance of yours last? [Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Jack: Carly, I need you to come down to the station right away.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Jack: I'll explain everything when you get here.",
        "Carly: I'll be right there.",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Carly: I have to meet Jack.",
        "Katie: Don't say it. Don't say a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: I need to go to the bathroom.",
        "Silas: That's not gonna happen.",
        "J.J.: Please -- I've been tied up for hours!",
        "Silas: Forget it!",
        "Ava: Mission accomplished.",
        "Silas: What the hell took you so long?",
        "Ava: You didn't think I was going to hand deliver it myself, did you? I slipped some kid $20 to drop it off.",
        "Silas: You're sure Snyder got the note?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I watched my delivery boy go into the station.",
        "Silas: That's your guarantee?",
        "Ava: It's taken care of, all right? Now all we have to do is pick up the cash.",
        "Silas: As long as Snyder does what we ask. Suppose he decides to stick around, or maybe sends a cop friend to see who shows up for the drop?",
        "Ava: Well, that would be stupid. If he wants to see his son alive, he'll do as he's told.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I can get the money. Let me help you out.",
        "Carly: Jack, tell me J.J.'s okay.",
        "Jack: As far as I know, he's fine.",
        "Carly: When you wouldn't say anything on the phone, I got so worried. I kept imagining the worst.",
        "Jack: I want you to look at this. They've given up on the key. They want to go for a cash jackpot.",
        "Carly: \"Put $100,000 in small, unmarked bills, in a white plastic bag. Put the bag in the trash in the alley behind the black duck by noon today.\" Can we do that?",
        "Jack: Keep reading.",
        "Carly: \"We'll leave word where to find the boy. No cops, no tracers, or no kid.\" So that means that J.J.'s okay?",
        "Jack: I'm hoping so, yes.",
        "Carly: They're pretty serious about no cops, huh?",
        "Jack: They want the money, Carly, and they want us to wait to be contacted.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, then we'll borrow against the house. We can do that, right? Can we get the money that quickly?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: By noon, Jack. How are we going to get the money?",
        "Holden: Jack, let me help.",
        "Jack: No, we're not going that route.",
        "Carly: Why? What are you talking about?",
        "Jack: They want the money, Carly, but they're not going to get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Who are you, Meg? Who are you? You say that you love Paul, yet you dishonor him and his memory by climbing into bed with this one.",
        "Craig: That's enough, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: To see you trusting him after what he's done to me, to Lily, to everybody in town --",
        "Craig: You leave now, or I call security.",
        "Lucinda: You go to hell!",
        "Craig: Fine, have it your way. I will.",
        "Lucinda: And you. You really are despicable. Absolutely despicable. Now you're using this girl and her grief and her pain to your own ends.",
        "Craig: Everything that's happening here is Meg's choice.",
        "Meg: It's true. There's a lot of untapped potential in this corporation. Money and resources that could be used to make a difference in the world.",
        "Lucinda: Are you trying to redeem yourself through good works? You've got to make a profit first! And you -- you just can't keep your filthy hands on my company. God knows -- God knows, if you hadn't fooled around with Lily when she was in trouble, you would be on the outside still looking in.",
        "Craig: You are becoming a bitter woman.",
        "Lucinda: That's from dealing with you. Okay, you've been warned. You've been warned. This is a man who thinks of only one person, that's himself. So, stick with him. Stick with him, and he'll take whatever's left of your soul.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on. There's no reason to demonize me. It's just business.",
        "Lucinda: No, it isn't. Not to me, it isn't. No. This was a heritage for my kids. Unlike you, I still have a family. All right, take it. Do it, have it. I give you two months before both you, and it, are dead.",
        "Meg: I wasn't going to keep it, you know.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Meg: As a matter of fact, I was ready to sign it over to her, but when she dismissed me like that --",
        "Craig: You just had to show her how wrong she was. And what a job you did, Meg. Smile, Meg, its better this way.",
        "Meg: Will you still be saying that if I end up running the corporation into the ground?",
        "Craig: That is not going to happen. And do you know why? Because you're not alone in this. As long as I am by your side, there will be checks and balances.",
        "Meg: And you get what you want. Lucinda called it. You're helping me to help yourself. So, Craig, why don't you just tell me exactly how this is going to play out?",
        "Craig: The way I see it, my expertise will support your vision.",
        "Meg: Right, right. Up on some minor projects, while you do exactly as you want with the rest of the corporation. You know, maybe I should have you fired and hire somebody else to run the corporation.",
        "Craig: Well, if you think they'd do a better job --",
        "Meg: Let's stop this. Let's stop pretending that you want me to make my own decisions.",
        "Craig: You asked me to show you the ropes. This is just step one.",
        "Meg: Oh, and then you knew that I'd be overwhelmed and turn to you for steps -- what? Two through infinity?",
        "Craig: It had crossed my mind.",
        "Meg: It was your master plan. To wow me with your willingness to part with the corporation, even though I asked for an annulment.",
        "Craig: All right, fine, Meg. You want it all on the table? Cards on the table? You're right. You're right about everything. I could've kept it all myself. Except, then of course, I'd still be a global pariah. So I decided to attach myself to the good will inherent in a Snyder name and move on.",
        "Meg: You're a global pariah?",
        "Craig: Thank you to Lucinda, too many people know how I got a hold of this corporation. And now, even long-term clients are refusing to do business with Montgomery Enterprises. But with you in that chair, I believe that they will come back to the fold.",
        "Meg: So I would be a facelift for the corporation?",
        "Craig: In a way, yes, but it would also go deeper than that. You do retain ownership.",
        "Meg: Which you ceded to me because you were about to crash and burn.",
        "Craig: That was a slight possibility. Let's just say I didn't want to squeak by on the money that I got from my poor, comatose ex-wife.",
        "Meg: So, what do you know? You did need me -- and so does Worldwide.",
        "Craig: In a word yes. But also, it allows your mother to realize her dream of you doing good for mankind.",
        "Meg: As long as you make a profit, of course.",
        "Craig: As Lucinda pointed out, the two do go hand in hand. From where I sit, this is a win-win proposition.",
        "Meg: You're incredible.",
        "Craig: Why do I think that's not a compliment?",
        "Meg: You know, 24 hours ago, I was about to walk through that door. What if I had?",
        "Craig: That was only a slight possibility.",
        "Meg: What if Lucinda hadn't gotten me mad just now? And I did hand over the company to her?",
        "Craig: That was a risk I was willing to take. You do remember the risk section of our tutorial.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah. Yes, I do. A rigorous and responsible calculation of risk is a cornerstone to good business.",
        "Craig: Well, hey -- you're in a good position to become teacher's pet. So, what do you say? Do we have a deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Does that come with an \"I told you so\"?",
        "Brad: Maybe a cold beer.",
        "Katie: It's not even lunch yet.",
        "Brad: Yeah, right. Well, you know -- I haven't slept yet, so I've lost track.",
        "Katie: You can say it. You just witnessed proof that I'm always going to be an outsider when it comes to Jack and his kids.",
        "Brad: Maybe for now, but not forever.",
        "Katie: I can't even let myself think past tomorrow. Jack's face when he left -- he's thinking the worst. I'm so worried about him. He keeps everything inside!",
        "Brad: I know how my brother thinks. You know, right now, he's doing a number on himself because he didn't prevent this.",
        "Katie: How could he?",
        "Brad: Look, I didn't say it made sense. It doesn't make any sense. But you know, he takes responsibility for everything. And he thinks he can keep his kids safe, no matter what.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, luckily Carly doesn't have that problem. She knows it's all my fault.",
        "Brad: Forget about her. Forget about that. Forget about her. She went after you because she's mad at herself.",
        "Katie: I know she's so upset, so I tried to keep my mouth shut.",
        "Brad: Smart move. Smart move. Look, you can't argue with Carly. No one wins. Believe me, I think I speak from experience.",
        "Katie: I know she resents me, I understand that. But this was just so much worse.",
        "Brad: You're the enemy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, thanks, I knew that.",
        "Brad: Well, you know, in Carly's mind, Jack's hers -- always will be.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? Look, don't try to change Carly. You can't. Hey, the only thing you need to know is that Jack trusts you, and he needs you. And that's exactly what you're going to do. You're going to be there for him.",
        "Katie: I know. I don't know how that's going to happen. We barely said two words to each other since this --",
        "Brad: What, you guys need words?",
        "Katie: No, but --",
        "Brad: Somebody needs to be behind Jack in order for him to get through this. All right? Someone strong enough to speak up when they have to and to stay out of the way -- when she needs to stay out of the way. Okay, so, what you're going to do -- you're going to, take a deep breath with me. Come on. Yeah, okay. Good, okay, you stay calm. You reserve your energy. Because the longer this thing goes on, the more he's going to need you.",

        "Ava: Now, when we get to Old Town, you'll be the lookout while I grab the sack with the cash.",
        "Silas: And I'm putting you in charge of the money, because?",
        "Ava: Because I think on my feet. If someone sees you going through the trash, what are you going to say?",
        "Silas: I was hungry.",
        "Ava: Totally lame.",
        "Silas: What would you say?",
        "Ava: That I lost my mother's ring -- it was so precious. I'd make it into a story.",
        "Silas: Oh, good plan. Make a new friend, so when the cops ask for a description, they've had a nice, long look. Hey! What do you think you're doing?",
        "J.J.: I already told you. I can't stand still. I need to go to the bathroom.",
        "Silas: I told you to hold it.",
        "J.J.: Please!",
        "Ava: Oh, let the kid go to the can already. I don't want to listen to him whine.",
        "Silas: Okay. But hurry up.",

        "J.J.: Ow!",

        "Carly: We have to give them the money, Jack, or we'll never see J.J. again.",
        "Jack: Carly, listen to me. Paying the ransom doesn't mean we're going to get J.J. back.",
        "Carly: Well, we know what not paying the ransom means.",
        "Jack: We can't give them any more leverage, Carly.",
        "Carly: They have our son! What more leverage do they need?",
        "Jack: Listen, we have a better chance of J.J. staying unharmed if we play for time. We stall while we try to locate them.",
        "Carly: No, please -- please, don't take a chance like that with J.J.'s life. It's just money. Just give it to them!",
        "Jack: It won't end there.",
        "Carly: You don't know that.",
        "Jack: You think they're going to keep their word, Carly? They stole our son -- they're holding him captive, and God knows how they're treating him. We have a better way, we have a better chance of getting J.J. back if we tell them that we're trying to get the money, but we need more time. That way we still have something they want. We stay in the position of power, and J.J. will stay safe.",
        "Carly: We hope.",
        "Holden: Listen, I'm going to go update my mother and Meg. If you need anything, let me know.",
        "Jack: Thank you. We will. I know you're scared. Experience tells me this is the way to play it. You've got to trust me, Carly.",
        "Carly: I have to check on Sage. I have to make sure she hasn't heard anything.",
        "Jack: What about Parker? It's going to be a lot harder to keep him from finding out from one of his friends. I can call the Lebos, if you want.",

        "Jack: Yeah? Yeah, I'll be right there. You can use this phone if you like. I have to get down to the lab.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, if I say yes, what am I agreeing to? Does that mean we'd be partners?",
        "Craig: You would still be CEO.",
        "Meg: As a figurehead, right? I'd be the front person while you structured all the deals?",
        "Craig: More or less.",
        "Meg: So I could be anyone?",
        "Craig: Oh, no, no, no. I need somebody I can trust. Just like you will need someone you can trust behind the scenes making all the set-ups, doing all the arrangements for the deals you want to cut.",
        "Meg: So we'd cover for each other?",
        "Craig: Exactly. We would use each other's strengths.",
        "Meg: You know, I did mean what I said about doing some good with the corporation.",
        "Craig: That's fine, that's fine. Done right, altruism can be good for business.",
        "Meg: You might even like it.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, stranger things have happened.",

        "Brad: Yeah, I do. I mean, yeah, he's been, you know -- he's practically human since you two have found each other or whatever. I think you should keep going.",
        "Katie: You're not just saying that?",
        "Brad: I can be a jerk about a lot of things, but I'm not going to mess around about something this serious.",
        "Katie: I just wish we'd hear something about J.J. just something.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe no good news is good good news.",

        "Holden: So you got a description?",
        "Jack: Yeah. He was pretty good on the details. He's working with the sketch artist right now.",
        "Holden: Do you think it was the same woman that J.J. was with in Old Town?",
        "Jack: No, I really don't think so, because that woman has short, red hair. This woman, he said, had long brown hair.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but we know that there's two kidnappers, right? [Cell phone rings] It's Faith. Hey, Honey, what's up? Right now? I thought you were going to swim with your counselors. Okay.
