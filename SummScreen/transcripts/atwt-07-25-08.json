        "Holden: Please, just -- just hear me out. I ran into Luke earlier. [Lily sighs] Seeing him, hearing him -- it really put things in perspective.",
        "Lily: I told him that I didn't want this to come between you two.",
        "Holden: Well, Luke is on your side, as he should be. What I did was wrong. He's not about to give me a free pass.",
        "Lily: Frankly, I never thought you'd need Luke to be your moral compass, or anybody else, for that matter.",
        "Holden: Lily, I know that I've hurt you, and I'm not about to make any excuses here. But can you at least just listen to what I'm saying before we take any legal action? I think we owe it to ourselves to at least do everything that we can.",
        "Lily: What are you asking me to do?",
        "Holden: If there's a chance that we can save our marriage, then I think we owe it to ourselves to try. What I'm asking is for you not to give up -- not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Gonna have to take a rain check on that ice cream cone.",
        "Janet: What? What, has something happened with Parker?",
        "Jack: Carly happened. She's finally realizing that her actions have consequences, and now she needs my help cleaning up her mess.",
        "Janet: Well, that's not fair.",
        "Jack: No. No, it's not fair at all. But that's how it is. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Thank you for the drink, Henry, but I will pass on the phony legal work.",
        "Henry: Wait. No, hold on one second. Wait. Just hear me out. Just hear me out, please, please. You and I both know that Vienna would love it here. She -- she was born to be the hostess with the mostess.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I suppose that beats running a bordello.",
        "Henry: Be nice. But speaking of sex on demand, she's been so upset lately that she's been withholding some of my conjugal rights.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you're not married, so technically, you have no rights.",
        "Henry: Thanks for the unsolicited advice, Counsel.",
        "Bonnie: Well, it's the last free advice I'm gonna give you.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please, just one last favor, Bonnie -- one last favor. I have a plan to bring Vienna around, and you are the only person that can make it look legal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Hello, Vienna. I'm looking for Henry.",
        "Vienna: Why am I not surprised?",
        "Bonnie: Is he here?",
        "Vienna: No, he's not.",
        "Bonnie: Do you know where I can find him?",
        "Vienna: What do you want?",
        "Bonnie: Well, uh, this is for him. It's something really personal and confidential.",
        "Vienna: It's okay. You can leave it with me.",
        "Bonnie: Mm. That's only if you can promise you won't look at it.",
        "Vienna: What do you think I am?",
        "Bonnie: Do you really want me to answer that?",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "[Bonnie laughs]",
        "Bonnie: So, uh, just give that to Henry. Don't open it. I mean that. Okay?",
        "Vienna: Bye, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Bye-bye.",
        "Vienna: Bye.",
        "[Bonnie goes outside and looks in the window to watch Vienna]",
        "[Vienna opens up the envelope and reads the papers]",
        "Vienna: Henry and I don't have any secrets. Oh! Henry loves me so much. I love him, too.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Henry: Hey. Any luck?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. The fish took the bait. Getting her in the net is up to you, Henry.",
        "Henry: All right. Don't worry. I know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You've been very quiet.",
        "Lily: I'm not sure what to say.",
        "Holden: Say that you'll give us another chance.",
        "Lily: Holden, I did everything I could to try to save our marriage, because I thought that's what we both wanted. But I was wrong.",
        "Holden: I understand why you feel that way.",
        "Lily: It's just very hard to trust you right now.",
        "Holden: I know. I've done a lot of damage to our relationship.",
        "Lily: What am I supposed to do? Am I -- am I supposed to just wave a magic wand and pretend like you never slept with Carly?",
        "Holden: I think we just need to -- to give you some time. We need to let things settle down. Neither one of us is in any shape to make a decision right now, especially a decision that we might regret for the rest of our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker locked himself in his room. He won't even talk to me.",
        "Jack: Are you surprised he's upset? Lily and Holden are family. Parker stayed with them at the farm. They were pretty much his second parents when you took off with Simon.",
        "Carly: Oh. That's nice. Did you have to bring that up, Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm just saying, Carly, our son is old enough to know that Lily and Holden are having problems, and they were just getting themselves back on track when you threw yourself in the mix. How do you think that makes him feel?",
        "Carly: That's exactly what I'm worried about. Whenever Parker thinks that I've done something wrong, he -- he acts out. And the question is, how far will he go this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: My dad's here.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I've got to go.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Um, can I -- can I just ask you a question?",
        "Liberty: Sure.",
        "Parker: Um, was it okay?",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Parker: I mean, was -- was it the way it's supposed to be?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I've never done it before.",
        "Parker: You haven't?",
        "Liberty: Parker, just because I'm, um, older than you doesn't mean I'm a slut.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no, no. I didn't say you were.",
        "Liberty: You didn't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't know what Parker will do, but I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to get back at you somehow.",
        "Carly: So no matter what happens, it will be my fault.",
        "Jack: You're the one that slept with Holden.",
        "Carly: Can we just try to help our son without using this situation to beat up on me?",
        "Jack: What were you gonna say?",
        "Carly: I wanted you to know that it is totally over between me and Holden. We will not be seeing each other at all.",
        "Jack: Good luck with that.",
        "Carly: I understand you being skeptical. I really do. But I would like for us to work together right now to help Parker.",
        "Jack: Helping Parker's a given. But as far as you and I are concerned, Carly, we are not working together on anything. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What I said before -- I did not mean for it to make you feel bad.",
        "Liberty: Whatever.",
        "Parker: Okay, look, I seriously had no idea that it was your first time.",
        "Liberty: Oh, really? I was just that good, huh?",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean for it to sound that way. I --",
        "Liberty: I should go.",
        "Parker: No, no, no. Can we talk?",
        "Liberty: No! This whole thing with your parents downstairs -- it's just too weird.",
        "Parker: Hey, you want to hang out tomorr -- great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We are still Parker's parents. We need to show him that we are on the same page.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: I have no idea what page you're on lately. How many times am I supposed to help you fix your mistakes, Carly? You're the one that had the affair. You undo the damage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ethan said he'd go to sleep if I promised he'd didn't have any more bad dreams. Thank God he's too young to understand what's going on.",
        "Holden: Let's not make it worse for him, okay? Let's just put off any legal action for now.",
        "Lily: I honestly don't see what good waiting will do.",
        "Holden: Maybe it will stop us from making more mistakes.",
        "Lily: Don't equate my hiring a lawyer with what you and Carly did.",
        "Holden: I'm not. I'm not. But there's a pattern here. We've hurt each other -- me with Carly, you with Dusty. You know, things blow up, and instead of trying to work it out, we just shut down. We've always made our way back. This time, it shouldn't be any different.",
        "Lily: What if it is different.",
        "Holden: Well, then, at least we'll know that we've tried. If we just -- we just let things -- let things settle down, maybe we can make our way back.",
        "Lily: I wish I could believe that would work.",
        "Holden: So what are you saying? That there's no hope?",
        "Lily: This affair with Carly -- I think it was your way of ending things between us for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, my sweetheart, you are the most perfect man in the entire world.",
        "Henry: Well, I've heard rumors to that affect. But, uh, what's up, Liebchen? I thought you were mad at me.",
        "Vienna: Not anymore, because I just found out that you are planning to sell your shares of Metro.",
        "Henry: Damn! Now, how did you get that?! We weren't supposed to see that!",
        "Vienna: I know. From Bonnie. But forget about her. This is the most important thing. You are actually listening to me and what I want.",
        "Henry: It was supposed to be a surprise.",
        "Vienna: I know! But let's have some champagne and celebrate.",
        "Henry: Okay. Coming right up. You know, I -- I wanted it to be a done deal before you found out. I -- I didn't want you to feel guilty that I was giving up my stake in this club -- a club that I invested in for you, to make you happy. I mean, I didn't want you to, like, get down on yourself just because I was willing to put aside all the dreams I had for our future, you and I.",
        "Vienna: Oh.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Dreams -- included a very glamorous future and fantastic business opportunity and, uh -- oh, you know, a surefire solution to the dire financial straits we may find ourselves in if the -- if the diner doesn't put us in the black. But who cares? Who cares about all of that? This is what you want. And I want you to be happy. So I'll just go ahead and sign those papers and, uh -- and we can just kiss it all goodbye.",
        "Vienna: Yes! Let's kiss it all goodbye. Goodbye and good riddance. I don't need all those things, because I have the very best thing -- you, Henry.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Props to you, Lib. You're not a virgin anymore.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Janet: Hello? Anybody home? Oh, hey! Liberty, hi. How's my baby girl?",
        "Liberty: Mm.",
        "Janet: Hey, are we alone?",
        "Liberty: Uh, yeah. Brad and Katie -- they're out.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. Okay, great. Listen, I just want to make sure you're not upset over the way Bradley freaked out about the whole birth control thing. Because he thinks that by me giving it to you, I'm encouraging you to have sex, which I am so not.",
        "Liberty: Whatever.",
        "Janet: Okay. Just so you know where I'm coming from. I just -- I don't want you to have to deal with things before you're ready.",
        "Liberty: Um, Mom, I don't really want to talk about this right now, okay?",
        "Janet: Why not? We talk about everything. No secrets, remember? Hey. What's the matter with you? Why are you so distant? Liberty, look at me. Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I can't change what happened with Holden. All I can do is guarantee that it will never happen again.",
        "Jack: I think you should refrain from making promises unless you're sure you can keep them.",
        "Carly: I know you're angry, Jack, but I need you to promise something, too.",
        "Jack: What is it?",
        "Carly: I need you to promise me that you're not gonna try to take my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what? I -- I'm confused about a lot of things right now, but one thing I know without a doubt -- I did not get involved with Carly to break up this marriage.",
        "Lily: Maybe it wasn't a conscious choice. But you know what? Our relationship never completed healed after I was with Dusty. And maybe you didn't want it to heal, and that's why you slept with my best friend, knowing that I could never get over that.",
        "Holden: Okay, so what's the difference? You slept with your best friend.",
        "Lily: The fact that you don't know the answer to that says a lot.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. Fine. We -- we were separated at the time you -- were with Dusty.",
        "Lily: I was trying to get our marriage back together when you slept with Carly! I -- I'd say that that's a big difference!",
        "Holden: You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. But I promise you, it -- it will never -- never happen again.",
        "Lily: How do you know that? I mean, you said it yourself. We have broken up and gotten back together more times than anybody can count. How many more times can we walk out on each other, separate, file for divorce? How can we keep uprooting our children, breaking their hearts?",
        "Holden: That's why I want this to stop. I really believe that we can find our way back from this. Keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Which means the only way to truly stop hurting everyone is to just let go.",
        "Lily: You said that you still have feelings for Carly. Go ahead. Go ahead. Act on them. Be with her. I'm giving you your freedom.",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't want my freedom.",
        "Lily: Are your feelings for Carly suddenly gone? Are they?!",
        "Holden: I told you, it's over.",
        "Lily: What's over? The affair, or your feelings?",
        "Holden: You know what? It -- it doesn't matter.",
        "Lily: It matters to me!",
        "Holden: Lily, I want our family back. And before we go calling lawyers, I think we need to re-evaluate what we're doing here and do what's best for our kids.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, but I have made up my mind. I'm going ahead with the divorce.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm not giving up. That's my choice. I choose to believe that our family still has a future. You know where to find me.",
        "[Lily sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I have no intention of taking the kids away from you, Carly. It's the last thing they need -- to be taken away from their mother again.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: You can't hurt these kids anymore.",
        "Carly: I agree. Least -- least we can still agree on something.",
        "Jack: You see? I'm not as bad as you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You cannot run away from this.",
        "Liberty: From what, Mom? I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Janet: You can't fool me! I was your age once, and I will never forget it.",
        "Liberty: Forget what?",
        "Janet: That look on your face right there says it all.",
        "Liberty: Well, I don't know what you're talking about, so --",
        "Janet: You did it with Parker, didn't you?",
        "Liberty: What? Mom, we did not do it. Seriously.",
        "Janet: Swear to God. Swear on the holy bible.",
        "Liberty: I swear. What do you want from me?",
        "Janet: I want the truth. Just because I gave you that birth control is not an invitation for you to use it. You are way too young.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Parker remembering]",
        "Parker: Like, was -- was it the way it's supposed to be?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I've never done it before.",
        "Parker: You haven't?",
        "Liberty: Parker, just because I'm, um, older than you doesn't mean I'm a slut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: How could I be such a jerk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Having sex is a very powerful thing. And when you do it too soon, it can really mess you up. You know, it makes you do stupid things. Brings out all your insecurities. Do you hear what I'm saying?",
        "Liberty: I hear you, Mom, 'cause I'm not deaf.",
        "Janet: Listen, take it from me, from painful experience. It is much better to wait until you're older, when you can handle all those feelings, you know? And -- and you find someone that you really, really want to be with. And hopefully, that person will really want to be with you, too.",
        "Liberty: I've heard this a million times.",
        "Janet: I know. I'm gonna tell you a million more times.",
        "Liberty: Well, I have homework to do, so --",
        "Janet: Listen, I want to know exactly what happened. Tell me --",
        "Liberty: Just trust me, Mom, please! Please, just trust me.",
        "Janet: Okay. But just in case you did do it, that doesn't mean that you have to do it again. Because like I said to you before, you're way too young. I love you.",
        "Liberty: Thanks, Mom, for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What are you waiting for, Henry?",
        "Henry: Um, olives. Got to have some olives.",
        "Vienna: No, I mean the papers. Why aren't you signing it? If -- if you want to sell your share back to Carly, you might -- you may as well just get on with it.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. But you know what? If, um -- if I sign them before I finish this drink, then I'd have to pay for it.",
        "Vienna: Don't be silly.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. With our new downsized lifestyle, we've got to be cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but we're happy. And you -- you are about to get a lot happier.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah. Debtor's prison. Oh, what joy.",
        "Vienna: No. I mean when I take you home and ravish over and over again and then make you beg for more. Hmm?",
        "Henry: Yeah, that could -- that could make me happier.",
        "Vienna: Yeah?",
        "Henry: I think you're right. Hey, uh, Bobbie, will you cover for me, please? And if, uh -- if Carly calls, tell her, uh -- I got it. Tell him I'm indisposed.",
        "Vienna: He means forever.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm just gonna check on Parker. [Doorbell rings] Janet, what are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sure she didn't come by to see me.",
        "Janet: Sorry. I really need to borrow your ex. Jack, I need to talk to you -- private.",
        "Jack: Sure. Yeah. Uh -- tell Parker I'll check on him later, okay? Let's go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I need some guidance. I didn't know who else to turn to. I love my wife. I want to do what's best for her. Want to do what's best for my family. But the truth is, there's another woman. And God help me, I love her, too.",
        "Holden: Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi. I didn't expect to see you here. We promised not to see each other anymore.",
        "Holden: Well, obviously, this wasn't intentional.",
        "Carly: Right. Makes sense, though, doesn't it? Couple of sinners looking for forgiveness.",
        "Holden: Are you okay?",
        "Carly: Not really. I'm -- I'm not very popular at home right now.",
        "Holden: Hmm. Join the club.",
        "Carly: You -- you're gonna think I'm joking, but I came here to ask God to tell me how to become a totally different person.",
        "Holden: I hope that doesn't happen. Did you hear what I was saying when you walked in?",
        "Carly: If I did, I think it would be better for both of us to pretend I didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Oh, oh!",
        "Vienna: Oh!",
        "Henry: Oh! Wow! Look! We have ignition! We have lift-off! Watch it. Watch it. Oh!",
        "Vienna: You are sending me to the stars every time. We don't need a club to put us in orbit.",
        "Henry: You're totally right. [Vienna laughs] But, uh -- but we really should talk, I think.",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Vienna: We should.",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Vienna: Me first, my darling Henry.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. Mm!",
        "Vienna: You're -- you're finally listening to me. You gave me exactly what I wanted. Mm!",
        "Henry: Well, I, uh -- it's very tricky. I almost lost my balance in there. But once I hit my stride, it was pretty much heaven, don't you think?",
        "Vienna: No. I'm not talking about your technique, silly. I'm talking about how you finally understand me and you -- you're realizing that I don't need a glamorous lifestyle anymore. We are -- we might be poor, but we are rich in all the ways that count, right?",
        "Henry: Right. Right. You're all that I'll ever need.",
        "Vienna: Make love to me again.",
        "Henry: Hmm?",
        "Vienna: Unless you still want to talk.",
        "Henry: No. I don't -- I don't need us to talk when I can practice not losing my balance again.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So, are you sure your Aunt Emma's gone?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. We are the only ones here. What -- what is so urgent?",
        "Janet: Well, I -- I'm building up to it. I thought I'd, you know, ply you with some cherry pie a la mode, sweeten you up before I told you the news.",
        "Jack: Okay. What -- what now?",
        "Janet: You're not gonna like it. The news. Not the pie.",
        "Jack: Tell me, Janet. Just tell me.",
        "Janet: Okay. I tracked down Liberty earlier and -- well, there's just no easy way to say this. I think your Parker and my Liberty are doing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Parker calls Liberty, but gets her voice mail]",
        "Liberty: Hey, you got Liberty, but I got better things to do. So leave a message.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I didn't mean to disturb you. I should go.",
        "Holden: No, don't. You have just as much right to be here as I do.",
        "Carly: Have you seen Lily? Or are you here praying for the courage to face her?",
        "Holden: No. I saw her earlier. Tried to get her to change her mind, but I can't reason with her. She's calling a lawyer.",
        "Carly: Don't give up. You do whatever you have to do. You get her to take you back.",
        "Holden: That's what I was hoping to do.",
        "Carly: Don't say you've changed your mind.",
        "Holden: The truth is, only part of me wants to go back to Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Emma.",
        "Emma: Hey.",
        "Lily: I -- I wasn't expecting you. Would you like an iced tea or --",
        "Emma: No, no. No, thank you, Sweetheart. There's -- there's only one thing I want, and I think, in your heart, you want it, too.",
        "Lily: Is this about Holden?",
        "Emma: Of course, it's about Holden. Oh, Lily, what he did was unforgivable. It was a horrible, horrible mistake, and he regrets it. He really regrets it deeply. I know this hasn't been easy for you. For Holden's sake, for your sake, for the children's sake, can't you find it in your heart to -- to forgive him? Can you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Mm!",
        "Henry: I got to go.",
        "Bonnie: From the looks of that kiss, your plan actually worked, huh?",
        "Henry: No. Actually, I'm afraid it backfired.",
        "Bonnie: What? What, are you kidding?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. She decided to stick with Al's and, uh, have a life of poverty, peddling pepparkakor. Say that five times fast.",
        "Bonnie: How could you let this happen, Henry?",
        "Henry: I thought that -- I thought that by pretending to give her what she wanted that she would see the other side. And, unfortunately, she did not bite.",
        "Bonnie: So what, are you gonna give up now?",
        "Henry: No. I can't do that. There has got to be another way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So she denied it, of course, upside down and sideways, but she didn't fool me. I've got ESP when it comes to s-e-x.",
        "Jack: If -- if you're right about this, Janet, it never should have happened. He's not ready for this. He's just a kid.",
        "Janet: So is Liberty. Which is why I tried to keep her from making the same mistake that I did. She didn't listen.",
        "Jack: He's had such a tough year, and this -- this is just gonna make matters worse.",
        "Janet: Well, it must be tough to be a teenager with raging hormones.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, it -- we kind of made it easy for him.",
        "Janet: I knew it. I knew you would think this was all my fault, because I got Liberty the birth control. I swear to you, Jack, I never meant to encourage her.",
        "Jack: Really? Because that's exactly what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Parker: Hey, it's Parker. You know the drill. Leave a message.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Come on, Jack! It is not fair to blame me for all of this! It takes two to tango! Parker just found out that his mother is having an affair with a married man.",
        "Jack: He's still underage!",
        "Janet: -- Ideas in his head!",
        "Jack: He's still underage!",
        "Janet: I know! And he is too young to have a baby. So you should be damn glad that I made sure that he's not gonna have one.",
        "Jack: What -- just bec -- just because you gave Liberty protection doesn't mean she used it.",
        "Janet: Oh, she's using it, because I told her things to scare her to death! Don't. Don't blame me for this, Jack.",
        "Jack: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Janet: That's what I'm hearing.",
        "Jack: There's a fine line, Janet -- there's a fine line. So you give someone protection and what did you expect, that she was just gonna put it in a drawer and forget the whole thing? I mean, this -- this entire process does seem a little bit like encouragement to me. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: I have done everything to discourage her since the day she was born. Since before she was even old enough to know exactly what I was talking about, I've been discouraging her!",
        "Jack: Right! And what you've been saying, though, and what you did were two completely different things, no?",
        "Janet: Listen. We are not going to get anywhere by arguing. How are we gonna handle our kids?",
        "Jack: That's a great question. Parker.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Parker: Hi, Dad.",
        "Janet: Hey, uh, you want some pie?",
        "Parker: No, thanks.",
        "Jack: What's up, Buddy?",
        "Parker: I was thinking, you know, that fishing trip that you wanted to take me on.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Parker: I guess I want to go after all.",
        "Jack: Oh, that -- that's great. Yeah. Um, we'll go tonight. Why don't you go check out, uh, the rods and grab my tackle box and put it in the truck?",
        "Parker: Okay. Thanks, Dad.",
        "Jack: Yeah. That solves one problem. Least we can get these two away from each other for a little while and I can have a serious talk with Parker while we're away. In the meantime, you need to lay down the law with Liberty.",
        "Janet: That's easier said than done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Lily, Holden is the love of your life. He always has been, and he always will be. And you're his. You know, you've loved each other since you were children.",
        "Lily: I know we have, but just because we've logged in a lot of time doesn't guarantee that we've done anything right.",
        "Emma: What?! What did you just say? You -- you have created a family. You have beautiful children that -- that depend on you doing the right thing. Don't you ever forget that. What you've created is something very, very, very special. It's much too precious to throw away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We should never have allowed ourselves to have feelings for each other.",
        "Holden: You think we could have controlled that?",
        "Carly: No. I guess not. I tried.",
        "Holden: I tried. Didn't work. So what are we supposed to do now?",
        "Carly: I guess we'll take those feelings, we put them aside, and then we put one foot in front of the other, try to fix what we've broken.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but how? How am I supposed to pretend that I don't want you?",
        "Carly: You always do the right thing. For once in my life, I'm gonna do the same thing. What other choice do we have?",
        "[Carly sighs]",
