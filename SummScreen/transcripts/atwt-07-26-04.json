        "Doc: These are prenatal vitamins. You've have tons of books on the joys of pregnancy --",
        "Jessica: I told you that Ben and I were trying to have a baby. What's the big deal?",
        "Doc: Well, obviously that trying paid off or you wouldn't be taking those vitamins, right? Why are you being so secretive about this?",
        "Jessica: Because, Doc, it's none of your business! Okay. You know, you're right. I'm pregnant. And Ben and I just wanted to wait to get through the first trimester before -- what? Why are you looking at me like that? This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Doc: Or does it have everything to do with me? How pregnant are you?",
        "Jessica: I'm through having this conversation --",
        "Doc: No, you're not through with anything! How pregnant are you?",
        "Jessica: Doc, please, just let it go.",
        "Doc: Damn! I didn't want to be right about this. This baby -- you think it's mine, don't you?",

        "Margo: I didn't know that anyone was here.",
        "Tom: Honey, you remember Jill. From the Country Club?",
        "Margo: Yeah, sure. Jill, did you want to see me?",
        "Jill: Mr. Hughes, I -- thank you for listening.",
        "Margo: What did she say to you?",
        "Tom: Well, that depends on what you're trying to do. Are you trying to find out what I know so you can spin it?",
        "Margo: That woman did not come here out of kindness. She's out to hurt me, Tom.",
        "Tom: Why? Because you stole Doc Reese from her? Yeah, I've heard all about it. Boy, that little kiss turned into quite a bit more, didn't it? You and Doc. You guys got around. The locker room, the steam room -- you two took some amazing chances in some very public places where anyone could have walked in on you -- me, for a matter of fact. But maybe -- was that just supposed to be part of the thrill of it all?",
        "Margo: No, it wasn't supposed to be part of anything! Tom, none of this was planned, it just -- it happened the steam room was supposed to be empty --",
        "Tom: Give it up! I heard every lie you've told me! And now I've heard the facts. And I'm done listening.",

        "Paul: Ducking out on me?",
        "Rosanna: I have a meeting. I told you.",
        "Paul: You did? Well, how long you gonna be?",
        "Rosanna: Late.",
        "Paul: Can I come?",
        "Rosanna: No -- I don't know. When you do that, I forget.",
        "Paul: That's kinda the point.",
        "Rosanna: I can't. I have responsibilities.",
        "Paul: Okay, lady mogul, you go run a business. But when you're done, you and I are definitely going to take advantage of the fact that Cabot's out with Jennifer and Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yeah, how are we gonna do that?",
        "Paul: Well, I can serve you dinner. Have a conversation.",
        "Rosanna: I can't, this meeting --",
        "Paul: Okay, I won't beg. But dinner will be waiting.",

        "Rosanna: I want my husband back.",
        "Barbara: Oh my, this is news, isn't it? Here, I thought you wanted an annulment. I thought you and Jordan --",
        "Rosanna: I've decided that I want a real marriage. I believe I owe that to my son.",
        "Barbara: And does my son know about this?",
        "Rosanna: Paul is a friend. That's as far as it goes.",
        "Barbara: Does he know that?",
        "Rosanna: We're discussing Jennifer. I need to get Jennifer away from Jordan, so I can have some time alone with him. Which is where you come in. So, are you going to help me or not?",
        "Barbara: Let's talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Carly? Are you still there?",
        "Carly: You're sure Jack didn't make it to the hospital yet? Maybe he took Starziak to the clinic?",
        "Hal: We've got guys all over Memorial looking for him. He could have made it there and back twice by now. He's not answering his cell. Are you sure he took it with him?",
        "Carly: I talked to him right after he left.",
        "Hal: I don't understand this.",
        "Carly: Maybe he had car trouble.",
        "Hal: And didn't call?",
        "Carly: Maybe he's just taking extra precautions. Maybe he doesn't want to be distracted talking on the phone while he's got a prisoner in the car.",
        "Hal: Yeah, the guy is dangerous.",
        "Carly: Jack will call me soon. He promised he would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All right, we'll stay in touch. Carly doesn't know where Jack is, either.",
        "Nikki: Do you think that means he's in trouble?",
        "Hal: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: What does he think happened?",
        "Carly: Nothing happened. Jack probably just took that goon to a different hospital. Or had a flat tire. Or Starziak went into shock from his injuries, and Jack had to take care of him. It could have been a million things. Jack's fine.",
        "Parker: Jack's not home yet?",
        "Carly: No. No, sweetie. But he will be soon.",

        "Starziak: Oh!",
        "Jack: Stop moving!",
        "Starziak: I'll stop when you're dead.",
        "Jack: The car will go off the bridge and kill us both.",
        "Starziak: I'll take my chances. What the?",
        "Jack: Hold on! Hold on! We're going down!",
        "[Both scream]",

        "Carly: Hey, sweetie? Why don't you go upstairs and pick out a story, and we'll read it. And then I think you should go to sleep. Okay?",
        "Holden: I put a call in to Bob Hughes and Ben, who are at the hospital. They're going to get back to me. I thought maybe they might have seen Jack.",
        "Molly: Any luck?",
        "Holden: I'm going to drive the route between here and the hospital. If Jack is stranded somewhere, I'll find him.",
        "Parker: Mom. I can't find my book.",
        "Carly: I'll be right there. Would you call me?",
        "Holden: I will.",
        "Carly: If you hear anything at all?",
        "Holden: Just exactly how hurt was Starziak when Jack put him in the car?",
        "Molly: He was bleeding where I hit him in the head. And the creep said I broke his arm.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, I wish you'd done more than that.",
        "Molly: Even when he was handcuffed, he was just staring at me like he couldn't wait for another shot at me. I couldn't take it. That's why I begged Jack get him out of here.",
        "Holden: It's okay. There's no way that Jack wouldn't have taken him on his own if Jack didn't think that he could handle it.",
        "Molly: I mean, Starziak wasn't in any shape to hurt Jack. Oh God, that's what you're thinking, isn't it?",
        "Holden: The sooner I find Jack, the sooner we'll find out. Lock up behind me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You're jumping to conclusions.",
        "Doc: We had sex. You're having a baby.",
        "Jessica: This is not your baby.",
        "Doc: How do you know it's not my baby?",
        "Jessica: It can't be! Ben is my husband, I love him. And he is already so much in love with this child --",
        "Doc: I'm sure he is. But that doesn't mean it's his.",
        "Jessica: We prayed for this, both of us. And I refuse to believe that this miracle that I have longed for is the result of some impulsive, crazy, stupid mistake with I made with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It was a mistake for me not to be honest with you from the very beginning, I know that. But that's why I came home here, tonight. To tell you everything.",
        "Tom: I already heard that story! You remember that story? That's the one where u and Doc Reese had one kiss.",
        "Margo: All right, it was more than one kiss. It was more than one kiss on a couple of different chance meetings. But, Tom, I swear to you, we never took it over the line. We never slept together, I swear to you. I just didn't want you to find out about it like this.",
        "Tom: You didn't want me to find out!",
        "Margo: All right. All right. I took the coward's way out, I did. I admit it. But, I couldn't keep it up any longer. It was eating away at me. So I promised myself that I was going to come home here tonight and tell you the truth.",
        "Tom: Why? Why tonight? What suddenly happened that makes you so anxious to tell all?",
        "Tom: It's already been said by Jill what's-her-name from the Country Club! What a mess you were when she finally got Doc to unlock the door to the women's locker room! One of her friends saw you and Doc coming out of the steam room, wearing a couple of towels!",
        "Margo: She's making that so much worse than it was --",
        "Tom: She didn't even know the whole story about you and Doc rolling around on the ground when Alison Stewart caught you in the park.",
        "Margo: You're not even going to try to listen to me here, are you?",
        "Tom: What are you going to do?! What are you going to say?! Deny it?! What are you going to deny? Which look, which touch, which kiss, which lie? Well, go ahead! Tell me it's not true! Tell me, dammit! Tell me it's not true!",
        "Margo: I can't. I can't. I can't deny any of it. I can't.",
        "Tom: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So you want me to create a distraction?",
        "Rosanna: Something that will pry Jennifer away from Jordan long enough --",
        "Barbara: To consummate your marriage?",
        "Rosanna: This isn't easy for me, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: And why is that? You claim that you want your husband and your marriage, and yet, you're saying that it's so difficult?",
        "Rosanna: I don't like hurting people.",
        "Barbara: Somehow, I think the discussion just switched from Jennifer to Paul.",
        "Rosanna: Paul will understand. He's my friend. He'll understand why I have to do this.",
        "Barbara: My son is in love with you. Are you willing to throw that away?",
        "Rosanna: I'd give u p my life for Cabot. It's what you'd do for your children.",
        "Barbara: And yet knowing that, you think that I would willingly break their hearts? For you?",
        "Rosanna: To save them. From James. I know you're terrified of Jennifer and Paul being drawn back into James' orbit. And because of that, I believe you'll help me.",
        "Barbara: Do what?",
        "Rosanna: Help me arrange to keep Jordan with me and to cut Jennifer and Paul out of the picture. Even if it hurts them.",
        "Barbara: I have to say, your request is quite interesting -- and presumptuous.",
        "Rosanna: Quit stalling, Barbara. We both know this is what you want. And this game you're playing is wearing me out.",
        "Barbara: What game is that, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I know what you did. I know.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Barbara: Who is it?",
        "Paul: It's me, Mom. Come on, open up.",
        "Barbara: Hide. Hi, honey. What a nice surprise. I was just heading out.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, this won't take long. I just wanted to set the record straight. It's about Rosanna and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Hey, don't worry, Jessica. I'm not going to make any kind of claim here.",
        "Jessica: So, you're saying you won't care if the baby turns out to be yours?",
        "Doc: I care. Hell yeah, I care. But, come one, let's face it. I can't even commit to a lunch date, much less a family. And I've already put one marriage on the skids. I'm not making it two for two.",
        "Jessica: Well, you're very accommodating. But there's someone else who might not be so accommodating.",
        "Doc: Who?",
        "Jessica: Margo. You may not care that the baby might be yours, but she does. And she's threatened to tell Ben.",
        "Doc: Oh, come on. She'd never do that.",
        "Jessica: Well, she's hurt and she's angry. And she thinks I slept with you deliberately because I was jealous -- of her and you.",
        "Doc: Margo could have had me. She knows that. And, besides that, she's your friend. She'd never drop a bomb like that on you, much less Ben.",
        "Jessica: I'm wouldn't be so sure about that.",
        "Ben: What the hell is this man doing in my house?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I never slept with Doc.",
        "Tom: But you wanted to. So go ahead. You want to tell the truth? Come on, let's hear it! Let's hear the truth!",
        "Margo: There were impulses. There was an attraction --",
        "Tom: And that wasn't cheating? What, having public make out sessions with some other guy is less of a violation of our vows than sleeping with him? You know what? I saw it. I saw it. The first time he laid eyes on you -- and you know what got me? You know what hit me? I saw you look back at him, and I knew right then, what you were going to do.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Tom: I heard that apology, and I accepted it for what it was worth! Nothing! How do you expect us to have a reconciliation, when the entire thing is based on a lie?",
        "Margo: Because, my God, Tom, I didn't want to lose you! I knew how little it meant in my heart. And so I tried belittle it to you and make it seem like it was just one kiss. And I know it was stupid. And I know I was just fooling myself, but I wasn't fooling you. I just want to make this right. I don't want to hurt you like this. God, tell me what I can do to make it right.",
        "Tom: I don't think you can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: But I want to know where Jack went.",
        "Carly: Honey, I told you, he's at work.",
        "Parker: You look different. Something's wrong. I can tell.",
        "Carly: Well, here's what happened. A bad man broke into the house.",
        "Parker: In our house?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. But you know what a good cop Jack is. And he knew right away that this man was bad, so he arrested him. Just like that.",
        "Parker: He went to jail?",
        "Carly: Yeah. 'Cause that's what cops do. They keep us safe.",
        "Parker: Why did the bad man come here? Was it because of molly?",
        "Carly: Enough with these questions. I know what you're trying to do. You want to stay up way past your bedtime. That's all you want to do.",
        "Molly: Parker, why don't you tell me about your book?",
        "Parker: It's about a kid. And he's a superhero.",
        "Molly: Wow. That sounds exciting.",
        "Parker: Dad and Jack are superheroes, only without the flying and stuff.",
        "Molly: And they're the good guys, and they always win, right?",
        "Parker: No, they don't. I believed that when I was little. I don't anymore.",
        "Molly: You don't?",
        "Parker: No. Now I know that cops aren't superheroes. They're just plain old heroes. And that's why sometimes they get hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I don't know. I don't know. I'm thinking maybe Jack took another route to the hospital.",
        "Nikki: So, you're trying to retrace his steps?",
        "Hal: Look, Jack Snyder is one of the best cops ever to come down the pike. That's why I can't understand why he'd put himself a position like this. He's alone a family car with a perp that we're looking at for attempted murder.",
        "Cop: Lieutenant, you have a phone call.",
        "Hal: Munson. Where? When did this happen? I'm on my way. There's been a serious accident on the bridge on Route 17.",
        "Nikki: Jack?",
        "Hal: We don't know yet.",
        "Nikki: Can I help?",
        "Hal: Yes. It's only a matter of time before Carly calls. I want you to field those phone calls. Nobody tells her about this accident on the bridge. Not until we know more.",
        "Nikki: What should I tell her?",
        "Hal: Tell her that I'm doing everything I can to bring my friend home safe. Back to everyone who loves him.",

        "Jessica: Yes, we are.",

        "Jessica: You, too.",
        "Ben: So, was he here on business? Or was he really here asking you questions about Tom and Margo?",
        "Jessica: Well, he may have mentioned --",
        "Ben: I knew it. It's not enough that he ruined their marriage. He's got to come over here and pump you for information.",
        "Jessica: Honey, it's okay, really.",
        "Ben: No, it's not okay. It's because of him that you and your best friend are barely talking. You know, some people need to have their butt kicked on principle.",
        "Jessica: Okay, okay, my handsome warrior prince.",
        "Ben: Let me tell you something. I will go to war to protect my wife and my baby. I will go to war with anyone, anytime, anywhere. And if that means I have to pound some sense into Doc Reese, then so be it.",

        "Tom: He already knows something's up, Margo. Ask him. We'll figure how and what to tell him, tomorrow.",

        "Margo: Believe in us. Just believe in us. We've been through so much more than this, Tom. We have. We've been through babies and lovers and sickness and health -- it wasn't even an affair. It was just a few stupid kisses.",
        "Tom: Well, maybe that's why it feels so final. Like the last gasp. Because we have been here before, and I never thought we'd be back again. I thought we'd learn our lesson and grown into something more loving, more committed, more unbreakable.",
        "Margo: We have. We have, in so many ways. We have.",

What about -- what about Casey? What about everything that we've ever had together? What about -- I love you and you love me. And we can do this. I mean, we've stayed together longer than anybody.

        "Carly: Nikki!",
        "Nikki: Hey, I didn't see you come in.",
        "Carly: You said something about Jack's car? Was that Hal on the phone?",
        "Nikki: They're still searching. I have to follow up on something.",
        "Carly: That's Jack's. That's Jack's license plate number. Will you please tell me what's going on?",
        "Nikki: Carly, I can't.",
        "Carly: Will you please tell me where was Hal calling from? Don't tell me you don't know! Please, Nikki, I heard you say something about a bridge.",
        "Nikki: Carly, I can't give you that information.",
        "Carly: You listen to me, little miss special agent, you have no authority here. You are just a wannabe from the IRS. And if you had brought this monster Starziak in like you were supposed to, if you had done your job, none of this would be happening!",
        "Molly: Carly, this isn't helping. You've got to calm down.",
        "Carly: This is my husband! You will not stop me from going to him. Give the keys.",
        "Molly: That's not a good idea.",
        "Carly: Steve.",
        "Cop: Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Did you hear anything about an accident on a bridge?",
        "Cop: Yeah, out on Route 17.",
        "Carly: Would you mind taking me there?",
        "Cop: Sure, I'm on my way out.",
        "Molly: All right, I'll go with you. You shouldn't be alone.",

        "Casey: Mom? Mom, are you okay? What happened?",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine, honey. I just had a really bad day.",
        "Casey: Bad enough to make you cry?",
        "Margo: I told you that your father and I were having problems.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know. But you guys are going to be okay, right?",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, baby. I just can't talk about this now. This is not your fault, just remember that. This has nothing to do with you. It's not your fault. Please -- and we'll talk about this tomorrow. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't know about you, but we are hungry. I'll see if I can find some chips and chocolate syrup.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ben: Hello.",
        "Casey: It's me, Casey. Something's wrong.",
        "Ben: Is somebody sick?",
        "Casey: No. It's just -- my dad's gone and my mom -- she's been crying. I just don't what to do.",
        "Ben: It's going to be okay.",
        "Casey: My dad, I can't find him. Have you talked to him tonight? Do you know where he is?",
        "Ben: No, I haven't talked to Tom. Have you tried his cell phone?",
        "Casey: Yeah, like a million times or something. It's out of range.",
        "Ben: Don't worry, Casey. Look, I'm gonna talk with Jessica and then I'll get back to you, okay?",
        "Jessica: What's wrong with Casey?",
        "Ben: Tom's gone. And Margo's pretty upset. We should go over there.",
        "Jessica: No! I mean, we shouldn't intrude. Margo probably doesn't want us to interfere.",
        "Ben: Margo is your best friend and her marriage is falling apart.",
        "Jessica: Well, honey, you know how angry she's been. I mean, I'm sure she doesn't want me there.",
        "Ben: Well, maybe she needs you there. Casey needs us. That's why he called. Come on. We're going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know that you love me. All right? And I know that you want what's best for me. So I'm here to tell you that that's Rosanna.",
        "Barbara: And are you sure about that?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Rose died and I feel like a part of me died with her. And for a little while, I was turned into this person that I didn't like very much. Until Rosanna. She knows all of the worst things about me. And she still allows herself to care. All of the sudden, my life makes some kind of sense because she's in it. She makes me happy, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Well, if you're happy, then I'm happy, too.",
        "Paul: Oh, look at you. You've been practicing.",
        "Barbara: But --",
        "Paul: Oh, but. Right. Now is when you warn me about James.",
        "Barbara: Well, there is no avoiding the fact that she is raising James' grandson. That puts her directly in his orbit, which means you're smack dab in the middle of it again.",
        "Paul: I think I've learned a thing or two about how to handle James.",
        "Barbara: Oh, really? And how are you going to handle Rosanna and her marriage?",
        "Paul: No, Rosanna and Jordan are going to be married only as long as they absolutely have to be married, and then Jordan will go off to be with Jennifer, and maybe I get to be with Rosanna and maybe -- just maybe -- I get to live happily ever after.",
        "Barbara: Well, I just hope you're prepared in case things go Stenbeckian.",
        "Paul: Not going to happen. I love her, Mom.",
        "Barbara: And I love you, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. Don't interfere.",
        "Barbara: I've never seen him this happy. And if you love him as much as he loves you, you won't go through with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hi. Thanks for coming over. I'm really worried about my mom.",
        "Margo: Casey, is that -- what are you doing here?",
        "Casey: I called them. Mom, are you okay?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Do you wanna just -- can you go upstairs? I need to talk to these guys, okay? It's okay.",
        "Ben: Casey was looking for Tom. That's why he called us.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, that's my fault because I was supposed to give Casey Tom's number and I forgot.",
        "Jessica: Are you okay?",
        "Margo: How can you even ask me that?",
        "Ben: Margo, we know that you and Tom have been having some trouble. And we're not exactly sure how to help, but we'd like to. Don't shut us out, especially not Jessica.",
        "Margo: Oh, okay. Sure, I'll confide because that's what friends do, right? Friends tell each other everything. Tom left me.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, Margo, I'm so sorry.",
        "Ben: Casey?",
        "Margo: He doesn't know what happened. I don't know what happened, really. He just -- Tom packed a bag, and -- just -- will you excuse me?",
        "Jessica: I don't believe this. This is horrible. How could Tom just walk out on her like this?",
        "Ben: She slept with another man. Tom couldn't just ignore that. Margo had her fling and now the whole family is paying for it.",
        "Margo: Is that what Jessica told you, Ben? That I slept with Doc Reese? Because that's not exactly what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I don't have a choice. If I want to keep Cabot, I have to stay married to Jordan.",
        "Barbara: Poor Paul.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, stop acting so innocent, Barbara. I know.",
        "Barbara: You know what?",
        "Rosanna: I know that you don't want Jordan with Jennifer and you don't want Paul with me.",
        "Barbara: Well, I admit that I have said things like that in the past --",
        "Rosanna: No, you said it to James. And James said it to me, as he was making his plans for my life crystal clear. I stupidly thought that I could fight him. But I realize I can't fight both of you and win. So are you going to help me?",
        "Barbara: I will consider your suggestion.",
        "Rosanna: You'll do it. 'Cause in the end, James always gets what he wants. And it looks like you do, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Look, I couldn't stop Carly, Dad. I'm -- I'm sorry. Another case I just completely fouled up.",
        "Molly: Nikki, I'm sorry Carly said those things to you.",
        "Nikki: No, she's scared. She's right. I mean, if I had nailed Starziak in time, he wouldn't have gone after you, and he wouldn't have shown up at Jack's house.",
        "Molly: Starziak was obsessed with killing me to keep me from testifying. Little did he know, I was so scared, I would've done anything to keep from taking that stand. I wish I had never laid eyes him.",
        "Nikki: Well, as long as we're making empty wishes, I wish Jack had just waited for backup, and not taken Starziak in on his own. Why would he have made such a rookie mistake?",
        "Molly: Because I asked him to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Carly! Carly!",
        "Carly: Is it Jack? Is he all right?",
        "Holden: You shouldn't be here.",

        "Hal: Let's talk over here.",
        "Carly: No! There was an accident, right?",
        "Hal: Carly --",
        "Carly: Well, where's the car, Hal? Where's the -- oh, my God.",
        "Hal: We don't know anything.",
        "Carly: What do you know, Hal? Will you tell me?",
        "Hal: We found Jack's license plate. We have two witnesses who saw a car go over the side with two men in it.",
        "Carly: No. No. Jack!",
