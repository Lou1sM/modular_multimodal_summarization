Craig is shocked, but feels he has saved his son. Paul pours his heart out to Rosanna about how he much loves her and if she leaves him, he will never love anyone as he loves her. He pleads with her to awaken because he doesn't want to ever lose her again \u0096 all of this overheard by a devastated Emily."

        "Lily: That certainly is bleak. Mother?",
        "Lucinda: My God, oh! It's the voice of God! Now, I agree with you. I think this quote is, you know, sorta bleak and kind of grim. But pardon me, ma'am , you wrote it!",
        "Lily: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what a lovely voice you have. I was always sure that God was feminine. It's nice to know I'm right.",
        "Lily: Mother?",
        "Lucinda: What? [Lucinda sighs] Dear, I'm avoiding you and ignoring you for a reason.",
        "Lily: Being what?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I had hoped that perhaps I could have a few moments of solitary rumination.",
        "Lily: Sorry. I can't leave until I ask you -- this question is going to bug me all night long.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, go ahead. Ask me whatever -- what's the burning question?",
        "Lily: What in the name of everything that is holy is Lucinda Walsh doing in a church?",

        "Luke: Who do you think you are? Get your hands off me. I don't have to answer to you.",
        "Keith: Well, you're lucky it's me instead of a cop.",
        "Kevin: Whoa. Who's talking about calling the cops?",
        "Luke: Nothing. Nothing. Don't listen to him. He would never get me arrested.",
        "Keith: Where'd you get this booze? Did you steal it?",
        "Kevin: No.",
        "Kevin: Somebody buy it for you? Who? What is your name?",

        "Keith: Kevin, huh? Kevin what?",
        "Luke: Leave him alone.",
        "Keith: No, I want some answers here. How'd you get here, Kevin? Did you drive? Do you have a car?",
        "Luke: Don't let him freak you out, Kev. He can't do anything. He means nothing to me or my family. He's a nobody.",
        "Keith: Nobody, huh? Well, you know what? I've got his home phone right here on speed dial. If I dial it, you two would be grounded for life. Now, are you going to stop joking around and answer some of my questions? Or do you want me to make your life miserable?",

        "Paul: So what do you think?",
        "Ben: We ran some tests. We're going to monitor her for a while.",

        "Ben: There's no reason to believe she won't be.",
        "Paul: I'd like to talk to her.",
        "Ben: Why don't we let the nurses get settled in first, and besides, there's a few things I want to talk to you about, since you were there, the critical moments right after she was injured.",
        "Paul: Okay. What do you want to know?",
        "Ben: Well, you told the paramedics that she was talking right after the accident.",
        "Paul: She was. She said something about the wrong foot.",

        "Paul: How long before I can see her?",
        "Ben: Well, it's going to be a while. Look, if you want to come walk with me while I go check on the tests, you're welcome. Might be easier than, you know, sitting around waiting.",
        "Paul: Please. Let me go in there. Talk to her, check on her? And then I'll leave her alone and let her rest, I promise.",
        "Ben: Keep it short.",

Have you spoken to anybody about what happened? Do you remember? I know it was scary, okay? And your memory probably is playing to tricks on you. All you have to remember is how much I love you. [Rosanna whimpers] Hey, hey. You'll be fine. Everything will be fine. Shh. Just don't say anything. Everything will be fine. Rosanna -- is it the baby? Do you remember about the baby?

        "Lily: Mother, you were talking to yourself.",
        "Lucinda: No, darling, I wasn't. I was reading this. I guess there was a service here today for that poor little baby that died.",
        "Lily: It's so sad.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know why people don't clean things. You know, it's amazing. You come into the house of the lord for peace and quiet and there's funereal litter everywhere. It's not to be borne.",
        "Lily: Okay, this, mother, this information is about going back to dust. This is not good for you to be reading. You need to go home.",

        "Lily: Of course everything is going to be fine!",
        "Lucinda: Oh, then why don't you act like it? Stop killing me with your kindness. You just live your life the way you usually do. And I'll live my life the way I usually do. I mean, when you coddle me -- me, me. You do that to me, I feel -- I am not dying, dammit!",
        "Lily: I know that.",
        "Lucinda: Of course, all right. Because I'm going to fight it, the cancer's going to be conquered. Everything's going to be just fine.",

        "Lucinda: It's only a -- it's just a twinge. It's only a twinge. No, I don't have it.",
        "Lily: You have to take the pain medication. The doctor said you have to stay ahead of the pain.",
        "Lucinda: I don't like the pain medication because it does something to me up here and I want to think straight.",
        "Lily: Shh, it explains everything, trust me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, my darling. What I said to you and Holden earlier, every single sober word I meant.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Can we go now?",
        "Keith: Yeah, neither one of you are driving. Give me the keys to your car. Where's your car? I'll drive you.",

        "Keith: Yeah, good idea, dummy. What about you? How are you getting home?",
        "Luke: Look, if I want to stay out late, I can. If I want to go get drunk, I can do that too.",
        "Keith: Yeah. Yeah, you can.",
        "Luke: What's it to you, huh?",
        "Keith: You know, I'd love to say that it was nothing to me. In fact, I'd love to say that didn't run into you birdbrains getting drunk out here so that when you wrap your car around a tree and your mother tells me about it and says you were drunk, I can say, \"really, I didn't know.\"",
        "Luke: What? So you're going to tell her everything now? Act like your some big shot, like you're my father or something?",
        "Keith: I'm not trying to be your father.",
        "Luke: Yes, you are! You have this thing with my mom. You think I don't know what going on? You're trying to be all buddy-buddy with me and my sister. Giving us fatherly advice.",
        "Keith: Gee, I never thought about that.",
        "Luke: We have a father. Okay, and one day, a lot sooner than you think, they're going to get back together. So stop trying to get on my good side because I don't -- I don't need you!",
        "Keith: Try not to get hit by a car when you stumble on home.",
        "Luke: You know what? Just give up. My mom is never going to love you like she loves my father. So just leave us alone.",
        "Keith: You know what? Turning yourself into a drunk, that's not going to do any good. It's not going to hurt me. It's not -- it's not going get rid of me.",
        "Luke: Then what will?",
        "Keith: Look, you got a problem with me. All right. Don't hurt your family. It's me. Take a shot at me.",

        "Luke: I feel fine.",
        "Keith: Good. How's your knuckles?",
        "Luke: They're okay.",
        "Keith: You're half my age, you knocked me off my feet. You must have bruised your knuckles. Now, come on, there's no reason to gloat about it.",
        "Luke: I guess it hurts a little bit.",
        "Keith: Let me take a look at it.",

        "Will: Yeah.",

        "Will: Yeah.",

        "Craig: Yes, yes. And she speed up. She was driving erratically. Okay? So I tried to pull up aside her to try and get her slow her down. And our cars collided and she lost control of her car, I lost control of mine. I don't know, Hal. My wife is convulsing in a hospital bed, all right? I may not be thinking very clearly now.",

        "Keith: You're right. I'm kind of getting a headache now from walking into a door, so I'm gonna go back home, take some aspirin and go to bed.",
        "Lily: How'd you manage to walk into a door?",
        "Keith: Well, believe it or not, I was thinking about you.",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't believe you, but it's a wonderful lie.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you could have really hurt yourself. You could have hurt yourself. You're just so clumsy, Keith.",
        "Keith: Well, sometimes I can be all thumbs.",
        "Lucinda: Not while piloting a plane, I hope.",
        "Keith: No, no, no, no. Not then, not then. Well, I'll see you when I get back from my trip.",
        "Lily: All right, be careful.",
        "Keith: Okay.",
        "Lucinda: I hate to rush you two, but it's getting really humid out here, don't you think?",
        "Keith: I'll call you later. Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Yes?",
        "Keith: Listen, you know, I know things have been really tough on you with the surgery and everything. And I'm glad that you're doing well. I mean that.",
        "Lucinda: As if I'd ever doubt anything that you have to say.",

        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey. What are you doing back here? Aren't you permanently banned from this place after you and Casey went at each other?",
        "Will: Yeah, right. No. Luckily, the manager charged me enough on my credit card to pay for all the damages and add a second story.",
        "Gwen: Money talks.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess. Have you seen Celia? I'm supposed to meet her here.",
        "Gwen: First official date?",
        "Will: No. Yeah. Maybe. Sort of. So, how are you doing?",
        "Gwen: I thought people were gonna stop asking me that question once I wasn't pregnant anymore.",
        "Will: Well, that's people. And this is me. You know, when you said you were okay with giving the baby up for adoption, were you telling the truth, or do you miss him now?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I do. I mean, for a lot of months, it was me plus one everywhere I went. Now it's just me. I don't even know -- I don't even know how to do that anymore.",
        "Will: Yeah, I went by my brother's to tell him about the baby not being mine and everything --",
        "Gwen: I bet he was relieved, huh?",
        "Will: He wasn't there. But you know, it kind of made me sad to think that I wasn't gonna be in the kid's life anymore, you know. And I wasn't connected to him 24/7, so for you, it must have been much harder.",
        "Gwen: You're the only person in the whole world who knows how I feel right now. To think, I used to despise you.",
        "Will: Yeah. Same goes for me. So, did you talk to Casey?",
        "Gwen: No. I yelled at him, though. Told him he was blind, selfish, a real jerk. A bunch of other stuff.",
        "Will: Did he yell back?",
        "Gwen: His heart wasn't in it. And you know what? For a second, I actually felt sorry for the guy.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: You know, I'm used to having a life where stuff doesn't usually work out too good. But this is a whole new experience for him. He's so used to getting what he wants that he never even considered, not even for a minute, that he might actually lose Celia -- that anything bad would actually happen to him. So he thought he could just sleep with me and then go on like nothing ever happened.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Hey. One good thing came out of it, though. You got the girl.",
        "Will: Yeah, I did. And your baby got a good home.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Two good things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The coma could be permanent. \"Could be.\" That's what you said -- \"could be.\" There's a chance, right? That she could come out of this?",
        "Ben: It's a small chance. I don't pull punches with you, Paul. It's unlikely.",
        "Paul: Craig did this. Craig caused this.",
        "Ben: What, the accident?",
        "Paul: No -- yes -- no, the seizure. She was fine. She was stable. You said so yourself. And then Craig went in there --",
        "Ben: Wait, wait, wait. No one can say for certain why she had a seizure.",
        "Paul: I can. You gotta fix this. You gotta change this. Isn't there anything I can do?",
        "Ben: Well, you can talk to her.",
        "Paul: What good would that do?",
        "Ben: Medically, there's not much we can do to bring Rosanna out of this. But, her will. She can hear you. You take her hand and you say whatever words you have to say to get her to fight her way back. And if you see any signs of consciousness, you have the nurses call me right away.",
        "Paul: Okay. Where are you going? Shouldn't you be with her?",
        "Ben: I will be in my office, I'm gonna be making some calls, doing some research. Trying to find a way to bring her back.",
        "Paul: Okay, you'll find something.",
        "Ben: Pray I will. I don't wanna give you false hope.",
        "Paul: Okay. But do me a favor?",
        "Ben: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You'll call Hal. And you tell him what happened. You make sure that he understands exactly what Craig has done to her. Okay, look, I know you're probably really exhausted after everything that happened. Maybe you're afraid to open your eyes because you might see Craig here. But Craig is gone. And he's going to stay gone. I promise you that. And I'm here. And I'm gonna make sure that you're safe. Can you hear me? If you can hear me, squeeze my hand. Please, Rosanna, squeeze my hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Isn't Celia a little late for your first date?",
        "Will: About ten minutes. And it's not a date. It's more like she's doing nothing, I'm doing nothing, might as well do nothing together. So, what are you doing tonight?",
        "Gwen: This is it. I'll probably go over to Al's later, talk to the night manager, see if he can put me back on shift again.",
        "Will: Are you sure you're strong enough to go back to work?",
        "Gwen: I'd better be. I need the money.",
        "Will: I thought the people who adopted the baby were gonna help you with that.",
        "Gwen: They did. I had to pay back most of that for rent.",
        "Will: Are you sure you're okay about the baby and everything?",
        "Gwen: Sure. Why do you keep asking me that?",
        "Will: Because every time I mention it, you get this really sad, depressed look on your face.",
        "Gwen: Then stop asking me. Seriously, I'm okay. Besides, every time I get sad I'll think of him on Christmas morning opening up like a gazillion toys.",
        "Celia: Hi. Am I late?",
        "Will: No. Not at all. Hey.",
        "Celia: Hey, Gwen.",
        "Will: So, are you ready to go?",
        "Celia: Yeah. Gwen, do you want to come? Will and I were just going to hang out for a while.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'd love to. But I'm sorry, I've got plans. Thanks, anyway.",

        "Emily: Mom, where's Paul?",
        "Susan: Hey, Emily. Inside. With Rosanna. Maybe it's not a good idea for you to be here.",
        "Emily: How is she?",
        "Susan: I don't know. I haven't seen a chart, I haven't spoken to Ben. But the fact that she's in, I see you, is not good.",
        "Emily: Okay. I'm gonna let him know I'm here.",
        "Susan: Maybe you should hold off on that. Just until we have more information. Come on, you can wait in my office. I'll track down Ben. That way, you'll know more about what you're dealing with.",
        "Emily: I don't need to wait in your office. I know that she's critical. That she could die.",
        "Susan: Or she could recover. You never know.",

        "Craig: You saw how devious Paul Ryan is, Hal. He stole your wife.",
        "Hal: So did you. Different wife, same principle.",
        "Craig: He must have bribed somebody, Hal. Come on. Rosanna and I love each other. You know that. We just got remarried. We just adopted a baby. What possible reason could I ever have for hurting her? You know, Paul Ryan has been waiting to get back at her.",
        "Hal: Paul didn't have time to bribe anybody. According to the cops at the scene, he never left Rosanna's side.",
        "Craig: Yeah, and what was he saying, right? And maybe that couple at the hospital who just happened to see the back of my head from a moving car and assumed I was a maniac? Hmm?",
        "Hal: And the forensics evidence? Am I supposed to ignore that, too? You were driving right alongside Rosanna's car at a high rate of speed. What am I supposed to conclude from that?",
        "Craig: That I was concerned she was in trouble.",
        "Hal: Or that you were trying to stop her before she got to wherever she was going.",
        "Craig: I want my lawyer.",

        "Hal: Munson. Yeah. Yes, that does make a difference. Thanks, Ben.",

        "Paul: What you said before about us getting off on the wrong foot? I know that we've hurt each other. We made some mistakes. But seeing you like this, Rosanna -- everything we had, everything we shared, was never broken. Not ever. And you can't let Craig break us now by leaving me. [Emily is standing in the doorway.]You can't leave me, Rosanna. Please. I love you. If you leave -- if you leave me, I'll never love anyone the way I love you.",
