        "Carly: You don't understand, mr. Frasier here, he owns the building.",
        "Cop #5: Just get your hands up, ma'am, and keep them where i can see them.",
        "Carly: We're not trespassing! You see, we just came to take a look at the building because I've been hired to decorate it.",
        "Cop #5: That's not how I understand it, ma'am. And quite frankly, if you own the building, then why are you breaking in?",
        "Carly: Well -- we didn't break in, really. Mr. Frasier just forgot his key at his hotel.",
        "Simon: The hotel.",
        "Cop #5: Look, all I know is the station received a call from the owner -- not mr. Frasier -- reporting trespassers on his property.",
        "Carly: That's not possible. Simon, you should tell him that it's really not possible.",
        "Simon: Well, technically it is possible.",
        "Carly: Either own the building or you don'T.",
        "Simon: Yeah -- I won the building as soon as I give the guy the money. See, we're closing in the morning. What do you think about a --",
        "Carly: Simon! Do you own the building? Yes or no?",
        "Simon: No.",
        "Cop #5: Okay, well, then I'm afraid you are both under arrest for breaking and entering and criminal trespass.",
        "Gwen: Sorry, you looked so caught up I didn't want to startle you. What's going on?",
        "Jade: I saw maddie here a little earlier. I could swear I saw her toss something in the water.",
        "Gwen: Did you ask her about it?",
        "Jade: She wasn't in the mood to chat, if you know what I mean.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's been a little tense lately.",
        "Jade: Yeah, whatever it was, she didn't want anyone to know she tossed it.",
        "Gwen: Well, what do you think it was?",
        "Jade: No clue. But I can't really see anything, do you?",
        "Gwen: No, rocks. Maybe she was tossing pebbles or a stick.",
        "Jade: Yeah, maybe. Anyway I'm not about to get wet looking for it, but -- so, what's up?",
        "Gwen: I was supposed to meet will back at carly's and he never showed.",
        "Jade: You call him?",
        "Gwen: I left him a couple messages, he hasn't gotten back to me.",
        "Jade: You guys okay?",
        "Gwen: I thought so. We had this stupid fight earlier -- I thought we'd cleared things up. Then again, with will, you never know. He keeps everything inside.",
        "Jade: So what were you guys fighting about?",
        "Gwen: You.",
        "Lucinda: What's happening? Is there another problem with the baby?",
        "Holden: Lily's stable but the baby is in trouble.",
        "Lucinda: Trouble, what does that --",
        "Holden: Bob's in there right now.",
        "Lucinda: Bob, the baby is in trouble?",
        "Bob: Unfortunately the baby's moved back into a breech position and showing signs of distress.",
        "Lucinda: Well, why don't you just turn it around the way you did before?",
        "Bob: There's no time to do that. The baby's old enough to survive outside the womb. It calls for a c-section.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you said that that was dangerous because of the coma.",
        "Bob: There is significant risk for lily.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, bob, significant risk? Does that mean what I think it means, that she could --",
        "Bob: Yes. She could die.",
        "Damian: Coast is clear.",
        "Luke: You mean, grandmother's gone?",
        "Damian: Your grandmother is a formidable woman.",
        "Luke: Her bark is worse than her -- actually, her bite's pretty bad.",
        "Damian: But she loves you fiercely and that's all that counts. Listen, I forgot something I wanted to show you in the car. Why don't you get us a table? I'll be right back.",
        "Kevin: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Kevin: What the hell was that? You left us stranded in the middle of nowhere. I had to call my father who wasn't too choked up about it.",
        "Luke: Look, I know and I'm sorry. I just had to get out of there. And you made it pretty clear you didn't want to be interrupted.",
        "Kevin: And why's that?",
        "Luke: You and liv --",
        "Kevin: Me and liv were just trying to find some time to be together. But no, let's not respect that. Or the fact that ada was practically begging you to make a move. No, let's just drive away.",
        "Luke: Okay, kevin, I'm sorry.",
        "Kevin: You're pathetic.",
        "Emily: All right, winner gets to pick. Where do you want to sit?",
        "Daniel: Face it, mom, bowling's not your game.",
        "Emily: Hey, listen up, daniel, I'm bowling for two, okay? Give me a break.",
        "Susan: I don't think we should blame those gutterballs on the baby, do you, daniel?",
        "Daniel: Mom, you've always been a lousy bowler.",
        "Emily: But have you ever met a better sport?",
        "Susan: Now, that's true. She's always been a good sport. But she's had to be.",
        "Emily: You know, you --",
        "Susan: I know, I'm very bad.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Susan: But it's so good to have you home.",
        "Emily: Oh, thanks, Susan: Gutterballs and all.",
        "Daniel: Me, too.",
        "Emily: You, too, what?",
        "Daniel: I'm so glad you're home. And you're really home? You don't have to go back to the hospital? Or jail?",
        "Emily: I'm really home. It's over, daniel. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Meg: C'mon, buttercup. I know you're hungry. So, drink up. Come on. Look, your mom's sick, okay, and she can't nurse you. So it's me or nothing, all right?",
        "Paul: Meg? I think we should talk.",
        "Meg: I really don't think there's point.",
        "Paul: You're not even willing to hear me out?",
        "Meg: Not unless you've found a way to let go of this obsession you have with emily.",
        "Paul: I'm willing to do anything -- anything for you.",
        "Meg: I know you want everything to work out, okay? So do I. But that's not gonna make it happen. And neither is you swearing that you'll change, because we've been there, done that a few too many times already. And my hands are full, so --",
        "Paul: Hey, can I try?",
        "Meg: You want to give a bottle to a lamb.",
        "Paul: Yeah, why not?",
        "Meg: Okay. Buttercup, this is paul.",
        "Paul: Buttercup? Isn't that a cow name?",
        "Meg: Do you really want to argue with mama? Here you go.",
        "Paul: No. Got it. Hi, buttercup. I bet meg's got all kinds of goodies in here, if I know her.",
        "Meg: Is that some kind of crack about my cooking?",
        "Paul: No, no, not at all. Look, I know she looks good -- who are we kidding, she looks great but, but she scorches the chili. She scorches water if you want to know the truth. Which is really hard to do. You know that, if you know anything about water.",
        "Meg: She's drinking. You charmed her into it.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. How about you?",
        "Meg: It's not about that.",
        "Paul: No, it is. It's all about that. Meg, I think it's really important that we find each other irresistible.",
        "Meg: Paul, you made it very clear. You want full custody of your child, then you're willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen including destroying emily. And I won't be a part of that.",
        "Paul: Look, I was shocked. I was really upset. When I found out emily was free and clear, I said some things. And obviously, I want full custody of my child. But you're right. That's not gonna happen, at least not now. So I've calmed down and I've accepted it an the situation, I'm willing to negotiate.",
        "Meg: For what?",
        "Paul: For shared custody. Because that's what's best. Not just for the kid but for you and me. I don't want to battle emily for the rest of my life. So we'll all sit down together. We'll hammer something out. And we'll reach some kind of agreement. That is if you're still willing.",
        "Meg: The thing is -- that sounds great. And you obviously know the right thing to say. Maybe you even believe it. But I don't buy it. So no. I'm not willing. I'm sorry.",
        "Jade: You and will were fighting about me?",
        "Gwen: It was dumb and my fault. Maddie had said something and -- it's not important. The point is, I shouldn't have let it get to me.",
        "Jade: Was this at crash? Because I saw you two chatting and I wasn't -- I wasn't trying to listen. I was getting my schedule. But I heard you tell her something about how she was imagining things.",
        "Gwen: She'd seen you guys hugging and -- I told you it was dumb. But I don't like to keep things from will, so I told him what she said and we talked it out. And I thought things were cool, but then he disappeared. I thought, you know, maybe he came out here.",
        "Jade: I haven't seen him. And there's nothing going on between me and will. I mean, you have to know that he loves you. We're just friends.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, no, I get that. I think it's just that, you know, we're still raw. The whole graduation thing and then losing his sister. I mean, not that there hasn't been good news, too. The whole trust fund thing, that was great --",
        "Jade: If this is about money, I would rather stay at a bus stop than cause a problem.",
        "Gwen: No, it's fine. Honestly, I'm glad that we can help you. You need a decent place to live and I'm sorry that I brought it up.",
        "Jade: No, I'm glad that you did. I want to be able to talk. I don't want things to be weird. So are we okay?",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey. I was worried. Where've you been?",
        "Will: I'm sorry. I needed to do something.",
        "Gwen: Because I left you, like, a million messages.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. I just wanted to tell you in person. It's kind of a surprise.",
        "Jade: Should I go?",
        "Gwen: No, I don't think so. Is it a good surprise or is it a bad surprise?",
        "Will: Yeah, no,, it's a good surprise. It's a very good surprise. I hope. I found us a home.",
        "Gwen: You found us a place to live?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Oh my god.",
        "Will: Anyway, I need to show it to you.",
        "Gwen: You're so great.",
        "Will: Yeah, your sister's place is cool. I just wanted to find us something of our own.",
        "Gwen: Our own place, just you and me?",
        "Will: Yeah, that's the idea. And you've got to come see it tonight, because if you like it, then we can move in tomorrow.",
        "Gwen: What about jade? Can she come?",
        "Kevin: You know, I just don't get you. You were after me all this time to hang out, and now when you finally do, you mess it up or your father gets in the way and things get ugly.",
        "Luke: Hey, my father had nothing to do with this.",
        "Kevin: No, you're right. It was all you. I should've never -- I should have never listened to you.",
        "Luke: Kevin, don't say that.",
        "Kevin: You want a second chance? For what? To wreck my life? Lose my number, freak.",
        "Damian: Hey@ you all right?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Luke: I will be as soon as we get out of this town. So were you serious about taking me to malta?",
        "Damian: That's why I went back to the car. I brought you these. That school is just a few miles from my estate. It has a marvelous reputation. And this is a program they've started at the local airport -- flying lessons. I have my own plane. I know you're interested in learning how to fly.",
        "Luke: I'm there. Let's go to europe. The sooner the better.",
        "Damian: When will you discuss this with holden?",
        "Luke: There won't be much to discuss. He'll hate the idea. \"I'm running away from my problems, I shouldn't trust you, remember what happened last time?\" Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Damian: Luke, you must know that I would never take you to malta if I thought it unsafe.",
        "Luke: My dad doesn't care. He won't listen to what you have to say.",
        "Damian: But I want you to know, I would never put you at risk.",
        "Luke: I do know that.",
        "Damian: You do?",
        "Luke: Yeah, of course. Damian, you've been amazing.",
        "Damian: You have no idea how much that means to me. I've wanted us to be friends, to trust each other, for so long and -- you know, perhaps I should wait to book the trip until you settle things with holden.",
        "Luke: No, no. Book it. My dad will just have to deal. [ Phone rings ] Sorry. Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, thank god you answered the phone.",
        "Luke: Look, I can't talk right now.",
        "Lucinda: It's an emergency, dear. Get right over to the hospital.",
        "Luke: What happened?",
        "Lucinda: It's your mother, darling. She's going into surgery. Now get here quick! Your father needs you.",
        "Bob: Her pressure's elevated. The only solution is a caesarean.",
        "Holden: Can't we wait? Can't we just try to get her blood pressure down?",
        "Bob: No.",
        "Holden: I know what lily would say. She'd say that she'd want to save the baby.",
        "Bob: What do you say?",
        "Holden: You're asking me to choose between my wife and my child.",
        "Bob: Yes I am.",
        "Holden: Do the surgery.",
        "Bob: Why don't you stay with her and I'll get an O.R. Ready.",
        "Holden: I did what you would've wanted. You know why? Because you're gonna get through this. And when you do, I don't want you yelling at me about not doing what was right for the baby. Just hang in there, okay? You come back to me.",
        "Luke: What's going on? How's my mother?",
        "Bob: Well, the baby's in danger and your dad has given us permission for us to do a c-section.",
        "Luke: But what about mom? Isn't that dangerous?",
        "Bob: Yes, but we have an excellent team and we'll do everything we can to save both of them.",
        "Lucy: Dr. Hughes, may I scrub in and observe? I'd like to be there for lily.",
        "Bob: All right. Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: You save them both, bob. You're a good kid. I'm real proud of you. I'm real proud of you. Oh it's strange. Suddenly I feel kind of lightheaded.",
        "Luke: Grandma -- grandma, why don't we sit down right here.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Thank you, dear.",
        "Luke: And I'll get you some water, okay? I'll be right back.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, thank you so much. Thanks, darling.",
        "[ Lucinda sighs ]",
        "Damian: Should I call you a nurse?",
        "Lucinda: I want you to leave right now.",
        "Damian: Lucinda, I know I'm not your favorite these days -- but I care about lily, she's the mother of my son. And I'm here to support luke -- he needs me.",
        "Lucinda: Luke needs you to make yourself scarce.",
        "Will: It's got electricity, i just thought --",
        "Gwen: It's -- it's beautiful. I can't believe that you did all of this.",
        "Will: Well we needed a place to live.",
        "Jade: I love the flowers along the path.",
        "Will: Yeah, my sister planted those when she lived here.",
        "Gwen: Perfect. They'll come back every year and remind us of jen.",
        "Will: We'll have to tell johnny when he gets older that his mom planted them.",
        "Jade: I'm going to go check out the back room.",
        "Gwen: I bet you can see the lake from here when the leaves are down.",
        "Will: You can. Gwen, can I ask you something. Why did you invite jade along?",
        "Gwen: I know that you wanted to do this alone. But jade and I had just had a talk about me being jealous about what maddie said -- and I didn't want her to think that there were any hard feelings.",
        "Will: So you're okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm good.",
        "Will: Good. And I promise, from now on -- no more giving away money without talking to you first.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm glad we're helping jade. Especially now that we have all this.",
        "Will: Lucinda said we could come stay for one or two days, you know, before we decide.",
        "Gwen: Sign the lease -- I love it. I mean I can see us coming home from school and studying in front of the fireplace and waking up in the morning and walking out into the garden and having coffee under that tree.",
        "Will: I've always loved it here. And I love you.",
        "Carly: Is this really necessary? Can't I just have my lawyer call the station?",
        "Cop #5: You can call your attorney as soon as you've been processed.",
        "Simon: What are you doing?",
        "Carly: I don't want jack to see me.",
        "Simon: Why? You look amazing.",
        "Carly: I really don't think he'd agree with you at this moment!",
        "Simon: Well then the guy is literally out of his mind.",
        "Carly: We've been arrested!",
        "Simon: Oh it's a technicality.",
        "Carly: Oh, a technicality, is it? Like who actually owns that building?",
        "Simon: It's no big deal.",
        "Carly: You lied to me!",
        "Simon: No, I never lied to you -- I never said I owned the building, I just said I got a new job for you remodeling a new property.",
        "Carly: You think this is funny don't you? You know, I knew it. I knew hat I never should have gotten involved with you.",
        "Simon: Oh come on -- wasn't it just a little bit of fun?",
        "Carly: Well, until the cops showed up.",
        "Simon: A call to my lawyer and we're gonna back on the streets in action in no time.",
        "Carly: Says you. Well, I've heard enough. Jack.",
        "Jack: You've been arrested? Breaking and entering? And criminal trespass? Carly, you have a record -- you violated your probation. Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you're in?",
        "Meg: Look at her, she's so happy.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I have that effect on -- well, everybody but you, apparently.",
        "Meg: Don't say that. You know you make me very happy -- except when you try and make everbody elses life miserable.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but that's all going to change. Come on, you've got to cut me some slack. When I found out the charges had been dropped against emily -- anybody would've reacted.",
        "Meg: But you nurse a grudge, paul. You do whatever it takes to get what you want.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but that's a losing battle, okay. And I've had some time and I've had to face the fact that with emily free and clear -- there's no judge in the world that's ever gonna give me sole custody. So, okay. Plan B. Which is a life with you and as much time with this child as joint custody will afford. That is if -- if that's what you still want -- if you still love me.",
        "Meg: It's not about loving you, of course I love you.",
        "Paul: Then marry me.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Look, I know -- I know that I don't deserve you, okay. I know that I've made a lot of mistakes and I know that I've let you down and that I have a lot of flaws. But no one will ever love you the way I love you. No one will ever understand you the way I understand you. And we do that for each other. Please, meg -- make a life with me. Marry me.",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"as the world turns\" --",
        "Paul: I have no future without you -- I love you.",
        "Holden: Just stay with us. This baby's gonna need you.",
        "Jack: I told katie and mike not to worry that simon frasier would never sucker you. You're to smart for that. But I guess I was wrong -- again.",
        "Meg: Get up.",
        "Paul: That's not fair. What are you feeling?",
        "Meg: What I'm feeling? Ambushed. That's how I'm feeling -- ambushed.",
        "Paul: That's not exactly what I was going for. So you're not saying \"no,\" though. Look, I know this is really strange timing, but it's a really nice ring.",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: Look, meg, when you left, I fell apart. You walked out on me and I didn't care about anything. Not my kid, not my future. I didn't have a future. I have no future without you. I love you. I want -- I don't want, I need to wake up next to you. And I want to argue with you about who's going to cook breakfast. Because to be honest with you, meg, I've had my last piece of burnt toast and when you come back to bed and we make love until dinner -- which is another meal that I will have to cook. And then if you're feeling like you are right now and you don't want to talk, we'll go out to the terrace and we can just hold hands. We can watch the billboards light up on the highway. We can watch the moon come out, I don't care.",
        "Meg: And on the days when emily has hauled you into court because you picked the wrong preschool for junior --",
        "Paul: Then, I will have to be honest with you, you might have to cook. I can't promise you that everything's going to be perfect and that emily's not going to stir things up. And I can't promise you that I won't overreact and I won't be emotional or -- but I promise you that I will go about everything in a legal way. And I will do that not just for you or for me but because that's what's best for my kid.",
        "Meg: That sounds great. And I wish I could find a way to trust it. But emily's been out a day or two and the baby won't be born for weeks. Who knows how this is going to play out.",
        "Paul: It'll play out the way we want it to. Not necessarily the way I want it to and not necessarily the way emily wants it to, but the way that's fair. The way we both need it to turn out.",

        "Paul: Why can't we just do that together?",
        "Meg: Because I don't think you're able to do what you say. You're going to get frustrated and angry and impatient and do something reckless or maybe even underhanded and I don't want to be a part of that. And until you can prove me wrong, I'm sorry, I can't marry you.",
        "Holden: Our child is about to be born. They're going to do a c-section. Bob says that he's got a great team of doctors that are going to look after you and the baby. That you're going to be fine. Just stay with us. Because this baby's going to need you. Just like faith and natalie and luke and your mother. And most of all, me.",

        "Carly: You had no right to assume that any of this is my fault.",

        "Carly: I'm working, that's the important point.",
        "Jack: Oh, I see. So you can turn me down and wash dishes at the lakeview and work for simon frasier. What's next? You going to get your old job back at the galaxy? But that's okay. That's okay. You're doing this on your own and that's what counts. Not your kids or your self-respect or your peace of mind.",
        "Carly: What I do is none of your business.",
        "Jack: We have kids together, carly. That is my business. Or have you forgotten? Maybe the champagne went to your head or the rush of breaking and entering. You violated your probation. Do you know that a judge is going to do when he hears about this?",
        "Carly: It's not going to come to that.",
        "Jack: Why? Because simon says? And you believe him? I told katie and mike not to worry, that simon frasier would never sucker you, you're too smart. But I guess I was wrong -- again.",
        "Carly: You know what, jack? I'm going to tell you this one last time. What I do is none of your business. We are through. If I make a mistake, it's my mistake. And I don't need you following me around and protecting me. I can take care of myself. I paid that tab at the lakeview myself and I can get out of these charges myself!",

        "Simon: Oh, jack didn't do a thing. See, I called the owner up and had the charges dropped for me 25 grand above the asking price. See, carly, I think you're going to be worth it. Oh, jack -- will you do the honors? Thank you. Whoa. Well, that was fun. What next? I got it. You know what? Let's go and I'll teach you how to hotwire a car.",
