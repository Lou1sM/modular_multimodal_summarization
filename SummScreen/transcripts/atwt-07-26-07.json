        "Will: Hey, Gwen, are you feeling better?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm better. Thank you. A cold shower was just what I needed.",
        "Will: Check it out. You and the baby are going to be the healthiest mommy and baby in the world. I got turkey bacon for iron, eggs for protein, yogurt for calcium and strawberries for vitamin C.",

        "Alison: Order the breakfast special and then leave.",
        "Dusty: Service here isn't what it used to be.",
        "Alison: Better than Yo's, where anybody can tell a bartender to cut a girl off.",
        "Dusty: You were drunk.",
        "Alison: Not your business.",
        "Dusty: You made it my business when you were all over me.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'm going to find another waitress for you.",
        "Dusty: Hey, come on. So what did you do afterward? Went home, stayed put, I hope.",
        "Alison: I scored some meth, fought with my mom, and I then moved out.",
        "Dusty: You got high?",
        "Alison: No, I didn't get high, but I fought with my mom anyway.",
        "Dusty: Because she caught you with the meth?",
        "Alison: I wasn't going to use.",
        "Dusty: Let me guess, she didn't believe you?",
        "Alison: She never believes me.",
        "Dusty: She caught you with crystal meth. What is she supposed to think?",
        "Alison: And what about you, Dusty? You think I'm using again? Is that why you're here, checking up on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Excuse me. Hi. Take a look at that. It's my little cousin. He's been missing for a while. Thank you.",
        "Susan: Aaron, I read about J.J. in the paper. I'm so sorry. I can only imagine what you and Jack and the rest of the family are going through.",
        "Aaron: Well, it's been tough. But we're all pitching in wherever we can. Besides that, all we can do is keep the faith, right?",
        "Susan: Oh, I'll say a prayer.",
        "Aaron: Okay, thank you very much, Susan. Excuse me. This is my little cousin missing. If you can take a look at that. Thank you.",
        "Susan: I hate to bring this up when you're in the middle of a crisis, but I was wondering if you could help me out.",
        "Aaron: I can try.",
        "Susan: Alison and I had a big argument last night, and she packed up, she moved out. And she won't answer my calls, and I'm worried sick about her.",
        "Aaron: I don't know that she'd answer any of my calls either, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Susan: But if she goes into work, you could stop by there and check on her. Just to make sure she's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, if you've seen or heard anything at all --",
        "Brad: Please call our hotline. Even the smallest detail could be a clue to lead to J.J.'s recovery.",
        "Katie: The number's at the bottom of your screen.",
        "Brad: \"Oakdale Now\" is offering a cash reward for anybody with information that leads to J.J.'s recovery and the arrest of the person or persons responsible for his disappearance. Thank you.",
        "Director: And we're out. Good job.",
        "Katie: I hope it helps.",
        "Cameraperson: I'm sorry about your nephew.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I didn't realize that this had gotten to you.",
        "Brad: My nephew's missing, and you don't think that's going to get to me?",
        "Katie: Wait, Brad, I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Jack: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Katie: Any news about J.J.?",
        "Jack: We -- we got a ransom note. They want $100,000 in exchange for J.J.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God! Jack, are you going to pay it?",
        "Jack: No, and I pray to God that I'm doing the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: What were you planning on doing with this little piece of equipment? Answer me, boy!",
        "J.J.: Look behind you!",
        "Silas: Damn!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I need it to get J.J. back. The people who took him, they sent a ransom note.",
        "Lily: How much do they want?",
        "Carly: $100,000 by noon today.",
        "Lily: Carly, I would give you anything that you need, but why can't you tell Jack that you asked me for the money?",
        "Carly: Jack is refusing to pay them.",
        "Lily: Why? I don't understand. He loves J.J. if he's refusing to pay, there must be a reason.",
        "Carly: He says that if we pay the kidnappers, then we'll lose some kind of leverage, and there's no guarantee that we'll get J.J. back. But he's wrong. I know if we don't pay them, I will never see my boy again. Please, Lily. Please, will you help me?",
        "Lily: I don't know, Carly. I think Jack might be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Oh, thanks. I'm sorry I couldn't eat. You put all that work into that meal. It looked -- it looked really beautiful.",
        "Will: Ah, yeah, well, you'll be hungry again some day. And when you are, you can just look in the fridge.",
        "Gwen: Why? What's in the fridge?",
        "Will: Um, everything from your last pregnancy that you loved. Remember we used to make like pickles and bologna rollups? It was great.",
        "Gwen: Ew, I don't think I should have asked. Thank you.",
        "Will: I guess you're not craving the same stuff this time.",
        "Gwen: I'm not really craving anything. I don't know, they say that every pregnancy is different. Just like every dad is. I'm so glad that you're my baby's dad.",
        "Will: I'm glad that you're his mom.",
        "Gwen: It could be a girl. I don't know, everything really feels like so different this time. I'm happy, and I'm going to take better care of myself. I'm going to do everything right. I'm going to take vitamins, exercise, the -- the whole shabang.",
        "Will: Well, let's just get through the morning sickness first, okay?",
        "Gwen: Okay, well, when I finally can eat, I'm going to let you cook every healthy meal in that book. I'm going to take such good care of myself that by the time the baby's born, he's going to have fully developed pectoralis muscles.",
        "Will: Yeah, we'll call him Hercules.",
        "Gwen: Well, I wish Hercules would let me keep some food down.",
        "Will: Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "Gwen: Where are we going?",
        "Will: We are going outside because I read in the remedy book that fresh air is good for morning sickness. So, you, me and the kid, we're going out.",
        "Gwen: All right. Hey, if we run into anybody, can we -- can we just not tell them? Tell them yet?",
        "Will: My mom already knows.",
        "Gwen: I know. I just want to keep that way, at least for the first trimester. It's just -- it's better luck.",
        "Will: Okay. It'll be our little secret.",
        "Gwen: All right.",
        "Will: I love you.",
        "Gwen: Well, that's handy, 'cause I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: Congratulations. For once, you showed up on time to do some good.",
        "Ava: Don't you ever try anything like that again, Kid! We've been real nice to you so far, but don't press your luck. Silas has been known to run out of patience.",
        "Silas: Kid's got guts, just like Les. Your old man would have done the same thing.",
        "J.J.: Les isn't my dad. Jack Snyder's my dad. Carly's my mom.",
        "Silas: I don't care who claims you as long as they come through with the dough.",
        "Ava: They've got less than an hour. They better hurry up. Should we head out to see if anybody made the drop?",
        "Silas: You've still got time.",
        "J.J.: My dad's not going to let you get away with this.",
        "Silas: Snyder's a smart cop, but he's not going to bring the 5-0 in on this, because he knows you'll pay the price.",
        "Ava: Why, you think your detective daddy might try something funny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Which of these do you think the kidnappers would want? The diamond or the emerald?",
        "Henry: Both. I have feeling they'll settle for cold, hard cash, though.",
        "Vienna: Then I'll call my brother immediately.",
        "Henry: Hold on, hold on, hold on. You are the most unselfish, wonderful woman I know, and I love you for it. But we don't know what the situation is yet, okay?",
        "Vienna: Did I ever tell you how wonderful J.J. was with me when I moved into the farm? He told me that he knew exactly how it was to be a new kid in the house. He gave me a frog. God, I'm so worried about him.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Jack must be going out of his mind.",
        "Vienna: Poor Katie, too. They just started a life together and -- what was supposed to be the happiest day has now turned into be the scariest one.",
        "Henry: Which is why we're going to go down to the studio, we're going to show our support, answer some phone calls.",
        "Vienna: They've set up hotlines?",
        "Henry: Yeah. And if we're lucky, Jack will get some information that will help him crack the case.",
        "Vienna: What are you doing?",
        "Henry: Polishing my shoes.",
        "Vienna: Now? I can't believe I'm saying this. This is no time for vanity. Just grab them and let's go.",
        "Henry: Okay. Goodness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is this some sort of cop rule, never to pay a ransom?",
        "Jack: Yeah. FBI, CIA, pretty everybody, they've proven that it doesn't work.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Jack: Because as long as they want something from us, they will keep J.J. alive. If we give them the money, there's no guarantee that they would demand more, or -- or worse.",
        "Katie: Oh, God, Jack, they wouldn't?",
        "Jack: Yes, they would. That's why -- that's why we have to play it this way.",
        "Katie: So what do you do?",
        "Jack: We set up a money drop, put a lot of cops around the drop area, and we try to catch whoever comes to pick it up.",
        "Katie: Yeah, aren't they going to expect that?",
        "Jack: That's why we have use our best undercovers. Because once we catch this mule, the person who picks up the money, we lean on them. We try to get them to tell us whoever they're working with and where the location of the hostage is.",
        "Katie: I don't know how you do this. Talk like a cop when it's J.J. who's missing.",
        "Jack: It's not easy. Because the dad in me wants -- just wants to give them whatever they want and get my son back. He's just a little kid.",
        "Katie: I know. It's okay. You've got the whole force on this, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, nearly everybody. Yeah, and we got the ransom note, the lab -- hopefully -- hopefully, we'll get some leads out of it.",
        "Katie: Something will break soon, I know it.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad you understand that this isn't about the money. Obviously, we would have found a way to come up with it. But if we stall, we keep J.J. alive until we can find him. And we are. We are going to find him.",
        "Katie: I know. You've been a detective a long time, Jack, and you're one of the best. If there is a way to bring J.J. safe, you will do it, and I'm right behind you. There's no doubt in my mind that you're doing the right thing.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Too bad Carly doesn't feel the same way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I think we should trust Jack's judgment.",
        "Carly: He's wrong.",
        "Lily: You -- you don't know that. He has a job that has given him years of experience with this kind of thing.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not Jack. And I can't go by some police manual on this. You're a mother, too, Lily. You understand. You have an instinct about your child, you have to trust it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and sometimes you react out of panic.",
        "Carly: Look, they want money. In order for me to get J.J. back, I'm going to get them the money. I don't care what I have to do.",
        "Lily: What if Jack is right, and you end up putting J.J. in more danger?",
        "Carly: How could anything be any more dangerous than what's already happened? I just pray that they haven't already hurt him. Lily, please? Please, I'm running out of time here. They want the money in less than an hour.",
        "Lily: Maybe Jack has a plan. Maybe there's a reason he wants you to wait.",
        "Carly: J.J. has been waiting his entire life. Waiting for Les Sweeney to stop abusing him. Waiting for a family that he can be a part of and waiting for me to come back. How could I have left him? For what? What --",
        "Lily: Carly, please -- please -- don't have your guilt have you do something crazy.",
        "Carly: It's not just me feeling guilty. It's J.J. he's been through so much, and none of it's been his fault. I can't just leave him abandoned and alone with these people -- these insane kidnappers.",
        "Lily: Jack has a plan. You know that. He loves J.J. he wants him back as badly as you do. Maybe he doesn't want to reward these people that have taken him or might hurt J.J.",
        "Carly: We don't even know that he hasn't already been hurt. Please? I don't want him with them any longer than absolutely necessary. And you can help him. You're the only person who can help him. Don't turn your back on my son, please?",
        "Lily: I just -- I keep thinking about Luke when he was J.J.'s age, and Damian took him, and I was so worried that he was all right.",
        "Carly: Well, then you know exactly what I'm going through, don't you?",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. Of course, I'll give you the money.",
        "Carly: Oh, thank you.",
        "Lily: Of course.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.",
        "Lily: Everything's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.",
        "Carly: You have to promise me something.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Carly: That we're going to keep this strictly between us.",
        "Lily: I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I'm not sure I'm the one you should be asking to check on Alison.",
        "Susan: I am so worried about her. Please?",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry. You know, but Alison reminded me that it's not really my business anymore what she does or where she's living.",
        "Susan: I know she hurt you. What she did with Dusty was terrible. But you guys have been together for a long time. You must still care about her. You must.",
        "Aaron: I think that's the problem. I care too much.",
        "Susan: Too much to forgive her?",
        "Aaron: I've tried, Susan. I've tried starting over with her a couple of times, it just doesn't work. Too much has happened.",
        "Susan: I know she's not easiest person --",
        "Aaron: Well, it's not even her, you know, it's me, too. You know, Ali is who she is, and I can't seem to stop doing what I do.",
        "Susan: What do you mean?",
        "Aaron: I don't want to get into details, but we seem to fall into this pattern. You know, Ali does something, and I make assumptions about what it -- what it all means. You know, I misunderstand her. And I judge her. And I just end up making things worse for the both of us.",
        "Susan: I thought you might turn me down, but I had to ask.",
        "Aaron: Susan, it's not that I don't want to help. I just don't -- I don't feel like I'm the right person.",
        "Susan: Normally I would ask Emily, but she's gone, and I don't know what to do. I don't know who to turn to. Alison doesn't listen to me. I don't know who she would listen to, except you.",
        "Aaron: Have you tried Dusty?",
        "Susan: Dusty? I wouldn't go to Dusty if I had cancer, and he had the cure. Not anymore.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry I can't help.",
        "Susan: Me, too. But thanks for listening, and I'm sorry about J.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm working.",
        "Dusty: Just take a break.",
        "Alison: Stu, I'm on a five! Doesn't mean I'm going to listen to you.",
        "Dusty: So who cares whether I think you can kick the habit or not?",
        "Alison: You know why that matters to me, Dusty. You were the person who got me off drugs in the first place.",
        "Dusty: You're the one who's got to believe in yourself.",
        "Alison: How? It's pretty hard when everybody's always doubting me.",
        "Dusty: Who's everybody?",
        "Alison: My mom. Aaron. Nobody ever gives me the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Dusty: I think you bring it on yourself.",
        "Alison: Okay, I made a mistake when I bought that meth, but I handled it, and I was about to flush down the toilet when my mom came in and freaked. She and Aaron both think I'm a liar.",
        "Dusty: When are you going to prove them wrong?",
        "Alison: I didn't use it, did I? I'm going to meetings. I'm clean.",
        "Dusty: For how long? And if you leave your mother's house, that's a big support that's all of a sudden, gone.",
        "Alison: I think I'll be fine without my mom hovering over me. Besides, if I stay there, she's just going to send me to rehab.",
        "Dusty: Your mom's a doctor, and she's a recovering alcoholic. She knows what she's talking about. She's trying to help you.",
        "Alison: I already got help from you and Emily. I mean, you saw what I went through when I kicked meth, or don't you remember?",
        "Dusty: I remember. But getting that junk out of your system, that's only stage one, you know that, right?",
        "Alison: Of course I know that, and that's why I'm going to meetings.",
        "Dusty: You scored meth last night. I'm no shrink, but I can safely say, you've got stuff to deal with.",
        "Alison: I'm dealing.",
        "Dusty: By scoring last night? Now, the rehab, they're going to help you figure out what triggers the cravings, you understand?",
        "Alison: I don't need to be locked up with a bunch of addicts. It's not who I am. And besides, isn't the whole point to learn how to live in the real world?",
        "Dusty: Rehab. It's about as real as it gets.",
        "Alison: All I need is for someone to be on my side. I can't believe there isn't one person in my life who believes I can stay straight!",
        "Dusty: There is. Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Jack: For believing in me.",
        "Brad: Jack!",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Brad: Is there anything I can do for you?",
        "Jack: No, Brad, you've done so much with the hotline, the TV spot. I really appreciate you getting that stuff on the air so fast.",
        "Brad: I just hope it helps, all right? Just -- hey, I'm so sorry. I am. All right.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Brad: Look, if you need anything, anything, you let me know, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Brad: All right.",
        "Jack: Thanks a lot, Man.",
        "Katie: Oh, hey, Guys. Thank you so much for coming. I asked Henry and Vienna to help field phone calls.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah. We can use all the hands that we can get.",
        "Vienna: We're so upset about little J.J. Henry and I are going to put up some of the reward money.",
        "Jack: Wow. That's really above and beyond. Thank you.",
        "Henry: The least we can do, Jack.",
        "Katie: Well, come on. Let's get you on the phones.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Jack: Hang on, hold on a second.",
        "Henry: I'll join you guys in a second. Yeah, what's up?",
        "Jack: Let me see your shoes.",
        "Henry: My shoes.",
        "Jack: Yeah, what's all that powdery stuff?",
        "Henry: Oh, man. You know what that is? That's construction dust. We were looking at a new place for the spa. This stuff was everywhere.",
        "Jack: No, no, don't. Don't touch it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: My dad is the best detective in the world. He's going to find me.",
        "Ava: Hey, hey, what do you think you're doing, huh? Are you trying to leave a sign for him?",
        "J.J.: Why would I want to do that? I'm coming with you, right?",
        "Ava: Oh, Kid, you've seen way too many mysteries movies. I'm afraid it doesn't work that way.",
        "J.J.: Then how does it work?",
        "Silas: You're saying with me until Ava gets back safe, on time, with the money.",
        "J.J.: Well, how come I can't",
        "Silas: Because if we get stiffed, I'm going to need some leverage, and that means you. Comprende? And I know if you don't get back in the hour, you got caught.",
        "Ava: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Dear.",
        "Silas: You just better hope none of your dad's pals show up at the drop site. Because if Ava gets nabbed, you're done.",

        "Undercover cop: Please, call me Deke today, Mrs. Snyder.",

        "Aaron: That's cool.",
        "Luke: That's so messed up about J.J.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, pretty tough.",
        "Luke: I just sent out an e-mail blast. Hopefully a personal appeal will drag up some leads. What's wrong?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "Luke: Well, what did Grandma's cobbler ever do to you?",
        "Aaron: Nothing! It's just hard coming back to town and have everything blow up.",

        "Luke: Why? I mean, it seems like you care about her. In fact, it seems like you're in love with her. So, why don't you just tell her?",
        "Aaron: Because too much has gone down. Besides, it's not all Alison's fault. I just -- for some reason, I just can't let this go. You know -- you know how it is.",
        "Luke: Um, no, actually, I don't. I've never really had a long term -- I never really had anything.",

        "Luke: No, it's just, you don't want to fight for the girl you love. And I would do anything to have somebody to fight for. I would do anything to have somebody who cared about me enough to get mad and scream and run away, who loved me enough to give a damn what I thought about them. You know, I would just -- I would love to have somebody care for me that much. But what do I know? After all, I'm just a kid.",
