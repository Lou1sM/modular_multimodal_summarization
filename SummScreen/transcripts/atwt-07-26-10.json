    "Recap": [
        "Bob and Kim talk about his asking Reid to be Chief Of Staff, as she thinks that he should tell Chris personally. Meanwhile, unfortunately a less than tactful Reid is talking to Chris about how the hospital will be different when he takes over, as Chris leaves unsure and annoyed. Luke witnesses Reid not handling a few of the hospital personnel poorly, as he offers to school him in how to grow a personality. After Luke and Reid do some role-playing, Reid feels it isn't possible and bemoans that he isn't Noah, someone who by nature, is warm and fuzzy. Luke promises he doesn't want that, but it would be nice to know where they are headed. Reid offers dinner, but Luke has a \u0091final exam', as they head back to the hospital. Chris finds Kim and asks about Bob's decision. Kim defends it because he wasn't supposed to be staying in town. Chris reveals his plans to now stay, as Kim is overjoyed. Faith and Parker almost have sex, but Parker slows things down. Faith wants to, but Parker realizes that right now her feelings are misplaced by what is going on with her parents. Jack and Carly talk about their relationship, as Carly voices her concerns, as Jack continues to be steadfast in his belief they belong together. He asks her to go for a walk and perhaps a kiss, but their time is interrupted when they spot Parker and Faith in a close moment. They wait and see Parker handle the situation maturely, but are unsure as to what to think when he talks about his parent's confusing marriage. Jack and Carly pretend they just showed up and offer to walk each home separately. Parker opens up to Jack about Faith and Liberty, while Carly and Faith talk a bit about relationships. Both Jack and Carly's eyes are open up to a few things during each of their talks. Chris goes to find Katie and doesn't leave her doorstep until she answers. He promises his support her and promises that what is keeping her from really moving on with him is part of what he loves about her. Katie worries it will be too late by the time she is ready. Chris would like her to decide to meet him halfway so they can figure it out together, as Katie later worries because she likes Chris so much but worries if it doesn't work out. Reid still is unable to truly act with charm or even professionally when faced with his \u0091final', but Luke realizes that is how Reid is and wants Reid to take him to dinner so they can talk about their relationship. Chris tells Bob that he is staying in town and would like to take over at Memorial, as Kim is overjoyed, but Bob explains that he already asked Reid. Chris feigns understanding, as Bob offers to submit both names and let the Board decide. Carly comes home to find her messy house cleaned and some fresh flowers on the coffee table. Jack and Carly confide in one another after their talks with Parker and Faith, as Jack would like his kiss now. Carly acquiesces and Jack promises they are meant to be and she will soon believe that again."

        "Bob: Well, you ready to wrap it up?",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry I forgot to call you. I'm just not ready to leave right now.",
        "Bob: Breaking news?",
        "Kim: Well, in a way. I'm putting together a segment about Barbara's disappearance. I mean, I'm hoping someone will call us with some information.",
        "Bob: You think she's in trouble?",
        "Kim: I have no idea. But if she ran away on her own, then it's time she found out that we are worried about her, and she needs to call us!",
        "Bob: Well, she sent a postcard.",
        "Kim: Yes, but from a -- a cruise to where, Bermuda? Please. I mean, Will found her passport. She can't possibly have left the country. I'm telling you, I just have this feeling that something horrible has happened to her.",
        "Bob: You know, you said yourself that she probably took off after Henry and Vienna's wedding because she was humiliated.",
        "Kim: Oh, she was embarrassed.",
        "Bob: Well, it's certainly understandable that she'd want to spend some time alone. I mean, it can't be easy for a woman that age to lose a man to a younger woman.",
        "Kim: \"A woman that age\"?",
        "Bob: What I meant to say was --",
        "Kim: [Laughs] Don't even think about it. There's no way out of that one. But thank you, Sweetheart, for trying to make me feel better. Which reminds me, making me feel better. Have you spoken to Chris?",
        "Bob: What about?",
        "Kim: Oh, Robert, you know what about.",
        "Bob: Look, he made it very clear that he does not want to follow in my footsteps. He does not want to stay in Oakdale. And I'm sure that he's gonna take off for Africa or Haiti or some other foreign land.",
        "Kim: He needs to hear about Reid from you.",
        "Bob: I guarantee you two things -- he's already heard about it from the hospital grapevine.",
        "Kim: And?",
        "Bob: He doesn't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Chris: Come on, Katie, pick up.",
        "Katie: You've reached the Snyder residence. Leave a message for Katie or Jacob at the beep.",
        "[Voicemail beeps]",
        "Chris: Hey, Katie, it's me, Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Again. Look, I'm gonna keep calling you until you pick up, all right? All right. I know you're avoiding me, but could you at least tell me why? Pick up, pick up. No? Okay. Call me, all right? Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know why I won't talk to him? Because right now, the only man I can relate to is you. I'm pretty good with you, right? You love me, hmm? Good, 'cause you're about the only one. [Sighs] I hope I'm a good mommy. Because when it comes to being a friend or being more than friends, I stink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Which one are you?",
        "Gretchen: Gretchen. Nurse Taylor, Dr. Oliver.",
        "Reid: So you're the idiot who paged me because this patient is in pain? And yet when I come up here to check him out, he's not in pain. He's sleeping.",
        "Gretchen: But he said --",
        "Reid: Yeah, whatever he said at the time -- it's clearly not the case now. Make sure of your facts before you page me. Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Luke: I'm here to be your coach.",
        "Reid: What am I in training for?",
        "Luke: The chief of staff position, remember? You asked me to help you with your people skills.",
        "Reid: Yeah, right. Uh, I decided I don't need that.",
        "Luke: Oh, really? Really? Because you just made that nurse cry.",
        "Reid: Oh, she'll get over it. I -- I get along really well with people.",
        "Luke: With what people? I want names.",
        "Reid: I used to run my own clinic. I work with surgical teams all the time. As long as the patient gets better, that's all that matters.",
        "Chris: Oliver, you forgot to copy me on Harvey O'Bannion.",
        "Reid: Uh, the -- the Parkinson's guy.",
        "Chris: My patient with Parkinson's, yes. You were supposed to brief me post surgery. What happened?",
        "Reid: Well, if I'm cutting him, then he's taken care of. Consider yourself briefed.",
        "Chris: Yeah, look, um, that's not good enough. The Attending's need to be apprized when -- this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna argue with you, okay? We need to keep each other informed. That's the way we do things here at the hospital.",
        "Reid: Until I become chief of staff.",
        "Chris: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Reid: The fact that your father offered me the top spot when he gets his gold watch.",
        "Chris: Just send me the information on my patient. [Clears throat]",
        "Reid: Yeah, see? I handled that okay. You want to get some coffee?",
        "Luke: Yeah, sure, after you can talk to some dude without making them cry or want to kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Faith?",
        "Faith: Condoms.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Faith: I have them in my bag over there.",
        "Parker: You've done this before?",
        "Faith: Sure. Tons of times.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Testosterone -- good. Enter.",
        "Jack: Where is everybody?",
        "Carly: Gone.",
        "Jack: Go -- the party's over already?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. How did a handful of women make such a mess?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: And not one of them stuck around long enough to rinse a dish.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Carly: Are you here for Janet's plates? 'Cause I haven't had time to wash those yet. But if you're in a hurry I can do it --",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. I'm in no hurry. Any dessert left?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Help yourself.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Carly: We didn't even get to that part. [Laughs]",
        "Jack: What happened?",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Well, Lily took off, and, of course, Faith was upset, so she called Holden, and he went looking for Lily.",
        "Jack: Did he find her?",
        "Carly: Yes. And then she disappeared again. And turns out she went to Craig's.",
        "Jack: Craig's? Great.",
        "Carly: Tell me about it. Would you like some coffee with that?",
        "Jack: Why did Lily take off in the first place?",
        "Carly: Because Holden is marrying Molly and she can't stand to watch him happy.",
        "Jack: She told you that?",
        "Carly: She didn't have to. I lived it when you married Janet.",
        "Jack: In all honesty, in retrospect, that was a mistake.",
        "Carly: Which part -- marrying Janet or leaving me? Sorry. Unfair question.",
        "Jack: It deserves an answer. You deserve an answer.",
        "Carly: The last thing I deserve right now is for you to say something that will make me do something stupid.",
        "Jack: Like what?",
        "Carly: Like what we're not doing until we know where we're going. I blame it on the alcohol.",
        "Jack: Me leaving?",
        "Carly: Lily running out of here. It's what I did at Janet's shower.",
        "Jack: Janet and I are divorced. You and I are getting back together.",
        "Carly: So what does that mean? Does that mean that I'm not allowed to -- to think about how it all went to hell, and I'm not allowed to remember how I felt that night, thinking about the two of you being together, taking your vows --",
        "Jack: Carly, please. Carly, stop. Would you please just stop? That's over.",
        "Carly: Over? [Laughing] She's pregnant! She's living on your family's farm with you! It's far from over.",
        "Jack: Okay. Do you want me to leave?",
        "Carly: Not while I'm feeling like this with a bottle of champagne right behind you.",
        "Jack: You want me to take care of that for you?",
        "Carly: If you would do that for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",
        "Jack: What's wrong, Carly?",
        "Carly: I was standing there, looking at that mess, and all I wanted in that moment was you. And then you showed up at the door.",
        "Jack: Carly, we can be together.",
        "Carly: So easily.",
        "Jack: So do you want me to stay or go?",
        "Carly: Unfair question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I know the condom's in here somewhere.",
        "Parker: Look, Faith, its okay. We -- we probably shouldn't do this anyway.",
        "Faith: But I want to.",
        "Parker: I -- I don't understand what the big deal is. You've done it so many times before. You can probably find someone to do it with tomorrow.",
        "Faith: When I said that, I didn't mean it that way.",
        "Parker: I know. I know. I can tell that you haven't done it before.",
        "Faith: [Sighs] How could you tell?",
        "Parker: Nothing really gave it away. It's just your first time really shouldn't be some random hookup in the woods.",
        "Faith: Like you're the expert?",
        "Parker: Well, I know a little bit more about it than you do.",
        "Faith: The only girl you had sex with is Liberty. That doesn't mean you know everything.",
        "Parker: Yes, but I do know that your first time should be special.",
        "Faith: You think I don't know that? That's why I'm choosing here and now with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: What?",
        "Luke: Do you really think that that was the best way to tell Chris?",
        "Reid: How else am I gonna tell him? I'm not gonna write a dissertation every time I operate on one of his patients.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm not talking about that, Reid. The chief of staff job, how Bob offered it to you.",
        "Reid: I thought Chris already knew about that.",
        "Luke: Well, he obviously didn't.",
        "Reid: What -- what does it matter if I tell him or Bob tells him or the tooth fairy fills him in?",
        "Luke: Reid, there are feelings and there are family politics involved in this. You could stand to be a little bit more sensitive.",
        "Reid: Okay. How do I do that?",
        "Luke: Well, that's where I come in. Your shift over?",
        "Reid: Why do you ask?",
        "Luke: You're coming with me.",
        "Reid: Where?",
        "Luke: My place.",
        "Reid: Why?",
        "Luke: Bring your stethoscope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Is Dad on drugs?",
        "Kim: Uh, well, he wasn't when I saw him a few minutes ago.",
        "Chris: I'm serious, Mom -- well, kind of serious. Something is going on. Did he really ask Reid Oliver to be chief of staff when he retires?",
        "Kim: Where did you hear that?",
        "Chris: It's true?",
        "Kim: Honey, your father felt that he really didn't have much choice.",
        "Chris: Of course he had a choice. I mean, did he ask anybody else? Did he post a -- a job listing, try recruiting, pick a name out of a hat? He could have done something.",
        "Kim: What, you had someone else in mind for the job?",
        "Chris: It's a game, isn't it? It's some sort of test. Dad resented it when I told him that I didn't want to be chief of staff when he retires, so now this is his way of getting me to compete for it, isn't it?",
        "Kim: Somehow, I don't think your father would have been so Machiavellian.",
        "Chris: Eh, I wouldn't put it past him.",
        "Kim: You know, he really does admire Reid.",
        "Chris: This guy is a pompous jackass, Mom. I mean, he's got the personality of a rabid porcupine. No humility, no people skills.",
        "Kim: Oh, but the hands of a surgical God.",
        "Chris: Mother --",
        "Kim: Just quoting your father. Christopher, I don't understand this. You've made it quite clear that you are not gonna be living here any longer. So what does it matter to you who gets the job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If I had been able to predict the future the night of Janet's shower, things would have been different.",
        "Carly: You would have ravished me when you had the chance?",
        "Jack: Maybe.",
        "Carly: No, you wouldn't have.",
        "Jack: Could have.",
        "Carly: Oh, not in a million years.",
        "Jack: Hey, it's not like you were pushing me away, Sweetheart.",
        "Carly: No. You are an honorable man.",
        "Jack: You making fun of me?",
        "Carly: I have some cleanup to do. [Sighs]",
        "Jack: You know what bugs me? The way you always paint me as some kind of Dudley Do-Right. I'm not.",
        "Carly: What you are, Jack, is a man of principle.",
        "Jack: So you like my Dudley side?",
        "Carly: You know, before we were married, quite a few guys told me they loved me.",
        "Jack: A few of them married you to prove it.",
        "Carly: But you knew me. Not who I pretended to be, who I am. And you loved me anyway. So when you said those words, being who you are, Dudley, I knew you meant them.",
        "Jack: I still mean them, Carly.",
        "Carly: Don't kiss me.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Carly: 'Cause then I couldn't say no to what happens next. I have to say no.",
        "Jack: We want to be together, Carly. We should be together.",
        "Carly: You're rebuilding that cabin for Janet. You're making a life for her.",
        "Jack: If Janet and Liberty and the baby are gonna be living in that cabin --",
        "Carly: The baby is yours.",
        "Jack: What does that have to do with the way I feel about you?",
        "Carly: This has to do with how I feel. When you come home to me, when you come back to our bed, I want it to be forever. I want you here to stay. I want to be first for you.",
        "Jack: You are. And I'm not trying to change your mind or get into your bed faster than you want me there.",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: Just so we're clear, there's no place on earth I'd rather be.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: Carly, you're first. You're first. You're the first thought I have in the morning. You're the first person I want to call when I'm having a good day or a lousy one. You're first. You're forever.",
        "Carly: Stop it. Stop saying things that make me want you.",
        "Jack: Hmm? How bad do you want me?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Jack: Come on.",
        "Carly: I got to clean up.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] No, wait. I got a better idea. Let's -- let's walk away from it.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, 'cause it will be here later, and I'll have to come back to it.",
        "Jack: No, we'll -- we'll have to come back to it. But I really don't care about that, because today's about impulses. And I want to take a walk with my favorite girl.",
        "Carly: You gonna kiss me on this walk?",
        "Jack: Absolutely. And I'm a man of my word.",
        "Carly: One kiss. No hands.",
        "Jack: You're on. Just so you know, it's gonna be a very long kiss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: So, I've been thinking about it for a while. I just haven't mentioned it to you and Dad yet.",
        "Kim: Oh, Lord, no. You're going to Haiti.",
        "Chris: I've decided not to go.",
        "Kim: [Gasps] You're kidding? Oh, that's so -- oh, it's such wonderful news. What made you change your mind?",
        "Chris: Oh, I don't know. I was, you know, talking to Katie about it, and I realized that there's a need for doctors overseas, but there's a lot of important work to be done here.",
        "Kim: Well, that's very interesting.",
        "Chris: It's not really that profound, Mother. And why are you smiling like that?",
        "Kim: I'm not smiling. I'm not smiling.",
        "Chris: No?",
        "Kim: I'm just happy that you've changed your mind no matter whatever or whomever prompted you to do so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: What do you want me to do?",
        "Luke: All right, well, let's start with hospital etiquette. I will be playing the part of a nurse and you just be your terrible self. All right? [Clears throat] Dr. Oliver, I have a question about some of these orders.",
        "Reid: Can't you read?",
        "Luke: Do you have to be so insulting?",
        "Reid: If you have to be a nurse, do you have to be a stupid nurse?",
        "Luke: All right. We're trying this again. [Clears throat] Dr. Oliver, I have a qu --",
        "Reid: If it's on the chart, it's what I meant. Don't waste my time.",
        "Luke: [Imitates buzzer] Wrong answer. Reid?",
        "Reid: Yeah, okay. Let's, uh, just -- let's try this again.",
        "Luke: All right, all right. [Clears throat] [Sighs] Dr. Oliver, I have a question about some of these orders.",
        "Reid: You know, you're kind of hot. I know you're only a nurse, but, uh, you want to play doctor?",
        "Luke: You're flirting with the nurse.",
        "Reid: Yeah. It's better than yelling at him, though, right?",
        "Luke: Rule number one -- don't yell at the nurse. And rule number two -- don't flirt with the nurse, 'cause they might flirt back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Katie, come on! Let me in! I know you're in there! Please don't make me hurt my hand trying to bust down the door.",
        "Katie: Whoa! Pipe down! The baby's sleeping.",
        "Chris: Oh, I am so sorry. I'm just so happy to see you. Uh! So worried about you.",
        "Katie: Well, you didn't need to be. I'm good.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but last time I saw you, you said you were gonna go, uh, see Henry, try to patch things up. You fell off the grid. What happened?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Chris: Katie, what did he say?",
        "Katie: Imagine the worst possible scenario.",
        "Chris: That bad?",
        "Katie: Worse than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Stop treating me like I'm a baby. I know what I'm doing. There are lots of kids in my class that have sex.",
        "Parker: I'm sure there are.",
        "Faith: Then why won't you have sex with me?",
        "Parker: Because you're you, okay, and -- and we're friends, and we've known each other forever.",
        "Faith: Which is why we should do it. Let's do it, Parker. I know you want to.",
        "Carly: What is it? Oh, my God!",
        "Jack: Carly, shh! Be quiet.",
        "Carly: No, I'm not gonna be quiet! I'm gonna go over there and tell him to knock it off. Parker should know better.",
        "Parker: Faith -- Faith, this is -- this is wrong, okay?",
        "Jack: He does. See?",
        "Faith: You don't want me?",
        "Parker: No, no, I -- I do want you. I -- I do. I definitely do. But -- can you zip your dress back up, please?",
        "Faith: Then why won't you have sex with me?",
        "Parker: Come here, okay?",
        "Faith: I can do it.",
        "Parker: Okay. You -- you get that you're hot, right?",
        "Faith: I am?",
        "Parker: Yes. But you're all twisted up about what's going on with your parents right now, and -- and you're not thinking.",
        "Faith: I don't want to think. Every time I do -- my parents are so insane. My dad is marrying Molly, and -- and now my mom wants my dad back. And -- no one's ever stopped to think about me or my little brother and sister. God, we can't even be a normal family for like five minutes.",
        "Parker: Look, I've been there. I mean, my mom and my dad -- they say that they love each other, but my dad's having a baby with Janet. So no matter what they promise, who knows whether they'll get back together or not?",
        "Parker: The thing about parents is they're always in control.",
        "Faith: Running everything, telling you what to do and what to think.",
        "Parker: And when they lose it, it feels like you've lost it. It can feel like your life is certainly in the drain. But, Faith, it's not.",
        "Faith: If my mother has a meltdown during my dad's wedding, who's gonna take care of Ethan and Natalie and me?",
        "Parker: Your grandmother or your dad or even Molly. I mean, you'll survive it. Do you want to know what happened when I bought into my parents' madness?",
        "Faith: You ran away and married Liberty?",
        "Parker: Yeah, while we were still in high school.",
        "Faith: How romantic.",
        "Parker: No, romantic flew right out the window when we realized that we were broke and we were cold and we were fighting all the time. We thought that we were smart for getting out from under our parents, but all we did was add our mess to their mess. It didn't work. And, Faith, hook -- hooking up with some random guy or me -- it's not gonna make you feel better.",
        "Faith: You don't know that.",
        "Parker: Yes, I do. Look, hooking up with me might make you feel better for a little while, but trust me, Faith, we shouldn't do this.",
        "Carly: Hey! Hi! Hi, Guys!",
        "Jack: We weren't expecting to see you out here.",
        "Parker: We were just hanging out.",
        "Faith: I was looking for my mom, and Parker was just helping me.",
        "Carly: Well, Lily has been in touch, and she's fine.",
        "Faith: She is?",
        "Jack: Yeah. So, you ready to go back home?",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Carly: I will walk Faith home.",
        "Faith: You don't have to do that.",
        "Carly: No, I know. I want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry hates me now.",
        "Chris: But did you try explaining to him that you thought it was gonna make him happy in the end?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I did. I tried. But he saw right through that, just like you did. He blamed me for using his situation with Vienna to work out my problems with losing Brad. But he's right. And now Barbara's missing, and Henry blames himself for breaking her heart and blames me partially for not telling him the truth. And Vienna's off God knows where because the police think that she had something to do with Barbara disappearing.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but do you think Vienna would ever hurt Barbara?",
        "Katie: I don't think she would do something like that. But then again, I didn't think she would fake a miscarriage either, and she did. Desperate people do desperate things. Look at me.",
        "Chris: Look, the only thing you're guilty of is trying to help your friends.",
        "Katie: But I should have known it would turn out this way. I mean, I -- I did know, actually, deep down. Now I've lost Brad and now Henry. I'm losing everyone I care about, and everything's changed.",
        "Chris: Not everyone. And some things don't change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: All right. I'm hospital orderly. I walk up to you, and I say, \"Nice day today, isn't it, Dr. Oliver?\"",
        "Reid: Oh, what the hell kind of lead-in -- yeah, yeah. It's a nice freaking day.",
        "Luke: You know, I have about 50 more of these things that I can go through.",
        "Reid: I'm not Noah, you know?",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Reid: I'm never gonna be warm and fuzzy. I'm probably gonna always forget your birthday, work through Christmas. My idea of sentiment is not taking the last doughnut.",
        "Luke: Reid, I don't want you to be Noah. So, why don't we do this again? I am a hospital orderly. You are the newly appointed chief of staff. I walk up to you. I say, \"It's a nice day today, isn't it, Dr. Oliver?\"",
        "Reid: Yeah, it is. It's a great day.",
        "Luke: That was easy.",
        "Reid: No, it's doable. It's a lot easier with you than with some of these other idiots.",
        "Luke: Well, if you can play nice with me, you can play nice with anyone.",
        "Reid: What if I only want to play nice with you?",
        "Luke: I don't want you to be Noah. But if this is gonna be anything, I really need to know you.",
        "Reid: You want to work on that over dinner?",
        "Luke: Sure -- after you pass your final.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I -- I just don't get it. I mean, first, Faith was crying, and then we were hugging, and then we were kissing. And what happened here?",
        "Jack: Girl party.",
        "Parker: Aren't girls supposed to be neat?",
        "Jack: Have you seen your sister's room lately? You want something to drink?",
        "Parker: Uh, no. I'm good, except Faith is probably really mad at me right now.",
        "Jack: Listen, you were right not to let things go too far.",
        "Parker: It felt like I had to protect her, but I -- I still can't figure out how I'm supposed to do that.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Parker: Well, like watching out for Faith today. I mean, was that a good decision?",
        "Jack: It was an excellent decision.",
        "Parker: Okay, because every time I try to help Liberty or protect her, she gets really mad at me because she hates it, and I always push her too far. And -- and I can't help myself. I can't stop myself. I mean, how do you do that?",
        "Jack: You're asking me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Thanks for walking me home. I'll be okay. You don't have to stick around.",
        "Carly: I -- I thought you might want to talk.",
        "Faith: About?",
        "Carly: Parker, your parents, the wedding, whatever.",
        "Faith: What about it?",
        "Carly: I know it's probably strange, your father marrying Molly. But the truth is, your family is still your family.",
        "Faith: I guess.",
        "Carly: I have a lot of experience in this department.",
        "Faith: Tell me about it. You had an affair with my father.",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna get into that with you.",
        "Faith: It wrecked my parents' marriage.",
        "Carly: No, it didn't. Actually, your parents got back together after what happened between your father and me. And your mother forgave me. If she hadn't, would we be in business together now?",
        "Faith: Guess not. But with her, who knows?",
        "Carly: Faith, as you grow up, you learn that we all make mistakes.",
        "Faith: I know that already.",
        "Carly: But in the end, things do work out the way they're supposed to. Faith, maybe you could listen to somebody who has been where you are headed.",
        "Faith: Where's that?",
        "Carly: I don't know what did or didn't happen in the woods.",
        "Faith: You think Parker and I --",
        "Carly: And I'm -- I'm not asking.",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Carly: What I do know is that everybody wants to be loved, even when it's hard to figure out what that means.",
        "Faith: I know.",
        "Carly: Oh, you know? Good. I got to run.",
        "Faith: Wait. But what were you gonna say?",
        "Carly: If you ask a guy if he wants to sleep with you, the answer's almost always gonna be yes.",
        "Faith: What if you ask a guy if he loves you?",
        "Carly: You shouldn't have to. And if he says it, you have to be sure that he means it.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Carly: You wait and talk and do things together. Then you ask yourself, does he listen to me? Does he make time for me? Does he do nice things for me, even when I don't ask?",
        "Faith: What if he looks at other girls?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] That depends on how often he looks and how long. But if he wants to be with somebody else, you got to let him go.",
        "Faith: What if I don't want to wait?",
        "Carly: I hope you will.",
        "Faith: Why should I take advice from you? I mean, your life is just as much of a mess as mine.",
        "Carly: That's true. But I'm sorting it out. And I want you to be able to do the same. True love is worth waiting for, Faith. It really, really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What about Liberty?",
        "Parker: You know, it's been a while since I really thought about any girl besides Liberty. But she hasn't exactly been focused on me lately.",
        "Jack: Hmm. And how does that make you feel?",
        "Parker: It's whatever. It's not my decision to make.",
        "Jack: It never is.",
        "Parker: So what I'm thinking is that maybe I should be spending more time with Faith or whoever. I mean, I don't know.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, Parker. Here -- here's something that no one's ever gonna tell you. Not knowing is actually a good thing because you're young and you got your whole life to figure it out.",
        "Parker: That's great.",
        "Jack: Another thing you should know, rushing her is the easiest way to lose sight of what's important.",
        "Parker: Did you do that?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Parker: Dad, what are you thinking about?",
        "Jack: That I should clean this place. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Listen to me. I am not going anywhere, and I don't know what it's gonna take to get you to believe that.",
        "Katie: But we don't even know if I can sleep with you. What is the point of waiting?",
        "Chris: The point, Katie, is you. The point is you. Your illogical way of thinking -- I mean, one minute you are driving me nuts, and then the next minute, you've got me laughing. Katie, the way you love your son -- that hits me in a spot in my heart that I didn't even know was there. And the stubborn way you hold on to Brad and his memory --",
        "Katie: Makes you want to give up.",
        "Chris: Katie, it makes me want to dig in and just wait for the day you'll never want to let me go.",
        "Katie: Do you think you'll feel that way about me someday?",
        "Chris: Katie, I am already there. It's up to you. Now, you can sit here in your house and -- and wallow in self-pity, or you can decide to meet me halfway and we'll figure out how to move forward together. You know where to find me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I've been visited by elves. Magical cleaning elves. Did you do this?",
        "Parker: No, it was his idea.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you very much. Thank you.",
        "Parker: I'm gonna take this outside.",
        "Carly: And thank you.",
        "Jack: You surprised?",
        "Carly: I'm impressed. You -- you got to love a guy who loads the dishwasher without being asked.",
        "Jack: You just used the \"l\" word.",
        "Carly: And I'm not taking it back.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. I just wish the rest of life's messes were as easy to clean up as the dishes.",
        "Jack: How'd it go with Faith?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, I thought that I was going to impart all of these words of wisdom.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Carly: It turns out she really got me thinking.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Carly: Looking at us now, it's sort of hard to believe that this is how things are meant to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Okay. Here's your chance.",
        "Reid: Oh, no, not this one again. She leaks the tears.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. Just go.",
        "Reid: Nurse --",
        "Luke: Her name's Gretchen.",
        "Reid: Gretchen, do you, uh -- do you have a minute?",
        "Gretchen: Yes, Dr. Oliver.",
        "Reid: I just wanted to say -- it's turned out to be a nice day, hasn't it?",
        "Gretchen: Yes, it did.",
        "Reid: Yeah.",
        "Gretchen: What did I do wrong now?",
        "Reid: Nothing. No, not as far as I know. Although given your track record, it's highly possible you've committed some catastrophic blunder since I've been gone. Where are you going? Where's she going? She asked me a question. I answered. I was being civil!",
        "Luke: You know -- you're very lucky I like you despite yourself.",
        "Reid: What does that mean?",
        "Luke: Let's eat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You just missed a visit from Chris. It was kind of rough on me, saying I'm feeling sorry for myself. What do you think? Do you think I'm keeping myself from taking another chance 'cause I'm scared it won't last? Its unanimous then. I know. I'm just scared to go there again. I like him. I do. I really, really do. But if I try and have more and it doesn't work out, I just don't know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I am so glad I caught the two of you together.",
        "Bob: Hey.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, how wonderful. Sit down. Join us for dinner.",
        "Chris: For dinner? No.",
        "Kim: No?",
        "Chris: Um, Dad, I'm sure Mom has told you, I decided to stay in Oakdale.",
        "Bob: Yes, she -- she did mention that. Uh, first, um, there's something that, uh, I want to mention to you after I ask you a question.",
        "Kim: Oh, you don't want to do that.",
        "Bob: Yes, I do want to do that. I'm glad you're staying in town. Does this, uh, have anything to do with your attraction to Katie?",
        "Chris: Well, to be honest, I really don't know what's happening with Katie right now.",
        "Kim: Oh. Does that mean you may be leaving anyway?",
        "Chris: Look, I can tell you this -- I like her, and I would like it to develop into something more. But I'm not gonna start building my life around her.",
        "Kim: Well, that's very mature of you, Chris. It really is.",
        "Chris: In fact, I've got another reason to stay. Dad, I want to take over as chief of staff of Memorial when you step down.",
        "Kim: Honey, that's wonderful news! That's what your father's always wanted.",
        "Bob: Well, it certainly always seemed like the perfect solution to me, but it's not as simple as that. I've already offered the job to Dr. Oliver.",
        "Chris: But it's not a done deal yet.",
        "Bob: No. But I can't rescind that offer. It wouldn't be fair.",
        "Kim: Well, isn't there something you can do about it?",
        "Chris: No, Mom, it's -- it's okay.",
        "Kim: Well --",
        "Bob: What I can do is, uh, submit you both for that position and let the hospital board decide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Everything we're dealing with -- I know it's not ideal. But we're moving in the right direction.",
        "Carly: I don't know. Every time I think we've worked out all of our issues, something else unexpected comes up.",
        "Jack: But we always end up loving each other.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack --",
        "Jack: No. It's okay. I'm not gonna push you into letting me move in, not today. But I am taking that kiss.",
        "Carly: One kiss. No hands.",
        "Jack: It's meant to be.",
        "Carly: I hope you're right.",
        "Jack: I am.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Katie: Oh, Henry --",
        "Chris: Katie needs to feel safe, like she's got someone to lean on. And if I'm here running the hospital, I can do that for her.",
        "Paul: I have good news. Mom used her credit card here in town.",
        "Henry: She probably bought some lingerie here. Have you seen her?",
        "Emily: Eliza, we are gonna go down and talk to a lady about your grandma.",
        "Will: Maybe we should go back to Mom's room and see if there's anything we overlooked the first time.",
        "Gwen: That's a great idea."
