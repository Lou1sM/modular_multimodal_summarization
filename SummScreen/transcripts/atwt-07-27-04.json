        "Alison: All of this stuff is for me?",
        "Emily: And Chris. Reverend Elkins wants to make sure you understand the seriousness of the step you're about to take.",
        "Alison: If I wanted to go back to school, I would enroll in Oakdale U.",
        "Emily: Alison, this is not school. This is an hour or so of counseling with the minister. And his secretary says you have to read over all this information and be prepared to discuss the issues that may come up during marriage.",
        "Alison: Like \"My channel or yours: The newlyweds' guide to sharing the remote\"?",
        "Emily: Will you just read it, please? And nod politely.",
        "Alison: What happened?",
        "Chris: Don't look at your hand -- look at me. You're going to be all right, Em. I promise.",
        "Emily: I was such a klutz this afternoon. I -- I was cleaning out the basement. And I was going through all this junk, and of course, I ran right into one of Hal's abandoned home improvement projects. A nail got stuck in my hand. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Ouch. Did it bleed a lot?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, but they sewed it up almost good as new.",
        "Alison: You must have freaked out. You go nuts when you see blood. When we were cutting up shish kebabs, and you nicked your thumb, and you blacked out? I was screaming for Mom. Do you remember that?",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Its nuts, isn't it? I mean, I couldn't believe it, but like I said, I'm good as new. Anyway, I want you to read over this --",
        "Alison: Who took you?",
        "Emily: Took me where?",
        "Alison: Well, you had to go to the emergency room. You had a nail stuck in your hand. How did you drive yourself to the hospital?",
        "Emily: Uh, well -- actually, I wasn't alone.",
        "Alison: Oh, good. Who took you?",
        "Emily: Chris did.",
        "Alison: Chris? How did you end up with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Tom remembering.]",
        "Tom: How do you expect us to have reconciliation when the entire thing is based on a lie?!",
        "Margo: Because, my God, Tom, I didn't want to lose you! I knew how little it meant in my heart, and so I tried to belittle it to you and make it seem like it was just one kiss. I know it was stupid, and I know I was fooling myself and I wasn't fooling you. I just want to make this right. I don't want to hurt you like this. God! Tell me what I can do to make it right!",
        "Tom: I don't think you can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Thank you.",
        "Doc: Tom --",
        "Tom: Well, look who's speechless for the first time in his arrogant life.",
        "Doc: I'm just surprised to see you, that's all.",
        "Tom: Oh, well, see, I'm staying here for now. Not that I owe you an explanation.",
        "Doc: It's not because -- don't tell me you left Margo?",
        "Tom: You can drop the devastated act. It's not very convincing. I mean, you should be the last person that's surprised.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You told Ben that I slept with Doc?",
        "Jessica: No, of course not!",
        "Ben: I'm sorry, Margo, I didn't mean for --",
        "Margo: Did she you tell you that I slept with Doc?",
        "Ben: Jessica didn't tell me anything. I heard things at the Country Club, and since Tom left, I assumed --",
        "Margo: Well, you assumed wrong! I did not sleep with Doc Reese.",
        "Ben: Look, you don't owe me any explanations.",
        "Margo: I most certainly do not. But that doesn't mean you don't deserve an explanation. Does it, Jessica?",
        "Ben: Am I missing something here?",
        "Jessica: You know, obviously you're upset, so maybe Ben and I should just go.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. I want you here. I want you both here. See, you -- you've got an awful lot of questions about Doc Reese, don't you, Ben?",
        "Ben: You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to.",
        "Margo: How about the truth? Wouldn't that be a good thing right about now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: No, no!",
        "Nikki: Jack's one of those cops with unbelievable instincts. Do you have any idea what made him bring Starziak in alone instead of waiting for EMS or a black and white?",
        "[Molly remembering.]",
        "Molly: Get him out of here please, Jack.",
        "Starziak: What's the matter, Molly? You afraid of me?",
        "Molly: You either get him out of here or give me a gun! He tried to kill me!",
        "Jack: Enough!",
        "Starziak: I'll kill you yet, you -- aah!",
        "Jack: Want me to break your other arm, too? I will.",
        "Carly: All right, let's go upstairs, okay?",
        "Molly: No, no, not until he's gone.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? Fine. I'll bring him to the hospital myself.",
        "Carly: No. No, Jack. Hal said to wait for backup.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Look, I just wanted that monster away from me, okay? And I asked Jack if he would -- none of that really matters right now though, does right? Hal and Holden and all of the other cops are at the bridge searching, right?",
        "Nikki: We've called uniforms in from all shifts. They will turn the place inside out.",
        "Molly: And they'll find him. They'll rescue him, and everything will be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack! Where are you?! Jack!",
        "Holden: Carly, you've got to hang on -- I'm going to go down the embankment --.",
        "[Carly screaming]",
        "Hal: Carly, this isn't doing anybody any good.",
        "Carly: No, I'm gonna go, Hal! I'm gonna go down there.",
        "Hal: You're not going anywhere until you get a grip.",
        "Carly: And how am I supposed to do that, Hal?! My husband just went off this bridge!",
        "Hal: We don't know that. You don't know anything for sure.",
        "Carly: I know Jack is missing, and you're just standing here. So let me go, Hal! If you're not going to find him, I will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Look, if you left Margo because someone saw us here talking earlier --",
        "Tom: Because you talked to her? You think I'm camping out at the Lakeview because you talked to my wife?",
        "Doc: Listen, I wouldn't presume to know. All I'm saying is, when I saw Margo earlier, she had mentioned something about talking to you this evening.",
        "Tom: Now that's good. That must be years of cheating with other guys' wives.",
        "Doc: Oh, come on now, listen. I'm not trying to start anything here.",
        "Tom: A little too late for that, wouldn't you say?",
        "Doc: Okay, all right. There's something you want to get off your chest, there's something you want to tell me. So go ahead. Just get it out in the open.",
        "Tom: Okay, yeah. In fact, I did talk to Margo. But I had a very enlightening conversation with another young woman who works over at the Country Club.",
        "Doc: Oh, come on. Jill?",
        "Tom: Oh, you must be acquainted with her.",
        "Doc: Yes, yes, and she's nothing but trouble.",
        "Tom: Hmm. Well, what's worse, Doc? The fact that she blew yours and Margo's story out of the water, or that Margo confirmed everything she said? Uh-oh, you got that look again. You see, that's the look of \"how much does this poor sap know, or what could I deny in front of him?\" Well, I can help you with that, too. I know about all your romps with Margo in the locker room, the steam room. God knows where else.",
        "Doc: We never slept together.",
        "Tom: I know. I got the latest official update. You know, it's funny. It was one kiss, and now it's, \"we never slept together.\"",
        "Doc: Well, you should believe her, because it's true. Margo and I never slept together.",
        "Tom: No, but you groped and moaned in some very public places like a couple of stupid teenagers. But you never made love! I mean, you wouldn't take it that far, right? So since you didn't actually make love, you guys get to walk away from this your virtue intact? I mean, \"why won't Tom stop being such a pain in the neck? Why can't he just let this go\"? Is it something like that?",
        "Doc: Well, yeah, you should let it go. Because no matter what you believe --",
        "Tom: I'll tell you what I believe! I believe that you blew a hole clear through my marriage! You took what is most important and the things that I love the most, and you destroyed them! So I hope that someday, somehow, I can repay that favor to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Margo, you don't want to do this.",
        "Margo: How do you know what I want?",
        "Jessica: I only meant --",
        "Margo: I want to do this. I've never wanted to do anything more in my whole life.",
        "Ben: All right, then talk to us. That's why we're here. Obviously, there's a problem. So let's get it all out in the open.",
        "Margo: Yeah, let's do that.",
        "Jessica: Margo, please --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Margo: Hello.",
        "Nikki: Margo, hi. It's Nikki Munson down at the station. I'm calling for my dad.",
        "Margo: Nikki, this is not a good time, really.",
        "Nikki: It's about Jack Snyder. He's -- he's missing.",
        "Margo: What do you mean, missing? Wasn't he supposed to be protecting Molly McKinnon?",
        "Nikki: Yeah. But something went wrong. He went back to the house, and one of his officers was taken out.",
        "Margo: Officer Kane?",
        "Nikki: Yes. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Starziak?",
        "Nikki: Yeah. And Jack collared him and was bringing him in, and we lost contact between his place and the drop-off.",
        "Margo: Nikki, you're not telling me everything.",
        "Nikki: There's been an accident at the Route 17 bridge.",
        "Margo: Jack?",
        "Nikki: My dad thinks so. He could be hurt, or worse. I just -- I thought you might want to come down to the station. My dad's pulled in all available cops, and I'm trying to coordinate, but --",
        "Margo: I'm on my way. I've got to get down to the station.",
        "Jessica: Of course. We can talk about all of this tomorrow.",
        "Margo: Oh, you bet we will.",
        "Jessica: Let's go, sweetheart.",
        "Ben: Whatever is going on here, we're going to deal with it, and soon. 'Cause I don't like this.",
        "Margo: Casey!",
        "Ben: Good-night, Margo. Good-night, Case.",
        "Casey: Mom?",
        "Margo: Listen, I've got to get down to the station 'cause something has come up, okay?",
        "Casey: Well, when are you coming back?",
        "Margo: I'm not really sure, okay?",
        "Casey: Are you meeting Dad?",
        "Margo: No, no, it's something else.",
        "Casey: Well, where is he? I mean, it's late. Why isn't he home?",
        "Margo: Casey, your dad is not coming home tonight.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Margo: I can't get into this right now.",
        "Casey: It's 'cause you two had a fight, isn't it? Is Dad moving out? Are you guys getting divorced?",
        "Margo: Casey, honey, please --",
        "Casey: I need to know, Mom. I need to know now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I can't let you go down there, Carly. It's too dangerous.",
        "Carly: I cannot just stand here and watch, Hal. Jack could be hurt. He might need me. Please, let me help you. Please!",
        "Hal: I've got a dozen men on the banks, Carly. I've got divers in the water, another team canvassing. I got --",
        "Officer: Lieutenant Munson?",
        "Hal: Munson here.",
        "Carly: What's going on, Holden?",
        "Holden: That's probably the search team now.",
        "Carly: You heard something, didn't you?",
        "Holden: One of the divers told me that they reached Jack's car.",
        "Carly: They found Jack's car! Did they find Jack?",
        "Hal: Apparently, there was no one inside.",
        "Carly: That's good, right? He could have been thrown from the car. He could be on the riverbank somewhere, right?",
        "Hal: Yes, yes --",
        "Carly: Well, then let's go and search the riverbank then!",
        "Holden: They're on it now. All of Hal's men are searching the whole area.",
        "Hal: Carly, you should go back to the station.",
        "Carly: No. No, I can't do that.",
        "Hal: Look, all leads are phoned into central command. We're set up to organize leads. Carly, you'll get a much better picture at the station.",
        "Carly: I will not leave him here, Hal.",
        "Holden: Carly, all those guys down there are like brothers to Jack. They're not going to miss anything.",
        "Carly: Okay, let's go. Jack -- come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly. Carly. Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know, I should be thanking you.",
        "Alison: Me? How come?",
        "Emily: Because if you weren't marrying Chris, he might never have showed up at my front door and found me in a puddle of blood trying to get a nail out of my hand. You know what? Do me a favor. Wear that little --",
        "Alison: Wait a minute. Why did Chris come by the house? Why didn't he just give you a call?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Maybe he -- I don't know, wanted to talk about all this premarital stuff and thought I had some insight.",
        "Alison: That doesn't make any sense. Because I saw Chris earlier at the hospital, and he didn't say anything about taking you to the E.R. or the meeting.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Emily: Well, uh --",
        "Chris: Hey, you two.",
        "Emily: Speak of the devil! We were just talking about you. I was just telling Alison how you took me to the E.R. today.",
        "Chris: You told her?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, of course I told her. I told her how lucky I was the you showed at my front door when I was throwing out all that junk in my basement, and the nail found my hand. I can't even believe that.",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's lucky that I did that, 'cause --",
        "Emily: I know. And I was also telling Alison, I gave her all the information about the conference with the minister tomorrow morning. And you guys have to be there together, on time.",
        "Alison: Why didn't you say anything about this when I saw you at Memorial?",
        "Emily: Ali, would you leave the guy alone? It's not a big a deal.",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, like Emily said, everything got taken care of. I guess I was just so preoccupied with rounds. Will you excuse me for a second? I need to call in some patient meds.",
        "Emily: Sure.",
        "Alison: Hold on for a second. I barely even saw you all day. I didn't even get a chance to talk to you. And when I told you about the key, you barely even said anything at all.",
        "Chris: Well, we'll talk, okay? This will just take a second.",
        "Emily: Go make your call. Alison, come here. You won another key, and you didn't tell me? Congratulations.",
        "Alison: Thank you. I just wish Chris was as impressed as you are. Something's not right.",
        "Emily: Honey, he went to make a call. It's not a big deal.",
        "Alison: No, it's like lately, his head is always someplace else, you know?",
        "Emily: Well, maybe he's distracted about something at work.",
        "Alison: It's more than that. Did he say anything to you at all about what's bothering him?",
        "Emily: To me? No. Why would he? I mean, honey 15 minutes today -- I mean, I don't know, a few minutes today we spent together. But other than that, I never see him. I mean, we're certainly not close enough where we would confide in each other.",
        "Alison: That's not true. That's not true at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Look, baby, I already told you that your father and I are having problems.",
        "Casey: That doesn't tell me anything, Mom, okay? Everybody has problems. Why aren't you giving me a real answer? Are you and Dad breaking up?",
        "Margo: I wish that I could stay here and talk through this with you, but I can't.",
        "Casey: So stay, Mom. If you really wanted to, you would.",
        "Margo: I can't, I can't. Something has come up at the station, and they need me.",
        "Casey: I need you.",
        "Margo: Don't you think this is breaking me up, too?! I'm sorry, baby. I know that you deserve better answers. I know you do. But something is happening -- an emergency at the station. And we're just gonna have to talk about family tomorrow.",
        "Casey: But Mom --",
        "Margo: Look, Casey, tomorrow. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Well, I'm finished here -- finished with you.",
        "Doc: Wait, Tom. You're making a big mistake. You don't want to do this",
        "Tom: Are you about to advise me as to what to do with my marriage?",
        "Doc: Margo is a good woman, and she loves you, Tom. She loves you to death.",
        "Tom: Oh, she tell you that?",
        "Doc: Yes, yes, she did.",
        "Tom: Oh, when? Was that before or after she stripped naked and hopped in the sauna with you?",
        "Doc: Okay, okay. You said I messed up something really great in your life.",
        "Tom: Mm-hmm.",
        "Doc: But it doesn't have to be that way. Not over a couple of chance meetings and a few kisses that got out of line. If you leave Margo, you're going to be the one destroying something great.",
        "Tom: Where do you think you get off giving me advice about my wife or my marriage?",
        "Doc: Somebody has to. Because you're angry as hell, and I understand that. But leaving her is not the answer. In fact, it's the worst mistake you could possibly make.",
        "Tom: The only mistake I made was not taking you out when I had the chance.",
        "Doc: Oh, yeah?",
        "Tom: Yeah.",
        "Doc: Okay, you want a piece of me, D.A.? Okay, bring it on.",

        "Nikki: You said floods? Yes, I'm coordinating all teams via radio dispatch. And sensitive info on hard lines. Yes, good. Call me back in ten.",
        "Hal: Did you set up command lines, Nikki?",
        "Nikki: Yes, and Jenkins just phoned in.",
        "Hal: What's he got?",
        "Nikki: Well, he's got coordination between all four units. But still no sign of Starziak or Jack.",
        "Hal: Nothing new since I left the scene?",
        "Nikki: There has been one thing --",
        "Carly: What? Is it about Jack?",
        "Hal: Go ahead.",
        "Nikki: It's been raining pretty hard up north, and the rivers are swollen and the currents are swift. The search site is expanding quickly, that's all.",
        "Carly: What you're really saying is that there's a chance they won't find him.",
        "Molly: They are going to find him.",
        "Carly: Get away from me.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Carly: You heard me. Molly Carly --",
        "Carly: And don't touch me.",
        "Molly: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: You did this.",
        "Molly: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: You didn't calm down, you wouldn't listen, you had to have it your way, and now my husband is missing. This is your fault, Molly.",

        "Alison: The big wedding surprise you and Chris are planning for me? I'm not a kid anymore. Did you think I would just forget about that?",
        "Emily: Hope springs eternal.",
        "Alison: Oh, my gosh. You are so lame. And that whole story that you made up about the whole flat tire on Old Marsh Road?",
        "Emily: Oh, come on. I was very convincing, for a while. You can't blame me for trying, right? And don't even try, because I'm not going to tell you anything about what Chris and I are planning for you, sweetie.",
        "Alison: You know, Emily, I wasn't trying to blow your surprise. I was just wondering, hoping if Chris mentioned anything, you know, what's bothering him?",
        "Emily: No. He hasn't dropped the slightest hint about what's bothering him. I think maybe you're the one who has pre-wedding jitters.",
        "Chris: Emily.",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Chris: Hi. You're still here. I thought I saw your car pull out. You know what, I'll give you two some time alone.",
        "Alison: Oh, no, Chris, come on. Hang out with us.",
        "Emily: It's so warm in here, you guys. Is anybody else parched?",
        "Alison: Oh, I made some fresh iced tea. Do you want some?",
        "Emily: I'd love some. Thanks. She seems to think you've been distracted lately.",
        "Chris: Are you afraid that she's gonna figure out what's going on with us?",
        "Emily: Actually, she's like a pit bull when it comes to these things. And I think she's gonna keep digging away until she figures it out. So maybe it's best if you and I come clean about everything and tell her that we're partners and we're in this game together, looking for the keys, and we're gonna give them to her when we find them all so she wins.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, what about the whole idea of surprising her? You know, I mean, the look on her face when we hand her the keys worth $300,000.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you're right. I guess you're right.",
        "Chris: Unless, of course, after today you think I'm some sort of jinx?",

        "Jessica: What? Margo gets called down to the police station on short notice all the time.",
        "Ben: No, I'm not talking about some crisis on Margo's job. Don't treat me like I just dropped onto the planet!",
        "Jessica: I'm not!",
        "Ben: What are you hiding from me?",
        "Jessica: Nothing. How could you even say that?",
        "Ben: Because Margo is furious at you and neither one of you will tell me what's going on.",
        "Jessica: I have tried to reassure her that everything would be okay. And so now that Tom has left, maybe she thinks --",
        "Ben: But why would Tom leave Margo if she swears up and down that she didn't sleep with Doc?",
        "Jessica: Honey, how should I know?",
        "Ben: Well, you're running interference for her. Did you say something to Tom?",
        "Jessica: No. I would never say anything to Tom that would hurt him. Yes, I have talked to him, but only to try to make things better. That's all I've ever wanted, is to make it better.",
        "Ben: Well, things are not better. And from what I saw tonight, Margo hasn't said everything that's on her mind.",

        "Doc: Nah, don't worry about it.",
        "Tom: I told you, I'm not going to fight with you.",
        "Doc: Yeah, I remember. The D.A.'s reach is much longer than a right hook.",
        "Tom: No, I'm not going to take a swing at you because I'm not going to stoop down to your level. But here's something that I do want you to hear. I don't want to ever hear any more advice from you.",
        "Doc: Fine by me.",
        "Tom: The only thing I want to see you do is pack your bags and leave this town.",
        "Doc: Yeah, right. I'm not going anywhere, so just forget it.",

        "Tom: Is she there?",
        "Casey: No, she had to go to the station. Dad, what's going on between you two?",
        "Tom: I'll tell you what. I'm gonna stop by in the morning. We'll talk about all of it then.",
        "Casey: That's the same bogus line Mom fed me. How come neither of you are willing talk to me? What is going on?",
        "Tom: Look, it's kind of complicated, and right now is just not the time.",
        "Casey: Don't do that, Dad. I'm not a little kid, okay? I get that things go wrong sometimes. But you love Mom. I know you do.",

        "Molly: If jack's car went off the road, it's because Starziak did something.",
        "Carly: And why was Jack alone with him, Molly? Why was he breaking procedure? Why was he taking a violent felon away from the scene without backup?",
        "Molly: That monster had just tried to kill me!",
        "Carly: Jack had it under control, didn't he? He had handcuffs on the guy. He had his gun trained on him. You could have come upstairs with me, washed your face, calmed down. But, no, you got hysterical, and you forced him to take Starziak away before the backup unit even got there!",
        "Molly: Carly, you have to know -- you have to believe me. I would never in a million years do anything to put Jack in danger.",
        "Carly: But you did. Because it was more important to you to be the center of attention than to think about anybody else.",
        "Molly: That's not true!",
        "Carly: You are always dragging other people into your drama, Molly.",
        "Molly: That's so unfair!",
        "Carly: And those are the people that have to pay. Look at Abigail. She had to stand trial because of your lousy past. And Jake? He paid with his life, didn't he? Well, that better not happen with Jack! Because he wasn't yours to waste, Cuz! He was mine. He is mine! He's my life! He's everything to me!",
        "Holden: You have every right to be upset. But blaming other people -- that's not helping. Let's just stay focused on trying to find Jack.",
        "Carly: No, you're right. We need to find Jack. And you -- you need to get out of my sight.",

        "Carly: I never should have let him leave with that animal. I knew it was against procedure. I knew it was risky. I knew it.",
        "Emma: There was no way you could have known what would happen. No way. Now, come on. Don't you worry. Jack's going to come home. He's going to come home safe and sound. You'll see.",
        "Carly: Is Parker asleep?",
        "Emma: Yeah. He was a little fussy, so he wanted to sleep in your bed. So I let him, okay? A little tea. Would you like a cup?",
        "Carly: It's late. You probably want to get home, huh?",
        "Emma: How would you like it if I stayed here tonight with you and Parker? I could make up the guest room. Should I?",
        "Carly: I don't want to put you out.",

        "Nikki: Yeah. One and two. Is that okay?",
        "Margo: Well, I would have done three since the search radius has expanded. But that's a good start. That's a good start. So, Officer Kane's family, have they been notified?",

        "Hal: Sure. I might need some emotional support. Come on.",
        "Molly: Carly's -- she's right. I drag everybody down with me. I did it to you and Lily and Abby and Jake.",
        "Holden: Beating yourself up is not gonna help find Jack. It's not going to help make things better with Carly, either. And it's certainly not gonna get you through this.",

        "Casey: No, that's not all right, but obviously that doesn't matter.",
        "Tom: No, I know it's hard to wait, especially when it seems that everything is riding on this one point. But there are two things I can tell you. Whatever happened between your mom and me is not your fault. Number two -- your mom loves you. I love you. And that will never change. Not ever.",
        "Casey: I love you, too, Dad.",
