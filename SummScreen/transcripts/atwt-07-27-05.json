        "Henry: Nothing but soft Corinthian leather and shampooed carpets.",
        "Moe: Yeah, you keep a real nice house.",
        "Henry: Put a sock in it, Moe. You want to pay me the $500 that you lost last night? Do you? I didn't think so. You know the deal. For today, this is my car, not my residence. And you are my driver. And I insist on a man in uniform.",
        "Moe: Aw, come on.",
        "Henry: Or cash. Whichever you like. That's right, put it on.",
        "Moe: All right, all right. What about the furball?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Here, can you throw this over him? Not a peep out of you until I can explain things to my sister, all right? Hopefully, this will be a quick turnaround. Meet her at the plane, I'll show her a few sights and then she'll get on the next plane out of town. Madeline.",
        "Maddie: Henry!",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, hey, hey, little sister! I can't believe you are here.",
        "Maddie: Me, neither. Finally!",
        "Henry: Let me take a look at you. Let me take a look at you. Oh, my goodness. Oh, no, get out of here with that. You are still the most gorgeous Coleman. You know, of the girls, at least.",
        "Maddie: Oh, and you are still a world champion liar.",
        "Henry: My apologies for the help.",
        "Maddie: Is this your car?",
        "Henry: Well, you know.",
        "Maddie: Your driver?",
        "Henry: Only the best for my little sister.",

        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Waitress: What can I get for you?",
        "Mike: Coffee and a bagel.",
        "Waitress: That's it?",
        "Mike: That's it.",

        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Paul: Come back to me. Be with me. Rosanna, come back. And I promise that we will never be apart again.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Susan: Latte. Croissant. You look like hell.",

        "Ben: You were here all night?",
        "Paul: Yeah. She moved her hand. Twice.",
        "Ben: You mean like a twitch?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Ben: Yeah, that's normal.",
        "Paul: That's normal for what?",
        "Ben: There's no change, Paul. She's still comatose. I'm surprised her family hasn't been here.",
        "Paul: I didn't -- I didn't call them. It's just that, you know, they got Craig out of here. They rushed him out and then it was all about Rosanna. I didn't wanna call them, because I thought that she was gonna wake up. And if she did wake up, then it was a completely different phone call.",
        "Carly: My sister's been here all night fighting for her life and nobody bothered to pick up the phone?",
        "Jack: We're here now, Carly, okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, God. Oh, God. This is so wrong. How could this have happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I thought you'd never come.",
        "Margo: I wish.",
        "Craig: Been here all night. No arraignment. You knew that?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Craig: And you stayed away?",
        "Margo: This is a real tough day to be related to you, Craig. You know what kind of trouble you're in?",
        "Craig: This is a tough day for everybody, Margo. There are no charges and I'm still here.",
        "Margo: You think that's a good thing?",
        "Craig: What's the hold-up?",
        "Margo: Rosanna's statement.",
        "Craig: She's awake? Is she better? I have a right to know what she's accused me of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Ben says you might be able to hear me. So listen up. Paul says that Craig did this to you. And if that's true, I will make him pay. I swear it. But I need your help. So wake up. Wake up, Rosanna, and help me take that man down.",
        "Carly: We've come so far, Rosanna. Both of us. And we're not done yet. You always knew how to get exactly what you want. So all you have to do is want to wake up. And you will. And I'll be right here.",
        "Paul: Did you talk to Tom Hughes?",
        "Jack: Right after you called. I talked to Tom and Hal.",
        "Paul: Did they drop Montgomery down a hole?",
        "Jack: Not yet.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Jack: They're waiting on charges, Paul.",
        "Paul: I saw him try and kill Rosanna. I saw it with my own eyes. There were other witnesses. There's no way that guy should ever set foot outside of a jail. You can't let him get away with this, Jack.",
        "Carly: So now you're worried about Rosanna? Don't you think it's a little late for that, Paul? You should've saved her from Craig when you had the chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have a right to know what she's accused me of.",
        "Margo: Who said Rosanna accused you of anything, Craig?",
        "Craig: You don't look like she told you I was innocent.",
        "Margo: She didn't say anything. She's not awake yet.",
        "Craig: Is she better? What do the doctors say?",
        "Margo: They're waiting. Like I am.",
        "Craig: So no change? You're just working me.",
        "Margo: Look, I don't have the time or patience for your little dance here, Craig. You better come clean, or you're gonna see your sister walk out of here. You'll be left with nothing but the cop who wants to put you away for attempted murder.",
        "Craig: That's the charge?",
        "Margo: Unless Rosanna dies. Then it's murder two.",
        "Craig: But it was an accident, Margo! She ran off the road!",
        "Margo: You drove her off the road. There are eyewitnesses.",
        "Craig: Paul Ryan?",
        "Margo: His is a very compelling statement. He has witnesses to back him up. Look, if you've got another version of the story, you better come clean with it right now, Craig, or else you are looking at a long, long time in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Drink your coffee. It's the best medicine. You sleep here?",
        "Emily: I stayed here last night. Didn't sleep much. Paul didn't come home last night.",
        "Susan: He stay all night at the hospital?",
        "Emily: I guess so.",
        "Susan: I checked in before I came. There's no change in Rosanna's condition.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Susan: What did Paul tell you yesterday?",
        "Emily: Me?",
        "Susan: At the hospital. You saw him, right?",
        "Emily: Yeah. He didn't have much to say to me. But, boy, did he pour his heart out to Rosanna.",
        "Susan: Oh, honey.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, don't \"honey\" me, okay? Just say it.",
        "Susan: I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: No, you are not. You're thinking that this is exactly what I deserve. I'm an idiot for walking right into it.",
        "Susan: Paul is the idiot, not you.",
        "Emily: Oh, Mom.",
        "Susan: Not you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know what? I would've had more of a day planned for you, but I did not know you were coming until last night. Why didn't you call me sooner?",
        "Maddie: You know, it was one of those last minute airfares online. It was the only thing I could afford. But, I mean, hey, if I would've known you were driving around in limos, I would've hit you up for the fare.",
        "Henry: And you know I would do anything for you, sweetie. I just -- you didn't have to drop everything to come out here and check up on me. Especially with so much luggage.",
        "Maddie: Well, you never brought Katie to meet us, so I, you know, figured this was the only way.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's crazy busy today, though, unfortunately. So I think it's just gonna be you and me. Which I hope is okay? We can catch up.",
        "Maddie: Oh, yeah, yeah. This is off the hook. You and me in a limo.",
        "Henry: Is it everything you pictured?",
        "Maddie: Not exactly. Well, we know you play the stock market. So when we didn't hear from you in a while, you know, I was afraid that you got burned in one of those insider trading things.",
        "Henry: Oh, no, honey. No, no, no, no. I'm diversified. In fact, I've invested right here in Oakdale.",
        "Maddie: Trust you to have the town totally wired.",
        "Henry: Totally. Okay, first things first, though. Let's go have lunch at the local hot spot. What do you say?",
        "Maddie: Great. Let me just change.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: Change clothes.",
        "Henry: Well, you look fine.",
        "Maddie: I feel crumpled.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that look is in.",
        "Maddie: Well, let's just go to your place.",
        "Henry: We can't. It's being painted. [Maddie sneezes] And you're obviously very susceptible, so I think paint fumes are not -- bless you.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Henry: You know what? I think we should just go eat. Let's go eat.",
        "Maddie: A tissue? Do you have a tissue?",
        "Henry: Tissue? Yeah, right there.",
        "Moe: Hey, the track opens in a half hour, Coleman, so --",
        "Henry: Sir, your extra-curricular activities are not my concern. You're just expected to drive. Maddie, that's not the place -- no, no, the tissues are right underneath --",
        "Maddie: Yours? I did your laundry for three years, Henry, don't try to duck it.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: You got me. This is not what a kid sister should see. You know, I closed on a big deal yesterday. And we were having a big celebration, and I guess the party got a little bit wild in here.",
        "Maddie: You had time to floss?",
        "Henry: Yes. Oral hygiene is an important part of my life.",
        "Maddie: So is shaving --",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: And smelling good --",
        "Henry: Maddie -- Maddie, get out of there, will you? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.",
        "Maddie: Your checkbook? A racquetball? Socks. You live in this car, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm just gonna move tables. Thank you.",
        "Katie: Hi. Oh, I'll have what he's having.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Henry, we can do this the hard way or the easy way.",
        "Henry: Oh, whoa, listen to you, tough girl. I knew you when you wore ruffled socks. Remember that.",
        "Maddie: Henry, is this your car?",
        "Henry: Absolutely.",
        "Maddie: So, you're a limo driver?",
        "Henry: On occasion.",
        "Maddie: And this guy?",
        "Henry: That's Moe. He's a gaming associate.",
        "Maddie: How much are you into him for?",
        "Moe: $500.",
        "Maddie: You drew to an inside straight, didn't you? Always a bad move.",
        "Henry: All right, Moe, you can go.",
        "Moe: So --",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, we're even. Go, get out.",
        "Moe: Thanks.",
        "Maddie: Henry?",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Maddie: What are you doing here?",
        "Henry: This is just a temporary situation.",
        "Maddie: Did you and your wife get into a fight or --",
        "Henry: No, no, no, not exactly.",
        "Maddie: Not exactly a fight? Or not exactly -- I mean, is this your wife? Oh, no. It's not one of your sad Photoshop fantasies, is it?",
        "Henry: No, of course, not. Maddie, no. That's me, that's my wife, that was our wedding. And it was the greatest day of my life.",
        "Maddie: Only now you're living in a car.",
        "Henry: It's for a couple weeks, tops. It's just a cash flow problem. Bless you. And it has nothing to do with Katie.",
        "Maddie: Well, where does she live?",
        "Henry: Our house. Her house. I sent you the pictures.",
        "Maddie: So you split?",
        "Henry: We're still friends.",
        "Maddie: What happened?",
        "Henry: It's complicated, honey.",
        "Maddie: But you sounded like the perfect couple.",
        "Henry: We were. Except when we were married.",
        "Maddie: But why?",
        "Henry: Before Katie and me, there was this guy. Remember how Princess Di said that there were three people in her marriage?",
        "Maddie: Who was the third wheel?",
        "Henry: It's this guy named Mike Kasnoff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Mike: Is this okay?",
        "Katie: Of course.",
        "Mike: I can move.",
        "Katie: No. Mike, it would be weird if we couldn't sit together as friends.",
        "Mike: That's what I thought.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry about the service.",
        "Mike: You were fine.",
        "Katie: Dusty didn't think so.",
        "Mike: Did he get in your face?",
        "Katie: It was not a problem.",
        "Mike: What'd he say?",
        "Katie: Exactly what you would expect.",
        "Mike: Did he know you were leaving?",
        "Katie: I really don't think it mattered. Mike, people will think what they'll think.",
        "Mike: That's why I figured it wasn't good that you were there that day.",
        "Katie: I know. How was Jennifer?",
        "Mike: It's like she just wanted to turn to stone. She broke down during the service.",
        "Katie: Of course, she did.",
        "Mike: I could see how hard she was trying to protect herself from feeling anything.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure you were a big help.",
        "Mike: Not really.",
        "Katie: Don't say that. It may not feel like it --",
        "Mike: She moved out.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: That day, she moved out. She didn't want to come home with me, not even for a little while. Not ever.",
        "Katie: So, what does that mean?",
        "Mike: That she doesn't want help if it's coming from me. She shut me out.",
        "Katie: Oh, Mike.",
        "Mike: So, I'm officially useless.",
        "Katie: Don't say that. Would you stop it?",
        "Nancy: Katie's right, you know. Mike, the loss that you and Jennifer have had is something that would make anyone feel helpless. But it's not true. You and Jen hold on to each other. Your love will get you through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: It's not like we were madly in love with each other, you know? We knew better. We as much said it to each other's faces. I knew he still had feelings for Rosanna. Obviously, I still care about Hal. But -- but we were moving on, you know? We were being mature and realistic. So I thought.",
        "Susan: What did he say?",
        "Emily: Everything. Everything I have ever wanted to hear from the man I love. That is what he said. To Rosanna. And then, ol' mature me curled up into a ball and started crying like a baby. He will never love me like that. No man will ever love me like that.",
        "Susan: Hal did.",
        "Emily: No, he didn't. He could say the words -- everything in his life came first. Paul means it, mom. He means it. He will stay there by her side until she wakes up. And when she does, he will never leave her again.",
        "Susan: He said that?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Susan: Well, sweetie. Then there's only one thing to do. Pack your bags and come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right, Craig, you want me to ask you the questions? I'll ask you the questions. Here we go. Why were you chasing Rosanna's car?",
        "Craig: I was following her.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Craig: She was upset. She shouldn't have been driving.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Craig: We'd fought.",
        "Margo: That's not what you told Hal last night.",
        "Craig: Well, Hal was looking to hang me.",
        "Margo: You told him that you and Rosanna were going to see the baby that you were going to adopt. So I guess that wasn't true either?",
        "Craig: Well, I thought she was going to the hospital. And we could meet, we could work it out. And I was trying to make it up to her.",
        "Margo: What for? Why were you fighting?",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Rosanna: The baby. The baby that we just held in the hospital. That's not Gwen's baby. That little boy is Jennifer's child.",
        "Craig: And how is that possible?",
        "Rosanna: Craig, you switched the babies.",
        "Margo: What had you done, Craig? I mean, that must've been a hell of a fight.",
        "Craig: It was.",
        "Margo: About?",
        "Craig: She worries that I can't love this baby as my own, and I wasn't as understanding as I might have been. And she went beside herself. She started to feel faint and dizzy, so I went to get her a glass of water, and when I came back, she had just taken off. She shouldn't have been driving, Margo. She was all over the road.",
        "Margo: Yes, to evade you.",
        "Craig: Well, I called her. I tried to get her to calm down, to stop. But she wouldn't listen to any reason, okay? So I pulled my car up next to hers, all right?",
        "Margo: What, just to give her a little wave?",
        "Craig: In a way, yes. [Craig remembering] Rosanna! Pull over, will you? You're gonna get us both killed, here. If you don't stop the car, I'm gonna have to make you.",
        "[Rosanna screaming]",
        "Margo: Your car just kind of gave her a little pat? Maybe just a little nudge, something like that, at 60 miles an hour, accidentally on purpose?",
        "Craig: I know! I know, it was crazy, but what could I do, Margo? All right, our cars were swerving. They bounced. It happened so fast! I don't know, it was an accident, Margo! It was a horrible accident.",
        "Margo: Wow, Craig, that story fills in all the gaps, doesn't it? Maybe it took you all night to come up with that, huh?",
        "Craig: Margo, why would I want Rosanna dead? We loved each other. She gave me a second chance.",
        "Margo: Yeah, who hasn't? And who hasn't lived to regret it?",
        "Craig: Margo, we had a new baby together. I had everything I wanted. I'd give anything to go back. Anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You could've stopped her.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Carly: When Rosanna married Craig. I begged her not to do it, but she wouldn't listen to me. The only person that she would've listened to was you.",
        "Paul: You don't know that.",
        "Carly: No, you're right. I don't. Because you never even bothered to show up when I called. If you still cared so much, where were you? All right, so I was a little harsh. Why can't I just shut up?",
        "Jack: You're scared.",
        "Carly: Rosanna's it, Jack. She's the only family member I have left. I can't lose her.",
        "Nurse Bently: Excuse me? Are you Rosanna Cabot's next of kin?",
        "Carly: I'm her sister.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm sorry about the accident. This must be a terrible time for you.",
        "Carly: It is.",
        "Nurse Bently: If you can just tell me what to do about the baby, I'll be out of your hair.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Nurse Bently: He's ready to leave the hospital.",
        "Jack: What baby?",
        "Nurse Bently: The child Mr. And Mrs. Montgomery are adopting.",
        "Carly: He's here?",
        "Nurse Bently: He was born prematurely several days ago.",
        "Carly: Is he all right?",
        "Nurse Bently: Oh, he's doing fine. We were going to send him home today.",
        "Jack: Did you know about this?",
        "Carly: Not that he was born, no.",
        "Jack: You know, given the charges against Mr. Montgomery, I think it's best if you guys keep the baby.",
        "Carly: Unless we take him.",
