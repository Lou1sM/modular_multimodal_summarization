Well, you can call them, and they can explain to \r\nyou in simple legal terms that you don't have a legal leg to stand on, let alone \r\nan overpriced penthouse to squat in. You know what? Here. Use my phone. I want \r\nto see the look on your face when they tell you that you have to leave. You just \r\npush that button right there.",

So, anyway, I'm \r\nspeeding along, and suddenly, out of nowhere, there's a dog in the middle of the \r\nroad. [Susan gasps] well, I know that it sounds sort of foolish under the \r\ncircumstances, but, you know, I just couldn't bear the thought of hurting that \r\npoor creature, so I swerved to miss him. The dog is fine. He went off into the \r\nwoods. But me? No. I'm in the ditch with two flat tires.",
