        "Margo: All right, listen up. This won't take long. I know that you're all anxious to get back out to that river and find Jack. And Starziak. He's already taken out one of our cops. Let's make sure that he doesn't hurt anybody else. Starziak is considered armed and dangerous. But we do want him brought in alive, so be careful. And as for Detective Snyder -- this is still considered a rescue mission. And yes, I know he's been out there a long time, and I know that that water is cold. But you all know better than anyone else that he is an intelligent man, and he is a stubborn man. He's just too plain pigheaded to die, so you go out there and you give it 200% 'cause he wouldn't give anything less for any one of you. He's out there. He's alive. I want you to bring him back. Go. Can I tell you how bad this coffee is?",
        "Cop: I'll start a new pot. Maybe you can take a break when the Lieutenant gets back.",
        "Margo: When Jack's home.",
        "Cop: I thought you might be worried about your husband, you know, with everything that's going on with him.",
        "Margo: What? What about my husband, what? What's going on?",
        "Cop: I -- I thought you knew.",
        "Margo: What? Knew what?",
        "Cop: About what happened with him and Doc Reese.",
        "Curtis: Jessica! That was your office on the phone. You're never going to believe this.",
        "Cop: It seems your husband and Doc Reese got into a fist fight at the Lakeview last night, and --",
        "Margo: And?",
        "Curtis: And now they're both in jail!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: Any message for your wife, sir?",
        "Tom: Nothing, thanks.",
        "Doc: Oh, ho, ho. So you can talk, huh? You were so quiet when they brought us in last night, I thought you might have broken your jaw when you pounced on me after that sucker punch.",
        "Tom: You're lucky that's all I did.",
        "Doc: Being locked up all night for something I didn't do is not my idea of luck.",
        "Tom: You know what, none of this would've happened if you'd had the decency to keep your hands off my wife!",
        "Doc: Oh, la de da. You know what? You need to get a new song and dance, man, because that one's getting real old.",
        "Margo: Tom? Tom, oh, my God. What happened?",
        "Tom: Why don't you ask him, your lover?",
        "Margo: Nothing ever happened, Tom. I am not the one who made love to Doc Reese!",
        "Tom: You're not \"the one\"? And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Margo: It means that --",
        "Jessica: Margo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: There you are. Thank you so much for rushing right on over. Now listen, I've already looked at the menu. They've got some wonderful specials. What do you feel like eating? You look beautiful.",
        "Paul: Mom, what's the crisis?",
        "Jennifer: It sounded urgent.",
        "Barbara: It is.",
        "[Barbara remembering]",
        "Barbara: So you want me to create a distraction?",
        "Rosanna: Something that will pry Jennifer away from Jordan long enough --",
        "Barbara: To consummate your marriage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: There is something that I haven't -- I haven't told you. Something important. And it would be wrong to keep it from you any longer. I just hope you have it in your heart to understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Too many teeth. Okay, think Mother Teresa meets Mandy Moore on a good day. You are serene, you are innocent, you are perfection. Perfection! [Alison sighs] it's a pleasure to meet you your most excellent Reverendness. My fianc\u00e9, Christopher, has told me so much about you. And having you marry us would just -- [doorbell] oh. Okay, one word. First impression. What do you think?",
        "Aaron: Wow. You look incredible.",
        "Alison: You think so?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, who are you supposed to be in that get up?",
        "Alison: It's not a get up! And I'm totally being myself.",
        "[Aaron scoffs]",
        "Aaron: Yourself? I've seen yourself, and that ain't it.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm meeting the minister who's going to marry me and Chris.",
        "Aaron: Oh, well, in that case, you're gonna want my honest opinion. Ali, you look like you're going up for parole or something.",
        "Alison: Be nice. I need to make the right impression. Because if I don't, then, he's like bound by God or something to tell Chris he's making a huge mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: We gotta make sure this is all over the morning news. Every boater on the lake is to be alerted, any scouts in the area. Everybody is to be on the lookout for Jack.",
        "Nikki: And Starziak.",
        "Hal: Alert all neighboring counties, see if they can get any volunteers to --",
        "Emily: Hal? Hi, honey. I haven't seen you since last night.",
        "Hal: Honey, we've been kinda busy around here.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know, I just thought I'd bring you some decent coffee, maybe you could take a little break. Any luck finding Jack or that maniac?",
        "Hal: No, no, nothing yet. Emily, why don't you go see Carly? I'm sure she could use the company.",
        "Emily: No, she's okay. She's all right. Rosanna and Emma stayed with here the night. I thought I'd come here. If there's anything I can do to help --",
        "Hal: There's nothing here for you to do, Emily! Just go home. Just go home, say a prayer for Carly and Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. Wake up, sleepy head. Are you going to sleep the day away? It's a beautiful day out there.",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: Morning, beautiful.",
        "Carly: You're back? I knew you'd come back. I was so worried about you. Where have you been?",
        "Jack: I'm right where you left me, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm right where you left me.",
        "Carly: You're so cold -- and you're so wet. I'll get you some blankets and a cup of tea. And you'll be good as new --",
        "Jack: It's too late, Carly.",
        "Carly: No. Don't say that.",
        "Jack: It's too late. I'm dead. [Carly gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Listen, man. All Margo's trying to say, for the millionth time in the millionth way so you get it through that thick head of yours, is that she and I were never together in the way you think. It never happened.",
        "Margo: Never. Never, Tom.",
        "Jessica: Tom, you have to believe her. Margo would never --",
        "Margo: Would you just stay out of this!",
        "Jessica: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Margo: Help? I don't need your help, I don't want your help. All I need is Tom. All I need is my husband.",
        "Tom: But I don't need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Emily? Look, I hope Dad didn't hurt your feelings. He's been up all night. There's no sign of Jack, and he's frustrated. That's how he gets when he's on the job.",
        "Emily: Thank you Nikki, for explaining my husband to me. I really appreciate it. What would I do without you?",
        "Nikki: I was just trying to --",
        "Emily: Aren't you leaving town? When do you go back to D.C., anyway?",
        "Nikki: I was --",
        "Hal: Nikki, get in here! I need you!",
        "Nikki: Look, I'm sorry. I gotta go. We'll talk later. I'm coming.",
        "Emily: I can hardly wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: What is all this?",
        "Alison: Emily picked up a bunch of \"marriage for dummies\" books and brochures for me at the church.",
        "Aaron: And you're supposed to --",
        "Alison: Read it. Learn it. Live it.",
        "Aaron: And that'll make you a better spouse?",
        "Alison: Well, they teach you all kinds of stuff. How marriage is a serious step. How it's forever and they give you all kinds of things to contemplate. Soul-searching.",
        "Aaron: Hmm. Like what?",
        "Alison: Like, how you're not supposed to get married until you know everything that there is to know about the guy, or whoever. And they tell you that you should know their high points, their low points, their true character, you know? And you should be able to tell if you can really trust them. If they're honest, or they're gonna be the someone who is going to lie about everything under the sun and then put your marriage in jeopardy.",
        "Aaron: Is there a chapter in there that tells whether or not he's in love with you? If he's like the right guy for you? Or --",
        "Alison: I already know the answers to all of those questions.",
        "Aaron: Really? You sure about that?",
        "Alison: Okay, Aaron. I know that Chris and I, we had a rocky past, and I wasn't always honest.",
        "Aaron: You weren't honest because you didn't trust him, Alison. You were afraid that Chris would find out the real Ali, and he'd dump you.",
        "Alison: That's the point! I mean, that's the past. I've changed. I'm different now. Okay? If I was a guy, I'd marry me. And the minister who's gonna do the ceremony, he's a friend of the Hugheses. And he just came back to Oakdale a couple months ago.",
        "Aaron: So that's what's got you looking like a Stepford fianc\u00e9?",
        "Alison: I do not! I'm just a little worried, okay? I mean, what if he asks me all kinds of questions? Or he hears stories from Kim? Or he refuses to marry us!",
        "Aaron: No, he's not, Alison.",
        "Alison: Well, what if? What if he thinks I'm not good enough for Chris? What if Chris starts wondering why he ever liked me in the first place?",
        "Aaron: Alison, you're gonna drive yourself crazy.",
        "Alison: You know how preoccupied Chris has been lately. What if he gets cold feet?",
        "Aaron: Alison, if you're that worried that Chris is gonna change his mind, then don't marry the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Carly? Sweetie, what happened? Are you all right?",
        "Carly: It was Jack. He was here.",
        "Rosanna: No, sweetheart. No, no, that was a dream. It was just a dream.",
        "Carly: No. No, it was real. God, it was so real.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, honey, come on now. It was a dream. Can you tell me what it was about?",
        "Carly: It was Jack. He was dead. He told me he was dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I don't mean to be an alarmist here, but there's no easy way to say this --",
        "Jennifer: Mom, what is it?",
        "Barbara: I've been having headaches again. Some trouble with my vision.",
        "Paul: What kind of trouble?",
        "Barbara: Things have been getting blurry. Some of the old symptoms have come back.",
        "Jennifer: What does it mean?",
        "Barbara: Well, it could be one of two things. It could be a post-operative side effect. In which case, if it is, there's nothing to worry about and the symptoms will go away by themselves, but -- or --",
        "Paul: Or what? Mom, what? Just say it.",
        "Barbara: Or it could be a sign of a tumor. Maybe they didn't get all the growth when they went in.",
        "Jennifer: But -- but, how do you feel?",
        "Barbara: Well, aside from my vision, I feel fine.",
        "Paul: What does Walker have to say about all this?",
        "Barbara: I haven't told him.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Barbara: Well, because our relationship has changed since he was on the case before, and I don't know I feel about telling him because the feelings we have for each other are so new. Besides, I was given the name of a specialist in case the symptoms returned. He's in New York.",
        "Jennifer: Who is he? What's his name?",
        "Barbara: He's the top of his field. He's used to handling situations like this after surgery. And I can see him. He can run all the tests, let me know the results. And besides -- you know what we went through the last time, when I didn't tell you about the blindness. And I just wanted to tell both of you now.",
        "Jennifer: New York?",
        "Paul: When are you leaving?",
        "Barbara: Well, that brings me to the other reason I wanted to talk to you. I want you both to come with me. I know it's a lot to ask --",
        "Jordan: Whatever she wants, just say no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Tom, there's something that you need to know.",
        "Jessica: Margo, please. Not here.",
        "Tom: Not anywhere. There's nothing you have to say that I'm interested in hearing.",
        "Margo: You don't mean that.",
        "Tom: Unlike you, I mean what I say. The truth, Margo? I'm done.",
        "Cop: Tom Hughes, you're a free man.",
        "Doc: He's free?",
        "Cop: On your own recognizance, by order of the judge.",
        "Tom: Thanks a lot.",
        "Doc: But he's the one who started this whole mess. I was sitting there, signing an autograph, minding my own business. Now what about me? When do I get out of here?",
        "Margo: Honey, don't you think that we need to talk?",
        "Tom: Yeah, we will. Soon as I calm down. We have to decide where we're gonna send my things. And how to explain to Casey how his life will never be the same.",
        "Jessica: Tom -- Tom, wait.",
        "Tom: Look, I'm tired. I want to get back to my suite, take a shower, and forget about this.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I know. But just don't do anything, don't decide anything until you hear what I have to say.",
        "Tom: Let's hear it.",
        "Jessica: Not here, okay? Somewhere private. Would you come with me?",
        "Doc: Margo? Margo, listen. I know you're angry. I know you feel like you're paying for Jessica's sins. But it's not your secret to tell. And if you want to do the right thing, don't ever tell anybody what really happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Tell me you that you did not just say what you just said. Not marry Chris?",
        "Aaron: All right, Alison. I'm sorry. That came out wrong, okay?",
        "Alison: I invited you here to calm me down, not freak me out.",
        "Aaron: Look, we're friends, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, that was the idea.",
        "Aaron: Well listen. As best friends --",
        "Alison: Friends. Best friends. That means that you're supposed to know me better than anybody else.",
        "Aaron: Yes, better than everybody else.",
        "Alison: You're supposed to know what I'm scared of, you're supposed to know what makes me laugh. You're supposed to know my secrets, my dreams --",
        "Aaron: Yes, yes. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Aaron, marrying Chris, that means everything to me. You're supposed to be in my corner. You're supposed to be supportive.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I am. And that's why I'm telling you -- look, all I'm saying is maybe you should take a little more time on this --",
        "Alison: I don't know what I thought talking to you would help.",
        "Aaron: I just want you to be happy, Alison.",
        "Alison: I am happy! I'm ecstatic! Can't you tell?",
        "Aaron: This is what you call happy? Are you serious?",
        "Alison: I'm just -- this is the most important time in my life. It's supposed to be perfect. And all those brochures and the booklets, they just -- they just threw me a little, that's all. That's all.",
        "Aaron: You're sure that's all?",
        "Alison: When I'm with Chris, I'm -- oh, the minister! I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!",
        "Aaron: Am I just gonna stay here?",
        "Alison: Just close the door. Wish me luck! Wish me luck!",
        "Aaron: Luck.",

        "Chris: Hi.",
        "Emily: Hi. Am I early?",
        "Chris: Actually, you're right on time.",
        "Emily: Oh. So, where is everybody?",
        "Chris: I was told that Reverend Elkins had an emergency with one of his congregation. He should be here any minute.",
        "Emily: Okay. And Alison?",
        "Chris: Who knows?",
        "Emily: It's quiet. It's always weird, being in a church when there's no service going on, isn't it? It's like you're being singled out for judgment or something.",
        "Chris: I didn't realize you were gonna be here today.",
        "Emily: Oh, Alison demanded my presence. You know, for moral support. It's okay. It's worth taking my mind off of other things.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I heard about Jack. I know how close you are with him and Carly. I'm really sorry.",
        "Emily: I just wish there was something I can do, you know? All I seem to do is get in the way.",
        "Chris: Come on. You, in the way? That's pretty hard to imagine.",
        "Emily: Well, imagine it. Really, I just came from the police station and -- will you listen to me? I'm complaining about feeling left out when my best friend's the one who's really suffering. So now you know how petty I can really be.",
        "Chris: Come on. You, petty? Never. I mean, you're an amazing person. You're smart, attractive -- anyway, I'm sure it wasn't you --",
        "[Reverend clears throat]",
        "Chris: Reverend Elkins.",

        "Chris: Yes, good to see you. I'd like to introduce you to --",
        "Reverend: Oh, you don't have to tell me. You must be Alison. I must say, the two of you look very much in love.",

        "Rosanna: It was a dream. Your brain is on overload.",
        "Carly: No, no. He was here.",
        "Rosanna: What you saw was what you are afraid of happening. Your mind is playing tricks on you.",
        "Carly: No, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Sweetie, why don't you try to get some rest?",
        "Carly: I can't. You know, I'm gonna go and do something. Anything -- before it's too late.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean? Where are you going to go?",
        "Carly: The police station. I'm gonna see how the search is going.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, let's do that. And I'll drive you.",
        "Carly: No. Please, just stay here with Parker and Sage, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Emma's upstairs with Parker and Sage. I will take you.",

        "Rosanna: Hi. Good morning to you, too, Parker.",
        "Parker: Where's Mommy?",
        "Rosanna: Mommy just went out to run some errands. She'll be back very soon. Do you want some breakfast?",
        "Parker: Where's Jack?",
        "Rosanna: Jack isn't home yet.",
        "Parker: But I heard him. He was calling for Mommy.",
        "Rosanna: When?",
        "Parker: Last night. He was calling her name. Over and over again, like he needed her. All night. But then it stopped.",

        "Hal: What've you got?",
        "Nikki: They pulled it from the river, it's been examined, and they found blood.",
        "Hal: All right, get it go the lab --",
        "Nikki: The lab is already analyzing it. They're trying to determine whether or not it's Jack's or Starziak's. I told them it was top priority.",
        "Hal: Good work. Well, I guess you need to take a break.",
        "Nikki: I'm fine. What do you need next? Tell me where do you need me.",
        "Hal: Right here. I don't know what I would've done without you these last few days, Nik.",
        "Nikki: I just, I wish there was more I could do.",
        "Hal: Oh, there is, trust me. I mean, even on a good day around here, we're short staffed, and with Kane gone and Jack missing.",
        "Nikki: Look, I do whatever I can for as long as I can. You know that.",
        "Hal: You mean it?",
        "Nikki: Are you kidding? These past few weeks here in Oakdale have been terrific. I just wish I could stay longer.",
        "Hal: Are you kidding me? You'd be bored in a week.",
        "Nikki: Hardly. I'm finally having a chance to do what I've always wanted.",
        "Hal: You wouldn't miss D.C.?",
        "Nikki: The bureaucracy? Sitting behind a desk all day? Hoping that maybe they'll give me another chance on a big case? Not quite.",
        "Hal: What would you say if I told you that I called D.C. and I told the IRS that you might be interested in a leave of absence?",
        "Nikki: You what?",
        "Hal: I just said \"what if.\"",
        "Nikki: Okay, that depends on what would I be doing during that leave of absence.",
        "Hal: You'd be working for me. With me. I sure could use the help, Nikki. We could use the help on an official basis. It would be a godsend to have you on this force.",

        "Hal: Say yes.",
        "Nikki: Yes. I'll do it.",
