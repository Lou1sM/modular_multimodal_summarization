        "Audrey: No kiss? No little hug for your long-lost mother?",
        "Henry: I was expecting someone else.",
        "Audrey: Oh, well, I know it's a big surprise, but, you know, I did -- I did sort of give you a little hint, you know?",
        "Henry: Yeah? What hint is that?",
        "Audrey: Well, that -- that big, fat floral one right here.",
        "Henry: That's -- that's from you?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, and they're -- gorgeous, aren't they? I -- I mean, they're even prettier than I thought they would be. I mean, they cost me a pretty penny, I tell you.",
        "Henry: You shouldn't -- you shouldn't have.",
        "Audrey: Well, I just thought it would be a nice gesture, because I knew you probably didn't think you'd ever, ever see me again.",
        "Henry: Frankly, I was counting on it.",
        "Audrey: Ouch.",
        "Henry: No! No. Don't \"Ouch\" me. Why are you here, and when are you leaving?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, did you really mean it when you said you would take care of me in every way?",
        "Brad: Yeah, of course I did. What do you want? You want a sandwich, a soda, a foot massage?",
        "Katie: You're getting warmer with the massage idea.",
        "Brad: Okay, well, my -- my magic fingers are at your disposal.",
        "Katie: Why don't we go into the bedroom and let your magic fingers really go to work?",
        "Brad: No. No. No way. Come on. You know, you're pregnant.",
        "Katie: I know, and what I'd like is a refresher course on how I got that way.",
        "Brad: Well, the doctor said that this is a risky pregnancy, so no getting frisky when it's risky.",
        "Katie: Well, you know, I actually had a very specific discussion with our doctor today.",
        "Brad: And?",
        "Katie: And he said the baby is strong enough for a little parental friskiness.",
        "Brad: You don't have to tell me twice!",
        "[Chuckling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey. I wasn't expecting you out here today.",
        "Sage: Is my dad here?",
        "Janet: Uh, no. He was on his way to your house.",
        "Sage: Oh, I must have missed him.",
        "Janet: Well, how about you hang out and wait for him? I'm sure he'll be right back. And I have the late dinner shift at Al's tonight, so you and your dad can have the evening all to yourselves. I've made enough penne to feed an army.",
        "Sage: No, thanks.",
        "Janet: Um, all right. Well, I could whip you up a burger if you'd like?",
        "Sage: It's okay. I'm not hungry.",
        "Janet: Even for one of Emma's famous chocolate-chip cookies? Huh? I know they're your favorite.",
        "Sage: No, thanks. I'm good.",
        "Janet: Sage? Well, you sure are wrapped up in that computer.",
        "Sage: I sent an e-mail to my friend Teri from Chicago. I thought she might have answered, but she didn't.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, I wouldn't worry too much about it if I were you. I'm sure she just got really busy. She'll e-mail you back as soon as she can.",
        "Sage: I want to call my mom. Can I reach her from here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Jack!",
        "Craig: Before you start, I'm here solely on business. Her royal Cabotness --",
        "Jack: I'm actually glad you're here, Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that can't be good.",
        "Jack: Parker told me about your little trip to Chicago.",
        "Craig: Well, then he must have told you what a good time he and Sage had.",
        "Jack: Whether they had a good time is not the point. I thought I made it clear that my kids are not to go any place without my okay. Or did that slip both your minds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Um, I don't think your mom is allowed to receive calls in the place she's -- she's in.",
        "Sage: \"The place she's in\"? Is it a jail or something?",
        "Janet: No, no, it's not jail. No, baby. It's, um, it's like a hospital.",
        "Sage: But you're allowed to get phone calls at a hospital.",
        "Janet: This is a special hospital, and your mom really needs to focus on getting better right now.",
        "Sage: I bet you anything that talking to me will make her feel a lot better, so can I have the number, please?",
        "Janet: I think it would be better if you wait for your father to get home.",
        "Sage: You just don't want me to call my mom!",
        "Janet: No, Sweetheart, that is not true. It's not true at all. I -- I just -- I want you to wait for your dad, okay?",
        "Sage: That is true. That's why you won't give me the number.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, these are not my rules. These are the rules of the place where she's at.",
        "Sage: She left when I went to camp, and I never got to say good-bye. At least let me call her just to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, Jack. I didn't take the kids away to Chicago on purpose. Craig needed me to help close a business deal, and I went because I needed to protect Carly's business interests.",
        "Jack: Oh, believe me, I understand that.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's good. The kids were well supervised, absolutely fantastically taken care of, and they had an amazing lunch at a wonderful restaurant.",
        "Craig: Sage even hit it off with one of the waitresses. I honestly don't understand why you're so upset.",
        "Jack: That doesn't surprise me, but you do, Rosanna. Now, I know that Carly asked you to live here and look after the kids as a favor to her, and don't think I don't appreciate that. But you took my kids out of town with the man who tried to kill you. Do you honestly not see why I'd have a problem with that?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I -- I do. I absolutely understand. But it -- it really was a business emergency.",
        "Jack: Unless it's a medical emergency, my kids don't take a step out of this house without me knowing first. Is that clear?",
        "Rosanna: Absolutely, perfectly.",
        "Jack: Great.",
        "Craig: Well, if you really want to know why your sister started drinking, look no further than the man who just walked out that door.",
        "Rosanna: Why don't I just take a look at the man standing in front of me? Carly was with Jack for years and she had no problem. She was with you for, what? A couple of months, and your little vodka business, and suddenly she's a full-fledged alcoholic.",
        "Craig: Hey, I may have helped with the how, but Jack Snyder gets full credit as to the why. Divorcing Carly and marrying Janet put more drinks in her hands than I ever could.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you -- you could be right. I said \"Could be.\"",
        "Craig: Well, thank you for the acknowledgement, halfhearted as it was.",
        "Rosanna: Don't push it, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, you have to admit, Jack is pretty relentless.",
        "Rosanna: You want to talk about relentless? Why don't you look up the word in the dictionary? You'll see a picture of you.",
        "Craig: Oh, yes, but it's a good picture.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me. Don't touch anything. Hi, can I help you?",
        "Postman: I need a signature.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, sure. Um, oh, great. Okay. There you go.",
        "Postman: Here you go. Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you very much. It's from Carly.",
        "Craig: Oh, great. I was waiting to hear from her.",
        "Rosanna: It's for Sage.",
        "Craig: Well, of course it is. They didn't have a chance to say good-bye before Carly went to rehab, so it makes sense she would write her before me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you're expecting a letter from Carly?",
        "Craig: She wrote to Sage. I'm sure she'll write to me.",
        "Rosanna: Don't put money on it, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: How could I not come to see you, Henry, after I saw my baby boy on TV and in a -- a dress, no less. You know, for a minute there, I thought maybe I had another daughter I didn't even know about.",
        "Henry: Oh, God. The humiliation never ends.",
        "Audrey: Hey, isn't there maybe something you want to tell me? You know, something that you've had hidden deep down, buried for a very long time? I'm here. I'm here.",
        "Henry: Me wearing a dress was a strategic maneuver, okay? It was tactical. That's it.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Okey-dokey. Whatever you say. I just want you to know that my heart and my arms are always wide open.",
        "Henry: I'm sure there are many men who can vouch for that. So, you're here out of the blue, showing up to help. What's that about, I wonder?",
        "Audrey: Uh, because I wanted you to know that I would always be here for you.",
        "Henry: Only when you want something.",
        "Audrey: How in the world did I ever raise such a cynic?",
        "Henry: That's a trick question, because you didn't raise me, and I remember going to sleep and kissing the TV good night.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Okay. I get it. I'm the mother. I am the mother, and so this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna say it first. Here I go. Henry, I forgive you.",
        "[Henry exhales sharply]",
        "Henry: You -- I'm sorry. What? You forgive me? Have you forgotten that you're the one that walked out and let me raise your own children? Have you forgotten that?",
        "Audrey: You know, I am not here to rehash ancient history. I am here to forgive and forget.",
        "Henry: What's his name, and why did he kick you out?",
        "Audrey: It was completely mutual, and we both knew that we were headed in different directions. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. You, uh, you really truly have made something of yourself, haven't you?",
        "Henry: No thanks to you.",
        "Audrey: This is just such a beautiful room. You know, is this a California king?",
        "Henry: No, lady, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. This town isn't big enough for the two of us, and this room isn't, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay. Are you -- are you sure you're good to go?",
        "Katie: I'm positive. I've been waiting a long time for this.",
        "Brad: Me too. Candles. I almost forgot the candles.",
        "Katie: Oh, we don't need candles. We just need this.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Brad: Okay. Rule number one -- you turn off the ringer. You forgot that.",
        "Katie: I know. It's been so long. I forgot.",
        "Brad: Okay, just ignore it. Let the machine get it. Hey, you've reached the Peretti-Snyder residence. You know the drill.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Henry: Hello? Brad, Katie, is anyone there? Something terrible has happened. You have to help me. Call me back as soon as you get this message.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Katie: He sounds so desperate.",
        "Brad: No. You want to see desperate? Desperate husband right here.",
        "Katie: I know. Brad -- Brad --",
        "[Brad sighs]",
        "Brad: Okay. All right. Just make it quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Sit down for a second. I am sure that your mother would have said good- bye if she could have, but she didn't want to bother you at camp. She knew how much you were looking forward to the Bluebird brigade thingy and --",
        "Sage: It wasn't even fun. And if she told me where she was going, I would have come home sooner and she might not have had to go in the first place.",
        "Janet: It doesn't work like that, Sweetie.",
        "Sage: You don't know her the way I do. I'm sure she wants to talk to me just as much as I want to talk to her.",
        "Janet: And I'm sure that is true. But please do me a favor and wait for your dad.",
        "Sage: Fine. I'm going to watch TV until he gets here.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Janet: Oh. Hey.",
        "Rosanna: Hello. Hi.",
        "Janet: Come on in. What's up?",
        "Rosanna: I have a letter for Sage. It's from Carly.",
        "Janet: She wrote a letter from rehab?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. It arrived, though, after Jack left, so I thought I'd bring it over as soon as possible, 'cause I know Sage really wants to be hearing from her mom.",
        "Janet: I don't think you should give it to her right now.",
        "Rosanna: You know, Janet, with all due respect, I know you're Jack's wife, but you really don't get a say in how and when Carly communicates with her children.",
        "Janet: Why does everybody think I'm trying to keep Carly away from her kids? I'm not trying to do that. I'm not the bad guy here, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry. Listen, it's just -- what I meant to say was I think that you should wait and give it to Jack. Wait for Jack to get home. Then he can decide whether he should give it to Sage or not.",
        "Rosanna: Sage doesn't need a buffer. Carly would never write anything in a letter that would hurt her children.",
        "Janet: I know that -- not when she's got it together. But who knows what kind of a state of mind she is in and if she is still detoxing? Who knows what she wrote down on paper?",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Janet: Why don't you hang out and give it to Jack yourself.",
        "Rosanna: No. No, thank you. Uh, Craig and I were doing some business, and I don't want to leave him at the house any longer than absolutely necessary.",
        "Janet: Yeah. Point taken. I'll make sure he gets this.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "[Janet lays the letter on the counter by the cookie jar]",
        "Janet: Oh. I got to get ready for work.",
        "Sage: Dad, is that you?",
        "[Sage goes gets a cookie and sees the letter and picks it up and opens it up and leaves]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, I guess it was too much to hope for that you'd be gone by the time I got back.",
        "Craig: Nothing would make me happier, and yet I remain planted on your sofa because you won't let me do anything because you want to micromanage everything.",
        "Rosanna: I am protecting Carly's interests. That's not called micromanaging. That's called taking responsibility -- something you've managed to avoid for most of your life.",
        "Craig: If you really want to protect your sister's interests, you'd trust me to do what's best for her.",
        "Rosanna: Trust and you are two words that don't really go together very well, Craig. So why don't you sit your butt down, and let's see what you've messed up this time, huh?",
        "Craig: You got it, boss.",
        "Rosanna: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Craig: I'm going to get a cup of coffee. I think I'm gonna need it.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, this is not your house. You don't get to do whatever you want just because you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Bubbles, thank you for getting back to me so soon.",
        "Katie: What's going on?",
        "Henry: You remember how I thought that Vienna was coming home?",
        "Katie: Yeah. She sent you flowers.",
        "Henry: I was wrong. They're not from her.",
        "Katie: Who are they from?",
        "Henry: They're from my mother, and she's here now.",
        "Katie: So?",
        "Henry: Maybe you don't hear. She's here. Here, here, here, like in my hotel room.",
        "Katie: Um, that's it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's more than enough, Sweetheart, okay?",
        "Katie: Well, she wouldn't be the first mother to pay a surprise visit to one of her children. That's what mothers do. And it certainly does not qualify as an emergency, especially right when Brad and I were about to finally -- finally --",
        "Henry: Well, finally what?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Brad: Nothing?",
        "Henry: What should I do with her?",
        "Katie: She's your mother. You're asking me? I don't know. What does she like to do?",
        "Henry: She likes to run off with strange men and make my life a living hell and not necessarily in that order.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'm hanging up now.",
        "Henry: Katie, please don't. No, no, no. Please, please. I need help. I cannot be left alone with this woman.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Henry: Maybe you didn't hear me the first two times. This is my mother we're talking about.",
        "Katie: Well, you never really talk about her. I've never met her.",
        "Henry: That is because God has been very kind to you.",
        "Katie: Okay. Why don't you two come over for dinner?",
        "Henry: You cannot be serious!",
        "Katie: Well, now you've really got me curious.",
        "Henry: Our friendship has been through a lot in the last couple of months, and I think my mother may be the straw the breaks the camel's back.",
        "Katie: Now I really have to meet her. Come over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Well, thank God you're home.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I stopped by the station on the way back from Carly's. What's going on?",
        "Janet: Well, we had a couple visitors while you were gone, one of them being Sage. She's okay. She's watching TV.",
        "Jack: What happened?",
        "Janet: She wants to call her mother. I told her that she should wait until you got home.",
        "Jack: I know that sooner or later she'd want to get in contact with her mom. The two of them are so close. The separation's got to be killing them.",
        "Janet: Well, I know it's killing Carly. She managed to send a letter to Sage from rehab. Rosanna just brought it by.",
        "Jack: Rosanna didn't give it to her, did she? I'd like to see what's in it.",
        "Janet: No, no. I told Rosanna to give it to me so that I could give it to you and you could decide whether or not Sage should read it.",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you. You did exactly the right thing. This step mom thing is growing on you. So, where's the letter?",
        "Janet: It's right here. Uh, it's --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: It's not here. What if Sage found it while I was upstairs?",
        "Jack: One way to find out. Sage!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I can't believe you missed this.",
        "Craig: Oh, that? That's because it's completely irrelevant.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's not. You can't know that without checking it out.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, this is why God created accountants.",
        "Rosanna: No, that is why they created bankruptcy.",
        "Craig: I'm sure you're used to dealing on the paper-clip level, but I'm really more of a big-picture guy.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you better start focusing, because better companies than yours have been brought down by less.",
        "[Sage sneaks in the house and grabs some money and leaves and puts a note on the porch]",

        "Jack: She's not here.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. She must have found it and thought I was trying to hide it from her. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jack: You tried to do the right thing. Would you stop? She probably went home.",
        "[Exhales deeply]",
        "Rosanna: What can I do for you, Jack?",
        "Jack: Is Sage there?",
        "Rosanna: No. I left her at the farm with Janet.",
        "Jack: Well, she's not here now, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Well, did she get Carly's letter?",
        "Jack: She must have.",
        "Rosanna: You don't know? That's the whole reason I left it at the farm, was so that you could read it with her.",
        "Jack: Well, unfortunately, that didn't happen. Listen, can you just do me a favor and find out if she's in her room?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, sure. Um, hold on.",
        "Craig: I don't believe it. He's giving you orders over the phone now?",
        "Rosanna: It's Sage. She's missing.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: Would you, um, go check outside? I'm gonna go look for her upstairs.",
        "Craig: Of course.",
        "Rosanna: She's not up there.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Rosanna: Jack, um, she's not here, but she left a note.",
        "Jack: What does it say?",
        "Rosanna: Hang on. \"Dad, everyone wants to keep me away from Mom. They won't let me call her or even read her letters, so I'm going to see her. I have plenty of money, so please don't worry. I will be back soon. Love, Sage.\"",
        "Jack: Has she already left the house?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. I --I didn't even see her come in, much less leave.",
        "Jack: Forget it. There's no time for that. Listen, just do me a favor and stay there in case she comes home.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Why is it whenever you're around disaster inevitably follows?",
        "Craig: How the hell did this become my fault?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if you weren't here, I would have seen Sage come in. I could have stopped her from running away.",
        "Craig: You're the one that insisted I stay. Never mind. At least we know where she's going. I can catch up to her.",

        "Craig: No, he told you that. I don't take orders from Jack Snyder, and neither should you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Sage is his daughter. I think we should respect his wishes. She's also Carly's daughter. Do you think for a second that she would just stand around and wait? Didn't think so. I'm out of here.",

        "Janet: Do you want me to come? Maybe I can help.",
        "Jack: Listen, thanks for offering, but I know Sage. When she wants something, she's pretty methodical. She probably figured out the best way to get to her mom. She's on her way to the train station right now. If I hurry, I can get there before the next train leaves.",
        "Janet: Why don't you call one of your cop buddies? Maybe they can get there quicker?",

        "Teri: Well, maybe they thought Europe was kind of a far distance for you to go visit.",
        "Sage: She's not really in Europe. I just said that because it seems better than where she really is.",
        "Teri: Where is she?",
        "Sage: She's at a special clinic.",
        "Teri: Is she sick?",
        "Sage: Yeah. She's an alcoholic.",
        "Teri: You know, I -- I know some people that have been to clinics like that, and, uh, it seemed to really help them, so I'm sure it'll help your mom, too. But I can understand why your family doesn't think it's such a good idea for you to go visit her.",
        "Sage: Well, they're wrong. She needs me. I have to go buy my ticket.",
        "Teri: Don't go. Uh, are you sure your mom needs you right this minute? 'Cause I could really use your help, Sage.",
        "Sage: Why?",
        "Teri: Well, um, I'm new to town, and I -- I don't know my way around, and it was hot on the train, and all I could think about was getting off and getting some ice cream, but I have no idea where to go. Could you show me?",
        "Sage: Well, they have ice cream in the train station.",
        "Teri: Yeah, but that ice cream is just, you know --",
        "Sage: Well, there's a really good place in Old Town.",

        "Brad: No, it was all Katie.",
        "Audrey: Oh, and, Henry, you did not tell me that Katie is just the prettiest thing I've ever seen.",
        "Henry: You'll have to excuse my mom. Any time she's in a new place, she likes to kiss up to everyone until she's sure they won't kick her out. You can dial it down a notch, Mom. They already agreed to feed you.",
        "Audrey: I mean every word. You know that, son. Really. Really, Katie, you and your house are just lovely.",
        "Katie: Well, thank you. I actually feel like I'm beginning to resemble a house, but --",

        "Brad: Yeah. That's what I keep telling her.",
        "Audrey: See? I really think that a woman is never any more beautiful then when she's carrying a child, and I guess I should know, since I was in the family way several times.",
        "Henry: How many -- how many times was it, actually, Mom? Or did it slip your mind, along with our birthdays?",
        "Audrey: Wow. My son is so cute. Isn't he just the cutest thing, always quick with that quip, aren't you, my little hanky-panky?",
        "Katie: Your what?",
        "Henry: Martini, anyone?",
        "Audrey: Hanky-panky. That's a name I had for him, 'cause he would tie my mother's handkerchiefs together, and he would tie them around his waist and do like this --",
        "Henry: Here you go, Mom.",
        "Audrey: It was so cute.",
        "Henry: There you go.",
        "Audrey: Oh. Well, thank you. Wow. Mmm. Good. Yeah, just the way I like it. You remember.",
        "Henry: Well, how could I forget? There was hell to pay if I didn't get it right, even at the age of 7.",
        "Katie: Audrey, I hope you like lamb.",
        "Audrey: Love. Love, love, love lamb. Love it. Um, I -- I sure hope we're not, uh, putting you two out, causing too much trouble here.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no. Please. Of course not. In fact, confessional time. You're not putting us out at all, because I had Brad just go to Lakeview and pick up a rack of lamb and all the trimmings. So we just have to heat it and serve.",
        "Brad: Katie's under doctor's orders to take it super-easy, so I will be the one serving.",
        "Audrey: Oh, no, you will do no such thing. I have never let the man of the house serve when I'm around, so I would be honored to serve you. Why don't you two go sit at the table? And I would love to serve you.",
        "Katie: Henry, please. I don't see the problem. Your mother is a doll.",
        "Henry: Yeah, she's a doll, like chucky is a doll.",
        "Brad: I -- I still don't see why this is an emergency.",
        "Henry: Maybe I overreacted, all right? But when I opened the door, I expected to see my beautiful Vienna, and instead I saw her.",
        "Audrey: And who is Vienna?",
        "Henry: It's a city in Austria, Mom. I will point it out on a map to you sometime.",
        "Katie: Henry, stop it. Vienna is the love of Henry's life.",

        "Sage: Well, my step mom said I couldn't talk to my mom because it's against the rules of the place she's in.",
        "Teri: It could be true. Those kind of clinics have a lot of rules.",
        "Sage: But, then, why would she try to hide the note my mom wrote me?",

        "Teri: You'll never know unless you go back and ask.",
        "Sage: I wrote a note saying that I was going to see my mom. They're gonna be so mad. I'm never supposed to go to the station by myself.",
        "Teri: What if I took you home? You could just tell them you were with me the whole time. At least they can't yell at you for being off on your own without an adult. Would that help?",
        "Sage: I don't know. It might.",

        "Craig: And when are you gonna see that I'm not the enemy here?",

        "Jack: It's the first place I checked. I don't know how I missed her.",
        "Rosanna: Well, by some crazy chance, she ran into a waitress that we met in Chicago, and she recognized Sage and brought her home.",
        "Jack: I'm on my way.",
        "Craig: I take it Sage is home and all is well.",
        "Jack: Sage is home, yes, but all will not be well until you take it to heart that I want you out of my life and my kids' lives, too.",

        "Audrey: I cannot tell you how much fun I have had with the two of you, but, um, my son and I cannot continue to monopolize all your time, so I'm just gonna run to the little girls' room, and then we're gonna scoot.",
        "Henry: Well?",
        "Katie: Well what?",
        "Henry: Well, you have had dinner with Audrey the abominable. How do I get rid of her?",
        "Katie: Here's an idea. You don't.",
        "Henry: Think again.",
        "Katie: Henry, I mean it. I think maybe it's a good thing that your mother's here right now. Not long ago, you were curled up on our couch, and now you're out and about.",
        "Henry: Yeah, because I am in hell, because every word that comes out of that woman's mouth is like a pitchfork into my psyche.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe that's a good thing. It'll help you forget how miserable your life has been since Vienna left you.",
        "Katie: Brad!",
        "Brad: What? What? He has been miserable. We all know it.",
        "Henry: I -- I will be more miserable if my mother is here. You have no idea how that woman treated me.",
        "Katie: No, I don't. But here's what I do see. Whatever she did in the past, I think she's trying to make up for it. And here's another little piece of advice -- how can you expect Vienna to forgive you if you can't forgive your own mother?",
        "Audrey: Uh, son.",
        "Henry: Yes? I think we really need to go and let these two adorable lovebirds get some rest -- or not.",
        "Brad: You are one savvy woman, Audrey.",
        "Katie: Yes, you are, and welcome in our home anytime.",

        "Jack: Well, I'm glad to hear it. Yeah. She's had a rough time of it lately. She can use all the friends she can get.",
        "Teri: So could I. I'm just glad we ran into each other at the train station.",
        "Jack: Well, would you and Rosanna excuse us for a minute? I would love to talk to my daughter.",
        "Sage: Are you gonna yell at me now?",
        "Jack: No, what I want to make perfectly clear to you is that no one is trying to keep your mother from you, Sage.",
        "Sage: Then why wouldn't Janet let me call her? She didn't even show me the letter mom wrote.",
        "Jack: She's trying to protect you, just like we all are.",
        "Sage: I don't need anyone to protect me from Mom. Mom would never hurt me.",
        "Jack: No, she would never, ever want to, Honey, but there's a reason why she can't make any phone calls or have any visitors, and it's the same reason why she shouldn't be sending any letters out -- not until she's better and back to herself.",
        "Sage: But she's gonna be better, isn't she?",
        "Jack: I promise you she is, Honey. And as soon as she's allowed phone calls, you can make the first one, okay?",
        "Sage: And do you promise that you'll tell me the truth and stop treating me like a little kid?",
        "Jack: Yes, I promise. I was wrong to keep what was happening with your mother from you, and I am sorry, but you know what? I need you to make me a promise, too.",
        "Sage: Not to go see Mom?",
        "Jack: What I want you to promise me is that the next time you get angry or you feel upset or you feel like someone is keeping the truth from you, to come to me -- so we can work it out together.",
        "Sage: Even if you're the one I'm mad at?",
        "Jack: Especially then. Honey, you and your brothers -- you mean the world to me. Don't you know that? And I want to keep you happy and safe, because I love you more than anything in this world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I suppose you heard the good news about your stepdaughter.",
        "Janet: I did. Jack called me on the way to Carly's house. It's a good thing that friend of hers found her and took her home.",
        "Craig: Another waitress with a heart of gold.",
        "Janet: Okay. Flattery isn't gonna help you, Craig.",
        "Craig: At this point, I'm not sure anything will.",
        "Janet: Why don't you leave Jack and his kids alone?",
        "Craig: Obviously, you haven't noticed. That's exactly what I'm doing. When I heard Sage was all right, I deliberately absented myself from the welcoming party. It's my own small attempt at keeping the peace.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Craig: You're my witness, Janet. Even when I try to give Jack what he wants, it still doesn't work. It's all right. I'm leaving on my own accord. No sense in entertaining the clientele with a scene. Good night, Mrs. Snyder. Try to keep your husband from giving himself a coronary. It's hard enough on his kids without their mother around.",

        "Rosanna: It's really an incredible coincidence that you showed up when you did, or is it?",
        "Teri: Actually, it's not a total coincidence. I kind of lost my job in Chicago, and when I was going through my stuff I found Mr. Montgomery's card. He was so nice. I thought I might as well come to Oakdale, look him up, see if maybe he could help me find another job.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Well, listen. We owe you big-time for bringing Sage home safe and sound, so I'm sure Mr. Montgomery would be happy to help you in any way that he could.",
        "Sage: I'm hungry.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, I would be happy to make you something to eat.",
        "Sage: It's gonna be healthy, isn't it?",
        "Rosanna: Why do you keep saying that like it's a bad thing?",
        "Sage: Can you make that thing you made in Chicago? It was so good.",
        "Teri: Only if it's okay with your aunt.",
        "Rosanna: Who am I to stand in the way of culinary genius?",
        "Teri: Come on.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Craig: I know the coast is clear because I saw detective do-right talking to his little woman at Al's, which means Sage must be okay, because he'd never set foot out of here if she weren't.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, Sage is doing just fine.",
        "Craig: Great.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I know this may be really horrible to say, but thank God that Teri lost her job and came to Oakdale. I mean, I hate to think what would have happened if she hadn't run into Sage at the train station.",
        "Craig: Where is Teri, anyway?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, she's in the kitchen making something for Sage that she might actually eat.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: You know, maybe we should adopt Teri. She can be the cool aunt who cooks.",

        "Audrey: Listen, I'm -- I'm -- I'm a little pooped. I think I'll get a little rest. I know it's early, but maybe just rest a little bit. Do you -- do you remember when we used to, um, lie in bed and watch TV together?",
        "Henry: Yeah. We used to cut the cards to decide who would choose the channel. And we agreed -- no trips down memory lane, so you take the bed, I'll take the couch, all right?",
        "Audrey: Fine, fine. Uh, you know, it was really sweet of you to, um, introduce me to Brad and Katie. I had a really good time.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, don't make such a big deal out of it.",
        "Audrey: I mean, it -- it really -- it meant a lot to me. Look, I -- I do realize I have not exactly been mother of the year.",
        "Henry: Ha!",
        "Audrey: I think that maybe -- maybe I'm here, and we could sort of fix things up a little. You know, patch things up between us. Maybe a little?",
        "Henry: It's too late for that.",
        "Audrey: Bull! Bull hockey! You know what? It is not too late, because if it was too late, you would have never, ever let me through that door. Henry, it really does mean a lot to me. I'm glad you did.",
        "Henry: Get some rest, Mom.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Hey, would you be a sweetie petey and call room service and tell them I want two eggs for breakfast? You know just the way I like them.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Too many people are weighing in on my children's lives right now, including, God help us all, Craig Montgomery. They don't know who to listen to anymore, Janet. There should be one clear voice in their lives, and it's got to be mine.",
        "Janet: When you're right, you're right.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. Okay. Listen, wait. I hate asking you this. I know how you feel about liberty and parker living under the same roof.",
        "Janet: How I used to feel about it.",
        "Jack: And that's changed now?",
        "Janet: Well, they seem to be managing to get along as friends, and, honey, whatever you want to do, okay? I got your back.",

        "Craig: You need help around here. Teri obviously needs a job. The kids like her, and they like her cooking.",
        "Rosanna: Isn't it bad enough you try to run things around here? Now you're hiring staff?",
        "Craig: Well, you're trying to fill pretty big shoes -- taking care of Carly's kids and her business. If you won't let me help out on one front, let me help on the other.",

        "Rosanna: This isn't gonna make any difference, you know? I'm not letting up on you.",

        "Teri: Hey, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Hi.",
