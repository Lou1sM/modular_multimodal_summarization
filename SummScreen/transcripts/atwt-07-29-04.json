        "Tom: It was you? You slept with Doc Reese? That was -- that was your compact in the car. That's why it looked familiar. Of course, I thought -- and you called Doc when I was with him that night. That was you?",
        "Jessica: Please stop, Tom.",
        "Tom: And you arranged -- you arranged to meet with him while I was there.",
        "Jessica: No, it's not like you think okay? I wanted him to back off of Margo, I wanted him not to say anything about -- I was trying to save your marriage. And mine.",
        "Tom: But you had already slept with him at that point. You were having an affair.",
        "Jessica: No, it was not an affair, Tom. It was once. One hideous mistake. And I'd give anything to take it all back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That was fast work.",
        "Nikki: I want to wrap Lucy's kidnapping. The Oakdale PD needs a win right now.",
        "Dusty: Yes, they do.",
        "Nikki: Quite a coincidence, you getting that tip.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Eddie I don't really keep in touch; just with old contacts, you know? Eddie not only knows Don Creel's brother personally, he gives me the first name of Creel's partner. Just like that -- Wade. Small world, huh?",
        "Nikki: Yeah, it sure is.",
        "Dusty: What's this?",
        "Nikki: Mug shots. Everyone with the first or last name Wade, anyone that has anything close to that who was in Joliet at the same time as Creel.",
        "Dusty: Let's start at the top.",
        "Lucy: Hey, sorry I'm late.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: Nikki called me.",
        "Nikki: Lucy got a look at Wade.",
        "Dusty: We don't need to involve her.",
        "Lucy: I want to help. We're in this together, Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Our wife isn't here at the moment.",
        "Alan: Don't make me regret doing you a favor, Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Come on in. So you're doing me a favor?",
        "Alan: I'm trying to. I've sat on this long enough. I decided it's only fair to warn you.",
        "Craig: About what. Is something wrong with Lucy?",
        "Alan: No. I had a chat with Dusty Donovan when he got out of jail.",
        "Craig: Oh. Why?",
        "Alan: He sought me out. He's your partner, isn't he?",
        "Craig: We own a bar together.",
        "Alan: He made some terrible accusations.",
        "Craig: Well, listen, little buddy. Dusty's charming, but he's a con man and a liar. Whatever he said, odds are, it isn't true.",
        "Alan: Well, I hope so, Craig. Because Donovan accused you of hiring Don Creel and his partner to kidnap Lucy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You have something?",
        "Medical examiner: Lab reports on the blood found in the car. Its Detective Snyder's.",
        "Hal: Have you seen the body?",
        "Medical examiner: No, I just got here. I'll do a quick preliminary exam after you give me an I.D.",
        "Hal: Okay, let's do it.",
        "Medical examiner: It won't be pretty. Are you ready?",
        "Hal: If it's who I think it is, I'll never be ready. But it's my job, so let's go.",
        "Carly: Let me see him, Hal.",
        "Hal: Carly, let me do it.",
        "Carly: I have to, Hal.",
        "Hal: No, Carly. I don't want that picture imprinted on your mind, it's inevitable.",
        "Carly: It won't be worse than what I'd imagine. Please. It's my right, isn't it?",
        "Hal: Okay, but if you want to look away, you look right here. You look at me, you got it?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Hal: You focus on me.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Hal: All right, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Jess, Jess -- why? You and Ben, you're newlyweds. I mean, you're starting a family.",
        "Jessica: I know, but --",
        "Tom: Then how? Are you bored already?",
        "Jessica: No! I love Ben with all my heart.",
        "Tom: Then what is it? How could you do something this destructive?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I have asked myself that 100 times a day. I've been making myself crazy, but the thing is, there just is no explanation, Tom. There's no excuse. It happened.",
        "Tom: What is it about Doc Reese?",
        "Jessica: It's not about Doc.",
        "Tom: No? You and Margo both put your marriages on the line for no reason?",
        "Jessica: Margo didn't. She did not sleep with Doc.",
        "Tom: She was his lover in every other way and you know it.",
        "Jessica: Tom, I know you feel betrayed, but it does not have to end your marriage.",
        "Tom: If I were you, I would be worried about my own marriage.",
        "Jessica: I am.",
        "Tom: So how is Ben gonna handle this?",
        "Jessica: I don't see what good it would do to tell him.",
        "Tom: You think you can keep this a secret?",
        "Jessica: Do you want to break Ben's heart? Because I don't.",
        "Tom: Too late.",
        "Jessica: Tom, it was one hideous mistake. It will never happen again.",
        "Tom: I wouldn't count on that.",
        "Jessica: Tom?",
        "Tom: Don't worry. I'm not gonna be the one that says anything to Ben. This is your mess. You clean it up.",
        "Jessica: And what about Margo? Are you gonna give her another chance?",
        "Tom: I think you should focusing in your chances, which at the moment, don't look very good.",
        "Jessica: Well, at least I'm fighting to keep what I love.",
        "Tom: Oh, I see. So what Ben doesn't know doesn't hurt him? Well, you're right about that, Jess. It's not gonna hurt him. It's gonna destroy him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Before Creel died, he told Dusty Lucy's father was behind the kidnapping.",
        "Craig: According to Dusty.",
        "Alan: He's serious, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh, little buddy, don't you see what this is? He rescued Lucy. For the first time in his desperate life, he got to be a white knight. He's not gonna give that up.",
        "Alan: Well, he thinks you're the one who needs to be a hero. That you could use the ransom money. He's very convincing.",
        "Craig: Not according to the police. Sure he tried to sell this to the police. I killed Creel, I had my daughter kidnapped.",
        "Alan: So the police know?",
        "Craig: They looked into it. They saw it for what it was. I can't believe he's still trying to peddle that. He didn't tell you the police cleared me, did he?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Craig: Well, now you see it for what it is, don't you?",
        "Alan: Yes. I should warn Sierra and Lucy.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no! There's no reason to upset them. Things are just getting back to normal here.",
        "Alan: Yeah, what if Dusty tells them what he told me?",
        "Craig: Well, did Sierra or Lucy say anything that might lead you to believe they'd heard anything?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Craig: Well, good. Then that means Dusty hasn't gone completely round the bend, then.",
        "Alan: Yeah, but Craig, I don't think Donovan is gonna stop. He seems pretty determined to get proof.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't think he's gonna get far. Now, little buddy, listen, it's been very decent of you to come by. I'm sure everything is gonna be fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "Alan: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe -- maybe you're right.",
        "Craig: I usually am, sailor.",
        "Alan: All right. I'm not your enemy, Craig.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. But you are the fall guy. Dusty, why can't you leave this alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: What's the problem?",
        "Lucy: There is no problem.",
        "Dusty: She's been through enough, that's the problem.",
        "Lucy: I am a lot tougher than I look. Besides, you saw this guy, Wade, what? Two seconds at Metro. I got a pretty good look at him when he tried to grab me at the cabin.",
        "Nikki: She's right.",
        "Dusty: She's right? Okay, let's do it.",
        "Nikki: All right, I need to check in at the station. Are you guys okay to start?",
        "Lucy: Sure.",
        "Nikki: All right.",
        "Dusty: Are we okay to start? We'd better start with this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Look, I don't want your sympathy, all I -- okay, fine. Just have him call me when there's an update. Thank you.",
        "Molly: There's no news?",
        "Holden: No. How are you?",
        "Molly: How am I?",
        "Holden: Carly was pretty rough on you earlier.",
        "Molly: Forget it. I'm fine. You must be hungry. I bet you could use something to eat. I think you should sit down right over here and let me make you a sandwich.",
        "Holden: I'm not hungry. I don't need anything.",
        "Molly: No, no, no. A yummy sandwich will be right here waiting for you, just staring at you. So you might as well eat.",
        "Holden: No, I don't want anything.",
        "Molly: Please, please, just let me do this for you, okay?",
        "Holden: Okay, thanks.",
        "Molly: It's the least I can do since Lily's not here.",

        "Hal: It's not Jack. That's Kenneth Starziak.",
        "Medical examiner: The perp who was in the car?",
        "Hal: Right.",
        "Medical examiner: Okay. I'll do a quick prelim.",
        "Carly: It wasn't him. Jack's okay.",
        "Hal: Carly --",
        "Carly: He's out there. We can still find him. We need to get more boats.",
        "Hal: No, we've had every available boat --",
        "Carly: The trees.",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Carly: The trees, you have to check the trees by the shore. Maybe Jack's not in the water at all. Maybe he got out of the car, maybe he got washed up by a tree in the water. We need to get helicopters. Can you get one? Cause my boss has one.",
        "Hal: Carly, we've had helicopters out all night with search lights. We've got helicopters out right now.",
        "Carly: You need to get more. We can find him, Hal. Jack is out there, waiting for us. We need to do everything we can.",
        "Hal: We will. We'll look until we find him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Lily? Good lord -- what?",
        "Lily: That was Margo. They found Starziak body at the bridge.",
        "Emma: Have they found Jack?",
        "Lily: They haven't found Jack, but they're searching for him in the water. Boats and divers --",
        "Emma: How far south are they? Have they --",
        "Lily: Parker. Hey. Hey, you ready for dinner?",
        "Emma: Here's your hamburger and French fries. Where do you want to sit, sweetheart?",
        "Parker: Can I eat in my room?",
        "Emma: Sure you can. That's a good idea. I'll bring you up some ketchup, okay? I won't be long. Do you think he heard us?",
        "Lily: I don't think so. I don't think so.",
        "Emma: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: He seemed okay. I gotta go, I gotta go. I gotta go meet Holden. Are you okay with the kids? Are you all right? What about Carly?",
        "Emma: Oh, sweetheart, don't. Don't think that way now. Everything is going to be all right. It is. Everything's going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't care how long it takes. We'll be out here, right, Hal? But it's taking too long, isn't it?",
        "Hal: Sooner would be better.",
        "Carly: The fishermen.",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Carly: Put out a call. If all the local fisherman would get out in their boats, maybe they can --",
        "Hal: Carly -- Carly, we've got the river covered completely. Every cop on the force is out there right now. Did you know that? Literally nobody took a night off. Everybody's either on the search or back in town covering. Carly, we are searching 40 miles downstream.",
        "Carly: Then they'll find him soon. Because sooner is better.",
        "Hal: Sooner is better.",
        "Medical examiner: Lieutenant?",
        "Hal: Not good -- what?",
        "Medical examiner: You want my report, no holds barred?",
        "Hal: No holds barred.",
        "Medical examiner: Your perp Starziak didn't drown. I mean, you saw the rocks down there?",
        "Hal: Yes.",
        "Medical examiner: That's why the body's so battered. I'd say he died the minute he hit those rocks. So if a man went over the side with him -- a man who was already injured --",
        "Hal: You don't know how badly Jack was injured.",
        "Medical examiner: Judging by the amount of blood and the spatter pattern in the car, Hal, it wasn't a little cut. Given that and the water temperature and the current -- there's no way he survived last night. If your crews haven't found him already, you're looking for a corpse.",
        "Hal: That'll be your report?",
        "Medical examiner: Oh, come on. You know the drill. The commissioner already called. The cost of an all-out rescue search is --",
        "Hal: I don't give a damn about the cost! Neither does my crew. Nobody's ready to give up. Please, Howard, don't make that call. There's always a chance Jack did not go into the water. If we find some sign he did not go over this bridge, it's a different ball game.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Cop: Lieutenant, we found something.",
        "Hal: It's part of a shirt.",
        "Carly: It's Jack's.",
        "Hal: Are you sure this is Jack's shirt?",
        "Hal: We'll take care of this, Carly. Just a minute, honey. I'll be right back. Where was this shirt found?",
        "Cop: In the middle of the river underneath the rocks. Directly beneath the bridge.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm so stupid. It's just a shirt, little bit of blood on it. Jack's cut himself worse than that shaving.",
        "Hal: Carly, they found that in the river.",
        "Carly: So that's where they can search. Hal?",
        "Hal: It's where they found it",
        "Carly: It's where they should be looking.",
        "Hal: We will. We will keep looking until we find him. I promise you that.",
        "Carly: Hal?",
        "Hal: Carly, up until now, this has been a rescue mission. Now it's a recovery.",

        "Holden: Are you at the bridge?",
        "Margo: No, no, I'm holding down the fort here. Hal asked me to return his calls, and I saw that there was a message from you.",
        "Holden: Then there's news, isn't there?",
        "Margo: Yeah, you heard about the body this morning?",
        "Holden: What? No, I --",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, I thought you were with Lily when --",
        "Holden: No, no. She's in Milltown --",
        "Margo: No, it's not Jack. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- it's Starziak.",
        "Holden: They found Starziak body. Well, that's good. So now we can concentrate on --",
        "Margo: Holden, there's more. We found part of Jack's shirt under the rocks by the bridge. And according to the medical examiner, if that's where he went in, it doesn't look good. Holden?",
        "Holden: I'm here.",
        "Margo: I'll keep you posted.",
        "Holden: Thanks, Margo.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Holden: They found Jack's shirt in the water. But there's no sign of Jack.",

        "Tom: Hey, I heard.",
        "Margo: At the courthouse?",
        "Tom: Was the body Jack's?",
        "Margo: No. But they found part of Jack's shirt under the rocks. There was blood -- I'm really sorry. I've just -- I've had my game face on all night. And, you know, I've just been sending out rescue crews, and fielding phone calls, and keeping everyone on track here. And we were just so sure. We were so sure we would have found him by now. But, you know, he'd be a little banged up. But he's tough as nails. Jack, he's -- he's Jack. God, I can't believe this. How can this be happening to Jack and Carly now? I mean, they just got their lives back together and now this.",
        "Tom: Well, nothing makes sense anymore.",
        "Margo: Are we still talking about Jack and Carly?",
        "Tom: Everything. I just finished talking to Jessica. She told me about her and Doc Reese.",
        "Margo: What did she tell you?",
        "Tom: She told me that she slept with him and that you didn't.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: So now do you believe me?",
        "Tom: I've believed you every time. I know you didn't sleep with the guy. That doesn't change anything.",

        "Jessica: No, I just decided to treat my husband to a romantic dinner. I made your favorites -- brisket of beef, twice baked potato.",
        "Ben: Sweet potato pie?",
        "Jessica: From the bakery.",
        "Ben: I'll take it. What did I ever do to deserve a wife like you?",

        "Ben: One minute could change our lives forever. You know, I tried to imagine what Carly must be going through. All I could see was emptiness. This empty, empty space. Because that's what I would feel if anything ever happened to you, to our baby, I don't \u0096",

        "Lucy: Anything interesting?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Look at that. Looks like our friend, Wade, has a gambling problem. Three years ago for making book. Posts bail on a credit card. What an idiot. Let's see if he still has it. Yeah, I'm having a problem, my name is Wade Larson. I lost my credit card. I don't know when, exactly. That's the problem. That's what I thought you'd say. Do you know where I last used it? Sure, I do. My account number is -- ready? 5730-4000-0569-3433. Okay, wonderful. I'll stop by there and see if I can -- hey, you know what? I just found it. It wasn't right under my papers. I'm so sorry for having put you through all this. I'm such a moron. No, everything's fine now. Don't cancel anything. Thank you, sweetie. Have a good day.",
