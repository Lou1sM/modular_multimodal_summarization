        "Casey and Allison reconnect after he sets up a romantic date for them on the hospital roof. They promise to try to communicate better. Meanwhile, communication is lacking when Tom is less then thrilled to find Riley/Adam and Margo closer then ever. Instead of sharing his feelings with Margo, he simply tells them that he has gotten Riley/Adam a job at a law firm in Milwaukee and he would be leaving that night, as Margo is very upset. Riley/Adam is forced to go along. Margo panics and enlists Casey's help to stop Tom from sending Adam away. Casey speaks with Tom about why he is doing this and finds out that Tom is worried there might be something inappropriate going on between Margo and Riley, as Casey finds it hard not to tell him the truth. Casey is able to talk Tom out of sending Riley away, as Margo is thrilled but horrified when Casey explains why Tom acted the way he did. Margo and Tom reconnect afterwards, but Margo still isn't able to share the truth about Adam. A relieved Adam learns that Casey stepped up for him and Allison is pleased to see this too. Jack decides that Sage and Parker should live with him because he can't trust Rosanna and Craig. He heads off to break the news. Craig offers Terri a job as nanny to Sage and Parker, but Terri isn't sure. When Craig sweetens the deal with a job at summer's end at Metro, Terri jumps at this. Sage is tickled to learn her friend Terri will be living with her this summer. Rosanna is sure that Jack won't like not being consulted, and her observation is very accurate when Jack doesn't want anything to do with a stranger taking care of his kids and is just as annoyed that Craig took it upon himself to hire her. Terri doesn't like Jack's reaction, but doesn't have much to say about it. Sage is very upset to learn Jack vetoed Terri moving in, as is Parker. Jack tries to smooth things over later at the farm, but Sage wants none of his explanations. Terri realizes that she didn't give Sage her contact information so Rosanna and Craig give her directions to the farm, as Sage is thrilled to see Terri. Jack, however, is not at all happy and goes as far as accusing Terri of stalking Sage, which infuriates Terri. Janet hears the commotion and heads out and is shocked to find Jack and Sage with her long lost sister."

        "Casey: Ali, Ali, good, good. You didn't -- you didn't leave yet.",
        "Alison: Uh, no. I was just about to.",
        "Casey: Well, what are you doing now?",
        "Alison: Heading home. Just got off another double shift in the E.R. I am wiped.",
        "Casey: I was hoping I could take you somewhere.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'd love to, but I'm so tired.",
        "Casey: No, you don't have to use any energy! This is a non-active activity. You just have to use your ears.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Casey: Okay, you remember that outdoor concert in the quad?",
        "Alison: Yeah, the one that was sold out like 10 minutes after the tickets went on sale?",
        "Casey: And that's where I'm taking you.",
        "Alison: How did you do that?",
        "Casey: Just come on. We'll be late if we don't go.",
        "Alison: Well, no, no. I can't go dressed like this.",
        "Casey: Yes, you can!",
        "Alison: All right.",
        "Casey: No -- what?",
        "Alison: The elevator's this way.",
        "Casey: Yes, but the concert is this way. Come on, come on.",
        "Alison: What are you doing, Casey?",
        "Casey: Trust me. I'm taking you to the shortcut to the best seats in the house.",
        "[Casey babbles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: There.",
        "Riley: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Margo: I owe you that. I owe you that. You take it. Take it.",
        "Tom: Well, something smells good.",
        "Margo: Well, pull up a chair, Dear. Supper's almost ready.",
        "Tom: So you're cooking again, huh?",
        "Margo: Yeah. You got a problem with that?",
        "Tom: No. It's just you spent more time in the kitchen the last few weeks than you have the entire time we've been married.",
        "Margo: Well, it's because of Riley here. He's teaching me. We're having yet again another Middle Eastern dish. Here, taste it. Is that too much cilantro again?",
        "Riley: Mm, hmm-mm. It's excellent.",
        "Margo: \"Excellent,\" good.",
        "Riley: It's good.",
        "Margo: That's a word that's never been used in my kitchen.",
        "Tom: So, Riley, how's the job hunt going?",
        "Riley: You know, it's tough out there. All the good C.E.O. slots seem to be taken.",
        "Margo: Well, you know what? If you can't find a job, why don't you just go back to school? You mentioned that you were interested in law.",
        "Riley: It's too much time and money.",
        "Margo: Well, we could help.",
        "Riley: You guys have given me a place to live. You've done enough already. No.",
        "Margo: Listen, education is important.",
        "Riley: You know, who's ready to eat?",
        "Tom: I'll go wash up.",
        "Riley: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: What's your proposition?",
        "Craig: You came to Oakdale looking for a better job than the one you left behind, right?",
        "Teri: Absolutely. I'm so over waitressing.",
        "Craig: Well, I have a perfect solution for you.",
        "Teri: No way.",
        "Craig: Way. You interested?",
        "Teri: Definitely. This is embarrassing to admit now, but I was beginning to think that when you gave me your card, you were just blowing smoke.",
        "Rosanna: He often does.",
        "Craig: Just not now.",
        "Teri: So what's the job? When do I start?",
        "Craig: Rosanna needs a little help with Parker and Sage.",
        "Teri: Babysitting? No thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Mwah. You know something? You have never, ever, never, ever, never, ever let me down.",
        "Janet: Well, I've got a lot -- a lot, lot, lot, lot -- to live up to. Remember when my kid was having problems and I wanted her to move into the farm? You and Emma just brought up an extra chair to the table like it was nothing.",
        "Jack: We're family.",
        "Janet: I like that about our family.",
        "Jack: It'll be good to finally get these kids in a stable environment, Janet. It has been so hectic for so long.",
        "Janet: Hey, Carly tried to keep it together as long as she could.",
        "Jack: I know, I know, but still, I should have gotten them out of there sooner.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, they wanted to live with her. You had to respect that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but once she went to rehab, I should have gotten them out of there and -- and away from Craig.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh! It's back to Craig again.",
        "Jack: Because he's always around.",
        "Janet: They were engaged.",
        "Jack: Carly's gone, and Rosanna is clueless about children.",
        "Janet: Okay, all right, all right, all right. When do you want them to move in? This weekend?",
        "Jack: I was thinking I'd go pick them up right now.",
        "Janet: Oh. All right. I'll get Lenore to cover for me. Let me just get my purse. I'll be right back.",
        "Jack: Blah! Actually, Honey, I was thinking I -- I should probably do this alone.",
        "Janet: Oh. All right, fine.",
        "Jack: No, hey, come on. Don't get touchy. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I just --",
        "Janet: You just what? You just want to do this without me. I heard you the first time.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, don't think of it as babysitting. It's -- it's really more of a -- nanny/chef position.",
        "Teri: I don't want to be a nanny.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Teri: I worked hard to put myself through college in the culinary institute. It's time that started paying off.",
        "Craig: Oh! You want to run a restaurant?",
        "Teri: That's the idea. So, unless you have a four-star bistro in your back pocket --",
        "Craig: Well, as it turns out, Sage and Parker's mother happens to be part- owner in a place called Metro.",
        "Rosanna: Uh, Metro is not a restaurant. It's a club.",
        "Craig: Which also serves food. And with Teri's qualifications, you might just get at least three of the four stars you're looking for.",
        "Teri: All I need is a chance.",
        "Craig: Well, then, spend the summer babysitting, and when Carly comes back, you can take over Metro.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me. What do you think you're doing?",
        "Craig: Sweetening the pot.",
        "Rosanna: Metro is Carly's business, not yours. And no offense to you, Teri, we don't even know if she's qualified.",
        "Teri: Oh, I'm more than qualified. I just need a shot.",
        "Craig: There. She needs a job. You need help. Everybody wins. So, what do you say?",
        "Teri: If I really do get to run a restaurant after one summer of babysitting, then you got yourself a deal.",
        "Craig: And you got yourself a nanny.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. I love you, and I always want you around me. Stop!",
        "Janet: But not today.",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm going into the line of fire without a bulletproof vest. I'm trying to protect you.",
        "Janet: Come on! You don't think they'll want to live with us?",
        "Jack: Parker will probably be all for it. Sage is gonna be the hard sell.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. Those kids adore you. And Sage would give anything to spend a little more time with her daddy.",
        "Jack: Or, she might not want to move out of a house where she doesn't have to share a bathroom.",
        "Janet: Do you think she'll blame me?",
        "Jack: Stepmom. You're an easy target.",
        "Janet: Oh. Okay, I see your point. I -- I see your point. But listen, if we don't want Sage to be upset, I better get home and start cooking.",
        "Jack: Because?",
        "Janet: Because I got to make my famous tiramisu. Because then, that'll put anybody in a good mood, and then she'll really, really want to live with us. And then she won't be mad at me.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad that -- that you live with me. So, what happens after -- what happens after dessert?",
        "Janet: More of these.",
        "Jack: Oh. I'll, uh --",
        "Janet: Hmm?",
        "Jack: I'll hurry home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Let's give Sage the good news.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, please, please. Let's just talk to Jack before we -- hi. There she is!",
        "Sage: Teri said I can wear her apron, since we're making a culinary masterpiece.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, it looks great on you.",
        "Sage: So, I smooshed all the vegetables together. What do I do next?",
        "Craig: Next we celebrate.",
        "Sage: Celebrate what?",
        "Rosanna: Craig, please.",
        "Craig: Teri's gonna be your babysitter for the whole summer. You two get to cook together every day!",
        "Sage: You mean it?",
        "Teri: What do you think?",
        "Sage: It's gonna be the best summer ever.",
        "Teri: Let's finish turning your smooshed vegetables into a taste sensation.",
        "Craig: Boy, how easy was that?",
        "Rosanna: You just crossed so many lines, mister.",
        "Craig: And I just solved so many problems.",
        "Rosanna: You cannot unilaterally give away jobs at Carly's business!",
        "Craig: Well, I've worked with Carly long enough to know that she appreciates talent. Now, if Teri isn't any good, she'll be gone in a week. No harm, no foul. But if she's great, and I suspect she will be, then Carly's gonna be thrilled.",
        "Rosanna: What about Jack? Did he or did he not read us the riot act about not consulting him where his children are concerned?",
        "Craig: It really didn't make sense to consult with him if we didn't know if Teri would be interested. But now that she's agreed, you'll just tell Jack, and I'm sure everything will be fine.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no, no. I am not telling Jack anything.",
        "Craig: Fine. I'll tell him. I'm not afraid of him.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe you should be afraid. Very afraid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, uh -- what are we having?",
        "Margo: Uh, we got some rice and -- and some lamb and, uh, uh, a spinach thing I can't pronounce.",
        "[Riley chuckles]",
        "Riley: Uh, sit down. I'll fix you a plate.",
        "Margo: Okay. You know, while we were making dinner, Riley was, uh, explaining to me Afghan culture and --",
        "Tom: Was he?",
        "Margo: Yeah. What was that thing you said about uninvited guests?",
        "Riley: Um, well, actually, in Afghanistan, it's -- you know, when guests stop by or people stop by, it's -- it's actually sort of a nice thing. Guests are sort of revered.",
        "Tom: No matter how long they stay? I mean, it's one thing to come by for a meal or a visit, but, I mean, if you stick around much longer, I mean, that's a different story, right?",
        "Margo: Tom, what do you want to drink?",
        "Tom: Oh, I'll have what -- whatever Riley wants. He's the guest.",
        "Riley: I'll have whatever Tom's having.",
        "Tom: Great. Um, have a beer.",
        "Riley: Me too.",
        "Tom: So, did I hear Margo mention earlier that you're interested in the law?",
        "Riley: Yeah, I am. But becoming a lawyer -- it's not really realistic.",
        "Tom: Well, I mean, I think it might be. I was talking to a colleague, and -- and I believe that maybe you could get a job and pursue your education.",
        "Margo: Whoa. That sounds promising.",
        "Riley: Yeah, it sure does.",
        "Tom: I mean, you would start as a paralegal in his firm, and -- and they would train you there on-site. And if you showed promise, they would probably contribute towards your law school if you wanted to go at night.",
        "Margo: That is absolutely perfect! How long have you been working on this?",
        "Tom: Just took a phone call.",
        "Riley: I don't know what to say. I mean, the fact that you'd go out of your way to help me like this, I -- it means a lot to me, Tom. Thanks.",
        "Margo: Well, I -- this is a perfect situation.",
        "Tom: I mean, I guess so. You'd work for one of the top law firms in Milwaukee.",
        "Margo: Milwaukee?",
        "Tom: Yeah. Is that a problem?",
        "Margo: Yeah, that's a problem. You call him back and tell him that he -- he turned the job down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why did you put all those cones in front of the door?",
        "Casey: I didn't want anyone to disturb us.",
        "Alison: Well, if we're only coming up here for a second, why does it really matter?",
        "Casey: Look at this. Look around.",
        "Alison: Wow!",
        "Casey: Yes!",
        "Alison: When did you do this?",
        "Casey: Uh, this afternoon, when I got off work. Uh, you like it?",
        "Alison: It's a lot nicer than a concert.",
        "Casey: Well, I did promise you a concert, and we do have the best seats in the house. Listen.",
        "Alison: You thought of everything.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know. Take a load off!",
        "Alison: What? Some music and -- and you got me just relaxing in under five minutes?",
        "Casey: Well, it is a picnic, and I did get refreshments!",
        "Alison: What'd you bring?",
        "Casey: I brought some sandwiches, some sodas, some chips, you know? Um, some chocolate cake, too.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Wow. So, this is what you brought me up here for, just to, uh, eat, listen to music?",
        "Casey: Well, I would be lying if I said I don't want anything else, you know?",
        "Alison: What are you waiting for?",
        "Casey: I just want us to be all the way back first.",
        "Alison: \"All the way back?\"",
        "Casey: Yeah, to where we were, you know, before? When you told me your secrets, you laughed at my jokes, or, you know, we could just sit and be quiet, and that was enough.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that was nice.",
        "Casey: I want you to trust me again, Alison.",
        "Alison: Well, loving someone is a lot easier than trusting someone.",
        "Casey: Is that because of the way I acted when I found you with Hunter?",
        "Alison: It's because when you get mad, you don't think. You just yell. And it hurts a lot.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know. I hate -- I hate that I hurt you. And -- and when we broke up, I felt so bad all the time. And I don't want to go through that again.",
        "Alison: Well, can you promise you won't lose your temper anymore?",
        "Casey: I want to promise that. I really do. But I just know sometimes stuff flies out of my mouth. But I -- I will work on it. See, I love the fact that yes, you are my girlfriend, but I love it even more that you're my friend, and I want to keep that. Can you trust that, at least?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Alison: I can do that.",
        "[Casey laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So why wouldn't Riley take the job? You yourself said it was the perfect situation.",
        "Margo: But it's not in Oakdale.",
        "Tom: A job's a job. Milwaukee's not that far away.",
        "Riley: You know, Tom's right. You know, of course I'll consider it.",
        "Margo: Um, could you excuse us for just a minute?",
        "Riley: Yeah.",
        "[Riley sighs]",
        "Margo: What -- what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Tom: I don't know. What are you doing?",
        "Margo: I don't understand why you're so eager to get rid of this really great kid who's been nothing but good to us.",
        "Tom: So, you think I can't see what's going on here?",
        "Margo: What, what? We're having a perfectly pleasant --",
        "Tom: Why does our entire family seem to revolve around Riley, what he wants to eat, what he wants to cook, the fact that he doesn't seem to want to work?",
        "Margo: He works. He works a lot around here. He -- he helps me all the time. And I like having him around.",
        "Tom: Well, I can see that. But it's time for him to go, and he's gonna go this time, 'cause I'll see to it personally.",
        "Margo: No matter what I want?",
        "Tom: Riley just said he wants the job. Why do you have a problem with this kid making his own decisions?",
        "Margo: You know, Honey, you're right. You're right. I am overreacting. It's not like he's leaving anytime soon. He's got the whole interview process to go through. And you know what? We'll keep his room ready in case he doesn't like his job.",
        "Tom: Wow. I think that you've misunderstood me. He, Riley, is leaving tonight.",
        "Margo: Tonight? Where's he gonna go? He doesn't have any money.",
        "Tom: Well, I'll buy him a plane ticket and make sure he has the cash for a hotel room when he gets to Milwaukee.",
        "Margo: No, that's not fair. You can't -- that's not fair. It's too soon.",
        "Tom: Too soon? As far as I'm concerned, it couldn't be soon enough.",
        "Margo: You can't do that. I don't want Riley to go. I want him here. I need him here.",
        "Tom: So what is it, Honey? I mean, what does this kid mean to you?",
        "Margo: He -- he's -- he reminds me of Adam.",
        "Tom: Adam is dead, and you can't replace him by throwing some other kid in his room. I'm pretty sure you understand that. I'm gonna tell Riley to pack his stuff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Wait, wait. Are you -- are you -- are you sure?",
        "Alison: And what about you? Do you still want me?",
        "Casey: I want you more than anything in this world.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Just ignore it, okay? Just ignore it.",
        "Alison: It's too distracting.",
        "Casey: Yes, I will -- okay, I'll turn it off.",
        "Alison: Who was it?",
        "Casey: It was my mom. She'll leave a message.",
        "[Siren wails]",
        "Alison: You're vibrating. Maybe you should answer it.",
        "Casey: Do I have to? Please!",
        "Alison: Well, it depends. Do you want me making love with you, or do you want me worrying about your mother?",
        "Casey: Oh, gosh. Mom, what's up?",
        "Margo: Hey, Casey, I need you to come home right away.",
        "Casey: What is it? Do you have like another surprise party for me or something?",
        "Margo: No, it's about your brother. Something terrible has happened.",
        "Casey: Tell me what happened.",
        "Margo: Your father is kicking Adam out. He's -- he's making him leave. Come on. You got to come home so we can find a way to stop this.",
        "[Casey groans]",
        "Casey: I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. I'll -- I'll talk to Dad tomorrow.",
        "Margo: No, not tomorrow! He's -- he's making him leave tonight for Milwaukee.",
        "Casey: What?! Why?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I can't explain it. Would you please just come home? Please. You got to do this for me.",
        "[Casey sighs]",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Casey: My mom needs me to go home.",
        "Alison: Why? What happened?",
        "Casey: Some crazy family stuff.",
        "Alison: Okay. Yeah, go ahead. I -- I'll pack everything up.",
        "Casey: Where are you gonna be?",
        "Alison: Uh, home, I guess, unless you want me to wait here for you.",
        "Casey: No, I -- I don't know how long this is gonna take. But I -- I'll call you later, okay?",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Riley: What choice do I have, all right? Tom's already made it clear he doesn't want me around.",
        "Margo: That's because he doesn't understand. He doesn't know who you are.",
        "Riley: All right. Then let's tell him.",
        "Margo: No, we can't. Oh, God. We've gone over this a thousand times. We can't do that, because he would insist that I arrest you, and I'm not gonna do that. That would break my heart.",
        "Riley: I'm sorry to put you through this. Maybe I should never have come back.",
        "Margo: No, of course you should. You're my son. You belong here.",
        "Riley: At least Casey will be glad I'm gone.",
        "Margo: That's not true. In fact, he's coming over right now to talk to Tom.",
        "Riley: Mom, what did you do?",
        "Margo: I called him. He's your brother. He has to help us out with this.",
        "Riley: Oh, great. So now I get to sit around here and witness Casey and Dad duking it out?",
        "Margo: No, no. You're -- you're gonna get out of here and buy us some time. No, leave that, leave that, leave that here. Just, uh, I'll call you when it's safe to come back.",
        "Riley: What are you gonna tell Dad?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I'll think of something. Would you please just go?",
        "Tom: Hey, Riley. You all packed?",
        "Riley: Almost. I -- I got to head to the drugstore and -- and get a few things.",
        "Tom: Perfect. I'll drop you by on the way to the airport.",
        "Margo: Would you please just let him do what he needs to do?",
        "Tom: Hurry back. Don't want to be late for your flight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I was just leaving.",
        "Rosanna: Uh, don't. Not so fast. Don't you have something to tell Jack?",
        "Jack: What have you done now?",
        "Craig: Something helpful. Rosanna and I came up with a way to keep Sage happy until Carly comes home.",
        "Jack: So have I. I'm taking Sage and Parker to live with me and Janet at the farm.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no! Oh, that's -- don't you think that's a little extreme? I mean, I know you and Janet are really busy, and you, your jobs, and the kids are at home here --",
        "Jack: Rosanna, there's -- there's nothing extreme about it. Listen, you don't have experience with kids this age. You really don't.",
        "Rosanna: I know I've made a lot of mistakes, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, it's not that. But listen, if she and Parker are with me out at the farm, then I don't have to worry about this guy hanging around.",
        "Rosanna: But Carly wanted me to be here.",
        "Jack: Carly's in rehab. And I really don't mean to sound harsh at all, but obviously, you're in way over your head here.",
        "Craig: Rosanna knows that. That's why she won't be running the house by herself anymore.",
        "Jack: If you think you're moving in here, you're out of your tree.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no, no. He's not moving in. Do you think I'm completely insane?",
        "Craig: No, actually, I'm gonna concede to your wishes and stay away. But what I have done is hire a full-time, live-in babysitter to help out.",
        "Jack: I don't care if you found Mary Poppins herself. No one hired by you is gonna be looking after my kids. So whoever this is, you call them. You tell them there's no job.",

        "Casey: And Riley?",
        "Margo: Well, Tom thinks that Riley has gone to the drugstore, but I -- I told him to not come back until I call him.",
        "Casey: What's going on?",
        "Margo: Well, you -- your father's found a guy who's gonna offer Riley a job in Milwaukee.",
        "Casey: Milwaukee?",
        "Margo: Yeah. But your dad wants Riley to leave tonight.",
        "Casey: Well, what's the rush?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I don't know. He just -- Tom is convinced that I'm somehow just way too focused on Riley or something.",
        "Casey: Uh, yes, you are.",
        "Margo: Well, duh! He's your brother.",
        "Casey: I know that. Dad doesn't.",

        "Casey: Yeah, sure. But, uh, do you really think it's a good idea that Riley is sent away?",
        "[Tom laughs]",
        "Tom: Excuse me? All this from the guy that's done nothing but complain since he got here?",
        "Casey: Yes, I know, I know.",
        "Tom: So, where's it coming from?",
        "Casey: Mom. She called me really upset, you know? She was -- she was crying, Dad.",
        "Tom: Crying? Over a guy that she hadn't met a couple months ago?",
        "Casey: I know, but they get along, a -- and she really cares about him.",
        "Tom: Apparently.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe he's not that bad of a guy. You know, he helped me with Alison, and obviously, Mom's happy with him.",

        "Casey: Don't you want her to be happy?",

        "Tom: I'm sending him away.",
        "Casey: Why? Dad?",
        "Tom: Because I have a problem with his behavior.",
        "Casey: Well, what'd he do?",
        "Tom: Let's just say -- it's inappropriate. Some lines have been crossed.",
        "Casey: With you?",
        "Tom: With your mom.",
        "Casey: Are you -- wait, are you saying you think there's something going on between -- Dad, there's -- you're -- you're 100% wrong here.",

        "Jack: No, it's not you. It's not -- Teri, is it? Listen, I'm very grateful that you found Sage and you brought her back. I really am.",
        "Craig: Then what's the problem?",
        "Jack: The -- if someone hired a babysitter to watch Johnny without consulting you first, you'd go ballistic, Craig.",
        "Craig: You're right, you're right. And I apologize, sincerely. But it didn't make any sense to consult with you if we didn't even know if Teri would be interested. And Rosanna was about to call you right when you arrived.",
        "Teri: I will take really good care of them.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, uh, no offense, really, but all I know about you is that you're a waitress in Chicago who happened, uh, to find Sage when she was in the process of running off.",
        "Craig: So what are you saying?",
        "Jack: That I don't trust coincidences, Craig, especially when you're involved.",
        "Teri: Do you think I'm part of some kind of conspiracy here?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my. Jack, you're so wrong about that.",

        "Jack: Hey, Sweetie. Check you out. Nice apron.",
        "Sage: Isn't this great? Teri's gonna live with us, and she's gonna teach me how to cook, and I'm gonna take her horseback riding.",

        "Riley: Then why are you drinking coffee instead of sleeping?",
        "Alison: 'Cause after work, uh, Casey took me out on a date. It was very sweet. He, uh, laid out a picnic on the roof of the hospital.",
        "Riley: Whoa. I didn't know he had the, uh -- the romantic streak in him.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was romantic. It really was. Starting to feel like we're getting back to where we used to be, you know, before we broke up. And then he got --",
        "Riley: And then he got a phone call from home, and he had to leave.",
        "Alison: Do you know why his mom called? What happened?",
        "Riley: What did Casey say?",
        "Alison: He just said that he had to go. I was just hoping that it wasn't a catastrophic event, you know, so that'd he come back, and we could pick up where we left off.",
        "Riley: Right. Okay, so now I get the whole coffee thing.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Alison: Yeah. So, will you tell me about it? I mean, did Casey's mom call because of me? Because I know she tries to like me --",
        "Riley: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not -- it has nothing to do with you. It's me. Your date got shot to hell, and I'm to blame.",
        "Casey: You're way off about this.",
        "Tom: I just don't want to discuss this with you. I mean, it's already awkward enough. I just believe that things will be better between your mother and me when Riley's gone.",
        "Casey: Mom's never gonna forgive you.",
        "Tom: So you think he means that much to her?",
        "Casey: Well, you remember how she was feeling when he showed up, how depressed she was.",
        "Tom: That's because we'd lost Adam.",
        "Casey: Right. But since Riley's been living here, she's been 100 times better. It might be just a coincidence, but I think she associates, uh, Riley with Adam. And if you send him away, she's gonna be crushed. And then on top of that, she's just gonna be mad at you.",
        "Tom: I've let that guy stay in my house for weeks and haven't said a word. I've been beyond patient.",
        "Casey: And Mom lives here, too. And if you get rid of someone she cares about, she's gonna feel like she's being punished for something she didn't do.",
        "Tom: So you think I should let Riley stay?",
        "Casey: I think if you're worried about your marriage, you should talk to your wife.",

        "Sage: Why can't Teri live with us? She said she wanted to.",

        "Sage: But all my stuff is here, and I want to wait for Mom to get home.",
        "Jack: Yes, and when your mom's well enough to get back, then we can revisit the situation. But right now, I need you to come with me.",
        "Sage: But Dad --",

        "Teri: You know, that sounds pretty cool, living on a real farm. Think of the great food you can make.",
        "Sage: But I don't know how to make anything. You were gonna teach me.",
        "Teri: I still can. We can e-mail each other, and I'll give you my phone number, and you can call me anytime. We can still be friends, Sage.",
        "Jack: Honey, everything's gonna be fine. You'll see.",

        "Janet: I am so psyched to have you here. I actually made lasagna, 'cause I know how much you like it.",
        "Sage: I'm not hungry. I just want to go to my room.",
        "Janet: Well, that went well.",
        "Jack: Would have gone better if Craig didn't butt in.",

        "Jack: You know that waitress I told you about?",
        "Janet: Yeah, the one who found Sage at the train station, took her home.",
        "Jack: Yes. Her name is Teri, and Craig decided to hire her as the new live-in babysitter. I knew that Sage wouldn't be excited about moving here, but now she's -- she's crushed because she can't spend every waking moment with her new best friend.",
        "Janet: Well, I mean, if Sage really likes her.",
        "Jack: I don't know anything about this woman, though, Janet! Come on!",
        "Janet: You're a cop, Honey! Why don't you have her checked out?",
        "Jack: For all I know, Craig just set this whole thing up so that this Teri woman could sweep in and make some kind of dramatic rescue.",
        "Janet: Okay, now what, is Craig a psychic? He knew exactly the moment that Sage was gonna run off, and so had Teri at the train station at that exact moment.",
        "Jack: I just find it weird that this woman shows up out of nowhere.",
        "Janet: Didn't Craig give her his card? I'm just saying, she could be perfectly nice.",
        "Jack: Even if she is, I'm not trusting my kids with a total stranger. I don't even know the woman's last name.",

        "Craig: I can still try and get you something at Metro if you want to stay in Oakdale.",

        "Rosanna: Well, thank you for being so wonderful to Sage.",
        "Teri: She's a great kid. I forgot to give her my number, and I told her she could call me anytime.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, why don't you just give it to me? I'll make sure she gets it.",
        "Teri: You know, I'd really like to give it to her myself. Do you have directions to where she's staying?",
        "Rosanna: Um, yeah, sure.",
        "Craig: I'd offer to drive you myself, but --",

        "Margo: Well, yeah. He sent me through this hell for nothing.",
        "Casey: You should be flattered.",
        "Margo: Flattered? How could I be flattered? He thinks I'm having an affair with a kid who's young enough -- who is my son. How do you find that flattering?",
        "Casey: How selfish can you be?",
        "Margo: What? I beg your pardon. What?",
        "Casey: Dad thinks Adam is dead, but obviously he's not. You get to see him every day. So you're cooking now, you're laughing, you're loving life because you get to see your son. As far as Dad's concerned, he's losing two people here, Adam and you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I bet you think you're real smart.",
        "Casey: No, no, no. I -- I think I'm really lucky to have parents that care enough to be jealous. So go give him some love or something.",

        "Alison: Wow. I knew you and Casey had issues, but Tom?",
        "Riley: Yeah, well, Tom hasn't exactly been friendly towards me. It's more along the lines of he's tolerated me being there.",
        "Alison: Well, how do you feel about leaving town?",
        "Riley: I like it here. I mean, I like Oakdale. It feels like home. You know, and Margo has been great.",
        "Alison: Well, you've been good for her, too.",
        "Riley: I hope so.",
        "Alison: She's been so hopeful lately. And after Adam died, she was devastated. You helped her through that. And in a way, I think you did the same thing for Casey.",
        "Riley: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Casey was so, so mad at his brother. They'd had this huge fight, and then Adam just disappeared for a long time.",
        "Riley: So I've heard.",
        "Alison: So when Adam died, the only thing Casey could think about were all the things that he never said to him, that everything between them would never be worked out. You know, maybe that's why he resented you so much at the beginning -- because you got to hang out with Adam before he died, and Casey will never get that chance again.",
        "Riley: Do you always do this?",
        "Alison: Do what?",
        "Riley: Make people feel better.",
        "Alison: I'm a nurse. It's my job. So, why are you gonna leave town if you don't want to?",
        "Riley: Why don't I -- I get my own place do you mean?",
        "Alison: Yeah. You could find like someplace cheap in the area, and then you could still see Margo and Casey, and Tom would have nothing to say about it.",
        "Riley: It's complicated.",
        "Alison: Complicated how?",
        "Riley: I'm more than just a friend of the family.",

        "Riley: Dude, it was a weak moment.",
        "Casey: Just keep your mouth shut. You know, I fixed things at home.",
        "Riley: You really went to bat for me?",
        "Casey: No, my mom made me. But the bottom line is you're not gonna have to leave.",
        "Riley: How'd you swing that?",
        "Casey: Turns out it was a big misunderstanding. My dad got the wrong idea about you two.",

        "Riley: Thanks, Casey. I -- I really appreciate this. You know, I'm gonna go home and unpack.",
        "Casey: No. I -- just go to the movies or something and give it -- give it a couple hours.",
        "Riley: Why?",
        "Casey: Mom's trying to convince Dad that there's no one else in her life except him.",

        "Casey: That's what I want if you do.",
        "Alison: I do.",
        "Casey: Oh.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",

        "Craig: Hiring Teri was a great idea, but Jack had to be a jerk about it.",
        "Rosanna: Look, you know, maybe Jack was right to doubt my mothering skills. I -- I can't cook. I mean, the kids hate my cooking. Sage ran away.",
        "Craig: All you need is a little practice.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm hopeless, really. I was raised to run a major corporation, not a family. Maybe I just don't have the magic touch when it comes to children.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't think my son would agree with that. Johnny likes you.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not responsible for Johnny. Listen, I think, uh, you better go before Jack \"Swings by\" on one of his \"Surprise\" visits.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Rosanna: You know, Craig, I got to say, um, I'm -- grateful to you for trying.",
        "Craig: Are you?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah, I am. I mean, I didn't really like the way you went about it, but I -- I did think that it would have been a good thing for Teri to be here for Sage.",
        "Craig: Huh. Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Craig: Well, it's been a long day. Uh, Teri never did finish making that dinner. Are you hungry?",
        "Rosanna: Are you asking me out?",
        "Craig: No, I'm asking if you want some food.",
        "Rosanna: I'd rather not.",
        "Craig: Even now you still think of me as the enemy.",
        "Rosanna: No. But you're not my friend either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: Teri!",
        "Teri: Hey. Just glad I found the right place.",
        "Sage: What are you doing here?",
        "Teri: I forgot to give you my number.",
        "Sage: You really meant it? I can call you anytime?",
        "Teri: Absolutely. Here's my number, and you've got my e-mail. So we're golden. That's all we need to be friends for life.",
        "Jack: Sage. Hey, Honey, we're gonna sit down for dinner. You should really eat -- something. What are you doing here?",
        "Teri: I came by to see Sage.",
        "Sage: She was giving me her number so I can call her anytime.",
        "Jack: And why would you do that? Are you -- are you stalking my daughter?",
        "Teri: Of course not.",
        "Sage: Dad!",
        "Jack: How would you even know how to find us?",
        "Teri: I got the address from Rosanna.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Teri: Y -- I'm just trying to be nice here, okay? I -- I don't deserve this kind of attitude.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Janet: Hey. What's going on out here? Oh, my God. Teresa?",
        "Teri: Janet?",
        "Jack: You know her?",
        "Janet: She's my baby sister. Oh!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Janet: All this talk about family, and the only one you really care about is yours.",
        "Teri: I got a train to catch.",
        "Craig: You're just letting her walk away, your wife's long-lost sister?",
        "Luke: You don't want me working for Damian, either?",
        "Lily: No, I don't.",
        "Damian: You didn't agree before, Lily, not until you saw me kissing Meg. Why don't you admit this is because you're jealous?"
