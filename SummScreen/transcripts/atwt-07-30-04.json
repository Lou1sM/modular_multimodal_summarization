        "Hal: He's --",
        "Carly: I can't do this. I can't live without him.",
        "Hal: I don't know if I can live without my best friend. And I know that you want to jump in that river right now, but we have to keep on living, Carly. And Jack will help us. He'll help you, he'll help me, he'll help Parker, and he'll help Sage. He will.",
        "Carly: They need him. They need him, I need him. I need him!",
        "Hal: He'll give you strength --",
        "Carly: No, no, he is my strength, Hal. I can't --",
        "Hal: I know you, Carly. You're one of the toughest women that I know --",
        "Carly: No, not without him. I'm not, I'm not!",
        "Hal: Listen to me -- you're a Mom now! You have two wonderful kids. You have to be strong for them now, Carly. Your tears -- your tears will scare them. They need you to be strong now. They need to feel safe, now more than ever.",
        "Carly: I don't want to scare my kids.",
        "Hal: I know you don't. Now Parker's -- he's old enough. He'll understand.",

        "Hal: I'll come with you. We'll tell him together. And I'll stay -- I'll stay as long as it takes, okay? Come on.",
        "Carly: I can't leave him here.",
        "Hal: Carly, honey, look at me. You're not leaving him here. Jack's somewhere far, far away, and he's in no pain. But he will help Parker, and he'll help you. And he'll help me. I don't know how. And don't ask me about god's plan or why any of this is fair, Carly, because I don't know. There's only one thing that I know. We have to go talk to our little boy, and we have to make him understand that life is damn unfair sometimes. And we have to make him understand that somehow, Jack will live in him as he will live in the rest of us that love him. And we have to make him understand what we believe -- that good men, men like Jack Snyder, they never leave their families behind, not even in death.",

        "Sierra: And hearing the surf?",
        "Alan: You in my arms.",

        "Wade: Does it really matter? The girl's home safe, bill's been paid. You want a cut? Here, I owe ya. Take it to the clubs. Go to Mexico, better yet. They got women down there? They'll do anything.",

        "Sierra: I told you not to let her out of your sight. Your apologies will not bring Lucy back, nor keep her safe. Now you go out there and you find her, do you understand me? You go talk to people at the Lakeview. You go to Metro, you go to Java, you go anywhere you can to find her, do you understand?",
        "Alan: Sierra, she's all right.",
        "Sierra: You don't know that!",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, Lucy's smart and resourceful. My guess is she gave the bodyguard the slip.",
        "Sierra: Then where is she?",

        "Emma: Well, I -- I was in the kitchen for about five minutes. And I came in, and he wasn't here. I looked upstairs, I looked out -- and then you came home -- I guess it's been about 20 minutes, a half an hour --",
        "Hal: Okay, he couldn't have gotten that far.",
        "Emma: I'm gonna call Holden.",

        "Barbara: But if you're in that office, I'm gonna be worried about you and how you're gonna react to what Dr. Jones has to say.",
        "Paul: We can handle whatever he has to say.",
        "Jennifer: Absolutely.",
        "Barbara: I know this is hard for you, because you're not parents. But I'm not trying to interfere in your lives. I just don't know how to stop protecting you.",

        "Barbara: No, you don't. Not completely. I just know it's gonna be a lot easier on me knowing that you're here.",

        "Driver: Shall we?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I tried him at home, I tried his cell, now I'm trying his paging service. If he's in the hospital -- what are you doing?",
        "Jennifer: We can't call Walker. Mom has a right to do this her way.",
        "Paul: Mom has a right to do whatever she wants. I reserve the right to not believe her.",
        "Jennifer: You think she's lying?",
        "Paul: She's up to something. I'm not gonna sit around and wait for another Barbara Ryan grand finale. If we're not here for Mom's health, then we're here because of you or me, maybe even Jordan and Rosanna.",

        "Rosanna: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Jordan: Well, yes and no.",
        "Rosanna: It's about my price. It's about what I have to do if I want my child to call me Mommy for the rest of my life and keep the promises that I made to him. If I want that, I have to seduce you.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, Jennifer is no threat to you. I've already told you that I would never take Cabot away from you --",
        "Rosanna: Life takes things away from you, Jordan. Sometimes without bothering to ask. I just came from Carly's. Jack is missing, he's possibly dead --",
        "Jordan: God, that's horrible --",
        "Rosanna: And Carly feels like she just wants to die right now, right alongside him. And do you know how I know that? Because that's how I felt when Cabot was missing. And I can't go through that again, Jordan. I won't.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, he is perfectly fine. He's upstairs asleep.",
        "Rosanna: You're not listening to me! We don't get to fall in love with other people. We have to do what we're told and cherish what we get to keep! Jordan Rosanna, you don't have to sleep with me to keep Cabot.",

        "Jordan: No, he doesn't -- he can't force us to be together, Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: Yes, he can! Look at this -- he set up this whole scenario. Don't you realize, every time he has taken Cabot away from us? It's been a warning. He told me I have to make love to you or the next time he's gonna take Cabot for good.",

        "Rosanna: Barbara's in on it. She's terrified of James. She lied to get Jennifer and Paul out of town. And I know Paul is wonderful. I know he'd probably lay down his life for Cabot. But I doubt even that would stop James from trying to take our son!",
        "Jordan: Then look, he -- he will never hurt my son.",
        "Rosanna: What if he did this to you? What if he made you disappear, hmm? What if all those years ago, your mother defied James, and he put you in an orphanage? She could still be out there wondering where you are! Do you want to go through that for the next 20 years, wondering about your son? I don't! Defy James, it could happen.

        "Paul: She told him that she came here to New York on B.R.O. business.",

        "Paul: Hey, according to Walker, Mom had her follow up visit. She had an MRI, she had blood work done, she had a complete physical. And she got a clean bill of health. No sign of this tumor coming back. So Jen, still interested in playing fair? - Commander Kai! - Hi!",

        "Lucy: I don't want to talk to her.",
        "Dusty: She'll be right there. Hold on a sec. Take it. Take it. If I get locked up for obstruction, we don't get Wade. You want that? Do you want that? Take it.",
        "Lucy: Hi, Mom.",
        "Sierra: Lucy, thank God you're all right. Where are you?",
        "Lucy: It's really not important.",
        "Sierra: You know, you had us scared out of our minds. Your bodyguard said that you snuck out on him. I was so terrified that they had taken you.",
        "Lucy: I'm fine, Mom. Really, I know what I'm doing.",
        "Sierra: Listen, where are you, Luce? Alan and I are gonna come get you right now.",
        "Lucy: I'm with Dusty. And everything is under control. I just need you to trust me, okay? I will be home tomorrow -- the day after, latest. I love you, bye.",
        "Dusty: Call her back and tell her where you are.",
        "Lucy: You said it yourself. She'll just call the police, and what will that accomplish? If we're gonna go after Wade, you need time to get stronger.",
        "Dusty: Call her back, and tell her that you're on your way home.",
        "Lucy: No, because I'm not. And she'll just keep calling. And this way, we'll both have some peace, and you can get stronger.",
        "Dusty: As soon as I can get out of here, I'm gone.",
        "Lucy: We both are. You can't get rid of me, Dusty. Stop trying.",

        "Jordan: Rosanna, having sex just because James ordered it is sick. I mean, not that -- you're a beautiful woman.",
        "Rosanna: I know what you're saying. Thank you very much. I know, and I don't want to sleep with you either. But I don't know what else to do. So if you have some other suggestions, I would really love to hear them, because losing Cabot is not an option.",

        "Paul: No, just enough facts to make it interesting. Look, you love Mom. I know that. I love her, too, but something is not right here. You sense it, too. I can tell. Look, Jen, isn't it better to know everything up front than to wait for the worst to happen? 'Cause with Mom, the worst always does happen.",

        "Hal: Are you sure?",

        "Hal: Carly, run out and see if anything else is missing. I'll call in about the bike. He couldn't have gotten far.",
        "Emma: Oh, I feel so terrible about this.",
        "Hal: We'll find him, Emma. We'll find him. Margo, listen. We know that parker left on his bike. It is black with a red and yellow design on it. It's got a 15-inch wheel, and it's got a reflector on the back. We don't know which way he headed, just add it to the alert and make sure they call it in, whether they find it with Parker or without him.",
        "Carly: Hal! He took his inner tube. We just bought it for the community pool.",
        "Hal: Emma, did Parker overhear anything about Jack and the river?",
