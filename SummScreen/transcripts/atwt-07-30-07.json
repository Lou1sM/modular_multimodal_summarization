Aaron has to take a new waitress under his wing, but he is side tracked when he sees Allison leaving a note for Dusty, as they have another fight. Holden finds Craig making breakfast for Meg and Parker. Barbara arrives to find Paul unconscious; she pleads with him to come back to the people that love him. She tells Paul that she has good news; Will and Gwen are having a baby. Paul starts to dream of Meg locked in a room he can't get into, and then Craig being there. Paul has a slight reaction, which thrills Barbara because she is sure he will regain consciousness. Craig takes a reluctant Parker fishing. Meg and Holden talk about Craig's motives for being there. Allison tells Aaron to avoid her from now on. An angry Aaron shatters a glass, but when the manager of the bar sees the broken glass, the waitress takes the blame. The doctor doesn't want Barbara to get her hopes up, but she won't give up. Rosanna shows up in Paul's dream and she tells him it is too late for her to go home. Paul promises to take her with him because he is getting out of this. Parker tells Craig he is not falling for his act; he is only trying to be his friend to impress Meg and he compares him to Paul in a not so flattering light, which seems to affect Craig. Craig reminisces with Meg of his past with his kids; Meg is moved, but then she wants to talk about his motives. Dusty doesn't get why Allison isn't taking his help? Allison explains that she has to do it on her own. Aaron already thinks she is his kept woman. She needs to stand on her own feet. Dusty offers to talk with Aaron, but Allison convinces him to let her handle things on her own from now on. Dusty decides to back off and says goodbye. Paul gets through the door in his dream, turns around to find Rosanna, but she is gone and then he wakes up; Barbara is elated. Aaron admits to having family and relationship problems, but he thinks it is time to let go. Meg and Craig get emotional when she wants him to stop acting like he thinks she wants him to act. She wants him to stop doing all the right things and saying all the right things. When she starts to break down, Craig comforts her and pulls her into a kiss. Paul wakes up and Barbara tells him where he is. He asks about Rosanna, but Barbara thinks he is just confused over a dream and tells him so. She wants him to save his strength and get healthier so she can take him home. Paul smiles; he is going home to Meg. Barbara frowns."

        "Manager: What are you doing here?",
        "Aaron: I traded shifts with Roberto. I had this family emergency --",
        "Manager: Next time, ask first. Okay, this is Sofie, our new cocktail waitress.",
        "Aaron: Hi, Aaron Snyder.",
        "Sofie: Nice to meet you.",
        "Manager: You think you can handle showing her the basics?",
        "Aaron: Sure.",
        "Sofie: Wow. Friendly boss.",
        "Aaron: You'll be fine. Don't worry.",
        "Sofie: I'm counting on having a good teacher.",
        "Aaron: You've done this before?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I waitressed at a diner.",
        "Aaron: Okay, well it's not much different. When you bring your order to the service bar, it's your job to get the glasses out that the bartender will need.",
        "Sofie: Didn't have breakfast. I'm starving.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well you might as well have the whole think now. I have to toss 'em now that you touched them. Excuse me.",
        "Sofie: Sorry. I guess I'm not at the diner anymore.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Sofie: Sorry again.",
        "Aaron: It's all right.",
        "Sofie: So can you show me where to change and stash my stuff?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, sure. Follow me.",
        "Alison: Can you please make sure Dusty Donovan gets this?",
        "Desk clerk: Sure.",
        "Alison: Do you think he'll check his mail this morning? I don't really want that sitting around.",
        "Aaron: Why not? What's in there? Keys to your new place?",
        "Alison: Actually --",
        "Aaron: I thought you left your mom's for your independence. So if you're letting Dusty pay your rent or something --",
        "Alison: You have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Aaron: Well, I know you're hanging out here, you know, leaving a note for Dusty. And I know that you're trying to keep it a secret. But you're pretty good at that, aren't you, Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Meg: Have you been out all night?",
        "Holden: Yeah, not that it did any good.",
        "Meg: How's Jack?",
        "Holden: Stable.",
        "Meg: Mama said they had to give him CPR. Is he breathing unassisted? Have they done a neuro assessment yet?",
        "Holden: Uh, you know what, you know all the right questions to ask, so why don't you just call the hospital?",
        "Meg: Okay, I'll call them in a little bit. So what about J.J?",
        "Holden: Nothing new.",
        "Meg: You must be exhausted.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I am.",
        "Meg: Holden, before you go inside --",
        "Craig: Oh, hey, good morning, Holden. Throw on some pancakes for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Dr. Voss, I can't thank you enough for everything you've done. Not only finding my son and identifying him but notifying me as well.",
        "Dr. Voss: I'm just glad you were able to get here so quickly.",
        "Barbara: And tell me, has there been any change in his condition since we spoke yesterday?",
        "Dr. Voss: I'm afraid not.",
        "Barbara: But you said that my presence, hearing my voice, would make a difference in his recovery --",
        "Dr. Voss: Yes, that's my hope. But --",
        "Barbara: Oh, Honey. Everything's going to be okay now. Everything's going to be okay. Just squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand so you know that I'm here. Squeeze my -- Paul? Paul?",
        "Barbara: Doctor, why isn't he responding?",
        "Dr. Voss: As I told you, your son's suffered serious head trauma.",
        "Barbara: But you said that even in a coma, he could hear me.",
        "Dr. Voss: I said that it was our hope that he would react to the stimulus of your voice.",
        "Barbara: What else can I do?",
        "Dr. Voss: It's good to think positively.",
        "Barbara: Don't patronize me. I understand how serious his condition is.",
        "Dr. Voss: In addition to all his other injuries he's fighting a serious infection. He has a high fever.",
        "Barbara: I can tell that just by holding his hand.",
        "Dr. Voss: Ms. Ryan, we've got him on several broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, he might not be strong enough to fight the infection.",
        "Barbara: How many people do you know who have survived what he's survived?",
        "Dr. Voss: None.",
        "Barbara: Okay. So he'll survive this little bug, too. Just tell me that when he gets through this and he wakes up, there won't be any permanent brain damage.",
        "Dr. Voss: We haven't been able to fully assess the extent of his impairment. But I'm going to be honest with you -- the longer he remains unresponsive, the more likely it is we're looking at a persistent vegetative state.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. You don't listen to him, okay? You don't listen to him, you don't listen to anything that you've heard here. And you forget about everything that brought you to this place. You just think about your family -- who needs you, Paul. Think about all the people who love you. I can't believe I have you back. Wait till your brother hears. Wait till he hears. And there's good news. Will has good news. You're gonna be an uncle again. Will and Gwen are gonna have a baby --",
        "[Barbara's words echoing]",
        "Barbara: Another quote-unquote miracle, Paul. What do you say to that?",
        "[Paul dreaming]",
        "Paul: Meg! Meg? Meg, can you hear me? Meg, I'm right here. Turn around. Don't cry. Don't. I'm here. I'm alive!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul groans]",
        "Barbara: Paul? Paul. Dr. Voss! Somebody, please! I think my son is waking up! Paul? Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Parker: So when can I see Jack?",
        "Holden: A little bit later. Your mom wants me to take you and Sage over, during visiting hours.",
        "Parker: How long is he gonna be in the hospital?",
        "Holden: Well, I'm not so sure about that yet. But he's very anxious to get out of there and start looking for J.J. again.",
        "Parker: So you don't think J.J.'s going to be found any time soon?",
        "Meg: Holden didn't say that.",
        "Parker: But there aren't any new leads.",
        "Holden: No, there's nothing new yet -- but I can tell you this much, there were a lot of people out there last night, handing out fliers and knocking on doors.",
        "Parker: I just don't get it. I mean, who'd want to take J.J.?",
        "Holden: I don't know, Parker. I wish I could answer that. But in the meantime, I don't want you to be afraid the something like this might happen to you.",
        "Parker: What if it's someone trying to get back at my mom for something she did a long time ago? Or Jack -- a criminal he put away? I mean, the kidnappers, they tried to blow him up.",
        "Meg: Because Jack came so close to finding them.",
        "Holden: You know what? We're trying to find him again. Somebody has to have seen the kidnappers take J.J. from the construction site.",
        "Parker: I hope.",
        "Craig: Hey, Parker, there's something wrong with my pancakes?",
        "Parker: I'm not hungry. Look, I want to go out and help look for J.J., too.",
        "Holden: I wish I could let you do that. But Jack, he would never allow that.",
        "Craig: Hey, you know what, Parker? Maybe -- maybe you could do me a favor. I don't know, take me out to the pond, drop a line in? You know, maybe we could have fish for dinner.",
        "Parker: I hate fish.",
        "Meg: Might help to get out of the house.",
        "Parker: If I'm allowed.",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure. In fact, I think it might be a go idea. It might help pass the time.",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Craig: Okay, so -- so what're you guys using for bait these days at the Snyder pond?",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Holden: For?",
        "Meg: For not freaking out about Craig being here. At least not in front of Parker.",
        "Holden: What is he doing here exactly? Besides cooking, cleaning, and catching dinner with his bare hands?",
        "Meg: I'm a mess, Holden, in case you haven't noticed. And whatever Craig's done -- now. And Parker.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Meg: I know you don't believe Craig could possibly be helping anything or anyone right now.",
        "Holden: It really doesn't matter what I believe. The question is -- do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: You know, I can figure out where to put my stuff. I'll see you back at the bar in a few, okay?",
        "Aaron: Sure.",
        "Alison: For someone who made it extremely clear how I was the just reason you wanted to stay in town -- you seem to be a little obsessed with showing up wherever I go.",
        "Aaron: I work here.",
        "Alison: Right. And you were spying on me with Jesse because? And how'd you even know that I moved out of my mom's place?",
        "Aaron: 'Cause Susan told me. She asked me to check up on you, and that's exactly what I did.",
        "Alison: Great.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, and that's when I saw you taking money from Dusty. At Al's.",
        "Alison: Wow, you're everywhere, aren't you? Kind of like superman, except you're not running to anyone's rescue.",
        "Aaron: No, no. That would be Superman Dusty. But ask yourself this. What does he get out of helping you?",
        "Alison: Did you really just say that? I've got to go to work.",
        "Aaron: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait.",
        "Alison: You judge everybody, don't you? Why don't you look at yourself, Aaron? Yeah, I slept with Dusty. Before he was my sister's boyfriend. Before you even came back into town. So I didn't tell you. Did you tell me about every girl you were with when we were apart?",
        "Aaron: That's completely different.",
        "Alison: Oh whatever. You know, you can stop worrying about me. Because I'm not your problem anymore.",
        "Aaron: Well, excuse me for trying to help you.",
        "Alison: I don't want your help. And I don't need your help. And you're not helping anyone anyway! Look, let's not make this harder than it already is. Just leave me alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Desk clerk: Oh, Mr. Donovan. There's an envelope that was left here for you.",
        "Dusty: Thank you. Who's it from?",
        "Desk clerk: A young woman dropped it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hey -- careful, you're going to cut yourself. Let me get the broom and dustpan. Where are the broom and dustpan?",
        "Aaron: Forget it, I got it.",
        "Manager: Hey, you're making me regret accepting your unresignation.",
        "Aaron: Well you can always fire me.",
        "Sofie: Please don't blame him. Aaron didn't break that glass. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey, Al.",
        "Alison: Oh, hey, are you following me, too? For somebody with no friends, I seem to be mighty popular.",
        "Dusty: I don't get it. You don't want help, you don't want rehab, you don't want to be dependent on anyone.",
        "Alison: Shh, what are you doing?",
        "Dusty: You got nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Alison: I've got everything to be ashamed of. What do you want, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I gave you that money for a security deposit on a place. What's the problem?",
        "Alison: Do you know why I need to do this by myself, Dusty? I have a sister who just left town because she couldn't even stand to look at me. I've been with dozens of men. All of them giving me attention for the wrong reasons. Yourself included. Maybe I don't need to prove anything to the world, but I need to prove to myself that my life is worth living. Starting by doing the most basic thing, taking care of me.",
        "Dusty: You detoxed all by yourself. Do you know what a huge accomplishment that is?",
        "Alison: I detoxed because you and Emily stood over me and forced me to. And I've almost undone all your hard work about a dozen times already.",
        "Dusty: But you haven't.",
        "Alison: But I still might.",
        "Dusty: That's why you need a support system.",
        "Alison: The only people supporting me are doing it because they feel obligated or guilty. And that's no good",
        "Dusty: What about the people who care about you?",
        "Alison: Who? There's nobody in the world who cares about me for who I really am. And I don't blame them.",
        "Dusty: You're wrong about that.",
        "Alison: No. I feel like I haven't done a single thing in my life that I can be proud of. And I can't tell you how much I want that to change. Aaron already thinks I'm you whore. Let's not make him right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey -- you okay?",
        "Meg: I just feel like I'm losing my mind.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, I think we all feel a little bit like that right now.",
        "Meg: Holden, look. I know you thought it was crazy for me to go through with marrying Craig. And you were right. Because of me, Paul's dead.",
        "Holden: No, Craig is the reason Paul's dead. You do know that, don't you.",
        "Meg: No, no. Here's what nobody seems to understand. I was there. I saw Craig's face when Paul went over that cliff. He looked exactly like the way I feel inside. So maybe -- is it so hard for me to believe that maybe Craig's life could've changed at that moment? Because mine sure did.",
        "Holden: I know it did.",
        "Meg: Or -- maybe Craig's exactly the same person he always was. You know, I have to be honest with myself, I was attracted to him at one point -- when I found out what he really was, I knew I could never be with him.",
        "Holden: So has that changed?",
        "Meg: It's just -- I just feel like he's the only person in this world that kind of gets the way I'm feeling right now. When he reached out his hand to help Paul \u0096 all he's done for me. And whatever he's done and whatever I feel, I'm grateful for that.",
        "Holden: Well, what ever his motives might be, if he was able to get you and Parker through the night, then I'm not going to argue.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Holden: You don't have to figure everything out right now you know that.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I just keep thinking -- what would Paul say if he could see me right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Paul, listen. You're doing great, Honey. You're doing great. Come on, come back to us. Wake up. It's a good sign, isn't it, Doctor?",
        "Dr. Voss: I'd like to run another EEG --",
        "Barbara: I'm not imagining things, am I?",
        "Dr. Voss: No, your son definitely seems more alert. But it's hard to know where this agitation is coming from. Unless it's a reaction to your presence.",
        "Barbara: Why would he be agitated by my presence?",
        "Dr. Voss: Exactly. Which is why I'm inclined to believe his response could be a simple neurological reflex.",
        "Barbara: Has he responded like this since he's been here?",
        "Dr. Voss: No, but --",
        "Barbara: Well, then that's good. It means he could be coming out of the coma.",
        "Dr. Voss: He could. But I must caution you against getting your hopes up. Paul's long-term prognosis -- it is not good.",
        "Barbara: I know that. But with all due respect, I didn't come here to watch my son die. I did not come here to say good-bye and put his affairs in order. I came to bring him back to us. So don't you dare tell me not to hope!",
        "[Paul dreaming]",
        "Paul: You stay the hell away from her, Craig! You think you've won, but you haven't! I'm alive! I'm alive! Let me in! Can somebody help me, please? I'm locked out, I need to get into this room!",
        "Rosanna: Hey. I know how it feels. You knock, and you call out, and you try to get somebody to hear you, but they never do. I've tried, too -- so many times.",
        "Paul: Rosanna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You don't know my son, Dr. Voss. If you did, you would realize that your statistics, your clinical observations mean nothing. My son is not an ordinary person. He sees things that other people don't see. He survives things that other people can't survive. With Paul, anything is possible.",
        "[Paul dreaming]",
        "Paul: Rosanna -- Rosanna. My God. I never thought I'd see you again. You do remember me, don't you?",
        "Rosanna: Oh --Paul -- yes, I do remember you. I remember loving you.",
        "Paul: And I loved you, too.",
        "Rosanna: Past tense?",
        "Paul: Do you know everything that's happened since you -- well, since you left us?",
        "Rosanna: Why don't you tell me?",
        "Paul: Where are we?",
        "Rosanna: We, we're in the same place, you and I. Someplace between life and death.",
        "Paul: So you are alive then?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if you can call this living. There's nowhere to go. And all the doors are locked.",
        "Paul: But there has to be a key. Right? There must be some reason we're here.",
        "Rosanna: What reason do you think it could be, Paul?",
        "Paul: I don't know. But we'll find out. I just feel like we have to get out of here.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's impossible, sorry.",
        "Paul: You never give up on anything. Why would you start now? Wait a minute, that's -- that's me in there with my mother? What happened to --?",
        "Rosanna: Who?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter. Rosanna, I promise you, I'm gonna get both of us out of here. Wherever we are.",
        "Rosanna: Look, that's your life in there, not mine.",
        "Paul: But you're a part of my life. At least you were.",
        "Rosanna: I hope that you can go back. And I wish I could, too. I barely remember my life. Or what's left of it.",
        "Paul: You shouldn't say that. You -- you wound up here because you tried to right a terrible wrong. And you succeeded, you know that right? Do you have any idea how strong you are?",
        "Rosanna: Well, not anymore. I've been here too long. It's too late for me.",
        "Paul: No. You're coming with me -- whether you like it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Machine beeping rapidly]",
        "Barbara: Doctor, what's happening? What's happening?",
        "Dr. Voss: Paul's blood pressure is rising rapidly. His heart is racing.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Dr. Voss: I reaction to a number of things. The fever, the fluids, the general stress his body is under --",
        "Barbara: Okay. You, listen to me. You listen to me, okay. I'm right here. I can hear you breathing. I can feel you trying to stay alive. And you can do it. You've done it before. Come on, Paul. Come back to us. Come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Are you happy now? No fish, after all.",
        "Parker: I really don't get the point of throwing them back.",
        "Craig: The fish get to live?",
        "Parker: After you torture them.",
        "Craig: Well, it beats killing them, gutting them, cleaning them, doesn't it? You know, my son Bryant and I, we caught a largemouth bass once in your grandma's pond. That one we did not put back. It was six, nine pounds --",
        "Parker: You're lying.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm exaggerating. It's not really the same thing. It's called a fish tale.",
        "Parker: Yeah. J.J., he caught this trout once, and he told Sage that it was --",
        "Craig: What? What were you going to say?",
        "Parker: I wish Paul were here.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Parker: Maybe -- maybe he could even tell us where J.J. is. I mean, I wish I could still see stuff. Like Paul does.",
        "Craig: Yeah, he was gifted that way.",
        "Parker: Yeah, you know, you really don't have to pretend that you like him. I know that you hated him. And that he hated you.",
        "Craig: Fair enough.",
        "Parker: Is it because of Meg?",
        "Craig: Well, it actually goes back further than that. But I don't think that matters now.",
        "Parker: It matters to me. Is it because of Aunt Rosanna?",
        "Craig: Wow, tough questions here. Maybe I should call you Young Detective Munson?",
        "Parker: Well, you can call me whatever you want. And I'll call you whatever I want, too.",
        "Craig: Meaning?",
        "Parker: Meaning I know you're not my friend.",
        "Cig: I'm trying to be.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you're only doing that because of J.J. and because you want Meg to like you.",
        "Craig: You think so?",
        "Parker: Yeah, the whole buying me fries and cooking me pancakes -- I'm not 6 anymore. You can't bribe me with food, or anything else.",
        "Craig: I'm not trying to bribe you, son.",
        "Parker: Son? No. No, your son is dead. Just like Paul. Paul was my friend. Don't try to be him.",
        "Craig: No worries, Parker. I wouldn't dream of it.",
        "Holden: Parker? Hey, you ready to go to the hospital and see Jack?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Holden: All right, let's go. Thanks for the coffee.",
        "Meg: If I didn't already say thank you --",
        "Craig: You know, I barely made a dent in that long list of farm chores, let's get crackin' okay? It's been long time though, since I milked a cow.",
        "Meg: Craig -- Craig, the cows have already been milked, before dawn. Important to do it at the same time everyday because they get a little uncomfortable.",
        "Craig: I see. Okay.",
        "Meg: I'm sure you have better things to do. You have my corporation to run, after all. You know, time is money.",
        "Craig: Well, this is hardly a waste of my valuable time. You may underestimate yourself, Meg, but I'm sure there are a few things you could teach me about business.",
        "Meg: Really? Like what?",
        "Craig: Do you know how many life's lessons you must've learned just growing up on a farm? I think that maybe I could have some kind of team-building exercise here, you know?",
        "Meg: How many executives does it take to muck out a horse's stall?",
        "Craig: Yeah, something like that. And if -- if you're too afraid to get his hands dirty --",
        "Meg: Worker hands --",
        "Craig: Well, exactly. Then, you don't belong in business.",
        "Meg: That's what I've been trying to tell you.",
        "Craig: Ah, ah. But you see, you are willing to get your hands dirty. Clearly.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Craig: You know what I mean. You can do this, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know, I -- I once went to a team-building retreat when I was in nursing school. You did the whole circle trust thing. You know, and you fall back, one of your co-workers is supposed to catch you. Although, they dropped me.",
        "Craig: Let me catch you.",
        "Meg: You know what? I believe you. Let's just hope I don't live to regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron saw you leave that money. And now thinks I'm some sort of kept woman.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Alison: And he says you're gonna be expecting something in return.",
        "Dusty: He's being dramatic.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Especially since I gave back the money, too.",
        "Dusty: But why is he saying this stuff that to you he should know you better.",
        "Alison: Yeah, he should. Of course, I did try to get you in bed again after Vegas, so maybe he knows me better than I think.",
        "Dusty: You were drunk.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm supposed to be clean and sob, remember?",
        "Dusty: Did you tell him you threw the money back in my face?",
        "Alison: No, I didn't exactly say that. I didn't tell him that, no.",
        "Dusty: Well why not?",
        "Alison: It's none of his business. What's the point? Aaron's been here what? Three weeks? And he's already finding a dozen different reasons to think the worst of me.",
        "Dusty: He's acting like an idiot. You deserve respect from this guy. The guy who came back to town because he loves you so much.",
        "Alison: Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to go talk to Aaron.",
        "Alison: No, Dusty -- please don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry -- I guess I was just nervous -- trying to impress the boss on my first day. I'll be more careful next time, I promise.",
        "Aaron: You know, you didn't need to do that.",
        "Sofie: I just figured he'd be easier on me than you-- since I'm new and all. Since he was threatening to fire you earlier.",
        "Aaron: Well, thank you. I guess I owe you.",
        "Sofie: No, you don't. You've done a ton for me already. Did it help?",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Sofie: Breaking the glass. Feel better now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why shouldn't I talk to Aaron? You still care about him, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I do. But if you say anything, that's going to give him more reason to think you're in my life. And you're not",
        "Dusty: Then you talk to him. And set him straight. You're going to be here, you're going to run into him all the time.",
        "Alison: I know that. I just -- I hate the way he looks at me now. And there's nothing I can do or say that's going to change that. The time when we were young and innocent and thought we had our whole lives ahead of us -- it's gone, Dusty. And it's never coming back.",
        "Dusty: Come on. You're talking like you're 80 years old. You got your whole life a head of you.",
        "Alison: I hope so. But not with Aaron. The best thing I can do now is try to make myself not care what he thinks me. Or what I think of me.",
        "Dusty: Hey -- come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "Alison: I really gotta work, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I know your boss, come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "Alison: I just don't want to get in trouble.",

        "Meg: How could six pancakes make so many dishes?",
        "Craig: I have no idea. I should've just given the kid cereal.",
        "Meg: You know, I could do that, you know.",
        "Craig: Ah, it's all right. I made the mess, I'll clean it up.",
        "Meg: Your pancakes were delicious. I'm sorry no one was hungry.",
        "Craig: You know, I used to make Lucy and Bryant pancakes every Sunday, and I think I was just feeling a little nostalgic. I self-indulged. I should have been better off just asking Parker what he would like for breakfast.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe you should use Mama's gloves. You don't want dishpan hands.",
        "Craig: I've already got blood on my hands. What's a little pruning?",
        "Meg: Please don't joke about that.",
        "Craig: Wouldn't dream of it. You know what? Here, I'll get this, okay? Come on, I'm gonna do the drying. I know you didn't sleep last night. Go on, get out of here. Go put your head down.",
        "Meg: Well, did you get any rest?",
        "Craig: On that couch?",
        "Meg: What? Not comfortable?",
        "Craig: Do me a favor, when you do become a big corporate mogul, buy your mama a new couch.",
        "Meg: I'll have you know that I did make those slipcovers.",
        "Craig: Oh. I apologize.",
        "Meg: Mama's sentimental. She would never get rid of that couch.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well if you're sentimental about those slipcovers, we could bring them to Fairwinds. Or not.",
        "Meg: You don't have to stay, you know.",
        "Craig: I know. And I know that you would prefer it if I didn't. But there is a kidnapper out there and I don't feel that it's right to leave you and Parker alone.",
        "Meg: I see.",
        "Craig: I am sorry about last night.",
        "Meg: What about last night? You mean you trying to kiss me?",
        "Craig: Rest assured, that will never happen again.",
        "Meg: Sure it will. That's exactly what you want, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Ms. Ryan, why don't you take a little break? There's a cafeteria downstairs.",
        "Barbara: Why don't you back off! I know what you' trying to do. You're trying to get me away from my son.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Voss said you were on a plane all night. A little food, some rest could help.",
        "Barbara: Do you think some peanut butter crackers are going to take the edge off the fact that my son is in a coma? You listen to me. I didn't sacrifice half my life and most of my sanity trying to protect my son from his father, only to abandon him in this Godforsaken hospital in the middle of nowhere. Come on. Come on, come on. Come back to me, all right? I know you can do it. Come on, Paul. Come on. Show them what you're made of. Come back. Open your eyes. Try to open your eyes.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I shouldn't be here. Breakfast shifts are always the busiest.",
        "Dusty: Just give me a second. Your boss will understand.",
        "Alison: I'm lucky he gave me my job back once already. Meg Snyder asked for hers back, and he said no to her.",
        "Dusty: He obviously knows you're an outstanding waitress.",
        "Alison: Yeah or he has a soft spot for me because he saw my movie and thought I'd be good for business.",
        "Dusty: Why would you say something like that about yourself?",
        "Alison: You're right, you know? I'm upset because as much as I don't want to care what Aaron thinks about me -- I guess I always will. But, you know what they say -- have the serenity to accept the things you cannot change, etcetera.",
        "Dusty: I think it's better for everyone if I back off.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: If you do need anything, you know where to find me.",

        "Aaron: Well, congrats. You're going to fly solo soon.",
        "Sofie: We'll see.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Well, listen, I'm clocking out. Do you have any more questions?",
        "Sofie: Actually, I do. When you said you were having family problems -- are you sure you're ok?",
        "Aaron: I won't be breaking any glassware on your next shift, so -- don't worry.",
        "Sofie: Good. So -- not that it's any of my business, but that girl you were talking to in the lobby --",
        "Aaron: Yeah, she's not the reason I'm leaving early, if that's what you're thinking. Alison isn't family and she never will be.",
        "Sofie: So family troubles and relationship troubles.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, I couldn't call it a relationship, really. It's been over forever. It's finally time I let go.",

        "Meg: For starters, stop apologizing for things you're not sorry for.",
        "Craig: Fine, I'm not sorry that I tried to kiss you. I am sorry that it made you uncomfortable. Happy now?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Craig: Well, what else do you want me to say?",
        "Meg: I want you to stop saying what you know I want to hear.",
        "Craig: Such as?",
        "Meg: You'll leave me alone, you'll respect my grief, and you won't try to contest to the annulment, that business is strictly business --",
        "Craig: And you have a problem with this?",
        "Meg: The problem is that you don't. Look, I know I don't have a right to ask you for much of anything --",
        "Craig: Sure you do. You are my wife.",
        "Meg: Yeah. And I am what you want, aren't I?",
        "Craig: I think I have made that very clear, yes.",
        "Meg: And you'll just keep making yourself indispensable and wonderful and generous to me, until you start wearing me down so much I'm gonna start having babies with you",

        "Meg: It's a leap that we're even having this conversation.",
        "Craig: Agreed.",

        "Craig: Well, you know what, I'm having a really good time imagining that. Okay, you know what -- let's say you're right. Let's say this is all part of my big agenda to get the prize that is you. How am I doing?",
        "Meg: Are you kidding me?",
        "Craig: No. But Meg and Craig, that don't sound very good, does it? Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.",
        "Meg: A sign, no doubt.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see. We're quipping? I thought you didn't want to quip, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know what, you're right you're right. But I'm confused and I'm upset and I'm sleep-deprived and all my defenses are down.",
