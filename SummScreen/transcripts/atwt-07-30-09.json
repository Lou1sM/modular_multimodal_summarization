        "Meg and Damian are so happy after an incredible night of making love but Lily isn't so thrilled to see them kiss good-bye in the Lakeview lobby. Holden and Lily try to persuade Luke to work for Worldwide instead of Grimaldi shipping and Lily even persuades Damian to let Luke make his own decision. Damian tells Luke he can take whatever job offer he wants and Luke wants to work at Grimaldi shipping. Damian thinks Lily changed her mind about Luke working for him because she is jealous that he is now with Meg. Lily denies the allegation and reminds Damian their relationship ended a long time ago and she is happy with Holden. Lily tells Holden that Damian doesn't have a family of his own so he is trying to steal their family but Lily is determined to beat Damian at his own game.",
        "Jack is suspicious of Terri because he thinks that Craig hired her as part of one of his plans but because Terri's arrival is too much of a coincidence. Jack doesn't want Terri taking care of his kids but once but Janet defends Terri after she tells Jack Terri is her sister whom she hasn't seen since Terri was five years old. Janet is hurt that Jack doesn't trust Terri to take care of his children and she and Jack have a big fight. Parker and Sage are mad at Jack because they don't want to move into the farm they want to stay at their house. Jack later agrees to Craig's idea that Terri work at Metro so she can spend time with Janet and Sage and Janet is happy about that and her and Jack kiss and make up. Sage on the other hand is still mad at Jack because she wants to live at home and not the farm. Janet persuades Jack to let Sage be happy because she deserves a little happiness after all that she has been through lately. Jack brings Sage back home and agrees to let Terri be the kids' babysitter for the summer. Rosanna praises Craig for persuading Jack to change his mind and helping to honor Carly's wishes that the kids live at home while she is in rehab."

        "Jack: Wait a minute. The famous Teri, the waitress everyone loves, is your sister?",
        "Janet: Wait a minute. You were the babysitter Rosanna wanted to hire?",
        "Teri: Yeah, until this jerk said no.",
        "Jack: Charming.",
        "Janet: This jerk is my husband.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Sage: You never said Janet was your sister.",
        "Teri: I had no idea she was married to your dad.",
        "Jack: But you knew she was in Oakdale?",
        "Teri: Well, I knew she moved here, but I had no idea she stayed. We haven't talked in a while.",
        "Janet: 18 years.",
        "Sage: Teri, does this mean now you can stay?",
        "Teri: Oh, I don't think so, Sweetie.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. Why not?",
        "Teri: Well, for one thing, your husband here thinks I'm stalking his daughter.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on! That's ridiculous.",
        "Teri: Well, it didn't stop him from jumping down my throat. Is he always so sure he's right?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You are doing a bang-up job of caring for the kids, but Jack is -- territorial. He can't help but take over. It's a sickness.",
        "Rosanna: He just made me feel like a total failure.",
        "Craig: Well, look on the bright side. If he's got the kids, he won't be looking over your shoulder every minute.",
        "Rosanna: Carly wanted me to take care of the kids, and she wanted them to be here. That's what she wanted.",
        "Craig: It's okay. You'll make it up to her.",
        "Rosanna: How am I gonna do that?",
        "Craig: By turning our vitamin water business into a cash cow.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, which by some strange coincidence would put money in your pocket, too.",
        "Craig: My gosh. I think you're right.",
        "Parker: Hey, what a shock. Craig's here.",
        "Craig: Hey, nice to see you, too.",
        "Parker: Aunt Rosanna, is there anything to eat that hasn't been crawled over by bugs?",
        "Rosanna: Well, Parker, you don't have to worry anymore, because your healthy days are over. Your dad wants you and Sage to stay with him until your mom gets back.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. He wants to take care of you himself. Is that so strange?",
        "Craig: And we were this close to hiring that waitress from Chicago to come help out here.",
        "Parker: Teri?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. She came to Oakdale looking for a job, and it really just seemed like a perfect solution for everybody.",
        "Parker: What happened?",
        "Rosanna: Your dad said no.",
        "Parker: What's his problem?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, Sage is already there, so you'd better go upstairs and get packed.",
        "Parker: Now?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. He wants you there tonight.",
        "Parker: Well, you know what? I don't care what he wants. I'm not going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's nothing personal. I just -- I just don't want a total stranger looking after my kids.",
        "Janet: Oh, you know what? That's about as close as he gets to an apology.",
        "Teri: Glad you told me.",
        "Janet: I can't believe you're here! Ah!",
        "Jack: I hate to interrupt the love fest, but can I ask you a question?",
        "Janet: Sure. What is it?",
        "Jack: Did you know that Janet was in Oakdale?",
        "Teri: No. That guy Craig gave me his card. Uh, I was hoping he could help me find a job.",
        "Jack: But you knew she was here.",
        "Teri: Like I said, I didn't know she stayed.",
        "Janet: Isn't it amazing, Jack? It's like fate or something.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Jack: Yeah. Or something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, your father and I want to take you to dinner.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Lily: Don't act so surprised.",
        "Luke: Well, what's the occasion?",
        "Lily: No occasion. We just don't get to see you as much now that you've got your own place. You busy?",
        "Luke: Uh, well, I'm getting ready for my first day at work tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Well, you still have to eat, don't you?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Well, then, let us treat you to a nice dinner. And bring Noah, too.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I wish I could, but Noah's busy night and day with his film.",
        "Lily: Well, then, we're gonna have to settle just for you. See you soon. Luke's gonna join us for dinner.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Lily: Why do I feel like we're setting him up for an ambush?",
        "Holden: We're not. We're not at all. Besides, Noah will be there to protect them.",
        "Lily: No, Noah will not be there. It's just gonna be the three of us, which is gonna make him feel like we're pressuring him even more.",
        "Holden: No. We're just trying to give him another option.",
        "Lily: He's not gonna see it that way.",
        "Holden: I hope that once he sees we're on the same page, he'll rethink his decision.",
        "Lily: I agree with you that working at Worldwide is a much better place for him to learn about business. But he's gonna know that we have other motives. And we do.",
        "Holden: Damian said himself that he'll respect Luke's decision.",
        "Lily: Won't matter.",
        "Holden: It will if he keeps his word and doesn't make it personal.",
        "Lily: I tried to give him the heads-up, but he didn't return my call.",
        "Holden: Wasn't your fault.",
        "Lily: Well, he usually answers my calls.",
        "Holden: Well, maybe he's finally found something that he'd rather do more than talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: That was --",
        "Damian: Incredible!",
        "Meg: Ah, you took the words right out of my mouth. What time is it?",
        "Damian: I don't know. I don't care. What day is it?",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: I have no idea.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Damian: 7:30.",
        "Meg: Oh! I told Pam that I would pick up Eliza at 8:00.",
        "Damian: Oh, I'm sure they're both having a wonderful time.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah.",
        "Damian: They're not the only ones.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You know what? I should go get her.",
        "Damian: No, no, no, no, no. I think I have to ravish you again.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You know, that would be ravishing, but I am a mother as well as sex goddess.",
        "Damian: Just a few more minutes.",
        "Meg: No. It won't be.",
        "Damian: You're right. But I'll make it worth your while.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You already did. Oh!",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Oh, no, no. You don't have to get up.",
        "Damian: Yeah? What kind of gentlemen would let you walk out of here alone?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: The usual kind.",
        "Damian: Let me at least walk you down to the lobby.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You just want to keep me from leaving this hotel.",
        "Damian: Uh-huh. That's the plan.",
        "Meg: You know, my brother warned me about men like you. He actually warned me about you in particular.",
        "Damian: Aren't you glad you didn't listen to him?",
        "Meg: Mm! What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, yeah, I've barely seen Noah all week. I mean, when he's editing, it's like he disappears, and when we are together, he's always screening shots in his mind.",
        "Lily: Well, he's lucky that he's getting to do what he loves.",
        "Luke: I know. I'm just nervous that with me starting to work and him being so busy, we'll never see each other.",
        "Holden: That's what we want to talk to you about.",
        "Luke: Me and Noah?",
        "Holden: No. Damian.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I thought we've been over this.",
        "Holden: We have, but something new has come up.",
        "Luke: What's that?",
        "Holden: Look, it's no secret that we wanted you to go back to school. But that's not what you want. What you want is to learn a business.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Holden: We're just not sure that Grimaldi shipping is the best option for you. It's not a centralized company, the headquarters are in Malta, and there are a lot of people who make decisions there.",
        "Luke: You mean the Grimaldis.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Luke: Well, Damian's the C.E.O. he makes all the decisions, and he's here.",
        "Holden: That's true, but the way the company is structured, I just think it's gonna be very difficult for you to learn the business.",
        "Luke: Dad, what's your point?",
        "Holden: We think that you can learn a lot more about modern management in a company that's more local.",
        "Lily: Like Worldwide.",
        "Luke: Worldwide?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Your grandmother's gonna be running the company again while Dusty sorts out his legal issues. It would be great if she had someone that she trusted by her side.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. You're just trying to keep me away from Damian, again.",
        "Holden: That's not the reason.",
        "Luke: Oh, tell me that's not why Grandmother's going back to work.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: Are you gonna help me out here? Lily, don't you have anything to say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: You promised to behave.",
        "Damian: I tried.",
        "Meg: Well, try harder.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Damian: Do you know how much I want you?",
        "Meg: Everybody in this lobby knows.",
        "Damian: When will I see you again?",
        "Meg: Soon.",
        "Damian: Call me from your car.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Damian: 'Cause I'll miss you by then.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: No, you won't.",
        "Damian: I will. Promise I will.",
        "Meg: I have to go.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Damian: I miss you already.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily -- Lily?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: Are you all right?",
        "Lily: Uh, I'm fine.",
        "Holden: It seemed like you were a million miles away.",
        "Lily: I'm here.",
        "Holden: Are you gonna participate in this conversation or not?",
        "Lily: You know, I was thinking that Damian should be here with us.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: Well, yeah. Uh, you know, h -- he was just at the elevator. Uh, I'll go get him.",
        "Luke: What for?",
        "Lily: So we can all be on the same page.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I still can't believe you're here. Hey, are you hungry?",
        "Teri: After all these years, you're still a Ciccone.",
        "Janet: Well --",
        "Teri: In fact, is that Mama's lasagna I smell?",
        "Janet: Mm! I made it for Sage. It should cheer her up, because she was under the influence that Teresa the magic waitress wasn't gonna be able to stay. Let's catch up. Talk to me. What's been going on?",
        "Sage: I'm gonna go wait outside.",
        "Jack: Hey, Sweetheart. You okay?",
        "Sage: Do you think Teri just pretended to be my friend so that she could find Janet.",
        "Jack: Oh, Teri could have found Janet another way. I think Teri really likes you a lot.",
        "Sage: But she likes Janet more.",
        "Jack: Honey, they're sisters. And Teri didn't even know that Janet was here. She came by to say good-bye. Give me a minute. Hey, we're gonna go for a walk.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay. Uh, dinner will be ready in 10 minutes.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we'll be back.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Teri: What's going on?",
        "Janet: He's a really good guy, and he's a great husband.",
        "Teri: But?",
        "Janet: His kids make things complicated.",
        "Teri: It seems like it's his ex that makes things complicated.",
        "Janet: Oh, you have no idea. Do you remember Mrs. Fanucci?",
        "Teri: Ooh! That complicated?",
        "Janet: Well, no, no, no. Not quite, but -- but close.",
        "[Teri chuckles]",
        "Teri: It is so good to see you.",
        "Janet: Oh, it's so good to see you. Ooh! So, what took you so long?",
        "Teri: What do you mean?",
        "Janet: Well, you said that you knew I was here. Why did you wait so long to come find me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know, having Teri stay here with us and help out is a great idea.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. We thought so, too.",
        "Craig: Your father didn't agree.",
        "Parker: Well, you know what? If -- if he can decide that, then I'm deciding not to stay at the farm.",
        "Craig: Uh, that's not really how it works.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you know what it's gonna be like. He'll be all over me way worse than it is now.",
        "Craig: Well, it's kind of tough to imagine that.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I thought they didn't want me anywhere near Liberty, and now they want me to stay in the same house as her?",
        "Craig: I guess they trust you.",
        "Parker: I wouldn't. We started to be friends again, and if I'm around her all the time, who knows what's gonna happen?",
        "Craig: Teenage hormones. Wonderful thing.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, listen, I wish there was something we could do to help you. I do.",
        "Parker: Well, then, call my mom. Ask her to tell him that she wants us to stay here.",
        "Rosanna: Well, your dad already knows that that's what she wants, and she's not allowed to make phone calls right now.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Well, this sucks.",
        "Rosanna: I'm really sorry, but your dad has made up his mind, so you'd better go upstairs and start packing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: I didn't think you wanted to see me.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? I didn't think you wanted to see me.",
        "Teri: That's not true.",
        "Janet: Do Mom and Pop know you're here?",
        "Teri: No, of course not. But maybe it's time you get back in touch with them, you know? They're not getting any younger.",
        "Janet: That's not my place. If they want to find me, they can.",
        "Teri: It's time to put that stuff in the past. I mean, they were hurt when you disappeared.",
        "Janet: \"Disappeared\"? \"Disappeared\"? Oh, that's an interesting way to put it.",
        "Teri: Look, I don't know how things went down between you guys, but it was 18 years ago!",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: We're starving.",
        "Janet: Uh, good. Dinner will be ready soon. How was your walk?",
        "Jack: Oh, it was great. Showed Sage a new foal. Why don't you go show it to Teri?",
        "Sage: Now.",
        "Jack: Sure. We got time, right?",
        "Janet: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Teri: I'd love to see it.",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Jack: Mm, mm, mm!",
        "Janet: Oh, Sweetheart, isn't it great? My sister's gonna live here. And now Liberty is finally gonna meet her aunt. She's gonna know that I have a sister.",
        "Jack: Honey, not so fast. I still haven't changed my mind.",
        "Janet: About what?",
        "Jack: About Teri watching my kids.",
        "Janet: Well, Honey, I know that you didn't want to hire a stranger, but this is my sister we're talking about.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but she's a stranger to me. And I got to tell you, she's a stranger to you, too.",
        "Janet: No, she's not!",
        "Jack: Honey, how old was she the last time you saw her?",
        "Janet: 5. Hey, that's not the point.",
        "Jack: Yes, it is. Darling, I'm sorry, but my mind's made up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: I need to talk to you. Saw you in the lobby with Meg. Guess you two are together?",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "Damian: We are. Why are you here?",
        "Lily: Holden and I are talking to Luke about who he should work for, and I think you should be there.",
        "Damian: I thought it was settled. He wants to work with me.",
        "Lily: Well, things have changed since he made that decision. My mother has taken over Worldwide for a while, and she could use Luke's help.",
        "Damian: They don't give up, do they?",
        "Lily: I think it would be a better place for him to work.",
        "Damian: Why? Because it's not with me?",
        "Lily: Because it's a different kind of company. It's closer to home. He could learn more about management.",
        "Damian: Why can't he learn about management with me?",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Lily: Come on. Worldwide is nowhere near as Byzantine as your family's business.",
        "Damian: By that you mean corrupt?",
        "Lily: No. Old-fashioned.",
        "Damian: Lily, please. This has nothing to do with management styles. This is about your husband wanting to keep my son away from me. And it sounds like you're on his side.",
        "Lily: I'm always on his side.",
        "Damian: I thought you were on Luciano's side.",
        "Lily: I am. And I don't think Grimaldi shipping is the place for him.",
        "Damian: Really? Because of management styles, or because of what you saw today in the lobby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad, I understand you wanting me to work at Worldwide. I do. And if I didn't already have a job, I would consider it. Seriously.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you haven't started working for Damian yet. He'll understand if you change your mind.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I haven't changed my mind.",
        "Holden: Why not? Working for Worldwide is a better fit. Damian -- he'll be fine with whatever you want to do.",
        "Luke: But he'll still be hurt.",
        "Holden: He wants what's best for you, and he's willing to let you make that choice.",
        "Luke: I know! So why aren't you?",
        "Holden: I just want you to have an option.",
        "Luke: Dad, can we please be serious here?",
        "Holden: Yes.",
        "Luke: You are just trying to keep me away from Damian.",
        "Holden: I want what's best for you. That's all. And working for Damian at that company isn't it.",
        "Luke: In your opinion.",
        "Holden: Your mother agrees, and she's more sympathetic to him than I am.",
        "Luke: Dad, that's not the point, either! You are trying to make me choose between you and him, which is exactly what you accused him of doing.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not. This isn't personal.",
        "Luke: I know it's not! Not for me. But it sure seems personal to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This has nothing to do with you and Meg. Holden and I think that Luke would be better off in a family business.",
        "Damian: Grimaldi shipping is a family business.",
        "Lily: Your family.",
        "Damian: And his.",
        "Lily: That's the problem.",
        "Damian: You agreed it should be Luciano's decision. He made it. So why are we still having this discussion?",
        "Lily: We wanted to make sure he's making the right decision.",
        "Damian: He thinks he did. So did I. You must understand what could happen if you try to force him to change his mind.",

        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Lily: Just because Holden and I agree --",

        "Craig: At least Janet will be doing the cooking and not your aunt.",
        "Parker: Craig, what's with you? Since when do you let my dad do whatever he wants? Since when do you let him push you around?",
        "Craig: I never said I thought what he was doing was okay. But he has legal rights where you're concerned, and I don't.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you're still my trustee, aren't you? Aren't you supposed to protect my best interests?",
        "Craig: That has to do with your trust fund. It has nothing to do with where you live.",
        "Parker: Okay. So when I was trying to marry Liberty and my parents were against it, you were behind me the whole way. And that had nothing to do with money.",
        "Craig: That's a good point. But frankly I don't know where I stand now that your aunt's back in the picture.",

        "Janet: Well, it's hard to tell sometimes.",
        "Jack: Honey, I'm not trying to tell your sister she can't stay here. I have no problem with your sister staying in Oakdale. It's just that I don't want her in that house with my kids. I don't want anyone in the house with my kids.",
        "Teri: Come on, Sage, Sweetie! The lasagna's probably ready, and you want to eat it when it's hot.",

        "Janet: Listen to me. When my parents found out I was pregnant, they put me on the first bus to my aunt's house. They didn't even let me wait and say good- bye to my sister when she got home from kindergarten. I never got to say anything to her. She had no idea what happened to me. She thought I just ran off and left her high and dry. And now I finally have a shot to make up for that, and my husband scares her away.

        "Teri: Rehab.",
        "Jack: Right. And I let their aunt stay with them 'cause I thought I could give them stability by keeping them in their own house. But Rosanna -- her heart's in the right place, but she's not used to having all these kids around. And when Sage took off, that's when I decided that I was gonna take them and -- and have them stay with me. My aunt, my cousins -- they're all at the farm. There will always be someone there to look out for them. That's why I don't need a babysitter.",

        "Jack: I don't need your help!",
        "Craig: Yes, you do. But I know it's your goal to get everyone who cares about you to hate you, but this is ridiculous. You don't want Teri to take care of your kids? Fine. Take your kids to the farm. But what's the harm in having Teri work at Metro until Carly gets back? She can spend time with Janet and still see Parker and Sage once in a while.",
        "Jack: I don't need your advice.",

        "Teri: You said that already.",
        "Jack: Right. I don't want to be the one to separate you and Janet. You two deserve a shot at getting to know each other again after all these years. And I definitely don't have a say as to who gets hired at Metro. But my children stay with me.",

        "Teri: Are you sure it's okay with the owner?",
        "Craig: Carly's always wanted to do more with the place. Rosanna has her power of attorney, so she's making all the hiring decisions right now.",

        "Luke: But it's not personal.",
        "Holden: In some ways, maybe it is, but it is definitely not about making me choose between two fathers.",
        "Luke: Dad, I already did that a long time ago.",
