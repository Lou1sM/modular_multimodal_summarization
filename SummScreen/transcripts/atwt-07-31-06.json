        "Katie finds out that Mike bid on a job to work with Simon. Simon and Mike agree to work together; Mike wants to keep Simon close to keep an eye on him and Simon wants to work with Mike to prove he is on the up and up. Carly and Katie have their doubts. Holden is able to take his son home from the hospital, and he is thrilled that Luke is coming home as well or so he thinks. Once home though, Luke is forced to tell him that Damian needs him more and he won't be able to stay now. Luke can't tell Holden why though because Damian asked him to not tell anyone. Damian tells Lucy he is headed home to Malta soon. He then claims to Luke that due to some test results coming in, he has to head back to Malta by weeks end. Luke agrees to go as soon as he does one last thing. Holden worries to Lucy that Damian is going to take Luke back to Malta. Nate is savagely stabbed to death and left right outside Crash as Lia's memorial service is taking place, where a horrified Gwen finds him. People start to look at Maddie again as a suspect since she was seen with Nate last and is now missing. Jade ad Will show back up after the fact, which doesn't go unnoticed by Dallas. Maddie shows up to the Lakeview with blood on her hands. She claims to have fallen. Margo questions her and she admits Nate put the moves on her and she became freaked out and ran home like a kid. Margo tells a horrified Maddie that Nate was killed a little while ago. Dallas tells Margo that the stab wounds, blade and knife were all similar to Lia's murder. They appear to have a serial murderer on their hands, as Margo watches a lost looking Maddie being ushered into the elevator by Henry and Eve."

        "Mike: So, do I have the job or not? I obviously put in the lowest bid, or else you wouldn't be here.",
        "Katie: Mike, no.",
        "Mike: Do you have a problem hiring me?",
        "Simon: Do you really want to work for me, Mike?",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, Mike. Simon, let's go. I mean, come on, this is just a silly game that you guys are playing.",
        "Mike: No, no, no. Nobody's playing here. Right, Simon? If you think this is a game, you're making a big mistake. The kind of mistake that could put you in a lot of danger, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: The pediatrician gave the all clear. Your son can go home today.",
        "Holden: You're sure about that?",
        "Lucy: Positive. The baby's ready. If you are.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, sure. I just wish that Lily --",
        "Lucy: If you need some help at home --",
        "Holden: No, no, no. It's okay. I hired a nurse to help us out. We'll be okay.",
        "Lucy: Well, I'll go push the paperwork along.",
        "Holden: Guess what, great news -- the baby gets to go home today. Now all we need is you, and we can be a whole family again. Because Luke is coming home. Thank God, because I've never needed him more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I can't leave you alone now. What kind of a person would I be if I left you by yourself while you're so sick?",
        "Damian: I know what kind of person you are, Luke. You're a wonderful person. And now that I have the privilege to see you as an adult, I've seen it with my own eyes. So as far as I'm concerned, I have everything I could ever ask for. I don't need anything more.",
        "Luke: Of course you do. Look, let me help my dad get set with the new baby. And I just want to check on my sisters. And then you and I can make plans.",
        "Damian: If that's what you want, I'll be grateful.",
        "Luke: You don't need to thank me. I'm doing the right thing. So I'll talk to my dad and then I'll call you.",
        "Damian: Certainly. And Luke, I hope we can keep this between us.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Damian: My illness. I don't want anybody's pity or interference.",
        "Luke: My dad would never pity you.",
        "Damian: Probably true. Nonetheless, I don't want him in my business. I just want my privacy.",
        "Luke: Okay, I won't say a word.",
        "Damian: Thank you.",
        "Luke: I'll call you later.",
        "Damian: It's me, with good news -- Luke is definitely coming to Malta.",

        "[Applause]",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Ann: That was beautiful. Just like Lia.",
        "Gwen: Oh, thanks. Thanks for helping me pick out a song that would've meant something to her. Take care. I need to get some air. You okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Will already left. I think I will, too. I mean, if you're all right.",
        "Casey: No, I'm fine.",
        "Gwen: Okay, if you need anything, just call us, okay?",
        "Casey: All right, thanks for singing.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, no problem. [Gwen see's Nate's body] [Gwen screaming] Help me!",
        "[Gwen screaming]",
        "Casey: Oh, God, not again. It's okay, it's okay.",
        "Ann: What is it?",
        "Zach: Stop!",
        "Casey: Zach, ease up. Here, Gwen, are you okay?",
        "Gwen: Is he dead?",
        "Casey: I don't know. We don't know. We don't know.",
        "Gwen: I was just walking and I wasn't looking where I was going, and I heard a sound and then I tripped. And it was him.",
        "Casey: Zach, call 911.",
        "Ann: Is it true? Is he dead?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Just -- okay, don't look at him. Just close your eyes and breathe.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm fine. I'm not going to start screaming again, don't worry.",
        "Casey: All right, maybe you should sit down.",
        "Gwen: I don't want to sit down. I want to do something. Isn't there something that we should be doing?",
        "Zach: An ambulance is on the way.",
        "Casey: What about the cops?",
        "Zach: I guess?",
        "Casey: All right, it doesn't matter. Just don't touch anything. Mom, it happened again. And Nate Bradley's dead. No, no, I checked the pulse, I couldn't get anything. I told everyone to just stay put. No, somebody else found him this time. Gwen. All right, just hurry, please.",
        "Jade: What's going -- oh, my God!",
        "Casey: Where were you?",
        "Jade: I was at the bus stop. And I heard a scream.",
        "Casey: Did you see anyone?",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Casey: You didn't see anyone? No one running?",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Gwen: Maddie.",
        "Casey: Oh, no.",
        "Jade: Maddie came with Nate.",

        "Gwen: Oh, God, no, come on, he didn't get her, too? Come on, no.",
        "Casey: Wait, where's Maddie?",
        "Ann: She should be in jail!",
        "Casey: You know what? You shut up! Anybody? Has anyone seen Maddie? Maddie! All right, you know, I've got to find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Lenny, I know the stake. I know you don't get to that table for less than ten grand. Hold on. I'm going to have to get back to you, Lenny. Hey, Maddie? Hey, what's the matter?",
        "Maddie: Nothing.",
        "Henry: Nothing? You look like you just ran a marathon, Sweetie.",
        "Maddie: No, I'm fine. I just need to sleep.",
        "Henry: You need to sleep? Okay, fine. You can do that. Just, why don't you come over here and tell me what's wrong?",
        "Maddie: Nothing! Why is that all anybody says to me anymore?",
        "Henry: Maybe because you look like you're upset all the time, that's why.",
        "Eve: Was the memorial awful? Oh, Honey, I wish you hadn't gone.",
        "Maddie: Me, too.",
        "Eve: Were the other kids mean, or -- Maddie?",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Henry: Oh, my God.",
        "Maddie: There's blood all over your hands!",

        "Damian: Grazie, Sweetheart.",
        "Lucy: Don't you look happy today.",
        "Damian: It's a good day.",
        "Lucy: It is.",
        "Damian: Oh?",
        "Lucy: Lily's baby is going home today.",
        "Damian: Really?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, the little one is healthy enough to go home, so he can leave the hospital.",
        "Damian: Without his mother?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Damian: How is Lily?",
        "Lucy: The same. Holden's being as brave as he can, but I could see it on his face today -- it's really taking a toll.",
        "Damian: Yeah, lucky for everyone, Holden is a strong man.",
        "Lucy: You almost make that sound like an insult.",
        "Damian: Do I? Nobody could be happier than I that Holden takes good care of his family.",
        "Lucy: Well, he's had a lot of help from you lately.",
        "Damian: Me?",
        "Lucy: Yes, you. Don't be modest. When you found out things were healing between Luke and Holden, you could've caused problems, but you didn't. I give you real credit for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, just in time.",
        "Luke: Yeah, there's something that I need to talk to you about, too.",
        "Holden: Well, let's do it in the car. We get to take your little brother home today.",
        "Luke: No kidding? Really?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. He's ready to go. I could use your help getting him home.",
        "Luke: Now?",
        "Holden: Yeah, the nurse is ready to bring him out. I just spoke to Mama. The girls are very excited to see him. And it's going to be crazy without your mom, so I need you to step up and help out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know.",
        "Holden: All right, great. So what did you want to say? What did you want to talk about?",
        "Luke: Oh -- nothing that can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Danger? Don't you think that's a little dramatic, Mike?",
        "Mike: Simon may have a money now, but he is the same con man he's always been. He'll use you.",
        "Simon: So that's why you want to work for me, is it, Mike? Oh, yeah -- oh, to protect Carly, that's it?",
        "Mike: Among other things.",
        "Simon: Do you want to settle this between us, Mike, or hide behind the ladies?",
        "Mike: Oh, by all means, let's go outside.",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Mike: It's just business.",
        "Carly: So what's going on here, Katie?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Honestly, Mike didn't say anything. It's got to be a bluff.",
        "Carly: A bluff, how?",
        "Katie: He's putting Simon on notice. There's no way he actually wants to work for him.",
        "Carly: So he wants to scare Simon away? Well, I happen to need this job. So why can't Mike just leave things alone?",
        "Simon: So, what, you feel the need to babysit me, Mike? Is that it?",
        "Mike: Somebody's got to do it.",
        "Simon: Are you that afraid of what your wife might do with me in town?",
        "Mike: No, I'm not afraid. But I think you are.",
        "Simon: Yeah? All right, tell me, of what?",
        "Mike: Of whatever scam I'll dig up when I'm working on your project. I mean, you obviously have an angle, or else you wouldn't be involved. The last thing you want is me to find out what it is, right?",
        "Simon: You see, I know you pride yourself on being some homegrown, red-blooded American hero, Mike, but what if you're the one with the ulterior motive here?",
        "Mike: Like what?",
        "Simon: Oh, here's an idea -- you come work on my building so you can sabotage it and then blame me.",
        "Mike: See, that's how you think.",
        "Simon: All right, then. Unless you can't bear the thought of being away from me, what's your deal?",
        "Mike: I submitted a bid. I'm a licensed contractor, I do good work.",
        "Simon: And that's it?",
        "Mike: You get a quality job, I get a paycheck.",
        "Simon: All right, and how can I trust you?",
        "Mike: My work speaks for itself. Ask around. And if you're legit, you've got nothing to be scared of.",
        "Simon: No worries there.",
        "Katie: This should've taken five seconds.",
        "Carly: Well, at least I don't hear any shouting.",
        "Katie: At least shouting would make sense.",
        "[Door opening]",
        "Mike: So just get me the specs next week and we'll start the initial demolition and framing process.",
        "Simon: All right, sounds great.",
        "Katie: Wait, what?",
        "Simon: What? Oh -- oh, Mike and I have a deal.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm starting on Simon's project next week.",
        "[Katie and Carly both] No way!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, how are my favorite girls?",
        "Faith: Fine. Where's the boy?",
        "Luke: Me? You mean me? Oh, I bet you mean this boy.",
        "Faith: Duh, yeah!",
        "Luke: You want to see him?",
        "Faith: He's so cute.",
        "Holden: He looks just like you did.",
        "Luke: Especially when he squinches up his eyes and yells.",
        "Faith: I don't!",
        "Luke: You do.",
        "Faith: Daddy, can I hold him?",
        "Holden: You bet you can. But we need to do it over here on the couch. And you need to put your hand underneath his head so you can support him. There we go.",
        "Luke: Ready? Okay, here we go. Say hello to baby brother.",
        "Faith: What's his name?",
        "Holden: We don't know. He didn't tell us yet.",
        "Luke: What do you think his name should be?",
        "Faith: Wiggles or Squinchy.",
        "Holden: Wiggles Squinchy Snyder. Do you like that? You do. Not bad, right? Can we keep him? Are you going to help out? Because there's going to be a lot of work to go around, okay? And it's a good thing we have your big brother to help us out.",
        "Luke: Well, today. Look, Dad, I'm -- I'm sorry, I can't stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Wow. Look at that. I must've cut myself when I fell.",
        "Henry: You fell?",
        "Maddie: On the way home.",
        "Henry: How did you fall in Nate's car?",
        "Maddie: I didn't.",
        "Eve: But Nate drove tonight.",
        "Maddie: I left earlier. The whole memorial was a nightmare. You were right, I shouldn't have gone.",
        "Henry: Did something happen there?",
        "Maddie: The whole thing was just wrong. Everything. Why won't this come off?",
        "Eve: Maybe Henry could go get us some water.",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure, sure.",
        "Eve: Maddie, we know. It's obvious something else happened tonight. Please tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Maddie's not in the ladies room.",
        "Casey: There's no sign of her around here in the parking lot. Did you see her?",
        "Jade: The last time I saw Maddie, she was leaving with Nate.",
        "Casey: Is that how you're going to say it to the cops? Just like that?",
        "Jade: How do you want me to sound?",
        "Casey: You know what? You don't know a damn --",
        "Margo: Casey, are you sure you're okay? You're okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",
        "[Police sirens]",
        "Margo: Rope it off.",
        "Dallas: Gone?",
        "Coroner: Barely an hour.",
        "Dallas: Anything else?",
        "Coroner: Yeah. But not until I get him on the slab and I can be sure.",
        "Dallas: Come on, look --",
        "Coroner: It looks familiar, okay?",
        "Dallas: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Did you touch anything?",
        "Casey: No, just his wrist --",
        "Margo: All right, all right, you did good.",
        "Dallas: Where did you walk?",
        "Casey: Huh?",
        "Dallas: Show me where you stepped.",
        "Casey: Right here. I mean, in there. I don't -- Gwen?",
        "Gwen: I tripped right by him. I didn't mean to. I didn't even see him. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: It's all right, it's all right. We just need to know where people walked so that we can get shoe prints so we can elimiNate people.",
        "Gwen: I didn't mean to mess it up.",
        "Margo: Its fine, you're fine. Did anyone else out there come out here?",
        "Casey: Pretty much everybody.",
        "Margo: All right, Dallas?",
        "Dallas: Let's get shoe prints of everyone, all right? Can you wait inside, please? This doesn't look like a struggle.",
        "Margo: I know. It must have been someone so big that he didn't have time to struggle.",
        "Dallas: Or someone so little, he wasn't even afraid.",
        "Margo: Oh, Man.",
        "Dallas: Look, we don't have to jump. Okay, let's just take it slow.",
        "Margo: I'll take statements. You finish up out here. And then we've got to notify next of kin.",
        "Dallas: You want me to take care of that?",
        "Margo: No, I'll do it. I knew Nate and his family. It's okay. [Dallas sighs] All right, kids. All right, great. Thank you for staying together. Listen, I want to know if anybody saw anything out of the ordinary tonight. If you saw any strangers around. Anything whatsoever.",
        "Ann: What are you talking about? It's obvious it was Maddie Coleman.",
        "Margo: What? What? Hold on, hold on.",
        "Ann: Hello, she came here with Nate, and now no one can find her. They already looked. She killed Nate just like she killed Lia.",

        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Mike: To a successful venture.",
        "Simon: In every way.",
        "Dallas: Where were you?",
        "Will: What?",
        "Dallas: I saw you run in here after the murder.",
        "Margo: Where were you before that? You had better have a very good alibi for the time of the murder.",
        "Maddie: I'm just gonna come out with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Where is Maddie?",
        "Ann: Hiding her knife for next time.",
        "Margo: Did you actually see something?",
        "Ann: She came here with Nate. He's dead and she's gone!",
        "Margo: I'll take that as a no.",
        "Ann: Whatever.",
        "Margo: Don't throw accusations.",
        "Casey: You hear that? Don't throw accusations around.",
        "Will: What's going on?",
        "Cop 2: Step back, it's a crime scene.",
        "Will: My wife's in there. Gwen!",
        "Gwen: Will? Will --",
        "Will: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, but I found him.",
        "Will: Who?",
        "Gwen: Nate. He's dead.",
        "Margo: In the lobby? You sure? No, no, no. Stay outside, don't approach. But don't let them leave either. Yeah.",
        "Margo: All right, everybody listen up. Forensics has arrived. We need shoe prints from everybody. Make sure that the officers have your name, your home address and your home number. If you saw anything tonight that you think that we need to know now, tell us now. If not, we'll contact you in the morning and we'll get full statements, okay?",
        "Casey: Don't say anything.",
        "Margo: About what?",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Jade: About what I saw.",
        "Casey: Which is nothing!",
        "Margo: Casey?",
        "Casey: Whatever, it's bogus.",
        "Margo: Well, what is it?",
        "Jade: Never mind.",
        "Margo: No, tell me.",
        "Jade: Okay. It's not like I'm trying to be a rat or anything. It's not like I'm happy about this.",
        "Margo: It's all right, just tell me.",
        "Jade: Okay. The night that Lia was killed, I saw Maddie on the old footbridge near Pine Brook Road, and she looked really, really out of it. And I saw her throwing something away.",
        "Casey: You didn't see that!",
        "Jade: I didn't see what it was! But, anyway, when I said something about it, she acted really nasty with me. She told me to forget that I saw her there.",
        "Casey: And that makes her guilty of what? Hating you, maybe?",
        "Margo: Casey, please.",
        "Jade: You know what, it didn't sound innocent. And the way that she looked at me, it wasn't just not liking me. There's really something going on with that girl.",
        "Margo: All right, great. Thank you so much for your statement. Make sure that the officers have your home number and address.",
        "Jade: Oh -- okay.",
        "Margo: So Maddie was with Nate here tonight?",
        "Casey: Yeah. They left kind of together. That's why I thought maybe something happened to her. But before you guys got here, we checked everything. We didn't find anything, so \u0096",
        "Margo: I know where Maddie is.",
        "Casey: Oh, you do? Like, you checked her out?",
        "Margo: Honey, I had to. Like you said, she could've been hurt.",
        "Casey: What are you thinking right now?",
        "Margo: You know what I'm thinking right now? I think I want you to go home. I want you to go to bed. Your dad's waiting for you there, okay?",
        "Casey: Where are you going?",
        "Margo: I'm working. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: You can tell me what happened.",
        "Maddie: I don't know. Like I said, I must've cut myself when I fell.",
        "Henry: Where did you fall, Maddie?",
        "Maddie: On the way home.",
        "Henry: Drink that, okay? Catch your breath. Did you find out what happened?",
        "Eve: No, but something's definitely wrong.",
