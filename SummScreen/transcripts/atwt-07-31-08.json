        "Holden tells Emma that he and Lily are farther apart then ever; Emma suggests doing everything he can in order to save his marriage, so she suggests they start by inviting Lily and the girls over for a barbeque. Luke tries to divert Faith and Natalie from asking questions as to why Holden isn't staying at home. Liberty is less then thrilled to see Ugo still employed as her bodyguard by Brad. Carly calls Jack to help with Parker and learns she is the least of his problems when Jack tells her that Parker and Liberty slept together. Janet meets Ugo and is furious. Janet thinks she should take Liberty away from Oakdale. Lily begrudgingly accepts Emma's invite. Carly tries to talk with Parker, but she is met with snide comments. Jack jumps to Carly's defense when Parker blames her for being a bad role model. Brad and Janet fight over how he is handling Liberty, as Liberty slips out unnoticed. Sage wants to go to the barbeque at the Farm and Carly is forced to take her. Faith can see how her parents are acting and calls them on it; Lily admits to her that they are having problems again, as Faith runs off. Brad fires Ugo when Liberty is able to sneak away. Liberty is able to call Parker and tell him to meet her at Java. When Carly drops Sage off, Lily sees her trying to leave and unleashes on her about sleeping with Holden, as Faith and Luke overhear. Lily and Holden are crushed when Faith tells them that she hates them both. They later talk about how they are hurting one another and the children with Carly and with Dusty while Luke tries to comfort Faith. Carly tells Jack what happened at the farm and surprisingly he is supportive. Brad finds Liberty at Java and throws her over his shoulder to take her home. Noah and Luke talk about moving in together, but Luke explains he needs to support his mom and sister right now. Lily tells Holden they need to end it to put everyone out of their misery because for the foreseeable future she can't get over what he did with Carly. Emma wants Holden to go after Lily, but he can't. Jack suggests Carly take Sage to Montana for a break while he hold down the fort there, as Carly is thankful for his understanding and support. Parker shows up to see Liberty, but she is already gone. Brad and Liberty have another disagreement over how he is treating her. When Liberty tells him that she will see Parker, he throws her cell phone out the car window."

        "Emma: Ah, Holden. You're up early.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I had to check on new foal.",
        "Emma: Here you go.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Emma: So, how'd it go yesterday when you were picking up the girls from camp?",
        "Holden: They're home. They're fine.",
        "Emma: No, I'm talking about Lily. Did you two talk on the way up?",
        "Holden: No, not really. We barely said two words to each other on the way up to camp, and then I didn't come back with her.",
        "Emma: Why not?",
        "Holden: Well, we ran into Carly. She was there picking up Sage.",
        "Emma: Ah. And what happened?",
        "Holden: Lily got all bent out of shape. She thought we planned it that way. She threw Faith and Nat in the car and drove home without me.",
        "Emma: She just left you stranded there? How'd you get home?",
        "Holden: Carly gave me a ride. Mama, nothing happened, okay? Sage was in the car, for God's sake. It's over, all right? Carly and I, we're doing everything we can to avoid each other.",
        "Emma: Well, if that's true, then you're gonna have to find a way to get through to Lily and make her believe that.",
        "Holden: Any ideas on how to do that? Because I really don't have a clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey!",
        "Natalie: Luke, we missed you!",
        "Luke: Aw. Well, I missed you guys, too, so much! So, how was summer camp? Was it totally tubular?",
        "Faith: We made you and Noah matching lanyard key rings.",
        "Luke: Way cool. Thanks.",
        "Faith: I heard gay marriage is legal in California. You're not moving, are you?",
        "Luke: No, sorry. You're stuck with me for a while.",
        "Faith: I wish you could get married here.",
        "Luke: Yeah. That'd be nice, but, you know, marriage is a great thing, but it can also be very complicated.",
        "Lily: Luke is in time to have breakfast with us. Ethan was so excited to see the girls last night, I could barely get him to sleep, so he's sleeping in. Things should be relatively peaceful around here.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, I'm taking orders. Who wants pancakes?",
        "Natalie: Well, Dad usually makes pancakes. Can we call him?",
        "Lily: Dad is at the farm, Sweetie.",
        "Faith: Dad didn't sleep here last night, did he?",
        "Lily: Well, no.",
        "Faith: Why not?",
        "Luke: Um, Faith. You know how it is when you're doing chores on the farm in the morning. You know, sometimes you have to wake up really, really early, so Dad just probably didn't want to disturb you this morning, you know? So, who wants to make pancakes?",
        "Natalie: I will.",
        "Luke: Okay, let's go.",
        "Faith: Mom, you and Dad are breaking up again, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You're just giving up on your marriage, huh? Just like that.",
        "Holden: Mama, I have apologized to Lily every way I know how. I even asked her for a cooling-down period before she does anything legal. I keep hitting a brick wall with her, though.",
        "Emma: Well, you have to go around the wall. You have to knock it down.",
        "Holden: It takes two people to rebuild a marriage.",
        "Emma: Holden, how badly do you want Lily back?",
        "Holden: Honestly, right now I don't know what I want.",
        "Emma: Well, you know you love your family, and your children need you and Lily to be together. You've got to do everything you can to get this marriage back again.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I can't do it by myself. She won't listen to me.",
        "Emma: Then, I'll talk to her. Here I want to have all of them out to lunch today. I'm gonna have a big barbecue to welcome the kids home from camp.",
        "Holden: Forget about it. She won't do it, especially if she knows that I'm here.",
        "Emma: No, no, no, no. She'll do it. She can't say no to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Good morning, Sleepyhead.",
        "Liberty: What's good about it? Where's Katie?",
        "Brad: She's at the studio, which is where I'm headed. We're doing a segment on parakeets!",
        "Liberty: Great. Something else you can keep in cages besides me.",
        "Brad: You need a serious attitude adjustment.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, maybe shock treatments or padded walls for my room.",
        "Brad: Just try to stay out of trouble today, all right?",
        "Liberty: Do I have a choice?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "[Liberty scoffs]",
        "Liberty: Do I really have to hang out with this thing again?",
        "Brad: No, he's not here to hang out. He's here to keep you in line.",
        "Liberty: How long are we gonna play this little game?",
        "Brad: As long as I say. Watch out for my little girl.",
        "Ugo: You got it, Boss. Is there anything I can get you?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, a passport and a one-way ticket to Cancun.",
        "Ugo: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Liberty: That's what I figured. So, in that case, you can leave me alone, don't talk to me, and just stay out of my sight.",
        "Ugo: Brat.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Janet: Who the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi. That was fast.",
        "Jack: You made it sound like a five-alarm fire.",
        "Carly: Well, uh, something is going on with Parker, and I need your help.",
        "Jack: What's he done now?",
        "Carly: It's what he won't do. He won't come out of his room. He won't speak to me.",
        "Jack: So, what else is new?",
        "Carly: Yeah, but this is getting out of hand. I know he's upset with me for what happened with Holden, but he can't just pretend I don't exist.",
        "Jack: Well, I tried talking to him about that, Carly, but I don't know what else I can do.",
        "Carly: Well, whatever you do, do it for Sage, too, because he has barely said two words to her since she got home. And he's been angry with me before, but he has never taken it out on his sister, which makes me think that maybe it isn't just me. Maybe there's something else going on here.",
        "Jack: Maybe.",
        "Carly: Jack. Well, if you have any idea about what that might be, I need you to tell me. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hello? Do you speak English? I said, \"Who the hell are you?\"",
        "Ugo: I heard you the first time. Who the hell are you?",
        "Janet: I am Liberty's mother. Where is she? And where are Brad and Katie?",
        "Ugo: Mr. and Mrs. Snyder are at work.",
        "Janet: Where's my kid?",
        "Ugo: Liberty's safe.",
        "Janet: What the -- what do you mean she's safe?",
        "Ugo: It means I have my eye on her.",
        "Janet: You do -- get -- get out of my --",
        "Ugo: I have orders -- nobody goes in and nobody goes out.",
        "Janet: You know what you can do with your orders?",
        "Janet: Liberty? Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Oh, Mom. Have you met Lurch? Oh, I mean Ugo. Isn't he great?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're right, Carly. You're probably not the only issue for Parker right now.",
        "Carly: So, what are these other issues, Jack? Has he said anything to you?",
        "Jack: You know Parker. He doesn't say much.",
        "Carly: I also know you, and it is painfully obvious if there is something you're not telling me. Did he ask you not to?",
        "Jack: That's not it.",
        "Carly: Oh, Boy. Why do I get the feeling this is not good news?",
        "Jack: Because it isn't.",
        "Carly: Tell me.",
        "Jack: Parker did something inappropriate.",
        "Carly: Don't you think I have a right to know what this something inappropriate is? What did he do?",
        "Jack: He had sex with Liberty.",
        "Carly: That's not even funny, Jack. Tell me what really happened, would you? Se -- seriously? Parker and Lib -- oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God, Jack! What are we gonna do? Oh, no, no, no, no. No. Thi -- this is not true.",
        "Jack: Yes, it is. Parker had sex with Liberty.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, I thought that you had a talk with him about the fact that he is too young to become involved in this way. You said that he understood.",
        "Jack: Did I say that?",
        "Carly: He's 15! How old is this Liberty girl?",
        "Jack: A year older. Maybe a little more.",
        "Carly: Oh, this is wrong. It's so wrong. How did it happen?",
        "Jack: How do you think it happened, Carly? I told you that Liberty and Parker had been hanging out.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you mentioned it in passing. I had no idea it was already out of control!",
        "Jack: Well, I didn't know anything was happening until it was too late.",
        "Carly: Why did I think that you talking to him would be enough? Why did -- you know, we should have seen this coming.",
        "Jack: Well, I think the grown-ups were a little preoccupied.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Are you somehow -- are you somehow telling me that this is my fault?",
        "Jack: No, no. I'm saying that there's plenty of blame to go around.",
        "Carly: When were you planning on telling me about it?",
        "Jack: I just did.",
        "Carly: I had to pry it out of you!",
        "Jack: Well, I knew you'd react like this.",
        "Carly: I had a right to know!",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Carly! Please, let's not fight about who knew what when.",
        "Carly: You're right. I really don't have time to fight with you right now. I have to fight with him!",
        "Jack: Stop! Hey! Calm down, first. I already read Parker the riot act.",
        "Carly: Obviously, it didn't do any good, did it?",
        "Jack: No, it didn't. But now that I've had a chance to think about it, the advice that Janet gave me, it's kind of good, right?",
        "Carly: Janet? Who the hell is she to tell us what to do?",
        "Jack: She's Liberty's mother.",
        "Carly: So Janet has known about this.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: You've discussed this with Janet!",
        "Jack: Yes, Carly. I have. And she was pretty levelheaded about the whole thing. Janet did everything she could to keep Liberty from being sexually active, and she made sure that Liberty had protection.",
        "Carly: What? Oh, God! She gave her daughter birth control, Jack! Talk about mixed signals!",
        "Jack: Would you calm down, please?",
        "Carly: You want me to calm down? You confided in Janet about our son and kept me in the dark! You want me to be calm?",
        "Jack: Oh, give me a break.",
        "Carly: You had no right to keep this from me!",
        "Jack: You're gonna make this worse, you know that?",
        "Carly: You have already made it worse, Jack! Hey, Parker? Get down here now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ugo: Ow, that hurts!",
        "Janet: Who is this goon?",
        "Liberty: Just my bodyguard.",
        "Janet: Your what?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, he's more like a prison guard, actually.",
        "Janet: That's ridiculous. Who's idea was --",
        "Liberty: Just my so-called dad.",
        "Janet: What the hell is he trying to protect you from?",
        "Ugo: From herself.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's stupid. My daughter is no danger to herself or anyone else. Now you can go. Go now.",
        "Liberty: Good luck with that one, Mom.",
        "Ugo: I'm not going anywhere. I take my orders from Mr. Brad.",
        "Janet: Fine. Fine. You stay. We'll go. Go get your stuff.",
        "Liberty: Oh, Mom. Mom, does this mean I get to go live at the farm with you and Uncle Jack? Please.",
        "Janet: No. I don't think that Auntie Em would really go for that. No. I'm really beginning to think that this whole move to Oakdale was a bad idea. I think it's time for us to go home.",
        "Liberty: No. I am not leaving this town, Mom.",
        "Janet: Liberty Lou, you go in there and get your stuff right now!",
        "Ugo: I'm calling Mr. Brad.",
        "Janet: Fine. See how far that gets you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mmm. You know what? If I do say so myself, these pancakes were awesome.",
        "Faith: Why couldn't we invite Dad?",
        "Lily: Dad had a lot to do at the farm.",
        "Faith: Mom, why won't you tell us what's going on? Is Dad mad at you again?",
        "Luke: Look, Faith, is this what you did at camp? Just spent all your time creating all these scenarios that may or may not be happening?",
        "Faith: Well, we told a lot of ghost stories.",
        "Luke: Well, there you go. That's why you have such an overactive imagination. So it's time to turn that off and just chillax, okay?",
        "Faith: Fine.",
        "Luke: Fine. All right, good. Well, since I was the chef this morning, that means you guys have to do the dishes.",
        "Faith: Come on, Nat. Let's just get it over with.",
        "Lily: Thank you. You are a life saver.",
        "Luke: Thanks. But sooner or later, you're gonna have to tell the girls that you and Dad are separated.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. I just -- I wanted them to have one more carefree summer day before we broke their hearts.",
        "Luke: I get that.",
        "Lily: So great to hear them laughing. I mean, I wish it could always be like that.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe it can be. I mean, if you and Dad try to work things out, may-- okay, maybe not.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Emma: Hi. Hi, Sweetheart. It's me. It's Emma. How you doing?",
        "Lily: Hi, Emma. Fine. What's going on?",
        "Emma: Listen, I had a wonderful idea. How about coming out to the farm today? You know, I can have a big barbecue to welcome the girls home from camp.",
        "Lily: Ooh, a big family barbecue at the farm. I was just about to make tuna sandwiches with the kids.",
        "Luke: No, no. You should do it. It would be good for the girls.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry. I'm not gonna take \"No\" for an answer. Come on, now. Get here as soon as you can.",
        "Lily: All right, thanks. Can we bring anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: No. Just yourselves and a very healthy appetite. Okay? See you soon. There you go. Easy as that.",
        "Holden: The hard part is when she gets here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I wonder if that was a mistake.",
        "Luke: Why would it be?",
        "Lily: Your father's gonna be there.",
        "Luke: Come on, Mom. You can handle it.",
        "Lily: I can if you'll be there with me.",
        "Luke: Of course I will. But one condition -- I want to bring a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hi, Noah. Do you have a minute?",
        "Noah: Sure. Jeff, you mind covering for me?",
        "Jeff: Yeah, Man.",
        "Noah: So, what's up? I thought you were gonna be hanging out with your little sisters and your brother.",
        "Luke: Well, that was the plan, but then my Grandma Emma decided she wants to get the whole family together, and you're invited. So, she's gonna have a barbecue.",
        "Noah: Well, I love Emma's cooking, but will your parents be there?",
        "Luke: Uh, yeah. And that's the downside.",
        "Noah: And will they be speaking, or will they be throwing things at each other?",
        "Luke: Probably throwing things. I don't know. The tensions gonna be so thick, you can cut it with a steak knife.",
        "Noah: How are the girls doing? Do they know about the split?",
        "Luke: No. But Faith is suspicious. So that's why I want you to come with me. We'll go to the farm. We'll put on these big, fake smiles, and we'll pretend that we're just happy family.",
        "Noah: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",
        "Luke: Are you kidding me?",
        "Noah: I don't have to fake being happy when I'm with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This is ridiculous. Parker, if you don't come down here right now, I'm coming up.",
        "Jack: That's a great way to start off, Carly. That'll make him really receptive.",
        "Parker: What do you want?",
        "Carly: Your dad has told me what you've been up to with Liberty.",
        "Parker: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Carly: No, no. Don't blame him. I would have found out sooner or later, Honey.",
        "Parker: Great. So, can we get this lecture over with?",
        "Carly: No. I'm not gonna lecture you. I'm certain that your father has told you everything you need to hear. I would just ask that you take what he said to heart. Jack is a very good role model when it comes to these things.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Better than you.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: I've made mistakes. Bad mistakes. But that does not mean that I have forfeited the right to be your mother or to have an opinion, Parker, and it is my opinion that you are too young to be sexually active.",
        "Parker: Are you kidding me? Who are you to tell me anything?",
        "Jack: That is enough.",
        "Sage: Mom, Dad. Natalie called. She and Faith are going to the farm for a cookout, and I'm invited. Please, please, please, please, please, can I go?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Sweetheart. Just need to finish this conversation I'm having with Parker, okay?",
        "Parker: We're finished.",
        "Carly: We're not. Just five minutes, okay?",
        "Sage: I'll bring my bathing suit in case we go swimming.",
        "Carly: Parker, listen to me.",
        "Parker: I'm listening.",
        "Carly: What happened, it shouldn't have happened, and it can't happen again.",
        "Parker: Are you talking to me, or are you talking to yourself?",
        "Jack: Cut it out. Your mother is very worried about you.",
        "Parker: Okay, but there's nothing to worry about. We used protection, okay? So can I go now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I didn't pack everything, okay, Mom? Just the stuff I need for tonight.",
        "Janet: That's fine. Brad and Katie can send the rest.",
        "Ugo: I can't let the girl go.",
        "Janet: That girl is my daughter. Now, I'm not gonna tell you again.",
        "Ugo: I have my orders.",
        "Janet: Fine. Then you'll have to shoot me if you're not gonna let me walk out that door. You're not packing heat, are you?",
        "Ugo: I'll do whatever it takes to keep Ms. Liberty safe.",
        "Janet: Ms. Liberty is my daughter, and I will not have you treat her like a convicted felon! Ow! That's assault. My boyfriend's a cop.",
        "Ugo: I don't care.",
        "Janet: Get off me! Come on! Let's go!",
        "Brad: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Janet: Bradley Snyder, what kind of a pathetic excuse for a father are you?",
        "Brad: The kind that cares enough to give his kid all the tough love she needs.",
        "Brad: Good job, Ugo.",
        "Janet: What kind of a father are you, pawning some goon off on our daughter?",
        "Brad: Look, I can't be with her 24/7. I'm just making sure that she stays out of trouble.",
        "Liberty: But I don't need a babysitter.",
        "Janet: That's right. She needs a father, not a warden.",
        "Brad: I'm just giving her discipline 16 years too late.",
        "Janet: Are you saying that I never gave her any discipline?",
        "Brad: You let her get away with murder.",
        "Janet: She knows where I stand.",
        "Brad: She knows she can get anything past you.",
        "Janet: No, she can't!",
        "Brad: Yes, she can.",
        "Janet: Like what?",
        "Brad: Like sex.",
        "Janet: I never told her that was okay.",
        "Brad: You never said \"Never.\" I had to lay down the law.",
        "Janet: Oh, right. Well, why don't you try being a father to her instead of foisting her off on Hulk Hogan over there.",
        "Brad: Would you give us a second?",
        "Ugo: Where do you want me to go, Boss?",
        "Brad: I don't know. Just hang out in your car.",
