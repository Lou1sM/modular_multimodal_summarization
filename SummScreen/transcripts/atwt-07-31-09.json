        "Rosanna: Teri, what are you doing?",
        "Teri: I always clean my cooking instruments myself.",
        "Rosanna: You're allowed to take a break when the kids aren't here.",
        "Teri: I figured if I did it now, it would save time when everyone's hungry.",
        "Rosanna: Don't you want to see your sister? Uh, she works, uh, in Old Town at the Al's diner, I think.",
        "Teri: I don't want to bother her.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. I'm sure she'd love to see you more.",
        "Teri: When I'm finished cleaning, what I really need is a supermarket.",
        "Rosanna: Teri, come on.",
        "Teri: I don't mind being busy. I've been kind of sitting around, doing nothing ever since I got fired.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Well, you just take a break whenever you need to, okay? You deserve it. You've been great.",
        "Teri: I want to make something special for dinner.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Craig: Sounds great. Count me in.",
        "Rosanna: Do you have a key or something?",
        "Craig: The one Carly gave me.",
        "[Rosanna groans]",
        "Rosanna: Was she conscious at the time?",
        "Craig: Very funny. We are engaged, you know? Don't let her turn you against me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't worry. I'm sure you'll do that all by yourself.",
        "Teri: I think I'll go shopping.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Hmm. Bye.",
        "Craig: How is she working out so far?",
        "Rosanna: Well, she's great. She's actually given me some room to breathe. Thank you very much.",
        "Craig: Terrific. You're gonna need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Janet inhales]",
        "Janet: Did I ever tell you about the time Teresa made these amazing cookies when she was about 4? I mean, they were beautiful, until you ate them.",
        "Jack: Because she made them out of talcum powder.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Janet: I did tell you.",
        "Jack: Oh, maybe once or twice.",

        "Janet: Uh, I don't know. At work or something?",
        "Jack: You haven't spoken to her?",
        "Janet: Well, no. I -- I don't want to bother her, you know? Uh, it would seem like I was interrupting. I'm surprised she even remembers me.",
        "[Jack stammers]",
        "Jack: She's your sister. Honey, you remembered her.",
        "Janet: I know, but I was a teenager. I felt like she was just as much my baby as she was my mom's. I missed her the most.",
        "Jack: Well, you don't have to miss her anymore.",
        "Janet: I know. I'm so excited for Liberty to come back from her internship. She gets to meet Teresa and have a family of her own.",
        "Jack: And Teri will love her.",
        "Janet: I hope so. Oh -- I cannot thank you enough for letting her stay with us.",
        "Jack: Mm. Well, I got to tell you, that stuff you tried last night -- that works.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Do you remember when your mother and I thought you should be the face of our new vitamin water?",
        "Parker: Yeah. She made me pose for those drawings.",
        "Craig: Exactly.",
        "Parker: It was lame.",
        "Craig: No, it wasn't. You looked terrific. You were exactly the kind of image that we wanted -- young, athletic, energetic.",
        "Parker: Lame, dorky, pathetic.",
        "Craig: Decide for yourself.",
        "Rosanna: These are good.",
        "Parker: Oh, please.",
        "Rosanna: No, I mean it. You look great.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you're my aunt. You're biased.",
        "Craig: Well, Ed Lazarus is not your aunt, and he thinks so, too.",
        "Parker: Who's Ed Lazarus?",
        "Craig: Our new partner. And he thinks we should base our entire marketing campaign around you.",
        "Parker: You mean the drawings.",
        "Craig: And more. Photos, viral campaign on the web, maybe even TV spots.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me a minute. Uh, uh, when did this happen?",
        "Craig: I sent him the sketches just this morning.",
        "Rosanna: Without telling me?",
        "Craig: Well, I didn't know he would get so excited about it.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, how many times do I have to tell you, you do not get to make any decisions regarding the kids or the vitamin water business without talking to me?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Look at this stroller. It has four-wheel independent suspension, reinforced snow tires, and a heated rain cover.",
        "Brad: Sounds nicer than my car. More expensive, too.",
        "Katie: We have to be safe for the baby.",
        "Brad: We don't need the stroller equivalent of a stretched limo.",
        "Katie: I know you're worried about money, but --",
        "Brad: Neither one of us are working right now.",
        "Katie: We will soon.",
        "Brad: You will.",
        "Katie: Just because Kim doesn't want you to do the show solo doesn't mean you're not gonna get something else. Something's gonna come up soon.",
        "[Brad sighs]",
        "Brad: When? I have been looking for weeks. And meanwhile, our bank account is just -- it's taking a nosedive.",
        "Katie: We'll be fine.",
        "Brad: I should have agreed to partner with Henry.",
        "Katie: No, you couldn't. If he took Vienna's job, she would never come home.",
        "Brad: She's not coming home anyway.",
        "Katie: She will. But in the meantime, Henry has his mother to deal with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Audrey groans]",
        "[Audrey laughs]",
        "Audrey: Ooh la la, my son. I -- I always knew you had a very active imagination.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Henry: What are you doing?!",
        "Audrey: Th -- this is -- it's a mess.",
        "Henry: It's my mess!",
        "Audrey: Well, you know what? I raised you to be very neat.",
        "Henry: It's none of your business.",
        "[Audrey sighs]",
        "Audrey: I am just trying to help out.",
        "Henry: No, you are not.",
        "Audrey: Well, what else -- what in the world would I be doing in your drawers?",
        "Henry: You were looking for something to steal.",
        "Audrey: That is a horrible thing to say.",
        "Henry: Don't you deny it, Mother. It won't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, Teresa!",
        "Teri: Rosanna told me you worked here. I hope its okay.",
        "Janet: Of course it is! I was just about to take my break.",
        "Teri: I can't believe you're a waitress. It must be in the jeans.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, you know -- do you want something? Do you want some coffee or some pie?",
        "Teri: No. No, thanks. Thanks.",
        "Janet: Okay, well, let me just put this order in, and we can talk.",
        "Teri: Oh, I don't want to bother you.",
        "Janet: What?! What bother? It's been 18 years. We've got a lot to catch up on.",
        "Teri: Stop, Jan. You don't have to lie to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I had no idea Ed would react this way, but he did. It's a great opportunity for us, and for Parker.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Jack's not gonna go for it.",
        "Parker: Go for what?",
        "Rosanna: Your face on every bottle of water we sell.",
        "Parker: That sounds like a lot of work.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, if you'd rather keep lugging dirty dishes around Al's and making a tenth of the amount of money you could doing this, go right ahead.",
        "Parker: 10 times more? Really?",
        "Rosanna: We still have to get your dad's okay.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, then you can forget it, 'cause he's never gonna say yes.",
        "Craig: Why would Jack object to you getting a better job than the one you have now?",
        "Parker: Because he's Jack. Saying no is what he does.",
        "Rosanna: He's your dad, and we have to get his approval before we do this.",
        "Parker: Right, so it's not gonna happen.",
        "Craig: Want to bet? Half time!",
        "Rosanna: Craig, do you think you can put Parker's face on thousands of bottles of water and not have Jack find out about it?",
        "Craig: Of course not. I'm going to get him to agree, same way I got him to let Teri stay in town.",
        "Parker: Total once-in-a-lifetime fluke.",
        "Craig: You'll see.",
        "Rosanna: You know Jack wants Parker to go back to school.",
        "Craig: We all do.",
        "Rosanna: Well, modeling takes up a lot of time.",
        "Craig: And it makes a lot of money.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, I'm -- I'm trying to tell you that there's no way you can sell Jack on the fact that you think you know what's better for Parker than he does.",
        "Craig: Don't you get tired of watching me do all the things you say I can't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Jack: What do you want?",
        "Craig: To cement our new friendship, Jack. How would you and Janet like to come for dinner?",
        "Jack: Yeah, we can't make it. And we're not friends.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, Jack. It's a good, old-fashioned family dinner to welcome Teri into the fold. Don't you think Janet should be there?",
        "Jack: What is this really about, Craig?",
        "Craig: It's really about letting Janet and Teri spend time together. We'll see you at 6:00. He'll be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Why would I lie to you?",
        "Teri: It's -- it's really okay. I know seeing me isn't easy for you.",
        "Janet: Why not?",
        "Teri: Why would you want to see some baby sister you never cared about?",
        "Janet: Of course I care.",
        "Teri: The way you left without saying goodbye -- I mean, I understand why you wouldn't want anything to do with our family.",
        "Janet: That's not how I felt at all.",
        "Teri: You were on an adventure, and you wanted to cut all ties. Last thing you wanted to feel guilty about was leaving behind some bratty little kid.",
        "Janet: Whoa! Teresa, stop it! What the hell are you talking about?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You were trying to steal something from me.",
        "Audrey: How can you really say that to me?",
        "Henry: How can I -- you've been stealing from me since I was 7 years old. You remember when you -- you broke my piggy bank so you could go to Cahokia Downs?",
        "Audrey: Well, yeah, yeah! But I -- I swore to you, I promised I would -- I would pay you back!",
        "Henry: Because you got caught!",
        "[Audrey sighs]",
        "Henry: What are you looking for now? My -- my bank account passwords, my safe deposit key, what?",
        "Audrey: What happened to you, my cute, little, fluffy, adorable son? Do you know how much it hurts me to see how embittered and distrustful my favorite son has become?",
        "Henry: I'm your only son! And I'm not your personal ATM machine. You know what? Gonna put a stop to this right now.",
        "Audrey: What -- what are you doing? Who are you calling?",
        "Henry: I'm calling the front desk. I'm gonna get you your own room so you can make arrangements to leave. Actually, you know what? We'll stop by the front desk on the way out.",
        "Audrey: Where are we going?",
        "Henry: Someplace where you can't do any more damage. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You have nothing to worry about. You'll be fine.",
        "[Brad sighs]",
        "Brad: I'd better be. Otherwise, we're gonna be raising our kid in a car.",
        "Katie: Do I look worried?",
        "Brad: You should be, you know? I mean, I'm not the -- I'm not the most responsible guy in the world, Katie.",
        "Katie: Don't say that.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, look -- I mean, seriously, look at my track record. I mean, I had nothing to do with my daughter until she was 16 years old.",
        "Katie: That wasn't your fault! You didn't even know Janet was pregnant!",
        "Brad: I could have found out why she disappeared, but I didn't. I didn't do that. If I had -- I don't know that I would have done anything different.",
        "Katie: Of course you would.",
        "Brad: You didn't know me then.",
        "Katie: But I know you now, and if I had any doubt whatsoever, I would not be having a baby with you. Mm.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Brad: Who is this?",
        "Katie: Go find out.",
        "[Brad growls]",
        "Henry: I need a favor.",
        "Brad: We are in the middle of something.",
        "Henry: Can it wait? I need you to keep an eye on this one.",
        "Audrey: Do -- do you see this? Do you see how he treats his poor, old mother?",
        "Henry: You are not old, Mother, and you've got to be far from poor, considering how much money you've stolen over the years.",
        "Audrey: I have never taken a dime that did not belong to me.",
        "Henry: A dime, no, but thousands of dollars, maybe. Keep your hands on your wallets!",
        "Brad: W -- where are you going?",
        "Henry: I'm gonna go shore up my financial firewall before my mother's next attack.",
        "Audrey: Oh! You -- you -- drama queen!",
        "[Audrey sighs]",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Audrey: Oh, well, I just -- I was trying to tidy up, and I was putting these lovely little senate drawer liners in his drawer, trying to make him feel better. And he stormed in, and he started yelling nasty accusations at me.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's not you. It really isn't. He's just not the same since Vienna left.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Audrey: Yeah, so he takes it out on me, his poor mother? Why not? Better me than somebody he actually cares about.",
        "Katie: I'll get you a tissue.",
        "Audrey: Oh, I'm sorry!",
        "Brad: I'll get you some water.",
        "Audrey: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Audrey: Yeah, it's me. I'm ready to move. Yeah, it's time. I'll be ready.",
        "Katie: Did you say something?",
        "[Audrey gasps]",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Audrey: No, just crying.",
        "Katie: Oh, here.",
        "Audrey: Oh, thank you.",
        "[Audrey blows nose]",
        "Audrey: Oh. Oh, thank you so much. It's so nice of you. You know, mm, mm, it's so great that Henry has such special, cute friends like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You make it sound like I just ran off and forgot about you.",
        "Teri: Didn't you?",
        "Janet: Is that what they told you?",
        "Teri: They told me that you were irresponsible and rebellious, and that's why you ran away.",
        "Janet: Oh, they told you I ran away?",
        "Teri: Didn't you? You were my favorite person, Jan, and then one day, you just disappeared without even saying goodbye.",
        "Janet: Teresa --",
        "Teri: They told me I'd get over it, but, you know, I never did. I -- I waited for you to come back or call me or send me a postcard or something.",
        "Janet: I did.",
        "Teri: What?",
        "Janet: I did. I sent you letters. I sent you Christmas presents and birthday presents.",
        "Teri: No, you didn't!",
        "Janet: I did every year! I even sent you money so you could come visit me.",
        "Teri: I never got anything like that from you.",
        "Janet: They kept it from you because they didn't want you to turn out like me.",
        "Teri: Why?",
        "Janet: I didn't just disappear, Teresa. They threw me out. They sent me to go live with Aunt Marie in Michigan and told me to never come back again.",
        "Teri: Why would they do that?",
        "Janet: Because of her.",
        "Liberty: Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Teri: \"Mom\"?",
        "Janet: This is Liberty Ciccone, my daughter. She's the reason they kept you away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: How are you gonna convince my dad?",
        "Craig: Oh, my. It sounds like you might actually want to do this.",
        "Parker: Well, I mean, if there's a way for me to make a lot of money without having to go to school --",
        "Rosanna: That's not the argument you want to make to your father.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but why should I learn chemistry or algebra when I can get paid to stand in front of a camera?",
        "Craig: Spoken like a true American boy.",
        "Parker: It was your idea.",
        "Craig: And I'll make it work.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. Anyway, I -- I got to get back up to \"Zombie Occupation.\" It -- it's an online video game. My resistance cell is about to launch a mission. So if you guys need me, I'll be upstairs.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Craig: Well, I sleep better knowing the future is in their hands.",
        "[Rosanna chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: You're the one who wants to convince his father to let him be a model instead of going back to school. You know, we could get someone else.",
        "Craig: Ed wants Parker, and we want Ed's money.",
        "Rosanna: Only if Jack says it's okay.",
        "Craig: He will. Have a little faith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Your daughter?",
        "Janet: You didn't know?",
        "Teri: They never told me. So wait, she's --",
        "Janet: She's the reason they sent me away.",
        "Teri: Oh, my God.",
        "Liberty: Mom, is this Aunt Teresa?",
        "Teri: You know who I am?",
        "Liberty: Well, yeah. We -- we found your Friendbook page, 'cause I always really wanted to know what my relatives looked like. And -- Mom, why did you never tell me she was coming to Oakdale?",
        "Janet: I didn't know!",
        "Liberty: This is so cool. Mom always said that you were her favorite.",
        "Teri: I'm Teri.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Liberty: Liberty.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Teri: \"Liberty.\" That's a really nice name. You are so beautiful.",
        "Janet: I know. Isn't she?",
        "Liberty: Oh, stop. Stop it. How long are you staying?",
        "Teri: Oh, I don't -- I don't know for sure.",
        "Janet: Well, she has -- uh, she has a job here. She's gonna be taking care of Parker and Sage.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Liberty: Seriously? I thought -- I thought that their aunt was staying with them.",
        "Janet: Well, she is, but they need some extra help, and they all, like, ran into each other in Chicago. They met there. They had no idea who anybody was.",
        "Liberty: This is so crazy, really. I -- I have never known another Ciccone.",
        "Teri: Well, you do now.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Janet: Yay! Hey, what -- what's going on? What about the internship thing? You're not finished yet, are you?",
        "Liberty: It's over.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but you got two more weeks to go.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it's just there's a change of plans.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Teri: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, Teri. Um, how would you feel about adding a few guests for dinner?",
        "Teri: Oh, invite whoever you want.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Craig already did. Um, Jack and Janet.",
        "Teri: I'm with Janet right now. She hasn't mentioned it.",

        "Craig: -- And why you used to like me. Uh, a little.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my goodness. Don't push it.",
