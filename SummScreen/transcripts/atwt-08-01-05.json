        "Gwen: You want fries or a salad with that?",
        "Lily: A salad.",
        "Keith: Oh, come on, take the fries. Live a little.",
        "Lily: Hey! Oh, when did you get back? Sorry.",
        "Keith: Actually, a little while ago. But I was gonna wait and call you tomorrow, 'cause I know it's kinda late.",
        "Lily: Oh, how was your trip?",
        "Keith: Trip was good. In and out. Piece of cake. Walk in the park.",
        "Lily: No more details?",
        "Keith: I'll tell you all about it tomorrow, when I pay you the next installment on the loan. 'Cause the beauty of this trip was they paid me in cash.",
        "Lily: How many times do I have to tell you? You do not have to pay me back.",
        "Keith: No. I pay my debts. Especially to the girl that I love.",
        "Lily: Oh. I'm glad you're back.",
        "Keith: Yeah, me, too. Come on, let's go over here.",
        "Lily: You know, that eye is starting to look a little better.",
        "Keith: You think so?",
        "Lily: Yeah. You know, my mother doesn't buy the story about you walking into a door.",
        "Keith: What a surprise.",
        "Lily: Don't take it personally. I don't think she would like anybody, unless it was --",
        "Keith: Unless it was Holden, huh?",
        "Lily: I'm ignoring her. Okay? You do the same.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? In this case, your mother's right. I -- I lied to you.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me. Can I see that for a minute?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Paul. How are you holding up?",
        "Paul: I'm -- thanks. I appreciate you asking that, Jack. I don't even know how to answer you.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I understand. Talked to the clinic since Rosanna was transferred?",
        "Paul: There's no change yet. But she's a very strong woman. I'm sure she'll -- she'll come out of this.",
        "Jack: I'm with you on that.",
        "Paul: Did they ship Craig off to state yet?",
        "Jack: No, not that I know of. But they will. It's only a matter of time.",
        "Paul: I want that bastard as far away from this town, as far away from the people that I care about as you can get him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, me, too. Trust me. Craig will get what's coming to him. But you gotta let it go and let the justice system work.",
        "Paul: Where's the justice for Rosanna?",
        "Jack: I know there's nothing anybody can do or say that's gonna bring Rosanna back, but you gotta rest assured that Craig will get what he deserves.",
        "Paul: He'd better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Listen, Craig's gonna say anything to you right now. You can't take this seriously. You don't deserve what happened to you. The only one who deserves what's coming to him is Craig.",
        "Jennifer: If they ever catch him.",
        "Dusty: He won't get far.",
        "Jennifer: What if he's not running? What if he's planning on settling some scores? Maybe he thinks that he's got nothing left to lose.",
        "Dusty: No. He's unpredictable. But he's not gonna get to you. I won't let it happen.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Hal: Hal Munson.",
        "Dusty: Hal, it's Dusty. I just wanted to let you know that Jen's over here with me at the Lakeview.",
        "Hal: Oh, thank God. I've been worried sick. She was supposed to stay put at Java.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'll let you talk to her. She'll explain.",
        "Jennifer: Hi, Daddy.",
        "Hal: Honey, you had me frantic here. Are you okay?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Have you caught Craig?",
        "Hal: No, but we're on him. We will. Don't worry. Listen, do you want me to send a cop to be with you, just to be safe?",
        "Jennifer: Dad, I don't need a bodyguard.",
        "Dusty: Hal, I won't let Jen out of my sight. Okay?",
        "Hal: Thanks, Dusty. Hey. Make my day. Tell me you've got a lead on Craig.",
        "Margo: As a matter of fact, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly, Carly, Carly. I am just here to see my son.",
        "Carly: How did you get out? There's no way you made bail, not after what you did.",
        "Craig: What happened to Rosanna was not my fault. They have no right to hold me responsible.",
        "Carly: You ran her off the road!",
        "Craig: It was an accident!",
        "Carly: All right! Just be quiet. Don't -- don't scare the baby.",
        "Craig: No, that's the last thing I want to do, okay? So let us not let things get ugly here.",
        "Carly: Believe me, that's the last thing I wanna do. All right, you can see him. Just don't take him out of the carriage, all right? It took forever to get him to go to sleep.",
        "Craig: Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So, you were lying? You didn't really walk into a door?",
        "Keith: Come on. You don't buy that story any more than your mother did.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe not. Trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Figured somebody should.",
        "Keith: Thank you.",
        "Lily: So what happened?",
        "Keith: I'd rather not say.",
        "Lily: Oh -- aren't we past the place of keeping secrets?",
        "Keith: I just -- just don't wanna talk about it right now. Besides, we do need to keep a little mystery, don't we?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Keith: Yes. Now, how is Luke?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know anymore. He's -- angry at the world.",
        "Keith: Right. Typical teenager.",
        "Lily: Yes, teenager. Add that on top of everything else that's going on. It's been awful.",
        "Keith: Well, you want some advice?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Keith: Ah, you know, don't push him. Don't crowd him. Just keep an eye on him.",
        "Lily: Okay. All right, I'll try.",
        "Keith: Okay.",
        "Lily: He won't talk about it, but I know he's struggling with the divorce. He's not ready for Holden or me to move on.",
        "Keith: What about you? Are you ready?",
        "Lily: You know the answer to that.",
        "Keith: Do I?",
        "Lily: Yes. We just have to take things slowly right now, with everything that's going on. That's all.",
        "Keith: Okay. Well -- I willing to wait. You're worth waiting for.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Gwen: Here you go, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Lily: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Gwen: And yours will be up in a few minutes.",
        "Keith: Okay.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Keith: So -- see you tomorrow?",
        "Lily: Yeah, call me in the morning.",
        "Keith: As soon as I open my eyes.",
        "Lily: Well, good.",
        "Keith: You're not making this easy.",
        "Gwen: Hey, thanks for coming.",
        "Will: What's wrong?",
        "Manager: Hey, Gwen. You're still on the clock here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, look, I'm sorry. It's just -- it's kind of an emergency. Can you give me a minute?",
        "Manager: Make it quick. Don't wanna regret taking you back.",
        "Gwen: Did you see this?",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. It's horrible what happened to Rosanna. Paul thinks it's all Craig's fault. I hope they lock him up for a long time. But why are you worried about it?",
        "Gwen: Rosanna and Craig Montgomery are the ones who took my baby. They're the adoptive parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Maybe I should hope that Craig does come after me. That might be the best way for them to catch him.",
        "Dusty: No, they're not gonna use you or anyone else as bait. Put Craig Montgomery out of your mind, would you? Have you given any thought of when you might wanna come back to work?",
        "Jennifer: Back to street jeans? Dusty, I can hardly go from one hour to the next. I don't -- you think I could handle a day of work?",
        "Dusty: Might be good for you.",
        "Jennifer: You think?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I need you to handle all the crazy people. I mean, I had this lady call me the other day, trying to convince me that puce was the new black.",
        "Jennifer: Puce?",
        "Dusty: Puce. I don't even know what that color is. But something tells me it's not very good.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, it's not.",
        "Dusty: See? See your face now? That's what I'm talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Paul, I know it's tough for you to let it go right now, but getting caught in the wreckage -- that's not gonna help anybody. Let the law handle Craig. It's the best form of justice for Rosanna and that little boy she adopted.",
        "Paul: How is that little boy?",
        "Jack: Good. Good. Carly's at home with him right now. We're gonna take good care of him. Don't worry. But you gotta take good care of yourself. And be there for Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Nothing's gonna be okay until Craig goes to jail.",
        "Jack: He will. Very soon.",
        "Paul: I've gotta go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly, I just wanna spend some time with my son. Then I'll be gone. Unless you get in my way again. So please don't.",
        "Carly: I've been through the wars with you, Craig. And I don't scare quite as easily as I used to.",
        "Craig: I had to bust out of jail for this, Carly! They're trying to take my son away from me! My wife is in a coma!",
        "Carly: And she may never wake up, thanks to you. You have no claim to that child. I don't want you in my house, so get the hell out!",
        "Craig: Oh, I can't do that, not yet. Can't do that.",
        "Carly: So what are you gonna do?",
        "Craig: I am going to make things right.",
        "Carly: You maniac. You're here to take him, aren't you? You don't really think that I'm gonna let you walk out that door with that baby?",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm certain of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I don't know how you do it.",
        "Dusty: Do what?",
        "Jennifer: Somehow, you always manage to make me smile.",
        "Dusty: I do it for selfish reasons. You know, to protect the business, our business.",
        "Jennifer: Ah, yeah. You're protecting me. You know, you keep me going. You give me strength when I really just would rather give up.",
        "Dusty: Come on. You're too strong to ever give up.",
        "Jennifer: No, I'm not as strong as you think.",
        "Dusty: You're stronger than you know.",
        "Jennifer: Would you just take the compliment, please?",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Anytime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You gave your baby away to Craig Montgomery? What were you thinking?",
        "Gwen: Look, I didn't know anything about him at the time. And Rosanna seemed like a really sweet person. Your brother really thinks that he was trying to kill her when he ran her off the road?",
        "Will: I wouldn't be surprised. Craig's capable of anything. Paul's putting up a brave front, but I think he's really worried that Rosanna's not gonna make it.",
        "Gwen: Does that mean that Craig's gonna raise my kid on his own?",
        "Will: No, of course not. He's been arrested, and he's gonna be locked up for a long time.",
        "Gwen: So what's gonna happen to my son?",
        "Will: I don't know. Maybe social services will step in and find a new home for him.",
        "Gwen: Just with anyone, and I won't have a say in it?",
        "Will: I think that's out of your hands now, Gwen. I guess you could offer to take the baby back. I don't know what your chances would be of getting him, but you've got 30 days to change your mind, right?",
        "Gwen: Oh, I don't know, Will. I'm not any more ready to be a mom now than I was then. But I do wanna know that my kid's in a good home, with people who are gonna love him and take care of him.",
        "Will: You know what? I'll talk to my father. He's heading up the investigation. And it could be he knows where your baby's gonna end up.",
        "Gwen: Would you ask him? Please?",
        "Will: Sure. You just try not worry, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Are you gonna keep dancing around this, or are you gonna tell me what you know about Craig?",
        "Margo: I don't know anything. It's just a hunch. But I'd really like it if you'd let me go this on my own.",
        "Hal: Margo, if you think I'm gonna let you go after Montgomery by yourself, think again. He's like a cornered rat right now. He's lashing out at everything that gets near him.",
        "Margo: Exactly. And I'm his sister. He's not gonna hurt me. In fact, I think I'm the only person who can get through to him right now.",
        "Hal: I don't like it, not one bit.",
        "Margo: Well, if I get into trouble, I'll squeal for help. I always do.",
        "Hal: At least tell me where you're going.",
        "Margo: No, not a shot. You'll follow me. Hal -- you've gotta trust me on this.",
        "Hal: You'd better be right about it. And you keep me posted. What can I do for you, Paul?",
        "Paul: You can tell me Craig Montgomery's on his way to state prison.",
        "Hal: He will be.",
        "Paul: \"Will be\"? What's taking you so long?",
        "Hal: Look, I know you're upset about Rosanna, but I'm not gonna discuss an ongoing investigation with you.",
        "Paul: Ongoing? There's nothing ongoing about it. He's been caught. Tell me Craig's on his way to prison, and then I'm out of here.",
        "Hal: There's been some complications.",
        "Paul: What kind of complications?",
        "Hal: Craig got away from us.",
        "Paul: He what?",
        "Hal: He started a fire in the interrogation room. All hell broke loose, and he managed to get out of the building in the chaos. But he won't get far.",
        "Paul: He better not get far. After what he did to Rosanna, if he escapes, if you allow him to escape, Hal, I will never let you forget it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Get away from that baby. Get away from him.",
        "Craig: Come on, Carly! If anybody should understand what I'm going through, it's you. Okay? This child is my only chance at some kind of redemption here.",
        "Carly: Redemption? It's too late for that, Craig.",
        "Craig: Yes, well -- my life here was ruined a long time ago. Not all my fault, really. But you know what it's like to live in the shadow of your mistakes, don't you?",
        "Carly: This is not about me.",
        "Craig: Well, it's about second chances.",
        "Carly: Do you honestly think you have the right to take that baby?",
        "Craig: I will love this baby as my own.",
        "Carly: No. Craig, you were going to adopt him. That's not quite the same thing as subjecting him to a life on the run.",
        "Craig: A future for this child is what I promised Rosanna. It was what she would want.",
        "Carly: You think that's what she would want? For you to raise that child while trying to stay one step ahead of the police? Honestly? That's really what you think Rosanna would want for that baby?",
        "Craig: I promise you, Carly, no one will ever find us.",
        "Carly: Do you really think you're gonna get away with that?",
        "Craig: It's what your sister wants.",
        "Carly: I don't know. Craig, I -- I really don't know. You know, you're putting me in a very tough spot here.",
        "Craig: Well, my back is against the wall!",
        "Carly: It's more like you're on the edge of a cliff, I'd say.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Hey, Carly. What's up? Carly? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Keith: Hi, Lily.",
        "Lily: Oh, hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: A man put my wife in a coma!",
        "Hal: Ex-wife. Remember? You've moved on.",
        "Jack: Hey, honey. It's me. Did you just try to call me?",
        "Craig: I am taking what is mine.",
        "Carly: No. Craig \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No, Luke, of course you can spend the night at Greg's house, as long as his parents are okay with it. No, I don't have to talk to the parents. As long as they said it was okay. Or, you know, you could bring Greg over here. I hardly ever see you anymore. We could make popcorn, watch a movie. We could -- right. That's lame, hanging out with mom, watching a movie. I know. All right, well, you have a good time. Be careful. And I'll talk to you in the morning. I love you. [Knock at window] Oh! Oh.",
        "Keith: Hi, Lily.",
        "Lily: Well, hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Keith: Well, I'm being a little daring and romantic.",
        "Lily: You're crazy! Where did you get the ladder?",
        "Keith: I got the ladder up against the garage. Your construction crew must've left it.",
        "Lily: You're insane. You're nuts.",
        "Keith: I am nuts. I'm nuts, madly in love with you.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Keith: Can I come in? Or do I have to dangle out here?",
        "Lily: Oh, yeah, sorry. Come on in. Careful. Easy. Oh, boy! Ah! You could've killed yourself.",
        "Keith: No, I'm a pilot. Heights don't bother me.",
        "Lily: So what are you really doing here?",
        "Keith: I missed you. A lot.",
        "Lily: I just saw you at al's diner. It was only, like, a half hour ago.",
        "Keith: What can I say? Can't get you out of my mind. You know when I told you that I'd wait as long as it took?",
        "Lily: Yes. It made my night.",
        "Keith: Well, I lied. I can't wait. I can't wait another moment.",
        "Lily: Ooh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We don't have to come back right away, you know. We could always take another loop around the block.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. No, I'm fine. I just -- you know, I couldn't sit down anymore. I was too nervous.",
        "Dusty: Wanna call your dad? Maybe he's got a lead on Craig by now.",
        "Jennifer: Well, even if they do, he wouldn't tell us. He has a way of getting into what I used to call \"top-secret cop\" mode. Yeah, when I was 12 or 13, I remember I would be watching the news, and there would be some case that he was working on. And I would ask him details, you know. Forget it. He was as silent as a sphinx.",
        "Dusty: What else did you do at 12, besides wrap Daddy around your finger?",
        "[Jennifer chuckles]",
        "Jennifer: The usual. You know, scream at my brother to get out of my room, and pig out on banana smoothies with my friends. Oh, and stare in the mirror at my braces, just waiting, wondering when I would see my teeth again.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry I missed the braces.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Yeah. Braces and red hair at 12. It was really the ultimate.",
        "Dusty: So when did you morph into this beautiful butterfly?",
        "Jennifer: You think I don't know what you're doing?",
        "Dusty: What am I doing?",
        "Jennifer: Anything you can to keep me from thinking about Craig. [Dusty snickers] Pretty soon, you're gonna ask me what I wore to my junior prom.",
        "Dusty: Well, if you designed it, we could always use it to launch that retro dress line you were coming up with. Remember that?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I didn't design it. I bought it at the mall, which my mother hated, which made me love it even more, so -- what did you wear to your junior prom?",
        "Dusty: Who says I was so uncool to go to the prom?",
        "Jennifer: Well, then how about braces?",
        "Dusty: Oh, no braces. Nothing like that. I was born perfect.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well, this is not fair, because you know all this stuff about me, and I don't get to know anything about Dusty Donovan when he was 12.",
        "Dusty: But who cares? We gotta track you down a banana smoothie. You like that idea, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: A building full of trained professionals, and Craig just waltzes out of here? How does that happen?!",
        "Hal: I told you. He started a fire.",
        "Paul: Well, there doesn't seem to be any damage. You dropped the ball on this one, Hal. He split. He's walking around out there a free man?!",
        "Hal: We're doing everything we can to track him down.",
        "Paul: Like what?",
        "Hal: I'm under no obligation to tell you how --",
        "Paul: I have every right to know. The man put my wife in a coma!",
        "Hal: Ex -wife, remember? You've moved on.",
