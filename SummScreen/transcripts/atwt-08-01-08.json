        "Paul: You in pain?",
        "Meg: Yes, I am in pain from a very over-protective husband.",
        "Paul: Wow.",
        "Meg: Oh, he's kissing me. Wait. Why did you stop?",
        "Meg: You know, if I didn't love you so much, I would tell you to get a life.",
        "Paul: I have a life. I have some interesting ideas about what to do with it. You want to hear them?",
        "Meg: After lunch. You're taking me out.",
        "Paul: Meg, look, I know you're bored sitting around the house like this, but you're not 100%.",
        "Meg: Fresh air and exercise are good for me. And who's the medical expert here, anyway? I am going out to lunch. So, is it gonna be with you or without you?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: Shouldn't you get that?",
        "Meg: No. I think you should get that and also thank whoever's calling for saving you from the argument you were about to lose. I'm sure Barbara won't mind me wearing this one more time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why did I ever want to be a nurse?",
        "Aaron: So you can help people and make descent money at the same time.",
        "Alison: See? Now, that's smart. That is very smart thinking. What happened to that smart brain of mine, and why does mine keep going all loopy?",
        "Aaron: Well, maybe because you're trying to study in a hotel instead of home.",
        "Alison: I can't concentrate at home. It just takes me right back to high school, and all I can think about is failing again.",
        "Aaron: Alison, you're not gonna fail. And then, you know, all of a sudden, all the names of 10 zillion little bones and capillaries and nerves start flying out of my head.",
        "Aaron: You've got to find a way to chill out.",
        "Alison: I keep trying to take deep breaths, but --",
        "Aaron: Ali, your hands are shaking. You have a fever or something?",
        "Alison: No, no. I'm fine. My mother just checked me out.",
        "Aaron: Okay, then what's going on with you? And don't say it's about the grades.",
        "Aaron: Why are you leaving?",
        "Alison: I am going to try to study at the hospital. That might work a little better. There are some other nursing students who get together before a class and cram, and we can all be neurotic together because, Aaron, it is all about the grades.",
        "Aaron: Okay, well, call me if you need me.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey, Dad. Hey, Dad. Sorry I'm late. I misplaced my watch. I can't find it anywhere.",
        "Bob: Well, at least you seem to be better. Any more symptoms?",
        "[Chris remembering]",
        "Alison: For God's sakes, you are butt naked right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: No, no. I've been fine. Just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Can I get you anything else? Some coffee, or --",
        "Casey: No. You don't have to make up for anything. I'm not mad.",
        "Emily: Well, you should be, really. The way I went off on you and Alison.",
        "Casey: Alison is your sister. I would never hit on her.",
        "Emily: I know that. I don't know what happened to me. It was like some alien took over my body and turned me into this jealous raving lunatic.",
        "Casey: Well, it's over now, right? And you know you're my girl. It's always gonna be that way.",
        "Emily: Did you just call me your girl?",
        "Casey: My one and only.",
        "Emily: Oh. I'm convinced, and I'll never be jealous again, I swear. I got to go.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Emily: I got to go! Oh, I'm late! I got an appointment. I'm interviewing Officer Banks. Remember, I was telling you about --",
        "Casey: Wait, wait, wait. And you want to smell good for Officer Banks? You trying to make me jealous?",
        "Emily: Officer Banks is my source. You are my guy. And this spritz is for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Feeling better? All right, so tell me what happened?",
        "Alison: You promise me you won't get into a fight with Chris?",
        "Aaron: I never lie to you. If Chris Hughes hurt you, I will hurt him.",
        "Alison: No, he didn't hurt me. I mean, not exactly.",
        "Aaron: Okay, but did he scare you? Did he pressure you into having sex?",
        "Alison: No, no. It was just -- it was strange. I was at the hospital, and I went into the on-call room, and -- and Chris was there.",
        "Aaron: I thought he didn't work there anymore.",
        "Alison: He doesn't, but he was in there, and -- I mean, there is just no way that I can say this to you that you're not gonna freak out.",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna freak out if you don't say anything, so --",
        "Alison: He was naked.",
        "Aaron: Seriously? Naked? Well, was he just standing there naked? Did he say anything?",
        "Alison: He just -- he seemed confused.",
        "Aaron: Well, you think?",
        "Alison: I'm serious, Aaron. He didn't know how he got there or why his clothes were off.",
        "Aaron: Okay, if that's what he said to you, he's lying. And you know he's lying.",
        "Alison: I didn't think so then, but when I just saw him out in the lobby -- I don't know. I don't know what to think. I just know that I don't want to see him. I don't even want to walk past him, but I have to get to the hospital, and I have to go to class.",
        "Aaron: All right. So, we'll take the back way.",
        "Alison: I didn't even think that. I must really be losing it.",
        "Aaron: Listen, you have a lot on your mind. You want me to go with you?",
        "Alison: No, I'm fine. I'm okay. But promise me you won't do anything crazy.",
        "Aaron: I won't do anything crazy. I have to go to work. I can't get arrested. I promise I won't beat up Chris Hughes to a bloody pulp. Satisfied?",
        "Alison: Thank you, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Okay. But I'll break his face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Have you taken any new vitamins? Any supplements of any kind?",
        "Chris: Nothing at all that's sketchy. They found a compound in my blood. Did they give you a name?",
        "Bob: That's what's baffling about it. They can't identify it. Are you sure --",
        "Chris: Dad, I'm a doctor. I know better than to put any mystery drugs in my body.",
        "Bob: Well, if you have some new symptoms, I'd order some more tests, but since you say you haven't --",
        "Chris: Actually, Dad, I've been --",
        "Aaron: What's wrong with you, man? Why can't you just leave her alone.",
        "Chris: I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Aaron: Either you stop messing with Alison or I'm gonna stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: Wow.",
        "Meg: Thanks.",
        "Paul: No. Thank you.",
        "Meg: Where did that music come from?",
        "Paul: What music?",
        "Meg: You heard the music. You are just messing with me. Didn't anybody tell you that's impolite to tease the invalid?",
        "Paul: I don't hear any music.",
        "Meg: Well, it stopped just as you walked in. You didn't hear it?",
        "Paul: Okay, on our way to lunch, we'll stop by the hospital, and Susan can take a quick look at you.",
        "Meg: I don't need to be looked at, Paul. Look, it's my first day out after almost being killed by a madman. I'm not gonna waste anymore time, okay?",
        "Paul: You fight dirty.",
        "Meg: Well, you taught me. Let's go.",
        "Paul: I just, uh... look, I'm a little worried about you.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? I keep getting stronger every day, and I am not crazy.",
        "Paul: Well, you married me a couple of times, so you probably have a screw loose somewhere.",
        "Meg: Oh, likewise.",
        "Paul: It took us forever to get here. I'd like for it to last.",
        "Meg: Let's go have some fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I mean, what was your plan? Were you gonna jump her? Or did you think she just couldn't resist with you standing in front of her butt-naked?",
        "Bob: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: Dad, can you give me a minute to clear this up?",
        "Aaron: Your son got naked in front of Alison, decided to flash her at the hospital.",
        "Bob: That's absurd.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, I'm still waiting for him to deny it.",
        "Bob: He doesn't have to deny.",
        "Chris: Dad --",
        "Bob: Listen, the last time that you attacked Chris, I asked him not to press charges against you, but this constitutes harassment.",
        "Aaron: I'm not making this up. Go ahead and ask him.",
        "Bob: Well?",
        "Chris: It was the day I got sick at the golf course, Dad, and you ok my blood sample. I blacked out.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you bl -- what?!",
        "Chris: And then the next thing I knew, Alison was standing there, and I had taken off my clothes without being conscious of it.",
        "Aaron: You knew exactly what you were doing.",
        "Chris: I explained it to her, all right? She understood. She wasn't upset.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, you know what? She is upset. So stay away from her. And keep your damn pants on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Alison, I need to talk to you.",
        "Alison: Uh, Mom, can it wait till I get home? I need to get some studying done before class. Okay. How am I supposed to get better grades if I don't have time to study?",
        "Susan: Look, I didn't want you to be blindsided by this, but I ran into Brenda. And she told me that you got a \"C\" minus on your last exam. One less point, it would have been a \"D.\"",
        "Alison: Well, that doesn't seem right. A \"C\" minus?",
        "Susan: You got a \"C\" on your last assignment before this.",
        "Alison: I'm aware of that, Mother.",
        "Susan: Look, all I'm saying is things aren't improving. Maybe you went back to school too soon. Maybe -- maybe you should consider withdrawing.",
        "Alison: You want me to give up?",
        "Susan: Just take some time off. Get some tutoring.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Susan: Ali, if you keep going on the way you're going, you could end up failing and never get another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I asked you if you had any more symptoms.",
        "Chris: And I haven't, not since that day. It's over. It's not an issue.",
        "Bob: Hardly. You actually blacked out?",
        "Chris: No, Dad. I just purposely took off my pants in the on-call room, hoping Alison Stewart would show up.",
        "Bob: Look, this is serious.",
        "Chris: Don't blow this out of proportion, okay? I don't work for you anymore, which means Alison can't sue the hospital --",
        "Bob: I'm not concerned about the hospital. It's you I'm concerned about. You.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry.",
        "Bob: What's the last thing you remember?",
        "Chris: The last thing I remember was my skin was feeling supersensitive, like I didn't want anything to touch it -- not my clothes, not anything. And then the next instant, Alison was there.",
        "Bob: We're gonna do an MRI. We got to find out what's going on with you, and the sooner, the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You don't have to be embarrassed about this. Nursing school is tough. But if we set you up with a couple of good tutors, we get you help with your study skills --",
        "Alison: What I need is for you to stop spying on me.",
        "Susan: I didn't go looking for this information.",
        "Alison: I am a grown woman! I don't need you to monitor my grades!",
        "Susan: I wasn't!",
        "Alison: And I don't need you to keep telling me that I'm a failure and a screw-up!",
        "Susan: That's not what I said, Alison.",
        "Alison: I know what I am. And I don't need you rubbing it in my face. So just go away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, I hear before you became a cop you were a bodyguard to a few celebrities.",
        "Cop: I can't really talk about that. They made us sign a confidentiality agreement.",
        "Emily: Right, right. Well, what if I cross my heart and swear I'll never tell where I got the information?",
        "Margo: Banks.",
        "Cop: Yes, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: If you're finished giving the statement on the home invasion, I'm sure that there are other crimes that need solving.",
        "Cop: Yes, Ma'am. See you around.",
        "Emily: Bye. Well, you really know how to blow the wind up.",
        "Margo: What? Come on, Emily, don't leave me hanging.",
        "Emily: You know what? I don't need -- I don't need to trade insults with you. But I can see you're ready to light into me, so go ahead. Give it your best shot. What you got?",
        "Margo: As tempting as that is, no thank you.",
        "Emily: \"No thank you\"? What's going on with you?",
        "Margo: I simply decided to back off, not to trouble you anymore. Have a nice day.",
        "Emily: What brought this on?",
        "Margo: Casey.",
        "Emily: You spoke to Casey about me?",
        "Margo: No, no, no. I didn't have to do that. I just thought about what kind of person my son is, his likes, his dislikes, his youth, his short attention span, and I realized I don't have to do anything to get you out of his life. He'll get sick of you all on his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, it feels so good to be out of the house. You know what? I am starving. Could we eat in the lounge? That's quicker.",
        "Paul: You're sure you're all right?",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? That's it. I want you to go upstairs right now and ask your mom to join us for lunch.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Meg: Because it's my first lunch out, and I would rather have a real conversation than somebody asking me over and over and over again if I'm all right.",
        "Paul: Okay. All right. You'll go get us a table. I'll be right back.",
        "Aaron: Meg? Are you all right?",
        "Meg: Funny you should ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What's with the dizzy spell? You playing the sympathy card now?",
        "Emily: You can insult me all you want, but one of these days you're just gonna have to accept it. Casey and I are committed to each other.",
        "Margo: Really? For how long?",
        "Emily: I love your son, Margo. This is a long-term relationship.",
        "Margo: For you, maybe, but what about him? I mean, have you looked in a mirror lately?",
        "Emily: Yeah, you know what? I have. And Casey likes what he sees.",
        "Margo: Casey likes what he gets from you -- all sex, all the time. But have you really looked at yourself compared to someone his own age, what you're gonna look like to him before too long?",
        "Emily: You know what? Our relationship has more substance than you could possibly imagine.",
        "Margo: Substance is it? Well, what happens when he gets tired of explaining his old lady to his young friends? And what happens when he dumps you for some fresh-faced college girl?",
        "Emily: Don't talk to me that way!",
        "Margo: There are penalties for assaulting an officer. Emily, control yourself.",
        "Emily: Hmph! I apologize.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Ali, wait. I thought you promised you weren't gonna say anything about what happened in there.",
        "Alison: I never promised you anything.",
        "Chris: Well, you know what? If you were so traumatized, you could have said something to me instead of running off to Aaron.",
        "Alison: I didn't run to --look, I don't have time. I have more important things on my mind right now, so stop stalking me and leave me alone!",
        "[Alison goes around the corner and Chris follows her and hides behind the corner]",
        "[Alison calls Aaron on her cell phone] Aaron, why aren't you there? I need you. I don't know what to do. I-I -- I feel like I'm loosing it, like I'm -- I'm wrecking my life. I'm -- m-my school, and everything, and I-I just -- I can't! I-I -- I'm just gonna go to the pond, okay? Can you meet me there please? Okay.",
        "[Alison leaves and Chris follows her]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mmm. That is perfect. You know, I just got overheated. It's really hot out there.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, it is. Everybody's been worried about you. Especially Grandma.",
        "Meg: You know what? There's nothing to worry about. Will you please tell Mama that for me?",
        "Aaron: Okay, I will. I'm gonna get back to work.",
        "Meg: Thank you for the drink.",

        "Alison: What happened?",
        "Chris: You were drowning. You went underwater and you didn't come up.",
        "Alison: Why would I go swimming?",
        "Chris: Ali, Ali, Ali. The important thing now is to get you warm, okay? We got to get you to a hospital right now.",
        "Alison: No, I can't -- I can't go to the --",
        "Chris: Come on. We're going. Come on.",
        "Alison: What did I do? What did I just do?",
        "Chris: Ali, Ali. Don't worry about it. You're okay. We need to get you treatment. We need to make sure your lungs aren't infected.",
        "Alison: No, I can't go to the hospital. I can't. If they see me like this, they won't -- you can't tell anyone!",
        "Chris: Just come with me, okay? Trust me. I won't bring you there. I promise. Okay? Come on.",

        "Aaron: Damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You're not real. I'm imagining you.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I'm real, and I'm here. And I was waiting for the chance to talk to you, just us girls. I'm here to warn you, Meg. Think about what Paul did. I died in his arms, and he never even called the police. He buried me, and with me, my child. A child he thought was his. Knowing that, how -- how could you marry him, Meg? Only a monster would dispose of his own child without a second thought.",
        "Meg: That baby was not Paul's. He did not kill you, Cole did.",
        "Sofie: Are you sure about that? You and I both know how cold and how cruel your husband can be.",

        "Meg: Why are you saying these things right now? When you were at the wedding --",
