        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "\r\nPaul: Thank you for meeting me on short notice.",
        "\r\nJessica: No problem.",
        "\r\nPaul: Everything set for the trial?",
        "\r\nJessica: There may not be a trial.\u00a0 I've offered Cass Winthrop a plea\r\n\r\nbargain.",
        "\r\nPaul: What?\u00a0 No, no, no, you had no right to do that.",
        "\r\nJessica: I have every right to prosecute this case any way I see fit.",
        "\r\nPaul: What was the deal?",
        "\r\nJessica: Craig pleads guilty to aggravated assault and battery and serves\r\n\r\nfive years.",
        "\r\nPaul: So he gets out in two?",
        "\r\nJessica: That's better than him walking.",
        "\r\nPaul: Craig will not walk.",
        "\r\nJessica: There are holes in this case, Paul, holes any self-respecting\r\n\r\ndefense attorney can turn into more than enough reasonable doubt.",
        "\r\nPaul: Look, we have financial records proving he was embezzling money\r\n\r\nfrom B.R.O.\u00a0 He got caught, so he struck back.\u00a0 There's his motive.\u00a0 My\r\n\r\nmother's eyewitness testimony -- she saw him.\u00a0 She saw him at the boathouse.",
        "\r\nJessica: Your mother is emotionally on the brink.\u00a0 She's bitter, and she's\r\n\r\nangry, understandably, but I don't know how she's gonna hold up under cross-\r\nexamination, and we already talked about the fact that Craig has an alibi for\r\n\r\nthe night Barbara was attacked at the hospital.\u00a0 Carly Tenney swears they\r\n\r\nwere together, and opposing counsel could use that to prove that somebody \r\nelse is after Barbara.",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, Carly would swear Craig was volunteering at a homeless \r\nshelter, handing out biscuits, if she thought it would help get him off.",
        "\r\nJessica: Her statement is part of the record.",
        "\r\nPaul: Her lies are part of the record.\u00a0 She and Craig were plotting to get my\r\n\r\nmother out of the way, and I can't believe you're about to let them get away \r\nwith this.",
        "\r\nJessica: Show me the evidence, Paul.\u00a0 There's not one solid thing that links\r\n\r\nCarly to this crime.\u00a0 There's nothing in that briefcase that proves that Carly\r\n\r\nand Craig were ever more than just friends.\r\nMolly: Are you sure you're okay, Carly?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yeah.\u00a0 Yeah, I've been dodging trouble my entire life.\u00a0 Why should\r\n\r\nnow be any different?",
        "\r\nMolly: Well, if you stay away from Craig, maybe all the rumors will go\r\n\r\naway.",
        "\r\nCarly: Right, and maybe I'll win the lottery and retire in Jamaica.",
        "\r\nMolly: I'm just saying, okay, I saw the way he was looking at you, and\r\n\r\nthere's no way that he's gonna be giving up on you anytime soon.",
        "\r\nCarly: Craig is two sides short of a triangle.\u00a0 I love Jack, now and forever,\r\n\r\nno detours, no distractions.",
        "\r\nMolly: Yes.\u00a0 That is what I want to hear.",
        "\r\nCarly: You know, if I could just think of a way to keep Barbara from\r\n\r\nshowing up and singing some long, deluded aria in court.",
        "\r\nMolly: That is called tampering with the witness, which you've already\r\n\r\ntried, with very little success.\u00a0 So just don't rock the boat, okay?\u00a0 Jack's behind\r\n\r\nyou on this 100%, right?\u00a0 Right, okay, and so there's no real evidence against\r\n\r\nyou except for Craig, so just hang tight, keep your fingers crossed, and all this\r\n\r\ngoes away very soon.",
        "\r\nCarly: And I have to remind myself, just stay clear of smooth-talking\r\n\r\ndealmakers in $5,000 suits.\u00a0 From here on in, I am kissing trouble good-bye.\u00a0What is that?",
        "\r\nMolly: What's what?",
        "\r\nCarly: That.",
        "\r\nMolly: The security camera?",
        "\r\nCarly: Has that always been there?",
        "\r\nMolly: As far as I know.",
        "\r\nCarly: Right there?\u00a0 In that very spot, Molly?\u00a0 Are you sure?",
        "\r\nMolly: Yeah, I'm sure.\u00a0 Why?",
        "\r\nCarly: Because I am dead in the water, that's why.\u00a0 That little techno-\r\npeeping Tom could ruin my entire life.\u00a0  \r\n",

[Emily hangs up] Okay.\u00a0 Oh, I wish I\r\n\r\ncould show you mommy's cover that's gonna hit the streets.\u00a0 It's got a very\r\n\r\nicky man on it.\u00a0 He's done a lot of naughty things, but I don't think he's blown\r\n\r\nup any boathouses lately.\u00a0 Oh, one day you're gonna be so proud of me.\u00a0 I'm\r\n\r\ngonna teach you how to say \"Pulitzer.\"\u00a0 We've got to work on that.\u00a0 But in the\r\n\r\nmeantime, you are going to bed, okay?\u00a0 Put your pajamas on, cuddle with \r\nyour teddy, and then Mommy's gonna take a nice, hot bath and pretend she has \r\na life.\u00a0 \r\n",

        "\r\nMolly: Ouch.\u00a0 Oh, the timing sure does fit Barbara's conspiracy theory.",
