Paul and Emily share a joyous moment when they both feel the baby kick, as Meg watches. Margo demands Casey stay away from Maddie until the case is resolved, but Casey is angry that Maddie is considered a suspect and promises he will prove his mom wrong. Will meets Jade by the pond to give her the money for her apartment deposit and then tells her he needs space from her so he can focus on his marriage. Jade takes offense and lashes out because she thought they were friends. She kept their secret and did everything he asked because they are friends and now she sees he is offering her hush money because of the night they spent together; Maddie walks up as they are talking."

        "Susan: How's her pressure?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Climbing.",
        "Emily: What does that mean?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Emily, have you recently suffered from any headaches? Blurred vision?",
        "Emily: No. No, is it the baby?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, before I can answer that, I need you to relax while I run a few tests, okay?",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Emily: Okay, I heard the relax part, but what is she not saying? Mom, don't lie to me. Am I going to lose the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There's something's wrong with the baby.",
        "Meg: Was that Emily on the phone?",
        "Paul: No, it was the hospital. I guess I'm listed as the father.",
        "Meg: Well, did they say what was wrong?",
        "Paul: No, they just said that I should get there right away.",
        "Meg: Okay, then you better go.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: This is our own couch in our own cottage.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it's a little bit nicer than some of the places that we've lived. Like the backseat of your car.",
        "Will: You know, we were dying for that car when we were up on the roof that night.",
        "Gwen: That was so cold!",
        "Will: Or the boarded-up nightclub?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that was actually kind of scary. Because we could've starved to death if Maddie hadn't brought us food.",
        "Will: Yeah. I wish there were something we could do for her.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I know. But she's so shut down, which is totally unlike her. I mean, Maddie has an answer for everything.",
        "Will: That's the problem. I think, for the first time in her life, she's up against something that she can't solve.",
        "Gwen: Well, she definitely didn't kill Lia. I mean, why would she? Lia moved in on Casey after Maddie broke up with him.",
        "Will: And she's friends with Nate.",
        "Gwen: Maddie did not murder anybody. I will never believe that.",
        "Will: Yeah, the trouble is, is that half the school is gonna disagree with you.",
        "Gwen: I just feel bad for Casey, because everybody is saying she's guilty. And he's still crazy about her -- you know that he is.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. And his mom's, like, you know, keeping him away from her.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, what is it with mothers and their sons? We're definitely adopting girls.",
        "Will: That's fine by me.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Barbara: Will? Gwen? Hey, it's Mom! I heard the good news. I am so happy. I have always loved this little cottage. Especially when your sister lived here. I know you're going to make it your own. You're going to be very happy here.",
        "Will: Oh, thanks, we've already eaten.",
        "Barbara: My son, the comedian. It's a housewarming gift!",
        "Gwen: Would you like a cup of coffee, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: I've already had enough this morning, thank you.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Gwen: One sec --",
        "Barbara: Oh! Oh, no answering machine? I'll buy you one.",
        "Will: Mom, we don't need an answering machine. We have cell phones.",
        "Barbara: Honey, how are you going to screen your calls when you're at home without an answering machine? All those third world people will be calling you all day long. I'll buy you one.",
        "Will: Okay. If it makes you happy.",
        "Barbara: What makes me happy is seeing you happy. And seeing your little Gwen happy. She's got a smile on her face.",
        "Will: Well, we're really glad to have our own place.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I know. And I'm so glad for you. And I'm so glad you have your trust fund and you're putting it to such good use.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Honey, it's Jade. She's calling about the money.",
        "Barbara: What money?",
        "Gwen: Oh, we're helping Jade with a deposit so she can get her own place.",
        "Barbara: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Jade: If now's not a good time --",
        "Will: It's fine.",
        "Jade: It's just that all the landlords that I spoke to, they want a deposit before they show me anything, so --",
        "Will: It's not a problem. Where are you? I'm gonna bring the money.",
        "Jade: At Java. And I just want to thank you one more time. So, so, so, so, so much.",
        "Will: I'll see you in 15 minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Jade?",
        "Jade: What's up, Case?",
        "Casey: If you don't stop spreading rumors about Maddie, I'm gonna spread some about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maddie, the fresh air'll do you good.",
        "Maddie: I don't want to go out.",
        "Eve: It's just for a few hours. We'll go get a picnic from that little gourmet shop at the mall. We'll drive out to the country.",
        "Henry: Yeah, we'll talk to the cows. The sheeps.",
        "Eve: We'll relax.",
        "Henry: Yes, we'll relax -- you need to relax. You need to forget about everything that's happened the last few weeks.",
        "Eve: Because that's behind us. It's never going to happen again.",
        "Maddie: What do you mean?",
        "Eve: It's just -- I don't want you to worry, you know? About the terrible things that have happened to some of the kids that you know. That will never happen to you.",
        "Maddie: How do you know?",
        "Eve: You know what? Let's just go. It's a beautiful day, we don't want to waste it.",
        "Henry: It's a gorgeous day.",
        "Margo: Henry, Eve, I need a word with Maddie.",
        "Eve: We were just on our way out. I promised Maddie a picnic.",
        "Margo: Well, that'll have to wait. I need to have Maddie down to the station for a few questions.",
        "Maddie: About what? I already told you everything that I know. What more do you want?",
        "Margo: I want to know about those knives you took from Crash. Maddie! Maddie!",
        "Henry: Oh, come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, if there's something wrong with the baby, I'm the last person Emily wants by her bedside.",
        "Paul: Oh, now stop. Look, I don't care about Emily. I just care about you. I'm sorry I ruined our day.",
        "Meg: It's not your fault.",
        "Paul: I'm pretty sure this is just another one of Emily's tricks, but, you know, because it was the hospital that called, I should probably go down there.",
        "Meg: Yeah. So you should go. Go.",
        "Paul: Yeah? You'll be okay? I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, God, Mom, tell me I'm not in labor! It's too early to be in labor. This baby will not survive!",
        "Susan: Honey, we don't know why you're cramping. It could be for any number of reasons, a lot of them not serious at all.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but some them serious.",
        "Susan: Well, don't go jumping to conclusions. That's why Dr. Schiller has ordered the tests, okay?",
        "Emily: I cannot lose this baby. This baby saved my life. This baby was my second chance. It save Johnny's life -- it could be a girl. I mean, this baby could be a little sister for Daniel.",
        "Susan: That would be wonderful -- boy or girl, it'll be wonderful.",
        "Emily: What if I've done something wrong?",
        "Susan: Sweetie --",
        "Emily: Oh, God, Mom.",
        "Susan: You've done everything you could. You had excellent prenatal care, that's all you can do. The rest is up to God.",
        "Emily: What if God is punishing me?",
        "Susan: Well, that would put you right at the center of the universe, wouldn't it?",
        "Emily: No. No, no, no. What I did for Jennifer -- I gave her the stem cell. Maybe I did something. Maybe I took something from my baby that my baby needed.",
        "Susan: All your baby needs right now is for you to relax, like Dr. Schiller told you to. Come on, Sweetie, it's gonna be all right. I swear, it'll be all right, okay?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Susan: Okay. Try to calm down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You're very new to money. And you've got really good impulses. You want to share and take care of people, and that's very commendable. But you have to protect yourself, too.",
        "Gwen: Look, you may not believe this -- and I don't want to sound ungrateful -- but I really don't care about money. I mean, obviously we need the basics -- a place to live, tuition -- but it's not like I ever set out to be rich.",
        "Barbara: Okay, that's great. And that's very refreshing. But not everyone's like you. For some people, money is everything. And for those people in this world, they will do anything -- except work -- to get money.",
        "Gwen: Well, Jade's not like that.",
        "Barbara: You're not like that. You're an extremely hardworking young woman who has all kinds of goals for herself. You want a college career. You want a career in music. You want a good marriage. And all of that takes work. And you're willing to do it. And I don't think Jade has the same outlook on life. I mean, look what she did to the Snyders.",
        "Gwen: She feels really sorry about that.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I bet she does, because they threw her out. And then what happened? She cozied up to Will and she got him to learn how to download a paper. Would you have done that? No, you wouldn't have. You would have stayed up all night long before you ever would have bought somebody else's work and tried to pass it off as your own.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, they made a mistake.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's true, they did. So tell me, what does Jade want to do with her life, hmm? Does she have any plans? For college, for a career?",
        "Gwen: She -- she wants a home.",
        "Barbara: Don't we all?",
        "Gwen: You know, she's had a hard time.",
        "Barbara: Harder than you? No, I don't think so. It appears to me that she's a young woman who feels that she's entitled to a life that's better than the one that she has. But where's she going to get that life? From you? From Will? Gwen, you are not responsible for your friends' needs. Now, take a look here at what's happened. First you moved her into your sister's house, then you get her a job and now you're paying her rent. When is it going to stop?",
        "Will: Correct me if I'm wrong, Mom, but you gave me my trust fund, no strings attached?",
        "Barbara: Yes, darling, I did.",
        "Will: Well, then it's none of your business what we do with the money -- including helping Jade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I'm not spreading rumors.",
        "Casey: Oh, but you told my mom that Maddie killed Nate and Lia.",
        "Jade: I didn't say that.",
        "Casey: You implied it.",
        "Jade: Your mother is a cop. I gave her my statement.",
        "Casey: No, you volunteered your statement.",
        "Jade: How many more people have to get knifed, Casey?",
        "Casey: Maddie didn't do it, all right? She couldn't. And by you telling my mom what you saw, you just made her look guilty.",
        "Jade: Uh-uh, she's doing that all by herself.",
        "Casey: Oh, and what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Jade: She's acting guilty. When you talk to her, she won't even look at you.",
        "Casey: Maybe that's because all of her so-called friends think she's a murderer.",
        "Jade: Casey, she sliced up Lia's car with a butcher knife -- we all saw. The same kind of knife that Lia was killed with. And I know that you don't want to hear this, but maybe the thing that I saw her throwing over the bridge --",
        "Casey: It could have been anything.",
        "Jade: And then she went out with Nate and Nate ends up dead? Stabbed to death the same way Lia was killed. Look, if Maddie's not the killer, she's doing a damn good job of making everybody think that she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Would you like a cup of coffee?",
        "Eve: No thank you.",
        "Henry: You want to tell me how long Margo's going to keep my little sister barricaded in the interrogation room?",
        "Dallas: However long it takes to get to the truth.",
        "Eve: She's a minor, you know. We could put a stop to this right now.",
        "Dallas: Look, this is a capital case, ma'am. If your sister's involved, the law would treat her as an adult.",
        "Henry: What do you mean, \"involved\"? Maddie did not kill those kids. If you knew her, you'd know I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Dallas: Look, I know something happened to her in Chicago. Something bad happened to her, real bad. Her spirit was hurt. Okay? She ran away, and for the longest time, she's been acting as if nothing happened. But then she ran into me and it all changed.",
        "Henry: Oh, she into you? Okay, Dr. Phil, why don't you back up a second? Are you telling me that because she was sexually assaulted that now she's a serial killer?",
        "Dallas: I don't know. Do you think Maddie's been herself lately?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Eve: That doesn't mean anything.",
        "Dallas: Look, do you want to know why Maddie's so withdrawn? Why she's so distant from the world?",
        "Henry: Yeah, of course we want to know that!",
        "Dallas: Then why don't you start by telling me the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, do you recognize this knife? It's the one you used to slice up the upholstery of Lia's car. You took it from Crash. And now another knife has gone missing from Crash. And two kids are dead. Both Lia and Nate were killed with the same knife. Maddie? Where's the other knife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not trying to put myself in the center of the universe, I'm not. But what if some higher power or something is punishing me for all the horrible things I've done in my life?",
        "Susan: Baby, that's not a productive line of thought, okay?",
        "Emily: I'm serious.",
        "Susan: I know, but you've got to relax. Just relax. I'm gonna go find Dr. Schiller.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, don't go -- just stay with me, please don't go, Mom.",
        "Susan: You're okay. Just relax. You've got to relax.",
        "Paul: Emily -- is the baby okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: There's no need to be defensive here. You can use your trust fund in any way that you wish. I'm just trying to give you some advice. Your brother would give you the same advice. And so would your sister. You can ask any lottery winner. They're a target.",
        "Gwen: Jade's not targeting us -- she's a friend.",
        "Barbara: Really? For how long? You keep shelling out to her, and I promise you, you're going to begin to resent it. And then she'll start resenting you, too.",
        "Gwen: But that's the point. We're helping her get an apartment so she doesn't have to live with us anymore -- or with my sister.",
        "Barbara: Would you please tell me why her housing is your problem?",
        "Gwen: Because I know what it feels like not to have a place to live.",
        "Barbara: Jade has always had a place to live. First she was with the Snyders. Then, of course, yes, she did scramble for a couple of nights, but pretty soon she ended up at your sisters -- and now she's here?",
        "Will: What's your point, Mom?",
        "Barbara: My point is she has a talent to convince anyone to give her what she needs. Don't you see that? She didn't earn it.",
        "Will: What did I do to earn it?",
        "Barbara: Honey, you're part of a family.",
        "Will: Well, Jade doesn't have a family.",
        "Barbara: Okay, all right, let's just assume for a minute that her adoptive parents are beasts and they threw her out. But you tell me whose trust she has earned since she came to town. She came to Oakdale to deceive the Snyders.",
        "Will: Okay, that's enough about the Snyders.",
        "Barbara: My point is this -- she's very willing to lie to anyone to get what she wants. And if you keep shelling it out to her, she'll see you as an easy touch and she'll keep coming back for more.",
        "Will: No, she knows this is only a one-time thing.",
        "Barbara: Really? Does she?",
        "Will: I'm going to go tell her. I gotta go.",
        "Gwen: Bye.",
        "Barbara: You want to keep your husband, you better nip this relationship in the bud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You know what? I don't care what you think. You don't know Maddie at all. When I first met her, she was always joking. But you know what? It was only because she was afraid to let people see what was on the inside. She has the softest heart of anyone I've ever met. And a conscience, too. She could never commit murder. It's just not in her.",
        "Jade: And you hunted me down to tell me this because?",
        "Casey: Because you pointed the finger at her.",
        "Jade: I'm not the only one who thinks she's guilty. Ann does, too, and so does half of your class. For a really good reason.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's a theory with no evidence. The cops would have arrested her if they had anything concrete.",
        "Jade: Maybe. But your mom is pretty fond of her.",
        "Casey: Oh, so now this is a conspiracy. Maddie's a serial killer, but my mom likes her, so she's not gonna arrest her. Get a grip.",
        "Jade: You know what? Be my guest and hold Maddie's hand if you want to. But just do it in front of a lot of people in broad daylight.",
        "Casey: You know what? Just lay off, 'cause she didn't do anything.",
        "Jade: Are you trying to convince me or yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Now I know you and your sister love Maddie very much. And you would do just about anything to protect her -- including lie to the police about her whereabouts during the times of the murders. And believe me -- I can understand that. I have a family, too. And I would hate to know that they're involved in a crime. But kids are being killed.",
        "Henry: This has nothing to do with Maddie!",
        "Dallas: Look, you may be right. But if she's innocent, then we need to figure out what's troubling her. And why she seems like a suspect. Or else the killer just might decide she's next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Where's the other butcher knife? You need to talk to me. I know that you're involved. You need to tell me what happened. Where's the other knife?",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Maddie: I reached for it, but it fell.",
        "Margo: What fell?",
        "Maddie: The knife. I almost had it. And then he was on top of me and he --",
        "Margo: Nate?",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Margo: Nate was on top of you?",
        "Maddie: No. Of course not.",
        "Margo: Well, then I don't understand. Look, Honey, I know that this is really hard for you, but you have to tell me everything that you remember. You said you dropped the knife.",
        "Maddie: I never said that.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you did. You said you went to grab it, but you couldn't reach it because he was on top of you.",
        "Maddie: I don't know what you're talking about -- there was no knife! Just leave me alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Will: I think you and I need a little space.",
        "Margo: Until this investigation is concluded, stay away from Maddie.",
        "Casey: Sorry, Mom, I can't do that.",
        "Paul: Oh, ah!",
        "Emily: Isn't that amazing?",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, you seen Jade?",
        "Casey: She just left.",
        "Will: Well, did she say where she was going?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Will: You want to tell me what happened?",
        "Casey: Let's just say we had a conversation.",
        "Will: About what?",
        "Casey: What do you think? She's spreading rumors about Maddie.",
        "Will: Okay, about that -- I know she's sorry that she talked to the cops, but your mom really put her on the spot.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but she didn't need to make it sound like Maddie was guilty.",
        "Will: Well, she's worried, man. Two people have been killed.",
        "Casey: That's not Maddie's fault!",
        "Will: I'm not saying it is.",
        "Casey: Look, Jade's a proven liar. She'd do anything to hurt Maddie. What? Oh, you think that Maddie would stab Lia, then waltz over to the bridge, get rid of the bloody knife while someone was looking at her? Come on!",
        "Will: I hear you, okay? How're you doing?",
        "Casey: I'm just worried about her.",
        "Will: Yeah, we are, too. She hasn't been herself.",
        "Casey: Yeah and the last thing she needs is for people to be gossiping about her.",
        "Will: Well, she's lucky she has you.",
        "Casey: Tell her that.",
        "Will: I don't think she's gonna listen to us. But you gotta keep trying, because if she's in trouble and she needs all the support she can get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, you have got to tell me what happened.",
        "Maddie: Nothing happened.",
        "Margo: Yes it did. You told me you reached for the knife but then it fell. Is this the knife that killed Nate?",
        "Maddie: I didn't kill anybody. Don't you know me better than that?",
        "Margo: Honey, I know that you're -- you've been through something really terrible, and that the best people do the worst things when they're stressed.",
        "Maddie: I'm not stressed!",
        "Margo: Yes, you are.",
        "Maddie: You're the one that is stressing me out -- you and Officer Griffin!",
        "Margo: Officer Griffin simply reminded you of what happened in Chicago -- that you were attacked, that you were sexually assaulted. And ever since then, you have not been yourself. You're withdrawn and you're angry.",
        "Maddie: Because you forced me to talk about something that I didn't even want to think about! So, yes, I'm a little depressed and confused -- because I remember things. I go away for a minute and I see things, and then I come back, but -- it doesn't mean that I killed somebody. I liked Nate. He was a good person. Do you really think that I could hurt someone?",
        "Margo: It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter. You have to try and remember what happened that night. Maddie, I am helping you. Tell me what happened the night that Nate was killed.",

        "Henry: So you think Maddie's in danger?",
        "Eve: How dare you. What a terrible thing to say.",
        "Dallas: Look, two kids have been killed, okay? Maddie knew both. Now, if she had nothing to do with their deaths, she absolutely had something to do with their lives. Which means that Maddie, too, is also in jeopardy. Which is why it is critical for us to get to the truth.",
        "Henry: Okay, so you just want to help Maddie, right?",
        "Dallas: Of course I want to help Maddie.",
        "Henry: All right, that makes you the good cop, right? And Margo's the bad cop?",
        "Eve: So if he's the good cop, what's she saying to Maddie?",
        "Henry: I don't know, Eve, but she's been in there an awful long time. Don't you think?",
        "Eve: Yeah, too long.",
        "Dallas: Hey, wait!",
        "Eve: Is my sister under arrest?",
        "Dallas: I'm sorry, Detective.",
        "Margo: Maddie and I are still talking, Eve.",

        "Barbara: You're too smart a girl not to have thought of that yourself. I thought so.",
        "Gwen: Okay, it may have occurred to me that Jade was interested in him. But I talked to him about it and I asked him point blank if there was something that I should be worried about, and he said no, they're just friends. And I believe him.",
        "Barbara: And so do I. But I think you need to consider the possibility that Jade will try to do whatever she can to drive a wedge between the two of you. Especially now that she knows that he has money.",
        "Gwen: No, Will's not going to let that happen.",
        "Barbara: Will may not be able to see what she's doing. Gwen, I love my son deeply. But he's very vulnerable. And that's my fault. I leaned on him too much when he was little. My marriage was falling apart for all kinds of reasons, and I pushed him, I confided in him, I demanded that he go along with whatever I thought was best. And as a result, he's swayed easily. I never allowed him to grow up to have the right kind of instincts. I mean, look what happened with that term paper and the test. He allowed himself to be lead in the wrong direction. And then -- and then, when he thought that he had hurt us, he lied. And look what happened.",
        "Gwen: Well, he's going back to school.",
        "Barbara: Because of you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to my son. And I'm not trying to butter you up or interfere. I just -- I want him happy, that's all. And I honestly believe that my son will flourish if he stays married to you. Which is why you two have to stay together forever.",

        "Will: Jade!",
        "Jade: Hi. You got my message?",
        "Will: Yeah, I got your message. Why couldn't you meet me at Java?",
        "Jade: Oh -- Casey was there.",
        "Will: So we couldn't meet outside? You had to drag me all the way down here?",
        "Jade: What's wrong? Is it Gwen? Oh, did she feel like I'm pushing you too much about the money?",
        "Will: No, no, she's fine about the money.",
        "Jade: Okay. So what's wrong?",
        "Will: Nothing. Let's just do this.",
        "Jade: This is a fortune. This is more money than I've ever seen in my life.",
        "Will: Well, we wanted you to have enough to make a fresh start.",
        "Jade: I don't know what I would do without you, Will. You're the most generous man.",
        "Will: Well, you know, it is from both of us.",
        "Jade: Of course. Thank you.",
        "Will: So, I gotta get out of here.",
        "Jade: You can't wait and celebrate with me for a little bit?",
        "Will: Well, Gwen's waiting.",
        "Jade: Right, okay.",
        "Will: And now that you're getting your own place, I think we should cool it.",

        "Meg: Every time I try to back away, I end up facing the same essential truth. I love Paul and he loves me. But that doesn't mean I'm blind. I'm as worried about this situation with Emily as you are. Which is why I told him I wouldn't marry him until the baby was born and he sorted things out.",
        "Emma: That is the smartest thing you have ever done. I'm very proud of you.",
        "Meg: Well, I'm not a masochist, Mama. I don't want to be in the middle of all this. The problem is -- okay, he planned this picnic for us, and it was really sweet. It really, really was.",
        "Emma: I didn't say anything.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, you don't have to. The point is, the hospital called -- Emily had been admitted because of some problem with the baby. And Paul went rushing over there. And he asked me if I wanted to go with him, but I just didn't want to. Anyway, he's doing all the right things and --",
        "Emma: And it still doesn't feel right? Is that it?",
        "Meg: No, it doesn't. But I expected that. What I'm worried about is that I told him to be kind to Emily, you know? I mean, she is pregnant, and we are going to have to deal with her once the baby's born.",
        "Emma: And she is the baby's mother.",
        "Meg: Yes, she is. She's also Emily. And I'm afraid that she's going to use his kindness against us.",

        "Emily: I'm okay. How'd you hear?",

        "Paul: She's very concerned. She said I should come right away.",
        "Emily: So she's not here.",

        "Dr. Schiller: Well, the baby's signs are normal. We'll treat the preeclampsia, and if you can commit to taking it easy --",
        "Emily: I will. I promise. I will do whatever it takes.",
        "Dr. Schiller: It takes bed rest. And no stress.",

        "Dr. Schiller: I'll let you got home and we'll see how you do. But I want you in bed, or on the couch, or the chaise in the yard, understood?",

        "Paul: Can I?",
        "Emily: Yeah, sure you can. Come on, it's like the hospital said. I mean, there's a reason why they called you to be here. You're the dad.",

        "Emma: Meg, we both know that Emily will do anything to get what she wants. It doesn't matter who she hurts. Oh, Sweetheart. Forgive me, but I really do wish that you could just stay away from both them. That's what I wish.",
        "Meg: Do you really expect me to stay away from someone I love?",

        "Emma: Well, if you really, really want this man, and all his baggage, you just gotta get in there, I guess, and fight for him. That's all. But listen, you better make sure it's what you really want. Because there is a child involved here. You hear? So, you had better listen to your heart before you commit to this, otherwise you are going to make a very bad situation worse.",

        "Barbara: Okay, I'm glad to hear you say that. And I hope you're right. But you have to be on the lookout here. And you've got to set some boundaries. No more overnights, no more gifts of money. Jade has a job and a apartment. Let her take it from there.",
        "Gwen: Okay, you've got a point.",
        "Barbara: And no more time alone with your husband.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you are married now. And I realize that all of your friends are probably still living at home with their parents. But you have taken a giant step into the adult world, and the rules are different. Married people put each other first. And friends, especially friends of the opposite sex, come in a very distant second.",
        "Gwen: Okay, but the thing is, she's just not Will's friend. She's my friend. And we both wanted to give her that money.",
        "Barbara: But whose idea was it?",

        "Casey: So where's Maddie? Huh? Did you arrest her?",
        "Margo: No, I did not arrest her. She's not locked up.",
        "Casey: I know you dragged her in here because everyone at the Lakeview is talking about how she was almost tackled in the parking lot.",
        "Margo: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You were at the Lakeview?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: How many times do we have to have this conversation, Casey? Your father and I made it very clear. Stay away from her. Until this investigation in concluded, stay away from Maddie.",

        "Margo: You know what? Until an investigation is concluded and someone is under arrest --",
        "Casey: So she's guilty until proven innocent? I didn't think it worked like that, Mom.",

        "Gwen: Yeah, so do I. But the difference is, is that I believe in him. Will is the strongest person that I know, and most people didn't think he'd even make it out of that stupid psych ward, let alone get married and let alone make a life for himself. I mean, he's an amazing human being.",
        "Barbara: And you have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that you feel that. I'm just trying to warn you. This Jade is a very conniving young woman, so don't let her get too close.",

        "Jade: Well, that's how you make me feel -- like you're ashamed! And I get that this could mess things up between you and Gwen. That's why I never said anything. But what happened between you and me was special. I was there for you when you needed me. And I know it never went beyond that, but it meant something to me -- like we understood each other, and I thought I could count on you like a friend, like you counted on me. But you don't care about me. You don't care about me at all! I'm just some girl you had sex with. Well, you know what, the hell with you.",
