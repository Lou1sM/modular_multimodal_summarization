    "Recap": [
        "Lily is stunned to learn she was duped about the perfume factory and at first blames Craig. He shifts the blame onto Lucinda, but Lily can't believe her mom would do that to her. Luke would like Reid to accompany him to his dad's wedding, but Reid isn't very interested and would rather go home and go to bed. Furthermore, he isn't a big fan of showy displays of love. Luke is disappointed. Carly is worried about Molly's wedding going on as planned with Holden still in France. Holden calls Jack and promises he will be home in time. However, Holden is not pleased to find Craig with Lily and once he finds out about the scam with the phony perfume warehouse, he assumes Craig is behind it. Lily is stunned to find Holden coming after her, but she defends Craig. Lily finally agrees to head home with Holden so he won't miss his wedding. Molly, blissfully unaware of Holden's whereabouts, gets ready for her day with everyone's help. Jack is worried once he hears about the big storm closing down airports in the east and he goes to tell an agitated Carly. Molly overhears them talking and the jig is up; they have to tell her where Holden went, as Molly can't believe it. Faith is disappointed when Parker seems to be acting distant from her. Abigail and Luke talk about their parents and how complicated love is when Reid makes an appearance shocking Luke. Abigail thinks he is Noah but strangely, Reid takes it in stride. Holden and Lily hit turbulence and she ends up holding onto his hand. Holden hopes are dashed for making it home on time when the pilot announces they have to land in Montreal because of the weather. Faith and Parker come to an understanding. Molly isn't taking the news well that her wedding may be postponed because Holden took off to save Lily. Surprisingly, Reid is the one that gives Molly a backwards pick me up speech. Molly decides to have her wedding backwards while they wait for Holden. A furious Craig comes looking for Lucinda at her office. Her door is locked, but Craig is yelling and demanding Lucinda sees him right now or else. Holden is finally able to reach Jack to tell him where he is and that he is trying everything to get home on time. Jack explains that they told Molly, but he just advises he and Lily to get back safely. Carly won't tell Molly anything yet after Holden calls; it is her day and she doesn't want to ruin it with any news that Holden is still far away with Lily in tow. From a ways away, Molly watches Jack and Carly talk about this issue and seems to know something is up."

        "Reid: Mm. Seven hours.",
        "Luke: Wow. Marathon. Everything go okay?",
        "Reid: Of course.",
        "Luke: You look beat.",
        "Reid: Nothing 16 hours of uninterrupted sleep won't cure.",
        "Luke: Well, how about a hot shower and a change of clothes?",
        "Reid: I think I'm gonna go for the sleep, unless the shower is an open invitation.",
        "Luke: You forgot.",
        "Reid: Forgot what?",
        "Luke: My dad is getting married to Molly today.",
        "Reid: Oh, yeah, right. That.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and I feel that I need to go there and support my father.",
        "Reid: Of course you do. I applaud you for that.",
        "Luke: Oh, good. So you're coming?",
        "Reid: No.",
        "Luke: Reid --",
        "Reid: I don't need to tag along with you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I want you to come.",
        "Reid: Well, I'm sorry, Luke. Count me out. I'm not gonna be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Buddy.",
        "Carly: Hey. So, where's Holden? Please tell me he's at the Lakeview and he's getting ready.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, this is unbelievable. My cousin is supposed to be getting married in a few hours, and you let the groom run off to France to bring home his ex-wife.",
        "Jack: Please. He'll get here when he gets here, Carly.",
        "Carly: How can you be so calm about this?",
        "Jack: What do you want me to do, Honey?",
        "Carly: You shouldn't let him go in the first place.",
        "Jack: What was I supposed to do, arrest him?",
        "Carly: Yes. If it would have kept him here, yeah.",
        "Jack: He was determined to go. And that should tell you something.",
        "Carly: What does that mean?",
        "Jack: If he's so quick to fly off to France to rescue Lily the night before he's supposed to marry your cousin --",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Don't say it. I don't want to hear it.",
        "Jack: Carly, then maybe he's not ready to go through with this wedding after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Molly!",
        "Ethan: Molly, wake up! It's your wedding day!",
        "Molly: [Laughs] What is this? Nice wake-up surprise. Thank you.",
        "Faith: Natalie, Ethan, let Molly sleep. Today is her big day. She gets to sleep as long as she wants.",
        "Molly: No, its okay, Faith. I was already awake. And besides, it's not just my big day. It's your big day, too. Thank you. Thank you, Natalie. I'm so happy you came home from camp for this.",
        "Ethan: Dad said she had to.",
        "Natalie: But I wanted to, too.",
        "Molly: I know you did. Mwah.",
        "Natalie: Where is Dad?",
        "Molly: He's at the hotel, getting ready. We're not gonna see him till later. It's a tradition that the bride and the groom stay apart the night before the wedding.",
        "Ethan: Is Mom gonna be there, too?",
        "Molly: Oh, Sweetie, I don't think so. That's okay.",
        "Faith: Today is about Dad and Molly. But Mom and Dad are still friends, so it's cool.",
        "Molly: Right. And your mom and dad will always be your parents, and they will always love you. It's -- I'm marrying your dad, but it's not to take your mom's place. I just love you so much, too. And just so you know, I will always be here for you no matter what, no matter when you need me. I just hope that I can make your dad really happy.",
        "Abigail: You will. Glad you're up.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Faith: Come on, Guys. Give Molly a chance to get dressed.",
        "Molly: Thank you, Faith.",
        "Faith: See you later.",
        "Natalie: Bye, Molly.",
        "Molly: Bye.",
        "Abigail: So, how are you feeling?",
        "Molly: Are you kidding me? Oh, I'm on top of the world. Today is gonna be the best day ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't have time for this, Jack. I've got a million things to do before the wedding. You just better hope that Holden makes it back in time.",
        "Jack: And if he doesn't?",
        "Carly: Stop it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: That's him now. Hey. What's going on?",
        "Holden: Hey. I just landed in Marseilles right on schedule.",
        "Jack: Great. [Whispering] He's there.",
        "Holden: I'm gonna head over to the perfume factory, grab Lily, and turn right around. I should have plenty of time to make it back for the wedding.",
        "Jack: You better. Otherwise, there's gonna be hell to pay.",
        "Holden: Jack, listen. Thanks for covering for me.",
        "Jack: Don't thank me. Just get back here in time for your own damn wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: We've been over this entire neighborhood.",
        "Lily: Yeah. And nobody knows anything about a perfume factory. And this patisserie has been here for years.",
        "Craig: This doesn't make any sense, Lily.",
        "Lily: We've been set up. We have been paying to renovate a factory that doesn't exist.",
        "Craig: No. We've been scammed! And I'll give you three guesses who's behind it.",
        "Lily: Who?",
        "Craig: It starts with the initials \"Lucinda Walsh.\"",
        "Lily: No. My mother couldn't possibly do this.",
        "Craig: Who else do we know that underhanded?",
        "Lily: You.",
        "Craig: Me?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Craig: What do you mean, me?",
        "Lily: This is way more your speed, Craig.",
        "Craig: Why would I cheat myself?",
        "Lily: Everybody warned me against having anything to do with you -- Holden, Carly, my mother -- but I wouldn't listen. I gave you a chance. I trusted you.",
        "Craig: And I gave you a couple million reasons why you should. You want to point fingers, point them at mommy dear.",
        "Lily: No. My mother wouldn't do that to me.",
        "Craig: I don't think it has anything to do with you. I think she wants to get back at me.",
        "Lily: Craig, she doesn't even know we're in business. You're the silent partner, remember?",
        "Craig: Lucinda has ways of finding out information that other people can't!",
        "Lily: Mother wouldn't hurt me like that.",
        "Craig: In her twisted mind, she'd probably think she's helping you.",
        "Lily: I can't believe that.",
        "Craig: Look what matters is that we've both been scammed. I'm out a ton of money, and you're out a perfume business. We have to find a way to turn this around.",
        "Lily: I can't believe this is all a lie. We're sunk.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna work something out, I promise you.",
        "Holden: Hey. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Lily: Holden, what are you doing here?",
        "Holden: I came because I thought you need my help. What's your excuse?",
        "Craig: I'm here as Lily's friend.",
        "Holden: Is that true?",
        "Lily: Who told you I was in trouble?",
        "Holden: You know what? We can discuss all the details on the flight back.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. You're supposed to be married in a few hours.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that. So there's not a lot of time, okay?",
        "Craig: Lily, we have to get to the bottom of this, and we can't do it at 30,000 feet.",
        "Lily: Yeah, Craig is right. I need to stay here to find out what happened.",
        "Craig: Yeah. We've had a little bit of a setback.",
        "Holden: \"We\"?",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Holden: What kind of setback?",
        "Lily: Apparently, the factory I bought doesn't exist.",
        "Holden: Oh, well, I'll tell you what happened. Craig here -- he cheated you out of a small fortune.",
        "Lily: No. That isn't true.",
        "Holden: Yes, it is. He set up the whole thing. He orchestrated the entire scam.",
        "Craig: Holden, you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Holden: Come on, Craig. Don't deny it. You tricked Lily into investing into a factory that never even existed, and you are not going to get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay, well, it sounds like everything's gonna work out and Holden is gonna make it back in time for the wedding, which is a huge relief.",
        "Jack: I guess.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. Please don't tell me you're still falling for this \"Holden and Molly belong together\" myth. It's ridiculous.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] What did you just say? Don't you mean \"Holden and Lily\"?",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course.",
        "Jack: You said \"Holden and Molly.\"",
        "Carly: I did?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you did.",
        "Carly: Well, it was a mistake.",
        "Jack: You sure about that?",
        "Carly: Yeah. It was a slip of the tongue. I'm sure about it.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: And, you know, we wouldn't even be having this conversation if you didn't encourage Holden to fly halfway around the world to help Lily out of a situation that she probably could have handled all on her own.",
        "Jack: Well, clearly he didn't think that she could handle this on her own, and I didn't encourage him any more than I tried to stop him, thank you very much. Hey there, guy. You look sharp.",
        "Parker: Thanks. Everything okay?",
        "Jack: Everything is peachy-keen.",
        "Parker: Really? Because it didn't really sound that way.",
        "Carly: It's fine. I just have a lot to do, and I'm falling behind, and everybody should catch up. Otherwise, this whole wedding could turn into a disaster.",
        "Parker: Really, why would it turn into a disaster?",
        "Carly: Never mind.",
        "Parker: You guys are lousy liars, okay?",
        "Jack: Hey, nobody's lying. We just hit a bit of a snag.",
        "Parker: What kind of a snag?",
        "Carly: Nothing. Your father's exaggerating. Get the dress, please, and bring it to the car. You -- you better hope that overseas delivery gets here in time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: You know, weddings just really aren't my kind of thing.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. Who doesn't like weddings? Why not?",
        "Reid: I think they are foolish spectacles dedicated to the archaic notion of making vows and promises you probably can't keep.",
        "Luke: Ah. So this is your ever so clever way of saying that you think that love doesn't last.",
        "Reid: Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. You know that. I'm just saying that you don't need a lot of phony pomp and circumstance to seal the deal.",
        "Luke: You know, it's a really good thing that you're a brain surgeon and not a marriage counselor.",
        "Reid: My advice would save a lot of people a lot of headaches.",
        "Luke: So you're saying that you don't believe in love?",
        "Reid: I'm saying I don't believe in ceremonies. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, not all the vows and pretty poetry in the world can change that.",
        "Luke: You know, Dr. Oliver, you are a real killer romantic.",
        "Reid: Love should be pragmatic. That's all.",
        "Luke: You know, I think that you're just trying to rile me up. But guess what? I'm not biting. And this isn't just about the wedding. You know, this would be our first time out together, you know, as a couple.",
        "Reid: Look, if you want to be seen as a couple, I will take you out for a nice dinner. We can sit right in the center of the restaurant, where everybody will see us holding hands.",
        "Luke: Reid, don't be a jerk. Come on. I'm just asking for you to come with me for a couple hours and watch my father and Molly do something that will make them very, very happy.",
        "Reid: And I'm just telling you that I really don't want to go.",
        "Luke: So you wouldn't make the sacrifice, not even for me? And besides, you know, I think it'd be very good for you.",
        "Reid: How do you figure that?",
        "Luke: It will give you a chance to work on your people skills, Mr. Soon to be chief of staff.",
        "Reid: My people skills are fine.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, with people under anesthesia, they're fantastic. But people who are walking and talking -- no, no, not so much.",
        "Reid: Fine. I will work on my people skills. But not at the wedding. If I don't get some sleep, my doctor skills are gonna need a lot of work. So I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Holden, why would I cheat Lily?",
        "Holden: Because it's what you do, Craig. Your victims -- they can attest to that.",
        "Craig: Well, you're wrong this time. There's nothing nefarious going on here. I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to be her friend.",
        "Holden: Is that true?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: Well, then, how did he even know to come?",
        "Lily: It's none of your business. He's my friend. I don't need to explain myself to you.",
        "Holden: A friend with an agenda, I'm sure.",
        "Lily: Well, if his agenda is to help me, I welcome it.",
        "Holden: So what are you saying, that you don't want my help?",
        "Lily: I don't even know what you're doing here, Holden. You're supposed to be getting married.",
        "Holden: Lily, I came because I thought that you were in trouble.",
        "Lily: I appreciate that, but I'm fine. I don't need your help.",
        "Holden: Okay. So, did you get any information? Do you know where this factory might be?",
        "Lily: Nobody seems to know anything, except there isn't a perfume factory and there never was one.",
        "Holden: Okay, so there's nothing to do here. So why don't we just leave and try and catch the flight back?",
        "Craig: Lily can fly home later with me, once we finish what we came here to do. Go home. Go get married, Holden. You're not needed here.",
        "Lily: Craig, can -- can I speak to you for a second?",
        "Craig: Sure.",
        "Lily: Excuse us. Look, why don't you stick around and do some further digging? Maybe you can get to the bottom of this.",
        "Craig: Because the two of us can get more accomplished. That's why.",
        "Lily: Clearly Holden is not gonna leave without me.",
        "Craig: Okay, fine. I'll stay. You go.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Just tell me something. You don't really think I'm behind this, do you?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Craig: Good.",
        "Holden: Lily, we, uh, need to hurry.",
        "Craig: Listen, you call me the second you land, okay? Okay. Holden.",
        "Holden: What are you doing with this guy? Have you lost your mind?",
        "Lily: I can ask you the same question, flying all the way here when you're about to be married. Holden, why on earth did you come after me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello! You can breathe now, Cuz. The dress is here.",
        "Molly: Whoo-hoo! Oh, take it upstairs quick. I don't want anybody to see it.",
        "Carly: All right. Parker, would you bring this upstairs?",
        "Parker: Yes. Sure.",
        "Faith: Need help?",
        "Parker: Thanks, but, uh, I think we got it covered.",
        "Molly: Faith, do you want to take Ethan and Natalie to go pick some fresh flowers for the ceremony?",
        "Faith: Sure. Come on, Guys. Let's go do something useful.",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Carly: So, how do you feel?",
        "Molly: Uh, cool as a cucumber.",
        "Carly: Yeah, right.",
        "Molly: No, you didn't let me finish. Cool as a cucumber that's been left out in the sun for a week.",
        "Carly: Oh, now, that I believe. So, do you have all the essentials -- old, new, borrowed, blue?",
        "Molly: Okay, uh, new -- the gorgeous wedding dress you made me.",
        "Carly: Hmm.",
        "Molly: Blue -- oh, you've got to see these sapphire earrings that Emma gave me.",
        "Carly: [Gasps] Oh, they're beautiful. Yeah. Where is Emma?",
        "Molly: Oh. She -- she didn't feel comfortable leaving Meg. I guess Meg's having a hard time adjusting to the new hospital.",
        "Carly: Yeah. That's too bad.",
        "Molly: I know.",
        "Carly: So, uh, borrowed?",
        "Molly: A hair clip from Faith.",
        "Carly: Perfect. Old?",
        "Molly: Uh, that one's a blank. Do you have any suggestions?",
        "Carly: Yes, I do, as a matter of fact. Here you are.",
        "Molly: Is this what I think it is?",
        "Carly: Hmm? The feather from my wedding to Jack in Montana.",
        "Molly: Honey, you kept this all these years?",
        "Carly: Of course.",
        "Molly: I can't take this.",
        "Carly: Yes, you can. I want you to. It will bring you luck. [Laughs] Oh, you're shaking. Why are you shaking?",
        "Molly: Because I'm a nervous wreck.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Molly: Has Jack talked to Holden this morning? How is he?",
        "Carly: I'm sure he's scrambling.",
        "Molly: Wonder if he got, uh -- got as little sleep as I did last night.",
        "Carly: I think you can pretty much bet on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Your mother -- she was worried, and -- and she called me. It's as simple as that.",
        "Lily: How did my mother even know I was coming to Marseilles?",
        "Holden: You know how she likes to keep tabs on you, how she hates not knowing what's going on.",
        "Lily: What made her think I was headed for trouble?",
        "Holden: That I don't know. But she was right, Lily. You have been scammed, and Craig is responsible for this entire thing.",
        "Lily: Trust me, he isn't.",
        "Holden: How can you be sure?",
        "Lily: Because I am.",
        "Holden: Lily, what are you doing with him anyway? Craig Montgomery is bad news.",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm sorry to burst your hero complex, but I am not the naive little girl that you think I am, and Craig isn't the big, bad wolf.",
        "Holden: Yes, he is.",
        "Lily: Even if he is, these are my mistakes to make, okay? I don't -- I don't need you flying all the way over here to point them out to me. Boy, did I make a big one this time.",
        "Holden: There's no way you could have known what you were getting involved in.",
        "Lily: Regardless, this is my mess to clean up. You have other things to focus on. You're supposed to be getting married. Look, I don't want to be responsible for you being late to your wedding, so let's hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Hey, Jack. I thought you took the day off for your cousin's wedding.",
        "Jack: I -- I did. I'm just catching up on some e-mails, and I guess I got to check one more thing, and then I'm out of here. Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Okay, it's all set.",
        "Abigail: Oh, the dress is gorgeous, Carly.",
        "Carly: I know. I worked so hard on it. It's gonna be flawless, just like today.",
        "Molly: [Sighs] Oh, we should get the kids back. We have a ton of stuff to do before the wedding.",
        "Carly: Right. Parker, would you find Faith and -- and the kids and tell them to hurry up with those flowers?",
        "Parker: Sure. What's up, what's up?",
        "Luke: Abigail! Hey!",
        "Abigail: Ah! Hey, little brother.",
        "Luke: How are you? How is L.A. life?",
        "Abigail: It's sunny.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I can tell.",
        "[Abigail laughs]",
        "Luke: Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Luke: Molly, how do you feel?",
        "Molly: Take a guess.",
        "Luke: [Laughs] So, where's Dad?",
        "Molly: [Sighs] We're doing that old-fashioned thing.",
        "Luke: Oh, you're staying apart? How very 20th century.",
        "Abigail: Eh, don't make fun. It's romantic.",
        "Carly: Hopelessly romantic. Come on. Let's go try on that dress.",
        "Abigail: Hey, uh, want some coffee?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Abigail: So, uh, this must be kind of weird for you, huh?",
        "Luke: It is what it is.",
        "Abigail: Is that it?",
        "Luke: Well, you know, it is kind of odd to see my dad marrying somebody else. I always sort of thought that my mom and dad would end up together. That might be kind of childish, though.",
        "Abigail: Oh, I never thought that my dad would end up with my mom, but, I mean, here we are. They're planning on getting married today.",
        "Luke: It's a funny life.",
        "Abigail: Yeah, funny and crazy and everything in between.",
        "Luke: But, you know, as long as Dad's happy, I'm happy.",
        "Abigail: Really? I mean, you kind of don't look happy. You kind of seem upset.",
        "Luke: Well, that has nothing to do with the wedding.",
        "Jack: Hello. Luke! Abigail, you look fan -- how are you?",
        "Abigail: Hey. Good.",
        "Jack: Ah. Where's Carly? I -- I need to talk to her right away?",
        "Molly: Oh, it fits like a dream. It's perfect. Thank you, thank you. It's so beautiful.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Molly: Uh, who is it?",
        "Jack: Jack. Is -- is Carly in there?",
        "Molly: Of course she is.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Molly: Come on in.",
        "Jack: Are you -- are you sure you're decent? Fantastic. Hey. Hi.",
        "Molly: I'm gonna jump in the shower.",
        "Jack: Well, happy -- happy, uh, wedding day.",
        "Molly: Thank you.",
        "Carly: So, have you talked to Holden?",
        "Jack: No. But I have other bad news.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: I checked the weather online. There's a huge storm brewing over the Atlantic.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, this can't be happening.",
        "Jack: Flights are being delayed or canceled all over the place.",
        "Carly: [Groans] Well, maybe Holden got out in time.",
        "Molly: Got out in time? What do canceled flights and storms over the Atlantic Ocean have to do with Holden?",
        "Jack: We got to tell her.",
        "Molly: Tell me what? What's going on? Where's Holden?",
        "Carly: Hopefully, he's on a plane, headed back.",
        "Molly: Headed back? From where?",
        "Carly: France.",
        "Jack: Marseilles.",
        "Molly: Is this some kind of pre-wedding humor? Because Holden is at the Lakeview. He's not in France. Not funny, Guys. Not funny at all.",
        "Carly: Hey, Molly, look at me, okay? This is not a joke. I didn't want to tell you, but with the storm, there's not much of a choice.",
        "Molly: So if you're being honest with me, then tell me why the hell Holden would go to Marseilles on the day of his wedding?",
        "Jack: He went yesterday, last -- last night. His plan was to be back in time for the wedding.",
        "Molly: He didn't say anything to me about it. Why did he go?",
        "Carly: You tell her. You're the one who let him leave.",
        "Jack: I didn't let him le -- he went after -- he went after Lily.",
        "Molly: Lily.",
        "Jack: Apparently, she's in some kind of trouble over there.",
        "Molly: What kind of trouble?",
        "Jack: I -- I didn't get the details.",
        "Carly: It must be very serious or he wouldn't have considered going.",
        "Molly: Yeah, but he did, on the night before our wedding. So now there probably isn't even gonna be one, because there's a storm over the Atlantic Ocean!",
        "Jack: He could still make it if he got out in time.",
        "Carly: I am so sorry, Honey.",
        "Molly: You knew about this all morning? Why didn't you say anything to me?",
        "Carly: Well, I was hoping that you didn't have to know.",
        "Jack: Please, please, don't be -- don't be angry at Carly. She wanted to tell you. I convinced her to give Holden a chance to get back in time.",
        "Carly: We just didn't want you to be upset on the day of your wedding.",
        "Both: Look what we brought!",
        "Jack: Oh. Hey, Guys, you know what? Molly will be out in two seconds, okay?",
        "Natalie: What's wrong?",
        "Molly: Nothing's wrong. You guys have perfect timing. Let me see this bouquet. Oh. [Sniffs] These are beautiful. It is gonna be a wonderful wedding.",

        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: I just -- I still don't understand why you would turn to Craig for help.",
        "Lily: He's my friend.",
        "Holden: He's not anybody's friend. And I still think he's the one behind this whole perfume-factory fiasco.",
        "Lily: Why would you possibly think that? Why would he do something like that to me?",
        "Holden: To make you turn to him, just like you have.",
        "Lily: [Groans] That's ridiculous. All right, enough, okay? Stop worrying about me and focus on your own life. We're barely gonna get back to Oakdale in time for your wedding.",
        "Holden: I still think there's something going on, something that you're not telling me.",
        "Lily: All right, for the last time, drop it, okay? You know everything you need to know.",

        "Abigail: Oh, Mom must be freaking out.",
        "Luke: Well, you know what? If he made it out before the storm, he'll be here.",
        "Abigail: Yeah.",
        "Luke: I wonder if my mom's gonna be with him.",
        "Abigail: You know, why would he even go out there? What kind of trouble is your mom in?",
        "Luke: I don't know. All I know is that she and Carly started some fragrance company, and the factory's based in Marseilles.",
        "Abigail: Well, it must be really serious for Dad to fly all the way out to France the night before his wedding.",
        "Luke: Let me try and call him. Straight to voicemail.",
        "Abigail: [Sighs] Uh, well, that could mean he's already on the plane.",
        "Luke: No. It says that because of that storm in the Atlantic, all westbound flights out of Europe are delayed or canceled.",
        "[Abigail sighs]",
        "Luke: Try not to be too pessimistic.",
        "Abigail: No, it's -- it's not that. It's just I can't believe that he would take this kind of a chance. I mean, I can't believe he'd risk not getting back in time.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm sure he thought he would.",
        "Abigail: Yeah, but he still took the risk. I mean, he went to be with Lily.",
        "Luke: But -- but we don't know why. I'm sure there's a good explanation.",
        "Abigail: Well, what a mess. I mean, is it me, or does love just seem way too complicated to deal with sometimes?",
        "Luke: No, no, it is not just you. Love is way too complicated to deal with sometimes.",
        "Abigail: Yeah.",
        "Reid: Am I too early or too late?",
        "Luke: What are you doing here?",
        "Reid: You invited me, remember? Something, uh, about a wedding. I expected it to be low-key, but where is everybody?",
        "Abigail: Hi, I'm Abigail. You must be Noah.",
        "Reid: [Laughs] No. I'm Dr. Reid Oliver.",
        "Abigail: Oh.",
        "Luke: Uh, yeah. There's been, um, some changes in my life.",
        "Abigail: Apparently. Uh, I just let a big, fat elephant in the room, didn't I?",
        "Reid: It's to be expected.",
        "Abigail: So you two are --",
        "Luke: Uh, well, we're -- you like to tell her, or should I?",
        "Reid: Don't make it so complicated. Luke and I are together.",

        "Holden: It's just a little turbulence. No big deal.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You're right. Besides, we can't crash. Molly would never forgive me.",
        "Holden: That's a good point. Listen, we've been through worse -- a lot worse. This is no big deal.",
        "Lily: That's the understatement of the year.",

        "Holden: We've been through, uh, a lot. We've always managed to come through to the other side, just like -- just like you're going to do.",
        "Lily: Are you talking about the storm?",
        "Holden: Well, yeah, but I'm always talking about this whole other mess.",
        "Lily: My business, or lack thereof you mean. How could I be so foolish?",
        "Holden: You weren't. Somebody scammed you, somebody who knew exactly what they were doing. And we just need to figure out who's behind it all.",
        "Lily: No, I need to figure it out. This is my problem, not yours.",
        "Holden: I want to help out.",
        "Lily: Carly and I will deal with this. We'll fix it. You need to move forward with your own life.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine, if -- if that's what you want.",
        "Lily: It is.",
        "Holden: I'll just -- I'll stay out of it. Besides, you're very capable. You can handle this. You're very smart. You can turn it around.",

        "Carly: There's still plenty of time, Molly. And, you know, weather reports -- they're usually wrong or grossly exaggerated.",
        "Molly: I really appreciate you guys trying to cheer me up. But the only thing I really want to hear is Holden telling me that he's home. I'm gonna take a walk.",
        "Carly: Hey -- would you like some company?",
        "Molly: No thanks. I really would rather be alone.",
        "Carly: Oh, what is wrong with Holden? How could he be so stupid, so inconsiderate?",
        "Jack: He did what he felt he had to do.",
        "Carly: Yeah, for Lily. What about for Molly, the woman he's marrying? What, Jack? You're not gonna tell me what's on your mind?",
        "Jack: I'm as unhappy about this as you are. That's what's on my mind.",
        "Carly: Oh, really? 'Cause you don't even think Holden and Molly should be getting married at all. You made that perfectly clear.",
        "Jack: What? Don't twist my words! I said that he may not be ready.",
        "Carly: He is ready. He and Molly love each other. And the fact that he still worries about Lily doesn't change that.",
        "Jack: Look, I'm not gonna speak for Holden. He had his reasons for doing what he did. I don't know what those reasons are.",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Molly and Holden belong together. If you don't agree with me, I don't want to hear it.",

        "Both: It's complicated.",
        "Reid: Of course it is. See? I told you.",
        "Abigail: Told him what?",
        "Luke: Well, Reid thinks that weddings are pointless because nobody really knows what they want.",
        "Reid: He's paraphrasing, badly, but there is a reason that I try to skip family gatherings.",
        "Luke: You came to this one.",
        "Reid: Mitigating circumstances.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Abigail: Oh, Mom! Jack told us what's going on. Are you okay?",
        "Molly: I'm fine. What's a wedding without a mishap or two, right? It's not gonna be a boring day. That much I know.",
        "Abigail: So, what happens now?",
        "Molly: We wait for Holden. I'm not jumping to any conclusions until I talk to him. Dr. Oliver, what are you doing here?",
