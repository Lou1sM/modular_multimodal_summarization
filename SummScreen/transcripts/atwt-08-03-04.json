        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Tom: Hi. Casey up?",
        "Margo: I yelled at him, but, you know, it's summer, and he doesn't go to bed until after midnight. So I don't know if his eyes are open.",
        "Tom: Yeah, yeah. I know. because unlike you, sometimes I think of him before I do something that might upset him. I'm gonna pack a few things.",
        "Margo: You know, I already packed a bag for you, because I didn't want you packing when Casey's here.",
        "Tom: Thanks.",
        "Margo: Tom, do we have to do this? I mean, do we have to tell our kid that we're splitting up? I mean, I know that I hurt you. I know that you're angry, but isn't there something else we could do? Can't we do some counseling, or therapy, or -- I've been up all night.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I haven't slept for awhile.",
        "Margo: Well, why don't we just tell Casey that -- um, \"Case, we're human. We made mistakes. I made mistakes,\" and that -- \"but we're trying to work through it.\" Won't you at least think about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I know it sounds crazy, but I've done those kinds of promos before, and they are huge, huge ratings boosters.",
        "Kim: I'm sure they are. I'm sure. Doc, do you want anything more? Do you want some coffee or something?",
        "Doc: I don't think I could squeeze in another morsel. Plus, got footage to be done by 6: Don't let it get around, but the boss lady at WOAK? Real, real sharp eye.",
        "Kim: Oh, you know, I have heard that.",
        "Doc: Mm-hmm. An absolute taskmaster.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, but not all the time. So, you know, actually, you can forget about the footage for the 6:00 o'clock news.",
        "Doc: Kim, I was just kidding. I need --",
        "Kim: It's already been taken care of.",
        "Doc: I was just kidding. Kim --",
        "Kim: By your replacement.",
        "Doc: By my what?",
        "Kim: You've just had your last expense account meal on WOAK. And, for that matter, any other station in the tri-state area. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: I thought I heard a car.",
        "Alan: Don't worry. Lucy will be here soon.",
        "Sierra: Well, I hope you're ready for a war, because she's gonna fight me about going to Montega tonight.",
        "Alan: Well, maybe not.",
        "Sierra: I've seen that look on her face before. I've seen it in the mirror.",
        "Alan: Hey, then we'll both know how to handle it. Yes sir, she'll be safe. And then, after a while, you know, back in her old house with her old friends, she'll remember who she was before all this insanity started.",
        "Sierra: What would I do without you?",
        "Lucy: Mom?",
        "Sierra: Lucy, I'm glad you're back.",
        "Lucy: Who sent the cops on me?",
        "Sierra: I just wanted to make sure that you got home safely.",
        "Lucy: If you wanted me safe, you should've left me alone. I was safe in Reno with Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Flight attendant: Sir, are you all right?",
        "Dusty: Water.",
        "Flight attendant: Sure. Sure, I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Craig: Lily?",
        "Lily: Come on, we have to go to my mother's. Right now. Lucy's on her way back.",
        "Craig: How do you know?",
        "Lily: I know, because Sierra called. But they're gonna be back any minute, and then they're all going to Montega on a plane.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: Yes. It's pretty sudden, don't you think?",
        "Craig: That doesn't sound like Sierra.",
        "Lily: No, it's not Sierra. It's Alan. I'm sure of it. Come on, we got to stop them. Let's go.",
        "Craig: Wait. You think --",
        "Lily: He's dangerous. I think he's dangerous, to Lucy and to Sierra. We've got to stop them from leaving the country.",
        "Wade: Just know -- if they get me, I'm bringing you down with me.",
        "Craig: Now hold on, let me think. If Lucy leaves the country -- you know, Lily, it may be okay.",
        "Lily: Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Now, see, I'm just trying to think of what's best for Lucy. And right now, that's probably with her mother in Montega, with better security than we can offer here.",
        "Lily: Not if Alan is behind the kidnapping.",
        "Craig: But, you know, there's no proof that --",
        "Lily: Yes, there is proof.",
        "Craig: There is?",
        "Lily: Yes, because I searched my mother's guest house.",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Lily: It's my family's home, and I took matters into my own hands. And you will not believe what I found, Craig.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: Lucy's trust fund papers in his luggage.",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Craig: Lucy's trust fund statements. Oh. You're kidding.",
        "Lily: He wants to know how much money Lucy is worth. That is the explanation.",
        "Craig: Well, we don't know that for sure.",
        "Lily: I know enough that I don't want Alan taking my niece out of the country. Okay, if you're not going to stop them, then I will.",
        "Craig: No. Lily!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dusty dreaming]",
        "Dusty: Hello? Why didn't anybody tell me we landed? Lucy? Lucy, where are you? You made it back. You're okay?",
        "Lucy: You pushed me away.",
        "Dusty: I know. I didn't mean to. I thought it was -- I thought wrong. That's why I chased you back here.",
        "Lucy: Too late.",
        "Dusty: I got the first plane out, and then I fell asleep. Nobody woke me up.",
        "Lucy: You're too late.",
        "Dusty: Don't say that. Lucy, I love you. I love you. I'm sorry I let you go. I won't let go again. I promise. I promise you that. I promise. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? No, no, no! Lucy, say something. Say something!",
        "Wade: It's too late. You lose.",
        "Dusty: Lucy. Luce?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Flight attendant #1: Sir, are you in pain? You don't look well.",
        "Dusty: It's okay.",
        "Flight attendant #1: We can radio ahead and have an ambulance at the --",
        "Dusty: No, no. Please no ambulance, no doctor. I just got to see her. I got to talk --",
        "Flight attendant #1: Well, you won't be much good to this Lucy if you're not taking care of yourself.",
        "Dusty: It's fine. I'm fine. I'm much better now. I just need some aspirin, some more water. Water --",
        "Flight attendant #1: Sure. And this is soaked. Let me get you another one.",
        "Dusty: No, this is fine. Don't bother. It's okay. It's -- thank you.",
        "Flight attendant #1: I just wish there was something more I could do.",
        "Dusty: I'm fine. I'm fine. I just got to get to Oakdale.",
        "Flight attendant #1: It's less than an hour.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Flight attendant #2: That's him?",
        "Flight attendant #1: Yes. And I don't care what he says, something's very wrong. Tell the captain to radio ahead. I want the police there when we land.",
        "Flight attendant #2: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You think I'm going to montega tonight? There's no way.",
        "Nikki: Okay. Well, now that you're home safe, I think I'm gonna take off.",
        "Sierra: Thank you so much.",
        "Lucy: Is there any way you could find out if Dusty's okay?",
        "Nikki: I'll call Reno and see if I can track him. Okay?",
        "Lucy: Thanks. Call me. I'll be here.",
        "Sierra: You know, Lucy, you could hate me as much as you want, but this is about your safety.",
        "Lucy: Dusty would've kept me safe, if you'd just let him.",
        "Sierra: Lucy, the man could barely stand up.",
        "Lucy: He would've been fine.",
        "Sierra: Then why did you come home alone?",
        "Lucy: Because you got to him.",
        "Sierra: He promised that he would bring you home himself.",
        "Lucy: Oh, so that was the deal?",
        "Sierra: There was no deal. He agreed that you would be safer with me.",
        "Lucy: And the fact that you completely humiliated me means nothing? This is my life, Mom -- mine. And I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Alan: Lucy, this isn't permanent. It's a trip. You know, just a month to hang out, rest by the pool. And then you're off to college.",
        "Lucy: Alan, I know you mean well, but you're not my father.",
        "Lily: No, he's not.",
        "Craig: I am! Lullaby. Lullaby. Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Sierra: Lily, I expressly asked you not to --",
        "Lily: Craig is Lucy's father. He has the right to know that you're trying to take her away.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it doesn't even matter, because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Sierra: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: No, Mom, I'm done talking about this. I just want to take a shower and a nap, and clear my head.",
        "Sierra: That's a good idea. Why don't we table this conversation for a couple hours?",
        "Lucy: We can table the conversation as long as you like, because I'm not going.",
        "Lily: Seems like you have a fight on your hands.",
        "Alan: Well, her mother's pretty stubborn, too. One way or another, we'll get her on that plane.",
        "Lily: Why are you so hell-bent on getting her on that --",
        "Craig: Lily -- Lily, can I have a minute with old Alan here?",
        "Lily: Sure.",
        "Craig: Lily's upset.",
        "Alan: Yeah, so am I. I found her going through my things last night. She made up some excuse, but it's obvious she doesn't trust me.",
        "Craig: Well, look, I know how tough it is to be the new guy with the Walsh women.",
        "Alan: So why does it sound like now you're on my side?",
        "Craig: I'm on Lucy's side. As long as there's kidnappers out there, I think Montega is the best place for her.",
        "Alan: Are you serious?",
        "Craig: I want you and Sierra to take her to Montega, and don't let her out of your sight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bernie: How was everything?",
        "Kim: Oh, great. Thanks, Bernie. It's the best breakfast I've had in months.",
        "Bernie: Is this who I think it is?",
        "Kim: Yes. Doc Reese, Bernie Mortiz. Bernie is the manager here at the club.",
        "Bernie: It's an honor.",
        "Doc: Thank you.",
        "Bernie: Always been a big fan.",
        "Doc: Well, thanks. I tell you what, it wouldn't be a game without you guys.",
        "Kim: Bernie, do me a favor? Would you give that to our waitress? We're kind of in a hurry.",
        "Bernie: Let's forget the check. Not always I get the chance to buy breakfast for a champion. Doc, come by anytime.",
        "Doc: Much appreciated, Bernie. Thanks a lot.",
        "Kim: Thanks, Bernie.",
        "Doc: I'll fight you on this.",
        "Kim: Be my guest. But don't think for a minute that you're going to drag my family through the mud. You want to pick this fight, I promise you it will be very quiet, very painful, and I will win.",
        "Doc: Just remember, it takes two to tango. Margo Hughes was not a happy woman.",
        "Kim: You know something? There's a time in everybody's life where they're not happy. So you can either be a friend and be supportive, or you can be a predator and take advantage.",
        "Doc: If it wasn't me, it would've been someone else.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, it was you, wasn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I heard Casey banging around in his room. He'll be down soon.",
        "Margo: So, are you gonna even consider what I said?",
        "Tom: I considered it. I mean, what it would mean to stick and pretend that everything was just fine.",
        "Margo: Well, we don't have to pretend. We'd be going to counseling.",
        "Tom: You go to counseling. You're the one who had the affair. I mean, that is what it was.",
        "Margo: You had a baby with Emily Stewart, for God's sakes! We got through that.",
        "Tom: Worst mistake of my life, and I fought like a dog to get you back. You just don't seem to think it's worth the effort.",
        "Margo: Well, so you think that I wouldn't even try to --",
        "Tom: Look, I don't know where you are these days. But I know we can't do this with Casey upstairs.",
        "Margo: Right, so you need me to somehow prove to you that I still love you.",
        "Tom: And that you're not latching on because Doc Reese got a new girlfriend, and you don't feel like being alone.",
        "Casey: Wow. All three of us in the same room -- finally. And Dad has a suitcase.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: There's some fresh towels in the linen closet by the bathroom.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Sierra: You know, Lucy, I think there's some things we should get straight. What I saw in Reno, no mother wants that for her 18-year-old daughter. But I left you and Dusty there to work things out for yourselves. Remember that. You want to tell me what happened?",
        "Lucy: What's the point? You don't understand. You don't get Dusty.",
        "Sierra: Lucy, I have known Dusty since before you were born. I know exactly the kind of man he is. At the very least, he is troubled. Not to mention twice your age.",
        "Lucy: He's not twice my age. Besides, age -- it doesn't matter. He knows what's in my heart without even having to ask. And I'm the same way about him.",
        "Sierra: Then what happened?",
        "Lucy: You freaked him out. You made him feel guilty and wrong.",
        "Sierra: You know, Lucy, if Dusty thought that the two you were really meant to be together, nothing and nobody would've driven him away. He did what he thought was right. And I think that you did, too. And that's why you came back. I'm sorry you're angry with me. But I will take the heat if it means that you'll be safe. The flight leaves at 6:00.",
        "Lily: How's Lucy?",
        "Sierra: Miserable and hating me, but she'll be okay.",
        "Lily: She's still refusing to go?",
        "Sierra: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Sierra: Since when did you become Craig's little errand girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: So you're siding with me?",
        "Craig: No. No, this isn't a warm and fuzzy, little buddy. I think she'll be better off in a country with state security. Other than that -- believe me, this is a leap of faith.",
        "Alan: Well, that's big of you. Although, I've done nothing to earn your suspicion, or Lily's.",
        "Craig: Well, Dusty did name you as a suspect.",
        "Alan: And you.",
        "Craig: Alan, come on. You know better.",
        "Alan: And this proves it?",
        "Craig: If I had some kind lot.",
        "Alan: What I don't pretend to understand you, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Well, then let me be spell it out for you. I will do anything to protect my daughter. Okay? I want you and Sierra to take Lucy to Montega tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Will he be okay?",
        "Nurse: He lost a lot of blood, he's really dehydrated, and one of his cuts is infected, but he'll survive. Plus a strong antibiotic in here, and the fluids are running wide open. That should help a lot. I'll check back in a little.",
        "Dusty: What's going on? What's going on?",
        "Nikki: Welcome home. You're at Memorial.",
        "Dusty: How'd I get here?",
        "Nikki: Looks like you babbled and bled all over yourself on the plane. You scared a couple of flight attendants. They called the ground, the ground notified the Oakdale P.D.",
        "Dusty: I got to get out of here.",
        "Nikki: Okay. Stand up, let's go. Maybe later.",
        "Dusty: Where's Lucy?",
        "Nikki: She's fine. I took her home myself. And you, my friend, are gonna stay in the hospital.",

        "Casey: One of you met somebody else, right?",
        "Tom: You want to start?",
        "Margo: No, I think you should.",
        "Tom: All right, Case, I know that things have been weird around here lately.",
        "Casey: Are you guys getting a divorce?",
        "Tom: Nobody's said anything about a divorce.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well then what's with the suitcase?",
        "Tom: Your mom and I need a little time out. I'm gonna be over at the Lakeview for a while.",
        "Casey: Why? How'd everything get so bad?",
        "Tom: Because of my job I haven't been able to be here for you, or Mom. And it's caused some problems.",
        "Casey: So quit. I mean, if it's your job, then why can't you just go back to being a lawyer?",
        "Tom: That's one of the things I'll be considering.",
        "Margo: Casey, much won't change.",
        "Tom: Yeah, but you're gonna see more of me than you have the last few months. I'll see to that. We'll get a regular golf game going. Is that all right with you, tiger?",
        "Casey: Well tonight I'm \"champ,\" today I'm \"tiger.\" Why do parents always give little nicknames right before they ruin your life?",
        "Margo: Casey, we're not trying to hurt you.",
        "Casey: Newsflash! You're breaking up.",
        "Margo: No, I don't want to break up the family. It's just, I love your father and I need him to do what he needs to do.",
        "Casey: I still don't get this. So what if Dad worked a lot of hours. So do you. It's always been like that. What's different? What aren't you telling me? One of you met somebody else, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bernie: Just say the word.",

        "Bernie: Oh, you're kidding. Why?",
        "Doc: Things didn't work out at WOAK.",

        "Lily: Craig and I have always been close, you know that.",
        "Sierra: You know, you act like he's the injured party here. This isn't Alan's fault.",
        "Lily: So why can't Craig know? Is that Alan's idea too?",
        "Sierra: Too?",
        "Lily: Because this trip to Montega, it's Alan's idea, isn't it?",
        "Sierra: No, we discussed it before I went to Reno. Lily?",
        "Lily: It doesn't sound like you, Sierra, that's all.",
        "Sierra: You know what, I don't need to defend my decisions about Lucy to anybody else.",
        "Lily: Even if I gave advice with Lucy?",
        "Sierra: Of course you can. But please, do what's best for her. Don't undermine this trip.",

        "Craig: Lullaby. How do you feel?",
        "Lucy: Great.",
        "Lucy: Nothing did happen to me. Dad, I wish you and Mom would just relax.",
        "Craig: This should've all turned out so differently. The beginning of the summer feels like a lifetime ago.",
        "Lucy: It was.",
        "Craig: Remember a fit I threw when you said you were going down and visit with your mom in Montega? Now I wish you had gone.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, no --",
        "Craig: You were on your way to Montega when all this craziness happened.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but, thing's are different. I'm different.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but won't Montega be good for you? Mango in the morning. Beach in the afternoon.",
        "Lucy: That's not why you want me to go.",
        "Craig: I know you'd be safe there.",
        "Lucy: No, you want to keep me away from Dusty. But it's not gonna work.",

        "Nikki: Hey, you look better. Whatever's in that IV must have kicked in.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah. I feel better. What's all that?",
        "Nikki: Just tying up loose ends. Closing up the case.",
        "Dusty: He's still out there, you know?",
        "Nikki: No, it's not him. It's the Starziak case. Did you hear before you left for Reno? We found Starziak's body in the river.",
        "Dusty: What about Snyder? No? Don't worry about him. He a tough guy, he'll probably swim out of it.",
        "Nikki: There's no way he would have survived that. We're still looking for his body. You were friends?",
        "Dusty: He was a good guy, for a cop. A fair guy. Funny. Really funny. He's the type of guy who had his eye on the ball, you know, on stuff that mattered -- his family, and work and doing the right stuff. So how many body counts for my friend Starziak so far?",
        "Nikki: Hey.",
        "Dusty: We got one uniform, we got my friend, Molly.",
        "Nikki: Now, that wasn't your fault. We were closing in on him. I was closing in on him, that's what made him go crazy.",
        "Dusty: That's okay. It doesn't matter. If I wasn't around, if he wasn't looking for me, you know, he wouldn't have been around.",
        "Nikki: There is some good news. The Starzial case is closed. There weren't any charges against him, which means there's nothing hanging over your head either. Your past is officially expunged.",
        "Dusty: Hmm, there's a thought.",

        "Dusty: You saw her? Huh? Yes? How'd she look?",

        "[Dusty laughs ] Dusty: She didn't like that!",
        "Nikki: No, she hated it.",
        "Dusty: She'll get used to it. Once she feels the sunlight on the beach, she'll forget. None of it should've happened. None of it.",

        "Dusty: Yeah. Try to expunge her past for me, too.",

        "Margo: Well, because none of us know the whole story. We just, we don't know what it is. That's just what it is. You know what, you've got a golf lesson in about half an hour. So why don't you get your clubs in the car, okay?",
        "Casey: No, you don't have to drive me.",
        "Margo: I want to drive you.",

        "Margo: We love you. Thank you so much for not saying anything about Doc.",
        "Tom: He doesn't need to know anything about him. It would just hurt him more.",
        "Margo: Well, there was some truth in what you said. There is no third party.",
        "Tom: Now. So tell me something, when you were sneaking out to see Doc Reese, did you even give one single thought to Casey?",
        "Margo: I guess I deserve that.",
        "Casey: I'm set.",
        "Margo: So, you gonna come with us?",

        "Wade: Yeah. He said he flew in from Reno. He said something happened there?",
        "Lucy: I know. How is he now?",
        "Wade: Not so hot. He lost a lot of blood. He kept asking for you, saying your name, but his phone is turned off in his room, so I offered to make the call for him.",
        "Lucy: I'll be right there.",
        "Wade: Dusty'll be glad to see you, that's for sure. He's on the fifth floor. Room 503.",

        "Sierra: Well, what did you say to her?",

        "Sierra: There's no master plot.",
        "Craig: And what's up with that, anyway.",
        "Sierra: Dusty just did the decent thing. He sent her away. And that's why she's lashing out at all of us.",
        "Alan: So invite him along. If that's what it takes to convince Lucy this isn't about Dusty, why not? Tell her he's welcome to come stay in Montega with us.",
        "Craig: What are you nuts?",
        "Sierra: No, he's brilliant. That is so smart. Don't you see? Dusty won't come. And then Lucy loses her excuse.",
        "Alan: Anything to get her on that plane, sweetheart. Listen, I have to get to the bank before we leave.",
        "Sierra: I'll come with you. Alan's plan will work. And it's really the best thing.",
        "Lily: Boy, oh boy, Alan is determined to get Lucy on that plane.",
        "Craig: Yeah. I could tell when I talked to him, their minds are made up.",
        "Lily: I think he made up Sierra's mind for her. Did you really tell Lucy you think it's best for her to go?",
        "Craig: Well, I was trying to buy some time.",
        "Lily: Time? We got to find something to nail Alan.",
        "Craig: No, no. Lily, there's not much we can do. Sierra won't listen to me.",
        "Lily: Or me. I had it out with her. I just cannot let my niece leave the country with Alan. I got it. I got it. I got a way to stop them. Come on, come on. Let's go. Come on!",

        "Lucy: Hi. I'd like to know if a friend of mine was admitted as a patient today. Donovan. Dusty Donovan. Could you tell what room, or could you connect me? Okay, then maybe to the nurses' desk on that floor? Thanks. Hi, somebody called me from the hospital and told me that a friend of mine was in there. Dusty Donovan. Can you tell me how he's doing? A close friend. Fine. You know what, never mind, I will just find out for myself. Could you tell him that Lucy's on her way. Thanks.",

        "Tom: Why would you be feeling guilty?",
        "Kim: Oh, God. Because I'm the one who brought Doc to Oakdale. I mean, I'd heard he was troublemaker, but I didn't think he was -- I just didn't think.",
        "Tom: Well, you're not responsible for Doc's behavior. Or anyone else's.",

        "Tom: So would it make me a small person if I was enjoying this a little bit?",
        "Kim: Oh, my darling, you would have company. I enjoyed it myself. Maybe, a little bit too much. Anyway, it's done. And I think it's safe to say that our old pal Dr. Death is on his own.",
