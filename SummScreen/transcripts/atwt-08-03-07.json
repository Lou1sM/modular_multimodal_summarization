        "Bob: I asked a question. Is everything all right?",
        "Susan: Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Bob: Well, I heard you halfway down the corridor. You didn't sound happy.",
        "Alison: Bob, it's my fault. I have this special gift of always saying the wrong thing and getting her angry.",
        "Bob: Susan, if you need time to talk to Alison, I'll cover for you.",
        "Susan: I don't need to talk to Alison. I think we've said everything that we need to say.",
        "[Pager beep]",
        "Bob: I've got to go. Just let me know if you decide to leave early.",
        "Susan: Well, that was fun. That really made me feel professional.",
        "Dusty: Let Bob cover for you. We'll take you home.",
        "Susan: You don't tell me what to do.",
        "Dusty: We'll take you home, or I tell Bob you're drinking. It's your choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So, listen, I'm behind the bar, and I know, in about 30 seconds there's going to be a huge fight. And neither of these guys are backing down, and they're big and they're idiots. Do you know what the hardest thing in the world is?",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Aaron: Getting a drunk to change the subject. So, to keep the peace --",
        "Sofie: Cole.",
        "Cole: We had a little talk, but you didn't listen. I told you I didn't want you working tonight.",
        "Sofie: I know, but --",
        "Cole: So, what the hell are you still doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: What's this?",
        "Gwen: These are clothes that I used to wear when I had a band. Here. Come here. Stand up. Put it on. It looks a lot better on you than it did on me.",
        "Sage: I like this.",
        "Gwen: Right here? Put it on. Put all this stuff on. Actually -- [Singing] Ta dum-da-dum -- I have an idea. We'll take pictures and then, you can tell J.J. that you were a rockstar when he gets back.",
        "Sage: You're sure he's going to get back?",
        "Gwen: Yes. I'm absolutely sure.",
        "Sage: What's this?",
        "Gwen: It's, um -- I forgot about that. I bought this for will's nephew, Johnny.",
        "Sage: But someone took him away and they never came back. So when you say J.J.'s coming back --",
        "Gwen: Hey, he's gonna come back. Okay. I know that this is really hard. But we're not going to think that way. All right? We're just not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: You guys got the money. You don't need me anymore.",
        "Ava: Anything you can do to shut him up would be greatly appreciated.",
        "J.J.: You guys got to let me go home!",
        "Silas: Okay! Okay. New situation, new rules. Snotty little kids don't give orders to adults. Got it? Got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey. I was just going over the calls we got from that PSA to see if I missed anything.",
        "Katie: Oh, it doesn't matter. You don't have to, something happened.",
        "Brad: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Yeah, a woman saw it. And tracked me down, and said she knows where Silas Jenkins is probably headed.",
        "Brad: That's great. That's great. You told Jack?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Katie: Jack, you'll never guess what just -- happened. It -- it was great to have some good news for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What, did he check out? I mean, was the tip legit?",
        "Katie: Yeah, this woman said that she used to know Jenkins and his wife knows exactly where they hang out. Someplace in Idaho. So, Jack checked it out, and -- what is wrong with me? I'm an awful person, I'm evil.",
        "Brad: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look, I'm not going to let anyone talk about my pal like that. Not even you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We are not gonna argue about this, there's no point. Because you're not going with me.",
        "Carly: He needs us both, Jack.",
        "Jack: I am doing this alone.",
        "Carly: Well, you can't stop me.",
        "Jack: No? Before I let you get on that plane with me -- I'll throw you back in jail.",
        "Carly: All right, Jack, let's not do this. Let's not go back to you barking orders and making threats.",
        "Jack: I will do whatever it takes to keep you from going to Idaho.",
        "Carly: I see. So, you're upset about J.J., so it's time for you to push everybody away, right?",
        "Jack: You just --",
        "Carly: You can do it all by yourself.",
        "Jack: Just listen to me for a second.",
        "Carly: You don't need anybody's help, do you? Least of all, mine.",
        "Jack: Carly!",
        "Carly: I'm listening.",
        "Jack: If I show up with a woman, if I'm part of a couple, that makes me less anonymous.",
        "Carly: Then, we'll keep our distance, Jack. We don't have to be together.",
        "Jack: More than that, Carly. When it comes to your kids -- you love them so much you make emotional decisions.",
        "Carly: Oh I see. I'm emotional. And you, not so much.",
        "Jack: When I'm working a case, I keep my emotions in check. Thank you.",
        "Carly: Okay, so, if we follow that argument to its logical conclusion, Jack, you shouldn't go either. It should be some cop who's never even met J.J., who has no personal feelings about it whatsoever.",
        "Jack: I can't ask somebody else.",
        "Carly: Why not? You're just got out of the hospital, you are just as emotional as I am. Why do you have to go?",
        "Jack: I just have to.",
        "Carly: And that's the end of the conversation.",
        "Jack: Carly? You and I? We've been going through hell. I don't want to fight with you about this. And you're right, I've been making threats. I've been shutting you out and I'm sorry about that.",
        "Carly: I'm just worried about you.",
        "Jack: I know you are. What I should have said, was please, please, stay here and take care of Parker and Sage. Can you do that? Because I'm really, really worried about them.",
        "Carly: And if I think J.J. needs me more?",
        "Jack: Well, then we're back to threats and orders.",
        "Carly: In the thrill of realizing that I still love you, I forgot how much I can hate you.",
        "Jack: I will find him and I will bring him back to you.",
        "Carly: Be careful.",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: About what?",
        "Katie: For losing it like this. I mean, it's good, right? It's good news. At least Jack knows where to look now.",
        "Brad: Does Carly know about it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, she was at the police station when I got there.",
        "Brad: So, you get to deliver the good news and then come back to work alone.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brad: I think you're handling a really rotten situation really well.",
        "Katie: Well, the rotten situation is happening to Jack and Carly.",
        "Brad: What about you? I mean, you love Jack, you love J.J., but you see how awful this is for Jack and Carly, so you back off.",
        "Katie: I've never seen people so scared in my life. Both Jack and Carly.",
        "Brad: Are you scared?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He shouldn't be out of the hospital, much less going after J.J.",
        "Brad: Did you try telling him that?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I did. But it's no use. He wants to find his son. He's going to find J.J.",
        "Brad: Do you think it might be too late?",
        "Katie: Yeah I do. I don't know. God, I shouldn't even be saying that.",
        "Brad: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We were all thinking it. We're all scared, we all feel helpless. And you can't talk about it to the person you love most. And you know -- you add insult to injury, you're here. You're stuck with a mutt like me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So, you really think that it's okay for you to dismiss or to defy what I told you to do?",
        "Sofie: Cole, I didn't think you really meant it.",
        "Cole: You didn't? Where would you get an idea like that?",
        "Sofie: Well, you said get another job, and maybe I could look, but why not keep this one until I find something else?",
        "Cole: Because I don't like this place and I really don't like the people who hang out in this place.",
        "Sofie: Finding a job is not that easy. And we need the money if you want to get out of Oakdale like you said.",
        "Cole: You know what really ticks me off? When you use my ambition, my own dreams against me.",
        "Sofie: I'm trying to help.",
        "Cole: I think you're trying to do something else. Let's go.",
        "Sofie: But my shift isn't over.",
        "Cole: I say it is.",
        "Sofie: Cole, even if I try to get another job, I need a reference from this place. I walk out. I can't get another job.",
        "Customer: Hey, Sofie, can I get a check?",
        "Sofie: Just a second. Okay?",
        "Cole: Sofie, what, he knows your name?",
        "Sofie: You're supposed to introduce yourself when you wait on customers. It's just being friendly.",
        "Cole: Friendly? That's what you call it?",
        "Sofie: Cole, you're exhausted, you worked all day. Go sit down in the lobby, I'll bring you a soda. We'll leave as soon as my shift is over.",
        "Customer: Hey, Sofie. Sometime tonight?",
        "Sofie: Cole, I can't blow this tip. Here you go.",
        "Aaron: Cole, right?",
        "Cole: What do you want?",
        "Aaron: I'd just like to set the record straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: When did this happen? When did you decide that the Stewart family is your personal domain? And you, don't feel a little hypocritical here?",
        "Alison: I could kind of get away with going to work high. But a doctor, mom? This is bad, and you know it.",
        "Dusty: Susan.",
        "Susan: Don't. Stop with the Susans. I'm going to take Bob up on his offer, okay?",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Susan: No. It's not good. It's blackmail, that's what this is. It's --",
        "Bob: You're still at it, huh?",
        "Bob: That's okay. It's fine. No problem. I just hope you feel better.",
        "Susan: Oh, I've got my family to take care of me. I'm lucky.",
        "Alison: I'll drive.",
        "Susan: Whatever.",
        "Dusty: You're doing the right thing.",
        "Susan: Oh, that's really great. That's so special. A little lesson on right and wrong from Mr. Moral Authority. I don't feel so well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: It's really important that you don't give up hope. I know that your mom and your dad -- I know they're going to find J.J. and they're going to bring him home.",
        "Sage: But, all these awful things happen. All the time.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, awful things do happen. And good things happen, too. And miracles.",
        "Sage: Like what?",
        "Gwen: Like Will and I are going to have a baby.",
        "Sage: You are?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm. And you know what? That's a huge miracle. Because the doctors told me that I couldn't have any more kids. By next April, you're going to have a new cousin.",
        "Sage: Gwen!",
        "Gwen: Pretty cool, huh? Right? So, repeat after me. Good things do happen.",
        "Sage: Good things do happen.",
        "Gwen: And you know what the coolest part is? You're not going to be the youngest one anymore. You can have your cousin. You can boss them around.",
        "Sage: I'm going to be really nice to -- do you think it's a girl?",
        "Gwen: It's going to be a girl or a boy. One of the two, I hope.",
        "Sage: I don't care.",
        "Gwen: Me, either. Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi, Guys. Hi, Honey.",
        "Sage: Hi, Mommy. Guess what?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Sage: Aunt Gwen's going to have a baby!",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, yes. Well, I heard about this. I knew that Gwen would want to tell you herself. Isn't that wonderful?",
        "Sage: I want it to be a girl.",
        "Carly: That'd be nice. Well, sit down here, Honey. I have something that I want to tell you myself. And it's good.",
        "Sage: J.J.'s back?",
        "Carly: Well, no. But we think we know where he is. And Daddy went to go get him.",
        "Gwen: Oh, wow, Carly. That's amazing. Sage, remember those cookies we made? You want to go put them on a plate and have a tea party in a little bit?",
        "Sage: Okay. But we'll save some for J.J.",
        "Carly: So, how are you doing? I hope she's not wearing you out.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no. Are you kidding? I love having her here. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: It's Jack. I don't think he should be going.",
        "Gwen: He's not well enough yet?",
        "Carly: It's not that. Something's off -- and I just can't quite figure out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Drink this.",
        "Susan: Okay. You saved me. You happy? You working on a triple play here, or what?",
        "Dusty: Anything else I can do, let me know.",
        "Susan: Oh, he's leaving? He's not even going to help me through the night? Such a great guy. Never asks for anything in return. Well, he sort of does.",
        "Alison: Stop it.",
        "Susan: That man has no right to meddle in my life. No right at all.",
        "Alison: He's gone, Mom.",
        "Susan: And you -- you dragged him to the hospital and publicly humiliated me in my place of work! I work there. Bob was there.",
        "Alison: This is payback, right?",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Alison: You haven't forgotten all the attitude I gave you when I was high.",
        "Susan: I'm not high!",
        "Alison: You're an alcoholic who's drinking again.",
        "Susan: What do you care? The last six months have showed me how much you really care about my well-being.",
        "Alison: You know, what really bothers me, is that I think you have a real point. That I put you through such hell, and now the strongest person that I know has slipped. I wish I could get sober for you, but we both know I can't. So, this is totally up to you, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Since she's the newest hire, she really doesn't have a choice about working tonight. She tried to turn it down, but somebody called in sick.",
        "Cole: And you are?",
        "Aaron: I'm Aaron, I'm one of the bartenders.",
        "Cole: And my girlfriend's your business because?",
        "Aaron: She's a human being, and we work together.",
        "Cole: Well, you're all kinds of wonderful, aren't you?",
        "Aaron: I just thought you should know what happened.",
        "Cole: So, what, she's worked here, for what, a day? And already you're, like, her protector, because that's just the kind of guy you are?",
        "Aaron: Well, I'm beginning to figure out what kind of guy you are.",
        "Cole: Ah, funny man, huh? Look, I know exactly what you're about, just like I know exactly how to stop it.",
        "Sofie: Don't do this, please, Cole.",
        "Cole: Let me set this clear, okay? You have nothing to say about this. This is between him and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I think maybe he's right.",
        "Silas: What?",
        "Ava: We got the money, what do we need him for?",
        "Silas: I promised the kid's daddy we'd take care of him, and Les expected me to keep my word.",
        "Ava: Yeah, well, Les promised you the key to a safety deposit box that doesn't exist, so I'd say all bets are off.",
        "Silas: He didn't lie. Maybe Julia found the key, and kept the money for herself.",
        "Ava: So, what, now we're saddled with her brat?",
        "Silas: I promised les we'd raise him the way Les would have.",
        "J.J.: What are you talking about? You can't raise me. I'm not yours.",
        "Silas: The first thing we're going to do is teach you some manners. Les was real particular about kids being seen and not heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You actually made me feel a lot better.",
        "Brad: Get out of here. I never make anyone feel better. Well, I mean, physically.",
        "Katie: Hey. When you get out of your own way, you're actually very sweet. Do you think Jack is doing the right thing?",
        "Brad: I don't worry about right and wrong when it doesn't make any difference.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Brad: You and I both know that Jack is going, no matter what. And there's no force on earth that's going to stop him.",
        "Katie: That's a good thing about him.",
        "Brad: Maybe.",
        "Katie: It is. It's one of the things that made me fall in love with him, how simple and clear he is about everything. Now it just scares me.",
        "Brad: Look, he's going to be okay. You don't have to worry about him. He can take care of himself, okay? What you need to focus on is being hopeful. That's how Jack needs you to be.",
        "Katie: I know. And I made this big deal about him calling me before he left. I shouldn't have him thinking about me when he has all this other stuff to worry about.",
        "Jack: Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Come on Carly, you're scared out of your mind.",
        "Carly: No. No, no. I know Jack. And there's something he's not telling me.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Carly: He's an incredibly brave man, but he's not reckless. And when we were talking about this, I was telling him that he's just as emotional about it as I am. He just got out of the hospital, and now he's going to go undercover. And don't you think there's a pretty good chance these kidnappers know him -- they know what he looks like?",
        "Gwen: I guess.",
        "Carly: Well then, why is he going? Why doesn't he send somebody else? Somebody from the FBI? Someone else?",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Well, I think I do. See, Jack -- he would willingly, gladly risk his life to get J.J. home, but he would never, ever ask anybody else to do that. I'm going, too.",
        "Gwen: If it's dangerous for Jack, don't you think it's going to be dangerous for you, too?",
        "Carly: Probably. Doesn't matter.",
        "Gwen: It doesn't matter? Do you think it's fair to Parker, or to Sage, to have both their parents in the line of fire?",
        "Carly: No. But I didn't do that. The scum who took J.J. did that.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Carly: And I think it's very important for Parker and Sage to see that their parents will do whatever they have to do to protect them. I need you to do something for me.",
        "Gwen: Anything.",
        "Carly: Can Parker and Sage stay here with you while I'm gone?",
        "Gwen: Of course.",
        "Sage: Mommy?",
        "Carly: Hey, Sweetheart. So, I want you to know that everything's fine -- that everything will be fine. I just need to say good-bye to you for a bit.",
        "Sage: Are you going with Daddy?",
        "Carly: And Gwen is going to look after you.",
        "Gwen: Actually, she's going to look after me. She's been a great helper.",
        "Carly: Are you okay with that?",
        "Sage: I think you should go. I'm fine, and J.J. needs you.",
        "Carly: You are a terrific kid.",
        "Sage: I'll go get the cookies I wrapped up for him.",
        "Carly: She's strong. Like her dad.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, like somebody else I know.",
        "Carly: I'm going to go pick up Parker.",
        "Gwen: Look, if you don't time, I can go pick him up.",
        "Carly: No. This is something that I need to talk with him about in person. It's not just what this man has done to J.J. think about what Sage and Parker are going through.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Carly: And when they catch him, I'm going to see to it that he pays for what he's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I couldn't get a flight for a couple of hours, so I went by the farm to say good-bye to Parker.",
        "Katie: Is he okay?",
        "Jack: It was nice to give him some good news for a change.",
        "Katie: So, are you all packed?",

        "Brad: Guys, what are you doing? You have this small window of good-bye time, and you're talking about packing and carry-ons. Okay -- go in the room, or something -- you know? Hey, let me tell you something, you need to get him back, okay? And if you need any backup, you just -- you know what I mean? Okay?",
        "Jack: I think -- I think that was Brad being sensitive.",
        "Katie: He's actually been really great. You know, and he loves you and your kids so much.",
        "Jack: The most unreliable guy on the face of the earth. If I ever needed backup, I think I could actually could call him. How are you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm -- I'm good.",
        "Jack: You're such a liar. I know you don't want me to go.",
        "Katie: Come on. If I'm going to be a detective's wife, you can't call me out when I'm trying to be brave.",
        "Jack: If you're going a detective's wife, we don't have to talk about really important things with Carly standing there. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Katie: Wait, stop. Please, Jack. For you to worry about me when you and Carly are going through what you're going through is just wrong, okay? Please -- I am the least of your worries.",

        "Susan: Don't do that. Don't blame yourself. It's not going to help either one of us.",
        "Alison: But you blame yourself, don't you?",
        "Susan: Don't analyze me.",
        "Alison: It's not hard. Emily messes up, I mess up -- you yell at us a little, but you really take it out on yourself, don't you?",
        "Susan: I should have been able to protect you.",
        "Alison: You did, Mom. Up until tonight. Do you know how scary this is for me? You're not just my rock, Mom. You're my hope. And if you can't do this, I know in my heart I can't.",
        "Susan: Don't say that.",
        "Alison: But I think we could do it together. We are both people who need help. And the strongest thing we can right now and just admit that.",
        "Susan: I am not feeling very strong right now.",
        "Alison: I know, I understand. But the fact is, this was a slip, and the faster you get to the meeting, the faster you can put this behind you --",
        "Susan: I don't want to go to a meeting.",
        "Alison: -- I know, but if you don't, tomorrow is going to be so much worse than today, and then the next day will be even worse than that.",
        "Susan: I thought today was going to be a good day. I woke up this morning, I -- having a good dream about Emily and Daniel, and they were laughing, and I couldn't remember for a few seconds that you'd moved out.",
        "Alison: I'll move back in.",
        "Susan: No! No, no. It's just that, I have been in a very bad place, and I've been ignoring it. I thought that if I got up this morning, had a cup of coffee and I checked my email, that little voice in my head would go away, but it didn't. So, I just had a couple of drinks at lunch, just to shut it up. What am I saying? I've been planning that drink since I bought the bottle in the liquor store a couple days ago, and I should've done something about it then.",
        "Alison: Do it now. There's a meeting starting in a couple minutes, and we can go together.",
        "Susan: I don't want to go. I mean, do I really have to stand up for the umpteenth time and say, \"I'm Susan, I'm an alcoholic, I've been sober for 20 minutes.\"",

        "Aaron: Sofie, we got to get back to work.",

        "Sofie: Cole, I have to get back to work.",
        "Cole: Yeah, don't let me stop you. In fact, don't even give me another thought.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry.",

        "Sofie: He's under a lot of pressure. He worries about things.",

        "Sofie: Doing what?",
        "Aaron: Apologizing for your boyfriend's behavior. I'm sorry. As your friend already pointed out, it's really none of my business.",
        "Sofie: No, you were just trying to help -- and Cole, it's just -- he gets a little possessive sometimes.",
        "Aaron: Right.",
        "Sofie: A lot.",
        "Aaron: Huh?",
        "Sofie: I'm answering your question. I apologize for him a lot.",
        "Aaron: I thought we already covered that it was none of my business.",
        "Sofie: I just want you to understand. I think, in a weird way, he's kind of shy -- and things come out wrong.",
        "Aaron: Shy.",
        "Sofie: He's really a nice guy once you get to know him.",
