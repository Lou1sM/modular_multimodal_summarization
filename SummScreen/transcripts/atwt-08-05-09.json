        "Parker prepares for the photo shoot, as Craig is proud of himself that things are falling into place with Carly's family. Jay tells Audrey that he wants cash, as Henry shows up, not knowing what is going on and pleads with Jay for him not to drink the coffee in his mother's room. Audrey laughs, as she explains that Henry thinks she is a serial killer. He has evidence. Henry leaves with Jay and shows him all the obituaries of men that his mom carries in her luggage - all men his mother has dated, as Jay laughs it off, but Henry is serious about this. Brad and Katie speak with Terri about her co-hosting with Brad on Oakdale Now. Terri is thrilled and can't wait to start, but Brad and Katie explain they have to pitch this to Kim first. Terri has to talk to Rosanna as well about how this affects her looking after Parker and Sage. Janet is feeling a bit down with how her life turned out even though she wouldn't change having Liberty for anything, but compared to Terri her life seems boring. Jack thinks he has an idea and heads over to talk with Brad about a favor - he would like Brad to get Janet a job as co-host. Katie and Brad don't understand why Janet suddenly needs something different, as Jack explains. They explain that they just offered Terri the job, as Jack wonders if they can take it back. They aren't sure they can, but when Jack waxes on about what will happen if Terri gets the job, how Sage will lose her new friend and Janet will become more depressed, Katie and Brad agree to tell Terri they are going with Janet instead. Janet is moody later still in thought about how her life turned out when Liberty shows up to tell her about her plans and ask her to make her food. Next Parker arrives, who needs the day off. Janet is miffed by them both but agrees to let Parker leave, but then tells Liberty her plans have changed and she is now doing Parker's job. Liberty is annoyed and calls Janet on being upset that Terri is cooler then she. Terri tells Craig and Rosanna about her offer, as Rosanna is unsure but Craig acts happy for her. Rosanna worries about how this new job will affect the kids so Craig goes to talk with Terri on his own and explains how important she is to the kids and how he will make sure she has a good job waiting for her after the summer, as Terri is confused. Parker does his first photo shoot, as Liberty shows up to watch. She asks Parker to hang out after, but Rosanna worries she will upset Parker and he needs to concentrate, but Parker assures her that they are just friends now. Terri turns down Brad and Katie's job offer. She is disappointed to have to, but she is happy that Janet will be taking the job instead. They make a pact not to tell Janet about this, Audrey goes to the hospital for the DNA results but sees Katie. She asks her not to tell Henry because she is just there for a check up. When the nurse comes back over, Audrey blows her off in front of Katie. Katie doesn't suspect anything, as they talk. Jay tells Audrey that he played the part with Henry, but he wants his money. Audrey promises when they find the real Jay, he will. Henry learns from the bartender that the man he thought was named Jay is really named Raymond, as he is confused by what is going on. Parker and Liberty meet up and talk about his photo shoot and how he is helping out but secretly enjoying it. Parker seems finally content with how his life is and how he and Liberty are finally in a good place. Liberty, however, wants to go for a car ride and get away for a while with Parker. However, when the photographer shows up and wants to do a few more shots, Parker leaves to do it, as Liberty is slightly bothered about him blowing her off now. Rosanna learns Terri isn't taking the job. as Teri explains it was thanks to Craig really explaining about the kids that changed her mind. Brad offers Janet the co-hosting job; at first she thinks it is because they feel sorry for her, but they convince her otherwise, so she happily takes the job. Craig wishes Rosanna would give him some credit for how he is helping out, as Rosanna can't help but ride him about why he needs her approval when he has such a fan in Terri. Audrey finally receives her DNA test over the phone; the samples she brought in were a match. Henry goes to a disbelieving Katie for help in proving his mother is a killer based on the fact of the 'Jay who is really Raymond' fiasco."

        "Jack: Not that I know of, or is that a trick question?",

        "Janet: Don't you have to go to work or something?",
        "Jack: Margo said I could have the swing shift today. What's wrong, Honey?",
        "Janet: Nothing! I'm just -- I'm a little bummed out about dinner, that's all. It's no big deal. I'll get over it.",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm still crazy about your meatballs, no matter what your sister cooks.",
        "Janet: Don't turn this into a joke!",
        "Jack: Oh, come on! Honey, you're obviously overreacting a little bit. Don't you think?",
        "Janet: Oh, you would feel differently if you were in my shoes.",
        "Jack: You and Teri are different people. You can't judge yourself based on her accomplishments.",
        "Janet: This is not about Teri. This is about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Isn't there usually someone to do this on a photo shoot?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, there usually is, when they can afford it. In the meantime, I'm going to be lint lady until we get our product on the shelves.",
        "Craig: Guys, come on. We have to go. We have to meet the photographer at the tennis courts.",
        "Parker: All right. I'm gonna go over to Al's and let Janet know that I can't work today.",
        "Rosanna: Parker, you left that till today?",
        "Craig: Go. Parker, we'll meet you at the location!",
        "Rosanna: Ooh! \"The location\"? The location, the location. Whoo! The location.",
        "Craig: I'm gonna let that slide. Parker seems pretty happy to be doing this.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, Parker is thrilled to pieces.",
        "Craig: Sage?",
        "Rosanna: Sage is happy, too. Teri is picking her up later at the community center.",
        "Craig: Really? Hmm. And what do you know, here I told you everything was gonna work out just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jay: I was starting to think you weren't here.",
        "Audrey: Isn't it a little early? And what are you doing here?",
        "Jay: You didn't really think I would stay away, now, did you?",
        "Audrey: Hoping. I was hoping. Of course hopes never worked very well for me.",
        "Jay: How about honor? Hmm? You made a commitment to me, and I expect you to make good on it.",
        "Audrey: I will. I -- I will. Listen, you may have heard a lot of things about me, but I am nothing if not trustworthy.",
        "Jay: Audrey, save your breath. The only language I speak is cash.",
        "Audrey: You men. How about coffee? Room service just brought a fresh pot.",
        "Jay: Thank you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Audrey: Excuse me.",
        "Henry: You can't keep the robe, Mother. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't drink that! Don't drink that!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hi. Thank you so much for coming over.",
        "Teri: Oh, not a problem. I don't have to pick up Sage until later. Hey, Katie. How are you feeling?",
        "Katie: Pregnant. Brad, will you get Teri some coffee, please?",
        "Teri: Oh, thanks, but I'm coffee'ed out.",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no. Katie can't have caffeine, so she's pushing it on everyone else.",
        "Katie: I just want to watch you drink it.",
        "Teri: So, what's up, guys? What do you want to talk to me about?",
        "Brad: You know the show \"Oakdale Now\"?",
        "Teri: Of course. It's with that woman Geneva something or other.",
        "Brad: Swift.",
        "Teri: Who turned out to be a guy in drag, right? I saw it on UsTube. She was hysterical.",
        "Katie: Not in a good way, though.",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, I was Geneva's --",
        "Teri: I know, sidekick.",
        "Brad: No, no. No. I was the star of the show. Geneva was more of a novelty, like a chimp in a dress.",
        "Katie: Brad.",
        "Brad: Anyway, okay. Katie and I are normally hosts of the show, but, you know, she can't work -- because, you know, until after the baby's born.",
        "Katie: Right. That's why they were trying out new co-hosts.",
        "Teri: Oh, that must have been weird for you.",
        "Katie: You have no idea.",
        "Brad: So, Geneva's gone, Katie's unavailable, and Kim, our producer, she doesn't want to do the show with just me. So I need to find a partner just for a few months, until Katie can come back. So, we put our heads together, and we thought of the perfect person.",
        "Teri: Who?",
        "Brad: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I wouldn't give up Liberty for anything -- anything in the whole world. But it's just I made a decision when I was a 16-year-old kid, and that was it. I was never gonna do anything special with my life.",
        "Jack: Honey, you don't have to do anything special to be who you are. You're an amazing woman.",
        "Janet: But I could have been way more amazing! And it's not like I think about it all the time, because, you know, what's the point? But after seeing Teresa, all the things that she's seen, the places she's been, my life feels so small. Not you, okay. Not you. Not you. I love you to pieces. But it seems like all I've ever done with my life is survive, and that's just not good enough anymore, and there's nothing I can do to change it.",
        "Jack: Honey, you can do anything you set your mind to. I've seen it.",
        "Janet: Little things maybe, but it's not like I went to college or culinary school.",
        "Jack: Hey, you should be teaching in culinary school.",
        "Janet: I love you. You're the best husband in the whole world. I got to get going.",
        "Jack: No, no. Hey. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no. Wait a second. You sure you're okay?",
        "Janet: I'm fine. My life is what it is. Nothing anyone can do about it.",
        "Jack: Maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: You want me to co-host a television show? Why?",
        "Brad: Are you kidding? You're perfect.",
        "Katie: It's not a done deal yet, though.",
        "Brad: Well, we still have to run the idea by our boss.",
        "Katie: But I think Kim's gonna love you.",
        "Brad: I mean, with your personality and your culinary skills, you're a lock. So, are you interested?",
        "Teri: Are you kidding? This is like a dream come true! When are we gonna start?",
        "Brad: Today. We already set up the meeting, and then Katie and I just have to pitch it to our boss.",
        "Teri: I can't.",
        "Brad: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Teri: I have to look after Parker and Sage for the summer. Rosanna really needs my help.",
        "Katie: This is a big opportunity. Why don't you talk to Rosanna? Maybe she'll understand.",
        "Teri: Maybe.",
        "Brad: All right. Do what you got to do, but here's the address of WOAK. Just be there in time for the meeting. Thanks for coming.",
        "Teri: Oh, hi, Jack. Bye, Jack.",
        "Jack: Was it something I said?",
        "Brad: You didn't say anything.",
        "Jack: Good point. How are you feeling, Katie?",
        "Katie: Fat.",
        "Brad: And gorgeous. So, what's up, bro?",
        "Jack: I need you to do me a favor.",
        "Brad: Okay. What?",
        "Jack: Give my wife a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: This coffee isn't very good. Let me get you a fresh pot.",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom.",
        "Janet: Hi. How was Anny's?",
        "Liberty: It was good. She talked in her sleep, which is very entertaining.",
        "Janet: Good. Can I get you some breakfast?",
        "Liberty: No. I've already ate. But we're gonna go to the lake, so I thought I'd swing by and see if you could make us some sandwiches.",
        "Janet: Oh, right. Not only do I have to sling hash for Henry and Vienna all day, but I'm also your personal chef.",
        "Liberty: What? You've done it plenty of times before.",
        "Janet: And you seem to always take it for granted.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. I did not think it was such a big deal.",
        "Janet: Everything is a big deal today, Liberty, okay? There you are. You're late. Come on, now, I've been slammed since I got here. I need you to bus those tables right there.",
        "Parker: Janet, I'm sorry. I can't work today.",
        "Janet: Oh, I did not hear that.",
        "Parker: I'm sorry. I have to take these stupid pictures for my mom's company, the vitamin-water thing. I'm supposed to be a model or something.",
        "Liberty: That sounds like so much fun.",
        "Parker: Not really. I mean, I guess. Look, I'm just doing my mom and Craig a favor. I'm really sorry. You remember.",
        "Janet: Yeah. I just didn't think it was gonna be today, and the least you could have done was call me so I could have gotten somebody to cover for you!",
        "Parker: Janet, I'm really sorry.",
        "Janet: Forget it. Just be quiet and get out of here before I change my mind. Go!",
        "Liberty: Okay. And I'm gonna go, too.",
        "Janet: No. Come here.",
        "Liberty: What? What? Mom!",
        "Janet: Put this on.",
        "Liberty: What? Anny's waiting for me!",
        "Janet: Call her and tell her you cannot do it. I need your help.",
        "Liberty: No, Mom. I'm sorry --",
        "Janet: Do not argue with me, Liberty! Not today!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So, what's up with Janet? Did Vienna fire her?",
        "Jack: No, nothing like that. She's just feeling down in the dumps since Teri showed up.",
        "Brad: I thought she was psyched about that.",
        "Jack: Well, she loves her sister, but she feels like she missed out by having Liberty so young.",
        "Brad: Missed out?",
        "Katie: Like, on college or a career?",
        "Jack: Exactly. Teri got to do a lot of things that Janet couldn't, and she doesn't resent Liberty. It's just that with Teri showing up after so many years, Janet can't help but think of all the things she could have done had things been different. She's feeling unappreciated.",
        "Brad: Are you kidding? We love Janet.",
        "Katie: She's amazing, and she makes you so happy.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Brad: And that is a tough job.",
        "Katie: True. I'm just kidding. No, but she raised such an amazing kid. She's great at everything she does. I mean, she's not a gourmet chef, but everything she makes is unbelievable.",
        "Brad: Remember that lasagna she made when she came on the show? She had the crew eating out of her hand.",
        "Katie: Yeah, you too, as I remember.",
        "Brad: It's the red sauce, Honey, but I always come back to you.",
        "Jack: No, no. She was great, right?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Jack: And that's what got me thinking she'd be perfect.",
        "Brad: Okay, so that's the job you're talking about? You want us to hire Janet to cook for us?",
        "Jack: No, Brad. I was hoping that Janet could fill in for Katie at \"Oakdale Now.\" Hey, you said she was great. If you give her a chance, you know she would be great.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. We just offered the job to Teri.",
        "Jack: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Katie: No, he's not.",
        "Jack: Isn't there any way you can take it back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I've got the notes, and I'm gonna stick the notes right in your you know what.",
        "Craig: Oh, and your purse.",
        "Teri: Hey, guys.",
        "Craig: Hi!",
        "Teri: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, actually we're just on our way to the location. You dropped off Sage at the community center, right?",
        "Teri: Yeah. A bunch of her friends are there, so she's really happy.",
        "Craig: Great. Wonderful. We have to go. Parker's gonna beat us there.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and don't forget to pick up Sage later this afternoon, right?",
        "Teri: Actually, Rosanna, I feel terrible. I can't.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean you can't? Why not?",
        "Teri: I got offered a job co-hosting \"Oakdale Now\" with Brad Snyder. It's a great opportunity. So many people are gonna get to see me cook.",
        "Rosanna: What about Sage?",
        "Teri: I know. It's just for today. I have to go down to the station, meet the producer, and if she likes me, it's a go.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, so you don't have the job yet.",
        "Craig: Oh, but she will. You don't have to be psychic. Look at her! She's cute, she's smart, she's a great cook. You're a shoe-in.",
        "Teri: Thanks. But it's not a full-time thing, so I can still do both.",
        "Craig: Ah, see? It's a win-win.",
        "Teri: Yeah, I think so. The kids are gonna be in school soon. I can cook. I can still do all the shopping. Hey, I promise I'll make it up to you.",
        "Craig: How do you like that? What?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, nothing. Nothing. It's just our promo campaign with Parker and the kids staying here at the house, and all of our hopes for the business just walked out the door on little high heels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Henry, what is wrong with you?",
        "Henry: Don't get any on your hands. You have no idea what's in it.",
        "Jay: I'm fine. I fixed it myself.",
        "Henry: Were you here when the pot was brought in?",
        "Jay: No.",
        "Henry: Have you ever tasted antifreeze before?",
        "Jay: Audrey, what's going on here? Your son, does he have some issues, or what?",
        "Henry: No, no. I am fine. My mother is the sociopath of the family.",
        "Audrey: My son thinks that I am a serial killer and you -- you are my next victim.",
        "Henry: You wouldn't be laughing if you were turning blue and convulsing on the floor!",
        "Jay: Just be careful. I might laugh myself into unconsciousness here.",
        "Audrey: No worries there. We do have a defibrillator in the lobby.",
        "Henry: I am trying to save your life here.",
        "Jay: Gee, thanks.",
        "Henry: You've got to understand. My mother is like a black widow, okay, and she lures her suitors into her web, and then she snuffs them out and sashays off to find new prey.",
        "Audrey: You sound positively diabolical.",
        "Henry: I have proof. I have proof.",
        "Jay: Really?",
        "Henry: Yes, I do.",
        "Audrey: This is ridiculous! This is ridiculous!",
        "Henry: I come from a long line of psychos, and my mother makes two. My little sister is in jail for murder, and you know what? I don't know why I don't just call the police and turn you in.",
        "Audrey: Why don't you do that?",
        "Henry: Because you're my mom, and because I don't know the other guys that you iced.",
        "Audrey: That is so very sweet. You really do love me, don't you? You do.",
        "Henry: Not enough to let you keep killing people under my nose, okay? No. It's over, Mom. You got to find another hobby.",
        "Jay: Hey, you said you had proof.",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. I do. I have newspaper clippings cross-referenced with her diary entries. If you'd like to see them, I will show you.",
        "Audrey: Good. That's a great idea. Why don't you take him and work with him? You know, work with him here. Prove that I'm a serial killer. I'll just wait right here.",
        "Henry: Please. Don't run away!",
        "Audrey: Don't worry. I never go on the lamb until after noon.",
        "Henry: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: For crying out loud. If things don't work, we'll just get another babysitter!",
        "Rosanna: I cannot get another babysitter. The whole reason this arrangement is acceptable to Jack is because Teri is Janet's sister! He's not gonna accept anybody else.",
        "Craig: We'll see.",
        "Rosanna: \"We'll see\"? Why don't we just see about today, right? You and I are both going to the photo shoot, so we can make sure that all of our bases are covered, right? And we don't really know how long that's going to take. So, who's going to pick up Sage at the community center?",
        "Craig: Call Jack.",
        "Rosanna: No, we cannot call Jack! If Jack finds out about this, he'll be over here in two seconds, padding up the kids and moving them back to the farm before dinnertime! We are not calling Jack Snyder! That's not an option!",
        "Craig: Would you calm down! Oh, my gosh! All right. How's this -- you go meet with Parker. I'll pick up Sage. Bases covered. You happy now?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Craig: Oh, I can live with that. Let's go.",
        "Rosanna: I hate you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Can't you back out of the deal with Teri? Come on! Things change all the time in television. Can't you tell her that it's not gonna work out?",
        "Katie: We already made an appointment with Kim. We don't want to look flaky.",
        "Jack: Right. Wouldn't want to do that now, would you? It's all right.",
        "Brad: I'm really sorry!",
        "Jack: I'm not just worried about Janet, okay? Teri's supposed to look after the kids while Carly's away, and Sage has grown pretty dependant on her. If Teri backs out now, it's gonna break her heart.",
        "Katie: Poor Sage. I feel so bad. She's having such a terrible summer.",
        "Brad: Yeah. It's been a pretty bad one for us, too.",
        "Jack: And I hate to uproot the kids, but Rosanna, she just can't watch them on her own. She can't. I'll move them in with me. It's no big deal.",
        "Brad: You know what? Don't do that. Look, I'll explain the situation to Teri. I'm sure she'll understand.",
        "Jack: Okay. The thing is, Brad, Janet can't find out about this. If she found out I was here, she'd be mortified.",
        "Brad: My lips are sealed.",
        "Jack: Yes, and she can't find out about Teri either, 'cause if she thought that she was a second choice, she wouldn't agree to any of it.",
        "Katie: No, we would never do that, Jack, and she wasn't our second choice. We just didn't think of her first.",
        "Jack: Don't get me wrong. She loves her sister. But having Teri back just dredges up just old feelings, you know? If she had something of hers, something to be proud of, it would just make her feel so much better.",
        "Brad: Can I tell Teri this so she doesn't spill the beans?",
        "Jack: I wish you didn't have to, but I guess there's no other way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: It's just not fair! I have three weeks left of summer, and then I start classes, and I have college applications.",
