        "Katie promised Mike she would be at the christening, though she told Alison she intended to duck out early to go to Australia alone. At the country club, Bonnie insisted that Sarah apologize to her manager for pouring water on Marshall. Her manager said she could have her job back if she apologized to Marshall. Marshall accepted the apology after having a talk with Sarah. Hal hired Walker to help him with the murder investigation. Craig told Paul to vacate the penthouse, but Paul said that after all that Craig has done to his family, he won't do anything for him. Craig said Paul had met his match. Barbara horned in on Jen's date with Andre, just as Paul had planned. She told Andre she would pay him to leave town and stay away from Jen. Tension was in the air at the christening, as Lucy and Aaron argued about their future, and tempers flared over Dusty's presence. Aaron said he wanted his own future, which angered Lucy until he clarified that he wanted a future she could be proud of. Lily, Holden, Rosanna, and Jack wanted Dusty to go, but he said he would only go if Rose wanted him to. Carly said he could stay, and Jack finally agreed. Katie slipped out just after the ceremony, leaving behind a picture of Mike, Sage, and herself."

        "Rose: Sorry I'm late. Carly, Jack, I hope you don't mind, I brought a friend.",
        "Lily: If you have your heart set on pushing me, there are better places to do it than a christening.",
        "Rose: There are better places to pick a fight, too.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me, would you mind keeping your voice down, please?",
        "Lily: You're not playing fair.",
        "Rose: I'm not playing at all.",
        "Carly: Uh -- Dusty, you can stay.",
        "Holden: No, he cannot stay!",
        "Carly: Holden, this is my child's christening, all right?",
        "Jack: She's mine, too. I'm with -- I'm with Holden. Dusty goes.",
        "Carly: Excuse me. Can we have a talk, please?",
        "Lily: You know, everybody is getting involved. You know, this is between you and me. Let's go.",
        "Rose: You go ahead. Grab a seat, ringside. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Katie! The christening -- I gotta be there early.",
        "Katie: I know. I'm almost ready.",
        "Mike: You're in your bathrobe.",
        "Katie: Well, I was up until 3:00 in the morning trying to fit four weeks of clothing into three very small suitcases. Actually, why don't you go ahead? And I'll meet you there.",
        "Mike: You're gonna ditch me and go to Australia alone, aren't you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, while you're off being a godfather, I'm going to be 30,000 feet up in the air eating stale pretzels and drinking warm soda. I told you I was gonna be there, and I will. Okay? I promise.",
        "Mike: If you don't show up, little Sage won't have a godfather. I'll hunt you down like a dog.",
        "Katie: I will be there. That was close.",
        "Alison: Yeah. But you lie even better than I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: Will this do?",
        "Andre: Darling?",
        "Jennifer: This is fine, Andr\u00e9.",
        "Andre: I know. I have lost the right to call you \"darling.\" And I have to earn back your trust. And I will.",
        "Waiter: Your daughter and her escort have arrived, Ms. Ryan. Shall I tell them you're here?",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. That won't be necessary. I'll make my presence known when the time is right. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Since this misunderstanding is partially my fault, I will partially pay for your moving expenses.",
        "Paul: You know what you sound like, right?",
        "Craig: Please tell me.",
        "Paul: You sound like a guy who is in trouble with his wife. Did you lease this apartment without telling Rosanna about it? Because that would be stupid.",
        "Craig: I will also hire someone to help you find a new apartment. And give you 48 hours to vacate. And that's generous.",
        "Paul: And that's -- the door. You can shut it on the way out.",
        "Craig: All right. Make me a counteroffer.",
        "Paul: A counteroffer? Okay, okay -- [Paul sighs] Okay, let's see, a counteroffer. Here's one. Why don't you go to hell?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Bonnie, please don't make me do this.",
        "Bonnie: You're the one who poured water on a customer's lap.",
        "Sarah: So I got myself fired. I had to do something. I hated working here.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you may have hated working here, but I'm sure the manager probably likes his job. And you, my sweetness, made him look bad. And that you owe him an apology. So? Girl come on. I know you know the right thing to do. Just go do it now. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Walker : Bonnie? It's Walker . Listen, those DNA results on Marshall Travers, they'll be in a few hours.",
        "Bonnie: And then I'll know?",
        "Walker : Yeah. Listen, I got to tell you again, if Sarah turns out to be the man's child, you have to tell him.",
        "Bonnie: I've got to go. He just walked in. Good bye. What?",
        "Marshall : You have something that belongs to me. And I want it back.",

        "[Jennifer laughs]",
        "Andre: I really have missed you, darling.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you do know how to e-mail, Andr\u00e9.",
        "Andre: But I do not know how to show you what is in my heart. For a long time, I did not try to reach you because -- I'm ashamed, Jennifer. I treated you so badly.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, you did.",
        "Andre: Until I heard from your brother, I never dreamed I had a chance. I adore you. I want to make up for all the hurt that I have caused you.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's going to take a lot more than a nice lunch at the Lakeview.",
        "Andre: I was thinking of dinner at a certain little cafe on the Champs Elysee.",
        "Jennifer: You expect me to go back to Paris with you?",
        "Barbara: I'm sure he expects no such thing.",
        "Andre: And this beautiful lady is -- ?",
        "Barbara: Barbara Ryan. Jennifer's mother.",
        "Jennifer: Who shouldn't even be here.",
        "Barbara: I didn't even know you were lunching at the Lakeview, darling.",
        "Andre: My name is Andr\u00e9 Perin. Won't you join us?",
        "Jennifer: I'm sure my mother has other plans.",
        "Barbara: Actually I'm free -- all afternoon.",
        "Andre: Then I insist.",
        "Barbara: Well, how very kind of you. I hate to intrude.",
        "Andre: Oh, it is not an intrusion. It is an honor to meet you. I have always wanted to know Jennifer's family.",
        "Barbara: Oh, and I'd love to know all about you. Tell me, Andr\u00e9, about yourself. Every little thing.",
        "[Barbara chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Working? Have you got a couple of minutes? I'd like to ask you some questions. The killings at Memorial.",
        "Walker : Well, I thought the party line on that was the serial killer's dead.",
        "Hal: I'm not convinced.",
        "Walker : Go on.",
        "Hal: Do you still think that Rick Decker is connected in any way?",
        "Walker : Well, I only have theories, Hal. You want facts.",
        "Hal: Right now, the only facts I have are the ones that keep me awake at night. Like the fact that my mother-in-law is now married to Decker. If there's any possibility that he's the killer, my family's in danger.",
        "Walker : What do you want?",
        "Hal: I want your professional opinion.",
        "Walker : All right. I think Rick Decker murdered those people. But that's only instinct. I don't have proof.",
        "Hal: Would you be willing to help me find some?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I did not lie to Mike. I just omitted a few facts.",
        "Alison: Like?",
        "Katie: Telling him that I'm sneaking out of the christening to catch an earlier flight.",
        "Alison: Well, that's kind of a big thing to omit.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. So, you gonna drive me to the airport?",
        "Alison: If you answer one question -- Katie, are you crazy? You're just gonna ditch a hot guy like Mike Kasnoff for a husband who left you? Katie, I know that he supposedly had good reasons yet Mike will hold your hand the whole way there. Do you even know how long a flight to Australia is? Anything could happen.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. Which is exactly why this is for the best?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why don't you just tell me that you want to buy you out of this lease?",
        "Paul: Yeah, but, you know, it's -- it's hard for me to put a price on it, because I have it and you want it. And that gives it a value far greater than cash.",
        "Craig: We all want something, Paul. What do you want? Power? Revenge?",
        "Paul: You know, I was hoping in this case that they would go hand in hand.",
        "Craig: Me? What did I do to you?",
        "Paul: What did you do? You came to Oakdale. You seduced my mother. You took her away from a good, decent, solid guy. You embezzled money from our business, and then when my mother was gonna call the police, all of a sudden she almost gets burned to death in a fire.",
        "Craig: I had nothing to do with that.",
        "Paul: You set all of that in motion, Montgomery . You decimated my sister's home. You made it so my little brother, Will, almost didn't have a childhood. A million family moments -- Christmases, birthdays, thanksgiving dinner -- all of those family moments are lost to me. So you want me to make you a counteroffer? I'll tell you what -- you destroy your livelihood, maim someone you love, wreck Lucy's life and then give me a call. 'Cause then, maybe then, I'll give Rosanna back her penthouse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What was all that about?",
        "Aaron: That Dusty Donovan guy hangs out with crooks. I don't think Holden and Lily want him around the family.",
        "Rosanna: Ah. [Sage cries] Oh. Do you want to give her, her bottle?",
        "Lucy: Um, you know, I'm just gonna stay and wait for my dad. He said he's coming here, right?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. Yes, he is. Would you come and find me when he does show up?",
        "Lucy: Sure",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thank you. Oh.",
        "Aaron: You know, I don't blame the kid. It's so intense in here.",
        "Lucy: Yes, it is. Extremely",
        "Aaron: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Why are you trying to get rid of me? Why do you want me to go to school so far away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily and Rose are close. You know that you're causing this rift between them, but yet you still keep on pushing. You're dragging her away from her family.",
        "Dusty: I'm not dragging her away from anyone. She makes her own decisions. She's an adult. You guys treat her like a teenager.",
        "Holden: That's 'cause we're trying to protect her from you. If you really cared about her, really cared about her, you would get out of her life.",
        "Emma: Hey, hey, hey. Come on. This is supposed to be a christening. Lily and Rose are outside fighting, and the two of you are in here doing the same. What's going on?",
        "Dusty: Nothing. We were just, you know -- we were just talking.",
        "Holden: Mama, come on. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: You know, Lily, you're one of the people until you don't get your way. Don't you have enough lives to run without running mine?",
        "Lily: I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.",
        "Rose: You're the one hurting me. Now, you know how much I love Luke, Faith and Natalie. And then I don't do what you want, and you tell me that I can't see them.",
        "Lily: I don't want your boyfriend near them.",
        "Rose: I get it. I get why you don't want him in your house. Like you said, I don't like it, it's your property. But when did you buy this church? You know, maybe I should just move to another state.",
        "Lily: I couldn't stand it if you left.",
        "Rose: Then stop controlling me.",
        "Lily: I'm just trying to knock some sense into you. Dusty worked for the man that kidnapped us.",
        "Rose: And he worked just as hard as Holden to help find us. Lily, Dusty has more than made up for his mistakes, so why can't you just let it go?",
        "Lily: You know why? Because Faith is still having nightmares, waking up, hoping that her mommy is still there. Or trying to force Luke outside to play, because he's afraid if he comes back in, I won't be there anymore. They're not over it, Rose.",
        "Rose: Well, then you -- you help them get over it, and just leave me out of it, okay? Because I am going to keep seeing Dusty, no matter what you say.",
        "Lily: You're going to sacrifice your family because you can't stand not having a man in your bed? I'm sorry, Rose.",
        "Rose: Why? For saying that I'd give up my family for sex? Don't mention it.",
        "Lily: What I meant -- I meant --",
        "Rose: I knew, eventually, if we kept getting into this, one of us would hit below the belt. I just - figured it would be me.",
        "Lily: I'm just trying to say that you're sacrificing your family -- your family -- for something that is -- it's not gonna last. He's just an infatuation.",
        "Rose: Infatuation -- no. I love Dusty. The same way you love Holden.",
        "Lily: And I love you, Rose.",
        "Rose: Isn't that love supposed to be unconditional? Lily? Lately all you've been is conditions. I mean, do you want me to move out of Cal 's?",
        "Lily: No! No, of course not! No, that's your home.",
        "Rose: No, see, it's not my home. No, it's just a cottage right in your back door. A home shouldn't have strings attached. \"You can live here if -- you can be part of the family if --\" I mean, what if Dusty wants to sleep over?",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: I don't know. Look, this doesn't have to change everything.",
        "Rose: Well, of course, it does! Lil, I mean, you want me to work on that charity thing with you? I want Dusty to be there with me. What about that? You gonna put the kibosh on that, too?",
        "Lily: No, I want you to work on the benefit. I want you to live at Cal 's. I want you around the children. What I don't want is Dusty!",
        "Rose: Where he goes, I go.",
        "Lily: Just keep him away from my house.",
        "Rose: Don't worry. You won't see him there, and you won't see me there, either.",
        "Dusty: Hey, you okay?",
        "Rose: Never better.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe we should -- maybe we should --",
        "Lily: Where's my sister?",
        "Dusty: I think she's crying in the bathroom. You don't like me. That's okay. Don't take it out on your sister.",
        "Holden: How'd it go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Lucy, I don't want to get rid of you. Why would I want to do that? Look, I'm just trying to stay out of your way.",
        "Lucy: What if I don't want you to?",
        "Aaron: I have to do it anyway. Lucy, you are an amazing person. I mean, you're beautiful. You're smart. And if you end up going to Oakdale University because of me --",
        "Lucy: I don't want to leave you, I can't leave you.",
        "Aaron: Yes, but you can't choose me over school, either. Don't you see that?",
        "Lucy: I know, but -- what if you moved with me? I mean, that way, wherever I end up, we'd be together. And you could work, while I studied. And you could work at a garage. I'm sure they'll hire you.",
        "Aaron: Lucy, no, Lucy. Come on. Look, you know I want to be with you. But I also have to have my own life.",
        "Lucy: Your own life?! What about our life?!",
        "Aaron: No. No, Lu - Luce! Luce?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hey.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Molly: From what I remembered, church was never so dangerous.",
        "Mike: I'm glad you showed up. You saved me a thank you note.",
        "Molly: And you're thanking me for --?",
        "Mike: Nagging Carly. She told me that you're the reason that I'm Sage's godfather. It was very nice of you. Especially since --",
        "Molly: You and I aren't together anymore.",
        "Mike: And that it was a tough breakup. Things have changed a lot since we met.",
        "Molly: Yeah, but one thing's still the same -- I just want you to be happy.",
        "Mike: That's funny, that's what I want for you, too.",
        "Molly: So where's Katie?",
        "Mike: I don't know, but she better be on her way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why is ditching Mike for the best? I mean, I know that you have to find Simon now --",
        "Katie: Of course I have to find him. Alison, you don't know the whole story. But he risked his life to protect me.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you also had to walk around with a broken heart for, like, months, Katie. He made you feel like he didn't love you anymore.",
        "Katie: Yeah, because there was no other choice. He had to make me feel like we were over to keep me safe. That's how much he loves me.",
        "Alison: You're right. And that is pretty romantic. Okay. I'll do whatever you want. Anything to help you get your husband back.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, you can start by taking me to the airport without Mike. I mean, I know he's been a great friend, but I just don't want to hurt him. And besides, letting Mike fly halfway across the world to bring me to my husband is just wrong.",
        "Alison: He will follow you, though.",
        "Katie: I hope not. Because by the time Mike gets to Australia , Simon and I will be long gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have anything of yours.",
        "Marshall : My toothbrush. You stole it, and I want it back.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, yeah. My mother told me about that little fit of paranoia you threw. You know, you should really see someone about that.",
        "Marshall : Why'd you take it, Bonnie? You came into my room that night for a reason. I'm gonna figure out what it is. And when I do, you're gonna be sorry.",
        "Isaac: What's going on?",
        "Marshall : Bonnie was just telling me how good the crab cakes are. She thought I might enjoy them for lunch.",
        "Bonnie: Don't forget to brush afterwards. And floss, too, while you're at it.",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Isaac: Good to see that you two are getting along.",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Sarah: Hi. I did it. I apologized, and I got my job back.",
        "Bonnie: You -- Sarah, that's wonderful.",
        "Isaac: When do you start?",
        "Sarah: I just have to do one little thing, and then the manager will put me on -- back on the schedule.",
        "Bonnie: Cool. So what is it you...",
        "Sarah: I have to apologize to the man that I poured water on. And there he is. This must be my lucky day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Whining isn't gonna do us any good, Paul.",
        "Paul: I'm not whining. I'm taking action. Better late than never.",
        "Craig: Right. Good Lord, don't try to play little party boy games with me. [Paul scoffs] You're not gonna fix anything by trying to hold on to a piece of real estate that doesn't belong to you.",
        "Paul: No, but it does, you see, because you gave it to me.",
        "Craig: Grow up.",
        "Paul: You know, that's funny. Coming from a guy who's spent his entire adult life living off of rich women.",
        "Craig: Well, we can't all fall for low-rent Jersey girls, can we, Paul? Rose, for example, she was a stripper?",
        "Paul: Rose was a dancer.",
        "Craig: Must have been interesting to date a girl who took her clothes off for men.",
        "Paul: You shut up about Rose.",
        "Craig: But if she hadn't discovered what kind of a man you are, she might still be taking 'em off for you, huh? Instead, Dusty Donovan is getting the peep show.",
        "Paul: Shut up about her. Shut up about Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You want Rose D'Angelo back so bad, you can taste it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Come to my office this afternoon. I'm going to pay you to leave Jennifer and this town forever. And if you breathe a word of this conversation to my daughter, I will deny it and make your life a living hell. Am I clear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Everybody wants something, don't they, Paul? And you want Rose D'Angelo back so bad, you can taste it.",
        "Paul: Just get out.",
        "Craig: You crossed the wrong line here, Paul. And you know what's on the other side? Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker : Decker was flat-lining in college?",
        "Hal: Right. Did you get to the part where it names the drug he used?",
        "Walker : Potassium chloride. Our serial killer's drug of choice.",
        "Hal: This can't be a coincidence.",
        "Walker : No way. So, let's put this together here. Decker starts in college, injecting himself for kicks.",
        "Hal: Right.",
        "Walker : Dying for kicks. His friends bring him back each time. It's a total power trip kind of thing. Then he graduates. He has to be respectable.But he misses the rush.",
        "Hal: So, he starts injecting his patients, knowing that he could bring them back but choosing not to.",
        "Walker : It's not the same. But it might be just as good. He knows what they're experiencing. And now he gets to play God.",
        "Hal: Right. But when he feels like we're closing in, he has to revert to his old ways. So he turns the needle back on himself, and he flat-lines that night in Bob's office.",
        "Walker : I brought him back. I was the one who brought him back. If I hadn't, Dr. Gordon would probably still be alive.",
        "Hal: Don't blame yourself. You couldn't possibly have known.",
        "Walker : Where did you get this stuff?",
        "Hal: It's a printout of some notes a reporter made, a guy named Jeffery Starr, works for a tabloid. Starr dug this stuff up and came to town looking for Dr. Decker.",
        "Walker : To do an expose?",
        "Hal: Right.",
        "Walker : Oh, wow. Dr. Decker must be going out of his mind. When's it gonna hit the papers?",
        "Hal: It won't. Jeffery Starr disappeared.",
        "Walker : You think Decker killed him, too?",
        "Hal: I do. But that's just instinct, not fact. You see, Rick played everybody, including me. You are the only one who saw through him.",
        "Walker : What do you want me to do?",
        "Hal: I want you to stay in town and help me nail him.",
        "Walker : Well, that might be hard. Dr. Dixon terminated my contract. As far as he's concerned, my work at Memorial is over.",
        "Hal: I don't want you to work for Memorial. I want you to work for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Sarah, wait. You do not have to apologize to Marshall Travers.",

        "Bonnie: Not if it means she has to deal with scum.",

        "Sarah: Will you come with me?",
        "Isaac: No, Sarah, you're gonna do this on your own. Now go. If you do not let that girl be wrong on her own, she has no hope of being honest.",

        "Jack: You want Rose at Sage's christening, and Rose wants Dusty, so be it.",
        "Carly: What's the catch?",
        "Jack: That you and I get to enjoy every second of today. Like you said, it's not just our daughter being christened, it's our whole family.",
        "Carly: Well, Lily and Holden might not want to stay, you know, if he -- if he does.",
        "Jack: The only people I have to have here are you, me, Sage and a couple of happy godparents. That's all that matters.",

        "Walker : No problem.",
        "Hal: Next thing, if Starr's body is ever found, I want you in on the autopsy. If there's any connection between Starr's death and the homicides at Memorial, I want to know ASAP.",
