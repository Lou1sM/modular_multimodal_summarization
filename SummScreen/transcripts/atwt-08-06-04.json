        "Rosanna: Paul, I can explain.",
        "Paul: No, I don't -- I don't want to here your explanations. Get up. Come on. Let's get this over with.",
        "Rosanna: Don't. Come on, don't.",
        "Jordan: You cheap son of a --",
        "Paul: This is your night for stupid moves. Make another one. I'm right here. Come on.",

        "Aaron: Ali? You crying? Look, if this is because of that meeting with the minister went bad --",
        "Alison: That was fine. That was fine.",
        "Aaron: Oh, so you're still getting married. Great. What's wrong? Why the tears, huh?",
        "Alison: Chris and I had a fight.",
        "Aaron: Another fight? Over what?",
        "Alison: Lobster or salmon or tuna. He stormed out, and he left me here with all this.",
        "Aaron: Alison, honey --",
        "Alison: It's just premarital tension. Everybody says that that's normal.",
        "Aaron: So you're telling me, all across America, at any given moment, there are brides and grooms-to-be, arguing day after day, putting their engagements in jeopardy? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Alison: Not if they're lucky enough to have a sister like Emily. She's after Chris right now, and she's gonna fix everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: How did everything get so out of control?",
        "Emily: How do you mean?",
        "Chris: Ever since Ali and I got engaged, nothing's gone right. Okay? We can't agree on anything, and instead of fighting, I just let her have her own way.",
        "Emily: Well, that's a bad idea.",
        "Chris: She's scared of my mother, my mother hates your mother --",
        "Emily: My mother hates your mother.",
        "Chris: Choosing the menu is a life-or-death decision. This is supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, and Alison's so busy trying to plan the perfect wedding, it's making both of us miserable. Okay? And then I escaped over here to pick out a cake, and that's not even right.",
        "Emily: Okay, so we'll find another bakery.",
        "Chris: No, no, no. It's not about that, Emily. I don't know if I can go through with this.",

        "Lucinda: What were you thinking? Dear, what were you thinking, allowing Alan to make the ransom drop all by himself?",
        "Sierra: The kidnapper insisted.",
        "Lucinda: But darling, you should have contacted the police.",
        "Sierra: He said if we went to the police that Lucy would die.",
        "Lucinda: That's a lot of money just to be throwing around.",
        "Sierra: The only thing that matters is getting Lucy home safe and unharmed.",
        "Lucinda: I am aware of that, my darling, but how do you know that the kidnapper will release her when he's got the money?",
        "Sierra: He said to follow his plan, and that's what we're doing. And if we just stick to the plan then she will come home safe.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I wish -- I just wish -- I mean, couldn't you have briefed me before any of this happened?",
        "Sierra: We knew that you'd behave like this.",
        "Lucinda: I hope you're not making some ghastly mistake.",
        "Sierra: Thanks for the vote of confidence.",
        "Lucinda: And who else was in on this plan, please? Was Lily in on it? Where the hell is Lily?",

        "Alison: \"Sea scallops on sea salt ensconced in a sea shell topped with beluga caviar.\"",
        "Aaron: Mm. And this? Oh, killer!",
        "Alison: That's the \"bison carpaccio on crostini with black truffle.\"",
        "Aaron: Love it.",
        "Alison: See, you should be the one helping me choose my menu. It's supposed to be fun. Like this. Chris acted like he didn't care what we ate. I wonder if he's cooled off. Do you think it's too soon?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Okay, maybe you're right. I'll call Emily.",
        "Aaron: Ali, Emily's been gone, like, 10, 20 minutes? Give her some time, okay? Talking sense to that guy is not as easy as you think. Trust me.",
        "Alison: Be nice.",
        "Aaron: I am being nice.",
        "Alison: So why did you track me down? So you could just drive me nuts?",
        "Aaron: No. The next clue to the \"keys to the kingdom\" contest is tomorrow.",
        "Alison: Oh, that's great.",
        "Aaron: No, that bites. Because remember that Kevin kid? That dork, you know, with all the keys already? He needs one more and he's gonna win.",
        "Alison: Okay, this is not making me feel any better.",
        "Aaron: Ali, this is supposed to remind you that there's more to life than carpaccio and tuna truffle and angry fianc\u00e9s.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Aaron: How? I'll tell you how. Tomorrow, we go at the City Times loading dock, all right? Get the paper right away, get a jump on Kevin. If we work on this hard and fast, we'll find that key before Kevin even gets a hand on the paper. What do you say, partner?",
        "Alison: Right after I get an update from Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: It's called cold feet. I've seen it a hundred times.",
        "Chris: This is supposed to be the best time of our lives.",
        "Emily: Okay, that is the biggest lie in the book. Oh, man. They make all these engagement ring ads and these five-tier wedding cakes, they make them look so pretty and enticing, and they tell you a bunch fairy tales, because if anybody told you the truth, nobody would be walking down the aisle. Nobody. I hate to be the one to tell you, but it's never a lot of fun.",
        "Chris: That's encouraging.",
        "Emily: You know, to tell you the truth, you can plan all you want, but things are gonna turn out the way they turn out. I mean, look at my wedding to Hal. It that was an intimate, sophisticated, carnival of horrors. An -- Alison shows up, remember, blasting that rock music, dressed in fishnets and proceeds to dance like a two-dollar stripper in front of your mother, and then, of course, chased after Aaron.",
        "Chris: That sounds familiar.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Oh, and then Barbara shows up, takes away my 12-year-old best man. Did I tell you I never got a honeymoon? See, the path to true love is rarely straight or smooth, but we did it. We said our vows and became husband and wife.",
        "Chris: And lived happily ever after.",
        "Emily: Yeah, something like that.",

        "Rosanna: This should help keep the swelling down.",
        "Paul: Thanks. What about me?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Will your head fit in this?",
        "Paul: You're angry at me? You're mad at me? You're making out with this guy, and I'm just supposed to be okay with that?",
        "Rosanna: I wish I could make you understand.",
        "Paul: Yeah, make me understand, please. Please, make me understand. All the plotting and scheming so that you could get me and Jennifer out of town so you could, what? What? Seduce my brother? You know, she set this whole thing up. You know that, right?",
        "Jordan: Yes, I do, and I understand why.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. I wish you didn't have to find out this way.",
        "Paul: Find out what?",
        "Rosanna: Jordan and I have decided to make a go of our marriage. For Cabot's sake.",
        "Paul: We've discussed all of this, all of us -- we've all discussed this.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan is my husband, and we both want the same things.",
        "Paul: Great, all of a sudden you decided that the thing you want most is each other? That's just great. That's perfect. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. What about my sister? You remember Jennifer, Casanova?",
        "Rosanna: Jordan is gonna explain to Jennifer that they can't be together anymore.",
        "Jordan: Look, Paul, I realize that this is abrupt and that you're disappointed, but we're doing what we have to do as parents, and I don't think you understand that.",
        "Paul: No, I don't understand that. This stinks. And this little tap-dance thing that you two are doing right now, I don't buy it. Not even a little bit.",
        "Rosanna: I can't do this.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, we agreed.",
        "Rosanna: Not this way. No, he doesn't believe us. It won't work. We have to tell him the truth.",

        "Nikki: How do you feel, Lucy?",
        "Dusty: Relax, its okay. You're gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay to cry. Be a tough girl, though. Don't cry too much. All right? Did you call for help?",

        "Paul: For whom?",
        "Rosanna: For Cabot.",
        "Paul: Oh, right, yeah, no, it's definitely the right thing to do with a kid, to have his parents follow the ravings of some lunatic madman in a federal penitentiary.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: You can't do this, Rosanna. You need to stop, now, before it gets any worse.",

        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Hal: We're having one blown up to hang in the corridor outside the squad room. That way, everybody who comes in will see Jack, and they'll think about the sacrifices he made, and he'll live on in our hearts forever. We'll keep him alive by remembering him.",
        "Margo: We know that Jack would want you to have this. We found it at the site.",

Something always made us back together because that's where we belonged. You were my true north, my home, my life. You promised me forever, Jack! This isn't fair. I wasn't finished with you. I had so many plans. Parker -- you're his hero, you know. He's so busy taking care of me, making sure I'm all right, just like you would do. And Sage -- I'll make sure she knows what a good man her daddy was. And how much he loved her. You will always be a part of me, g-man. I'll see you in Sage's eyes and Parker's big heart. He searched for you, you know. When you left us, he went into the pond. His heart stopped beating. And he described a place that sounded like heaven, and he said he saw you there, Jack -- you and Nora. He said you weren't leaving us. And I believed him for so long. I did. But now they tell me I have to say goodbye. How can I say goodbye to you? I can't. I won't. Maybe someday I will learn to live without you. But I will never stop loving you. Never.",
