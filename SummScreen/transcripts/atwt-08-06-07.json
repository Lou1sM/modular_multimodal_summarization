        "Barbara: Thank you, thank you. Everything all right? I mean, the baby and everything?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm fine. The baby's fine. Ah, do you want any coffee? Ah, actually if you want it, you're going to have to make it yourself. And you're probably going to have to drink it outside, because the smell of it makes me really nauseous, but you can help yourself out if you want.",
        "Barbara: Did you and Will have a fight? Everything okay, honey?",
        "Gwen: I'm not going to cry. I said I wasn't going to cry, pregnant women always cry because of hormones. So I'm not going to do it.",
        "Will: Hi. Mom, you're back.",
        "Barbara: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Barbara: Yeah.",
        "Will: What's going on? What's wrong?",
        "Gwen: You. You're worried about me and the baby all the time, and I want you to stop it. And your mom is going to talk to you about it, and you're gonna listen.",
        "Barbara: And I have some good news.",
        "Will: I think I have the right to be concerned about my pregnant wife. Don't you think?",
        "Gwen: Yes, you can be concerned, but you're not sleeping, and I'm worried about you.",
        "Barbara: I've got some really good news --",
        "Will: You really shouldn't be working yourself up like this. Okay?",
        "Gwen: But I love you, and I can't help it. And I know that you're really sad about Paul.",
        "Barbara: If you'd listen to me --",
        "Will: Mom, can you let us talk for just, like, a minute?",
        "Barbara: You guys! Paul is alive.",

        "Swiss nurse: Are you here to see one of our doctors?",

        "Swiss nurse: No one but family is allowed to see Miss Cabot.",
        "Paul: I'm her husband. My name's Craig Montgomery. I looked for her in Room 23, but she's wasn't there, and I --",
        "Swiss nurse: Oh, Mr. Montgomery, I do apologize. We're doing some renovation, so we moved her to a different room. You must have been frantic.",
        "Paul: Maybe I could just see her now.",
        "Swiss nurse: Right this way. Oh, her doctor will be back soon. I assume you want to speak with him right away.",
        "Paul: Maybe I could just spend a few minutes alone with her. How is she?",
        "Swiss nurse: Have a look yourself. Rosanna, good news, you have a surprise visitor. Your husband is here to see --",
        "Paul: Oh, you know what, I'll -- I'll take it from here, if you don't mind.",
        "Swiss nurse: Of course, Mr. Montgomery. Stay as long as you like.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, it's me, Paul. It's not Craig, you don't need to worry. I just lied to the nurse, so that I could see you. Ever since I had that vision of you, you've been on my mind. You came to me to give me a message. And so now I'm here to help you. To give you a message. It's time for you to wake up.",

        "Craig: And greetings to you too. I take it it is not a very happy day in your neighborhood.",
        "Meg: I'm busy. What do you want, Craig?",
        "Craig: Busy doing what? I thought you were going to take the day off from your ceo studies to relax.",
        "Meg: Then why are you calling and interrupting me?",
        "Craig: The business of your business. Are you still planning on coming to the meeting today?",
        "Meg: Ah, yeah.",
        "Craig: Is that why you're so tense?",
        "Meg: No!",
        "Craig: Well then, what is it?",
        "Meg: I made a pie. Don't laugh, don't you dare laugh at me, Craig.",
        "Craig: What kind of pie?",
        "Meg: None of your business.",
        "Craig: Why pie?",
        "Meg: Everybody was so worried about J.J. I thought it would be nice.",
        "Craig: Nice to subject your loved ones to your cooking?",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? I can do this. Okay, I have a cook book that any idiot could follow.",
        "Craig: Meg, you are capable of many wonderful things. But unfortunately, pie- making is not one of them.",
        "Meg: It can be. And it will be.",
        "Craig: You want a pie? Buy a pie, buy 10,000 pies. You're a mogul. Meg?",
        "Meg: Okay. All right, all right.",

        "Silas: Say it.",
        "J.J.: That's not my name.",
        "Silas: It is now. Say it. Jacob Jenkins.",
        "J.J.: No! I'm J.J. I'm J.J. Larrabee Snyder and I want to see my mom and dad.",
        "Silas: You better watch your tone with me, boy. And you need to face facts. You know those folks you live with down in Oakdale? You need to forget about them, 'cause they don't know where you are and they're never gonna find ya. And Ava here is your new mom, just like I'm your new dad, got it? Now I've got a friend that runs the bar here. She's gonna come here and talk to us real soon, and you're gonna behave yourself.",
        "Ava: He better.",
        "J.J.: You're not going to hurt me. You want me to be your son.",
        "Silas: And if you don't -- well, I can always make a trip to that little farm house in Illinois whenever I want and hurt whoever I want. Right? So what are you gonna do now?",
        "J.J.: Whatever you say -- until my dad gets here.",
        "Silas: Kid, that's never gonna happen.",

        "Bartender: What kind?",
        "Jack: Whatever you got on tap.",
        "Bartender: Tap's out.",
        "Jack: I'll take whatever you have in a bottle then.",
        "Bartender: All out.",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to be sociable, I'm not from around here. I heard this is where the action is.",
        "Bartender: You want action?",
        "Jack: Well that depends -- what kind you got?",
        "Bartender: No kind at all. We got nothing here for outsiders.",
        "Jack: Not even some honest work?",
        "Bartender: Not in August. In August, there's no work, no skiing, and no strangers who just happen to be passing through.",
        "Man: We used to get strangers, Kit. Remember?",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Kit: Yeah. Various law-enforcement types who just turn up, poke around.",
        "Jack: But that doesn't happen anymore?",
        "Kit: We don't like outsiders here. But we hate cops. Every time one turned up, he just kind of disappeared.",
        "Jack: I guess those cops knew when to leave.",
        "Kit: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Thanks for your hospitality. I'll be going.",
        "Kit: Uh, before you leave, why don't you tell us again why you're in town?",
        "Carly: He's running -- from me. That's for cheating on me. That's for thinking you could get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Paul is alive?",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: He said he'd never do this to us again -- make us believe that he was lost when he was really fine.",
        "Barbara: No, no it wasn't like that at all. He survived the fall. He was injured, seriously injured. In fact, he was in a coma. They identified him through his fingerprints and they contacted me.",
        "Will: So this trip you took --",
        "Barbara: Yes. I called you, I was going to tell you, but you were so excited about the baby, and frankly, I just didn't know what I was going to be facing when I got there. I didn't know if I was going to be -- identifying his body.",
        "Gwen: You didn't have to face that alone. We're family.",
        "Barbara: Thanks for saying that.",
        "Will: So what's the plan? What's next? Are you going to have him transferred here so we can take care of him?",
        "Barbara: Well, actually it's moved beyond that. He regained consciousness while I was there.",
        "Gwen: That's amazing.",
        "Barbara: It is a miracle. In fact, he's already been released from the hospital.",
        "Will: So he's here? He's in town?",
        "Barbara: He didn't come back with me.",
        "Will: You just said he was okay.",
        "Barbara: He is. And believe me, I want him back here as much as you do.",
        "Will: Well then, where is he? Doesn't he understand what we've just been through?",
        "Barbara: Please don't be hard on him --",
        "Will: Mom --",
        "Barbara: Will --",
        "Will: I don't get it. Why wouldn't he want to see us? Or does he not give a damn about me, you and Gwen and all the people that care about him?",
        "Gwen: And Meg. Does she even know?",
        "Barbara: You know, Paul didn't want anyone to know except the three of us. He said I could tell you, but you're not to tell anybody else.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: He doesn't even want Meg to know?",
        "Barbara: I know, it's strange. I know.",
        "Gwen: But they were in love.",
        "Barbara: And when he woke up, the first word out of his mouth was her name.",
        "Will: And then what happened? Mom, what did you tell Paul?",
        "Barbara: I told him that apparently, she is still married to Craig.",
        "Will: Mom, why would you do that?",
        "Barbara: Because he needed to know that she had the audacity of bringing Craig Montgomery to his memorial, and excuse me, I had just gotten my son back, literally from the dead. I was not about to lie to him.",
        "Will: Well, can we call him?",
        "Barbara: He said he'd be in touch.",
        "Gwen: Where did he go?",
        "Barbara: Paul knows how lucky he is and he thought that maybe he should do some good with that, so -- he went to Europe.",
        "Will: Europe? Did he go to see Rosanna?",
        "Gwen: Is that true?",
        "Will: It's a little sick, don't you think? It's like trying to get back at Craig for being with Meg?",
        "Barbara: He is not jealous of Craig. But he has this feeling -- this feeling that maybe he can help Rosanna. So that's what he's gone to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're as beautiful as ever. You know, I nearly died and I was where you are now. You know, kind of stuck somewhere between here and gone. And you came to me. You spoke to me. You knew that I needed you. And you helped me fight. And now it's your turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: You should have just told us you were running from your wife.",
        "Jack: And you woulda helped me?",
        "Man: We woulda helped you.",
        "Kit: Oh shut up, Fred. Ain't nobody helping nobody in my bar without my say so. Now back up, all of you. Give these folks so privacy.",
        "Man #2: But we wanna hear about the other woman.",
        "Fred: I don't. If he don't want you, I'll take you.",
        "Carly: Is that what you want? For some other man to take me?",
        "Fred: I'll fight you for her. Right here, right now.",
        "Kit: Quit! Now he had the coming and you know it. Back up or I'll cut you all off.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",
        "Carly: Now don't be so impolite. He may be too proud to thank you for stepping in, but I'm not. Thank you. Name's Lee.",
        "Kit: Kit. And the guys over there are gonna go crazy if I don't ask. This other woman -- what does she look like?",
        "Jack: Well I guess you and the guys are just gonna have to die of curiosity because we're outta here -- now.",
        "Carly: I'm not ready to go yet.",
        "Jack: You came here to find me -- you found me. Let's go.",
        "Kit: Hey! We're trying to talk here. What'd she look like?",
        "Carly: She was okay before -- now she's got a couple of black eyes and a missing front tooth.",
        "Jack: Lee, outside, now!",
        "Kit: Man, I can't believe I made him for a cop before. He's looking kind of sneaky to me now.",
        "Carly: Who, Ned? He's not sneaky, he's just mean. And I can't help it, I love 'em.",
        "Kit: Did he ever cheat on you before?",
        "Jack: Never.",
        "Carly: Lots.",
        "Kit: Has he ever hit you?",
        "Carly: Oh, he'd never do that. No matter how much he wanted to.",
        "Jack: Like now.",
        "Kit: I think you two should work things out.",
        "Jack: Yeah, why don't we do that?",
        "Carly: Hey, can we stay here? 'Cause if we leave, he's gonna run again and I'll probably never catch him.",
        "Kit: Yeah, take your time. Beers are on me.",
        "Carly: Ah, thanks kit.",
        "Jack: I thought we agreed that you were going to stay home and take care of Parker and Sage.",
        "Carly: I changed my mind. Aren't you glad I did?",
        "Jack: If J.J. is here --",
        "Carly: You can find him easier with me then without me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: Where'd that kid come from? He wasn't here before.",
        "Ava: He was with me in the car.",
        "Silas: He's our son. Me and Ava's.",
        "Kit: Since when?",
        "Silas: Since we adopted him. His name's Jacob. Tell her.",
        "J.J.: My name's Jacob.",
        "Ava: What took you so long? We've been waiting back here forever.",
        "Kit: Some trouble in the bar.",
        "Silas: Cops?",
        "Kit: What? You got cops following you, Silas?",
        "Silas: You know I'm smarter than that.",
        "Kit: You better not be lyin' to me. If you bring cops down on my place I --",
        "Silas: A place to stay. Remembered you rented a place down near the state line.",
        "Kit: Yeah, it's kinda isolated out there.",
        "Silas: That's why me and Ava like it.",
        "Kit: What? You gonna home school him?",
        "Ava: What do you care?",
        "Kit: I care when you start whining about having to drag his butt 20 miles to the nearest schoolhouse. You still want it?",
        "Ava: How much is it?",
        "Kit: Cash up front. No credit. If I don't have the rent in my hand by the first of the month, you're out on the streets by the second.",
        "J.J.: Well you know, I've go -- I've got some money. I can help pay.",
        "Ava: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think you're doing?",
        "J.J.: I'm just trying to help, Mom.",
        "Ava: You can help by keeping your mouth shut.",
        "J.J.: Well, there is money in there.",
        "Kit: Kid's got a big mouth. You should teach him how to shut it.",
        "Ava: Oh, we will. Soon as we get him home.",
        "Silas: Here, this outta cover the first couple of months.",
        "Kit: Whoa. Who did you rob? House on Norton Road. Couple miles east of Highway 6. You need a map?",
        "Silas: I can find it.",
        "Kit: Okay. Make sure the back door locks behind you and don't bring the kid around here again. I hate kids.",
        "Silas: Don't you ever pull a stunt like that again!",
        "J.J.: I was just trying to help. I do have money.",
        "Ava: Yeah, and that's not all he has. He's got some other stuff too. See, this is what he was trying to show Kit. It's a school I.D. and a library card.",
        "Silas: You see this picture of that J.J. Snyder boy? Take a good look 'cause that boy is gone now.",
        "J.J.: I hate you.",
        "Silas: What you better be is afraid of me. Now move.",

        "Carly: I could tell you were in trouble, so I came in with that story. Pretty good, huh?",
        "Jack: You slapped me. Twice.",
        "Carly: For effect. It worked, didn't it?",
        "Jack: That's beside the point.",
        "Carly: If you're gonna find J.J., you're gonna need another set of eyes and ears. Now, did I help you just now, or not?",
        "Jack: You helped.",
        "Carly: So what's our next move?",
        "Jack: You go home and I find our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you gotta wake up. If you would remember, you'd wake up. Maybe if you were upset, you'd remember. Do you remember what Craig did to you? Do you remember the accident? All you wanted was to be a mom. You fell in love with your son -- the boy you adopted. Gwen -- Gwen's boy. And you found out that Craig switched the babies -- you bribed a nurse and you made sure that you adopted his baby -- the one that he had with Jennifer. You called me. Do you remember that? You were so frantic to find me, to meet me, to tell me what had happened. And Craig chased you. You were trying to get away from he swerved his car into yours. Ran you off the road. You crashed. But you kept fighting. You kept trying to get to me and tell me what it was that Craig had done. Rosanna, you got to fight now. You have to. If you give up, Craig gets away with what he's done to you. You can do this. You can, I know you can. Please, Rosanna. Please come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Craig: Didn't your mother teach you to lock the door?",
        "Meg: And didn't your mother teach you to stay outside until somebody invited you in.",
        "Craig: Absolutely, but what would be the fun of that? Besides, we're still married.",
        "Meg: Only until the annulment papers are processed and then you'll be rid of me.",
        "Craig: Oh, whoa is me. Hey, and speaking of manners --",
        "Meg: Were we talking about manners?",
        "Craig: Well, you hung up on me.",
        "Meg: You laughed at my cooking.",
        "Craig: I think you should laugh too. You are not a cook, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know, I'm gonna love being annulled from you.",
        "Craig: Why do you all of a sudden want to be a big master baker anyway?",
        "Meg: I told everybody that I would make a pie.",
        "Craig: Everybody?",
        "Meg: Yes. Parker and Holden and Lily, and they're expecting a pie. So -- so I should try this again, you know, 'cause I can do this. I can do this.",
        "Craig: Or, you could just say thank you, Craig.",
        "Meg: What have you done now?",
        "Craig: Apple. Lemon meringue. And this -- peach. So, which one would you like?",
        "Meg: Blueberry.",
        "Craig: It's in the car. I'll have to go get it.",
        "Meg: Whoa, will you stop? Nobody's going to believe I made these.",
        "Craig: What? You have to make the pie? Fine. You know what, fine. We have got a little time before our board meeting. I think if you want to make a pie, let's just make a pie. Now, where's the recipe?",
        "Meg: Put that down.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Meg: Can you give that to me?",
        "Craig: What's the matter?",
        "Meg: Will you --",
        "Craig: Some kind of --",
        "Meg: Just please give me my cookbook.",
        "Craig: Was this some kind of gift or something? It is. Well then who's this from?",
        "Meg: Okay, give it back. Stop!",
        "Craig: Who is this from? Let's see. It says -- \"Meg, anyone as hot as you has got to learn to cook. Love, Paul.\" Such poetry.",
        "Meg: It was a joke. It was a joke between the two of us. I couldn't cook and he could and -- he didn't care that I couldn't. He just liked spending time with me. Anyway, I chopped the vegetables, poured the wine.",
        "Craig: What do you think you are, Meg? Really?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, I don't understand that question.",
        "Craig: Do you think you are a cook?",
        "Meg: Well, obviously, you don't think so. Fine, fine. You know what, we'll go with the peach.",
        "Craig: Who are you?",
        "Meg: I think I'm a daughter who constantly disappoints my mother. I think I'm an okay sister. I'm a compassionate and unemployed nurse. I'm a passable aunt, I'm a failed wife, a nice friend. I think I'm good in bed. I don't know, what do you think?",

After everything that's happened to this family this past year, we now have two miracles. So if Paul wants to try for a third with Rosanna, who's it going to hurt?",
        "Gwen: It hurts Meg. When Meg finds out that Paul's still alive and that he didn't come to her -- that he didn't even want her to know -- we don't know why she's still with Craig. She could have a very good reason.",
        "Barbara: She's been seduced. Take it from a woman who was literally burned by that man. Now I would not wish Craig Montgomery on anyone, but I hope that Meg stays with him. I hope she never comes near my son again because wherever she goes, craig goes, and I've had enough of him for a lifetime.",
