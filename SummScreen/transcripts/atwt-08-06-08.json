        "Brad wants he and Jack to work together to keep Parker and Liberty apart, as Parker listens. Katie and Liberty talk about she and Parker. After some bickering, Janet, Jack and Brad try to get on the same page in the parenting department. Alison has more trouble breathing and when Aaron rushes for help, Chris comes in and the nurse announces he is now Alison's attending physician. Aaron is determined to change that. Emily and Susan talk about how crazy she acted and Emily tells her that she has to get her marriage annulled. Casey shows up and Emily wants to leave the hospital to talk. Katie and Liberty bond over fashion. Chris tries to take Alison's blood, but she responds violently and stabs him with the needle he used to draw her blood. In her confused and paranoid state, she thinks Chris is trying to kill her. Emily and Casey are talking about ending their marriage when Emily sprays more perfume on and suddenly she can't keep her hands off of Casey. Afterwards, she does an about face and wants to stay together and show him off. She even wants to go talk with Tom and Margo about their marriage and tell them that they are together forever. Casey is confused but thrilled with her turn around. Chris tries to explain to Aaron that he and Alison have the same chemical compound in their blood that is making them sick, but Aaron just wants him away from Alison. Katie brings Liberty to the \u0091family meeting' Jack, Brad and Janet are having. There, they tell Liberty and Parker that they are not allowed to be seen together without parental supervision. Liberty actually agrees without hesitation, but Parker is incensed and will not heed to their request, as he stomps off. Chris promises to do his work for Alison in the lab. Jack admits to Janet that he is worried about Parker because he has lost a lot in his life; he second-guesses his parenting style after he sees Liberty's reaction versus Parker's. Janet reassures him that he is a wonderful father. Parker waits for Liberty and tells her that he knows she was saying that she would go along with their parents request to stay away just to appease them, but Liberty tells them that she was serious and they should try to do this. Parker tells her anxiously that he can't and won't stay away from her because he loves her, as Liberty is unsure how to handle this revelation and tells him that they need to cool off. In the lab, as he is taking his own blood, Chris starts to exhibit symptoms similar to Alison's, as he fights to stay coherent and well. After Casey is worried about how Emily looks, he convinces her to go back to the hospital. Once there, Casey starts to act funny and aggressive, especially after Susan asks him to leave Emily in her care. Susan realizes he may have caught what Emily has. Brad and Katie talk about trying to start having kids. Liberty goes to sees her mom upset about Parker, but she doesn't want to talk about it now. Casey barricades the door right before he and Emily seem to become more afflicted by this sickness. The guard breaks in and struggles with Casey while Susan tries to tend to a semi conscious Emily. Jack tells Parker about the tennis program that he applied to in Chicago accepted him; it would be a great opportunity, but he would understand if he doesn't want to go. However, surprisingly Parker jumps at the chance and tells his dad that he wants to go. Chris, in his afflicted state, goes to see Alison again to promise he won't give up, but Aaron finds him there and orders him out. Chris attacks Aaron with his bare hands. Bob rushes in and explains that Chris is obviously sickened with the same thing Alison has. He worries about how Chris will have trouble stopping this infectious disease that is spreading around the hospital now."

        "Jack: Hey. Parker?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Jack: I'm making pancakes. You hungry?",
        "Parker: Not really.",
        "Jack: Hold on! Hey!",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Jack: Par-- hey.",
        "Brad: Hey.",
        "Jack: What do you want, Brad?",
        "Brad: We need to put our heads together and figure out what to do about our kids.",
        "Jack: Something tells me you've already figured it out, so why don't you clue me in.",
        "Brad: Okay. Keep Parker away from Liberty. You do that and we won't have a problem from now on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, good morning. How many alarms did you sleep through?",
        "Liberty: I had to catch up on my Zs. Being held hostage in that cabin was, like, a major human-rights violation.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. It wasn't so awful. You got to do some bonding with your dad.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was okay. Except for the gutting of the fish. Not cool. And dodging bears on the way to the outhouse. Ew.",
        "Katie: Hey, listen. I hear you. I'm partial to indoor planning myself.",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "Katie: But you got some driving lessons. Brad was a pretty good teacher, I bet.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. He made it really fun, actually.",
        "Katie: Then you shouldn't have paid him back by running away with Parker.",
        "Liberty: Katie, I told you. That was Parker's idea.",
        "Katie: Well, it got you grounded.",
        "Liberty: Whatever. Okay? At least I still have my right to a phone, and Dad threw it out the window, so he has to replace it.",
        "Katie: And I'm sure he will.",
        "Liberty: Hey, where is that old guy, anyway?",
        "Katie: He said he had something to take care of.",
        "Liberty: Well, if he's getting me a new phone, he better get one with keypad for texting.",
        "Katie: Actually, I think he went to go see your Uncle Jack.",
        "Liberty: What? To find a way to keep me and Parker away from each other?",
        "Katie: Do you have a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did you change your mind about the pancakes?",
        "Parker: Nah.",
        "Jack: Then why don't you go get ready for tennis?",
        "Parker: I'm going.",
        "Jack: You were saying.",
        "Brad: I love Parker. I really do. I mean, he is a great kid, really. Parker and Liberty -- bad combo. Bad. Okay, my daughter has other stuff she should concentrate on besides boys and sex.",
        "Jack: I agree with you.",
        "Brad: So, what are you saying?",
        "Jack: I'm saying it's a two-way street, though, Brad. Part of the reason Parker chased Liberty up to that cabin is because Liberty wanted to be chased.",
        "Brad: And you let him off his leash. How about a little cooperation here, Brother?",
        "Jack: I'm agreeing with you. I don't want Parker to be around Liberty anymore, either.",
        "Brad: Well, good. At least we're on the same page about one thing.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: I brought you some homemade muffins to make up for yesterday. What's Bradley doing here?",
        "Brad: Hi.",
        "Janet: You're not talking about our daughter behind my back, are you?",
        "Jack: We were. We were discussing Parker and Liberty, yes.",
        "Janet: Bradley Snyder, when are you gonna get it through your thick skull, huh? You want to do a major bonding number with our daughter? That's fine. I'm okay with that. But the minute you think that you can raise her without me, you are sadly mistaken. 'Cause I swear I will make your life a living hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: It's just, after our grand-theft auto, I didn't really think you guys would be cheering for me and Parker.",
        "Katie: You know what, sometimes a little distance can be a really good thing, especially when things have gotten too intense. I'm just saying it could be an upside, right?",
        "Liberty: Whatever. I don't have a cell phone now, and that's the bigger problem here.",
        "Katie: Okay. Temporary, I'm sure. Listen, I have to get to the studio, but I am not allowed to leave you alone, so what do you say about getting dressed and coming with me? It's better than waiting for Brad to come home, give you another lecture.",
        "Liberty: Okay, okay, okay, okay. But just have the a/c running in the car, and I'll be out in like five minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gasps]",
        "Aaron: Ali, what's wrong?",
        "Alison: Aaron?",
        "Aaron: What's wrong? I'm right here. How you doing? You okay?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I feel weak. It's just hard to breathe.",
        "Aaron: D-d-don't stress out. I'll be right back, okay? I'll be right back. I need a doctor in here right now, please!",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Aaron: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, okay? Just relax. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Chris: I'm helping Ali.",
        "Aaron: The hell you are! You're only gonna make it worse! Now go out there and get another doctor right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Your vital signs are back to normal. That's a relief.",
        "Emily: That's good. I mean, I definitely feel better. Do you have any idea what was wrong with me?",
        "Susan: Not yet, but I'm waiting for more blood work.",
        "Emily: I just -- I just wish I knew what made me so -- so out of it. It was like I was on another planet.",
        "Susan: I know. That's exactly how Alison felt.",
        "Emily: What do you mean?",
        "Susan: She's here in another room.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: You may have both caught some kind of virus or something, but so far, nobody in the lab seems to know what it is.",
        "Emily: Wait a minute. Alison's here? When did she get sick?",
        "Susan: She hasn't been herself for several days. And at first, I thought it was just schoolwork or stress or -- but then she -- oh, you don't need to hear all this.",
        "Emily: Yes, I do, Mother. She's my sister. I'm worried about her.",
        "Susan: You don't have any reason to. Both your symptoms have been very similar. And if you're pulling out of it, I'm sure she will, too.",
        "Emily: I hope she didn't do anything as crazy as I did.",
        "Susan: You mean like getting married?",
        "Emily: Mother, how insane is that? I married Casey. Casey Hughes. I mean, I made him fly to St. Louis with me. It was -- it was like I was possessed or something.",
        "Susan: You can't be here. You can't be in this room.",
        "Casey: Excuse me. Emily is my wife. I belong here. And no one's gonna tell me otherwise.",
        "Susan: Do you want me to call security?",
        "Emily: Mom, please. Will you just go? I need to talk to Casey in private.",
        "Susan: All right. But don't stress her out. She's still recovering.",
        "Casey: Hey. I've been going out of my mind. This thing you have, is it serious?",
        "Emily: I'm okay now, but, obviously, it was serious enough to make me do things I never would have done, and I've been sick. Listen to me, I'm sorry. I am so sorry, Casey. I never should have pressured you into marrying me. If I was in my right mind, I never would have done it.",
        "Casey: Well, forget it. All I care about is your health. Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Whatever I had, it's gone. I'm okay.",
        "Casey: Good. I hope so. Well, I'm sorry, too, for getting bent out of shape.",
        "Emily: You were angry and confused. Who could blame you?",
        "Casey: When my mom said you were in the hospital, you know, I was a mess. All I could think about was, \"I don't want to lose you.\"",
        "Emily: It's okay. I'm okay. Whatever. Whatever I had -- whatever bug I had, it's gone. I'm just sorry it made me so crazy.",
        "Casey: No. Getting married was not crazy. And don't say it was a mistake because it wasn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Chris Hughes has no right to be in here, okay? He's been suspended.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Hughes has been reinstated.",
        "Aaron: I don't care. He shouldn't be treating this patient. You know, they have history. Because she sued him for sexual harassment.",
        "Nurse: He's her attending physician.",
        "Aaron: Says who?",
        "Chris: Her B.P. is low. She needs more fluids. Keep an eye on her electrolytes, okay?",
        "Nurse: Okay.",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna go get your dad to see what he has to say about this, okay?",
        "Chris: Do whatever you want, Aaron, but it's not gonna help Ali!",
        "Aaron: Okay, we'll see about that!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Chris: Ali, can you hear me? Can you hear me? You need to try to stay awake, Sweetheart, okay? You need to try to stay awake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I may have missed out on the first 16 years of her life, but I am her father and I am responsible for her.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay! Are you saying I'm not responsible?",
        "Brad: Was it my fault that you dropped the ball and now I have to play defense?",
        "Janet: Oh, don't give me that crap!",
        "Jack: Can we please chill out? There's plenty of blame to go around. Carly and I have dropped a few balls with Parker in the past, too. But now what we need to do is step up, take responsibility and work together to fix it.",
        "Janet: I'm with you, Jack, all the way.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Brad: Oh, you know, and since you brought that up, going all the way with Jack may not have been the best example for Liberty.",
        "Janet: We gonna go down that road again?",
        "Jack: Can we stay on topic, please?",
        "Brad: Hey, you know, I'm saying kids learn by example, and maybe Janet should set a better example.",
        "Janet: Who are you, the pope, all of a sudden? She wasn't conceived out of the Immaculate Conception, you know.",
        "Brad: No, no, no. She was conceived by two stupid teenagers in high school, and, unfortunately, she's continuing on the tradition.",
        "Janet: Again, my fault. Again.",
        "Jack: Can we stop worrying about and fighting about whose fault it is? Listen, we both tried to lay it on the line with our kids. It didn't work. Your tough- love technique --",
        "Brad: Hey, at least I'm trying to give her some discipline, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Bodyguards and boot camp in the woods. That only made her run away.",
        "Brad: Well, your son had something to do with that.",
        "Jack: Yes, I agree, and that's why Parker is grounded. What we need to start to do is be firm and be consistent.",
        "Brad: You have to admit, Janet, that giving Liberty this freedom, it only confuses her.",
        "Janet: Are you talking about the birth control? Because I don't think she was confused at all. I think she was safe.",
        "Jack: Time out, time out. You guys both agree that Liberty and Parker should not be having sex at this point in their life, right?",
        "Both: Yes! Yes!",
        "Jack: Carly and I, we also agree. So what we need to start to do is we need to find a way -- the right way to tell them that they can't be together.",
        "Brad: Definitely.",
        "Janet: You're right. You're right, Jack, yeah. So, what is the right way? I'm all ears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Assistant: Oh, Katie, thank God you're here!",
        "Katie: Why? I'm not late, am I? We're not taping till this afternoon.",
        "Assistant: Oh, no, right. But Kim wants to add a fashion segment -- \"Teen trends for back to school.\" Pick the designs you want for the insert shots?",
        "Katie: Got it. Thank you.",
        "Assistant: Thanks.",
        "Liberty: I can help you with that.",
        "Katie: Yeah. You know, now that you mention it, I can use some help. I like to try to keep up with trends, but they're a little different in the high-school aspect.",
        "Liberty: Hey, no. You did really good when you bought me those clothes when I came to town.",
        "Katie: No. You made all those choices. Look through this and see what you like.",
        "Liberty: Okay, okay. Um, with jeans, high waisted -- no, no, no. Low rise all the time. And this baggy stuff works for guys, not for girls. So last season.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Why do they always want to look like their pants are falling off?",
        "Liberty: It draws attention to the below-the-waist area.",
        "Katie: Yeah, 'cause all guys think about is sex, right?",
        "Liberty: Pretty much.",
        "Katie: Including Parker?",
        "Liberty: I don't -- I don't know. I can't figure Parker out at all.",
        "Katie: Well, you know he likes you. I mean, he's totally into you. It was his idea for you guys to run away, right?",
        "Liberty: And these peasant blouses are really cool.",
        "Katie: Right, yeah. We'll definitely take a look at those. You know, I only bring it up because running away was always, like, a default for Parker. Whenever things weren't going his way, he would run off to Chicago or the middle of the woods, wherever, and scare his parents to death.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, he told me, but that's really not what we were doing.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Liberty: Well, he wanted to and da, da, da, but I told him it was really dumb, and, you know, I talked to him about it.",
        "Katie: Good, yeah. Well, I guess, sometimes it pays to be older, right?",
        "Liberty: I guess.",
        "Katie: You seem to know what you want and you're not afraid to say it.",
        "Liberty: Yeah? Well, I really want these shoes.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Oh. It's your dad. Hey, what's going on?",
        "Brad: Is Liberty still with you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, she's with me, and we're actually at the studio.",
        "Brad: I need you to bring her to Carly's house right away. Jack and Janet are here. We're having a family pow-wow.",
        "Katie: Passing around the peace pipe, I hope.",
        "Brad: Or more like, you know, Daddy lays down the law.",
        "Katie: You know what, that might not go over so well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Casey, we got married way, way too impulsively. There's no way this marriage could ever work out.",
        "Casey: I don't say it that way.",
        "Emily: Casey, I could give you a million reasons why -- our age difference not even being one of them.",
        "Casey: Okay, that is bogus, and you know that.",
        "Emily: I'm your half-brother's mother, okay? That's just weird.",
        "Casey: And if Daniel knew, I bet he'd have no problem with it.",
        "Emily: I don't believe it for a minute.",
        "Casey: Okay, look, look. I'm not going anywhere. I cannot lose you.",
        "Susan: Are you still here?",
        "Casey: Yes, and I'm still her husband.",
        "Susan: Not for long, I hope.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what, get up. I'm checking myself out. I've had enough of this.",
        "Susan: Emily. Emily.",
        "Emily: Mother, I'm fine.",
        "Susan: As your doctor, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Casey: Yeah, shouldn't you wait for your test results.",
        "Susan: For once, I agree with him. You've got to stay here.",
        "Emily: I am fine. I am leaving. I promise I will come back if there's something in my -- in my blood work, okay? Just don't argue with me with this. I'm not -- I'm not staying here.",
        "Susan: I know better than to argue when I can't win. Here. A couple of magazines. And I thought it would keep you occupied if you were staying, but you're not.",
        "Emily: What is this? I gave this to you.",
        "Susan: Oh, it's that perfume. I -- I know I used to wear it all the time, but, you know, I think I'm allergic to it now. Listen, just take it back so it won't go to waste.",
        "Emily: Case, could you, um -- do you mind going outside? I got to change.",
        "Casey: Why are you self-conscious all of a sudden in front of your husband? Okay. Okay, I'm going.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Susan: I'm gonna go get your release papers. Don't make me regret this.",
        "Emily: I won't. I promise. I've got things to do. Mostly convincing Casey that this marriage needs to be annulled. And for his own good, I need to break things off with him. Once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: When I get the samples, send one to immunology. I'm gonna take the other one to the lab myself and write some tests on it. Thank you very much. Ali, this will only sting for a second, okay, Sweetheart?",
        "[Gasps]",
        "Ali: Get away from me!",
        "Alison: Leave me alone!",
        "Nurse: You need to go to E.R. for needle-stick protocol.",
        "Chris: It's okay. It didn't hurt.",
        "Alison: No, don't touch me!",
        "Aaron: What the hell are you doing to her?",
        "Chris: I'm doing nothing, all right.",
        "Alison: He -- he -- he tried to kill me with a drug!",
        "Aaron: Okay. He needs to stay away from her, okay?",
        "Bob: Chris, what's going on?",
        "Chris: Dad, I was just trying to take a blood sample, and she pulled the needle out of my hand and stuck me with it.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, probably out of self-defense.",
        "Nurse: I was here the whole time. Dr. Hughes did nothing wrong.",
        "Chris: I'm just trying to help her.",
        "Aaron: You're freaking her out! I mean, can't you people see that?",
        "Chris: Dad, please don't take me off this case, okay? Lives can depend on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Are you really up to going back to work so soon?",
        "Emily: Stop worrying about me.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. You gave us a real scare.",
        "Emily: I scared myself, but whatever it is I had, I fought it off. I just wish I could say the same of my sister. I wish I got to see her before I left the hospital.",
        "Casey: Well, your mom promised she would call with an update, right?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey: And can you promise me something?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Casey: You didn't leave the hospital because I showed up, did you?",
        "Emily: Casey, it had nothing to do with you. I swear, really. I can't stand hospitals. I don't know how my sister and my mother can work in that place. The smell of it, it's still all over me. I can't stand it. It's like that antiseptic. Ugh. [Sighs] That's better. That's better. That's much better.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'm ready.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Casey: For the big lecture. How us getting married was a huge mistake, that it's over, that I'm too young for you, yada, yada, yada. Come on, do it. Okay, I agree with you. Yes, it was a huge mistake. We jumped into it without even really thinking about it, yes. But you know, when I got married to you, it really made me happy. So what if my parents don't approve of this, or your mom thinks we're crazy? But why should we let them tell us how to live our lives? Unless this was a huge fling for you and you don't care, honestly. I want to know. Can you please tell me what you want.",
        "Emily: I want you. I want you so much. I will never stop.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Look at her. Can't you see he's doing more harm than good being here?",
        "Chris: Alison is disoriented because she is sick. There is a compound in her blood that we have not been able to identify yet. Whatever it is, it is making her paranoid. I know the symptoms because I was infected with the same thing. I know what we're dealing with here. Dad, just -- just give me a chance. Maybe I can find a viable antidote.",
        "Bob: What I want you guys to do is go outside. I want to examine Alison myself. All right, all right. Okay. Okay. It's all right.",

        "Parker: Well, I couldn't just stand there with them all staring at me like that, especially after you said that you wouldn't see me anymore. And I was really mad at you for saying that. But then I realized that you're really good at telling parents what they want to hear, and you didn't really mean that, right?",

        "Parker: Yeah, they'd make threats, like when my dad said that he was gonna send me away to the boarding school for bad kids, but he never did and he never would because he knew that I'd escape.",
        "Liberty: For how long, Parker? They would find you and bring you back. Because you know what, your parents actually care about you, so stop talking about running away all the time.",
        "Parker: All right, so I stay here. That still doesn't mean that I have to follow their rules, and neither do you, okay? We can both find a way to sneak out of the house and go meet up somewhere, like at the library, and that way we can meet without them knowing.",

        "Jack: Yeah, but I was older when it happened to me. You -- you did an amazing job under the circumstances.",
        "Janet: Except I was more of a friend to her than a mother, and when I look back on that, that was a mistake.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Maybe my mistake was that I went too far in the other direction. I was too strict with Parker sometimes. Maybe if I applied the \"Live and let live\" philosophy like you did, it would have turned out better.",
        "Janet: You're not putting me up on a pedestal, are you?",
        "Jack: No. Liberty, she was much more reasonable tonight than Parker. That says something.",
        "Janet: You know how you're always telling me not to sell myself short? You need to take your own advice because you are an amazing father, and Parker knows that. He'll come around.",
