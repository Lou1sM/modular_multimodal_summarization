Margo poses a hypothetical situation to Tom and asks him if Adam were alive would he help get the charges against him dropped. Tom tells Margo he wouldn't do that because Adam committed worse crimes then Casey and since Casey went to jail he thinks its only right that Adam also pays for his crimes. Tom worries that Margo hasn't accepted Adam's death and suggests she get therapy but Margo tells Tom she doesn't need therapy. Allison tells Casey that she is worried about Bob and they both tell Tom about the episode but Tom tells her not to worry but if anything else happens to let him know. Riley has a fever so he goes to the hospital where Bob mistakenly tells Allison to give him a higher dose of medicine then he needs to treat Riley's flu. Allison questions the dosage but Bob gets angry and tells her to stop questioning him and do what she is told to do. Allison gives Riley thee dose and he goes into convulsions Bob is able to save him but when Allison tells him she followed his dosage order he tells her he told her to give Riley a much lower dose of medicine. Allison tells Casey about the incident but admits she isn't sure if she was the one who misunderstood Bob so Casey tells her not to report the incident to the hospital since she isn't sure of her facts so that it won't cause trouble for her or his grandfather. Allison apologizes to Riley who says it was an honest mistake and promises not to sue the hospital. Tom asks Riley to move out of the house when he feels better because having him around isn't helping Margo because she is using him to replace Adam.",
        "Barbara is angry when she discovers Paul gave money to Emily to start a newspaper and she vows to do anything she has to to protect Paul to stop Emily whom she calls \"the blonde barracuda\" from digging her claws into Paul again. Emily asks Hunter to be in charge of the online version of the newspaper while she will handle the print version of the newspaper. Hunter turns down Emily's offer at first because he thinks she either feels sorry for him or is trying to buy his affection. Hunter has no choice but to take the offer when he gets fired from Java for being clumsy and breaking too many cups and plates. Paul tells Emily she and Hunter can move into Fairwinds because he has a lot of room and they can also use the house as an office for the newspaper. Hunter wants to know Emily's relationship with Paul and she tells him their relationship is very personal and Hunter tells Emily he doesn't need to know that much information about his mom. Emily is pleased Hunter called her mom for the first time. Bob tells Barbara about the mistake Allison made at the hospital and questions if Alison can be a good nurse. Barbara asks Bob to help her have Paul committed again."

        "Alison: Dr. Hughes? Can I help you with something? You look a little lost.",
        "Bob: No, I'm not lost. And if I need your help, Susan, I'll ask for it.",
        "Alison: I'm Alison, Dr. Hughes. Susan is my mother. I'm Alison.",
        "Bob: Well, of course you are. Who else would you be? Keep up the good work, Alison.",

        "Margo: Gonna get a pint of passion fruit sor-- I'm gonna get a quart of passion fruit sorbet, the way Tom goes through that.",
        "Riley: Sorbet? I always thought Dad was a \"Double whipped cream and nuts, hold the cherries\" kind of guy. What?",
        "Margo: You called him \"Dad.\"",
        "Riley: Sorry.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. No. It's just -- it's not like you. You never talk like that, even when no one else is around. I mean, me, I love calling you \"Adam\" and talking about the old days, but you --",
        "Riley: You're right. You're right. We both need to be careful. So, when did Tom become allergic to whipped cream?",
        "Margo: Well, don't get me wrong. He'd much rather have double-chocolate everything with everything on it, but I'd much rather have him around for the next 50 years, so --",
        "Riley: So sorbet all the way.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you bet.",
        "Riley: Well, it certainly seems that the two of you have things back on track.",
        "Margo: I can safely say that your father and I are doing just fine.",
        "Riley: Good. I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Margo: Okay. So, is there anything that you want from the store? I think that I can stretch the budget a little bit. I can get some of those rainbow icy things that you used to love so -- hey. Riley, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you okay?",
        "Riley: Uh, I'm fine.",
        "Margo: Fine? \"Fine\" doesn't pass out in the middle of a conversation.",
        "Riley: All right. Maybe I'm feeling a little bit off.",
        "Margo: \"A little off\"? What?",
        "Riley: A scratchy throat, achy.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. You could have that flu or any number of a million bugs that are out there.",
        "Riley: Would you stop? I'm fine. There's no need to go ahead and call the CDC. Don't. Please.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. You're burning up.",
        "Riley: You're gonna catch it. No.",
        "Margo: No. Look at you. Your skin is not good, and your eyes are -- oh, those eyes.",
        "Tom: Good morning, Riley.",
        "Riley: Hey.",
        "Margo: Honey, I think that Riley might have a fever, so could you get the thermometer and check?",
        "Tom: Oh, no need. It looks like the hands-on method's working fine for you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Casey, I am so glad to see you.",
        "Casey: I am glad to see you, too.",
        "Alison: Hey --",
        "Casey: What's up? Did I lose the touch?",
        "Alison: No, no, no. It's not you. I --",
        "Casey: What is it, then?",
        "Alison: You know, I'm not sure I should bother you with it.",
        "Casey: We're back together. You're supposed to bother me. That didn't come out right, but you know what I mean.",
        "Alison: No, I know. I-I just had like the weirdest moment with your grandfather.",
        "Casey: Well, join the club, you know? Granddad has a weird sense of humor. You're serious, aren't you?",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's the second time something like this has happened. I'm afraid it's no joke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well, hello, Ms. Ryan. You look very nice today.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Um, you know, I really would appreciate it if you would not call me \"Ms Ryan,\" but Mom.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't remember being your son, so calling you \"Mom\" is -- it's a little weird.",
        "Barbara: Well, we're gonna have to work on that, aren't we? Are you moving, Paul?",
        "Paul: Just getting rid of some of this clutter.",
        "Barbara: Paul, this is -- this is a very valuable piece of art. I bought this for you for your birthday. See? It's a mother and child. I paid a lot of money for this.",
        "Paul: Well, thank you, but it's ugly.",
        "Barbara: I'm worried about you.",
        "Paul: Oh, please, don't worry about me. I feel great.",
        "Barbara: No, I'm worried about you, because Bob told me that you were refusing the procedure to remove the lesion from your brain.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Barbara: Why would you refuse a procedure that will restore your memory, that will restore your identity?",
        "Paul: The question is, why would I want to be that guy again? He had terrible taste.",
        "Barbara: Listen to me. The old Paul has a beautiful daughter, has a home, a life, responsibilities. The new Paul just can't ignore all that.",
        "Paul: Oh, no. I'm not doing that.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Paul: In fact, that's why I'm giving away most of my money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: There you are. I have been looking all over for you.",
        "Hunter: I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Emily: Well, whatever it is you're doing, it will have to wait, because I have news. I have tremendous news. You are looking at the publisher of a brand-new print-and-online newspaper. Ha! An old friend of mine -- a very old friend of mine -- with lots of money and absolutely nowhere to spend it is bankrolling the entire deal. Okay, this is where you say, \"Congratulations, Emily.\"",
        "Hunter: You're out of your mind.",
        "Emily: Are you not understanding what I'm telling you?",
        "Hunter: There are newspapers closing all over the country, and you want to open up a new one?",
        "Emily: No. My brand-new newspaper. I will be in charge of everything, Hunter, from the typeface to the colors of the tiles in the bathroom.",
        "Hunter: Is the person who's funding all this in possession of his or her senses?",
        "Emily: No, which is probably why he agreed to do it.",
        "Hunter: Well, I suppose I should wish you luck.",
        "Emily: No, wish us luck, partner, because with me in charge of the print edition and you in charge of the online part, we will leave Lucinda and the Intruder in the dust.",
        "Hunter: Are you offering me a job?",
        "Emily: Yes! Let's get started.",
        "Hunter: Not a chance.",
        "Emily: Why not? Give me one good reason why not.",
        "Hunter: I'll give you two. You shouldn't offer me a job because you feel like you owe me something.",
        "Emily: I'm not. I'm offering it because you're the best man for the job.",
        "Hunter: Then there's a second reason. If you think you can buy my affections with a paycheck, it's not gonna work.",
        "Barbara: You can't be serious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sure, I can. Here. Watch.",
        "Barbara: You can't just give your money away, Paul.",
        "Paul: I can. I did.",
        "Barbara: To whom?",
        "Paul: Well, you know Meg, right? Most of it, I gave to her kid.",
        "Barbara: You mean to your daughter -- Eliza.",
        "Paul: Yeah, yeah, her. It's the least I could do. Meg didn't even want to take the check. I practically had to force her. Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's good. At least Meg came to her senses. I guess it's a good thing to have a nest egg for Eliza, though I wish you would have called a lawyer, even to set up a trust.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I probably could have done that, but I didn't.",
        "Barbara: I suppose you could have done a lot worse with your money. You haven't done worse, have you?",
        "Paul: I don't think so. I think I made a very wise and prudent investment.",
        "Barbara: In what?",
        "Paul: Um, I helped a friend buy a newspaper.",
        "Barbara: A newspaper?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Barbara: This is a very small town. We already have two newspapers. We have the City Times, we heave the Intruder. They're both losing readership. We already lost another newspaper -- the Argus. Who did you possibly give money to?",
        "Paul: Her name's Emily Stewart.",
        "Barbara: The blond barracuda?",
        "Paul: Wow. I guess you're right. This is a small town.",
        "Barbara: Listen to me. Listen to me. If you remembered Emily at all, if you remembered anything about her, you would not give her a thin dime.",
        "Paul: Well, you're entitled to your opinion.",
        "Barbara: I'm not gonna let you do this.",
        "Paul: You can't stop me.",
        "Barbara: Just watch me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: If he was out of it, okay, just one time, then, yeah, I would think it was nothing. But twice?",
        "Casey: You're acting like this is serious.",
        "Alison: I think it could be.",
        "Casey: You think, like, Alzheimer's or --",
        "Alison: It could be a lot of things. It could even be nothing. I'm just saying I think it's a good idea not to ignore it.",
        "Casey: Look, you studied the medical stuff. I haven't. If you think something's going on, then I'm behind you. What do you think we should do?",
        "Alison: Well, I think we should tell somebody about what happened this morning. We should let your family know what's going on. I mean, I guess I could talk to Kim again.",
        "Casey: No. I don't think we should involve her with it, you know, especially if it turns out to be nothing.",
        "Alison: All right. Well, who, then?",
        "Casey: My dad's at the Lakeview. I think we could go there and see what he says.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, let's go.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: \"Buy your affections\"? What, are you out of some kind of Victorian romance novel?",
        "Hunter: You know what I mean.",
        "Emily: If I wanted to trick you, trust me when I tell you, you would never see it coming. I swear. I am not trying to mother you or smother you. I am offering you this job. I'd offer it to you if I didn't know you from a hole in the ground, because you are completely brilliant at what you do.",
        "Hunter: Well, that's not what you said before.",
        "Emily: No, I never admitted it before. There is no one -- no one -- who can run an online newspaper better than you.",
        "Hunter: Sorry, Emily, I'm just not interested.",
        "Emily: No, no! Of course you're interested. You have to be interested. You're just being stubborn, and, unfortunately, you got that quality from me.",
        "Hunter: Oh, well, if you're gonna bring up the whole mother thing --",
        "Emily: Will you listen to me? Our own newspaper. We can do anything we want. We have freedom to make this paper anything we want. You said it yourself. You just said it yourself. \"Newspapers are closing down all over the country.\" Where else are you gonna get a job like this?",
        "Hunter: Oh, I've got one.",
        "Emily: Where?",
        "Manager: I need two pieces of apple pie with whipped cream, if you're not too busy.",
        "Hunter: Coming right up.",
        "Emily: Here? You work here?",
        "Hunter: Yeah. You got a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Who are you calling?",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna call our banker and stop this madness.",
        "Paul: Tell him I hope his daughter's feeling better. Hello? I already talked to him. Come on. I couldn't do it without him. I don't even know what bank accounts I have.",
        "Barbara: I can't believe that Barry allowed you to do this.",
        "Paul: Barry encouraged me to do whatever I choose with my money -- make a big pile on the floor and play with it, stimulate the tap-shoe industry.",
        "Barbara: Any of that would have been better than financing a newspaper for Emily Stewart.",
        "Paul: Why is that any worse than the way Paul Ryan used to spend his money?",
        "Barbara: The woman shot you in the back. Do you know that? Do you know that she shot you and she shoved you over a cliff and she left you for dead?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, all of that's in the past, and the best thing about my condition is I don't have a memory. You know, losing the memories -- it kind of clears out the clutter of the brain. Now, if you don't mind, I really should probably get back to --",
        "Barbara: Whether you remember me or not, I am your mother, and I'm not gonna allow you to fall into the clutches of a woman who has tried to ruin your life countless times before and is primed to do it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Please tell me you are not turning down my offer for this?",
        "Hunter: Oh, well, there's more to life than running a newspaper, Emily?",
        "Emily: Yeah, but none that suit you so well.",
        "[Manager clears throat]",
        "Hunter: Oh, yeah, coming right up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Manager: You're already in the hole for the broken cups. I think you better take your friend up on her job offer.",
        "Hunter: What, are you firing me?",
        "Manager: That's the first thing you got right all day.",
        "Hunter: Great. Are you happy? I just lost another job because of you.",
        "Emily: You should be thanking me, Hunter. Will you face it? When it comes to computers, there is absolutely no one better than you. When it comes to working in a coffee shop, you're a danger to yourself and the rest of society.",
        "Hunter: Okay. If I said yes --",
        "Emily: Which you will.",
        "Hunter: Which I haven't.",
        "Emily: But you will. I know.",
        "Hunter: But if I said yes, when would we start?",
        "Emily: As soon as the money's transferred, which is right about now.",
        "Hunter: Where's this money coming from?",
        "Emily: I told you -- an old friend of mine.",
        "Hunter: Well, I barely know you. I don't anything about your relationships. What if this friend of yours is using us to set up some sort of money- laundering scheme?",
        "Emily: No, no. A week ago, I wouldn't have put it past him. Now, trust me, you've got nothing to worry about.",
        "Hunter: I'd like to meet him, make sure it's on the level.",
        "Emily: You want a meeting? You got a meeting. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: I told you, I'm fine, all right? I'm probably doing a lot better than Tom is right now.",
        "Margo: I thought he'd gotten over this whole jealousy issue with you.",
        "Riley: Oh, you mean the way you keep fussing over me.",
        "Margo: I'm your mother. Fussing is hardwired in me. But Tom doesn't know who you are, and so he keeps misinterpreting everything, and I hate this.",
        "Riley: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, Honey, it's not your fault.",
        "Riley: Of course it is. I mean, if I had never done the things that I did -- or better yet, if I had never come back --",
        "Margo: Oh, don't even say that. I wouldn't give up any moment of the time I've had with you.",
        "Riley: Yeah, but if he's still jealous --",
        "Margo: You know what? I'm just gonna have to be more careful and have to watch myself a little bit more when I'm around you and him.",
        "Riley: Are you sure you can do that?",
        "Margo: Well, I have to, because if Tom finds out who you are, I-I couldn't live through sending another son to -- to jail, so -- oh, there's got to be a way around this.",
        "Riley: What are you thinking?",
        "Margo: I'm thinking that you need to get to a doctor.",
        "Riley: No, I don't need a doctor.",
        "Margo: You do. You do. Why don't you just let me drive you to the hospital? I'll drop you off on my way to work.",
        "Riley: And if Tom sees us out together? No. No more mothering. I will take care of myself.",
        "Margo: And will you take care of my boy?",
        "[Riley sighs]",
        "Riley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Riley: Bye.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Riley: Oh. Oakdale Taxi? Yeah, I-I need a -- a ride to Memorial hospital. As soon as you can get here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Dad, hey, hey.",
        "Tom: Hey. What are you two doing here?",
        "Casey: We're looking for you. Are you done with your meeting?",
        "Tom: I just finished up, but I do have to get back to the office. Why?",
        "Alison: It's about Dr. Hughes.",
        "Tom: What about Dad?",
        "Alison: I've been around him a couple of times when he seemed to be a little disoriented.",
        "Tom: Disoriented how?",
        "Alison: Well, at Casey's party the other day, he was acting like we were in the hospital. And then today he called me by my mother's name.",
        "Tom: Okay. Is that it?",
        "Casey: Well, Ali's worried about him and she doesn't think we should let this slide, and I agree with her.",
        "Tom: Casey, your granddad has it more together than I ever do. I mean, he still beats the pants off of me at golf. He keeps careful track of every bet that I lose to him. And as far as forgetting names, how many times have I called you Daniel?",
        "Casey: Lots, especially when you're mad at me.",
        "Alison: Well, I think it's a little more than just calling someone the wrong name once or twice.",
        "Tom: Well, I appreciate your concern. I just don't think it's anything to worry about right now.",
        "Casey: You really think so?",
        "Tom: Yeah, I'm positive. I know that you just graduated from nursing school. Perhaps it makes you just a little hyper cautious.",
        "Alison: So you think I'm overreacting?",
        "Tom: By all means, I think you should keep an eye out. I mean, Dad is not getting any younger, but from what you've seen so far, I don't think there's anything to worry about.",
        "Casey: Good. Thanks, Dad.",
        "Tom: Anytime. Okay, but if you do see anything, you let me know right away, okay?",
        "Casey: We will. You feel better?",
        "Alison: Not really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hello, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: If you think I'm gonna let you take advantage of my son, you are sadly mistaken.",
        "Emily: And we're off.",
        "Paul: She's not taking advantage of me.",
        "Barbara: You walked in here at his most vulnerable and you came in begging, didn't you?",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Investing in a newspaper was Paul's idea, not mine.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't give me that. You used your wiles on him the way you always do.",
        "Paul: You've got wiles? Can I see 'em?",
        "Barbara: You already have seen them.",
        "Emily: You know, you're ridiculous. You act like I put a gun to his head.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you've done that, too.",
        "Hunter: Look Ma'am, I don't know who you are, but you shouldn't talk to Emily like that.",
        "Barbara: Who is this, Emily, your new boy toy?",
        "Emily: For your information, the boy toy happens to be --",
        "Barbara: For my information, I don't really care who this is, because you are what you always have been -- a liar and a cheat.",
        "Hunter: Hey!",
        "Paul: Emily Stewart is a lovely and talented woman.",
        "[Barbara laughs]",
        "Paul: And if you continue to speak poorly of her, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave my house and never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Riley, are you all right?",
        "Riley: No, I don't think so. I passed out at home.",
        "Alison: You better go get Dr. Hughes.",
        "Riley: Why do you guys keep it so hot in here?",
        "Alison: You're running a fever.",
        "Bob: Chart, please. Hello, Riley.",
        "Riley: Hi, Dr. Hughes. I, uh, wish I could say it's great to see you again, but --",
        "Alison: He's presenting with flu-like symptoms. Since he's staying with Casey and his family, I thought you should take a look at him for yourself.",
        "Bob: That's good thinking, Alison.",
        "Alison: So, is it a flu or --",
        "Bob: Well, it looks like garden variety flu, but no reason not to take this seriously. I'm gonna listen to your lungs, Riley.",
        "Riley: Oh, okay.",
        "Bob: Just lean forward.",
        "Riley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bob: Deep breath.",
        "[Riley inhales, exhales deeply]",
        "Bob: Again. You have some congestion. Luckily, we have the right stuff for that. We'll give him 50 milligrams of Ventricil.",

        "Margo: Honey, you completely overreacted to what you saw this morning. Riley was sick, and I was worried that he might have a fever. That's all. What?",
        "Tom: What do you want me to say? You were worried about Riley.",
        "Margo: All right. So you're okay with that?",
        "Tom: You know, this is rapidly becoming that conversation about Riley that I said I didn't want to have.",

        "Tom: Really? What's up?",

        "Margo: Yeah, well, none of this is fair. I mean -- if Adam was still alive, don't you think that there's some way that he could have made up for all the horrible things that he did, to try and do better?

        "Bob: I am. So far, she's done a good job -- until today.",
        "Barbara: But she's a Stewart -- isn't she? Which means that she's a walking disaster. At least you were able to control any kind of damage that Alison might have done. I'm just hoping to do the same thing with Emily.",

        "Alison: Yeah. I knew it was wrong. I told Dr. Hughes that it was wrong, but he insisted. And then Riley stopped breathing. I mean, he could have died.",

        "Riley: What did he say?",
        "Margo: Well, I just tried to get a feel of what he would feel like if -- if he thought Adam was still alive, if he would try and get the charges dropped.",
        "Riley: And?",
        "Margo: Well, and now he thinks I'm crazy because I keep talking about Adam as if Adam was still alive, which you are. And every minute, every second of the day, I want to scream, \"My son Adam is alive and he's here,\" and I want to hold you and never let you go again.",
        "Riley: Mom, you need to get a grip.",

        "Riley: Much better, thanks.",
        "Tom: Good. So, as soon as you get back on your feet, I'd like you to leave this house. I want to be very clear about this. I'm not asking you to leave because I'm jealous or anything like that.",

        "Tom: I'm worried about Margo.",
        "Riley: You -- you think I'm hurting her?",
        "Tom: I know you are. She's not dealing with Adam's death the way that she should.",
        "Riley: Shouldn't she be the one to decide how she grieves about her son's death?",
        "Tom: Well, of course, but she's not doing that, is she? Instead, she's turned you into a replacement for Adam. That's not healthy for anyone.",
        "Riley: I-I know I've been treated like a member of the family, but I never asked for any of that.",
        "Tom: And I'm not blaming you, believe me. In fact, at first, I thought having you around was helping her come to terms with Adam's death, but I couldn't have been more wrong.",
        "Riley: No, no, no. I-I would never --",
        "Tom: Good. Then you will leave, and you will let her come to terms with her son's death, because the longer you stay, the harder it's gonna be on her. I promise you that.",
        "Riley: I'm gonna have to think of some way to explain it to her.",
        "Tom: No, no, no. If you tell her you're leaving, we both know that she's never gonna let you go.",
