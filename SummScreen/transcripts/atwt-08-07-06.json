        "Lucy, Dusty and Damian have a confrontation; Dusty wants to know from Lucinda why Lucy is hanging out with the likes of Damian? When Lucinda falters, Dusty presses and Lucinda finally explains Lucy is trying to help them keep Luke in town by getting close to him. Dusty thinks Lucy should steer clear because what will happen when Damian realizes he is being played; he will want payback. Dusty wants to get involved, but Lucinda thinks he will hurt more then help. Lucy continues to play Damian, while he would like to take it to the next level. She is able to elicit some medical information out of Damian; she goes in search of it while Damian's associate is leery of her sudden interest. Maddie tells Gwen that Will and Jade slept together, but then admits she is all mixed up when she hears voices telling her never to tell. Will tells Jade to stay clear of him and Gwen, as he worries about whether Gwen found out anything from Maddie. Jack, Dallas and Margo wonder about Will and Jade. Henry and Eve realize Maddie needs psychological help. They also know the police suspect Maddie attacked herself. Gwen witnesses Jade and Will together. Casey wants to see Maddie but Margo suggests it would hurt her more. Later, Casey sneaks into see her right after Maddie sees a skit in her head about she and Casey complete with her dressed in a slinky bikini, a preppy outfit and a black hooded outfit, always with one accessory \u0096 a butcher's knife. Jack wants to call Carly. Carly surprises Simon when she joins him on his trip to NY. Carly ends up soaked in champagne and Simon is flooded out of his room, all leading to them sharing a room in a five star hotel. Simon dazzles Carly with a new wardrobe complete with shoes and jewelry. While Carly is getting ready, Simon turns on the radio loudly. Jack calls Carly's cell and is less then thrilled to hear Simon answering it with loud music in the background. After they get home from the police station, Gwen starts questioning Will about his whereabouts with Jade causing him to become very nervous. This leads to her demanding that he be straight and not lie to her anymore; did he sleep with Jade?"

        "Lucy: Look, Damian's a great guy. I'm with him because I like being with him. Why do you care, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Your grandma's worried about you.",
        "Lucy: You spoke to Lucinda about me?",
        "Dusty: She's upset -- you know, about Lily. Holden, he's dealing with a newborn by himself and -- what? This guy just shows up?",
        "Lucy: This guy is Luke's dad. He just wants to have a relationship with his son.",
        "Dusty: He wants to take his son to Malta, while Lily's in the hospital. She might die.",
        "Lucy: That's Luke's decision. I've got nothing to do with that.",
        "Dusty: You're moving in with the guy? What's the matter with you? I thought you cared about family?",
        "Lucy: I love my family!",
        "Dusty: Then why you hurtin' them like that? Why?",
        "Lucy: And how can you, a man who once claimed to love me, think I'd ever betray them?",
        "Dusty: Oh -- well, I didn't know this part. Talk to me.",
        "Lucy: You know what -- I'm not thirsty anymore.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing with Grimaldi?",
        "Damian: You were gone to long. I got lonely.",
        "Lucy: I think the bartender's busy.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, I thought there might be a problem. If so, I'll be happy to get rid of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You are now free to move about the cabin. So, why did you change your mind about joining me?",
        "Carly: Well, you did beg.",
        "Simon: Oh. Did I?",
        "Carly: Well, maybe more whining than begging -- about how you couldn't impress those investors without me.",
        "Simon: Oh, so here you are, you've come to my rescue.",
        "Carly: Tough job, but you did you say that we'd be staying at a five-star hotel, right?",
        "Simon: Well, it is kind of risky. I mean, once your almost-ex finds out where you are and who you're with, he's going to be little bit annoyed.",
        "Carly: You think?",
        "Simon: Oh, is that the goal?",
        "Carly: Listen, Jack waltzed into my house and removed my children without even telling me. That annoyed the hell out of me. And it's his turn.",
        "Simon: So you're officially free of all maternal responsibilities?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Emma has the kids and she knows where I'm going and when I get their I'll tell her what hotel I'm at and I'll give her the number and we won't be gone long --",
        "Simon: Carly, Carly, Carly, it's gonna be fine. Listen, you deserve the break.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I think so too. So, now are you going to pour that champagne or just wave the bottle around?",
        "Simon: All right. So, what are we drinking to?",
        "Carly: Style, glamour, wealth and fame?",
        "Simon: All of it! Oh, I'm so sorry! [Simon spills champagne on Carly's dress]",
        "Carly: Ooh! Ohh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It could of been self-inflicted.",
        "Jack: The kid almost drowned, Margo. Was that self-inflicted, too?",
        "Jade: Can we go now?",
        "Dallas: Sorry. All right, it'll just be a few more minutes. It's a busy night. Just stay here, I'll be back soon.",
        "Will: Well can I talk to my wife yet?",
        "Dallas: I'll check on it.",
        "Margo: Hey, did you get anything from Jade or Will?",
        "Dallas: See, they claim they were just chatting, and then split up to take solo strolls through the woods.",
        "Jack: Well did you split them up to see if the story changes?",
        "Dallas: No, what's weird is the vibe that they've got going together. I mean, she's doing most of the talking, and he's -- maybe you should work on them for a while. I mean, you know them better than I do.",
        "Jack: You think they're hiding something?",
        "Dallas: Oh, yeah. And the Munson kid? The longer he's away from his wife, the more nervous he gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Gwen's still not answering?",
        "Will: She must not have her phone with her. What is she still doing in there?",
        "Jade: I hate that little sneak, Maddie. Why is she always spying on us?",
        "Will: She wouldn't have anything to hear if you hadn't gone off on me.",
        "Jade: How was I supposed to know she was in the woods listening?",
        "Will: Why can't you just accept what I'm saying, Jade? I don't want to be around you anymore. When we're together, we just keep talking about what we did --",
        "Jade: I'm sorry, okay. You and Gwen are the only friends I have. I don't want to lose that.",
        "Will: If Maddie tells Gwen we slept together --",
        "Jade: She won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You don't believe me.",
        "Gwen: Believe that Will and Jade tried to kill you? No, I don't.",
        "Maddie: They were scared. They didn't want you to know that they slept together.",
        "Gwen: You're making that up!",
        "Maddie: I'm not. I'm not -- I heard them. And they caught me listening and --",
        "Gwen: And then they attacked you? How did that work? Did Jade come at you with a knife while will tried to drown you? Oh -- oh, they took turns. You know what, let's call Will and let's ask him.",
        "Maddie: No! Don't! Please don't tell them I told you. I don't know who it was -- Will or Jade. But one of them tried to kill me.",
        "Gwen: How do you know it was Will or Jade?",
        "Maddie: I told you! I was standing there listening, and --",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "[Echoing]",
        "Will: You can't. You understand me, Maddie? You can't tell her.",
        "Voice: You can't tell, understand? You can't tell!",
        "Will: You understand? You can't tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What did will say, Maddie?",
        "Maddie: I can't tell you! Everything is so mixed up in my head.",
        "Gwen: Okay, it's okay. You were just -- you were just mixed up before.",
        "Margo: Hey, Gwen? Is something wrong?",
        "Gwen: Can I go home now, please?",
        "Margo: No, it could take a while. Jade and Will just got here, we're taking their statements. Maddie, I have some more questions for you.",
        "Gwen: Did they see anything? Did they see who attacked Maddie?",
        "Margo: It won't take a minute. They'll be done soon, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Then Maddie freaked out. But she's been doing that a lot lately.",
        "Jack: Will? Why was she so freaked out?",
        "Jade: Me and Maddie don't exactly get along. She gossips about me a lot. And tonight, I just -- I got fed up and I called her on it.",
        "Jack: Did you two fight?",
        "Jade: No. No. Then she started talking crazy like she was answering some voice in her head. And then she ran off.",
        "Jack: She was upset.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Jack: Any idea what set her off?",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Jack: Will?",
        "Will: Yeah, that's pretty much it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Wow. Were you that eager to come with me that you neglected to pack?",
        "Carly: As I recall, I think that your sales pitch for this trip including a shopping trip, right?",
        "Simon: Oh, why bother when it looks so good on you.",
        "Carly: Well, don't get used to it, slick. No, no, no. This time I will pour.",
        "Simon: So you really didn't mention this trip to Jack?",
        "Carly: No. Emma knows where I am, I guess she'll tell him if he asks. What about you? Did you tell Katie?",
        "Simon: No, no.",
        "Carly: But if you'd known I was coming --",
        "Simon: I may have dropped a hint or two. I mean, us dumped ex-spouses have our pride, too.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "Simon: What?",
        "Carly: Well, you're not making Katie jealous, and I'm not making Jack jealous. So, I guess this is a real business trip.",
        "Simon: Imagine that.",
        "[Glasses clang]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You're bothering the lady.",
        "Lucy: Look, it's all right. Let's just go back to our table.",
        "Dusty: Lucy, I hope you brought your doctor's bag with you, 'cause this guy might need it.",
        "Lucy: Stop it!",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "Damian: He's funny. Outside?",
        "Lucy: You don't need to do this. Look, Dusty doesn't care about me. If it weren't for me, his son would still have a mom and he would still have a wife. Isn't that right, Dusty?",
        "Damian: This is the guy? Lucy, that wasn't your fault.",
        "Lucy: But Dusty thinks so, don't you?",
        "Dusty: I think you should be careful.",
        "Lucy: Damian's been nothing but kind to me. He's comforted me and encouraged me. I'm a lucky girl.",
        "Damian: You know, perhaps a night out was a bad idea.",
        "Lucy: You're right. Let's go home.",
        "Damian: Why don't we?",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, one more thing, I'm glad I caught you.",
        "Dusty: You should have caught your granddaughter. She just left with Grimaldi.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: \"Yeah?\" That's all you have to say? You did this, didn't you?",
        "Lucinda: Lucy's a grown up girl --",
        "Dusty: Lucy and Damian. This set up. Something tells me that you're in on it. What's going on? I'll go to Fairwinds, find out myself.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, come on, cool it with the testosterone. Everything is under control.",
        "Dusty: Under control?",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Not from here it's not. Not from where I'm standing.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Lucy's collecting information about Damian. Information that we are hoping will make Luke see that he's got to stay in Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: She's moving in with this guy.",
        "Lucinda: Don't look at me -- that was not my idea. That was some improvisation of her own.",
        "Dusty: Who cares? He thinks that she's crazy about him.",
        "Lucinda: Well, nothing will come of it.",
        "Dusty: Nothing will come of it? With a guy like Damian? What do you think Damian's gonna do?",
        "Lucinda: I think that Luke will see Damian for the liar he is.",
        "Dusty: Maybe Damian's gonna stick around for a little payback from Lucy.",
        "Dusty: What is she trying to get from him?",
        "Lucinda: I think that she would prefer I didn't tell you.",
        "Dusty: Then I won't tell. I'll go to Fairwinds myself.",
        "Lucinda: You know you're a bit of a tyrant, yourself.",
        "Dusty: So talk to me! What's going on?",
        "Lucinda: Okay! She's getting information. She's getting information about -- Damian wants to take Luke --",
        "Dusty: I got that part.",
        "Lucinda: Okay!",
        "Dusty: What's the rest?",
        "Lucinda: All right, why does he want that? Why? He has Luke believing that he's a dying man.",
        "Dusty: So Lucy's the doctor --",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Dusty: -- Trying to prove it's a scam. Good plan.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: We hope so.",
        "Dusty: But it's gonna backfire.",
        "Lucinda: No, not if she works quickly!",
        "Dusty: I saw the way Damian was looking at her tonight. He thinks that she's crazy about him. And when he finds out he got played, it won't be cool. Get her out of there.",
        "Lucinda: I can't call it off now because then he'll really see that something's amiss. And then Lucy will really end up in hot water and Luke will end up in Malta.",
        "Dusty: Then let me help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I'm sorry we ran into Dusty tonight.",
        "Lucy: Oh, you didn't seem sorry. In fact, when you invited him to discuss things outside, you seemed quite pleased with yourself.",
        "Damian: I don't like him.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Damian: He hurt you. He hurts you still.",
        "Lucy: What happened with Jennifer --?",
        "Damian: Stop blaming yourself, it wasn't your fault, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I feel guilty, Dusty's angry. You know, right or wrong, that's not going to change any time soon. But there is something that we can change.",
        "Damian: What's that?",
        "Lucy: Your prognosis.",
        "Damian: Beg your pardon.",
        "Lucy: I think you should come to Memorial for tests.",
        "[Damian sighs]",
        "Damian: No.",
        "Lucy: Your doctors might have missed something.",
        "Damian: I doubt that.",
        "Lucy: But it's possible. And if there's a chance that we can save your life I wanna do it.",
        "Damian: Don't you think I know what you're doing, Lucy?",
        "Lucy: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Damian: No. Seeing Dusty tonight -- it dredged up memories of his wife, a patient you couldn't save. And now you're trying to save me.",
        "Lucy: Maybe I can.",
        "Damian: Mine's a hopeless case, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Damian: I know I don't want to waste time talking about illness or death when I'm with a beautiful woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm in New York. And I'm having fun! And Jack's going to hate this. \"Your new wardrobe has been delivered and unpacked -- enjoy. Simon.\" Oh! And shoes! Oh, the man has taste. Oh, ohh! And nerve. The man's got a lot of nerve. Simon Frasier's room, please. Hey, Simon, hi -- it's me. Where are you? I just wanted to tell you that I got your note and the gifts -- and thank you. It's the nicest thing anybody's done for me in a really long time.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Simon: Carly, open up.",
        "Carly: Hi. Come in I just called and left a message --",
        "Simon: My plumbing sprung a leak! My room is completely flooded!",
        "Carly: Oh, you gotta be kidding me!",
        "Simon: Pardon me while I wring out my shoes.",
        "Carly: Uh! Well, you're going to get another room.",
        "Simon: Oh, yeah, I got one. This one. I like the left side of the bed.",

        "Will: Are you okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah I guess. Yeah.",
        "Will: You're all wet.",
        "Gwen: Well, yeah, Maddie was in the pond. I thought she was drowning. She said that -- she said the Slasher tried to kill her.",
        "Will: Well, did you see him?",
        "Gwen: No. Aren't you going to ask if Maddie's okay?",
        "Will: I just figured if she's here, you know -- then she's not hurt. She'd be in the hospital, right?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, I just wish tonight never happened.",
        "Will: Yeah, me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I'm done waiting, okay. I'm gonna take my sister home.",
        "Dallas: We can't release Maddie yet.",
        "Henry: Why not? Did you miss the fact that she was chased through the woods, and she was stabbed, and she was nearly drowned. I'm getting her out of here!",
        "Dallas: You don't want to push this.",
        "Eve: What is going on?",
        "Henry: Have you gotten hold of the lawyer yet?",
        "Eve: He's out of town. What's happened?",
        "Dallas: Look, I don't think Maddie needs a lawyer. She needs a doctor.",
        "Will: Jack, can we go now? I wanna get her home.",
        "Jack: Just read and sign and you can get out of here. Back there. You too, Jade.",
        "Casey: Where's Maddie? Is she hurt?",
        "Margo: She's fine.",
        "Casey: Was she attacked?",
        "Margo: Casey, this is an ongoing police investigation.",
        "Casey: Don't give me that, mom! Was she attacked?",
        "Margo: Her wounds are superficial. Physically, she's fine. But you should go home.",
        "Casey: No, I need to see her!",
        "Margo: No, I can't let you do that.",
        "Casey: Well, is she in there?",
        "Margo: Casey, go home.",
        "Casey: Would you -- if that was Dad in there --",
        "Margo: She's in a very vulnerable state now, okay.",
        "Casey: I can help, Mom.",
        "Margo: No, you can't. Trust me on this. Seeing you is going to hurt her more than help her.",
        "Casey: You're not just saying that?",
        "Margo: No, you got to trust me.",
        "Casey: Well, I don't want to hurt her.",
        "Margo: No, you don't. Her brother and sister are both here for her now. They'll take care of her. So you just go home.",
        "Casey: Hey, man, do me a favor?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Tell Maddie I was here.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I will. Thanks, Casey. Margo, I need to see her. Sweetheart -- hey. Hey.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Henry. Can we go home now, please, please?",
        "Henry: Just a little bit longer, Sweetie.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Henry: The police -- they seem to think that you faked the attack.",
        "Maddie: They do?",
        "Henry: Yeah, but I -- don't worry about that. Don't even think about that. Where going to get a new lawyer, you and I. And we're going to get you out of here and were gonna fix this whole thing, okay? I don't believe them, all right. I know you didn't hurt yourself.",
        "Maddie: Maybe I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Where's Gwen?",
        "Jade: Still with Jack, I guess. So, is everything okay?",
        "Will: I don't know.",
        "Jade: I saw you and Gwen wouldn't have been that lovey-dovey if Maddie would have said something about us. For once, that loudmouth kept her mouth shut.",
        "Will: I hope so.",
        "Jade: It'll be okay, Will.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lucinda: I need you to swear to me you will stay out of this.",
        "Simon: Any luck finding another room?",
        "Gwen: And she started to tell me more about what happened.",
        "Luke: Like what?",
        "Gwen: Like how she ran into you and Jade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You staged a flood so you would have an excuse to share a room with me.",
        "Simon: Ah, listen, I think I would have come up with something way better than that.",
        "Carly: Wait -- what do you think you're doing?",
        "Simon: I told you. My room's flooded. My pant cuffs are completely soaked.",
        "Carly: I get it. I get it.",
        "Simon: What? All right, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: Well I'm making sure that some photographer doesn't happen to pop in here and take some incriminating photographs. That's what this is all about, isn't it?",
        "Simon: No, it's not. This is not a trick. It's not a ploy. It's just a very fluky thing that happened, that's it.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no, no -- you make things happen, Simon. You manipulate everything and everybody -- just like you got me to go to the Lakeview to try and get Katie jealous. This is exactly the same thing!",
        "Simon: It's not the same -- it's not! Look, my room is beyond use and it was the last available one. Call down to the front desk if you don't believe me. Give them a ring.",
        "Carly: I will. Well you bribed them anyway, didn't you? [Simon sighs] So that when I call them, they're going to tell me exactly what you told them to tell me.",
        "Simon: Hmm, now why didn't I think of that? Oh, I know why. 'Cause it's not the truth!",
        "Carly: Simon, I am not sharing this room with you.",
        "Simon: So I guess showering together is out of the question then, huh? All right, I'll go first. Listen, dinner in an hour, and it's hot outside, so -- you know what? Come as you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You've got to stop acting guilty or you're going to make Gwen suspicious.",
        "Will: I'm through taking advice from you.",
