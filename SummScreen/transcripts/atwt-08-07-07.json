        "Swiss nurse: Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Swiss nurse: I don't mean to pressure you, but you came all this way to Switzerland to check on your wife. Couldn't you just stay for a few more minutes to speak with the doctor? There are some decisions that need to be made about her treatment.",
        "Paul: Like what?",
        "Swiss nurse: If her condition doesn't improve, how long do you want extraordinary measures continued?",
        "Paul: Just keep doing what you're doing and send me the bill. If you excuse me, I've really gotta get out of here.",
        "Rosanna: Paul --",
        "Swiss nurse: Mrs. Montgomery? Rosanna?",

        "Craig: Aren't you going to offer me a slice?",
        "Meg: I thought you got these for my family.",
        "Craig: I thought I was family, at least for the time being.",
        "Meg: Can't you at least wait for dessert?",
        "Craig: Well, I was never one to put off gratification.",
        "Meg: I never would've guessed. You bought the pies, do what you want.",
        "Craig: Well, I gave them to you.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, kind of like my slice of the Worldwide corporate pie, right? My name is on the door, but you get to help yourself to what you want, when you want it.",
        "Craig: Meg, you have got the reins. You have always had the power to say yay or nay.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I want to talk to you about the board meeting today. I've been studying as much as I possibly could, but I don't really feel prepared --",
        "Craig: Don't you worry about it. Whatever Lucinda's got planned, I am prepared enough for the both of us. [Cell phone rings] Excuse me. Hello.",
        "Lucinda: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: Speak of the devil.",
        "Meg: Lucinda?",
        "Craig: What can I do for you?",

        "Craig: Well, I won't be drinking any coffee today, if that's what you're wondering.",
        "Lucinda: So, you're planning on showing up?",
        "Craig: Sorry to disappoint.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. Darling, I was hoping that you would.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Lucinda: You'll see. No according to the agenda, what role do you plan to play in the corporate structure?",
        "Craig: My agenda or your agenda?",
        "Lucinda: The meeting's agenda, Darling. We know that the new bride is going to be the CEO, right?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Right. So, you are --",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Yes. So you are --",
        "Craig: Still on the board, at Meg's discretion.",
        "Lucinda: We both know how much discretion she has. And is she planning on gracing us with her presence?",
        "Craig: You'll find out soon enough. Good bye.",
        "Meg: What did she want?",
        "Craig: She wanted us to think that she would be the one pulling the strings at the meeting today.",
        "Meg: You have no idea what Lucinda's up to?",
        "Craig: No, do you?",
        "Meg: I haven't been in a board meeting my entire life. How would I know?",
        "Craig: Not so long ago, you were partners in crime.",
        "Meg: I wouldn't call it crime.",
        "Craig: You were on her side.",
        "Meg: Well, she wasn't on mine. Okay, so let's just prepare for today's agenda. 'Cause I do not want any surprises that I'm not ready for.",

        "Brad: Any news from Jack?",
        "Katie: No. And no new leads on J.J., either.",
        "Brad: No news is good news, right? Right --",
        "Katie: No news is no news.",
        "Brad: Okay, hey, let's make some news of our own. Have you -- have you met the iguana in the green room?",
        "Katie: Why can't we just have a nice, sweet bunny as a guest? I'm good with bunnies --",
        "Brad: We can always have -- hey, a playboy bunny? I could get on board with that. That would be good.",
        "Katie: Brad.",
        "Brad: I'm just trying to distract you.",
        "Katie: I'm not distractible.",
        "Brad: Are you kidding? You're the most distractible person I know.",
        "Katie: Not right now. All I want to do is hear that J.J.'s been found, and he and Jack are safe and coming home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This proves that J.J.'s been here, right?",
        "Jack: Yes --",
        "Carly: And not very long ago. And if he was here, then Kit must've seen him.",
        "Jack: Carly, they ripped up his I.D'S. Do you know what that might mean?",
        "Carly: Don't even think that, Jack. If they wanted to get rid of J.J., they wouldn't have left evidence right here for anybody to find --",
        "Jack: Remember, Kit's friends with Silas. So is just about everybody else that comes in this place.",
        "Carly: Well don't just sit there acting like there's nothing we can do. We have to talk to Kit. We have to find out exactly what she knows --",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no. Carly, we are going to play this my way, if we want to get our son back. We're not going to confront Kit. Not yet, anyway. We're going to keep our cool and our cover, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: All right, we have surprise on our side right now. Let's keep it that way. We don't want these people to know who we really are.",
        "Carly: You're right. I know. I'm sorry, I'm just --",
        "Jack: I understand.",
        "Carly: This guy Silas could be taking J.J. farther and farther away --",
        "Jack: I don't think -- I don't think they're going anywhere.",
        "Carly: Why --",
        "Jack: They couldn't -- they couldn't have got to Idaho much before we did. Okay, if they were in this room, they weren't here for long. I doubt they even spent the night.",
        "Carly: Then why were they here?",
        "Jack: Maybe they needed something from their friends. Money, food, a place to stay -- anyway, now that they've got it, they're probably laying low. Someplace nearby, I'll bet.",
        "Carly: So what do we do?",
        "Jack: Well, I'm going to go make some calls. I want the FBI and the local cops to stay in the background, but I want them to know what I know and what direction I'm heading.",
        "Carly: I just -- I'm supposed to stand here and do nothing?",
        "Jack: No. You think Kit's going to give me anything now that she thinks that I'm a two-timing jerk?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, I know, thanks to me.",
        "Jack: Well, also thanks to you, she gave us this place to stay. So I want you to do your magic, you get her to trust you and spill whatever she knows before she even knows what's going on, all right?",
        "Carly: I can do this. I can. I know that you didn't want me to come here. But I can make it up to you, Jack. Everything that I did wrong --",
        "Jack: You've got nothing to prove to me. Carly, let's just concentrate on finding J.J.",
        "Carly: That's all I'm thinking about.",
        "Jack: Let's do this. I'll grab a six pack out of the car.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well try not to drink it before you get back.",
        "Kit: Well if he does, we've got plenty here.",
        "Carly: Thank you, Kit. For everything.",
        "Kit: You think he's coming back?",
        "Carly: Oh, I know he's coming back.",
        "Kit: What makes you so sure?",
        "Carly: I got his spark plugs.",
        "Kit: Smart cookie.",
        "Carly: Well, if I was smart, I wouldn't have gotten myself into this situation to begin with.",
        "Kit: Well, you could have done worse than him, I guess.",
        "Carly: Believe me, I have. Thanks for letting us stay here, try to work things out.",
        "Kit: Look, I keep my books back there, so I hope you know you ain't going to get much privacy.",
        "Carly: We'll deal. Something sure smells good around here.",
        "Kit: Well, it ain't much, but it's something. Can I get you some?",
        "Carly: If my husband didn't spend all of our cash on beer --",
        "Kit: On the house. On the house.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Kit: Mm-hmm. We take care of our own.",
        "Carly: Oh, well that's good policy. I suppose most of your customers here are regulars, huh?",
        "Kit: Well, yeah, ain't much else to do around here except for eat, drink and be merry.",
        "Carly: So then you don't get many people just passing through, like us then?",
        "Kit: Not unless they're looking to bust somebody.",
        "Carly: And I suppose you know like the whole life story of all these people, huh?",
        "Kit: Yeah, you can bet I know how to keep it secret, too. You want to go into business yourself, you learn real fast how to keep your mouth shut. Which reminds me, I got to work to do.",
        "Carly: Right. Oh, I know. I know, it's just nice to talk to somebody who is actually talking back to me, something besides grunts and belches.",
        "Kit: Well, at least he ain't yelling. You can count your blessings.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You know, speaking of that, Kit, you know, I happened to see this couple walking down the street earlier --",
        "Kit: Girl, you know, you talk a blue streak. It's no wonder your man needs a break. He's taking a long time out there.",
        "Carly: Yeah, he probably just can't figure out what's wrong with the car. He's a real moron when it comes to anything mechanical. He fixes everything with duct tape --",
        "Kit: Okay, well, I've got --",
        "Carly: He could be out there all day --",
        "Kit: I got business to do, Honey. So, if you want some lunch, you go help yourself, okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'll let you know as soon I have more info to include on the APB. Thanks. No, I appreciate it.",

        "Jack: Katie.",
        "Katie: Jack, how are you? Are you okay? Have you found J.J.?",
        "Jack: Listen, I can't talk long. I just wanted you to know that tip from the biker is really panning out. I can't thank you enough.",
        "Katie: Well, tell me what's going on.",
        "Jack: Well, we're in Manley and we're pretty sure that J.J.'s being held nearby.",
        "Katie: Who's we? The FBI?",
        "Jack: No, Carly. She found something of J.J.'s.",
        "Katie: Wait. Carly's with you?",
        "Jack: It's a long story, I'll explain later.",

        "Swiss nurse: I don't know. But Mr. Montgomery was just here, maybe his presence somehow stimulated her to --",
        "Dr. Cutler: Where is he now?",
        "Swiss nurse: Well, I strongly encouraged him to stay and speak with you, but he insisted he had to leave.",
        "Dr. Cutler: When was this?",
        "Swiss nurse: Just a moment ago.",
        "Dr. Cutler: Do you think he's still on the premises?",

        "Dr. Cutler: Mrs. Montgomery, can you hear me?",
        "Swiss nurse: He's gone. I'm sorry.",
        "Dr. Cutler: How about his contact information? Do we have his mobile number?",
        "Swiss nurse: His phone probably won't work overseas.",
        "Dr. Cutler: In which case, he probably left it behind. And if someone answers it, locate him before he leaves Geneva.",

        "Meg: So this memorandum of understanding --",
        "Craig: Yeah, it just certifies that you are in possession of the required numbers of shares for you to take control of the corporation.",
        "Meg: And that's all it takes, right?",
        "Craig: Yeah, absolutely. I'm just trying to make sure that Lucinda didn't have someone insert some arcane language as a loophole. Okay, can I um --",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, okay, I'll be quiet. [Cell phone rings] Or I could get that.",

        "Meg: He -- is in the middle of something right now. May I help you?",
        "Swiss nurse: I'm calling from the Geneva Clinic in regard to Mrs. Montgomery. If her husband happens to be with you, could you please put him on the phone? [The nurse sees Paul in the hallway] Oh, one moment, please. I'm sorry. Mr. Montgomery, I was just trying to reach you.",
        "Paul: Why?",

        "Swiss nurse: Wait a minute, don't you want to hear --",
        "Paul: No, I don't want to hear anything. I don't want to talk to the doctor, I don't want to be contacted. What I want is a taxi and there isn't one around, so maybe you could call them for me or you could tell me where I could find --",
        "Swiss nurse: Sir, I beg your pardon, but I think you'd want to be informed that there has been a change in your wife's status.",
        "Paul: Why? What change?",
        "Swiss nurse: The doctor's examining her now.",
        "Paul: Rosanna? Rosanna? I don't understand. She said that there was a change.",

        "Frank: Some ex-con friend of Kit's showed up with his wife and kid. Whiny little brat.",

        "Carly: Those guys who hauled him out of here -- they have plenty of respect for you.",
        "Kit: Yeah. It's getting so you can't trust nobody no more. Except for a few loyal friends, you know?",
        "Carly: I know, I do. I know. Good help is so hard to find. So how much did he steal from you?",
        "Kit: $13.26. Oh, no, no, no. I forgot the cost of that gin. I'm gonna write that down.",

        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Katie: But not yet. Sorry. We have a show to do, unfortunately. Do you want the iguana or the martial arts expert? I'll flip you for it. That wasn't a joke.",

        "Craig: Unless you're looking for one.",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Craig: Okay. So get dressed. Let's go. Otherwise, you are going to be late for your very first board meeting. Meg, you coming or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Paul is a friend of Rosanna's. Why?",
        "Dr. Cutler: She was saying his name just now. It's the only word she's spoken.",
        "Paul: Do you think she's going to wake up?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Her latest eeg showed increased brain activity. And we have noted more potentially reactive behavior in the last several days.",
        "Paul: When did you first notice this change in behavior?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Let's see. The 30th of July. Why? [Pager beeping] I'm sorry. I'll be right back.",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have left. I should've had more faith. Of course, the 30th of July -- that's when you first brought me back to the land of the living. Which is a pretty good place to be. It's not so great for me right now, but it would be nice if you were here. Rosanna, the last time we -- we spoke, I guess -- it seemed like you were going to give up. And you can't do that. Come back to me. Rosanna, please come back to me.",
        "Paul: By the way, if you hear them call me Mr. Montgomery, don't worry, okay? He's not here. He's nowhere near here and he never will be. I just had to borrow his name for a little while so I could see you. I came all the way to Switzerland to see you. Rosanna, when we were in -- purgatory, I guess you could call it -- and I saw you, you said that the door was locked and you couldn't find the key to get back through. Well, I'm your key. And I'm right here. And I'm not gonna leave again.",
        "Dr. Cutler: Has she said anything more?",
        "Paul: No. But she is gonna wake up, right?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Her progress is encouraging, but there's no way to tell whether she'll continue improving or even whether she'll speak again.",
        "Paul: Is there something I can do to help?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Mr. Montgomery, there is a new experimental drug. It's only been used in a few cases and we're still in the process of testing it.",
        "Paul: But you think it's worth trying?",
        "Dr. Cutler: The final decision is up to you. But you should know it can only be tried once, and if it fails --",
        "Paul: If it fails, what?",
        "Dr. Cutler: As I say, we don't fully know the long term effects.",
        "Paul: And what if we choose to do nothing?",
        "Dr. Cutler: She's been unresponsive for so long -- in all honesty, the odds of a full recovery are very slim.",
        "Paul: Why didn't you mention this experimental treatment before?",
        "Dr. Cutler: It's been difficult to get in touch with you, Mr. Montgomery. Now, the window of opportunity to use this drug is rather brief. I wish I could give you the luxury of time to think it over, but --",
        "Paul: No, I don't need time to think it over. Go get whatever it is you need for me to sign, and I'll sign it. But let's start the treatment right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hello, everyone. I'd like to officially call this board meeting to order. Please let the record show that a quorum is present.",
        "Sid: Should you be the one running this thing?",
        "Craig: Well actually, Sid, in order to ensure a smooth transition, Meg has asked me to stay on until she gets fully up to speed.",
        "Lucinda: According to the bilaws, the board has the right to a vote of no confidence of a new ceo.",
        "Craig: Only under extremely extenuating circumstances.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, these are extreme circumstances.",
        "Craig: Well, I disagree.",
        "Lucinda: Why don't we let the board decide? Unless, of course, you think that the facts of the case cannot stand up to scrutiny.",
        "Craig: Of course not, but I just don't think that this it necessary.",
        "Lucinda: But everybody in this room has the right to know if your wife has the vision and ability to run this company. And if she does not, they have the duty, the fiduciary duty, to the other stockholders to give her the old heave- ho.",
        "Craig: Meg has the stocks, that's all that should matter. This is a non-issue.",
        "Lucinda: You have a lot of confidence in your wife. Why should you? I mean, she's been frequently let go from her previous job at the hospital for incompetence, ethical violations --",
        "Craig: Since when does ethical violations bother you?",
        "Meg: Excuse me.",
        "Craig: This woman nursed you back from the brink of death. This woman saved your life.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, please, let's not be melodramatic, all right? This woman didn't save my life. Chemotherapy saved my life. This woman couldn't even hold down a job slinging hash in a diner. Now all right, okay, possibly as a figurehead -- oh, no, no, even as a figurehead, knowing how charming and everything she is, do you think that this lightweight inspires confidence?",
        "Meg: If I may speak --",
        "Lucinda: Please, Dear, I'm on a roll.",
        "Sid: Lucinda, I'd like to hear from her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Sid. Thank you. I'm sorry. Of course, of course. Thank you, Darling. All right, Mrs. Montgomery, why don't you tell us exactly what your plans are for Worldwide or Fools-r-Us or Montgomery Enterprises or whatever we're calling it this week. Just tell me -- us -- exactly what you plan to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mindy: Your first line of defense is always going to be self-awareness. That means paying attention to your surroundings at all times. It also means knowing your capabilities and your limitations.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me. Like a woman your size -- your options would be limited if you were attacked by someone, let's say my size.",
        "Mindy: Not really.",
        "Brad: No, no? Come on. This is a martial arts segment. You gotta walk the walk. You can't just talk the talk.",
        "Katie: Look, Brad, we were getting there.",
        "Brad: I know, I know. You've got your little -- got your patter done here, you got demonstration. You know, shake hands, a flip, see you later. But, you know, we're talking about the element of surprise I mean, that's what this is all about. So let's say I accosted you --",
        "Mindy: Well actually, I've been sizing you up since the moment I arrived.",
        "Brad: She's been sizing me up.",
        "Mindy: You are the type I see on the street and I cross over to the other side.",
        "Brad: Because I'm dangerous. I'm a dangerous looking guy.",
        "Mindy: So give me what you've got. Bring it.",
        "Brad: All right.",
        "[Brad gets throwed onto his back]",

        "Jack: Please, please tell me you didn't tell that guy --",
        "Carly: No, I didn't give anything away. But Jack, we have to go after him. He might know something. He hates Kit, he's not even going to tell her that we're asking questions.",
        "Kit: Here's your alarm clock. It's no wonder you were always late. And your gin, if you didn't steal this from me. And your smokes. Or better yet, I think I'll keep those. You can look for the bill in the mail. I've added the cost of a stamp with the added price hike. Run him out, Boys. Make sure you let the door hit him real hard on the way out. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Whoa. And I thought she was just a little rough around the edges.",
        "Jack: Okay, that guy Frank told you everything he knows. Even if he didn't, he's not going to risk getting beaten to a pulp again.",
        "Carly: Think he's going to be okay?",
        "Jack: I really don't care. It's Kit that -- Kit is the one we've gotta concentrate on. We know that she knows Silas, and we know that J.J. was here. We've got to keep the pressure on her. Did you get anything out of her?",
        "Carly: No. No, she's paranoid, and I don't think that's going to change.",
        "Jack: Okay, then she's the one we gotta watch.",
        "Kit: What you two whispering about?",
        "Carly: Nothing.",
        "Kit: Yeah? You were talking about me, weren't you? I heard my name.",
        "Carly: You know, I don't want to jinx it, but yeah. I mean, we were talking about you and how grateful we are that you let us stay here. Because, well, you may as well be the first to know that Ned and I have decided to give it another shot! We're going to get back together.",
        "Kit: Here I was thinking he wasn't even gonna come back. Well, things worked out all neat and tidy and fast, didn't they?",
        "Jack: We just needed some time alone together. And thank you for that.",
        "Kit: Well, good for you. So if thing's are all fine and dandy --",
        "Carly: Yeah, it is.",
        "Kit: I could use my room back. Why don't you two clear on out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Cutler: If we have to call a code, Mr. Montgomery, do you still want extraordinary measures taken?",
        "Paul: Do whatever you can to help her.",

        "Meg: I would like to talk about some ideas I have for the preferred stock option buyout from Consolidated Foods.",
        "Lucinda: Nice do si do. What kind of ideas?",
        "Meg: Well, I have some notes here -- excuse me. Okay, let's see --",
        "Craig: Meg would actually like to roll corporate profits into creation of a fund for a micro credit division.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my God! You want to turn the corporation into a charity?",
        "Meg: Loaning money to women in developing countries to lift them out of poverty -- you can't find fault in that?",
        "Craig: Well, since we're using profits to make profit, it's a win-win.",
        "Lucinda: But how's it gonna work? Oh, okay, it's a charity.",
        "Craig: No, actually, if you would let me explain --",
        "Lucinda: No! Let the new CEO explain.",
        "Craig: Well, you're trying to rattle her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, no, you can't rattle a leader. A leader isn't rattled. But then, of course, she never was a leader. She couldn't even get herself elected third grade class secretary, could she?",
        "Sid: Always do your research, don't you?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Sid, I love you. Note I try -- all right, okay. Tell us the truth, Mrs. Montgomery. Tell the whole board the truth -- you are so ill- informed that you can't answer one single question here unless someone jumps in and rescues you. So why don't you just admit it? You're in over your head. Admit the truth before you drown and take the rest of us with you.",

        "Mindy: Frozen vegetables are the best -- flexible, cold, you've always got them on hand. And when you're done icing yourself, they're great brain food.",
        "Katie: Well, he can definitely use that. Thank you so much for coming today.",
        "Mindy: I'm sorry this happened, Mr. Snyder. I hope I didn't hurt you too badly. I just didn't expect for you to --",
        "Katie: Oh, he can always use a good swift kick in the head.",
        "Mindy: I hope you don't wind up with a bruise on those gorgeous cheekbones. Every woman in town will hate me.",

        "Brad: Don't think you'll be asked back again. [In regular voice] Just kidding.",

        "Brad: Thick as ever.",
        "Katie: Did you hurt anything else?",
        "Brad: Well, yeah, but I'm not gonna put frozen peas on that. I still have some pride left.",
        "Katie: I know why you did what you did.",
        "Brad: Because I'm a jerk. I admit it. I totally admit it.",
        "Katie: No, you weren't being a jerk. You were trying to get my mind off of everything.",
        "Brad: Did it work?",
        "Katie: Definitely. For about a second.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, that's better than a poke in the eye.",
        "Katie: Brad, you can't keep doing these things for me.",
        "Brad: I didn't do it just for you. I mean, the audience loves watching me make an idiot of myself, you know? The ratings will soar. You know it.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, now you're looking for a compliment?",
        "Brad: I know my brother is the one that you're in love with. I'm the one that you love to make fun of. I'm the court jester and the class clown. I've accepted my lot in life, okay. But I can make you smile. I can make you laugh. And I've got the bruises to show for it.",

        "Kit: That's fine. But I ain't no Dr. Phil.",

        "Kit: You?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I took a mail order course when I was unemployed. I can even make a sig -- Singapore sling.",
        "Kit: Honey, in this bar, you serve beer, beer and more beer.",
        "Carly: That's great, because I can certainly do that. And Ned here, he can clean the place up for you.",
        "Kit: What, you think my place needs cleaning up?",
        "Carly: No, it's lovely. I just mean that he can do the carting and the carrying and clean the bathrooms like Frank was supposed to do.",
        "Kit: Well, I could give it a whirl, see how it goes.",
        "Carly: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Kit: Okay, well, I'll give you lovebirds a minute while I go and take some stuff out of your room. Make sure that Frank hasn't been cooking the books, too. Then I'll tell you what I need you to do for me, okay?",
        "Jack: Bathrooms?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I got nervous and I didn't know what to say, so it just -- anything just came out. I blurted it out.",
        "Jack: All right, just shh. Okay, take a deep breath, all right?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: We're on the inside now. We're gonna see all the tabs and the records and credit card receipts of all the people that come here. This is the kind of info we need if we're going to find J.J.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I just hope it's soon. Because even though she gave us a job, I think that this Kit is very suspicious of us.",
        "Jack: Yeah, especially me. So no more hot shottin' it. We can't afford to make any more mistakes.",
        "Carly: Oh, Ned, I couldn't stand being without you. I don't ever, ever, ever, ever want to be without you again.",
