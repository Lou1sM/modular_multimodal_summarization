Simon answers Carly's cell phone and toys with Jack when he tells him she is in the bathroom. Jack hangs the phone up without leaving a message and when Carly learns what Simon did, she lets him have it. However, she realizes it probably doesn't matter anyway, but directs him never to talk for her again. They decide to forget about it and head out for a night on the town. Henry wonders if they should take Maddie and leave town, setting her up with a new identity? Eve thinks that is crazy and is definite now in getting Maddie professional help. Henry then enlists Jessica's help in defending Maddie. Maddie is unsure of her innocence. Eve wishes her husband were there because he would know how to help Maddie. Casey sneaks in to see Maddie to profess his love, and Maddie seems touched but then tells Margo what Casey did. Casey is going to prove Maddie is not a killer. Gwen demands to know from Will if he slept with Jade? Will skirts the question a couple times, but soon is forced to admit it is true. Gwen walks out on Will, but he is hot on her trail. After Mike leaves to go run an errand for work, Kim stops by and asks Katie to fill in for someone at WOAK who had appendicitis. They were due at a meeting in NY and can she fill in? Katie jumps at the chance. Mike learns after the fact, Katie has boarded a flight for NY. Casey is thinking of Maddie by the pond while someone seems to be watching him."

        "Katie: Are you kidding me? I made these myself! One more --",
        "Mike: All right, put them in the freezer. We'll have them for next month's anniversary.",
        "Katie: Freezer burned strawberries? Ugh --",
        "Mike: Baby, it's not about the food. Come on, let's move this party out to the deck.",
        "Katie: Mmm, our deck with very special powers?",
        "Mike: Yes, I built them in.",
        "Katie: Maybe we should call Carly first.",
        "Mike: -- Thing in the morning?",
        "Katie: She quit her job because of us -- [Mike sighs] Mike!",
        "Mike: She quit her job because she didn't want Simon using her, okay? No more talking about Simon. How about just don't talk, period? [Phone rings] Let -- let it go to the answering machine.",
        "Katie: Could be Carly.",
        "Mike: Could be. [Phone rings] Okay, all right. Why don't you just get some more champagne, and I'll just be a second.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Mike: Hello? No, the permits are being pulled tomorrow. I haven't talked to Frasier. He did? When? Are you sure about that? No, thanks, I'll handle it.",
        "Katie: Problem?",
        "Mike: You're never gonna guess who's with Simon in New York.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Where's Carly?",
        "Simon: Oh, hey, Jack. Listen, mate, she's a little busy at the moment. Can I take a message?",
        "Jack: What are you doing answering her phone, Simon?",
        "Simon: Well, that's a pretty odd message, but I'll write it down if you want.",
        "Jack: Where is she, Frasier?",
        "Simon: Well, technically, she's in the bathroom -- but I was being a gentleman. But I'll be sure to let her know you called.",
        "Jack: Don't bother.",
        "Carly: Is that my phone?",
        "Simon: Oh, yeah, you -- you had a call.",
        "Carly: What? Turn down the music. And you answered it? Was it the kids?",
        "Simon: No, it was -- it was Jack. I told him you'd call him back when he lightened up a bit.",
        "Carly: Come on, what did you really tell him?",
        "Simon: What did I tell him? That's right -- I told him that you were in the bathroom. And then, when I said that, he got really surly.",
        "Carly: Now, you listen to me, Bub -- don't you ever speak for me again. You got me? Not ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm heading out for some air.",
        "Eve: I can't believe this is happening, Henry.",
        "Henry: The cops are wrong. We know Maddie. She hates to cut her own meat -- do you think she would do this to herself?",
        "Eve: I'm not sure.",
        "Henry: What? How can you -- I know how they operate around here, okay? This Griffin guy -- he's got Maddie pegged for some distraught victim who's turned into a killer.",
        "Eve: And if he's right?",
        "Henry: I'll get a real job.",
        "Eve: I've called every psychologist on Detective Hughes' list. It takes forever to get an appointment.",
        "Henry: No, no, shrink, schmink, okay? She is no crazier than I am.",
        "Eve: Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.",
        "Henry: She does not need a psychiatrist. What she needs is a one-way ticket out of town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, I'm here and I'm staying.",
        "Maddie: Casey, your mom does not want you near me.",
        "Casey: I don't care.",
        "Maddie: Go, please.",
        "Casey: No. Look, you're innocent. You don't belong in here any more than I do. And I want to help.",
        "Maddie: I don't want your help!",
        "Casey: Well, you've got it, whether you want it or not.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you cannot come near me. Not today, not tomorrow, not for the rest of my life.",

        "Dallas: Hey, don't come in here!",
        "Jade: I'm sorry!",
        "Dallas: Can I help you with something?",
        "Jade: Lock Maddie Coleman up for life.",
        "Dallas: Oh, so you just seem to have this case solved, huh?",
        "Jade: Doesn't everybody?",
        "Dallas: So you must know her well?",
        "Jade: I know enough if you look at her funny, it really sets her off.",
        "Dallas: Have you? Looked at her funny?",
        "Jade: I don't look at her at all. I don't know what set her off this time. Maybe Java mixed up her order.",
        "Dallas: You know, it seems to me that Maddie did something to set you off. You want to talk about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: It's a simple question. Yes or no? Did you sleep with Jade or not?",
        "Will: Gwen, I love you so much.",
        "Gwen: Yes or no?",
        "Will: Look, I would never want to hurt you like that.",
        "Gwen: Yes or no?",
        "Will: There is nothing going on between me and Jade.",
        "Gwen: Yesterday? Two weeks ago?",
        "Will: Gwen, you're the only girl that I want to be with --",
        "Gwen: Did you sleep with Jade? Answer me! Yes or no?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Carly can't be in New York with Simon. She quit!",
        "Mike: Not according to my foreman.",
        "Katie: Well, your foreman's wrong. You saw how angry she was at the Lakeview. She's not gonna go work for him again after yelling at him like that.",
        "Mike: Okay, what can I tell you? She flew to New York with Simon.",
        "Katie: Oh, man, he must have really poured on the charm.",
        "Mike: Where are my keys?",
        "Katie: Table.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Why do you have to go?",
        "Mike: My lumber supplier's dropping the delivery tonight.",
        "Katie: Well, you should. Simon's rich now, he can buy problems.",
        "Mike: Look, you know what? He can't buy happiness. Okay? Carly is a big girl --",
        "Katie: Yeah, who's in way over her head?",
        "Mike: She can handle Simon, you saw that.",
        "Katie: What if she can't?",
        "Mike: Well, then I'm there for back up, okay? But that's it. It's not our life, Baby. I'm not gonna take away time from us or our marriage. I'm putting all my energy right here where it belongs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What if something's wrong with the kids? Or what if Jack's at the farm and they just want to say goodnight?",
        "Simon: So call back and say goodnight.",
        "Carly: You just don't get it.",
        "Simon: Frankly, no.",
        "Carly: It could have been important.",
        "Simon: So he'll call back.",
        "Carly: No, he's not gonna call back, because now he's mad!",
        "Simon: That's a stunning dress.",
        "Carly: We're not talking about dresses, Simon!",
        "Simon: I'm just saying, you look amazing in it, that's all.",
        "Carly: Just stop it! And you stay out of my marriage, and stop look --",
        "Simon: You were saying?",
        "Carly: I don't suppose you got an evening bag that goes with this dress?",
        "Simon: Yeah, actually I do. I picked one out. It's -- by the phone.",
        "Carly: Great taste.",
        "Simon: In all things.",
        "Carly: Simon, from now on, just don't touch anything of mine that is ringing or chiming or vibrating, okay?",
        "Simon: Yeah. Yeah, no, I got it. I hear you loud and clear. And I promise, now matter how much you ring, chime or vibrate, I won't lay a hand on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: I mean it, Henry -- not another word.",
        "Henry: But that solves all our problems --",
        "Eve: By turning Maddie into a fugitive?",
        "Henry: No -- not a fugitive -- an heiress, a coed, an Iowa farm girl. Look, we get her a new identity, we get her some cash. Some cover story, a new passport --",
        "Eve: Forget it.",
        "Henry: Look, these guys want this case closed so they can get down to the nearest donut shop. I have been in that hot seat before.",
        "Eve: Oh, yeah, a real point of pride.",
        "Henry: At least I have a plan.",
        "Eve: Maddie has been hiding and pretending since she got here. Don't you dare mention this ridiculous plan to her? It is out of the question.",
        "Henry: Well, who died and made you queen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You didn't do this, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: How do you know?",
        "Casey: I know you.",
        "Maddie: Yes, you say that, but --",
        "Casey: No, no, look, I can help, but you need to tell me what's going on. And it's not gonna change how I feel. I'm gonna love you still.",
        "Maddie: Don't say that.",
        "Casey: I brought you something. It's a mix of stuff we used to listen to. Just take it, please?",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Casey: And when you listen to it, remember how things used to be.",
        "Maddie: I can barely remember what --",
        "Casey: No, I know how that is. Okay? I've done stupid and wild things -- and I didn't want to face them. Like with Gwen and the baby --",
        "Maddie: This is -- this is different.",
        "Casey: No, it's not. Trouble is trouble. But when I think about the future -- and us in college. Being at football games and going to parties together --",
        "Maddie: Casey, I can't be a part of those things.",
        "Casey: Yes, you can. Because we're gonna be together.",
        "Maddie: Casey, if you don't stay away from me, you can be next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Maddie Coleman and I don't click is all.",
        "Dallas: How so?",
        "Jade: She's the anti-me.",
        "Dallas: Meaning?",
        "Jade: She runs around with butcher knives, and I don't.",
        "Dallas: Well, a lot of people support Maddie's innocence.",
        "Jade: Her type fools people.",
        "Dallas: Type?",
        "Jade: Before she snapped.",
        "Dallas: How's that?",
        "Jade: She'd run around all sweet and smart -- a follow-the-rules princess.",
        "Dallas: Oh, but you hung out with her, right?",
        "Jade: Once or twice. But now I keep my distance. It's safer that way. You ought to do this whole town a favor -- lock her up and swallow the key.",
        "Dallas: Well, I don't think we got enough to hold her to that.",
        "Jade: What do you need, photos? She's trouble.",
        "Dallas: Has Maddie Coleman caused you trouble, Jade?",
        "Jade: You have no idea.",
        "Dallas: Look, be careful -- walking around alone at night.",
        "Jade: That's the least of my worries.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You can't go by what Maddie says -- 'cause she has serious problems, and you know that.",
        "Gwen: You learn to listen differently when you're raised by a drunk, you know. You know, bits of the truth come out half hidden, but still they're there.",
        "Will: I haven't lied.",
        "Gwen: Maddie's in a bad place, but she knows what she heard.",
        "Will: So, what, is it her word against mine?",
        "Gwen: You can't answer a simple question, so I figure, through all the words that you're not saying, the truth is staring right at me.",
        "Will: Okay, it's true. I had sex with Jade. Once. That's all. It happened once -- I swear, it was just once.",
        "Gwen: When?",
        "Will: It was -- graduation night. When you found out that I cheated on the Calculus test and the paper and we had that huge fight.",
        "Gwen: So you made yourself feel better by having sex with Jade?",
        "Will: Gwen, I was -- I was drunk. And I hit bottom. It meant nothing. She means nothing. I love you!",
        "Gwen: So you had meaningless sex -- because you love me?",
        "Will: And I've hated myself ever since, okay? Please, just -- you gotta understand, this was one time. And I love you so much --",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. All those nights you came to our bed and said that you love me --",
        "Will: I do.",
        "Gwen: -- And that I was the only one --",
        "Will: You are.",
        "Gwen: -- And all that time, that lie was between us.",
        "Will: Look, I wanted to tell you.",
        "Gwen: How many nights? Like 50? 60? How many times did you lie to me, Will? Huh? Tell me, dammit! How many times?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not wasting my energy on Simon.",
        "Mike: Much --",
        "Katie: I was thinking of us.",
        "Mike: While talking about Simon.",
        "Katie: Now that Carly's back in the mix, it's just gonna be harder for you to do your job, keep your head down and walk away.",
        "Mike: That's my plan.",
        "Katie: What if Simon pulls something?",
        "Mike: I'm not gonna live my life worrying about what Simon will or won't do. It just gives him too much power. All right, look, I gotta get to the site. I'll be back home soon. And I love you.",
        "Katie: And I love you.",
        "Mike: Why don't you bring those strawberries upstairs for later?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Katie: Hi, Kim.",
        "Kim: Did I just see Mike on his way out?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he had to do some work tonight.",
        "Kim: Oh, is it okay if I come in?",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, come on in.",
        "Kim: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Please, sit down. Have some chocolate covered strawberries and champagne.",
        "Kim: Holy smokes, you celebrating?",
        "Katie: Three month anniversary.",
        "Kim: Oh, that's sweet. I remember those days.",
        "Katie: So, what are you doing out so late?",
        "Kim: Actually, I just came from the studio. Ted Murphy was supposed to fly to the affiliates meeting tonight.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, right. He mentioned it.",
        "Kim: Yeah, except he ended up in the hospital with an appendicitis attack.",
        "Katie: Oh, God. Is he okay?",
        "Kim: Yeah, he's gonna be fine. He's in surgery at the moment. But, unfortunately the other staff is out at that convention in San Diego and I'm looking for somebody to fill in for Ted.",
        "Katie: You want me to do it? I'm not really into PR and all that stuff.",
        "Kim: Well, actually, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, I did bring his complete presentation. However, the important thing is just for you to meet the other reps from the other stations and get to know them. Find out what they're thinking about and tell them about us. You'd be a perfect person to do that.",
        "Katie: And this is where they're holding it?",
        "Kim: Yeah. If you're interested, you'd have to leave for the airport right away.",
        "Katie: I'm in. I'm always up for new challenge.",
        "Kim: Oh, wonderful! Oh, boy, do I owe you one. I hope mike isn't gonna be really upset.",
        "Katie: I'll call him from the airport.",
        "Kim: Well, listen, when you do, tell him I said I'm really sorry for raining on your parade.",
        "Katie: No, actually, your timing couldn't have been more perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Obviously, we need to set some ground rules here.",
        "Simon: Fun.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Simon: Fun. That was the first ground rule we set, remember? Oh, no, wait. The first rule we set was no mention of the word Katie. Whoops. My bad. I always slip up on that one. But after that it was have fun, right?",
        "Carly: Simon, I did not come here just to have fun.",
        "Simon: Absolutely right. You're 100% right. No, you are here because you're a much-needed partner in a very important business venture. But, come on, Carly, work is more than just about more than paying the bills.",
        "Carly: Spoken like a man who doesn't have any. I cannot be bought.",
        "Simon: Well, good, I'm not in the market.",
        "Carly: So then we're clear.",
        "Simon: Crystal clear. My turn? Give me turn.",
        "Carly: If you must?",
        "Simon: Good, I've been waiting for this. All right, no matter how long the hours you work or how tough the assignment I reserve the right -- the right to appreciate you as a beautiful and dynamic woman.",
        "Carly: No! Stop saying things like that!",
        "Simon: What -- too personal, right? All right. How about this one? I expect great things from you, professionally speaking of course.",
        "Carly: You know, spending time with you is like swimming through mud. I don't even know which direction I'm going.",
        "Simon: Straight to the top.",
        "Carly: Let's just keep it simple, okay? I work, you pay me. That's it. No more gifts. No more wardrobes. No more using me to try and make Katie jealous. No answering my phones. No more butting into my life or into my business.",
        "Simon: All right, that's four rules. That is way over the legal limit. Can we please just go and get a drink.",
        "Carly: You're just exhausting!",
        "Simon: It's just a talent I have, that's all.",
        "Carly: Stop humoring me! I do not want to be humored! You know something? I'm really sick of this. I've had it! And I quit -- again!",
        "Simon: Again? You know what? Wait, wait, wait, just stay -- Carly, best of luck with whatever you do. Honestly, you know, safe trip and oh, wait, you forgot something. Take care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Thanks.",
        "Casey: I'm not afraid of you, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Maybe you should be.",
        "Casey: Why? You're not a killer. I want to find whoever did this to you --",
        "Maddie: Casey -- stop.",
        "Casey: How am I supposed to do that, huh? How am I supposed to quit us? You know, this thing that's happening is --",
        "Maddie: They're not things, Casey, they're murders.",
        "Casey: I know. I found Lia.",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you know what, and it was rough. It was. But this is all still so unreal. It's like it's happening somewhere else, to other kids.",
        "Maddie: Can I ask you something?",
        "Casey: Sure, anything.",
        "Maddie: How do you know -- how do you know what's real?",
        "Casey: I know it's real with you. And that what Mom and Dallas are thinking makes no sense. And that, when we're apart, it's worse.",
        "Maddie: What if I hurt you too?",
        "Casey: You hurt me when you push me away.",
        "Casey: Maddie, what are you doing?",
        "Maddie: Margo. Look who snuck in to see me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, it was just one time. And you saw how drunk I was.",
        "Gwen: Well okay then, that makes all the difference.",
        "Will: Look, we fought. And you didn't -- you said you didn't even want to be around me.",
        "Gwen: Don't make this my fault!",
        "Will: I thought we were over.",
        "Gwen: So that's it? So long, Gwen? Hello, Jade?",
        "Will: No, no. You're twisting it around. It was one mistake, not an affair!",
        "Gwen: Oh. So, I should be grateful.",
        "Will: That's not what I'm saying. That's not what I mean --",
        "Gwen: You know what, you cheated on the term paper, you cheated on the final, you cheated on me, and then you waited for the lie to catch with you.",
        "Will: Yes, because I was so afraid of losing you.",
        "Gwen: Look, if you would've told me from the beginning --",
        "Will: I wanted to --",
        "Gwen: Maybe we would've had a chance, but instead, no, you made me Jade's friend. You paid her hush money.",
        "Will: No, that's not what that was!",
        "Gwen: Okay, all that stuff about finding her a place to live, did you guys have a good laugh?",
        "Will: No! Everything I've done since that night was about trying to hold on to you, because I love you so much. Gwen, this was one time.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it was one fight. I was mad at you for like an hour. That's all it took for you to go to her?",
        "Will: I thought you never wanted to see me again!",
        "Gwen: I wanted us to graduate. I wanted to take a stupid picture, to show to our kids. You smashed that dream. Did I run to another guy?",
        "Will: Look, if I hadn't been so drunk --",
        "Gwen: Oh, please. Every lame excuse that my mother ever said started with those words.",
        "Will: Gwen, what do you want me say?",
        "Gwen: I want you to say that it didn't happen! That it's not true! That it's just some mix up in Maddie's head!",
