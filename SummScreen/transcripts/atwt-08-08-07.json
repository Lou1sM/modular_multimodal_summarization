        "Gwen shows Will their first ultrasound. Noah tells Luke that he and Maddie are going away. Allison and Susan bond over their addictions. Lucinda tries to rattle Meg, who walks out of the Boardroom because she won't deal with Craig and Lucinda games anymore, as Lucinda thinks she may have won. Paul sits vigil at Rosanna's bedside. Susan asks Allison to move home, but she doesn't think she should; she wants to start acting like an adult. At Sage's insistence, Will and Gwen decide to throw a party and tell people that she is having a baby. Craig convinces Meg to walk back into the Boardroom and continue her pitch, much to Lucinda's surprise. Noah still can't figure Luke out. Gwen invites Maddie, Noah and Luke to their party. Maddie and Gwen discuss Maddie's new relationship; she admits that when she was with Casey, things came naturally, but with Noah, they seem forced. Allison changes her mind and decides to move back home. Will and Allison talk about Paul's \u0091death.' Will invites her to their party. Meg's spiel seems to sway the Board members, much to Lucinda's chagrin. Meg is voted in as CEO. Rosanna touches Paul's arm, smiles and then closes her eyes again. Paul is thrilled and thinks she is waking up, but the doctor's are cautiously optimistic. They advise him against thinking that this must mean Rosanna will make a full recovery. Allison's arrival to their party surprises Gwen, but she takes it in stride. A tickled pink Maddie figures out that Gwen is pregnant, but then is confused as to why Allison is there. Lucinda predicts that Meg will lose her soul thanks to Craig. Bob informs Susan that she is going to be suspended due to her drinking. Susan welcomes the time off to get herself together and thanks Bob for his support. An irate Allison overhears Maddie tell Gwen about her doing porn movies in Las Vegas. Craig tells Meg to sign the annulment papers, but Meg stuns him when she rips them up. Paul promises Rosanna that he is not going anywhere this time; she is going to wake up and together they are going to make Craig pay."

        "Will: Well, I'm glad they left a message. Your mom and dad sounded like they're doing good.",
        "Sage: That's how they are when they're trying to make me think everything's okay. And they didn't say anything about finding J.J.",
        "Will: You don't like pretending things are okay when they're not, do you?",
        "Sage: I don't know why grownups always do that.",
        "Will: Well, for one thing, they don't want you to worry.",
        "Sage: Well, it doesn't work.",
        "Will: And two, sometimes pretending, it -- it helps you get through the bad stuff. And it helps you remember that good things can happen.",
        "Sage: Yeah. Like the baby.",
        "Will: Right. Did I tell you that if we have a girl, I have her name picked out?",
        "Sage: No.",
        "Will: Minnie Mae Munson.",
        "Sage: Don't make me laugh.",
        "Will: It's good to laugh though, Sage. It's good to remember that good things are going to happen. And keep hoping.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Guys. Is everything okay?",
        "Will: Carly and Jack just called --",
        "Gwen: And?",
        "Sage: We think everything is going to be okay.",
        "Gwen: Good. 'Cause umm -- I have the same kind of news. I just went to the doctor and everything is going to be okay with the baby.",
        "Will: That's great. That's awesome!",
        "Gwen: Hey, I've got a -- I have a surprise for you. Come here. I have -- that's the first picture.",
        "Will: Oh, wow.",
        "Gwen: That, right there, is your son or daughter.",
        "Will: Does it make me a bad parent if I can't really make out where it is? Or what it is. Sage, you wanna help me out here --",
        "Sage: There it is!",
        "Will: Yeah. He looks just like me, doesn't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Hey. Hard at work?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I just wrote a new monologue, and I'm trying to get it to not bite. That should help.",
        "Noah: You're always so hard on yourself.",
        "Luke: Yeah, it's what we tortured writers do. So, what's up?",
        "Noah: Oh, I just wanted to tell you -- you know, I talked to Kim and I'm getting some time off.",
        "Luke: Oh. Well, I thought you wanted to work as much as possible until classes started. Save up some money.",
        "Noah: Yeah, I just needed to get away for a little while.",
        "Luke: Okay. Umm -- listen, you can be completely honest here. Are you trying to get away because you don't want to be around me?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Luke: Well, I can -- I can see how you might get freaked out after I told you how I felt about you.",
        "Noah: Yeah, Luke, I'm sorry. This has nothing to do with you. Maddie and I just wanted to, you know --",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Noah: We just wanted to get away for a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: All those years sober -- I feel like I'm starting all over again. From scratch!",
        "Alison: One day at a time.",
        "Susan: Yeah. I should have seen it coming. I started skipping meetings. I started telling myself I was too busy --",
        "Alison: I don't think I can fool anyone as easily as I can fool myself, Mom.",
        "Susan: Don't you wish we had something else in common? Like loving George Clooney or designer outlets?",
        "Alison: So, we're not like other mothers and daughters. You know, they shop for shoes, and we do meetings and steps. You know, I'm really proud of you.",
        "Susan: I'm really proud of you, too. I want to ask you something.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Susan: Now that I'm finally getting my life back on track -- what do you think about moving back home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Should we give you a little more time? A second or two to think? After all, it is a difficult question. Why on God's green earth should you be the CEO of an international company?",
        "Craig: Yes, when really you want the job.",
        "Lucinda: Of course! I had it.",
        "Craig: And that would put you back in there, into that office where -- you kill me, Lucinda. No, seriously people, don't cross her. You'll have to hire somebody to taste your food.",
        "Lucinda: Oh -- umm, I'm afraid our -- our new candidate for CEO can't take the heat.",
        "Meg: I am not going back in there.",
        "Craig: You don't have to be afraid.",
        "Meg: Afraid? I'm not afraid, I'm repulsed. Look, I know that's your and Lucinda's idea of a good time, but for me, I don't want to be the rope in your tug of war.",
        "Craig: No -- do not run away from her. You will regret that.",
        "Meg: What I regret is that I even let it get this far. You know, I didn't really realize what was going on until I was in there just now.",
        "Craig: And that is what?",
        "Meg: You took Lucinda's company away from her to pay her back. Shoving me down her throat, making her watch someone with zero experience run, and ruin her life's work. You've really outdone yourself, haven't you, Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How long before this medicine kicks in?",
        "Dr. Cutler: I thought I made it clear. This is an experimental procedure. We don't have a timetable --",
        "Paul: You must have a ballpark. Is it five minutes, is it two hours? What?",
        "Dr. Cutler: If it works, there should be some reaction within the hour. And keep talking to her, Mr. Montgomery. I truly believe that hearing her husband's voice will help stimulate the response.",
        "Paul: Fine, I'll talk.",
        "Dr. Cutler: I don't like false hope, but it was really a good sign that she said that man's name.",
        "Paul: Paul.",
        "Dr. Cutler: Right.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Cutler: Talk about him, try to tap into what she's already thinking about. If, indeed, she is thinking.",
        "Paul: You're thinking. I know you are. You're probably thinking -- what's this guy doing here? The one who screws up over and over. This time we're going to get it right. Right here, and I'm staying until you come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Know what I think?",
        "Alison: I bet I'm going to find out.",
        "Susan: I think the sudden need for lattes was actually a sudden need to figure out a way to say no to me without having me jump off the deep end.",
        "Alison: See, this is one of the great things about talking with you -- I don't have to say anything. You can do my part of the conversation for me, decide what I think, what I'm going to say --",
        "Susan: You're not moving back in, right?",
        "Alison: I don't think it's a good idea, Mom. I mean, if I want to be treated more like an adult, I think that would work better if I acted more like an adult.",
        "Susan: I miss you.",
        "Alison: I know. But can you see I'm not trying to get away from you?",
        "Susan: What I see is that you would like me to be a good sport about this, and I hate being a good sport.",
        "Alison: What I want is for when we're together, that it's good for us.",
        "Susan: Good for us? Like taking our medicine?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Susan: I understand that. But next Tuesday, how about a meeting and dinner after?",
        "Alison: You know what? You're on.",
        "Susan: Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: Aunt Gwen, can I tell my friends about the baby?",
        "Gwen: You know, we haven't told anybody yet, except family.",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Will: Why do you want to?",
        "Sage: Because then we could talk about something besides J.J. being gone.",
        "Will: Well, the doctor said everything is okay, so I don't really see a reason why we should wait.",
        "Sage: We could have a party. A telling-about-the-baby party.",
        "Gwen: I've heard worse ideas.",
        "Sage: I'll go get paper and pencil, and we can make a list.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: You're kind of amazing with her. I don't know, you just have this instinct you know when to listen, you know when to tell jokes to make her laugh.",
        "Will: Well, I'd be pretty worthless if I couldn't cheer someone up, right? I mean, I am the luckiest guy in the world. I got you, Minnie Mae --",
        "Gwen: Stop.",
        "Will: And Paul. No, seriously, I've been handed a lot of miracles here.",
        "Gwen: You deserve them.",
        "Will: I just -- I wish -- see, I'm never satisfied.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: I just wish that Paul could get over whatever happened with Meg so he could come home.",
        "Paul: Here's the deal. I've seen this world with you, and I've seen this world without you. And without you, it's definitely not as good a place. Look, when Craig tried to kill you, you used all of your strength to stay with me, to tell me that he had switched the babies. You used all of the strength that you had to do something right. To right a wrong. And we need you back, Rosanna, because your work's not done. Not by a long shot. If you use all the strength that you have, open up those beautiful eyes, I promise I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make sure that you know that it was worth the effort.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're right. You're right about Lucinda and I. We are cut from the same cloth, and it is not very high quality. But your mother's right about you. You could do something with this company that neither Lucinda or I would. You could do good.",
        "Meg: No. I would like to, but I can't, because I have no idea how to go about it. She's right, I can't answer her questions.",
        "Craig: So what? She couldn't answer the questions. It's just a lot of jargon. Come on, Meg, you don't think that she and I even know what we're talking about half the time, do you? We fake it.",
        "Meg: You're doing that thing again that makes me crazy.",
        "Craig: What thing? What?",
        "Meg: Getting me to like you when I hate you.",
        "Craig: Don't do it. Don't do the job. Just get it and then turn it down.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: Don't let her decide. Don't let her do it to you. After everything you've done for her, you're going to let her treat you that way? Go back inside, let her know she's dealing with.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you're still here. Shall I call you a car?",
        "Meg: No. Get the hell out of my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, where are you going?",
        "Noah: We're going to the indie music festival in Door County.",
        "Luke: Cool.",
        "Maddie: Would you like to come with us?",
        "Luke: Well, let's think about if I go with you, that means that there'd be nobody here doing any work, and you guys want to be alone. You wouldn't really be alone now, would you?",
        "Maddie: I'm really sorry to stick you with all the work.",
        "Luke: That's okay. I do most of it when you guys are here, anyway.",
        "Maddie: Ah, isn't that sweet? Trying to be a jerk so we won't miss him when we're gone.",
        "Luke: That's me. Always thinking about others. You know what, I'm going to get some water.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Luke: Does anybody want any water?",
        "Maddie: No, I'm good. Thank you.",
        "Noah: Okay, maybe I shouldn't have said anything about us going away. But he's so intense.",
        "Maddie: I get it. I mean, I remember when I was pretty much alone and hanging out with will and Gwen all the time.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Okay, now this may be none of my business, but I have to ask. I mean, does he look or does he just expect some guy to just show up?",
        "Maddie: I think you're right. I think that is none of your business.",
        "Noah: Okay, look, it's not that he's gay. It's that he's -- he lives in his head.",
        "Maddie: Well, maybe that's why he and I are such good friends. Because I lived in my head for years and years.",
        "Noah: Okay, look, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. I like the guy a lot. But he's -- it's like I said -- he's always just walking away.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Guys.",
        "Maddie: Hi. I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.",
        "Gwen: Well, you haven't. I've been busy. Actually, I've been making my scrapbook of the fun trip to Branson. Ha ha.",
        "Maddie: Ha ha ha. Cute.",
        "Gwen: Where's Luke?",
        "Maddie: I'm gonna go get him. He was just here. Hey, Luke --",
        "Noah: Maddie and I are both going to the indie music festival.",
        "Gwen: Uh-huh.",
        "Noah: You should really try and get on that circuit.",
        "Gwen: Actually, I think my performing days are going to be on hold for a little while.",
        "Noah: Huh?",
        "Maddie: Look who I found.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Luke. Okay, I came down here today because Will and I would like all of you to come over today. It's something in the way of a party, but with a surprise theme.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm sorry. I won't be able to make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mom? You know the conversation we just had?",
        "Susan: My memory isn't that bad.",
        "Alison: It was really different. Different than we've ever talked before.",
        "Susan: Let's keep trying to do that. Or at least try.",
        "Alison: I think I want to give it another chance.",
        "Susan: What? Excuse me?",
        "Alison: I think I want to move back in.",
        "Susan: As long as I live, I am never going to understand how your mind works.",
        "Alison: Okay, how about this? If we can talk about other things the way we talked just now -- I think maybe we won't drive each other crazy. Maybe we could actually help each other. What do you think?",
        "Susan: I think we can.",
        "Alison: You don't seem too happy about it.",
        "Susan: I'm ecstatic.",
        "Alison: Good. Because I'm ecstatic too. So I guess I'll see you later today?",
        "Susan: Okay \u0096 bye, Baby. Bye --",
        "Will: You know what? You're right, blue frosting just sounds weird -- Alison. Hey --",
        "Alison: Hey -- nice to see you.",
        "Will: You remember Sage don't you?",
        "Alison: Yeah, sure do. Nice to see you guys.",
        "Will: So, what's going on?",
        "Alison: Umm, nothing really. What did you get there?",
        "Sage: Cupcakes. For a party. There's Amy over there, can I go talk to her?",
        "Will: Yeah sure. As long as you stay where I can see you, okay.",
        "Sage: I will.",
        "Alison: She's so cute.",
        "Will: Yeah, she's staying with us while -- well, anyway, she's great we're having a lot of fun.",
        "Alison: Well, that's great, Will. I heard about your brother. And I'm really sorry.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Alison: Will, I'm not just saying that. Part of me thinks that I was part of the reason Paul was killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Let's see Gordon how Mrs. Montgomery does after her cram session with Mr. Montgomery. Sort of an instant MBA.",
        "Meg: Ms. Walsh asked me about the Proffer stock option buyout for Consolidated Foods.",
        "Lucinda: Can you remember what he told you?",
        "Meg: Lucinda when was the last time you were in a grocery store?",
        "Lucinda: Oh please, don't start that up from the people business. I came up the hard way.",
        "Meg: Yeah but you haven't been back there in a long time.",
        "Craig: I could give you a lift.",
        "Meg: You know my mother and I drive two miles past a consolidated market to another store that carries pretty much the same merchandise, and we do that because the consolidated store is understaffed and their turn over is so high that the workers don't know where things are. And after you've been driving home after a long day's work and you're stopping to pick up something you need for your family so you can put dinner on the table. You don't have time for that. And when you could only your family out to dinner maybe -- maybe once a month, you want to feel like you're being treated specially, and you don't want to go out to a restaurant where the waitress is overworked and you beg for her to take your order.",
        "[Lucinda clears her throat]",
        "Meg: Look, to increase your profits, you, across the board, cut back on workers, and you hire more and more workers that are part time and are poorly trained so you can save on the cost of their benefits.",
        "Craig: And under Ms. Walsh's leadership, there has been a steady erosion in consumer base.",
        "Meg: And I think I know why. If you want a restaurant or a store that people think is a good place to go, it's got to be a good place to work. And I know that, and I think you knew that, but you've forgotten it.",
        "Lucinda: I never was a waitress.",
        "Meg: I'm not saying what you people know isn't important. But it's not everything. I just have a different perspective. And I think it could end up being a good thing for this company. Look, if you just let me try to make working at this corporation something we can all be proud of -- from the CFO all the way down to the stock clerk -- we could turn things around. All I'm asking is for a chance.",
        "Board member #1: I think we're ready to vote.",
        "Craig: I think we're ready for a change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna? Rosanna! I don't know why I thought I could do this. I couldn't stop Craig from marrying you. I couldn't stop him from hurting you. I couldn't stop him from doing this to you. You don't need me. I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: And I was high and I screwed it all up, so Craig found out what Paul was up to --",
        "Will: Alison, really, you don't have to.",
        "Alison: I'm just -- trying to be honest.",
        "Will: Well I can tell you that Paul --",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, I'm just making things worse. I tend to do that these days.",
        "Will: Look. It's no one's fault. About Paul. Not even Craig. All right, so, stop taking it out on yourself.",
        "Alison: Okay. I'll try.",
        "Will: Good. So, how's everything going?",
        "Alison: Well I'm hanging in there",
        "Will: Yeah, I heard Aaron was back.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Will: I shouldn't have asked.",
        "Alison: No, no, it's not a big deal. We were back together for like, 10, 15 minutes and then I gave him lots of reasons to split.",
        "Will: Ohh -- so that's your fault too. What about global warming, is that your fault also? You to blame for everything?",
        "[Alison laughing]",
        "Alison: Yeah -- you know what? I'm really glad I ran into you. And --",
        "Will: And?",
        "Alison: And here I am whining, and you're cheering me up -- when you're the one who lost your brother.",
        "Will: Umm -- you know what? These cupcakes, are actually for a party, Gwen and I are having.",
        "Alison: A party?",
        "Will: Yeah, and I know it sounds a little weird. But if you come, you'll find out why.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sure Gwen would be thrilled to see me.",
        "Will: No really. We have some good news to share. And I think you should be there.",
        "Alison: Good news? Sounds like a nice change of pace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Come on, all you do is work and then you write and then you just rip up what you write and then you work some more, come on.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'm pulling out the big guns. This party was Sage's idea. And Will and I are trying to keep her busy to keep her mind off of J.J.",
        "Luke: Okay --",
        "Gwen: And Will and I have some news.",
        "Luke: And I said okay. And I'm sorry for being such a downer.",
        "Gwen: Oh, its okay, we're totally used to it --",
        "Luke: Oh you know what? My friends are awful. I need new friends.",
        "Maddie: Hey -- where you going?",
        "Luke: I've got to get that production sheet finished before I go.",
        "Noah: Oh, okay, I'll give you a hand with that.",
        "Gwen: So, you and Noah are going to the music festival together?",
        "Maddie: Oh, he told you?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: Okay. I know what you're going to say. You think we're moving too fast.",
        "Gwen: I didn't say that.",
        "Maddie: No, but I did.",
        "Gwen: You feel pressured?",
        "Maddie: No -- I mean, I'm leaving for Wesleyan soon, so it's not like it's a long term thing.",
        "Gwen: No?",
        "Maddie: No. No. I mean, even I can see that, it kind of has to do with me getting over Casey. That, I thought, was long term.",
        "Gwen: Well, Noah's really nice. He's really cute.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, he is and he gets all my movie references.",
        "Gwen: So you could do worse.",
        "Maddie: Yeah --",
        "Gwen: But something's bothering you.",
        "Maddie: I know that I shouldn't compare him to Casey --",
        "Gwen: But?",
        "Maddie: It's just -- okay with Casey, everything was just so much easier, you know, it was so natural, but this thing with Noah, it kind of feels like we're forcing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Have you all lost your minds?",
        "Craig: I believe there was a call for a vote.",
        "Lucinda: We are talking about making incompetence, and incompetent nurse, the CEO of this company.",
        "Meg: Lucinda? You keep insulting me. But you haven't refuted anything I said.",
        "Lucinda: Oh it's not hard to find fault with things, the trick us to come up with solutions.",
        "Craig: Oh hey I know one, why don't we all go into the baby food industry, huh? Oops. Sorry about that one.",
        "Lucinda: Craig I'm warning you. You incompetent --",
        "Meg: All right! All right. Stop!",
        "Craig: I didn't --",
        "Lucinda: Lily to --",
        "Meg: Stop it. I would like to point out another problem. And propose a solution. The problem is -- that this corporation has become a battle ground in the war for these two. They both know business. They're both ambitious. And they both will throw a common sense out the window at the drop of a hat. Ms. Walsh here sneers at me, for being a nurse. But when you're in the ICU and someone is coding, you learn to keep a level head and do your job even if you're mad or your feelings have been hurt. So -- my solution. Put someone in position that can see through these two, and who thinks this should be a business and not an ego trip. [Board members clapping] Please. Let's just vote? This meeting has gone on long enough.",
        "Sid: Those in favor?",
        "Meg: Thank you. I'll try and do a good job.",
        "Sid: Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: Et tu, Sid. Okay, Gentlemen, always a pleasure.",
        "Craig: Thanks.",
        "Lucinda: I think I underestimated you.",
        "[Lucinda clears her throat]",
        "Meg: I know.",
        "Lucinda: I think Craig did too.",
        "Craig: Oh yes, you're right.",
        "Lucinda: But you have underestimated the situation. You thought that you were keeping your head while all those around you are losing theirs. However, you've signed on with him. So you may keep your pretty head. But you've lost your stupid, innocent soul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Beautiful eyes. I know this must be confusing. But -- I'm here. And I'm going to stay here as long as it takes for you to get better. Cause this time we're going to get it right.",

        "Will: Umm, I forgot to tell you. When I was in Old Town, I ran in --",
        "Sage: Hey, Will? Can I go over to Jill's and see her new hamster?",
        "Gwen: Whoa, hey, what about the party?",
        "Sage: We already did the fun stuff, getting ready for the party.",
        "Will: Oh so the party is just no big deal, huh?",
        "Sage: All you're going to be doing is talking. Kind of boring.",
        "Will: Okay, I think we are depressingly close to being almost officially grownup. Yeah sure, you can go to Jill's, as long as it's okay with her mom.",
        "Sage: She says she'll come get me.",
        "Gwen: Okay, fine. Say hi to the hamster for us.",
        "Sage: It's okay! Will, can we walk and meet them half way?",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. Do you want me to bring a cupcake for Jill's mom?",
        "Sage: No. Mom said Jill's mom hasn't had dessert in six years.",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Will: That's awful.",
        "Gwen: Awful. Well, this is some family you picked out for yourself, Kid. [Knock on the door] Yeah. Oh hey Alison!",
        "Alison: And Will didn't tell you he invited me. Look, I'm sorry, I'll catch you later.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, no, no, come on. Come in. Please. Just leave the door open so we can get some air in here.",
        "Alison: The place is great.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. Can I get you anything to drink?",
        "Alison: Yeah, whatever you've got.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Alison: Kind of an interesting decorating scheme you've got going on here. Pink, the blue, the storks -- are you?",
        "Maddie: Pregnant! That's fantastic!",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Maddie: Oh my gosh when are you due? Are you totally thrilled? Is it a boy or a girl?",
        "Gwen: April. Yes. And, I don't know.",
        "Maddie: I'm so happy for you.",
        "Gwen: Me too. Wait until you see Will.",
        "Noah: Hey we haven't met. I'm Noah.",

        "Bob: I thought it'd be easier to talk here.",
        "Susan: Easier, but not easy, huh?",
        "Bob: How are you doing?",
        "Susan: Trying to grapple with the fact that I have to start all over again. I have to be really honest with myself and I'm out of practice.",
        "Bob: Well, you were certainly honest when you came to see me last night at the hospital.",
        "Susan: Oh, it helps that you were the guy I was talking to. Now let's face it, I'm the one who got drunk and showed up at the hospital and my actions have consequences. So, what are the consequences?",
        "Bob: Well, ever since that incident with Meg Snyder the hospital has been under a continuous and rigorous review, so I had to talk to our council about your situation.",
        "Susan: Oh, sure, sure, you were just doing your job.",
        "Bob: Well, we're almost certain that the Shaughnessy family is going to, after the review is completed, start a wrongful death suit against the hospital.",
        "Susan: Okay. I'm going to hand in my resignation.",
        "Bob: No.",
        "Susan: But Bob, I get it. There can't be even the appearance of impropriety.",
        "Bob: Would you just hold it? Will you hold it for a minute? I'm sorry.",
        "Susan: I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry that I've put you in this position.",

        "Paul: She woke up, she nodded. I think she recognized me.",
        "Dr. Cutler: Hmm.",
        "Paul: Don't you think that means the drug is working?",
        "Dr. Cutler: It could be. We don't really know what to expect.",
        "Paul: Do you ever give anybody a straight answer?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Mr. Montgomery, your wife has been in a coma for over a year, and the protocol we've given her is highly unproven. It wouldn't be professional to give straight answers.",
        "Paul: Okay, well how about this? Do you think it's possible that she's waking up?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Given that she spoke earlier, given that she opened her eyes within an hour of our administering the drugs, it is possible.",
        "Paul: Okay, so how long before she's regains consciousness?",
        "Dr. Cutler: I don't know. I'd be lying if I said I did.",
        "Paul: Right. All right. Well, when I was talking to her, she woke up. So, maybe I should go back in there and keep talking?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Mr. Montgomery? I do think there's something that you need to know. To keep in mind.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Dr. Cutler: If your wife wakes up, if she regains consciousness -- we just don't know how long she will remain conscious.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Don't think that just because she wakes, there will be a full, permanent recovery. There are simply no guarantees.",

        "Craig: Okay, I have ordered champagne.",
        "Meg: You feel like celebrating?",
        "Craig: Yeah, don't you? You triumphed. You rocked.",
        "Meg: Aren't you angry at me?",
        "Craig: Why would I be?",
        "Meg: Because I tore you apart in front of the whole board of directors.",
        "Craig: That was it. That was the moment that you won them over! I mean, look -- I am -- I am a great strategist. But that? That was brilliant. Only that would make them be convinced that you were strong, independent enough to do this more than -- more than anything --",
        "Meg: Or more than biting the hand that fed me?",
        "Craig: Look, by lumping Lucinda and me together, you neutralized both of us. And in that power vacuum, you were the only choice.",
        "Meg: I meant what I said.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Meg: And you don't care?",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, Meg, one of my last virtues is I have no hypocrisy. You're right, you're right. I am vindictive. I am apt to make huge errors in judgment when I'm seeking revenge. Which seems to be a good deal of the time.",
        "Meg: So, if I'm right about you, and you accept it --",
        "Craig: Oh, across the boards.",
        "Meg: What if you changed?",
        "Craig: I don't know, Meg. That just never seems to work out for me. Thank you. Thank you very much, Randy. I'll get it. Thanks. So, I think it is time for us to have a toast to the new CEO of Montgomery Enterprises, Ms. Meg -- ah, there's that tricky little problem with the last name again.",
        "Meg: Yeah, tricky. You know, no matter what I said in that meeting, the board voted in Mrs. Craig Montgomery. They do think we have a real marriage.",
        "Craig: Which means that it's probably time to talk about that thing we just don't talk about. You know what's in here. You know I know you know I know. You know?",
        "Meg: The annulment papers.",
        "Craig: Actually, no. These are the signed annulment papers. Well, at least, they are signed already by me. Now, all you have to do is sign right there -- and this ride is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You're not going to resign.",
        "Susan: But you just said --",
        "Bob: I'm going to suspend you.",
        "Susan: Oh.",
        "Bob: Because suspension is temporary. I mean, we can document that you reported that you'd been drinking. That you're back going to meetings, and the hospital has handled a serious, and yet, not a unique situation. You're not going to lose your job, but we've got to handle this by the book.",
        "Susan: How long is the suspension?",
        "Bob: We'll play that by ear.",
        "Susan: I probably can use the time off. Getting sober is a full-time job.",
        "Bob: I really wish I could do more.",
        "Susan: You -- you have already. Sometimes, you know, the world doesn't make much sense -- but where I work always has. And that's thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I don't get why you're being so weird about Alison.",
        "Maddie: No, you know -- I'm not even going to say anything. I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Gwen: Well no, come on. I mean, what is there to say? I mean, you don't really know her, do you?",
        "Maddie: No -- but it's just -- when she was in Vegas -- now, I heard this --",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maddie: When she was in Vegas, she was making porn movies.",
        "Gwen: Alison?",
        "Alison: How about this? You got something to say, why don't you say it to my face?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Meg: You think this is funny?",
        "Craig: No, I'm just thinking about the boardroom when you tore me a new one. You know what else that did?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: That convinced them we were really married. It's like a real -- a real partnership, you know? Honesty, the whole -- oh, come on, take the pen.",
        "Meg: Honesty? I only married you to get the company, Craig. And you didn't tell me that you were onto me -- and the whole time, I was in love with somebody else.",
        "Craig: I know, I know. I know, the whole thing is just a big sham. I know. It only feels real.",
        "Meg: You make me tired.",
        "Craig: I know. Meg, this is your get-out-of-jail-free card. I don't want you to feel tied to me. I'd like you to be tied to me, but I don't want you to feel tied to me. Just -- just sign it. Just sign them. Stick them in a drawer somewhere. That way you will know you always got them if you're looking for a way out. Know that you're free.",
        "Meg: Like hell I am.",
        "[Meg rips up the papers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, the doctor thinks you're going to come back. But me? I know it. You are going to take back the life that Craig took from you. And together, we're going to make him pay for what he's done.",
