        "Lily: You surprised me again, and that makes me a colossal idiot!",
        "Holden: Lily, this isn't what you think.",
        "Lily: Don't tell me what this isn't! My intelligence has been insulted enough for one day!",
        "Holden: No. You don't understand.",
        "Lily: You, with your arms around Carly -- understood completely. And I actually convinced myself to hold off on the divorce. Never again.",
        "Carly: I knew I shouldn't have come over.",
        "Holden: Carly, it's not your fault that Lily jumped to conclusions.",
        "Carly: Did you hear what she said? She was here to talk to you to maybe put off the divorce. Holden, you have to go after her.",
        "Holden: No, I won't do it. I'm done. I'm through running after her. I won't do it.",

        "Barbara: What happened?",
        "Paul: Happened? She was -- she was hallucinating again.",
        "Barbara: And so you had her admitted to the psych ward?",
        "Paul: No. The EMTs did that. She had my gun, Mom. She was gonna shoot me.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God.",
        "Paul: I should have gotten her help earlier. I should have done that. I --",
        "Barbara: Have you called her mother? Have you called Holden?",
        "Paul: No, not yet.",
        "Meg: Paul! Paul!",
        "Paul: Um, will you get the nurse? Get her to unlock this door.",
        "Barbara: Sure.",

        "Meg: I don't remember what -- why am I here? What did -- what did I do? Did I do something wrong?",
        "Paul: No, no -- look, you're sick. You're just sick right now, okay? But the doctor's gonna figure out what it is, and then -- you're gonna be fine.",

        "Kim: Honey.",
        "Chris: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Kim: Isn't this a little overkill? I mean, they've got him in the restraints. They've got a guard outside the door.",
        "Margo: Casey was really violent. I read the report.",
        "Chris: He barricaded him and Emily in the room. He wouldn't let anyone get near them?",
        "Margo: I don't understand this. I mean, you've got the same virus or bug or whatever this is, and -- and you're not violent.",
        "Chris: I was.",
        "Kim: When?",
        "Chris: With Aaron. I -- I went after him. Thank God I was stopped before I did any damage.",
        "Margo: But you're better now.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Absolutely.",
        "Kim: Christopher --",
        "Chris: Okay, Mom, I'm not 100%, but I'm well enough to sit in a lab and help figure out what's making us so sick.",
        "Kim: Honey -- will you please tell your son that he is in no shape to get out of his bed?",
        "Chris: Dad, if I can sit in bed, I can sit in a lab. Let me out of here so I can help get this thing under control.",
        "Bob: From what I just found out, that could be very difficult.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Nurses tell me I've got to get out of here so you can have some rest.",
        "Meg: No. No, don't go away.",

        "Sofie: You never should have married him.",
        "Meg: You're just a bad dream. I'm locked up in here because of you! Why don't you just leave me alone?!",
        "Sofie: Paul is the reason you're here. Get rid of him, Meg. Finally finish what you started.",

        "Susan: Your vital signs are steady. How are you feeling?",
        "Emily: Where's Casey? Where's Casey, Mom?",
        "Susan: Sleep, sleep. You'll -- you'll see Casey later, okay? Sleep.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Aaron: At least Emily's talking. So it seems like she's getting better. I mean, Alison will, too, right?",
        "Susan: Her pulse and respiration are weaker than ever.",
        "Aaron: So, what do we do about that? Does she need more oxygen, or what does --?",
        "Susan: This is impossible! It's impossible. As if her whole system is shutting down.",
        "Aaron: Okay, but you can fix it, yeah?",
        "Susan: What do you think I'm doing? These are my daughters. I'm doing everything I can. And I can't help them, because I don't know what's wrong with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You got the lab report back. Have they identified the compound?",
        "Margo: The compound?",
        "Bob: We found a, uh, strange element in Chris' blood, and Casey's and Alison's and Emily's.",
        "Kim: Virus?",
        "Bob: If it were, it'd be easy to fight. No, this compound is a synthetic toxin.",
        "Margo: Oh, it's synthetic. That's why it wasn't flagged in the first blood results.",
        "Chris: Exactly. But it's lethal. Someone's poisoning us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, I'm supposed to just run after her, beg, plead, ask her to forgive me for hugging a friend?",
        "Carly: Well, we've been more than that, haven't we? Can't blame her for thinking the worst.",
        "Holden: You know what? I've tried to talk to her. I've tried to explain. But she will not let me get a word out. And if we're gonna fix this, it takes two people to make that happen.",
        "Carly: She has been through an awful lot.",
        "Holden: Just Lily?",
        "Carly: I know it's been difficult for you, too.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Luke came to me, and he asked me to work this out -- to try and work it out. When I think about him, when I think about the girls and Ethan, and what my choices will cost them --",
        "Carly: Do it. Try again. If you give up too soon, you will regret it for the rest of your life!",
        "Emma: Well. Well, hello.",
        "Carly: Don't say it. I'm gone.",
        "Emma: What was she doing here?",

        "Lily: I don't understand.",
        "Luke: Mom, I was following you in from town. I saw you pull into the farm. I had talked to Dad earlier. I had asked him if --",
        "Lily: Luke, you keep trying to push your dad and me back together. It's got to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Mama, I asked Carly to talk to Mike so that maybe he could back off so that we could have some space to try and work things out.",
        "Emma: Oh, Holden. You shouldn't have involved Carly in this.",
        "Holden: Well, I did. And she talked to him, and he understood. And I was grateful, so I hugged her as a friend.",
        "Emma: And Lily walked in. Oh, Sweetheart, why didn't you anticipate something like that?",
        "Holden: And once again, I'm wrong, right? I'm wrong, and Lily's blameless.",
        "Emma: I didn't say that.",
        "Holden: You know what? I -- I hate that I hurt her, and I'm very sorry for that. I hate that I've hurt you and the kids. But I can't go on the rest of my life doing damage control. I'm done.",
        "Emma: Done? Done with your marriage? Giving up on Lily? Holden, that doesn't sound like you, Sweetheart.",
        "Holden: Mama, everything comes to an end sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Enough of this.",
        "Kim: No! No, no. Stop that.",
        "Chris: I just can't watch people we love fade away because some maniac -- no.",
        "Margo: Fade away? What are you talking about? This is fatal?",
        "Chris: Go ahead and tell her. Come on, Dad.",
        "Bob: If we don't find an antidote, that's a strong possibility.",
        "Margo: But Chris is better now.",
        "Bob: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Kim: Honey, it's -- he's just drifted out again. He keeps doing that.",
        "Bob: Okay. Have you spoken to Tom?",
        "Margo: Um, Tom? Tom is on a business trip and his return flight was canceled, so I told him that Casey had a virus, but I didn't tell him how serious it was because of his heart, Bob. I don't want him to get stressed. And there's nothing he can do about this.",
        "Bob: Hopefully, we'll have better news when he gets here. Look, uh, I -- I've got to talk to the health department. See that he does not leave that bed.",
        "Kim: Come, Darling. Count on it. Honey, I know you have to leave, too, don't you?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Uh, yeah. I got to get to the station. This is a criminal investigation. How am I gonna leave him?",
        "Kim: Because you have to. You have to find out who's doing this. I promise you, I'll be here with Casey.",
        "Margo: My baby boy. He'll always be my little baby boy, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily groans]",
        "Susan: Oh, Honey.",
        "Aaron: What happened?",
        "Susan: Her fever has spiked.",
        "Emily: I've got to see Casey, Mother.",
        "Susan: No, no, no, no.",
        "Aaron: Okay, what -- what can I do? How can I help?",
        "Susan: Go get a nurse. Tell her to bring a crash cart now.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Susan: Sweetie.",
        "Emily: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Christopher, you get back in that bed this instant!",
        "Chris: Mom, I'm fine.",
        "Kim: You are not. Listen, we'll let your father be the judge of -- where did you get your clothes?",
        "Chris: I had them on my bed.",
        "Kim: Oh, Chris, you're incorrigible. I want you to stay put.",
        "[Chris chuckles]",
        "Chris: My watch. I thought I lost that.",
        "Kim: I don't remember that watch. Where did you get it?",
        "Chris: You bought it for me, Mom.",
        "Kim: Me? No, I didn't.",
        "Chris: Yeah. You sent it in the mail with that note about the conversation we had.",
        "Kim: Okay, Honey. We'll -- we'll talk about it later.",
        "Chris: Mom -- Mom, this isn't confusion. This happened. You sent me the watch in the mail with a note telling me that I should take all the time I needed to figure out what I wanted to do next.",
        "Kim: Right. I remember you did call me about that.",
        "Chris: See? I'm not crazy.",
        "Kim: You left a message. I -- yeah. I was gonna call you back and then -- but, Honey, I just thought you were calling me to thank me for the note I left. I -- I mean, I didn't send a watch. I didn't send that watch to you.",
        "Chris: Then who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I gave this to Meg. Actually, I lent it to her.",
        "Dr. Michaels: She told me about that -- her something borrowed when she and Paul renewed their vows. She's very fond of it.",
        "Barbara: She's the last person on earth that I would expect something like this to happen to. What is causing this?",
        "Dr. Michaels: I really can't say. We are in the process of doing a full medical workup.",
        "Barbara: So you're gonna move her to a medical floor? She'd be much more comfortable there.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Well, not just yet. If she's on this ward, she's not a danger to herself or to anyone else. And that has to be our primary concern right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I need to go.",
        "Meg: No, no. Please don't go. I'd rather you stay, please.",
        "Paul: I can't do that. Is there something else I can do?",
        "Sofie: Think of something.",
        "Paul: Meg, what's wrong?",
        "Sofie: Think. Think. Look around you.",
        "Paul: Is Sofie here with us?",
        "Meg: No, not now.",
        "Sofie: Good girl.",
        "Meg: Wait. My hand -- it's -- it's cramping.",
        "Paul: Um -- I'll -- I'll get the nurse.",
        "Meg: No. You know what? We shouldn't -- we shouldn't bother her. You could just take off the restraint. That will ease it. Paul, you're right here with me. What could happen?",
        "Sofie: Now, that's the right idea.",
        "Meg: That's good. Thank you. A glass of water would be nice.",
        "Sofie: That's right. Sneak up behind him and put it around his neck. You can do it. What are you waiting for?",
        "[Meg gets off the beg and sneaks behind Paul and wraps her restraint around his neck]",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Meg, Meg, Meg! What are you doing?",
        "Meg: I can't do this!",
        "[Meg sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: What are you doing here?",
        "Susan: Why are you dressed?! Does your father know you're up and wandering --",
        "Chris: I had to come.",
        "Aaron: You need to leave.",
        "Chris: Aaron, all right. I'm sorry I tried to hurt you. I didn't know what I was doing. I will stay away from Alison. I know I scared her. I didn't mean to.",
        "Susan: Listen, you need to sit down.",
        "Chris: I -- I need to ask you a question.",
        "Susan: Well -- no. I'm taking you back to your room. Go get a wheelchair.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Don't let him anywhere near Alison, okay?",
        "Susan: You don't have to worry about that. Please, you need to sit down.",
        "Chris: Susan, this is important. Did Alison or Emily receive anything unusual?",
        "Susan: Well, why do you --",
        "Chris: Did someone mail them something -- something that touches their skin? Something to wear?",
        "Susan: I -- I don't know what Emily gets.",
        "Chris: How about Alison then, Susan? I need you to think, okay?",
        "Susan: Well, I can't think of anything, accept her -- her bracelet her father sent her.",
        "Chris: Are you sure her father sent it?",
        "Susan: Of course.",
        "Chris: Did he tell you he sent that bracelet?",
        "Susan: Well, no. But I --",
        "Chris: Well, you need to call him right now.",
        "Susan: Why?",
        "Chris: Just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I didn't want it to happen. She kept saying -- saying --",
        "Paul: Kept saying what? Meg -- Meg, hey, hey. Sofie? Okay. Hey, all right. I'm gonna get Dr. Michaels, all right? And you -- you're gonna get some rest. All right? I love you.",
        "Meg: I love you.",
        "Paul: Aww. You'll be all right, okay?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Sofie: I was wrong. You do belong here. You know why? Because you are crazy. You married a man who doesn't know how to be happy. He doesn't know how to love, Meg. Cut out his heart. Kill him.",
        "Meg: Shut up. Shut up, shut up.",
        "[Sofie giggles]",
        "Sofie: Silly girl. Covering your ears won't work on me. I'm in your head.",
        "Meg: Stop it!",
        "Sofie: You can't kill me, either. I'm already dead.",
        "Meg: Leave me alone!",
        "Sofie: I can't, Meg, because we're the same -- women that Paul claimed to love and destroyed. He will keep you here forever, and you will never get what you want from him.",
        "Paul: Meg, Meg!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Larry didn't send the bracelet.",
        "Chris: That's it. That's the contaminate. We need to get that bracelet off her right now.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? I said stay away from her, man!",
        "Susan: No, no, no. Aaron -- Aaron, he's not hurting her. He's probably giving her the first help she's had in days.",
        "Aaron: You can't take her bracelet. It's good luck.",
        "Chris: The lab results show a synthetic toxin in her system. I need to get that bracelet to the lab and test it. Let me, let me, let me. I'm already infected.",
        "Susan: Okay. Put it in -- in this bag. And sit in that chair.",
        "Chris: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, you're spending all your time worrying about your dad and me. It's -- it's natural. I understand that. But, Sweetie, the more you get involved, the harder it is for us. Please try to remember that no matter what happens, we will always be a family.",
        "Luke: Mom, I know that. And I'm not saying all this because I want you to protect me. I'm trying to protect you. You and Dad belong with each other. It's obvious that you still love each other. He just made this huge mistake.",
        "Lily: I've made mistakes, too. And I didn't fix them along the way. I just kept plowing ahead, assuming that we would make it somehow.",
        "Luke: Well, you can!",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Yeah. We can suffer through it. We could be miserable, make you kids miserable. Or we could see the writing on the wall and just let it end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lisa, hi. It's Holden. I need to, uh, book a hotel room for a while. No. No, I'm not sure how long I'll be staying.",

        "Carly: There was nothing going on between Holden and me.",
        "Emma: Holden told me that. May I?",
        "Carly: Yeah. The reason I left the farm so quickly is because I didn't want a lecture.",
        "Emma: No lecture. No lecture, Carly. Just -- [Emma sighs] Just a request. I know that you and Lily were once friends, and Holden said that you care about them. Do you?",
        "Carly: Of course I do.",
        "Emma: Then please, would you go to Lily and tell her that you're no longer together, that you have no designs on him any longer?",
        "Carly: I have tried.",
        "[Emma sighs]",
        "Emma: Well, if you really, really care about them, about the family, Carly, please -- please, with all my heart -- please, would you try again?",

        "Bob: You were not to leave your room!",
        "Chris: Dad, there's definitely an unknown substance on my watch.",
        "Bob: You know, we have lab technicians --",
        "Chris: It's the same toxin that was on Alison's bracelet, which appears to be the toxin that was in my bloodstream, Casey's, Emily's, and Alison's.",
        "Bob: Let me see. So, the toxin is -- is passed by prolonged contact with the skin.",
        "Chris: Looks that way. Emily must have been wearing something that contained the poison. We just haven't figured out what it w yet.",
        "Bob: What about Casey?",
        "Chris: Well, if Emily and Casey had sex, the toxin could have been passed through bodily fluids. I got another dose when I was stuck with that needle.",
        "Bob: All right. I've got to find Susan, see if she's found out how Emily got infected.",
        "Chris: It could be clothing, jewelry, lotions.",
        "Bob: Okay, okay.",
        "Lab tech: You asked me to flag anything unusual that came in.",
        "Bob: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Chris: What is it?",
        "Bob: Oh, it's -- it's a -- it's a workup sheet. Psych patient just came in that was admitted, and she has the synthetic toxin in her blood, too.",
        "Chris: What's the patient's name?",
        "Bob: Meg Snyder Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: No! Let me go!",
        "Paul: Meg, Meg -- help! Help!",
        "Nurse: She'll sleep soon. These stay on this time, or you can't visit again.",
        "Paul: She said they were hurting her.",
        "Nurse: They're mostly for her protection. It helps to remember that.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Meg: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I hurt that nurse, and I'm so sorry I almost tried to hurt you. What is wrong with me, Paul?",
        "Paul: Nothing we can't fix. What?",
        "Barbara: Honey, other people are sick. It sounds just like what Meg's going through.",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: Evidently -- has Meg received any kind of gift in the mail since she started having hallucinations?",
