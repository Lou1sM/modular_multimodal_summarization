        "Emily: Oh, my God. Someone was standing -- somebody was watching us, Chris.",
        "Chris: Being seen is the least of our problems.",
        "Emily: Oh, really? What's the biggest?",
        "Chris: There's something going on between us, Emily. And you and I both know what it is.",

        "Lucy: What were you talking about just now?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Dusty wasn't saying anything that you need to hear.",
        "Lucy: You said to my father \"it wasn't Alan, it was you?\" What did you mean?",
        "Lily: Nikki, could you just tell her that Dusty is just trying to make trouble?",
        "Nikki: Before I say anything, I need to radio the police who were at the St. Mary's bell tower. And get confirmation of your version of what happened.",
        "Lily: It's not a version, it's the truth.",
        "Lucy: What's the truth?",
        "Lucinda: Lucy, darling, I don't want you involved in any of this.",
        "Lucy: This has to do with my kidnapping, right?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucy: Then tell me.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, but your stepfather, was working --",
        "Dusty: She does not need to hear this, all right? Come on. She's had enough. Let's go. Let's go --",
        "Lucy: I'm not going anywhere. I think I'm entitled to know the truth.",
        "Craig: Absolutely right, lullaby. Absolutely right. And the truth is -- Alan went to deliver the ransom and something went wrong. It went terribly wrong.",
        "Lucy: What happened?",
        "Craig: Alan shot and tried to kill me.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Craig: And now, he's dead himself.",
        "Lucy: He's dead? I don't understand, why would he shoot you?",
        "Lily: Apparently, Alan was working with your kidnappers.",
        "Lucy: But then, what did you mean? When you said it was Alan -- you think my father had me kidnapped?",
        "Craig: We now know that Alan was the one who hired Dade Larson and Don Creel.",
        "Dusty: No, he didn't --",
        "Craig: Alan and Wade were fighting when I got to the bell tower.",
        "Dusty: That's nonsense. I'm sorry, Lucy, but I'm not going to let your dad point a finger at an innocent man. You think you caught a break when Alan died? Thing again, Craig. You're dealing with me now.",
        "Lucy: What are you saying?",
        "Dusty: Alan didn't commit any crime --",
        "Craig: All right, Dusty. We're all extremely grateful for what you did today. You saved my daughter's life, but now you seem intent on hurting her and I can't --",
        "Dusty: I'm not the one hurting her --",
        "Lucinda: Okay, out. Out, out, that's enough. Out of my house.",
        "Lucy: Wait, I was buried alive today. I could have died. Do you think my father was behind that?",
        "Dusty: That's exactly what I think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I hope you didn't know anything, Jack. I hope when your car went off this bridge, you were already gone. What are you doing here?",
        "Molly: I didn't -- I didn't -- I'm not trying to intrude.",
        "Carly: Maybe you should've thought about that before you made my husband take a killer in without backup.",
        "Molly: I'll never get over that.",
        "Carly: Neither will my kids.",
        "Molly: I'm just -- I'm just going to say a quick prayer for Jack and then I'll leave you alone.",
        "Carly: Jack spent his entire life doing the right thing. He doesn't need your prayers to get into heaven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Welcome back.",
        "Jack: Where am I?",
        "Julia: St. Genevieve's Hospital. Just about 16 miles past the end of nowhere.",
        "Jack: Have to --",
        "Julia: Have to what? Hey, you remember your name?",
        "Jack: You're Julia.",
        "Julia: That's right, I'm Julia. And you are?",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I could just come back later.",
        "Carly: No. That river down there is Jack's grave. And I will not have you here, not after what you've done.",
        "Molly: Carly, I know that you're angry now, but don't you --",
        "Carly: But what? It'll pass?",
        "Molly: Carly, we're cousins. I love you. I don't think this is what Jack would want --",
        "Carly: Don't tell me what Jack would want. I already know that. He'd want to finish raising Sage. He'd want to help Parker become a man. He'd want the chance to teach them right from wrong. He'd want more babies. But he won't get any of that. Because you had to get your way.",
        "Molly: I loved him, too. We're both grieving, cuz. Can't we just grieve together?",
        "Carly: No. No, cuz, we can't. I lost my husband. Not because of bad luck, not because of illness, but because of your selfishness. So, if you're grieving, if your heart is busting into a thousand pieces -- I don't give a damn.",
        "Molly: I think -- I think that after you've thought about this some --",
        "Carly: Oh, I think about it. I think about a lot of things. I think about my beautiful, wonderful husband and how he must have felt, going off the side of this bridge. I think about his last words, and what they might have been. I think about his last thoughts, screaming in his head -- I can't stop thinking, thanks to you.",
        "Molly: I know his last thoughts would have been of you.",
        "Carly: And they came way too soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Don't go.",
        "Julia: It's okay. You're safe here, remember? Nothing is going to hurt you. It's all right. It's okay. You're okay.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, please? Please! I don't want to die! Please!",
        "Julia: Dr. Greenwood! Someone get Dr. Greenwood!",
        "Jack: Help me. Help me, please help me.",
        "Julia: Please calm down. You're going to hurt yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Emily --",
        "Emily: Don't say it. Please, just don't say it.",
        "Chris: It's not going to go away just because we keep our mouths shut. Look, we used to be lovers, okay? That kiss --",
        "Emily: Just forget about the kiss, please?",
        "Chris: Look, I'm as confused about this as you are. But we need to talk about how we feel.",
        "Emily: You want to know how I feel? I feel really guilty, okay? It should not have happened.",
        "Chris: Okay, but it did. All right? Now, we're going to see each other --",
        "Emily: All right. Well, then we'll just pretend it didn't happen.",
        "Chris: Look, if we have to pretend that it didn't happen, then that means that something happened --",
        "Emily: Would you stop, all right? Just let it go.",
        "Chris: We just kissed each other like we meant it. Now all the pretending in the world isn't going to make that go away.",
        "Emily: Well, you better try. Because you and Alison are meant for each other. You are. So just -- for God's sake, remember that, and forget about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hi, Emily, it's me, Ali, again. You must be totally sick of my messages, but I just really need to know if you fixed things between me and Chris. You're late.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I'm sorry, I got sidetracked.",
        "Alison: There's no time to get sidetracked. We need to start looking for that key.",
        "Aaron: Okay, relax, Ali. They haven't even put the evening edition into the trucks yet.",
        "Alison: So?",
        "Aaron: So, we can't look for a key if it's not printed -- the clue. We got to wait for the clue to get printed, okay, in the newspaper.",
        "Alison: Well, you were still late!",
        "Aaron: What the hell is with you?",
        "Alison: I'm waiting for Emily to call and tell me whether or not Chris still wants to get married. She's not picking up. I don't even know where she is.",
        "Aaron: Old Town.",
        "Alison: You saw her there? Was she with Chris? What did he look like? Did it look like she was making an impression on him?",
        "Aaron: Um -- yeah.",
        "Alison: Well, what kind? Is it good or bad?",
        "Aaron: Alison, there's something I have to tell you about your future husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Sweetness, Dusty couldn't know anything, he wasn't there.",
        "Dusty: Before Don Creel died, he told me that your father was the one behind the kid --",
        "Craig: We know he meant stepfather.",
        "Dusty: Well, he didn't say stepfather.",
        "Lily: He was a dying man, forgive him if he forgot a syllable.",
        "Lucinda: The gun that killed Creel, my paper reported on it. It's registered to you, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, my gun, kept it at the club. Your dad had access to it.",
        "Craig: Half of Oakdale has access. Thank you, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Listen. You remember -- do you remember when I was trying to get you back to your dad? Two people knew where you were. Craig --",
        "Craig: And Alan! An itinerate sailor we know nothing about.",
        "Dusty: So your father, or stepfather, told Creel where you were. And Creel never said anything about a guy name Alan.",
        "Lily: You're not mentioning Craig's alibi. The police believe whoever killed Creel was behind your kidnapping. I heard your father singing in the shower while Creel laid dying miles away.",
        "Lucy: You did?",
        "Lily: Yes, I did. Your father is not behind this. And he certainly did not have you buried alive today.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe he didn't order Wade to treat Lucy like a sandbox toy, but you were definitely involved.",
        "Craig: Okay, Dusty, I think we've all had enough now.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, stop.",
        "Dusty: You know, Wade left a lot of money behind in Reno 'cause of me. And I bet he then came looking for you to make good, but you were tapped. So what does he do? He grabs Lucy for real, this time, 'cause he knows the family's gonna pay up.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean he grabbed me for real?",
        "Dusty: Do you remember -- do you remember when you were leaving town, leaving Oakdale, and you and your old man were on the outs, you weren't speaking? He just wanted to rescue you again so he could be your hero again.",
        "Lucy: My father would never have me kidnapped.",
        "Dusty: Think about all the things your father's done when his back's been against the wall and tell me you really believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't want to hear it.",
        "Aaron: It's about your fianc\u00e9.",
        "Alison: Who you are so down on.",
        "Aaron: It's not even about that.",
        "Alison: I know what it's about and I love him. And it doesn't matter whether or not you think that Chris and I are right for each other, because we are.",
        "Aaron: Then why'd you send Emily to go talk to him? Okay, why not talk to Chris yourself if everything's just so perfect?",
        "Alison: Because I'm a big loser, okay? And I needed my sister to go and help fix things between me and my fianc\u00e9, okay?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Well, that was a mistake.",
        "Alison: And she's going to make him wish that all of this stupid fight didn't even happen.",
        "Aaron: You need to deal with Chris yourself, okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I will, after we're married. But if Emily doesn't help, then this wedding might not even happen.",
        "Aaron: Maybe that's a sign, Ali. Maybe that's a sign you guys should just call it off.",
        "Alison: You're supposed to be my friend. My best friend, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: That's what I'm trying to be, Ali.",
        "Alison: Well, you're doing a lousy job. You're always doubting him. And you know what? Chris loves me. The good, the bad -- everything.",
        "Aaron: And that's why he's such a hero? Because he loves you? Chris loves you? What is so hard about loving you?",
        "Alison: Oh, please. I'm not the kind of person that someone falls in love with. Even you hated me a year ago.",
        "Aaron: All I'm saying is that you're all grown up now. And you deserve to be treated with respect and honesty.",
        "Alison: And I am. And no one is more honest than Christopher Robert Hughes.",
        "Aaron: You really think so?",
        "Alison: Yes, I do. And if you're going to keep trying to make me doubt him, then you can just shut your mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Greenwood: He seems to have calmed down. Now, what exactly happened?",
        "Julia: He just panicked.",
        "Dr. Greenwood: Well, clearly, our John Doe went through something pretty awful. He'll probably go in and out of consciousness for a while. Keep a close eye on him. Don't push him to talk.",
        "Julia: What happened to you, mystery man? Your clothes were all torn. Your lungs were half filled up with water.",
        "Jack: Water.",
        "Julia: Do you want some water?",
        "Jack: No, I -- I remember water. Why?",
        "Julia: Probably because you were found on the banks of the river, nearly drowned. You had a concussion, broken ribs. No, no, no, don't try and sit up. Please. Lacerations. It's a really good sign that you remember water. Do you remember anything else?",
        "Jack: One other thing. Yeah.",
        "Julia: What's that?",
        "Jack: You. I remember Julia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Oh, great. Just me and the same four walls.",
        "Holden: Hey, Molly.",
        "Molly: Hey.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Molly: Yeah. It's just, you know, I haven't been back here since --",
        "Holden: Yeah. You forgot some stuff at the house.",
        "Molly: Oh, thanks. Do you remember that book that you gave me? I was reading it. Did I leave it there?",
        "Holden: I think that it's in the car. I'll go get it.",
        "Molly: No, actually -- I'd rather you stayed.",
        "Holden: I really don't think that I'd be very good company.",
        "Molly: Yeah. Yeah, I know, me either. I mean, I was just at the bridge and Carly -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. How are you doing?",
        "Holden: All right. Rough day.",
        "Molly: It's a little more than rough, Holden.",
        "Holden: Yeah. On top of everything else that happened, my niece Lucy was kidnapped.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: She's home. She's safe. But during the worst of it, when things looked really bad, I picked up the phone and I started to call jack. I wanted him to help out. And then it hit me, he can't answer. We had our last conversation and I didn't even know it. My cousin is dead, Molly, and I never got to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You can't be right.",
        "Craig: He's not.",
        "Dusty: I wish it wasn't true. I really do.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, it's my father.",
        "Dusty: Your father did a very bad thing.",
        "Craig: All right, enough?",
        "Lucinda: Okay, that is enough. You've just said it. That's more than enough. Now you two, you settle your differences someplace else. My granddaughter is not going to be your battlefield. Sweetheart, I'm going to get Sierra and bring her back.",
        "Lily: I think you should try the morgue.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, God. Take care of Lucy until I get back.",
        "Lily: I will. I will. Come on, let's go upstairs. Have a hot bath.",
        "Lucy: A bath is not going to fix this. Why did you wait until now to tell me all of this?",
        "Dusty: I was trying to protect you. You know, I didn't want the information to be true.",
        "Lucy: Well, how long have you had these suspicions? Days? Weeks? Months? What?",
        "Dusty: For a while. Listen, you gotta know that, you gotta know that I didn't want to hurt you. You remember Reno, when you walked into Wade's room? I had to kick him in the head before he said your father's name, remember? Because I didn't want you to hear.",
        "Lily: Who's playing hero now?",
        "Craig: Alan was the so-called brains behind this nightmare. Why do you think that Wade insisted that Alan, and only Alan, bring the money?",
        "Lucy: What exactly happened at that bell tower?",
        "Lily: I think she should know everything.",
        "Craig: I saw Alan and Wade fighting over the money.",
        "Alan: I don't care about Craig.",
        "Wade: You should, 'cause he was the one that ordered me and Donnie to snatch her the first time. It's true. She was on her way and he wanted to play hero for his kid one last time.",
        "Craig: They were just going to run off and let you die.",
        "Alan: Oh my God. Montgomery, so you had Lucy kidnapped?",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, Alan! He's out for money. He's going to say anything!",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, you can tell that to the police.",
        "Craig: I went at Alan and he fired at me.",
        "Lily: That's when I showed up. I saw Alan shoot your father. I tried to stop him. I tried to get the gun away from Alan and he pushed me to the ground. And then, saw Wade shot Alan. Twice.",
        "Lucy: And he died?",
        "Craig: I did what I could, lullaby, but there was no saving him.",
        "Lily: Wade then turned the gun on your father and me. And your father begged him, begged him, to tell us where you were. He was going to sacrifice his own life just to have Wade tell me where you were. But he said it would be too late.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, you could have died trying to save me.",
        "Craig: If I lost you, there's no point in living.",
        "Dusty: Montgomery, a hero. Alan Drake dies a bum.",
        "Lily: Wade was going to take me as a hostage and your father lunged at him.",
        "Craig: Well, there was nothing I could do.",
        "Lily: Wade went out the window and I went along with him. If it wasn't for your father, I would be dead right now. He took a bullet in the arm, and he used that arm to pull me up to safety and I'm alive today because of him. Your father couldn't and he wouldn't, wouldn't hurt you. And you know he need to make up some story to look like a hero! He is a hero.",
        "Craig: We think Alan was after your money.",
        "Dusty: Alan Drake had plenty of money. And he loved your mother.",
        "Lily: There is evidence proving what your father has said is true. I have seen it.",
        "Craig: Wade tried to kidnap you once. When he failed. He tried again.",
        "Lucy: So, you were wrong. You said all those awful things and you were wrong.",
        "Dusty: I wasn't wrong. Lily arrived in the middle of things. She's not a witness. She doesn't know what went down before the shooting! Three people know the truth. Your father, your step-father and Wade Larsen. Two of them are dead.",
        "Craig: I love you more than anything. You know that.",
        "Lucinda: Lucy, darling, come on. Immediately. Your mother needs you. It's absolutely amazing!",
        "Lucy: What happened?",
        "Lucinda: It's Alan, darling.",
        "Craig: Alan?",
        "Lucinda: Alan. It's mind-boggling. He lived. He's alive.",

        "Nikki: It was touch and go. The EMTs revived him in the ambulance.",
        "Lily: Well, how is he?",
        "Nikki: Critical.",
        "Lucinda: Come on, darling. Your mother wants to see you at the hospital.",
        "Dusty: Is he conscious?",
        "Nikki: No. And he is not going to be questioned for a while.",
        "Lucinda: Well, we can all wait to give our statements, can't we? Come on. Come, right now. Lucy, now.",
        "Lucy: Bye, Daddy.",
        "Lucinda: Come, darling. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: You'd better say your prayers tonight.",
        "Craig: I'll be praying for his complete recovery.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I bet. It'll certainly be interesting to hear what he has to say.",
        "Craig: Won't it, though?",
        "Lily: Sorry about that. The last thing you need is Dusty hounding you right now.",
        "Craig: No. I'm just concerned about Alan.",
        "Lily: Well, this is good news. He can finally tell everybody the truth.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Let's get to the hospital. I think I'd like to be there when he wakes up.",

        "Julia: It not an unusual one.",
        "Jack: No, it's not just the name, Julia. It's that you're a nurse. And you always wanted to be a nurse. Right? How? How would I know that? We meant something to each other once. Something powerful.",
        "Julia: You remember all that, but you don't remember your own name?",
        "Jack: My name isn't important!",
        "Julia: It is important. Listen to me, okay? You were found by the banks of the river with no identification.",

        "Dr. Greenwood: I understand that. Normally that'd be the right thing to do, but this patient is easily agitated. And with the kind of injuries he sustained, I don't want him upset. So, follow his lead. Whatever he says, just nod and agree. Understood?",

        "Alison: But --",
        "Aaron: No, no, but. Come on, we've got to get a head start on the Kevin kid. Come on, let's do this. Hurry up. Get off the phone.",
        "Alison: I know, I know, I know. Just let me call Emily once more. [Alison sighs] Okay, then why don't you go get the paper, bring it back. By the time you get back, I'll be done.",
        "Aaron: Fine.",
        "Alison: Emily. I'm calling to see if I'm still engaged. He hates me.",
        "Chris: Who hates you? I'll kill 'em.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Chris! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Chris: Alison, you don't have anything to apologize for.",
        "Alison: How did you know I was here?",
        "Chris: Gram. Gram told me.",
        "Alison: Are you still mad? I know I made a really big deal about the wedding. And I thought about it and I don't even care if we get married on a pig farm.",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Alison: I just want to get married to you.",
        "Chris: Me, too, Alison, but first I have to --",
        "Alison: Yes?",
        "Chris: We can't fight anymore, okay? 'Cause bad things happen when we fight. I don't ever want to do it again.",
        "Alison: Me neither. Not ever, ever, ever.",

        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I should've been here for you.",
        "Hal: No, no. I told you before, Emily, it was business.",
        "Emily: No, it wasn't. It was family. It was you saying good-bye to your best friend, and trying to help your son cope with the death of his stepfather. And that is not business. That is family and I should have been here for you. Or not? I'll see you later.",
        "Hal: Emily, don't.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Hal: Please. Just try to understand, if I start talking about losing Jack, or coming close to losing Parker -- I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: No, please don't apologize to me. Don't apologize to me.",
        "Hal: No. It's tough to watch a cop go down, especially when you're married to one. I should've realized this was your first time.",
        "Emily: I know. I'm sorry. Oh, Hal, I'm sorry. God, if I could live the last 24 hours again, I would.",

        "Molly: You're not \"some guy.\" Jack was your cousin. And your best friend. And when he died, all the things that you shared died with him. You're allowed a few tears.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I got responsibilities; I can't give in to grief.",
        "Molly: Well, you know what? You can't avoid it. You can't go around it. And you can't go under it. You just got to go through it. And I'll help you do that.",

        "Dusty: What's your answer for that? Why'd you go against the kidnapper's instructions?",

        "Alison: I haven't told you any lies lately.",
        "Chris: No, it's not --",
        "Alison: No, wait, I know, I know. I've been so crazy about this wedding and I've been so silly about the \"keys to the kingdom\" contest, but I won't be like that anymore. Okay? I'll be mature, I'll be like Emily.",
        "Chris: Alison, you have every right to make a big deal about our wedding and to get excited about the contest, okay? What happened -- it was my fault.",
        "Alison: What happened? Please don't tell me that it's something bad, that this is all just a dream. Because, Chris, I don't want to wake up tomorrow and be without you. What is it?",

        "Carly: It was supposed to last a lifetime. I suppose it did.",
        "Mike: Aren't you glad you did it, though?",
        "Carly: In a way. But I have two children to raise. Alone. I don't have a very secure career. I just think, why couldn't I have just been practical for once in my life and put that money away?",
        "Mike: Because you're Carly. Which means you live life like you might die tomorrow. Which is one of the things that Jack loved about you. The way you are, the way you think is what made him so happy.",
        "Carly: I just imagined Jack teaching Parker how to drive this car. Picture the two of them washing it in the driveway. Those dreams will never happen now.",
