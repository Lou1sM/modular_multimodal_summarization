        "Luke talks to Holden about Keith taking him flying. Lily talks to Keith about his feelings on Luke flying. Holden tells a shocked Lily (Luke and Keith) that he thinks it is a good idea, and later admits he also wants Luke to like Keith if he is going to be a part of her life. Casey is angry with Gwen when he finds out that she wants to reclaim her baby. Margo overhears Casey and Gwen arguing about the baby. Jack tries to reach a compromise with Gwen about her baby. Carly decides to christen the baby, and asks Emily if she and Paul will be the baby's godparents. Carly gears up for a war with Gwen. Paul thinks he may have uncovered something when he sees the baby footprints don't match. He talks with the neonatal nurse about the other nurse that quit the night Jen's baby was born. He thinks it is more then coincidental that Rosanna was inquiring about her baby that night of her accident. Jen walks in on the Paul's meeting with the nurse, and he has to cover. He later makes arrangements to visit Craig to get to the bottom of the situation."

        "Luke: Dad -- glad you found the place.",
        "Holden: Why'd you want to meet me down here?",
        "Luke: Neutral ground, I guess.",
        "Holden: Maybe we should have met over at Yo's and pow-wowed over a couple of shots.",
        "Luke: Dad, I know, I messed up, okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, you did. And thank God you got hauled down to the station instead of getting into a car with your so-called friends and ending up wrapped around a tree.",
        "Luke: Dad!",
        "Holden: Come on, Luke. You've got more going on for you than that. You know better!",
        "Luke: I said, I know I messed up! Okay? Could you cut me some slack?",
        "Holden: I have been cutting you slack! I know that these past few months have been very difficult for you. But that does not give you a blank check to go out and do --",
        "Luke: Dad, believe me -- I get it. Would this be the worst time to ask you for a favor?",
        "Holden: You're kidding, right?",
        "Luke: No. I need you to talk to Mom. About Keith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh. Good, you came. Thank you.",
        "Keith: I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Your mother doesn't like me.",
        "Lily: My mother's not here. She's at her oncologist. Have you tried to sort through insurance claim forms? You need a special degree.",
        "Keith: How's your mother doing?",
        "Lily: She's tired. She's hopeful. And she's more scared than she admits. I guess that's to be expected. Thank you for asking.",
        "Keith: So, you called me, remember?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out where we stand. The two of us. We left things a little weird after what happened with Luke.",
        "Keith: A little weird? You basically told me you don't trust me with your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, what are you doing here?",
        "Jennifer: I live here?",
        "Barbara: Well, of course, you live here. I just didn't expect to see you here. Not now, at least.",
        "Bellman: Do you want me to take these downstairs, Ms. Ryan?",
        "Barbara: Yes, that would be so great.",
        "Jennifer: What is all that?",
        "Barbara: Oh, just some stuff that I thought that we'd move down into storage now that you're living back at home -- give us some more room. Yes, thank you very much. And we can have some breakfast.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not hungry, Mother. And stop trying to feed me. Could you wait a second? Now are you going to tell me what you're up to?",
        "Barbara: And why do you think I'm up to something?",
        "Jennifer: Because our suite would fit all of this stuff and more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: One baby, same foot, different prints. Rosanna, this is what you were trying to tell me.",
        "Emily: Hey -- what, you stay up all night? What? What's going on? What was that? What's going on? I thought we weren't going to keep any secrets from each other.",
        "Paul: I think maybe something shady happened with Jennifer's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I'm sorry she's sick, but I just can't take her hours today.",
        "Diner manager: You've been bugging me for extra shifts for weeks.",
        "Gwen: I know, but I don't need them anymore. Matter of fact, I might not need to work here at all anymore.",
        "Diner manager: You hit the lottery or something?",
        "Casey: I really need to talk to you.",
        "Diner manager: I'm going to call Darla. She might actually appreciate the extra work.",
        "Gwen: What crawled up your pants?",
        "Casey: So I hear my folks talking this morning, and they say something about you wanting to get the baby back. Are you nuts?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: She was just awful, Jack.",
        "Jack: She told you our home wasn't good enough for her baby?",
        "Carly: In between threatening me and making demands, yes. Who does that little kid think she is?",
        "Jack: She's probably feeling threatened.",
        "Carly: What in the world can she possibly have to feel threatened about? She's the one who marched in here demanding to take the baby back!",
        "Jack: She actually said that she wanted the baby back? She already signed the papers.",
        "Carly: Gwen told me that she has 30 days to change her mind. Which to me makes it sound like that beautiful baby is more like a pair of shoes.",
        "Jack: Okay. All right, why don't we just step back, take a breath and think this through.",
        "Carly: I have thought about it, Jack. And the more I think about it, the more infuriating it is. Like that child has any idea what it takes to take care of a baby.",
        "Jack: How old is she?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I didn't even ask her. When she was holding the baby, she was staring like it's the first time she'd even seen one. I'm telling you, she cannot look after him. Which is why I have a call in to one of Rosanna's lawyers.",
        "Jack: You got an attorney involved?",
        "Carly: Absolutely. Jack, we need a restraining order or something. I want this Gwen Norbeck as far away from us and that little baby as she can possibly get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: These are just some things that I had for you that I never got a chance to give you. And this little outfit was one of them. I just thought we should put them down in storage.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Barbara: Because I don't think it's healthy to have them around where you can dwell on them.",
        "Jennifer: Why put them in storage? Why don't you just get rid of them?",
        "Barbara: Because, honey, someday you'll want these things. You're going to have more children. You're going to have a little boy, a little girl --",
        "Jennifer: No, don't say that. I don't want another child, I want my baby!",
        "Barbara: Honey -- I know how painful this is for you. And I know that you're hurting and I know that your hormones are still raging, but you know, you will get through this. It will feel better than it does today, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Don't say that this is my hormones, Mother. And please don't tell me what I will or won't do. Just get rid of these baby things.",
        "Barbara: Jen, Jen --",
        "Margo: I guess she's still pretty emotional, huh?",
        "Barbara: I guess you're not here to see me.",
        "Margo: No. I had to come pick up a check from Lisa for the Police Benevolent Association. But I couldn't help overhearing you talking about some baby clothes.",
        "Barbara: I keep telling myself that she's going to get through this. But she's in as much pain as she was the day he died.",
        "Margo: Well, in the meantime, couldn't Will's child use the clothes?",
        "Barbara: You need to get out more. Get out from behind that desk, because Will is the father of no one's child.",
        "Margo: He's not? Well, I thought Casey said that --",
        "Barbara: It was a misguided attempt to help out a friend. He felt sorry for the girl and she took advantage of his good nature.",
        "Margo: Well, I guess you're relieved.",
        "Barbara: Can you imagine? Can you imagine if Will had been the father of this child? He would have ruined his life.",
        "Margo: Excuse me, but if Will isn't the father, did he say who was?",
        "Barbara: I didn't ask, Margo. And as long as it's not my son, I couldn't care less.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Tell me it's not true. You're not really thinking about getting the baby back?",
        "Gwen: I don't know what you're all bent about. It's none of your business anyway.",
        "Casey: If what you told me about the baby is true, it is my business.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I get it. It's not that it's a bad idea for me or the baby, you're just freaking because you're scared that your little secret is going to leak out.",
        "Casey: It was one night, Gwen. Why are you trying to ruin everyone's life over it?",
        "Gwen: Whose life is the only one that's even come remotely close to getting ruined? Mine. This is about a whole lot more than one night for me, Casey. I felt that baby growing inside me for all those months. So what's going on right now is between me and my baby. It has absolutely nothing to do with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What is she going to do, Jack? Strap the baby onto her back in history class? Have him nap during physical education?",
        "Jack: I know you don't want to hear this, but the fact is that if Gwen wants the baby back, there might not be anything we can do about it.",
        "Carly: What court would possibly decide that that child should raise a baby? She can't, Jack. She shouldn't be given that kind of responsibility. Because she can't.",
        "Jack: Listen to me! Listen. She's not a child, she may be young, but she's not a little girl. She's nearly an adult. She might not be as experienced as a mother as you are, but that doesn't mean the baby's in any real danger.",
        "Carly: Jack, the kid who walked into this house yesterday could not raise a goldfish. And she doesn't have two nickels to rub together either!",
        "Jack: Yes. I'm guessing you said that to her, too, right?",
        "Carly: Not in those exact words. What? You should have heard the things she was saying to me.",
        "Jack: So you lost your temper and things spun out of control.",
        "Carly: I couldn't help it.",
        "Jack: I bet. That's one of the things I love so much about you.",
        "Carly: Don't try to make me feel better.",
        "Jack: I'll go talk to Gwen.",
        "Carly: Oh, no! Don't do that. Let the lawyer handle it. You just got home, you haven't even slept.",
        "Jack: Like I can get any sleep now? No, no. Attorneys just complicate things more than they need to be. Listen, I'll talk to Gwen, I'll get her to see it would be better for the baby to stay here with us. And maybe with no yelling and screaming, we can come to a compromise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Those papers you just stashed -- they were hospital records, weren't they?",
        "Paul: How did you know that?",
        "Emily: You don't have to hide it from me. Okay? I think I understand what you're trying to do.",
        "Paul: You do?",
        "Emily: Yeah. You're looking for someone to blame. I'm just not sure suing memorial for negligence is going to get you what you want. I'm not trying to tell you how to run your life, but just think about it for a minute, okay? Jennifer's baby was born so early. Maybe he just wasn't strong enough to survive on his own.",
        "Paul: What if Jennifer's baby could have survived?",
        "Emily: Questions like that aren't going to bring him back. And dragging it through court -- it's just going to make Jennifer relive it. And she's in pain, Paul. She needs to heal.",
        "Paul: I promise you that I won't say a word to Jennifer until I have absolute proof of what happened.",
        "Emily: Good. That's good. The best thing you can do for your sister right now is stop obsessing over things you can't change. Focus on the future. Get her to do the same thing. Stay positive.",
        "Paul: How do you do that?",
        "Emily: Simple things. Like, today, I'm going to go buy a baby gift, and I'm going to stop and see Carly and the new baby. Want to come with me?",
        "Paul: No. I was actually there yesterday. I saw him then.",
        "Emily: Oh. Okay.",
        "Paul: You give them my love, though.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How could you think I don't trust you?",
        "Keith: Well, you basically said, \"how dare you take my kid flying?\"",
        "Lily: No, no, no. I had no idea where you were. You don't understand that?",
        "Keith: Once I explained it to you, you still jumped on us.",
        "Lily: All right, fine, I overreacted, and I appreciate what you did for Luke. If you hadn't stayed behind, he would've sneaked out and gotten into worse trouble. Thank you.",
        "Keith: So what's the problem?",
        "Lily: Me, him, everybody. This family is just going through so much transition right now.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? Maybe you shouldn't be such a scaredy cat. Change could be good.",
        "Lily: You have no idea how difficult this past year has been for Luke. He needs a little stability in his life, please.",
        "Keith: Same-old same-old, you know? But I'm telling you he changed up there. The day before yesterday he was stomping around, he was angry at the world, and especially me. Couple hours in the air, he's excited, he's asking a million questions about everything, you know? So, you see, that experience up there -- he brought that back down here with him.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. I felt the same way when you took me up there.",
        "Keith: Okay. So, I just thought I was getting through to him. Life for Luke was like one disaster after another, but now he's got some kind of hope, something to believe in, something new.",
        "Lily: Well, since when did you know so much about Luke?",
        "Keith: Because I was just like him when I was his age. I was as mad at everybody, I wouldn't listen to anything.",
        "Lily: What changed?",
        "Keith: Well, I found something I love. Flying changed my life, and I think it could change his life, too.",
        "Lily: I think you're a wonderful man, and you have so many qualities I would love Luke to emulate, but this is different.",
        "Keith: Why?",
        "Lily: Because flying -- I mean, flying, this is not a decision I can make alone. Alone, you know.",
        "Keith: I see. So you have to fly it past Holden?",
        "Lily: Yeah, Holden and I may not be together anymore, but as parents, we are. And I can tell you, Holden will not approve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Okay, so let me get this straight. After your mother grounded you, you decided to sneak out of the house anyway, and that's when Keith caught you.",
        "Luke: Yeah --",
        "Holden: But instead of bringing you back up to your room, and locking you in there until your mother got back, he took you up in an airplane?",
        "Luke: Yes. It was awesome, dad. We flew everywhere. I could even see the lights on this roof. It was crazy.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'll bet. Okay, Luke, I think you're right. I think it's time that I talked to your mother, and Keith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: She wants the baby back?",
        "Carly: Yeah, can you believe the nerve? Well, that little kid is not getting anywhere near Rosanna's baby again, not even if I have to park myself on that doorstep and beat her away with a stick.",
        "Emily: What does Jack say about all of this?",
        "Carly: He says that the law might be on her side.",
        "Emily: Seriously?",
        "Carly: Seriously. He just went to talk to her, to see if he could talk some sense into her.",
        "Emily: Well, what's he going to say to her, Carly?",
        "Carly: Hopefully, that if she values her life, she'll stay away because if his wife ever sees her again that little witch will wish she's never been born.",
        "Emily: What if he can't convince her to let it go, honey?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I just know that I can't give up that baby, Emily. When Rosanna first told me she was going to adopt him, I saw this hope in her that I hadn't seen in so long. Then when she asked me and Jack if we would take the baby and take care of it if anything ever happened to her, it just means the world to me that she trusts me like that.",
        "Emily: I know, I understand, but can we talk numbers for a second here? I mean, you've got your two and jj. And now Rosanna's? I know you're not working and I know what Jack makes as a cop, it's gonna take some creative budgeting.",
        "Carly: It's okay because Rosanna took care of all that. She set up a trust fund for the baby. It's like she knew. It's almost like she knew --",
        "Emily: No, no. What she knew was that you would take care of her child whether there was a trust fund or not because she knows what a big heart you got.",
        "Carly: You'd do the same thing for your sister, I know that. It's all I can do for Rosanna now, and I know she will never forgive me if I give her baby away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, Casey, if you think this is some pathetic attempt to hook up with you, you're wrong.",
        "Casey: Then why are you doing it?",
        "Gwen: Because I want my baby back. Didn't you hear me the first time?",
        "Casey: Yeah, what if you do get her back? You know what everybody's next question's gonna be.",
        "Gwen: I'm not gonna tell anybody who the father is. Nobody's gonna know.",
        "Casey: Celia and Will know.",
        "Gwen: You think they're gonna say anything? Don't you trust any -- never mind, I already know the answer to that question.",
        "Casey: Listen, as soon as people see you trying to take care of a baby by yourself, they're gonna want to know where the father is.",
        "Gwen: It's none of their business, so you can go back to pretending like nothing ever happened.",
        "Jack: Hey, Case.",
        "Casey: Hi, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I need to talk to your friend here.",
        "Casey: No problem. I've gotta check some messages anyway.",
        "Jack: Gwen Norbeck, right? I'm Detective Jack Snyder.",
        "Gwen: Carly's husband.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I understand you paid our house a little visit last night?",
        "Gwen: That's right. It's not against the law. You can't arrest me for that.",
        "Jack: I don't want to arrest you, Gwen. I want to talk to you. Can I buy you something to eat, a drink maybe?",
        "Gwen: Um, I'm kind of sick of the food here.",
        "Jack: We can go someplace else if you want.",
        "Gwen: Does this uniform look like I can come and go whenever I want? Just say what you have to say.",
        "Jack: My wife says that you and she got pretty upset last night.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she wouldn't let me see my kid.",
        "Jack: Well, you did show up out of the blue, Gwen, and she couldn't be sure who you were.",
        "Gwen: Oh, she knew who I was.",
        "Jack: And you already knew that her sister had a really bad accident that she's still pretty shaken up over.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, and I'm sorry about that.",
        "Jack: And when something happens like that to someone you love, you tend to hold the people around you a little tighter.",
        "Gwen: I get that. That's why I want my kid back.",
        "Jack: Gwen, if you're worried that we won't love him like one of our own, you shouldn't be. We already do.",
        "Gwen: Except that I didn't give him to you.",
        "Jack: No, you didn't, Gwen. You gave him to Carly's sister, who asked that we take care of him if anything should happen to her. She gave it a lot of thought, Gwen. She wanted to make sure that the baby's best interests were looked after. Isn't that why you chose Rosanna in the first place?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but things are different now. She's gone and I'm here. I'm the baby's mother, he ought to be with me.",
        "Jack: No, he ought to be with people who have a good chance at showing him a good life.",
        "Gwen: And you don't think I can? You don't know me.",
        "Jack: Raising a child isn't as easy as it sounds, especially when you haven't even graduated high school yet. How do you plan to cope?",
        "Gwen: Your wife asked me the same question, and I'll tell you exactly what I told her. Whatever it takes, I can handle it. Whenever I need to be at school or at work, I'll hire a babysitter.",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea how much that costs, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: I don't need to worry about money. My kid's rich.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So after my sister, Jennifer, brought her baby to the hospital, there was nothing out of the ordinary in terms of his treatment, was there?",
        "Nurse Bently: I don't know what you're expecting to hear, Mr. Ryan, but I can assure you that Memorial has one of the best neonatal units in the country. Your sister's baby got the best care available. Everything that could have been done for him --",
        "Paul: So, after he was born, you were with him the entire time?",
        "Nurse Bently: I was there until the end of my shift.",
        "Paul: Well, who took over then?",
        "Nurse Bently: Special duty nurse Kristen Thompson.",
        "Paul: I need a number for her. I should probably talk to her.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan, she's gone.",
        "Paul: What do you mean \"she's gone?\"",
        "Nurse Bently: She left town with no forwarding address the night your nephew was born, in fact.",
        "Paul: Why'd she leave town?",
        "Nurse Bently: Rumor has it she came into a large sum of money, the lottery or something. At first, I didn't know whether to believe it, but this is America.",
        "Paul: There's got to be another way to reach her. She's got family, she's got friends? Was she seeing anybody, do you know?",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan. Like I told Mrs. Montgomery, I don't know where she went.",
        "Paul: Rosanna asked you about this nurse?",
        "Nurse Bently: Yes sir, when I met with her about the donation she wanted to make to the hospital.",
        "Paul: Do you remember when that was?",
        "Nurse Bently: How could I ever forget? It was the same day as her accident. We met at the coffee shop, java. And to think, just a few hours later, she was gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up -- on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Jack: Come up to the house. Maybe we can work out some kind of compromise if we just talk all this out.",
        "Carly: Will you and Paul be the baby's godparents?",
        "Jennifer: Wait, I know you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna must have told you why she needed to find this nurse.",
        "Nurse Bently: She was making a donation to Memorial's nurses' organization. She said she wanted to thank us all individually and asked if I could make a list of everyone's names and addresses.",
        "Paul: So the only thing she wanted to know about this nurse was her address?",
        "Nurse Bently: Well, she asked a few other questions, but I don't think I could tell you what they were. Mainly, I remember not being able to give her Nurse Thompson's address.",
        "Paul: Do you think maybe this kind of a cover-up story?",
        "Nurse Bently: No, I don't think so. She handed me a very generous check.",
        "Paul: There's gotta be something Rosanna said to you.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan. I've told you everything I know.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm sorry, too, but this is very important to me.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm sure it is. But we gave Mrs. Montgomery's child the same care as every other baby. I'm not gonna help you make a case against our staff. I think I'd better go.",
        "Paul: No, please, don't go. Not yet. Please. Listen, Rosanna said something to me the night of the accident, but she lost consciousness before I could really understand what she was saying. So I'm trying to retrace her steps. And maybe I can figure out what happened to her before she got into the car that night. And if you and I keep talking, maybe you'll say something that could help.",
        "Nurse Bently: I'm not sure I can help --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Paul: I'm going to ignore that. All right, I'm going to get rid of whoever that is, and then you and I, maybe we can finish up.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I really need to talk to you. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know that you had a meeting. Wait. I know you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: The baby comes with money to make sure that he gets everything that he needs.",
        "Jack: Comes with?",
        "Gwen: Yep, Mrs. Montgomery set up some kind of account. Some trust fund thing.",
        "Jack: Rosanna told you that?",
        "Gwen: Nope, a lawyer did.",
        "Jack: Gwen, you contacted a lawyer?",
        "Gwen: I sure did. And I read the papers. Look, I know how difficult it is for somebody like me to deal with people I want my kid back. Your wife was really mean about it, so I called somebody who can help me get him back. He told me about the money.",
        "Jack: Okay. All right. Even with all the money in the world, raising a child without easy.",
        "Gwen: People do it all the time.",
        "Jack: Oh, have you talked to any of them? Because I guarantee you, all of them will say the same thing. That it's no picnic doing it alone. Gwen say you have to work here late or you've got a big final exam you gotta study for, and you can barely keep your eyes open. And the baby starts crying, you have no idea what the problem is. It helps having a partner there to help. And I'm sorry if I'm getting too personal, but have you thought about how this is going to change your life? Graduating high school is one thing, Gwen. Then you're supposed to go to college, date, manage a love life? All with a baby demanding your attention night after night. Do you have any close family you can rely on to help you out here?",
        "Gwen: Not really.",
        "Jack: Okay, what about the father? Is he in the picture, can he help?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Jack: Before you make up your mind, please, come out to the house again, spend some more time with the baby.",
        "Gwen: Your wife's not gonna let me do that.",
        "Jack: Okay, Carly can be really understanding once you get to know her. We all get tense when we feel like we're pressured, right? Come out to the house, maybe we can work some kind of compromise if we just talk all this out.",
        "Gwen: What you're saying about it being hard and everything may be so, but don't you think that a baby should know who his mom is?",
        "Jack: I think there's a way for you to stay in his life without having to shoulder all the responsibility day after day.",
        "Gwen: A compromise.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm sorry that you and Carly got off on the wrong foot, I really am. I'll talk to her. I'm sure we can work something out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: When Rosanna comes home, she's gonna find her little boy safe and sound and waiting for her. He needs to be here, Emily. With us. He's a part of this family. In the meantime, I'm going to tell him all about her. How much she loves him, how much she wants him. And I'll show him pictures every day. Oh, isn't she beautiful? Was taken on the day -- that's it, Emily. That's what we have to do.",
        "Emily: You lost me. What?",
        "Carly: No, we have to make it real. We have to stand up in front of God, in front of our friends and family and prove how much we love that little boy upstairs. We have to claim him as an official member of this family.",
        "Emily: Carly, I don't have to tell you that a christening doesn't make it official. You know, not in any legal sense.",
        "Carly: Well, I know. But think about it. If the worst happens and we have to go to court? Then it'll just prove to the judge that we've treated Rosanna's baby the same way we treat our own.",
        "Emily: I think it's a great idea. What can I do to help?",
        "Carly: I'm glad you asked. This might seem a little awkward, but please, promise me that you'll think about it before you say no.",
        "Emily: Okay. Shoot.",
        "Carly: Well, you know that Rosanna and Paul, they had a very deep connection. And I know things ended badly, but they were close, you know, and that --",
        "Emily: You don't need to tiptoe, okay? I understand that Rosanna meant a great deal to Paul. It's okay. Just because you're not with someone doesn't mean you still don't have feelings for them. I get that.",
        "Carly: Right, exactly.",
        "Emily: Okay, so --",
        "Carly: And I think that Rosanna would like it if Paul were a part of her baby's life. And you, you know, I love you, you're one of my very best friends in the entire world -- and I really think it's perfect. Would you and Paul be the baby's godparents?",
        "Emily: Wow. Oh, honey, that's huge.",
        "Carly: It is, I know. If you need time to think about it, I understand.",
        "Emily: No. No, of course not. Paul and I would be honored.",

        "Jennifer: You're the nurse from Memorial. The neonatal unit.",
        "Nurse Bently: Once again, I want to tell you how sorry I am about your loss.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. You know, you spent more time with him than I did. You knew what he was like, didn't you?",
        "Paul: Ms. Bently, thank you so much.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I have --",
        "Paul: I think I've taken up too much of your time already. If I have any other questions, I'll call you, okay?",
        "Nurse Bently: Goodbye.",
        "Paul: Bye.",
        "Jennifer: What was that all about?",
        "Paul: Nothing.",
        "Jennifer: You couldn't get her out of here quick enough. What are you so worried about, Paul?",
        "Paul: Nothing. I just don't want to see you get upset again.",
        "Jennifer: I am so sick of everyone protecting me. You have no idea what it feels like. It feels so awful to make everyone walk on eggshells around you.",
        "Paul: If you need to know, I was talking to her because I'm thinking of making a donation to the neonatal unit in memory of your son.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. That is such a wonderful, generous thing to do. I'm so sorry I snapped at you. I don't know what's wrong with me.",
        "Paul: There's nothing wrong with you.",
        "Jennifer: Then why am I jumping down everybody's throat today? I just did the same thing to mom.",
        "Paul: Well, Mom carries a needle for every occasion.",
        "Jennifer: It wasn't her fault this time. She was just taking care of something that needed to be taken care of, and I blew up at her. Oh, I hate this. I hate thinking that I'm all right, and then all of a sudden, one little thing happens and I just fall to pieces again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There's the number to the house, my cell, and Carly's cell. Any time you want to come see the kid, you just give us a shot first, okay?",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Jack: See you later, case.",
        "Casey: Tell me this isn't happening.",
        "Gwen: What are you whining about now?",
        "Casey: Tell me that Jack and Carly Snyder are not the people with the baby.",
        "Gwen: It wasn't supposed to be that way. He was supposed to go with Carly's sister, but she got in an accident.",
        "Casey: Rosanna? Like, Rosanna Cabot? She was the one who was supposed to adopt it?",
        "Gwen: Why are you freaking out?",
        "Casey: Because Craig Montgomery's my uncle. And when you said you wanted to send it away to be adopted, I thought it was gonna be to someone we don't know.",
        "Gwen: Look, I didn't know them. But none of that matters now anyways. Rosanna's in a coma. Your uncle, he's in the slammer. So that great, too-good- to-be-true home that my baby was supposed to have -- it fell apart. So maybe the universe is trying to tell me that I'm not supposed to give him away.",
        "Casey: Maybe the universe is trying to tell you that Jack and Carly should to have it.",
        "Gwen: Him.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Gwen: Him. We have a son. And I've seen him. I've held him in my arms. And maybe you can forget and go on like it never happened, but I can't.",
        "Casey: Don't do this. Leave the baby with Jack and Carly. I mean, they've got a ton of kids. They know how to do it. It would be better for everybody.",
        "Gwen: Everybody? Or just for you?",

        "Keith: You know, Lily, you keep telling me how bad you feel because Luke is always disappointed.",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no. You cannot guilt me into changing my mind. Luke is too young to fly a plane, period.",
        "Keith: I disagree. He's a natural. And I'm telling you, he's gonna be disappointed.",
        "Lily: He'll get used to it. He'll move on until he finds something else he's interested in.",
        "Keith: Well, what about me? What am I gonna do?",
        "Lily: What about you?",
        "Keith: What am I gonna do? What's gonna interest me?",
        "Lily: Oh, I think you've got a few ideas already, don't you?",
        "Keith: Yes, I do.",
        "Luke: Because she told me -- she said she'd be helping grandma.",
        "Lily: Hello. Hey.",
        "Holden: Luke said that you'd be here.",

        "Keith: You know what, why don't I give you --",
        "Holden: Actually, Keith, that's okay. You need to stay, because I'd like to speak to both of you. Luke and I, we had a nice, long conversation.",
        "Lily: Did he tell you about his drinking and had his run-in with the police?",
        "Holden: Oh, yeah. He's going to be mucking out stalls for the next four weekends.",
        "Lily: Oh, perfect. Mmm, good.",
        "Holden: He also told me about his impromptu airplane trip.",
        "Keith: Well, now, I take full responsibility for that, okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, he seems to be bitten by the bug, Keith. He says you offered to teach him to fly for real.",
        "Lily: Yeah, Keith offered, but I said absolutely not.",
        "Holden: I think it's a great idea.",
        "Luke: This is great. So, when are we gonna get to go up again?",
        "Keith: Anytime.",
        "Luke: Right now?",
        "Keith: Well, if you're really serious about being a pilot, there's some books that you need read and some software that you can practice with.",
        "Luke: This is too cool, man.",
        "Keith: Okay, well, whenever your parents say it's okay, we'll get the stuff.",
        "Holden: It's up to your mom.",
        "Luke: Please, mom. I really want to do this. Please.",
        "Lily: All right. As long as your father says it's okay, I'm not gonna be a scrooge about it.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Keith: Okay, so, are you ready?",
        "Luke: You know it.",
        "Keith: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Lily: Okay. Well, that was a shock.",
        "Holden: What? Luke getting enchanted with flying?",
        "Lily: No, no, no. That you said it was okay. I guess after all these years you still have a few surprises left in you.",
        "Holden: Is that the only reason you said no? Because you didn't think I'd approve?",
        "Lily: Well, I have to tell you, I was having these visions of my only son thousands of feet in the air with nothing but a piece of tin between him and the ground, I was feeling a bit queasy. But I really said no because I didn't think you would approve. And I would never want to do something that you wouldn't approve of.",
        "Holden: Well, thank you for thinking about my feelings in all this.",
        "Lily: We're the parents. We have to stick together because of the kids.",
        "Holden: That's right. That's right, we do. And I haven't seen him this lit up in over a year.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. It's great. But that's not the reason why you said yes? Just 'cause he's happy, is it?",
        "Holden: No, I did it for you.",
        "Lily: For me?",
        "Holden: Yeah, for you. Because if you're gonna have Keith in your life, then I guess I want Luke to get along with him.",

        "Casey: You're just being stubborn. You're not thinking about what's best for him, you're thinking about what's best for you.",
        "Gwen: No. Just shut up. I don't want to hear one more word out of your mouth. We are not talking about this baby again. Do you hear that? You have nothing more to say about it.",

        "Jack: Well, I don't think we should provoke Gwen.",

        "Jack: We had a pretty long chat, yeah.",
        "Carly: Oh, so you see how impossible she is, don't you? What did she say?",
        "Jack: Well, first she claimed that she could handle everything.",
        "Carly: Oh, lord, how? How is she gonna do that? She's still in school, Jack. She can't possibly raise the baby.",
        "Jack: She knows about the baby's trust fund.",
        "Carly: How? We've barely had time to go through Rosanna's papers ourselves.",
        "Jack: Well, apparently, she got a lawyer and he filled her in on everything that Rosanna had set up.",
        "Carly: That's it. Well, that's it, don't you see it? Gwen doesn't want the baby, Jack. She wants the money.",
        "Jack: No, honey, she didn't even know out about the money until she'd been here asking for the baby back.",
        "Carly: I don't believe that. She knows that Rosanna is rich. She probably figured that there was money in it, and her lawyer confirmed it.",
        "Jack: I really think that we should try and work with this girl. If she's already lawyered up, it's not gonna take any time at all for this thing to get ugly.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe it should get ugly, Jack. Maybe that's just what should happen.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Carly: Because that girl is out of her league. Maybe if we pummel her in the first round, she'll disappear and she won't come back.",
        "Jack: Listen to yourself.",
        "Carly: No. You listen to me. I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to keep my promise to my sister. Nobody is taking that baby away.",
