        "Damian: Hey, I couldn't sleep. The medications keep me awake. What about you? What are you doing up so late?",
        "Luke: I dozed off, but then I thought I heard my phone ring. Nobody called for me, did they? The hospital?",
        "Damian: No, I would have woken you if they had.",
        "Luke: Is Lucy around?",
        "Damian: No, she had to go into work.",
        "Luke: What's that?",
        "Damian: Our itinerary and our route to Malta. Surrounding, I'll show you on the plane. You all packed?",
        "Luke: Almost. Actually, I got -- I got to go back to the house. There's some stuff I forgot.",
        "Damian: No, Luke, we can send for it. Then again, it may not be an issue if my disease progresses -- you may be back sooner than you think. [Cell phone rings] It's my broker in Malta. I have to take this.",
        "Luke: I'll do some more packing.",
        "Damian: All right. Get some rest.",
        "Damian: Hello.",
        "Sergio: We've got to get the kid out.",
        "Damian: Not until he's ready.",
        "Sergio: If the girl digs any deeper, we're leaving. I don't care how he feels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I've read a lot of medical reports. Damian's is just too perfect. Anyway, it's easy enough to check. His original records should be here at the hospital. I just have to get the key.",
        "Holden: I don't know about that. That's kind of risky.",
        "Lucy: And if Damian takes Luke away before we're able to prove what he's up to?",
        "Holden: Okay, all right. Go ahead, check the records. I'm going to head over to Fairwinds, and try to talk some sense into Luke.",
        "Lucy: I'll give you a call as soon as I know anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, Babe it's me. Kim stopped by and needed me to cover for the station at an affiliates meeting in New York. So, I will call you as soon as I land. Love you.",
        "[Answer machine beep]",
        "Mike: This isn't right. This isn't right.",
        "Passenger: You're in my seat. Ma'am, are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie -- whoa! Will. You totally creeped me out.",
        "Will: Sorry. Sorry man.",
        "Casey: It's fine. I just thought I was alone.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's not such a great idea these days.",
        "Casey: Right? And all the cops can do is look at Maddie. The killer's getting a free ride.",
        "Will: Yeah, if you say so.",
        "Casey: What do you mean?",
        "Will: Look, Maddie's not as innocent as you think she is.",
        "Casey: I thought you were on our side.",
        "Will: I was, until she busted up my marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Casey?",
        "Jade: Hey. Casey just took off. Do you want me to call him? Oh, oh, what's going on?",
        "Gwen: Do you care?",
        "Jade: Yeah, of course I do.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Jade: What do you mean?",
        "Gwen: Why do you care about me?",
        "Jade: Because you're my friend. What's going on?",
        "Gwen: Why don't you tell me, Jade? Why don't you tell me what's been going on since the last couple of months you slept with my husband?",
        "Jade: You've been listening to Maddie?",
        "[Gwen slaps Jade hard]",
        "Gwen: You want to try again? I talked to Will and he told me the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike? Are you there? It's me. Pick up.",
        "Flight attendant: I'm sorry, Hon, you are going to have to turn that thing off. We're preparing for takeoff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What? That's it? You have nothing to say?",
        "Jade: I slept with him. So what?",
        "Gwen: Oh, so what?",
        "Jade: It was a long time ago, okay. It maybe it shouldn't have happened --",
        "Gwen: Maybe it shouldn't have happened?",
        "Jade: You were not there for him. You were graduating. Okay, and it was a one time thing. You know why? Because Will's married. And he loves you and we're just friends.",
        "Gwen: And your idea of friendship is sleeping with him? Never mind talking to him, or sending him home to take to his wife! His wife, not that that concept means anything to you --",
        "Jade: Of course it means something to me. Why do you think we didn't want you to find out?",
        "Gwen: Whoa, I'm game. Why?",
        "Jade: Because we knew you'd react this way.",
        "Gwen: Mad? Hurt? Furious? You sleep with my husband and then you lie about it. You get him to talk to Casey, so he gets you a job here. You move in with us. He gives you money.",
        "Jade: That had nothing to do with what happened.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no. Do you think Will did all that out of the goodness of his own heart!",
        "Jade: Yes. Yes, I do. We're friends.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah. That's right. And friends do anything for friends, including sleeping with them when they're upset.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Gwen: You're not even sorry.",
        "Jade: Of course I'm sorry. I'm sorry for Will. I'm sorry for you because you're going about this the wrong way, and I'm sorry for me --",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm sorry, what's the right way, Jade?",
        "Jade: Hating me and hating Will is not going to change what happened, or why it happened. Okay? You're just going to have to get over it. And move on. That's what I've had to do. You think I liked having this hanging over my head? You're my friend --",
        "Gwen: Don't use that word with me. It makes me sick.",
        "Jade: Oh, I'm sorry. I get it. So you're only friends with perfect people? No wonder why life was so hard for Will.",
        "Gwen: You're blaming this on me?",
        "Jade: I'm trying to stop you from wrecking something great!",
        "Gwen: You are a sociopath! Do you understand that? What you did is not friendly. It was manipulative. You slept with him and then you held it over his head so you get stuff. You basically blackmailed him!",
        "Jade: That's not true.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no?",
        "Jade: No. We were friends and he knew that I wasn't going to say anything to anybody. I promised him!",
        "Gwen: And please, you bought that?",
        "Jade: Yeah. Look, all I ever wanted was for you and Will to like me.",
        "Gwen: What you wanted was my husband! Well, you can have him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What do mean Maddie busted up your marriage? How could Maddie bust up your marriage?",
        "Will: She just kept going on and on about me and Jade. To get the attention off of her. Because the cops --",
        "Casey: Wait, whoa. You and Jade? You and Jade?",
        "Will: Yeah, it happened once. All right? Months ago. Don't look at me like that --",
        "Casey: Dude, I'm just -- I mean, you and Jade? You and Jade, why?",
        "Will: All right, give it a rest, Casey.",
        "Casey: She's just straight-up trouble.",
        "Will: Well, it's not really her fault.",
        "Casey: So, now, you're going to defend her?",
        "Will: No, I'm just saying.",
        "Casey: Does Gwen know?",
        "Will: Yeah, Maddie told her.",
        "Casey: Maddie knew about it?",
        "Will: Maddie overheard Jade and me talking and she went straight to Gwen.",
        "Casey: Oh, man.",
        "Will: Yeah, and now Gwen took off and I can't find her anywhere. That's why I came here. So, you haven't seen her?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Will: I got to find her.",
        "Casey: No wonder you wanted me to give Jade a job.",
        "Will: No, that had nothing to do with it.",
        "Casey: I'm sure that's how Gwen feels.",
        "Will: Look, Jade and I are friends. All right? And what happened between us, that whole thing, it was nothing.",
        "Casey: You cheated on your wife.",
        "Will: You know, I thought you'd understand.",
        "Casey: I do. You messed up.",
        "Will: It's not like I set out to sleep with Jade. I got drunk, you know, it happened one time --",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know. That's all it takes. Look what happened to me. With Gwen, one time, and she got pregnant. You should know, you lived through it. So, don't give me one time. You blew it, Will. And you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Holden, what are you doing here?",
        "Holden: I'm here to see Luke.",
        "Damian: He's asleep.",
        "Holden: Wake him up.",
        "Damian: It's the middle of the night. Did something happen to Lily --",
        "Holden: I need to see Luke.",
        "Damian: Look, I'll be happy to tell him you stopped by --",
        "Holden: Okay, here are your choices. You either go get him, or I'll go find him myself.",
        "Damian: Very well. Wait here please. I'll be right down.",
        "Luke: Is Mom okay?",
        "Holden: Your mom's condition hasn't changed.",
        "Luke: So, what's going on?",
        "Holden: What? I need an excuse to see you?",
        "Luke: Dad, it's the middle of the night.",
        "Holden: Yeah and tomorrow may be too late.",
        "Luke: Too late for what?",
        "Holden: To convince you to stay.",
        "Luke: Dad --our family needs you, especially your mother.",
        "Luke: I know, and if things were different \u0096",
        "Holden: You'd stay?",
        "Luke: You know I would. Look, the truth is Damian's dying and he doesn't have anyone. He's my father. I should be there.",
        "Holden: And what if Damian weren't dying? What if this is just a ploy?",
        "Luke: What are you saying?",
        "Holden: I'm saying that I don't think Damian is dying. I think its one big lie.",

        "Lucy: Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Oh, Dusty. Here you are. I have Johnny's meds.",
        "Dusty: Thank you, Bob. Thanks for seeing us so late.",
        "Bob: Any time. Just a couple of drops in each ear. The instructions are on the label. And the ear infection should clear up in a couple of days. Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Drops, twice a day?",
        "Bob: It's on the bottle.",
        "Dusty: Question. If I put drops in one ear, turn him over, put drops in the other. Won't the drops from the first ear fall out? Is that a dumb question? This is Jennifer's area. I don't know what I'm doing.",
        "Bob: You're doing fine. And you were right to bring him in.",
        "Dusty: Well he was running a fever.",
        "Bob: It's always best to bring him in. Come on, into my office, I'll show you how to use those drops --",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's okay. We'll figure it out.",
        "Bob: No, no, no. Come on, come on pal. Hang on, okay. Don't ever lose that bottle. Come on, we'll fix Johnny's ears and I'll show you how.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike! Mike? [Answering machine playing] Mike? Are you there? It's me. Pick up.",
        "Katie: Okay, so he got my first message, not that one. No note. Damn it! He must've followed me to the airport. Did you get my message?",
        "Mike: About going to New York? Yes, I did. I thought about chasing you, but I changed my mind.",
        "Katie: Me, too. I mean, Carly's been warned, right?",
        "Mike: I couldn't remember if we had any olives or not.",
        "Katie: We do. I mean, it's like you said. She's a big girl. She can take care of herself.",
        "Mike: Yes, she can. Black or green? Olives?",
        "Katie: Both. What are you doing? What is all this?",
        "Mike: Well, I thought you liked my spaghetti and meatballs.",
        "Katie: I do. It's my favorite.",
        "Mike: I figured you might be hungry, after running back and forth to the airport.",
        "Katie: You knew I'd come home?",
        "Mike: I had a feeling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Okay, I blew it. I know that, but I don't need a lecture from you.",
        "Casey: Hey, I'm not lecturing. I've just been there.",
        "Will: All right, so lay off.",
        "Casey: I'm just worried about you and Gwen.",
        "Will: You don't think I'm worried about her? She's my wife.",
        "Casey: Fine, so what you are going to do about it?",
        "Will: I don't know. I tried talking to her, she wouldn't listen to me.",
        "Casey: Well, she gets like that when she's mad.",
        "Will: So, what do you think I should do?",
        "Casey: Keep trying. I mean, that's the thing about Gwen, she's a forgiver.",
        "Will: No, not this time.",
        "Casey: You wait. She'll come around.",
        "Will: Can you talk to her for me?",
        "Casey: If she'll let me, but it's really up to you. You know, you got to find that one thing, you know? That'll show her what she means to you.",
        "Will: She knows how I feel.",
        "Casey: Its how she feels. You got to let her see that it's worth turning around. And I mean, I'm not saying you're worth it, but --",
        "Will: Hey, thanks.",
        "Casey: Whatever. The point is, she is. So fight for her. Or guaranteed, you're going to lose her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You're going to break up your marriage because Will and I had sex one time?",
        "Gwen: Why I'm breaking up my marriage is none of your business. Okay, why I'm breaking up my friendship, if that's what you want to call it, with you, is because you had sex with my husband and lied about it for months. And you used me and my sister. You took advantage of Will and me when you moved in and took our money. You're a liar and a cheat and I don't respect you and I don't want you in my life.",
        "Jade: Okay, fine. I get it. We're not friends anymore. But can I say one thing?",
        "Gwen: Can I stop you?",
        "Jade: Will loves you. And you love him. Don't break up with him because you'll regret it. And it'll ruin him. He needs you so much. The only reason why he didn't tell you what happened, was not because it meant anything to him, but because he was afraid of losing you. You're the only other person he's ever trusted other than his sister and now she's gone. So, please don't walk out on him, because of me. Because it's not worth it. Please just forgive him. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon.",
        "Casey: Jade, I need to talk to Gwen. Now.",
        "Gwen: You heard?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I just ran into Will. He's looking for you. He's a mess.",
        "Gwen: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen? Jade, I don't want to see you. Just go away!",
        "Jade: Not until I know you're okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, you think Damian is lying about his illness?",
        "Holden: Just look at the timing. Your brother's born and you and I start to get close again, you say you can't go to Malta, and all of a sudden, he's sick.",
        "Luke: But he was okay with me staying here, he understood. And Damian wasn't the one who told me that he was sick, I discovered that by accident.",
        "Holden: An easy accident for Damian to arrange.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on Dad. I think that's a little calculated even for him.",
        "Holden: This is the same guy that let your mom think that you and I were dead.",
        "Luke: That was years ago. He's changed.",
        "Holden: He's changed, huh? What if it's just another scheme?",
        "Luke: Dad, look, I understand that you're worried, you want me to stay, but accusing Damian? I mean, based on what? That you don't like him?",
        "Holden: Lucy looked at his records.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Holden: She was suspicious. So she looked at his medical records.",
        "Luke: So, that's why she's staying with us?",
        "Holden: She's concerned about you. She wanted to check it out. She thinks that Damian may have altered his records. That he faked his diagnosis.",
        "Luke: I can't believe you did this. I mean, Dad, I'm sorry. But you have really crossed the line here --",
        "Holden: What if I'm right?",
        "Luke: Well, then, he won't die. And I'll come home.",
        "Holden: What if he locks you up in a cellar again. Remember Malta, that whole ordeal --",
        "Luke: Dad, Dad, come on. I'm not a little kid anymore. I've spent time with Damian. I've seen him take his medications, he's sick, okay? So, I will go to Malta and I will stay with him until he dies. And then I'll arrange a funeral and I will bury him. Does that sound like something I want to do? No, but it's the right thing to do.",
        "Holden: And Damian is taking advantage of that.",
        "Luke: Look, Dad, you made your point. I've heard you out. I've got to go pack.",
        "Holden: Do you know where Lucy is?",
        "Luke: She's at work.",
        "Holden: No, she's at the hospital. She's looking at Damian's original medical records.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Holden: She wants to see if they match the ones she looked at. And if they don't, then he's a liar, and he's using you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: All right, Grimaldi. G-r-i-m-a-l-d-i. That's impossible. He was treated here. There has to be a record. Okay. Okay, let's check his name. G-r -- g-r-I -- so, where do they store dead files? Hello? Hello? Who's there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: I'm going to call the lawyer first thing tomorrow. Get it over with.",
        "Casey: Because you love him.",
        "Katie: Let's make a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Security? Yes, this is Dr. Montgomery. I'm in the -- no, I can't hold!",
        "Dusty: Hey, what are you doing? Put that down.",
        "Lucy: What you -- what the hell are you doing here? You almost scared me to death!",
        "Dusty: You should be scared. What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: I work here.",
        "Dusty: You're an intern. You don't have rights to private records.",
        "Lucy: I don't have rights? You're a civilian!",
        "Dusty: Yes, let's start over. What are you doing here? Checking on Damian Grimaldi?",
        "Lucy: Fine, yes, I was looking for his medical records, but they have seemed to have disappeared.",
        "Dusty: What does that tell you?",
        "Lucy: That he took them, somebody took them --",
        "Dusty: That should tell you, you got no business here.",
        "Lucy: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: If you keep it up, you might get yourself killed.",
        "Lucy: Oh, please.",
        "Dusty: Oh, please. I guess that means you missed the guy outside the door who is following you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You can't just look at his medical records without his permission --",
        "Holden: If she's wrong, there is no harm done. After all, he wanted her to look at the records.",
        "Luke: And what does that tell you?",
        "Holden: That he didn't realize how smart she was. After being raised by her father, she can spot a phony a mile away.",
        "Luke: And what, like I'm so stupid that I can't tell when people are lying to me?",
        "Holden: You trust him, and that's a mistake.",
        "Luke: Look, dad, I know what Damian's done to this family. I understand what he's capable of, but this is different. He cares about mom. And he sees how worried I am about her. And he would not ask me to leave Oakdale if it weren't absolutely necessary.",
        "Holden: If he were dying, I'd say fine, go. But my gut instinct tells me that he's lying. And I'm not going to let you without a fight.",
        "Luke: Well, then you are going to be fighting me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: How many times have I cried on your shoulder in the last year?",
        "Casey: This is a first.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Casey: Yeah, all those other times? It was my shoulder. But I was just standing in for Will. You know, I told him that he messed up and that you were something special and if he was smart, he'd crawl through fire to get you back.",
        "Gwen: It wouldn't matter. You can't -- you can't come back after something like this.",
        "Casey: Yeah you can.",
        "Gwen: If he'd just would've told me when it happened. You know, I'm not saying I would've liked it. I would've yelled and screamed and kicked him out for a day or two. But I would've gotten over it. But this, like, lying to me. For months? And the two of them talking about me behind my back? The thought of it makes me really sick.",
        "Casey: So don't think about it.",
        "Gwen: How can I stay with him? I don't trust him. I don't trust anything he's said or anything we've done. It just all feels like -- like a bunch of lies.",
        "Casey: Just don't make any decisions tonight. Just take care of yourself. And then you'll figure it out. Just give it some time.",
        "Gwen: Why wait? Why not call the lawyer first thing tomorrow and get it over with.",
        "Casey: Because you love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: My marriage is over.",
        "Jade: I know. I saw Gwen at Crash. She was looking for Casey.",
        "Will: Why'd she run to him?",
        "Jade: To talk? They're friends. Anyway I told her she was overreacting.",
        "Will: Well, I bet that went over real big.",
        "Jade: She needed to hear it.",
        "Will: She needed to hear it?",
        "Jade: Okay, I get it. It's not a nice thing to find out that your husband had sex with somebody else. But it's not like we're together. We're not having an affair. And I told her that, and that it wasn't a good enough reason for her to break up the marriage.",
        "Will: Do you know how you sound? Like you know me better than she does.",
        "Jade: Maybe I do.",
        "Will: No, you don't. So from now on, keep your mouth shut.",
        "Jade: Don't talk to me like that. There were two of us on that bridge. And I don't care how much you regret it, you were into it just as much as I was. So don't put this all on me. Okay, I never wanted Gwen to find out and all I've ever tried to do is be a friend to you.",
        "Will: Well, you're not my friend and you never will be.",

        "Katie: You realize what happened. We've grown up.",
        "Mike: All right if you say so.",
        "Katie: Seriously, think about it. A year ago? I would've flown off to New York, raced over to Simon's hotel, probably made a huge scene. You would've followed me and punched him in the face.",
        "Mike: Didn't I just do that?",
        "Katie: Yeah, but that was different. He was here, on our deck --",
        "Mike: Our deck. That's what's different.",
        "Katie: No, we're married and that's what's different. And we love each other. We don't need all this craziness.",
        "Mike: So that's why you came back?",
        "Katie: No, because I missed you. I was sitting on a plane and suddenly there you were -- only you weren't. So I came home. Let's make a baby!",
        "Mike: Okay, you want to -- what did you just say?",
        "Katie: Let's make a baby. What? It's not like we haven't talked about it before. We both want a family. And now we're finally married --",
        "Mike: Okay, slow down.",
        "Katie: No, I don't want to slow down. Time is wasting away. Let's seize the day! And tonight would be the perfect time for us to do this --",
        "Mike: All right it's not that I don't want a family -- you know that I do. But you just don't jump into a decision like this.",
        "Katie: That's why it takes nine months!",
        "Mike: No, no there's just stuff you gotta do. We got to get a safer car. Design and build a nursery --",
        "Katie: Honey, listen to me, this is not a construction project, okay? It's a baby. And we only have to do one thing to make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: That is not fair. We've been friends for months. Ever since I helped you buy that paper.",
        "Will: Right, and look how great that worked out.",
        "Jade: All I did was help you find a site. It was your choice to buy it and submit it. What happened next was not my fault.",
        "Will: And nothing is ever your fault, is it?",
        "Jade: I didn't say that! But there were two of us that night on that bridge. It is just as much your fault as it is mine!",
        "Will: I know that. I'm talking about what happened after.",
        "Jade: What are you talking about?",
        "Will: You holding me up for a job at Crash? You needing a place to stay? You needing money for an apartment?",
        "Jade: I never asked you for any of that.",
        "Will: Oh, please. If I hadn't gone to Casey, you would've went straight to Gwen.",
        "Jade: That's not true.",
        "Will: Stop lying!",
        "Jade: Okay. So I was desperate. And you were the only person that I could trust. But I was never going to tell Gwen.",
        "Will: I don't believe you.",
        "Jade: Will, I like you. Don't you get that? You're the only guy -- well, the only straight guy -- that I've ever spent time with that actually didn't want something from me. And yes, we slept together that one time. But there've been so many other times since then that we've just spent time together and talked. And comforted each other. And shared stuff. You're my friend. I mean, I guess, I hope you are. Because now that the word's out, I hope that we can start over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Love? Well, according to Will, the night that he had sex with Jade, he still loved me. So, I mean, I guess love isn't the answer.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but it's all we've got.",
        "Gwen: It's not enough. I spent most of my life loving my mom -- who claims she still loves me. And she sold me out every chance she got. I can't -- I can't do that anymore. I deserve better.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you do. But, who taught you that. Will.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, then how could he do this to me?",
        "Casey: He didn't do it to you, Gwen, all right? He was just using Jade for a little oblivion. You know? Let's not forget when this happened. Graduation -- and he didn't graduate. And you guys were fighting, and he was wasted --",
        "Gwen: No, don't make excuses for him.",
        "Casey: I'm not. You just asked me how this could happen and I'm telling you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, then to lie about it?",
        "Casey: He didn't want to hurt you.",
        "Gwen: That is weak and you know it.",
        "Casey: Come on, you've never been weak? Or made any mistakes? Cause I know I have. More than twice.",
        "Gwen: I'm just tired of people letting me down. I mean, can you understand that?",
        "Casey: People? We're all just mistakes waiting to happen. The surprise is when it works. And 90% of the time, you and Will worked.",
        "Gwen: You're not going to able to convince me of that tonight.",
        "Casey: You're right. So, let's just go home.",
        "Gwen: I'm not going home. I don't have a home. Nope. No home, no marriage.",
        "Casey: Look, I know that's how it feels right now.",
        "Gwen: You just won't budge, will you?",
        "Casey: Nope. Come on, I'll drive you home.",
        "Gwen: I'm going to stay here tonight. But you go. Okay? I'll be okay.",

        "Holden: Luke, I'm just asking for a little time. Just enough time to prove that Damian is lying.",
        "Luke: Look, the guy has to go. His doctor just called.",
        "Holden: You spoke to him?",
        "Luke: The doctor? No.",
        "Holden: Then how do you know he called?",

        "Luke: I suggested that.",

        "Holden: He looks pretty strong to me.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well he's not. He's up half the night, he can barely eat. He's a mess.",

        "Luke: Soon.",
        "Holden: Luke, do you realize that if something happens to your mother --",
        "Luke: Dad! You think that I don't know that?",
        "Holden: Well, then for your mom's sake just wait. Wait another week or so. Let's see if Damian's story pans out. And if it does, then fine, go. But let's wait until we find out the truth.",
        "Luke: No, Dad, I'm sorry. I can't do this to him. I'm going to Malta. That's my decision.",

        "Lucy: That doesn't prove anyone else was following me --",
        "Dusty: 5'10\", 175, dark hair, dark disposition and willingness to hurt people.",
        "Lucy: And you know this because.",
        "Dusty: Because I know the type.",
        "Lucy: So how do you know he wasn't a patient? Even thugs get sick.",
        "Dusty: He followed you.",
        "Lucy: Well then he's not very smart because Damian's records aren't here. I looked.",
        "Dusty: You got to back off. So you don't get yourself in trouble.",
        "Lucy: I can't do that. Holden's counting on me. And okay, I admit it. After what happened with your wife -- it feels good to be able to help someone I care about.",
        "Dusty: Holden would never agree to a dumb plan like this. Especially if he knew you were in danger.",
