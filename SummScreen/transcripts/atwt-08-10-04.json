        "Tom: What's going on?",
        "Margo: I called everywhere. I called all his friends, I called your folks --",
        "Tom: Okay, okay. Just calm down and tell me what happened.",
        "Margo: He found about Doc and me.",

        "Ben: I understand this was a very good year for ginger ale.",
        "Jessica: So, what are we toasting?",
        "Ben: To you. My beautiful, pregnant wife. The woman you are and the incredible mother that you are going to be.",
        "Jessica: Well, don't let the smile fool you. Bonnie could tell you some horror stories.",
        "Ben: Are you kidding? Bonnie adores you. Everybody adores you. Did I mention that I adore you? You okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, just a little tired.",
        "Ben: That comes with the territory.",
        "Jessica: Is it okay if we go home?",
        "Ben: As long as I get to spend the night with you in my arms.",
        "Jessica: I wouldn't have it any other way.",

        "Casey: Hey, Doc.",
        "Doc: Hey, Casey. Sorry about the busted golf lesson.",
        "Casey: I don't give a damn about the golf lesson.",
        "Doc: Hey, Casey, what's up?",
        "Casey: You tell me \"what's up\" -- Doctor Death. What's up with you and my Mom?",
        "Doc: Hey, you want to talk to me man-to-man, we'll talk. But don't disrespect me and don't disrespect your mother.",

        "Jennifer: Jordan? The office told me you were here.",
        "Jordan: When did you get back?",
        "Jennifer: I just came from the airport. You're not going to believe what my mother did. It was a lie. All of it. The symptoms, the New York specialist -- it was all a trick to get me and Paul out of town. And she even tried to blame it on Rosanna.",
        "Jordan: I know.",
        "Jennifer: You know what?",
        "Jordan: I know everything, Jen. I wish that we had time to talk. There's so much I need you to understand.",
        "Jennifer: What is going on?",
        "Jordan: I'm sorry, Jen. I'm more sorry than you'll ever know. But you and I -- we can't be together anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Am I dreaming?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Does it feel like a dream?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, don't wake me up.",
        "Paul: You know, for a while there, I thought I was going to turn into \"that guy.\" You know? Old reliable Uncle Paul. Doomed to be the guy you could call on a Saturday night, because you knew I didn't have any plans. In case you had a babysitting emergency.",
        "Rosanna: You're too handsome. You're too sexy to end up alone.",
        "Paul: What's wrong?",
        "Rosanna: This. This shouldn't have happened.",
        "Paul: How can you say that?",
        "Rosanna: No, it was selfish. I was just thinking of how much I wanted you, and I didn't think about anything else.",
        "Paul: In case you didn't notice, the feeling was very mutual.",
        "Rosanna: It was wrong. It could cost me my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Alan, I'm right here. Everything's going to be all right now. Can you hear me? Please let me know you can hear me.",
        "Alan: Oh, my God, Montgomery. So you had Lucy kidnapped?",
        "Sierra: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Craig: Sierra, let's leave him alone. He's been through hell --",
        "Sierra: No, he's trying to tell me something. What? What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: As ordered -- rack of lamb, medium rare. And a '97 cabernet.",
        "James: Frank, you're an inspiration. I don't know how you make your magic. But listen, I'm not a child. You've got to stop cutting up my food.",
        "Frank: Some rules you can't get around.",
        "James: I thought I taught you better than that, Frank. In the world, even in this world, every rule can be worked around.",
        "Frank: You seem pretty chipper tonight.",
        "James: Yes, indeed. Even as we speak, the fruits of my labors are being harvested in abundance. Probably the most illustrious achievement of my career.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I don't understand --",
        "Jordan: I don't expect you to.",
        "Jennifer: How can you decide that it's over, just like that -- out of nowhere?",
        "Jordan: Jen, I love you, okay --",
        "Jennifer: So let's break up?",
        "Jordan: I don't want this. I don't have any choice.",
        "Jennifer: Is that supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Jordan: Please. Please don't --",
        "Jennifer: Please what? Don't -- don't be angry? Don't be hurt? How am I supposed to feel?",
        "Jordan: Wait a second, Jen. Do you remember that day at Java when Cabot was switched with another baby?",
        "Jennifer: Of course.",
        "Jordan: James was behind it. And that was only one of the times he's proven to us that he can just take my child whenever he wants --",
        "Jennifer: Which is why we agreed that Cabot -- we have to work overtime to make sure he is protected.",
        "Jordan: No, no. There's only one way to make sure of that. Rosanna and I were given an ultimatum.",
        "Jennifer: By James? What kind of ultimatum?",
        "Jordan: He wants us to be husband and wife in more than just name. He wants us to be married -- in every sense of the word.",
        "Jennifer: Sex? We're talking about sex here?",
        "Jordan: Whatever it takes to make it a real marriage, yes.",
        "Jennifer: And how did this message come, by carrier pigeon?",
        "Jordan: When I took Cabot to see James in prison, he slipped a note inside of his clothing. The note asked Rosanna to come visit him.",
        "Jennifer: So this message was sent though Rosanna. And you believe her?",
        "Jordan: Jen, it's exactly the kind of thing that James would demand.",
        "Jennifer: But why? Come on, Jordan, she is making this up!",
        "Jordan: No, no she isn't, Jen. This threat is real. He will take Cabot. It's the truth!",
        "Jennifer: You know what I found out in New York? Nobody ever tells the truth. People lie. They lie, they manipulate. And when you ask why, they always say it's for your own good!",
        "Jordan: Jen, if there were any other way around this, I would never let you walk out that door.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that sounds like my cue to leave if I've ever heard one.",
        "Jordan: Jen. Jennifer! This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my whole life.",
        "Jennifer: If you're looking for sympathy, don't hold your breath. Goodbye, Jordan, I hope that you and Rosanna will be very happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hold on, hold on. Don't go, please.",
        "Rosanna: What if James knows?",
        "Paul: How could he possibly know?",
        "Rosanna: How does he find out anything?",
        "Paul: You're safe here, I promise you.",
        "Rosanna: I wish that was true. But James wanted me with Jordan, you know that.",
        "Paul: My dad doesn't always get what he wants.",
        "Rosanna: But we've tried to defy him, it doesn't work.",
        "Paul: We're not gonna defy him. I'm gonna beat him at his own game. You have to trust me. You trust me?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Paul: Good. Then believe me when I tell you that I've finally figured out a way to get James out of our lives forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Take your time, sweetheart. I'm right here. What is it? What's wrong? [Flat line] Oh, my God, Alan!",
        "Lily: I'll get a doctor.",
        "Sierra: Alan! Alan!",
        "Craig: Sierra, come on. They'll need room to work on him.",
        "Sierra: What is it? Alan! Don't let him die, John. John!",
        "John: Wait outside. Will you page Dr. Cameron. Stat. Let's go, everybody. Out, please, out, out, out.",
        "Sierra: I can't understand this. His eyes were clear. It's like he knew me, he knew where he was. He was even trying to tell me something.",
        "Lily: Well, whatever it was he wanted to say, it upset him quite a bit.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I wonder why.",
        "Craig: Well, it was right after you came in.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's funny, 'cause he was looking straight at you.",
        "Sierra: I need to go back in --",
        "Lily: No, you stay here until John --",
        "Craig: Sierra, come on, come on. Let's take a walk. There's nothing you can do out here.",
        "Sierra: I don't want to be too far away in case he needs me.",
        "Lily: Excuse me, come over here. I think you should go.",
        "Dusty: I think I'm good.",
        "Lily: No, no more comments about Craig. Got it?",
        "Dusty: What are you, his protector now?",
        "Lily: He saved my life.",
        "Dusty: Did you ask what's in it for him?",
        "Lily: I don't want you to make things worse for my sister.",
        "Dusty: The only thing worse is her moron ex husband.",
        "Sierra: John, John, how is he?",
        "John: He's stabilized.",
        "Sierra: Thank God.",
        "John: But his blood pressure has dropped. He's experienced what we call a vasovagal event.",
        "Sierra: But he's gonna be all right, isn't he?",
        "John: He's critical. And he's very agitated. Did something happen in there to bring this on?",
        "Sierra: I don't think so.",
        "John: Did somebody do something or say something? All right, look. I'm restricting visitation. From now on, Sierra's the only person who goes in there. I can't afford to have him upset like this again. In his condition, he might not survive it.",
        "Sierra: Can I go back in?",
        "John: Of course.",
        "Dusty: I guess there's no point hanging around. What do you say, Craig?",
        "Craig: We'll try not to miss you.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, I need to talk to you. It's important.",
        "Craig: I'm sure Dusty's needed back at Metro.",
        "Dusty: Metro's great. Thanks for the hard work.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, please?",
        "Dusty: Sure.",
        "Lucinda: Why are you allowing him to have so much influence on your daughter?",
        "Craig: Well, I obviously have no say in the matter.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you got plenty to say when it suits your purposes.",
        "Lily: Look, enough, stop it.",
        "Lucinda: If he hadn't been such a lousy parent, none of this would have happened.",
        "Lily: Does it really help anybody with you fighting? If we cannot get along --",
        "Lucinda: I have kept my mouth shut because Dusty did save Lucy's life. But my heavens, he cannot be trusted.",
        "Lily: I don't want Dusty here. We cannot force him to leave. Sierra needs us, we are her family. We have to start acting like a family. If Alan dies, she's going to need us.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, if Alan dies, we got real trouble baby, real trouble. Sierra hasn't been this happy in years, and to have this whole thing blow up with this cloud of suspicion and doubt --",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sure it's tough, but look at him. He sure looks guilty.",
        "Lucinda: When he was staring at you!",
        "Lily: Because he's afraid of Craig. Because Craig knows what he did.",
        "Craig: He's facing prison. Or even death. Who wouldn't be terrified under those circumstances?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: What are his chances?",
        "John: He's critical. The life support drips are failing to maintain his blood pressure and his heart is weak. I think the best we can do is keep him calm.",
        "Sierra: Thank you.",
        "John: Why don't you try to get some rest? This could be a long night.",
        "Sierra: Alan, please keep fighting. You promised me a lifetime together, and I am not gonna let you break that promise. I won't lose you. I can't. Oh, hey, there you are. The doctor wants you to rest. Everything's gonna be all right. Shh, shh, shh. What are you trying to say?",
        "Alan: Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Okay, thanks, Margaret. I'm sure he just stopped over Al's or something. I'll be in touch. Well, he's not over at Phil's or Ryan's.",
        "Margo: Okay, I'm gonna call the station.",
        "Tom: No, no. Just call his cell phone.",
        "Margo: I've called about 100 times.",
        "Tom: What made you think he was here?",
        "Margo: He stormed out and he said that he was gonna come and live with you.",
        "Tom: Okay, did he pack?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Tom: Then go back home and check his closet. Check his room.",
        "Margo: I'm scared, Tom.",
        "Tom: Hey, he's a smart kid.",
        "Margo: I know, but he was so angry with me.",
        "Tom: So how did he find out about Doc?",
        "Margo: It was at the club. He had a golf lesson.",
        "Tom: So people were gossiping?",
        "Margo: No, it was worse than that. It turns out that Doc Reese is the new golf pro. [Tom scoffs] I know. And when I saw him talking to Casey -- it was me, I went over the top, and I insisted that he cancel his golf lesson.",
        "Tom: So Casey put it together himself.",
        "Margo: But he doesn't deserve to find out like that. He was so angry and so hurt. And I just feel -- what kind of mother am I? What kind of mother breaks their kid's heart like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: You are way off on this one, Casey.",
        "Casey: Look, I was there! I saw her go nuts at the club. And, why did my grandmother fire you?",
        "Doc: Oh, come on, that happens all the time in television.",
        "Casey: She fired you 'cause of my folks! You and my mom have been fooling around.",
        "Doc: Casey, I never had an affair with your mother. That's the truth and I swear it is.",
        "Casey: I thought I was so cool. Doctor Death was my pal. Dropping over for autographs, for dinner. You used me, man. You used me to get to my mom.",
        "Doc: Casey, I never used you. Listen, I'm sorry about your parents --",
        "Casey: No, no, you're not! You don't care about me or my dad. I mean, you probably don't even care about my mom. And we were happy. We had a family. Did you think about that? Did you?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: Are you still mad?",
        "Lucy: You just don't know my father like I do.",
        "Dusty: You got that right.",
        "Lucy: I don't want to fight.",
        "Dusty: Who's fighting? You said you wanted to talk, so let's talk.",
        "Lucy: What I really wanted, was to do this. That was for saving my life.",
        "Dusty: I guess I got lucky.",
        "Lucy: Thanks for not giving up.",
        "Dusty: I was scared.",
        "Lucy: You, scared?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. When I saw that tape, I thought maybe I wouldn't get to you in time.",
        "Lucy: It was weird. When I was locked in that box, I kept thinking of you and my family. All the things I'd miss.",
        "Dusty: Things like what?",
        "Lucy: Little things. Coffee at Java, school. Falling in love. You gave all that back to me. I just don't know how I'm going to thank you.",
        "Dusty: You being here, that's plenty.",
        "Lucy: Even if Alan makes it, I don't know what that would do to my mom. You know, if my father's right and Alan's behind the kidnapping -- I know you don't believe that.",
        "Dusty: We'll figure it later, don't worry.",
        "Lucy: You mean, when you can start building a case against my father?",
        "Dusty: Cops and lawyers build cases. I'm not building anything.",
        "Lucy: Then let it go.",
        "Dusty: Letting it go is kinda like asking me to say its okay. And it's not okay, not with me. It's not.",
        "Lucy: I know my father has done a lot of hurtful things, but he would never --",
        "Dusty: Lucy, your father's hoping right now that Alan dies.",
        "Lucy: He's angry at Alan.",
        "Dusty: No, he's afraid of Alan.",
        "Lucy: Stop saying that! That's not true!",
        "Dusty: It is true. And I didn't save your life to sit back and watch your father get away with murder.",
        "Lucinda: Can we all agree not to talk about the kidnapping anymore until Alan's condition stabilizes and we can hear from him? Because so much of this has just been pure speculation.",
        "Lily: We know enough.",
        "Lucinda: Because of Craig's theories?",
        "Lily: No, because of what I know and what I saw in Alan's luggage.",
        "Craig: Oh, Lily's its all right. The sun couldn't come up if Lucinda didn't suspect me of something.",
        "Lucinda: And you usually deliver.",
        "Craig: You know, it could be hours before we know anything about Alan's condition. Why don't you and Lily get Sierra some of that tea she likes?",
        "Lily: That's a wonderful idea. Come on, Mother, let's go.",
        "Lucinda: I want to stick around, just in case.",
        "Lily: No, everything's fine. Craig is here, it'll be fine.",
        "Craig: Oh, and Lucinda -- two sugars and a lemon.",
        "Lucinda: Please, please don't tell Sierra about the kidnapping. Please. She's got so much on her plate.",
        "Craig: I won't say anything to anybody until ol' Alan's back in calm waters.",
        "Sierra: I don't understand. What about Craig? It's all right. We have time. Shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna be here all night. I'm not leaving you. Alan, I have been happier these past few months with you than I have -- I really thought I wasn't gonna fall in love again. But what we have. The bond that we have. The bond that we have goes beyond anything I've ever known. I can't lose you. I won't lose you. Alan? Alan, what is it? Oh, my God, Alan what is it? Alan! [Machines beeping] Help! Help! Alan! Help! Somebody help! Alan! Oh, no, please! Please.",

        "Casey: It's not cool, okay? You're not cool! All that hype when you first got here. Football hero. You are nobody's hero, man. You are nothing!",
        "Ben: All right. It's all right, Casey. Let's go find your dad, okay? I won't be long.",
        "Jessica: I'll be here.",

        "Tom: Maybe he's just choosing to blow off a little steam. Figures he can throw a scare into you, you know. Maybe I get it.",
        "Margo: Okay, so he's just trying get back at me?",
        "Tom: Hey, he's just a kid. Sometimes we forget that. But the fact is, he aces school, he doesn't miss his curfew. He's more mature than most adults.",
        "Margo: There's one person we haven't called.",
        "Tom: Doc? Well, my first impulse was to beat Doc Reese senseless, maybe it was Casey's, too.",

        "Tom: You don't need my permission.",

        "Margo: How many times do I have to tell you? We did not have an affair.",
        "Tom: You chose another man. So even if you stopped short of consummating it, you thought about it. You wanted it. Enough to lie to the people that love you.",
        "Margo: Do you still love me?",
        "Tom: This is about Casey.",
        "Margo: Come on baby, it's an easy enough question.",
        "Tom: Is it? Then I guess you know the answer. [Knock on door] Maybe that's him. Hey, I am glad to see you.",

        "Rosanna: Oh, Governor. Thank you so much for coming. It's a pleasure to meet you.",
        "Governor: The pleasure is all mine, ms. Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Let me introduce you, please, to Paul Ryan and Jordan Sinclair.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Governor: Gentlemen.",
        "Jordan: Hi.",
        "Governor: From your message, I understand you're interested in making a contribution to my re-election bid.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Rosanna's ready to write a sizeable check, provided that you can help us with a rather delicate issue.",
        "Governor: I'd be glad to be of any assistance I can.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, wonderful. That's wonderful to hear. Why don't you please sit down? Right over here.",
        "Paul: I'm guessing you've heard of my father, James Stenbeck.",
        "Governor: I believe I have. He's in custody in a federal penitentiary, if I remember correctly?",
        "Paul: Right. Which happens to be in this state.",
        "Governor: I'm not sure I'm following you, Mr. Ryan.",
        "Paul: Well, Rosanna and I, and our respective businesses, are willing to put all of our resources behind your reelection campaign, if you could just get my father moved to another prison facility. As far from Illinois as possible.",
        "Governor: I'm afraid that decision is completely out of my hands.",
        "Paul: So put it in your hands. Pick up the phone, make some calls, work the system.",
        "Governor: Is there some problem with his confinement?",
        "Jordan: James Stenbeck has been threatening our son.",
        "Paul: And trying to get Rosanna and Jordan to bend to his will.",
        "Governor: Do you have proof of this?",
        "Paul: My father never leaves a trail.",
        "Jordan: But he has contacts, even from the inside. He's already had people take our son.",
        "Governor: The boy's been kidnapped?",
        "Paul: Temporarily misplaced. But the important thing is that my father belongs in solitary confinement. With no contact with the other prisoners. No visitors, no interaction with any of the guards.",
        "Governor: I'm afraid, without any formal legal charge, there's very little I can do. Even prisoners have rights.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what about my rights? What about the rights of my son to live without fear?",
        "Paul: My father's amassed quite a power base, even from inside prison.",
        "Governor: I can open an investigation.",
        "Jordan: No, that will take months.",
        "Rosanna: We don't have that kind of time.",
        "Paul: And neither, I'm guessing, do you. I mean, I read the papers. It's a very tight race. What? What's the latest polls? The margin's, what, two and a half, three percent?",
        "Jordan: Yes. A statistical dead heat.",
        "Paul: And Rosanna and I, we think of ourselves as political independents. Not beholden to one particular political party or the other. What drives us, Governor Barnes, primarily is business.",
        "Rosanna: And we like doing business here. As a matter of fact, we're thinking about building a state of the art facility right here in Illinois.",
        "Paul: Which would be quite an accomplishment for a sitting governor.",
        "Governor: I'd love to help you, Mr. Ryan --",
        "Paul: Paul.",
        "Governor: Paul. But your request is unorthodox at best.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You don't have a prayer with my father if you stay orthodox. He's a slash and burn kind of guy. He trades in innocent lives. You have to do the right thing here. Even if it's not pretty.",
        "Rosanna: Because if you don't, the next check I write will be to your opponent.",
        "[The governor laughs]",
        "Governor: That's extortion.",
        "Paul: Nah. That's just politics. Now are you with us or against us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: John, no.",
        "John: I'm sorry, Sierra. He'd lost too much blood. The heart was compromised.",
        "Craig: I saw John rush in --",
        "Sierra: He's gone. He's gone.",
        "Craig: Oh, Sierra, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could have done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I never meant to hurt that boy.",
        "Jessica: I guess not too many people have held you accountable the way Casey just did.",
        "Doc: Yeah. You know, I grew up with these things I could do. Run faster, jump higher, win that big game and before I knew it, people made me out to be someone important, somebody special. They wanted to buy me drinks, they cheered me. You know, they even went to introduce me to their wives. Sometimes it happens so fast and it's so easy, you never even see it happening. And then when they start making excuses for your behavior, that's when you start feeling above it all.",
        "Jessica: Well, no matter who you are, Doc, I guess life catches up with you at some point.",
        "Doc: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Uh-hmm.",
        "Doc: You got that right. Well, at least some good did come out of this. I mean, a baby's always good, isn't it? Especially when it's wanted as much as you wanted yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey, honey, you said that you were going to go to your Dad's.",
        "Tom: Hey, Casey, your mom's talking to you.",
        "Casey: I made a stop, okay? Is that a crime?",
        "Tom: Tone.",
        "Casey: So, can I stay?",
        "Tom: We'll talk about that.",
        "Casey: What's to talk about?",
        "Margo: There's a lot to talk about.",
        "Tom: So, where did you go?",
        "Casey: Come on, Dad, don't. Look, I'm here. Nothing's wrong.",
        "Margo: Where were you? Where did you go?",
        "Tom: Your mom wants to know who you were with.",
        "Casey: I saw that jerk, Doc Reese.",
        "Margo: So what happened?",
        "Casey: What do you care?",
        "Margo: Casey, please let me try to explain what happened between me and Doc.",
        "Casey: I know what happened, Mom. I'm not stupid.",
        "Margo: No, no. Look --",
        "Casey: I don't want to listen, okay? Look, I don't want to listen to any more lies.",
        "Tom: Hey, hey, that's enough. Your mom is still your mom and as long as I'm around you will treat her with the respect she deserves. Do you understand me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I can't change what I know.",
        "Lucy: You're wrong.",
        "Dusty: I wish I was. For you. But I'm not.",
        "Dusty: I know worse. I know worse, believe me.",
        "Lucy: Like my father?",
        "Dusty: Hey, Lucy, I know people, I've done my homework, you know, people who know what happened. >From the time you got mugged in Metro, all the way through Reno and it all goes back to your old man. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you, but I guess its part of growing up, you know, you got to take off the glasses.",
        "Lucy: Don't talk to me about growing up. I have done my share in the past couple of months.",
        "Dusty: Yes, you have. Yes, you have.",
        "Lucy: But you still want me to believe something I know in my heart could never be true? Sorry, Dusty, I can't do that. I have to go check on my mom.",
        "Dusty: I'll come with you.",
        "Lucy: No. It'll just make things worse. Please stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Sierra. Sierra, come on. Let's let John do his work.",
        "Sierra: No.",
        "Craig: Come on.",
        "Sierra: I don't want to leave him.",
        "Craig: Come on. It's best. Come on. Come on.",
        "Craig: Alan didn't make it.",
        "Lucinda: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Sierra: We were so happy. Why? Why?",
        "Lucy: Daddy.",
        "Craig: Oh, baby, I think his ticker just gave out.",
        "Lucy: Did Mom get to say good-bye?",
        "Craig: I don't know that he regained consciousness.",
        "Sierra: No, he did. He took his last breath and he told me something. It must have been very important to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey, I am ashamed of myself. I am ashamed of the way that I've acted, and all the lies that I've told. And somehow I just forgot that in a family, what one person does affects everyone.",
        "Casey: Great. We done?",
        "Margo: No, no. Listen to me. Listen to me. You've got to know that Doc Reese and I did not have an affair.",
        "Casey: Then why did Dad move out?",
        "Margo: Because, um -- you know, this is not, I'm not trying to make excuses, it's that I just found myself going through something, I don't know, a loneliness, and somehow I listened to, I was blinded by somebody else coming along and paying a special kind of attention to me. And I made a lot of really stupid, bad choices that hurt all of us.",
        "Casey: Why were you lonely? You had me, you had Dad.",
        "Margo: I don't know, it just felt like everybody was moving so far away from me. And you and Adam, you are grown now and you just didn't need me the same way that you used to. And your father was appointed D.A. again and he had his plate so full and we never made time for one another. I am making excuses. And I'm sorry, but my point is that I know that I've hurt you and your father very, very much. And I love you both very, very much. And I don't want to lose you, either one of you.",
        "Casey: What about Doc?",
        "Margo: Oh, my God, baby, you have my word, you have my word that Doc Reese is out of our lives forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You don't get to talk about this baby.",
        "Doc: Listen, I'm not trying to upset you.",
        "Jessica: This baby is mine and Ben's.",
        "Doc: Well, did I say it wasn't? Listen, I'm not trying to make things worse here.",
        "Jessica: You know, that's how it is, right? You never mean to hurt anybody, but the body count keeps rising!",
        "Doc: Hey, hey, don't put this all on me. You were as ready and willing as I was in the room that night.",
        "Jessica: And I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Ooh!",
        "Doc: Hey, Jessica, what's wrong? Jessica?",
        "Jessica: The baby. Oh, my God, the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Jennifer? Jen, I'm so glad that I caught up with you. We need to talk.",
        "Jennifer: Why are you doing this to me? I don't want you here. I don't want to see you ever again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Frank, what a pleasant surprise. Up for a game of chess?",
        "Frank: Sorry, sir, you've got guests.",
        "Paul: Sir?",
        "James: Well, well, well. Hardly the happy couple I was expecting.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Jordan's busy trying to patch things up with Jennifer. Is that an unexpected surprise? You know, we're just full of them.",
        "James: Well, do tell.",
        "Paul: We tossed around your little ultimatum.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan and I considered it.",
        "Paul: In the end, the answer was no. To all of it.",
        "James: Hmm, rather unfortunate for the lad.",
        "Paul: Unfortunate for you. But wait, it gets worse. Governor?",
        "Governor: Mr. Stenbeck, I've just obtained a court order transferring you to a maximum security facility in California, effective immediately.",
        "James: California?",
        "Governor: You're to be placed in solitary confinement until it is deemed you are no longer a threat to others.",
        "Paul: And that, Dad, is checkmate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What did Alan say?",
        "Craig: That's none of our business.",
        "Dusty: I'm asking a question.",
        "Craig: What does it matter? He probably wasn't even coherent with all the sedation.",
        "Sierra: No, I understood exactly what he said. Right before he died he uttered one single word. \"Craig.\"",

        "James: You've been painfully silent. What do you have to say about all of this? I mean, you're an intelligent woman. You know how to weigh the consequences. Are you sure this is what you really want?"
