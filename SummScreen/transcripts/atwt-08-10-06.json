        "Casey: Call him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, Carly. It's Will. I'm looking for Gwen. Long story short, we had a fight and she split. If she's with you, can you tell her to call me. Or just ask her to call me. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: His voice mail is picking up.",
        "Casey: Don't waste your time hitting redial. Just go home.",
        "Gwen: I really don't know how to do that right now.",
        "Casey: You know what? I really don't know how to fix what's going on with Maddie and me, either. Or if it's even fixable.",
        "Gwen: Do you want it to be?",
        "Casey: Yeah, but my mom doesn't want us to see each other.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Casey: Maddie's meltdowns, the murders, the attack at Snyder pond. My mom thinks I can do better.",
        "Gwen: So, you staying away from her?",
        "Casey: No, I couldn't. I snuck into the station last night to see her.",
        "Gwen: You did? What happened?",
        "Casey: She kicked me out. Totally ripped me apart.",
        "Gwen: Casey, you didn't even say anything about that when I was blubbering about Will last night. Why don't you go find her?",
        "Casey: Did you miss the kick me out part? She doesn't want to see me.",
        "Gwen: Hey, just because my relationship's tanking, does not mean that you can't save yours. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Mmm. Does anything say good morning like breakfast in a hotel? Look at the coffee and the clinking of the silverware --",
        "Maddie: The courtesy newspaper with my name in the headlines --",
        "Henry: Honey, no one's reading the headlines. They're doing Sudoku.",
        "Maddie: Why can't I just eat in our room?",
        "Henry: Because we have been summoned by Sister Eve, A.K.A she who must be obeyed.",
        "Maddie: You obey. I'll go back to bed.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, she said she's got a surprise. Come here. Surprise for you here that's going to do you some good. And that in turn, will do me some good. There she is. Who's that? Ah, this is your surprise?",
        "Eve: Don't start.",
        "Louis: Henry, long time.",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Eve: Maddie, look who's here just to see you, all the way from Chicago.",
        "Louis: Maddie. My favorite sister-in-law. How long's it been since I got to do this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You could have had these messengered to me with my signature, you know.",
        "Dusty: I like to meet face-to face. Especially when it's your face.",
        "Lucinda: Charmer. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: How'd you sleep?",
        "Lucinda: Huh?",
        "Dusty: With all the drama, trying to pull Lucy away from Damian.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what makes you think that Lucy takes orders from me, or from anyone?",
        "Dusty: She's still at Fairwinds?",
        "Lucinda: She didn't want to leave until she said good-bye to Luke.",
        "Dusty: She didn't stick around to say good-bye to Luke. She stuck around to try to bust Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Morning. What's with all the luggage in the hallway? I thought you guys weren't leaving for Malta until tomorrow.",
        "Luke: His doctor needs him home tonight.",
        "Lucy: Tonight? But isn't there something I can do for Damian here?",
        "Luke: You mean, like cure him? Or prove that he's lying about his illness? Look, Lucy, I know all about you trying to expose Damian as a fake. But it's not going to fly. I'm going to Malta no matter what, so you might as well stop spying on Damian.",
        "Damian: Morning, kids. Is everything all right?",
        "Lucy: I was hoping to spend the next 24 hours with my handsome guys. But Luke says you're leaving tonight.",
        "Damian: And you miss us already.",
        "Lucy: Don't joke. I do.",
        "Luke: I'm out of here.",
        "Damian: Luciano, is something wrong?",
        "Luke: No, I'm just going to go make the rounds, you know, say good-bye to my friends. I won't be long.",
        "Damian: Okay.",
        "Lucy: I'll be right back. Luke, thanks for not giving me away.",
        "Luke: I didn't do it for you. I did it because Damian likes you and I don't want to see him upset. And with everything that he's going through, he's under so much stress. I don't want anyone piling on anymore.",
        "Lucy: I didn't want to doubt Damian. But I also don't want you leaving your home and your family, your friends, because of some bogus disease.",
        "Luke: He gave you access to his medical records, to his doctors. Did you find anything that proves that he's lying?",
        "Lucy: No. And I'm not going to.",
        "Luke: So, what are you saying?",
        "Lucy: If you really believe Damian's sick, for the sake of keeping the peace, I'll let it go.",
        "Luke: Thanks, Luce. So, now can you work my dad?",
        "Lucy: Holden loves you. He hates the idea of you being so far away.",
        "Luke: I hate it, too. Especially with the way we ended things last night.",
        "Lucy: Luke, nothing's ended. Nothing's over.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it was good-bye. And he doesn't even know that --",
        "Lucy: Know what?",
        "Luke: Nothing. I've got to go.",
        "Lucy: Okay. Will you just come and find me and give me hug before you take off?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Lucy: Hi, Sherry. This is Dr. Montgomery. I need you to take me off the rotation today. My grandmother's not feeling well, and I'm staying here to take care of her. I'll tell her, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I see this guy outside the hospital records room. He's focused on the door.",
        "Lucinda: And Lucy's inside?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucinda: Yes. Well, she's looking for Damian's old medical records. Did the guy, this guy, did he approach her?",
        "Dusty: No, but I'm sure he's with Grimaldi or vice versa. If Grimaldi still thinks that Lucy's trying to pull the plug on his lie --",
        "Lucinda: I have go to get that girl out of there.",
        "Dusty: Well, I asked Holden to talk to her.",
        "Lucinda: I beg your pardon.",
        "Dusty: Without going around you. Of course.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, of course. What do you mean? You just want to be perceived, don't you -- as a rescuer of Lucy. You want to be the big hero. What have you accomplished with that? Holden's peace of mind is shattered. He has a wife that's in a coma. A newborn who's motherless --",
        "Dusty: I know.",
        "Lucinda: And now, now Lucy is more in there with Damian than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What is he doing here?",
        "Eve: Maddie, is that any way to welcome Louis?",
        "Maddie: I just -- I wasn't expecting him -- I thought he had to work.",
        "Louis: I took a few personal days. Just for you, Kiddo.",
        "Eve: And I told Louis what was happening here with you --",
        "Maddie: What did you tell him, Eve? That I was a serial Slasher?",
        "Henry: It's okay, Maddie. It's okay.",
        "Louis: I'm here because we're family. Because I care, and I want to help you.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well you know what I want? I want all of you to stop caring because you're suffocating me with all this caring. So just stop!",
        "Eve: Maddie!",
        "Henry: Let her go, Eve. Let her go. Louie, you still watching the waistline like a shotgun bride? Because they do a monster eggs Benny at this joint.",
        "Eve: Henry, you know he prefers Louis.",
        "Henry: Well, to-may-toe, toe-mah-toe. Why quibble when our girl's in trouble.",
        "Casey: Henry, hey, where's Maddie?",
        "Henry: She left.",
        "Casey: Is she in her room?",
        "Henry: She said something about taking a nap.",
        "Casey: All right, well thanks.",
        "Louis: Wait. What do you want with Maddie?",
        "Casey: What's it to you?",
        "Louis: I asked you a question.",
        "Casey: Answer mine first. Who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Have you seen Gwen?",
        "Jade: Oh, hey, Will. No, not since our fight. God, you look like hell.",
        "Will: Yeah, well maybe because I'm living it?",
        "Jade: Well, let me get you some coffee or something to eat.",
        "Will: No, don't be nice to me. You just make it worse.",
        "Jade: Excuse me?",
        "Will: Look, I'm sorry for the way I treated you last night.",
        "Jade: Forget it, its okay.",
        "Will: No, I was a total jerk. Blaming you for my life crashing, when it's my own fault.",
        "Jade: Well, how about not blaming anybody?",
        "Will: I should have told Gwen the truth after you and I were together. Back when she could understand and maybe forgive me. And then none of this would be happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Not now, barbara. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Barbara: Honey, what's wrong? Where's Will?",
        "Gwen: He's in there. With his new girlfriend.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Gwen: You called it. You called it exactly right. Jade is not my friend. And since Will slept with her, I'm not sure he's my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Gwen! Oh my God! Please tell me that Gwen is mistaken. That you didn't risk your marriage to bed this --",
        "Will: Have you seen Gwen?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I did. Just now. She was here watching you. Will, wait!",
        "Jade: Will!",
        "Barbara: One move and I will snap you like a twig. Will! Wait!",
        "Will: I got to find Gwen.",
        "Barbara: That's the worst thing that you could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Louis, this is Casey Hughes.",
        "Louis: That tells me a whole lot.",
        "Eve: He's Maddie's boyfriend. Well, I mean, they used to date. Casey, this is my husband, Louis. Maddie's brother-in-law. He's here all the way from --",
        "Henry: Chicago. The theory being the more the merrier. So, another theory shot to hell.",
        "Louis: So you and Maddie, just how close were you?",
        "Eve: Louis.",
        "Louis: Fair question. Maddie's in trouble, acting not like herself. I want to find out who's responsible.",
        "Casey: So do I.",
        "Louis: Is that right? You think you have a lock on what's good for Maddie?",
        "Casey: I didn't say that. But I care about her a lot.",
        "Louis: Define care. First base? Second? Did you pressure her to have sex?",
        "Casey: No, no, I never pressured her to do anything. We never even --",
        "Louis: What? Why should we believe you? How do we know you're not responsible for all this trouble Maddie's in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, I got to find Gwen.",
        "Barbara: She doesn't need to see you now.",
        "Will: And you get to decide that? I'm her husband, damn it.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I know how much that meant to you when you slept with another woman.",
        "Will: What do you want me to do? Just let her walk out of my life?",
        "Barbara: She's not going to listen to anything that you have to say right now. Let me go to her. Let me talk to her.",
        "Will: No, I'm not letting you run interference between me and Gwen --",
        "Barbara: It's not going to be interference. I will just sit down with her and try to mend some fences here.",
        "Will: No, absolutely not.",
        "Barbara: Somebody's got to something before it's too late, Will.",
        "Will: Don't you think I know that, Mom? I got to fight to get her back. And you're not fighting for me. And besides, she'd probably slam the door in your face.",
        "Barbara: You know what? Your wife and I have gotten a lot closer since your sister died. Besides, I think it's your face she wouldn't want to see.",
        "Will: It didn't mean anything!",
        "Barbara: Well, it certainly meant something to your wife. But don't go to her yet, okay? It's too fresh a betrayal.",
        "Will: Mom, if I could just talk to her --",
        "Barbara: No, let me talk to her, please.",
        "Will: I don't know.",
        "Barbara: Well I do. Trust me. Or you could lose your marriage.",

        "Sergio: Your attractive lady doctor is still messing where she don't belong.",
        "Damian: Damn it, what are you doing here? You worry too much.",
        "Sergio: With good reason.",
        "Damian: No need to remind me --",
        "Sergio: Last night, she was looking for your medical records.",
        "Damian: Well, did she find them?",
        "Sergio: No. But she's like a dog with a bone. She made an excuse not to go into work this morning.",
        "Damian: Because I'm leaving and parting is such sweet sorrow.",
        "Sergio: Your confidence could cost you, Damian.",
        "Damian: I'll handle Lucy.",
        "Sergio: You know what will happen if you're not on the plane with you son tonight.",
        "Damian: Get out, Sergio. Now.",

        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lucy: Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Lucy, Darling, I just need to see you right away.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Lucinda: Are you at Fairwinds?",
        "Lucy: Actually, I'm due in the O.R.",
        "Lucinda: Ah. Do they really need you in there?",
        "Lucy: Well, it's just part of my rotation. You know I've got to scrub up. I'll call you as soon as I'm out.",
        "Lucinda: The instant. And in the meantime, Darling, do not, and I repeat that, do not go back to Fairwinds.",
        "Lucy: Don't worry. Bye.",
        "Dusty: Is she working?",
        "Lucinda: In the O.R. that will keep her busy for a few hours, don't you think? Does that should put your mind to rest? Yes.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Lucinda: No.",
        "Dusty: Security's a joke at that hospital. Maybe I should go down there --",
        "Lucinda: Bravo. But Darling, don't do this to Lucy.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to help.",
        "Lucinda: I know you are. Lucy has very complicated feelings about you. And there are reasons why I tell you to stay away from her --",
        "Dusty: All right. Come on, you don't have to draw me a picture. Okay, all right, I'll stay out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Damian, great, you're still here.",
        "Damian: Well, I took your \"be right back\" as a promise.",
        "Lucy: Then, let's make it worth your wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on -- \"As the World Turns\"",
        "Gwen: Thank you for getting me through this.",
        "Lucy: How do you take your tea?",
        "Damian: Well worth the wait.",
        "Lucy: Something to remember me by.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lucy, as if I could forget anything about you.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry for running out last night. Hospital emergencies. Goes with the M.D.",
        "Damian: You have your obligations.",
        "Lucy: But our night was cut short and you're leaving in a few hours. I don't suppose there's any way you could postpone?",
        "Damian: I'm afraid that's impossible. My physician requests my presence in Malta immediately. But if time is of the essence, I suggest we make the most of it.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.",
        "Damian: It was inspired a minute ago.",
        "Lucy: But you're leaving, and maybe we should just stop at the first kiss. Make it easier for me not to miss you so much when you're gone.",
        "Damian: The lady's choice.",
        "Lucy: Maybe I shouldn't have kissed you at all.",
        "Damian: No. That's where I must protest.",
        "Lucy: It's just -- I feel, I don't know -- cheated somehow. I mean, I finally found a kindred spirit here in Oakdale, and now you're leaving. This might be the last time that I ever see you. And there's still so much I want to know about you.",
        "Damian: You're a mystery to me too, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Maybe I'm greedy. But I want more than just a kiss to remember you by. I want to spend these next few hours getting to know you better.",
        "Damian: And what is it exactly you'd like to know?",
        "Lucy: So many things. Your favorite movie. Cat person? Dog person? What your first childhood memory is? Your greatest accomplishment? How it feels to know you're dying?",
        "Damian: That's a tall order.",
        "Lucy: Then let's start with something simple. How do you take your tea?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: All right, Maddie has cuts all over her arms. Someone tried to kill her. And the cops are all over her. She's scared and confused, and you guys are hassling me instead of helping her?",
        "Louis: Where do you get off lecturing me?",
        "Henry: Not that you don't deserve it.",
        "Louis: We don't need you sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.",
        "Casey: Sorry, man. You don't get a vote. I care about Maddie. And I'm not going to forget about her, or abandon her, no matter what you say.",
        "Louis: We've got to keep Maddie away from that boy.",
        "Henry: Wow, you know, Louis? He's not exactly my first choice for Maddie. But you had no right to do what you just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I'm sorry, Will.",
        "Will: Yeah, me too.",
        "Jade: I didn't mean to get you in deeper. If there's anything I can do --",
        "Will: No, I don't want you to do anything for me. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not saying it's your fault, but bad stuff happens when I'm around you.",
        "Jade: What? You think I'm bad luck?",
        "Will: You are for me. Look, it doesn't take much for me to make the wrong choice. Somehow, and I don't know what it is -- you make it easier for me to go there. I don't want to sound harsh. You know, I meant what I said. I totally own my cheating, and marriage cracking up -- but like I said last night, it's just not a good idea for us to know each other anymore.",
        "Luke: Hey. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? I thought we were going to have coffee.",
        "Jade: I have to do it later. I've got to go and catch Will.",
        "Luke: What for?",
        "Jade: Gwen walked out on him.",
        "Luke: Did she walk out? Or did you give her a push?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Thanks, thanks for the warm-up, but you can skip the pitch, I don't really feel like talking right now.",
        "Barbara: Okay, how about I talk and you listen?",
        "Gwen: How about you just go, okay? I don't feel like doing this.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you do. Because you want to find a way back to Will. But you want to do it without destroying your own pride and dignity. You want to be able to trust him again.",
        "Gwen: How am I supposed to do that when he's still with her?",
        "Barbara: What you just saw at Java was nothing.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Barbara: Really. When he found out that you were there --",
        "Gwen: Oh, you mean, when he found out that he was busted?",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, he tried to run to you. And I stopped him. I told him that you needed some space.",
        "Gwen: Okay, you know what? And this is you filling up that space.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I know you're hurting here. And I know you're probably believe that this is the end of the world, and the end of your marriage, but it's not.",
        "Gwen: You don't get to say that.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes I do. Because experience backs me up. And I know my son. And I know what he is, and what he is not. And I'm sure that Jade is to blame for this.",
        "Gwen: Will is my husband. He's married to me. I blame him.",
        "Barbara: But you know how she operates. You know how she snaked her way into the Snyder family.",
        "Gwen: But I don't care.",
        "Barbara: You should care. Because it proves that she uses people. Now, I don't know how she seduced Will, but it was probably just to shake the loose change out of his pockets.",
        "Gwen: So, what? Will is just some innocent victim? I'm supposed to just bam! Forgive and forget?",
        "Barbara: No, if you want to make him suffer, you have my blessing, but don't let that user of a witch end your marriage. When you two love each other so much --",
        "Gwen: Love isn't the issue, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Then what is the problem?",
        "Gwen: I know that Will loves me. It would be a lot easier if he didn't. And it doesn't just have to do with what happened with Jade.",
        "Barbara: Then what is it? Tell me what it is, and we can fix it.",
        "Gwen: Look, I know that you are trying to help. I understand that.",
        "Barbara: But why can't you forgive Will?",
        "Gwen: Because -- because I'm afraid! I'm afraid that no matter how much he wants to change or I need him to change, he can't.",
        "Barbara: He can.",
        "Gwen: He is incapable of being in a relationship without lying!",
        "Barbara: Both know who's to blame for that. So go ahead. Blame me. Just don't give up on Will.",
        "Gwen: Man, this is -- this is almost funny. You trying to get me to give Will another chance. I mean, it wasn't that long ago, that breaking us up, that was like your main event.",
        "Barbara: I was hard on you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you were.",
        "Barbara: I had to see what you were made of. To see if you were good enough for my son. I was very tough on you.",
        "Gwen: Yup, and sneaky. And mean.",
        "Barbara: And even with all of my sneaky and mean, conniving, I couldn't come between you two. So, good for you, Gwen. Now surely, you're not going to let some rank amateur succeed when I failed.",
        "Gwen: Why do you care so much?",
        "Barbara: Because you make Will happy. He didn't have a lot of happy growing up.",
        "Gwen: If I make him so happy, then why did he go to her? Why did he sleep with her?",
        "Barbara: Honey, he made a mistake. Gwen, don't you remember what your life was like before you met Will? You were a lost soul. You were living in a garage. You were getting by scraping tips together. You were angry and defiant. And yet, you were showing the world you didn't have to sleep around to get ahead.",
        "Casey: Hey, that's enough. This is between Gwen and Will.",
        "Barbara: And Will helped you, and loved you, and saw his future in you. Honey, do the same for him. Please.",

        "Dusty: Excuse me -- hi, Sherry. That's a beautiful name.",
        "Sherry: Thanks. May I help you?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Can you tell me if Dr. Lucy Montgomery's out of surgery yet?",
        "Sherry: As far as I know, Dr. Montgomery's not in surgery. Her grandmother's not feeling well. So she stayed home to take care of her.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Sherry: No problem.",

        "[Lucy puts medicine in one of the cups]",
        "Lucy: In med school, I was never a tea drinker. We ran on coffee and nerves. Even when I was little, I never had tea parties with my dolls and stuffed animals.",
        "Damian: Really? I thought that was a time-honored ritual for little girls.",
        "Lucy: I wasn't a girly-girl.",
        "Damian: No?",
        "Lucy: I was the classic American tomboy. You know, climbing trees, playing football, baseball, determined to keep up with my brother.",
        "Damian: Well, somehow I can't picture you in torn jeans and your beautiful face all smudged.",
        "Lucy: Well, that phase lasted until I was 13.",
        "Damian: What happened then?",
        "Lucy: Carlos Alvarez beaned me in class with a spitball.",
        "Damian: Ah, then it was love that transformed the tomboy into a beauty.",
        "Lucy: Or something like that. By the way, I'm an avid tea drinker now.",
        "Damian: Yeah, and who's responsible for that?",
        "Lucy: Mark Addis. First year Bio-Chem.",
        "Damian: Well then, let's raise our cups and drink to Mark Addis, and other things. Mmm. Good choice. Lucy, there's something we need to discuss. And it concerns you.",
        "Lucy: What is it?",
        "Damian: When I'm gone, I mean, when Luke and I leave, I want you to stay on here at Fairwinds. The lease is paid up for several months.",
        "Lucy: Even though you knew --",
        "Damian: I was dying? I was still in denial. But when I'm far away, I don't want to worry about you battling with your grandmother, made to live by her rules. Here, at least I can picture you happy.",
        "Lucy: Once you leave, I don't think I'll be happy for a long, long time.",
        "Damian: My sweet Lucy. Here. Let's drink to tomboys and tea parties.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Anyway, I know you care about my mom, so if anything happens, I trust you to keep me up to speed.",
        "Jade: It's just so nice. You know? That at least one person in this whole town doesn't think that I'm a total monster.",
        "Luke: Right. So, what'd you do to Will and Gwen?",
        "Jade: Who says I did anything?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Jade. Every time I see you around lately, you've been hanging out with Will. So, why did they break up and how did you help it?",
        "Jade: That's amazing. You turn from nice to nasty in a heartbeat.",
        "Luke: That's so funny. Because that's exactly what I was thinking about you.",
        "Jade: Whatever I did, I didn't do it alone.",
        "Luke: What do you mean? You're kidding.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Luke: You slept with Will?",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Luke: Yes you did. Jade, Jade, why do you have to take a good thing and ruin it?",
        "Jade: Who says Will and Gwen are such a good thing anyway?",
        "Luke: Well, is it like, your job to announce it to everyone? Jade, come on, what is this? Some sort of sick public service that you do?",
        "Jade: Listen, I didn't want anybody to know anything. I didn't want Gwen to find out. I didn't tell her.",
        "Luke: Well then, how did she find out?",
        "Jade: It was that murderer, Maddie Coleman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Louis: Maddie's my family, too. I have every right to be here.",
        "Eve: Of course you do. Casey was right, we need to focus on Maddie.",
        "Louis: That's what I'm doing. I care about that little girl. Whatever's going on, I want to make it right and I'll move heaven and earth to do that.",
        "Eve: We all want what's best for her.",
        "Louis: That kid that was just here. Just how big a thing was it between him and Maddie? I think I should talk to him again. Shake him down.",
        "Henry: Shake him down? You know what? This is not your problem, okay? Okay? You got that? I'm the brother, that trumps brother-in-law. So, whatever help Maddie needs, she's going to get it from me.",
        "Louis: Oh, you're been doing a bang up job so far, Henry. How do you work that? Do you squeeze in time for Maddie in between placing bets and the cocktail hour?",
        "Eve: Stop it, please, both of you.",
        "Henry: What -- what do you mean -- both of you, he started this. You barge in here thinking you know my sister, thinking you have all the answers? Louis, that attitude might sell widgets in Coconino County, it's doesn't fly here.",
        "Louis: Show me what's working, Henry. You haven't handled a damned thing so far beside a cocktail shaker. All you did when the going got tough was call my wife for help. And by then, Maddie was already falling apart.",
        "Eve: Louis, you really have no idea what it's been like --",
        "Louis: And now, things have gone from bad to worse. Okay, Maddie's running around swamps, getting herself cut with knives, being grilled by the cops --",
        "Eve: And what would you have done if you were here?",
        "Louis: I would have talked to her.",
        "Henry: Really, well, we tried that.",
        "Louis: Now we'll try something different. Maddie and I were very close when she lived in Chicago. If anyone can get her to open up, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Barbara's right.",
        "Casey: Don't even go there.",
        "Gwen: No, she's right. My life was a mess before Will was in it.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I was a part of that mess.",
        "Gwen: Don't even go there.",
        "Casey: Look, Gwen, the point is, who expects you to have it figured out at our age?",
        "Gwen: I did. I mean, I thought I did, when I was with Will. For the first time in my life, I didn't go running for the hills when something good came along. And he stayed, you know, no matter how crazy things got. And life was good, it just, it made sense. It's like with you and Maddie.",
        "Casey: Things never made sense with me and Maddie. She drove me nuts. It was like nails on a chalkboard. Then it turned out, that the things that drove me crazy, drove me crazy.",
        "Gwen: You didn't get to talk to her, huh?",
        "Casey: No. Her family formed this tight little posse that I'm not a part of. But whatever, that's not going to stop me.",
        "Gwen: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Checking up on you. Seeing if you're okay.",
        "Gwen: Well, I went to Java. You know, to go see Will.",
        "Casey: That's great.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, and guess who's hand he was holding?",
        "Casey: Man, what is wrong with him?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. But if I was remotely close to going back home, he can forget it.",
        "Casey: Just give yourself time to cool off.",
        "Gwen: If hell freezes over, I'm not going back to that place.",
        "Casey: So, what's the plan?",
        "Gwen: Well, I called Carly, but she's not around. So, I guess I'm going to be spending another luxurious night here on the couch.",
        "Casey: Or how about this? Why don't you come home with me?",
        "Gwen: Are you serious?",
        "Casey: Yeah, it'll be fun. We can hang out in my room with your guitar and write some sappy songs that rhyme with Will and Maddie.",
        "Gwen: Your parents don't have cable yet?",
        "Casey: Speaking of them. They're not around much right now so -",
        "Gwen: Okay, but if they are, are they going to have a problem with me staying in their house with you because --",
        "Casey: No, they'll be fine. You can stay in Maddie's old room.",
        "Gwen: I don't know about that --",
        "Casey: Well, I'm not taking no, so -- I'm not going to let you float around while there's a killer on the loose.",
        "Gwen: Okay, okay. But my stuff is still back at the house.",
        "Casey: You want me to stop by and get it?",
        "Gwen: No. But I could use some back up.",
        "Casey: You got it.",
        "Gwen: You're the best, you know that? Thank you for getting me through this.",
        "Casey: I think the best prescription in life...",
        "Gwen: I'm serious, Casey. They'd be mopping me off the floor if it wasn't for you.",
        "Casey: My dad always says there's safety in numbers.",
        "Gwen: I know what he meant.",
        "Casey: So, how are we going to work this?",
        "Gwen: Well, I've got some stuff that I want to finish up here.",
        "Casey: My grandma wouldn't care if you took the day off.",
        "Gwen: I know. I just want to keep, you know, doing things.",
        "Casey: All right, I'm going to go home and tell my parents that you're going to stay with us.",
        "Gwen: You're sure?",
        "Casey: Yeah, no worries. And just call me or text me when you're on your way home and I'll meet you there.",

        "Jade: You don't know that.",
        "Luke: Lives get broken. They don't have to stay that way. Will and Gwen, you know, they've got the right stuff. They'll make it work.",
        "Jade: Gwen is not the only woman on the planet.",
        "Luke: She is for Will.",
        "Jade: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Luke: Listen, Jade, when are you going to get a partial clue? As long as Gwen's around, Will's going to do whatever it takes to get her back.",
        "Jade: Unless Gwen's not around much longer \u0096",

        "Dusty: Like a million bucks.",
        "Lucinda: Make that several, Darling. And by the way, no, no, Lucy hasn't called me. But she will call me the instant she's out of the O.R.",
