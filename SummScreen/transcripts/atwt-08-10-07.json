        "Lily: Oh, wait up.",
        "Holden: Hey ---",
        "Lily: I'm coming with you.",
        "Holden: I thought I was picking up Faith.",
        "Lily: I thought the three of us could go to Al's and maybe have an early birthday celebration.",
        "Holden: Oh, really? You know what, one day, that's enough for me.",
        "Lily: Oh, don't be like that. I just came from the jewelers. And your birthday present was ready early --",
        "Holden: You know what? Just hold onto it.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on. Come on, open it. Please?",
        "Holden: Right here?",
        "Lily: Please.",
        "Holden: And if I don't open it, you will, right?",
        "Lily: You know me so well. Yes.",
        "Holden: All right. Wow.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Do you recognize that? It's your grandfather's watch.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it's beautiful.",
        "Lily: I had it all refurbished and engraved and -- like it?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. I love it, but --",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: I hope you don't think it's going to make me forget.",
        "Lily: Is giving that money to Carly so terrible?",
        "Holden: No, but keeping it from everyone, that was the bad part. So, if you think this is going to make it all go away, then maybe you should take it back. Because I can't accept it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Dude, flooding the whole place.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, it doesn't matter.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",

        "Katie: Yes. I'm exhausted and my bed is calling to me.",
        "Brad: I would love to know what it says.",
        "Katie: Not a chance. I'm just going to read until I fall asleep.",
        "Brad: Boring.",
        "Katie: That's me.",
        "Brad: No, we can read here. We could peruse through these scripts, you know, and keep each other awake, with comments. Order in some chow.",
        "Katie: No thanks.",
        "Brad: I know you haven't eaten.",
        "Katie: I hit the snack machine.",
        "Brad: That doesn't count. Okay, we can go to Emma's farm and scare up something from the fridge.",
        "Katie: No thanks. I will pass.",
        "Brad: Oh, are you going to turn down warm peach pie with a scoop of vanilla? We could sit out on the porch --",
        "Katie: Brad, stop it. Stop it. I don't need you to take care of me.",
        "Brad: Okay, I know you don't need me but maybe this time I need you.",

        "Kit: I'll show you when I get a minute.",
        "Jack: You sure that my old lady didn't tell you where she was headed?",
        "Kit: Honey, she was gone before I got back. Well, look at you, she got you all shook up. Don't you worry. If she has walked out on you, I got a feeling she can take care of herself just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Silas: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Carly: I'm taking my son out of here.",
        "Silas: You're not going anywhere with that boy.",
        "Carly: You got your ransom money, I get J.J. that was the deal.",
        "Silas: How did you find this place? The only person -- you followed Kit up here, didn't you?",
        "Carly: Why don't you just put that thing down and we can talk about it, okay? Outside. You've put him through enough.",
        "Silas: I didn't say you could leave.",
        "Carly: Oh, God.",
        "J.J.: Mom!",
        "Carly: Keep going. J.J., run! Get help!",
        "Silas: You shouldn't have done that!",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Carly: What have you done to my son? If you harmed one hair on his head -- put the gun down. What the hell is the matter with you? He's just a child.",
        "Ava: Next time, it's not going to be a warning shot.",
        "Carly: Hey, are you okay?",
        "J.J.: I'm fine, Mom, really.",
        "Carly: Oh, God, I love you.",
        "J.J.: I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Ava: What did I tell you? This is definitely not worth the trouble.",

        "Ava: Like you never broke your word before.",
        "Silas: Well, I plan on keeping it, all right!",
        "Ava: Okay.",

        "Silas: Jack? As in Jack Snyder, the detective? [Cell phone rings] And here I thought my luck was running out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Pick up, Carly.",
        "Kit: Are you helping me or chasing your woman?",
        "Jack: I'll be right there.",
        "Kit: I need you now. The customers are pounding the bar. Give them four shots of bourbon with beer chasers.",

        "Kit: This is Kit.",
        "Silas: I need another favor.",
        "Kit: I'm kind of busy. The girl I just hired took off and I've got a roomful of thirsty customers.",
        "Silas: Was that girl you hired with a guy? Dude that goes by the name of Jack?",
        "Kit: She said his name was Ned.",
        "Silas: He's not. He's a cop. And he and his lady friend are looking to make trouble for me and Ava.",
        "Kit: Go on.",
        "Silas: Well, that's where the favor comes in.",
        "Kit: I'm listening. Yeah, I got it. You're going to owe me for this.",
        "Jack: So whoever was just on the phone -- they say something about me?",
        "Kit: How did you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What the matter, Brad? Another one of your old girlfriends decide it was payback time?",
        "Brad: I hate to break it to you, but I have not broken as many hearts as you think.",
        "Katie: So, what is it then? Besides not wanting to be alone.",
        "Brad: It's Parker. I mean, he's -- he's -- he's totally out of control. I mean, he's just acting out ever since J.J. was kidnapped. And you know, he's not -- he just leaves and he doesn't ask for permission. You know, he's not listening to me, Meg, and since Emma's been away, it's --",
        "Katie: Oh, poor Parker. I know he and J.J. were fighting a lot before he was taken. Parker probably just feels bad about something that he said or something he did. I mean, we've all been there.",
        "Brad: I was hoping you could talk to him.",
        "Katie: Me?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: He's not going to talk to me about his feelings --",
        "Brad: Oh, come on, come on. Maybe he'll open up. He says he likes you. He told me so.",
        "Katie: That's because I respect his privacy. Because I don't ask him questions that he doesn't want to answer.",
        "Brad: Katie, Parker's in trouble. Okay, I don't want anything to happen on my watch. It's bad enough that Jack and Carly got one kid missing.",
        "Katie: Okay. Wow, you're pulling out the stops here. This better on the level --",
        "Brad: Why wouldn't it? You know, we're in the middle of a family crisis.",
        "Katie: Okay, it's just that you've piled work on me, you've been trying to distract me ever since Jack left --",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, you know, so this is all about you? Okay, my nephew can't sleep because he's so scared he's never going to see his brother again. You know, but if you can't get over your stuff to help a kid --",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, okay, stop the guilt trip. I will talk to him.",
        "Brad: Okay. We can do it over pie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I didn't give you the watch so you would forget about something. I gave it to you so you would remember how much you mean to me. You're not going to say anything? You're just going to give me the silent treatment?",
        "Holden: Is that what you think I'm doing?",
        "Lily: I feel like you're punishing me. We talk about the kids. We talk about the every day situations, but we never get into us.",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't know what else to say. When you got back from rehab, I thought that we were on the right track. I guess I was wrong. I mean, why would you make a decision that affects our whole family without consulting me?",
        "Lily: I told you I paid that ransom because I got caught up in Carly's panic. I never intentionally left you out it. I guess, I -- I never stopped to think about the consequences.",
        "Holden: What you didn't stop to think about was me.",
        "Lily: That's not fair.",
        "Holden: It's true, isn't it? I need to go feed my meter.",

        "Noah: Hey, Maddie, I'm glad you're back.",
        "Maddie: Hey -- hi.",
        "Noah: I thought you'd be tied up with your brother all night.",
        "Maddie: Oh, no, no, no, it was a waste to time going. I suck at emotional rescues.",
        "Noah: That's not true.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, it is. You should see Henry and Vienna now. They are more depressed now than when I found them.",
        "Luke: Did they break up again?",
        "Maddie: No, it's just money issues. But nothing a few million can't solve.",
        "Noah: There's a lot of that going around.",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Luke: Well, at least they have each other.",
        "Maddie: So, I'm kind of bummed. It looks like I missed out on a good time. Or not. What's going on? Obviously you went swimming.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, we did. It was great.",
        "Maddie: Isn't the pond awesome?",
        "Noah: Yeah, only now I'm starving. Let's go grab a pizza.",
        "Maddie: What? A pizza? We have all this food here. You look like you're about to dig in anyway.",
        "Luke: Yeah, we were.",
        "Noah: I don't want to, you know, clean out the fridge, you know, from his grandma.",
        "Luke: Nobody cares.",
        "Noah: Well, still, now that Maddie's here, I just feel like taking her out. You know, and you don't mind, do you?",
        "Luke: Why should I?",
        "Maddie: Well, no, no, no, wait a minute. Come with us. We'll grab pizza. We'll put this stuff away. It will be good.",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Maddie: You don't want Luke to come have pizza with us? What happened? Did you guys get in a fight or something?",
        "Noah: No, no, of course not.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well then, what happened?",
        "Noah: Nothing. That was rude of me, Luke. It's just, you know, now that Maddie is here, I just -- you know, want to be alone with her.",
        "Maddie: Well, we can be. Later.",
        "Noah: I know, but there's something I really want to talk you about.",
        "Maddie: It can't wait a couple of hours?",
        "Luke: Look, its okay. Just go.",
        "Maddie: No, no, this is stupid.",
        "Luke: No, no, I'm fine here. You guys really just -- just go.",
        "Noah: Thanks, Man. You know, rain check, okay?",
        "Luke: No problem.",
        "Maddie: Um, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So glad I could catch up with you and Daddy so we could have dinner together. How was the movie?",
        "Faith: Fine. If you like penguins.",
        "Lily: Penguins. Who doesn't like penguins? I love penguins. Any guy in a tuxedo is okay by me. So, we're here at Al's. Got to have burger or chicken fingers?",
        "Faith: I'm not really hungry.",
        "Lily: Faith, we talked about skipping meals. You really shouldn't.",
        "Faith: It's only because I had so much popcorn. If you want to ask Angie, you can.",
        "Holden: I believe you, Honey.",
        "Lily: You didn't get sick?",
        "Faith: No.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: It's work.",
        "Lily: Oh --",
        "Holden: I've got to take that. Um, you know what? There's too much static here, so --",
        "Lily: All right. Bad -- bad service in here.",
        "Faith: Is Dad okay?",
        "Lily: Huh? Oh, it's probably a call about a horse that he's had his eye on.",
        "Faith: He hasn't talked to me about getting any new horses.",
        "Lily: No? Has he talked to you about the watch that I got him? Of course he didn't talk to you about the watch, because I just gave it to him for his birthday.",
        "Faith: Mom, you're just doing it again.",
        "Lily: Doing what?",
        "Faith: Acting like everything's fine when it's not. Just tell me the truth. Are you and Dad getting divorced this time for real?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey, Luke.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hi, Katie. The house is all yours. I'm just heading out.",
        "Brad: Is there any pie left?",
        "Luke: I think so. The fridge is pretty stocked. Help yourselves out.",
        "Katie: Wait, where's Parker?",
        "Luke: He's at a sleepover.",
        "Katie: Oh, did he get permission for that?",
        "Luke: Yeah, Brad gave him permission this morning.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: I don't remember that.",
        "Luke: It was when we were mucking out the stalls this morning. Well, anyway, he left a note with the phone number.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's very responsible.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Okay, take it slow.",
        "Katie: You lied to me.",
        "Brad: No, no, not on purpose, I swear. It slipped my mind, Katie--",
        "Katie: You made it sound like I would be some kind of horrible, selfish monster if I didn't rush over here to save Parker from some fate worse than death --",
        "Brad: I never said that.",
        "Katie: You made it sound like he was going off the deep end. People who do that don't usually --",
        "Brad: I may have stretch the truth just a little bit -- a little bit.",
        "Katie: I can't deal with this, okay. Please. I'm just -- I'm worn out.",
        "Brad: Katie, I know -- I know you are. I know you are -- I know you're scared to death for Jack. And that's why I wanted to get you out here. I don't think you should be alone right now. And I don't think Jack would want it either.",
        "Katie: Like you really care what Jack wants. You try to undermine him every chance you get.",
        "Brad: Go ahead, let it out.",
        "Katie: Let what out?",
        "Brad: Let it out. You know you're fed up and we both know why.",
        "Katie: You don't know anything.",
        "Brad: Why can't you just say what you're thinking?",
        "Katie: Which is?",
        "Brad: You get why Jack had to go and save his son, you just don't get why he had to do it with Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So Lee -- Lee left here to take a customer home?",
        "Kit: She said he'd had one too many and didn't want to hand over his car keys. Now she doesn't want to take off until he's sobered up a little bit --",
        "Jack: Yeah, I don't like it at all.",
        "Kit: Yeah, I don't blame you, Ned. From the way she was giving him the eye, she may want to do more than just have coffee, you know? Unfortunately, when Harry drinks, he can -- he can get a little rough.",
        "Jack: Does Lee know about this?",
        "Kit: Well, I told her. I even offered to bring her back, but she seems to think she can handle herself.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what, I'm going to go pick her up. If she's doing this to get to me, it's working.",
        "Kit: Whatever. Decide, I just don't feel like losing another waitress, you know?",
        "Jack: You got the guy's address?",
        "Kit: Yeah. I've got it.",
        "Jack: All right, I shouldn't be long. Are you going to be all right here by yourself?",
        "Kit: Sure. And take your time.",
        "Jack: Thank you for being so understanding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Kit calls Silas on the phone]",
        "Kit: He's coming for you.",
        "Silas: That was fast.",
        "Kit: Yeah, well, I did my part.",
        "Silas: Cops are so predictable. Always want to be play hero.",
        "Carly: What are you going to do to him?",
        "Silas: Now if I told you that, I'd be as dumb as you think I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie, Katie, come on. Come on. I'm not trying to make you feel bad.",
        "Katie: I know. I can't get a hold of Jack right now and all I want to do is hear his voice and tell him how much I love him. But I can't get a hold of him because I could be hurting him --",
        "Brad: Right, right, I know. And you accept that.",
        "Katie: Do I have any other choice?",
        "Brad: Carly thinks she does.",
        "Katie: J.J. is Carly's son. That makes it different.",
        "Brad: Well, you don't think she's going to try to play this for all it's worth?",
        "Katie: It's not a romantic getaway, Brad. They are fighting for the life of their son.",
        "Brad: You're right. I'm glad you see it that way.",
        "Katie: Oh, don't give me too much credit. There's a part of me that feels very, very sorry for myself that Jack and I didn't get one carefree moment together to celebrate our engagement. How selfish is that?",
        "Brad: Well, actually, it sounds surprisingly human.",
        "Katie: When I told Henry and Vienna about the engagement, they were so excited. Vienna wanted to throw me a shower, but that would just be wrong. I told her not to.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, well, you can always hold off on the shower for now. But I'm sure that we can, you know, do something to celebrate your moment without raising any eyebrows.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'll send myself flowers.",
        "Brad: No, I'd go one step, you know, further than that. Okay -- what -- we can do something right here, right now. All right, come on, come on.",
        "Katie: What are you up to?",
        "Brad: I -- shh, shh, shh! I know Emma's secret hiding places. You deserve to have a celebration and that is exactly what you are going to get. So, let's get this party started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Why would you think that your dad and I are getting a divorce?",
        "Faith: Because I saw you guys earlier, in Old Town. I saw you guys fighting.",
        "Lily: Honey, grown-ups have disagreements all the time.",
        "Faith: Are you taking diet pills again?",
        "Lily: No. Absolute -- no. No, I would never make that mistake again.",
        "Faith: Well, then, what's wrong? Why is Dad so upset?",
        "Lily: You don't -- you don't need to know the details.",
        "Faith: Mom, I'm not a baby.",
        "Lily: Okay. I broke your father's trust. I kept something from him and I don't know if I'll be able to get that trust back.",
        "Faith: You have to. He can't leave again.",
        "Lily: He's not going to leave. We'll work it out.",
        "Faith: Well, what if you can't?",
        "Lily: Honey, neither one of us want to get a divorce. You have my word.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",

        "Holden: It already has.",
        "Lily: I told you I paid the money because I thought if I didn't, someone would die. Like I went back to this place where all of these horrible things were happening and I couldn't control them. I thought if I paid the money, then it might stop the nightmare from happening.",
        "Holden: So, wait a minute, you did all of this because of what happened with Rose?",
        "Lily: When she died, I thought about all the things I could have done -- the things that I missed --",
        "Holden: Lily, there's no way that you could have known that anyone would try to poison her.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter, Holden. Don't you see? Because I still blame myself. More for the things that I didn't do when I had the chance. And after she died it's just like -- everything just shut down. It's just kept coming up over and over again at rehab.",
        "Holden: How could losing your sister change everything? I've known you since you were 15. Rose was in your life for three years.",
        "Lily: No, no, she was always here. I just didn't know it. And when I found her, remember -- I felt -- I felt complete.",
        "Holden: I remember when you used to say that about me and the kids.",
        "Lily: Honey, see, you had brothers and sister when you were growing up. When you're adopted, you're alone. When Rose came along, I had -- finally had someone right there, right next to me. It's like all the loneliness I had a child, it just disappeared.",
        "Holden: You know, I hear that. And it makes me feel like the kids and I don't count.",
        "Lily: That's not true. Please. I love you so much. And I need you now more than ever.",
        "Holden: Right. But you don't trust me. Lily, somewhere along the way, that stopped. I don't know why. But if we don't have that, then we don't have a marriage.",

        "Lily: I think -- I just get frantic to make up for all the things that I've done wrong. I feel like I should just handle it myself, not bother you.",
        "Holden: So, maybe when something comes up, we can make a decision together. I mean, what's wrong with that? What you do, is you do it all by yourself. You like to do it that way. It's like with the baby food company. You went against your mother's advice.",
        "Lily: I admitted that I was wrong.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but it's the same pattern. With the ransom money -- you kept me in the dark. And when I want the truth, I have to pry it out of you.",

        "Holden: Do you blame me for thinking that you still might be keeping secrets? When did I stop being the guy that you could talk to?",
        "Lily: Never. Never. It's me. I'm completely ashamed of myself. I totally lost control when I found out Luke was gay. And Faith's eating problems, I handled that so badly. And all those babies getting sick and Ethan getting sick because of me -- those pills were just my way of trying to fix something much deeper.",

        "Maddie: But you would go in a heartbeat if your father wasn't stopping you.",
        "Noah: That's true, but he is. And living with that taught me that just because you want something, doesn't mean it's supposed to happen. Okay, I mean, I'm going to make this work, Maddie. Whether it's something I planned to happen or not.",
        "Maddie: And that's great and I admire that. But don't pretend that it's all good.",
        "Noah: You and Casey made adjustments. I mean, that's what you do.",

        "Noah: But you turned it around.",
        "Maddie: No. All I could do was keep going, so that's what I did.",

        "Katie: Yeah.",
