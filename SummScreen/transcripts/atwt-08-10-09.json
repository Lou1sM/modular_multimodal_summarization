        "Katie finally agrees to team up and do some recognizance work to help Henry find out what his mother is up to. Barbara is demanding that Emily tell her where Paul is, but she won't budge. It isn't necessary when a noise causes Barbara to figure out where Paul is hiding. They find him three sheets to the wind babbling about wine and his \u0091dear ole dad.' Barbara wants to take him to the hospital, but Emily is adamant that he not go. Paul decides to go with Barbara, but winks at Emily that he has a plan. At the hospital, Paul and Emily trick Barbara and knock her unconscious with a wine bottle. Paul decides he needs to straighten this out once and for all and go talk to the doctors. Emily pleads with him to reconsider, but Paul is adamant. Meg and Holden disagree about Lily getting involved with her and Damian's relationship. Meg is sure Lily still has feelings for Damian, but Holden is still in the dark about that claiming Lily only wants what is best for her . like everyone else. Meg is somewhat insecure as well as to if Holden thinks Damian has a hold on Lily and vice versa. Meanwhile, Lily and Damian are kissing passionately; their amorous act is secretly seen by Faith. Lily pulls back and claims that she didn't want the kiss and it was all Damian. Damian says she isn't telling the truth and she still loves him. Lily can't hide her jealousy of Meg and how they are sleeping together, as Damian calls her on her obvious ongoing relationship with Holden so how can she say anything. Damian asks her to leave Holden and be with him, but a guilt ridden and nervous Lily tells him Holden is her soul mate and she won't leave her family. An angry Damian orders her out of his life then. Luke and Holden head back home to pack for their trip, where Lily is trying to regain her composure. She is desperate to forget what happened so she offers to make Holden and Luke's trip a family vacation. Everyone is thrilled, but Faith, who lashes out and heads outside, leaving everyone scratching their heads. Katie tries to hit up Audrey for information on Jay Stanhope, but she is not interested in talking about that. Her mood visibly changes when she gets a note from the person saying he knows she is looking for him and says where she can find him; she leaves quickly leaving Katie wondering. Upstairs, Henry finds his brush and a coffee cup in a bag for a DNA test. He later talks with Katie thinking his mother must have had an affair with Jay and killed him so he couldn't find out she cheated on his dad. Katie thinks it is too out there, but she agrees something is going on. Henry tails his mother. Meg has trouble reaching Damian and shows up at his room nervous and worried that he has changed his mind about them and that his heart is with Lily. Damian lies about how he feels for Lily and claims Meg is the only one in his heart and life. Meg is unsure at first still noticeably insecure, but Damian charms her and soon they are falling into bed, as he tries to forget Lily. Paul is confused when he finds noone in the hospital and most of the doors locked; he tells Emily he needs to look farther. Barbara wakes up, but Emily locks her in the car to give Paul time. Henry confronts Audrey at the same hospital where Paul and Emily are. He thinks she killed Jay, but she admits that Jay isn't dead; he is an alias of another man, who is actually Henry's real father. She wonders if he wants to know who his father really is. Meg feels more secure now, as she lies in Damian's arms not knowing his thoughts are of Lily. Lily tries to find out why Faith is so mad, but she only hints at the fact that Lily is not who she says she is. Later, Luke tries to get Faith to be happy about the vacation, but Faith tells him that she hates her mother and that she isn't the doting mother and wife everyone thinks. Holden has to leave for his meeting before they can get to the bottom of what is eating at Faith, but Luke thinks he should stay and offer support to his mom with Faith, without alluding to what Faith said about Lily. Faith doesn't want Holden to go, but he has to, promising to see them all in the next couple of days. Paul finally finds an unlocked door and walks up behind a man sitting with his back to him in a wheelchair. Paul utters the word \u0096 dad, as he approaches the man."

        "Katie: Ooh! Try to find your classmate.",
        "Henry: I did.",
        "Katie: No, you used classreunion.com.",
        "Henry: It's the same site. They just use different links to lure you in and then take all the life out of your credit card. Kind of a virtual version of my mother.",
        "Katie: I still don't think she's as evil as you say she is.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: I spent nine months attached to that woman's nervous system. I know how she operates.",
        "Katie: You are such a drama queen.",
        "Henry: Okay. Find out when we find the real Jay Stanhope.",
        "Katie: Well, according to the World Wide Web, he doesn't exist.",
        "Henry: And that doesn't make you suspicious?",
        "Katie: Yeah, a little, I guess. But maybe he's just some regular guy who has better things to do with his time than create his internet persona.",
        "Henry: It creates itself. You couldn't stop it even if you wanted to. Which means if this guy is off the grid, he is either dead or the Unabomber, and the Unabomber's in a federal pen. Ergo he is dead. And I bet that doppelganger that Mom's got on her arm -- it'll bet you he's the hit man she hired to kill him.",
        "Katie: Um, aren't murder-for-hire transactions usually kept on the down low?",
        "Henry: I wouldn't know.",
        "Katie: All I'm saying is that why would your mother introduce you to some man who's pretending to be Jay Stanhope if she's planning to kill the real Jay Stanhope?",
        "Henry: To throw me off the scent.",
        "Katie: Why don't we just go to Audrey and ask her for an explanation?",
        "Henry: I did that. She lied to my face like she always does. I've never been able to figure it out if it's because I'm her son or it's just that I'm a guy.",
        "Katie: Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Henry: How are you feeling, hmm?",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Well, I was just thinking if -- if you and the bambino are down with this, you could head over to the Lakeview, maybe have a little tea with the merry murderess to see if you can get her to open up a little bit.",
        "Katie: Um, I don't think that's such a good idea. She knows how close we are.",
        "Henry: Use the \"Power girl unite\" thing. You never know. It's worth a shot.",
        "Katie: I don't know.",
        "Henry: Yeah, right. Why don't you just stay here and put your feet up and incubate?",
        "Katie: Well, I was taken off of bed rest. And this is right up my alley. So if Audrey's hiding anything, I'll get it out of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Where is Paul, and what do you mean he's gone for good?",
        "Emily: You need to leave right now.",
        "Barbara: Where is he?",
        "Emily: He doesn't want to see you, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: He doesn't know what he wants!",
        "Emily: Well, if he were here, which he's not, I wouldn't count on him changing his mind anytime soon.",
        "Barbara: I don't want you anywhere near my son. You are dangerous.",
        "Emily: Well, at least I don't eat my young.",
        "Barbara: You're violent and vengeful and vicious --",
        "Emily: And very, very ready to have security have you thrown out.",
        "Barbara: You can't throw me out, because I have power of attorney.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, goody for you. As long as Paul's got a sound mind, it's a meaningless piece of paper.",
        "Barbara: If Paul were in his right mind, he wouldn't have given you a red cent.",
        "Emily: What are you, the mother, or the accountant?",
        "Barbara: You shot him and left him to die, and then he moves you into his house and buys you a business? That's not insane. That's suicidal. Which means I have an obligation to protect him. And with Paul's psych history and your police record, I have an ironclad case. So get out of my way, 'cause I'm gonna go find my son.",
        "Emily: You'll never find him.",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "Barbara: What was that?",
        "Emily: Clumsy housekeeper.",
        "Barbara: He's here, isn't he?",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? I told you, he's long gone.",
        "Barbara: You're lying, and I know right where he is.",
        "Paul: No! My lovely Bordeaux! Aww! Lost in a sudden and violent collision with the cellar floor. It is believed that alcohol may have been involved. I say the best thing for a dead dog is a new puppy, so I propose a toast. Here's to you --",
        "Barbara: Paul.",
        "Emily: Barbara.",
        "Paul: No, careful. Stop, please. Don't disturb my crime scene.",
        "Barbara: Are you drunk?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: I swear, I -- I didn't -- I didn't tell you were down here.",
        "Barbara: She didn't have to. Everybody hides down here, including your father.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, I know. He left a wine log. He said the '68 Lafitte was just lovely. But, alas, she met with an untimely demise. Oh, my poor little baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What does Lily have to do with your trip being canceled?",
        "Meg: 'Cause Mama was ready to baby-sit Eliza while I was gone until Lily staged an intervention!",
        "Holden: Why would she do that?",
        "Meg: To keep me away from Damian! Apparently, he's an addiction, and I am powerless to make my own decisions.",
        "Holden: I -- I know you're disappointed, but that is no reason to blame Lily.",
        "Meg: Oh, come on! Wake up, Holden! Lily is still hung up on her ex!",
        "Holden: All right, that's enough. Lily's concerned, and she's not the only one around here who thinks that Damian's motives are suspect.",
        "Meg: Oh, 'cause he couldn't possibly be in love with me.",
        "Holden: Did he tell you that? Did he tell you he loved you?",
        "Meg: Why would he choose a single mother with a new baby when he could have any woman he wants?",
        "Holden: That remains to be seen.",
        "Meg: Okay, what are you saying? Do you think Damian still wants Lily back?",
        "Holden: Would you listen to yourself? You're lashing out. You're getting defensive. How could you think that Damian is any good for you?",
        "Meg: The problem isn't Damian.",
        "Holden: I don't think it's such a bad thing that your trip got canceled.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? I'm shocked.",
        "Holden: Look, Lily and I agreed. We're not gonna interfere in your relationship. Maybe Mama backed out of the arrangement because she didn't think you were ready for such a big step.",
        "Meg: No. This was all Lily!",
        "Holden: When have you ever known Mama to do anything she didn't want to do? Lily doesn't have that kind of power over her. None of us do, just like we can't force you to do what we want.",
        "Meg: Oh, and yet somehow, you managed it.",
        "Holden: Mama doesn't like Damian because of everything that he's done to this family. If she can't get you to leave him, she's not gonna enable you.",
        "Meg: So nobody in this family believes that I can make my own decisions?",
        "Holden: Meg, we love you. We care about you. You need to be careful.",
        "Meg: You think I'm an idiot.",
        "Holden: No, you need to be honest with yourself. Are you sure that this relationship with Damian isn't a mistake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You wanted this as much as I did.",
        "Lily: That was a mistake.",
        "Damian: No, it wasn't.",
        "Lily: I divorced you a long time ago.",
        "Damian: So what? A piece of paper doesn't change the way we feel.",
        "Lily: The only thing I feel is disgust. What made you think you could walk in here and kiss me?",
        "Damian: We kissed each other, Lily. We couldn't help ourselves.",
        "Lily: No, no! It was a mistake! And I -- intend to forget it ever happened.",
        "Damian: You can pretend you didn't want it, but I know different. I felt your heart beating against my chest.",
        "Lily: 'Cause you were kissing me against my will! Walk away, Damian. And don't ever mention this again.",
        "Damian: I don't have to. But we both know the truth, Lily. What we have between us -- the attraction, the love -- that will never be over. It's as strong as ever.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Damian: Face the truth, Lily. What we have will never be over.",
        "Lily: What are you doing with Meg?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You are judging Damian on the past.",
        "Holden: That's right.",
        "Meg: Well, I would resent him, too, if I were you. I mean, he -- he swoops in here and tries to lay claim to Luke.",
        "Holden: You know what? Leave Luke out of it.",
        "Meg: But it's all part of the same thing, Holden. He caused you pain, but he's not the same person he used to be when he did those things. Even Luke says so.",
        "Holden: You made the same argument for Paul.",
        "Meg: Paul was sick. Okay, fine. Don't believe me. But what about your son? Luke is giving Damian a second chance. Or do you think he's an idiot, too?",
        "Luke: You talking about me?",
        "Meg: Hey! Good things.",
        "Holden: Everything okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Uh, as it turns out, I'm not going to New York with Damian. But I guess you already knew.",
        "Holden: Are you sorry the trip got canceled?",
        "Luke: No, no. Um, look, Dad, I totally understand if you say no. But would you consider taking me to Kentucky with you after all?",
        "Holden: Of course.",
        "Luke: I'm really sorry about earlier. I didn't want you to feel like a default dad.",
        "Holden: Ouch.",
        "Luke: Look, I would never choose Damian over you. It was a work thing. I'm not used to making those kinds of decisions, especially with no time to think about them.",
        "Holden: That seems to be Damian's management style.",
        "Luke: Maybe. I don't know. But at least everything turned out for the best. You were counting on me. I never should have bailed on you.",
        "Holden: You know what? You don't need to explain anything. It all worked out in the end. So, uh, why don't we get you home and get you packed?",
        "Luke: Bye, Meg.",
        "Meg: Bye.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Come on, Damian. Pick up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Why are you asking me these questions?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Damian: Why does my relationship with Meg matter to you?",
        "Lily: You kissed me. You say you still have feelings for me, but you're sleeping with her.",
        "Damian: You're married to Holden. I assume that means you're sleeping with him. So what did that kiss mean?",
        "Lily: I didn't kiss you.",
        "Damian: You didn't push me away, either.",
        "Lily: You caught me off guard.",
        "Damian: Yes. Familiar refrain. I took advantage of you.",
        "Lily: Get out of my house!",
        "Damian: Answer one question for me first. If I told you I'd drop everything in the morning come to you, that I want us to make a life together, would you leave him?",
        "Lily: Of course not. Holden is the love of my life.",
        "Damian: Is he, or is he just the man you're used to?",
        "Lily: Holden is my soul mate. I will not walk out on this family, not again.",
        "Damian: Then you have no say in what I do.",
        "Lily: I don't want any.",
        "Damian: Then what are you doing, Lily?! Can you tell me that? That's what I thought.",
        "Lily: Damian --",
        "Damian: Don't. I am no longer interested in what you have to say.",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Damian: It will be soon enough.",
        "Lily: What does that mean?",
        "Damian: Stay out of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You have to admit I'm good. Audrey's on her way down for a cup of tea.",
        "Henry: Good. You'll -- you'll be paying, by the way, because she is the Olympic champion of getting other people to pick up the check.",
        "Katie: If this whole thing turns out to be a figment of your paranoid imagination --",
        "Henry: No, listen to me, Katie. She is homicidal, okay? You are saving men's lives here. Now, just keep her here while I go up and check on her room.",
        "Katie: You really think she's gonna leave incriminating evidence all around her room?",
        "Henry: I found her dead boyfriend's obituaries.",
        "Katie: And there wasn't a Jay Stanhope in the bunch.",
        "Henry: Serial killers like to keep souvenirs, okay? So if she did kill the original Jay Stanhope, they'll be a piece of him up there somewhere.",
        "Katie: Oh, stop! You're freaking out the baby. Okay. You should hide. You should hide. Hide, hide, hide. She's gonna be here any second.",
        "Audrey: Well, hi.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Audrey: Look at you. You are just positively glowing.",
        "Katie: Thanks, Audrey.",
        "Audrey: Thank you for inviting me. I just can't tell you how much it means to me to get to know all of Henry's friends.",
        "Katie: Well, I just want you to tell me about how Henry was when he was a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I can't believe I'm asking this, but would you please help me with him?",
        "Emily: I helped break him out of a hospital. You want me to put him back in? You're the crazy one.",
        "Paul: You know what? I think we're all a little crazy. So here's to the lunatics. Bless us all. Mm. I love this place!",
        "Barbara: And now you're turning into a drunk.",
        "Paul: Working on it. You know what? Why don't you pick yourself out a bottle? According to what's his name --",
        "Barbara: James Stenbeck.",
        "Paul: Yes, dear old dad. Every single one of these bottles is four-star.",
        "Barbara: I don't want a drink, Paul.",
        "Paul: Mm. Emily.",
        "Emily: Huh?",
        "Paul: You want a drink?",
        "Emily: Oh, no. Uh, it's too early for me. Besides, one of us needs to keep our wits, because your mother may be calling the boys with the butterfly nets.",
        "Barbara: Listen to me. This is one of the best hospitals in the country. We're very lucky that they have a bed for you.",
        "Emily: God, are you serious?!",
        "Barbara: This is none of your business, Emily.",
        "Emily: I want her out of here!",
        "Paul: Okay, look, as much as I like a catfight, somebody's gonna get hurt.",
        "Barbara: That is the idea!",
        "Emily: Oh, bring it on, Babs.",
        "Paul: Wow! You be careful, because there's glass --",
        "Emily: You need to stop having so much fun! Your mother wants to have you locked up!",
        "Paul: Emily's right. You're not gonna drag me out of here by force. So it won't be necessary. I will go with you voluntarily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Haven't seen this brush for a week. Why does she have a coffee mug? Now, why does she need a sample of my DNA?",
        "Katie: So, Henry mentioned that you're seeing someone.",
        "Audrey: He did?",
        "Katie: Yes. Um, what -- what's his name? Jay -- Jay something.",
        "Audrey: My -- my son has a vivid, vivid imagination.",
        "Katie: Yes. Often too vivid.",
        "Audrey: Yeah, you can say that again. You know, you're supposed to encourage children's creativity, so when Henry was little, I tried not to discourage it. But I think now, that's a big mistake, because these days, I think he's really having a tough time keeping a handle on that reality.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Audrey: Oh, he's just blowing things out of proportion a bit, like finding obituaries in my hotel room and making this huge leap that I am now a serial killer.",
        "Katie: Well, Henry is creative.",
        "Audrey: So creative. That's why I wasn't really surprised when he wrote a book. But just wish he would stick to the storytelling like as & story telling. He could get rich that way, maybe.",
        "Katie: Well, actually, he also even mentioned that he got to meet your boyfriend.",
        "Audrey: Jay, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Katie: So, what does Jay do?",
        "Audrey: International man of mystery.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Audrey: I -- I didn't come here to talk about men, really. I came to talk about you, find out all about you. So, please.",
        "Charles: Mrs. Coleman, a messenger just delivered for you. Uh, he said it was urgent.",
        "Audrey: Oh.",
        "Katie: Audrey -- Audrey?",
        "Audrey: Oh. Oh, oh. You know, well, um, this was a treat, so I didn't even bring my purse. You know, I'm gonna catch you later. Is that okay? I'll just catch up with you later with that.",
        "Katie: No, wait. Um -- here you go, Charles.",
        "Charles: Thank you, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Audrey: Could you -- could you just, um, excuse me for one teeny, tiny little moment?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Audrey: Um, I -- I am so sorry. We're gonna have to cut our little tea party just, um, short.",
        "Katie: Is everything okay?",
        "Audrey: Yeah. It's going to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You cannot just walk into a mental institution with her!",
        "Paul: Come on. Pretending takes so much energy. I'm just gonna go see the doctors. I'm gonna show them that I'm sane, and then the whole thing will just --",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, she is using you. Your mother is using you. All she cares about is that you hold onto your money! And she will sock you into a loony bin to make that happen!",
        "Paul: You're not gonna let that happen.",
        "Emily: I can't -- how can I guarantee that? She's already -- she's already signed the commitment papers! Do you know what that means, Paul? That means you walk in, and you don't walk out. That means you take mind-altering drugs. That means you make pot holders!",
        "Barbara: Paul! I am not taking you to some gothic hellhole. It's one of the best clinics in the country.",
        "Paul: I know. You already said that. I'm all yours, okay? Let's go.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Paul: No problem. You're coming, right?",
        "Barbara: She can't.",
        "Paul: Well, she goes, or I don't go.",
        "Barbara: Fine.",
        "Emily: Okay. You can't do this. You cannot do this. You walk into a hospital, you're not walking out!",
        "Paul: Oh, I got this. Maybe I just need one for the road.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey. My two favorite guys.",
        "Luke: Oh, don't let Ethan hear that. He'll be crushed.",
        "Lily: I can't win.",
        "Luke: It was a joke, Mom.",
        "Lily: I -- I know, Sweetie. I'm sorry. I was distracted. I just hate that your dad's leaving on this trip. It's gonna be so much work for him.",
        "Holden: Not anymore, because he's going with me.",
        "Lily: That's great news!",
        "Luke: Yeah. Damian's trip got called off, so I'm free to go.",
        "Holden: Hey, you all right?",
        "Lily: You know what? I've got an idea. Why don't we join you? I mean, you'll only be working for a couple of days. We could rent a car and take off from there.",
        "Holden: Take off where?",
