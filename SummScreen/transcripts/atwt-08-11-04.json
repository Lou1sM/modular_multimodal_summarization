        "Lucinda: Are you sure, Sierra, that you heard Alan correctly?",
        "Sierra: He was perfectly clear.",
        "Lucinda: But, darling, why on earth would his last word on earth be \"Craig\"?",
        "Dusty: Must've been something big.",
        "Craig: Did he say anything else?",
        "Sierra: Nothing.",
        "Lily: That's odd.",
        "Dusty: Isn't it, though? Makes you wonder. You know, a dying man's last word to his wife. Your name?",
        "Lucy: Daddy?",
        "Dusty: You'd think he'd say something special, you know, between Sierra and himself. But, instead, he says your name? The ex-husband?",
        "Lily: What are you implying, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: That it's weird. Makes you wonder.",
        "Craig: No, no, not me, Dusty. Hallucinations, brain damage. He's probably scared to death.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I bet.",
        "Sierra: John?",
        "John: I'm sorry.",
        "Sierra: You did everything you could.",
        "John: This is not a real good time, but there are papers that need to be signed, decisions that need to be made.",
        "Lucinda: I'll do it for you.",
        "Sierra: No, no. He was my husband.",
        "John: We can have more privacy in my office.",
        "Lucinda: We'll wait for you right here.",
        "Sierra: No, no. You don't need to do that.",
        "Craig: You don't have to do this alone, Sierra.",
        "Sierra: No, I'll be fine.",
        "Lucy: She won't be alone. She has me.",
        "Sierra: I would like that.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you're positive?",
        "Sierra: Go ahead. It's something I need to do.",
        "Lily: We'll go back to your place and wait for Sierra.",
        "Lucinda: All right, we'll do that. Well, if there's anything --",
        "Lucy: We'll call you.",
        "Lucinda: I love you, too. I love you. Bye.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Dusty, for everything you've done, but this is a family matter now.",
        "Sierra: But you can stay as long as you want. You saved Lucy.",

        "Bartender: May I help you, sir?",

        "Doc: Nurse, nurse! Can we get some help here?",
        "Jessica: Please, you have to help me. I have severe cramping and pain. I'm six weeks pregnant. Please, get Dr. Schiller.",
        "Doc: She called Dr. Schiller from the car.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Jessica?",
        "Jessica: I think I'm bleeding.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Okay, we'll take her into exam room five.",

        "Jennifer: I heard everything in New York.",
        "Barbara: No, no, you didn't give me a chance to explain anything.",
        "Jennifer: If you think there's an explanation for what you did, you're worse off than I thought.",
        "Barbara: What I did, I did because I love you.",
        "Jennifer: You lied to me and to Paul! You manipulated us into thinking that you were sick again, and I believed you! I dropped everything for you. I was a prisoner in a hotel room for you.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry that I put you through that. I really am.",
        "Jennifer: I should've listened to Paul. He warned me.",
        "Barbara: Warned you about what?",
        "Jennifer: He said that the second that I found someone who loved me, you would try to ruin it.",
        "Barbara: That's not true, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Well, congratulations, Mother. Mission accomplished. Jordan is out of my life.",
        "Barbara: Oh --",
        "Jennifer: No, but there is good news in all of this. I'm going back to Europe.",
        "Barbara: When?",
        "Jennifer: Tonight.",
        "Barbara: For how long?",
        "Jennifer: For good. And you and Jordan can go to hell.",

        "James: Transferred? You can't do that.",
        "Paul: Me? No, I can't. But the governor can. And the governor did.",
        "James: I'll get my lawyers on the phone.",
        "Paul: A waste of time. Your lawyers have no say in this. Neither do you.",
        "Governor: Where you serve your time is at the discretion of the government.",
        "Paul: And the government found you a nice spot in California. Plenty of sun and fresh air, not that you'll be able to see or feel any of that in solitary confinement. But at least you'll be away from Cabot and Jordan and Rosanna, and all the other lives that you've tried to control. Hey, you there? Dad? You? Speechless? Bon voyage.",

        "Ben: My wife --",
        "Nurse: Doc Reese just brought her in.",

        "Ben: All right.",
        "Jessica: How's my baby?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, it's still too early to tell. I'll have to run a couple more tests.",
        "Jessica: There's nothing you can tell me?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Just close your eyes, and try to relax. I'll make arrangements, okay?",
        "Jessica: Please, God, don't punish my baby for what I've done. Please let my baby live.",
        "Ben: Where's Jessica?",
        "Dr. Schiller: I was about to have you paged.",
        "Ben: Where is she? What happened?",
        "Dr. Schiller: I haven't broken the news to her yet.",
        "Ben: What news? Tell me!",
        "Dr. Schiller: I'm not hearing a fetal heartbeat.",
        "Ben: Have you done an ultrasound?",
        "Dr. Schiller: No, no, not yet.",
        "Ben: All right, then there's a chance. Maybe you missed something.",
        "Dr. Schiller: We're setting up for that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, I know you're angry with me, and you have every right to be, but you can't make some kind of impetuous decision like this without thinking things through.",
        "Jennifer: No thought. It's survival instinct. I'm getting away from you.",
        "Barbara: You don't want to leave your brothers, your father --",
        "Jennifer: As if you give a damn what I want! You don't care about me!",
        "Barbara: All I care about is you!",
        "Jennifer: You knew how much I loved Jordan. And I believed you when you said that you accepted our relationship. But the whole time, you were plotting to break us up!",
        "Barbara: That is not true, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: After you fooled us into thinking that you were going blind again? I was the blind one. As usual. I am always the one who takes your side, Mother, and gives you chances, time after time. Well, never again.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Barbara: Walker. Thank goodness it's you. I really need to see you. I'm at home. I'll be waiting.",
        "Jennifer: If you care about that man at all, you'll let him go, before you destroy him, too.",
        "Barbara: There are difficulties and disappointments in every relationship.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I learned that at your knee.",
        "Barbara: It doesn't mean you pack up and leave.",
        "Jennifer: We'll see about that.",
        "Barbara: Walker stood by me during my worst times, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Well, he'll grow to regret it, Mother.",
        "Barbara: You know, we're gonna work things through. And we'll be closer. That's what you and I have always been able to do. We've always been able to overcome anything if we can just talk, Jen!",
        "Jennifer: Yes, this is Jennifer Munson in the penthouse. Could you send a bellman up for my bags? I'll be waiting outside in the car. I need to vacate quickly. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Governor, you've been deceived. I've been a model prisoner. I've kept in isolation, been very quiet. All I want to do is just serve out the rest of my time in peace. You can ask the guards, ask the warden.",
        "Governor: I have been checking around.",
        "James: Then you know --",
        "Governor: -- That corruption is rampant in this facility, yes. But I'm making reform the cornerstone of my re-election campaign.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you very much, Governor.",
        "Governor: We'll be in touch. Good luck.",
        "James: Yes. Good luck. Paul, certainly you're not stupid enough to think this is gonna change anything?",
        "Paul: No, no. This is gonna change everything. Because you're going to be in a pit so dark and so deep that you'll never see the light of day again.",
        "James: Why don't you just hide and watch.",
        "Paul: Free ride's over, old man. No more unlimited phone calls, no more visitors, no more emissaries waiting to do your bidding. You've been cut off. It's all over now.",
        "James: I'm glad to see you do have some Stenbeck blood in you. I just don't know why every time you show some fortitude, it's always against me.",
        "Paul: I don't know. Life is full of irony. Come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "James: Rosanna, you've been painfully silent. What do you have to say about all of this? I mean, you're an intelligent woman. You know how to weigh the consequences. Are you sure this is what you really want?",

        "Dr. Schiller: Ben, I'm so sorry.",

        "Ben: Can I see her?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Sure. Yeah. Give you two some time.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Ben. I'm so sorry.",
        "Ben: Shh.",

        "Jennifer: I have a plane to catch.",
        "Jordan: Listen, just come with me. Listen to what I have to say, please.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, I could listen, but it's not gonna change anything.",
        "Jordan: I have to show you something, okay? Take a look, if you don't like what you see -- you're going to like what you see. But if you don't, I'll let you go. Please?",
        "Jennifer: I have a car waiting.",

        "Barbara: Oh, Walker. Oh, thank goodness you're here. I know that you're still angry with me because I lied about my condition. I know it was a very foolish impulse, but --",
        "Walker: That's a start.",
        "Barbara: But you're here. I mean, that can only mean one thing.",
        "Walker: I still care about you very much, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I feel the same way about you.",
        "Walker: I don't think you understand.",
        "Barbara: What's important is that you know that we can work through this.",
        "Walker: I need you to -- I need you to listen. Come here.",
        "Barbara: All right.",
        "Walker: When we first met, people tried to warn me away from you, but I thought that I could be good for you. That, you know, with a little give and take, things could be fine. They're not fine, Barbara. You're not fine.",
        "Barbara: What are you saying?",
        "Walker: You need help, Barbara. More help than I can give you.",

        "James: You're sure this is what you want, Rosanna?",
        "Paul: This is what everybody wants.",
        "James: I believe the lady's capable of speaking for herself.",
        "Paul: Dad, it's over! All right, this perfect little nuclear family you're trying to set up? It's just not gonna happen. I'm crazy about Rosanna. We're together. We're gonna stay together.",
        "Rosanna: And there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "James: And you're ready to put your faith in Paul? He's my son, so I'm keenly aware of his shortcomings.",
        "Rosanna: We're together.",
        "James: And you can trust him with your life? I mean, Paul does have a questionable track record in taking care of the women he loves. I mean, just ask Rose D'Angelo. Oh. Oh. No, can't. She's dead.",
        "Paul: You lousy son of a --",
        "Rosanna: Wait, don't, don't. Please, come on. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "James: Think, Rosanna. Think. You're a new mother, with a vulnerable child. You ready to hitch your wagon to a faded star? Hmm? Are you?",
        "Rosanna: There is no doubt in my mind or my heart about Paul. Any other questions?",

        "Lily: How's your arm?",
        "Craig: You know, honestly, I've been too worried about Lucy and Sierra to even think about it.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, Rosa's working on a light meal, if anyone's interested. Because, it seems to me, this is gonna be a very long night.",
        "Dusty: I'm in no hurry.",
        "Craig: What she means is, Dusty, it's going to be hours before Lucy and Sierra finish making their arrangements, so --",
        "Dusty: Why don't you say it? Why don't you come out and say it? You want me out of here, right? So you can keep bashing Alan, and you can convince all the ladies here what a loving, doting father you are.",
        "Lily: Would you stop it, please?",
        "Dusty: He knows. He knows what he did.",
        "Lily: How many times do I have to tell you? I was there. I saw things. I heard things at the bell tower.",
        "Dusty: Maybe you were hallucinating, you know? You saw what you wanted to see because the truth is too shocking for you.",
        "Craig: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: How did you get shot, Craig-o?",
        "Lily: Because Alan believed that Craig knew too much.",
        "Dusty: Is that what you saw? Or is that what Craig said you saw?",
        "Craig: Dusty, I think we've all heard enough for one night.",
        "Dusty: Hey, you going to kill me? Are you going to kill me for speaking the truth? I know you're capable.",
        "Lily: He saved my life.",
        "Dusty: He'd kill you, too, if you were in his way.",
        "Lily: Mother, please?",
        "Lucinda: Okay, enough!",
        "Dusty: You spun your plan way out of control!",
        "Lucinda: We will not talk like this. Sierra's in pain. Let's not talk like it.",
        "Lily: You're right. You're absolutely right. Sierra is going through too much right now. She does not need to hear about this tonight.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you.",
        "Sierra: I don't need to hear about what?",
        "Lucinda: Hi, honey. You're back already?",
        "Sierra: Yeah, what'd I miss? I can tell by the way you're all acting, it must be about me. So what were you talking about?",
        "Lucinda: It was nothing important.",
        "Sierra: Well, it certainly sounded important.",
        "Lily: You've been through enough.",
        "Lucinda: Sweetheart, why don't I have somebody bring your stuff up from the guest house, and you can go upstairs and take a hot bath and get some rest?",
        "Sierra: I will rest as soon as I know what's going on behind my back.",
        "Lily: We were worried about --",
        "Lucinda: Dear, it was nothing that you have to worry about.",
        "Sierra: You know, that's it. I want the truth, and nobody's going to leave until I get it.",
        "Lily: I think Sierra's right. No more secrets. I think that you should know what we know.",
        "Craig: Better she hears it from us than from the police.",
        "Sierra: The police?",
        "Lily: It's going to be very hard for you to accept, but Alan engineered Lucy's kidnapping.",

        "Paul: No, my only regret is that I didn't do this sooner.",
        "State trooper: Move away, Stenbeck.",
        "State trooper #2: You're being transferred.",
        "Paul: Guess the bus is here. Let's go celebrate, huh?",

        "Sierra: Alan involved in Lucy's kidnapping? Are you out of your minds?",
        "Lily: I know this is difficult, Sierra.",
        "Sierra: No, it's impossible! If any of you had any idea what kind of man he was, if any of you had taken the time to get to know him -- why? Why would you even suspect him of such a horrible thing?",
        "Lily: We have evidence, Sierra.",
        "Sierra: What? What, a ransom? Everything I had was his. He didn't need the money. There was not a hurtful or hateful bone in his body.",
        "Craig: Sierra, we can talk about this later --",
        "Sierra: No! Alan loved me, and he loved our daughter. Do all of you believe this? Do you all believe that my husband had something to do with this?",
        "Craig: Sierra, none of us wanted to accuse Alan. You would think Alan would be the last person anybody would suspect. But the evidence doesn't lie.",
        "Sierra: What evidence? What evidence?",
        "Lily: Sierra, can you think of any reason why Alan would have a copy of Lucy's trust fund agreement?",
        "Sierra: How could he have a copy of something he didn't know existed?",
        "Lily: I found a copy in his garment bag. I saw it.",
        "Sierra: Well, even if that was true, I can think of several explanations. That doesn't make him a criminal.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, we should talk about this later.",
        "Sierra: No, no. We need to clear this up right this second. You know, Alan had access to everything that was mine. All of my papers, all of my bank accounts, the contents of every safe in every house. What you're proposing is so ridiculous!",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I think Lucy's right. We'll talk about it later.",
        "Sierra: You know, how dare you? How dare you make this incredible accusations about a decent man who is not here to defend himself!",
        "Lily: I saw him, I saw Alan.",
        "Sierra: Well, you are wrong!",
        "Lily: Sierra --",
        "Sierra: You are lying! Why are you lying? God.",
        "Lucinda: I knew this was a mistake.",
        "Sierra: No.",
        "Lucinda: I'm sorry --",
        "Sierra: You are the ones making a mistake. You're cruel and you're spiteful, and you are wrong. All of you.",
        "Lucy: No, let me go.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What are you giving me?",
        "Nurse #2: Something to help you sleep.",
        "Ben: You'll feel better after you get some rest.",
        "Nurse #2: Dr. Schiller wants to keep your wife overnight for observation.",
        "Ben: Whatever she needs.",
        "Nurse #2: Can you come to my desk, fill out some paperwork?",
        "Ben: Sure thing. I will be right back, before you know it. I love you.",
        "Jessica: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: They're out of their minds. They're just out of their minds! I know they're wrong.",
        "Lucy: Mom? Mom, maybe you shouldn't do this now. What? What is it? My trust agreement?",
        "Sierra: There's got to be an explanation to this. I know what it is.",
        "Lucy: Mom, come on. Let it go! Don't do this now. [Sierra muttering to herself] What is this helping? It doesn't matter now.",
        "Sierra: It's a phone number. What did you find? What is it? What do you have?",
        "Lucy: Nothing.",
        "Sierra: Let me see! A key.",
        "Lucy: Daddy and Aaron have one just like it. The key to Metro.",
        "Sierra: Why would Alan have a key to --",
        "Lucy: It's how he got the gun. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Sierra: I don't understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: Hey. I just ran into Elaine after she did the ultrasound. She told me about Jessica. I'm so sorry, man.",
        "Ben: Thanks.",
        "Walker: I can't imagine what you're going through, and I'm not gonna give you that speech about how you can try again because you -- I know you know all about that.",
        "Ben: Yeah.",
        "Walker: But if there's anything at all I can do, you know, just --",
        "Ben: Wait, wait. Maybe there is. Maybe there is something --",
        "Walker: Name it.",
        "Ben: You think you can take a look, as a pathologist, and see if there's anything -- anything that we can do to make sure that this doesn't happen again?",
        "Walker: I can do a full genetic workup.",
        "Ben: I'd appreciate it.",
        "Walker: Consider it done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I hope I'm not disturbing you. I -- I heard what happened.",
        "Jessica: What are you doing here, Doc?",
        "Doc: I came to tell you how sorry I am. What you're going through -- I can't begin to -- is there anything I can do? Jessica, I know how much you wanted that baby. And I know how much you would have loved it.",
        "Jessica: Please, Doc. You really don't know anything about me.",
        "Doc: Hey, any woman who hates me as much as you do has to be capable of -- just an amazing amount of love. Especially for somebody so innocent.",
        "[Jessica crying]",
        "Jessica: The doctors keep saying it was meant to be, these things happen -- they say it's for the best. But how can it be for the best, when it feels like my heart has been ripped out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You want me to go get Grandmother? I'll go get Lily. And --",
        "Sierra: I think I just want to be left alone.",
        "Lily: Are you sure? I could stay --",
        "Sierra: Lucy. Lucy, I'm all right. Really. You have had a long day and you've been through so much. Don't worry about me. Go take a bath. I'll be fine.",
        "Lucy: I love you.",
        "Sierra: I love you. Go on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Thank you so very much. We'll see you then.",
        "Lily: What'd they say?",
        "Lucinda: Due to our peculiar circumstances, the police will let us give our statements tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Oh, good.",
        "Lucy: I guess I should give this to them, too.",
        "Lucinda: What do you got there, honey?",
        "Lucy: Mom found it while she was going through Alan's suitcase.",
        "Dusty: What is it?",

        "Lucy: The key is to Metro. And a phone number.",
        "Lily: I hate to be the one to say this, but that's all the proof that we need.",
        "Dusty: It proves nothing.",
        "Lily: It proves motive -- money. And he had access to the gun that killed Don Creel.",
        "Craig: Poor Sierra. She must be heartbroken.",
        "Lucinda: Dear God! Then it's true?",
        "Lily: I told you everything that happened at the bell tower. Now we have proof.",
        "Dusty: Proof of what?",
        "Lucy: It was enough to convince my mother. Why isn't it good enough for you? You shouldn't try to blame my father. He could never do anything to hurt me. Ever!",
