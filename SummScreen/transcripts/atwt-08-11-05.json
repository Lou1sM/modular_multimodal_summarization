        "Lily: So, what is all this? And what are you doing here?",
        "Holden: Your mother invited me to dinner.",
        "Lily: My mother invited you to dinner?",
        "Holden: Yeah. And then something came up, something at Worldwide. And you know your mom, she doesn't -- she doesn't want good food to go to waste.",
        "Lily: Wait. So she called me? Of course, she called me. Yes. She called me. I should know that by now, because I canceled my plans with Keith, rushed right over because she said she was lonely and she needed me. Like a hole in the head. [Holden laughs] Can you believe this? It's not funny.",
        "Holden: Well, it depends on how you look at it.",
        "Lily: She's manipulating us, you know that.",
        "Holden: Yes, she is.",
        "Lily: And that doesn't make you angry?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Oh, is that my daughter? Cooking?",
        "Meg: Mama, what are you doing here? I thought you went on that overnight retreat with your choir group.",
        "Emma: Reverend Brinkley got the flu. And I certainly am glad I came home in time to see all this!",
        "Meg: I can cook.",
        "Emma: Set for two?",
        "Meg: I invited Dusty over. And don't say it.",
        "Emma: Well, if anything will turn that man's head around, it probably is a good meal.",
        "Meg: I am not trying to turn his head around.",
        "Emma: No?",
        "Meg: No. Because he can already see me. And he likes what he sees.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Is there a decent florist around?",
        "Concierge: The gift shop has a nice selection of cut flowers. Or there's Conrad's in the mall.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I keep thinking about what you said, about how everything's going to turn around for me and that I should trust you and that. But what did you mean?",
        "Paul: Jen, I can't really talk right now.",
        "Jennifer: Because I lost my baby, Paul, and that's never going to change.",
        "Paul: Just meet me at my house in about an hour, and I'll explain everything.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, why are -- why are you being so mysterious?",
        "Paul: I'll see you at home, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Fine. Whatever.",
        "Guard #1: Mr. Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Can I go in now?",
        "Guard #1: Yes, sir.",
        "Paul: Surprised to see me?",
        "Craig: Thrilled. What do you want?",
        "Paul: I thought we should talk.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Paul: Because I know what you did.",
        "Craig: No. You think you know something. There's a difference.",
        "Paul: I saw you force Rosanna off the road that night. Now I know why.",
        "Craig: I was trying to get her to slow down before she killed herself.",
        "Paul: That's not true.",
        "Craig: Whatever. We will never agree.",
        "Paul: This isn't just a matter of interpretation, Craig. You're lying through your teeth.",
        "Craig: Is this Tom's idea? You come in here to try to unnerve me into confessing to some deep dark secret?",
        "Paul: No, I haven't spoken with Tom yet, but I will. I just wanted to see the look on your face. You are cold-blooded, man.",
        "Craig: Ladies! I think Mr. Ryan is leaving.",
        "Paul: Rosanna figured out that you switched the babies. That's why you forced her off the road. When you knew that you'd been found out, you decided to try and kill her. I saw the footprints. In the hospital, they take footprints from babies. Rosanna had one supposedly of your baby, but it didn't match the footprint that I took from your child. And there's only one reason for that. The baby that you took home from the hospital wasn't Gwen Norbeck's baby, it was Jennifer's baby. You adopted your own son. And you would have gotten away with it. But Rosanne found out. And no matter how badly she wanted a child, she wasn't willing to steal one. Because unlike you, she was not prepared to watch Jennifer grieve for no good reason.",
        "Craig: Jennifer will have other children.",
        "Paul: You are a bastard.",
        "Craig: She did things that were unconscionable to me. First, she tried to pass off my baby as someone else's and when that didn't work, she ran away. And then as a last resort, she set it up to look like I pushed her and lied about it under oath. She would've done anything to keep me from what was rightfully mine.",
        "Paul: She was trying to protect her son.",
        "Craig: I am his father.",
        "Paul: Not anymore. When the court hears about this, you'll be lucky to read about your son in the paper.",
        "Craig: You'll never get away with this.",
        "Paul: I already have.",
        "Guard #1: Mr. Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Guard #1: Not a problem. You can go in now.",
        "Paul: Thanks. Surprised to see me?",
        "Craig: I was expecting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I was going to call you. Um, I thought we might go to the office and talk about the spring line. I have some ideas about distribution.",
        "Dusty: You're kidding, right?",
        "Jennifer: No. I thought we might try piggybacking the shipment of spring Ts with a shipment of jeans and sweats, you know, in January -- market them as a layering thing that goes solo for spring break. You know, girl gets on the plane bundled up, and then she hits the beach all ready to go.",
        "Dusty: I like it. It's a good idea.",
        "Jennifer: Well, good. So, you're in. So, yeah, I'll spring for pizza even. Oh, except that you have plans.",
        "Dusty: Nothing I can't postpone. Really.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, excuse me, flowers. And did you -- you shaved a little. Yeah. So she must be an important woman.",
        "Dusty: She's a friend.",
        "Jennifer: Meg?",
        "Dusty: I'll give her a call.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, don't, don't. Don't even. Okay? I'll jot down all of my thoughts.",
        "Dusty: I don't want you going into the office alone.",
        "Jennifer: Look, look, Dusty, I know I said I wasn't ready to come back to work full-time, and I'm still not, but an hour at my desk -- I'm actually looking forward to it. And then an hour or two tomorrow with you, it'll be fine. It'll be fun. It'll keep my mind off things. Dusty, I'm really trying to stay positive, you know. And thinking up ideas for tee shirts for teenage girls is just, you know, it's cheerful, it's productive. It'll do.",
        "Dusty: Let me buy you a drink.",
        "Jennifer: No. Okay?",
        "Dusty: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Meg is waiting.",
        "Dusty: I'll walk you to your car.",
        "Jennifer: Not a chance. I'm going to go upstairs anyway and grab my -- my sketch book. You know, behind the desk I might, I might get some creativity. So, you have a good time, okay? Hmm, very nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You better turn the fire down under that sauce.",
        "Meg: It's fine.",
        "Emma: So, what turned Dusty around?",
        "Meg: Me, Mama, little old me. Hard as it is for you to believe, there are some men that actually think I'm worth their time out there.",
        "Emma: Now don't put words in my mouth. I know what you're worth. I'm just not so sure that Mr. Dusty does.",
        "Meg: Oh, so it's not me, it's my taste in men.",
        "Emma: Come on now, don't pick a fight with me. It's not me you're mad at.",
        "Meg: I'm not mad at anybody.",
        "Emma: You're just afraid this whole thing is not going to make it happen.",
        "Meg: It is going to happen because we like each other.",
        "Emma: We'll see.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Emma: Well, nothing! Nothing, nothing. If you like each other, the man is committed to you.",
        "Meg: I didn't say that.",
        "Emma: Oh, so then you don't like each other and he's not committed to you?",
        "Meg: We're nowhere near that conversation.",
        "Emma: Why not?",
        "Meg: Because we're not, okay?",
        "Emma: So you get to make him a really beautiful meal and he gets to walk all over you. Again.",
        "Meg: He is not walking all over me, Mama. Okay? We are dating. Seeing each other, getting to know each other.",
        "Emma: You already know each other. And he's already hurt you once. I mean, what -- what is there to know?",
        "Meg: That was a long time ago. And you know what? You sound like Holden.",
        "Emma: You should listen to your brother.",
        "Meg: My brother? Oh, yeah. You mean the one that's moping after his soon-to-be ex-wife? You know what? I think he's the one you need to be worried about, not me. I'm moving on. I'm happy.",
        "Emma: Look, I am not suggesting that you get back together with josh. I'm not suggesting that.",
        "Meg: Oh, no, but you want Holden and Lily to get back together.",
        "Emma: That's very different.",
        "Meg: Why? Because they're the perfect couple?",
        "Emma: Nobody's perfect.",
        "Meg: That's right, Mama. That's right. Nobody's perfect. Not Holden, not Lily, not Dusty, not me. I mean, we're all just doing the best with what we've got.",
        "Emma: Well then, if I were you, I would turn the fire down under that sauce because it's going to burn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Reel her in, darling, I know you can do it. Do it.",
        "Lily: She's probably watching us through the window.",
        "Holden: If she hasn't bugged the terrace. You see anything that looks like a camera?",
        "Lily: So you're not upset by any of this?",
        "Holden: What? That your mother, who's fighting cancer, spent the afternoon playing cupid instead of hunched over a computer trying to find some miracle cure? No. She remembered that I like these things.",
        "Lily: Hey, wait. So from -- from your point of view, even though this is pointless, isn't the point?",
        "Holden: I'd say the longer we can keep her entertained and distracted, the better.",
        "Lily: Can I ask you one question? Were you in on this?",
        "Holden: Here's how it went. I was on my way out and she asked me to stay for dinner. Said she didn't want to have dinner alone. So I said, sure, why not? I went home to change, I came back and she was out here on the terrace lighting candles, and then she proceeded to tell me how I needed to fix my life.",
        "Lily: Get back with Lily.",
        "Holden: Exactly.",
        "Lily: That didn't make you angry?",
        "Holden: Well, I wasn't pleased, at first. But I know I'm not going to change her mind. And I'm certainly not going to argue with her. Not now.",
        "Lily: Then what happened?",
        "Holden: She remembered that you like these --",
        "Lily: Holden, please -- can you tell me please?",
        "Holden: I told her that I'd stay for dinner.",
        "Lily: But you knew that I had plans. You knew that she would call me and ruin my evening.",
        "Holden: Lily, you and I have both been worried about your mother for weeks. You keep asking what she needs. Maybe this is what she needs right now.",
        "Lily: To set me up?",
        "Holden: Maybe. And maybe she needs the satisfaction of knowing that she's pulled one over on you. The question is, are you going to give it to her? If she's watching, she'll like that long soulful look that you gave me. She'll think I'm making progress. [Lily laughs] And if you're laughing, that's even better.",
        "Lily: You always knew how to make me laugh. You know me so well. You know my mother, too.",
        "Holden: I've always liked your mother. It just took me a little while to figure out how to handle her.",
        "Lily: So, this is you handling her?",
        "Holden: Whatever works.",
        "Lily: Ah.",
        "Holden: Don't let her catch you looking around.",
        "Lily: See, I don't have a huge problem with any of this because it's just you and I. We know where we stand. Even though we put the legalities on hold.",
        "Holden: First things first. Need to get your mother squared away.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but this is a little dishonest, making her think that the two of us --",
        "Holden: What? We're having dinner together. We have three kids. Come on, we're in this for the long haul.",
        "Lily: Yes, that's true. You and I will always care about each other. Just to know that she's watching us.",
        "Holden: And so happy.",
        "Lily: If it were just you and me, that would be one thing. But Keith made plans.",
        "Holden: So give him a call.",
        "Lily: Tell him what? I'm humoring my mother?",
        "Holden: Tell him that you will hook up with him later.",
        "Lily: No. I don't want to do that to him. Keep him waiting around.",
        "Holden: You're worth waiting for.",
        "Lily: Okay. Then, let's eat.",
        "Holden: Here's to putting one over on your mother.",
        "Lucinda: Bravo, Holden. [Doorbell rings] Oh, now who in God's name?",
        "Keith: Well, hello, Lucinda. It's good to see that you're up and about. Where's your daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier. Okay? I'm just not much of a cook.",
        "Emma: I was hoping you'd save me a little taste.",
        "Meg: I will. And I know what I'm doing with Dusty, okay?",
        "Emma: I hope so. I hope so. What time is he coming?",
        "Meg: Oh, my God, now! And I haven't finished the salad and I'm not even dressed.",
        "Emma: Well, go. Go on, go upstairs, get dressed.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Emma: I'll work on the salad.",
        "Meg: Okay, thank you. Love you. Thank you.",
        "Emma: Oh, Lord, I do hope you know what you're doing, Meggie.",
        "Dusty: Hey, Brenda, it's nice to see you're in the office so late. Can you put me through to Jennifer? Are you sure? She said she was headed over there. You haven't heard from her? All right, thanks. Jennifer, give me a call when you get this, all right? It doesn't matter how late, just want to make sure you're okay. Hey.",
        "Emma: Hey.",
        "Dusty: I didn't hear you.",
        "Emma: Meg's upstairs getting dressed.",
        "Dusty: You wouldn't by any chance have a vase or something?",
        "Emma: Over there. Over there on the side.",
        "Meg: Okay, I forgot the wine. Oh. Okay, don't look, I'm half-dressed.",
        "Dusty: Well, why would I want to look at you when you're half-dressed? These are for you.",
        "Meg: Thank you. They're beautiful.",
        "Dusty: The vase belongs to your mother. It's a very nice one.",
        "Meg: Mama -- uh, can you go out there and get me like a decent bottle of cabernet sauvignon? If you do, I promise, I promise to deadhead all the flowers in your garden for the next week. Two weeks.",
        "Dusty: I'll get it for you.",
        "Meg: You don't mind?",
        "Dusty: No, of course not. I'll be right back.",
        "Meg: Thanks. He bought me flowers. And now he's going to go buy me some wine. You know, I might be wrong, but I think he's interested.",
        "Emma: Oh, he's interested all right. But not in my little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing in my house? Besides ruining my evening.",
        "Keith: Look, I know that you don't like me, but I am really glad to see that you're doing so well.",
        "Lucinda: Duly noted.",
        "Keith: I want to speak to Lily. She forgot her phone so I was going to bring it by here. She said she was coming here.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, and you're the gentleman so you decided you'd drop it off. Well, thank you so much. I'll give it to her. Oh, what? Did I speak too quickly?",
        "Keith: Is she still here?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, she is.",
        "Keith: May I speak with her?",
        "Lucinda: No, she's busy at the moment.",
        "Keith: Well, then, I guess I'll just wait.",
        "Lily: Thank you, sir.",
        "Holden: I remember the first time one of the neighborhood kids called me sir. I think it was at one of the founder's day picnics, or something. Kid look up to me, calls me sir.",
        "Lily: You like that, being called sir?",
        "Holden: Nice to know somebody respects you, even if they're only five years old.",
        "Lily: Everybody respects you.",
        "Holden: No. No, not everybody.",
        "Lily: Everybody that counts.",
        "[Romantic music plays in background]",
        "Holden: Your mother, she is good.",
        "Lily: Mm, yes, she is good. I haven't heard that one in years. You want to dance?",
        "Holden: Your mother, she wants us to dance. And I wouldn't mind. For old time's sake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You were expecting me?",
        "Craig: It was a matter of time. At the crash, she spoke to you. They wouldn't let me near her.",
        "Paul: Because you'd just run her off the road. We should talk about this.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Paul: Because there's a child involved.",
        "Craig: She was beautiful. So full of love, the perfect Mom.",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: You don't know?",
        "Paul: Know what?",
        "Craig: I thought they called you. Isn't that why you're here?",
        "Paul: Who called?",
        "Craig: The doctors, Switzerland.",
        "Paul: No, they didn't call. Why? What happened?",
        "Craig: Rosanna's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Trespassing.",
        "Jen: So, what's this big news? You sounded like you have all the answers. 'Cause I sure could use some good news right now. How are you going to change my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What do you mean, she's gone? What kind of sick game are you playing now, Craig?",
        "Craig: They called me this morning.",
        "Paul: And said what?",
        "Craig: That she had a cerebral episode --",
        "Paul: She had a stroke?",
        "Craig: She had a seizure. So, any hope of recovery is gone.",
        "Paul: You're lying. You paid somebody to make that phone call. You're trying to drum up sympathy. You're -- you're going to change your plea.",
        "Craig: Why don't you talk to them?",
        "Paul: Oh, I will! Because there's got to be something they can do. There's got to be some medical course of action.",
        "Craig: They will make her comfortable. They will monitor her. She's -- in a vegetative state.",
        "Paul: You did this! You took her life and you destroyed it and -- was it worth it, Craig? At the end of the day, did you get what you wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Jennifer? What happened?",
        "Jennifer: Oh -- yeah, I was going to go to the office, and then I -- I couldn't find my keys, so I dumped out my bag and -- and I found this. Dumb.",
        "Dusty: No, that's not dumb.",
        "Jennifer: I thought I threw everything away, you know? Everything, except what my mother has managed to squirrel away in storage. You know my mother, she -- she'll get a grandchild if she has to have it herself. I wonder if he's outgrown this by now. I'm becoming an expert. I watch them. In their strollers, in their mother's arms. There's even this woman in the gift shop, she brings her baby into work with her sometimes. And I watch her when she nurses him behind the counter. He's getting so big.",
        "Dusty: It's gonna take time.",
        "Jennifer: So they say.",
        "Dusty: You know what this means?",
        "Jennifer: No. Not a clue.",
        "Dusty: It means you're a great mother. Remember that meeting when we had that conversation when you weren't sure, considering your role model?",
        "Jennifer: Mommy dreadful?",
        "Dusty: Right. You're not her.",
        "Jennifer: Well, to tell you the truth, you know, she's -- she's actually been pretty great the past couple weeks.",
        "Dusty: Well, when she starts driving you nuts, you'll know you're getting better.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be having dinner with Meg.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Meg had some things to, you know, sort out over there.",
        "Jennifer: You're checking up on me.",
        "Dusty: Why didn't you show up at the office?",
        "Jennifer: Um, I'm sorry. I was going to and I -- I got sidetracked by this stupid sock.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. It happens. It's all right.",
        "Jennifer: No, I'll be there, though, first thing in the morning.",
        "Dusty: I was worried about you. You know, the work can wait.",
        "Jennifer: No, it can't. I appreciate the thought. What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna call meg and tell her she and I can do it another time --",
        "Jennifer: No, no. Not a chance.",
        "Dusty: I'm not leaving you here all alone.",
        "Jennifer: I -- I have to actually go see my brother. And in fact, I should get going. I really should throw this out. But -- ignore me. You'd think after losing the baby, I would lose the hormones, too. No such luck. You know, sometimes I -- I feel like um, he's out there. You know, missing me.",
        "Dusty: Come on, let's go.",
        "Jennifer: Where're we going?",
