        "Will: Mom, it's me. And since you're dodging my calls. If you blew it with Gwen, I just -- I hope you didn't come down on her. Or blame her. Because this isn't on her. [Knock on the door] Call me. Where is she?",
        "Barbara: Hi, Honey --",
        "Will: Mom, did you talk to her?",
        "Barbara: Let's sit down, okay?",
        "Barbara: It will take more one conversation to work this out.",
        "Will: Mom, I don't need to sit with you and talk to you. I want to know where my wife is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Maddie: What are you doing?",
        "Gwen: I had a fight with Will, so I spent the night --",
        "Maddie: What are you doing with Casey?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What do you mean that Gwen's not gonna be around much longer?",
        "Jade: I'm just saying --",
        "Luke: You know, I heard what you said, and seeing how there's a Slasher running around town, it sounds really creepy.",
        "Jade: Come on, I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Luke: Well, then what did you mean? Is Gwen leaving town?",
        "Jade: Maybe -- look, can we drop this?",
        "Luke: And you know this how? You know, somehow I highly doubt that Gwen would sit down with you and have a heart to heart about her future plans.",
        "Jade: I just know, okay. You don't need to be so mean. You were the one who invited me here to ask me a favor.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and you said that it was no problem to keep me up to date on how my mom is doing.",
        "Jade: It isn't. But it's just that when you called me, I thought it was because you wanted to be friends again.",
        "Luke: Jade, being your friend -- maybe being your friend, doesn't mean that I'm blind or an idiot, or that I forget the way you work.",
        "Jade: Why are you always on my case?",
        "Luke: Why are you so interested in what Gwen's doing?",
        "Jade: I'm concerned about her. Okay, she was really nice to me. Maybe I should talk to her.",
        "Luke: Right. Look, Jade, I know this isn't your M.O., but maybe, while I'm gone, you should just -- I don't know -- just butt out and keep your mouth shut. I think you've done enough to help Will and Gwen already.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Luke: Oh, hey --",
        "Holden: I got your message.",
        "Luke: Yeah, thank you for coming. Jade, I need to talk to my dad.",
        "Jade: Is -- Everything okay with Lily?",
        "Holden: Nothing new.",
        "Jade: All right. Well, okay. So, good luck.",
        "Luke: Thank you. I'll call you.",
        "Jade: Bye.",
        "Luke: Thanks for coming. This is okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. It's good to see you. I'm glad you called. The last time we talked, I don't really liked the way we left things.",
        "Luke: Yeah, actually this isn't just a talk. I have to tell you something. Dad, I'm not leaving for Malta in a few days.",
        "Holden: That's great! What made you change your mind?",
        "Luke: No, no, Dad. I'm leaving tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I think I deserve an explanation, don't you? Hmm? You try to drug me, to take a blood sample without asking my permission and you have nothing to say?",
        "Lucy: I --",
        "Damian: I? I? Yes? I don't think so, Doctor? You're not going anywhere until you tell me what you were trying to do. Some experimental treatment, a miracle cure?",
        "Lucy: There's nothing to cure. You're lying. What kind of person are you, letting your son think you're dying just to take him out of the country? It's disgusting!",
        "Damian: It's necessary. And I'm afraid, it's also very necessary that I make sure that -- well, why you don't share your diagnosis with anyone. I mean, anyone at all, dear Lucy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, where's Gwen?",
        "Barbara: I found her at Crash. With Casey.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Barbara: So, why don't you go over there and make a big scene in front of the two of them? Don't think, don't calm down, just act. Oh, no. You already did that. That's how you ended up in the mess in the first place.",
        "Will: What did she say?",
        "Barbara: It doesn't matter.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Barbara: It doesn't matter because she needs to vent, she needs to cry and scream and yell. So, it doesn't matter what she says right now. What matters is what she decides to do when she's thought this all through.",
        "Will: Could you be any more detached right now? We're talking about my marriage.",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Will. The upside of having parents like yours is that we understand the drill of break-ups. I'm not detached, I'm practical.",
        "Will: Which is why you wanted to go and talk to her instead of me?",
        "Barbara: Yes. So, you have time to calm down and think and not make things any worse because you're not exactly rock solid right now.",
        "Will: But Gwen --",
        "Barbara: Gwen will be fine. She's just needs to feel her feeling. And that gives us time to concentrate on how to put this marriage back together.",
        "Will: What? Do we need some kind of campaign strategy?",
        "Barbara: No, Darling. It's called damage control. Sit down. It might make you feel better to get on your hand and knees and beg forgiveness, but it won't bring your wife back.",
        "Will: Okay, what Will?",
        "Barbara: When I talked to Gwen, I planted a seed, a little germ of an idea that might make it easier for her to forgive you.",
        "Will: And what was that?",
        "Barbara: The truth. That Jade had an agenda from the beginning and she took an advantage of you during a weak moment.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Barbara: If Gwen blames Jade for all of this, it will make it easier for her to forgive you.",
        "Will: Mom, I can't believe you!",
        "Barbara: Oh, Will, come on!",
        "Will: No, I -- I screwed up! And I never should have listened to you --",
        "Barbara: You can't afford to be self-righteous right now.",
        "Will: I can't afford to blame Jade, Mom. This is my fault, this is all my fault.",
        "Barbara: Do you want to end up in divorce court?",
        "Will: No! But, I don't want to play Gwen, or manipulate her. Mom, I have to believe she loves me and will forgive me. And she's not gonna do either of those things if I play her the way you would. You should go.",
        "Barbara: You're making a big mistake. Another big mistake.",
        "Will: Mom --",
        "Barbara: Let me stay and help you, please, Will.",
        "Will: When Gwen comes home, we're gonna need to be alone. So that I can do whatever it takes to get her back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You -- you're close to Maddie. You're the one who can reach her.",
        "Louis: Your sarcasm doesn't make it less true.",
        "Eve: Louis, I don't think that --",
        "Louis: You certainly haven't had a positive influence over her.",
        "Henry: And you have?",
        "Louis: Maddie knows she can trust me, that I'm reliable. When I talk to her, she'll listen.",
        "Henry: So, you're gonna fix whatever's wrong with Maddie, just by having a little chat with her? Is that it?",
        "Eve: Louis, no. It's not a good idea.",
        "Louis: Excuse me?",
        "Eve: You -- you would just be putting more pressure on her and she is under so much already.",
        "Louis: Then maybe we should stand by and do nothing. Just sit back and relax as she self-destructs.",
        "Henry: Wow, you are just a smug son of a --",
        "Louis: At least get her some professional help.",
        "Henry: We've tried that.",
        "Louis: What happened?",
        "Eve: She won't -- she doesn't want to.",
        "Louis: Oh well, then if she doesn't want to. Wouldn't want to inconvenience her. Do you two ever look at yourselves?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, it's good to be wonderful having all the answers.",
        "Louis: You're just alike. When it comes to Maddie, you both just stand there, smiling indulgently as she goes off the deep end.",
        "Eve: Don't say that --",
        "Louis: Would you wake up? She's not just some endearing little kook. That's just an act that covers something very dark, very disturbing --",
        "Henry: This is a family matter, Louis. This is a family matter, okay? And Eve and I will handle it. Your opinions are not necessary.",
        "Louis: I am family. In fact, I may be the only one in this family who cares enough about Maddie to be honest. Who can face the truth?",
        "Henry: What truth is that?",
        "Louis: This isn't about pressure. This isn't about what's happening here, now. This is about her whole life. The fact is Maddie has never been normal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I saw you.",
        "Gwen: Saw me? With Casey? How long have you been here?",
        "Maddie: You were hugging him. And you're moving in with him. I heard you, I was standing right over there, and I heard you.",
        "Gwen: You were spying on us?",
        "Maddie: The two of you, making plans like that --",
        "Gwen: Why were you spying on us? Why wouldn't you just say something?",
        "Maddie: I'm the one that is in trouble here, Gwen! And just because Will cheated on you, means that you get Casey!",
        "Gwen: You want to get a grip, Maddie? You want to wrap your head around something? You don't spy on people and you don't listen to their private conversations and jump to conclusion and you're sure as hell don't treat me like I did something wrong!",
        "Maddie: You did do something wrong, you're using him! You're using Casey!",
        "Gwen: What? I mean, at the risk of making it sound like it's any of your business, there's nothing going on between me and Casey except friendship.",
        "Maddie: You're moving in with him.",
        "Gwen: I need a place to stay right now.",
        "Maddie: Does he know that? Does he know or does he think it's more than that?",
        "Gwen: And why do you care? You pushed him away with two hands when he tried to help you.",
        "Maddie: He told you that?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. He was hurt. He had a right.",
        "Maddie: He shouldn't have told you that. That was personal. That's between him and me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, so was the conversation that you just listened in on.",
        "Maddie: You know what? Do not turn this around on me, because I know -- I know that this is not right --",
        "Gwen: No, you want to know what's right -- what's not right? Is me trying to talk to you right now. I've got plenty of stuff going on in my life without dealing with your psycho head games.",
        "Maddie: You pulled me out of the water -- so you know what? I'm gonna repay the favor. Stay away from Casey, for your own sake. Look at what happened to Lia.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me?",
        "Maddie: She got close to Casey, too. And now she's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You don't even bother to deny it.",
        "Damian: I don't have to.",
        "Lucy: You're taking Luke away from his mother, who's sick and his father who needs him --",
        "Damian: I am his father.",
        "Lucy: No, Holden is. And Luke needs him. A parent who put his son's needs above his own. That's what a real father does.",
        "Damian: By telling of a problem that you have is that you judge without having all the facts.",
        "Lucy: The fact is Lily could die. What's going to happen to Luke if that happens when he's with you?",
        "Damian: I'll comfort him.",
        "Lucy: Right, yeah, 'cause you'll still be around, won't you? When do you think Luke's gonna figure out? When you're 65?",
        "Damian: I'm not debating my feelings for my son with you. I have always and will always do what's best for him, and I don't give a damn whether you agree or not.",
        "Lucy: Why are you doing this?",
        "Damian: Because it is best.",
        "Lucy: Best, best for whom -- how is this good for Luke? This is about you, isn't it? There is something you need from Luke.",
        "Damian: Not really fast-acting, are they? Your drugs.",
        "Lucy: Drugs?",
        "Damian: The tea.",
        "Lucy: You switched the teas.",
        "Damian: Well, next time, up the dosage so we can skip all the small talk. Of course, there won't be a next time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We have to leave earlier than we thought. Dad, I am so sorry to have to spring on you like this.",
        "Holden: So if Damian, with no warning or explanation moves up the timetable and you just hop to?",
        "Luke: Dad, I'm leaving. We could have another fight or we can talk.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Luke: But not about whether I'm going or not. I have thought it though, and I made my decision. I have to go with him. [Holden laughs] What's so funny?",
        "Holden: Just trying to enjoy the ironies of parenting.",
        "Luke: Or are you trying to cover for how mad you are at me?",
        "Holden: No, it's not that. It's not that at all. You came to me your mom and me and said this is who I am and this is how I'm going to handle it. And your mom, she gave you every opportunity to try and go into denial mode and pretend that everything was like it always was. But you didn't do that. You said this is my call and this is how it's going to be. And that's what you're doing again. You are saying this is my call and that's how it's going to be and I'm glad you're standing up for yourself. And I respect that, but I have to tell you, this time you're making a mistake. I guess that I should probably just say good-bye. You have my number. You have credit cards, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Holden: When you get there, promise me that you'll call. All right?",
        "Luke: Fine. Look, Dad --",
        "Holden: Just call me when you get there, okay?",
        "Luke: Take care of yourself. And take care of Mom, and I -- I got to go.",
        "Holden: I need to talk to you. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I know she's here. Where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey, gosh, this is fun. It's not every day, you get some fatuous know it all telling you your sister is nut job.",
        "Louis: Have another martini, Henry? Your answer to everything.",
        "Eve: Please, stop, both of you.",
        "Henry: You know, you come in here and you make these raw generalizations about Maddie and you don't know anything about her.",
        "Louis: And you do? How? Because you weren't there, were you?",
        "Eve: Louis --",
        "Louis: You were too unique, too extraordinary to stick with your family. You took off and never looked back --",
        "Henry: I did not take off! I did not take off. And there was nothing wrong with Maddie!",
        "Louis: You don't want there to be anything wrong with Maddie. You can have an oddball little sister, who can quote old movies, that's fun. But when it comes to real problems, real life cramps your style. Your lifestyle.",
        "Henry: Fine, Louis, fine, fine. You want me to say that I'm not the best brother in the world? Fine, fine. But what Maddie needs right now are people who believe in her.",
        "Louis: I was like a father to her. I still am. That means I don't hide my head in the sand. I ask the tough questions and am prepared to face the answers.",
        "Henry: You know what? I figured it out. I think he wants something to be wrong with Maddie. I think you get a kick out of saying she's not normal.",
        "Louis: What more does she have to do to prove it to you? What more do you want to have happen?",
        "Henry: She did not do those things! She did not those things, Louis.",
        "Eve: Stop it! For God's sake, stop it. People are staring. I can't take this -- I can't take this anymore.",
        "Louis: I'm sorry. I feel very strongly about this, but I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: Look, you know Louis loves Maddie and he wants what's right for her.",
        "Henry: All right, I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: Then what we should all do, is stop fighting. And make sure that Maddie doesn't do anything else to hurt herself -- or anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Oh, great. Just who I wanted to see. You know, a piece of advice, you might want to go find someplace to hide, because there is about two, maybe 300 people who want to beat the crap out of you.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Jade: What planet do you live on, Maddie? Slicing and dicing wasn't enough for you, you had to go and ruin Gwen and Will's marriage? You're one of those people who don't like to see other people happy. You just go around ruining things, just because you can.",
        "Maddie: You're right. Everything is ruined now.",
        "Jade: Thanks to you.",
        "Maddie: No! Thanks to you! You! I am not the one to be punished here, you do! You need to be punished!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, it's me. I'm on my way to Crash to see if you're there. Gwen, when you get this, call me. 'Cause I talked to my mom and -- well, we'll talk about it later, but just call please. Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: I left you like 100 messages.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: But this is better. It's good that you're here. Because we can just talk face to face. Or you could just talk and I can listen --",
        "Gwen: It's been a really horrible day.",
        "Will: Well, there's just one thing that I want to say up front. All right, I talked to my mom and she said that she should talk to you, instead of me and I knew that that was wrong. Because what she said to you -- that is not what I think.",
        "Gwen: I didn't come here to talk. I -- came to pack.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I think that's what I have to do. I need to -- I need to pack.",
        "Will: So, you're moving out?",
        "Gwen: Uh, yeah.",
        "Will: Okay, well, just for now. Yeah, I guess that's good. You know, to calm down. I understand, you must be really upset.",
        "Gwen: You know, maybe you want to give me a few minutes alone. I think that this would probably be easier alone.",
        "Will: All right, I just want to finish what I was saying before. Because my mom said I should blame Jade and I can't. I won't. Because this is entirely my fault.",
        "Gwen: Will, please --",
        "Will: This is all on me. And I screwed up because I -- I screwed up the best things that ever happened to me in my life. I hurt the best person that I've ever known.",
        "Gwen: Maybe I should do this at another time.",
        "Will: And I swear to God that this isn't an excuse, okay? But the only reason that I went with Jade --",
        "Gwen: Look, please, I don't want to hear this!",
        "Will: Because I was scared that I lost you. It was losing you. And I did everything wrong and I shouldn't have lied but I was so scared that I was gonna lose you. And I can't lose you.",
        "Gwen: I don't want to lose you, either.",
        "Will: Thank God.",
        "Gwen: But I think it's already happened. I'm going, Will. I can't stay here right now, I just can't, okay?",
        "Will: Do you even have a place to stay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, she's staying with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: I just thought this was it, you know? Will and me in our place. Everything was gonna work out.",
        "Luke: Damian, you said that Lucy was at the hospital, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I need to be punished?",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Jade: You know what, Maddie? You're kind of really ticking me off now.",
        "Maddie: Because of you, I --",
        "Jade: Because of me, what?",
        "Maddie: Gwen and Casey are now together. A couple.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Maddie: You heard me.",
        "Jade: And you know this how?",
        "Maddie: I saw them hugging. And then I heard Gwen saying to Casey that she was going to get her stuff, so she could move in with him.",
        "Jade: Well, that doesn't mean --",
        "Maddie: It's not gonna happen! Okay? It's not right.",
        "Jade: Whoa, Mayor of Crazy Town.",
        "Maddie: Don't talk to me like that, okay, Jade? You're not funny. You're not cool. This is all because of you, so just shut up and you listen to me!",
        "Jade: See, you listen to me. Okay, I don't take orders from homicidal smurfs. I am not scared of you. So, don't start trouble with me or Gwen, because you can't handle the consequences.",
        "Voice: Don't make trouble, Maddie. It might be more than you can handle. Don't make trouble Maddie, maybe more than you can handle.",
        "Jade: What's up with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Gwen, are you ready to go?",
        "Will: So, you're the man with the van, huh?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Will: What happened to Maddie? I thought you were her go-to guy. Branching out?",
        "Casey: Hey, let's just be cool, all right. Make it easier for Gwen.",
        "Will: Gwen, you mean, my wife, Gwen.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I didn't forget that. You did.",
        "Will: Right, and whenever there is a damsel in distress, Casey Hughes can't be far behind.",
        "Gwen: Will, its okay.",
        "Will: No, it's better than okay. It's great. Because the dude even picks up and delivers.",
        "Casey: You know, if you could not be a jerk right now, that'd be great.",
        "Will: Yeah, you know what else would be great? If you can the advice because I don't need to learn anything from you about my wife.",
        "Gwen: Look, I need a friend right now. Casey is a friend.",
        "Will: No! Casey is not a friend, okay? Because a friend stands up for you and covers for you and protects you. And what a friend doesn't do is lie and run as fast as he can in the other direction and leaves you high and dry when he was the one who got you in trouble in the first place.",

        "Will: Because I get it. You're forgiven, Casey. But you can't forgive me. And that's fine. Really, it's fine. Because my eyes are open now. And I see how you guys really are. Finally.",
