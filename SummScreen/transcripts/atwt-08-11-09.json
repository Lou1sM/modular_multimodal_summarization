        "Riley: Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, my hearing ended early.",
        "Riley: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Tom: If the judge rules in favor of my client, it's great. Feeling any better?",
        "Riley: Much. Fever's gone. No more chills. I almost have all my energy back. Those antibiotics really worked.",
        "Tom: Well, that's great. So, now you can pack up and go?",
        "Margo: Hi. How are you and the little kid doing?",
        "Katie: We're doing really good. I went to the doctor the other day, and I got taken off bed rest, which is great. Thank God. I still have to take it easy, but it's so good to see you.",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah. Me and my Bavarian creams.",
        "Katie: Good thing about having a cop in the family, they're always prepared for emergencies.",
        "Margo: Hey, you know what? Take it easy out there. There's this really bad flu going around. In fact, Riley ended up in the hospital.",
        "Katie: Is he okay?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. He's fine. He had a really high fever. So, you don't want to risk that, okay?",
        "Katie: No, definitely. Thank you so much. Listen, while I have you here, I need to ask you something. Does the name Jay Stanhope mean anything to you?",
        "Margo: Why does that sound familiar?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Henry has this crazy idea about his mom and this boyfriend of hers that goes by that name. We were looking him up all day on the computer, and we can't find anything about him, not even the run-of-the- mill stuff.",
        "Margo: Can I go on your laptop? Maybe just pull up the federal database and see if anything comes up.",
        "Katie: Ooh. You know, that password would come in really handy for a reporter.",
        "Margo: Don't push it, Sis. I'm packing.",
        "Katie: I'm just saying.",
        "Margo: Whoa! No wonder it sounds familiar. Jay Stanhope was an alias used by James Stenbeck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You're telling me that my father is James Stenbeck and that you are coming to this mental institution to visit him? Okay. I hope you brought your own toothbrush, Mom, because when the shrinks hear this story, they're gonna lock you up in a rubber room. I swear.",
        "Audrey: No, no, no, no. I really am telling you the truth.",
        "Henry: What? Since when? You have always had a rich fantasy life, but this is too much, even for you.",
        "Audrey: Henry, I am not lying this time.",
        "Henry: How can you even say -- you're telling me that my father is actually this billionaire international criminal, and you just never got around to telling me about it?",
        "Audrey: Yeah. Yes! Because I was sworn to secrecy.",
        "Henry: Okay, all right. Unless this mental home is a funeral home, James isn't in there, because the man is dead.",
        "Audrey: Okay, okay. He's not dead. If he was dead, how could he send me this note? Look right here. It says this place. Hargrave Clinic. Look.",
        "Henry: It's not even signed.",
        "Audrey: Of course it's not. He faked his own death. Do you know what somebody could do if they got a hold of this?",
        "Henry: But, Mom, you're being scammed! Come on, come on! Con artist, un-con thyself!",
        "Audrey: I am not being scammed. James Stenbeck is alive, and he is your father!",
        "Henry: How would you even know him?",
        "Audrey: I knew him a lot. I mean I knew him on a lot of occasions, and on one of those particular occasions, I got pregnant with you.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God, Mom. Don't put that image in my head. Please don't. It's already scary enough in there. Oh, my God.",
        "Audrey: Okay, look. I know it's really hard to take all of this, but, Henry, you are a grown-up, and you need to know now where you came from.",
        "Henry: Don't play the concerned mother now, okay? That window is closed.",
        "Audrey: Just shut your mouth. Just please listen to me. Please. I did a lot of bad things when I was younger, and one of them was being unfaithful to the man you thought you had as a father. Well, guess what? You are a grown-up now, so you need to hear this!",
        "Henry: You know what, Mom? No! There is still such a thing as too much information.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Let me out of here, Emily!",
        "Emily: I am not letting you out of this car unless you promise to behave.",
        "Barbara: Do you really want to break my arm?",
        "Emily: You really want me to answer that?",
        "Barbara: This is not your fight, Emily.",
        "Emily: Fine. Okay, wait. You may be out of the car, but there's no way in hell you're walking in to this place.",
        "Barbara: Paul!",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Barbara: Don't you ever do that to me again, all right?",
        "Emily: It wasn't my idea.",
        "Barbara: Where is Paul?",
        "Emily: Inside!",
        "Barbara: Checking in?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I don't think so. He says the place is empty.",
        "Barbara: How can the place be abandoned? Don't you understand, my son is sick! He needs help! And if you cared as much about his health as you do his money, you would help me get him some help!",
        "Emily: That's funny. I really don't think he's crazy.",
        "Barbara: Well, let him be evaluated. If he's as sane as he thinks he is, they'll let him go home. But you know what? Deep down in my heart, I know that he needs help, and I would think that maybe you would be a little bit more concerned about your own welfare.",
        "Emily: I'm not afraid of you, lady.",
        "Barbara: Be afraid of Paul. He turned on me today. He could turn on you tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Dad.",
        "James: It's me, son.",
        "Paul: I saw you fall from the lighthouse.",
        "James: I bounced.",
        "Paul: What's with the wheels?",
        "James: It's just a minor inconvenience.",
        "Paul: I see. So, how did you engineer the miracle resurrection this time?",
        "James: Just wasn't my time.",
        "Paul: It's never your time, is it? You're like a cat. How many more lives you got? You want to let me know so that I can plan accordingly?",
        "James: My ever-loving son.",
        "Paul: You had a microchip embedded in my brain. Not very fatherly behavior on your part.",
        "James: It worked for a little while.",
        "Paul: Really? How? You trying to control me?",
        "James: You know how it is with this cutting-edge technology. The product rarely performs as advertised. When it comes to control, real being in command, there's nothing like the hands-on approach.",
        "Paul: Oh. You think you're in control? You're not in control of anything, old man. Look at you. You can't even walk.",
        "James: I wanted you here, and here you are.",
        "Paul: Don't tell me mother's in on this.",
        "James: No, no. That would be a miracle. She thinks she's brought you to an exclusive, very upscale clinic. And it was. But, you see, I bought it and kept on the staff that I could trust and just dismissed the rest.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "James: It's obvious I haven't recovered from my last encounter with the grim reaper. I need help with a lot of things. I mean, I don't know how much longer I have to live. But I wanted to see you, and I wanted to make amends, to say good-bye.",
        "Paul: I've heard that one before.",
        "James: This time it's true, Paul.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, then, good-bye.",
        "James: You don't want to leave just yet, Paul.",
        "Paul: Really? Why not?",
        "James: I know I hurt you when I left Dustin my money.",
        "Paul: You think?",
        "James: Yes. Just hear me out, then you can walk away and never see me again, okay, if that's what you want. Yes, I left Dustin the fortune, but it wasn't everything. There's a substantial inheritance in store for you if we can just find some way to reconcile. Wait, wait. Where are you going? We're not done here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Look, I had a DNA test done at the hospital, and it came back 99.9% positive that you are James Stenbeck's son.",
        "Henry: I am 110% positive that you are out of your mind!",
        "Audrey: Well, you can't really argue with science, now, can you?",
        "Henry: Fine, Mom. Fine. Okay. You know what? Once you get that forensics degree, we can talk about it. Until then, I'm out of here.",
        "Audrey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Listen to me! Okay, fine. Forget the science. Just forget it. Take a look at these. Take a look.",
        "Henry: Photoshop.",
        "Audrey: Come on. You know I can barely turn on the computer.",
        "Henry: Okay, fine. One of your dead boyfriends put your head on some of these bodies and his head on these other ones. I don't know! I don't care! These aren't real!",
        "Audrey: Look, your father and I were fighting a lot back then.",
        "Henry: Which one?",
        "Audrey: My husband. We got married really young, so we fought about money, and we fought about the way I dressed and my hair, and he even complained about the way I cooked. So, one day I got so sick of the complaining, I just took off.",
        "Henry: You just left him?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, and I'm really sorry to say that I was glad. I had fun, and I found a way to get myself back instead of just believing I was somebody's lousy wife.",
        "Henry: Okay. I'm not saying I believe any of this, all right? Where'd you go?",
        "Audrey: New Orleans.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Audrey: Yeah. Great town, huh? I met James in one of those private gambling clubs. You know the ones they used to have down there?",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah. They still have them.",
        "Audrey: Well, there he was, you know, playing poker, high stakes, very charismatic, and sparks just sort of flew.",
        "Henry: You know what? This is so much information and so little truth.",
        "Audrey: It is true, and there is a whole lot more to the story.",
        "Henry: I don't care, Mom. I don't want to hear it.",
        "Audrey: Henry! Henry, wait! I know it's hard, but you need to know this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: She claims that she knew this Jay Stanhope?",
        "Katie: Yeah, but it's not like she could be dating James Stenbeck.",
        "Margo: Unless she's a necrophiliac.",
        "Katie: But there's still something weird about all of this.",
        "Margo: Weirder than Henry's mom doing a dead man?",
        "Katie: Audrey introduced Henry to this Jay Stanhope guy, but then Henry found out that wasn't his real name. How weird is that, two men using the same alias?",
        "Margo: Well, did you find out why he was pretending to be someone else?",
        "Katie: No, but Henry's been flipped out ever since his mom came to Oakdale. He's, like, a nervous wreck.",
        "Margo: More so than usual?",
        "Katie: Way more. He thinks his mom is a serial killer like his sister.",
        "Margo: All right, all right. Well, then, this woman is dangerous.",
        "Katie: No, no! She's not! Audrey's a sweetheart! I mean, she's a little odd, but that's probably where Henry gets it from. She's a really nice person.",
        "Margo: Are you sure?",
        "Katie: I'm positive. Just can't convince Henry of that.",
        "Margo: Okay. Well, you want me to check this out, unofficially?",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know. The case of the dueling aliases? No, no. It's fine. You know what? Henry's probably just being dramatic.",
        "Margo: You be careful, 'cause nothing connected to James Stenbeck ever turns out well. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Thank God you are back, because I don't have the patience to deal with her.",
        "Barbara: I can't believe you had your little hussy here hit your mother, your own mother!",
        "Paul: How's your head?",
        "Barbara: I'll survive. How's yours?",
        "Emily: Oh, please. Can we leave now?",
        "Barbara: Would you please ignore her, and let's go back inside and talk to the doctors, all right? You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, Paul.",
        "Emily: Oh, really? That's what she always says, and then she sails it down the river.",
        "Barbara: Please. The sooner you get in there and get some help, the sooner you can get back to your old life.",
        "Paul: Who says I want to get back to my old life?",
        "Barbara: Honey, Eliza's growing up. She's your only child. You don't want to miss out now. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Paul: Do you honestly think that this is a real hospital?",
        "Barbara: Of course I do.",
        "Paul: Where'd you get that idea?",
        "Barbara: From the specialist I talked to in New York.",
        "Paul: Someone that you know personally?",
        "Barbara: No, no. He was a recommendation, but he came with wonderful credentials, and he's board certified, and he said why bring you to New York when I can bring you here, 'cause it's so much closer to home.",
        "Emily: Hang on. Are you honestly thinking of checking yourself in to this place?",
        "Paul: I'm just trying to fill in all of the gaps.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I did my research. I would not send you to anyone who wasn't qualified. What's the matter here?",
        "Paul: Take her home.",
        "Emily: What? Me? By myself?",
        "Paul: Yeah, there's something I got to do inside.",
        "Emily: Back in an empty clinic?",
        "Barbara: What's going on?",
        "Paul: I'll explain later.",
        "Barbara: What's happening here?",
        "Paul: Emily, take her home now. Please, just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: You're throwing me out?",
        "Tom: Why are you acting so surprised? We already talked about this.",
        "Riley: Yes, I know. It's just that I thought after you talked to Margo, that maybe --",
        "Tom: Yeah. Well, I didn't talk to Margo.",
        "Riley: Maybe you should.",
        "Tom: Are you telling me how to deal with my wife?",
        "Riley: No, no. I'm sorry. I'll leave. But can I say good-bye?",
        "Tom: Yeah, you should probably do that in a letter. I mean, she deserves your thanks. She's done a lot for you.",
        "Riley: Sure. I really appreciate everything you've done for me, and Casey, too.",
        "Tom: Save your gratitude.",
        "Riley: Look, I know you think this is the best thing for her and that having me here's preventing you -- preventing her from moving on from Adam's death, but with all due respect, I really think you might be wrong about this.",
        "Tom: So now you know what's best for my wife?",
        "Riley: No, no, no. I didn't say that.",
        "Tom: That's what it sounded like to me.",
        "Riley: Fine. I'll go pack my things and go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I knew you'd be back. You don't have the guts to walk away from the promise of a large inheritance, do you, Paul?",
        "Paul: You owe me, and I plan to collect.",
        "James: No, I don't. Bruno!",
        "Paul: Come on. If you're calling for the big palooka you got stationed down at the end of the hallway, he's temporarily out of commission.",
        "James: What did you do?",
        "Paul: The guy just can't handle his Thorazine. Here's a little tip for the next time you hire a bodyguard. Smarter's better than stronger. He didn't even hear me before I got the needle in him. But don't worry, I saved plenty more for the road.",
        "James: Where are you taking me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Hey, you busy?",
        "Margo: No, not too busy for you. What's up?",
        "Riley: Tom kicked me out. He didn't even want me to stick around to say good- bye. He thinks my being there is unhealthy for you.",
        "Margo: I know, because he thinks I'm not grieving Adam.",
        "Riley: We can fix this. If you're willing to tell him who I am, then --",
        "Margo: No, no. I can't do that.",
        "Riley: I know, but it's putting a strain on your marriage, and the last thing that I want is to come between you and Dad.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. We can work it out.",
        "Riley: Not anymore. It's getting worse. I don't want to be responsible for that.",
        "Margo: You're not.",
        "Riley: You'll see. Things will be better now that I'm gone.",
        "Margo: No! You're not going anywhere. You can't go anywhere. If you leave town, I don't know what I'm gonna do. So, no.",
        "Riley: I'm not really leaving town. I'm sticking around here.",
        "Margo: You just said that you were gonna --",
        "Riley: No, no. Tom can kick me out of the house, but he can't kick me out of Oakdale. I'm staying. I'm gonna get a job, find a place to live, try to remember what it's like being normal.",
        "Margo: Okay, okay. Can I give you some money, at least?",
        "Riley: No. Thank you, but I can do this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What about my son?",
        "Emily: What about him?",
        "Barbara: I don't believe for a second that you give a damn about him, but for some reason, if you still have a little bit of residual affection from your younger days --",
        "Emily: Oh, for God's sakes! Spit it out, Barbara!",
        "Barbara: He needs hospitalization, and for some reason, right now he respects you. So I'm asking you to please help me help him before he completely self- destructs.",
        "Emily: What did you have in mind?",
        "Barbara: We need to talk to the doctors at the clinic, because memory or no memory, Paul can still talk his way right out of a corner. We need to let them know what they're dealing with.",
        "Emily: Yeah. You really thought we were taking him to a real clinic, didn't you?",
        "Barbara: I most certainly did, which is why I filled out these forms that took hours. Do you see these?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Or are these as invisible as the staff at the hospital?",
        "Emily: I saw them. Seriously, these could be part of some scheme, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Why would I bother?",
        "Emily: I don't know, but then again, I don't understand half the things you do.",
        "Barbara: I do what I do because I care more about my family than I do myself. You should try it sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sorry about the stench. I had a minor accident with a major vintage.",
        "James: The Lafitte?",
        "Paul: You have a terrific nose.",
        "James: You're my son. You don't waste time on the insignificant.",
        "Paul: So, what's it like to be back in your old lair? Does this bring back any memories?",
        "James: Why are you doing this?",
        "Paul: Just wanted to see what it felt like to be in control.",
        "James: You think you're in control now?",
        "Paul: Well, you look pretty helpless.",
        "James: My body may not be working, but my mind is functioning very well.",
        "Paul: Fat lot of good that'll do you.",
        "James: I've been watching you, Paul. You've been suffering from amnesia, throwing your fortune away, and there's not much left. You need what I can give you.",
        "Paul: Right, the mythic inheritance.",
        "James: Oh, no. It's not mythic. It's very real. I have it. You want it. And as long as that is true, you're more of a prisoner than I am.",
        "Paul: Maybe so. But look, I can move my legs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: James Stenbeck, he still has a lot of money, and you are entitled to a piece of that.",
        "Henry: The man is dead, Mom. That ship has sunk.",
        "Audrey: No, no. He's not dead. James is still alive, and if he wants to redeem himself by giving the son that he never knew he had just a little taste of that family fortune, then we ought to let him do it.",
        "Henry: Let me get this straight. Are you telling me I'd be doing the guy a favor by taking his money?",
        "Audrey: Yes. It would be a very kind thing to do.",
        "Henry: You are not -- you're not listening to me, okay? He's not alive, and he's definitely not my father, and that's a great thing, because Stenbeck was a monster.",
        "Audrey: You don't really know him.",
        "Henry: He kidnapped me and held me prisoner. He would have killed me and Vienna if I didn't know my way around a Molotov cocktail.",
        "Audrey: Henry, why can't you just let bygones be bye-bye, gone?",
        "Henry: Go away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey. How'd you get home before me?",
        "Paul: Did you get my mother back to the Lakeview?",
        "Emily: Yes, I did, and before you ask, she knew her name, the date, and the president, but she's determined to get you into a facility.",
        "Paul: Good luck with that.",
        "Emily: I feel sorry for her. I mean I almost feel sorry for her. She really thought that clinic was legit.",
        "Paul: Oh, it was at one time.",
        "Emily: Well, that sounds, I don't know, cryptic. Spill. What did you find out?",
        "Paul: Nothing. I'll take care of it.",
        "Emily: What do you mean you'll take care of it? We're a team. We're supposed to do this together.",
        "Paul: I don't work well with others.",
        "Emily: I think you work very well with others.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You know what? I think it might be a good idea if you move out, and I think you should take your son with you.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. Did we have a fight I'm not aware of?",
        "Paul: It's just not working out for me anymore.",
        "Emily: I think you need to have your short-term memory checked. Seriously, you invited us here, me and Hunter, to use this place as a launching pad for the newspaper. How could you not remember that?",
        "Paul: I remember. I just changed my mind.",
        "Emily: Okay. What -- what happened to new, improved Paul, Mr. Integrity?",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "James: It's me, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I got over it.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. Your amnesia's gone? When did this happen? Did they do something to you in the clinic?",
        "Paul: Yes and no. There were no doctors there. There were no patients. But something kind of clicked, and it all came back.",
        "Emily: That's fantastic. No! This experience, it's fantastic. You got to experience your life from a whole other perspective, Paul. No memory, no baggage, nothing to be afraid of, nothing holding you back, and now here you are, back to normal, and you know now what you don't want.",
        "Paul: All because of temporary insanity.",
        "Emily: No. You were more sane than I have ever seen. You actually made me like you again.",
        "Paul: That might change in a minute.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Paul: Well, when I was unburdened by memory, I did some things that I'm sure you now know that I can't follow through with. You know what I'm talking about.",
        "Emily: What? What are you saying? Now that you remember everything, you're pushing me away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I told you, letting my mom back into my life would be like playing catch with an unexploded hand grenade.",
        "Katie: I think I would have remembered that.",
        "Henry: She is a horror show, Katie. She is a lying, stealing, more than a little crazy, unrelenting, terrible, movie-screen-sized spook-a-lot!",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Henry: I followed her.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know that. Fast-forward. Where did she go?",
        "Henry: A mental institution on Route 9.",
        "Katie: That's so weird?",
        "Henry: Yeah. She told me my real father was gonna meet me there, only it's not Jay Stanhope. It's James Stenbeck. I know. It's ridiculous. A little crazy, don't you think? Why aren't you laughing at this?",
        "Katie: Because it might not be that ridiculous.",
        "Henry: The man, he's dead! He's not waiting for me in some insane asylum!",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know that's true, but Margo was just here, and we were looking online, and we found out that Jay Stanhope is an alias used by James Stenbeck.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Katie: It was a federal crime database. She used her password.",
        "Henry: It's a common enough alias, I think. Jay, Jason.",
        "Katie: James.",
        "Henry: And Stanhope is a hotel in New York City. There's probably a dozen Stanhopes running around, concealing their identities.",
        "Katie: Yeah. You're probably right.",
        "Henry: There is no possible way that James Stenbeck can be my father. The man is -- was pure evil. I mean -- I mean, I can be a little selfish, and I gamble, and I can be a little shady, and I like to wear women's clothes every now and then, but that doesn't make me a murderer. Not yet, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Hi. You look beautiful.",
        "Vienna: Hi, Audrey. Henry's not here.",
        "Audrey: Oh, oh. Well, good. Actually, I came to talk with you. It's serious.",
        "Vienna: Oh, no. You're not sick, are you?",
        "Audrey: Oh, well, sick at heart. You know how much it means to me that Henry has you in his life, right? I mean, he just worships and worships you, and when you were gone, he was just beside himself.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. I needed time to think. But I'm so glad you convinced me to come back. Henry's the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Audrey: Well, you've changed him. I mean, he used to love gambling and money and the glamorous life.",
        "Vienna: Well, didn't we all?",
        "Audrey: Well, but now what matters to him is you and doing whatever it takes to make you happy, and he listens to you, and that's why I came to you for help.",
        "Vienna: With what?",
        "Audrey: Please. I had to tell Henry that the man he's called daddy all his life isn't his real father.",
        "Vienna: Who is?",
        "Audrey: A man I knew briefly but biblically when I was sort of on a marriage sabbatical.",
        "Vienna: And you've kept this a secret the whole time?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the sake of the family.",
        "Vienna: This must have been so hard for you. But where is this man right now?",
        "Audrey: He's actually here. He's in Oakdale, yes. He's kind of sick. He's in very poor health, and he's trying to make amends to everybody he's hurt before he dies, and by amends, I mean this guy has a lot of money, which isn't really important here. I just tried to get Henry to see him because I want him to meet with his real father before it's too late.",
        "Vienna: So, what did Henry say when you told him?",
        "Audrey: He went absolutely berserk. I don't think he even believed me. But the grim reaper is a-knocking, so Henry can't afford to wait. If he waits and loses this chance to meet with his real father, he may never, ever forgive himself.",
        "Vienna: You're right. It would break his heart. But maybe not right away. But if we ever have children.",
        "Audrey: Oh, yeah! Knock on wood.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Audrey: Oh, never mind. The point is, is I want Henry to connect with his roots and any opportunities, financially or otherwise, those roots might present. He is not listening to me. I cannot get through to him. But he will listen to you. Please, Vienna, for the love of Henry, will you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is there any remote possibility that what she's saying could be the truth?",
        "Henry: The truth and my mother have never been on speaking terms.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Henry. You deserve better.",
        "Henry: No. I got you. And Vienna and Maddie and the next generation here. That's all I need.",
        "Katie: All right, don't get mad at me for saying this, but could you just go along with it? You know, just out of curiosity. Agree to meet him just to see what happens!",
        "Henry: No! And I can't believe I'm hearing myself say this, but there is no amount of money in the world that would make that worth it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, I thought you were working the swing shift.",
        "Margo: Riley came to see me to say good-bye.",
        "Tom: Well, I asked him not to do that, but I guess that was too much to expect that he would show me any kind of respect after living here for months.",
        "Margo: Why did you do this, Tom?",
        "Tom: I did it for you.",
        "Margo: I'm not your child. I'm your partner.",
        "Tom: But that's the point. We take care of each other. So one carries the burden when it's too heavy for the other one.",
        "Margo: Honey, I'm doing just fine.",
        "Tom: No, Sweetie. You're in trouble. I just -- I don't want to see you hurting any more than you already are.",
        "Margo: But you're hurting me more right now than Riley ever could.",
        "Tom: I'm sorry you feel that way.",
        "Margo: Please, would you not do the wiser-than-thou thing? Would you please just say what you mean?",
        "Tom: I love you, Sweetie, more than -- more than my own life, and I miss Adam, too, just as much as you do, but I'm handling it.",
        "Margo: And I'm not?",
        "Tom: Not in a healthy way, but maybe if you talk to someone.",
        "Margo: So, we're back to this. If I don't agree with you, then I need to see a shrink?",
        "Tom: No one can replace Adam.",
        "Margo: I don't want to replace our son.",
        "Tom: Look, it was time for Riley to go. He'd outstayed his welcome.",
        "Margo: Are you still jealous?",
        "Tom: Absolutely not. I will admit that I had my moment, but we have to face it, Honey. I mean, this kid is young enough to be our son. You were depending on him way too much, Sweetie. It was time for him to go.",
        "Margo: Oh, I wish you could understand.",
        "Tom: Then explain it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Don't take it personally.",
        "Emily: Okay. Is this gonna be the \"It's not you, it's me\" speech? Because if it is, I would rather stick needles in my ear.",
        "Paul: I had brain surgery. They took a small piece of machinery out of my head.",
        "Emily: And it made you tolerable.",
        "Paul: Sure. Everybody likes a guy who's giving away free money.",
        "Emily: You think it was just about the money?",
        "Paul: It's always about the money! You and I, we have an understanding. We love money. We love power.",
        "Emily: No. I am way more complicated than that. Thank you very much.",
        "Paul: I don't think so. I think you took advantage of me.",
        "Emily: You sound like your mother!",
        "Paul: Well, maybe she's right. Come on! Do you really think that if I were in my right mind that I would give you that kind of money? You manipulated me.",
        "Emily: Excuse me? You think that's what I was doing when I was having sex all over this house with you? I was manipulating you?",
        "Paul: I'm not saying it wasn't great sex.",
        "Emily: I meant everything I said and did with you while you were that nice Paul.",
        "Paul: The nice Paul's gone.",
        "Emily: No, no. That Paul, that amnesia guy, was real. It was you, and I liked him. I liked him a lot. I thought we were gonna do great things. You thought so, too. That's why you gave me the money. You gave it to me wholeheartedly. I didn't sex it out of you.",
        "Paul: Technically, it wasn't even me you were sexing.",
        "Emily: It was. It was you for a little while. You think if I knock you in the head you can be that guy again?",
        "Paul: Come on, look. I am not saying that we didn't have our moments, okay? But come on. Buying you a newspaper? That's, like, the world's worst business decision.",
        "Emily: It was the best decision. I'm a great editor.",
        "Paul: Who reads your newspaper?",
        "Emily: Maybe you don't, but I would like to change that.",
        "Paul: I'm not in the business of charity. I want my money back.",
        "Emily: Well, you can forget it. You're not getting it back, not one red cent.",
        "Paul: Don't mess with me.",
        "Emily: Don't mess with me.",
        "Paul: What, now we have a fistfight?",
        "Emily: I'm not afraid of you. I'm leaving. I'm moving out because you're way too obnoxious to live with. But you want your money back? Sue me.",
        "Barbara: What was that about?",
        "Paul: I told her to leave. She didn't like it.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm glad to see you're finally coming to your senses.",
        "Paul: What? I throw Emily out, all of a sudden I'm sane?",
        "Barbara: No. I'm just saying that it's a move in the right direction. I just want what's best for you, and, Honey, it's not too late to go back to the clinic.",
        "Paul: Okay, stop it. Cut it out with the clinic.",
        "Barbara: I'm just saying that maybe we can have a rational conversation about it now that Emily is leaving.",
        "Paul: Emily's out of the picture. I'm in control now.",
        "Barbara: You're in control? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Paul: You'll understand in a minute.",
        "Barbara: Why? What's happening?",
        "Paul: I'm taking you to see someone from your distant past.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry. I'm so happy to see you.",
        "Audrey: We were really, really worried about you.",
        "Henry: Get out.",
        "Vienna: Henry, Audrey told me what happened, and I agree with her. Even if you decide to have nothing to do with your biological father --",
        "Henry: He is not my father. He is just some cockamamie idea that my mother came up with to drive me insane!",
        "Vienna: Well, I know this is a shock, but you have to meet him, and then you can reject him, and I would understand that, but if this man dies and you don't meet him and see him face-to-face, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.",
        "Henry: Liebchen, Sweetheart, I know your heart's in the right place, but you don't understand what you're asking me to do.",
        "Vienna: There's nothing to understand. It's your father. If you have a chance to get to know him, you take it!",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. First of all, this is something my mother probably just made up.",
        "Vienna: And if she didn't?",
        "Henry: I already know him.",
        "Vienna: Who?",
        "Henry: Well, what a shock. Mommy dearest left that part out.",
        "Audrey: I -- I was getting to that. I didn't have a chance.",
        "Henry: The father in question is James Stenbeck.",
        "Vienna: The James Stenbeck that held you prisoner?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. One and the same.",
        "Vienna: Well, why didn't you mention that?",
        "Audrey: Because James didn't know he was his father then!",
        "Henry: Yeah. What she means is that kidnapping is okay as long as the hostage is not a relative.",
        "Audrey: Look. Your father feels --",
        "Henry: Stop calling him my father, okay? Stenbeck is dead. He is rotting in a mausoleum somewhere, and good riddance.",
        "Audrey: He feels terrible about what happened and wants to beg your forgiveness.",
        "Henry: Really? Well, look into your crystal ball and tell him that I'm all out of forgiveness, okay?",
        "Vienna: Maybe you should hear what she has to say.",
        "Henry: Whose side are you on?",
        "Vienna: Yours! Yours! Always! Okay? But -- but unless you go with her, you will never find out if this is true, and I'll go with you.",
        "Audrey: Uh, no, no, no, no. Bad idea.",
        "Vienna: I'm not gonna let him go alone.",
        "Audrey: Well, that's beautiful. It is, but I just think James wants to see Henry alone. He's a little skittish, you know? And if you show up, not following his instructions, maybe he'll just disappear again.",
        "Henry: Now you're channeling ultimatums from a corpse? Come on! Mother, give it a rest!",
        "Audrey: Vienna, please, he's got to go see his real father. Let him do this. Let him draw his own conclusions. Please.",
        "Vienna: You know what, Darling? She's right.",
        "Henry: You know what, Darling? She's nuts.",
        "Vienna: No. You know, either way, you can handle this, and when it's all over, I'll be here waiting for you, okay?",
        "Henry: Fine. I will go, but only so that I can prove you wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: All this talk about Adam being alive, I mean, it's not gonna bring him back.",
        "Margo: That was all just hypothetical.",
        "Tom: I know that, too. I mean, when Adam passed away, you were angry at him. We had both rejected him for what he had done, and I feel guilty as hell about that.",
        "Margo: I know. So do I.",
        "Tom: Okay. So we missed our chance to fix things with Adam, and that may haunt us for the rest of our lives, but he wasn't a saint, and nothing we do is ever gonna change that. We can't will a new end to the story. The truth is, baby, he may have never changed, even if had lived.",
        "Margo: I know that's not the truth. That's not the truth. People do change. Adam could have become a loving, sweet person. I mean, remember, he had so much to give, and he could have come back as a productive member of society, someone who could have made a real difference.",
        "Tom: But he didn't, Honey. He died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: And what are we doing back down here again?",
        "James: Hello, Barbara. Lovely to see you again.",
        "Paul: I'll just let you two get reacquainted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Honey, our son is dead, and we have to face that. My heart is as broken as yours, and I miss him. You're gonna have to find a way to move on.",
        "Margo: No. I'm never gonna find a way to move on.",
        "Tom: I know how you feel.",
        "Margo: No, you don't! You have no idea how I feel, Tom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Whoa. This place is so spooky.",
        "Henry: Hello? Anybody here?",
        "Audrey: Wait a minute. This is it. This is right. This is the right address.",
        "Henry: I don't know, Mother. Maybe the ghosts only come out at sunset.",
        "Audrey: Stop. That is not funny.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it is. You know, even if the guy is alive, he obviously doesn't want to meet me because he's taken off!",
        "Audrey: No. I -- I -- we -- we have to find him.",
        "Henry: No, we don't, and I'm not playing this game.",
        "Audrey: Wait a minute! No! Please, you don't understand. My life depends on it.",
        "Henry: Why do you always have to be so melodramatic?",
        "Audrey: I am not. It's true. My life depends on it, literally, and yours might, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I guess I'm shipping you the rest of your things?",
        "Emily: Don't bother. I'm leaving because you're in a ridiculous mood, and if you really do have your memory back, then you know how damn good we are together.",
        "Paul: Look, I'm not changing my mind.",
        "Emily: Then remember this -- nobody has your back like I do. I'm the only friend you got in this town, and I am the best thing that ever happened to you, so you think about that while I'm gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why don't you ever die?",
        "James: Everybody asks that. You know, I guess it's true what they say, only the good die young.",
        "Barbara: Paul has been through enough. Have the decency to let him just rebuild his life.",
        "James: He's my flesh and blood, Barbara. We'll always be connected.",
        "Barbara: So pretend that you're a human being. Be a father to him. Stop playing these cruel games, and let him be.",
        "James: Let me tell you something. Paul's as big a game player as I ever was.",
        "Barbara: Not even close. So, why are you back? What do you want?",
        "James: It's complicated.",
        "Barbara: So give us a little preview. How are you going to ruin our lives this time, James?",
        "James: I guess you'll just have to wait and see, Barbara.",
