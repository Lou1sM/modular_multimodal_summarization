        "Lucy: I'm really glad you're here, Daddy.",
        "Craig: Well, I had to know how you slept.",
        "Lucy: I didn't really.",
        "Craig: Your mom?",
        "Lucy: She wouldn't let me stay with her. I just, kind of lied there and worried.",
        "Craig: Just about Mom?",
        "Lucy: Isn't that enough?",
        "Craig: Sure, but -- there's more, isn't there?",
        "Lucy: Bad dreams. They'll stop.",
        "Craig: Sweetness, did that man do anything to you that you haven't told anyone?",
        "Lucy: No, no. It was just being in that box. I'd dream I was back there and I couldn't breathe and I'd be screaming and I couldn't --",
        "Craig: Hey, I should've stopped that. I should've stopped that.",
        "Lucy: You tried. You did.",
        "Craig: I would never let anything happen to you.",
        "Lucy: I know.",
        "Craig: Do you know?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know you would never do something like that, but --",
        "Craig: But? But what?",
        "Lucy: I can't believe that Alan would either. And that's the part that scares me. What if it's not over? What if there's still someone out --",
        "Craig: Oh, sweetness. It's over, it's over. I promise, it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey. I came as early as I could.",
        "Sierra: It's morning?",
        "Lily: Yeah. You want me to open the shutters? Have you been out here alone all night?",
        "Sierra: Mother wanted me to come to the main house and Lucy wanted to stay out here with me. But, I couldn't.",
        "Lily: You should not be going through this alone. At a time like this.",
        "Sierra: I have to. I have to. I mean, I have to. This is what it's going to be like. Alan isn't coming back, ever again. I had to make myself believe that.",
        "Lily: You don't have to think about any of that right now.",
        "Sierra: And I have to make myself believe that. But I can't. Did I really marry somebody who just wanted to kidnap my daughter and bury her alive? How could I be that blind?",
        "Lily: You're not blind, you're grieving. Why don't you just take all of this stuff and just let the police figure it out.",
        "Sierra: I don't know if I can.",
        "Lily: Sierra, as bad it is, isn't it better to know the truth?",

        "James: Long night. You must be tired.",
        "Trooper: Your concern is touching.",
        "James: You might as well get some rest. It's not like I can go anywhere.",
        "Trooper: I can. As soon as relief gets here, I'm home in a warm bed. Meantime, I don't take my eyes off you.",

        "[Tape recording, James talking.]",
        "James: Barbara, if you're listening to this tape, it means only one thing. I need your help. Yes, I fear I'm out of options. And you know how I get when that happens, so listen carefully.",

        "Barbara: Jen, you're still here?",
        "Jennifer: I decided not to leave town.",
        "Barbara: Well, honey, your room is --",
        "Jennifer: No, it's yours, Mother. Everything here is yours. Which is why I've made other arrangements. I just came to get the rest of my things.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I am so glad you didn't run off to Europe. You belong here.",
        "Jennifer: You think? Whatever my reason may be?",
        "Barbara: Of course.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I just came from the courthouse. Jordan and Rosanna's marriage is officially being annulled right now. We're are going to live our own lives, mother. And don't start shrieking about how James Stenbeck will stop us. He is on his way to maximum security solitary confinement on the other side of the country. That's right, Mom. Your little plan didn't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: You done?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Jordan is still at the courthouse. The judge saw no reason to delay the annulment, but Jordan's going stay there and walk the papers through the process.",
        "Paul: Probably wants to see it with his own eyes.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. And with my blessing, you know? With your father involved, we can't be too careful.",
        "Paul: No, I just got off with the governor, and he said that, as we speak, James is on his way to Pelican Bay Prison. No ocean view for him, no phones, no visitors. The invincible James Stenbeck has finally been taken down.",
        "Rosanna: We're sure?",
        "Paul: I'm sure.",
        "Rosanna: We did it?",
        "Paul: We did it. It's done. It's done.",
        "Rosanna: We're free!",

        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Julia: Did you get any sleep?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I had a dream. It woke me up.",
        "Julia: Do you remember it?",
        "Jack: It was a wedding, I think. I opened my eyes, I lost it. It was completely gone. Then I looked down and I saw this. How come I didn't see this before?",
        "Julia: Well, you haven't been real active until recently. For the last couple of days, your hand's been bandaged.",
        "Jack: But why didn't I see it before? It's always been there?",
        "Julia: Well, I guess so. This is good, you remember that you're married.",
        "Jack: No, I remember what a wedding ring looks like. It doesn't necessarily mean that I know where it came from or how long it's been there.",
        "Julia: You're definitely married.",
        "Jack: Well, how can you be so sure? Were you at my wedding?",
        "Julia: No, I just -- I don't think that you would be wearing a wedding ring if you weren't still married. If you were divorced or widowed, you really wouldn't.",
        "Jack: So, I don't remember who I am. And I'm married to a woman I can't even remember?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: You think the truth is so simple.",
        "Lily: I know what the truth is, Sierra. I saw Alan with the gun.",
        "Sierra: He needed protection. He was meeting a kidnapper. He wanted to help Lucy!",
        "Lily: Well then why shoot Craig? Why? Why? And why does he have the kidnapper's phone number? Hidden away?",
        "Sierra: Stop it.",
        "Lily: I know, I don't want to believe it. I didn't want to believe it, but I know what I saw. And I know what this, what all this is.",
        "Sierra: It could've been planted! And what you saw in the bell tower wasn't everything. You were hurt and you were scared and -- I just can't do this.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't want to push you. I'm so sorry.",
        "Sierra: Alan is dead. It's over. What does it matter what the whole truth is?",
        "Lily: It is over. But you have to let the police handle this.",
        "Sierra: What is there to handle? I can't relive this every single day. I can't have it dragged through the news when I don't even know what the truth is.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay.",
        "Sierra: I can't go to the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Mom has good radar. It's just not like her to be taken in by some creep.",
        "Craig: Why? Come on, she married me, didn't she? Huh? Hey.",
        "Lucy: You're not a creep.",
        "Craig: I know, I'm just checking.",
        "Lucy: I'm just scared of what it'll do to her if Alan does turn out to be guilty. Lily?",
        "Lily: Your mom's awake.",
        "Lucy: You saw her already? How is she?",
        "Lily: She's shaky. I think she could use a hug from her favorite girl.",
        "Lucy: I should've been out there first thing this morning. I don't even know what I'm going to say to her.",
        "Craig: Just be your beautiful self. That's all mom needs. All right?",
        "Lily: How is she?",
        "Craig: She had nightmares all night.",
        "Lily: That poor girl.",
        "Craig: She'd wake up, she's back in that box, buried alive.",
        "Lily: She'll get better. She and her mom just need some time to heal, you know? I think maybe Sierra is right.",
        "Craig: About what?",
        "Lily: She wants this all to be over. She doesn't want us to tell the police about the things we found at the guest house.",
        "Craig: What? She can't hide this, Lily, she can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Well, this is the last of it. I will have my mail rerouted down at the main desk.",
        "Barbara: That's it?",
        "Jennifer: That's it.",
        "Barbara: Jen, please, please don't do this. You and your brothers are my whole life. You're the only reason that I can get up in the morning. You keep me sane.",
        "Jennifer: I can't carry that around, Mom. And I don't think Paul can, either. You can't run our lives anymore.",
        "Barbara: I am not trying to run your lives. I'm just trying to protect you. Do you understand that? Because I love you, that's why I tried to protect you.",
        "Jennifer: From James Stenbeck. That's always been your excuse, right? Well he's gone now. You can't make that excuse anymore.",
        "Barbara: Jen, please? Jen, Jen, don't. Please, Jen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Parker, how you doin' man? It's good to see you.",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You know, it's really cool outside. You want to go check it out? Okay, why don't you go. I'll be there in a sec, all right?",
        "Carly: Don't go to far, okay?",
        "Parker: Don't worry Mom.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, it's very nice to see everybody so happy.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we have good reason.",
        "Paul: Yeah. My father got transferred to a federal penitentiary in California. He's been completely locked down, completely isolated. His whole support system's been dismantled.",
        "Carly: Well, that's great. Congratulations.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: I'm going to go outside. Can I take Cabot out?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, thank you very much, okay? I appreciate that.",
        "Carly: No, don't. Please. You get to be happy, Rosanna. You really do. And I'm glad that somebody, somewhere can -- it's good for Parker that people --",
        "Rosanna: Sshh.",
        "Carly: Before I went to sleep last night, I swore that I would not cry today. But I woke up, I was on Jack's pillow. I could smell his hair, his soap. And for a moment I thought \"Jack is back. And everything'll be all right.\" Then I opened my eyes. The day's gone downhill since then. So I got a babysitter for Sage, and I threw Parker in the car and we just drove to get out of there. To be anywhere but there.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm glad you came here, all right? We're happy to have you.",
        "Carly: We? We have some catching up to do?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, we do. But we can do it later.",
        "Carly: No. No, I want to now. I'm really happy that you have everything you want. Finally. You deserve it.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Carly: I just want you to treasure every moment. Because you never know. You never know.",

        "Julia: How's my patient?",
        "Dr. Greenwood: Tough as nails. It's a miracle he's come this far. But his blood pressure spiked 40 points when he talked about his memory loss. It's eating at him.",
        "Julia: It's got to be. It's hard to watch.",
        "Dr. Greenwood: Looks like it's stressing out you, too.",
        "Julia: He still wants to believe he knows me. I'm playing along, like you said, but it's hard to know where to draw the line. What if what I'm doing is worse for him in the long run?",
        "Dr. Greenwood: We can't think long term yet. The guy needs something to hold onto now.",
        "Julia: What do you think I should do?",
        "Dr. Greenwood: I'm a G.P., not a shrink. I'll do some research. But for now, I'd say keep him talking, but don't push him to remember. Let him pick up on your conversation. Maybe he can make the transition from you to his real life.",
        "Julia: I hope so. And soon. He seems like a really nice man.",
        "Dr. Greenwood: You sure you're okay treating this patient?",
        "Julia: Yeah, of course. I just -- you know, I know what it's like to be a stranger in town. At least I know who I am, and I know where I came from. I can't imagine what it's like for him, that's all.",
        "Dr. Greenwood: All right. Just do the best you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Hey, must feel good to have those stitches out, huh? I bet they were starting to itch. Hello?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I -- I heard music. A song.",
        "Julia: What song?",
        "Jack: I was staring at my wedding ring, trying to figure out anything. Anything at all. And I heard this song.",
        "Julia: Do you remember it, still?",
        "Jack: Coming together like you and me in this life through the wrong, through the right through the soul sacrifice we have loved through the rise and the fall and it's worth it all there she goes",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump on you --",
        "Lily: No, it's okay.",
        "Craig: -- But Sierra cannot sit on that evidence. Lucy has to know that she's safe.",
        "Lily: Well she knows --",
        "Craig: No, she doesn't know. She can't believe that Alan could have done something like that. She thinks there's somebody still out there.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Craig: That's what she said this morning.",
        "Lily: Well, that's not good. She can't walk around thinking she's in danger --",
        "Craig: And now, Dusty's going to be talking smack about me! Filling her head, egging her on.",
        "Lily: No, he has got to give up on that now.",
        "Craig: Are you kidding? He needs me to be the bad guy so he can protect her.",
        "Lily: Excuse me, there is evidence. He saw the evidence last night.",
        "Craig: Well, don't count on him to go to the police.",
        "Lily: I told Sierra that we could drop this.",
        "Craig: Well, Sierra's not thinking straight. You know? We have a responsibility here.",
        "Lily: Nikki -- Nikki did want to take our statements today.",
        "Craig: So, we have to tell her everything. For Lucy's sake.",

        "Jack/Julia: MM it's worth it all",
        "Jack: You know that? You know that song. How do you know that song?",
        "Julia: Yeah, of course. Come on, it's a very popular song. A lot of people would. Sorry. Listen, I have a good idea, okay? You keep singing the song to yourself, to me, and we'll see if it jogs any memories. Okay?",
        "Jack: Day, night, coming together like you and me in this life through the wrong through the right through the soul sacrifice",
        "Julia: Anything? No?",
        "Jack: All I could think of was how beautiful you are.",

        "Carly: Okay. Tell me about Paul. Is he going to stay on here with you?",
        "Rosanna: We're together.",
        "Carly: No, I got that. Tell me.",
        "Rosanna: Do you really want to hear about this right now?",
        "Carly: Yes. I'd like to hear something happy.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Well, we're happy. The whole time we had to fight James. I guess that's when I saw and felt a part of Paul that I never knew was there before. He was strong when I couldn't be. And he did the impossible. He faced down his father. And he did it for us.",
        "Carly: That's so romantic.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it is. He was funny when I wanted to cry. He was tender, and passionate --",
        "Carly: And you love him.",
        "Rosanna: I feel more myself with Paul than I think I've ever felt.",
        "Carly: Well, I've thought of James Stenbeck as a lot of things -- but never as a matchmaker.",

Take care of my request and all is well. Because in the end, darling, you can always count on me and I can always count on you.",

        "Rosanna: Oh, come on now, you know you don't have to rush into anything. Just take your time.",
        "Carly: For what? There's no body, Rosanna. And that's -- that's the hardest part about this. There's no body to bury. It's just this nothingness. This limbo.",
        "Rosanna: I know. I know. But look, you don't have to decide anything right now. Listen to me. All you have to do is get through one day at a time, okay? For you and your babies. Right? And take good care of yourself. Okay? And know that you never, ever, have to worry about anything. And certainly not about money, okay?",
        "Carly: That's kind.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, I mean it. Anything you need. Anything you want. I'm gonna take care of you, all right? I love you, you're my sister. You're not alone. Don't forget that.",

        "Craig: Ahh, if you cared, you wouldn't carry this vendetta.",
        "Dusty: It's not a vendetta. It's a fair warning. I know you planted the evidence. You got everyone convinced that Alan Drake's the bad guy.",

        "Carly: Do you know how to play baseball?",
        "Paul: Enough. See, I know how to deal with 7-year-olds. It's not even about that, Carly. It's more about Parker having a guy in his life that cares about him that he sees on a regular basis.",
