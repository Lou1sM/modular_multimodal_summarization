        "Margo: Tom? Don't!",
        "Rick: It doesn't look like you've left yourself much room to negotiate, Lieutenant. Your husband's heart seems to be falling down on the job.",
        "Margo: You want to cut a deal, you make the first concession.",
        "Rick: Which is?",
        "Margo: Tom, who needs medical attention now. I consider nothing 'til then.",
        "Rick: Done. I'd say he's in cardiac distress. He needs oxygen. He's suffering from an elevated heart rate, and he's breathing heavy. I'd put him on a monitor and give him an aspirin.",
        "Margo: That's right, and you're a funnyman.",
        "Rick: Do I look amused? No. I want you to make sure that there's a helicopter waiting for me. I'll forego the money. I'm sure it was marked, anyway. And I want free and clear passage out of here. No police, no FBI interference.",
        "Margo: You don't ask much, do you?",
        "Rick: Just see that I get it, because if you don't come through for me, you will be responsible for killing your husband. In fact, you're gonna kill everyone in this room.",
        "Rick: Tick tock, Lieutenant. Time's wasting.",
        "Paul: Margo, what are you waiting for? Call the helicopter back!",
        "Margo: Not until Tom gets help.",
        "Paul: You're gonna get everybody in there killed!",
        "Chris: Paul, shut up!",
        "Casey: Dad?",

        "Casey: What's wrong with my dad?",
        "Margo: Casey, don't worry. Stay calm.",
        "Meg: I'm gonna loosen his tie to clear his airway so he can get more oxygen.",
        "Rick: All right, get back! That's enough!",
        "Casey: Dad!",
        "Meg: Its okay, Casey.",
        "Rick: Your husband has gotten all the medical attention he's going to get. I've held up my side of the deal. It's your turn now.",

        "Paul: You don't seem to be in charge, either.",
        "Margo: I'm cleaning up the mess that you made. You're the one who brought Decker here. That's why these people are being held hostage. So you stay out of it!",
        "Chris: Margo, just let him go. I've got the antidote. We don't need Decker.",

        "Margo: Tom!",
        "Meg: You're supposed to be a doctor! Please, you need to help him!",
        "Rick: That's up to Margo now. So, what's it going to be? Huh? Are you gonna let me go and save a handful of people, or are you going to keep me here and watch them all die? I'm waiting for your answer, Lieutenant.",
        "Paul: Margo, make the call!",
        "Margo: Back off. Just back off. Chris, are you sure that your antidote works?",
        "Chris: Yes. I tested it on myself.",
        "Rick: Stop stalling, Lieutenant! You're about to lose your husband.",
        "Emily: No!",
        "Casey: Emily!",

        "Margo: Yes, you have.",
        "Rick: Now, this young man was an unforeseen victim -- one that neither of us expected. So, in the interest of fairness, I'll let you pick the next victim. Your beloved husband or your precious son. You decide.",

        "Kim: What is it?",
        "Bob: Track mark. Decker injected the poison directly into Susan's system. Chris is working on an antidote. We need it now.",

        "Rick: What do you think I'm doing? I'm taking her with me.",
        "Emily: No! No, that was not part of the deal!",
        "Rick: It's part of the deal. You think I'm gonna walk out of here without any insurance?",
        "Emily: Please, just, you can't take her. Look at her. She's so weak. You're never gonna get far with her. Just take me.",
        "Rick: Thank you for the offer, Emily, but -- that was very sweet, but I need to take someone that people really care about. You, I don't think so. Okay, come on. Out of the way. Let's go! Move it!",

        "Meg: I tried to shoot you.",
        "Paul: Okay, so -- I don't know. Maybe, you can mow the lawn or something for the rest of your life. Front and back. And you can't ride the mower.",
        "Meg: How can you joke about this?",
        "Paul: How could you miss from so close, and you a farm girl? Ow! Hey, look. Hey. Even in the state you were in, you fought it the whole way. It's not like you ever wanted to hurt me.",
        "Meg: Sofie and those visions, that just seemed so real. They kept coming back again and again. I really thought you were trying to hurt me.",

        "Chris: What do you mean \"It's gone\"? That's impossible. Check again! I made enough for everyone.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Decker attacked Dr. Stewart. He injected her with the poison directly. They had to give her double the dosage.",
        "Chris: And that used it all up. Oh, no, no. I gotta go make more. She's got to pull through this. I promised her.",

        "Susan: How could I not see that it had to be Rick? If anybody should know what that man is truly capable of, it's me. Why didn't I put that together?",
        "Emily: No. I told you, there was no way you could have known. God, the man's a monster. He had the whole plan set in motion before you uttered a word. Oh, my God. When I think about what could have happened, I mean, I could have lost you and Ali and Casey.",
        "Susan: Casey okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Yeah, he is now, but -- oh, my God, Mother. It was awful. He had a gun -- he had a gun to Casey's head. I swear to God, he was gonna do it.",
        "Susan: I'm sorry, Honey.",
        "Emily: I was so afraid for him, more than I was for myself.",
        "Susan: Because you love him. I see that now.",

        "Casey: Mom? You're staring at me.",
        "Margo: Am I?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Maybe when I was out of it, it was okay. But now that I'm awake, it's -- it's kind of weird.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm sorry, but there were a couple of moments here today that I thought I wasn't gonna see that face again.",
        "Casey: I wouldn't let you off the hook that easy.",
        "Margo: For once, I won't complain.",
        "Casey: I'm gonna remind you you said that the next time you're mad at me.",
        "Margo: Go ahead, I don't mind.",
        "Casey: We'll see. I don't know what I would have done if something happened to Emily or Dad today.",
        "Margo: Shh. No. You really love her, don't you?",
        "Casey: That's why I married her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.",
        "Bob: Well, how's my grandson?",
        "Casey: He wants out. Your beds? They're lumpy.",
        "Bob: Oh, we got attitude. That means you're really better. Listen, I thought you'd like to know that Tom's out of surgery. The procedure was a success. He's in recovery. If you'd like to see him, I'll take you right over there.",
        "Casey: Go, go, go. I'll be fine. Tell Dad I love him, okay?",
        "Margo: Okay. I love you.",
        "Casey: I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Margo: Okay. Can I just have a second? Emily, um -- your husband -- you should be in there with him. He's waiting for you.",

        "Chris: Of course, I did. I wasn't gonna let anything bad happen to you.",
        "Alison: You did it, didn't you? Just like you said, you found a cure.",
        "Chris: I just got lucky.",
        "Alison: You saved me. You saved all of us.",
        "Chris: Is that a \"Thank you\"? Because you don't have to do that.",
        "Alison: No, I want to. Thank you, Chris. Thank you with all of my heart.",
        "Chris: I'm gonna let you get some rest now, okay?",
        "Alison: You're leaving?",
        "Chris: If you want me to stay, I will, if you do. As long as you want.",

        "Chris: Anything.",
        "Alison: Where's Aaron? I remember seeing him, Chris. In that room with Rick.",
        "Chris: You should get some rest, okay? Your body's been through a mess of trauma.",
        "Alison: Is he okay?",
        "Chris: Yeah. Yeah, he's fine.",
        "Alison: What happened? I know something happened, and if you don't tell me, I will find someone who will.",
        "Chris: Rick shot him.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Chris: The bullet hit him in his shoulder. There was a lot of bleeding, but we got it under control. He's gonna be up and walking around real soon. I promise. Okay?",

        "Bob: Have I told you how glad I am that you have a healthy appetite.",
        "Kim: No. Why?",
        "Bob: Well, because you were in the cafeteria when Dr. Decker had all of those people hostage in that room.",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Bob: If you'd have been in there, I don't know what I would have done.",
        "Kim: Well, I suppose you would have come riding in on your white charger and rescued me, my man of steel.",
        "Bob: You better believe it. The old guy's got a few moves left, you know.",
        "Kim: And don't I just know that. Actually, I'm just so grateful that we all got through this. I mean, it could have been so much worse.",
        "Bob: Yeah. We're very lucky. I think tonight's the night to count all our blessings, and I know my main one because she's impossible to forget.",

        "Tom: The way you snore.",
        "Margo: I do not snore!",
        "Tom: You snore. It's just -- it's very ladylike, like tiny, little birds.",
        "Margo: Okay. Okay. Um, that weird little song that you sing when you think no one's looking and you're doing the dishes.",
        "Tom: About the soap suds? That's a good one.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Tom: Your cooking.",
        "Margo: My cooking? I thought we were listing things you're most grateful for.",
        "Tom: I'm very grateful for your cooking. Sometimes it inspires us to order Chinese food. I like my egg rolls.",
        "Margo: I love you. That's what I'm most grateful for. Sometimes I think I forget, but I will never, ever take what we have for granted ever, no matter how long.",
        "Tom: Me either. You're staring at me.",
        "Margo: Boy, you and Casey, you got a problem with a pretty lady looking at you.",
        "Tom: You made nice with Casey? Yeah, me too. I even gave him my blessing on their marriage.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, Tom, no need to go overboard.",
        "Tom: Um, next time our son gets married, a little heads up.",
        "Margo: I know. I'm sorry. I kind of forgot to mention that.",
        "Tom: Yeah, you kind of did.",

        "Emily: Can't we just pretend?",
        "Casey: No, no, no, no pretending about anything. Besides, I don't want to forget about today. Think about it. My mom and dad -- they accepted us. They accepted that we love each other and our marriage is real. When my dad gave -- gave us his blessing, it meant so much. It meant that I was right.",
        "Emily: Right about what?",

        "Emma: Oh, Sweetheart! Oh, that is the most wonderful news I've heard all day. I'll make up your old room, and I'll make you your favorite supper. And I'll pamper you. I'll pamper you all night long.",
        "Meg: You know, I would -- I would really, really love that, but the farm isn't my home anymore.",
        "Emma: Right. I just thought, under the circumstances that you might be more comfortable there. But you're right, you're right. Your home is -- your home is with Paul now. Call you in the morning. I love you.",
        "Paul: Emma, listen. If, uh -- look, why don't you come back to Fairwinds with us? You know, help Meg get settled in. That way, you can spend some time with her. And if you'd like, you can even take over my kitchen. It's all brand-new stuff, I think. I don't know. I don't really spend a lot of time there.",
        "Emma: Thank you, Paul. Thank you. I'd like that.",
