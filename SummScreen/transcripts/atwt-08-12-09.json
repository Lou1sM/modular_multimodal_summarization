        "Bob and Alison talk about the incident with Riley, as Alison admits that she doesn't believe it was her fault. Bob is upset to hear Alison's recount and tells her that her handling of this situation and not admitting to what she did (even though she did nothing wrong) leads him to tell her that her job is in jeopardy. Casey and Adam disagree on his place in their family since noone is aware of who he is. Janet is nervous on her first day on set of Oakdale Now. Jack asks Terri to cater a lunch for Janet in honor of her first day. Terri is thrilled and Craig is able to convince Jack to have it at Metro. Brad is in charge of getting Janet to the surprise lunch. A rattled Bob tells Kim about his conversation with Alison and how disappointed in her he is. Alison confides in Riley about what happened with Bob and he urges her to tell someone if she is that concerned that Bob could hurt someone regardless of Casey or anyone else. Janet is thrilled with her surprise lunch until she overhears Terri and Kim talking about how she was going to host with Brad before Janet. Janet doesn't react well and lashes out at everyone. She informs everyone she is quitting until Craig steps up and tells Janet that he ordered Terri not to take the job; that way, Janet doesn't think she took Terri's sloppy seconds. Jack seems appreciative and Terri thinks that Craig is wonderful for how he is so quietly caring about Carly and her family when everyone else thinks he is not. Casey sees Riley talking closely with Alison and reacts poorly demanding he stay away from her or else. Alison speaks with Kim about Bob; Kim is furious thinking she is passing the buck. In the middle of their argument, Kim collapses. Alison performs CPR and rushes her to the hospital where she sees Casey and tells him that Kim has had a heart attack."

        "Bob: Alison?",
        "Alison: Dr. Hughes. Is there anything I can do for you?",
        "Bob: We have to talk about what happened the other day.",
        "Alison: I agree.",
        "Bob: We were both focusing on caring for the patient, which is as it should be, but now that Riley Morgan is on his feet again --",
        "Alison: We need to talk about the overdose.",
        "Bob: Yes. You gave the patient an extreme overdose of that medication. A mistake that could have caused his death.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Dr. Hughes --",
        "Bob: I appreciate your apology, but this situation --",
        "Alison: But I don't think that was my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Hey, Casey.",
        "Casey: I thought you moved out.",
        "Riley: I did. I gave my keys back. That's why I used the patio door.",
        "Casey: You ever heard of using the bell? You know, people that don't live here usually --",
        "Riley: Yeah. Well, I forgot a few things. I thought Tom and Margo would have already left for work. I didn't want to -- I didn't want to bother them.",
        "Casey: They're gone.",
        "Riley: So, am I bothering you now?",
        "Casey: Not as long as you're in and out fast. It's no bother.",
        "Riley: I'm glad to see my moving out didn't shatter you.",
        "Casey: Look, Adam, I know Mom wanted you to stick around, but even you have to admit, it was time for you to leave. You were causing too much tension between them.",
        "Riley: That's because Dad still thinks I'm Riley Morgan. You know, I really wish I could tell him the truth.",
        "Casey: Well, go ahead. I know you'd be in jail, but you'd be you.",
        "Riley: You know, I'd better go get my stuff.",
        "Casey: So, where you headed, huh? Chicago? Back overseas?",
        "Riley: Nowhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You told me to administer 50 milligrams of Ventricle.",
        "Bob: I told you that?",
        "Alison: Yes, and I even asked you twice, because I thought the dose was too high. But you insisted.",
        "Bob: I have been prescribing medications long before you were even born. I would never give a patient 50 milligrams of Ventricle when the proper dosage is 5. I don't make mistakes like that.",
        "Alison: No, maybe not consciously, but --",
        "Bob: What are you saying? That I wasn't in full control of my faculties or -- oh, that I was drinking?",
        "Alison: No, no! Not that!",
        "Bob: Oh, I see. I see what it is. It's just my incompetence. Is that what you're implying?",
        "Alison: No. I just meant that maybe you weren't fully aware of what you were doing because of the heightened circumstance!",
        "Bob: Maybe you didn't hear me correctly. Isn't that a possibility?",
        "Alison: It's possible, yes, but I'm --",
        "Bob: You see, I think that is the real explanation. Alison, I've been very supportive of you and your work here.",
        "Alison: I know you have, but --",
        "Bob: I believe that you had the potential to be a fine nurse.",
        "Alison: And I appreciate that, but this --",
        "Bob: I'm giving you a warning. Because of your actions, because of your refusal to take responsibility, your job here is in jeopardy at the hospital. As of right now, you're on notice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I'm Janet Ciccone, and today we are going to be learning all about cooking Italian style. Oh, man! I'm so nervous! I'm gonna end up chopping off a finger instead of garlic!",
        "Brad: Oh, give me those.",
        "Janet: What are you doing?",
        "Brad: Look, index cards are old-school. All you have to do, just be yourself.",
        "Janet: Oh, great.",
        "Brad: And, oh, the second rule is keep your eye -- watch the camera with the red light on it.",
        "Janet: That one over there?",
        "Brad: Or it could be this one over here. They switch around.",
        "Janet: Well, why can't they just make all the cameras red? And why do they have to make all of the lights so tiny? I can't see!",
        "Brad: Don't worry. You're gonna get the hang of it. You've done this before. And if you get nervous, all you have to do is look at me, all right? Janet, yes. Just like that. You're gonna do great.",
        "Kim: And that is the only thing that he said that you should listen to.",
        "Janet: Oh, Kim. I'm so sorry. I think we've made a huge mistake. There's no way I'm gonna be able to remember all of this!",
        "Kim: You're gonna be just fine, I promise you. All you have to do is relax and be your own bubbly self. That is why we hired you.",
        "Brad: What'd I tell you?",
        "Kim: And one other thing -- don't forget to breathe.",
        "Janet: Breathe.",
        "Kim: Good.",
        "Janet: Right.",
        "Kim: Very good.",
        "Janet: Well, I did light a candle to St. Clare last night hoping that today would go well. So, here's to hoping.",
        "Kim: St. Clare?",
        "Janet: Patron saint of television.",
        "Brad: Television has a saint?",
        "Janet: Everything has a saint, Bradley.",
        "Kim: Well, as long as you're talking to St. Clare for some help, see if she'll zing a couple of rating points over to us.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Kim: Is something wrong over there?",
        "Janet: I'm just trying to make sure I have all of the ingredients.",
        "Brad: Janet, Janet, you checked them like 10,000 times. Unless they grew feet and started to walk, they're still there.",
        "Kim: Okay. The way we handle stage fright is we just dive in and get it over with. All right? You two ready?",
        "Janet: Now?",
        "Kim: Okay. We're just gonna go to tape. We're not doing this live. Taping for a future program, so it doesn't matter if it's not perfect.",
        "Janet: Okay. Well, you know what? It'll be perfect, I promise.",
        "Kim: Wonderful, wonderful. All right, everybody, places, please!",
        "Janet: Oh, St. Clare, please let it be perfect.",
        "Kim: All right, stand by. And roll tape. And five, four, three, two --",
        "Brad: Hi, I'm Brad Snyder.",
        "Janet: Oh, and I'm Janet Ciccone! And today we're gonna learn all about cooking Italian style.",
        "Brad: So sit back and get ready to enjoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: The kitchen is much larger than I would have thought for a club this size.",
        "Craig: I'm glad you like it.",
        "Teri: I'm gonna need a larger knife block and at least one more oven, and if we could knock down that wall and expand the pantry -- I am getting ahead of myself.",
        "Craig: That's okay. I've been known to get carried away myself once in a while.",
        "Teri: Oh, I'm not even officially the chef yet.",
        "Craig: But you will be. Now, the final say is up to Carly, of course. But once she gets a taste of your cooking, I'm sure she won't rest until she puts you in charge of this place and you turn it into a destination restaurant.",
        "Teri: You don't think small, do you?",
        "Craig: Nope. Never saw the point.",
        "Teri: Neither did I. You own a share of this place, right?",
        "Craig: Nope, not a scrap.",
        "Teri: So, all this, everything you're doing, is for Carly?",
        "Craig: Carly's my fianc\u00e9e. I vowed to spend my life making her happy. Just because she's not here doesn't mean I get to slack off.",
        "Teri: The way you look out for her, it's really amazing.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Wow. Kind of a nice change to get some appreciation for my efforts, instead of the usual barrage of insults. Speaking of which --",
        "Jack: Craig, Teri.",
        "Craig: Jack!",
        "Teri: Parker is taking pictures with his aunt for the vitamin water, and Sage is at her dance class at the community center, so I'm not goofing off, if that's what you were thinking.",
        "Jack: No, no, no. I'm not here to check on you. I need to ask you a favor. There are things going on This is Janet's first day shooting \"Oakdale Now.\"",
        "Teri: Oh, my God! Is there a TV here? What time is she on?",
        "Jack: Relax. She's not on air. She's taping a segment. But she's still nervous about it.",
        "Teri: Of course she is. She's gonna be on TV. Who wouldn't be nervous?",
        "Jack: Exactly. So, that's why I was thinking it might be nice if after taping, we throw her a little surprise lunch to celebrate.",
        "Teri: I see Janet has taught you the Ciccone family motto -- there isn't an occasion, happy or sad, that a good meal would make a little bit better.",
        "Jack: Wow. You are definitely Janet's little sister, aren't you?",
        "Teri: Right down to the ladle.",
        "Jack: Great, because I was hoping that you could head the lunch.",
        "Teri: Oh, like I'd let anyone else do it. If it's okay with Craig. Like I said, Parker and Sage are gonna be out all afternoon, so I'll have plenty of time. Would you mind?",
        "Craig: Of course not! In fact, I'll do you one better. Why don't we have the lunch here?",
        "Teri: That's a great idea!",
        "Jack: Janet would probably like it better if it were at home, at the farm.",
        "Craig: But how special would that be?",
        "Jack: It will be fine.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but why have fine when you can go for spectacular? I know that the farm is nice and cozy and all that, but when it comes to festive, there's no comparison.",
        "Teri: I'll have plenty of room to spread out, and I can make tons of appetizers and a couple desserts.",
        "Jack: I'm not talking about a big event here, though.",
        "Craig: Well, why not? Your wife's about to become a TV star. Why don't we pull out all of the stops and celebrate that? Unless you really think its better that Teri slapped together a few sandwiches in Emma's kitchen, just because it was my idea.",
        "Jack: You're the one doing the cooking. If you'd like to do it here, that's fine with me.",
        "Teri: It's gonna be great.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Teri: I promise.",
        "Jack: I'll make sure that Janet gets here, okay?",
        "Teri: Well, how many people are you inviting?",
        "Jack: I'm not really sure. Let me make some phone calls, and I'll get you a firm number, okay?",
        "Teri: I am so glad you said that we should have it here. She's gonna love it.",
        "Craig: Your sister is one of the only people that will give me the time of day in this burgh. And annoying Jack is just kind of a plus. You just make sure you pull out all the stops.",
        "Teri: Are you kidding? I cannot wait to get my hands on this kitchen. I have tons of ideas.",
        "Craig: Did you forget something?",
        "Teri: You know, I was just thinking, this is what you do. You come up with something that works for everyone. How cool is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Bradley.",
        "Brad: Wow. I think that is -- I think that is the best meatball I've ever had in my life.",
        "Janet: And there's more where that came from.",
        "Brad: Wow.",
        "Kim: And we're out! Good. Hot dog.",
        "Brad: Kim, I think we need to do that one again.",
        "Janet: Yeah. I messed up, didn't I?",
        "Kim: No, no, no. That was a fine take. What do you think went wrong?",
        "Brad: No, nothing. I just want Janet to feed me another one of those meatballs. Those are really fantastic. I'm like -- I'm like serious.",
        "Janet: Oh, thanks, Bradley! Hey, Kim, are you sure that was okay, because I was so nervous, I didn't know what to do with my hands. I was trying not to pay attention to the cameras.",
        "Kim: But that's exactly what you should be doing.",
        "Janet: Okay. Well, I was so nervous that I was chopping so many times. What did you think when the garlic got away from me?",
        "Kim: I thought it was a hoot.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brad: Brad, TV star, here.",
        "Jack: Brad, it's me. Don't let Janet know.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Jack: I'm setting up a surprise lunch at Metro to celebrate Janet's first day on the job.",
        "Brad: Oh, oh. That's great.",
        "Jack: Good. Can you get her here?",
        "Brad: How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Jack: I don't know. Think of something. And don't forget to invite Kim, too.",
        "Brad: Will do. Hey. You know, being around all this food has made me hungry, so what do you say we go get lunch at Metro? My treat.",
        "Janet: What the heck for? We got a whole bunch of meatballs here. We can't let them go to waste. Here. Bradley, eat up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: What I need to do is stick around here and help her get through this, help her get up the nerve to tell Dad the truth.",
        "Casey: Yeah. And the longer it takes her to do that, the longer you stay out of jail.",
        "Riley: The longer I stick around here, and especially Mom, the more likely it is that I'll get caught. Right? But I'm willing to do that if that's what she wants.",
        "Casey: You know, what Dad and I want doesn't seem to matter very much to either one of you. I'm just --",
        "Riley: Casey, you're my brother, and I love you, and I love and respect Dad a hell of a lot. You know, I was really hoping that we'd all be on the same side about this.",
        "Casey: And if we're not?",
        "Riley: You know, I'm gonna do what I think is right, whether you think it is or not. So deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You're not eating the meatballs. Are they not good? I used too much salt, didn't I? I used too much salt. I always do that.",
        "Brad: Janet, Janet. Believe me, the meatballs are great.",
        "Janet: Well, then, why aren't you eating them?",
        "Brad: Because they're props.",
        "Janet: My meatballs are props?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's right. The actors are not supposed to eat the props. It's, like, a union rule. If you want to be a pro, you're gonna have to learn this stuff.",
        "Janet: It's food. You're supposed to eat it.",
        "Brad: I know, I know. But you can't eat it, you know, until the shooting is completely done, you know? What if they need to reshoot? Not because you did anything, but what if, you know, the tape broke or audio warp, and they need to reshoot the whole segment over again?",
        "Janet: So, I'll make more. What's the big deal?",
        "Brad: Because they need to have everything the same in order to edit everything together. It's like a -- it's a meatball continuity.",
        "Janet: Meatball continuity?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I mean, this union is really hard-nosed about it.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. I almost embarrassed myself, didn't I? I didn't know.",
        "Brad: No. I'm serious, it can happen to anybody, you know. It's just one of those things you learn. It's, like, I mean, you wouldn't know it. You know the industry.",
        "Janet: Oh. Oh, okay, okay. Well, thanks for stopping me from messing up and embarrassing myself. I didn't know.",
        "Brad: Hey, cool. Are you ready to get something to eat?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Brad: Okay. All right, let's go. Metro it is.",
        "Janet: No, no. I want to go to Al's. I'm in the mood for a bacon cheeseburger.",
        "Brad: Listen, my treat. I say it's Metro.",
        "Janet: Okay, fine. I'll just powder my nose.",
        "Kim: Meatball continuity, huh? Oh, brother.",
        "Brad: No, keep it down. Look, Jack is planning a surprise lunch for Janet at Metro.",
        "Kim: Oh!",
        "Brad: Yeah. So, I'm in charge of bringing her there.",
        "Kim: Oh, great, great.",
        "Brad: You're invited, too.",
        "Kim: Oh, gee. Now, huh? I'd love to do it, but Bob and I have a lunch once a week, and this is the day. But I tell you what, I will stop by later and make a toast or something.",
        "Brad: Well, I think that would be great.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Kim: See you, Brad.",
        "Brad: All right. See you later. Bye, Kim.",
        "Janet: Bye, Kim. Thank you.",
        "Kim: Uh-huh.",
        "Janet: What just happened there, huh? When I came in, you two pulled apart. You were talking about me, weren't you?",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Janet: Right? I did something wrong, and Kim just didn't want to tell me, huh?",
        "Brad: Don't be ridiculous! What are you talking about? You know what? Stop being so paranoid. Let's get you something to eat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry. I know I'm late.",
        "Bob: That's okay. Busy morning at the studio?",
        "Kim: Oh, holy smokes. I'll say so. We were taping Janet's first segment for \"Oakdale Now\" today, and I just really wanted to give her, you know, a little more time.",
        "Bob: How did she do?",
        "Kim: Oh, very well. Very well. She and Brad have a very nice relationship.",
        "Bob: Well, I should hope so. They have a child together.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Well, as you know, no one can ruin a relationship between a man and a woman quite the way a child can. Honey?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry. Did you say something?",
        "Kim: Something happen at the hospital? You're kind of distracted.",
        "Bob: Alison Stewart again.",
        "Kim: Now what?",
        "Bob: Riley Morgan was admitted a few days ago with the flu. Alison gave him an extreme overdose of a drug. It almost shut down his lungs permanently. Luckily, we caught it in time.",
        "Kim: Well, did she have any explanation as to how this happened?",
        "Bob: She wouldn't even admit that she made a mistake.",
        "Kim: Of course, you know, you can be very intimidating. I mean, she must have been terrified and embarrassed.",
        "Bob: I tried to be understanding. I mean, we all make mistakes, especially when we're starting out. But not to learn from them? That's inexcusable.",
        "Kim: Are you gonna fire her?",
        "Bob: I hope not. I mean, I thought she'd matured past that mixed-up kid she used to be. But her reaction to this incident is really disappointing, and I'm not sure that she's really cut out to be a nurse anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Riley.",
        "Riley: I was gonna take a look at the classifieds, but it seems like you need someone to talk to.",
        "Alison: Well, you may not want to listen. I'm not really good company right now.",
        "Riley: Why? What happened?",
        "Alison: Dr. Hughes lectured me this morning about giving you that overdose.",
        "Riley: I thought you said he was the one who prescribed the dose.",
        "Alison: He was, but he doesn't remember it that way.",
        "Riley: Well, what's the worst that can happen? Is he gonna put you on probation?",
        "Alison: No. I mean, I've already been on probation for something not nearly this bad. He warned me that I could lose my job over this.",
        "Riley: Well, would it help if I talked to Dr. Hughes and told him that I'm not gonna press charges?",
        "Alison: That's really very sweet, but it wouldn't do any good. He is determined to blame me for this, and he insists that he told me the correct dosage.",
        "Riley: But you know he didn't.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't want to swear to it, but, yeah, I'm pretty sure he didn't.",
        "Riley: Have you talked to anybody else about this?",
        "Alison: Just Casey. And he doesn't think I should tell anyone about it, you know, unless I'm completely sure, which I totally understand. I mean, nobody, including me, wants to think that there's anything wrong with Dr. Hughes.",
        "Riley: No, but you're afraid he could make another mistake.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and with another patient. And while I'm keeping my mouth shut, afraid of losing my job --",
        "Riley: Someone could die.",
        "Alison: Or I could tell everybody that Bob Hughes has lost it, and I could be wrong. I mean, what if I'm wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, Teri's really cooking up a storm in there. The way she's going at it, you'd think she was feeding 60 people, not 6.",
        "Craig: Yeah. I noticed right away that if Teri's doing the cooking, it's best to just stay out of the room. You might end up as part of the main course.",
        "Jack: You really lucked out with her.",
        "Craig: Well, your kids are reaping the benefits.",
        "Jack: Now, on that, we can agree. It was great for them that she decided not to take that gig at WOAK.",
        "Craig: Hypothetically speaking, Jack --",
        "Jack: Your hypotheticals never are.",
        "Craig: What if Teri had decided to pursue some TV stardom for herself, instead of taking care of your kids? Would you really make Parker and Sage move out to the farm?",
        "Jack: Absolutely. What's important to me is that they're safe, Craig.",
        "Craig: Safe from what?",
        "Jack: You know the answer to that.",

        "Jack: Not in this life.",
        "Craig: Well, I guess we should both be glad things never got to that point.",
        "Jack: Yeah, thanks to Brad.",
        "Craig: Brad?",
        "Jack: Well, you don't know, do you? Brad was able to convince Teri not to take the job at WOAK so she could stick to looking after Parker and Sage.",
        "Craig: Did he?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. He also got her to agree not to say anything to Janet about her being offered the job first, and I would appreciate it if that secret was kept.",
        "Craig: Oh, you can trust me, Jack.",
        "Jack: That would be a first.",

        "Riley: If you think Bob Hughes shouldn't be treating patients, you need to tell somebody about it.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it was one mistake.",
        "Riley: Which you caught because you were paying attention. And if you don't warn anybody --",
        "Alison: Yeah, but they're gonna have the same reaction that Casey had. They're gonna want to know if I'm absolutely sure, which I'm not. What am I gonna do?",

        "Teri: Don't give me that. Why'd you let Brad take all the credit?",
        "Craig: If Jack knew that I was responsible, he'd assume I have an agenda, and then he'd reconsider taking Parker and Sage back out to the farm. But I want Carly's kids in their own home, and that's exactly where they're going to be.",

        "Riley: Wait -- wait a second. You don't think that I'd actually hurt her?",
        "Casey: Why, because you're so good with women? Let me ask Gwen and Maddie about that.",
        "Riley: That was a long time ago, all right? I was a different person then.",
        "Casey: Come on. You were a person that couldn't take no for an answer. Just because your name and your face is different, doesn't mean you've changed. Who's to say you won't try the same thing with Ali if you got the chance?",
        "Riley: You know, you've said a lot of hurtful things to me, Casey, but that is the absolute worst thing one brother has ever said to another.",

        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Jack: Take the compliment!",
        "Janet: Sorry, sorry.",
        "Kim: That's all right. The point I was trying to make is I do have some experience in this business, and I have a pretty good sense of what works. And I can speak with some assurance that you and Brad definitely work. And, so, here is to our newest asset at \"Oakdale Now,\" Janet Ciccone-Snyder.",

        "Kim: Oh, thanks. I needed that.",
        "[Laughter]",

        "Janet: Oh, thank you, Kim, for coming, and thank you for everything.",
        "Kim: Oh, thank you for joining us. Love you. Okay, see you all later.",

        "Teri: Please do.",

        "Janet: I'll tell you one thing she doesn't have -- the most fabulous husband in the whole world to come home to.",
        "Jack: And that's good, 'cause I don't think there's a man alive that could handle two Ciccone sisters.",
        "Janet: Hey!",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: You wish. Listen, I'm gonna go thank her for this party. I wouldn't want her to get a complex or anything.",
        "Kim: Mmm. Teri, this is absolutely wonderful. You know, I had assumed that you had your own reasons for turning down the job on \"Oakdale Now,\" but I have to tell you, you would have been a knockout on television.",
        "Teri: You really think so?",
        "Kim: Oh, I know so. You have a wonderful presence, and your food is simply out of this world.",
        "Teri: Well, thank you. I'm glad Janet got to do it instead of me, though.",
        "Kim: Well, it's not every sister who would turn down a chance to be on television just to help her sister. So, I'm going to hope that eventually, in the future, we will have a chance to work together in some other way.",
        "Teri: Well, I hope so, too. Thank you for coming.",
        "Kim: Thank you. See you soon.",

        "Kim: Bye-bye.",
        "Teri: Hey, Jan.",
        "Janet: So the only reason I got this job is because you turned it down?",
        "Teri: Don't put it that way, Jan.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm so sorry that I don't know the right way to put it, because I didn't go to college.",
        "Teri: You got this job because you deserve it.",
        "Janet: They offered it to you first, right? Answer me, Theresa.",
        "Teri: What difference does it make?",
        "Janet: It makes a big difference. Who put you up to this, huh? Which one of you bozos made sure she turned down that job so her poor, pathetic, older sister could be the center of attention?",
        "Jack: Honey, no one thinks you're pathetic, and I think you're blowing this out of proportion.",
        "Brad: Kim never would have given you that job if she didn't think you could handle it.",
        "Jack: And you more than handled it.",
        "Janet: Wow. You all knew about this. Am I the only person who didn't know how I got this job?",
        "Jack: Honey, you got the job because you were meant to have it.",
        "Janet: If I was meant to have it, why did they offer it to Theresa first?",
        "Jack: What difference does it make? You're doing a great job, so let yourself do it, and stop beating yourself up.",
        "Janet: Oh. What happens if I mess up? Who's gonna prop me up? Who's gonna pick me up? Are you?",
        "Brad: It wasn't like that.",
        "Janet: Because God only knows pathetic Janet can't get a job that's worth anything without somebody bending over backwards to make sure she gets it.",
        "Teri: Jan, you know that's not true.",
        "Janet: Oh, you want to make me feel better, Theresa? Try not lying to me. Try having a little bit of respect for me.",
        "Teri: I do respect you. I love you.",
        "Janet: No. You love to look down on me.",
        "Teri: That's not true.",
        "Janet: You threw this job away. And if that's the only way I can get it, I don't want it.",

        "Riley: I really thought we were getting closer, that you were just starting to forgive me. What, was I blind or stupid?",
        "Casey: Neither. But you need to understand me. I am watching you. I hear you saying the right things, and who knows? You might even believe them.",
        "Riley: But you don't. What's it gonna take, Casey? A year of me on the straight and narrow? Two? 12? What's it gonna take before you can finally accept the fact that I am no longer that person I once was?",
        "Casey: I'm working on not hating you, and that's enough for me to handle right now. But if you get near Ali, all bets are off.",

        "Kim: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I was hoping that I could talk to you for a few minutes.",
        "Kim: What about?",
        "Alison: I want you to know that I thought really hard before coming to you about this, and Casey didn't think I should tell anyone at all. But I just felt the need that I should say something and that you would be the best person to talk to about this.",
        "Kim: Listen, Alison, I am really busy. Will you please just cut to the chase?",
        "Alison: Sure. Of course. You remember Casey's going-back-to-college party?",
        "Kim: Yes.",
        "Alison: Okay. You remember how Dr. Hughes said something strange to me, and you just said that that was his idea of a joke?",
        "Kim: Yeah. What about it?",
        "Alison: I don't think he was joking. I think there might be something going on with Dr. Hughes.",
        "Kim: I beg your pardon?",
        "Alison: I think there might be something wrong with him. The other day, he told me to give Riley Morgan the wrong dosage, and I wouldn't have said anything about it, but Riley almost died. And he doesn't even remember.",
        "Kim: I don't believe this. I don't believe this.",
        "Alison: I know it's hard to believe me, but it is true.",
        "Kim: I mean I really don't believe this. What has Bob ever done except try to help you?",
        "Alison: I am not -- I just thought you should know what happened and from my --",
        "Kim: I know about this. He told me all about it. He also told me that you were the one who made the mistake. And, as usual, you're trying to blame somebody else for it. But this time, kiddo, you picked the wrong scapegoat!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: I had a lot of reasons for turning down that job, Jan. It wasn't all about you.",

        "Teri: No, no! You love that job! You know you do!",
        "Janet: It's not mine. It's yours. In fact, I'm gonna call her right now before she starts editing.",
        "Jack: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Slow down, would you, please?",
        "Teri: Please don't do this.",
        "Janet: You know what? I may not have had all the advantages that you've had, but I still have my pride, and I am not gonna let you take that away from me. Give me my phone!",
        "Craig: I will in a minute. First, you need to hear the truth.",
        "Janet: I just did.",
        "Craig: No. You've heard part of it. You see, Teri here is not the evil mastermind of this whole thing. I am. So if you want to blame someone, blame me.",
        "Janet: How is this your fault?",
        "Craig: Well, it's true, Teri was offered the job first, but she didn't turn it down to help you. I mean, she's sweet, but nobody's that sweet.",
        "Janet: Then why'd she do it?",
        "Craig: Because I made her. She told me she'd been offered the TV job. I said, \"That's great, but it's also too bad, because I'm gonna hold you to your agreement to look after Carly's kids.\" I may have even threatened legal action. I don't really remember. The point is I didn't give her any choice but to turn down Kim's offer.",
        "Janet: But it was such a great opportunity for her. Why would you do that?",
        "Craig: Because I knew there was no way Jack would let his kids stay in their own house unless Teri was there to look after them.",
        "Janet: Is it true? You didn't turn down the job because of me?",
        "Craig: I just told you, she didn't have a choice. Frankly, I don't care who gets that TV job, as long as it's not Teri. The fact that you were offered it, that's just a happy coincidence. So do what you want. Take it. Don't take it. It makes no difference to me. Just don't turn it into a grudge against your sister.",

        "Bob: I'm fine. More to the point, how do you feel? Any difficulty breathing?",
        "Riley: No, not at all.",
        "Bob: I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.",
        "Riley: I'm feeling well enough to actually be on my own, as a matter of fact. I don't know if you heard, but I actually moved out of Tom and Margo's.",
        "Bob: No, I hadn't heard, but that's a very good idea. Nothing against you. I mean, you seem to be a perfectly good young man.",
        "Riley: But?",
        "Bob: I don't think your continuing to stay there was good for anyone, least of all Margo.",
        "Riley: You were going to say that she was using me as a substitute for Adam, weren't you?",
        "Bob: Yes, I think that's what she was trying to do.",
        "Riley: Well, first of all, she wasn't. But what if she was? I mean, is that such a crime?",
        "Bob: When Adam disappeared, he took a large part of Margo's heart with him, and then when she found out that he was dead, it just broke her in two. So, no matter how hard you tried, you could never fill that void. You could never be her son.",
        "Riley: Of course not. Adam is dead and buried.",
        "Bob: Exactly. Look, none of this is your fault, but I guess you didn't realize how dependent Margo was becoming on you. So, for whatever the reason, I you could never be her son.",
        "Riley: Of course not. Adam is dead and buried.",
        "Bob: Exactly. Look, none of this is your fault, but I guess you didn't realize how dependent Margo was becoming on you. So, for whatever the reason, I think it's good that you moved out. So, listen, if I can ever help you in any way, just give me a call.",

        "Janet: Okay. Well, I'm gonna go splash some water on my face.",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you all. You were great. I'm a little confused, but you were fantastic. I appreciate it.",
        "Craig: You know what? We like Janet. We don't want to see her get hurt. Funny thing happens when you're nice to people. Sometimes, they're nice back. You should try it sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: People have been telling me that you have changed, but you haven't really, have you? Because when you get into trouble, you're still trying to lie your way out of it.",
        "Alison: I am not lying. I thought I should tell you what happened. That is why I came here instead of going to the hospital board. I am sorry that I upset you.",
        "Kim: Just a minute. Just a minute. You mentioned that you \"spoke\" to Casey about this? Did you speak to anybody else? I mean, why would you consider letting the board shoot you down, when you can just tell your lies and then let everybody else do the dirty work for you?",
        "Alison: No. I am only trying to protect Dr. Hughes and the patients.",
        "Kim: Don't you dare! Don't you dare suggest that my husband is dangerous to his patients!",
        "Alison: No, I am only worried about Dr. Hughes! I'm just trying to help!",
        "Kim: Don't help us! My God, don't help us! You and your sister and your mother, stay out of this! You're always blaming! Always blaming! Not this time! Oh, God! Not this time! Not -- oh, God!",
        "Alison: Kim! Okay, I need an ambulance immediately at WOAK. A possible myocardial infarction, and please be prepared to defib, just in case. Okay, come on. Come on, Kim. Please. Please work with me, okay? Okay, please.",

        "Janet: Yeah, but you live here with a crazy person.",
        "Jack: No. Okay, but you're an adorable crazy person. And your reaction was completely justified, under the circumstances, honey.",
        "Janet: No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. Come on, now. And I promise you, I am not going to be as high maintenance ever again, okay? After all, I have a TV show that's counting on me.",
        "Jack: Oh, yes, and you're gonna need a manager, you know, someone who's ready, willing and able to handle a crazy person.",
        "Janet: And would this manager be able to quit his job as a cop?",
        "Jack: Sure, for 15%.",
