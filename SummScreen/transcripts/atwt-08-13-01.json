        "Molly: This is Molly Conlan reporting to you live from the Oakdale \r\ncourthouse. The hot topic on this hot August day is whether the testimony of \r\nCarly Tenney will exonerate the prominent businessman, Craig \r\nMontgomery, who is on trial for the attempted murder of his wife, \r\ninternationally renowned clothing designer Barbara Ryan. Ms. Griffin? Ms.\r\nGriffin, you surprised us all yesterday.",
