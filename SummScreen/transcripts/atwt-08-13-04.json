        "Dusty decides not to press the case against Craig as Sierra realizes that she'd just given Craig two million dollars just before Lucy's second kidnapping. Sierra goes to Dusty, but he initially refuses. Sierra gives him her number and tells him to call her when he changes his mind. Aaron tells Chris that he saw him and Emily together, Chris threatening Aaron to stay away from Allison. Aaron tells Allison he can't go to her wedding, but she talks him into going and into finding the last key. Emily tells Chris that their kiss was just working out old feelings and that there isn't anything between them. He declines looking for the key with her, but changes his mind at the last minute. James makes it back to Oakdale and creeps into Fairwinds. When Jordan, Jennifer, Paul and Roseanna decide to go to the fair, he follows them. He's in the background when Paul asks Roseanna to marry him and she accepts, stealing one of the balloons that Paul had bought and giving it to another kid playing a game. As Paul is taking pictures of Roseanna and Cabot riding the carousel, Jordan runs to him and tells him that James has escaped. When the carousel comes back around, Roseanna and Cabot are missing."

        "Emily: Alison, you want to deliver all of these wedding invitations by hand? I think Mom might have budgeted for postage sweetie.",
        "Alison: I like the idea of handing my friends their invitations in person.",
        "Emily: Well, that's very nice. But don't you have enough to do, you know, planning the wedding, working two jobs?",
        "Alison: Well it's not everybody, just my special friends.",
        "Emily: How many is that? Like, two?",
        "Alison: Chris! Hey! Look, all of the invitations are addressed!",
        "Chris: Yeah -- I see.",
        "Alison: This is so great! Why don't we have lunch together? Aaron, why don't you come and join us? Hey, you're not getting off that easy. Okay, I hereby officially invite you to the wedding of Alison Stewart and Christopher Hughes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, I can pretend I didn't hear what you just said.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not taking it back.",
        "Paul: Okay. Even if things get thorny?",
        "Rosanna: I didn't say it because I'm feeling giddy or --",
        "Paul: Right. I'm not sure my ego can handle this kind of --.",
        "Rosanna: Your ego will be just fine, as will every other part of you. Look, I guess what I'm saying is, I didn't expect to feel this way. I wasn't even sure I wanted to. But I can't help it. I love you.",
        "Paul: I never expected to feel this way again, either.",
        "Rosanna: I guess we're hopeless.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I guess. Pretty much. You've seen me at my worst.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. You've given me your best. I put up a valiant fight, I might add. But you won.",

        "Mahalia: Oakdale, 17 miles. Not much farther now. You sure my music doesn't bother you?",
        "James: Gospel music? No, I love gospel music. I bet that's where you got your name from, the great Mahalia.",
        "Mahalia: Mm, you do know your music.",
        "James: Yeah. Reminds me of on the road in my tent. My revival days.",
        "Mahalia: I thought you had that preacher look about you. You got fire in your eyes.",
        "James: Mahalia, you sure know how to flatter a fellow.",
        "Mahalia: I bet you had a good following.",
        "James: Some folks thought I worked miracles.",
        "Mahalia: Well, you were a Godsend to me. Offering to drive all the way back. Shoot. My bunions started killing me halfway up from Kentucky.",
        "James: Well my pleasure. It was so kind of you to pick me up.",
        "Mahalia: You make good time. Seems like you stay just under the radar.",
        "James: My specialty. So what are you going to do when you get where you're going?",
        "Mahalia: I got a brand new grandbaby. I'm gonna hug him tight.",
        "James: I just got a new grandson too. Hey, you know, Mahalia, you just got to love your family.",
        "Mahalia: Um-hum. You can say that again. Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come",

        "Lucy: I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me. Come on. Just go get some rest and let me talk to Dusty.",
        "Craig: What, so he can fill your head about stuff about me having you buried alive?",

        "Craig: Okay, listen, sweetness. He is no good for you.",
        "Lucy: I don't believe that. And I really don't think it's for you to say. And right now, I want him to stay. And it's not up for discussion.",
        "Dusty: He really counts on you to stand by him.",
        "Lucy: I know.",
        "Dusty: He's also counting on you to turn your back on me.",
        "Lucy: Well, then he'll be counting a long time, because that's not going to happen.",

        "Sierra: \"The chance to make you happy, to give you even a fraction of what you give me. Today I have the chance to give you back what you love most.\" Don't you see? Alan was vowing to bring Lucy back! This letter is not from a man who was trying to kidnap Lucy! This is a man who loved me. He couldn't have done it. Somebody had to of set him up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: This is the real Alan Drake! Use it as proof that he couldn't possibly be behind this.",
        "Nikki: I can't imagine how horrible it is to have someone you love be accused of such a heinous act. But this letter, it's not really proof of anything.",
        "Sierra: Why not? It's written in his own hand, his own voice. Why should this count for anything less than your other so-called evidence?",
        "Nikki: That's not proof of his innocence. Did your husband withdraw any large sums of money recently?",
        "Sierra: No.",
        "Nikki: Are you sure? I'd like to have access to his bank records.",
        "Sierra: All right. That's it! That's it, get out! Everybody just get out!",
        "Lily: Nikki's just doing her job.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: This thing with your father, I can't let it go. When you say it doesn't hurt you, but when I get into it, it's gonna hurt. It's better for both of us if I walk away now.",
        "Lucy: Just like that?",
        "Dusty: Just like that. You got to let me walk away.",
        "Lucy: I can't. You mean too much to me. Can't you just let it go? The danger, it's over now. We can think about -- we can think now, about us. If you just let it go.",
        "Dusty: I can't. But I can't let you go either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Okay, my friend, this is where I depart.",
        "Mahalia: Fancy place. Looks like a castle. How come you don't go on through the gate?",
        "James: Well you see, this is my family, and we like to surprise each other. Sure did enjoy our singing. Are you gonna be all right from here?",
        "Mahalia: Oh, sure. Don't pay me any more mind. I'm gonna pray for you. Pray you have a good time with your family.",
        "James: Thank you. I'm sure I will. Oh, Mahalia.",
        "Mahalia: Yes?",
        "James: You know, you should be careful. You shouldn't be in the habit of picking up strangers.",
        "Mahalia: I don't bother 'bout things like that -- I got divine protection.",
        "James: Yeah, I'm sure you do. But you know, there are a lot of unsavory kind of characters out here on the road. Maybe, just ready to pounce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Don't stop on our account.",
        "Jordan: Hell, no. Not especially since we have a green light right here. We are annulled!",
        "Rosanna: What? You were in the courtroom? You heard it with your own ears?",
        "Jordan: It's 100% official. We are not married anymore.",
        "Rosanna: It's over! It's really over!",
        "Paul: I get some drinks. Champagne, anyone? Everyone?",
        "Jordan: Sounds great to me.",
        "[Cabot crying]",
        "Rosanna: That's Cabot. I'll get him.",
        "Jordan: No, why don't you let me go up and get him?",
        "Rosanna: Are you sure? No it's okay. [Crying stops] That's weird, maybe Paul got him. You know, I'm just gonna go and check.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, now that we've gotten this arranged marriage behind us, I just want to make sure that things are clear between us. I still plan on being hands-on with Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, look those papers don't change the fact that you're the father. I hope you know that I would never, ever deny you that right.",
        "Jordan: You are Cabot's only mother. And I want you to know that I would never interfere with that.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much Jordan.",
        "Jordan: You have done a wonderful job with him, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. I can't tell you how much it means to me to hear you say that. I mean, maybe now you guys can get back on track. I'm so sorry I've been such an obstacle in your life.",
        "Paul: Grab some glasses, would you?",
        "Rosanna: What's going on? You didn't bring Cabot down?",
        "Paul: No, I can if you want me to -- I didn't go into Cabot's room. 'Cause, you know, the refrigerator's in the kitchen.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me, I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Wow. The real thing.",
        "Alison: Yep. Well, come have lunch with Chris and Emily and me, we can celebrate.",
        "Aaron: No, I can't, I can't I just came here to pick up a paycheck. I have no time to hang out. I'm so sorry.",
        "Alison: You're not mad at me, are you?",
        "Aaron: No, no.",
        "Alison: Because I really didn't mean to come down so hard on you. It's just that --",
        "Aaron: No, Ali! It's not that. It's not you. It's not you at all, okay?",
        "Alison: Well, then what is it? Because you look like you just lost a friend.",
        "Aaron: I did. Holden. His cousin, Jack -- he's dead.",
        "Alison: Jack Snyder? What? How?",
        "Aaron: It was an accident. And his car went over the bridge on Route 17, I think, I'm not sure.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, they can't find his body. And everybody's a wreck. Holden's wrecked.",
        "Alison: Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Maybe Chris and I could do --",
        "Aaron: No, no. My family hasn't announced this to anybody. So just keep this on the dial, okay? Especially to Chris. Don't tell anybody.",
        "Alison: Okay, okay. Whatever, whatever. But you still shouldn't be alone. Maybe -- come and eat with us. It'll make you feel better. And you and Chris could chill out and get more comfortable with each other --",
        "Emily: Hey listen. I gotta take off.",
        "Alison: You're not gonna stay?",
        "Emily: No, no I can't. I figured, Chris is here so -- you two could use some time alone.",
        "Alison: Well, Aaron was just going to join us.",
        "Emily: No, you know what? I got a lot to do. Matron of honor's work is never done. Right? I'll call you later. Bye, Aaron. Bye, Chris.",
        "Alison: Emily couldn't stay, but the three of us can still have lunch, right?",
        "Aaron: I got to go.",
        "Chris: You two looked pretty serious over here. What's going on?",
        "Alison: Nothing, Aaron's just got a lot of stuff on his mind. There's the latest edition to the City Times! And maybe there's a new clue in there. Oh, Chris, I'm going to go pick up a copy. Okay? Will you order me a grilled cheese?",
        "Chris: Alison --",
        "Alison: I'll be right back.",
        "Chris: Hey Aaron, do you think I could get a waiter over here?",
        "Aaron: A waiter? Yeah, I'm not really on, right now. But someone will be by to get your order in a minute, okay?",
        "Chris: You know what, you've been giving me looks since I got here. You got a problem with me?",
        "Aaron: You know what, Chris? As a matter of fact, I do. I saw you yesterday with Emily at Old Town. Oh, yeah, brother, I saw everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I want you to be able to count on me. We're still friends. Aren't we?",
        "Sierra: You know, I don't need a friend who thinks that Alan could have been behind this kidnapping. He couldn't have done it.",
        "Craig: Well something must have been driving him that no one knew. Not even you.",
        "Sierra: Tell me, tell me everything that went on in that bell tower.",
        "Craig: You don't want to dredge all of that up again, do you?",
        "Sierra: You say you're my friend? Then tell me the truth.",
        "Craig: You sure?",
        "Sierra: Please, I need to hear everything.",
        "Craig: When I got there, Alan and Wade were having an argument.",
        "Sierra: An argument over what?",
        "Craig: Sierra, it doesn't feel right.",
        "Sierra: No. What were they fighting about?",
        "Craig: They were fighting about splitting the ransom money. Now I know you -- sure you loved him. But there are some questions you're going to have to ask yourself about Alan. Some tough questions.",
        "Sierra: He was a good man.",
        "Craig: Why did that good man have a gun? Why did he insist on delivering the ransom alone?",
        "Sierra: Cause that was the instructions.",
        "Craig: Whose instructions, Sierra?",
        "Sierra: But that letter he wrote. It was a love letter. There wasn't --",
        "Craig: I'm not saying he didn't believe he loves you. But I think he believed you were his salvation. And maybe that was the part of it you didn't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: First you say you want to get out of my life. Then you say the exact opposite. I don't understand.",
        "Dusty: I gotta walk away. When I thought I'd lost you, I felt like I lost everything. And then I saw you, and I was back. So I don't know if I can walk away. I feel like I might not be able to take not seeing your eyes again or something.",
        "Lucy: Then stay.",
        "Dusty: I can't. You've got such important plans. You think I'm going to mess that up? I can't. That's how I feel right now. Just right now.",
        "Lucy: That is all we have. Right now. I nearly died in that box. And before I passed out, I prayed, I promised that if I ever got out, I wouldn't take a single moment for granted.",
        "Dusty: I know the feeling.",
        "Lucy: When you found me, it was like I was given another chance to make the most of right now. And right now all I want is to be with you.",
        "Dusty: I'm such a bum, Lucy. I can't.",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. You're a hero. You're my hero.",
        "Dusty: I wish -- but it's not true.",
        "Lucy: I owe you my life.",
        "Dusty: You feel gratitude and that's it.",
        "Lucy: Does this feel like gratitude?",
        "Dusty: Wait a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Here's our big guy. Mommy got worried, didn't she? Sorry, everybody I didn't mean to overreact.",
        "Jordan: Well, why did he get so quiet?",
        "Rosanna: He was watching that little toy carousel that Jennifer gave him.",
        "Jennifer: Oh well, I'm glad he likes it so much.",
        "Rosanna: He loves it. He loves carousels. Just like his mommy, huh?",
        "Jennifer: Maybe we should go. There's a big fair over at Luther's Corners, you know.",
        "Rosanna: Wow, would you like that, honey? Ride on a pretty horse and listen to the music? And go up and down. And up and down.",
        "Paul: Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I could have sworn I saw somebody out there.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, there's nobody there.",
        "Rosanna: Sorry, sorry. I'm being jumpy for no reason. I'm sorry.",
        "Jordan: We're all on edge. Maybe a carnival is just the thing we need.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, that's a great idea. Why don't we go? Cabot would love that. Wouldn't you, sweetheart? Distract us all from our worries.",
        "Paul: All right. Let's go. Can't take my car, it only seats two.",
        "Rosanna: Somebody take my car. Grab the phone. Okay? Thank you.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns --",
        "Aaron: I know exactly what I saw. I'm not going to let you hurt Alison anymore.",

        "Jordan: He's on top of the world.",
        "Rosanna: Look at all the lights.",
        "Jennifer: Look! Oh, oh, I love that game! Let's play!",
        "Jordan: You want to shoot water into a clown's mouth?!",
        "Jennifer: For one of those big stuffed bears, I do!",
        "Jordan: You're on.",
        "Paul: Are you happy?",
        "Rosanna: Beyond happy. For the first time in months I feel like I don't have look over my shoulder. I can just relax. I know that I've been saying that I feel like we're free but -- right now, I really feel it.",
        "Paul: It looks beautiful on you.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. It's exhilarating. Like I could shout. Out to the everybody, you know?",
        "Paul: I dare you. Go ahead.",
        "Rosanna: I am deliriously happy!",
        "Paul: All right. Not bad. I bet I could do better, but that's not bad.",
        "Rosanna: Oh yeah? You could do better? Let's see. Show me.",
        "Paul: Here, Cabot. You watch your mom for a minute. How much for the balloons?",
        "Balloon man: Two for five bucks. All to charity.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah? I'll take them all.",
        "Balloon man: Thanks, mister.",
        "Rosanna: You are pretty impulsive.",
        "Paul: Yeah, sometimes. I'm not done. I love you. Will you marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: And what exactly do you think you saw?",
        "Aaron: I saw a man who's supposed to marry my best friend, but for some odd reason, he's messing around with her sister.",
        "Chris: Well, maybe you're confused.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, Chris, maybe you didn't expect to get caught, either. How could you do that? How can you say you love Alison and then go off and cheat on her?",
        "Chris: Look, I love her, and I'm gonna marry her, okay?",
        "Aaron: Why? Why, so you can ruin her life even more? All you do is bring her grief and make her feel bad about herself. You know what? You don't even deserve her, brother. You don't deserve her, and she sure as heck doesn't deserve the way you treat her.",
        "Chris: Yeah? And how does she deserve, Aaron? You?",
        "Aaron: I am her best friend. Okay, I care about her!",
        "Chris: Yeah, maybe a little too much.",
        "Aaron: What the hell's that supposed to mean?",
        "Chris: That means you're jealous of me because you want her for yourself. And that's why you're trying to blow things for us now.",
        "Aaron: Oh, I don't need to blow things for you guys. You're doing a pretty good job by yourself.",
        "Chris: You know what? Alison and I are fine. And we're gonna stay fine as long as you stay out of our business.",
        "Aaron: That's great. Deny it all you want, brother, but I know exactly what I saw. I'm not gonna let you hurt Alison anymore. You better know this -- I'm watching you.",
        "Alison: Hey, Aaron! Look, there's another clue! [Pager beeps] What's going on?",
        "Chris: Nothing, nothing, Alison. I just got paged.",
        "Alison: Oh, I forgot you're on call.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Look, I've got a tonsillectomy coming out of the O.R. He's only nine, I promised him I'd be there when he wakes up.",
        "Alison: So, you can't come and do lunch with you either?",
        "Chris: No, I'm gonna have to take a rain check. Sorry. I'll call later. Bye.",
        "Alison: Okay, now that it's just the two of us, you can't desert me. So, come on. Let's -- we'll eat and we'll look at the clue.",
        "Aaron: No, Ali, I --",
        "Alison: No, come on. And we need to talk, and not just about the clue. I wanna know why you and Chris -- why can't you just be friends?",
        "Aaron: I can't really explain that.",
        "Alison: I keep hoping that you'll find something in common. Why didn't you open up your invitation?",
        "Aaron: I was gonna open it at home.",
        "Alison: No, no. Do it now. Emily and my mom thought I was crazy because I wanted to hand them to everyone and watch them open it. But --",
        "Aaron: Alison, I -- you should just give this to somebody else.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry -- I don't think I'm gonna make it to your wedding.",

        "Nikki: She's -- she's a little upset. I think your dad's with her right now.",

        "Craig: Yeah, I know. Look, here. Listen, I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? After all the times you've taken care of me, all the jams you've gotten me out of. Come on.",
