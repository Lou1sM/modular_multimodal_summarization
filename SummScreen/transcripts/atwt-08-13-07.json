        "Gwen: You fooled me. You had me convinced that you picked that name out right then. This was an ambush.",

        "Sofie: So, where are you?",
        "Cole: In Old Town, in front of a bookstore. What's up?",
        "Sofie: We need to talk. I can meet you after my shift. I can bring some food from the kitchen here, and we can have a sort of nighttime picnic. Are you still there?",
        "Cole: I was planning on having a couple more hours to get some work done.",
        "Sofie: I know, but this is important. We need to get some things ironed out.",

        "Silas: I gave you my word, didn't I?",
        "Kit: Yeah, like that's worth anything.",

        "Carly: What are we gonna do?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure. I'm working on it.",
        "Carly: Did you see J.J.'s face? I'm not sure I've ever seen him so scared.",
        "Jack: Carly, we can't think about that right now. We just gotta focus on getting out of these cuffs. Now, we need to put our heads together and think of something. Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah?",

        "Carly: Well, I'm trying. I just can't think of anything right now.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, you think you can use it to pick the lock?",

        "Silas: Come on, Kit. I'll pay you for it.",
        "Kit: Did I say I had something for sale?",
        "Silas: No, but we need somewhere else to go. I figured I'd buy your trailer off of you.",
        "Kit: I'm not selling you squat.",
        "Silas: Fine, then we'll rent it. That way, you can have it back when we're done.",
        "Kit: You think I'm crazy enough to let you stay somewhere the cops can trace back to me?",
        "Ava: Please, Kit. We got no other choice.",
        "Silas: We'd do the same thing for you if the shoe were on the other foot. I did a lot of favors for you years ago, or did you seem to forget that already?",
        "Kit: I know an abandoned building off Route 7. You can stay there.",
        "Silas: Thanks, Kit.",
        "Kit: Here's the address, but if the cops catch you, I ain't never seen you before in my life.",

        "Will: Hey, can you hand me the bowl with the crack -- never mind.",
        "Gwen: I don't know what happened. First I couldn't keep anything down, now I can't get enough.",
        "Will: If you eat like this through the whole pregnancy, I'm gonna have to get a second job to keep you in cheese balls and crackers.",
        "Gwen: Well, come on, you know what they say-- I'm eating for two! Do we have any ice cream in the freezer? I want to make a milkshake.",
        "Will: Are you sure you're not packing twins in there?",
        "Gwen: I need a milkshake. If I don't get a milkshake in the next five minutes, I'm gonna eat -- I'm gonna eat you!",
        "Will: Okay, I guess I better get you to Al's, you and Murgatroid.",

        "Will: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You never answered my question.",
        "Sofie: That was a question? When you said, \"Boyfriend problems,\" it sounded like we were in middle school or something.",
        "Aaron: In other words, mind my own business?",
        "Sofie: I didn't mean it like that. Sorry. You were just being a friend.",
        "Aaron: No, I'm not being a great friend right now.",
        "Sofie: No, you are. I'm too sensitive. Cole tells me that all the time. Matter of fact, I could use a friend right now.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, me, too. Listen, I don't want to be rude, but I couldn't help hearing your end of the conversation. Cole can't meet you out for dinner because he's doing what?",
        "Sofie: He's frustrated. Creative. Impatient. Ambitious.",
        "Aaron: What's he do?",
        "Sofie: He's a songwriter.",
        "Aaron: Is there, like, a big demand for that out here? No, I'm serious. I really don't know.",
        "Sofie: Well if you have a computer, it doesn't matter where you live, you can send your stuff to anyone. But of course, he can't afford to compose full- time, so he's working this grunt job at this gas station. It's making him crazy. I guess it sounds like everybody's story, right?",
        "Aaron: It can be pretty tough waiting for that big break.",
        "Sofie: The thing is, he's really good, so I know his chance is coming. But anyway, that's the only reason he's been so edgy lately. What?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "Sofie: He's a good person. He's just under a lot of pressure.",
        "Aaron: So whatever. I don't know him. You do. So if you don't have a problem with him --",
        "Sofie: I know -- I know it might seem on the outside like he's not treating me right, but -- but when we're alone, and we have a chance to talk everything out -- we really understand each other.",
        "Aaron: Cool.",

        "Katie: I told you to quit while you were ahead.",
        "Brad: I was never ahead.",
        "Katie: Oh, true.",
        "Brad: Are you sure you don't want any?",
        "Katie: No, I'm sure. I think that stuff's probably the reason I took all your money and your wardrobe.",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Katie: No?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I think you should slow down, too.",
        "Brad: No, no, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? Come on, we're just getting started. I'm having fun. Didn't you say you were having fun?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm having fun. But there's just only so much excitement one person can take.",
        "Brad: You see -- you see -- Katie, little Katie cat. Little Katie, you're wrong. You're wrong. See, you know, I think I'm just prepared to up the ante. Just a bit.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, how are we going to do that?",
        "Brad: I'm gonna throw in my boxers. Or are these briefs?",
        "Katie: No, no, no. No, Brad, seriously, no! No, no, no, I'm done, okay? I'm not going to let you bet your shorts or anything else.",
        "Brad: You're a spoilsport. You are. You're a spoilsport. You know, it is bad form to drop out of the game when you don't give your chance -- your opponent the chance to win back his clothes.",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Katie: Oh -- yeah. Wait until your brother hears about this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Now, I'm going to try to drop this pin on the floor near your hand. Can you get it?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'll try.",
        "Jack: Ready?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: It's right there. It's right here. Over. Come on, keep coming. Can you get it? You got it. You got it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I got it.",
        "Jack: Can you -- can you give it to me? Oh, that's it. Okay, thank you. Put our hands together. Put our hands together. Ow!",
        "Silas: Well, what are you two lovebirds up to, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Waitress picks up the ultrasound picture of the baby]",
        "Waitress: I can see the family resemblance. I'll be right back with your drinks.",
        "Gwen: You know, she's right. It's definitely a Munson.",
        "Will: Yeah, how can you tell?",
        "Gwen: Well, look at the head. It's practically as big as yours.",
        "Will: Well, all babies have big heads. But look at that! What do you think that is?",
        "Gwen: That could just be a big toe!",
        "Will: That is not a big toe. That is definitely something else. Look at the size of that.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not -- you can't tell those kind of things yet, and besides --",
        "Iris: My baby girl and her hubby. What a wonderful surprise!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Cole said he'd wait for me in Old Town. I hope he's still there. And I really hope he's in a better mood.",
        "Aaron: Well, that ought to help.",
        "Sofie: I hope so. We never eat like this at home.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I saw you putting some pretty good stuff in there. Lakeview steak -- pretty tasty, huh?",
        "Sofie: I hope it works on Cole. Can you tell me the easiest way to get to Old Town from here?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, just, when you get out of the lot, go straight, Lakeview Road. You're gonna hit the pier, and then -- you know, it'll probably be easier if I just show you.",
        "Sofie: No, Aaron, you don't have to do that.",
        "Aaron: No, I'm heading that way, anyway. It'll be fine. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You have us -- you have us locked in a pretty awkward position, Silas. We were just trying to get comfortable.",
        "Silas: I'll have room service bring you a pillow.",
        "Carly: How's J.J.?",
        "Silas: He's none of your business.",
        "Carly: He's our son. We're worried about him.",
        "Silas: He's not your kid anymore. He's mine.",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Silas: Les Sweeney was the boy's father. Some people still respect that. You think you're the only one with family values, Mr. Oakdale Detective?",
        "Jack: Why don't you tell us what you mean by that, Silas?",
        "Silas: You think Les Sweeney didn't care about the boy? Well, he did. Les bled for that kid. Les Sweeney was my friend. He saved my life when two cons tried to gut me. So in return, I plan on doing right by the boy!",
        "Jack: How? By holding him prisoner?",
        "Silas: I plan on raising him for my own. I plan on raising him the way Les would have, had he had the chance!",
        "Jack: He had the chance, until the mother had to get an order of protection. Maybe you didn't know that.",
        "Silas: Shut up! Les was a good guy, and you killed him!",
        "Jack: So this is -- what, revenge?",
        "Silas: You mean you're not as dumb as you look? It's payback time, Jack-O.",
        "Carly: Silas! Think about this. You're in enough trouble already. You're just going to make it worse. Please, just give us J.J., let us go!",
        "Jack: Silas, listen to me. I know what it's like to lose a friend. I lost my own best friend not too long ago. When that happened, I just wanted to stick it to the people who robbed me of the person, the one guy who always had my back. So I understand that you're angry. I understand that you're mad at me. But don't make J.J. suffer for something he had nothing to do with.",
        "Silas: Are you saying if the boy stays with me, he would suffer? You think I can't be a father like anybody else?",
        "Jack: All I'm saying is that if Les and I had a problem, and you're on Les' side, then let's work it out, you and me. Let the boy go home with his mother --",
        "Silas: Shut up! I'm raising him for myself, and that's all there is to it!",
        "Carly: We're never gonna let that happen.",
        "Silas: Well, you're not gonna be around to do anything about it.",
        "Carly: Silas! Silas!",
        "Jack: Silas, Silas! Hey! Stop! We can work this out, Silas!",

        "Jack: Carly. Look, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack!",
        "Jack: Carly, I need you to calm down. Let me have the pin, okay? We just gotta get out of these cuffs. Okay.",
        "Carly: Hurry up!",
        "Jack: We need to put our hands together. Okay, calm down. Carly, you're breathing in too much smoke. You're breathing in too much smoke. Shallow breaths, all right? All right, I'm in. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.",

        "Gwen: You know what I'm talking about. What are you doing back in town?",
        "Will: Yeah, weren't you on vacation in Miami or on some kind of booze cruise to Greece?",
        "Iris: Both. But you know, I am so touched that you both remembered that. But maybe I was just a little lonely to see my Gwennie, or maybe I was just tired of living the high life, you know?",
        "Gwen: So you cut your vacation short so you could come back and ruin my life? It's nice, I appreciate it, Mom.",

        "Iris: No, my part of the deal was that I wasn't going to go to the cops and tell them what you did to his brother, Adam.",
        "Will: Iris, you said you'd leave us alone!",
        "Iris: Sweetheart, it's a free country, and I am exactly where I want to be. And now that I know I'm gonna be a grandma --",
        "Gwen: You are not staying here.",
        "Iris: Do you two realize that I was the only one on that luxury cruise liner who didn't have pictures of their grandkids to flash around? Frankly, I felt left out. Not that anyone would look at me and think I was a grandma or anything.",
        "Will: Who would after they smelled the booze on your breath?",
        "Iris: But you know, it's all gonna be worth it. I hear it's a perfect set-up. You can spoil the kid rotten, and then you just give it back at the end of the day.",
        "Gwen: You're not giving the baby back at the end of the day because you're not getting your hands on it, period.",
        "Iris: Don't be silly.",
        "Gwen: I'm not being silly. I'm being serious. I have no idea what you imagined your role in this child's life would be, but you're not getting anywhere near that baby.",
        "Iris: Gwennie, shh! They say that the baby can hear things, even inside the womb. Is that the kind of talk that you want your baby to absorb?",
        "Gwen: Oh, Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, baby, hey. You hear that other woman's voice? Whatever you do, stay away from her. She's toxic. Now, could you please leave us alone?",
        "Iris: Oh Honey, that's just your hormonal imbalance that's making you talk like that.",
        "Gwen: No, Mom, it's you. You're a horrible mom. You're gonna make a really horrible grandma.",
        "Iris: You don't know that.",
        "Will: You know what, Iris, you're right. It is a free country, and we can't kick you out of here, but we can damn well keep you away from our child.",
        "Gwen: So, if you could just leave, please, 'cause I'd really like to eat my food before it gets cold.",
        "Iris: It's a shame you two are so selfish that you're gonna deprive your child of the blessing of knowing his grandma, but that's the way you want it?",
        "Gwen: It's what we want, yeah.",
        "Iris: Okay, fine. It's your loss.",

        "Sofie: He gets wrapped up and loses track of time sometimes. Maybe he went to find a less noisy spot.",

        "Aaron: I don't know him.",
        "Sofie: I mean of me and Cole, and our relationship.",
        "Aaron: Listen, I'm the last person who should be judging any relationship, especially after what I went through with my last girlfriend.",
        "Sofie: See, that's what I don't understand about some girls. Here's a guy like you. Nice and caring, and pretty much what every girl says they want in a guy, and she leaves you. I just don't get that.",
        "Aaron: Who said anything about her leaving me?",
        "Sofie: You broke it off?",

        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Aaron: Good to see you. Well, I'm gonna get going. You got yourself something good there. Sofie made off with some of the best stuff on the menu, so enjoy. I'll see you guys -- I'll see you.",

        "Katie: No, no, no. No! You have had way too much.",
        "Brad: Who are you to tell me that I can't drown my sorrows? All right, take it, fine. Take it all. I don't care. Take my shirt. Take my pants. Take my broken heart. You know, all of it.",
        "Katie: Brad, I just think the best thing for you right now is just to go to sleep and --",
        "Katie: Jack, it's me. I'm at the farm with your brother, and I was just thinking about you and missing you. I hope everything's okay. I hope you found J.J. that everything's good. I can hear you telling me not to worry right now, but I can't help it. I just do. I know you're with Carly, and she tends to mess things up like this whole ransom thing. I'm not gonna try to think that way, though, because I know you, and I know you have everything under control. I love you. I love you so much, so please, please just call me as soon as you get a chance, okay? Bye.",

        "Carly: Help him. He passed out from the smoke. And he's injured, you have to get him to a hospital. I'm afraid he's bleeding internally or something. Please!",
        "EMT: We can take over from here, Ma'am.",
        "Scott Deas: Excuse me, miss. FBI, Scott Deas. I'm Jack's contact inside the bureau.",
        "Carly: I'm Carly Snyd -- Tenney. Carly Tenney. I'm glad you're here. Silas Jenkins, he has our son. He handcuffed us inside the cabin and set the place on fire. Jack was able to free us, but he couldn't hold on. How did you find us?",
        "Scott: We stationed ourselves nearby after Jack called in last on you until we saw the explosion.",

        "Gwen: You know, being pregnant, it's usually something that you want to share with your mom.",
        "Will: Well, you always have -- Barbara.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess. You know, when I was pregnant before? I just used to wish that I had somebody that I could talk to, you know, somebody who had been through it all. I remember imagining that I had a mom who would take care of me when I was sick and tell me that everything was going to be okay. I don't know, I wanted a mom. I just didn't want my mom. But then again, I didn't really want to have a kid, either, so not having her around, she wasn't that bad.",
        "Will: And this time?",
        "Gwen: I'd do anything to have a mom around. You know, somebody I could go to. She could tell me what it was like when she was pregnant with me, and the kind of foods that she craved, and the crazy things that her hormones made her do. I don't know, just stories. Then I remember that those stories come along with Iris, and I don't know. I don't know. I honestly can't even imagine my mom being pregnant. It just makes me sad. Why'd she have to come back?",
        "Will: I think in her own insane way, she loves you.",
        "Gwen: A really, really messed up way of showing it.",

        "Sofie: Really, I'm not. I promise. I just thought, you know, a little break couldn't hurt you. And I figured if I made a picnic for us, and we ate together, we could maybe, I don't know. Connect again.",
        "Cole: It's all about you, isn't it? What you don't get. What you need. How are we supposed to connect when you can't even see who I am?",
