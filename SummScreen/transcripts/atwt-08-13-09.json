        "Meg: I can't believe how warm it is.",
        "Damian: It reminds me of summers in Italy. My folks used to send me to a camp there on the Adriatic coast.",
        "Meg: Why is it when you say \"Adriatic coast,\" it makes me want to buy a ticket immediately?",
        "Damian: Will you let me take you there someday?",
        "Meg: Uh, yeah, of course. Sign me up. You know, in the meantime, we could go down to the pond and cool off.",
        "Damian: I didn't bring my bathing suit with me.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's okay. I wasn't planning on wearing mine.",
        "Damian: Sweet. And yet naughty.",
        "Meg: Ah, you bring out the best in me. Faith. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Faith: Obviously.",
        "Meg: I'm gonna take Eliza upstairs, get her changed. Think about that swim.",
        "Damian: Hey.",
        "Faith: So, is my Aunt Meg your girlfriend, or is there someone else you like more?",

        "Lily: Traffic bad?",
        "Holden: No. I was just missing you and the kids.",
        "Lily: Oh, well, if it makes you feel any better, we miss you, too.",
        "Holden: So, have you guys made any decisions yet? Are you gonna come down to Kentucky and see me?",
        "Lily: I guess it depends on Faith. She's still in the death grip of some adolescent funk. I don't know what she wants to do.",
        "Holden: Is she there? Let me talk to her.",
        "Lily: No. I think she went out to the farm to go for a ride.",

        "Tom: Yeah, well, I just wanted you to know that brunch sometimes can have something more than just a bowl of cold cereal.",
        "Margo: So they say. Coffee?",
        "Tom: Yeah, it's already made. Right behind me.",
        "Margo: Good. You know, um, you don't have to do all of this for me.",

        "Margo: All right. Well, there you go. There's your answer.",
        "Tom: You know, eventually, you're gonna have to stop being mad at me because I asked Riley to move out of the house.",
        "Margo: Yep, if you say so.",
        "Tom: I was just trying to do what is best here.",
        "Margo: No, you know what you were doing. You asked Riley to leave the house without talking to me first because you knew if you asked me, that I would object. Ah-ha! There. How do you think that makes me feel?",
        "Tom: I'd like to know how it makes you feel.",
        "Margo: Oh, Tom, come on.",
        "Tom: Well, that's part of the problem here. I just -- I don't know anymore.",
        "Margo: Okay. I will tell you how I feel. I don't like it when you make unilateral decisions about me, okay? How's that?",

        "Riley: It happens.",

        "Casey: Tell me this wasn't about my granddad.",
        "Alison: Casey, I had to tell her. I had to tell her about the mistake he made, ordering that overdose.",
        "Casey: But you said you weren't 100% sure he made that mistake. And -- and what were you expecting Kim to do?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Casey: So wait, you're telling me you went there, and you accused my granddad of -- of screwing up?",
        "Alison: And then your grandmother had a heart attack. Oh, God, Casey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Bob: Kim, Sweetheart, you're gonna be all right. Nothing's gonna happen to you. I'm here.",

        "Lily: Me, too.",
        "Holden: It would be nice to have some good, old-fashioned family time. Seems like forever since we've done that.",

        "Casey: I want to know what you told Kim.",
        "Alison: I just told her what I told you, Casey.",
        "Casey: Oh, my God. That -- that he ordered the overdose?",
        "Alison: I didn't lie to her.",
        "Casey: How can you say that?",
        "Alison: Because I believe that is what happened.",
        "Casey: But he told you he didn't do it.",
        "Alison: I know, and that's why he blames me for it.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine, fine. You told her that, and then -- and then what happened?",
        "Alison: She got upset with me -- really upset -- and she said that it was impossible, that Bob would never make a mistake like that.",
        "Casey: Exactly. Why couldn't you have just waited?",
        "Alison: Because what if it were to happen again to another patient? I would feel responsible.",
        "Casey: You're not responsible for every patient in this hospital, Ali.",
        "Riley: Hey, quit yelling at her, Casey.",
        "Alison: Riley --",
        "Casey: Excuse me.",
        "Riley: No, it isn't her fault.",
        "Casey: And how do you know that, huh?",
        "Riley: Because I'm the one who told her she needed to talk to somebody about this.",
        "Casey: You did? And -- and you listened to him instead of me? Why? Because he told you what you wanted to hear?",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't like that.",
        "Casey: Sure it wasn't! And why are you giving her advice on anything, man?",
        "Riley: Because I'm the one it happened to.",
        "Casey: Oh, give me a break! You are out of it. You don't even know what happened.",
        "Riley: Look, Alison needed someone to talk to, okay? Someone who might have seen that Dr. Hughes has been acting not himself lately, or that yes, maybe he could've made a mistake like this.",
        "Casey: So you go to his wife?",
        "Alison: Look, Casey, maybe it was stupid to go to Kim, but I --",
        "Casey: Yes, you think? Why couldn't you both just stay out of this? And look what happened!",
        "Riley: No, come here. What is wrong with you?",
        "Casey: Let go of me.",
        "Riley: Your family is really freaked out right now.",
        "Casey: Yes, that's right. My family.",
        "Riley: Now is not the time for this.",
        "Casey: Do not tell me what to do!",
        "Alison: Casey, wait --",
        "Riley: No, let him go. I'm sorry, Alison. He shouldn't have said those things to you.",
        "Alison: No, it's -- it's okay. He's just upset.",
        "Riley: No, you do not need to make excuses for him. You know he was out of line, right? It isn't your fault.",
        "Alison: I should, um, go see if there's anything I can do to help.",

        "Meg: Hey. So, what are you two talking about?",
        "Faith: Nothing. I was just leaving.",
        "Meg: But Mama told me that you were going riding.",
        "Faith: I changed my mind.",
        "Meg: Okay. Bye. What was that all about?",
        "Damian: Faith is becoming a young lady. She's starting to have questions about affairs of the heart.",
        "Meg: Yeah. They grow up so fast.",
        "Damian: Eliza's next.",
        "Meg: Uh, oh, no, she's not. So, was she testing you on some of those prince charming theories?",
        "Damian: Oh, hardly. But, you know, she's not the only one around here with a romantic side.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? Who else is there?",
        "Damian: Moi.",
        "Meg: Oh.",
        "Damian: And I think we should still go on the cruise tomorrow morning.",
        "Meg: Damian, you know I can't. I have nobody to watch Eliza.",
        "Damian: So we'll take her with us.",
        "Meg: We'll take a little baby with us to a private getaway? Isn't that gonna kill the mood?",
        "Damian: Not as long as their mother agrees to come along. Besides, I'd like to get to know Miss Eliza better.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, then in that case, you know my answer.",
        "Damian: I assume it's still a yes.",
        "Meg: Yes, of course it's a yes. Are you kidding? Yeah.",
        "Damian: Great. We can fly to New York this afternoon, spend the night there, and leave for the cruise tomorrow morning. How soon can you be ready?",
        "Meg: Uh, well, you're talking to a simple farm girl. Give me half an hour.",
        "Damian: Good. I have something to take care of, as well, and then I'll meet you back here.",
        "Meg: I can't believe we're doing this.",
        "Damian: It's worth it to see your smile. You deserve it.",
        "Meg: No, we deserve it. Just remind me to pick up a little something for Faith -- just a little thank you for awakening the romantic in you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey, there you are. Where did you go? Faith, I'm talking to you.",
        "Faith: I went to the farm, okay?",
        "Lily: No, it is not okay. What's going on?",
        "Faith: Nothing.",
        "Lily: Faith, I don't believe that. I know something is bothering you. Did I do something to upset you somehow?",
        "Faith: I don't know. Did you?",
        "Lily: Look, one minute we're buddy-buddy, and the next thing I know, you don't even want to be in the same room with me.",
        "Faith: That's not true.",
        "Lily: Look at me. Why don't you want to go on this family vacation?",
        "Faith: You mean to visit Dad in Kentucky?",
        "Lily: After the breeders' convention, yes. I'd really like for you to be there.",
        "Faith: Did you know that Damian and Aunt Meg are, like, together? Like together?",
        "Lily: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Faith: So, it's not weird to you?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Faith: It doesn't bother you at all?",
        "Lily: Why would it?",
        "Faith: Because you were married to Damian.",
        "Lily: Baby, that was so long ago.",
        "Faith: I know. And now that you and Dad are back together, he's the only one for you, forever and ever, right?",

        "Holden: Look, I don't want any trouble.",

        "Holden: You're obviously hurt. Why don't you let me take you to the hospital?",
        "Skaggs: If I wanted to go to a hospital, I would have flagged down an ambulance, all right? Now, just drive like I told you, and there won't be any problems.",

        "Holden: I think if you do it, you could keep this thing from escalating.",

        "Alison: No.",

        "Riley: Look, I wasn't gonna say anything, but you saw me coming to the hospital with Dr. Hughes, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Riley: It was because something happened when I bumped into him here in Old Town. He was -- he was looking at his pager like he'd never even seen it before.",
        "Alison: Are you serious?",
        "Riley: Yes. He literally asked me what he should do with it. And then it was like the page that he had -- he didn't think it was urgent. He was in no hurry, no rush to get back to the hospital.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Riley: That's why I walked him back there. Now, I'm no doctor, and -- and what I saw -- it could mean nothing. Or it could be something really serious.",
        "Alison: Do you think there might be something wrong with him?",
        "Riley: I don't know. But if there is, you owed it to him to say something to his wife.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but all I managed to do was give her a heart attack.",
        "Riley: No, you -- you didn't cause that, Ali.",
        "Alison: But I was a part of it. What if Dr. Hughes makes himself worse wondering why this happened to her? I have to tell him the truth, Riley. I have to tell him I was there and why.",
