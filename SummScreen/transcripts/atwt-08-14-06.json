        "Carly watches as Simon helps himself to a woman's diamond necklace. She is mortified that he swiped it as a game and then makes him return it. Carly and Simon can't help but enjoy each other's company though. Damian is nervous as he and Luke try to get on their flight; Damian feigns lightheadedness when Luke is concerned that Lucy isn't calling him back. Serge demands Damian get Luke on the flight tonight and he is going with them to make sure it happens. Damian isn't pleased but Serge reminds him of the money he owes their friends. He has to make Luke sign over his trust; he gently reminds him what happens if Luke predeceases him. Jack and Holden are at the airport as well trying to stop Damian from leaving the country with Luke; they enlist the help of a Federal agent. Serge overhears this plan and panics, causing Damian to lose his cool. Serge takes Luke hostage and Jack is shot. Lucy and Dusty are tied up in the Fairwinds wine cellar, but are able to get loose, by breaking a gas pipe by accident. They break down the door with an ax and rush out just before the cellar explodes. Dusty and Lucy are thrown clear, but Lucy won't awaken. Meg rushes to their aid after hearing the explosion when driving by. When Lucy awakens, she can't breathe. Paul worries about Emily, even moreso when she ignores his phone call. He stops by, after Meg makes the suggestion and she explains she is trying to work part time back at the newspaper. Paul is upset thinking she needs bed rest. They come to an agreement to try to stay on friendly terms but with boundaries. Paul then offers to help Emily with her work. Gwen struggles with the slasher and seems to get the bette of him when she knocks him out. She calls the police, but the attacker wakes up and tries to choke her. She awakens later finding Will standing over her. He claims he heard her screaming; Gwen thanks him for saving her life and tells her she loves him. When Casey awakens, Gwen explains what happened, but she can't identify her attacker because he had a mask and dark hooded sweatshirt on. Casey points out that Will has one on even though it is 70 degrees out. He is suspicious of what Will is capable of doing to get his wife back. Will assures both of them he would never hurt either one of them. The police arrive, Will is further questioned and he seems nervous. Outside, Dallas hears a noise when checking for evidence and finds a fearful looking Maddie sitting with her knees pressed to her chest on Will and Gwen's porch bench."

        "Carly: I love you, too. Well have a good time and behave yourselves. Bye.",
        "Simon: So how is everything at home?",
        "Carly: Fine. Just fine. The kids are okay with me having to stay in New York for another day.",
        "Simon: Come on, I heard that. What did you bribe them with?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: FAO Schwarz and toys that cost more than these expensive shoes. But not more than that?",
        "Simon: Wow, it's a nice piece. I was talking about the jewelry of course. So how much do you think something like that goes for?",
        "Simon: All diamonds are running about $13,000 a karat in today's market. Ten of those stones look to be at least two karats, so were talking over a $250,000. That's if their good clarity -- which they appear to be.",
        "Carly: I am such an idiot.",
        "Simon: Come on. No your not. You're the brightest women I know.",
        "Carly: Really? Well if I'm so bright, then why did I think it would be a good idea to go in to business with a jewel thief?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: She still hasn't called.",
        "Damian: Who?",
        "Luke: Lucy. I called her three times, I even texted her.",
        "Damian: Perhaps she's in surgery or on rounds and hasn't had a chance to pick up her messages.",
        "Luke: I'll call the hospital, maybe they can page her.",
        "Damian: No, I wouldn't call the hospital yet.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Damian: Because Lucy is -- she's still -- what's the phrase? Low man on a totem pole. She's still an intern. Perhaps she's not even be allowed to receive personal calls. Perhaps we're ready to board. You want to check with the clerk?",
        "Sergio: Nicely played.",
        "Damian: What are you doing here? I told you to make sure that Lucy stayed put.",
        "Sergio: I wouldn't worry about Lucy.",
        "Damian: If she follows us here, if she speaks to Luke \u0096",
        "Sergio: We'll be long gone.",
        "Damian: You're coming with us?",
        "Sergio: Of course.",
        "Damian: That wasn't the plan.",
        "Sergio: Plans change. And our friends thought that given the trouble you had convincing your son, you might need my help.",
        "Damian: You stay away from my son!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I bet he didn't leave us a corkscrew.",
        "Dusty: Why? You thirsty?",
        "Lucy: This is my father's collection, all this wine. He left it here when he went to prison.",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's right. You used to live here, huh?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, many moons ago.",
        "Dusty: You know anything about this pipe?",
        "Lucy: No, I know there's a sprinkler system and an alarm. But who knows if that's still enabled anymore. So many people have lived here. Damian probably installed his own security system. They're probably at the airport right now. Poor Luke.",
        "Dusty: Can you move your hands?",
        "Lucy: A little.",
        "Dusty: Okay, well, try to work it loose and come closer to me so you can work on mine, all right?",
        "Lucy: I'll try.",
        "Dusty: Get a little slack on it. There you go. Come closer to me. Closer. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy?",

        "Meg: So what do I owe you?",
        "Waitress: Not a thing. The gentleman already took care of it.",
        "Meg: You didn't have to do that.",
        "Paul: You know, you wouldn't have to work at all if you would just marry me.",
        "Meg: I want to work -- I like working, and you know that.",
        "Paul: Well, it's a good thing because I think I'm developing a rare ailment.",
        "Meg: Oh?",
        "Paul: It requires private duty nursing. I'm getting gout.",
        "Meg: Oh. Well, that hand seems very healthy to me.",
        "Paul: Consumption?",
        "Meg: Then we'd both have to wear masks.",
        "Paul: But at least I'd have you in my apartment all night.",
        "Meg: You, me and the oxygen tank.",
        "Paul: Is that so bad? How 'bout this? I'm getting a psychological illness -- a compulsion. I can't leave my house until I make love with my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Meg: But I'm not your fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Paul: Hmm. You're so beautiful, especially when you turn me down. Why is that? What -- what is that?",
        "Meg: Maybe you like a challenge? You want what you can't have?",
        "Paul: Is that why you're playing hard to get?",
        "Meg: I'm just taking care of myself. Look, maybe you should go home, catch up on some TV. There's a nice documentary on men who can't take no for an answer.",
        "Paul: Oh! Okay. Well, can I at least call you while I'm watching that?",
        "Meg: I'm working. What are you doing tonight?",
        "Paul: Well, since you're no fun, I don't know. Maybe I'll just worry.",
        "Meg: About? Emily and the baby. So why don't you give her a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Emily, are you sure you want to take all that on? You're supposed to be resting.",
        "Emily: Mother, I need a job. Who's gonna hire me? Huh? I'm pregnant and fresh out of the loony bin. But I'm thinking compared to Craig the convict, I'm looking like a Godsend. And the way I look at it, I know this job. I mean, I worked there for years. I know the staff. I need to do this. I cannot just sit here all day long thinking about --",
        "Susan: Paul.",
        "Emily: I need to accept the fact that I'm an unmarried mother who has to share her child with someone she'd just as soon never see again.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Susan: Ooh, ooh, ooh. I'll get it. No. Sit, sit, sit, sit. I'll get it. Where is it? Okay. Listen, Sweetie, I have to get to the hospital and check on a patient, but I'll be right back. What do you want for dinner? Who is it?",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Casey! Casey! [Gwen breathing heavily, the Slasher is trying to stab her] Casey! Did you kill him, too?",
        "Gwen: Casey, are you okay?! Why are you doing this? Casey! Casey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Emily's not picking up?",
        "Paul: No. She's supposed to be on bed rest.",
        "Meg: So maybe she turned her phone off and put her feet up. You could always call her mother. Or not.",
        "Paul: You could call her mother.",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Come on, you like Susan. Susan likes you.",
        "Meg: Not gonna call Susan. Not my job. Maybe you can go over there if you're that worried.",
        "Paul: You want me to go over there?",
        "Meg: I want you to find a way to deal with Emily and yourself so that the baby is just a baby and not an issue.",
        "Paul: So then we can get married, right?",
        "Meg: So then the baby will have a happy life. And then we'll talk about the rest.",
        "Paul: You're tough.",
        "Meg: I'm good for you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, no, I keep telling you that.",

        "Emily: Lasagna. Lasagna sounds great to me.",
        "Susan: Great. I love lasagna. So --",
        "Emily: I don't want to talk about it, Mother. I don't want to talk about him.",
        "Susan: Okay, why?",
        "Emily: Look, he was really -- he was wonderful at the hospital. He was very supportive -- and I can understand his concerns -- he has legitimate concerns. This is his baby, and I was showing signs of Preeclampsia -- but I am following my doctor's orders now, I am resting.",
        "Susan: Actually, you're editing a newspaper.",
        "Emily: Which has been limping along without me for months, Mother. I need to do this for me, okay? I promise I will back off if it's to much. But I need to feel like I can accomplish something. That I can support myself and my baby without -- by myself. Too much contact with Paul -- it's unhealthy, okay. It just gets me off track.",
        "Susan: So, lasagna.",
        "Emily: Okay, we can do this. We can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sergio: You owe our friends a great deal of money.",
        "Damian: Yeah, and I'm sure as soon as we return to Malta, Luke will agree to open his trust.",
        "Sergio: And if he doesn't?",
        "Damian: He will -- he loves me.",
        "Sergio: You do realize that our friends are familiar with the terms of the trust.",
        "Damian: What are you implying?",
        "Sergio: Should your son predecease you, the trust reverts to you.",
        "Damian: Are you threatening my son?",
        "Sergio: Just make sure he gets on that plane.",
        "Damian: Are we ready to board? What did the clerk say?",
        "Luke: That'll be a while --",
        "Sergio: Sergio Francone.",
        "Luke: Luke Snyder.",
        "Sergio: Damian tells me you're going to Malta with us.",
        "Damian: Signor Francone is a business acquaintance.",
        "Sergio: And as luck would have it we're on the same flight -- in fact I'll be sitting right behind you. Perhaps we can play chess.",
        "Damian: Perhaps another time.",
        "Sergio: I need to call our friends -- tell them we spoke. Pleasure to meet you, Luke. I'll see you onboard, no?",
        "Luke: Business acquaintance? Guy sounds like he's in a bad remake of \"The Godfather.\"",
        "Damian: He's very old school. Perhaps we're ready to board, you want to check?",
        "Luke: They said it would be a while. Like I just told you.",
        "Damian: Yeah of course, your right.",
        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Damian: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Luke: I mean you seem a little stressed out.",
        "Damian: No, I'm totally fine.",
        "Luke: Damian, you rushed me out of the house and into the limo, we broke every speed limit posted, and now you're stressing about boarding?",
        "Damian: Look, I -- I'd just like to get settled, that's all.",
        "Luke: Have you taken your medication?",
        "Damian: No. See good son -- let's find a cafe. I'll sit down, and get a glass of water -- you get something to eat. And I'll take my pills, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Are you sure Luke and Damian didn't spot us?",
        "Jack: Well if they did, worst case is that they wouldn't take this flight, and Damian gets delayed. I'm gonna track down my buddy, okay.",
        "Flight attendant #1: I'm sorry, Gentlemen. We haven't started boarding yet.",
        "Jack: Yeah, hi. I'm with the Oakdale Police Department.",
        "Peter: Jack!",
        "Jack: Peter!",
        "Peter: He's cleared. Thanks.",
        "Jack: How you doing? Holden, this is my buddy, Peter Quinn. We did a stint in the academy together. This is my cousin.",
        "Holden: Holden Snyder.",
        "Jack: He's a federal agent.",
        "Holden: Can you help us? I'm not sure if Jack explained the situation.",
        "Peter: Well you know Jack, you always got to drag the details out of him.",
        "Holden: Bottom line -- can you stop Damian Grimaldi from leaving the country?",

        "Dusty: Sure your okay?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: Can you untie my hands.",
        "Lucy: And then what?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you just try it first?",
        "Lucy: Still the same after shave. Some things never change.",
        "Dusty: Just untie the knot -- if you can.",
        "Lucy: I know how to untie a knot.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're a real escape artist.",
        "Lucy: I've learned a few things since I left town. How to suture in the dark -- I can even tie a cherry stem in a bow -- with my tongue. Looser?",
        "Dusty: A little bit.",
        "Lucy: Relax. You don't want to tighten the ropes. How's that?",
        "Dusty: I think you got it. You okay?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. What's that -- hissing? Do you hear that?",
        "Dusty: That's a gas pipe! We gotta get out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: No, my interest in jewels ended years ago.",
        "Carly: Oh, not so many years ago. As I recall, when you first came to Oakdale you were trying to rip off Lily Snyder.",
        "Simon: Youthful indiscretion. And where do you think I learned so much about business?",
        "Carly: From being a common thief.",
        "Simon: Common thief -- okay, there was nothing common about my technique. Oh, what you don't believe me? Alright then, always up for a challenge -- I'm gonna prove it to you. You mind if I borrow this.",
        "Carly: Yes I do, I plan on drinking that?",
        "Simon: Oh, that's okay, she's not gonna mind.",
        "Carly: Who?",
        "Simon: The woman's who's jewelry I'm gonna have in my hand in less than five minutes.",
        "Carly: No, no, no -- you are insane if you think your gonna get away with that!",
        "Simon: I'll tell you what let's make this interesting -- you got a watch, yeah -- put me on the clock. Where's your camera? Where's your camera?",
        "Carly: Get out of there -- come on!",
        "Simon: Take some happy snaps -- they're going to be way more interesting than all of these pictures of the statue of liberty. All right, ready? Five minutes -- start the clock.",

        "Emily: Paul.",
        "Paul: You were supposed to be on bed rest. Is Susan even here?",
        "Emily: My mother's at work. And I was resting -- I was sitting on the couch right before you knocked.",
        "Paul: So, what is all this?",
        "Emily: Work.",
        "Paul: Work.",
        "Emily: Work -- it's why I didn't call you back, I was working and obviously that's why you're here -- but I'm fine, the baby's fine -- we're all fine.",
        "Paul: You decided to go back to work?",
        "Emily: Part time. Yeah, why?",
        "Paul: This can't wait until after the baby's born?",
        "Emily: No, after the baby's born, I'm gonna have to go on maternity leave. And you can't take maternity leave unless you have something to leave like a job. So I was gonna get a job --",
        "Paul: Okay look, Em, if this is a question of money --",
        "Emily: I'm not taking your money.",
        "Paul: Child support.",
        "Emily: We'll talk about support after the baby's born.",
        "Paul: Okay, look I don't mean to invade your privacy or to compromise your independence --",
        "Emily: No, but you've done both very well, thank you.",
        "Paul: You have been diagnosed with Preeclampsia. You just spent time in the hospital. This is a condition that is exacerbated by stress. Does the doctor even know that you're going back to work?",
        "Emily: Yes, she does actually.",
        "Paul: You can't wait until after you have the baby?",
        "Emily: Are you telling me how to be a parent?",
        "Paul: No, look I'm worried about you and I'm worried about the baby. And I've read about this condition and you have to limit your exposure to stress.",
        "Emily: I am trying to, but you won't go away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You sure that wasn't just a sprinkler?",
        "Dusty: Believe me, its gas.",
        "Lucy: Well this place is ventilated, we won't asphyxiate --",
        "Dusty: This whole place could blow right now.",
        "Lucy: Well let's find something to open the door with.",
        "Dusty: I got something -- stand back.",
        "Lucy: Careful, careful. No sparks.",
        "Dusty: Well if we use the axe we make it.",
        "Lucy: I know, but if we stay in here we'll die. Do it.",

        "Paul: Well, you are pregnant.",
        "Emily: There's that. You've been nothing but supportive lately. And I appreciate that. I guess this is just a lot to get used to.",
        "Paul: I've known you for a long time. And we've been friends for most of that time and -- we've always been able to talk to each other. And I know that things have changed, we've both made mistakes, and we both hurt one another. But I'd really like to think that we could find our way back to friendship -- at least for the sake of the child. Which is kind of my long and kind of awkward way of saying that I'm here to help and if you would just talk to me. If I overstep -- if I overstep, just tell me. Tell me.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Paul: So I'm stressing you out, huh?",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Just a little. No, it's actually work -- it's re-entry to work -- Craig has made a mess of things. And my staff has tried their best to make sense of it but --",
        "Paul: They have their own areas to manage.",
        "Emily: Right.",
        "Paul: So what is it? It's financial? It's circulation? Editorial? What?",
        "Emily: All of the above. No, no, no, no.",

        "Emily: That is the bottom line. You don't need to do that --",
        "Paul: Emily, here's the problem right off the bat. Whoever was making entries after Craig went to prison confused the fiscal year with the calendar year.",
        "Emily: That's why --",
        "Paul: You haven't paid your taxes have you?",
        "Emily: The taxes haven't been paid?",

        "Paul: Emily, I was CFO of B.R.O. for years -- I have a degree in Economics. I can figure this out.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well I get that you're really smart, but this could take hours - - days.",
        "Paul: This won't take days. It'll take hours like you said. I've got some time right now -- believe me I've got some time.",
        "Emily: No, Paul, really I can't let you do this.",
        "Paul: Emily look, if you insist on going back to work and you're not gonna let me help you financially, will you at least let me decipher these books? For the sake of our child. Just this once.",
        "Emily: Okay, just this once. This is really nice of you, you know.",
