        "Will: You have to water this, I think, once a day --",
        "Gwen: Oh.",
        "Alison: I don't know, I tend to kill everything.",
        "Will: Wait, Alison. Don't go.",

        "Aaron: Where do you get off, Man, pushing Sofie around like that?",
        "Cole: Did you see me lay a hand on her? No, you didn't, so back off.",
        "Aaron: And if I don't? What are you going to do? You going to take a swing at me?",
        "Cole: Is that what you want? Is that what you want?",
        "Sofie: Okay, stop! Please, stop.",
        "Cole: What are you telling me for?",
        "Sofie: Aaron, really, this isn't anything.",
        "Aaron: Anything, what? Unusual? Something he should be apologizing for?",
        "Cole: You're the one butting in, Man.",
        "Sofie: Cole, it's just a misunderstanding.",
        "Cole: Well, maybe I'm confused, because I thought you already had a boyfriend.",
        "Sofie: I do. And I love you, you know that --",
        "Cole: Well, then why is some guy, who says he's just your co-worker, getting in my face?",
        "Aaron: Because I also said I was her friend. And I didn't like seeing you toss that picnic she made for you into the trash.",
        "Sofie: Aaron, please -- you're just making it worse.",
        "Aaron: I don't get this. How could you let this guy treat you like this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Margo, it's me. Well, I sound exhausted because I am exhausted. I've been trying to get a hold of Jack, and I just wanted to know if you've heard from him. [Katie sighs] I know. I keep getting his voicemail, and I'm just really worried about him. I'm not used to this, okay? He usually calls in to check in when he's on duty, and I just want to know if you've heard from him, at least. You have? When? But -- oh -- okay. Just let me know if you hear from him again, okay? Thank you, Margo. [Door opens] Oh, you're awake. I thought you were passed out.",
        "Brad: Oh, as if. Have you met my liver? It's like a rock.",
        "Katie: I don't think that's a good thing. Listen, I was just getting ready to leave.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, hey, hey. I heard you talking to Margo. So, any news on Jack?",
        "Katie: Brad, I'm so scared for him. I know I shouldn't be, and I'm trying not to be. It's Jack, and if anyone can take care of himself, it's him. It's just, I don't know if I can take this any longer.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you can. You can take it. You can take it. Want to know why? Because everything's going be all right. All right? I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Officer Thompson? This is Detective Snyder's ex-wife. I'm just calling to make sure he got to the hospital okay.",
        "Idaho cop: Yes, I was at the ER when he arrived.",
        "Carly: Good, good. When he wakes up, tell him I said not to worry about me. You see, Jack can sometimes get sort of obsessive -- and he should be concentrating on getting better right now, and not on what I'm doing.",
        "Idaho cop: Ma'am, the Detective informed me he wants you back home where it's safe.",
        "Carly: I'll be safe when my child is safe.",
        "Idaho cop: You do realize the type of people you're dealing with here, don't you?",
        "Carly: I got the message loud and clear when they tried to kill me. But they still have my son. Tell Jack that I'll be okay. I know what I have to do. Hang in there, J.J. I'm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I wonder what's taking Gwen so long with our sodas.",
        "Will: She's particular about the ice. Just relax, please? Listen, I'm the last person who would hold someone's past against them. I don't know what you did, really, out in Vegas, or why, and I don't want to. What I do know is that when I was messing up a lot, you were really there for me. And you treated me like a human being.",
        "Alison: So, you're going to do the same for me?",
        "Will: Sure. Why not?",
        "Alison: Will, come on. There's a huge difference. I'm an adult. You were just a kid then.",
        "Will: Yeah, but I was a messed-up kid. I mean, you could've had me arrested. I broke into your apartment.",
        "Alison: You were just doing that because you liked me and you wanted me to notice you.",
        "Will: How'd I do?",
        "Alison: Oh, it worked.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Will: Man, I was so pathetic.",
        "Alison: You were not.",
        "Will: Yeah, I was. I was following you around. You must've not really liked that kind of attention. You weren't flattered by it, right?",
        "Alison: I don't know if \"Flattered\" would be the word I would use, no --",
        "Will: Anyway, what I'm trying to say is -- a lot of people make mistakes, and if you're not at the point yet where you can forgive yourself, well, then its okay, because your friends can.",
        "Alison: I can't believe you still think of me as a friend.",
        "Will: Of course I do. Gwen and I both do.",
        "Gwen: Hey -- I'm sorry that took so long. The ice machine wasn't really participating and working with me there. [Alison laughs] What?",
        "Will: Nothing. Just, I love you.",
        "Gwen: Oh, okay. Here. And thank you again, so much, for the plant. That was really thoughtful of you.",
        "Alison: I'm glad you like it.",
        "Gwen: And I just want you to know that Will and I both consider you a friend.",
        "Alison: Why, I have no idea -- but I'm not going to question it. I could use a few friends right now.",
        "Will: Well, you got them.",
        "Gwen: Hey, later this week, Will and I are thinking about going to a movie, if you want to come.",
        "Alison: You don't have to do that, really.",
        "Gwen: Well, actually -- if I just go with him, he's going to drag me to some movie where stuff just blows up.",
        "Will: What's wrong with that?",
        "Gwen: Well, if I could get somebody on my team, we might actually convince him to see a movie that has plot in it, so you'd be doing me a favor.",
        "Alison: Okay -- I'd love that. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: You're wrong about us.",
        "Cole: Forget it, Sofie. I don't need you defending me to this guy.",
        "Sofie: I just don't want Aaron to have the wrong impression of us.",
        "Aaron: So, I'm wrong about what I just saw?",
        "Sofie: What you saw was a few weeks of stress coming to a head, that's all. But we're fine now. Really. See?",
        "Cole: Mmm. Are you done? Because I've got, like, zero interest in explaining myself to anyone.",
        "Sofie: Cole --",
        "Cole: I mean it, Sofie. I don't want to do this. Let this guy think what he wants, I don't care.",
        "Sofie: Where are you going?",
        "Cole: To pick up some CDs. I'd ask you to join me, but I don't want your friend here to think I forced you to do something you didn't want to.",
        "Sofie: Cole!",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: It's not your fault. He just gets like this sometimes.",
        "Aaron: I'm apologizing to you. I put you on the spot. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Sofie: Cole is so much more than what you saw tonight, Aaron. Really, he's just having a bad day.",
        "Aaron: Which he took out on you.",
        "Sofie: Couples do that.",
        "Aaron: So, I guess you won't be rethinking your relationship with him, huh?",
        "Sofie: I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You got Jack's ring on your finger, of course you're going to -- [Door slams] Ah! Of course you're going to want him to call and check in. Okay, now what did Margo say? What did she say?",
        "Katie: She said that Jack called her earlier, that he was following a lead on J.J., but he hasn't called her since.",
        "Brad: Okay. Okay, okay. Well, then why can't that be a good thing? You know, maybe that means that Jack's found J.J., and arrested the kidnappers and he hasn't had time to call anyone.",
        "Katie: Or maybe it means that the lead he was following turned out to be another trap, and he's hurt, or something worse, and he can't get to a phone.",
        "Brad: Why do you do that? Why do you always go to the worst case scenario? Who does that help?",
        "Katie: Me! Because I don't want to be caught off guard if something happens.",
        "Brad: Jack -- Jack is not going to let anything happen to him. He has got way too much to live for. Okay? He's got you.",
        "Katie: Are you trying to make me cry?",
        "Brad: I'm trying to get you to see this logically, okay? He's going to be fine. And I can prove it to you.",
        "Katie: How are you going to do that?",
        "Brad: Okay, I'm going to go take a shower. I'm going to clear my head, and -- and I'm going to come down here squeaky clean, with a plan.",
        "Katie: The only thing that's going to make me feel better is knowing where Jack is, and that he's okay.",
        "Brad: Whatever it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Damn!",
        "[Carly opens up Kit's locked box]",
        "Carly: Some of the ransom money -- it has to be.",
        "[Carly picks up the notepad to see what Kit wrote on it]",
        "Carly: Okay, Kit -- you helped your pals get Jack up to that cabin. Let's see if you also helped them run away with my son. None of this tells me where Silas took J.J. damn it! What is this? Something -- 42 Windsor Street.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You can't leave Cole? Why not?",
        "Sofie: That's not what I meant.",
        "Aaron: That's what you just said.",
        "Sofie: I meant -- I don't want to. I don't want to leave Cole because I love him.",
        "Aaron: I get that. I get how you can love someone who's --",
        "Sofie: Who's what?",
        "Aaron: Who's bad for you. Its like -- it's like you can't help yourself, right? I mean, you see the signs, but -- and you see what's coming towards you, but there's that little thing that just -- that just keeps you there.",
        "Sofie: Aaron --",
        "Aaron: No -- and you just keep telling yourself, it's going to be different next time. And next time, it just happens again.",
        "Sofie: No, it's like I said. He's just having a bad day.",
        "Aaron: He seems to have a lot of those lately, huh?",
        "Sofie: Cole would never hurt me. Never. I know that. I know what I sound like, okay? But you don't know him like I do. He's really sensitive. He's an artist, and a lot of creative people -- they seem like they have these huge egos, but underneath, they're so insecure, like, you wouldn't even believe it.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't know that feeling, I guess.",
        "Sofie: A composer can get into a slump, like a baseball player. I don't expect you to understand, but it's hard on him. He gets frustrated and overreacts. He doesn't mean it.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Sofie: It doesn't matter what I say, does it? You've already made up your mind about him.",
        "Aaron: I just keep getting this feeling like there's more you're not telling me. If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. We don't have to. But if you need somebody to listen, I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is so amazing. What a cool way to start a baby book.",
        "Will: Yeah, Gwen's going to turn it into the \"War and Peace\" of photo albums.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm so happy for you guys. You guys are going to be great parents.",
        "Will: I hope so. With the exception of my dad, we didn't really have the best role models.",
        "Alison: Well, if you're into role models, I guess you won't be calling me to baby-sit. You know, I really should be getting going. I didn't realize how late it was.",
        "Will: You really don't have to rush out of here, you know.",
        "Alison: Oh, no, it's okay. And besides, I'm sure you want time to bond with your plant. Are you going to give him a name?",
        "Gwen: Actually, we might hold off on that. We're calling the baby Murgatroid at the moment, so we're not exactly batting a thousand.",
        "Alison: Gotcha.",
        "Will: I like Murgatroid.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, enough to put it on a t-shirt.",
        "Alison: Nice. I just want to thank you both again, for being so cool, more cool than I could have hoped with everything.",
        "Will: You don't have to thank us.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. You have no idea what it's like to walk into a room and know that people see you as a friend and not some total embarrassment or lost cause, so --",
        "Will: Nobody ever thought that.",
        "Alison: Thanks. You know, you're probably the only functional relationship I have in my life right now.",
        "Will: Then you got problems.",
        "Gwen: Well, you know, we'll see you soon. And we'll call you about the movie later.",
        "Alison: Great. I can't wait. And I'll catch you guys later.",
        "Will: All right.",
        "Gwen: Bye.",
        "Will: I'm a little blown away right now.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm not. That's what Maddie was telling me in the room at the party.",
        "Will: No, I wasn't talking about that.",
        "Gwen: You're not surprised that your ex-girlfriend became a meth head and a porn star?",
        "Will: I am. It's just that I'm more surprised that you invited her to hang out with us. What made you do that?",
        "Gwen: Because I knew it was what you wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hi, Jack, it's me again. I'm still at the farm. I am just -- really worried. So, can you please just, call me as soon as you get this, or the station, or whatever's easier for you. Please just get word to me that you're okay. I love you so much. Bye. No -- no, that would make things so much worse. No, calling Carly would be insane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Kit: You want to answer that, Sweetheart? Or do you want me to do it for you?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Kit: Answer it.",
        "Carly: I'm sure whoever it --",
        "Kit: Now!",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Katie: Carly, it's Katie.",
        "Carly: Ah, of course it is. This isn't really a good time.",
        "Katie: I just want to know if you know where Jack is? I've been trying to call him and can't get a hold of him.",
        "Carly: Like I said, it's not the best time.",
        "Katie: Fine. Can you tell me if everything's okay? Can you at least tell me that much?",
        "Carly: Yeah, everything's just peachy, so you won't have to call again then. Bye. I can explain this.",
        "Kit: Mm-hmm --",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Kit: I'm sure you can.",
        "Carly: I thought that I was alone here.",
        "Kit: I'm sure you did.",
        "Carly: And then I heard someone, and I got sort of spooked. Turns out, Kit, that I'm not going to need to stay here after all.",
        "Kit: Really? Why's that?",
        "Carly: Well, see, I thought that Ned and me, we could start over, here, but actually I think it would be better if we did it at home.",
        "Kit: That's where you're going? Home?",
        "Carly: Quick as we can.",
        "Kit: Oh, we?",
        "Carly: Yeah, me and Ned.",
        "Kit: So Ned's with you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, he's just outside. You didn't see him?",
        "Kit: No.",
        "Carly: Well, he's out there. And he gets pretty impatient, you know, so I'm just going to skedaddle.",
        "Kit: Uh-uh-uh -- nice try. You didn't really expect me to believe that Silas just let you and the Detective Jack go? Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, did I hear you talking to somebody?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Jack?",
        "Katie: No. I realized there was somebody who might know where Jack is that I hadn't thought of.",
        "Brad: Tell me you didn't talk to Carly. Did she tell you anything?",
        "Katie: She said everything was fine and then she hung up on me.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, don't you feel better now?",
        "Katie: Why would I?",
        "Brad: Well, because she hung up on you! If something was wrong with Jack, I mean really wrong, she would've told you.",
        "Katie: No, she wouldn't!",
        "Brad: Come on.",
        "Katie: I just asked her point blank if Jack was okay, if she knew where he was, and she went out of her way not to answer me. She's playing these little games and I'm falling for it.",
        "Brad: What? What?",
        "Katie: I'm falling for it.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Katie: This is what Carly wants. She wants me to look like I can't handle this, like I can't deal with the demands of Jack's job, like I can't trust him to be alone with her. Oh my God! Classic Carly. Unbelievable!",
        "Brad: You said it. You said it.",
        "Katie: What was your plan?",
        "Brad: That you should call Carly.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this is hopeless.",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no.",
        "Katie: No. No, you're right. It's not. I'm not going to let her get to me. I am not going to let my fears get to me. I'm going to be cheerful and strong and brave, just like Jack would want me to be. And then he's going to call me, and he's going to tell me that everything's fine, and that will be that.",
        "Brad: Good plan.",
        "Katie: Yes, it is. It -- it's -- oh, my God!",
        "Brad: Okay. Okay, this isn't going to work. We need to do something to distract you. Okay? To challenge you, all right?",
        "Katie: I already beat the pants off you, literally, at poker.",
        "Brad: No more games. No more games. What does Emma do when she needs to take her mind off something? You know what she does? You know what she does? She cleans. Okay?",
        "Katie: You want me to clean?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I mean, I know housework is not your, you know, favorite event and -- or best event -- and that's why I'm going to help you.",
        "Katie: Clearly, I remember this not working. Remember when those people won us, we went to clean their basement? I remember me cleaning the basement and you not cleaning the basement.",
        "Brad: Okay, this is going to be something totally different. I'm going to be right by your side. There is something about cleaning that can be a whole Zen thing. You know, like the mop moving back and forth. Wax on, wax off. You know, miyagi-style. It chills you right out.",
        "Katie: I know what you're doing.",
        "Brad: Distracting you.",
        "Katie: You are trying to get me to clean the kitchen so Emma doesn't come home to a messy house!",
        "[Brad laughing]",
        "Brad: Okay, will you just go with this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I don't want to make a big deal out of this, okay?",
        "Will: Well, if it bothers you, then it is a big deal, to me.",
        "Gwen: Look, you're really, you're a nice person you know, you cut people a lot of slack, and that's a really good thing that you don't judge people.",
        "Will: So you think Alison deserves a break?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, you go off with, you know, skinny, beautiful Alison, and do whatever you want, and I'll just stay here and I'll expand and bloat and limp around on my swollen feet.",
        "Will: Well, when you put it that way --",
        "Gwen: Will, where are you going?",
        "Will: I'm just kidding. Of course I choose you, and your swollen feet.",
        "Gwen: You better. Look, I think the reason why it seems like I have issues with Alison, is because you guys have a really complicated history, you know?",
        "Will: Well, that's just it -- that's exactly what it is -- its history. And it's in the past.",
        "Gwen: So you forgive her?",
        "Will: I think that I kind of had to. I mean, if I didn't forgive her, then I never would have been able to move on and fall in love with you.",
        "Gwen: Will, I remember how much she hurt you.",
        "Will: Alison is not that person anymore. And neither am I.",
        "Gwen: What about when she was in Vegas -- which wasn't that long ago --",
        "Will: The only person that Alison hurt when she was in Vegas was herself.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Look, it's just that, after Cleo and Jade and everything, I want our life right now to just be about us. Just you, me and the baby. And I don't want someone else bringing their problems into our lives. I don't know. Is that so terrible?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're right. Silas didn't let us go. As a matter of fact, he tried to kill us.",
        "Kit: Leave it to that man to not to get the job done. You know, he never runs out of ways to screw things up.",
        "Carly: You helped lure Jack up to that cabin. Why would you do that?",
        "Kit: We go back a long ways. And besides, he didn't try to pull one over on me like you did, \"Lee.\"",
        "Carly: And that justifies you helping him kidnap my son?",
        "Kit: Honey, I don't owe that kid a damn thing. And I owe you even less. You want to be with your son? No problem. I'll just give Silas a call, then he can --",
        "Carly: Why don't you just tell me where they are and save yourself that call?",
        "Kit: I don't think so.",
        "Carly: No? All right, you don't want to tell me? You can tell the police.",
        "Kit: Honey, if you had any ideas of calling the police, you would've gone to them first.",
        "Carly: Oh, they're already on their way.",
        "Kit: Yeah, right.",
        "Carly: Do you know how Silas tried to kill us? He blew up that nasty cabin of yours. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So there are cops all over the place.",
        "Kit: Damn it, I'll kill him --",
        "Carly: So, how long do you think before they come walking in here? Because you are an accessory to kidnapping. Not to mention extortion, aiding, abetting --",
        "Kit: Look, I didn't have nothing to do with any of that, okay?",
        "Carly: Then prove it. You tell me where my son is.",

        "Gwen: I feel like I'm keeping you from your friends.",
        "Will: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: It's just that you're trying to do something, you know, decent for someone, and I'm acting like a crazy, jealous wife. I'm guilt-tripping you into staying home with me.",
        "Will: Do you hear me complaining? I kind of like it. It's like you're protecting your territory. You're nesting.",
        "Gwen: I'm not nesting. That sounds gross.",
        "Will: Sure, you are. You're being maternal. You're trying to guilt me into staying around the house.",
        "Gwen: You're a jerk. You're having way too much fun.",
        "Will: All right, I'll stop teasing you.",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Will: You can't seriously be jealous of Alison, though?",
        "Gwen: Well, I'm the mother of your child. I can choose to be jealous of whomever I like.",
        "Will: Yes, I had feelings for Alison a long time ago. But that's over and done with. I love you.",
        "Gwen: I love you, too.",
        "Will: So then we're good? What is it?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I just feel off for some reason. I don't know why.",

        "Sofie: I don't want you to leave me alone. You're the only friend I have here in Oakdale, outside of Cole. But things just aren't as simple as they were when Cole and I started going out. And if I had ever thought about leaving him, that time is long gone. There's no way I could do that.",
        "Aaron: You keep saying that, but I don't get it.",
        "Sofie: Well, maybe you're not supposed to.",
        "Aaron: What's going on, Sofie? Has he threatened you? Is that it?",

        "Brad: Fine, fine. Have it your way. You missed a spot. All right, so, are you going to thank me?",
        "Katie: For what? Getting me to clean, in an apron?",
        "Brad: You look cute, by the way. For helping you take your mind off Jack?",
        "Katie: Yeah, it was working until you just mentioned his name. Your drain's clogged.",

        "Katie: No. It's okay? It's not okay! That ring was a promise from Jack. A promise that everything was going to be okay from now on. We were supposed to be happy. We were supposed to be together, and now I -- I swept it down the drain. Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick!",
        "Brad: Hey, look at me. Look at me. It was just an accident.",

        "Gwen: No, it's not. There's nothing natural about my mom. She's everything I don't want to be as a mother, and everything I don't want to become.",
        "Will: Okay, first off all, that's impossible, you're nothing like your mom and you know it.",
        "Gwen: I just know that no matter what she says, she's going to find a way to put herself back into our lives. And honestly, I don't want our baby anywhere near her.",
        "Will: Don't worry about Iris, please. You know I'm not going to let her within ten feet of you or the baby. And besides, she knows that I'm out of money, so what could she want from us?",

It's like Jack -- it's like a solid rock. Been through the wringer, comes back, got all these scratches on it, but it comes back to you.",
