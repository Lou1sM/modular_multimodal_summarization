        "Tom: Look, I don't know what's going on between Casey and Riley, but this is not the time.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no. Honey, I'm sure Casey's just -- he's upset about Kim. We're all upset about Kim. I'm sure it'll blow over.",
        "Tom: Riley shouldn't be here. We're dealing with a family matter.",
        "Margo: No. Just let it --",
        "Tom: I'm going out there.",
        "Margo: Let it go! Let it go. Let the boys work it out.",
        "Tom: Case shouldn't have to deal with this kid right now.",
        "Margo: Honey, he can handle it. You know what? Your father needs you to be strong right now, huh? Since you take care of him. Stop -- and I'll take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Don't make threats that you can't back up.",
        "Casey: Oh, I have no problem outing you.",
        "Riley: Oh, great idea, genius. \"Hey, Dad, funny thing. Uh, Adam's alive, and you treated him like trash, and then kicked him out of the house!\"",
        "Casey: It's not his fault. He doesn't know.",
        "Riley: Well, it's not mine, either. I mean, Mom's the one who wanted it this way.",
        "Casey: Oh, right, right. The way that conveniently keeps you out of prison.",
        "Riley: I am not afraid to pay for what I did.",
        "Casey: Well, you should be. 'Cause I've been there.",
        "Riley: Congratulations. You win, Casey. You will always be the bigger badass.",
        "Casey: Look, I have done time. And what you did to Gwen and Maddie is way worse than stealing. And you got away with it. How is that fair?!",
        "Riley: It's not! Are you really willing to ship me off to jail, just because I was willing to be friend for Alison when she needed one?",
        "Casey: Let me take care of Alison.",
        "Riley: I would if you had the first clue how to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I don't mean to second-guess your work, Doctor.",
        "Doctor: It's all right, Dr. Hughes. She's your wife.",
        "Bob: We almost lost her. Something went wrong. We've got to find out what it is so it doesn't happen again.",
        "Doctor: I followed the M.I. protocol to the letter. The only thing I can think of -- maybe she had an allergic reaction to the thrombolytic agent.",
        "Bob: Maybe. What's holding up that lab work?",
        "Alison: Dr. Hughes?",
        "Bob: Not now, Alison. I've got to get to the lab.",
        "Alison: It's important. Can we talk someplace?",
        "Bob: No! I've heard enough from you.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Hughes, I have your wife's blood work.",
        "Bob: Oh, thank you. I don't understand this. She has ten times too much thrombolytic in her system. How did this happen?",
        "Alison: Please don't be angry at me for saying this, Dr. Hughes. I think you did it yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Emma: Hello. I'm glad I caught you before you left. I promised the kids I'd make some cookies for the trip on the plane.",
        "Lily: Oh, you didn't have to do that.",
        "Emma: Well, I wouldn't let those babes go off into the wilderness without provisions. Who knows? They probably don't even have oatmeal cookies in west Kentucky.",
        "Lily: Not as yummy as your cookies. That was very sweet. Thank you.",
        "Emma: You're very welcome. So, when are you leaving?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I'm waiting for Holden to call me. He picked up his truck after the breeders' association meeting, and he was headed south, but I haven't heard from him since.",
        "Emma: He probably stopped and had lunch at one of those places by the track. You know those boys when they get together and start talking about horses. They could go on for days and nights and days and nights.",
        "Lily: You're probably right. He's earned some man time.",
        "Emma: You know, though, I feel I have to tell you, Lily, that Damian took Meg to New York. And they -- they really are going to go on that cruise together.",
        "Lily: I know. Damian stopped by before.",
        "Emma: Oh, he did? Well, I did everything I could to stop them. But they decided to take Eliza with them, so my hands were tied.",
        "Lily: You know, Holden really knows his sister. He warned me that the harder we pushed Meg away from Damian that the harder she would fall for him.",
        "Emma: She is very contrary that way. She really is. You know, but aside from that, I think she -- I think she really wanted to go on a trip. She's never had a chance to travel much, and I think she was looking forward to going on that great big ship, you know? She was so disappointed the last time that she couldn't go.",
        "Lily: I don't know, Emma. Maybe we should have taken the low road -- knocked her on the head and locked her in the stable for her own good.",
        "Emma: You know, that's a thought.",
        "Lily: It's too late now.",
        "Emma: I guess we're just going to have to -- have to trust her.",
        "Lily: So we're just gonna let her sail smack into a huge mistake? Because that's what Damian will always be -- an error in judgment wrapped in an expensive Italian suit.",
        "Emma: I hate to say it, but I'm afraid Meg's going to have to find that out for herself. I have decided to stay out of it. And I really think you should do the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Wow -- this isn't a hotel. This is a palace.",
        "Damian: Not even close.",
        "Meg: Shh.",
        "[Damian whispering]",
        "Damian: You want to see a palace, I'll take you to one some day.",
        "Meg: Oh, I'm going to hold you to that. You know, she is out.",
        "Damian: I asked the hotel to put a crib and a baby monitor in the other room.",
        "Meg: You thought of everything. And she's going to be down for a while.",
        "Damian: I didn't know what you wanted to do, so I booked dinner at four different restaurants.",
        "Meg: Four?",
        "Damian: Depending on what you're hungry for -- italiano, fran\u00e7ais, seasonal American.",
        "Meg: You choose. I am putty in your hands. You know, I hope having Eliza here doesn't cramp your style. I know it's not what you originally had in mind.",
        "Damian: Maybe not. But the three of us going away together makes a statement. One that needs to be made. For our own sake and for everyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Must be very uncomfortable, having Meg date your ex-husband.",
        "Lily: What are you suggesting?",
        "Emma: Well, nothing, Lily. Nothing. It's just, you know, Darling, I know you. And you seem to be a little more than upset about all this.",
        "Lily: Of course I'm upset. Damian has a dark side, and I had to find that out the hard way. I'm trying to spare my son and Meg. Can you blame me?",
        "Emma: No, no. You know, we try to protect people that we love, but sometimes we just can't control what people do. Okay? You just have to -- you just have to take care of yourself.",
        "Lily: In other words, \"Mind you should focus all that attention on Holden and the kids and this wonderful trip you're going to have.",
        "Emma: You know, let it go for a while.",
        "Lily: That is exactly what I'm going to do. As soon as Holden calls, I'm gonna be on that jet, and Meg and Damian will be a distant memory.",
        "Emma: Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. You're going to have a wonderful trip. You and Holden deserve it.",
        "Luke: Grandma! Did you bring me cookies?",
        "Emma: Yes, Luke, Dear. Now, I want you take a lot of pictures. Nice ones, now. Not naughty.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Emma: See you later. Have a safe trip.",
        "Luke: Bye, Grandma. So, you ready?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm just waiting for your dad to call.",
        "Luke: You're kidding me.",
        "Lily: Luke, he called before, and he was already headed south. I mean, he should be at the fairgrounds by now.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Luke: Oh, must be him. Speak of the devil.",
        "Lily: It's about time. Holden!",
        "Officer: Pardon me, Ma'am. Are you Mrs. Snyder?",
        "Lily: Yes, this is Lily Snyder. Who's this?",
        "Officer: I'm afraid there's been an accident.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Mm. This is our way of telling your family that we're together. That I'm a part of your life. And Eliza's.",
        "Meg: By family, do you mean Lily?",
        "Damian: Lily. And Holden. And Emma, too.",
        "Meg: I have to confess, after Paul and Dusty, the last thing I was looking for was another relationship.",
        "Damian: You mean you weren't looking for a repeat of what you had with them.",
        "Meg: No. I swore off men. Well, not officially, but it had to take somebody pretty amazing for me to let them back into my life. Especially after the damage that Paul did.",
        "Damian: And did you find what you were looking for?",
        "Meg: I found exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't be happier. And I still can't believe it. It's like a dream.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, wait until you see the Argento mare. Meg, what is it?",
        "Meg: I haven't felt this safe in a long time. You know, it's been a long time for me to trust that somebody wants the same things I want. And the last few years, I've been always waiting for things to go wrong. I don't feel that anymore.",
        "Damian: Am I as boring as that?",
        "Meg: No. Far from it. You are the most exciting man I've ever met.",
        "Damian: That's more like it.",
        "Meg: Well, it's true. You know, just when I think I've seen it all, you do something else to amaze me. I've never felt anything like this.",
        "[Eliza crying]",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Meg: Oh, well, Eliza has timing. I'll give her that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What's going on?",
        "Lily: That was the Kentucky state police. A truck went off the road near Shelbyville. They're saying it was Holden's.",
        "Luke: Is Dad --",
        "Lily: They don't know. They don't know anything.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, what are we gonna do?",
        "Lily: I'm going down there right now. I am going to find your father.",
        "Luke: Okay, I'm gonna go with you.",
        "Lily: No, Luke. You've got to stay here and take care of Ethan and Faith.",
        "Luke: Mom, Mom, I can't let you go by yourself. I mean, what am I gonna do? Just sit here waiting? I'd go crazy.",
        "Lily: Luke, I need you to be here in -- in case --",
        "Luke: No, Mom, Mom, Mom. That's exactly why I'm going with you. You don't know what you're gonna see down there. Dad would want me to go with you.",
        "Lily: All right. All right. Then we're gonna leave right away. I'm -- I'm gonna call your grandmother and -- and tell her to get the jet ready, and she'll take care of the kids.",
        "Luke: They thought we were gonna go on vacation.",
        "Lily: Well, we'll just tell them that your dad got delayed, that he -- he had to work a little longer than expected. Thank God Natalie's still in camp. The thought of having to tell the three of them -- no. We're not gonna tell them anything, not until we know.",
        "Luke: Mom, what if --",
        "Lily: Luke, no! Don't -- don't say it, okay?! We don't know anything. We just thought the truck was in an accident.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but they said it was his.",
        "Lily: Luke, it could have been stolen. There are a lot of things that could have been happening. Your dad is fine!",
        "Luke: Okay, well, what about -- what about -- what about Grandma Emma? What do we tell her?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Nothing. We're not telling anybody anything. Not until we know what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: The important thing now is that Kim gets better.",
        "Tom: You're right. You're right. He's not going to let anything happen to her.",
        "Margo: No, of course not. So you know what? I'm gonna go get some things. I'm gonna get some toothpaste and some magazines. And I'm gonna get her a pillow. I remember the last time I was at Memorial, I felt like they took a band-aid and bent it over for me to put my head on. Will you please, please stop worrying about Riley?",
        "Tom: What beef does he have with Casey now?",
        "Margo: Honey, I don't know! I think it might have something to do with Alison. I mean, no surprise there. But, Honey, you got to -- you got to let it go. Because you know what's gonna happen if Casey thinks that you're interfering in his love life. Okay?",
        "Casey: By pretending you know more about my girlfriend than I do. I'm not interested.",
        "Riley: She needed someone to talk to.",
        "Casey: Oh, but not you! You are a bad influence. And if outing you is gonna stop you, I have no problem doing that.",
        "Riley: You won't do it.",
        "Casey: Try me.",
        "Riley: I didn't hurt anyone!",
        "Casey: Oh, yeah? Okay, because of you, Alison went to Kim, and she almost died because of Granddad. So all these problems that are happening is because of you, broseph!",
        "Tom: What does Alison have to do with what happened to Kim?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Think carefully before you answer me, Alison. Are you accusing me of giving my wife an overdose of thrombolytic?",
        "Alison: No. I mean, not in those words. It's just that I respect you too much not to tell you the truth.",
        "Bob: There has to be another explanation.",
        "Alison: I wish there were, but when I first walked into the room, you were doing something with the I.V., and I -- I didn't know what it was. I thought you were maybe straightening out the lines. But now I realize that you adjusted the drip. Anyway, we then went outside and talked, and then I left, and I came back a few minutes later to check on Kim, and she had gone into shock.",
        "Bob: Now, first you blame me for giving Riley Morgan an overdose. And now you're saying I nearly killed my wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Look at that smile. I have to confess, I haven't been around a little girl much.",
        "Meg: Well, they are different.",
        "Damian: Thank God for that.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Meg: Do you have to get that?",
        "Damian: It's Luke. Hello, son.",
        "Luke: Hey, Damian. I have to talk fast. I'm not supposed to be calling you. But I didn't want Meg to leave on the cruise without -- without knowing what's going on.",
        "Damian: Why? What's happened?",
        "Luke: It's my dad. It's Holden. Mom didn't want me to tell anybody in case -- until we know something for certain, but I just -- I thought that Meg should know in case, uh --",
        "Damian: Good thinking. Listen, I know you'll be a big help to your mother, but if you need anything, just let me know.",
        "Luke: I'll call you later.",
        "Meg: What is it?",
        "Damian: It's about your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I spoke to Mother. Everything's all set.",
        "Luke: You're bringing Dad's bag?",
        "Lily: I packed a few things. If he was in an accident, he -- he might need something clean to wear. Luke, he's all right. He has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know, this can't be happening. Not to Holden. It must be a mistake. He probably got out of the car. And you said that they didn't find him.",
        "Damian: Not yet, but --",
        "Meg: Well, that's because he probably walked away to get help.",
        "Damian: I hope so.",
        "Meg: What if he didn't get away? What if he's --",
        "Damian: Meg -- Meg, don't know enough to say anything, so let's take it one step at a time. All right?",
        "Meg: I have to do something. I have to help find him. What if he's hurt?",
        "Damian: We're hundreds of miles away.",
        "Meg: Can we go to Kentucky? Can you take me there?",
        "Damian: What about Eliza? I mean, I don't think it's the best place for her to be.",
        "Meg: What am I supposed to do? Sit around here and drive myself crazy?",
        "Damian: No. I think you should get home as soon as possible. I'll get you there.",
        "Meg: Mama, does she know?",
        "Damian: No, Lily didn't want anyone told until she had all the facts.",
        "Meg: She's right. But when she does get them, somebody needs to be there. I need to get to her.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, we'll go to the airfield right now. I'll get you back to Oakdale as soon as I possibly can.",
        "Meg: Thank you. I'm so sorry about the trip.",
        "Damian: Forget about the trip. There'll be other trips. This is family. Nothing's more important than this. I'll call the pilot, tell him to be on standby. Your mother will need you. And Luciano will need me, too.",
        "Meg: You're going to Kentucky?",
        "Damian: I have to be there for Luciano. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You got to be making this up. Don't you think I would remember if you said that you were responsible for my wife's collapse?",
        "Alison: I did tell you, Dr. Hughes. Okay, I'm sorry if you don't recall it, but it is the truth. You were so kind to me. You -- you told me not to blame myself. You said that she had had a prior heart condition and that you forgave me. Please, please try to think back to any of it.",
        "Bob: I can't, because it didn't happen. I spent a few minutes with my wife, and then I went to lie down.",
        "Alison: After we talked.",
        "Bob: No.",
        "Alison: Okay, maybe you did lie down for a minute or two, but that was after you did something to the I.V. and you were only gone for a few minutes when she crashed.",
        "Bob: Do you know what you're saying? This is impossible. There are other things that are possible, but not this. You keep hammering away at me. It's like you did before. Maybe I should have you screened for drugs.",
        "Alison: Go ahead. I'm not high. And I know what I saw.",
        "Bob: Do you know what she means to me? I would never harm my wife.",
        "Alison: Okay, I know. Its okay, Dr. Hughes. It's fine. It's gonna work out. She's okay now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nurse: Dr. Hughes, your wife is asking for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Ali was with Kim when she collapsed, talking about Granddad. Her theory is that he's losing it.",
        "Tom: Are you telling me that Alison caused Kim to have a heart attack?",
        "Riley: No way.",
        "Tom: You know what? She's barely out of nursing school, by the skin of her teeth, I might add, and now she has, what, the nerve to accuse the chief of staff of forgetfulness, of malpractice?",
        "Riley: When I was in the hospital, my heart stopped --",
        "Tom: You know what? Nobody's talking to you! This is a family matter. What are you doing here?!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Yeah, hi.",
        "Alison: Hey. I know you probably don't want to talk to me.",
        "Casey: I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. What's up?",
        "Alison: It's Kim. Your grandfather's been too preoccupied to call, but she's had a setback. And I know that he would never call himself, and he'd probably fire me if he found out I called you, but -- I think he needs his family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: I'm sorry, folks, I can't let you through.",
        "Lily: I'm Lily Snyder. I'm Holden Snyder's wife. You called me in Oakdale. We flew right here. Have you found my husband?",
        "Cop #2: Not yet. The scene's still too hot.",
        "Lily: Hot? What do you mean? Where's the truck? I need to see it. Oh, my God, Holden. It's all burned up.",
        "Cop: The vehicle exploded on impact.",
        "Lily: Its okay, Luke. It's okay. They can't tell anything from here. It could be anybody's truck. My husband isn't in there. You've made a mistake.",
        "Cop #2: This is how we contacted you, Ma'am. It must've come off halfway down the ravine. Haven't been able to get any closer.",
        "Luke: Wait, you mean my dad could still be down there, alive, and you guys can't get to him?",
        "Lily: What are you waiting for?! He could be hurt or dying! Get the hell down there!",
        "Cop #2: We can't until we get the all-clear.",
        "Lily: Fine. If you won't go down there, I'll go down there myself. Let me go. Let me go! Holden! Let me go!",
        "Luke: Mom -- Mom, please. You can't do this. Please, it's too dangerous.",
        "Lily: He's in there. I know he's in there.",
        "Luke: Mom, you saw the truck. If he was in the fire --",
        "Lily: Don't. Don't you say it, Luke. Holden! Were coming! We're gonna get you out! We're gonna get you out of there!",
        "Luke: Mom, please stop it. You're just hurting yourself.",
        "Lily: Luke, just go. Holden!",
        "Luke: No, no, I'm not going anywhere. We are not going anywhere. We're staying right here until we know something for sure.",
        "Lily: He's alive, Luke. I would feel it if he weren't. I would.",
        "Luke: Okay, Mom. Okay. But can we just let the police do their job? For Dad.",
        "Lily: I can't. Can't you understand? I can't let him go. Let me go! Let me go!",
        "Damian: Lily!",
        "Lily: No!",
        "Damian: I can't let you do this! I can't. You can't go down there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: What are you doing here? Did you and Damian have a fight?",
        "Meg: No, no, nothing like that. The cruise had to get postponed again. Something about the ship.",
        "Emma: Well, I was just at Lily's earlier. If I didn't know she was on her way to Kentucky --",
        "Meg: No, it's not her fault. Something just came up. And it's probably for the best, because Eliza has been crying nonstop ever since we left.",
        "Emma: Oh. She's quiet as a little angel now.",
        "Meg: Well -- cried herself to sleep. Yeah, I think she's teething, and I feel like the worst, most helpless mother in the world. I had no idea what to do.",
        "Emma: My mama always said that the only thing for a teething baby was to rub a little bourbon on their gums. Or ice chips work just as well. Except for Holden. The only thing I could do to quiet him was to take him -- to take him to the stables. Uh -- are you gonna tell me now why you're really home early? Hmm? You know, I know you. I know when you're telling the truth. You gonna tell me the real truth now? What happened?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, Mama. I can't.",
        "Emma: Oh, that bad, huh?",
        "Meg: No, I didn't say that. And don't give me that look. And don't try to bully me. Because I could be just as stubborn as you are.",
        "Emma: Meg --",
        "Meg: I am not telling you anything. Not until there is something to tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Deep breaths, Cara. Deep breaths. It's going to be all right.",
        "Lily: What are you doing here?",
        "Luke: I called him.",
        "Lily: Luke, I told you not to tell anyone.",
        "Luke: I know, but he and Meg were gonna be at sea, and I thought that was a bad idea, in case Meg had to -- had to come home quickly. Look, I'm sorry, but I felt like I had to do it.",
        "Damian: You did the right thing, Luke. If I'd been at sea when Luke called, unable to get to you, to both of you, I don't know what I would have done.",
        "Lily: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Damian: You need to rest. Come on, Lily. Let's get you someplace safe.",
        "Lily: No, I'm waiting for Holden.",
        "Damian: Lily, it'll be a while before the police can sort things out.",
        "Lily: I don't care.",
        "Damian: I understand, but there's nothing we can do here except be in the way.",
        "Lily: I need to be here when they bring Holden up.",
        "Damian: Lily, let's find someplace safe, and I'll ask one of the officers to call us the instant they know something.",
        "Lily: Damian, you're not listening to me! I'm not going anywhere with you! I am waiting here for Holden.",
        "Luke: Mom, that could take a while.",
        "Lily: I don't care! He could be suffering. That's why I need to stay, to make sure that they do everything they can to get him out. He needs me. And I won't let him down.",
        "Damian: Lily -- you've seen the wreckage. This was obviously a very serious accident. The truck exploded.",
        "Lily: I know what the truck looked like. I saw it. But you can't tell me that he couldn't have survived. He's down there, one way or the other, and I am not gonna leave until they find him. So you guys can just go. I will wait here. And I won't give up hope.",
        "Damian: Of course. As you wish. Stay with your mother. There's something I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Don't you have your prayer group today?",
        "Emma: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Meg: Snyder's.",
        "Damian: Are you with your mother?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Is everything okay?",
        "Damian: I'm at the site of Holden's accident. Meg, I'm so terribly sorry.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you for calling.",
        "Emma: Strangest thing happened a little while ago. I was -- I was down at the barn, and Holden's favorite horse started kicking at the stall, like there was a fire or something. I talked to him until he quieted down. And then, just for a moment, I -- I had this very strong feeling that Holden was -- was in the barn with me. Meg, has something happened to Holden?",
        "Meg: Oh, Mama, I hope not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Did I have another heart attack?",
        "Bob: No, no, thank God. No, with recovery, sometimes there are ups and downs, but nothing to worry about.",
        "Kim: Then why do you look so worried?",
        "Bob: I'm not, now that I see those beautiful eyes of yours open. Honey, you're gonna get through this. I'll take care of you.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Bob: I always have, and I always will.",
        "Alison: Dr. Hughes, your family's here.",
        "Tom: Hey, Dad. You look like hell.",
        "Margo: What happened?",
        "Bob: Kim was given an overdose of an anticoagulant.",
        "Casey: What does that mean?",
        "Tom: Well, is she okay?",
        "Bob: There was risk of internal bleeding, but we caught it time with platelets and plasma.",
        "Casey: If you want, I could run to the blood bank.",
        "Bob: Oh, no, no, no. Thank you, but she's fine. She's stabilized.",
        "Tom: I mean, I don't get it, Dad. You've been by her side ever since she's been here. How did she wind up with an overdose? I mean, it's got to be in her file. Who else was caring for her besides you?",
        "Bob: Well, I supervise everything that she's given, but I'd taken a short break to lie down, and then she crashed.",
        "Tom: Well, I don't -- I don't get how something like this happens, Dad.",
        "Margo: Excuse me, nurse? Did you see anything?",
        "Nurse: Alison was already in the room when I got here.",
        "Tom: Are you saying Alison gave her the overdose?",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ali.",
        "Tom: What do you have to say for yourself?",
        "Alison: What happened to Kim was unintentional.",
        "Tom: What the hell is wrong with you, going after Kim twice in one day?",
        "Alison: Why would you say that?",
        "Tom: Casey told me all about it.",
        "Casey: Dad, hold on.",
        "Margo: Tom, what are you talking about?",
        "Tom: She was in the room with Kim when she had the heart attack.",
        "Margo: Well, yeah, but --",
        "Tom: Therefore, if she hadn't said whatever she had to Kim that upset her so much, it probably would have never happened.",
        "Casey: You don't know that!",
        "Tom: Oh, you were convinced as hell when you were arguing with Riley!",
        "Alison: Oh my God! I never meant for any of this to happen!",
        "Tom: I need you to get out of here, or I'm gonna have you arrested.",
        "Alison: I didn't -- there were circumstances that had nothing to do --",
        "Margo: You know what? Alison, Alison, Alison, why don't you just go? We'll sort this out later. You should go. Tom, do you really think this is the time or place for this?",
        "Tom: Yes, I do. If Kim dies --",
        "Bob: She's not going to.",
        "Tom: I know, Dad. And I'm sorry, but look, this girl is careless, criminally so, and if you want to press charges, I'll back you the whole way.",
        "Bob: Look, I -- I can't deal with this right now. I've got to concentrate on taking care of my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Alison, hold up! Please, will you?",
        "Alison: Leave me alone, Casey. I just want to be by myself for a while.",
        "Casey: Forget it. You're upset.",
        "Alison: Maybe that's because the chief of detectives and the ex-D.A., who happen to be your parents, think that I'm guilty until I'm proven even more guilty. Oh, and by the way, I'm the worst nurse in history.",
        "Casey: No one thinks that of you, least of all, me.",
        "Alison: Well, you'd better hurry up and get with the program.",
        "Casey: Stop right now. I just -- I just really want to know what happened.",
        "Alison: You heard. I almost killed Kim.",
        "Casey: But you didn't.",
        "Alison: Of course not!",
        "Casey: Then why didn't you defend yourself? Something's not right with you, Ali. Why didn't you tell us the whole story back there?",
        "Alison: Would you believe me even if I told you the truth? Or would you just assume that I was lying to save my own butt? Never mind. I already know the answer.",
        "Riley: Hey, hey, Alison. Hey, come here. You look like you're gonna pass out. What happened?",
        "Alison: I just got myself into a huge mess, and I don't know how I'm gonna get out of it without destroying Bob Hughes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I was serious before. I think we should press charges and stop Alison before this happens again.",
        "Casey: Dad, you don't know what you're talking about. This isn't Alison's fault.",
        "Tom: Casey, your girlfriend screwed up. What if Kim had had a stroke and wound up paralyzed? How would you look at Alison then?",
        "Margo: Tom, Tom, don't.",
        "Tom: Hey, this is about taking responsibility for your mistakes, something that Alison doesn't seem to be willing to do.",
        "Margo: She seemed pretty devastated to me.",
        "Tom: Did she? Did she hand in her resignation?",
        "Margo: Well, no --",
        "Tom: Then we need to take steps. Because I am legal counsel for Memorial. So it's my job to protect the staff and the institution from malpractice lawsuits, and Alison is a danger to every patient in this hospital. And I'm not gonna stand around and watch that happen.",
        "Casey: Dad -- Dad, sorry. I know you're angry. So am I. But you don't know what you're talking about. Alison wouldn't hurt anyone. She's too careful. Especially after what happened to Riley. So Kim getting overdosed, that had to be someone else's mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: It can't be true. It's not Holden's time to go. I brought him into this world. And I would -- I would sense if -- if he were not here any longer.",
        "Meg: Mama, Damian was at the crash site. He said there was no way anybody could have survived.",
        "Emma: They didn't find the body, Meg. They didn't find the body, and I refuse to believe it.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, okay, Mama.",
        "Emma: He needs our strength, Meg. He needs our strength.",
        "Meg: For what? We can't go back in time. We can't do anything.",
        "Emma: We can pray. We can pray.",
        "Meg: Okay, I can do that. You know, Damian has a way of getting things done. He is gonna do everything in his power to make sure that he finds Holden.",
        "Emma: I hope you're right, Sweetheart. I hope you're right.",
        "Meg: I know I am. And if Holden still is alive --",
        "Emma: Don't! Please, Meg, don't even think that! Don't! He is alive. Let's pray. Dear God -- dear God, please -- please, please protect our Holden.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: It's going to turn chilly when the sun goes down. Are you warm enough?",
        "Luke: Do you want me to get you a blanket?",
        "Lily: No, Sweetheart, I'm fine.",
        "Damian: How about a cup of coffee? You need to put something in your stomach, Lily.",
        "Lily: I just want to wait for Holden.",
        "Luke: Well, at least have some water, Mom. You're so pale.",
        "Lily: What is it?",
        "Cop: We found a body down by the wreckage. This was nearby.",
        "Luke: It's Dad's.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Is Kim still okay?",
        "Tom: She's sleeping. The drug reaction really kind of wiped her out. They said don't expect her to be strong enough for visitors tonight, but I'm -- I'm gonna stick around for Dad.",
        "Margo: Okay, so it looks like we're staying.",
        "Casey: Why don't you say how you really feel, huh?",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Casey: That you're planning to stay here so you can go after Alison.",
        "Margo: No, we're thinking no such thing.",
        "Casey: No, just give her the benefit of the doubt. You don't even know what really happened.",
        "Tom: I think it's pretty obvious what happened, Casey.",
        "Casey: So forget justice, just like that.",
        "Tom: Your feelings for your girlfriend are getting in the way.",
        "Casey: And yours for Kim aren't? I mean, don't be a hypocritical, Dad.",
        "Margo: Okay, I swear, if you two don't stop arguing --",
        "Casey: Well, what do you think, Mom? Did she do it?",
        "Margo: I think she's not making much of an effort to defend herself. If she didn't mismanage Kim's meds, then why doesn't she just say so? Why is she being so vague about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: So you didn't actually tell anyone that it was Dr. Hughes who gave his wife the overdose?",
        "Alison: I couldn't. I mean, I tried to warn his family without, you know, accusing him, but I don't know. Maybe it's because of all the stuff I did in the past. But they didn't believe a word I said.",
        "Riley: You can't let this go, Alison.",
        "Alison: But you should have seen his face. I mean, he got really defensive, but underneath it all, he's scared. This strong, powerful man, he doesn't know what he did. I mean, for him to accept that he hurt the love of his life, it would kill him. And I'm not willing to accept that responsibility.",
        "Riley: You know, most people would be worried about their own situation. But you're ready to risk everything just to spare Dr. Hughes' feelings.",
        "Alison: What am I gonna do?",
        "Riley: I'm gonna help you. You know, you're not the only one who saw the guy looking confused. I mean, I was with him when he forgot how to work his pager. That thing has probably been surgically attached to his hip since the '80s.",
        "Alison: They all are.",
        "Riley: I'll talk to Tom and Margo, and I'll tell them the truth.",
        "Alison: Great. Well, you're not exactly Tom's favorite, either.",
        "Riley: You can't do this alone, Alison. They'll hang you. All right? You'll lose everything you worked for.",
        "Alison: I know, but --",
        "Riley: No, no, no. You know I'm right about this. Let's go tell Tom and Margo the truth.",
        "Alison: No, I can't do that to Casey's family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Well, I'm not gonna let somebody in my family get hurt if I can stop it.",
        "Casey: Whatever you say.",
        "Tom: You know, I think it's time for you to listen to me on this one. You need to stay away from Alison for a while.",
        "Casey: I think I'm a little old for you to tell me who I can see.",
        "Margo: Yes, yes, yes, you are. But you stay away from Alison, because apparently she's gonna be facing criminal charges.",
        "Casey: Oh, my God. You wouldn't do that, would you?",
        "Tom: Trust me. I'll do everything in my power to make sure Alison Stewart never works in this hospital one more day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This watch belonged to your grandfather. He planned on giving it to you someday. I'll keep it for just a little longer.",
        "Luke: Of course. Yeah. You should hold onto it.",
        "Damian: There's nothing you can do here, Lily. I phoned ahead to the airfield. If we leave now, we can be back in Oakdale before anyone hears the news.",
        "Lily: I can't leave Holden here all alone. I can't just walk away from him.",
        "Damian: He's gone. Holden's gone.",
