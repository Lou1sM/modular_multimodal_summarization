        "Dusty tried to convince Craig that Paul is no threat. Carly convinced Rosanna to tell Craig that she wants a child. Hal was worried that Susan may be covering for Rick, because that could make her an accessory to his crimes. With Alison's statement as ammunition, Tom tried to get a search warrant for Rick and Susan's home, but he was unable to do so. Alison and Chris decided to search the house on their own, since they wouldn't need a search warrant. Susan told Rick she would stick by him, but after Emily made her confront her doubts, she told him she couldn't keep standing up for him. When John told Marshall Sarah's age and her medical disorder, Marshall started putting the pieces together, and had Zara's casket exhumed. Jessica told Bonnie that if Bonnie didn't tell Marshall about Sarah, she would. Bonnie told Isaac they needed to get Sarah out of the country immediately."

        "Dusty: So Paul Ryan had his arms around your wife? What's the problem? I tell you right now, that guy's the last guy in the world who would hit on your wife.",
        "Craig: Because?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause he knows better, and he's not interested.",
        "Craig: Who wouldn't be interested in Rosanna?",
        "Dusty: A guy who's obsessed with his ex-girlfriend.",
        "Craig: Exactly. Plus, he's got psychotic parents, plus he can't get out of his own diapers, and now, he's suddenly decided he wants to be really, really mad at me.",
        "Dusty: So what? Why would your wife ever be interested in a guy like that, anyway, huh?",
        "Craig: She's complicated.",
        "Dusty: Let me share something with you, pal -- women are not that complicated.",
        "Craig: Oh, no?",
        "Dusty: No. And I'll say one thing about your wife -- she seems like a very smart woman. She sees what a loser Paul Ryan is.",
        "Craig: Yes, you're right. He's a loser. So what does she want?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you ask her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: So I said it out loud. I want a baby.",
        "Carly: And you're already glowing.",
        "Rosanna: I must sound so foolish.",
        "Carly: You don't.",
        "Rosanna: Even if it were possible, I'm -- I'm dreaming.",
        "Carly: No, you're not. Rosanna, you're gonna let a hysterectomy keep you from living your dreams? There are a million babies out there who need a good home.",
        "Rosanna: I didn't mean that I couldn't have a child because of the surgery.",
        "Carly: Well, then what's stopping you?",
        "Rosanna: Not what -- who.",
        "Carly: Okay, I'll bite. Who?",
        "Rosanna: Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Look, I know you girls want Decker shipped off to Alcatraz , but if Susan says that she was with him all night, that's his alibi.",
        "Alison: I was there, Hal. I was there. His car was gone, and he was nowhere in that house.",
        "Hal: You're sure?",
        "Alison: I'm positive.",
        "Hal: And how long were you in the house?",
        "Alison: Um, about a half an hour.",
        "Emily: See, he was at the motel room getting rid of Jeffery Starr's things.",
        "Chris: And getting rid of Jeffery Starr.",
        "Emily: We've got him, Hal.",
        "Hal: That's not all we've got.",
        "Emily: What? What's with the look? I don't like the look.",
        "Hal: Susan's sticking to her guns on this?",
        "Alison: Well, kind of. He told her that he was getting an aspirin, and he moved the car because the street was being paved.",
        "Hal: And she bought that?",
        "Emily: Of course she did! She -- she loves him. She believes him.",
        "Hal: Emily, I hate to say it, but if Susan is covering for Decker, your mother could be an accessory to first-degree murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Oh.",
        "[Susan laughs]",
        "Rick: Tired?",
        "Susan: Exhausted, and I still have rounds to make.",
        "Rick: Well, I'll give you a back rub later. Any word on Bob?",
        "Susan: Um, yes, and it's not good. I just spoke with Ben. The increased brain activity seems to have leveled off.",
        "Rick: Well, what's Ben's prognosis?",
        "Susan: Bob could be in that coma for a lot longer than anybody thought.",
        "Rick: Oh, dear, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry for everyone. Bob is a great man.",
        "Susan: I should get back to work.",
        "Rick: Hey, wait a minute. This is about us, isn't it?",
        "Susan: Please, Rick, not now.",
        "Rick: No, you're angry at me for having an argument with Alison, right?",
        "Susan: I know she pushes your buttons.",
        "Rick: Susan, I am trying, I really am, but Alison is determined to think the worst of me. She and Emily, they're not going to quit until you think the worst of me, too.",
        "Susan: That's not true.",
        "Rick: Of course it is. We both feel it.",
        "Susan: I don't think you appreciate what a hard place this is for me.",
        "Rick: All right, Susan --",
        "Susan: With you pulling in one direction and my kids in the other.",
        "Rick: Susan, we have to put an end to this, once and for all. And there's only one way to do it -- you have to decide who you want in your life, me or your daughters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So you say you think this girl is working for someone?",
        "Marshall: Someone who's hatched a plan to ruin me. I don't know why, but they're trying to use my DNA to do it.",
        "John: Who would want to get you that badly?",
        "Marshall: You can't repeat this to anyone, John.",
        "John: That goes both ways, you know. They find out I'm sharing patient information with you, I've got a severe problem on my hands.",
        "Marshall: Understood. It's Bonnie McKechnie. She never got over the rape trial, she wants revenge, and she will use this child to get it.",
        "John: So you think it was Bonnie that stole your toothbrush?",
        "Marshall: Yes. Now, maybe she thinks she can use it to manufacture evidence to set me up as some sort of repeat offender. I don't know. But Bonnie's up to something. Why else would she go through so much trouble to get a sample of my DNA?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You can't keep this information from Marshall .",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I can, and I will.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, it's wrong.",
        "Bonnie: It's wrong to have Sarah anywhere near Marshall .",
        "Jessica: Sarah is his child.",
        "Bonnie: By a fluke of biology, mom.",
        "Jessica: He needs to know, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Why?! So he can do what he does best -- destroy people's lives?! Because that is exactly what he does, mom! He destroys lives! You -- you of all people should know that better than anybody!",
        "Jessica: No, you know what I know? I know what it means to have a child in your life, and I will not deprive anyone of that experience, not even Marshall Travers. Look, Bonnie, you are -- your heart's in the right place, honey, but your logic is all wrong. Now, Marshall has to hear the truth. If not from you, from me -- right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You cannot be serious.",
        "Hal: Emily, it all depends on how much Susan knows.",
        "Emily: Hal, my mother could never look us in the eyes if she were covering for Rick.",
        "Alison: Let alone drop off an anniversary gift.",
        "Hal: I hear you, but the longer this goes on, the more we have to wonder what Susan knew and when Susan knew it.",
        "Emily: You know, the hardest thing about all of this is realizing how lonely my mother must have been to hook up with a guy like Rick in the first place.",
        "Alison: Well, she probably just bought his lies because she's totally alone again.",
        "Chris: Hal, how do we use what Alison knows about that night?",
        "Hal: Maybe we can get a search warrant. If we can find something in that house that incriminates Decker, we can get Susan off the hook.",
        "Chris: Let's do it.",
        "Hal: I'm gonna need Alison to come down to the station with me.",
        "Chris: All right. I'm coming, too.",
        "Hal: We'll ride together?",
        "Emily: No, uh -- I've got to take care of something first.",
        "Hal: That sounds important. Do you want some help?",
        "Emily: No, thanks. I've got to do this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I don't want to have a fight, not -- not here of all places.",
        "Susan: Good, because I'm not about to choose between you or my children, and it's not fair of you to ask.",
        "Rick: Well, what options do we have? They're not gonna let go of this, and I just don't think that I can do it anymore.",
        "Susan: Do what?",
        "Rick: Feel like a stranger in my own home, in my own life.",
        "Susan: Rick, I can't shut my children out of my life. Motherhood, like it or not, is forever.",
        "Rick: I thought marriage was forever. I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to be hurtful.",
        "Susan: It's not you, it's this situation. It's -- its put unspeakable pressure on all of us, and all we can do is live our lives and try to show the rest of the world we have nothing to hide.",
        "Rick: You know, I think you're the strongest woman I know.",
        "Susan: I'm not strong. I'm just stubborn. I'm not about to give up the man of my dreams to -- to a lot of hospital gossip and half-baked theories from small-town cops.",
        "Rick: Do you really -- do you really believe that much in me?",
        "Susan: I believe in us. We can't let this situation rob us of our future or me of my kids. I won't let it happen.",
        "Rick: You don't know how much I needed to hear that. [Pager beeps] uh -- see you for coffee later?",
        "Susan: I'll page you. I love you.",
        "Nurse: You have a call at the desk, Dr. Stewart.",
        "Susan: Oh, thank you, Melissa. Dr. Stewart.",
        "Emily: Hey, mom, it's me. Listen, I know you were just here, but we need to talk.",
        "Susan: Emily, I'm working.",
        "Emily: I know. Can't you find someone to cover for you? It's important.",
        "Susan: If this is about Rick -- I don't want to be in the middle anymore. If you have something on your mind, talk to Hal, talk to your sister. I can't take sides. I just told the same thing to Rick.",
        "Emily: And I understand that.",
        "Susan: Well, good. If you want to play detective or say bad things about Rick, just do it with somebody else.",
        "Emily: All right, look, mother, I love you. I'm not grand-standing here, but this cannot wait. You need to get over here as soon as you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: I've seen some bizarre cases in my career, John. There doesn't have to be a shred of truth in any charge, just enough innuendo or bad press, and a person's career or reputation is ruined for life.",
        "John: And you think that it's Bonnie that's out to ruin you like this?",
        "Marshall: The DNA information was gained illegally. A judge won't look at it, and she knows that. But she also knows that because I was on trial before, she can probably drum up some bad publicity.",
        "John: You're making an awful lot of assumptions.",
        "Marshall: Maybe, but I can't sit around and wait for her to strike. I was accused of rape, John. It won't take much to get the press' attention.",
        "John: I just think it's a long shot that Bonnie is --",
        "Nurse: Excuse me, Dr. Dixon, but records just sent the updated file on Sarah Smith.",
        "John: Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Marshall: John, if there's anything in there that ties this child to the stunt Bonnie pulled, I have to know, and I won't stop until I learn everything there is to know about this Sarah Smith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, why do you keep putting me in this position over and over again? I am not trying to run your life, and you are too old for me to have to remind you the difference between right and wrong.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I'm sorry if Sarah's safety inconveniences you.",
        "Jessica: I am just trying to get you to see the big picture here. There are rules, there are laws for a reason.",
        "Bonnie: Your rules and your laws, they didn't keep Marshall behind bars where he belongs, did they, mom?",
        "Jessica: That still doesn't give you the right to ignore them. What you're doing is illegal. It's unethical.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, so I'm supposed to be ethical when you and I both know Marshall has no ethics whatsoever.",
        "Jessica: So what makes you better than him right now at this moment?",
        "Bonnie: Are you comparing me to the man that raped you?",
        "Jessica: No, sweetheart, I am not comparing you. I am just trying to get you to see that you are better than he is!",
        "Bonnie: Well, maybe I can't afford to be if it means compromising Sarah's safety.",
        "Jessica: Shouldn't Sarah have a say in this matter?",
        "Bonnie: No, no.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie --",
        "Bonnie: She's a kid, she's vulnerable, and all Marshall 's gonna try to do is charm or buy his way into her life. And you know what? It may work for awhile, but sooner or later, that real person's gonna come out, and it's gonna be Sarah who gets hurt.",
        "Jessica: Right now, all I know is that for you to keep this information from either Marshall or Sarah is wrong on every standard of human decency. Now, I know you are too emotionally involved to see that, so I have to see that for you.",
        "Bonnie: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who are you calling?",
        "Jessica: I'm calling Marshall .",
        "Bonnie: No, mom, you can't! If you tell Marshall he is Sarah's father, I will never forgive you!",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, that's just the risk I'm gonna have to take.",
        "Bonnie: Really? So how will it feel to give Marshall his daughter back, only to lose yours?",
        "Jessica: Are you blackmailing me?",
        "Bonnie: No. I'm just trying to be honest with you. If you can't support me on this, how can we ever be close again?",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, I -- I can't support your acting in such a destructive way.",
        "Bonnie: Letting Marshall know the truth is destructive for Sarah.",
        "Jessica: And when the truth comes out anyway?",
        "Bonnie: It won't.",
        "Jessica: How do you know? Marshall 's already wary of you. If he starts snooping around, he could find out about --",
        "Bonnie: Mom, he won't find out anything unless you tell him.",
        "Jessica: Okay, let's say I keep your secret, and Dr. Daniels keeps your secret, and Isaac keeps your secret and the genetics lab keeps your secret. Marshall could start digging around and find out anyway and find out that you already had this information. And he could come after you, Bonnie, and I know how ugly that man can get when he's out of control, and I am not gonna let that happen -- not to my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Now, listen. Marshall , I can't open up this girl's entire file to you. With these new laws, I shouldn't even be giving you her name.",
        "Marshall: John, I am very familiar with the new emphasis on privacy issues, but I'm also very familiar with client-attorney privilege. And I'm not adverse to repaying favors any way possible.",
        "John: I don't even know if any of this information is gonna be useful to you.",
        "Marshall: Well, let me be the judge of that. Hey, John, I -- I've got to know everything there is to know about this child, or I'm at Bonnie's mercy.",
        "John: You told me that you were interested in her biological parents, and there's nothing in here about that.",
        "Marshall: Well, what is in that file?",
        "John: Okay, okay, take it easy. All right, for what it's worth, Walker Daniels was treating her for Leishmaniasis.",
        "Marshall: Well, what is that?",
        "John: Well, it's a rather rare, infectious disease that's carried by sand flies, but that's in mostly tropical countries. You know?",
        "Marshall: Like what? Where?",
        "John: Like the Sudan , like India -- Brazil .",
        "Marshall: Brazil ? You're sure?",
        "John: Yeah, it looks like she was from Brazil . She is from Brazil , but she must have contracted it down there before she came to the States.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Craig was really wonderful when I had my surgery. He never made me feel less than a complete woman.",
        "Carly: Yeah, he can be pretty good during the low points.",
        "Rosanna: You know, it was his idea for us to get remarried again. It was so romantic. I just love being with him. He's so much fun. It's just such a wild ride, and I love it. But I've never stopped wanting to have a baby. You know, I think when I found myself falling in love with him, that's when I really started dreaming of having a family.",
        "Carly: And you never said any of this to him?",
        "Rosanna: I didn't want to scare him off.",
        "Carly: What makes you think he'd be scared?",
        "Rosanna: Because he's lost a son, and he worries constantly about Lucy. I think that he sees being a parent as somehow staving off disaster constantly, and it's clouded a lot of the wonderful moments. I think that sometimes that he was so supportive during my surgery because it meant it really let him off the hook, that he wouldn't have to walk that particular tightrope again.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, you love this man?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Carly: And you love his daughter?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I love her. She's so wonderful. But she has a mother, you know? Sierra's her mother. They have a private little world I can't even barely peek into, and you have that with Sage.",
        "Carly: And you will have it. You will have it one day, too.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe.",
        "Carly: And it brings us back to Craig. You -- you've got to talk to him, Rosanna. You stare down thousands of stockholders. What's one maddening, charming, egotistical husband?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I just -- I don't know what to expect.",
        "Carly: You've got to talk to him. You're deciding how Craig feels and what he thinks, and that's not fair to either one of you. Go to him. Tell him how much you love him, and when he gives you that sly, silly grin, drop the bomb. Tell him you want a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Contracts look fine.",
        "Dusty: We're a little over budget on the lighting, but believe me when I say it's gonna be well worth it.",
        "Craig: Fine, fine.",
        "Dusty: Now, do we have to run this by the other half or what?",
        "Craig: No, Rosanna trusts me.",
        "Dusty: Do you trust her?",
        "Craig: Paul Ryan?",
        "Dusty: Oh, God, stop thinking about Paul Ryan, would you? [Craig laughs] he's after my girl anyway, not yours. Please. And after what that punk has turned into, no woman is gonna give him the time of day anyway. Paul Ryan is not a fun guy, anymore.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, he never was.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Give me your take on the inventory when you're done.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah. Hello.",
        "Carly: Hi, Craig, it's me.",
        "Craig: You who?",
        "Carly: Can it. This is serious. Where are you?",
        "Craig: At the former Java Underground.",
        "Carly: Okay, stay there. You're gonna have some company.",
        "Craig: Oh, goody. Pleasant company expected?",
        "Carly: You better believe it.",
        "Craig: Any how to receive mystery guest?",
        "Carly: Lovingly.",
        "Craig: Then let me guess, it must be -- Carly? Carly?",
        "Carly: He's at Java Underground.",
        "Rosanna: That's no place to have this kind of discussion.",
        "Carly: Well, if you wait for the perfect time and the perfect place, you may never have it. Now march yourself over there, and you tell that man you want a baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Open the casket. I want to see my daughter now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do you think there was the slightest chance that Rick is lying to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do you think it would be okay if we could adopt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Craig: What are you -- what are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Oh, that happy to see me, huh?",
        "Craig: Well, I was expecting your sister.",
        "Carly: She's parking the car.",
        "Craig: Oh, where's -- well, where's Sage?",
        "Carly: Emma popped in, so --",
        "Craig: And released you from your domesticity?",
        "Carly: Oh, you see? It's cracks like that that are gonna get you in trouble.",
        "Craig: Well, pardon the obvious, mom.",
        "Carly: I'll pardon you. Rosanna may not.",
        "Craig: Why aren't you parking the car?",
        "Carly: Because I -- I wanted to be alone with you for a minute or two, so --",
        "Craig: Why, Carly -- I thought we were beyond all that.",
        "Carly: Oh, please. Would you just listen to me for once, all right? Rosanna is gonna come through those doors at any moment now. And I don't want you to be an idiot. I don't want you to blow it.",
        "Craig: Blow what?",
        "Carly: That woman is absolutely crazy about you. And you -- you have made her want things in her life that -- that she didn't even know that she wanted.",
        "Craig: She said that?",
        "Carly: Yeah. So I just -- I want you to listen, okay? Don't react. Don't give your opinions. Just keep on listening, all right? Until it's time not to. Ah -- there she is. So I gotta run, okay? Just keep your ears open, your mouth shut, and you'll be great.",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Where are you going?",
        "Carly: Home. Emma called my cell phone. Sage is a little fussy. So I'm gonna -- I'll take a cab.",
        "Rosanna: I'll drive you.",
        "Carly: No! No, you are not gonna blow this chance.",
        "Rosanna: Ah, what were you doing? You were talking to Craig?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I was just -- helping him along with his listening skills.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Thank you. Wish me luck.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, good luck.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Hello.",
        "Craig: Beer nuts?",
        "Rosanna: No. No, thank you.",
        "Craig: There's not much else.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I'm not hungry. I didn't come for the food.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "[Rosanna laughs nervously]",
        "Rosanna: This is a very strange place to be having this conversation.",
        "Craig: About what?",
        "Rosanna: Oh -- the big talk.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: \"The big talk.\" I thought you knew how much I love you.",
        "Rosanna: I love you, too.",
        "Craig: Oh, really?",

        "Craig: Neither are you.",
        "[Rosanna laughs nervously]",
        "Rosanna: Hold that thought. Hmm.",
        "Craig: What? Since when do you have trouble holding back your feelings?",
        "Rosanna: Since I'm about to put all of our fun and games at risk for something that means more to me than anything in the entire world.",

        "Marshall: Dr. Daniels is sure it's Brazil ?",
        "John: Yes, says so right here in the records.",
        "Marshall: Exactly how old is she?",
        "John: I think I've given you enough already.",
        "Marshall: Damn it, John. How old is she? 15. Zara would've been 15.",

        "Nurse: No, she left a little while ago.",
        "Rick: Oh, did she say why?",
        "Nurse: She got a call from her daughter, and signed out right after that.",

        "Susan: Don't thank me. Just tell me what was so important that I had to leave work.",
        "Emily: Why don't we sit down?",
        "Susan: Every awful conversation I've ever had with you starts with, \"why don't we sit down, mom?\"",
        "Emily: I heard something today.",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Emily: Alison told me Rick was not there the other night when she came to pick up her things.",
        "Susan: Honey, Rick explained all that. He -- he was upstairs, getting aspirin.",
        "Emily: Getting aspirin at the exact same time Alison was there, and for as long as she was there?",
        "Susan: Yes! What do you want me to do? Do you want me to swear on a stack of bibles, take a lie-detector test? You were supposed to stop accusing him. You promised me.",
        "Emily: I am trying to, but I cannot ignore what Ali just told me.",
        "Susan: What about Rick? What he says doesn't matter?",
        "Emily: Look, I'm not attacking you. I'm -- I'm trying to protect you here.",
        "Susan: I don't need protecting!",
        "Emily: Mother, in your heart, do you really believe he was there the entire time you were sleeping?",
        "Susan: What is this? A plot? Some trap to get me here alone and win me over to your side?",
        "Emily: Mother, there are no sides here.",
        "Susan: What do you want from me?",
        "Emily: The one thing you always give Ali and me -- the truth. Do you think there is the slightest chance that Rick is lying to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So basically, we've got Alison's word against Decker's. And no judge is gonna issue a warrant based on that alone.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Tom: Because we need probable cause. Did anything turn up on Jeffery Starr thing?",
        "Hal: No. He's still officially listed as missing.",
        "Tom: Any evidence suggesting that Decker may have been involved?",
        "Hal: Just my gut, Tom. Now, I know that's not --",
        "Chris: Look, Tom, we've gotta do something.",
        "Tom: Chris, I'm just trying to look at this as any judge would. Personal feelings aside, we need more to get a warrant. May I please use your interrogation room to check in with my office?",
        "Hal: Sure. Go ahead.",
        "Tom: Thanks.",
        "Chris: So, Hal, what do we have to do to get probable cause? Wait for Decker to slip up?",
        "Alison: Drop a needle, kill more people, even hurt my mom?",
        "Hal: Nobody's gonna hurt your mom. Without a warrant, he could have a tub of potassium chloride in that house. Decker would still walk free. Just sit tight. I'll be right back.",
        "Hal: How do I get my hands on that warrant, Tom?",
        "Hal: Well, then we get basis. We take what we have. We stretch it thin, but we make it work!",
        "Tom: And how do I do that?",
        "Hal: Tom, Susan is living with this guy. If he is cornered, what's gonna stop him from going off? I can't be with Emily and the kids 24/7.",
        "Tom: I understand how you feel, but my hands are tied.",
        "Hal: Damn it, Tom. He has access to Daniels. Not to mention your dad at the hospital.",
        "Tom: I'll see what I can do, but no promises.",

        "Susan: Baby, he needs me. I shouldn't even be here.",
        "Emily: I need you. I need you to take a step outside of your relationship with Rick for just a few minutes and look at everything that's happened. After a string of deaths where Rick is suspected, suddenly he survives an attack? And then we find out he takes potassium chloride in med school to flatline?",
        "Susan: Baby, that is not the big deal you think it is.",
        "Emily: A reporter -- listen to me. A reporter who wants to write a negative story on Rick turns up missing, the same exact night that he says he's with you?",
        "Susan: We've been over this.",
        "Emily: You're defending a man who doesn't deserve it, and you know it. I know you see the truth, and it's okay to see the truth.",

        "Susan: Baby, it doesn't matter what happened that night. I know there was a reason -- a reason that he couldn't share with me.",
        "Emily: Yeah, his reason is what I'm afraid of the most. What is the real truth here, mom?",
