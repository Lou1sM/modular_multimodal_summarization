        "Dusty: So what now? Skinny-dipping? Star-gazing? Or hay-baling?",
        "Meg: Dessert. [Meg laughs] Wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Dusty: Wait for what? Your mother to come home? Maybe we should do dessert at my place.",
        "Meg: No I wasn't talking about dessert me. I was talking about dessert pie. Excuse me.",
        "Dusty: You made a pie?",
        "Meg: I bought a pie. And no cracks about my cooking, or there won't be any other desert -- you know.",
        "Dusty: Ever? Can I tell how much I like pie?",
        "Meg: Oh, you'll get pie. Right in the kisser.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Dusty: Kiss her? I'll give you a kiss.",
        "Meg: Pie.",
        "Dusty: Later.",
        "Meg: Now.",
        "Dusty: Why now?",
        "Meg: Well, sweets are always sweeter when you have to wait for them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Did you hear that, Jack? She threatened me. I think you should arrest her.",
        "Will: You can't do that.",
        "Carly: Yes, he can.",
        "Jack: Yes, I can. But I won't.",
        "Gwen: Because your husband knows I'm right. I carried that baby and I gave birth to him. You've got no right naming him behind my back.",
        "Carly: Did you think Rosanna wasn't going to give him a name? You keep acting like you didn't sign your rights away, and that's exactly what you did.",
        "Gwen: To your sister! Not to you!",
        "Carly: Well, I have custody, now. And that's not going to change!",
        "Will: Okay, Gwen, you know what? I think we should go.",
        "Gwen: And let her push me out of my kid's life? No way!",
        "Carly: Will, I think you should talk some sense into her.",
        "Will: Why? This is Gwen's decision to make, not mine.",
        "Carly: And it was her decision to give the baby up for adoption. You thought that was a good idea, didn't you?",
        "Will: I guess. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Well then, so what's changed? She still has no idea how to take care of a baby.",
        "Gwen: Stop saying that. You don't know anything about me.",
        "Carly: Will, please, do what's best for your son.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you think you've got it all figured out, don't you, lady? Except for one thing. Will's not the father.",
        "Carly: Oh, he isn't? Then who is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Well, I'm glad to see you haven't lost your appetite.",
        "Casey: Oh, I get it. So dinner and the talk about my summer job, that was just a warm-up, huh?",
        "Bob: You're my grandson. I enjoy spending time with you.",
        "Casey: And Mom and Dad wanted you to talk to me.",
        "Bob: Well, they're concerned about you. So am I.",
        "Casey: I'm totally fine. You know, I already told them that, like,a thousand times. I'm eating, I'm sleeping, I'm fine.",
        "Bob: And you're barely talking to your best friend. Why is that?",
        "Casey: I have nothing to say to him. What?",
        "Bob: That's exactly what will said when I asked him about this.",
        "Casey: What else did he say?",
        "Bob: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But, clearly, he's angry with you. Why?",
        "Casey: Who knows?",
        "Bob: Well, your folks think that this trouble began when you and Celia broke up.",
        "Casey: Right. See? Mystery solved.",
        "Bob: No, that's not it. I mean, if will stole your girl, why would he be angry with you? It should be the other way around.",
        "Casey: Who knows?",
        "Bob: You know, Casey. Now something happened between you two guys. Something big enough to wreck a really good friendship. Don't let that happen. Find a way to fix it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: That's my baby.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, listen to me. All right, we're gonna get you home. Come on, let's get you home.",
        "Jennifer: No, Paul. No Paul, I heard his cry. My child is in there!",
        "Paul: Hey. That can't be.",
        "Jennifer: I know. But it is. He's alive. I heard his cry. That's him.",
        "Paul: Jen, listen to me. Stop. Just stop it! Right now.",
        "Jennifer: I know it doesn't make any sense. I know it doesn't. But you have to trust me on this, okay? My child is in there. He's in there crying for me.",
        "Paul: It's not possible.",
        "Jennifer: I can't explain it to you. But I know he's in there. I know he's in there. I heard his cry. I heard his cry when the first time he was born. It's the same cry!",
        "Paul: You're imagining things.",
        "Jennifer: No, not this time! I heard him, Paul I heard him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hot yet?",
        "Meg: Getting warm. Apple pie's better that way.",
        "Dusty: So I hear.",
        "Meg: And there is no reason why we can't pick up later where we left off.",
        "Dusty: No reason at all.",
        "Meg: Thank you. So, read any good books lately?",
        "Dusty: No, too busy I guess.",
        "Meg: Yeah, me too. You know, there's this new sci-fi movie I've been wanting to see. Too busy for that, too?",
        "Dusty: No, I was actually going to ask you if you wanted to see that one sometime this weekend.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? Yeah, great. That'd be great.",
        "Dusty: Come here often? Want to know my sign?",
        "Meg: I already know it.",
        "Dusty: You know my favorite brand of scotch. My first car --",
        "Meg: Baby blue.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Aren't we past all this?",
        "Meg: What, past the talking? Past having a conversation?",
        "Dusty: No. We're doing a lot of talking, we're doing a lot of kissing, and we're doing a lot of talking.",
        "Meg: Well, that can't be all we ever do. I mean, it shouldn't be.",
        "Dusty: What do you want, Meg?",
        "Meg: I want -- I want more than just dessert.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: My baby.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. What did you just say?",
        "Paul: Emily, take the baby inside.",
        "Emily: Paul, what's going on?",
        "Paul: Emily, take the baby inside right now. Are you okay? Jennifer, are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why do you care whether or not I speak to Will? I mean, if we're meant to be friends, then we will be. And if he's ticked at me, he'll either get over it or he won't. So what?",
        "Bob: I'm just trying to understand you. I mean, if this is about Celia, and she's out of the picture --",
        "Casey: It's not the point.",
        "Bob: Why not? If you guys are fighting over a girl, and the girl is gone, why can't you get your friendship back on track?",
        "Casey: Because of Gwen, all right. All because of Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I'm not leaving here. Not without my baby.",
        "Will: Gwen, get real. That's not going to happen. Not today. Maybe not for weeks. If you want your baby back, you're going to have to take them to court.",
        "Gwen: You think I won't do it?",
        "Will: Believe me, my money's on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Granted, she showed up loaded for bear, but you're not helping the situation at all by lighting into her. I think we should go home, and deal with this when everyone's had a chance to calm down.",
        "Carly: No, not until I get an answer to my question, Jack. Hey, you let everybody believe the baby is Will's. Why? And if he isn't the father, then who is?",
        "Gwen: That's none of your business.",
        "Carly: Anything that has anything to do with my sister's son is my business.",
        "Minister: Perhaps you'd rather discuss this in my office. The sanctuary is hardly the place for --",
        "Jack: Yes Reverend, we were just leaving. Let's go. Now.",
        "Gwen: They just get to take him home? There's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Will: Gwen, I think we should go.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Will: Because if Carly starts in again, then you're probably going to take a swing at her. Then you'll never see Rory again.",
        "Gwen: Rory? What kind of get your butt whipped in school name is that, anyway?",
        "Will: I think they were trying to name him after Rosanna.",
        "Gwen: Oh well, that's okay, I guess. She was a nice lady, not like her sister.",
        "Will: You ready?",
        "Gwen: He's mine. You can't change that. The law's on my side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Why did that girl say the baby was hers? Is she going to take him away?",
        "Carly: No, honey. That's never going to happen.",
        "Bob: You know, I think you should cut Gwen a little slack. She's had more than her share of problems. Giving up her baby for adoption, leaving the hospital before she should of.",
        "Casey: So I guess you felt sorry for her. Yeah, I think will did, too. I think that's why he said he was the father.",
        "Bob: But he wasn't.",
        "Casey: That's how this all got started.",
        "Bob: How did what start?",
        "Casey: It's just -- Gwen's made a lot of bad choices, okay? And every time that I've been there to call her on it, Will's been right there by her side.",
        "Bob: I don't want to put you on the spot. But did you ever realize how extraordinarily easy your life is compared to Gwen's?",
        "Casey: Sure. I guess.",
        "Bob: You guess, huh? I mean, even today, young girl in Gwen's situation is looked down on by her peers. I hope that isn't the situation with you.",
        "Casey: It's not. I don't look down on her. I just --",
        "Bob: You know, when you found out that, what you thought, Will was the father of the baby, how did you feel about it?",
        "Casey: What do you mean?",
        "Bob: Well, were you angry? Were you disappointed?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Bob: Will doesn't need your compassion right now. Maybe you could transfer some of that to Gwen. You know, one mistake does not make her a bad person.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Bob: Casey, is there something that you want to --",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Casey: Hello? Oh hey, Lia. What's up? Yeah, hold on a sec. This my friend from school. She only has a few minutes to talk. Do you mind if I --",
        "Bob: No, no, no, go ahead.",
        "Casey: All right, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: I hate christenings.",
        "Parker: Me, too.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe we can do something to change that. How would you boys like some cake and ice cream to celebrate?",
        "J.J.: Me!",
        "Parker: Me!",
        "Carly: Well okay. Let's go into the kitchen and get some for everybody. All right?",
        "Emily: I'll take him. I am the godmother.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Emily: I promise I won't drop him.",
        "Carly: All right.",
        "Emily: Let me have 'em.",
        "[Whispering to baby]",
        "Jack: Whoa, kind of an intense day, huh?",
        "Emily: Uh, yeah.",
        "Jack: Well, thanks for coming home with us, Em. Everybody needed to kind of decompress.",
        "Emily: Oh, I know. It's not like I needed to be anywhere. Daniel's still at sleep-away camp. You know, it feels so good to hold a baby again.",
        "Jack: What happened to Paul? One minute he was playing Godfather, the next he kind of disappeared.",
        "Emily: Jennifer showed up.",
        "Jack: Oh, I must have missed her.",
        "Emily: Well actually, she never came inside the church. She kind of had a meltdown when I walked outside with the baby.",
        "Jack: Really? What happened?",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Emily: You know what? I feel like I shouldn't even talk about it.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Emily: I don't know. It's weird. It's okay, buddy. Jack, she thought Rory was hers.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Emily: I mean, I know losing a baby has been very hard on her. It would be for anyone, but I think for Jennifer, it's been harder than any of us thought.",
        "Jack: She really thought that Rory was the baby she lost?",
        "Emily: She looked at him and said, \"He's mine.\" And then Paul -- I mean she would have taken him right out of my arms if he hadn't pulled her away. It was heartbreaking.",
        "Jack: So Paul took her home?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Well, thank God he was there.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Jack: What is it, Emily?",
        "Emily: I don't know, Jack. She just seemed so desperate to look at him.",
        "Jack: Okay, what happened after she got a look at him?",
        "Emily: See, that's just the thing. Paul wouldn't let her near him.",
        "Jack: Okay, if she was acting irrationally, I understand that, I guess.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. Jack, no, no, she wasn't going to hurt the baby. Think about it. If she could have just looked at him for one second, she would have seen immediately that he wasn't hers. And that would have been that.",
        "Jack: You're probably right about that.",
        "Emily: But he wouldn't let her have just even a glimpse of him. Why? Jennifer isn't delusional. She's a woman grieving.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well you're thinking like a woman. He was probably thinking like a man.",
        "Emily: Meaning what?",
        "Jack: Well I mean, he was protecting everybody. You, Jennifer, especially the baby.",
        "Emily: Yeah. He's just got so much going on, you know? Losing Rosanna, his nephew dying. I just wish he would let me help him.",
        "Jack: Okay, you want some advice from a guy? Don't ask if you can help, don't offer, don't suggest. Just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jennifer, you had no business going to that church. I don't know why you went to the church.",
        "Jennifer: I wasn't going to. But, I changed my mind.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Jennifer: It's silly. I ran into this woman.",
        "Paul: Who?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know, I don't know. I'd never seen her before. But we were at the diner and we started talking. Don't -- don't look at me like that. It was a perfectly legitimate conversation.",
        "Paul: What did she say?",
        "Jennifer: She told me that she had also lost a baby.",
        "Paul: And you thought that was some sign that you should go to the christening for Rosanna's baby?",
        "Jennifer: You think I'm losing it, don't you?",
        "Paul: I think your whole world has been shattered. I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have said that that way.",
        "Jennifer: No, but it's true. That's how I feel. You know, like I just -- I feel like I'm in pieces.",
        "Paul: So why did you tempt fate by coming to the church, jen?",
        "Jennifer: I thought it would help.",
        "Paul: How? How did you think it would help?",
        "Jennifer: It seems silly now.",
        "Paul: Well, I can do silly.",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna's baby and my baby were born at the same time, at the same hospital. And I just thought that maybe by being close to her baby that it would help me feel close to my little boy again. I know -- I know that none of this makes any sense.",
        "Paul: Well, it's over now. You need to put it out of your head.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, when I heard him cry --",
        "Paul: Jennifer, all babies cry. And all babies sound exactly the same.",
        "Jennifer: Is that true? Because that's what I used to think. But this one sounded different from every other one that I heard before, Paul. And it set off something inside me -- something really powerful, so powerful that it felt like he belonged to me. And the only other time that I ever felt that was when I heard my baby cry right after he was born.",
        "Paul: Don't, don't, Jennifer stop. Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Jennifer: But it was like -- it was like I had him back for that one moment. And now that I know that he's gone, he's gone for good, I don't know if I can ever be happy again, Paul. Ever again.",
        "Paul: Okay, that's not true. Jennifer, that is just not true. You will be happy again. I promise you.",
        "Jennifer: You sound so sure. How do you know? Tell me.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Carly: Did you see how Gwen reacted when I asked who the biological father was?",
        "Jack: Yeah, she was angry.",
        "Carly: I bet she hasn't even told the guy that he's a daddy.",
        "Gwen: I'm raising the baby on my own and he wants nothing to do with the baby.",
        "Paul: It's for the best.",
        "Emily: What's for the best?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jen, some losses are for the best in the long run.",
        "Jennifer: No, don't start that again. Telling me that I'm better off. I'm not, Paul.",
        "Paul: You didn't have the same father I had, okay? You don't know what I know. James Stenbeck and Craig Montgomery are from the same cloth. They are the -- they are the same person. If your baby had lived, he would have had a miserable life. And your life would not have been worth living.",
        "Jennifer: I refuse to believe that.",
        "Paul: If I could have spared you this grief, Jennifer, I would have. I swear to you, I would have spared you.",

        "Paul: Well, I'm just trying to look out for you, trying to do right by you.",
        "Jennifer: And thinking of it that way, of him being in a better place? Does it make it easier for you to do this?",
        "Paul: Do what?",
        "Jennifer: Go on.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Yeah, it does.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. All right then. New rules. From now on, I will try to see him in that better place.",
        "Paul: Do you think you can do that?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. Yeah. I'm gonna do it for myself and for you.",
        "Paul: For me?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I never realized. I lost a son, but he was your family, too. I know you loved him. And I know that you're not gonna be able to get past this until I do. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get past this. So don't worry so much, okay? Because I will -- I will get through this. I will.",
        "Paul: Let's get you upstairs, and you can lie down a little bit, maybe get some rest.",
        "Jennifer: No, I don't need to.",
        "Paul: Well, do you wanna stay down here? You wanna hang out here? We'll get something to eat.",
        "Jennifer: Go home. Paul, I'm really -- I'm gonna be okay. I'll sit and watch -- you know, what the people, let them distract me and think about him being in that better place.",
        "Paul: I can stay.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I know I was out of it before, but didn't I hear you yell at Emily back at the church?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you did. I was very upset. I was worried about you.",
        "Jennifer: You'd better get home then, because you've got some apologizing to do. Go on.",
        "Paul: You sure you're gonna be all right?",

        "Jack: Hey, Parker. Don't you want some cake?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Jack: Something else on your mind?",
        "Parker: The baby doesn't really look like that girl at the church.",
        "Jack: All babies look like Elmer Fudd to me, so --",
        "Parker: But if they really don't look alike, couldn't that mean --",
        "Jack: It could mean he looks like his dad. Because Gwen is his birth mother, son.",

        "[Meg and Dusty thinking]",
        "Meg: Meg, don't be stupid. The man wants you. What the hell do you need him to talk for?",
        "Dusty: What is wrong with you, Donovan? You can't even make a little conversation? \"How was your day, Meg? I mean, that's a very pretty dress on you. Very shapely.\" The dress is probably new and you didn't even say anything, you moron.",
        "Meg: Okay, he's not gone yet. I can pull this out of the fire.",
        "Emma: Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hi, Emma.",
        "Emma: What are you doing out here?",
        "Dusty: What have you got there?",
        "Emma: I got some things for the church bazaar.",
        "Dusty: Let me help you.",
        "Emma: Where's Meg?",
        "Dusty: We -- she --",
        "Emma: Should I -- should I leave?",
        "Meg: Go, Mama, go.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, don't go. Join us for dessert. We have pie.",
        "Meg: Hi, Mama.",
        "Emma: Hi, hi. Well, Dusty's just inviting me to join the two of you for a piece of pie. I hope that's all right with you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, sure. Sure it is. Come on in.",
        "Emma: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Hello, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Hi. Oh, hi, Dr. Hughes. I'm sorry, I was --",
        "Bob: Preoccupied?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Bob: So, how have you been?",
        "Gwen: Oh, I've had better days.",
        "Bob: Missing your baby?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. But at least I'm doing something about it. I'm trying to get him back.",
        "Bob: From the adoptive parents?",
        "Gwen: Well, not exactly. I mean, people did adopt him, but a bunch of stuff happened. Anyways, I want him back.",
        "Bob: I see.",
        "Gwen: Which, translated, means you don't think it's a very good idea.",
        "Bob: No, no, no. It means I reserve judgment. I assume you have a plan.",
        "Gwen: Yes, sir. I do.",
        "Bob: And you're going to handle this by yourself? I mean, a baby is a lot of energy, a lot of time and a lot of money.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, actually, that's the best thing. I've got enough money now to give him everything that he needs.",
        "Bob: You do?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bob: What happened?",
        "Gwen: Well, it's kind of hard to explain, but my lawyer says that I'll have enough money to take care of him as well as anyone else could.",
        "Bob: Well, that's one good thing.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. And I'll be able to quit working here, so I can spend that time with the baby.",
        "Bob: And school?",
        "Gwen: Well, I'll be able to hire a babysitter or whatever to take care of him when I'm in class.",
        "Bob: You'll be able hire help?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I mean, but I'll do most everything for him by myself. I'm kind of looking forward to that. Feeding him and bathing him.",
        "Bob: Changing his diapers.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah, that too. And I've got a real good friend who's willing to help me out.",
        "Bob: Well, it sounds like you've touched all the bases. Except one.",
        "Gwen: What's that?",
        "Bob: What about the father? What's his role going to be in this?",
        "Gwen: I'm raising the baby on my own.",
        "Bob: And you and the father made this choice together?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I'm down with it and he's made himself very clear -- he wants nothing to do with the baby.",
        "Bob: Hey, Casey. I thought you'd taken off. Grab a chair.",
        "Gwen: Actually, take this one. I should be going.",
        "Bob: No, no, come on, stay a minute. Let me buy you a milkshake or a banana split -- whatever. I insist. Hey. Hey, Will. Come on, join us.",
        "Will: Hi, Uncle Bob. I don't think I can, actually. I'm just here to pick up Gwen. We got that thing we have to be at, right?",
        "Gwen: Sure, yeah, I remember. It was nice talking to you, Dr. Hughes. Casey.",
        "Casey: Well, looks like we're right back where we started.",
        "Bob: It will be harder to get you guys together then I thought.",
        "Casey: Yeah, seeing as how he hates me.",
        "Bob: But why, Casey? Look, he's a friend. You don't give up on a friend. At least, I don't think you should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: How was dinner?",
        "Meg: Well, I put too much Tabasco in the sauce, and I burned what was in the oven. Other than that, it was perfect.",
        "Dusty: It was perfect.",
        "Meg: Actually, Dusty ended up feeding both of us.",
        "Emma: Oh.",
        "Dusty: Like I said, I had a wonderful evening.",
        "Emma: Well, I'm happy to hear that. Even though the kitchen looks like a bomb hit it.",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's me. I'll clean up.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. I'll deal with it. Really, I will. It's getting late. You have to get going.",
        "Dusty: Goodnight.",
        "Emma: Goodnight, Dusty.",
        "Meg: Thank you for coming.",
        "Dusty: Not at all. Come here. I meant what I said. I did have a great time.",
        "Meg: You're just trying to be nice.",
        "Dusty: When have I ever said anything to be nice? I had a great night. We're good.",
        "Meg: Just not good enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jen, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry with all of my heart. But I have to do this. It's for the best.",
        "Emily: What's for the best?",
        "Carly: Well, I think the boys had some fun once we introduced the cake.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: I think they've really accepted Rory into the family.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: What's up with you?",
        "Jack: I think we should be careful not to build up J.J. and Parker's hopes until we know what's happening with this baby.",
        "Carly: We're keeping the baby.",
        "Jack: Okay, Gwen has a good case though, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack, I think we might have a secret weapon.",
        "Jack: What's that?",
        "Carly: Did you see how Gwen reacted when I asked her who the biological father was?",
        "Jack: Yeah, she was angry.",
        "Carly: She was defensive. I bet she hasn't even told the guy that he's a daddy. And he may be the Achilles' heel in her custody case.",
        "Jack: Or not.",
        "Carly: Jack, I know I'm right about this. Our best chance of keeping Rory is to find out who his father is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'm sorry it took so long to park the car. What did I just walk in on?",
        "Gwen: Dr. Hughes was asking me about the biological father, if he was going to pitch in and help raise the baby.",
        "Will: Wow. How'd that come up?",
        "Gwen: Well, I was telling him about how I'd changed my mind about the adoption. And I could tell he didn't think it was a great idea. But at least he didn't go crazy on me, like Carly.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm sorry, Carly and Jack were way out of line for going ahead with the christening when they knew you were still trying to decide about the adoption. What?",
        "Gwen: Nothing. It's just um -- I know you have doubts about what I'm doing.",
        "Will: Maybe, a few.",
        "Gwen: And I know you're real bummed about Celia leaving town.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm pretty bummed.",
        "Gwen: But you're still here for me. The only one I can count on.",
        "Lawyer: Ms. Norbeck?",
        "Gwen: Oh, hi. I'm sorry. I thought we'd be able to meet inside. Is it okay with you if we meet somewhere else? Um, this is Will.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Will, this is my lawyer, Albert Parks.",
        "Lawyer: We can keep this quick. We've been granted a court date for the adoption hearing.",
        "Gwen: When?",
        "Lawyer: Tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Casey, about Gwen --",
        "Casey: Grandpa, you just saw for yourself. She's doesn't like me any more than I like her.",
        "Bob: Are you aware that she's gonna try to raise the baby?",
        "Casey: Yes, I am.",
        "Bob: It's not going to be easy for her.",
        "Casey: It's her choice.",
        "Bob: One that she didn't make lightly. Look, you're a great kid. You got a big heart. All I'm asking you to do is get past whatever issue you have with Gwen and help her as much as you can. She's in this alone. The father does not --",
        "Casey: Look, she has Will, all right? I'm done with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Well, I don't know. It doesn't sound like it was a disaster to me.",
        "Meg: Oh, please, Mama. Dusty practically tied you to the chair so he didn't have to spend another second alone with me.",
        "Emma: Well, he's trying to make a good impression on you by being nice to your mother. What's wrong with that?",
        "Meg: We even tried to have some, you know, plain old conversation, and it was awkward.",
        "Emma: Well, I don't know. First dates can be that way.",
        "Meg: First dates? Dusty and I -- there's nothing first.",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, this is the first time you ever cooked for him. What do you mean? It's the first time you've invited him over here since you've been back. And I assume, it's the first time you tried to have a conversation before you moved into something else.",
        "Meg: Oh, Mama, Mama --",
        "Emma: Listen. Listen to me. You always want things to be perfect, don't you? Don't you, my little girl? You have to relax. I mean, just take it easy. Take it easy. Know -- know in your heart that if this relationship is meant to move into something more, then it will.",
        "Meg: I hear you. So, stop making such a big deal of it.",
        "Emma: That's right.",
        "Meg: And it is a good idea. And I would probably be able to do it, if Dusty meant less to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. I don't know how I'm ever going to get through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Emily: Evidently.",
        "Paul: I owe you an apology.",
        "Emily: For?",
        "Paul: For yelling at you at the church.",
        "Emily: Oh, that.",
        "Paul: I didn't know what to do. I mean, Jennifer was completely out of control. And I needed to get her out of there. She was very upset.",
        "Emily: About the baby.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I told her not to come to the christening. And she comes anyway, and then -- look what happens. Everything falls apart. So, yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: Oh, another apology. You've been apologizing a lot lately.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Emily: Well, earlier at the church, you were holding the baby. You were apologizing to him about something.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I explained that to you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I heard you say that you were sorry about something.",
        "Paul: I think maybe you just misunderstood.",
        "Emily: I don't think so. I heard you say that you were sorry, and that this was for the best.",
        "Paul: I was stressed, you know. I was trying to sort things out. You don't ever do that? You don't ever talk to yourself?",
        "Emily: All right, would you stop it? All right, just cut it out.",
        "Paul: Try to figure out what's going on at a time like that?",
        "Emily: Something obviously is going on. You need to tell me --",
        "Paul: There's nothing going on.",
        "Emily: I don't believe you. I walked in on you and Jennifer earlier today. I got the distinct impression that the person you were trying to reassure was yourself, not your sister.",
        "Paul: You are imagining things.",
        "Emily: And then at the church, you were like a man possessed. You were doing everything you could to keep your sister from seeing the baby.",
        "Paul: She passed out, Emily! Soon as you went back inside the church, she fainted. That's how distraught she was over hearing another baby cry. I had to get her out of there.",
        "Emily: What's in the drawer? Or are you going to tell me I'm imagining that, too?",
        "Paul: Emily, let it go.",
        "Emily: I can't. Let go of my arm, Paul. What am I -- wrong foot. You were driving yourself crazy trying to figure out what Rosanna meant when she said \"wrong foot.\" Well, now you know, don't you? The baby -- its Jennifer's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: On the next, \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Katie: Guess I'll just have to go back home to Henry and Maddie.",
        "Jennifer: I know this sounds crazy, but I also know what I heard. My baby was here.",
        "Emily: If you're not going to tell your sister, then I will. Ow!",
        "Paul: No, you won't."
