        "Emily: So, did the accounting fairies show up while I was asleep?",
        "Paul: Yep, they sure did. But I was long done before those losers showed up. So, would you like to know exactly where your paper -- \"The Intruder\" -- stands down to the last nickel -- penny, almost?",

        "Will: Through the door. No, wait -- I'm not sure. I was really worried about Gwen.",

        "Casey: Your alibi's a liar.",
        "Margo: Would you stop, please?",
        "Casey: Mom, just check her story.",
        "Margo: Whoa, what a good idea. Now, look, guys, the lab guys are going to be here pretty soon. They're going to go over the place, gather any evidence that they need, and they're going to be lifting not only Will's footprints, but any other footprints they can find from under the bedroom window.",
        "Jade: Yeah, my guess -- a woman's size seven.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Jade: The other footprints. We all know who did it. Okay? Find Maddie Coleman and her shoes, and you'll catch the Oakdale Slasher.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There's really no magic involved. I just pulled out all the non- compensatory items and the depreciated assets, and it practically took care of its self.",
        "Emily: You are such a show off.",
        "Paul: You would have figured it out, eventually.",
        "Emily: Yeah. By Christmas, maybe.",
        "Paul: All right, so I generated a cash flow projection chart. And I put it on the desktop. And if you click on it, it'll show you \"The Intruder's\" monthly cash position --",
        "Emily: What, zero?",
        "Paul: Actually, your newspaper turned a little profit this quarter.",
        "Emily: Get out.",
        "Paul: Proving once again that the public really does have an insatiable appetite for junk.",
        "Emily: Even neglected junk. I mean, just imagine what I can do if I -- if I threw in a little creativity -- change the layouts, reshuffle the budgeting a little bit --",
        "Paul: Em, is this really the right time for all of that?",
        "Emily: Yeah, why not? What, because I'm pregnant?",
        "Paul: This job has stress written all over it.",
        "Emily: I can handle it.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, promise me that you'll let me help if you can't handle it.",
        "Emily: You've already helped. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Well, would it kill you to throw a little ad revenue at the right outlets? 'Cause if you did that, I'm sure the return would be -- what's wrong?",
        "Emily: Nothing, nothing --",
        "Paul: What's wrong? No, seriously, should I call Dr. Schiller?",
        "Emily: No, if I -- if I called the doctor every time the baby kicked, I would be on the phone 24 hours a day.",
        "Paul: He kicked?",
        "Emily: No, actually it was more like a forward roll with a twist.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Emily: Yeah. You want to feel?",
        "Paul: That's okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Yeah, of course it's okay. This is usually a good spot.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't feel anything.",
        "Emily: Okay, it's a baby, not a circus dog. Come on, Sweetie, show your daddy you're just having a little fun. What? What?",
        "Paul: You just called me her daddy.",
        "Emily: Well, you are the daddy. And the baby's a her now? Make up your mind.",
        "Paul: Well, I can't, it keeps changing.",
        "Emily: The baby?",
        "Paul: No, the future tense baby. Sometimes I see him, and he's wearing a monogrammed blazer, and other times she's bald and she's got kind of a ruffly thing on her head.",
        "Emily: She's bald? Those looks work for you?",
        "Paul: No, not at all, but I do get to decide because -- I am the father, at least part of the time. It's not just a word.",
        "Emily: No, it's a really big job.",
        "Paul: I know. And I'm up for it.",
        "Emily: We'll see.",
        "Paul: No, no. I have a plan, see?",
        "Emily: Oh, see, now that scares me. You always have a plan.",
        "Paul: No, not like that. Stop it. I'm going to do this -- whatever my natural instinct is, to do things the way I've always done them, I'm going to do the opposite. For instance, if I want to take control of the child's education, and send him to boarding school in, say, Europe --",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, no, no. What, are you kidding me?",
        "Paul: No, no -- opposite. I send him to public school in Oakdale. I call it my opposite plan.",
        "Emily: It's so dumb, but it might actually work for you.",
        "Paul: I -- I think that we can be great parents together as long as I don't do what it is that I want to do. What? Is that it?",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah.",
        "Paul: Oh! He's a linebacker -- or a Rockette. 'Cause that would be okay, too.",
        "Emily: You should feel it from the orchestra seats.",
        "Paul: It's unbelievable.",
        "Susan: Do I even want to know what's happening in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Let's hear it, Damian.",
        "Luke: Who is he?",
        "Holden: The truth.",
        "Damian: Sergio worked for the syndicate that kept me in hiding all these years.",
        "Holden: You told Lily that the danger had passed.",
        "Luke: And that he was a friend.",
        "Damian: I was contacted shortly before I came to Oakdale. Sergio's people were willing to make a deal.",
        "Holden: What kind of deal?",
        "Damian: They would end the vendetta so I could come out of hiding for a price.",
        "Luke: What kind of price?",
        "Holden: Where's the rest of his crew?",
        "Damian: There's no others that I know of. Sergio came to make sure that we returned.",
        "Luke: Why me?",
        "Holden: You needed his money, didn't you?",
        "Damian: I already paid him a great deal.",
        "Holden: But they wanted it all? That's it, isn't it?",
        "Luke: I don't get it.",
        "Holden: Your inheritance, Luke. They wanted everything that Damian had, including the money that he was going to give you.",
        "Luke: Is that true?",
        "Damian: Yes.",
        "Luke: Why didn't you just tell me? Were you going to trick me into signing it over or something?",
        "Damian: Luke, you must believe me, I had no choice. They would kill us both. It's never as simple as it seems to be.",
        "Luke: So what was going to happen after I gave you the inheritance?",
        "Damian: My wish was that you'd stay in Malta and live with me.",
        "Luke: But you're dying. I found those pills --",
        "Damian: Luke --",
        "Luke: No, you swore! You're sick, right? You wouldn't lie to me about something like that!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, your vitals check out. Hey, where's the ambulance?",
        "Dusty: There was an accident on the access road. The ambulance and the fire department will be here shortly.",
        "Meg: Okay, good. They'll follow you up to Memorial, okay?",
        "Lucy: Thank you, Meg.",
        "Dusty: You always carry that stuff with you?",
        "Meg: My patient's asthmatic. So what happened?",
        "Dusty: Oh, it's a long story.",
        "Meg: Yeah, the good ones usually are.",
        "Lucy: A friend of Damian's locked us in the cellar. He had a gun.",
        "Dusty: Damian wants to take Luke out of the country.",
        "Lucy: We've got to call Jack to stop them. We've got to get to the airport.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no, no, no. You relax. I'll do it.",
        "Dusty: You gotta use your cell. The lines blew up.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'll be right back. You take it easy.",
        "Dusty: How you feeling?",
        "Lucy: Better.",
        "Dusty: When are you gonna learn not to mess with people like that?",
        "Lucy: I didn't know Damian was so dangerous.",
        "Dusty: You're so gullible, you know?",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: For what?",
        "Lucy: Tonight. Look, I took Jennifer away from Johnny. And tonight, he almost lost you, too.",
        "Dusty: I made this my fight.",
        "Lucy: You could have been killed because of me. I've done nothing but hurt you since I've been back. Dusty, I never meant to do that. I never meant for any of that to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So you're saying that Maddie Coleman is our killer?",
        "Jade: Yeah.",
        "Margo: That's really hard to reason that, since she and Gwen are such friends.",
        "Jade: Not so much.",
        "Margo: What's she getting at?",
        "Will: Nothing.",
        "Casey: Tell her.",
        "Will: It's got nothing to do with tonight.",
        "Gwen: It really doesn't.",
        "Margo: Would somebody tell me what's going on?",
        "Jade: I saw Maddie tonight, and she threatened Casey and Gwen.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Jade: Because they're together.",
        "Gwen: That is not true.",
        "Casey: She's lying!",
        "Margo: No, is that true? Did Gwen move out because of you?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Casey: I just asked her to stay at our house.",
        "Gwen: He figured it would be safer for right now.",
        "Will: You know, I can find somebody to protect you.",
        "Casey: Oh, you?",
        "Will: Why don't you back off!",
        "Margo: All right, both of you back off! Let's just go back to Maddie. What's her stake in this?",
        "Jade: Do you want me to tell her?",
        "Gwen: You know what? She already knows that we broke up.",
        "Casey: Because of you. 'Cause you're a wrecking ball.",
        "Margo: Oh, would somebody please tell me what's going on?",
        "Jade: Will and I hooked up.",
        "Will: Just once.",
        "Jade: And Maddie went running and told Gwen.",
        "Margo: Oh -- is that true? Did she tell you?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Jade: And when the psycho found out that Gwen was moving in with her old boyfriend, she got really weird. And she kept saying how she couldn't let it happen.",

        "Dallas: I get that you wanted to stop Gwen and Casey. But what I don't get is how.",

        "Margo: I take it you and Maddie aren't real good friends, huh?",
        "Jade: Not even close.",
        "Dallas: If you wanted to talk to Casey, why hide?",
        "Maddie: I told you already. I got scared. I heard screams and I saw someone run out the door. So, I thought it was the killer coming after me again, so I hid over there.",
        "Margo: Did Maddie ever threaten you to your face? Gwen?",
        "Gwen: It wasn't a threat.",
        "Margo: Well, what was it?",
        "Gwen: She saw me with Casey earlier and she got kind of upset.",
        "Margo: What did she say exactly?",
        "Gwen: That I should stay away from Casey, because of Lia.",
        "Margo: What about Lia?",
        "Gwen: She said that Lia is dead because she got too close to Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: And did you get a look at the person who ran out of the cabin? What about size -- build? Big? Small?",
        "Maddie: No, I don't -- not big. The same size as the person that attacked me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I told you she's crazy.",
