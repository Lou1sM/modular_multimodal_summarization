        "Margo maintains that she took the day off to take care of her man, so why is Tom working as usual? They can only hope that Emily loves Casey enough to let him go. Likewise Emily catches her mother at the hospital checking on patients instead of resting. She gives her the good news that she is going ahead with the annulment, but that doesn't mean she and Casey are through. He doesn't care how old she is or what she will look like twenty years from now. Emily sees her niece, Dani, in the diner and they catch up on family history and Dani seems to approve of her Aunt Emily as a cougar to Casey. Parker doesn't show up at the train station from tennis camp. Carly calls Holden as she is worried and he meets her there. Jack eventually does too and the Snyder men exchange snide barbs. Jack throws it in Carly's face of what an example she is setting. If Parker lived with him at the farm, he'd have Janet move out.",
        "Parker surprises Liberty by showing up at her place. What's love in tennis when he has her? She manages to call her Dad and he accuses Parker of wanting a death wish and he's about to get it. Brad drags him home and Jack reads Parker the riot act and strips him of all in his pocket. He goes nowhere without Jack knowing about it. Jack lights into Brad as well who snaps back. He later tells Katie that he doesn't think anyone can get Parker to leave Liberty alone. Her solution is to arrange a planned date for Liberty so Parker will think she is no longer interested in him. Holden can't stay away from Carly and comes to her door to check on her. She tells him he can't be there, she can't need anything from him. For the sake of her children who Jack could threaten to get custody, she can not see Holden. She needs to let him go."

        "Tom: Come on. They replaced the stent, not my heart. I'm in better shape than I was before the surgery.",
        "Margo: Take the chair out of the way.",
        "Tom: Stop. I can get this on my own, really.",
        "Margo: How many times in our marriage have you been waited on hand and foot, huh?",
        "Tom: Not many.",
        "Margo: Okay. Then take it like a man. Come on. I almost lost you twice in the last year. Just let me -- let me hover and enjoy it, okay?",
        "Tom: Okay, hover away. But I'm not your only patient. How you feeling, Case?",
        "Casey: Um, I'm good.",
        "Tom: Good. How's Emily?",
        "Casey: Back to normal. Speaking of which, uh, I actually have news that will probably speed up your recovery faster than Mom will. Emily and I are getting an annulment, so our marriage is officially over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Unbelievable. I'm sorry. Did -- did Bob not give you strict orders to stay home and rest at least a day?",
        "Susan: Oh. This from the woman who insisted on leaving the hospital early so she could put her newspaper to bed?",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, the story about Decker needed to be told.",
        "Susan: And I needed to check on my patients. Why are you here? Are you having a relapse?",
        "Emily: Does it look like I'm having a relapse? I'm fine. I came to check on you.",
        "Susan: You mean since every living soul in town knows that the man who terrorized this hospital used to be my husband? I'm peachy.",
        "Emily: I already told you nobody blames you, Mom.",
        "Susan: It's no wonder you and your sister have had a few little problems finding a good man. You learned from a master.",
        "Emily: Hey, I got a good one now.",
        "Susan: Casey's a -- your husband, and I have to respect that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, actually, uh, he's not my husband -- or he -- he won't be soon. Yes, mother. This is true. My days as Mrs. Casey Hughes are coming to an end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh! And here I was, tiptoeing around so that I wouldn't wake you up.",
        "Jack: Mm.",
        "Janet: Mm, mm.",
        "Jack: You're too late. I'm sorry I was asleep when you got in last night. But picking J.J. up from, uh, camp turned out to be your basic nightmare. When we got there, he wasn't even packed. We couldn't believe it.",
        "Janet: \"We\"?",
        "Jack: Carly decided she was gonna tag along last minute.",
        "Janet: Oh. How was that?",
        "Jack: Complicated. But then again, with Carly, it always is.",

        "Janet: So, how complicated can it be, picking up a kid from camp?",
        "Jack: Well, clearly, you don't know Carly all that well, or you wouldn't have to ask.",
        "Janet: Oh. What, did you guys argue the whole time?",
        "Jack: No. Actually, we got along pretty well.",
        "Janet: Great.",
        "Jack: Aren't you supposed to be at work?",
        "Janet: Uh, you know. But you know what? Nobody will starve if I'm a few minutes late. Besides, I really want to hear more about this fabulous road trip and how well the two of you got along.",
        "Jack: Oh, stop it, okay? Except for when it comes to the kids, Carly and I are history. You know that. Yesterday was proof. There was no drama, no heartache. It's like we finally got to this place where we finally understand each other.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Janet: Well, I'm happy for you -- I think.",
        "Jack: Hey. I was just talking about you.",
        "Carly: Parker was supposed to take the 9:10 train home from camp, right?",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Carly: And -- and there's no way he might have decided to stay another day?",
        "Jack: Carly, what -- what's going on?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm here at the train station. I'm waiting to pick him up. But he didn't get off the train.",
        "Jack: Were you there on time?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: Okay. Uh, did you try his cell?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Jack. It goes directly to voicemail.",
        "Jack: Carly, maybe he knew who was calling.",
        "Carly: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jack: Never mind. Listen, just wait 20 minutes and try to call him again.",
        "Carly: That's it?",
        "Jack: I'm sure he's fine.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, I'm glad you're sure.",
        "Jack: What do you want me to do?!",
        "Carly: Nothing. Do absolutely nothing.",
        "Jack: What just happened?",
        "Janet: Sounds like all that understanding just went right out the window.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: It -- it's kind of funny, when you think about it. You guys finally accept me and Emily as husband and wife, and now she decides she doesn't want to be married.",
        "Margo: Uh, so this is -- this is her decision?",
        "Casey: Yeah. She says we're not ready.",
        "Tom: Well, I can't say that I disagree.",
        "Margo: Well, me either. I mean, you're -- you're too young to be committed to anything.",
        "Casey: Oh, no, no. I'm committed. You know, this thing with Decker made me sure more than anything that -- I don't want to live without her.",
        "Margo: I know that feeling, believe me. But you're sure?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Positive, positive. And -- and I've also been thinking about you guys, too, you know? You -- you were great to me and Emily when all this was going down, and -- I'll never forget it.",
        "Tom: Well, we just want you to be happy now.",
        "Casey: I am, I am, I am. Which is why I'm not gonna let this annulment bother me.",
        "Tom: Good. So, can I help with any of the legal stuff?",
        "Casey: No, no, no, no. You need to rest. There's no rush, you know? Besides, Emily and I are gonna be together. And the next time we get married, it will -- it will be for keeps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I am so glad you came to your senses.",
        "Emily: You know what? You better watch what you say, Mother, because annulment or not, Casey's not ready to give up on me. And I feel the same way about him.",
        "Susan: I'm just hoping that you're not deluding yourself that this May- December fling is anything more than that.",
        "Emily: He loves me, Mother. He loves me. He doesn't care how old I am or -- or what I'm gonna look like in 20 years. He doesn't care!",
        "Susan: Maybe not now.",
        "Emily: I can't believe you! You of all people should understand this. Are you forgetting about your -- your ex-husband -- your younger ex-husband, Larry?",
        "Susan: I'm not forgetting. I speak from experience when I tell you that being with Casey is a bad idea.",
        "Emily: Well, I disagree, okay? And -- and after everything I've been through, if you think I'm gonna throw it all away because you think it's a bad idea, you're out of your mind!",
        "Susan: Okay! If he makes you happy --",
        "Emily: No, there are no ifs about it!",

        "Carly: Parker, this is now my fourth time calling, and -- and I'm starting to really worry. If -- if you're getting these messages and you don't want to talk to me, that's okay, really. Just send me a text so -- so I know you're all right. Please.",

        "Holden: Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi. I know that we probably shouldn't talk, but something's wrong here. I can feel it.",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Carly: It's Parker. He was supposed to be on a train this morning, and he wasn't. I keep calling his cell phone, but I just get voicemail. And I'm -- I'm trying not to think the worst, but I -- I can't help it.",
        "Holden: Are you still at the station?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Holden: Stay there. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I knew it wouldn't last. One good day, and in less than 24 hours, we're right back at each other's throats. Parker's not answering.",
        "Janet: Oh, great. I was afraid of that.",
        "Jack: You really think he's with liberty, knowing the trouble he'd be in?",
        "Janet: You really think you need to ask me that question? Hold on.",

        "Liberty: Is this a prank call?",

        "Liberty: Of course I'm alone. Daddy dearest would not have it any other way.",
        "Janet: So Parker's not with you?",
        "Liberty: Are you kidding? You think he'd risk sudden death?",
        "Janet: Uh, he might.",
        "Liberty: I haven't seen him, and I don't expect to.",
        "Janet: Okay. That's all I needed to know.",
        "Liberty: Wait. Is Parker okay?",
        "Janet: I'm sure he's fine. Nothing to worry about, okay? I love you. I'll talk to you later. Bye. He's not with Libby.",
        "Jack: You're sure she was telling you the truth? Okay. I'm gonna head over to the train station, make sure he's not talking to his mom.",
        "Janet: Uh -- you want some company?",
        "Jack: I got it covered, Honey, and you got to get to work.",

        "Katie: We were so worried about you. How is everyone in the family doing?",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, thanks. Everybody's just wonderful now, thank God.",
        "Katie: You must have been terrified.",
        "Kim: Oh, it was. There was so many lives at stake. I mean, it wasn't just Bob and the boys. When I think of what could have happened and how close they came, it was just horrific.",
        "Leo: Sorry for interrupting, but the director needs you in the booth.",
        "Kim: Oh, Leo. Have you two met our new intern? Brad and Katie, otherwise known as \"The talent.\"",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that's debatable. Hi.",

        "Brad: I get it now, you know, like I never did before, uh, how much scarier the world is when you're not alone. If anything ever happened to you or Liberty --",
        "Katie: Nothing's gonna happen.",
        "Brad: I just keep thinking that if I can keep track of her, you know, where she is every moment, that I can keep her from messing up her life the way I messed up her mother's.",
        "Katie: Liberty's a smart girl, Brad. She's learned from Janet's mistakes.",

        "Parker: Um, well, my dad sent me to this tennis camp so that I would get over you, but that didn't really work, and today was the last day.",
        "Liberty: Well, well, won't they be expecting you at home?",
        "Parker: Probably, but as soon as I got off the train, I came straight here. I had to see you and tell you how sorry I am.",
        "Liberty: For what?",
        "Parker: For just acting like a complete jerk the last time I saw you. It was just -- I was so ticked at our dads for saying that we couldn't see each other anymore.",
        "Liberty: No. Everyone got a little intense, you know? But -- but the parents kind of cooled out a little bit, and -- and Katie's like this close to convincing my dad to get me another phone. So you have to go. Yeah, you have to go, because if he catches you here --",
        "Parker: He won't, okay? I waited until I was sure that they left before I came in. God. I missed you so much. The whole -- the whole way here on that train, all I could think about --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: It was the ring, wasn't it? If I had gotten a bigger rock, good-bye annulment, right?",
        "Emily: Very funny. So, how'd your parents take the news? Let me guess -- your mother was on the phone with Lisa, planning a party to celebrate.",
        "Casey: Oh, come on. My parents came around about it. And I told them the annulment won't change a thing.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm sure they loved that.",
        "Casey: It's weird. The -- the fact that I don't fight it -- I think my parents realize how serious I am about you. What about your mom?",
        "Emily: Well, same as usual. \"It won't last, Emily.\"",
        "Casey: Well, she's wrong. Don't let her get to you. We're gonna make it through it, okay?",

        "Holden: Hey. Any word?",
        "Carly: No. And two more trains have come and gone, and he wasn't on either of them. What the hell am I supposed to do?! I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you with this. You should be looking after your own son instead of trying to help me find mine.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. Aaron's fine. Besides, I should be here with you right now, helping you out. Did you call Jack? Did you make sure that he didn't pick Parker up earlier?",
        "Carly: I called him. He made it sound like I was making a big deal out of nothing.",
        "Holden: All right, well, let's just focus on Parker right now. What about the camp counselor? Did you talk to him, by any chance?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Holden: Give him a call.",
        "Carly: No. I didn't even think of that. Okay. Hi. This is Carly Tenney calling. My son, uh, Parker Snyder, was supposed to be in the 9:10 train back to Oakdale this morning. No, he didn't. Yeah, that's okay. It's okay. I -- I know now. Yeah. No, I'm sure he's fine. Thank you. Thank you very much. He took an earlier train. He's probably at home right now, wondering where everybody is.",
        "Holden: Or in bed with the ringer off.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Thank you so much for not making me feel like the worst mother in the world and for not listening to me when I said we shouldn't see each other.",

        "Liberty: You're nuts. You're -- I mean, do you not get it? My -- my dad would insert a homing device in me if he could. Parker, he's watching me 24/7, okay? We're just gonna have to suck it up and -- and stick to the rules.",
