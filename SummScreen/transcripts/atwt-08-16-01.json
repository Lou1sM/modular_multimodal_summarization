        "Reporter: Ms. Griffin?\u00a0 Does the D.A.'s office care to speculate on the\r\n\r\noutcome of the Montgomery trial?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: With the arrest of Carly Tenney as an accessory, we're confident\r\n\r\nthat the jury will hand down a guilty verdict.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Reporter: In light of Barbara Ryan's injuries, what kind of sentence will\r\n\r\nthe D.A.'s office ask for?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: Well, let's get Mr. Montgomery convicted of attempted murder\r\n\r\nfirst, and then we'll see about sentencing.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Reporter: Thank you, Ms. Griffin.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: Thank you.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: Jessica.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: Margo.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: I thought I would have at least gotten a call back from you last\r\n\r\nnight.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: The taxpayers' money is invested in my getting a conviction right\r\n\r\nnow.\u00a0 That's all I'm focusing on.",
        "Margo: It is possible that this guy, Owen Dever, could have information\r\n\r\nbearing on the case.\u00a0 So is the D.A. going to issue a warrant?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: No, not today.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: Why on earth wouldn't you?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: I read the file, Margo.\u00a0 I'm not going to waste valuable police\r\n\r\nresources picking up somebody who has no probable cause.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: Nutjobs who are on Thorazine to keep them from destroying the\r\n\r\nimmediate world don't have to have rational motives.\u00a0 At the very least, you\r\n\r\ncould put him in a lineup to see if Emily Stewart could I.D. him as the guy \r\nwho attacked her.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: That incident has nothing to do with this case.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: You had me bring in Carly Tenney on less evidence than I brought\r\n\r\nyou on Owen Dever!",
        "Jessica: Carly Tenney's motives are clear.\u00a0 That photo is evidence of a\r\n\r\nstrong and not very healthy connection to Craig.\u00a0 Now, are you gonna stand\r\n\r\nthere and argue that she couldn't be an accessory before the fact?\u00a0 No, I'm\r\n\r\nsorry, Margo.\u00a0 As much as you don't like it, there is no other guy who \r\ncommitted this crime.\u00a0 The jury is gonna hand down a guilty verdict.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
        "Margo: Because they don't have the facts.\u00a0 But hey, if you can frame Craig\r\n\r\nMontgomery to get another notch on your conviction belt, why not, huh?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Jessica: Excuse me, Margo, but presenting the state's case takes \r\npreparation.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Margo: Well, thanks for less than nothing.",

        "Sierra: I'm sure she's worried sick about Craig, mother.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Lucinda: Ah, if she only were the only one.\u00a0 But no, no, no.\u00a0 You must\r\n\r\ntake the giant step and testify in this monster's defense.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Sierra: Well, somebody needs to stand up for him, mother.\u00a0 He didn't do it.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
        "Lucinda: I don't know, darling.\u00a0 Is it the sex?\u00a0 Is that what makes you so\r\n\r\nblind?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Sierra: Didn't we have a deal?\u00a0 Didn't you promise that you would keep\r\n\r\nyour mouth shut about Craig?\u00a0 You know, I should have known better --",
        "Rose: You know what, you two?\u00a0 You sound like a couple of Jersey Mud\r\n\r\nWrestlers.\u00a0 Could you not do this here?",
        "Lucinda: Jersey Mud Wrestlers?\u00a0 Anyway, it doesn't matter what Sierra\r\n\r\nsays.\u00a0 Doesn't matter.\u00a0 The case that the D.A. has laid out -- no, it doesn't\r\n\r\nmatter.\u00a0 Nothing you say will turn the tide for Craig.\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Sierra: Well, then I'll just have to pray that some progress is made outside\r\n\r\nthe courtroom.\u00a0 It's all up to Hal Munson now.\u00a0 Maybe he can succeed where I\r\n\r\ncan't.\u00a0 ",

        "Dr. Michaels: I've thought of you often, with all the news about Barbara.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow's she doing?\u00a0 \r\n",
        "Hal: Well, it's -- it's been pretty rough.\u00a0 Listen, I'm so glad you're here\r\n\r\nbecause I -- Emily and I -- oh, I'm sorry.\u00a0 This is Emily Stewart.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
        "Emily: Hi, Emily Stewart.\u00a0 Nice to see you again.\u00a0 We're actually here to\r\n\r\nsee Julia.\u00a0 She's a very good friend of both of ours, and we were hoping we\r\n\r\ncould see her.",
