        "Henry: There you are, my pet.",
        "Vienna: I needed something to relieve the pain. Is it done?",
        "Henry: It's done.",
        "Vienna: I know we had to, Henry, but it's really hard to say good-bye to old friends.",
        "Henry: If it's any consolation, I know how difficult it was for you and I think that what you did was very, very noble.",
        "Vienna: I hope you got a great price for the Orlandia. With its peach color is quite rare, and it was nearly 20 carats --",
        "Henry: All the diamonds fetched better than market price.",
        "Vienna: Even the one from my mother? I know it was small, but it was my favorite. She gave it to me on my tenth birthday.",
        "Henry: I know, I know. She made you stand very still, and she made you close your little eyes, which is why -- I just couldn't bring myself to sell it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey, Noah. What's up?",
        "Noah: I've got this huge assignment from Kim. I have to go through all these tapes for thematic content and now I'm logging them in chronologically.",
        "Luke: Well I just finished my reports, maybe I can help you.",
        "Noah: No, that's okay. I've already got a system going.",
        "Luke: You sure?",
        "Noah: Totally under control.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Maddie: How badly do you want to hear some good news?",
        "Noah: On a scale of one to ten? 11.",
        "Maddie: I'm doing it. I'm going to defer my admission and I'm going to stay here in Oakdale with you.",
        "Noah: Are you serious? You're really going to do it? That's awesome!",
        "Luke: You're doing what? Are you crazy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Craig, wait -- I -- I don't think I'm ready to go home with you -- not in the way that you want.",
        "Craig: You mean as my wife, and all that that implies.",
        "Meg: Look, just the fact that you told me the truth about the night Rosanna went off the road, that -- that means so much to me.",
        "Craig: Good. I needed you to know that I didn't cause that accident. So, if you believe that, and you tore up the annulment papers --",
        "Meg: I tore up the annulment papers because it was the best thing for the corporation. Wasn't it?",
        "Craig: It pacified the board seeing a united front, which was a good thing in light of Lucinda's pathetic takeover attempt. But that's not the only reason why you destroyed them.",
        "Meg: Why not?",
        "Craig: Meg, I was honest with you tonight. It was very difficult, but I did it. I need you to do the same with me now.",
        "Craig: The papers. There's no reason for you to stay married to me. Not unless there's a part of you, even a very small part, that wants to be my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I have to get to Jennifer! There's something that I have to tell her.",
        "Paul: Uh -- you know what? I'm sure that it can wait.",
        "Rosanna: No, it can't. It's -- it's about her baby. I have to talk to her. I have to tell her.",
        "Paul: No, what you have to do is lie back now and try to get some rest. Rosanna, what are you doing?",
        "Paul: You are too weak to go anywhere.",
        "Rosanna: But how can I --",
        "Paul: You need to get some rest.",
        "Rosanna: I can't stay here knowing I'm the only one that can help your sister.",
        "Paul: Listen, Jennifer -- I'm sure Jennifer will understand.",
        "Rosanna: No, but you don't understand. I think that Craig has done something horrible. And your sister -- there's been a big mistake --",
        "Paul: My concern right now is you, all right? Look at me. I know you're afraid and I know that you're upset. But you have to trust me. Nothing bad is going to happen to you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: You are the most wonderful man!",
        "Henry: You looked so unhappy when you laid that thing on the velvet. I -- I couldn't bring myself to make you part with something that was just so dear.",
        "Vienna: You are the most romantic man I've ever known. Can you please put it on?",
        "Henry: Oh yes, absolutely. Happily. You know -- here, you are just so -- you're so beautiful, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Even with only one itsy bitsy diamond?",
        "Henry: It has nothing to do with the rock around your neck. You are so beautiful because you are fearless, and you are -- you were willing to make sacrifices --",
        "Vienna: Well, you know, it's the least I could do. Let's face it. I wasn't exactly good at economizing. You know, the only way out was to sell the jewelry.",
        "Henry: You think you might regret the decision?",
        "Vienna: I still have you, don't I? And we love each other. Which is way more important than money.",
        "Henry: That's very true. We're uh -- we're not in the black yet though.",
        "Vienna: But I thought by selling the jewels --",
        "Henry: But yeah, we got some money that'll make a dent in the debt, but we're not going to be in fancy shoes and martinis anytime soon. Anyway, I'm going to take the cash and deposit in the bank tomorrow morning.",
        "Vienna: You have it here?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. Voila.",
        "Vienna: As beautiful as that sight is, I only have eyes for you.",
        "Henry: Likewise, my sweet.",
        "Vienna: Will you be here when I get back?",
        "Henry: Where are you going?",
        "Vienna: I'm going to go upstairs and meet my manicurist.",
        "Henry: What happened to economizing?",
        "Vienna: Well, it's a necessary business expense for a masseuse. And I can write it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stage manager: Noah, Hillary's asking for those tapes upstairs in the library.",
        "Noah: Oh -- okay, thanks. Be right back, okay?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Luke: Come on, Maddie. What's really going on?",
        "Maddie: Nothing. Nothing. I just -- I realized that going to Wesleyan is going to be a lot harder than I thought.",
        "Luke: Harder how?",
        "Maddie: Because I didn't get the scholarship money that I thought I was going to get, and Henry and Vienna are really strapped for cash, and I don't feel right asking them to foot the bill for the difference. Here, I'm going to be paying a tenth of the tuition. I can take part-time classes and I can work and save money.",
        "Luke: But what about the scholarships that you did get? You're just going to throw that away?",
        "Maddie: I'll reapply if I go.",
        "Luke: Wait -- if you go?",
        "Maddie: Maybe if I stay here, things will work out.",
        "Luke: What things? You mean you and Noah? Is he the reason that you want to stay?",
        "Maddie: Maybe he's a part of it. I mean, things are going really well with us and so when he said that I ought to stay --",
        "Luke: Wait a minute. No, Maddie, no! You cannot stay here because Noah asked you to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I know that right now, at this moment, I want to stay married to you, Craig. But it's just an experiment. I don't know how it's going to turn out.",
        "Craig: You're no scientist, you ripped up those papers on an impulse from your heart, not your head.",
        "Meg: Oh and I suppose you know me better than I know myself?",
        "Craig: Maybe I do.",
        "Meg: And maybe it's just -- I don't know -- easier not to struggle anymore. My life's been so upside down lately, and right now, I -- I'm too tired to fight.",
        "Craig: I didn't put any pressure on you to tear up those papers. You have been completely free to choose.",
        "Meg: Completely free to choose you. You and your, \"I love you so I am setting you free\" pitch. Why is it with you, no pressure is so much pressure?",
        "Craig: Because you won't deal with the feelings that you have. Now when are you going to stop fighting it?",
        "Meg: When are you going to stop putting words in my mouth and turning them around to suit you?",
        "Craig: Admit it. You like me.",
        "Meg: You're impossible.",
        "Craig: I'm challenging and you like a challenge, don't you?",
        "Meg: You know what? I like learning about this business.",
        "Craig: And keeping me in line. I am good for you, Meg.",
        "Meg: Yeah, in a kind of exasperating kind of way.",
        "Craig: Well you've got to admit, it beats better than just starting all over -- alone -- with nobody in our corner. Got to admit, it's nice. It's nice to have a partner, both at home and at work. Someone to share the load with the laughs. We make a pretty good team, you know. Look what we've already done. We scuttled Lucinda's coup. We helped Parker through a very tough night --",
        "Meg: I guess there is something inside me that does want a partner. Someone to share things with.",
        "Craig: Someone like me?",
        "Meg: Possibly.",
        "Craig: See, I can live with possibly. Now, you won't come home with me, that's okay, but is it possible that I could take you to a late night dinner? Maybe we could have a little toast to the future -- just about the possibility of a future, huh?",
        "Meg: You think you're so charming, don't you?",
        "Craig: Oh, I have my moments. Is that a yes?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm. That's a yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Who is this?",
        "Dr. Cutler: How long has she been conscious?",
        "Paul: Just a few minutes.",
        "Dr. Cutler: I'm very glad to see you, Rosanna. Do you know where you are?",
        "Rosanna: A hospital.",
        "Dr. Cutler: That's right. I'm your doctor. Dr. Cutler.",
        "Paul: She was kind of out of it when she first woke up, but she's -- she's more alert now.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know this man. Where's Bob Hughes?",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you're in a different hospital. You think you can get rest for a minute while I talk to Dr. Cutler? She's asking me questions and they're all coming really quickly. And it seems like there's some gaps in her memory. And so much time has passed, and she's missed so much that I don't even know where to start.",
        "Dr. Cutler: You start by being patient. You can't overwhelm her, or pressure her to remember things.",
        "Paul: What if she just asks me something point blank?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Answer as simply as you can, without a lot of details. The mind is a delicate thing. It doesn't always respond to force.",
        "Paul: So I should just try and hope that she remembers on her own?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Give her time to get oriented to her surroundings. Then, hopefully, her memory will return.",
        "Paul: Right, hopefully?",
        "Dr. Cutler: Well, we can't predict these things, but we have reason to be optimistic since the drug worked so well to bring her back. In any case, I'd like to examine her now. When I'm finished you can come back in.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, don't go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Al: Henry Coleman?",
        "Henry: Who wants to know?",
        "Al: The name's Bart Albertini. How you doing?",
        "Henry: What can I do for you, Mr. Albertini?",
        "Al: Well, I don't like to be nosy, but I couldn't help but notice that wad of green you flashed just now.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's a bad habit.",
        "Al: Are you the same Henry Coleman that cleaned out the Lombardo twins after a long night of poker?",
        "Henry: I see my reputation precedes me.",
        "Al: You're a legend in this town, Buddy. And it just so happens I'm on my way to a high-stakes game right now. You interested?",
        "Henry: You know, there was a time I wouldn't think twice about that, but I'm a reformed gambler.",
        "Al: Game's right upstairs.",
        "Henry: Near or far, quitting is quitting.",
        "Al: Don't tell me. You got a gal now and she's jealous of your love for lady luck.",
        "Henry: Let me put it to you this way, the last time I sat in on a game, I got arrested. Okay? And it was the night before my wedding -- almost. And that's another story. The point is that my girl doesn't just get jealous of me gambling, she goes into an insane rage.",
        "Al: Yeah, I heard about that sting operation -- sorry. Mum Eddie should have stayed in Chicago where he knows the turf. But these are just some local boys looking to have some fun.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "Al: If you're as good as they say --",
        "Henry: Oh, I'm that good.",
        "Al: Then what have you got to lose? I mean, a guy like you, you could quadruple that bundle by the end of the night.",
        "Henry: Did you say quadruple?",
        "Al: Guys, this is Henry. He's joining the game tonight. Henry, this is Whitey, TC, JP and Lee.",
        "Henry: Nice to meet you guys.",
        "Whitey: The game is five card stud. Bullets play ball tens, three raise limit per hand. Gentlemen, ante up.",
        "Henry: What's the buy-in?",
        "JP: $25.",
        "TC: $2,500.",
        "Henry: Just making sure you guys are awake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Did Noah ask you to give up Wesleyan to go to school here in Oakdale?",
        "Maddie: No. We were talking about the different ways that we could keep seeing each other and this is just one of the options.",
        "Luke: So, that's it. You're just going to do it?",
        "Maddie: What if this thing with Noah could be something permanent? Something I can't find at Wesleyan?",
        "Luke: Do you really believe that?",
        "Maddie: Shouldn't I give it a chance? Noah is a great guy. I like him and he likes me.",
        "Luke: Do you love him?",
        "Maddie: Come on, Luke. It's too early to talk about love.",
        "Luke: Okay, so it's too early to talk about love, but it's not too early to throw away your entire education? Maddie, come on. Isn't this more about Casey than it is about Noah?",
        "Maddie: No. No, no. This has nothing to do with Casey.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, you know what? Maybe you hate me for saying this. But I feel like somebody has to.",
        "Maddie: Well, I can't stop you, can I?",
        "Luke: It's just that you were willing to give up Wesleyan for Casey too, but he said no because he loved you. Now here comes Noah, who you admit that you don't even love. And he's asking you to give up your dreams? What's up with that?",
        "Maddie: I thought you liked Noah.",
        "Luke: I'm just saying this as a friend, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, if you want to be my friend, then you should be happy for me.",
        "Assistant: Hey, Maddie. Everybody in I.T. is gone, and one of the computers in production is down. Could you come look at it?",
        "Maddie: Sure.",
        "Noah: Maddie looks like she got hit by a truck. What did you say to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Just take a deep breath and try to relax, okay? The doctor's just going to check you out, and I'll be right outside the door.",
        "Rosanna: But I don't know this man --",
        "Paul: He's a good doctor. He brought you back to me.",
        "Rosanna: You promise me you'll come back when he's finished?",
        "Paul: I was here when you woke up, wasn't I? [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Barbara: Oh, thank goodness. I was afraid you wouldn't answer.",
        "Paul: I thought we agreed that we we're going to speak to one another for a while.",
        "Barbara: I know, I know, I just couldn't help it. I needed to hear your voice. I mean, to think that I had lost you and then find out that you're alive. Excuse me, but that's hard for a mother to be separated from her children.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it won't be long now.",
        "Barbara: How are things going?",
        "Paul: We should be home soon.",
        "Barbara: We? You're bringing Rosanna home?",
        "Paul: She isn't ready to travel yet.",
        "Barbara: Does that mean that she's come around after all this time?",
        "Paul: Yeah, look I got to hang up the phone right now.",
        "Barbara: Paul?",
        "Craig: Barbara?",
        "Craig: You look a little out of sorts, Barbara. Are you all right?",
        "Barbara: Are you spying on me?",
        "Craig: Well, believe me, if I need surveillance done, you wouldn't catch me sneaking around hotel lobbies doing it myself.",
        "Meg: It was hardly spying. We just walked in. Look, Craig is right, you look a little agitated.",
        "Barbara: I'm excited. I'm very excited. I just got a call that a very long- term investment that I'd completely forgotten about has just paid off very unexpectedly.",
        "Craig: Oh, a financial windfall. See, nothing cheers up the old gal like the smell of fresh money.",
        "Meg: Well, I'm glad you're happy.",
        "Barbara: I am happy. I am very, very happy. So, where are you two headed?",
        "Craig: I'm taking my wife to dinner.",
        "Barbara: Try the scampi. It's got quite a kick.",
        "Craig: Barbara, what the hell is going on?",
        "Barbara: What do you mean, Craig?",
        "Craig: You were railing us not long ago for having the audacity to try to pay our respects after Paul's death. Now you are being downright civil.",
        "Barbara: It's called transcendence.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'll bet there's another word for it, but I really don't want to be trading insults.",
        "Barbara: You think whatever you want, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh, come off it, Barbara. I was married to you long enough to recognize when you think you've pulled one over on me.",
        "Barbara: You know nothing.",
        "Craig: But obviously you think you do. Okay, you know what? Let's try something new. Let's stop the game. Just tell us what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Why do I feel so weak?",
        "Paul: Because you were immobile for a long time. It's going to be a little while before you get your strength back.",
        "Rosanna: How long was I unconscious?",
        "Paul: For a long time. Months.",
        "Rosanna: What happened?",
        "Paul: It's a long story. And it will all come back to you. Maybe not all at once, but in little pieces.",
        "Rosanna: And what if it doesn't?",
        "Paul: It will all fall into place. It will, it will. You --",
        "Rosanna: I need to know.",
        "Paul: You suffered a severe head trauma in an accident, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Accident? I was -- I was in an accident?",
        "Paul: It was a car accident. You don't remember?",
        "Rosanna: It's all pretty hazy.",
        "Paul: You know, you woke up and you said you had to get to Jennifer.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Something about her baby. But it's not really clear. It's just -- I knew I had to tell her -- something about the wrong foot.",
        "Paul: You remember that?",
        "Rosanna: I mean, I remember the words. I just don't know what they mean. The wrong foot.",
        "Paul: Footprint. Baby footprint. They didn't match. That's how you knew that Craig switched the babies.",
        "Rosanna: Switched the babies? I don't understand that.",
        "Paul: You will. Look, maybe it would help if you could tell me the last thing you do remember before the accident.",
        "Rosanna: I remember Craig. And we were at Fairwinds. We argued. I left the house --",
        "Paul: Do you remember why?",
        "Rosanna: Because I was the one that knew the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I didn't say anything to Maddie.",
        "Noah: Then why'd she look so upset?",
        "Luke: Well, I guess she didn't like me questioning why she decided not to go to Wesleyan.",
        "Noah: What'd she say about that?",
        "Luke: She said that it was pretty much your idea.",
        "Noah: It was a suggestion, okay? Something I thought that -- it was just an idea. That's why I mentioned it.",
        "Luke: When?",
        "Noah: Earlier tonight.",
        "Luke: After we went swimming?",
        "Noah: So?",
        "Luke: Maybe we should talk --",
        "Noah: There's really nothing to talk about.",
        "Luke: But I feel like there is something to --",
        "Noah: Whatever you think happened, didn't.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I'm not -- I'm not gay.",
        "Luke: I never said that you were.",
        "Maddie: Can you believe that nobody up there knows how to reset the wireless? If I wanted to be a tech-nerd, I would be making lots of money.",
        "Noah: You ready to leave?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I was ready an hour ago.",
        "Noah: Good.",

        "Lee: I'm out, too.",
        "JP: Don't look at me, I've been out all night.",

And we have a little of my cognac and I look at your beautiful face. And you're a little tipsy and I kiss you. And you let me. And then you put your arms around me and hold on and try to forget about Paul. And I'm tipsy too, so I let you. And for a few very beautiful hours, all the pain would be washed away.
