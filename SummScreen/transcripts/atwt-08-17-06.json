        "Mike: Sanding down that joint. ",
        "Simon: I must say, it does\r\nlook great. ",
        "Mike: Carly called for high gloss finish, so\r\nit has to be perfect. ",
        "Simon: Well, it does look perfect. Now take\r\nit down. ",
        "Mike: Excuse me? ",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah, no, I'll need you to rip\r\nit down by the time the painters come in tomorrow morning. You and Katie didn't\r\nhave any plans, did you? ",

        "Nancy: That looks awful. ",
        "Katie: I'm trying to get pregnant. ",
        "Nancy: We used to do something different. ",
        "Katie: Well, I'm trying to increase my odds\r\nof getting pregnant. These vitamins and this drink together have tons of folic\r\nacid, zinc, selenium -- ",
        "Nancy: Did you ever try lingerie? ",
        "Katie: I will try anything -- when the time\r\nis right. ",
        "Nancy: Wasted -- wasted -- wasted on the young. ",

        "Eve: Here you go. I had them put a little\r\nextra whipped cream on it for you. I thought we'd live it up a little. ",
        "Maddie: Eve, you don't look very happy. I\r\nknow you're trying, but you don\u2019t. ",
        "Eve: Maybe you should hear this from me\r\ninstead of Detective Hughes, or Gwen. ",
        "Maddie: Hear what? ",
        "Eve: It's Casey. ",
        "Maddie: Nothing happened to him, right? ",
        "Eve: No, he's fine. ",
        "Maddie: Okay. ",
        "Eve: It's just -- in the hospital -- it\r\nseems he's not as ready to support you as he was. ",
        "Maddie: He thinks I tried to kill Gwen. ",
        "Eve: He's not sure that you didn\u2019t. Maddie, say something. Get mad, yell -- \r\n",
        "Maddie: Why? I'm only getting what I\r\ndeserve. ",
        "Eve: No, you have to stop talking like that\r\nand thinking like that. You are surrounded by people that love you, and think\r\nthe world of you. ",
        "Maddie: Yeah, right. ",
        "Eve: You are. You have Henry and me and -- ",
        "Maddie: Don't say it -- ",
        "Eve: You are being ungrateful. ",
        "Maddie: How? I didn't ask him to come here.\r\nI don't want him here. ",
        "Eve: You need him, Maddie. ",
        "Maddie: No, I don't need him. ",
        "Eve: Yes, you do. Do you realize how much\r\ntrouble you could be in? If the police charge you with murder, you're going to\r\nneed all of us to fight this. Henry, me -- ",

        "Louis: Henry, please. I made a mistake -- ",

        "Carly: You don't? All right, I understand.\r\nOh, ouch, I'm so sorry. ",
        "Gwen: Please? ",
        "Carly: Right. Okay, will you just -- you\r\njust got attacked by a serial killer, but why would you want to talk about\r\nthat? Right, thing's happen. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's right. Things happen. ",
        "Carly: Gwen, what is it? ",
        "Gwen: Nothing. Uh, it's just that Will and I\r\nsplit up. I lost him -- ",

        "",
        "Jade: Will? ",
        "Will: Gwen? ",
        "Jade: No, no, it's just me. I'm sorry to\r\nwake you. It's just I heard a noise outside, and I was wondering if you could\r\ngo check in the parking lot. Please? ",
        "Will: Yup. Sure. No one\r\nthere. Nobody. ",
        "Jade: Thank God you checked in here. I was\r\nscared to be alone. Sorry to wake you up. You must be exhausted. And cramped,\r\nwhy didn't you sleep in the bed? ",
        "Will: It was -- it was fine. ",
        "Jade: I slept great. But did you get up a\r\ncouple of times? ",
        "Will: Yeah, I went outside to make a couple\r\nof calls. ",
        "Jade: To who? Gwen? ",
        "Will: Yeah. ",
        "Jade: Do you think that's such a good idea? ",
        "Will: Well, I think it's a good idea that\r\nshe finds out why we're staying together, and then she finds out why. ",
        "Jade: Oh. ",
        "Will: What? What is it? ",
        "Jade: I just -- I didn't know you felt that\r\nway. I ran into Gwen at Java, and -- I mean, I kind of told her about us. ",
        "",
        "Louis: Just have that martini. Give me just\r\nthat much time to make this right. ",
        "Henry: That's my problem though, isn't it, Louis?\r\nI hide from life behind those martinis, and I just sip away and watch Maddie\r\nself-destruct. ",
        "Louis: You can throw everything I said back\r\nin my face. I'll take it. I deserve it. But we have to get through this because\r\nMaddie needs all of our help. ",
        "Henry: Clyde, un-cancel that martini, will you? And something\r\nnon-alcoholic and flavorless for my friend here. ",
        "Louis: I -- I've been very hard on you. ",
        "Henry: Ya think? ",
        "Louis: Last night, when you suggested that I\r\nmight have hurt Maddie -- inside, I just went crazy. ",
        "Henry: Aw. ",
        "Louis: But afterwards, thinking about it, it\r\nmade me realize how you must have felt when I took you to task for Maddie. \r\n",
        "Henry: Oh, Louis, here. To people who still\r\nsay took you to task. ",
        "Louis: I would never hurt her, Henry, ever.\r\nI was just trying to tell her I wanted to help her. Just the situation, her\r\nattitude, the passive aggression, it's all so frustrating. I was just trying to\r\nget her to sit still long enough to listen to me. But I made it worse, and I\r\nknow it. I'm sorry. ",
        "Henry: Ah, hell. It's okay. ",
        "Louis: No, it's not, Henry. I feel like the\r\nreason I may have been so aggressive with you is because -- I feel responsible\r\nfor what happened to her. For her sneaking off to that frat\r\nparty. I should have been paying more attention. ",
        "Henry: Let's just blame the guys that hurt\r\nher. And may they burn in hell. ",
        "Louis: Right. ",
        "Henry: Right, right. Anyway, before we get\r\nto all swept up in this familial warmth -- just one more thing.\r\nNever put your hands on my sister again. Got it? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Honey, we do understand how horrible\r\nthis time has been for you. But can't you see that Louis is just trying to help\r\nyou? Maddie, he didn't have to do the things that he did. All the wonderful and\r\nkind things he's done. Not many men would take that kind of interest in their\r\nwife's sister. ",
        "Maddie: I don't -- ",
        "Eve: You can't even look at me, Honey.\r\nMaddie, if Louis crossed the line with you in some -- ",
        "Maddie: No. Just -- I know that he wants to\r\nhelp. I know that, but -- ",
        "Eve: Then why won't you just talk to him? ",
        "Maddie: Can't you talk to him for me? Just\r\ntell him -- tell him that I appreciate everything that he's done. But it's not\r\nworth it. I'm a lost cause. ",

        "Simon: I appreciate how understanding you\r\nare being, Michael. ",
        "Mike: It's not my money she wasted. ",
        "Simon: Hey, oh, it's just really late\r\nnotice. I mean, I would have come by earlier, I just got sidetracked with the\r\ninvestors. ",

        "Mike: No. Sure. ",
        "Simon: I hope I didn't stomp on any plans\r\nyou might have. I would hate for you to be in bad words with Katie. ",
        "Mike: Katie knows not to count on anything\r\nwhen I'm working on a project. Right, do you have anything else? I want to get\r\nstarted. ",
        "Simon: Man, I really am sorry. I mean, God,\r\nit does look so good. ",

        "Jade: What was I supposed to do? Act like that\r\nthere was something to hide? And Gwen, of all people, should understand that\r\nI'm scared of being alone. I mean, look at the way she's with Casey. They're\r\npractically attached at the hip. ",
