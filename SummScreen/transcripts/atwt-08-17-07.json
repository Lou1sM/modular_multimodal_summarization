        "Maddie: I'm figuring out my schedule for the fall. I am so excited. There is this class that I absolutely want to take, it's called film and --",
        "Noah: Social change.",
        "Maddie: Social change. How did you know?",
        "Noah: Great minds. I'm taking that course, too.",
        "Maddie: Yay!",
        "Noah: And that goes towards your general end credits, so, you know, which might not be a big deal if you decide to transfer to Wesleyan down the line.",
        "Maddie: I'm not even thinking about that right now.",
        "Noah: Yeah, when I first had to give up on Northwestern, going to Oakdale U so felt like settling, but now that you're going too, I'm really excited.",
        "Maddie: Me too. For both of us.",
        "Noah: Actually, you know that class was pretty full when I signed up. You should probably head down to the registrar and make sure there's still room.",
        "Maddie: Oh, really? Okay. Well, are you sure you don't mind me leaving you alone? I mean -- well, Luke is at lunch. He should be back any minute.",
        "Noah: No, no problem. Good luck.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Noah: Hey, Luke, do you know where there's the --",

        "Noah: Dad? What are you doing here?",
        "Col. Mayer: Oh, I just wanted to see for myself what it is that's keeping you in this town.",
        "Noah: Well, I thought I told you.",
        "Col. Mayer: You told me a lot of things, and not one of them makes any sense. But if you and I put our heads together, I think we can figure out just exactly what it's going to take to make a man out of you.",

        "Lily: Could you put this on Lisa's desk? Thanks.",

        "Lily: Ms. Love. Yes, Lisa was called out of town unexpectedly, but she told me you'd be coming by. I hope I can help you. I'm Lily Snyder.",
        "Cheri: I hope so, too. I'm with the Venable Company. A lobbying firm. Maybe you've heard of us. I'm planning a convention here.",
        "Lily: In Oakdale?",
        "Cheri: Cheaper than Chicago.",
        "Lily: That's true.",
        "Cheri: And more discreet.",
        "Lily: Discreet? That's debatable.",
        "Cheri: Well, it's very important. I'm looking to reserve some suites for my staff as well as some very important politicians and their associates. I was told to look at the south wing.",
        "Lily: There's a private entrance. Yes.",
        "Cheri: Due to the sensitive nature of our work, we need to feel confident that we're operating outside the public spotlight.",
        "Lily: That will not be a problem.",
        "Cheri: Great. That's all I need to know.",
        "Lily: Okay. I put together some information about the local amenities, our food and beverage service --",

        "Katie: What if you were too drunk and somebody called and you didn't hear the phone?",
        "Brad: I slept with the phone two inches by my head. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: I know something bad has happened. When I called Carly --",
        "Brad: She said everything was fine.",
        "Katie: And then she hung up on me.",
        "Brad: Does that really surprise you?",

        "Silas: It's up to you.",
        "Ava: I mean it, Silas. Don't tempt me. How much money do we have to pay our friend, Kit, so we could stay in this hell hole? We got the feds after us, the local cops -- not to mention the cop who happens to be this kid's dad.",
        "Silas: Les Sweeney was the kid's dad. Now I'm taking over.",
        "Ava: And then what? Huh? We're going to live happily ever after in this joint? I'd rather be in jail.",
        "Silas: We just got to lie low for a couple of days till the heat's off. There's nobody left who gives a damn about finding that kid. Kid's cabin is in a pile of ashes. So are Detective Snyder and that pretty blonde.",

        "J.J.: I need my inhaler.",

        "Ava: There's nobody out there.",
        "Silas: You sure?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I'm sure. Go out there yourself!",
        "Silas: I will.",
        "Ava: Oh, you think nobody's going to recognize you dressed like that?",
        "Silas: I'm going to get Jacob some medicine.",
        "Ava: Is that safe?",
        "Silas: Well, if I'm not back in awhile, you'll know.",
        "Ava: Oh, you're coming back. I could never get so lucky.",
        "Silas: You don't know from luck. In a couple of days, when the heat's off, we're going to take the ransom money and get ourselves a damn palace to live in!",
        "Ava: An air-conditioned palace? With running water?",
        "Silas: With a white picket fence.",
        "J.J.: You know, if you don't want to deal with me, then why don't you just let me go now?",
        "Ava: If it was up to me, I would.",

        "Ava: No. No I don't.",
        "J.J.: You killed a cop. You think the police would ever stop looking for you now?",
        "Ava: Hey, hey, hey! I didn't have anything to do with that fire in that cabin, okay?",
        "J.J.: Well, I don't think Silas would say that, would he? So, why don't you just take the money and run?",
        "Ava: Why not? Why not? Thanks, Kid. That's actually the first thing you've said that's been worth listening to. Now see, I'm leaving a couple of bucks, so you can keep on living the high-life with your new daddy. Bye-bye now.",
        "Carly: J.J.?",
        "J.J.: Mom, I'm over here.",
        "Carly: Oh, J.J.",
        "J.J.: Mom -- they said they started a fire or something. Did something happen to Dad?",
        "Carly: No. No, Sweetheart, Dad's okay. He's going to be just fine. And so are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Dallas: I finally got word from the Manley P.D. Jack's been severely injured.",
        "Brad: Injured? How?",
        "Dallas: Jack and Carly were being held hostage in the cabin that caught fire. Carly's fine. Sorry, I can't give you more information about Jack, but he was still being assessed by the local docs last I heard.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brad: How's J.J.?",
        "Dallas: He was at the cabin before it exploded, but now he's missing again.",
        "Katie: Oh God!",
        "Brad: Okay -- where is Jack now?",
        "Dallas: My contact at the FBI said he's being transferred to a larger hospital, maybe even a trauma center in a neighboring state.",
        "Katie: So basically, you have no idea where he is?",
        "Dallas: Well, it's a remote part of the country, Katie. The Manley P.D. has got one sheriff and he's out in the field looking for J.J. cell phone reception is lousy. We're doing our best to find out more. As soon as we do I'll be in touch. I should get back to the station, though.",
        "Brad: Yeah, thanks for coming by.",
        "Dallas: Sorry it was bad news.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I knew it. I knew Jack was hurt. I knew something had happened. I tried to tell him before he left! Don't go! You're injured! You can't go out chasing after kidnappers --",
        "Brad: You couldn't have kept him from going. Nobody could've. Just -- look, listen to me. Try not to worry.",
        "Katie: How can I do that when no one can even tell us anything?",
        "Brad: Maybe Carly can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: Where's Dad?",
        "Carly: He's in the hospital. He was hurt. But the important thing is, he's going to be okay.",
        "J.J.: Well, can I talk to him?",
        "Carly: No. No, Sweetheart, there's no reception down here. We have to get out of here.",
        "J.J.: Before Silas gets back.",
        "Carly: That's right. You listen to me, I want you to know that I am very proud of you.",
        "J.J.: Why? None of this would've happened if it wasn't for me.",
        "Carly: This is not your fault.",
        "J.J.: What do you mean? I should've gone to you and dad the first time I talked to Ava.",
        "Carly: We have you back now. And that's all that matters, okay?",
        "J.J.: So, you and Dad came looking for me. So, you're --",
        "Carly: No. We're not together, J.J. but we are a family and we always will be. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So you want to make a man out of me? What does that mean?",
        "Col. Mayer: Do you remember when you were two years old, and I got ordered to go to Korea?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, I told you that you needed to be the man of the house. That you needed to take care of your mom. And I also told you not to cry. And you didn't. You were only two years old.",
        "Noah: So?",
        "Col. Mayer: So, I was very, very proud of you then. I never told you that, and for that I'm sorry. But I want you to know just how proud I am of you now.",
        "Noah: Why is that?",
        "Col. Mayer: For earning your way through college. You know -- the jobs, the scholarships, the loans -- I mean, you haven't given up on your goal. You're finding a way to make it happen. And I want to reward you for that.",
        "Noah: Does that mean you changed your mind? I can go to Northwestern?",
        "Col. Mayer: Northwestern isn't going to turn you into the great filmmaker you want to be. You know why?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, because you need to find something to say. You know? You need -- look, you're going into the entertainment business, Noah. You have to get ready for a lifetime of rejection. You know, you have to experience. You have to toughen up. You have to experience disappointment. You have to experience -- even failure. True hardship.",
        "Noah: That's going to make me a man in your eyes?",
        "Col. Mayer: A man of substance. You know what that means?",
        "Noah: Why don't you tell me what it means, Dad?",
        "Col. Mayer: It means that you don't always do the things you like to do, but that you learn to make sacrifices for the greater good. That's what it means. For example -- for example with, you know, in my day cooking and cleaning was woman's work, but when your mom died I learned that, you know, you had to make adjustments. So didn't I put a square meal on the table for you every night, and damned if I didn't learn to like KP. You know?",
        "Noah: So, what? You want me to learn how to cook?",
        "Col. Mayer: No. No, no, I want to give you a gift -- cash. You can do whatever you want with it. Make a film. I don't care, huh?",
        "Noah: You don't care?",
        "Col. Mayer: Only one condition. You enlist. You enlist, Noah, and I guarantee you the army -- it will give you everything you need to make it in this world, no matter what you choose to do.",

        "Lily: Okay, the suites are available for the dates you requested. I'm assuming you would like a tour?",
        "Cheri: Oh, that won't be necessary. I've already seen the rooms.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Cheri: I'm ready to sign on the dotted line.",
        "Lily: Good, good. I'm sure Lisa explained to you, with a reservation of this size, your deposit is nonrefundable, in case you cancel.",
        "Cheri: Sure, I understand.",
        "Lily: Well, good.",
        "Cheri: Unfortunately, I seem to have left my business credit card in the car. Do you mind if I run and get it?",
        "Lily: Take your time.",
        "Cheri: I'll be right back.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'll be here. Hey.",

        "Dusty: No, you're not.",
        "Lily: I'm an idiot.",
        "Dusty: Oh, she just wasn't on you radar. She's trying to turn your hotel into a brothel.",
        "Lily: Oh. And I almost let her. Oh my God. Oh my God. I can't believe it. I can't do anything right.",
        "Dusty: Don't be so hard on yourself.",
        "Lily: No, you don't understand. You have no idea. I have a hard enough time trying to be a wife and a mother and I can't even put a business deal together without causing a complete catastrophe.",
        "Dusty: Everything's fine. Just tell her the management had a change of heart and no longer wants her business. I'll take care of it.",
        "Lily: No. No. This is my hotel. I will handle it myself. Excuse me.",
        "Cheri: Found it.",
        "Lily: Forget it.",

        "Carly: Are you sure? Did Silas hurt you?",
        "J.J.: No, no. He -- no, he didn't hurt me. But he said he was going to raise me like a son. He was going to name me Jacob.",
        "Carly: That must have been so scary. You probably thought you'd never see us again.",
        "J.J.: No. No. I knew you'd find me.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry that it took so long. Did they feed you at least?",
        "J.J.: Yeah, they did. Yeah, oh, wait. Parker and Sage, are they okay?",
        "Carly: They will be once they know that we found you. Let's get out of here.",

        "Cheri: What did he say to you?",
        "Lily: That running the best little whore house in Oakdale wasn't part of my business plan.",
        "Cheri: Out of loyalty to one resident, do you know how much money you just cost yourself?",
        "Lily: Please, Dusty and I have been friends for years. I know where my loyalty lies. So please leave.",
        "Cheri: In other words, money talks and sex sells.",
        "Lily: Get out.",
        "Cheri: This is still a public establishment --",
        "Lily: Okay, that's fine. I'll have security throw you out. Excuse me.",
        "Cheri: What are you, the moral majority?",
        "Dusty: Just looking out for an old friend.",
        "Cheri: That's what always gets you into trouble, isn't it? Where do you get off, bouncing from Emily the call girl to her little sister, Alison, the porn star? What does that make you, except a hypocrite?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: With all your talk about honor all your life, you're bribing me to join the army now? I mean, where is the honor in that?",
        "Col. Mayer: It's not a bribe. It's a reward for hard work. I have to tell you though, Noah, I mean, volunteering to serve your country is something you should be eager to do.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being such a huge disappointment to you, but I am just not army material.",
        "Col. Mayer: Look -- mental toughness and discipline, those things can be taught. They're not in born, believe it or not.",
        "Noah: You don't think I have them?",
        "Col. Mayer: You're bright, okay? You're determined, but I just don't understand what you have against doing something where -- doing something worthwhile with your future.",
        "Noah: You know, I'm sorry you don't feel my passions are worthwhile. But I want you to know that I am extremely proud of your service. It's just not what I feel called to do with my life.",
        "Col. Mayer: I'm not asking for your life, Noah. I'm asking for a couple of years. Now if you want to go to college now, fine, go. Just sign up with ROTC. Noah, don't you feel you owe at least that much to the country that has given you such wonderful opportunities? The opportunities that you have here?",
        "Noah: The one thing you want from me seems to be the only thing I can't give you, so I'm sorry. I just don't know what else to say.",
        "Maddie: Guess what? I got in and I talked to the -- oh. I'm so sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Col. Mayer: Who's this?",

        "Noah: I told you.",
        "Col. Mayer: You know, I have had nothing to eat all day except some pretzels on the plane. What do you say we all go out to lunch?",
        "Noah: Uh, Dad, we have to work.",
        "Col. Mayer: Work -- you're an intern. Surely they'll allow you a lunch break. Madelyn is it? Madelyn, I bet a woman of your considerable charm can persuade my son to have a civil conversation with his father.",

        "Katie: Why is this so hard?",
        "Brad: I know, I know, this is frustrating. But there are only so many hospitals, okay? We will find him, Katie.",
