        "Molly: I saw an announcement in the paper today about the memorial service, and they said if you had pictures, that you could bring them in.",
        "Holden: That's a great photo. Look at how in love they are.",
        "Molly: I remember when I took it. But I wasn't sure if Carly would want anything coming from me.",
        "Holden: You never do know, do you? Exactly when it's gonna hit. That stab in the heart when you suddenly realize -- he's not coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Oh, my God. Jack! What are you --?",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Julia: What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I was looking for you.",
        "Julia: Oh, my God. You slept outside all night? Jack, you had a fever yesterday. What are you --? Are you going for pneumonia now?",
        "Jack: No, I was looking for a phone booth. And then, when I stopped looking, I didn't know where else to go.",
        "Julia: What were you looking for?",
        "Jack: A name. Something -- anything that might give me a clue about who I am and how the hell I got here. But when found the phone book, I went through it, and I couldn't even find you.",
        "Julia: Listen, there's something that you need to understand, Jack.",
        "Jack: I've been here before.",
        "Julia: What?",
        "Jack: I went to the park, and I hung out on one of the benches and somebody found me here --",
        "Julia: Uh-huh. When was this?",
        "Jack: It was you. You came to me, like you're doing right now. Why won't you be honest with me, Julia? Why won't you admit you're my wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I brought these. I don't know what we were laughing about there, but we laughed until we cried.",
        "Molly: He loved your kids.",
        "Holden: Yeah, he sure did. Carly asked me to say something at the service, but I don't know --",
        "Molly: No, you should. He was your best friend. Who would know better than you?",
        "Holden: I don't know what to say. I can't even explain this to my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Thank you for coming so early. Quickly, too.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. What's going on?",
        "Sierra: I have some information I want to share with you.",
        "Dusty: Why me?",
        "Sierra: Because it's sensitive, and I don't trust it with anyone else. Not my mother -- certainly not Lily.",
        "Dusty: If you're trying to convince me to go after Craig again -- it's done. It's done. It's finished business.",
        "Sierra: Right before Wade Larsen kidnapped Lucy, I gave Craig $2 million.",
        "Dusty: You what?",
        "Sierra: That's right. I would hate to think that I helped finance my own daughter's kidnapping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: We must be on the same wavelength -- I was just about to call you.",
        "Lucy: I'm actually looking for Dusty.",
        "Craig: Huh? Oh, well. A little early for night-crawlers. Anything I can do?",
        "Lucy: No. There's just something I need to tell him.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, that sounds important.",
        "Lucy: It is. Well, you might as well know, too. It's about school. I've decided not to go to Williams.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Oh, no --",
        "Lucy: There's no point in arguing, I've made up my mind. I'm staying in Oakdale.",
        "Craig: Over my dead body!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: There's no sign of Cabot -- anywhere.",
        "Hal: I'm afraid the news isn't good -- one of the techs I.D.'D a fragment of a child's baby seat and part of a baby's shoe.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, my God.",
        "Jordan: No.",
        "Hal: I'm so sorry.",
        "Jordan: That's not true -- Jen, it can't be true.",
        "Carly: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Paul: How you feeling?",
        "Rosanna: Where's Cabot? Where's my baby?",
        "Paul: I tried. I tried really hard --",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying? What are you talking about? You said that you were going to get him, you promised --",
        "Paul: Everything happened so quickly. Suddenly, there was this explosion, this huge explosion --",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my God, is he hurt? Is he here?",
        "Paul: No, Rosanna, he's not -- he isn't here.",
        "Rosanna: Then where is he? Who's taking care of him?",
        "Carly: Hal is at the cabin, Rosanna. And Jennifer and Jordan are there.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my God --",
        "Paul: Listen, Rosanna -- the explosion, it was enormous. You were knocked unconscious and you weren't even inside.",
        "Rosanna: I gotta go! I gotta go! I gotta make sure that he's okay!",
        "Paul: I can't let you go.",
        "Rosanna: I gotta go there!",
        "Paul: I won't let you go.",
        "Carly: Paul, we'll take her. She has to go, no matter what she finds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: It's a miracle that your fever didn't come back. But you're pale and I'm sure you're dehydrated. You shouldn't have left the hospital.",
        "Jack: I didn't. You're the one that ran out on me. Why'd you leave?",
        "Julia: Because I didn't think that you were getting the help that you needed. You know, to be honest with you, we just don't have the kind of people on staff to deal with a case like yours. We're not equipped.",
        "Jack: Since when am I a case for you? You know I'm more than that. Look, whatever happened, we can work through it. If you would just stop playing games with me.",
        "Julia: I'm not!",
        "Jack: Then why don't you wear your wedding ring?",
        "Julia: Oh --",
        "Jack: Did I say something to hurt you? Did I upset you? Are we divorced?",
        "Julia: Jack, you know what? I can't answer your questions.",
        "Jack: Why not, Julia?! You obviously know more than you're telling me. Why don't you just --? Why don't you just tell me the truth?",
        "Julia: Can you do me a favor, do you think? Could you just stop asking me questions for a minute? And if you do, I'll take you back to my place, I'll make you something to eat. We'll go from there, okay?",
        "Jack: I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.",
        "Julia: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Molly, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Molly: You just lost your best friend.",
        "Holden: I just can't -- I can't.",
        "Molly: We could go get a cup of coffee.",
        "Holden: No, I think I'm gonna head over to my mother's place. Can you believe as broken up as she is about this whole thing, she cut and arranged flowers for the altar?",
        "Molly: I can pick them up.",
        "Holden: No, that's okay, thanks -- I just need to keep moving, you know? Because if I don't, I don't know if I'll be able to do anything.",
        "Lily: Molly -- I thought Holden might be here.",
        "Molly: He was.",
        "Lily: Do you know where he went?",
        "Molly: He went over to Emma's.",
        "Lily: Okay. Great, I'm gonna head over there.",
        "Molly: He's picking up the flowers, but if you need me to help with anything, I can.",
        "Lily: No, it's Sierra. Things are really a mess right now, and I just -- I need to talk to Holden.",
        "Molly: Lily, look -- I understand about your sister, and I'm sorry. I know you're worried --",
        "Lily: I really can't talk right now. I have to go.",
        "Molly: No, no, no. And I get that. But -- I'm not trying to intrude, but do you even know that your husband's heart is breaking right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Sweetness, I know that you need time recuperate. But I just don't agree with where you propose to do it.",
        "Lucy: Why not?",
        "Craig: Because I know the reason you are bailing on Williams is not because you're not crazy about it.",
        "Lucy: Oh, no?",
        "Craig: The only reason you're thinking about staying in Oakdale is Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: What are you thinking?",
        "Dusty: I'm thinking that Lucy's not gonna like hearing -- again -- that her own father had her kidnapped.",
        "Sierra: But if Craig set her up, and tracing the money that I gave him could prove that, could you really live with yourself knowing that you didn't do anything to expose it? I don't think I can.",
        "Dusty: Sierra, I put Lucy through a lot. I can't put her through any more.",
        "Sierra: Listen, this is breaking my heart more than I can possibly tell you. But I believe that you care about her. So you must agree with me. That for her own good, we have to find out the truth.",
        "Dusty: Let's just say we have solid proof that Craig did it, and we show Lucy -- you realize, we both stand a chance of losing her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I have been spreading myself a little thin lately, Molly, but I don't owe you anything. Excuse me.",
        "Molly: Look, Lily, I know about Lucy being missing and --",
        "Lily: No, not just \"missing,\" she almost died! And I almost died trying to save her.",
        "Molly: Okay, this isn't a competition about whose heart is breaking more, and I understand that you have your share of sorrow, just like everybody else. But running around and trying to find Holden so you can demand even more of him when he is already spread so thin --",
        "Lily: Holden knows that I have empathy for him and I support him. It's unspoken. We know how to get through bad times. That's why our marriage works, Molly.",
        "Molly: Like it's working now?",
        "Lily: You got some nerve, I tell you. You have some nerve, standing there, preaching to me about how I'm not a good wife. What kind of friend are you?",
        "Molly: Excuse me?",
        "Lily: You are somebody that my husband took into our home, protected you, watched over you. And how do you repay him? By telling his wife that I'm not giving him enough attention? I don't want your opinion, I don't need your opinion. You know, I don't even need you in my life. And neither does Holden!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: My decision not to go to Williams has nothing to do with Dusty.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Oh, no?",
        "Lucy: You know what? It doesn't matter. My reasons are my business, anyway. And if I'm old enough to survive this God-awful summer, then I'm old enough to decide when and where I go to college!",
        "Craig: Come here, sweetness, come here. Let me buy you a soda pop. Sit down. Come on, come on. We got to be able to talk without jumping down each other's throats. I wanted to tell you there's a memorial service for Jack Snyder this afternoon.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I heard about that.",
        "Craig: I was hoping you might come with me.",
        "Lucy: Of course. But why do I get the feeling you're trying to make a connection between that and me not going to Williams?",
        "Craig: Because you're brilliant.",
        "Lucy: Daddy --",
        "Craig: Well, you're my daughter, come on. You got to remember that fate can be fickle. I bet Jack woke up on that day that he died thinking that he had all the time in the world. Fix all the things he'd done wrong.",
        "Lucy: I know you're upset about Jack.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Carly's your friend. It's random and it's horrible. And it makes us both think of Bryant and what happened. But you cannot -- you cannot use that to scare me into going to Massachusetts if I don't want to go.",
        "Craig: Have you told your mother?",
        "Lucy: No, not yet.",
        "Craig: She's going to Montega today.",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm driving her to the airport. She's got enough going on with Alan and everything and --",
        "Craig: You're not gonna use your mother's grief as an excuse to get out of this, young lady. Come on. Let's go tell her. Let us enlighten her, shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why me? Why don't you hire a private investigator or something?",
        "Sierra: Because to you, it's personal. Nobody's gonna care like you do. And you protected Lucy when it would have been easier to save yourself. You put her own well-being above your own. And that is what I'm counting on.",
        "Dusty: Okay. All right. I know a good place to start.",
        "Sierra: Where?",
        "Dusty: When I caught up with Wade in Reno, he had a fat suitcase full of cash. At least a million bucks -- $2 million at least.",
        "Sierra: But where is that money?",
        "Dusty: I had it. I had it, then Lucy came in, I had to run after her.",
        "Sierra: And the suitcase?",
        "Dusty: I left it -- I left the money in the hotel room, everything.",
        "Sierra: You left $2 million behind to save Lucy?",
        "Dusty: Well, I was cut up pretty bad, you know? I was in no shape to carrying a big stash around.",
        "Sierra: Well, listen -- you find that money and you connect it to Craig, you can have it.",
        "Dusty: I don't want it. That money's cursed. It's cursed.",
        "Sierra: We have to know if Craig did this.",
        "Dusty: We know.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Craig: Sierra, Lucy wanted to see you --",
        "Lucy: Dusty? What are you doing here?",
        "Sierra: He was looking for you.",
        "Lucy: I went to Metro looking for you.",
        "Craig: Well, well -- well, we've all found one another.",
        "Sierra: What's going on?",
        "Lucy: Um -- I was doing some thinking last night. And I've decided that going to Williams would be a mistake. I'm gonna call admissions and --",
        "Sierra: I don't believe this.",
        "Craig: You see, Lucy, it's not just your unreasonable old man.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, tell them -- tell them what you think.",
        "Dusty: I'm with your folks on this one. If don't go to school, I think you're out of your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: If you don't mind denim and plaid, I think I have some clothes down in the basement that might fit you. You could take a shower, I'll lay them out on the bed for you.",
        "Jack: I don't remember any of this.",
        "Julia: There's no reason why you should.",
        "Jack: No, I pictured walking in here and -- bam, everything would come flooding back.",
        "Julia: Jack, I'm sorry. Maybe that's not the way it's going to be for you. Maybe -- maybe it'll be more like little flashes that you'll be able to piece together.",
        "Jack: Would you stop dancing around this and just -- give me some straight answers for once, please.",
        "Julia: Okay.",
        "Jack: Did we live together?",
        "Julia: No.",
        "Jack: Who are you?",
        "Julia: You know who I am, Jack. I'm Julia Latrobe. I'm a nurse at St. Genevieve's hospital. That's it.",
        "Jack: Have you and I ever been married? At all?",
        "Julia: Dr. Greenwood keeps telling me that I should encourage these connections that you're feeling --",
        "Jack: Answer me!",
        "Julia: No, Jack, we're not married. And no, we never have been.",
        "Jack: But you seem so familiar to me --",
        "Julia: I don't know why that is. But this is the whole truth -- I had never seen you before you came into the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: No one can hurt Cabot anymore, honey. No one.",
        "Rosanna: Where's Cabot?",
        "Hal: I'm sorry, Rosanna. The forensic team thinks that the explosion killed Cabot instantly.",
        "Carly: Oh, God! Oh, God, no!",
        "Paul: Rosanna, just stop. Just stop.",
        "[Rosanna sobbing]",
        "Rosanna: Cabot!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: You're stuck with me until you get your memory back.",
        "Jack: Why? Why would you do that? You already said you don't know me.",
        "Julia: Well, maybe I'd like to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Rosanna, Nikki found this in the mailbox to this place. It's addressed to you. It's from James.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I can't believe you're siding with them on this.",
        "Dusty: This is between you and your folks.",
        "Craig: Well, you see? Even the unimpeachable Dusty Donovan thinks you're doing the wrong thing.",
        "Sierra: Can I have a minute alone with Lucy please?",
        "Craig: Sure. Sure. See you later, sweetness?",
        "Lucy: Dusty didn't say what he really felt because he didn't want to fight with you two.",
        "Sierra: You know, I don't really want to talk about Dusty. This is about you and your choices. And I think you are making a very big decision at a difficult time.",
        "Lucy: But that doesn't mean it's not the right decision.",
        "Sierra: Perhaps. And listen -- I don't dress you anymore. And I don't tie your shoes anymore. But I do love you. So I'd like to make a request.",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Sierra: I want you to call Williams. And I want you to tell them that you are going through a difficult family time. And that you're not sure, but you might want to delay enrolling a little bit.",
        "Lucy: What would be the point of that?",
        "Sierra: It would leave the door open.",
        "Lucy: I'm not gonna change my mind. Besides, classes start in a few days.",
        "Sierra: So much can change in just a few days. I found that out the hard way.",
        "Lucy: Okay. All right. I won't make anything definite. I'm going to be okay, Mom.",
        "Sierra: Believe me. I am counting on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can't believe this. Everything in my gut was telling me that -- you really never knew me?",
        "Julia: No.",
        "Jack: But your -- I mean, your name and your smile and the way you took care of me -- how come it felt like I had seen that before?",
        "Julia: Honestly, Jack, I don't know.",
        "Jack: Maybe it was me. Maybe I just wanted to be sure of something. I guess, anything.",
        "Julia: Dr. Greenwood, you know, felt that if I -- if I let you keep on believing, you know if I -- but I didn't try to tell you that you were wrong about me, maybe your memory will go back together on its own.",
        "Jack: So much for the doctor's theory!",
        "Julia: I'm sorry, Jack. I hated leading you on like that, I mean --",
        "Jack: What now? What do I do? Where do I go?",
        "Julia: Just -- how about if we take it slow? How about this? What if you take a shower, change your clothes. I'll make you something to eat. And then we'll figure out where to go from there. Does that sound okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Julia: Okay. Down the hall, second door on the left.",
        "Jack: Hey. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Carly, go home. Let somebody else take care of Rosanna.",
        "Carly: No! She's my sister. I'm not going to abandon her now!",
        "Hal: Carly, you've got Jack's memorial this afternoon. Give yourself a break.",
        "Carly: Cabot was my nephew. I can't help Jack. But I can be here for my sister.",
        "Nikki: Hey. I saw the mailbox for this place down the road. The red flag was up, so I looked inside. CSI checked for latents.",
        "Carly: It's addressed to Rosanna.",
        "Nikki: None.",
        "Hal: Hey. Go get Sinclair.",
        "Investigator: Yes, sir.",
        "Hal: Go get Rosanna?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Hal: This note, it's from James, right?",
        "Nikki: Yeah, I read it. You wouldn't believe what it says.",
        "Jordan: What is it?",
        "Hal: Rosanna, Nikki found this in the mailbox to this place. It's addressed to you. It's from James.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You're still here?",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Holden: What are you doing?",
        "Molly: You said you were gonna say some things at the service. So I just thought I would jot down some stuff.",
        "Holden: Could I see?",
        "Molly: Sure.",
        "Holden: \"Some things I know about Jack Snyder -- it was impossible to pick up a check when Jack Snyder was in the room. He could be down to this last ten bucks and he'd still tell you that your money was no good.\" You're right. That was Jack. \"Jack hated imported beer and foreign cars. And he loved the Cubs, even though they broke his heart last year in the playoffs. Jack loved to laugh. He loved Chris Rock and 'the Honeymooners.' He sang 'Ragtime Cowboy Joe' to put his kids to sleep. He thought Carly Tenney and her son and their daughter were the best things that ever happened to him.\" This is great.",
        "Molly: So was Jack.",
        "Holden: Why did you do this?",
        "Molly: You've been helping me out so much lately that I just wanted to return the favor before I leave.",
        "Holden: Leave? What are you talking about?",
        "Molly: I realized something today. I don't belong here anymore and I haven't in a long time. So -- so I'm going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: I really don't have time.",
        "Lily: You wouldn't take my phone calls, so I just -- I had to -- you cannot leave like this. We -- we can't even seem to talk to each other.",
        "Sierra: You know, I'm not avoiding you. I just -- I just needed some time to think.",
        "Lily: How do you process this? Being alone to bury your husband? I want to go with you. Can I at least take you to the airport?",
        "Sierra: Lucy's taking me.",
        "Lily: Well, I need to do something, because I feel totally helpless.",
        "Sierra: Well, I don't know what to tell you. The arrangements have been made.",
        "Lily: Please, Sierra -- I've already lost one sister last year, please!",
        "Sierra: I promise you, you are not losing a sister. But I just don't know how to be around you right now.",
        "Lily: You cannot let what happened with Alan divide us.",
        "Sierra: Why not? He was my husband. I mean, you know, maybe it's my fault. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I shouldn't have married him so impetuously. And I should have given all of you a chance to get to know him. Then you would know that he couldn't have possibly done this. And you would have been his champion and not his accuser.",
        "Lily: Someone is responsible for what happened to Lucy. It was either Alan, or Craig. And I know Craig. He would never, ever do something like that. I know it.",
        "Sierra: I am not going to stop until I find out everything. And maybe -- maybe after I uncover all that, we can be close again. Can you accept that?",
        "Lily: I don't have a choice. Do I? I know you. I know you will think this through. And you will come to peace with this.",
        "Sierra: It's all right.",
        "Lily: Look, you have to believe that I love you.",
        "Sierra: I do. I do.",

        "Dusty: Yeah, I need a flight to Reno. Of course, Nevada. I'll call back. What do you want?",
        "Craig: I wanted to thank you for helping out with Lucy -- again.",
        "Dusty: Lucy should definitely go to school. It's the best thing for her.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Yes, and I was surprised to find you with Sierra.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? Just looking for Lucy.",
        "Craig: Well, it seemed like you were having a nice little chinwag.",
        "Dusty: I was expressing my condolences for her loss.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Her husband was murdered, remember that?",
        "Craig: Lucy's been through a lot.",
        "Dusty: You're telling me she's been through a lot?",
        "Craig: Her life is complicated. She doesn't need you adding to that.",
        "Dusty: I'm just making sure she has the life she's supposed to have.",
        "Craig: Good. Then we're on the same page.",

        "James: My lovely Rosanna, I hope you haven't suffered any ill effects from last night's display of pyrotechnics. But I'm sure any injuries you sustained will be offset by my son Paul's display of devotion. I can't imagine he's told you, so allow me to let you in on a little secret. I gave Paul a choice of whom to save -- Cabot or you. Because, unfortunately, there wasn't time enough to save you both. By now it's obvious he chose you! Ain't love grand? P.S. -- Too bad about Cabot. Such a cute kid.",
        "Paul: What did it say?",
        "Rosanna: He gave you a choice?",
        "Paul: No -- please don't do this --",
        "Rosanna: Me or Cabot? You could have saved Cabot?",
        "Paul: No. There wasn't time.",
        "Rosanna: I told you. I told you to save him first.",
        "Paul: I know. And I was on my way back inside.",
        "Rosanna: I told you that's what I wanted.",
        "Paul: There was no way I was gonna let you die, Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: I'm dead! I'm nothing!",
        "Paul: No, that's not true.",
        "Rosanna: Why didn't you let me die?! Why didn't you let me die?!",

        "Dusty: Arriving in Reno when? Thank you.",
        "Lucy: Are you going somewhere?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Chicago.",
        "Lucy: You weren't going to tell me?",
        "Dusty: Sweetheart, I've been chasing you around all summer, and my business is in the toilet. I gotta see my accountant.",
        "Lucy: How long?",
        "Dusty: A couple days, max.",
        "Lucy: Do you really think that I should go away to school?",
        "Dusty: I think you should listen to your mother.",
        "Lucy: I did. I told her I wouldn't make a decision for a few days.",
        "Dusty: Your mother's the only one looking after you 100% of the time -- after your interests. Remember that. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Are you talking about a vacation?",
        "Molly: No. No, I'm talking about leaving town for good.",
        "Holden: You can't. You can't just take off.",
        "Molly: Why not? Jake left me well-taken care of and, you know, I've made some pretty good investments on my own. Everyone I ever loved here is either dead or gone or they hate my guts. So I have a job to quit and a hefty share in my club to sell. And I will be out of here.",
        "Holden: That's not true, you know?",
        "Molly: What isn't?",
        "Holden: That you don't have any reason to stay in town. You do have a reason, you have a really good one.",

        "Julia: Hey. You know, you're not alone.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Julia: I ran out on you yesterday, but now you know why. I'm not going to leave again. You're stuck with me until you get your memory back.",

        "Carly: We'll go to my place, okay?",
        "Paul: There wasn't enough time. I didn't know what to do. I mean, how do you do that? How do you make someone decide who lives and dies?",
        "Jordan: I'm sorry. I have to go see Rosanna.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, I'll drive you.",
        "Paul: I should have thrown myself on the bomb.",
        "Jennifer: You did everything you could. I know that.",
        "Hal: Don't blame yourself, Paul. Most people would call what you did pretty damned heroic. James Stenbeck is a monster, and giving you a choice like that -- you did the best you could.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna -- I'm gonna hunt him down, Hal. And I'm gonna kill him.",
        "Hal: You can't fight a man who would use a baby like that --",
        "Paul: Do what he did to Rosanna.",
        "Hal: You saved Rosanna's life. And she can't thank you yet, Paul, but she will. You did your level best.",
