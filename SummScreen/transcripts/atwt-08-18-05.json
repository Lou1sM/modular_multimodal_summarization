        "Mike: We are alone? It's not possible.",
        "Katie: Totally, completely alone. Come here.",
        "Mike: I should check the flowerbeds first, make sure Maddie's footprints aren't out there.",
        "Katie: Oh, stop it. She's not that bad. She's actually kind of sweet.",
        "Mike: In a door-slammed-in-my-face kind of way, she's a big fan.",
        "Katie: Well, it's okay. Your fan club's already full. And as president, I officially call this meeting into order.",
        "[Katie giggles]",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Gwen: Just a sec. Oh, it's you.",
        "Will: Yeah, don't act so excited.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, I thought it was --",
        "Will: Yeah, the lawyer, I figured. Look at this place.",
        "Gwen: It's okay?",
        "Will: I smell air freshener.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, I plugged some in. It's safer than candles.",
        "Will: And you're okay with not smoking?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I should've quit when I was pregnant.",
        "Will: And you've actually read these?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I started.",
        "Will: Nice basket.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah. Hey, touch the pad. Tell me if you think its firm enough.",
        "Will: For what?",
        "Gwen: For the baby.",
        "Will: You're gonna put your baby in a laundry basket?",
        "Gwen: It's his bassinet.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: Hey, look, it's all I could afford. After I get custody, I can use some money to get him a big one.",
        "Will: Yeah, that was rude. I'm sorry. You should throw me out.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: For being a jerk that was totally rude. Just throw me out. Fine, I'll throw myself out. Uh-oh. Gwen, you might want to come out here and take a look at this.",
        "Gwen: What is that?",
        "Will: I don't know. A couple of delivery guys came up here with it.",
        "Gwen: Oh! Will, it's a crib!",
        "Will: Ow. Yeah. Not really a laundry basket, some assembly required.",
        "Gwen: This is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.",
        "Will: All right. Okay. Let's get inside before your lawyer gets here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I guess we're early.",
        "Jack: First ones.",
        "Carly: Well, shouldn't our lawyer be here by now?",
        "Jack: She'll be here, don't worry.",
        "Carly: I just want to get this over with as quickly as possible. I have a million things to do.",
        "Jack: Like what?",
        "Carly: Like a lot of things. Like, first I have to get Rory a new carrier.",
        "Jack: Sage's is fine.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't. It's worn. Besides, they make them much better now.",
        "Jack: Okay, let's just wait and see.",
        "Carly: You don't think we'll win.",
        "Jack: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Carly: That's exactly what you're saying.",
        "Jack: Honey, I just don't want you to get your --",
        "Carly: You don't want me to get my hopes up. I know. Well, it's too late for that. Rosanna wanted us to be the guardian of her child, and I don't believe that any decent judge would let us leave this courtroom without permanent custody. We will raise Rory, Jack, until Rosanna can do it for herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Is that --",
        "Jasmine: Ice? Yeah, my treat.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Jasmine: There's nothing to be afraid of. See? No shakes. But after a long shoot, there is no better friend than crystal meth. And Jen, if you ask me, you look like you could really use a friend about now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You mean it? You'll help me keep Emily away from Jennifer?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Paul: I'll handle it. That's all you need to know.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I know you wouldn't actually admit this, but I do think maybe you've come to your senses that this thing with Emily has run its course.",
        "Paul: Wrong, as usual. Emily is very important to me.",
        "Barbara: I see. And because she's so important to you, you're going to jump on the bandwagon and keep her away from your sister.",
        "Paul: Well, you've been spending a lot of time with my sister these days. Maybe I'm just trying to shield Emily from you.",
        "Barbara: You know what, honey? I can see the signs. There's trouble in paradise. I'd stake my life on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Did Paul hurt you? Damn it, Emily, if he laid a hand on you, I swear --",
        "Emily: No, no, no, it's not like that, Hal.",
        "Hal: What happened?",
        "Emily: Why do I do it?",
        "Hal: Do what?",
        "Emily: I set myself up. God, is there not enough attention in the world?",
        "Hal: Well, you take your share.",
        "Emily: Oh, thanks.",
        "Hal: Just being honest.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I always hated that about you.",
        "Hal: Talk to me, Emily. What's Paul up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Where do you want this thing once it's set up? If it is ever set up.",
        "Gwen: Wherever.",
        "Will: It's kind of big.",
        "Gwen: I'm not gonna be here forever. Hey, I'm getting another place. Nothing fancy, but maybe with a little back yard and a tree for a swing.",
        "Will: Sounds nice.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Gwen: That must be the lawyer.",
        "Will: Isn't he kind of early?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but there's nothing we can do about it. How do I look?",
        "Will: Like a mother. I'll get the door.",
        "Cass: Hi. I'm Cass Winthrop.",
        "Will: Will Munson. Gwen's been expecting you. Come on in.",
        "Gwen: Hi. Sorry about the mess. I'm really glad you're here, Mr. Winthrop.",
        "Cass: You're Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Norbeck, your client.",
        "Will: I understand that you've done some work for my mother, Barbara Ryan?",
        "Cass: Oh, right.",
        "Will: Okay, so let's all sit down and --",
        "Cass: Where?",
        "Gwen: Sorry, let me get this stuff out of your way.",
        "Cass: You know, that's okay, I really can't stay. I'm sorry, Miss Norbeck, but there's obviously been a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know I'm on your side. And the baby's. But there's what we want, and what the law will allow us, honey.",
        "Carly: The law is wrong.",
        "Jack: Maybe, but with Rosanna's condition being worse --",
        "Carly: It's just a setback! It's just a setback, Jack.",
        "Jack: Honey, Rosanna's not coming home.",
        "Carly: You know, that's exactly the same thing they told me about you.",
        "Jack: This is different.",
        "Carly: Why? Miracles happen every day, Jack. People come out of comas every day. Doctors discover cures every day.",
        "Jack: I want that every bit as much as you do.",
        "Carly: Then, please, stop being so negative.",
        "Jack: I'm being realistic.",
        "Carly: And I'm not?",
        "Jack: You're thinking with your heart.",
        "Carly: Is there something wrong with that?",
        "Jack: No, honey. But Gwen isn't doing this to hurt you or Rosanna. She's exercising her legal rights.",
        "Carly: What about the baby's rights?",
        "Jack: Honey, if you would just put yourself in Gwen's shoes --",
        "Carly: I would want to offer my child a chance at a better life.",
        "Jack: I just want you to be prepared for what might happen in there today.",
        "Carly: I am.",
        "Jack: Are you?",
        "Carly: Rosanna wants us to have Rory. And that gives me strength, Jack. I finally feel like I can move on. For months, I've been living in the past, I've been agonizing about things that I can barely remember.",
        "Jack: The accusations that iris made? Honey, I still don't believe you did what she said you did.",
        "Carly: Whatever happened, I can't change it. All I can do is show Iris and Gwen and anybody else who gets in my way that today, right now, I am taking my life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I've gotta go.",
        "Hal: Where? Back to Paul's? Breathe, Emily.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Hal: Breathe, in, out, slowly.",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa, suddenly we're a Zen master? Trust me, there's enough breathing in the world.",
        "Hal: That's gotten me through a lot. Three marriages to Barbara, being shot at, raising a ton of kids --",
        "Emily: Me walking out?",
        "Hal: I'm still working on that.",
        "Emily: Remember when Jennifer came back to town, you know, in the very beginning? And she needed someone. Not like a mom, but a friend, you know? Someone to go shopping with, talk to?",
        "Hal: You were great with her.",
        "Emily: Yeah, we were friends.",
        "Hal: More.",
        "Emily: I love Jennifer. You know. I love Will.",
        "Hal: Who says you don't? Why did you start talking about Jennifer, anyway?",
        "Emily: No reason.",
        "Hal: Did something happen?",
        "Emily: I just -- I hate seeing her go through this, you know? And I want so badly to help her.",
        "Hal: But?",
        "Emily: I can't. I can't -- don't ask, okay? I just --",
        "Hal: I'm sorry, laying off isn't my style.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know that. It's Paul, you know? He just doesn't understand. And then there's Barbara.",
        "Hal: What did she do?",
        "Emily: She accused me of wanting to hurt Jennifer and the family.",
        "Hal: When?",
        "Emily: This morning. Actually yesterday, at the christening for Rosanna's baby.",
        "Hal: What happened?",
        "Emily: Jennifer came, and the baby started crying. Jennifer thought it was her baby. She told everyone, \"That's my baby.\"",
        "Hal: Oh. That poor kid.",
        "Emily: Hal, I just want to make this right.",
        "Hal: Nobody can make it right.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but what if I could? What if I could do something?",
        "Hal: Like what?",
        "Emily: Paul -- he says I should just stay away from her.",
        "Hal: He said that?",
        "Emily: He's not himself, you know.",
        "Hal: Did he get mad? Emily, he's got to know you were only trying to pitch in.",
        "Emily: I can't talk about this. I want to so badly, I just can't, I can't.",
        "Hal: Its okay, it's okay. You just take your time. I'll tell you what, I'll order you something to eat.",
        "Emily: I'm not hungry.",
        "Hal: I'll order anyway.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, I'm gonna go to the ladies room.",
        "Hal: Go ahead.",
        "Emily: Excuse me.",
        "Hal: I'll be right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Emily and I are fine. Don't make trouble.",
        "Barbara: I'm just saying I want Emily as far away from my daughter as possible.",
        "Paul: Okay. Emily will keep her distance.",
        "Barbara: Don't humor me.",
        "Paul: Humor you? Tell me something, what would humor you? I'd really like to know.",
        "Barbara: You know, all of the sudden, you're acting like a pushover. [Cell phone rings] I have to take this. Excuse me.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me.",
        "Paul: Answer your phone. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Barbara: Hello?",
        "Hal: What the hell's going on, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Charming, Hal.",
        "Hal: I just ran into Emily at Al's. She's practically in tears. Why did you blow up at her?",
        "Barbara: Stop growling. I haven't done anything to your precious Emily.",
        "Hal: You want to do this in person?",
        "Barbara: How about showing a little concern for your daughter?",
        "Hal: The last thing Jen needs right now is you carving up somebody who's only trying to help her.",
        "Barbara: You know what? Jen is finally getting help from Dr. Michaels. And she was making progress until Emily showed up and upset her all over again.",
        "Hal: Emily cares about --",
        "Barbara: Nobody. Underneath that hip, desperate housewife facade is the same little old troublemaker who walked out on you. Have a nice day.",
        "Paul: What was that about?",
        "Barbara: Hal is apparently licking Emily's wounds over at Al's.",
        "Paul: Did Emily say anything to Hal?",
        "Barbara: How would I know?",
        "Paul: Tell Jennifer I'll call her. I'm gonna go.",
        "Barbara: Whoa. That got his attention.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jasmine: You sure?",
        "Jennifer: Thanks. I don't want any.",
        "Jasmine: Last chance.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. I'm okay, really.",
        "Jasmine: Then come to Chicago with me. We'll hang out after my shoot. We have the best crew. And you remember Livio?",
        "Jennifer: Angeliri? Yeah. Yeah, I worked with him.",
        "Jasmine: Milan -- that's right. He's our designer, hysterical as ever. The man never met a fine line he couldn't erase. \"Cara, the beauty is in the eyes.\" Jen, let's do it. Like old times. Come on, don't you miss it? The travel, the food, the wine, the freebies, V.I.P. All the way. Europe loved you. You'd jump in without missing a beat. Photographers still ask for you. Especially Jean Luc. And yes, he's as gorgeous as ever. You know, my little helper also sheds a couple pounds here and there.",
        "[Jennifer scoffs]",
        "Jennifer: I'd much prefer working behind the scenes.",
        "Jasmine: So work for Street Jeans. Design and model. Have it all.",
        "Barbara: I had the most irritating run-in with your brother. Jasmine? Jasmine Skyler? Well, it is wonderful to see you. How's Robin?",
        "Jasmine: Oh, ditzy as ever.",
        "Barbara: Oh, honey, you must be thrilled to see her. When'd you get in?",
        "Jennifer: Mom, stop pretending, okay? I know that Jasmine called and talked to you already.",
        "Barbara: Well, it does my heart good to see the two of you together, I will tell you that. And I'm sure you've caught up in all the latest dirt in the modeling field. Don't even try to keep me in the dark, 'cause I'll find out. I always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's never too early for candles.",
        "Mike: You okay?",
        "Katie: I love you so much.",
        "Mike: But you still feel guilty about spending the day together.",
        "Katie: It's just hard to be happy when I think about what Jennifer's going through.",
        "Mike: I know. I keep thinking we'll have the chance to talk and forgive each other.",
        "Katie: I want that with Henry, too. I really love him. You know that. He's been a big part of my life forever.",
        "Mike: I understand. He's your best friend. Mine, too, most days.",
        "Katie: I just mistook friendship for something more and ended up hurting everybody.",
        "Mike: Those days are over. No more confusion.",
        "Katie: Nope. 'Cause I'm right where I want to be. In your arms.",
        "Mike: Mmm. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Honey, I want to move on, too. But I can't promise that Rory is going to be a part of that. We may be able to stall Gwen today, but sooner or later, the court's gonna rule in her favor.",
        "Carly: Or not.",
        "Ms. Todd: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Carly: Hey, hey. Did you get my message?",
        "Ms. Todd: Well, that's why I'm late. I researched precedents.",
        "Jack: What precedents?",
        "Carly: I'll fill Jack in, and then we'll meet you inside.",
        "Jack: What are you planning?",
        "Carly: Just a way to get Gwen Norbeck out of our lives -- permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey. Why did you even come here if you aren't gonna take my case?",
        "Cass: You mean the case you misrepresented? You told my assistant quite a story, didn't you, Ms. Norbeck?",
        "Will: What's he talking about?",
        "Cass: She said this case was very high-profile, kept talking about Rosanna Cabot of Cabot Motors and how all the networks would be lined up for exclusives.",
        "Will: The networks?",
        "Cass: I had to put two of my top clients on hold to race down here from Bay City. Then I find out that Rosanna Cabot is in a hospital in Switzerland, and she's never going to be near a courtroom.",
        "Gwen: But she's got a sister who lives here. That's the woman who's got my kid.",
        "Will: And Craig Montgomery's always good for a story.",
        "Cass: Montgomery? What's his connection?",
        "Will: He's the adopted father.",
        "Gwen: But he's in jail now for attempted murder. Anyway, Rosanna left that baby a whole bunch of money.",
        "Cass: Is that so?",
        "Will: Yeah, but you know, if this is gonna be a waste of your time, you should just go back to Bay City right now.",
        "Cass: That's very thoughtful of you, kid, but it's a long drive back, and it's a shame to waste the trip. So why don't I pull up a milk crate, and you can tell me the rest of your tale of woe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jasmine: It's really good to see you, Jen. Live a little. Call me, okay? I'll see you soon.",
        "Barbara: See you. Well, she never changes, does she? Did you have a nice chat?",
        "Jennifer: Did you guilt her into coming, Mom?",
        "Barbara: Of course not.",
        "Jennifer: Or bribe her with the Street Jeans show.",
        "Barbara: She hardly needs the work.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, stop it, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Sweetheart --",
        "Jennifer: Don't.",
        "Barbara: What is wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Don't smother me with food or advice or old friends who are barely that, okay? You cannot fix this or snap your fingers or make me whole, so damn it, stop trying!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What's this?",
        "Hal: It's called \"food.\"",
        "Emily: Hal, you can't bribe with me food to get me to unload to you, as much as I would love to scream.",
        "Hal: Well, go ahead, let loose. Disturb the peace. Maybe they'll call a cop.",
        "Emily: Now you decide to take my side?",
        "Hal: I learned the hard way.",
        "Emily: Nothing's changed. Paul cares about me very much. He's just so angry at Craig.",
        "Hal: Well, the last I heard, Craig was in jail.",
        "Emily: Well, apparently, that's not good enough.",
        "Hal: Why not? Is Paul going after Craig? What's he planning? Has he talked you into being part of something, dressed it up to be some noble cause?",
        "Emily: Stop it. Okay? Just stop it right now. You cannot ride to my rescue every time I turn around.",
        "Hal: Sorry, old habit.",
        "Emily: Well, I can handle it, okay? I'm fine.",
        "Hal: Look, Montgomery deserves to rot. I'm not saying he doesn't. But when Paul gets like this, he can go to a dark place. You saw it with Rose.",
        "Emily: I've got to go.",
        "Hal: Emily, if Paul ever hurts you again and I find out about it, that's the day I turn in my badge, and I rip him limb from limb.",
        "Paul: Well, thanks for the warning.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: Why did you get mixed up in this case?",
        "Gwen: It looks like you're not the only one with high-powered friends.",
        "Paul: Let's not make a federal case out of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mind if I join the party?",
        "Hal: It's not my party.",
        "Paul: Is it okay?",
        "Emily: Sure.",
        "Paul: Are you okay? Emily yeah.",
        "Hal: Why wouldn't she be?",
        "Paul: I'm not talking to you, Hal.",
        "Emily: How'd you know I was here?",
        "Paul: Barbara. Hal didn't tell you?",
        "Hal: I called her.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Hal: To find out why you going to see Jen caused a holy war. You've got a problem with that, Paul?",
        "Paul: I don't have a problem.",
        "Hal: Well, somebody better connect the dots.",
        "Paul: Jennifer was upset. And sometimes, seeing people, even people who are trying to help, just makes things worse. It was just a bad situation.",
        "Hal: Oh, so that's it? Well, it's a very weak case.",

        "Emily: The worst part has just begun. We are that baby's Godparents. And we have to live with this lie, and not just your sister -- Jack and Carly.

They're gonna fall in love with that little boy, their brother, on every level and every way, and when somebody comes in and takes them away from him --",

        "Ms. Todd: Your honor, we have a notarized document naming Mrs. Snyder as said minor's legal guardian in the event of Rosanna Cabot Montgomery's death or any impairment preventing her or mr. Montgomery from raising the child. As you know, Detective Snyder is a decorated member of the Oakdale Police Department. He and Mrs. Snyder are parents to three other children. They'll provide an excellent home to the child in keeping with Mrs. Montgomery's request. Now we ask the court to also keep in mind that Miss Norbeck entrusted her child to the care and better judgment of Rosanna Cabot Montgomery. That same better judgment chose Carly Snyder to be his legal guardian, so in effect, ms. Norbeck herself has chosen the Snyders to care for the child.",
        "Gwen: I never picked her.",
        "Cass: Sit down, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: But that's a lie.",
        "Cass: Sit down. Your honor, we're all saddened by Rosanna Cabot Montgomery's tragedy, but the law isn't guided by emotion. It's guided by fact and precedent. And the facts are Gwen Norbeck is given 30 days by law to determine her child's placement. She has reconsidered her decision, particularly in light of Mrs. Montgomery's condition and her husband's subsequent incarceration. The law is very clear. Gwen Norbeck has the right to keep her baby. We respectfully ask the court to uphold that right and to order the Snyders to hand over the child without any delay.",
        "Ms. Todd: We take exception to the request, your honor.",
        "Judge: On what grounds?",
        "Ms. Todd: On the grounds the birth father is not represented in this court. We challenge his consent to this decision.",
        "Cass: The birth father has relinquished all rights to this child.",
        "Judge: I see no affidavit to that effect, Mr. Winthrop.",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Cass: Not now. Your honor, there's a verbal understanding between the two parties.",
        "Ms. Todd: Yet you ask us to a ignore a legal and binding document between Mrs. Snyder and Rosanna Cabot Montgomery?",
        "Gwen: He doesn't care about the child.",
        "Ms. Todd: Wait, so he doesn't know? Your honor, this is in direct violation of father's rights, and Ms. Norbeck has lost all credibility in this court.",
        "Cass: Oh, come off it. It's a stall, your honor.",
        "Judge: If your client wants to claim custody of her child, she will name his birth father immediately, Mr. Winthrop, or this hearing is over.",
