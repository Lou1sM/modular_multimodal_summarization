        "Carly: You're welcome to come to the\r\ndrive-in with us if you want to, but I should warn you -- I have a suspicion it\r\nmay not be your style. ",
        "Simon: Listen, as long as it takes my mind\r\noff of Katie doing the Kama Sutra, it's all good. ",
        "Carly: But we're not bitter. ",
        "Simon: Us? Bitter? No way,\r\nnot us. So the drive-in it is -- ",
        "Parker: I call front seat! ",
        "J.J.: No fair! ",
        "Carly: Boys -- ",
        "Parker: I got dressed first! ",
        "J.J.: But I had to help Sage! ",
        "Simon: All right, wait, I'm a little\r\nconfused. Does the drive-in involve staying in or going out? ",
        "Carly: Oh, going out. ",
        "Simon: But -- ",
        "Carly: Oh, well, wearing pajamas is a\r\nnecessary part of the experience. ",
        "Simon: Ah. Well, you see, I forgot mine. Do\r\nyou have a spare pair I could borrow, at all? ",
        "Carly: Simon's going to come to the movies\r\nwith us. ",
        "Parker: Does he have to? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Hey, hero. ",
        "Dusty: How're your lungs? Okay? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, the lungs are fine. Thank you\r\nfor asking. How're you doing? ",
        "Dusty: Fine. ",
        "Lucy: Well, the bourbon says you're a liar.\r\nYou were almost killed. ",
        "Dusty: No, I got caught down in a basement\r\nwith a pretty girl. That's it. Don't let me keep you. You\r\nmeeting someone? ",
        "Lucy: Actually, I was looking for you. ",
        "",
        "Barbara: Hon. Gwen. I am so sorry. I\r\nwould've been here if I'd known anything -- ",
        "Gwen: Known what? ",
        "Barbara: That you were attacked. Oh, look at\r\nyour throat. Oh, my God, Honey, you could have been killed. You must've been\r\nterrified. But I heard that Will saved you. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he was -- he chased -- whoever\r\n-- away. ",
        "Barbara: And your arm -- ",
        "Gwen: Ah, no. It's just a scratch. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, Sweetie. You must have been so\r\nscared. ",
        "Gwen: It wasn't fun. ",
        "Barbara: No, I'm sure it wasn\u2019t. But Will saved\r\nyou, because he loves you. So, where is my hero son? Is he here? ",
        "Gwen: Uh, no. ",
        "Barbara: Well, where is he? Surely you've\r\npatched things up by now? ",
        "Gwen: No. In fact, I left him. ",
        "",
        "Jade: Hey, where are you going? ",
        "Will: Jade -- ",
        "Jade: Relax. You're a free man. You can do\r\nanything you want. ",
        "Will: You're right. And I don't want to do\r\nthis. ",
        "",
        "Margo: I thought we had corroborating\r\nevidence -- ",
        "Dallas: No, I mean, it was just the fraternity planned the\r\nparty, it's not like it actually happened. The university got wind of some\r\nliquor delivery -- ",
        "Margo: Well, why didn't the fraternity just\r\nmove the party someplace else? So what if the university found out about it? \r\n",
        "Dallas: No. They wouldn't have put their chapter in\r\njeopardy. ",
        "Margo: All right, so -- Maddie\u2019s story about\r\nbeing raped at the fraternity? ",
        "Dallas: Didn't happen. At least not\r\nthere. ",
        "Margo: So if the frat party didn't happen --\r\nshe lied about that -- did she lie about being raped? ",
        "Dallas: Margo, I saw Maddie at the hospital that night,\r\nokay? Something happened. Now, she -- she was bruised, which was clearly\r\nvisible. Her hair was in shambles. She wouldn't even let the doctors touch her.\r\nSo I go in, and I try to get a statement from her. She won't tell me anything.\r\nThen she runs away. ",
        "Margo: This is great. We've got no rape kit.\r\nWe've got no witnesses. We've got only Maddie\u2019s version of the story, which she\r\njust recently revealed. She had a lot of time to come up with that. ",
        "Dallas: Listen, something happened that night. ",
        "Margo: Yeah -- but what? ",
        "",
        "Maddie: What are you doing? ",
        "Louis: There's a killer out there. I want to\r\nkeep you safe. ",
        "Maddie: I want you to go. ",
        "Louis: But this is my room, Maddie. And\r\nyou're always welcome here. Just as you were welcome in my\r\nhome. I want us to be close. The way we were in Chicago. ",
        "Maddie: That'll never happen. ",
        "Louis: Where do you think you're going? ",
        "Maddie: To find my sister. ",
        "Louis: The police told us to keep a close\r\neye on you, Maddie. Eve wants you to stay here with me. ",
        "Maddie: And if she knew the truth? ",
        "Louis: Everybody knows how much I care about\r\nyou, Maddie. And that you care about me. ",
        "Maddie: No, I don't care about you. I hate\r\nyou. ",
        "Louis: No, you've missed me. ",
        "Maddie: No. ",
        "Louis: Admit it. ",
        "Maddie: No! ",
        "Louis: Yes. Ever since I've arrived you\r\nhaven't stopped thinking about me -- ",
        "Maddie: I don't want you anywhere near me! ",
        "Louis: No, no. You say that, but you don't\r\nmean it. ",
        "Maddie: Just get away from me. ",
        "Louis: Why are you acting like this? ",
        "Maddie: No, don't touch me! Because you raped me. You raped me. \r\n",
        "Louis: That's not true. ",
        "Maddie: What would you call it? ",
        "Louis: I know that some would say it was\r\nwrong. That I'm a married man -- ",
        "Maddie: To my sister. ",
        "Louis: And still, you came on to me. ",
        "Maddie: What? ",
        "Louis: You played the innocent. But you knew\r\nwhat you were doing. ",
        "Maddie: I didn't do anything! ",
        "Louis: Always seeking me out, asking my\r\nadvice, excluding Eve, making sure we had time alone, wearing\r\nthose skimpy little tops and short skirts. ",
        "Maddie: I didn't mean to -- I don't -- ",
        "Louis: It was hard to resist. For both of us. But what we shared -- when we could finally\r\nadmit it, when we finally could just give in to what we both wanted -- ",
        "Maddie: I didn't want you touching me like\r\nthat. ",
        "Louis: You were inexperienced. I had to show\r\nyou. ",
        "Maddie: You hurt me. I said no. ",
        "Louis: Maddie likes to play pretend. ",
        "Maddie: You forced me -- I -- I tried to\r\nstop you. I hit you! You raped me, Louis! ",
        "Louis: Shut up! I don't want to hear that\r\nkind of language from you ever again. I certainly hope you haven't talked that\r\nway to anybody else. ",
        "Maddie: You mean, have I told on you? I\r\ncouldn't even admit it to myself up until a few weeks ago. I just -- I wanted\r\nit to go away. I wanted to pretend that it never happened. But no matter what I\r\ndid, it just kept coming back, and I would remember. ",
        "Louis: But don't you see, Maddie-Pie, I feel\r\nthe same way. I can't forget you. Your skin. The way\r\nyou smell \u2013 ",

        "Margo: Something has triggered this bizarre\r\nbehavior. Look at her relationship with my son, her reaction to you -- Lia's\r\ncar. ",
        "Dallas: She's clearly acting out. ",
        "Margo: She's been traumatized. What? ",
        "Dallas: I'm just -- all right, devil's advocate. Is it\r\npossible -- I mean, Maddie is an extremely imaginative\r\ngirl --? ",
        "Margo: No, no, no. She believes that she was\r\nraped. I believe that she was raped. ",
        "Dallas: Margo, but is it possible? Now, I'm no shrink, but\r\nI've seen these cases. This one time in Chicago? Now, there was this woman, completely believed that\r\nher husband was kidnapped. We've ran an APB, we even dug underneath a\r\nplayground. Turns out she's not even married. ",
        "Margo: So you think that Maddie has lost\r\ntouch with reality? ",
        "Dallas: Margo, you saw what she did to Lia\u2019s car. You saw\r\nwhat happened when we pulled her from the pond. [Margo sighs] That distant look in her eye? You couldn't even talk to her.\r\n",
        "Margo: Okay, all right. I will give you that\r\nmaybe she's entered a fantasy land, but it stems from something real. ",
        "Dallas: I'm just worried about what's she going to do next.\r\n",

        "Lucy: Well, I'm very old school, as you know.\r\nSo you're just going to have to suffer through my efforts to make it up to you.\r\n",
        "Dusty: It's all right. Don't worry. You\r\nknow, right place, right time. That's what it was. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Lucky for me. ",
        "Dusty: You got to be kidding me. I'm not\r\ntaking that. ",
        "Lucy: Don't you at least want to know what\r\nyou're turning down? ",

        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, I'll take care of Johnny,\r\nand you can take one of your friends to the game. ",

        "Parker: I thought it was just us. ",
        "Carly: Parker, you're being rude. ",
        "Simon: No, no, no. He's just being honest,\r\nthat's all. Aren't you, Mate? And the truth is, since you asked, no, I don't\r\nhave to come, but I was just curious. That's all, see. See, I was wondering,\r\n'cause I'm not from around here -- what exactly was it we're driving into? I\r\nmean, if you and I could take turns at the wheel, that's all, because I once\r\ndrove into a house, and that was fun, but I always wanted to drive into a pool.\r\n",
        "Parker: You don't drive in to a pool. You\r\ndrive in to the movies. ",
        "Simon: Right through the screen? They allow\r\nthat? Wow, what a fabulous country. ",
        "Parker: No, you drive into a parking lot and\r\nyou watch a movie on the big screen. ",
        "Simon: Oh. All right, what if it rains? ",
        "Parker: You don't go when it rains. ",

        "Carly: Hey. You know something boys, we don't have to go at all. Mmm,\r\nthat's what I thought. Now march outside, get in the car, and all three of you,\r\nget in the back seat -- and not a word. ",
        "Simon: Whoa. You remind me of my mom. ",
        "Carly: Yeah, not exactly what I'm going for.\r\n",
        "Simon: No, no. Tough -- tough, but fair. I\r\nlike that. ",

She\r\nwants to find some guy with money, and take him for every penny he's worth, and\r\nwe're not going to let that happen. ",
