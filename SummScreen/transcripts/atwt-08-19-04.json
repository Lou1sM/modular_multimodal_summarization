        "Margo: You know what? If you are here to apologize about what happened at the Country Club with Casey --",
        "Doc: Listen, I'm sorry your son found out about us. But that's not why I'm here.",
        "Margo: I don't want to hear from you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to talk to you. I thought I made myself clear.",
        "Doc: Abundantly. But there's something you need to know.",
        "Margo: I don't think there's anything more you could possibly say to me, Doc.",
        "Doc: Listen Margo, I know you're mad at the world.",
        "Margo: Whoa, yeah, you think?",
        "Doc: You are not the only one in pain here. Not everything is about you.",
        "Margo: You think I'm supposed to feel bad that you lost your job when I'm going through this?",
        "Doc: It's about Jessica. She had a miscarriage. She lost her baby.",

        "Curtis: Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Curtis: Hey, Dad told me what happened. I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, honey.",
        "Curtis: I won't pretend I know what you're going through, but if you need anything, big, small -- whatever. I make a mean cup of tea.",
        "Jessica: Maybe later. I'll let you know.",
        "Curtis: Well --",

        "Rosanna: No, I don't want any food. I just want to understand.",
        "Carly: Oh, honey. When it comes to James Stenbeck, I don't think there's any way to understand him.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm talking about Paul.",
        "Carly: What is there to understand?",
        "Rosanna: I told him, I -- begged him to -- I told him to save Cabot.",
        "Carly: It must have been an awful decision for him. But we're talking about an impossible situation here. He was damned if he saved the baby, he was damned if he didn't. Either way, we'd be sitting here mourning a hideous loss.",
        "Rosanna: Cabot was innocent.",
        "Carly: Yes, he was. And helpless. And beautiful. And he had his whole life ahead of him. But you can't blame Paul for the fact that he's gone, and you're still here. You must blame who is responsible -- James Stenbeck.",

        "Rosanna: I'm not -- I'm not here.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, I'll get it. Jordan.",
        "Jordan: Hi. Carly, I was hoping I could see Rosanna?",
        "Carly: Just a moment, please? Rosanna, that man standing outside that door loved Cabot just as much as you did. Don't you think you should be sharing this? I know. Jordan knows. And that's why we need each other -- now, more than ever.",

        "Molly: You're really clear about your needs. But what about Holden's? Have you even slowed down enough to consider his?",
        "Lily: Hey. What you doing, sleepy?",
        "Faith: Is Daddy home yet?",
        "Lily: Is Daddy home yet? Did you hear somebody humming in the kitchen? Did you hear somebody ask for his little tickle monster? He's not home yet. But I have a feeling he'll be home soon. Why?",

        "Carly: I'll be here for you. Jordan lost a son, too. Just let him stay. You don't have to talk to him if you don't want to. Just let him sit by you.",

        "Casey: Yeah, I think I could definitely get used to hanging with you at the Lakeview.",
        "Tom: Oh, yeah?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Room service, maid service, cable TV, swimming pool.",
        "Tom: Ah, yes. But, see, you don't belong in a hotel. You belong at home.",
        "Casey: What's so great about that?",
        "Tom: Well, all the important stuff's there. Computer, your books, your music, a place to study when school starts up. Your mom.",
        "Casey: I guess.",
        "Tom: Hey, look. I'm not going anywhere. You can come here any time you want.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Tom: So, what did you think about the talk we had with your mom last night?",
        "Casey: Well, I guess I understand things better now.",
        "Tom: All right, good.",
        "Casey: I'm still really, really mad at her for doing whatever she did with Doc.",
        "Tom: And that's okay.",
        "Casey: But I don't hate her, I guess.",
        "Tom: Well, you can hate what she did, but you can't hate who she is. You remember that. And you'll be taking a large step into putting things right if you move back home.",
        "Casey: You think?",
        "Tom: I think it would make your mom happy. And it's been a long time since she's been happy.",

        "Tom: Yeah? All right, smart move.",
        "Casey: This does not mean I'm letting you off the hook, though. We still have our whole dinner thing, and the movie deal, and I can come crash in your suite, swim in the pool.",
        "Tom: Whenever you want.",
        "Casey: What about you?",
        "Tom: What about me?",
        "Casey: Well, Mom did say she was sorry about everything, and I believe her.",
        "Tom: So do I.",
        "Casey: So, you always said that when someone's really sorry about something, that you should forgive them.",
        "Tom: I did say that, didn't I?",
        "Casey: So, do you forgive Mom?",

        "Molly: No, I just -- I just felt so close to you, and I guess I just -- I just thought that --",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I felt the same way about you.",
        "Molly: I am so mortified. I am so sorry.",
        "Holden: Don't be. It's not like you planned it.",
        "Molly: It's just -- I mean, you've been so good to me. And you never blame me for anything, or touched me.",
        "Holden: Well, we've been good for each other. I'm glad that you've been in my corner.",

        "Carly: Hey, whatever the problem is --",
        "Molly: I just wanted to let you know that you're right. You're right, I am selfish. I am thoughtless. If I'm not hurting people, I'm using them to fill a void, to make me happy. But the only thing is, is that I'll never be happy.",
        "Carly: Come on, slow down. Tell me what's going on.",
        "Molly: You'd think I would have learned my lesson. But I just keep hurting people, and ruining their lives.",
        "Carly: Molly, what brought this on?",
        "Molly: I finally got it, you know. A moment of clarity, when I realized that I'm being self-destructive. And it's one thing to hurt myself, but when these innocent people start paying the price for my selfishness, well, then, it's just time to --",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Molly: I'm talking about that I took away the one thing that you loved most in the world! He is gone! Jack is gone because of me! I did this to you! I let this happen, and I wish to God I could take it back. I wish to God every day, Carly --",
        "Carly: You can't! You cannot take it back! Get that through your head! What's done is done! That's it! Now, would you stop it? Just stop!",

        "Casey: Mom! Yo, Mom! I guess she's gone.",
        "Tom: Either that, or completely deaf.",
        "Casey: So, are you going to stick around till she gets back, or are you gonna split?",

        "Walker: Hey, that was fast.",
        "Ben: Got the lab reports?",
        "Walker: Given the entire situation, I think I have positive news.",
        "Ben: Let's hear it.",
        "Walker: There is nothing to suggest any genetic defects that might affect any subsequent pregnancies.",
        "Ben: Well, good. We'll try again.",
        "Walker: Absolutely. I don't see why not. Listen, Ben, miscarriages -- they're unfortunate, but not uncommon. It's no one's fault. It's not hers, it's not yours. It's just chance.",
        "Ben: Can I take a look at the report?",
        "Walker: I don't really see any reason to do that.",
        "Ben: The sex of the baby is in the report, isn't it?",
        "Walker: It is.",
        "Ben: Was it a boy?",
        "Walker: If you need anything else, you know where to find me.",
        "Ben: Wait a minute. Hold on a second.",
        "Walker: What is there a problem?",
        "Ben: Yeah, a big one. These can't be the lab results for my baby. Somebody made a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Jack Snyder was the best, most honorable man. And Cabot was the best child. Why? I don't understand. Why? How could you take them from us? I don't understand.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Ben: Can you get a file for me?",

        "Jordan: I wish I had the answers to your questions. I wish I could tell you why all this happened.",
        "Rosanna: The other times Cabot was taken, there was always some hope, always something we could do.",
        "Jordan: He was this precious little gift that I never knew that I wanted, just dropped in my life.",
        "Rosanna: And now you blame yourself. And me.",
        "Jordan: No, I didn't say that.",
        "Rosanna: No, you didn't have to. Just constantly goes around and around in your mind. \"If only we hadn't listened to Paul. If only we'd done what James said, we wouldn't be here now.\"",
        "Jordan: Cabot would be alive.",
        "Rosanna: We were wrong. We were wrong about everything.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What can I do? Tell me what I can do. Is there anything that you need?",
        "Jessica: I am so glad you came by. You don't know how much that means to me.",
        "Margo: Well, we're friends. Right? But you really want me to leave right now, don't you?",
        "Jessica: I could just use a little alone time, I think.",
        "Margo: That's understandable. But, you know, if you need anything, if you think of anything, if you need, you know, some companionship or just a shoulder to -- look at those tears. Go ahead an cry, honey. I'm not afraid of your tears. You go ahead.",
        "Jessica: I'm okay. I'll be okay. I was just thinking -- you know how they say every prayer is answered, but not always in the way you expect? Well, every night I prayed that this baby was Ben's. That it would have its father's eyes and big heart. I prayed that everything about Doc would just go away. Every touch, every memory. I wanted to erase it all. I wanted it all gone. And I guess my prayers were answered, because my baby was taken away.",
        "Margo: No, no. Don't you even think that way.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm being punished. I'm being punished for what I did to Ben, for what I did to you.",
        "Margo: No one's punishing you. I forgive you, I do.",

        "Ben: The lab made a mistake, again.",
        "Walker: Where?",
        "Ben: Right there. The baby's blood type, it's wrong. They must have mixed it up with another fetus.",
        "Walker: They run a tight ship down there, but --",
        "Ben: But nobody's perfect. Yeah, right, right. I'll straighten it out.",
        "Walker: It shouldn't be too hard. There's only been one autopsy performed on a fetus in the last 24 hours, and that's that one.",
        "Ben: It's not right, though.",
        "Walker: You know what, why don't you straighten this out tomorrow, or next week. Just go home. Be with your wife. All right?",
        "Ben: Yeah. Yeah, I should.",
        "Walker: You'll get it straightened out. And, you know, once again, my sympathies.",

        "Holden: Yeah, but it's not like you were on vacation.",
        "Lily: I know that, but --",
        "Holden: I mean, you had a lot to deal with. You almost got yourself killed. But you were there for Sierra. She needed you.",
        "Lily: She hates me. Sierra hates me.",

        "Holden: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Lily: But I think about you being there for me when Rose died, and I have not been here.",
        "Holden: I did not do such a great job of that. I should have given you more time. I should have given you more space.",
        "Lily: No, you were incredible. No matter what I said or what I did, you were there for me.",
        "Holden: Lily, please don't make me out to be some paragon of virtue.",
        "Lily: You are. And I'm not just saying that because I love you.",

        "Casey: Dad. He kind of made me see it was the right thing to do.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack was alone with Starziak in that car because he --",
        "Molly: Because I begged him to. Because am selfish and I was scared --",
        "Carly: No, Molly. He did it because he thought it was the right thing to do. He did it because Starziak was dangerous and he wanted him out of this house just as much as you did.",
        "Molly: If I could have just, you know, calmed down just a little bit, none of this --",
        "Carly: Molly, no one ever made Jack Snyder do anything he didn't want to do. He didn't take Starziak in alone because you told him to. He did it because he wanted to.",
        "Molly: God, but if I could have just stayed in control and listened to you --",
        "Carly: You'd just been attacked! Starziak tried to kill you, there was a dead cop on the floor.",
        "Molly: I know, but you said --",
        "Carly: I said a lot of things. I'm not like Jack. I say the wrong things. I lash out at the wrong people. I blamed you for Jack's death because I needed somebody to blame. I needed somebody to hate, because I hate the fact that he's gone. I hate that he's left me. And I don't want to do anything without him.",
        "Molly: Oh, God, I'm so sorry Carly. I'm so sorry.",
        "Carly: I miss him so much \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I don't know how it happened. She was upset, I was upset. We were trying to comfort each other, I guess. I don't know.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. It never should have happened, and I'm not gonna make excuses --",
        "Lily: Would you make an excuse? Please, I really like -- I would to hear an excuse.",
        "Holden: I screwed up. I know that. But I couldn't let you just stand here and let you paint me out to be some saint when I behaved like I did.",
        "Lily: Molly McKinnon? Why? Why did you do this? Why did you let that happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Carly: You can come to the memorial service.",
        "Molly: Are you sure?",
        "Carly: Jack would want you there. I want you there. Truth be told, I cannot imagine getting through this without you by my side.",
        "Molly: So we're friends again?",
        "Carly: We'll remain friends always.",
        "Molly: Oh, God. You don't know how badly I needed to hear that.",
        "Carly: You know, I can't let you go that easily. Gotta keep my eye on you. You know all my secrets. Jack wouldn't want us to fight. You know, he'd want us to find a way to stay a family.",
        "Molly: The original family man.",
        "Carly: So I guess something good came out of whatever made you come over here today. We've got each other back.",
        "Molly: Thank God. As for the rest of it -- I think I know how I'm gonna handle it.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Molly: By doing the opposite of what I would normally do. I'm going to do nothing. Nothing at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know I love you.",
        "Lily: I know. That's why I know something like this wouldn't have happened unless there were some feelings involved.",
        "Holden: I don't love Molly.",
        "Lily: How does she feel about you?",
        "Holden: It was a weak moment. For both of us. Nothing more. You're the only woman I love.",
        "Lily: But you must have felt something --",
        "Holden: It'll never happen again.",
        "Lily: It makes sense. In some twisted way, it makes sense.",
        "Holden: I wish somebody would explain it to me.",
        "Lily: Because we haven't been spending time together and you lost someone so important to you, someone so special. Your cousin -- your best friend. And I wasn't there for you.",
        "Holden: She felt guilty. She felt like Jack's death was her fault. And I was only trying to --",
        "Lily: You guys have a history. You have a child together. You share a lot together, so it's only natural that you would be drawn to each other.",
        "Holden: Lily, don't excuse this.",
        "Lily: You said it meant nothing.",
        "Holden: Less than nothing.",
        "Lily: I will not lose you over one kiss. Even if it is with Molly.",
        "Holden: After today, after Jack's service is over, I think that maybe we should take some time together. Maybe go away, just the both of us.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I'd like that.",
        "Holden: Me too.",
        "Lily: And we can talk later. You gotta get ready for the service, so why don't you go?",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're right. Are you sure?",
        "Lily: Yes. We'll work it out. We always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Where's the harm in talking about how you feel?",
        "Rosanna: It won't do any good.",
        "Jordan: You don't know that.",
        "Rosanna: You don't want to know how I feel.",
        "Jordan: Try me.",
        "Rosanna: I hate. I despise. I loathe.",
        "Jordan: I'm still here. Go on.",
        "Rosanna: I hate James for killing my son. I hate Paul for coming up with that stupid plan. I hate you for going along with it. I hate myself. I failed my son. I failed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Honey, I want to thank you, I really want to thank you for convincing Casey to come home.",
        "Tom: Didn't take much.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm grateful. Whatever you said, I'm grateful.",
        "Tom: It's what's best for Casey.",
        "Margo: Yeah. You know, I just don't remember when things have ever been quite like this. It's just -- you know, with Katie gone, and Craig's family going through hell. And losing Jack and poor little Cabot. Honey, I don't think I can bear losing my family, too.",
        "Tom: Yeah, we have lost a lot, haven't we?",
        "Margo: I was wondering if maybe, you know, when you were talking to Casey about moving home that maybe you saw that it was a good idea that you move back, too.",
        "Tom: Hey, come on.",
        "Margo: I'm not trying to push things.",
        "Tom: All right, all right.",
        "Margo: I just was kinda hoping that you'd see what our friends are going through and everything they've lost and that maybe you could see things through a new light.",
        "Tom: I have given our situation some thought.",
        "Margo: Yeah? What's this?",
        "Tom: Those are papers for you to sign. For our legal separation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I made sure you were alone before I knocked. But if you want me to go away, you just say the word, I'm gone.",
        "Jessica: No, it's okay.",
        "Doc: You sure?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Come on in.",
        "Doc: I see you got the flowers that I sent you. Guess I should have stopped at that, but I just had to come by and see how you're feeling. And to tell you once again just how sorry I am.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, Doc. Thank you.",
        "Doc: I know you think I'm heartless guy that I don't care. But I do. You don't have no earthly reason to believe that, but I really do --",
        "Jessica: I do believe you. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: The file you wanted, Dr. Harris?",
        "Ben: Thanks, Jenny. This is what I thought. Jessica's a-positive, I'm o-positive. No way we could have a baby that's AB-negative. Unless -- it wasn't my baby?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jordan: She's the one that helped James escape. She helped him murder our child.",
        "Ben: Tell you the truth, I'm not the least bit surprised to catch you here with my wife.",
        "Mike: The reality is, Jack's gone.",
