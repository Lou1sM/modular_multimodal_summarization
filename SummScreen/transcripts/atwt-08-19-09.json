        "Jay: Look, it's not like I'm asking for state secrets. I'm just asking if you've seen Audrey Coleman around here. We, um -- we seem to keep missing each other.",
        "Audrey: Oh, no. Oh -- no. No.",
        "Vienna: What are you doing?",
        "Henry: Is there an evil glint in my eye, like I want to take over the world?",
        "Vienna: What on earth are you talking about?",
        "Henry: Is there anything in my face that reminds you of Paul Ryan or James Stenbeck?",
        "Vienna: No, of course not.",
        "Henry: No, of course not! Means my mother is crazy. There is absolutely no way that James Stenbeck could be my father, and that's just the end of it.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but why would she invent something like this?",
        "Henry: Why does my mother do anything? To try to get something out of it. The question is, what?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Audrey: Henry, Vienna! Are you -- are you in there?",
        "Vienna: Audrey?",
        "Henry: What do you want, Mother?",
        "Audrey: Let me in. Hurry up, hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry!",
        "Henry: What's going on?",
        "Audrey: Close the door. Close the door. Close the door. You have to hide me.",
        "Vienna: From who?",
        "Audrey: Uh, I can't tell you that.",
        "Henry: No! Either this time, you tell me what's going on, or you're on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I still don't know how you got me off with a suspended sentence.",
        "Bonnie: Well, the simple answer is, uh, I'm just that good.",
        "Dusty: And modest, too.",
        "Bonnie: I just call it how I see it. Though, in the interest of full disclosure, you were pretty lucky. I mean, Paul Ryan's testimony was a big part of that luck. So, Dusty Donovan, now that you're a free man, what is next?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm not gonna waste my freedom. That's for sure.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to my office. Lucinda Walsh has been in charge of my company for way too long. See you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: No matter how many times he dies, your father never gets any less infuriating or dangerous.",
        "Paul: Mom, what's he gonna do? Roll over a couple of bottles of vintage wine?",
        "Barbara: He's here for a reason, Paul.",
        "Paul: Did he happen to tell you what that reason was?",
        "Barbara: He didn't have to. All he wants to do is torture me. He said that I would find out eventually.",
        "Paul: I don't think James is gonna be able to implement any major plans from the basement. Can't even manage to roll himself up a flight of stairs.",
        "Barbara: How long do you plan on keeping him down there?",
        "Paul: Until he dies.",
        "Emily: Until who dies?",
        "Paul: James.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Oh -- oh, Honey pie, you don't mean that. You don't mean that.",
        "Henry: I'm not your honey, and yes, I do.",
        "Vienna: You can't throw her out if she's in danger.",
        "Henry: If she's in danger, then keeping her here puts us in danger, too, and I'm not gonna do that without an explanation.",
        "Audrey: Okay, okay. I'll tell you everything.",
        "Henry: Well?",
        "Audrey: Oh. You mean right now?",
        "Henry: Yeah, right now. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Audrey: Oh. Okay, okay, okay, okay. He's here.",
        "Henry: Who's here?",
        "Audrey: Jay! Jay Stanhope is here. He's downstairs, and he's looking for me.",
        "Henry: Okay. So you're telling me that the man that you introduced to me as your friend, Jay Stanhope, that you're terrified because he's downstairs right now?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, yeah. Uh, I -- I can explain that.",
        "Henry: Can you explain how his name is Raymond Zuma?",
        "Audrey: How do you know that?",
        "Henry: I'm the one asking the questions here, okay? Who is Raymond Zuma, and what is he to you and Jay Stanhope?",
        "Audrey: Oh, okay, fine. I guess you need to know the truth, then.",
        "Henry: I think I already know the truth. You and Zuma are in this together, aren't you?",
        "Audrey: In what together?",
        "Henry: I knew this all along, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Okay, okay. Maybe you should just hear her out.",
        "Henry: What do you mean, hear her out? What is there to hear? Hear her confess that she and Zuma are gonna put Stanhope into a pine box? Sweetie, do you want to be an accessory here?",
        "Audrey: Would you -- would you stop trying to run me up the river on a murder rap? I am the potential victim here.",
        "Henry: What?! What are you talking about?!",
        "Audrey: I'm talking about Zuma! He's the one trying to kill me, not the other way around!",
        "Henry: Oh, okay, okay. I need an explanation now.",
        "Audrey: I owe him money.",
        "Henry: How much?",
        "Audrey: Um -- 50 grand.",
        "Henry: Oh! Oh! 50 grand?! How could you get in the hole for 50 -- you're the one that taught me how to spot a marked deck!",
        "Audrey: I know, I know! Henry, this time, it's not cards. It's a -- a real estate deal.",
        "Henry: By deal you mean scheme, and by scheme, I mean scam.",
        "Audrey: Scheme, scam, who cares what -- what the words are? The fact is, is it went belly up. My partner takes the money and runs and leaves me holding the bag. So I just -- I sort of went to Ray and, you know, batted my eyes and tried to get a little time to get the money together.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where are we gonna get this 50 grand from, from the tooth fairy, Mom?",
        "Audrey: From your father. I thought that if I could get the two of you together, he would be so happy and so grateful --",
        "Henry: That he would shower me with money, and some of it would splash onto you.",
        "Audrey: Yeah. I know that he wants that. He wants that very much.",
        "Henry: Really, you know that? You know that, do you?",
        "Audrey: Well, maybe not in so many words, but I know it as a mother.",
        "Henry: Does a mother know how to use -- use a Ouija board? Because that's the only way you're gonna communicate with the late James Stenbeck.",
        "Audrey: Oh, boy! How many times do I have to tell you, son? Stenbeck is alive!",
        "Henry: Proof, Mother. Proof. I need proof. I need proof.",
        "Audrey: I did! I -- I gave you the letter. I gave you that letter that he wrote.",
        "Henry: The letter? The letter that said, \"I heard you've been looking for me,\" unsigned?",
        "Audrey: It was obvious who wrote it.",
        "Henry: Anybody could have written that. You could have written that letter.",
        "Audrey: Oh, so now I'm writing the letters to myself. Do I seem crazy to you?",
        "Henry: Do you really want me to answer that?",
        "Audrey: Would it kill you -- son, would it kill you just to have a teeny, weenie, tiny little bit of faith in me?",
        "Henry: If you are asking me to go chasing after James Stenbeck, who may or may not be alive, and who may or may not be my father, then yes, you're damn right it could kill me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Whoa, whoa. You've been talking about James Stenbeck?",
        "Barbara: Of course not.",
        "Paul: Is there another James?",
        "Emily: Okay, if you're making snide remarks about your not-so-dearly departed father, you really are back to being the old Paul.",
        "Barbara: Would you tell her to leave, please?",
        "Paul: Hey, don't be like that. Emily's here because she's finally come to her senses, and she's gonna give me back my money.",
        "Emily: Actually, the money is exactly what I'm here about.",
        "Barbara: Good. No conversation necessary. Give him the check and then leave.",
        "Emily: Okay, I get that having your memory back means you're being yourself again.",
        "Paul: Okay. Hurry this along, please.",
        "Emily: Okay. I just wanted to let you know that two can play at your game. So if you're gonna be the same spiteful son of a --",
        "Paul: Careful.",
        "Emily: -- Person that you are, then so can I. I am back. The old Emily is back and in fighting form.",
        "Barbara: As if she ever left.",
        "Paul: What's your point?",
        "Emily: I hired a lawyer.",
        "Paul: Why would you hire a lawyer?",
        "Emily: To make sure you don't get one red cent of the money you gave me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Um, look, I -- I knew I had to come up with some hard cash and fast, so that's when I thought of James. I figured, you know, maybe if he knew we had a child together, he might open up those good, big, fat money bags.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Mom, because that's every man's dream -- to find out that he has a grown son that he knew nothing about.",
        "Vienna: No. Any man would be proud to have you as a son.",
        "Audrey: Yes, you bet he would. But then when I found out James had died, I thought, \"Oh, boy, Audrey, you're out of luck again.\" But then I got the letter.",
        "Henry: Mom -- Mom, do you realize how crazy this all sounds?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, I do. But you gotta believe me. You have got to believe me. You are gonna benefit far more than I ever will in the end of all of this. You will.",
        "Henry: You don't understand, okay? You just don't get this. Even if James Stenbeck is alive, I don't want anything to do with him!",
        "Audrey: Oh, no! Shh, shh! Don't -- don't say that. Please don't say that.",
        "Henry: The man tried to kill me, and then he held me prisoner in a wine cellar at Fairwinds.",
        "Audrey: In -- in a wine cellar? Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Audrey: That -- that is terrible.",
        "Henry: Terrible?! It was one of the worst experiences of my life!",
        "Audrey: So he owes you?",
        "Henry: You're damn right he owes me!",
        "Audrey: Right, so you can tell him that when you see him!",
        "Henry: What?!",
        "Audrey: Well, when you get together, the -- the father/son kind of bonding thing, you can let your father apologize, and maybe he'll even want to make it up to you.",
        "Vienna: Did he tell you that?",
        "Audrey: Uh, no, not in so many words.",
        "Henry: In -- in any words?",
        "Audrey: Well, e-mail words. Uh, a few letters, you know? But I know -- I know he is absolutely thrilled that he has another son.",
        "Henry: You haven't laid eyes on him, have you, Mom?",
        "Audrey: No.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Audrey: No, not -- not lately. But -- but I know that he is out there somewhere. And when I -- when we find him, it'll be perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You have no right to keep my money.",
        "Emily: Your money?",
        "Paul: Yes, my money.",
        "Emily: You gave me that money free and clear. I'm keeping it. It's my money.",
        "Barbara: My son was not in his right mind when he gave you that money.",
        "Emily: No, actually, he was. And thanks to you, my lawyer's gonna have a very easy job proving that.",
        "Barbara: You are making less sense than usual.",
        "Emily: Okay, let me spell it out for you, Barbara. If you hadn't have tried to have your son committed, he wouldn't have had to revoke the power of attorney.",
        "Barbara: I was trying to get my son the help that he needed!",
        "Emily: Your son was out from under your thumb, and you couldn't stand it! When Paul revoked the power of attorney, he had to prove that he was in full possession of his mental faculties.",
        "Paul: Which I was.",
        "Emily: Exactly. You were. You proved that gentle, kind Paul was also totally sane Paul. Barbara, my lawyer says I should send you a big bunch of roses to say thank you. Do you prefer red or white?",
        "Barbara: Do you know what you can do with your damn roses, Emily?",
        "Paul: Not much gets by you, does it?",
        "Emily: Yeah, very little.",
        "Barbara: And you expect us to believe this?",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. Of course not. That's why I had my lawyer draw up this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a fully capitalized newspaper to get off the ground, thanks to you. Bye.",
        "Barbara: You're not going after her. You are not going after -- you are not going after her, because we have things that are far more important, starting with what are we gonna do about your father?",
        "Paul: Let him rot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I've heard enough, Mom. I want you out, now.",
        "Audrey: No, no, no! Henry, what if he's still downstairs, gunning for me? No!",
        "Henry: Wait here.",
        "Audrey: Um -- you -- you believe me, don't you?",
        "Vienna: I want to.",
        "Audrey: Okay, listen. I -- I swear on my children's lives, I am telling the truth. James really is Henry's father, and -- and he wants to meet with him and -- and get to know him.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Audrey: What? Why not?",
        "Vienna: Because I have to keep him safe from the evil man who kept him as a prisoner, even if that man is his father.",
        "Audrey: But if I thought James was gonna hurt Henry, I would send my son running for the hills and never look back. But that is not -- not gonna happen.",
        "Vienna: But how can you be sure?",
        "Audrey: I -- I'm just -- I'm very sure, okay? I don't want Henry to get hurt, anymore than I want myself to get hurt. But if Ray doesn't get his money, that's exactly what's gonna happen to me.",
        "Henry: No Rays or Jays anywhere in sight.",
        "Audrey: Thank you, Henry, for looking out for me.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Audrey: Okay. I know that you do not believe me. That's okay. But I am gonna go out there, and I'm going to get the proof. I -- I swear, I'm telling the truth.",
        "Henry: She has come up with some crazy schemes in her time, but this one takes the cake.",
        "Vienna: Henry --",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. Do not be taken in.",
        "Vienna: But -- but she seems so sad.",
        "Henry: Of course she -- that's what she wants you to think. And then she walks out the door, and -- and you're raising her kids for the next decade. Trust me, I know how she works.",
        "Vienna: No, I really -- I really don't think it's a con this time. I -- I really think she believes what she's saying.",
        "Henry: Yeah, she -- she seems sincere.",
        "Vienna: Well, what -- what if she's telling the truth?",
        "Henry: Or she thinks she's telling the truth. I mean -- I mean, anyone can send unsigned letters or mysterious e-mails. This whole time, I thought she was playing me, and maybe somebody's playing her.",
        "Vienna: She could be in real trouble.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah, she could.",
        "Vienna: There's only one thing to do. We have to help her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What did I do to tick you off?",
        "Bonnie: Well, what about walking out in the middle of our conversation, Dusty? Or just being downright ungrateful?",
        "Dusty: If I'm such a disappointment, what are you doing here?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I just wouldn't let you off that easy.",
        "Dusty: What do you want from me?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. Obviously, it was a mistake to come here.",
        "Emily: Oh, Dusty, I'm glad you're here, I -- I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Bonnie: No. He's all yours.",
        "Emily: Hmm. What was that all about?",
        "Dusty: Does it matter? What can I do for you?",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not sure how up to speed you are about what happened during your time in the slammer, but Lucinda fired me from \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Dusty: Well, now that I'm back, I'll fix it.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. I -- I don't want you to fix it. I'm starting up my own newspaper.",
        "Dusty: Who's bankrolling this venture?",
        "Emily: Paul. Don't ask. Long story.",
        "Dusty: I bet. So, do you want something from me?",
        "Emily: Yes, actually. I'd -- I'd like to make a deal with you. I mean, I have all the cash I need, so I'm just looking for a few little extras.",
        "Dusty: Such as?",
        "Emily: Office space, staff, printing operation.",
        "Dusty: In other words, everything it takes to put out a newspaper.",
        "Emily: Right. Well, you have the setup. I have the cash. You let me rent from you. I pay the bills. Match made in heaven. Are you in?",
        "Dusty: I think Lucinda would go through the roof.",
        "Emily: That sounds like a photo op to me. Okay, I'll even give Worldwide credit as publisher. Come on, Dusty. Its win-win, and it won't cost you a dime. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Hello? Anybody -- home?",
        "Barbara: Hello.",
        "Audrey: Hello. Uh, oh, I'm -- I'm so sorry. I hope you don't mind. Um, the -- the maid let me in. I don't know if it was a maid, really. Someone.",
        "Barbara: Who are you?",
        "Audrey: I am Audrey Coleman. Nice to see you.",
        "Barbara: Coleman? As in Henry Coleman?",
        "Audrey: Oh, you know my son.",
        "Barbara: In a manner of speaking.",
        "Audrey: Oh, well, any friend of Henry's is a friend of mine. Um, actually, I was looking for a Barbara Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Well, you found her.",
        "Audrey: No way! Wow. I was told that, uh, Barbara was close to my age, but you -- you could pass for 20s. You are just gorgeous.",
        "Barbara: Thank you very much, but I am very busy right now, so if you please.",
        "Audrey: Yeah. Uh, uh, yeah. Of course. Um, I'm an author, like -- like my son, you know?",
        "Barbara: I am more familiar with your son's larcenous habits as opposed to his literary ones.",
        "Audrey: Oh, that's a shame. You -- you really should read his book. It's to die for. Speaking of, uh, dying, do you just love a good murder mystery?",
        "Barbara: Not particularly, no.",
        "Audrey: Oh! Well, you would -- you would love mine. It's really about true crime. You know, listen, um, actually, you are the person I wanted to talk to. I -- I just wanted to talk to you about James Stenbeck.",
        "Barbara: You must be rather new in town. Otherwise, you would know not to talk to me about that man.",
        "Audrey: Oh, I hear you. Been there, done that. You know, you've got to let all that go, though. Otherwise, you just can't heal.",
        "Barbara: You have no idea what that man put me through. He terrorized me and our son for years. And, in fact, I'm not entirely free of him yet.",
        "Audrey: But then all the more reason to tell the world your story, the -- the good and bad memories. You know, like do you happen to remember if James had any favorite hangouts?",
        "Barbara: Hangouts?",
        "Audrey: Yes. You know, a place he might go to hole up till he makes his next move.",
        "Barbara: I think you're barking up the wrong ex-wife, and I do not think that we should keep James' memory alive by discussing him.",
        "Audrey: Okay, well, I -- I'm sorry if I -- I hit a nerve or -- or anything. It's just I wanted to ask questions for my book.",
        "Barbara: You know, I think that you need to go somewhere to get those answers. Thank you, and good day, Mrs. Coleman.",
        "Audrey: Yes. Good day, Mrs. Ryan. I love your house. It's big.",
        "Barbara: Ms. Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: It's going to be fun being in business with you again.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, right.",
        "Paul: Hey, I need to talk to you.",
        "Emily: I'm busy, Paul. An editor's job's never done, remember?",
        "Paul: You don't have a minute for the guy who's footing the bill?",
        "Dusty: Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Emily: Me? Oh, yeah. Never better. I'm in perfect control of this situation.",
        "Dusty: Thank you for what you said in court.",
        "Paul: It'll never happen again.",
        "Dusty: Welcome back, Paul.",
        "Emily: I don't know what you're doing here besides wasting your time.",
        "Paul: You can't possibly expect me to just sit back and let you take my money.",
        "Emily: I don't know how to make this any clearer to you, Paul. You are not getting it back. You can try if you'd like. Use whatever money you have left to hire a legal team --",
        "Paul: You tricked me! Doesn't that bother you?!",
        "Emily: I didn't trick you! You gave it to me willingly!",
        "Paul: I want it back!",
        "Emily: Tough!",
        "Paul: I'm not playing around here.",
        "Emily: Neither am I.",
        "Paul: Give me back my money.",
        "Emily: Make me.",
        "Paul: Why did you just hit me? Why are you hitting me?",
        "Emily: You kissed me.",
        "Paul: Well, a couple of days ago, you seemed to really like it when I kissed you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, a couple days ago, you were a decent guy who cared about me and my future. Now you're just a big jerk who wants to take it all away.",
        "Paul: No. Look, I'm not looking to hurt you here, Em.",
        "Emily: Then -- then don't.",
        "Paul: I need the money back.",

        "Emily: I liked the new Paul much better.",
        "Paul: Oh, stop with the new Paul and the old Paul. Look, I'm just -- I'm me, okay? I'm -- I'm just whoever I am. And -- look at you. You're coming and going. You -- you don't know whether to hit me or kiss me.",

        "Audrey: I am working on it.",
        "Jay: Not fast enough. Not fast enough, and if you need some incentive, I -- I have no problem making your life very, very difficult for you.",
        "Audrey: No, really. Really, Jay, I -- I am working on it. I have this old boyfriend who's just loaded, and believe you me, if I scratch him just the right way, then his scratch will be your scratch. I swear, please, just give me a little more time.",
        "Barbara: Audrey --",
        "Audrey: Oh.",
        "Barbara: I hope I didn't keep you waiting, but we'd better hurry if we're gonna make that lunch reservation. Have we met?",
        "Jay: No. I was just --",
        "Audrey: Asking for, um, directions. Uh, Sir, you're almost there. You just go take a right, go around the corner, and it's the first left. You can't miss it.",
        "Jay: I hope you're sending me in the right direction.",
        "Audrey: Oh, you bet I am. Bye-bye.",

        "Vienna: Well, she -- she owes this man Raymond Zuma money she doesn't have, so all we have to do is give her the money so she can pay him back, and then maybe she'll just drop this crazy idea that you are James Stenbeck's son.",
        "Henry: Where are we supposed to get 50 grand? Or -- or do you have a money tree that I don't know anything about?",
        "Vienna: No, but you do. Geneva. Kim paid Geneva Swift a very nice salary, and I can't think of a better use for it.",
        "Henry: No, no. I was -- I wanted to use that as a nest egg!",
        "Vienna: Yeah, more like a rotten egg!",
        "Henry: You really want me to give it away?",
        "Vienna: Mm. I couldn't spend a -- a penny of that money knowing that you made it by making me miserable.",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'll use the Geneva money to pay off part of her debt, and then we'll borrow the rest.",
        "Vienna: Mm. Oh, I'm so proud of you.",
        "Henry: This better be the last time I have to bail her out. 'Cause it's starting to get really pricey.",

        "Barbara: Oh. And how do you figure that?",
        "Audrey: Um, James and I were intimate a long time ago.",
        "Barbara: And he forgot to pay your hourly rate?",
        "Audrey: Wow. You have a disgusting little mind.",
        "Barbara: No, you see, I saw James' will, and I know that none of his women were mentioned in it.",
        "Audrey: Okay, I -- I need that money. If I do not pay that guy off, then I am dead meat.",
        "Barbara: That's your problem, Audrey.",
        "Audrey: Your son -- Paul, is it? I wonder if he could spare a little something for one of his father's old friends.",
        "Barbara: You leave my son alone.",
        "Audrey: It is a free country, and I can speak with whoever I want, so maybe I'm just gonna go by that museum you call a house and wait.",
        "Barbara: How much do you want?",
        "Audrey: $50,000.",
        "Barbara: And if I give you the money to pay off your debt, you'll leave town, and you'll forget about all of this?",
        "Audrey: So you would just give me the money, just like that?",
        "Barbara: I can write you a check right now. A checkbook and no pen. Excuse me. Could I borrow a pen, please?",
        "Audrey: Well, you certainly are fired up to get rid of me, aren't you?",
        "Barbara: I just want to make sure that I can spare my son any more pain from any of his father's mistakes.",
        "Audrey: People don't just write checks for $50,000 without batting one little tiny eyelash.",

        "Bonnie: Paul, no, no, no. I think I'll reserve judgment for myself on that one.",
