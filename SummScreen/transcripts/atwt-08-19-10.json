        "Chris: You okay?",
        "Katie: Good.",
        "Chris: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Yeah. After all the doubts I had and things I let come between us, you know, I just -- I don't know. That was amazing.",
        "Chris: That was amazing. You are amazing.",
        "Katie: I feel like I could stay like this forever.",
        "Chris: So do I.",
        "Katie: Do you mind if I call Alison and check on Jacob?",
        "Chris: No, no, no. Go ahead.",
        "Katie: Okay. Don't move.",
        "Chris: I won't. Oh.",

        "[Chris grunts, grunts, panting]",
        "Katie: Chris, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Barbara and Emily coughing]",
        "Henry: Oh, thank God you're okay. I've been so scared. Let me just look at your face. You're safe now. It's gonna be okay.",
        "Paul: Let's get you upstairs.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Paul: Mom, you okay to get up the stairs?",
        "Barbara: I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Henry: No, you're not fine. You've been held hostage and your lungs are full of smoke and you're in a weakened state, and I'm not gonna let you make it worse by overtaxing yourself, all right?",
        "Paul: That's right. We're gonna get you both to the hospital.",
        "Emily: We can do that later. First, we are gonna find Iris.",
        "Barbara: I agree. That crazy woman has got to be stopped. [Coughs]",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute. I don't understand. This -- this whole time, we were worried that your mom was missing, and my mom was holding her hostage downstairs in the basement? How does that even happen?",
        "Will: I don't know. Something caught fire in the wine cellar, and when we went down to check it out, my mom and Emily were tied up together on the floor.",
        "Gwen: Are they okay?",
        "Will: They're alive, and they're talking, but when they said Iris did it, I came up to find you, 'cause I don't want you alone with her. I know she's your mom, and I'm sure you don't want to think that she's capable of doing something so sick.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe this, Will. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, and look what happened because of it.",
        "Will: Don't think like that right now. Are you sure Iris is gone?",
        "Gwen: Her drawers were empty. Her bags were gone.",
        "Will: Do you know where she went?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: We have to call the cops.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Can you do that? The girls are gonna be back any minute. I'm gonna text the nanny and make sure that she keeps them out until we know it's safe here.",
        "Emily: Where the hell -- Gwen! Where is that sicko you call a mother?",
        "Gwen: Oh, my God. Emily -- Emily, I'm so sorry.",
        "Emily: Just tell me where she is so I can drag her by the hair to the police myself.",
        "Gwen: I have no idea.",
        "Emily: [Coughs] Sorry. What do you mean?",
        "Will: She just took off she's gone.",
        "Emily: You helped her escape?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: What the hell? Oh. No, no, no, no, no. This can't be closed, not after everything I've done! Barbara's money is in there, and I finally have the passwords! Oh, damn it! This can't be happening! I'm Barbara Ryan! I need my money! Let me in!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: My God. You've been through a terrible ordeal. I'm gonna get you upstairs, and we're gonna call a doctor and get you checked out. I knew you were in trouble. I felt it. Everyone thought I was crazy, but that -- I heard your voice through that baby monitor, and I knew that I wasn't. I knew you were alive, but that you were in trouble, and that you needed me. Now you're in my arms. Oh, my God! My God. I was so terrified I'd never see you again. Look at you. Look at you. You've been through hell, and you look amazing. I'm with you now. I'm with you. I'm with you every step of the way, and I'm never gonna leave you. I'm never gonna leave you ever again.",
        "Barbara: Henry Coleman -- I never want to see you again for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: My doctor has me on a low-dose aspirin regiment. Just supposed to take it every morning. But between the trustee meetings and, you know, making love to you, I completely forgot.",
        "Katie: I didn't even know you were seeing a doctor.",
        "Chris: Eh, it's not a big deal.",
        "Katie: Not a big deal? He has you on aspirin every day. Isn't that for your heart?",
        "Chris: Yeah, but my heart is fine. In fact, come take a listen.",
        "Katie: Did you tell him you passed out at the cabin?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Chris: I'm sorry. I gotta get that. It could be the hospital. Hello? Oh. Hey, Mom.",
        "Katie: Don't tell her you're here.",
        "Chris: Wait. What did you just say? They found Barbara where?",
        "Katie: Barbara?",
        "Chris: No, I got it. Mom, Mom. Listen. Do not worry about it. I'll go down there. I'll check in on her, and whatever I find out, I'll call you, okay? No, no. I promise. Bye-bye.",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Chris: Whoa. Well, they found Barbara. She's been held against her will.",
        "Katie: Is she okay?",
        "Chris: Well, apparently she's walking and talking, but they're gonna take her down to Memorial just to -- just to be safe. My parents are in Chicago. They want me to go down there to make sure she's really okay.",
        "Katie: Henry knew it this whole time that she was in trouble. I wonder if anyone told him she's all right.",
        "Chris: Well, Henry's the one that found her.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Chris: Whoa, wait a minute. What are you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm going to the hospital with you to be with Henry. He must be over the moon with happiness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What do you mean, you don't want to see me again?",
        "Barbara: You heard me. We're done. Now get out of my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily coughs]",
        "Gwen: Here.",
        "Emily: Don't do me any favors.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: Em, come on. Gwen had nothing to do with Iris getting away.",
        "Paul: Okay. Iris will be dealt with, believe me. Right now, you need to take a deep breath if you can, okay? The paramedics will be here any minute.",
        "Emily: I'm not going to the hospital.",
        "Paul: Em, you inhaled a lot of smoke, all right? That's not something you play around with.",
        "Emily: You know what? I'm not gonna die, at least not before I kill Iris.",
        "Paul: Take a number.",
        "Gwen: Emily, I'm -- I'm really so sorry.",
        "Emily: I told you. I told you that your mother wasn't here for some family reunion.",
        "Gwen: And I'm sorry. I didn't want to believe you. I know it was stupid, and I know people don't change. I just --",
        "Emily: Could you just not make this about you, okay?",
        "Will: She doesn't mean that.",
        "Gwen: No, she does, and frankly, I deserve it.",
        "[Barbara coughs]",
        "Will: Mom! Mom, you need to sit down and take it easy. Come on.",
        "Paul: Mom, Will's right. Please sit down, will you? The ambulance will be here in a minute to take you and Emily both to the hospital.",
        "Emily: No, I'm not going.",
        "Barbara: I'm not going, either.",
        "Henry: You have to see a doctor. You've been locked up for weeks without enough food or water! You need to be checked out!",
        "Barbara: Be quiet, and stay away from me, okay? Please.",
        "Will: Mom, you know, if it wasn't for Henry, we might never have found you.",
        "Barbara: Back off, everyone! I am fine! I've been taking care of myself, as Henry said, for weeks.",
        "Henry: I spent every waking moment looking for you.",
        "Barbara: After you married Vienna.",
        "Henry: We're not married! I left her when I found out she was lying about the baby! The marriage has been annulled!",
        "Barbara: But you still married her, didn't you?",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mom! It was obvious to everyone that you were the only thing on his mind. He had to get smashed just to get through the ceremony.",
        "Barbara: Is that supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Henry: We have a connection, Barbara. That's how I knew you were in danger, and no one would believe me, because Iris worked so hard to make it seem like you just -- you just took off and you didn't want to be found.",
        "Barbara: Does that sound like me, Henry?",
        "Henry: No, it doesn't! Not at all! That's why I worked so hard to track you down!",
        "Paul: Iris fooled all of us.",
        "Barbara: Iris is a lush. She didn't fool anyone. You enabled her.",
        "Emily: Okay. You know what? Will you just stop? Paul took my side because I'm his wife. I'm the one who thought you played us, but I was wrong, and I am sorry, okay but he had every right to take my side.",
        "Barbara: You aren't sorry! You aren't sorry at all! You told me that downstairs when we nearly died just a little while ago! I'm the one who was trying to make amends to you, but you wouldn't have it! You know what? We will never be friends! We wouldn't be friends if we were the last people on this earth!",
        "Emily: Well, the feeling is quite mutual, believe me.",
        "Paul: Okay, you know what? The two of you just survived a really dangerous situation. You'd think that would change your outlook.",
        "Emily: The only thing I regret is going down to that wine cellar and hiding that bottle of brandy.",
        "Gwen: What the hell is wrong with the two of you? You're lucky to be safe and with your family. Could you just be grateful for a minute? I have to find my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Well, this isn't the payoff that I was hoping for, but it's enough to get me out of town before the cops catch up with me. Good. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I'm glad you agreed to come get checked out.",
        "Barbara: I didn't agree. My sons insisted.",
        "Henry: So did I.",
        "Barbara: You know, I meant what I said before. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. I want you out of here. So why don't you start by just leaving my room?",
        "Henry: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Barbara: Please. You're not welcome here.",
        "Henry: I don't believe you.",
        "Barbara: Do you want me to have security throw you out?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Let them try. When you were in that warehouse, you called out to me, and don't you dare try to deny it, because I heard you loud and clear. And the fact that it came through on Jacob's baby monitor when I happened to be standing there, if that's not destiny, then I don't know what is.",
        "Barbara: If you had heard me and found me, maybe I would believe this.",
        "Henry: The monitor doesn't come with a GPS, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: You know what? You only found me because Paul smelled smoke when I nearly burned down Fairwinds.",
        "Henry: No. I am the only one that never stopped looking for you.",
        "Barbara: So you claim.",
        "Henry: You have no idea what was going on while you were gone. You don't know how I tore my heart out not knowing what was happening to you.",
        "Barbara: Look, Henry, you're really pushing it here, because if -- if you don't go away, you're the one that's gonna need medical attention.",
        "Henry: You want to hit me?",
        "Barbara: Don't tempt me. Don't tempt me.",
        "Henry: No, no, go ahead. Knock yourself -- knock yourself out. Go ahead and hit me if that's gonna make you feel any better!",
        "Chris: My, my. Somebody's feeling better.",
        "Barbara: That was meant for Henry. He wasn't supposed to duck.",
        "Henry: Well, it's a reflex. Look, if you want to take another stab at it, go ahead.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Probably not a good idea. She needs some rest. But I'm happy to see that you're well enough to have a pillow fight.",
        "Barbara: I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm only here because my sons insisted that I come.",
        "Henry: I insisted, too.",
        "Chris: Okay.",
        "Barbara: Why don't you go find someone who's really sick to take care of, okay, Chris?",
        "Chris: [Chuckles] Cannot do that. I would be disowned, okay? My parents have been worried sick about you. Unfortunately, they're in Chicago. Okay, but as soon as my mom heard that you have been found, she called me up, said, \"Chris, get down to Memorial, and take care of Barbara.\"",
        "Barbara: Okay, all right. You know what? You tell your mom that I will call her as soon as I've had a hot meal, a nice glass of wine, a bubble bath, and 24 hours of sleep.",
        "Henry: She probably hasn't eaten well. I'd run some blood tests.",
        "Barbara: Don't listen to him. I don't know what he's doing here.",
        "Henry: I am here because I love you.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Henry: And her lungs are filled with smoke. You should do an x-ray, make sure there's no permanent damage.",
        "Barbara: Do I look damaged to you?",
        "Henry: You're definitely not yourself.",
        "Barbara: I'm more myself than I've been in months.",
        "Henry: Maybe a head C.T. scan just to make sure everything's okay. I watch a lot of doctor shows.",
        "Chris: Gotcha.",
        "Barbara: You know, Chris, I really think you need to look at Emily. She's the one who's really in danger. Because even though her ordeal wasn't as long as mine -- in fact, it was only a day -- [Gasps] In fact, maybe she's already expired from the smoke inhalation, which wouldn't be such a bad idea, after all.",
        "Chris: I'll tell you what. You seem in pretty good shape to me.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Chris: But I am gonna get you a check-up anyway, all right?",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Chris: And after everything comes back just fine, you can go home, but I'm gonna bring a nurse in here, draw some blood, all right? I'm gonna go check on Emily now. Take care of yourselves.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "Barbara: How much longer do you intend to stand there?",
        "Henry: As long as it takes.",
        "Katie: How's Barbara?",
        "Chris: Hey. Physically, she's fine, but, I get the feeling she's not too happy with Henry right now.",
        "Henry: I get that I hurt you, and I wish that I could take that back. It's what I'm trying to do, if you would just let me.",
        "Barbara: Too bad, Henry.",
        "Henry: No. We love each other. And now we can be together. What is this? What's the point of being stubborn? How is that good for either one of us?",
        "Barbara: When I was alone in that warehouse and Iris had me locked up like some caged animal, I had a lot of time to think. And all I could think about was you. And what I thought about was, Vienna didn't hold a gun to your head. She didn't force you to marry her. If you had really loved me, you would have not given into her temptations.",
        "Henry: Her temptations?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, temptations. You know, youth, tiny waist, fake pregnancy. If you really loved me, you would have been immune to all of that.",
        "Henry: It's not as simple as that. It's not.",
        "Barbara: And then -- and then I realized that after all the mistakes I've made in my life and in love, that maybe this was the way it was supposed to be, that I was meant to die alone. And I'm missed, and then it was just poetic justice. Yes.",
        "Henry: No. I don't understand that. I don't understand.",
        "Barbara: Listen to me, okay? I'm meant to be alone, Henry. When you came bursting into the wine cellar and you came in and you threw your arms around me and you just started talking to me, I forgot about that. I forgot. And then, all of a sudden, when you started talking about moving on and us being together, I realized I can't do that and just forget about everything. I can't do that. I can't.",
        "Henry: I understand.",
        "Barbara: I can't be with you anymore. I can't, Henry.",
        "Henry: I deserve that.",
        "Barbara: So, please, just go.",
        "Henry: I can't. Not until you hear me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Another breath.",
        "Paul: For the record, Doctor, she was coughing an awful lot before we got here.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, you are so dramatic.",
        "Chris: Take another. Take another. Yeah, there you go. Well, your lungs do sound fine. You are lucky.",
        "Emily: Told you.",
        "Paul: So, how's my mom?",
        "Chris: Your mom? Your mom's doing fine. Doing fine. Just as stubborn. I think the best thing for both of them is to go home, get a little rest.",
        "Emily: Thanks, Chris.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You ready to go home?",
        "Emily: I didn't want to come in the first place. So yeah.",
        "Paul: You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?",
        "Emily: I am.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine. You were right. I was wrong. You win.",
        "Chris: Okay. I'm gonna send the nurse in with those discharge forms, and you will be on your way. I'm glad you're feeling better, Emily. Take care.",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: When Vienna and I were happy, she got pregnant for real.",
        "Barbara: I know all about it.",
        "Henry: Right. And I didn't want kids. I didn't want anything to do with kids. I mean, the way I was raised? Hell, you met Audrey. And then you throw Stenbeck into that genetic cocktail? I thought there was a 75% chance that I would have a psychotic. I didn't like those odds.",
        "Barbara: I can't blame you for that, no.",
        "Henry: Okay. But then it was really happening. The baby became real. And I loved that kid. And then Vienna had a miscarriage, and that was a huge moment in my life. I was a changed man after that. Then she told me she got pregnant again, Barbara. I -- I couldn't walk away from her and from that child. I didn't want to be like my mom. I didn't want to be like my dad. I wanted to be a better human being than those two people.",
        "Barbara: The bar's not raised very high there, you know. I don't mean to make light of it, but I just don't think it's a really good excuse for marrying someone you don't love.",
        "Henry: You know children change everything. You would walk through fire for your kids.",
        "Barbara: Yes, and I have.",
        "Henry: Then why can't you see that I could feel the same way? You weren't here when I found out that Vienna was lying. I was so unbelievably angry. I was so hurt. But I was relieved.",
        "Barbara: About the baby?",
        "Henry: No, about Vienna. The fact that she was lying meant that I was free. I was free to be with you. We could be together. But you had disappeared.",
        "Barbara: I didn't do that on my own!",
        "Henry: I know, I know. I know that, and I should have known that then. I just -- Barbara, I was messed up, okay? Suddenly, there was no child, and I know how much that I'd hurt you, and all I wanted to do was find you and say how sorry I was. [Sighs] But if too much has happened and if you feel like you can't give me another chance, then I won't stand in your way.",
        "Barbara: Good.",
        "Henry: But before I let you go, I am gonna tell you the one thing that I've wanted to tell you since the last time I saw you, and that is that I love you, Barbara. I love you and only you. I think you know that. I think you've always known. I think that my love helped you survive in that warehouse.",
        "Barbara: Maybe you're right. You know, I thought about you all the time. I thought about my feelings for you, and sometimes I hated you, and it was all messed up, but I had no one to talk to. So I talked to this doll -- this big clown doll, and he started to talk to me. I know it sounds crazy, I know, but he started to talk to me in your voice. And he comforted me, and he pumped me up, and he held me, and we danced, and that's -- and that's how low I sunk.",
        "Henry: That doll brought us to you. Don't you see? This isn't some random act here. We were meant to be together. We fought it off, but here we are! We've got another chance here. And Vienna and Iris, they can't stop us. Nobody can.",
        "Barbara: That's not true.",
        "Henry: I know they can't.",
        "Barbara: You know, Vienna and Iris, they didn't keep us apart. We let that happen. And they're gone now. And we're here. Just us, and just as unreliable. I'm gonna -- I'm gonna check myself out of here, and I'm gonna go home, alone.",
        "Henry: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: No, no, Henry. No.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: One for the road? What the hell. Double whiskey, neat. Here's to underhanded, unappreciated me.",
        "Gwen: Hi, Mom.",
        "Iris: Gwenny, I just needed to have that last drink before I start back at day zero. See, I knew you'd be disappointed. So that's why I snuck away. But now that I've had that drink, well, I'm just ready to start my life with you and Will and that gorgeous grandbaby of mine.",
        "Gwen: What's with the suitcase?",
        "Iris: Oh, well, this is just -- it's clothes, you know. Its things. It's old- Iris stuff. I was gonna go over to Goodwill, and I was gonna --",
        "Gwen: I don't believe you, Mom. You're nothing but a lying sociopath.",
        "Iris: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: You kidnapped Barbara, and you held her hostage for weeks, and then you did the same thing to Emily.",
        "Iris: You found Barbara and Emily?",
        "Gwen: In the wine cellar, where you left them.",
        "Iris: [Laughs] Is that what they said to you?",
        "Gwen: They almost died in a fire, Mom, in a house where my family was staying. Hallie could have been killed. Did you ever think about that?",
        "Iris: I didn't start any fire!",
        "Gwen: Damn it, Mom! Do you know how hard it was for me to ask Paul to let you stay there? And then you hold his mom hostage in his own wine cellar the whole time?",
        "Iris: That's not true!",
        "Gwen: What kind of human being are you?",
        "Iris: I'm your mother, Sweetie.",
        "Gwen: I don't care. I hate you, and thank God that Hallie is too young to remember what a gross, lying psycho her grandma really is.",
        "Iris: Well, that may be true, Darling, but I'm the only mother you have. I gave you life. You owe me.",
        "Gwen: I owe you nothing, and I don't want you to be in mine or my family's life ever again.",
        "Iris: Fine. That hurts my feelings, but I will respect your wishes.",
        "Gwen: Since when?",
        "Iris: I'll prove it to you. You just turn your pretty little head around, and I will walk out that door, and you won't have to lay eyes on me ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Henry: Oh, hey. It's you.",
        "Katie: I saw Barbara. I'm so glad she's okay.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Thank God. [Sighs] She never wants to see me again.",
        "Katie: Well, she's been through a lot. She probably needs a little time to get used to being home again, right?",
        "Henry: No. She hates me. And she should. I treated her terribly.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Henry: I'm in love with her, but I married Vienna anyway.",
        "Katie: Well, she told you she was pregnant.",
        "Henry: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I made Barbara feel like she was second best, but she's not. And that's the worst part. She's the one, but I wasn't man enough to stand up for her. And now I've lost any chance I'll ever have of being with her. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: [Sighs] Oh. Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah. Empty. Just like my life. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, you're -- you're right, Mom. You're not perfect, but who is?",
        "Iris: Yeah. You know what they say in the program -- \"Progress, not perfection.\"",
        "Gwen: We were making progress.",
        "Iris: Yeah. Everybody slips. You know, that thing with Barbara and Emily, I had no choice. My back was against the wall.",
        "Gwen: I bet it was.",
        "Iris: Thank you for understanding and letting me move on. I really appreciate it, Gwenny. I'm so proud of you. So, give your mother a kiss good-bye, and I will be out of your hair for good.",
        "Gwen: You get all that?",
        "Officer: Every word. Clear as a bell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Em? It's over. They caught Iris. It's over. Where are you? Emily?",
        "[Emily grunts]",
        "Paul: What are you doing?",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Paul: We should do this later. Come on. Em, it still stinks like smoke. I don't think you should be here. It's not good for you. Come on. Come back upstairs.",
        "Emily: All I ever wanted was you and me and Eliza to be a family. That's it. Is that too much to ask?",
        "Paul: Hey. We are a family, and we're back to normal now. Everything's gonna be fine. We get our life back.",
        "Emily: No. I brought this on myself.",
        "Paul: Okay. What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: Well, Will and Gwen, they're your family, and Jennifer. They're your family, Paul, and we put them through hell, and now this is my punishment.",
        "Paul: This isn't punishment.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is.",
        "Paul: No, it's not.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is.",
        "Paul: Iris Dumbrowski's a lunatic.",
        "Emily: No, it's called karma, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's not some instrument of the universe. Iris is, like, a sick, greedy, narcissistic woman who doesn't care whose life she ruined, 'cause she's already wrecked her own. Hey. What is going on with you? Hey.",
        "Emily: She tried to make peace with me.",
        "Paul: Who did?",
        "Emily: Your mom.",
        "Paul: She did?",
        "Emily: We really thought that we might die down here, and she said she was sorry, that if she was given a second chance, she would never come between us again. And you know what I said? \"Not interested.\" Is that all I am? I would rather die angry than let down my guard and forgive another human being? Is that all my life adds up to in the end?",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "Paul: Okay, come here. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Barbara: Go away, Henry, okay? Please!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Barbara: Why can't you take no for an answer, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Sorry. Do you need the room?",
        "Chris: No, not yet. I heard Barbara signed herself out.",
        "Henry: Yeah. She wanted to go home.",
        "Chris: She's still pretty mad at you, huh?",
        "Henry: Mad doesn't begin to cover it.",
        "Chris: Well, look. The good news, Henry, is that she's healthy, right? And in time, you know, she'll come around.",
        "Henry: I appreciate the pep talk, but I know Barbara, and I don't think any amount of time is gonna handle this one.",
        "Chris: Well, hang in there, all right? Sometimes patience really does pay off.",
        "Henry: What's got you all glass-half-full all of a sudden?",
        "Chris: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: Wait a second. No, no, no. I saw that same goofy look on Katie when she came here earlier, and I was too depressed to ask her about it. Are the two of you --?",
        "Chris: There's hope for all of us, even when you're afraid there isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm so glad you're all right.",
        "Barbara: Do you have any idea what I've been through? I'm sure you don't.",
        "Katie: Actually, I do.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry. Yes, I know you do. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: It's all right. They're different, but equally hard to get over.",
        "Barbara: I'm over it.",
        "Katie: Are you?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Katie: Then you must be in some sort of shock, because that would be the only explanation for the way you've treated Henry.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me?",
        "Katie: And before you ask if Henry sent me here, he didn't.",
        "Barbara: Look, I don't know what you're doing here, but you did everything you could to destroy my relationship with Henry, including help Vienna deceive him into a marriage.",
        "Katie: I know. I should never have done that. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Barbara: Feel better now?",
        "Katie: I'm part of the reason this happened. I was just so scared to move forward that I held onto the past. I knew that I couldn't bring Brad back, but Henry and Vienna were our best friends. So I figured that, if they could find their way back to each other, maybe I would feel the way that I used to.",
        "Barbara: That's so crazy, I almost get it.",
        "Katie: And Vienna was so desperate to be married that she lost all perspective, and I completely enabled her. But if I hadn't, you and Henry would be happy together right now.",
        "Barbara: I don't know about that.",
        "Katie: I do. Iris never would have been able to kidnap you, because Henry wouldn't have let her get to you. He would do anything for you, Barbara. He wants to see you happy and healthy more than anything on this earth. He is madly in love with you. He never gave up. He never stopped looking for you. He even put on a dress to try to help find you.",
        "Barbara: That's just a typical day in his life.",
        "Katie: And when nobody else believed that you were in trouble, Henry stayed the course. So, please, please do not hate him. Hate me. I'm the one that helped Vienna trick him. Henry was just trying to do the right thing. He's the only one in this whole mess actually who didn't do anything wrong. Welcome back, Barbara. You were missed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: You set me up?",
        "Gwen: I thought it was time that you paid for all the lying, cheating and stealing that you've done.",
        "Iris: You ungrateful little witch!",
        "Gwen: That's hilarious, coming from you. You ruin everything you touch. But guess what? That ends now.",
        "Iris: You're gonna regret this day.",
        "Gwen: No, Mom, the only thing that I regret is not doing this the moment that you got here. I gave you another chance, and you used it to hurt the people that I love.",
        "Iris: This is all your doing. You turned her against me.",
        "Will: No, Iris. You did that all by yourself.",
        "Officer: Let's go.",
        "Iris: Where?",
        "Gwen: Jail, Mom. Have a nice life.",
        "Iris: How dare you. You're dead to me! You know that, Gwenny? Just consider yourself an orphan! How dare you treat your mother like this!",

        "[Chris grunts]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Oh. Well, you saved the day, Buddy. I don't suppose you have it in you to convince Barbara to forgive me, huh? I didn't think so. Couldn't hurt to ask, though, right? Heard you two got pretty close in the warehouse. Do you have any tips on how I can get her back?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Wow. You look incredible. Should I keep talking? 'Cause I'd love to keep talking, but you said that you didn't want to -- that doesn't matter. You're here. That means what? Do you want to come in? Do you want to talk? Do you want to sit? You want to -- do you forgive me?",
        "Barbara: I'm working on it.",
        "Henry: Work on it as my wife. Will you marry me, Barbara?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, Guys.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Will: Is everything okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah. How about with you?",
        "Will: Iris is in custody.",
        "Emily: Are you all right, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah. She's my mom, but she's a criminal.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: What are you sorry for? I'm the one who should be sorry for what she did to you. You were right about her. I should have listened to you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but sometimes you just can't. And I'm sorry I jumped all over you earlier. I mean, you were just as much a victim of Iris as me and Barbara. And -- none of this probably would have happened if Paul and I hadn't lied to you and will all those years ago.",
        "Emily: [Sighs] We did a horrible thing, and I am sorry.",
        "Gwen: Okay, but that's over now. You and Paul have Eliza, and we have Hallie, and we have a good life.",
        "Paul: Look at all of us, huh?",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "Paul: We're almost a family. I say that calls for a toast.",
        "Emily: Hang on. Get something from the kitchen. No one's going down to that wine cellar anytime soon. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Chris, I got your message. I turned totally beet-red, but in a good way. Chris? Chris?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: [Panting] Reid, its Chris. Look, we're gonna need to up my dosage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: This is for real, Barbara. I want you to marry me.",
        "Barbara: Well, you better get down on one knee and start over.",
        "Henry: Barbara Ryan, will you marry me, and will you be my wife for the rest of our lives and then some?",
        "Barbara: There won't be any babies, Henry. I'm old enough --",
        "Henry: Stop. Everything I want is standing right here in front of me. I am dead serious. I cannot live without you. Please, marry me.",
