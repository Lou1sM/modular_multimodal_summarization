        "Rosanna saw Dusty bribing the building inspector, and warned him that any shady dealings of his could jeopardize her chances of adopting a child with Craig. Dusty wondered if Paul put her up to the warning, but she insisted that wasn't the case. He promised to keep his business dealings clean. Meanwhile, Rose visited Paul and Jen, asking them to participate in her charity bachelor auction. Jen agreed, but Paul said no way. Paul wondered if Rose was using him to make Dusty jealous, and said that Dusty would eventually screw up. When he did, Rose would come running back to Paul, but he would turn her away. She left in disgust at this changed Paul, and he broke down. Suddenly, the \"James\" in his head appeared, and told him that it would be easy to get revenge on Dusty. Rosanna interrupted this \"conversation\" with a warning to watch out for Craig and Dusty. Jen told Dusty about Rose's visit, and flirted with him as she dropped hints that Rose may not be over Paul. Rose walked in just as Jen threw her arms around him. As Rick told Susan that Alison and Chris had stolen the key to his safety deposit box, the young duo made plans to get into the box. Chris pointed out that they could only do it if they could show that Rick was dead; Alison said they could arrange that. Rick confronted Alison, and offered her $1000 for the key. When Alison told Susan, Susan asked why Alison was trying to make trouble. Chris got a fake death certificate from the morgue, and they went to Tom's office to use his notary stamp, but Tom caught them. Bob continued to have problems, and went into arrest."

        "Inspector: Bad news for you, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: Not today, Ron can't happen.",
        "Inspector: Wiring in this place is way below code.",
        "Dusty: What are you saying? I got to upgrade before you pass me? Is that the deal?",
        "Inspector: I'm saying the law's the law.",
        "Dusty: Well, it just sounds like a big hassle for the two of us, doesn't it? Hey -- is that yours? 'Cause it sure ain't mine.",
        "Inspector: No, sir. I don't leave money like that lying around.",
        "Dusty: Look at this. Come here. Take a closer look at this. Your kids are in school, right? So this buys them a few extra books. That's it.",
        "Inspector: I'll get that certificate in the mail to you right away.",
        "Dusty: All right. Thanks, Ron.",
        "Rosanna: Hello. Hello. You're up early.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I bought a rooster. [Rosanna chuckles] so, what are you doing? You here to entertain the workers or -- ?",
        "Rosanna: You're very funny today. Actually, no. I came here looking for my husband. But since he's not here, and you are, perhaps -- perhaps we could use this as an opportunity to set a few things straight.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Let's give it a shot.",
        "Rosanna: All right, then. Wonderful. Well, it has come to my attention that your business methods over the past few years have been -- shall we say less than sound? And as you are involved in business dealings and a partnership with my husband, that's going to have to change.",
        "Dusty: See, that sounds a little bit like an ultimatum to me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, I suppose you could look at it that way. I suppose you could say that I expect you to be 100% honest in all of your business dealings from now on, no exceptions.",
        "Dusty: Or what?",
        "Rosanna: Or Craig and I could lose our opportunity at having a family. And I am certain you wouldn't want that to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So Barbara lays down this new rule that I'm not supposed to spend any time with Will by myself. And I didn't want the kid to think that I'd just given up on him, right? So I go by the Lakeview just to check up on him.",
        "Jennifer: Without being invited?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I was worried about my kid brother, huh?",
        "Jennifer: Right.",
        "Paul: I might have had another reason.",
        "Jennifer: Which was?",
        "Paul: Turn the heat up a little, you know? I didn't want Barbara to think that she could just scare me away.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I thought so. So what happened?",
        "Paul: Well, the whole thing kind of blew up in my face. Mother and I, we got into this huge argument, right? I said a whole bunch of things that I probably shouldn't have said. And Will, he hears the whole thing. He gets seriously angry at me.",
        "Jennifer: What did he do?",
        "Paul: Well, he ordered me to stop and insisted that I apologize.",
        "Jennifer: You're kidding. Well, did you?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I had no idea that he was so devoted to that woman.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you know, Paul, boys that age are supposed to be protective of their mothers. Especially Will. You know? He's -- he's seen her fall apart too many times.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I played right into Barbara's hands. You know, instead of me coming through for Will, I have pushed him closer to the one woman that can hurt him most in the world.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, don't worry. You know -- the next chance I get, I will tell Will how much you love him. Remind him of it. But I think -- I think he already knows deep down that you would do anything -- anything to make him happy.",
        "Paul: I would. And you know that goes for you, too.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Paul: I'll get it. Wow. You must be selling something.",
        "Rose: Kind of. And I hope you'll be interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Can you tell what's wrong with him?",
        "John: We're still working on it. His blood pressure has been going up by the hour. That's not a good trend.",
        "Kim: Well, can you -- can you give him something to bring it down?",
        "John: We have a couple of options, but I would like Ben Harris to take a look at him before we do anything. He's with a patient. He should be here any minute.",
        "Kim: John, you've got to do something to help him. He's been fighting so hard.",
        "John: We're gonna get him through this, Kim. We're gonna get him through it.",
        "Kim: Honey -- Bob, listen to me. Sweetheart, listen to me. I know that you're tired. I know that you've had it with lying here. But you can't let that make you give up. You've got to fight it. One breath at a time, sweetheart, fight it. Fight it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Are you all right?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yes, of course, darling. I'm just -- just looking for something.",
        "Susan: Is that why you left me all alone in bed so early in the morning?",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. Did I wake you? I tried to be quiet.",
        "Susan: It's all right. So, what are you looking for?",
        "Rick: The key to my safety deposit box.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This key can help us prove Rick is the killer. All we need to do is open the box and find out what he's hiding.",
        "Chris: Alison, I don't think you realize how strict the rules are about who can use those keys.",
        "Alison: So, then we'll get around them.",
        "Chris: Any idea how?",
        "Alison: Not yet. But, Chris, my mother is going on vacation with a serial killer, and I have to stop her. Maybe we can ask Hal to talk to the bank or something.",
        "Chris: Alison, he couldn't even get a search warrant for your mother's house.",
        "Alison: Well, we could -- we could say that you're Rick Decker. We could get a copy of his signature.",
        "Chris: Whoa, Alison, stop, okay? I think we've hit a wall here. I mean, the only way this would possibly work is if Rick were dead, and you had the power of attorney.",
        "Alison: All right, then let's do it.",
        "Chris: Do what?",
        "Alison: Kill Rick Decker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Well, don't let this get to you, okay? It's just a key. It can be replaced. Or we can call the bank and get the whole process started of getting you another one.",
        "Rick: Sure, I mean, all I have to do is fill out a couple of hundred forms, and they have to replace the locks. The box won't be available to me for days.",
        "Susan: But does that really matter? There's nothing in there that you need right away, is there?",
        "Rick: That's not the point. Why should I be inconvenienced because your daughter and her boyfriend stole my safety deposit key?",
        "Susan: What? You're accusing Chris and Alison? Why? Why would they do that?",
        "Rick: Susan, when we got home last night, the place was a wreck. It looked like somebody tore it up looking for something. And then they gave us this lame story about that they were making out? Come on, I knew. Didn't you? It was obvious they were covering up.",
        "Susan: You still haven't told me why you think they stole the key to your safety deposit box.",
        "Rick: They were searching for evidence against me. Obviously, they didn't find anything, because it doesn't exist. Then they came across the safety deposit key, and they decided that they would look in the box and see if there was anything in there.",
        "Susan: Alison would never steal anything from this house.",
        "Rick: Susan, I know you love Alison, but aren't you being a little naive?",
        "Susan: In what way?",
        "Rick: Alison is just 18. She's already been in jail. Breaking the law is part of her character. And it's about time that you acknowledged that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Chris, wait. I didn't mean that we would kill Rick Decker for real.",
        "Chris: Well, that's encouraging. What did you mean?",
        "Alison: All we need to do is convince the bank that Rick is dead and that I have power of attorney. Then they'll let us use the key, and we can get into the box, right?",
        "Chris: That's a lot of ifs.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but don't you think that we should at least see if it's possible?",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, they're still gonna ask for a death certificate.",
        "Alison: Okay, then we'll get one.",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, it's a legal document, okay? You can't just buy one in the store.",
        "Alison: I know that, Chris. But this is a hospital. Where do they keep them?",
        "Chris: In the morgue.",
        "Alison: And that would be in the basement, wouldn't it, doctor?",
        "Chris: No, forget it.",
        "Alison: No, Chris, you wouldn't get caught. I bet that they don't even count them.",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, you are asking me to do something that could cost me my career.",
        "Alison: No, Chris, I'm asking you to do something that could help me save my mom's life and probably your father's, too. But if you're afraid, then it's better that I know now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: If I break the law, it's gonna cost your family? How's that work?",
        "Rosanna: Well, let me explain it to you. Craig and I are planning on adopting a child.",
        "Dusty: Congratulations. That's great news.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Thank you very much. But it is not going to be easy. The adoption agencies are extremely thorough. We will be under constant scrutiny for months.",
        "Dusty: Of course, they're dealing with kids. They got to be careful.",
        "Rosanna: Exactly. Exactly. You understand. And that's where you come in. You see, I can't have you getting in the way of this.",
        "Dusty: Well, how would I get in the way of that?",
        "Rosanna: Well, suffice it to say that you are not the ideal business person, I feel, for my husband to be involved with. I'm sure you understand what I'm saying.",
        "Dusty: Listen, I really appreciate your concern, but you got to know, I'm a legitimate businessman now.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, wonderful. I'm very happy to hear that. Did you happen to mention that to the electrical inspector? [Dusty chuckles] yes, I'm sure you're aware that it's against the law to bribe public officials.",
        "Dusty: A bribe. You call that a bribe? That wasn't a bribe. That was a minor incentive, a quick way to get things done.",
        "Rosanna: Well no more minor incentives, if you don't mind. No more bribes. No more gambling, nothing illegal. Or Craig and I won't be able to have a family. Do you understand?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course. Don't worry. That's not going to happen.",
        "Rosanna: Good. Good, I'm happy to hear it, because if it does happen, I don't know if I'll be able to stop myself from doing everything I possibly can to ruin your life.",
        "Dusty: I got a question for you.",
        "Rosanna: Please.",
        "Dusty: Did Paul Ryan put you up to this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on in. Let's get this over with.",
        "Rose: Thanks. Hi, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Hello. You know, I'm gonna take this into the other room.",
        "Rose: No, no, no. I need to talk to you both. Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: All right, you said you were selling something. Why don't you get started with your pitch so that I can tell you that we're not interested?",
        "Rose: Don't say that. Not -- not until you see the invitation. Here. Thank you. I'm having a charity event for breast cancer research, a bachelor auction at my shop. I need some volunteers. You guys want to help out?",
        "Jennifer: What would you want me to do?",
        "Rose: You can be there. Bid on one of the guys. Not a bad night -- out with a good-looking guy, having a little fun. It's a great cause.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, count me in.",
        "Rose: Thank you. It'll be a blast, trust me.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Okay, so, what about me, huh? I mean, I can't imagine that you want me to bid on one of the bachelors. Hey, maybe you want me to be one of the bachelors.",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah. Why not? That'll be fun, maybe.",
        "Paul: Really? Yeah. You want to explain to me what kind of fun it would be for me to stand there and watch you and Dusty hold hands behind the hairdryers?",
        "Rose: I wasn't planning on doing that.",
        "Paul: Well, what are you planning, Rose? Maybe you want to bid on me yourself, huh? Make Dusty a little jealous?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Alison has had some problems. She's made some mistakes, but she's paid for them. So don't start with the sweeping generalizations about her character. I can't allow you to insult my kid like that.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. Obviously, everything you've warned me about -- all the pressure, it's getting to me. I mean, think about it, Susan. Just in the past few months, I've been accused of murder, taken off cases, interrogated, investigated. So if I'm a little suspicious about Alison and Chris, it's because I've been under constant attack.",
        "Susan: I know it's hard, but you can't lose your perspective. Not everybody is out to hurt you.",
        "Rick: No, no, no. I'm sorry, but Alison is unpredictable, and it's obvious that she still doesn't trust me. And I have to confront her in person.",
        "Susan: Where are you going?",
        "Rick: I'm going to the hospital to ask Alison about that key. Now listen, I know that may not sit well with you, but my life, my career could be at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I got no reason to make Dusty jealous. I don't know where you're coming up with this idea.",
        "Paul: Experience.",
        "Jennifer: Uh, Paul? You need anything? I'm gonna make a run.",
        "Paul: Nope. I don't need anything.",
        "Jennifer: Uh, I'll call you about the auction.",
        "Rose: Yes. Thank you for getting on board. I appreciate that.",
        "Paul: Now look what you did. You scared away my little sister.",
        "Rose: I should've done this over the phone. I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you know what? I don't know why you didn't do that.",
        "Rose: Because -- Lily -- she wanted you involved and Jen. And I thought if I came over in person --",
        "Paul: You thought what?",
        "Rose: That maybe --",
        "Paul: I would be so touched by that that I would forgive you for everything that you did to me?",
        "Rose: I don't care about forgiveness. 'Cause you're not gonna give it to me. That's your choice. But I'm thinking maybe we could start over.",
        "Paul: As what?",
        "Rose: Don't you remember? We were friends. We were such good friends. I was hoping that maybe I could get my friends back, nothing more than that.",
        "Paul: You have a new friend now. Is Dusty not enough for you?",
        "Rose: I shouldn't have done this. You know what? I did -- I did come here for another reason.",
        "Paul: Oh, really? Tell me why.",
        "Rose: 'Cause I was hoping maybe I could get a glimpse of the Paul that I knew. That great guy who I fell in love with, that I wanted to spend my life with. But that guy is -- he's not coming back. He's dead.",
        "Paul: That's true.",
        "Rose: Is he dead?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Rose: And he's not coming back?",
        "Paul: You're absolutely right. But don't -- don't comfort yourself thinking that he died of natural causes. 'Cause he was murdered by my fianc\u00e9e and my best man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Good?",
        "Inspector: Yeah, thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me; what does Paul Ryan have to do with anything I just said?",
        "Dusty: Paul Ryan dislikes me. I hear you are friendly with him. I think that perhaps he encouraged you to put the squeeze on me.",
        "Rosanna: Ah, and from whom did you hear that I was friendly with him?",
        "Dusty: My partner. That guy you're married to.",
        "Rosanna: Well, let's get one thing clear. I am not trying to put -- as you so aptly put it -- the squeeze on you. I'm trying to have a conversation with you. We are having an understanding, I hope.",
        "Dusty: Still kind of feels like a squeeze to me, I got to tell you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what do you expect? I come in here. I find you bribing a public official. You expect me to just ignore that?",
        "Dusty: Can the two of us find a way to get along, or what?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Do you really want to get along with me? Well, lovely, then I suppose that there is something you could do.",
        "Dusty: What's that?",
        "Rosanna: You could leave Paul Ryan alone. I know you and Craig both hate him. I don't want you ganging up on him.",
        "Dusty: And why does it concern you?",
        "Rosanna: Because I told you, Craig and I don't need any enemies, particularly at this time.",
        "Dusty: Hmm. You sure that's all it is?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, positive. I'm sorry. Is there a problem?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I guess I'm having a problem understanding this position you're taking as Paul's personal guardian angel. And I think your husband might have a problem with it, too.",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't think so. I think my husband knows that Paul means nothing to me. He is nothing more than a casual acquaintance at best.",
        "Dusty: That's really interesting. 'Cause Craig didn't tell me it was that casual when he walked into the Lakeview lounge, and he saw you and Paul locked up in a clinch.",
        "Rosanna: And my husband told you this?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. He did. And now you're asking me to lay off Paul, at the same time you're adopting a baby with my partner. You see the position I'm in? It's hard for me to tell whose side you're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Why am I even considering this?",
        "Alison: Because you know how dangerous Rick is, and that my mother and your father and anyone else at this hospital could get killed any minute.",
        "Chris: You're right, Alison. We can't wait for the police to go through the proper channels. We have to do something now.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Chris: Come on, Alison, we're not out of the woods yet. All right, we need to get those documents notarized, and that won't be easy.",
        "Alison: For us? The team of the century? Just promise me that you'll get the death certificate.",
        "Chris: I promise, Alison. I'll go down there first chance I get.",
        "Alison: Oh, Chris, you are the most amazing, wonderful man in the whole entire world. If we weren't at the hospital right now, I'd show you exactly what I mean.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I got all the trouble I can handle right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm through playing games with you. I want my key back, Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: He's making a fool out of you, Rose. And you're just letting him do it, again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I want that key back. Now.",
        "Alison: You lost something? What would you pay to get it back?",
        "Rick: No, I am not negotiating with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You top my list of most painful memories.",
        "Rose: This is what you want? This, right here, this? You are so ugly inside you'd rather hate me than forgive me?",
        "Paul: I would love to forgive you. I'll forgive you. There's -- there's only one condition.",
        "Rose: I can't talk to Dusty.",
        "Paul: Could I possibly make it any easier for you?",
        "Rose: I can't do that.",
        "Paul: You in love with the guy?",
        "Rose: What if I am? Love is good. Right? It's great. I've been told that my whole life.",
        "Paul: He's beneath you, Rose. No decent human being would want anything to do with the guy.",
        "Rose: This is my life. I don't care what anybody else thinks.",
        "Paul: This is -- you know what? Does he -- does he ring your chimes like nobody else ever did before? Is that what it is?",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah, that's it. That's part of it, yeah. Are you glad you asked me?",
        "Paul: Oh, really? What's the other part? Huh? Is he teaching you how to swindle people out of their life savings? 'Cause that -- you know, I can see how that could be romantic.",
        "Rose: No, he's done with the wrong side of the law. He is. He's a businessman now. Bought the Java Underground.",
        "Paul: Did he?",
        "Rose: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: You know you need money for that. Dusty doesn't have any.",
        "Rose: That's -- well, he has a partner. Craig Montgomery. Craig put up the money. Dusty runs the place.",
        "Paul: That's what he told you?",
        "Rose: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: And can you see that? I mean, really, could you see that? Him in an apron? Serving drinks to who, the Rotarians? I give -- I give him a month before he's back to his old tricks.",
        "Rose: No, he wants a different life.",
        "Paul: He can't. All right? He doesn't know how to do that, and he doesn't want to learn. He's making a fool out of you, Rose. And you're just letting him do it -- again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: There is no reason, Mr. Donovan, for you to be confused about my loyalties. I love my husband, and he and I are planning on adopting a child. And I can't have you or anyone else jeopardize that.",
        "Dusty: We plan on doing everything by the book.",
        "Rosanna: Excellent. I'll hold you to that.",
        "Dusty: This kid means everything to you, huh?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, you have no idea.",
        "Dusty: No, I might. I might. I think about kids, too. I'm thinking about maybe having 'em. I mean, not right now, but you know, I can see a time when probably it just means everything to you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's lovely. Then you can understand that that time for me is now. And if Craig does anything illegal involving you, Paul Ryan, this club, anything else, I lose my chance at becoming a mother, and that can't happen. So my darling husband has to stay clean. You have to help him, and by association, so do you.",
        "Jennifer: I'll give you one chance to guess who showed up at my apartment. Oh, I'm sorry. I'll wait until you're done.",
        "Dusty: We're done. You two know each other?",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Oh, you're Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Munson.",
        "Rosanna: Hello. Nice to see you. You're -- you're Paul's sister.",
        "Jennifer: That's me.",
        "Rosanna: Lovely. Well, we'll just be a minute. Um, we do understand each other, right?",
        "Dusty: Of course we do.",
        "Rosanna: Lovely. Thank you so much. Try not to do anything foolish, huh?",
        "Jennifer: What was that all about?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. It looks like your brother has Rosanna in his corner -- big time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Look, I don't mean to add any more pressure to the mix. And I know you're doing the best you can. But the sooner Bob comes out of that coma, the better our chances are of finding the killer, Ben.",
        "Ben: Are you saying that you don't think it was Dr. Gordon?",
        "Walter: We think it was a setup. We don't think Dr. Gordon committed suicide. We think he was murdered.",
        "Ben: Any idea who did it?",
        "Walter: We have a suspect, but we don't have any proof. We think it was Dr. Decker.",
        "Ben: Look, I know that's who you were looking at. What does Bob have to do with putting Decker away?",
        "Hal: We think that Bob read something in Nurse Krebs' diary that was incriminating to Rick. But Bob went into the coma before he could tell us about it.",
        "Walter: We want your word that you'll let us know as soon as he wakes up. We want to question him ASAP.",
        "Ben: Well, believe me, everybody will know. I will be going through these halls praising the Lord.",

        "Rick: If you give me that key, I promise I won't tell your mother. She won't like this, Alison. Let's do our best to avoid a problem in the family.",
        "Alison: I'm not making problems, Rick. You are. Now I have to get back to work. And look, I hope you found what you're looking for.",
        "Rick: Just a minute. I know you hate me. Frankly, I'm not that fond of you, either. But this has gone on long enough. I want that key back. Now.",
        "Alison: How bad?",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Alison: When people usually want something, they're usually willing to pay for that.",
        "Rick: You're trying to get money out of me?",
        "Alison: All I did was ask a question. You lost something. What would you pay to get it back?",
        "Rick: No, no, no, no. I am not negotiating with you.",
        "Alison: A hundred? Thousand? How much is it worth to you, Rick?",
        "Rick: Alison, let's just take it easy for a minute. All right. You want money for the key, I'll give it to you. How does a $1,000 sound?",
        "Alison: How about a million?",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Alison: You heard me. Hand over a $1 million in nickels and dimes, and you can have your stupid key back.",
        "Rick: So you did take it, you little thief. I'm warning you, Alison --",
        "Susan: Rick! Did I just hear you call Alison a thief?",
        "Rick: That's what she is! She admitted taking the key.",
        "Susan: Is that true?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Rick: She is lying.",
        "Alison: Mom, he offered me $1,000. Doesn't that strike you as a little weird?",
        "Rick: Oh, please. I don't know what I was saying. I'm just so frustrated! I've just lost all perspective.",
        "Susan: Rick, its okay. I'm not blaming you. Why do you insist on causing me problems?",
        "Alison: You never take my side. Even if I saved your life, you'd still think that I was just trouble.",
        "Rick: I'll go after her.",
        "Susan: Rick, don't. There's something I have to say to you.",

        "Alison: Chris! Thank goodness you're here.",
        "Chris: Why? What happened?",
        "Alison: Rick offered me $1,000 for the key. That proves that there's something in that box that he doesn't want us to know about.",
        "Chris: Well, he's not going to have a choice much longer. Look.",
        "Alison: You have the death certificate.",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Thanks. Well, do you have any idea on how to get it notarized?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I was thinking about that on the way up there. My brother Tom has a notary stamp in his office.",
        "Alison: Oh, you're a genius. Well, should we leave now?",
        "Chris: No, I can't, I'm still on duty. But I got a break in 20 minutes.",
        "Alison: Okay, perfect. I'll download the power of attorney, and I'll meet you in the parking lot, okay?",
        "Chris: Be careful, Alison.",
        "Alison: You, too. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Rick, you got to calm down. If people see you this out of control, it's gonna confirm every suspicion they have about you.",
        "Rick: Susan, my property was taken without my permission. That key is mine, and I want it back in my possession today.",
        "Susan: Why? What is in that safety deposit box that's so incredibly important to you? Claudia, what is it?",
        "Claudia: It's Dr. Hughes. I just heard he's not doing well.",
        "Susan: Oh, no. Poor Bob. He's been fighting so -- Rick! Rick, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You know, I don't know what you're talking about. My brother hardly knows Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, well, they both have a very strong dislike for me. Don't they? And if they hook up, they could close this place down before I even reopen it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, what makes you think that they've decided to hook up?",
        "Dusty: I feel like someone's trying to trap me, you know, and I don't even know who it is.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, Paul does not want to hurt you anymore.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to hurt him either.",
        "Jennifer: But your partner might.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about? Why would he want to do that?",
        "Jennifer: Because that's the kind of person he is. No, Craig Montgomery is the most awful person I've met in my entire life. [Dusty sighs] fine, don't take it from me. You'll find out soon enough for yourself.",
        "Dusty: Weren't you gonna tell me who showed up at your apartment?",
        "Jennifer: It was Rose.",
        "Dusty: Rose stopped by your place?",
        "Jennifer: She came over to invite Paul and me to a benefit at her beauty parlor.",
        "Dusty: Well, that was friendly of her.",
        "Jennifer: That's one way to look at it.",
        "Dusty: What's another way to look at it?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Maybe she just can't stay away from Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: He's a loser, Rose. He's a loser who lives off of other people.",
        "Rose: What about you? You used to be his friend.",
        "Paul: No, no, I --",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Never.",
        "Rose: Yep.",
        "Paul: No, Dusty was friends with poor dead Paul, that chump who died in an airplane crash.",
        "Rose: I'm glad I came here. I think you and I needed this time.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Rose: Just to prove once and for all that there's nothing -- nothing between us. I have made mistakes. I have made big mistakes. And I was hoping that I'd learned from them. But, maybe I didn't. But I'm out there, you know? I'm out there. Not hiding up here in a penthouse --",
        "Paul: I'm not hiding.",
        "Rose: Pointing fingers at people.",
        "Paul: No, you think I'm hiding? I'm waiting.",
        "Rose: For what?",
        "Paul: For Dusty to screw up. And then you're gonna come to me, and you're gonna tell me that I was right.",
        "Rose: Don't hold your breath on that one.",
        "Paul: I'm not holding my breath. Just waiting. I dream of that moment, Rose. When you come to me, and I open up the door, and you're beside yourself because of something that Dusty has done to you. And you'll look at me. And you know what I'll do? I'll show you back to the street. 'Cause that's where you belong.",
        "Rose: You know -- dreams tell a lot about a person. If that's really your dream, you are the saddest person I've ever met.",
        "Imaginary James: So she still gets to you. And I thought you were past that.",
        "Paul: Will you please just go away?",
        "Imaginary James: Son, I know what you're going through. I admit I can remember when I was totally obsessed by your mother.",
        "Paul: I really don't want to hear this.",
        "Imaginary James: I know how to make it all better for you, Paul.",
        "Paul: All right, then tell me.",
        "Imaginary James: You prove to Rose that Donovan's worthless, thereby getting your revenge on him. And who knows, maybe Rose will come -- come running back to you. Interested?",
        "Paul: Very.",
        "Imaginary James: Good. Paul, stop punishing yourself, and start punishing those that deserve it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You think you're gonna make me jealous or what, by dropping little clues about Rose and Paul?",
        "Jennifer: Sorry. It was just a thought.",
        "Dusty: 'Cause if Rose asked Paul to a benefit, it's probably 'cause Lily wanted him there. 'Cause Rose would never go back to your loser brother. No offense. She's got no reason to.",
        "Jennifer: Pretty confident, huh?",
        "Dusty: I know my strengths.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you could show them to me sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Hey, what's going on here?",
        "Imaginary James: Paul, do you realize how easy it would be to get rid of Donovan? Hmm? He has records. Evidence appears there. Some evidence appears there. You alert the authorities. Why not?",
        "Paul: It's not as simple as you make it sound.",
        "Imaginary James: Of course it is. Now, son, when are you going to --",

        "Paul: Who is it?",
        "Rosanna: Rosanna Cabot. Hi, I'm so sorry to just drop by like this. I hope I'm not disturbing you.",
        "Paul: No. Come on in.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. I wanted to thank you very much for bringing up that idea of adoption. Craig and I talked about it and he's agreed. We're very excited.",
        "Paul: Well, that's great. And I'm very happy for both of you.",
