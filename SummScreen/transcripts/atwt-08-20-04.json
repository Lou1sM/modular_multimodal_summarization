        "Jack finds a piano at Julia's and plays the song from his wedding. When she asks him how it makes him feel, he replies, happy. Back at home, Parker refuses to go to the memorial service so Mike offers to stay with him. As Carly is about to leave, Parker begins playing the same song that Jack is, Carly dumbfounded because he'd never played it ever before. James shows up in Barbara's penthouse, assuring her that he's leaving for good. When she pleads with him for his help regarding his escape, he tells her tough luck. At the church, Barbara arrives and tries to comfort Roseanna, but when it's made evident that she helped James escape, Roseanna attacks her. The church fills up, Jennifer making sure that her mother fesses up, but Barbara still denies it. Hal and Nikki come in and arrest her. Ben comes home and Doc is there, infuriating him even more. He presses Jessica for the truth and when she won't come clean, he states that the baby's blood was AB negative and that the child she was carrying was Doc's son, not his."

        "Doc: Did I say the wrong thing?",
        "Jessica: It's all wrong. One minute, I had a child growing inside me, and the next, I didn't. It keeps catching me off-guard, how much I loved someone that -- whose voice I hadn't heard, who I hadn't held yet, how much I wanted to meet him.",
        "Doc: It was a boy?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. It just felt like it -- look, Doc, I'm sorry to unload all this on you, so thank you for coming by.",
        "Doc: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't get all impersonal on me. That baby you lost could have very well have been mine.",
        "Jessica: Don't say that!",
        "Doc: You're the only person I can say it to. You're the only one that knows that I'm grieving, too.",
        "Jessica: No, you promised me, Doc.",
        "Doc: I know.",
        "Jessica: Ben and I can get through this. We can, but I need your help. I need you to keep your promise. Ben cannot know that I slept with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: The baby wasn't mine.",
        "[Ben remembering]",
        "Doc: So if you want to go ahead and hate yourself about this, you go right ahead, but you know what? I am sick of your attitude, and I've had enough of it to last a lifetime.",
        "Ben: Hey, Doc, do not use that tone talking to my wife. Was he here on business, or was he really here asking you questions about Tom and Margo? Jessica didn't tell me anything. I heard thing at the Country Club, and since Tom left, I assumed --",
        "Margo: Well, you assumed wrong. I did not sleep with Doc Reese.",
        "Jessica: The message said something about a surprise lunch at the Lakeview --",
        "Curtis: -- From the other man who adores you? Who did you think it was?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: Ben, you get any answers? Ben?",
        "Ben: What?",
        "Walker: The lab results on your baby, you were gonna check to see if there was a mix-up.",
        "Ben: No, no mix-up. I got it all figured out now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey! Oh, oh.",
        "Lucy: I was so scared you wouldn't be here.",
        "Craig: What's all this, huh? What happened? Sweetness?",
        "Lucy: I got a message from Jennifer on my way over here.",
        "Craig: Jennifer Munson?",
        "Craig: What about Cabot? Is he hurt?",
        "Lucy: Dead. Cabot's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I can't cry anymore, Jordan.",
        "Jordan: We are at a memorial service. Tears are a given, but I think everyone would understand if you decided not to stay.",
        "Rosanna: No, I want to be here. I want to be here for Carly. You know, when I look at you, I see him.",
        "Jordan: Same here. I know that you're not his birth mother, but you brought him into my life. Whenever I wondered how or if I could be a good parent, all I had to do was watch you.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry to interrupt. I saw your car outside.",
        "Jordan: We were just talking about everything.",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna, I am so sorry.",
        "Rosanna: Did you speak to Hal? Did they find James?",
        "Jennifer: Not yet.",
        "Rosanna: Well, they have to find him. That man has got to pay for what he did.",
        "Jennifer: He isn't the only one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Barbara gasps]",
        "Barbara: How did you get in here?",
        "James: Apparently, I just escaped on my way to a maximum security prison. I wouldn't be daunted by your hotel suite.",
        "Barbara: What do you want, James?",
        "James: I just wanted to thank my beautiful wife. None of my recent accomplishments would have been possible without your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, hey, let me help you with that.",
        "Julia: Thank you, prince charming.",
        "J.J.: Is that him?",
        "Julia: Yes, this is Jack. It's not polite to stare, honey.",
        "Jack: Nice to meet you, J.J.",
        "J.J.: How long is he gonna be here?",
        "Julia: For a little while. I'll explain it all to you later, okay?",
        "J.J.: I'm not supposed to call him Jack, am I?",
        "Jack: Sure. Why not?",
        "J.J.: I usually call old people by their last name. Aren't you Mr. Somebody?",
        "Julia: Oh, he's adorable, isn't he? You know, I am giving you permission to call him Jack for now.",
        "J.J.: He's just got one name, like Eminem?",
        "Julia: Yeah. When in doubt, treat him like a rock star, okay? Didn't you say you wanted to play your video game?",
        "J.J.: Oh, yeah.",
        "Julia: Okay. You have ten minutes, and then you have to clean your room.",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "Jack: He's cute.",
        "Julia: Yeah, and then some. So did anything come back while I was gone? Any memories, feelings?",
        "Jack: Your name feels more familiar now that I'm in the house. J.J.'s name, too.",
        "Julia: Jack, I had never seen you before you came to the hospital, okay? I wouldn't lie to you about that.",
        "Jack: Okay. Anyway, I was thumbing through these magazines looking at pictures. You know, the living rooms, kitchens, hoping that one of the houses would remind me of the place that I call home, where I live, with the woman I married. Only when I turn the pages, I was just waiting, hoping that someone would pop out and say, \"this is you, Jack. This is who you are.\" But I got nothing. I'm beginning to think I'll never remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker, honey, I thought you were changing into your suit. We have to leave soon.",
        "Parker: I don't want to go.",
        "Carly: Parker --",
        "Parker: Everybody's going to the church to say good-bye to Jack, but I don't care what they say. He's not dead! He's not!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Julia: Do not get discouraged, Jack. We're going to find out who you are.",
        "Jack: And what if I'm divorced, or my wife died or something? What if I live alone?",
        "Julia: What if you stop with the negative thinking for like five minutes?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: I guess we could check on our own, on the internet maybe.",
        "Julia: Now you're talking! Okay, look, things may come back to you on their own. They may. You could be sitting there watching television, and all of a sudden, like -- bam -- a bolt of lightening. The whole world comes back to you. Could happen.",
        "Jack: You think?",
        "Julia: I think it's good to think positive.",
        "Jack: And that works for you?",
        "Julia: Yeah, sometimes.",
        "Jack: Well, I've gotten lucky so far. I mean, I've got you.",
        "Julia: You do.",
        "Jack: I don't know what I'd do -- what you did for me, let me stay here. Most people would run the other way.",
        "Julia: No, they wouldn't. Not once they got to know you. You're a good guy.",
        "Jack: How can you possibly know that?",
        "Julia: I just do.",
        "J.J.: My game's broken! It just stopped working, Mom!",
        "Julia: As expensive as this thing was --",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, why don't you let me take a look at it? If it's really and truly broken, it can't get any worse, right? Come on.",
        "Julia: It probably couldn't hurt.",
        "J.J.: Are you a repairman?",
        "[Julia and Jack laugh]",
        "Jack: I don't know. Come on, let's find out.",
        "Julia: It's all right.",
        "Jack: Man -- the screen's frozen. Julia, do you have a Phillips head screwdriver or something?",
        "Julia: Uh -- it depends.",
        "Jack: Come on, J.J. Let's see if I can really destroy this thing. I'm kidding. Wow, 470,000 points! How long have you had this, J.J.? Years?",
        "J.J.: Only a couple of weeks. My mom only lets me play like ten minutes a day.",
        "Jack: You're kidding me! You've had it that long, and you racked up that many points? This game's not broken, buddy. It's just scared of you. Here we go. Let's see what we got. Viola!",
        "J.J.: You fixed it! Yay!",
        "Julia: What do you say?",
        "J.J.: Thanks, Jack!",
        "Jack: You got it.",
        "Julia: Well, we, I think we've just learned something else about you.",
        "Jack: Because I fixed a kid's toy? What is that supposed to mean, that I'm a computer genius or something?",
        "Julia: A genius? No, I don't think so.",
        "Jack: Then what? What are you talking about?",
        "Julia: The way you were with J.J. just now, like a dad. There's probably a child, or children, that mean a lot to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know that you don't want to believe that Jack is really gone. I don't want to believe it either.",
        "Parker: We put the note in the bottle and threw it in the river for Jack to find.",
        "Carly: I know, honey.",
        "Parker: He hasn't had time to find it yet. When he finds it, he'll come home. Just wait, Mom.",
        "Carly: I can't.",
        "Parker: You think Jack's dead.",
        "Carly: What I think is that Jack will be with you and be with me and Sage in some ways.",
        "Parker: You think Jack's dead. That's why you're going to the church, to say good-bye! But I won't go with you! I won't!",
        "Carly: Parker. Parker--",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Mike: Hey, I heard yelling. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: Everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: You okay?",
        "Hal: No. I keep thinking if we'd just gotten to the scene of the accident sooner, we might have gotten to Jack before it was too late. You know, in all the years that we worked together, he was there for me every time I needed him. And the one time that he really needed me --",
        "Nikki: I wish there was something I could do to make this easier for you.",
        "Hal: You have. You have, you are, just by being here. Listen, Nikki, I wanted to talk to you. With Jack gone, there's an opening here. The commissioner has given me a list of candidates. They're all good, but -- Nikki, how would you like to come and work with me?",
        "Nikki: You want me to stay in Oakdale permanently?",
        "Hal: I know you agreed to stay temporarily. And if you want to go back to the Feds--",
        "Nikki: Yes.",
        "Hal: Eventually they'll move you up, and I know it's a big decision, but--",
        "Nikki: Dad, stop talking. My answer is yes.",
        "Hal: Consider yourself employed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Why don't we talk about this a little later. Rosanna, why don't you go get some fresh air, go find your sister?",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Jordan: Okay. What were you about to say?",
        "Jennifer: I was gonna tell Rosanna about my mother, about how she helped James escape. I am so ashamed, Jordan.",
        "[Jen sobs]",
        "Jordan: Oh, Jen, Jen. This isn't your fault, okay? You didn't hurt Cabot, you loved him just as much as we did. James did this.",
        "Jennifer: Cabot was such a sweet little boy.",
        "Jordan: Yeah. Yeah, he was. And if it takes the rest of my life, I'm gonna see to it that James Stenbeck rots in hell for what he did to my son.",
        "Jennifer: Well, what are we gonna do about my mom?",
        "Jordan: She has to pay, too, Jen. She has to pay for helping him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How dare you even insinuate that I had anything to do with that child's death!",
        "James: You helped me escape, darling, so I could do the deed. You enabled me, Barbara. You always have.",
        "Barbara: I only helped you because you threatened Will! I never would have helped you if I had known you were going to kill the baby!",
        "James: Well, I knew that you would do anything to save Will. I could have handed you the detonator and said, \"Press here,\" and you would have done that, too.",
        "Barbara: I am not you. There are places I won't go, there are things that I wouldn't do. Things that I thought even you weren't capable of --",
        "James: What?",
        "Barbara: Killing an innocent baby -- your own grandson.",
        "James: I didn't kill Cabot. Paul, and Rosanna, and Jordan -- they killed Cabot. My right to build a dynasty, and they destroyed my legacy. So now they're gonna have to learn to live with the consequences of their greed. I gave them everything, and then they had the arrogance to think that they could crush me -- humiliate me, put me in shackles and send me away to solitary confinement for the rest of my life.",
        "Barbara: They just wanted to be happy!",
        "James: Well, then they needed to be taught! If Papa isn't happy, then no one is going to be happy. It's not prudent for me to stay in Oakdale under the circumstances, so I'm going away. This is truly, and absolutely, goodbye.",
        "Barbara: If only I could believe that.",
        "James: You can. Just consider it a gift for everything you've been to me. I will miss you, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: James! What if I need to contact you?",
        "James: Oh, you'll find other lovers. They won't match up to me, but just do the best you can.",
        "Barbara: What about the police? I told Jennifer that I helped you, she told Hal --",
        "James: Just deny everything.",
        "Barbara: I have, but if they come after me, for aiding and abetting -- what if I need your help?",
        "James: Darling, you will always need my help. But, unfortunately, you won't have it anymore. You won't have James Stenbeck to lean on -- ever again. From now on, you're on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: I'll keep my promise. I won't do anything to threaten your marriage.",
        "Jessica: And I'm going to spend my life showing Ben how much I love him. How proud I am to be his wife.",
        "Doc: He's lucky.",
        "Jessica: No. I'm the lucky one.",
        "Doc: I guess you'd rather I keep my distance from now on.",
        "Jessica: I really appreciate you coming by, Doc, I do, but --",
        "Doc: Never again. Got it. Listen, if there's anything you ever need, anything I can do, please let me know. Jessica, please, please -- I mean, let me make some part of this right.",
        "Doc: Hey, I was just leaving.",
        "Jessica: Doc just came by --",
        "Ben: No explanation, please. To tell you the truth, I'm not the least bit surprised to catch you here with my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: What did the police say?",
        "Craig: That there was an explosion and that Cabot was the only fatality.",
        "Lucy: No --",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Daddy -- do you want me to go?",
        "Craig: No. No, no, no. No, I want you here. I want you here with me now, and always.",
        "Lucy: I know I wasn't related to Cabot -- he was only in my life for a few minutes, but it still hurts.",
        "Craig: Oh, sweetness, I know. I know. He was a special boy. He was gonna bring us together as a family. That's what I wanted. He made Rosanna happy. He made everyone happy. As if that was enough.",
        "Lucy: You wanted me here. And I'm still here.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Yeah, you are.",
        "Lucy: And we can help each other. I won't be alone and neither will you. Okay?",
        "Craig: Okay, okay.",
        "Lucy: Rosanna -- she's lost the most. Who's going to keep her from being alone right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Rosanna. I didn't think -- well, with what happened to Cabot I just didn't expect you to --",
        "Rosanna: I'm here for my sister.",
        "Barbara: Of course. I just want you to know that I am so sorry for your loss. And I hope that you know that I --",
        "Rosanna: Don't. Please, don't.",
        "Barbara: I understand, that's all I want to say. I know how horrible it is to have an innocent child taken away from his mother --",
        "Rosanna: I can't do this right now.",
        "Barbara: I don't know what you've been told, but I had nothing to do with what happened to Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about?",
        "Jordan: She thought that Jennifer had told you. She's the one who helped James escape. She helped him murder our child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Ben: Admit that you did it again! Admit it, that you betrayed me again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: No, you completely misunderstood what I was trying to tell you. I am innocent.",
        "Rosanna: I will kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Ben --",
        "Ben: I was about to thank Doc for everything he's done.",
        "Doc: I haven't done anything.",
        "Ben: You're the one took Jessica to the hospital. Come to think of it, that's not the first time that you just happened to be there when she needed help. It's only natural that he should come by, see how you're doing.",
        "Doc: I hope you'll accept my condolences.",
        "Ben: Why wouldn't I? After all, it's a sad day.",
        "Doc: If there's anything I can do --",
        "Ben: I really need to be with my wife.",
        "Doc: I understand. Well, goodbye.",
        "Jessica: Listen, Doc, thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.",
        "Ben: You and Doc have sure come a long way. Seems like it wasn't too long ago, you told me you hated the man.",
        "Jessica: Well, I still wouldn't say we're friends --",
        "Ben: What would you say, Jessica? What would you call him?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I'm grateful he was there to take me to the hospital. I mean, that counts for something, right?",
        "Ben: You think you've been appreciative enough, Jessica? I mean, Doc has been generous to a fault.",
        "Jessica: I don't know what you're --?",
        "Ben: Its gone way beyond driving you to the hospital and sending you flowers. Way beyond being a client or a friend who stops by from time to time to see how you're doing when your husband isn't home. Will you stop acting like he's just here holding your hand in a time of need? We both know that Doc Reese has done a hell of a lot more with you than that.",

        "Jack: Move back three spaces, you're killing me! Do you know that? You're killing me.",
        "J.J.: Yes. I won!",
        "Jack: Of course you won. I demand a rematch.",
        "Julia: Rematch later, you still have to go clean your room.",
        "J.J.: But, Mom.",
        "Julia: I know.",
        "J.J.: Will you be here tomorrow?",
        "Jack: I guess so.",
        "J.J.: Good! I love slaughtering you.",
        "Jack: I love slaughtering you! Get out of here.",

        "Carly: Parker won't let it go. He's convinced that Jack is still alive.",
        "Mike: Well, dragging him to the memorial service is not going to change his mind.",
        "Carly: Hal and I agreed that we would let him deal with this at his own speed. Which is why I let him write that note to Jack, and put it in a bottle and throw it into the river. But if he doesn't acknowledge what happened --",
        "Mike: It's going to take time for it to seem real to him, and to you. But you'll get there eventually -- you'll have to. Okay? Because the reality is, Jack's gone.",
        "Carly: I don't want that to be true. I want him back, Mike. I want Parker to be right.",
        "Mike: Do you want to cancel the memorial service?",
        "Carly: No, I can't do that. Jack has family and friends who need to say goodbye. I have to do this.",
        "Mike: But Parker doesn't have to. Not today. I'll stay here with him.",
        "Carly: Would you?",
        "Mike: I'd be happy to. I get to take this tie off. Go on upstairs and get ready.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Hey, sweetie, how 'bout this? Mike is gonna stay with you while I'm gone, okay?",
        "Parker: I don't have to go to the church?",
        "Carly: Nope. I'm gonna go change. I'll be right back down.",
        "Mike: Hey, buddy. You like baseball, right? You wanna go outside and throw the ball around?",
        "Parker: It's okay.",
        "Mike: All right. How about some milk and cookies? All right, I'll see what I can find.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: The pilot that we think helped James escape was arrested in Chicago a few hours ago. So, if this is the right guy --",
        "Nikki: He'll give us information about where James is headed.",
        "Hal: No, Stenbeck is too smart to let some pilot know what he was planning.",
        "Nikki: Yeah, but even James Stenbeck can make a mistake. I mean, what if he let something slip? You don't expect the pilot to give you information that will convict Stenbeck? You think he'll give you Barbara?",
        "Hal: If she's the one who helped James escape, then she hired the pilot. And if she spoke to him directly --",
        "Nikki: She's an accomplice to murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Stay away from her. Just get out of here!",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. I am here for Jack Snyder's memorial service. And I have done nothing wrong! And Rosanna, and everyone else, has to know that, too! Rosanna, please listen to me.",
        "Rosanna: How could you help that animal? You, more than anyone, knew what he was capable of. You could have stopped him!",
        "Barbara: No, I didn't help him! You're making a terrible mistake.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, please, Mother, you admitted it to me! You at least owe Rosanna the benefit of the truth.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no! You completely misunderstood what I was trying to tell you. I am innocent!",
        "Rosanna: I will kill you! I will kill you! I will kill you!",
        "Barbara: No!",
        "Jennifer: Stop it, Rosanna.",

        "Holden: I didn't think you were gonna be here.",
        "Molly: Carly and I worked things out. Partly because of you.",
        "Holden: Me? What did I do?",
        "Molly: Well, what happened between us -- well, I just started thinking about things, mistakes I've made, and how selfish I've been, and I went to tell Carly she was right about me. And I couldn't believe it -- she forgave me. She cut me some slack.",
        "Holden: You didn't tell her about what happened?",
        "Molly: No. No, I didn't need to tell her about it, she -- so, something good came out of it.",
        "Holden: The reason I'm asking whether or not you told Carly is because there's something that you should know --",
        "Craig: Holden, I'm sorry about Jack.",

        "Jordan: Break it up.",
        "Rosanna: How could you?! How could you help James kill my son!",
        "Barbara: I didn't help him do that! You have to believe --",
        "Jennifer: Stop it, Mom. I know, and the police know about the tape James sent you.",
        "Barbara: Yes, he sent me a tape. He threatened Will's life on that tape. But not even that was enough to make me help him. I would never help James Stenbeck escape from prison. I swear on the lives of my children. You all have to believe me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You're angry.",
        "Ben: That's perceptive of you.",
        "Jessica: Why?",
        "Ben: Isn't that a lawyer thing, that you don't ask a question unless you already know the answer. Oh, but you already do know the answer, don't you, Jessica?",
        "Ben: Don't leave this room. We are dealing with this now!",
        "Jessica: Ben, I can't do this now.",
        "Ben: Well, too bad you didn't say that to Doc Reese. You know, when you first told me you wanted to have a baby -- I was amazed at the lengths to which you would go to get pregnant. You were a woman with a mission.",
        "Jessica: Ben, I --",
        "Ben: I'm not finished. Then, when I found out that my wife was gonna have a baby, I was so thankful, I was bursting with pride and happiness, and I wanted to tell the world. But you wanted to keep it a secret. Why?",
        "Jessica: There were a lot of reasons --",
        "Ben: There's only one that matters. You didn't want anybody to know that we were having a baby. It seemed more than a little strange. And then, there was this big fight that cropped up between you and Margo, right about the same time.",
        "Jessica: Honey, I don't understand why we have to go over this --",
        "Ben: Because being a father to my son meant everything to me.",
        "Jessica: Our son?",
        "Ben: The baby was a boy.",
        "Jessica: How could you -- how could you know that?",
        "Ben: Because knowing how much you wanted to have a baby, I wanted to be sure that when we were ready to try again, there weren't any genetic problems, so I had some tests run on the fetus after the miscarriage.",
        "Jessica: You ordered an autopsy on my baby, and you kept that from me?",
        "Ben: Well, that doesn't compare to what you kept from me, does it?! Say it!",
        "Jessica: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Ben: Say it!",
        "Jessica: Ben, this isn't about our losing our baby, this isn't about us.",
        "Ben: Damn it, Jessica, admit that you did it again! Admit that you betrayed me again!",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, you're upset about the miscarriage, and that's understandable. It's understandable that you would wanna lash out lash out at something, that you wanna blame something.",
        "Ben: Jessica, the baby -- the baby's blood type was \"AB\" negative. \"AB\" negative, you know what that means? It wasn't mine. The child you miscarried, the baby you're mourning -- it wasn't mine. It was Doc's.",

        "Jack: I'm sorry. I guess I should have asked if I could of used it.",
        "Julia: No, that song -- that's the same one you were humming in the hospital?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's been floating around in my head for awhile.",
        "Julia: There must be a reason for that. How do you feel when you play it?",

        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. There's plenty of food in the kitchen if you need anything, and I'll be home as soon as I can --",
        "Mike: Carly, we'll be fine. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: That music -- that's the music from my wedding, from when I married Jack.",

        "Barbara: Fine. You can all hate me since that seems to be the favorite sport in this town, but my conscience is clear. You will not find one shred of evidence that I helped James, because I didn't!",
        "Hal: Barbara. That evidence you're talking about? It turns out it does exist.",
        "Barbara: But it wasn't me, Hal. It was James. James killed Cabot, not me!",

        "James: Ah, the dawn of a new life. And as we begin, we shall continue -- for us, nothing but the finest. We'll live in a castle high up on a cliff. We'll live in a beach house overlooking the beautiful blue lagoon. And we have money. Lots and lots of money. I've got money hidden in secret places all over the world -- just the two of us, just the way it should be. [James with Cabot on the airplane.]",
