        "Luke: What's wrong?",
        "Noah: Nothing. [Cell phone rings] Yeah?",
        "Col. Mayer: Yeah? That's how you answer the phone?",
        "Noah: Yes, Sir. I mean, no Sir.",
        "Col. Mayer: You're already late.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry, Sir.",
        "Col. Mayer: Do you mind telling me what you are doing that is so confounded urgent?",

        "Gwen: Thank you. Hey, did you have to do a craving run? I'm like obsessed with vanilla malts here.",
        "Sofie: Excuse me?",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I saw you at the pre-natal clinic like an hour ago. I guess not. I'm pretty much an idiot --",
        "Sofie: No, no, no, you're right. I -- sorry, I was just like a million miles away.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I get it. My head has been in the clouds as well. My husband and I actually didn't think that this could happen.",
        "Sofie: It was an accident?",
        "Gwen: No, it was -- it was more like a miracle. We're both really excited.",
        "Sofie: Oh, that's great. It's nice you're so happy about it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You're not. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- that's none of my business.",
        "Sofie: No. No, it's okay, really. Would you like to sit down? It's -- it's kind of nice to talk to somebody who's going through the same thing.",
        "Gwen: Uh, yeah. I mean, if you don't mind, that would be great. I'm waiting for my husband anyway. My name's Gwen, by the way.",
        "Sofie: I'm Sofie.",
        "Gwen: Nice to meet you.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, so, how far along are you?",
        "Gwen: I'm in my first trimester. What about you?",
        "Sofie: Me too. You're obviously really psyched about it. Is your husband too?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he's really excited. He loves kids.",
        "Sofie: Me too. I -- I just haven't told my boyfriend yet.",
        "Gwen: Oh, not to get too personal, but were you -- you were not planning this?",
        "Sofie: No, but I'm sure he's going to be really happy. We just -- we just moved here and things are still kind of up in the air. So -- he's actually meeting me here too. So, maybe you and your husband will get a chance to meet him. We don't really know a lot of people around here.",
        "Gwen: Oh, well, you know me now.",

        "Cole: Sofie, what are you doing with my sister?",

        "Dusty: I live here. We're going to run into each other.",
        "Aaron: Do you want a drink or what?",
        "Dusty: I want to talk to you.",
        "Aaron: Well, I'm supposed to be polite to my customers, but I can't see what you possibly have to say to me.",
        "Dusty: Look, I don't care what you think about me.",
        "Aaron: Well, guess what? I already knew that.",
        "Dusty: But when it comes to Alison, you don't know what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cheri: I need this posted on the internet immediately.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Cheri: I know there won't be. You're so resourceful. Something I really admire in a man.",
        "Elwood: That's good to know.",
        "Cheri: Now, it's a little more involved than just posting it. I need that video hyper-linked to Mr. Donovan's address book. But you can do that, can't you? For me? You can -- what do they call it? Hack into his files?",
        "Elwood: Uh, well, I could do that --",
        "Cheri: But?",
        "Elwood: Well, I got in trouble before, and my mother got really upset --",
        "Cheri: Whoa, whoa, whoa, shhh -- Honey, you don't ever want to be talking about your mother to a woman like me. It spoils things. Things you don't want spoiled.",
        "Elwood: I can -- I can do that.",
        "Cheri: I know you can. Oh, we're going to have so much fun. I can just feel it.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, me too.",
        "Cheri: So, go on now. Get your little chore over with so you can come back and get the reward. I just love the barter system. Hey, I know you, you're Emily Stewart's sister.",

        "Katie: Jack's gone? Are you telling me --?",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no, oh -- I'm so stupid. I should have just realized -- no, he's not dead. No -- look he left the hospital they took him to without being discharged. He just -- vanished.",
        "Katie: To where?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Col. Mayer: I think I asked you a question. And I think I would like an answer.",
        "Noah: Um, I wasn't doing anything. I was -- I just lost track of time.",
        "Col. Mayer: I'm not the only one you inconvenienced here, Noah. You think you would like to explain how you lost track of time to Miss Coleman?",
        "Maddie: Hello, Noah. Are you doing something that you shouldn't have been?",
        "Noah: No, I -- just lost track of time.",
        "Maddie: Don't worry about it, it's actually a good thing. It will give your father and I some more time to get to know each other. I'll see you in a bit.",
        "Noah: Right.",
        "Maddie: Oh, hey, is Luke there?",
        "Noah: Yeah. He's -- he's right here.",
        "Maddie: Okay, I posted tomorrow's schedule. Could you have him take a look at it?",
        "Noah: Right. Um, Maddie posted tomorrow's schedule if you want to take a look at it.",
        "Luke: So that's it? We're going to talk about work?",
        "Noah: Huh? You mean that? Yeah, I bet you didn't see that coming.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't think you did, either.",
        "Noah: Look, you're not mad or anything, right? I mean, we're still friends?",
        "Luke: How would I be mad?",
        "Noah: Because of the way I mess with your head.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Noah: Hey, you're always so serious about everything -- you're always so serious about being -- you know --",
        "Luke: Gay?",
        "Noah: Yeah, so -- I thought this would be a good way to shake things up a bit. You know, lighten you up?",
        "Luke: Noah, you can say whatever you want to say, but we both know what happened.",
        "Noah: Look, I was out of line. My dad's in town and I act sort of weird when he's around -- but you know, it was a joke. I hope you do get that --",
        "Luke: Noah --",
        "Noah: Look, it was a joke, okay? Don't go making more of it than it was!",
        "Col. Mayer: You know, when I was Noah's age, I never would have let my girl cool her heels like this.",
        "Maddie: I really don't mind. It's okay.",
        "Col. Mayer: See, now you're just making excuses for him. That's why a stint in the army would teach him a little discipline, make a man out of him.",
        "Maddie: See, I think he already is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're judging Alison for a stupid mistake?",
        "Aaron: So, I'm supposed to be understanding? It was just a one-time moment of weakness.",
        "Dusty: That's right.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, how come she's still on payroll? Look, I saw you give her the money. Yeah, she's really turned her life around.",
        "Dusty: You don't even deserve an explanation, but I'll give you one. I offered her money so she wouldn't have to worry about a down payment on her rent when she moved out of her mom's house. And she turned it down. Because she's quite a woman. She turned her life around all alone. That takes a lot. A lot more than serving drinks and passing judgments, don't you think? Give me another.",
        "Aaron: If you can't stand me so much, why don't you just leave?",
        "Dusty: Because I think you're the right person who can help her. Because I think you're the person who matters to her.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, too bad the way that Alison lives and the way I want to live just don't go together anymore.",
        "Dusty: Buddy, I'm glad we had this talk. It's clear to me now that Alison deserves better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but I get a new best friend, I kind of like to be part of the selection process.",
        "Cheri: That's wonderful. That sounds just like something Emily would say.",
        "Alison: You know my sister?",
        "Cheri: We're like that. We have so much in common. For example, a real dedication to our craft.",
        "Alison: Oh, you're a journalist, too?",
        "Cheri: I don't write. I do a lot of work under covers. Undercover. Like Emily.",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Cheri: I haven't seen her around for a while. Is she okay? Still fighting the good fight?",
        "Alison: She's fine. Just been out of town for a while, that's all.",
        "Cheri: Well, I'll have to send her an e-mail. Tell her I ran into that pretty little sister of hers she was always talking about. Alison, isn't it?",
        "Alison: That's right. It was --",
        "Cheri: She has a cute -- wait, a name of you, a nickname -- Ali, that's it.",
        "Alison: Uh-huh. It was nice meeting you but I have to get going --",
        "Cheri: What? Have you got a late date or a meeting, perhaps?",
        "Alison: Now, I know she didn't tell you about that.",
        "Cheri: I guess it just slipped out. You know, she's so proud of you -- the way you turned your life around. And now -- oh, baby, your life is going to change in ways you can't even imagine.",

        "Brad: Want some aspirin or something?",
        "Katie: I just want to talk to Jack.",
        "Brad: I know, but the Idaho police, they don't know where he went.",
        "Katie: He's not going to stop. He's not going to stop until he has J.J..",
        "Brad: Do you want to lie down for a while? I'll stay right here --",
        "Katie: No. I'm not going to lie down. I want to call him again.",
        "Brad: Katie, Katie, he's been out of range forever. He hasn't answered his cell in days.",
        "Katie: So what -- I'm supposed to stop trying? I can't do that. He's going to be fine. He's going to be fine. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: J.J., back away from there. I don't want you in there, too -- come on, hold on -- hold on, Honey -- you got to hold on for me, please? Please hold on.",
        "J.J.: She's not breathing.",
        "Jack: J.J., it's going to be okay. Everything's going to be okay. Come on, Carly. Come on, Carly. Get that out of you. Come on, Carly. J.J.'s right here. It's all over. Come on, Baby. Come on, Baby. That's it! That's it! That's it, Honey. Ohh. Yeah. All right. There you go.",
        "Carly: Ooh. You --",
        "Jack: Shh, shh, don't talk. Just breathe.",
        "Carly: I knew you'd come.",
        "Jack: Shh.",
        "Carly: J.J.?",
        "Jack: He's right here. He's fine. Everything's fine. So, now I'm going to get you home. All right, I'm going to get you home. Everything's all over.",
        "J.J.: Daddy!",
        "Carly: Run! J.J., run!",
        "Silas: He's not going anywhere and neither are you. Look at my face. Look what you did.",
        "Carly: It's not enough.",
        "Silas: Always with the smart mouth, huh? Just like him. I tried to raise him, tried to do things right. But it was a little too late from the get-go.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry what I said to you --",
        "Silas: Don't talk to me, talk to him. Cause you're about to meet your maker, all three of you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How did you find her, Sofie? And what are you up to?",
        "Sofie: So, the good thing about my job is not only does it bring in a little money, but it gives my boyfriend some time alone.",
        "Gwen: Oh, what does he do?",
        "Sofie: He's writer. He writes songs.",
        "Gwen: That's -- well, that's funny, so do I.",
        "Sofie: Really?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sofie: Well, I can't wait for you to meet him. I want to meet your husband, too, see how he handles it.",
        "Gwen: Handles what?",
        "Sofie: Living with a writer. Are you like my boyfriend? Do you carry a song inside of you for a long time before you can actually write it down?",
        "Gwen: Sometimes. Yeah, sometimes it goes pretty fast.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm getting better at knowing what's going on. He used to be thinking about a lyric or something, and get real quiet and I'd say something stupid -- I'd like, talking -- talking about what we needed at the grocery store, and he'd lose the whole thing. Because I'd forget that when he was quiet like that, he was actually working.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that's actually I think -- you know, allocate time for working or make sure you write down what you're thinking. Because you can't really expect the whole world to be quiet just because you're working on a song.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I said it wrong. He's really sweet. He just works so hard. And I hope he writes a song about me someday.",
        "Gwen: Yeah?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, it's how he expresses his feelings. He doesn't talk about them much.",
        "Gwen: So, what's your boyfriend's name? Hey --",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: Hey, good looking. How are you?",
        "Gwen: How are you? Hi.",
        "Sofie: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Oh, this is my husband, will. This is Sofie. We met at -- we actually just met here. Actually, she and her boyfriend just moved to town.",
        "Will: Oh, cool, well, welcome to Oakdale. I hope you like it.",
        "Sofie: I do.",
        "Will: Good. How was the clinic? Is everything okay?",
        "Gwen: Yes, it's really good.",
        "Will: Great. She's pregnant. You probably -- she probably already told you that, but I'm excited about it -- we're having a baby so I tell everybody.",
        "Gwen: Yeah --",
        "Will: Sorry.",
        "Gwen: He's a little happy.",
        "Sofie: I can tell.",
        "Will: Anyway, we should probably get going. I don't want to miss the movie. Let's get tickets.",
        "Gwen: Oh, okay. I'm sure part three is going to be much better than part two. Well, it was -- it was really nice meeting you and I'm sure I'll see you again.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, same here. Same here. Enjoy the movie and good luck with everything.",
        "Will: Thanks. It was nice seeing you.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, good-bye. Cole --",
        "Cole: You proud of yourself? You think you put one over me?",
        "Sofie: I don't -- I don't know what you mean.",
        "Cole: Don't give me that. I want to know what you were doing with her and I want to know now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, it seems like you're having a lot of fun here, but I'm not. So, see you.",
        "Cheri: And I like, so many others, will be seeing you.",
        "Dusty: Cheri, what are you doing talking to her?",
        "Alison: Cheri?",
        "Cheri: How rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself. Cheri Love. I'm a real fan of your film work. You're such a pro. Just like your sister, even when you're working with amateurs.",
        "Dusty: Leave her alone. It's over and I mean permanently.",
        "Cheri: Dusty, Dusty, Dusty. He's got a real hair-trigger temper, don't you think?",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah. You don't want to play with me.",
        "Cheri: I won't. I was just being friendly, that's all. One working girl, to another, you know. I wouldn't dream of intruding where I'm not wanted. So, you two, have a nice day. Have a real nice day.",
        "Alison: That woman gives me the creeps.",
        "Dusty: What was she talking to you about?",

        "Cheri: Elwood, I hope you're calling with good news.",
        "Elwood: Sorry to tell you this, but I've kind of run into a problem.",
        "Cheri: So, fix it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: She was just playing with me. You know, she never really told me the real reason she knew Emily. She was just making weird remarks and kept letting me know how much she knows about me and stuff.",
        "Dusty: I don't know why she cares about you? It's me she's after.",
        "Alison: What, she's still mad at you about Emily?",
        "Dusty: Oh, well, it's more than that. I kind of put a damper on her business and she didn't take it too well.",
        "Alison: Um, I mean, she just bumped into me, it was an accident. And like I said, I think she was just trying to mess with my head.",
        "Dusty: I hope that's all.",
        "Alison: I'm sure it is. I mean, besides, what else could she do to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cheri: Elwood, handle this. You have to. I want to make sure that Dusty and Ali's wonderful little film gets the widest possible distribution.",

        "Silas: Are you scared? Well, you have every reason to be because you're about to pay for everything that you've done.",

        "Silas: What?",
        "Carly: Run, J.J., run!",
        "Silas: You witch! Get ready to say good-bye to them, little man.",
        "Carly: No --",
        "Jack: Do you like beating up on women and little kids, huh? I'm sorry that's over for you, Silas. I'm really, really sorry that it is over, huh? So what do you think I should do now, Silas? After what you've done to my family.",
        "Silas: He is not your son.",
        "Jack: Sorry, wrong answer!",
        "Carly: Jack! Jack?",
        "Jack: Don't worry. That would be too easy on him. Too quick. I want you to pay for what you've done for a long, long time. And it looks like your transportation's here. Put your arms back. Both of them. J.J., you're the man, Buddy.",
        "J.J.: So is Mom.",
        "Carly: We've got some family.",
        "Jack: We sure do.",

        "Jack: That's good to hear. Because I love you, too.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Katie, listen, I got to go. The local cops are here.",
        "Katie: Okay. Tell J.J. I love him.",
        "Carly: Jack, have her tell Sage and Parker. They have to know.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right. Sorry -- make sure Parker and Sage know what's going on, okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, Parker's upstairs. And I'll call Sage.",

        "Vienna: Not quite yet. But once he gets home, everything will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
