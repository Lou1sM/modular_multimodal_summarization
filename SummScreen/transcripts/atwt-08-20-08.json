Parker takes Carly's cell phone and calls Liberty and she tells Katie, who thinks this will work out perfectly if Parker follows Liberty on her \u0091date'. Parker bribes JJ to help him get out of the house. Leo arrives as Katie, Brad and Liberty have lunch and pretend it is by accident; they ask him join them. Parker and JJ lie to Carly and say they are going to the movies. Lucinda shows Lily her new dresses and then asks her to throw a dinner for Brian. Lily teases Lucinda about how she heard Brian likes her. Lily invites Brian, Luke and Noah to dinner. Liberty sees Parker watching her as she sits with Leo and worries this is going to hurt him, but Katie tells her that it is the wake up call for Parker to back away a bit. Liberty begrudgingly goes along with their plan, as Janet sees what is going on when Parker takes off; Janet goes after him and explains that there is nothing going on with Liberty. Liberty and Leo leave, as Parker watches them. JJ is caught sneaking back in and Carly calls Jack, who knows where Parker is. When Jack, Carly and Janet realize Parker is gone and so is Liberty and Leo, Brad and Katie realize their plan went awry. Brad and Katie fess up, as Carly, Jack and Janet are furious. Leo is all over Liberty, who tells him to leave her alone, as she takes off and Leo follows her. Parker shows up and punches Leo. Liberty is thankful he saved her and calls her mom to tell her what happened. Everyone heads over as Liberty explains how Parker saved her. Brad thanks Parker, as Liberty is upset with her dad and Katie for setting this in motion. Brian warns Luke about the philanthropic world being very conservative; he might want to not advertise he is gay. Luke thinks it isn't right to have to hide being gay and is annoyed at Brian's suggestion. After Brian leaves, Luke tells Lucinda and Lily that he isn't sure Brian is right for the job. Surprised by his about face, Luke admits what Brian said to him. Lucinda and Lily don't believe Brian is homophobic, but he was simply trying to warn Luke of what he is up against; they ask him to give Brian another chance. Liberty would like to thank Parker for what he did, so Janet takes her to his house and pleads Liberty and Parker's case to Carly and Jack. Lucinda orders Brian to make things right with Luke after his comments, as he agrees to do that. Luke tells Noah about Brian's suggestion and Noah understands. Carly and Jack finally relent and agree to let Parker and Liberty hang out again. Carly and Janet hug when Carly thanks her for looking after Parker, as Jack sees this."

        "Lily: Faith called you, didn't she?",
        "Lucinda: No, nobody called me. I need a favor.",
        "Lily: I don't need you to make me feel useful while the kids are with Holden. Actually, I have got a night filled of romance and drama already planned.",
        "Lucinda: Well, cancel it, Darling, because I've got something better planned. Meet me at Fashions, and I will tell you everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brian: All right, what if we partner up the Luke Snyder foundation with theme parks? You could make the dreams come true for needy children all around the world. Of course, if you had something else in mind --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, that sounds like a great idea. I love it. Don't you?",
        "Noah: Totally.",
        "Luke: That's exactly what I want to do the money. Something like that.",
        "Noah: Isn't it great? This money you didn't even want is gonna help so many people.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I should thank you. You're the one who convinced me to take it.",
        "Noah: Well, I had a little help from Lucinda.",
        "Luke: Well, that is true. So, Brian, I know that my grandmother set you up with an office, but if you need anything, you know, an assistant, staff, just name it and it's yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Wow. It's dead in here.",
        "Jack: For a change.",
        "Janet: All still quiet on the Parker front?",
        "Jack: Laid out the law for him, so yeah, it's working for now.",
        "Janet: I still think it wasn't necessary.",
        "Jack: See, you and Carly have something in common after all.",
        "Janet: Seriously, Jack. Come on. The kids are gonna be starting school soon. They don't have the same classes. They're not gonna be hanging out with the same crowds. I say this thing is gonna resolve itself without us having to lift a finger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Don't you think we should get Liberty up to speed on the plan?",
        "Katie: Better keep her in the dark just so she doesn't get nervous, okay?",
        "Brad: All right, good luck.",
        "Katie: You, too.",
        "Liberty: Hey. Ready to roll.",
        "Katie: Not in that.",
        "Liberty: What? It's Al's with you and Dad.",
        "Katie: What if you run into someone you know?",
        "Liberty: Then I can just tell them that this is the latest prison-wear for teens.",
        "Katie: Very funny. Go change.",
        "Liberty: What's the big deal?",
        "Katie: Okay, I didn't want to tell you this 'cause I didn't want to freak you out. But there have been some paparazzi stalking your dad and me.",
        "Liberty: Really? Paparazzi in Oakdale?",
        "Katie: Fine. Go ahead and get caught with your picture in a magazine with a caption that reads \"Celeb kid don't.\"",
        "Liberty: Okay, fine, I'll change. But if the flash bulbs start popping, don't expect me to smile.",

        "Carly: You want a snack with that?",

        "Parker: I'll pass.",
        "Carly: You know, you can't go the entire day without eating, you know?",
        "Parker: Watch me.",
        "Carly: Hey. What can I do to make this better for you?",
        "Parker: You could help me take off the invisible collar so that maybe I could set foot outside the house without an alarm going off.",
        "Carly: Parker, it's not that bad.",
        "Parker: You're not me.",
        "Carly: You know, your dad didn't say you couldn't go out. Just that you couldn't go out with Liberty.",
        "Parker: Then I don't want to go out at all. Come on.",

        "Katie: Oh, it's probably your dad wondering where we are. Tell him we'll be right there.",
        "Liberty: Home of the strict and the famous.",
        "Parker: Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Parker?",
        "Parker: Yeah, it's me. I'm calling on my mom's phone. My dad took mine away. I need to see you.",
        "Liberty: I can't. It's Parker and he wants to see me.",
        "Katie: Perfect!",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Katie: Perfect timing. You know, if he would have called earlier, he might have showed up here.",
        "Liberty: What do I say?",
        "Katie: Tell him you're going to Al's with me and your dad.",
        "Liberty: And then what if he shows up?",
        "Katie: Well, he'll have to deal with the consequences.",
        "Liberty: I'm going to Al's with my dad and Katie. And my mom's working, so your dad will probably show up.",
        "Parker: They're watching us both like \"America's Most Wanted.\" But don't worry. I'll figure out a way for us to see each other.",
        "Liberty: Parker, no. He's gonna show up. My dad's gonna hit the roof.",
        "Katie: Well, then he'll just have to deal with the consequences.",
        "Liberty: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: Nothing, nothing. Let's go.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "J.J.: Hey, Dude. A sci-fi marathon is about to start. Do you want to watch it with me?",
        "Parker: Close the door. And forget the marathon. First, put this back in the kitchen like nothing ever happened, and then you and I are going to the movies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, just so we're clear, you're gonna show up with a package from the station, and then I'm gonna say, \"Hey, would you like to join us?\" And you're gonna say --",
        "Leo: \"Sure, why not?\"",
        "Brad: And you're gonna sit next to Liberty. Not too close. Just remember, you're supposed to look like you're interested, not be interested.",
        "Leo: No problem.",
        "Brad: All right, okay. Okay, they're coming. Just let us get settled in and then make your move, all right? Wow, you two look great. Little -- maybe too great.",
        "Katie: Isn't that your mom in there?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I'm gonna go say hi.",
        "Katie: We didn't factor Janet into this whole thing. I don't know why. I hope she doesn't screw everything up.",
        "Brad: Don't worry, I made sure that Leo knows it's supposed to look like a coincidence when he shows up.",
        "Katie: So he's ready and willing?",
        "Brad: A little too willing, if you ask me.",
        "Katie: Well, he has to make it look real if Parker is gonna get the message.",
        "Brad: Well, what if he doesn't show?",
        "Katie: Oh, I forgot to tell you. Before we left, he called.",
        "Brad: What? I said no contact.",
        "Katie: Brad, if he didn't call, he wouldn't know where to find Liberty.",
        "Brad: Right, right.",
        "Katie: Stop worrying. Once Parker sees Liberty having fun with another guy, he's gonna walk away and never look back.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Brad: Hello.",
        "Jack: Quiet day.",
        "Brad: Let's hope it stays that way.",

        "Liberty: Whatever. I'm gonna go sit down.",
        "Jack: Parker -- have you heard from him?",
        "Liberty: How could I? You took his cell phone. I'm gonna go to the table.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Brad: Saw you were talking to Jack.",
        "Liberty: Is that against the law, too?",
        "Brad: As long as you weren't talking about Parker.",
        "Katie: I am starving. How about you?",
        "Janet: Well, I know what my little girl wants. She wants a deluxe cheeseburger with extra onions on the side.",
        "Katie: No, no onions, no.",
        "Janet: Excuse me?",
        "Katie: I get killer heartburn even looking at them on someone else's plate.",
        "Liberty: Okay, whatever, weirdo. No onions.",

        "[All talking at once]",
        "Liberty: Mom, make my burger medium-rare, please.",
        "Leo: Mrs. Hughes asked me to deliver this --",
        "Janet: Rare? Are you sure? You know what they say about rare hamburgers.",
        "Brad: Why don't you join us?",
        "Liberty: Mom, I'm not gonna get that mad cow thing.",
        "Janet: You could get mad cow. You never know!",
        "Katie: Stop, stop, stop! Please, sorry. Don't mean to be rude. Liberty, do you remember Leo, our intern at WOAK?",
        "Janet: Hi. I'm Liberty's mother, Janet.",
        "Leo: Nice to meet you.",
        "Katie: Leo was just delivering a package to us. And while you were arguing mad cow with your mother, your father invited him to stay with us. So, isn't that great?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, great. Cool.",
        "Katie: Why don't you sit down right here?",
        "Leo: Excuse me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: Hey, I couldn't put the phone back. She's in there. So now what?",
        "Parker: So now we go to the movies, and you stay back while I hang out with Liberty.",
        "J.J.: But then I'll miss the first two episodes of the marathon.",
        "Parker: Then record it, Geekwad.",
        "J.J.: Okay, listen, you're grounded and you need me, so stop acting like a jerk.",
        "Parker: Fine. You don't have to go. But you just have to get me out the door and then you can sneak back in and watch your lame marathon, all right? I'm going. Hey.",
        "J.J.: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hey. All right, who hit who first?",
        "Parker: No one hit anyone. We're just letting you know that we're going to the movies.",
        "Carly: What about the sci-fi marathon?",
        "J.J.: I can record that later, I guess.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. And what about supper? You haven't eaten.",
        "Parker: We'll grab a hot dog if we're hungry.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'll get my keys.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, we can walk.",
        "Carly: That's a little far, don't you think?",
        "Parker: Come on, Mom. I've been in this house all day.",
        "Carly: Okay. Hold it. No detours, you understand me? Right to the movies and back. And you, you stick with your brother. You promise?",

        "Lucinda: Oh, funny. Well, I need a change.",
        "Lily: I'm all for that.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. I'm getting these two. I don't know about that.",
        "Lily: Would this change have anything to do with your sudden interest in dancing.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Luke, what a mouth.",
        "Lily: He said he's never seen you let loose like that before.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it was a mere bag of shells, Darling. I was just showing the new director of the foundation Oakdale nightlife.",
        "Lily: Hmm. And was the new director impressed?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I think he was. But he's going to be even more impressed by the little dinner that you are throwing in his honor.",
        "Lily: Me?",
        "Lucinda: This evening. And as we will be discussing the foundation business, the boys must be included.",
        "Lily: I am curious. Is this dinner about the foundation or you and Mr. Wheatley?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, that Luke and his mouth. Mr. Wheatley isn't interested in me.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's not what Luke said.",

        "Noah: Well, there's just that paper that I don't want to write, so --",
        "Luke: We're there. Just let us finish up with Brian, okay?",
        "Lily: Oh, ask him if he can come, too. And be sure to tell him that your grandmother will be there.",
        "Luke: Oh, okay. So, Brian, my mom is asking you over for dinner tonight. I think my grandmother is going to be there. She wants you to come.",

        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, right. You're dumping this guy in my lap.",

        "Liberty: Oh, my God, Parker's here. My dad's gonna, like -- oh, the two of you wanted this to happen, didn't you?",
        "Katie: This is your chance, Liberty. You said that Parker was getting too serious.",
        "Liberty: What? I didn't mean hurt him.",
        "Katie: It's not about hurting him. It's just a wake-up call.",
        "Liberty: So, what else did you say you've written?",

        "[Carly is talking to one of Parker's teacher on the phone]",
        "Carly: No. You know, Parker did not give me that orientation schedule, but I would love to donate my time. All right, let me see if I can put my hands on that paperwork, and I'll call you back. Bye. [Carly goes to Parker's room and looks around for the papers.

        "Janet: That's not a date.",
        "Parker: Well, then who is that guy?",
        "Janet: He's just some intern from WOAK. Brad and Katie asked him to sit down. He was there delivering a package. That's all.",
        "Parker: You sure?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Heard it with my own two ears. But that still doesn't mean Liberty's available.",

        "Katie: They went to the bookstore, not Vegas.",
        "Brad: He's a good guy. Don't worry.",
        "Janet: I just feel really bad for Parker. You should have seen the look on his face when he was just watching them sit together.",
        "Katie: I know. I felt bad for him, too. We just thought that maybe if Parker saw Liberty with another guy, he would tone it down a little bit.",

        "Carly: At least someone here has a heart.",

        "Luke: Look, I know. And I'm sorry. I am. It's just -- how can you be okay with this?",
        "Noah: Because it won't change anything between us. I don't want you to quit the foundation because you're afraid it might. When Brian was telling us his ideas, you lit up in a way I really haven't seen you do before. And you can't give that up.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I feel that it took us so long to get to where we are.",
