        "Meg gets her job back at the hospital and her first patient is Emily \u0096 having another mild bout with preeclampsia. Emily goads Meg by demanding having Paul by her side during this. Will and Jade head out on the town and bump into Paul. Paul learns of Will and Gwen's break up and offers Will some unsolicited advice, which falls on deaf ears, or so it seems until the end of the evening when Will explains to Jade why they can no longer see each other. Jade sees Luke with Holden and the new baby, and even ends up holding him. Luke talks to his comatose mother. Maddie claims to have lied about the rape. Margo and Dallas are confused as to whether Maddie is lying about the whole rape or simply about who raped her. Henry is told women sometimes lie about some of the facts of a rape in order to protect someone close to them. Margo speaks with Maddie alone but not before Lewis threatens he, Eve and Henry again. Lewis tells Eve that Maddie has had deep-rooted mental issues for a long time and cannot be believed, which she has ignored for a long time now. Eve pleads with Maddie to open up, but she tells her she just wants to be left alone. Lewis tells the same thing to Henry later but Henry is not biting and stuns him when he declares he is \"looking at the piece of dirt who raped his sister!\""

        "Bob: Well, thanks for meeting me down here.",
        "Meg: No problem.",
        "Bob: Have you seen this? Lucy Montgomery's back on rotation.",
        "Meg: Well, that's great.",
        "Bob: Mm-hmm. Thanks to you. She could have died.",
        "Meg: Well, I was at the right place at the right time.",
        "Bob: Does that mean -- \"aw, shucks, weren't nothing?\"",
        "Meg: Okay, I admit, I was kind of great.",
        "Bob: Well, we can always use that kind of great nurses around here.",
        "Meg: Bob --",
        "Bob: Look, I know this isn't easy to talk about. It's been quite a while since you --",
        "Meg: Since I screwed up.",
        "Bob: Well, yeah. And we have a severe shortage of nurses. And with Lucy you hit one out of the park. If you'd like to come back, I think I can make it work.",
        "Meg: I really want to come back.",
        "Bob: You'd be watched.",
        "Meg: I'd imagine so.",
        "Bob: But I get the feeling that you've learned a lesson.",
        "Meg: Do the words \"by the book\" mean anything to you?",
        "Bob: Yeah. I wanted you to meet me down here because this is where I'd like you to work. I mean, with Lucy, you showed that you could handle critical situations. That is, if you don't have a problem with the ER rotation --",
        "Meg: No problem. No problem. I like it. It will be wonderful to be back. It would be wonderful to work for you.",
        "Bob: By the book.",
        "Meg: Yes, I promise.",
        "Bob: Terry, I got you some help.",
        "Nurse: Meg?",
        "Meg: I've been reinstated.",
        "Bob: Listen, you can go right back to work if you want. I'll go down to human resources and do all the paperwork. Do good work.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Hey, Terry.",
        "Nurse: Look, I have a burn patient who needs me, so why don't you start by processing these med reports.",
        "Meg: Welcome home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Dr. Stewart. My mother. Please --",
        "Nurse: Ask her.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Please, somebody help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, unless you have to have that lasagna again tonight, I say we stay here and eat. Great steaks, great seafood --",
        "Luke: Actually, Dad, if you don't mind, I'd like to get to the hospital as soon as possible.",
        "Holden: Okay, no problem.",
        "Luke: Yeah, \"no problem.\" I just messed everything up, and I don't even know if she can hear me.",
        "Holden: Luke, you didn't mess anything up. It's like I told you, your mom -- she can hear what we're telling her, so it's important for her to hear your voice, know that you're okay.",
        "Luke: Why didn't I just listen to you?",
        "Holden: Because you can't accept that I'm always right about everything all the time. But it's okay as long as you know that now.",
        "Luke: You know what, I really hate you.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: When I went to places like this with Lily and Holden, they were always so friendly to the waiters. I thought that was really sophisticated.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Jade: You know, even though you did bring me here to spite your mom, we could at least pretend to have some fun. At prices like this, it would be a sin not to.",
        "Paul: Hey, Will. Hi. I'm Paul Ryan, I'm his big brother.",
        "Jade: Jade Taylor.",
        "Paul: Great to meet you. So -- where's Gwen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, did you hear me? You need to tell us who hurt you. Come on, Maddie, you've got to.",
        "Maddie: I don't know. I can't remember.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, which is it? You don't know or you don't remember?",
        "Maddie: You're confusing me.",
        "Margo: Well, then why don't you explain it to us. Tell us what you mean.",
        "Maddie: I blanked out when it happened. I can't remember details.",
        "Margo: But it did happen, that much is true?",
        "Maddie: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it didn't even happen at all!",
        "Margo: Maddie, are you saying that you lied?",
        "Maddie: I'm confused. You're confusing me.",
        "Margo: Maddie, you tell me that you were raped at a frat party that never happened. You can't just say that you were confused.",
        "Henry: You didn't lie, Maddie. You wouldn't lie about something like that. You wouldn't, would you?",
        "Eve: Did you just make up the frat party? Why?",
        "Louis: Maybe we should all stop shooting questions at her. Detective, I can't see that these tactics are getting you anywhere.",
        "Margo: These are not tactics. And I'm not the one who needs to get somewhere. Now, I have all the sympathy in the world for anybody who has been raped. But Maddie, you tell me that you were at a frat party that never happened, so we know now that that much of your statement is untrue.",
        "Maddie: I had to say something.",
        "Margo: Why was that?",
        "Maddie: Because of what I did to Lia's car. And then everyone was asking me what happened in Chicago -- and you had thought that I'd -- you know --",
        "Margo: So you just went along with it?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.",
        "Dallas: Maddie, you're the only one that knows what happened. Okay, I was there. I saw how upset you were. You didn't look like you were making it up. You looked like someone that was terrified. Now what are you trying to do? Are you just trying to say you made it all up?",
        "Maddie: I made it all up.",
        "Henry: Oh, Maddie!",
        "Eve: Oh, my God!",
        "Margo: Maddie, we have got to be really, really clear here, because it is beginning to sound like you not only lied about being at the frat party, but you lied about being raped?",
        "Henry: For God sakes, why?",
        "Maddie: It's like everyone says -- my imagination just runs away with me. And, I don't know, when I get really stressed. And I'm really stressed right now. I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: I don't believe this.",
        "Henry: How could you let us believe something like this?",
        "Margo: You know what, you know what? I believe at least some of what Maddie is saying. I believe that you are really stressed right now, right? And you can't quite keep things straight, can you?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Margo: I think that maybe there are too many people in this room. I think maybe that you feel you got too many people that you have to answer to.",
        "Maddie: Maybe.",
        "Margo: Yeah, and I think maybe it should be just you and me.",
        "Louis: No!",
        "Margo: No, no, it's okay. We've talked alone before. We're really good, talking alone, just the two of us.",
        "Henry: She doesn't talk to the cops without her family or a lawyer present.",
        "Eve: Yeah, look what you've done to her already!",
        "Margo: I think we need to look at what she's done. I don't want to threaten you, baby, but you have to know that you are in serious trouble, right?",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Margo: Yeah, and I can't really be of any use to you if I walk out of here and I don't know exactly what did happen and what didn't happen.",
        "Henry: Margo, Margo, Margo, she's worn out.",
        "Louis: You're trying to railroad her.",
        "Margo: Sir, if I was trying to railroad anybody, I would leave this room right now and I would let the interview stand on its own. That won't help her. And I want to help.",
        "Maddie: She's right. Really, I think it's a good idea. I want to talk to Margo alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So Mom sent you, right?",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Will: Everyone in town knows about me and Gwen. So you just bump into me so you can report back in to headquarters or whatever --",
        "Paul: I don't know what you're talking about. What about you and Gwen?",
        "Will: I'll quote Gwen. \"It's over.\"",
        "Paul: I didn't know. I'm sorry.",
        "Jade: You know what? I think you two need some privacy. It was very nice meeting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Mr. Snyder, hi.",
        "Holden: Hey, Jade.",
        "Jade: Luke, what are you doing here?",
        "Luke: Hey, Jade.",
        "Jade: I thought you were off to Malta. Nothing happened with Lily? Is she all right?",
        "Luke: She's fine -- I mean, everything's the same.",
        "Jade: Oh, and your other father? He's still --",
        "Luke: He's alive. But, point of reference, I've only got one dad. That guy there.",
        "Jade: Oh, so I guess Damian wasn't who he said he was?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Jade: Oh. Well, at least things are back to normal. You know, you guys always had the father-son thing pretty down. Wow, he's so beautiful. What's his name?",
        "Holden: We haven't named him yet. We're waiting for Lily to wake up, and then we're going to do it.",
        "Jade: Could I hold him? Just for a second, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Just hang in there. It may not be as permanent as you think it is.",
        "Will: It is according to Gwen.",
        "Paul: What I'm saying is that even though Gwen is really angry and says things are over, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are.",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Paul: So you should probably avoid screwing up any chance you have of getting things back on track. And not spend time with drop-dead gorgeous girls like Jade, at least not in public, if you know what I'm saying.",
        "Will: Oh. Marital advice from the expert.",
        "Paul: I'm just saying --",
        "Will: I don't even know why you care.",
        "Paul: I know that you're still very much in love with Gwen. And I would like the two of you to be happy.",
        "Will: Is that why you used her? Just the way you used every woman you ever met?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: Working. We need to get you on a gurney.",
        "Emily: You don't work here. You were kicked out of here.",
        "Meg: I just started. Look, you need to relax, okay? It's very important that you calm down.",
        "Emily: How am I supposed to calm down when I have you hovering over me?",
        "Meg: I'm trying to help, I'm a nurse.",
        "Emily: You are a nurse with no badge. You were kicked out of here. I saw you looking through records before. You were trying to steal records again. Were you trying to steal my records?",
        "Meg: Emily, this is not good for the baby.",
        "Emily: You don't give a damn about my baby!",
        "Meg: Okay, just listen to me. It looks to me like your pre-eclampsia has flared up.",
        "Emily: Well, then call my mother!",
        "Meg: I will. First, we need to get you stable. If you lie down, you'll feel less panicky, so why don't you --",
        "Emily: Don't touch me! Of course I'm panicky, I'm dealing with you.",
        "Meg: Do you have a pain in your arm? You're rubbing it.",
        "Emily: Just stay away from me, okay?",
        "Meg: You know, if there was anybody else here, I would. But your high blood pressure could cause a seizure. You're putting yourself and your baby at risk.",
        "Emily: I love this baby.",
        "Meg: Then do it for him. Okay, let me get you to a cubicle, you can lie down. I'll take your blood pressure, I'll call your mother. For the baby's sake!",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay, on one condition.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Emily: Don't call my mother. Call Paul.",
        "Emily: You were lying, weren't you?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Emily: You said you'd call Paul.",
        "Meg: Emily, we need to get you stable. You're going to get yourself all worked up again.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you know what, I get worked up when people lie to me. When I'm deliberately kept from the father of this child.",
        "Meg: Well, there's no need.",
        "Emily: That's not your decision, is it? You'd like it to be, but it's not.",
        "Meg: You're going to play this for all it's worth, aren't you? This isn't about your health, or the baby.",
        "Emily: You want to analyze my motives? How about this? You don't want to call Paul because this entire situation plays on your many, many insecurities.",
        "Meg: This situation is making me wish to God that there was another nurse available.",
        "Emily: You are insecure -- you are insecure you wouldn't even risk having Paul even see me like this.",
        "Meg: Emily, I'm trying to do my job. This isn't --",
        "Emily: You're trying to keep me from Paul is what you are trying to do. Because I am lying here, I am helpless, I am at your mercy.",
        "Meg: Like a barracuda's helpless?",
        "Emily: You know what, why don't you just think down the road, when I report your behavior to the hospital.",
        "Meg: I'll get you the forms.",
        "Emily: And I call Paul and I tell him what you did. How I was scared for my child, how I wanted to talk to him, but you said no. How do you think he's going to react to that, Nurse Snyder?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure, you can hold him.",
        "Jade: Thank you.",
        "Holden: Here you go.",
        "Jade: Hi.",
        "Luke: It's kind of funny. I never pictured you as the baby-holding type, Jade.",
        "Jade: You have a very sarcastic older brother who thinks he's much smarter than he is.",
        "Luke: She's right about that.",
        "Jade: But he is a great big brother, you're very lucky. I know that things don't feel very lucky right now. And I want you to know -- I hope its okay -- I pray for Lily every day.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Jade: You should have your mother. I know how hard it can be.",
        "Maitre d': Here you are, sir.",
        "Holden: Great, thank you. Tell Lisa I'll have these back to her in the morning, okay?",
        "Maitre d': Certainly.",
        "Holden: All right. Yeah, we should get going.",
        "Jade: Okay, here.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Jade: Thank you so much.",
        "Holden: All right. We'll see you soon.",
        "Jade: And call me.",
        "Luke: I will. Bye.",
        "Jade: Bye.",
        "Luke: Dad, that was really classy.",
        "Holden: I guess I'm just a sucker for people who like my kids.",
        "Luke: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not proud of the way I treated Gwen, but we worked it out. And we moved on.",
        "Will: Moving on. That's one of your best events.",
        "Paul: Well, I thought that you and I were doing better.",
        "Will: So that gives you the right to pass judgment? I like Jade, Jade and I are friends, and you know what, it's none of your business.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine. Subject is closed.",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Paul: So you think the Sox are going to go all the way?",
        "Will: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Paul: No, I'm changing the subject, like you said, okay?",
        "Will: Let's talk about you. How's your girlfriend? How's your pregnant ex- wife?",
        "Paul: You really want to talk about me? I miss Jennifer. And my life is really messed up right now, and I was kind of hoping to spend some time with my little brother who I'm pretty sure is going through the same stuff right now.",
        "Will: Yeah. It's rough.",
        "Paul: It is. It's really rough. For both of us.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Which is why it's probably not a really good time to be making big decisions, or little decisions, for that matter.",
        "Will: You just couldn't leave it alone, could you?",
        "Paul: Well, what if Gwen walked in?",
        "Will: We're in this together, we're brothers. But it's funny how you're still the one with all the answers, telling me what to do, what to think. But, you know what? It's my life and I'll do what and I'll see who I want, and there's nothing you can say about it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: This is the perfect time for me to just say good-bye.",
        "Jade: I hope Paul didn't upset you.",
        "Will: No, didn't bother me one bit. And like you said, tonight, we're going to have a really good time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So I think you should get down here.",
        "Paul: Is the baby all right?",
        "Meg: The baby would be fine if your ex-wife would grow up and stop acting like a lunatic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, so, if we could just have some time.",
        "Louis: Are you really sure we should leave this decision up to Maddie?",
        "Henry: You heard what Margo said.",
        "Louis: What she said could be construed as a threat.",
        "Henry: Don't you think, after what we just found out, that we should do everything we can to get to the truth? Maddie, Honey, this is what you want, isn't it?",
        "Maddie: It's fine.",
        "Margo: Good, good. Now, I have to talk to Officer Griffin for a minute, but just settle down, relax. I'm not going to go after you. We just need to talk.",
        "Maddie: Right.",
        "Margo: Right. Okay, so what's your take on this?",
        "Dallas: That she lied about the party, obviously. But the rest? I don't know.",
        "Margo: Henry.",
        "Henry: Hi. I just have to ask -- do you really think that she -- she doesn't remember? Margo? Margo, I'm leaving you here with her, I'm trusting you. You don't buy that she doesn't remember, do you?",
        "Margo: No. But sometimes the \"I don't know\" scenario is just the victim protecting someone. Someone she knows.",
        "Henry: Someone she knows.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Can you help me out here, Henry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Louis: Did you think you were being smart, Maddie? Being clever?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Louis: Because up to now, you've been a pretty good girl. You're going to stay one, aren't you? Aren't you?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Louis: What's private is private. Like what we have between us. You wouldn't want your brother or sister to get hurt, would you?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Louis: Good. I knew I could trust you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Paul: Emily, I thought I could trust you, but I guess I was wrong.",
        "Jade: We'll just watch TV or listen to some music.",
        "Will: I'm going home.",
        "Maddie: There was no party.",
        "Margo: You lied about the party. Did you lie about everything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Louis: Henry. I didn't know you were there.",
        "Henry: I know.",
        "Louis: I thought you and Eve were going downstairs.",
        "Henry: Well, we thought you were going down, too.",
        "Louis: I just wanted a private word with Maddie.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Louis: Yeah, I just thought it was important that she knows that no matter what happens, whatever she tells Detective Hughes, that we'll all be there for her.",
        "Henry: I never really understood what that meant. \"There for you.\"",
        "Louis: Well, I know that Maddie knows what I mean. Don't you? Shall we go downstairs? I'll buy you a drink.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'll join you in a minute. I need to have a private word with Maddie. Let her know that I'm there for her.",
        "Louis: I wonder if there's any situation where you wouldn't make one of your jokes.",
        "Henry: Is he right, Maddie? Do you know what he meant?",
        "Maddie: I guess.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I guess you knew. Do you want to tell me anything? I'm sure you've caught on to the fact that most people don't think my promises amount to much. But I can promise you this -- I will never let anything bad happen to you because you tell Margo the truth. I promise that.",
        "Margo: Maddie, you ready?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Henry: I love you, kid.",
        "Maddie: I love you, too.",
        "Margo: Okay, Maddie, it's time you told me the whole truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, what's going on? Is the baby okay?",
        "Meg: I told you on the phone, the situation wasn't critical.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but Emily's in ER, and -- what are you doing here?",
        "Meg: I got my job back. I got my job back and my first patient was Emily.",
        "Paul: She's all right? She's not critical.",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: That's good. You got your job back.",
        "Meg: Yeah, we covered that.",
        "Paul: That's great. No, that's great. You're happy.",
        "Meg: Very.",
        "Paul: Okay. Then I'm happy. Even though the first words out of my mouth were, you know, all about the baby.",
        "Meg: Paul, I know you're happy for me. And the baby is fine, so you don't need to worry.",
        "Paul: You said Emily's a lunatic. Did she just make the whole thing up?",
        "Meg: No, no, she had a pre-eclamptic episode.",
        "Paul: How bad?",
        "Meg: Well, the doctor said it was minor, but it's always serious.",
        "Paul: Did it harm the baby or not?",
        "Meg: The doctor checked the fetal heartbeat. It was strong, normal. But --",
        "Paul: But what?",
        "Meg: First of all, this wasn't the greatest situation, given that Emily has to stay relaxed and my very presence seems to set her off.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Meg: Look, Paul, I tried, I really tried -- but I didn't do very well in the calming her down department.",
        "Paul: Meg, it's not your fault. Emily could get Mahatma Gandhi to punch her.",
        "Meg: Thank you, but we're not just talking about tonight. Pre-eclampsia means she's constantly vulnerable to high blood pressure and panic, both of which can be triggered by stress and extreme emotion. I mean, she needs to stay relax for her whole pregnancy. Her mental state is important.",
        "Paul: We're all in trouble if her mental state is important.",
        "Meg: Even now, she's refusing more treatment. And before, she asked me to give you a call, and I didn't thing that was a good idea, but now -- I don't know, maybe you could get through to her. Calm her down so we can treat her?",
        "Paul: Me?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I can try.",
        "Meg: She's right here.",
        "Emily: Oh, good, Paul, you're here.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Emily, I thought I could trust you. But I guess I was wrong.",
        "Meg: Did you miss the part where I said we needed her calm?",
        "Paul: Could you just give us one second together, please?",
        "Meg: Okay. Call me if you need me.",
        "Emily: How could you talk to me like that?",
        "Paul: Shh. That baby that you are carrying is our child.",
        "Emily: You think I don't know that?",
        "Paul: And that child is dependent on you and I. And he or she has needs way bigger than you or me or any of our feelings or any stupid thing that we think.",
        "Emily: You walked in her and said that you didn't trust me.",
        "Paul: Well, I can't, apparently. Because I thought that you and I had an agreement.",
        "Emily: We do.",
        "Paul: Emily, you came here because something was wrong, you knew something was wrong. And then as soon as Meg said something to you, your common sense just flies out the window.",
        "Emily: So that's my fault? Whatever Meg does is right, you just take her word for it?",
        "Paul: This is not about right or wrong. You have to do what your nurse tells you to do, whether or not you hate that nurse or not. For the baby, Emily. For our baby.",
        "Emily: You're right.",
        "Paul: I am right. There's something else that I'm right about. You can do this, Emily. You can. And you love this baby enough. When you calm down and you think about it, from then on, you will do what's right. No matter what Meg or anybody else says, you won't let anything change that.",
        "Emily: You're right. I can do this.",
        "Paul: So from now on, I can trust you?",
        "Emily: It's just easier when I know I can count on you.",
        "Paul: Of course you can count on me.",
        "Emily: Like the other night when I was so worried about the newspaper, and you came over and we worked on it together. I felt so much better. You just made me feel like things were going to be okay.",
        "Paul: Everything is going to be okay.",
        "Emily: And if I can count on you, I can stay calm, like I'm supposed to. I know that. I got so upset before because Meg wouldn't call you. She doesn't understand that this is important to you, too.",
        "Paul: Emily, I told you, this has got nothing to do with Meg.",
        "Emily: I know, I can see that now. See, if I know that I can call you when I need you -- I've go nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: It's kind of hard being as wrong as I was. And I was such a jerk. I knew everything, didn't I? Damian is this great guy, and you're trying to change who I am. Mom, I'm so sorry. I know why you came to me that day -- the day that you fell. And I need you to wake up so that I know that you forgive me. I grew up, Mom. I'm not so stupid. I can be a better son --",
        "Emma: No. No, you couldn't. Sweetheart, you are a good son, the best you can be, and she knew that. She knows it now. Don't put yourself down, she wouldn't like that.",
        "Luke: Do you think she'll wake up?",
        "Emma: I'm praying that she will, Luke.",
        "Luke: Me, too. I think she will. No, I know that she'll wake up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, I don't want to scare you, but here's the bottom line. You are a viable suspect in a multiple homicide investigation. The stakes are incredibly high. Now, you told us that you were raped, and we have subsequently proven that at least some of that statement was untrue. Now, that in and of itself is a criminal offense. So Maddie, I wanted to get rid of everybody so that you could have a chance to tell me the truth. And I'm not stupid, Honey. I know that there are a million and one reasons that you felt you had to lie. But I also know that there is a good explanation, and I need to hear that explanation now. And more than that, you need to give me that explanation, or else you suffer the consequences, deserved or not.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Margo: I know this isn't easy for you. You take your time. But for your own sake, tell me the truth.",
        "Maddie: There was no party. I lied.",
        "Margo: You lied about the party. Did you lie about everything? You know what, Maddie, I've done this before. I've been around a lot of women who have been raped, and I know that they lie. They lie about the circumstances, the location, the details. They lie because they're trying to protect someone. Sometimes it's because it's the rapist they care about. Sometimes they're afraid of the rapist. You can understand that, can't you?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Margo: That's got to be some kind of hell. And the only way out of that hell is to tell the truth. You're a smart girl, Maddie. You know what I'm talking about. And I know you're scared, I know. I understand, believe me, I do. But like I said before, you're simply running out of time. Don't take the fall for this guy. You're too good for that.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Margo: Good girl. You're going to be okay. You just trust me.",

        "Maddie: I'm really tired.",

        "Margo: You're not going to let me in, you're not going to let me do this, are you?",
        "Maddie: No. So can this be over now, please?",
        "Margo: No. I mean, I can leave -- I can walk out of here -- baby, it's not going to be over until you tell somebody the truth.",

        "Louis: She was lying.",
        "Eve: About being raped -- its worse. It means there's something wrong with her, really wrong, to lie about that.",
        "Louis: We will get her the help she needs. Finally.",
        "Eve: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Louis: This isn't the first time I've said this. Maddie's problems aren't recent. It's just that now they're dramatic enough to get your attention.",
        "Eve: Don't say that.",
        "Louis: This could be a cry for help. Or maybe she simply can't help but lie.",
        "Eve: You know, it's been long enough. I'm going up.",
        "Louis: Eve. We need to be strong. We have to do whatever it takes to help her.",
        "Eve: Of course.",
        "Louis: I'm just worried. I'm worried that things are going to get worse. Cornered like this -- who knows what she's going to say next.",
        "Eve: Look at you. You couldn't care more if she was your real sister. Henry, Louis is really upset. You'll keep an eye on him, will you?",

        "Will: Jade, I told you, we can't do that anymore. It's not right.",
        "Jade: Come on, we're both currently unattached, what's the problem? It's just like you said to your brother, it's your life, you can do what you want to.",
        "Will: And I said to you --",
        "Jade: Okay, well look, I don't want to pressure you to do something you don't want to do. We can just watch TV or listen to some music. Whichever.",

        "Meg: Great.",
        "Paul: What's wrong with you?",
        "Meg: I heard some of that. You really know how to handle her.",

        "Meg: And are you handling me, too?",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",

        "Holden: You don't think I know that?",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, I think you know that. I'll tell you what else I think. I think you've done an incredible job with that young man in there. You got him through a really, really tough time.",
        "Holden: No, no, Lily and I, we did that together.",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, you did. You do have a faith that everything's going to be all right, don't you?",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "Emma: Well, I don't know -- I think in order to keep that faith going, you should probably do what Lily would want you to do and -- I think Lily would want this little fella to have a name. It's time, Holden.",

        "Margo: I thought I did. I thought I did. I thought I was so close. But then I said something and she went away.",
        "Dallas: You think that she figured out that rape supplies motivation for the murders? That if she denies the rape, she's not a suspect?",
        "Margo: Whoa, that's way too thought out. She's not plotting, she's just reacting. Or else she's the best actress in the world.",
        "Dallas: Do you think she wasn't raped? That she's not the Slasher? What?",
        "Margo: I think we need to get passed the idea that if we solve the rape mystery we'll solve the Slasher case. The murders could be about something else entirely. Come on.",
