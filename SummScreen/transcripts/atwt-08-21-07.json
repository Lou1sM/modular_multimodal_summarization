Jack is worried and upset, but Katie just thinks he needs to focus on his kids right now. After Jack leaves, Brad thinks she is making a big mistake. Katie thinks she is making a grown up decision to trust Jack. A distraught Allison tells Dusty about the video and he vows to make Cheri pay, which he later publicly and loudly tells Cheri the same. Aaron calls Allison, but she doesn't pick up because she thinks he is calling to pass judgment. Gwen and Will talk about their future with the baby.

        "Maddie: I don't really that think Luke has --",
        "Colonel Mayer: So whatever you were going to say about Noah, you should be willing to say directly to him -- or to me.",
        "Maddie: You know, we should find Noah, Colonel Mayer.",
        "Colonel Mayer: And I think we will do that, Maddie, right after we're done talking to -- Luke, is it?",

        "Katie: I'm so sorry. I should have waited. You need to spend time with your kids.",
        "Jack: I need time with you, too. I didn't even give you a decent proposal. I asked you to marry me, and then I disappear.",

        "Carly: No, I think we should do this.",
        "Jack: No, Carly, bad idea.",
        "Carly: Why? The sooner that J.J. puts this all behind him, the better off we are. Besides, Jack, so many people prayed for us, they helped search for him. Shouldn't we thank them?",
        "J.J.: Are we going to be on TV?",
        "Jack: What do you think about that?",
        "J.J.: Well, kids in my class are going to ask me stuff, so why don't we just do it?",

        "Reporter: How does it feel to be home, J.J.?",
        "J.J.: Better than Christmas. Better than anything.",
        "Carly: I suppose it might seem unusual for a divorced couple to get along so well, but when it comes to our children, Jack and I are definitely a team.",
        "Jack: What kept me going? I'd have to say Carly did. Yeah. She never, ever gave up hope.",
        "Carly: Seeing our family back together. That's the best part.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey -- where are you going? We're almost done here. I thought we could hang out later.",
        "Katie: I don't want to take you away from your kids tonight.",
        "Jack: Well -- am I going to see you later?",
        "Katie: I'm going to run and get some research from Brad. And then I'll be home.",
        "Jack: Katie \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Dad, give Luke a break. We're all working on this project together. He was probably just going to vent to Maddie about what a tyrannical director I am. Right?",
        "Luke: No. That wasn't it.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, then what was it? Don't leave us in suspense.",
        "Luke: Look, I didn't want to make a big deal about it. That's why I was talking to Maddie first.",
        "Maddie: About what?",
        "Luke: I think Noah may have lost the master for the series we've been doing.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, then why didn't you go directly to Noah?",
        "Luke: Because Maddie's my friend, too. And this affects her.",
        "Maddie: Oh, you know, if our boss found out that the tape was missing the first person she would come to would be me, because it's my area. I could check it out.",
        "Noah: No, it's my mistake. I'll take care of it. Thanks for letting me know, Luke.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'll come with you. I'd like to see what kind of work you're doing. Learn more about it.",

        "Luke: I'm trying to be.",

        "Luke: Is he like that with everyone?",
        "Maddie: Not so much me. And he's really trying hard with Noah to understand that he wants to be a director and not a soldier.",
        "Luke: Maddie, are you really going to move in with Noah?",
        "Maddie: Well, when he first brought it up, I was kind of freaked out. But now that I'm thinking about it -- don't you think it's a good idea?",
        "Luke: Are you in love with him?",
        "Maddie: I could be. I like him a lot. And we can talk for hours about movies and work and school.",
        "Luke: That doesn't sound very romantic.",
        "Maddie: But it is. And he gets me. And he looks out for me. And it's like he'd give me anything that I wanted.",
        "Luke: At least he would try.",

        "Sofie: Okay.",
        "Aaron: I had every reason to throw that laptop across that room. I was lucky I didn't throw his butt across the room.",
        "Sofie: You want to talk about it now?",
        "Aaron: No.",
        "Sofie: Okay. I'll wait.",
        "Aaron: You know, you've really got to stop doing that. Being so nice to people all the time. Letting people push you around.",

        "Sofie: The customer knows Alison?",

I want to be there for her, I want to tell her that -- Ali and me, we -- we always kind of mess up being together. And I want her to know that I'm there for her -- I just, I really don't know what to do anymore.",

        "Alison: Everybody's watching us.",
        "Dusty: So, what? What is it?",
        "Alison: What was all this for? What was the point of saving me in Vegas, keeping me from making movies, and killing myself with drugs when what really destroys me, destroys us, is the one mistake we made together?",
        "Dusty: You lost me. I don't know what you're talking about.",

        "Jack: That's why I'm here.",
        "Katie: Jack, you shouldn't have come.",
        "Jack: Come here for a second. The way you took off earlier -- what's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing. I was just thinking, with everything's that's happened, with you and the kids, you need time to regroup.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you and I. We need time to regroup, too. We have a wedding to plan.",

        "Jack: That is absolutely ridiculous. The fact that I love you and you love me that overrides everything else.",

        "Maddie: All right, I better go talk to Noah and see if he found the backup. Are you heading home?",
        "Luke: No, I got some writing to do. I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Luke? What did you mean before when you said that Noah would try to make me happy?",
        "Noah: Crisis averted.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I am so relieved. I did not want to re-shoot any of that stuff.",
        "Noah: Me neither. Especially when you did it perfectly the first time.",
        "Maddie: You're just biased.",
        "Noah: And the problem with that would be?",
        "Maddie: Did you get to see any footage, Colonel?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know what? Maddie, I could not make heads or tails of what Noah was doing. But maybe you two can explain it to me over coffee.",
        "Maddie: Sure, sure. Luke, do you want to come?",
        "Luke: No, no, no. I've got to finish writing. So, I'll see you guys tomorrow.",

        "Gwen: Wait a minute. You honestly think that in that moment, I would be that selfish?",
        "Will: Gwen, the girl needs help. That's obvious.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Why does it have to be you? Look, I feel just as bad as you do about what happened to Alison.",
        "Will: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything about you being jealous.",
        "Gwen: No, it's okay. 'Cause it's kind of true.",

        "Dusty: I'll take care of it.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm going to track down the person who put it up, and I'm going to make them put it down.",
        "Alison: Cheri. It had to be her.",
        "Dusty: Now, why do you say that?",
        "Alison: Because she kept making snide comments to me, and I didn't know what they meant then, but I do now.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'll fix it.",
        "Alison: It's out there, Dusty. Even if we pulled it off that one site, Cheri could just post it on other sites. And keep reposting whenever she felt like it. So, that all of these people, these millions of people, will think I'm a slut.",
        "Dusty: It doesn't matter what they think. I never should have touched you.",
        "Alison: That doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what we felt, or what I was going through. All they see is me, naked, performing in front of a camera, not caring who sees. They'll think we taped it. That we're proud of it.",
        "Dusty: Hey, that night, you were hurt and you needed me. That doesn't make you a bad person.",
        "Alison: But all those people --",
        "Dusty: Those people -- those people are going to see what they see. What matters is what you believe about yourself.",
        "Alison: Here's what I believe. When you were in that room, I knew Emily cared about you.",
        "Dusty: Emily and I were just friends. At that point we were friends.",
        "Alison: I knew she wanted you, and I slept with you anyway. So all those people who are watching that video and deciding I'm an awful person, I agree with them.",
        "Dusty: No, don't beat yourself up about it.",
        "Alison: Why? Because then I might just give up, and go get high?",
        "Dusty: You're thinking about it?",
        "Alison: I'm tasting it. I want it like my next breath.",
        "Dusty: But you're not going to do it, are you? Promise me.",
        "Alison: I get why my mom started drinking again.",
        "Dusty: Hey -- Alison.",
        "Alison: Everybody makes being sober sound like the answer. Like that'll make things right. But it doesn't. All the mistakes I made -- doing porn, sleeping with you, cheating on Aaron -- I keep having to deal with them over and over. And it hurts. And I want it to stop hurting. I just want it to stop.",

        "Katie: No, Jack --",

        "Katie: You can't force me into the family. You can't rush that on the kids!",
        "Jack: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Katie: Well, then that's why we have to do this. If we want any shot at making our marriage good, we have to put those kids first. Always. Oh, I'm sorry!",
        "Jack: Ignore it. Don't go.",
        "Katie: I have to go out of town. It's the only way I can keep my hands off you.",
        "Jack: We're setting a date.",
        "Katie: The minute I get back.",
        "Jack: Is this about Carly?",
        "Katie: I trust you.",
        "Jack: Good. Then trust that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Trust that. I'll drive you to the airport.",
        "Katie: I'll get myself to the airport. You get back to the kids. And get well. When I get back, you can pick me up from the airport. Take me home --",

        "Katie: I trust Jack.",

        "Katie: The research, please?",
        "Brad: What do you mean, by \"Grown-up relationship?\"",
        "Katie: It's not about wanting, or even loving, the other person. You decide. You decide to be faithful. You decide to put faith in them. You decide to make a promise and keep it.",

        "Aaron: No, no. Dusty wouldn't send out the video. He's got nothing to prove, and plus, he wouldn't hurt Alison that way. He just wouldn't. Somebody else is messing with Alison. And it's probably her old boss.",

        "Sofie: When she's ready, I mean. You know, first I would cry it out, then I would figure out what to do next. And that's when I would want you to be there.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but I can help her now.",
        "Sofie: You already have. You left a message. You let her know you're here for her. I don't know about Alison, but if it were me, for tonight, that's all I'd need from you.",
