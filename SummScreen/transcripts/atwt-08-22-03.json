        "Paul demanded to know Dusty's intentions toward Jen, then taunted Dusty and Rose. Dusty got angry, and started to manhandle Paul. Rose called the police, fearing one of them would get hurt. Margo arrived, but Dusty convinced her to let them off with a warning. Dusty was angry that Rose didn't stand up for him to Margo, but agreed to keep Jen away from the grand opening. The \"James\" in Paul's head continued trying to convince him to get revenge on Dusty. Bob was only able to communicate by blinking, but still managed to tell Hal that Rick is the killer. As Hal searched for Rick, Rick made plans to meet Susan at a remote motel, saying he was having another panic attack. Alison talked her way into getting into Rick's safety deposit box. Inside, she found a gun, Nurse Krebs's diary, a vial and syringe, and small souvenirs from each of the victims. Just as Chris realized that Alison had left the hospital without him, Rick arrived at the bank, and was stunned to hear that his \"daughter\" was there looking through the box. He asked to be taken to her. Craig tried to tell Rosanna that he didn't want another child, but couldn't bring himself to break her heart. However, the visiting social worker informed them that, despite Rosanna's impeccable credentials, Craig would never be allowed to adopt."

        "Paul: You gonna answer your girlfriend there, Dusty? 'Cause she asked you a question. What are you gonna do about Jennifer? And that is -- that is what you said. Isn't that right, yes, no? Okay, I'll take that as a yes. She's curious. Come on. Can you satisfy her? Or are you not in the satisfaction business anymore? I mean, it's not like Rose was ever really hard to satisfy.",
        "Dusty: Rose is none of your business. And I suggest you keep your mouth shut and take a walk.",
        "Paul: Well, she didn't tell you. You didn't tell him? Rose came to see me, Dusty. Yeah. She wanted me to bury the hatchet. So here I am. I brought my hatchet. So, now, where do you want me to bury it? Because what I'm thinking is maybe right between his eyes.",
        "Rose: You had an opportunity to talk to me, and you chose not to, so please just get out of here. Dusty and I are having a private conversation.",
        "Paul: Yeah, about my sister. So who you working for this time, Dusty? Or is this job just, you know, freelance?",
        "Rose: What are you talking about?",
        "Dusty: Don't talk to him, all right? Please.",
        "Paul: I mean, Rose here, she was a willing volunteer. But I want to know, what makes you think that you can use my sister and get away with it?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I'm sure it helps that Cabot Enterprises gave millions of dollars to charities last year, but the fact that an adoption agency responded within the same day can only mean one thing.",
        "Craig: They're polite?",
        "Rosanna: They have babies! [Craig groans] So they're sending someone over?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, today. Isn't it wonderful? I mean, I've heard horror stories about how long it can take to adopt a child. So once you said yes, I wanted to get the process started right away. [Craig groans] We haven't talked to Lucy.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Lucy, you know her. I mean, once she hears how much you want a child, she'll be all for it.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh.",
        "Rosanna: Mm, you have to shave.",
        "Craig: Oh, when is this person arriving?",
        "Rosanna: This person is a social worker, and she will be arriving within the hour. Why, is there a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Havelock: I'm sorry for your loss. But there's really nothing --",
        "Alison: My father, he was a wonderful man and a wonderful doctor. Some people even called him a saint. So when he gave me this key to his safety deposit box, he made me promise that I would open it.",
        "Ms. Havelock: And we will, dear, as soon as the executor of the estate obtains a court order.",
        "Alison: But that'll be too late. I promised Daddy on his deathbed that I would get his bible out of his safety deposit box.",
        "Ms. Havelock: He kept his bible in the bank?",
        "Alison: Yeah, 'cause -- it was very old. It was like an antique or whatever. I guess that he didn't want anything to happen to it. It was his mom's, and he promised her that he would take it to his grave. And now he's dead.",
        "[Alison cries]",
        "Ms. Havelock: Let me see what I can do. I'll just have to file these papers -- this is odd. If Dr. Eric Decker is your father, then why is your last name Stewart?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker : Can you believe Bob's awake?",
        "Rick: You said it was a miracle, and you're right. There's no other word for it.",
        "Ben: Bob, can you move your hands, your fingers?",
        "Kim: Sweetheart, do you think you can squeeze my hand? Can you do that? Don't worry about it. Honey, the important thing is you are awake and you're here, and oh, we've missed you so much.",
        "Nancy: Just be patient, son. It will all come back to you.",
        "Hal: Ben?",
        "Ben: Hmm?",
        "Hal: I hope you understand that I have to ask this, but do you think he can answer some questions? We need to find out what he knows about these murders as soon as possible.",
        "Chris: How can my father answer questions when he even can't speak or move his hands?",
        "Hal: That's what we're trying to figure out, Chris. Now, if there was some way that Bob could signal --",
        "Ben: Nobody is gonna figure anything until John and I do a thorough examination.",
        "John: So if you'll excuse us, everybody. This is only gonna take a couple of minutes. We just want to make sure that Bob is stable before we do anything that might set him back.",
        "Kim: Absolutely. Honey, we'll be back in a few minutes.",
        "Walker : After you, Dr. Decker.",
        "Kim: Hal, I realize how important it is for you to talk to Bob, but I can't have him overwhelmed.",
        "Hal: I understand that, Kim. And I will abide by whatever Ben and John determine. But you have to understand something. If what I believe is true, that Bob knows who committed these murders, Kim, he is in grave danger.",
        "Chris: Hal's right, Mom. The sooner Dad tells us what he knows, the safer he'll be.",
        "Rick: It looks like all of our prayers have been answered.",
        "Nancy: I knew he'd wake up as soon as he was ready.",
        "Rick: Well, I'd caution you not to pressure him too much. After all Bob has been through, we wouldn't want to precipitate a setback or put too much trust in what he says. He could be confused, even delusional --",
        "Nancy: I'll go along with what his doctors say -- Ben and John. They'll know what's what.",
        "Rick: Yes, of course. [Pager beeps] oh, that's me. Never a dull moment. My thoughts are with you. Would you tell Kim that I'll -- I'll check back later and see how Bob's progressing.",
        "Kim: How did it go?",
        "John: Well, although Bob hasn't regained his speech, and that may take awhile yet, he is alert, he is stable. Hal, if you would like to ask him a few questions -- and by a few I mean no more than five minutes --",
        "Hal: Understood, John. Understood.",
        "John: He'll respond by blinking his eyes, if that works for you?",
        "Hal: More than I'd hoped for, thank you.",
        "Kim: I'd like to be present.",
        "Hal: John?",
        "John: I have no objection as long as everyone's --",
        "Nancy: Five minutes tops. We know Bob needs his rest.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Walker : Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Rick is gonna be fine. Bob is gonna be fine. Everybody's gonna be fine. Now they'll call me if -- if anything changes. Oh, Bob. Bob, please wake up. Please wake up. You have to tell everybody that Rick is innocent.",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why is my last name different than my dad's? Well, because -- because I'm a newlywed. Um, Daddy didn't approve at first, because we were so young. My mama would've been here herself, but she had an emotional collapse. The doctors sedated her, but -- but because of her heart problems, they -- they didn't know what to do. So -- so that's why I really need to get to that box. My dad, he wrote my mom a letter -- a love letter, just in case that he died before she did. Isn't that the most romantic thing you've ever heard?",
        "Ms. Havelock: It's lovely.",
        "Alison: So that's why I really need to get to that box. Before my mom's heart goes out, or she does something to herself. Please, there has to be something that you can do to help me.",
        "Ms. Havelock: You're a brave girl. Let's go get your dad's box.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, your timing is kind of a problem. I had some business this afternoon.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I went looking for you. I went all the way over to Java Underground, where, may I add, I made a rather unfortunate discovery. I found your business partner bribing the electrical inspector.",
        "Craig: What?!",
        "Rosanna: Yes. That's illegal, you realize that?",
        "Craig: Well --",
        "Rosanna: It could cost you your liquor license, my investment and any chance that we have of adopting a child.",
        "Craig: I'll talk to Dusty.",
        "Rosanna: You will?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: We're gonna have a baby. Oh, do you realize that? Our very own baby.",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- Rosanna, we really have to talk about this before this social worker person arrives --",
        "Rosanna: No, no, we can work out all the details later. And do you realize how happy you've made me? Nobody's ever done anything like this for me before. I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You stay away from my sister.",
        "Dusty: Well, you got to reign her in, pal. 'Cause she doesn't like to take no for an answer, you know?",
        "Rose: Oh, that's it! I can't take it anymore. You two just back up --",
        "Dusty: Just step out of the way for a second, would you, please?",
        "Rose: No, I'm not going anywhere until you two start acting like grown-ups.",
        "Dusty: Your sister came to me with a business proposition, pal. She offered to give me a bunch of hotties, a bunch of her models for my opening night. And in return, I'm grateful.",
        "Paul: And that's it? Okay, I know that interest rates are low, but that is a ridiculous rate of return.",
        "Dusty: Whatever, I'm not really interested.",
        "Paul: You're not really in -- the man with a plan is -- is not interested! Why do I not believe that?! Because I know you. I know you, Dusty, and I know how you operate! I mean, remind me, Rose. I've forgotten. Isn't that how this whole thing started? You two, you're talking business, right before he talked you right onto your back.",
        "Rose: You let him go or I'm calling the cops! Let him go!",
        "Dusty: I want an apology.",
        "Paul: I think your girlfriend's calling the cops. [Paul laughs] I don't know a lot, but I think that might affect your application for a liquor license.",
        "Dusty: What are you looking at? Get back to work. You got work, right?",
        "Rose: Uh, yeah, the Java Underground. 97 1/2 Washington Street --",
        "Dusty: Its okay, the police won't be necessary. The situation is handled. Thank you and sorry.",
        "Rose: They're still gonna send somebody, you know that?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, and whose fault is that?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Careful. Careful, careful. Or I'll start to believe that the only reason you threw your arms around me is because I agreed to adopt. [Rosanna laughs] you wouldn't love me any less if I hadn't agreed, would you?",
        "Rosanna: But you did. Come on, I know you're still a little skittish about the idea, and I understand why. Bryant. And you're probably still a little nervous about playing games of horsy at your advanced age. But don't worry; I've seen you in action. I have no fears on that score.",
        "Craig: Well, perhaps you'd better not confide the particulars in your faith to this social worker person?",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Why? Scared of a little old social worker?",
        "Craig: No, I don't want to scare her. But don't mind me.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. This is not good. I've done something wrong. I've made you feel like I don't trust you. And I do. I do, especially now. I mean, I got up the nerve to tell you how much I needed to have this child, and you were terrific. You were absolutely terrific. You said that you understood. You agreed to support me. Even though I know this child isn't as important to you as it is to me --",
        "Craig: You are important to me. I just wish I didn't have to prove it all the time.",
        "Rosanna: But you did. This is gonna to be wonderful, don't you see that? Don't you see how happy we'll be, Craig?",
        "Craig: I want you to be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Havelock: Just put the box on the table. There we go. Here. After all those tears, you don't want to get dehydrated. Have some water. It'll make you feel better.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much, ma'am. You're so sweet. But if I could just be alone with my dad's things?",
        "Ms. Havelock: Oh, of course.",
        "Alison: I knew it. Nurse Krebs's journal. He really did this. Rick is the serial killer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Bob, I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Now they're just yes or no questions. And what you're gonna do is you're gonna blink once for no and twice for yes. Do you think you can manage that? Good. Now, first of all, I know everybody here wants to know how you're doing. Are you -- are you okay, everything considered? [Kim laughs] Oh, honey, we're so glad to have you back.",
        "Hal: As the doctors have told you, Bob, I'm sure, you've been in a coma for several weeks now. Now, during that time, the investigation into the serial murders has continued. I wish I had better news for you, but the case is still open, and we're kind of hoping that you can help us out here.",
        "Kim: Actually, honey, you were trying to tell us something just before you collapsed.",
        "Chris: Now, when you came to, you tried to tell me, remember? He remembers.",
        "Hal: Bob, Nurse Krebs kept a diary. Now that diary was in your possession before you were attacked. The diary is missing now. Did you read anything in that diary that indicated that Nurse Krebs knew who the killer was? Yes. Good. And did the same person attack you? Yes.",
        "Walker : Was it Dr. Gordon? Once. That's a no. It wasn't him. Was it Rick Decker?",
        "Hal: Did Nurse Krebs name Rick Decker, and did Rick Decker attack you after he found out that you knew his secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: He's gonna break your heart.",
        "Dusty: He's gonna break your -",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Or else we could take this discussion downtown?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Havelock: Your daughter was just here, with your death certificate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Now, now. Don't fight on my account.",
        "Rose: Oh, stop. Please, just stop.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you listen to the lady and get out of here.",
        "Paul: Rose, if what you wanted was to be with a chest-thumping hairball, why didn't you just stay in Atlantic City ? [Rose groans] No, no, no. That's it! Enough! I've had it!",
        "Margo: All right, line 'em up and cuff 'em, all of them.",
        "Dusty: There's absolutely -- absolutely no problem here.",
        "Margo: Absolutely no problem? That's why dispatch got a call? I could hear you guys up on the street.",
        "Dusty: Well, this is a bar. I got construction going on here.",
        "Margo: All right, are you two wasting my time here, or am I gonna find a body in the back room or something?",
        "Rose: I made the call, okay? Dusty and Paul were going at it, and I thought one of them was gonna get hurt.",
        "Margo: Okay, Paul, speak now or forever pay your lawyer.",
        "Paul: I -- I called him a hairball, and he didn't like that.",
        "Margo: A hairball?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't know. He's very sensitive about his hair.",
        "Dusty: Get this punk out of here.",
        "Margo: Yeah, Paul, I think you should leave now. Say good night.",
        "Paul: He's going to break your heart.",
        "Dusty: He's gonna break your --",
        "Margo: Or else we could take this intense discussion downtown? Rose? Rose?",
        "Rose: What?",
        "Margo: How did this get started?",
        "Rose: It's hard to say.",
        "Dusty: Paul Ryan comes to my place of business, which is now closed for renovations, and he accuses me of hitting on his sister, which is totally stupid.",
        "Margo: Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer! Jennifer's been sweating me. He doesn't want to believe it, so he starts working in on my girl. That's it. Tell her.",
        "Margo: Rose?",
        "Rose: Sorry?",
        "Margo: Did Paul deliberately provoke Dusty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: He blinked twice.",
        "Hal: That's a yes.",
        "Walker : I knew it was Decker.",
        "Hal: Where's Decker now?",
        "Chris: He was here when Dad woke up.",
        "Nancy: He was in the hall. I was talking to him just a little bit ago, and he got a call on his beeper and had to go.",
        "Walker : Damn it, we can't lose him.",
        "Hal: John --",
        "John: I'm on it. Yeah, security, this is Dr. John Dixon. I want all the doors and the entrances to the hospital closed and secured. I want all the personnel -- this is an emergency -- looking for Dr. Rick Decker. And approach him with caution. He is dangerous.",
        "Chris: Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: And here we go! Whoa, over the threshold!",
        "Susan: You'd better put me down before you slip a disc.",
        "Rick: Oh, would you indulge me, wife.",
        "Susan: I'd love to, husband.",
        "Rick: Well, I promised you a honeymoon if you came with me to Florida .",
        "Susan: But Hawaii ? Oh! It was wonderful.",
        "Rick: No, no, no. It was fabulous!",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Susan: Oh, don't answer it.",
        "Rick: No, it may be the family.",
        "Susan: Oh, okay.",
        "All: Surprise!",
        "Susan: What's this?",
        "Emily: Well, we never had a chance to officially celebrate your wedding, Mom.",
        "Alison: So we want to make it up to you.",
        "Hal: And we're sorry for any doubts we had about Rick.",
        "Rick: Oh, please, Hal. You were just doing your job.",
        "Alison: Mom, can I move back home?",
        "Emily: Alison, we want Mom to be happy!",
        "Susan: Oh, but I am. I'm so, so happy! I'm so happy.",
        "Chris: Here we go. Now how about one of the whole family? Rick, that means you.",
        "Rick: Are you sure?",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "All: Oh, come on, come on!",
        "Rick: All right, everybody smile.",
        "Chris: Say cheese!",
        "All: Cheese!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Susan: Oh. Hello?",
        "Rick: Honey?",
        "Susan: Rick, what's wrong? You sound like you're out of breath.",
        "Rick: Well, yeah, I'm a little overexcited. Bob woke up.",
        "Susan: That's marvelous.",
        "Rick: Well, hey, it's a miracle. But right now my heart is racing, and my mind is all over the place",
        "Susan: It sounds like another panic attack. Where are you?",
        "Rick: I'm not sure. I just had to get out of there. I couldn't have them see me like this.",
        "Susan: Just come home.",
        "Rick: I can't. If Emily or Alison were there --",
        "Susan: Then I'll come to you.",
        "Rick: Thank you, sweetheart. I'm out past Luther's Corners. I'm out on route 57. Do you know the motel there? I think it's called the Lonely Pine.",
        "Susan: Um, okay. I'll be right there.",
        "Rick: Oh, thank you darling. Oh, and please, don't tell anyone.",
        "Susan: No, darling, of course not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You killed her, Rick. You killed Nurse Krebs, then you stole her diary. Stanley Crumley? You stole his ring? Myrtle Scott's bookmark. Gordo's name tag. You killed them, and then you stole their stuff for souvenirs? It's disgusting! Oh, my God.",
        "Rick: Excuse me. I need to get into my safety deposit box, but I seem to have lost my key.",
        "Ms. Havelock: Do you have identification?",
        "Rick: Yes, of course. The name is Decker -- Dr. Eric Decker.",
        "Ms. Havelock: I'm sorry, what did you say the name was?",
        "Rick: Eric Decker.",
        "Ms. Havelock: That's impossible. I'm sorry. Your daughter was just here, with your death certificate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh! Oh, you look wonderful. Oh, stop that! How do I look?",
        "Craig: Like a mother. Which takes most women about nine months. [Rosanna laughs] Or longer if you decide to adopt, I know.",
        "Craig: Exactly right. This could take years. We have to expect a long wait here.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, all right. She'll be here any minute, all right? Don't choke on your cookie.",
        "Craig: Where exactly is this agency?",
        "Rosanna: It's the best agency in the region. I should show you the website -- Better Babies.",
        "Craig: You found it on the internet?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and Better Babies is the best.",
        "Craig: Well, what, just because they have a snazzy website? Any fool with a wallet can get a snazzy website.",
        "Rosanna: Darling, breathe.",
        "Craig: This is not good. We are moving much too fast in this, Rosanna --",
        "Rosanna: Don't get your knickers in a twist, all right? I put my best people on it. I had the entire Cabot Research Department scout every agency in the region, and this one is the best. You don't have to worry, okay? [Doorbell rings] oh, there she is. All right, this is it. Behave?",
        "Craig: Don't I always?",
        "Rosanna: Well, hello. So nice to meet you. Thank you, please come in. My husband and I have been so anxious to meet you.",
        "Ms. Easton: Oh, yes, it usually takes several weeks before we can meet prospective parents.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we very much appreciate you moving us into your schedule.",
        "Ms. Easton: The director and I felt it was only fair to meet with you as soon as possible.",
        "Craig: \"Only fair\"? What do you mean, \"only fair\"?",
        "Rosanna: Ms. Easton, this is my husband, Craig Montgomery. Craig, this is Ms. Easton.",
        "Craig: Oh, a pleasure.",
        "Rosanna: Craig has a lovely daughter, Lucy. She's almost all grown up. He is such a wonderful father.",
        "Ms. Easton: You have a lovely home.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you. We like it.",
        "Craig: Perhaps Ms. Easton would like a tour?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's a great idea. I should show you upstairs. We've picked out a room for the baby. It's full of sun --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Tell her what happened. Go ahead. Tell her Paul came in here looking for a fight.",
        "Rose: Paul came in here looking for a fight.",
        "Margo: And go on.",
        "Rose: And Dusty gave him one.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to press charges, he's not pressing charges. I don't think we need to write any of this up --",
        "Margo: All right, well, a call came into dispatch --",
        "Dusty: Nothing happened.",
        "Margo: And I have got to make a report.",
        "Dusty: All right, Margo, you know I'm starting a business, and I'm trying to make friends. The last thing I need is to be enemies with the police. I don't need that.",
        "Margo: Well, you should have thought of that before you let Paul get under your skin.",
        "Dusty: Well, is there any way you can give me a break? I mean, your brother is a partner of mine --",
        "Margo: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't hear that. Neither did you. This is the last time I'm letting you off the hook.",

        "Rick: But I'm not dead.",

        "Rick: Did you let her have my safety deposit box? If anything is missing, I will hold this bank responsible.",
        "Ms. Havelock: No, no, no. No, sir, nothing is missing. She's still here.",
        "Rick: She's still here?",
        "Ms. Havelock: Yes. Yes, examining the contents of the box. Would you like me to call the police?",

        "Rosanna: Have you had a chance to look over our preliminary application?",
        "Craig: We'd be happy to answer any questions.",
        "Ms. Easton: You must understand that we make every effort at Better Babies to ensure that every child is going to a perfect home.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, of course.",
        "Ms. Easton: We have reviewed the materials you've submitted and done some checking of our own. And we've learned that Ms. Cabot, or should I say Mrs. Montgomery, has impeccable credentials, both professionally and personally. Rosanna, we are certain that you would make a wonderful mother.",
        "Rosanna: There's nothing I would like more.",
        "Ms. Easton: Which is why it pains me to tell you that, given what we've discovered about your husband, Mrs. Montgomery, I'm sorry, but your husband will never be permitted to adopt.",

        "Dusty: What?",

        "Dusty: Yeah.",

        "Imaginary James: Right, you fail. You fail miserably, and then you take it out on your sister. Words with Donovan. Sounded like a 9-year-old with a thesaurus.",
        "Paul: Just get out of my head.",
        "Imaginary James: You'd better listen to the voice in your head. At least, you wouldn't be cursing your sister if you did. And at least she has the guts to stand up to your enemies. Now you listen to me, Paul. You've lost your fianc\u00e9e. If you're not careful, you're going to lose your sister, too. Now quit acting like a child. Attack Donovan .",
        "Paul: If I do that, then Rose is just gonna run to his defense.",
        "Imaginary James: Not if you're clever. He's a gambler, he's an opportunist. You bait him, he'll bite. And when it's all over, Rose and Jennifer will see him for exactly what he is -- a charming, seductive, parasite.",
        "Paul: If they haven't seen that already, I --",

No, he's not a complainer, so if he says something, you got to pay attention. Well, what's his blood pressure? Um, that's a good call, but I'd -- I'd up it by half.",
