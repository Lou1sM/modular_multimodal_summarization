        "Acting much like that both woke up on the wrong side of the bed, Katie and Brad have problems in filming their segment at WOAK. Kim asks that they clean up their act otherwise there will be no audience. Brad and Katie take a break, but end up arguing about Liberty. Brad apologizes and admits he wants Katie in Liberty's life as he is not the cool dude he pretends to be. At the school car wash, Parker and Liberty have to put up with the adults who insist on being there to dog their every move. Carly makes a snarky remark about Janet bending over and showing off her assets. A water fight ensues just as Katie and Brad arrive. Brad is definitely not happy that he was left out of the loop and that the kids can be together as long as an adult is always present. Soon a larger water fight is under way involving all the adults. Carly comments to Jack that they are not setting a very good example. Parker and Liberty sneak off and end up back in her apartment. He wants to know if she was in on it to make Leo get Parker to back off. They are caught kissing by Janet who sends Parker on his way. She tells Liberty that she is afraid she will make one of her mistakes. Parker is expecting a lecture, but Jack tries to be cool. Liberty tells Brad that she got along without a dad for a long time and she can again. He's a good dad, but just needs to lighten up.",
        "Paul reshapes the truth and tells Meg that the project is okay and back on track. She's mainly concerned about the baby. They get very good news that the toxins did not affect the baby. Emma calls and insist that Paul come over as that man is demanding his money. She is also worried about Meg and warns Paul to protect her from more stress. Alone, Meg has bad cramps but is helped by Derek from the Snyder project. He insists on driving her home which upsets Paul when he returns home. Paul threatens him not to come near his wife again and Derek scoffs at this saying he is in no position to make threats."

        "Katie: Today, we're going to be taking a look at what kids will be wearing this fall so all you moms and dads out there don't have to be totally lame when you hit the stores. I remember back when I was in school, the best part about going back was the clothes -- the only good part. What about you, Brad? Did you have a favorite special outfit for the first day?",
        "Brad: Jeans and sneakers for me, Katie.",
        "Katie: Cool. Wow. What a dramatic fashion statement.",
        "Brad: You know, I really don't see why it matters.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because we're doing a segment on back-to-school fashion.",
        "Kim: Okay, cut. Which one of you two got off on the wrong side of the bed this morning?",
        "Brad: I thought that was going well.",
        "Kim: Really? Really? I think the only thing going will be the audience, to some other channel. We need some banter, some -- I don't know -- sparkle, signs of life.",
        "Katie: Okay. We'll do it from the top, and we'll be good.",
        "Kim: Terrific. Okay. Stand by. And action.",
        "Katie: Today, we will be looking at what kids will be wearing when they go back to school. I remember when I was in high school, it was so important to make a statement the first day. What about you, Brad? Did you, um, have a particular outfit you liked to wear? Did you care at all what you wore?",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Didn't you want people to think you were cool?",
        "Brad: Well, I was on the football team. Everybody knew I was cool.",
        "Katie: Right. But wasn't there, you know, a particular look you were going for?",
        "Brad: Not really.",
        "Katie: Right, right. Way to sparkle. So sparkly.",
        "Brad: You know what? If you don't like my answers, why don't we get an intern to explain it to you?",
        "Katie: Why don't you take your football and stick --?",
        "Kim: Okay, cut, cut! Are you two just having a bad day, or is the honeymoon finally over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I'm out. I'll be at the car wash.",
        "Carly: Hang on a second there.",
        "Parker: I told you about it, remember? We're raising money for the after- school sports program.",
        "Carly: Yes, Honey. I know what the car wash is for.",
        "Parker: So, is there a problem?",
        "Carly: Mm, no problem.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: Everybody ready?",
        "Parker: For what?",
        "Jack: Car wash.",
        "Parker: Oh, I don't need a ride.",
        "Carly: We're going with you.",
        "Parker: Oh, you got to be kidding.",
        "Jack: No. No, we're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay, good. Oh, yeah. Grab a water. Don't get dehydrated. Everybody, there's cookies here, okay! Cookies! Keep up your strength! Hi.",
        "Liberty: Wow. Are you gonna check everyone's blood sugar, or can we please end this embarrassing Mom moment? Hi.",
        "Janet: Well, I'm just trying to help.",
        "Liberty: Okay, you want to help? Go home.",
        "Janet: Liberty, I know why you're here.",
        "Liberty: It's a real mystery, Mom. Whoa.",
        "Janet: Uh, yeah. Cleaning without a reward -- I don't think so.",
        "Liberty: It's a -- it's a fund-raiser for the, um, sports program.",
        "Janet: Okay. The last time you were interested in sports was when you tried out for the soccer team. But then you found out you'd have to sweat.",
        "Liberty: Okay. All right. Fine. If you're so smart, you tell me why I'm here.",
        "Janet: You're here to see Parker.",
        "Liberty: Wrong.",
        "Janet: Uh, uh, uh. Don't lie to me, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Okay, Mom. I didn't think it was a big deal. He had my back with the Leo thing. Oh, come on. It's not like we're gonna have hot, sudsy sex on the dirty towels.",
        "Janet: Oh, please don't tell me you're watching late-night cable again.",
        "Liberty: He blocked it. I'm down to animal channel and cartoons.",
        "Janet: Well, good for him.",
        "Liberty: All right. First off, this is not about TV. And second off, this conversation's over.",
        "Janet: All right. Go ahead. Back to work.",
        "Liberty: Okay. You will be heading home.",
        "Janet: Okay. First off, we have a deal. And second of all, I'm here to make sure you stick to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know the deal. You can't see Liberty without an adult present.",
        "Parker: We're washing cars, which, by law, have to be driven by adults. Besides, I don't even know if she's gonna be there.",
        "Carly: Parker, you're lucky that we're even letting you go after that stunt you pulled with J.J.",
        "Parker: You're right. I'm sorry for launching that boy into a life of crime.",
        "Jack: Parker --",
        "Parker: Okay, you know what? Fine. Let's just go. It's probably gonna be over before we get there.",
        "Carly: Charming. You know, I -- I do have this covered. If you have someone else to do, I -- I totally understand.",
        "Jack: I'm free.",
        "Carly: Janet working?",
        "Jack: No, no. She's gonna be there, too.",
        "Carly: How romantic.",
        "Jack: Yes. Every man's dream date. So if you have something else you need to do --",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no. I wouldn't miss this for the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Harder, harder, harder. Scrub harder. Wow.",
        "Liberty: Thought you were on hydration patrol.",
        "Janet: I'm just trying to help. After all, the sports program means so much to me.",
        "Liberty: Oh. You can drop that now, please. Hey, you never told me what Dad said about me seeing Parker.",
        "Janet: I -- I didn't?",
        "Liberty: No. Is he cool with the whole adult-supervision feature?",
        "Janet: Oh -- don't worry about it.",
        "Liberty: Mom, you didn't tell him.",
        "Janet: Well, not yet, but --",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God, Mom! He's gonna go Incredible Hulk on us.",
        "Janet: Listen to me, all right? Don't worry about your father. I will handle him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We're just having some problems with Liberty.",
        "Kim: You're kidding? She's a teenager. What else is new?",
        "Brad: What's new is that some people think the only way to deal with other people is to come up with crazy schemes that end up backfiring.",
        "Katie: Like you weren't in on it.",
        "Brad: I knew it wasn't gonna work, Katie.",
        "Kim: Okay. We've already lost an intern over this. If you two can't leave this at home, I'm gonna find a new pair of anchors, preferably total strangers.",
        "Katie: We're okay. We're okay.",
        "Kim: You're sure?",
        "Brad: Absolutely, yes.",
        "Kim: All right. Let's take it from the first model. I've lost the will to go on. Stand by. And action.",
        "Katie: Our first outfit is for the studious girl who still wants to be asked to the dance. This look is from the New City Girl line, and it is perfect.",
        "Brad: Especially if you want your daughter to be accepted at Hooker U.",
        "Kim: Cut!",
        "Katie: Brad --",
        "Brad: You know what? I'm sorry. Please, can I ask you a question? Can I just ask you a question? How -- would your parents let you walk outside like that?",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no, no. No, wait. I have a better question. Would they hire a bodyguard to make sure you didn't grow up?",
        "Model: Um, no, but they did have my boyfriend arrested once.",
        "Brad: When was this?",
        "Model: About a year ago, when I left them to start my modeling career.",
        "Katie: I rest my case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mike, I don't care what he read in the papers. I have paid every bill on time. You tell him, he delivers within the hour or I will sue him.",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Paul: I can't pay you back the full amount. Who comes up with that kind of money on a moment's notice?",
        "Derek: You, if you know what's good for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm in here.",
        "Meg: What's wrong?",
        "Paul: Nothing. Everything's fine.",
        "Meg: Look, I know you're worried. So am I.",
        "Paul: No. There's nothing to worry about. Really, it's like I told your mom. Project is back on track.",
        "Meg: I wasn't talking about the project. I was talking about the baby. What if, uh, Decker's toxin did some kind of damage?",
        "Paul: This baby's gonna be happy and healthy and have you as a mother. Baby's gonna be better than just okay.",
        "Meg: I hope so.",
        "Paul: I know so. We're married. We're having a baby. What could be wrong with this picture?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Meg: Hello. Speaking. Uh -- all ready? Uh, uh, yeah. We'll -- we'll be right down. That was Dr. Schiller's office. They've got the results.",
        "Paul: Great. Great. Once the tests confirm what we already know, then we're gonna have to tackle our real problem, like what are we gonna do if it turns out that this kid looks like me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Mm. Honey, Honey, you want to see your reflection in that chrome. Go on.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Do you just want to show me how it's done?",
        "Janet: Mm. Heck, no. You know I don't wash cars -- not since Peoria.",
        "Liberty: Oh, that dude that cornered you in the gift shop?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Then fired me for spraying him down with the power nozzle.",
        "Liberty: Whoa.",
        "Janet: What an -- hey. Good -- good job. Hey, I need some more cookies. I need more cookies and some water here! Um, keep polishing, Baby. Keep -- good job. Aah!",
        "Parker: I'll see you.",
        "Liberty: Ah, hello. Nice of you to stop by.",
        "Parker: Sorry. I had to wait for my police escort.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God. Uh, we have a lot of catching up to do, Tough Guy. I want to see your reflection in that bumper. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I admit it. I was wrong. Making Parker believe that Liberty was with Leo was a huge mistake.",
        "Brad: Try disaster.",
        "Katie: Brad, I am sick of fighting with you! Liberty is fine! Nothing happened! She's not dating Parker! Can we just let it go?!",
        "Brad: You know what?! That is so easy for you to say! She's not your daughter!",
        "Katie: Right. My mistake for in some way thinking that maybe she was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: You've made it.",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Janet: Yay! Oh -- hi, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi, Janet.",
        "Janet: You guys ready to pitch in?",
        "Carly: Uh, well, actually, I was thinking maybe this would be one of those times that I take a hands-off approach to parenting.",
        "Janet: Jack, want to get wet?",
        "Jack: Oh -- I think I'm in Carly's camp.",
        "Janet: All right. You're missing out. Okay.",
        "Liberty: Whoa. My God, Mom. What are you doing?",
        "Janet: I'm helping out.",
        "Liberty: But I thought you said that you wouldn't --",
        "Janet: Shh, shh. Come on. You need help from a professional. And, after all, this is for a good cause.",
        "Carly: That's an interesting technique.",
        "Jack: Can you cut her some slack, please?",
        "Carly: I'm your ex-wife, Jack. Mocking the women you date is part of my job.",
        "Liberty: Mom, Mom, it's not gonna work, unless you're looking to score with the entire varsity hockey team.",
        "Janet: Oh, zip it. You're no fun.",
        "Liberty: Can you spell \"Clueless\"? The only one worse than her is my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You don't think I don't know that I'm not Liberty's mother? You don't think I feel like a fifth wheel every time Janet's around? I'm sorry. I've never done this before. I was just trying to help. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. But you know what? I'm done. So send Liberty off to a convent or whatever you want to do. That's fine. But I'm done fighting with you.",
        "Brad: Yeah, okay. I didn't come in here to fight with you. I just came in here to tell you something you may not be aware off.",
        "Katie: What's that?",
        "Brad: You married an idiot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Jack: It's been a long time since I've seen Parker smile.",
        "Janet: I know. Same thing with Libby.",
        "Carly: They look so innocent.",
        "Janet: They are innocent. Which is why we should let them go ahead and see each other? If we forbid it, it's just gonna make things worse.",
        "Jack: I'm surprised Brad got on board when you told him.",
        "Janet: Oh -- let's not talk about Brad, okay? It's such a beautiful day. Why ruin it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Liberty needs you in her life.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: 'Cause you -- she needs you to teach her how to be a smart, sane, adult woman, because she is not gonna get that from her birth parents.",
        "Katie: Hey, don't sell yourself short.",
        "Brad: How could I not, considering that my daughter -- our daughter -- hates me.",
        "Katie: No, she doesn't.",
        "Brad: She's got every right to. I mean, Katie, I tried to be, like, this cool and laid-back guy, but I just care about her so much, I cannot pull it off.",
        "Katie: So why don't you tell her that?",
        "Brad: She not gonna listen to anything I have to say!",
        "Katie: So we'll go talk to her together. We'll tell her how sorry we are that we got her in trouble.",
        "Brad: You think that will work?",
        "Katie: And we'll tell her that we love her and we're proud of her for being mature enough to know that not seeing Parker is the right thing to do.",
        "Brad: That is so much better than your other plan.",
        "Katie: Little bit. No more fighting.",
        "Brad: No more fighting, with anyone. Kim, we are going to the car wash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: There's no sign that the toxin had any effect on the baby. Everything points to a healthy fetus.",
        "Paul: See? I told you.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Of course, we'll keep a close eye on you both during the course of the pregnancy, just to be safe. If you have time, there's another test I'd like to run right now.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Of course I have time.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Great. Then I'll be back.",
        "Paul: This is good news.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I know. Uh, I'm so happy. I'm so excited. I -- I can finally let myself believe that we're having a baby!",
        "Paul: You're gonna be such a great mom.",
        "Meg: Oh, and you're gonna be such a great dad.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'm not so sure. I mean, given the role models I had growing up --",
        "Meg: I've seen you with Parker, and I've seen you with Faith. This kid is gonna be one lucky kid to have you as a dad.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: Hello.",
        "Emma: Paul, you have to come over. There's a man here. He says he won't leave until he gets his money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: What are we doing here? We're way behind on our fund-raising target, so we need to wash more cars.",
        "Parker: Would you like us to go out and steal you some?",
        "Girl: No. I want you to go down to the art room and make posters to put around town, okay?",
        "Liberty: Instead of washing cars? Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Parker: I love art projects.",
        "Liberty: Yeah!",
        "Parker: Okay, see, this is good, because I need to talk to you about something, alone.",
        "Liberty: About what?",
        "Parker: Stuff.",
        "Liberty: Whoa. Sounds urgent.",
        "Parker: It is.",
        "Jack: Hey, Guys. Where you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: I mean, what's going on here? Who is this man?",
        "Paul: Can you put him on?",
        "Emma: He's at the work site. I told him to talk to, uh -- to Mike. Did I do wrong?",
        "Paul: No, not at all. But you know what? I'm on my way, and I'll deal with it.",
        "Emma: Deal with what? Is there a new problem?",
        "Paul: No. Um, not to worry. Everything is completely under control. I got to head out to the farm and check on something. Can we move this test you're supposed to have till tomorrow?",
        "Meg: I'll stay. I want to get it done.",
        "Paul: Uh, h -- how are you gonna get home?",
        "Meg: I think I know my way home. Uh, I'm fine. I'll take a cab.",
        "Paul: Okay, great.",
        "Meg: Again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Carly, do you mind if I ask you a quick -- eh, forget it. You know me. I'm just gonna ask away and let the chips fall where they may.",
        "Carly: I hadn't noticed.",
        "Janet: Are you and Jack really over? Because I like him, a lot, and I don't like to steal fruit from another girl's orchard.",
        "Carly: Jack told me that you don't want a commitment.",
        "Janet: Not yet. I don't know where we're headed. But I'd like to go along for the ride.",
        "Carly: Well, in that case, Janet, don't worry about the orchard. That fruit's been picked.",
        "Janet: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Thanks for asking.",
        "Jack: Changed my mind. I think washing cars can be fun for all.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Parker: You're really never gonna let us out of your sight, are you?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, that's the plan.",
        "Liberty: I, for one, can't wait for gym class.",
        "Janet: Well, we need more rags.",
        "Carly: Uh, and more cookies.",
        "Liberty: Well, here we are. Oh, my -- hey!",
        "Parker: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Liberty: Oh, no, you're not. You are so -- you're so gonna pay. Oh, my -- I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna --",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Brad: What the hell are you guys doing?",
        "Liberty: Oh.",
        "Brad: No, wait. What are you doing?",
        "Liberty: We were just fooling around.",
        "Brad: Yeah. I can see that. Parker --",
        "Liberty: Dad --",
        "Brad: You're really pushing me, man.",
        "Liberty: Dad -- we weren't -- we weren't doing anything wrong.",
        "Brad: Well, except lying and sneaking off together.",
        "Liberty: Okay, its broad daylight, and we weren't sneaking around. Besides, we have permission.",
        "Brad: From who?",
        "Liberty: From them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where is he?",
        "Emma: He's right here. He's waiting. This is, uh -- I'm assuming you know each other. I don't know. Paul Ryan, this is Mr. MacDougal. He's from the, uh, Acme Carting Company.",
        "Paul: This is who you called me about?",
        "Emma: Yes. That's right.",
        "Paul: Acme Carting? You're the clowns who pulled our credit.",
        "MacDougal: That's why I came out here in person, Mr. Ryan. And my boss won't let our trucks roll without a deposit. And I thought if I picked it up myself, you can avoid any further delays.",
        "Paul: Thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. How much do you need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: It's okay. It's -- I'm fine. It's -- its normal. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.",
        "Derek: Miss, are you all right?",
        "Meg: I don't know!",
        "Derek: Tell me what I can do to help.",
        "Meg: Uh, thank you.",
        "Derek: Wait here while I get someone.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. It was just muscle spasms. I -- I overreacted.",
