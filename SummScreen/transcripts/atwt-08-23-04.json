        "Mike: He's playing a song. That's all. He'll be okay.",
        "Carly: How does he know it? That wedding in Montana must seem like a lifetime ago to a kid.",
        "Mike: Kids remember things you'd never expect them to. Besides, he's been thinking about Jack. The song probably popped up in his head.",
        "Carly: Mike, he doesn't read music. He's never had a lesson in his life.",
        "Mike: So maybe he's got good ears. I don't know. You have a budding virtuoso on your hands. It'll be okay. You want me to call Hal or Holden to come and get you? I hate the idea of you going alone to the church.",
        "Carly: No, no. No, I'll be fine. I'll be home as soon as I can. Okay?",
        "Mike: Take your time. You need this.",
        "Carly: No, I don't need this. This service was not my idea.",

        "Jack: You're saying all the right things, Julia. But come on, you're a nurse. You gotta be thinking, \"this guy should be remembering more by now,\" right?",
        "Julia: I'm really not, Jack. There are no rules.",
        "Jack: I look in the mirror and I don't know who that guy is looking back at me. What kind of person he is.",
        "Julia: He's a good guy.",
        "Jack: Yeah? You're sure about that?",
        "Julia: I am. Yes. Some things can't be erased. I can see it in your eyes, Jack, the way you are with JJ.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay. Julia, if I'm such a good guy, why is nobody looking for me? Have you thought about that?",
        "Julia: Yes, I have. And, you know, you -- you could be on vacation, and they don't even know you're missing yet. Or they could be looking, but not in the right place. I mean, you know, it's not likely that you're from around here.",
        "Jack: I went through every single name in that phone book looking for something familiar. Anything. And I know it's not going to do me much good, seeing I can't remember my own address, but --",
        "J.J.: You don't you know where you live? That's easy. I learned that in like, pre-school.",
        "Jack: Yeah, listen. JJ, the thing is, I -- I think I was in some kind of accident.",
        "J.J.: Like a car wreck?",
        "Jack: Maybe.",
        "J.J.: You don't know?",
        "Jack: Nope. And somebody found me and they brought me to your mom's hospital. And the doctors there -- they took really good care of me. They gave me medicine and taped up my broken ribs. And I'm healing okay, but my head was hurt, too. And that's still not better. There's stuff I can't remember.",
        "J.J.: Like Patrick!",
        "Jack: Who?",
        "J.J.: On \"Spongebob,\" when he got hit on the head with a coconut and he couldn't remember his name or anything. Did you see that one?",
        "Jack: I -- well --",
        "J.J.: You don't remember! Duh. Sorry. Don't worry, I have the tape. We'll see what Patrick did.",

        "Ben: I shouldn't have said that. About being raped.",
        "Jessica: You're hurt and you're angry and you have every right to be. Is there anything that I could say right now that you would listen to? Please? There was no \"affair\" with Doc. It was -- it was just that one time. I was in a strange, dark place -- I don't know. I was out of my mind with trying to get pregnant. And I was pushing to make it happen, and I was pushing you. I was frustrated and angry and hating myself and -- and it happened.",
        "Ben: That's it? That has got to be the most pathetic explanation I have ever heard. You think that changes the facts? You're my wife. You made love to another man. Tell me something, Jessica. If I hadn't had Walker run those genetic tests, would you have ever told me the truth? What am I thinking? The woman was ready to let me raise another man's child as my own! Why wouldn't she let me mourn him?",
        "Jessica: But, in my heart it was your child, Ben. In my heart --",
        "Ben: Not in your body! The baby that was growing wasn't mine. I will never forgive you for that, Jessica.",

        "Parker: No! When you get to the dungeon, you're supposed to hit reset.",

        "Mike: You really miss him, don't you?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Mike: Yeah, your mom misses him, too.",
        "Parker: I hear her crying sometimes, when I wake up during the night.",
        "Mike: It's hard when moms are sad.",
        "Parker: I keep telling her, Jack's coming home.",
        "Mike: You know what, Parker? Because -- because it could take a really long time, I think it makes Mom more sad to talk about it. But I have an idea.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Mike: Let's make a deal. All right, whenever you think about Jack and you want to say something, you can call me. Anytime. All right? We'll talk about Jack as much as you want. Can we try that?",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Mike: All right. Let's write down my cell number. Do you have a piece of paper, a special place where you can keep it?",
        "Parker: I have a \"Spongebob\" notebook, where I -- Jack gave it to me. That's where I keep my important notes.",
        "Mike: Sounds like the place.",
        "Parker: I'll go get it.",
        "Mike: All right.",
        "Parker: It won't make you sad to talk about Jack?",

        "Julia: \"Aww, Mom --\" no, I don't want to hear it. You go brush your teeth -- all of them, even the back ones. Put your PJs on and wash your face, okay.",
        "Jack: If it's one thing I do remember, it's that moms rule the nest. You gotta do it, buddy. Come on.",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "Julia: Thanks. I'm sorry. He's -- yeah, he hasn't had a man's attention for a really long time.",

You need to make them push for this arraignment as soon as possible. And then they have to set bail. I don't care what it is 'cause we'll make it. If there's not enough in my personal account, then we'll just take funds from B.R.O.'s account. I'm not going to spend the night in this jail, but, of course, Paul's going to have to sign the release forms for that.",

Even when it came to picking up the check, Jack would be down to his last ten bucks, and he'd still say that your money was no good. He was the most generous man that I knew.

And whenever I feel like I'm about to slip into a black hole, I can see your hands, reaching out to me. Because of Jack. Because you know what I've lost. We can never fill the hole that's been left, but we will try. Because he would. All the good in my life -- all the good in me came because Jack Snyder loved me.

        "Jennifer: Only if you give him the chance.",
        "Barbara: You don't understand.",
        "Jennifer: No, you don't. He was going away, to solitary confinement, where wouldn't have a chance to get at anyone, ever again. It was a done deal until you decided to --",

        "Craig: I see some of you are shocked to see me up here talking. Jack wouldn't be. He may not have been the quickest pony on the track, but he knew a thing or two about people.

        "Craig: -- His kids. Most of you in this room. And I am proud to say that some of that meathead's compassion even spilled over onto me -- occasionally. I'll never forget him. But I will try to forgive him for leaving us too soon.",

And you know that even with all my faults, I would sooner die myself than let a child be hurt. If I'm guilty of anything, it's of being scared. Of not trusting the prison system to stop James when they never have before. Okay, I know I made a huge mistake. Huge. And I have to live with that the rest of my life. But do you really want to send me to prison?",

        "Jennifer: I remember every word. And when Tom Hughes asks me, I will tell him the truth. And now, I can tell him how you plan to get around it. You asked me what I came here for, Mother? That's what I came here for.",
