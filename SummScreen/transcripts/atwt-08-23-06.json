        "Mike quits working for Simon after he tells Carly and Simon he won't work for someone who buys an inspection certificate rather then make the necessary structural improvements to make the building safe. Carly tries to walk out on Simon too, but he pleads with her to stay explaining that they would lose the deal if he had to wait for the building to be fixed. Once he hooks the investors, he promises to get the necessary work done. Carly is swayed by thoughts of being successful and independent. Simon and Carly wow the investors and close the deal, as do Simon and Carly when they seal the deal with a kiss; Carly quickly excuses herself though, not really knowing what just happened. The Snyder family and few others gather for the christening of \u0091Baby Snyder.' Holden and Luke name him Ethan after they find Lily's list of names and meanings. Holden asks Luke to be Ethan's godfather and Lucy his godmother. Dusty attends the christening much to Lucy's surprise. Lucinda asks Dusty to have dinner with her and then after witnessing Dusty and Lucy talking, asks Lucy to join her for a quiet dinner as well \u0096 neither knows about the other's invitation. Holden later visits Lily willing her to wake up to meet their son Ethan. He saw the meaning of his name \u0096 steadfast and constant - and realized it was perfect because it described their love. After Maddie admits to Henry what Louis did, Henry wants them to go to the police, but Maddie is scared for all of them and is even thinking Louis may be the slasher. Henry wonders about that now as well. Maddie stays behind in Henry's car when he goes to tell Eve. Casey wonders about Maddie, and becomes even more concerned when he finds some bracelets of Maddie's outside his door. Margo asks Eve about the mask and she lies, which she calls her on; Eve wonders coldly if Casey is trying to frame Maddie since she broke up with her? Margo leaves and Henry tells Eve what Maddie told him. Eve is disbelieving at first, but then when she hears more of the story, she starts to realize it is true. Henry demands they go to the police, but Eve is hesitant and Henry can't figure out why? She wonders if Louis turned Maddie into a murderer? Her rage had to go somewhere; is she killing people to get back at all of them for not protecting her? Henry won't hear it and assures her their sister is not the slasher. He goes rifling through Louis' stuff to prove it. The lights go out on Casey and Gwen as Casey wields a butcher knife for protection, but it is a false alarm. Casey and Gwen decide to leave town for a few days to go to Raven Lake. Margo finds Maddie and asks her about the mask, and when she doesn't answer her, Margo is forced to tell her she has to come down to the station. Henry finds a black hooded sweatshirt in Louis' suitcase."

        "Simon: New York was the wind-up. This is the big pitch.",
        "Carly: The boys with the bankrolls are coming to town.",
        "Simon: You nervous?",
        "Carly: What? No, no, of course not. You thought I wowed them in New York? Well, now they're on our turf.",
        "Simon: Uh, Mike -- Mike? No point in bagging up your toys and going home. You'll only have to bring them back in the morning.",
        "Mike: I won't be back. I quit. And if you're smart, you'll do the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Grandmother --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, there you are. Up and about.",
        "Lucy: Look, we've been through this. I'm fine, really.",
        "Lucinda: You took an awful risk, Dear.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. The main thing is Damian's out of our lives.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, he just turned into a bat and flew back to Malta.",
        "Lucy: Any changes in Lily?",
        "Lucinda: No. But I'm -- I'm feeling more sanguine today. I have more faith -- it's stronger, anyway -- that she's going to wake up and be herself again.",
        "Lucy: What's different about tonight?",
        "Lucinda: Well -- a new beginning, and you're invited.",
        "Lucy: The beginning of what?",
        "Lucinda: Life. What else is there for us to celebrate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I know it's here somewhere. Your mom, she never throws anything out.",
        "Luke: What are you looking for, Dad?",
        "Holden: That list of baby names that your mom put together before Nat was born. I think it's here.",
        "[Holden hugs Luke]",
        "Luke: What was that for?",
        "Holden: I'm just happy that you're home. I'm happy that you're safe.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm very happy to be home. So, the list?",
        "Holden: Right. List of baby names from A to Z. A list that your mom put together and usually submitted for my approval at 3:00 A.M.",
        "Luke: Well, I know they say \"What's in a name,\" but I do think it's kind of rude to keep calling my little brother \"Wiggles.\"",
        "Holden: Your grandmother's right. Baby Boy Snyder, he needs a name.",
        "Luke: I agree. But do you have to give him one tonight?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, there. You better hope your mom doesn't come back and see you out here. She wanted us inside with the door locked.",
        "Casey: Whatever.",
        "Gwen: Anything we need to talk about?",
        "Casey: Like what?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. We could stick to sports and weather. Unless you're mad at me.",
        "Casey: About what?",
        "Gwen: Look, I know that you didn't want me to tell your mom about the mask in that photo. But I had to. Because whoever attacked us was wearing it.",
        "Casey: I'm not mad at you. I'm just -- I hate that the mask belonged to Maddie.",
        "Gwen: I know. I do, too.",
        "Casey: I mean, I really hate it. I mean, ever since Lia was killed, I've tried to convince myself that Maddie wasn't a murderer and that she didn't bash me in the head and nearly strangle you.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you know what? Maybe she didn't do any of those things.",
        "Casey: You don't believe that any more than I do.",
        "Gwen: Well, I want to. I mean, come on. Maddie? Look at her -- look at her face. She couldn't kill anyone.",
        "Casey: I agree. But if Maddie isn't the Slasher, then who is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Louis, where are you? I can't believe the horrible things that henrys' accused you of. I'm sorry. I know you love Maddie, and you would never do anything -- please, just come back to the hotel so we can talk. I love you.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Margo: Eve, is Maddie here?",
        "Eve: No, she isn't. What do you want from her this time? Fingerprints, DNA?",
        "Margo: No, no, no. The mask in this photo. Do you recognize it?",
        "Eve: No -- I don't.",
        "Margo: You're lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Look, you've already done the hard part -- admitting that Louis raped you. And the only person in line to get hurt right now is our dirt bag brother-in-law when we feed him to the cops.",
        "Maddie: No, Henry!",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, dropping a dime on this sicko is going to be the best money I've ever spent.",
        "Maddie: We cannot go to the police.",
        "Henry: Why, because he threatened you?",
        "Maddie: Not just me.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. You think he's the -- you think he's the one that's responsible for these murders?",
        "Maddie: I can't prove it, but --",
        "Henry: But you're pretty damn sure. No, that makes -- no, that makes a lot of sense, actually. That he would go after you to shut you up about the rape -- and Casey and Gwen, in case you had filled them in on it.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but it doesn't explain Lia and Nate.",
        "Henry: Unless, Honey, he wanted to make you look so guilty that -- that if you did try to blow the rape whistle, who's gonna believe a crazy little girl with a lot of blood on her hands? Now, this makes a lot of sense. This is adding up. We need to report this bastard before he kills somebody else.",
        "Maddie: No, Henry! No, Henry, we can't report it! No!",
        "Henry: You don't mean that. You don't mean that. You're not thinking this through.",
        "Maddie: I haven't meant anything more in my life, okay? We are going to act like there was no rape, and if you say anything, I swear I will tell everyone that you're lying.",
        "Maddie: Louis told me, after he did it, that if Eve ever found out that I had betrayed her, he would -- she would just be destroyed.",
        "Henry: You did not betray her, okay? It was a rape, it wasn't a love affair.",
        "Maddie: I still feel guilty.",
        "Henry: Oh, Honey, I know you do. That's how guys like this work, okay? They pile on -- they pile on the fear and the guilt until you get so loaded down that you can't move, you can't think -- you can't even call out for help.",
        "Maddie: Eve is going to be so devastated.",
        "Henry: I know, she will be. When she finds out what kind of person she is with, she is going to be devastated. We're going to have to help her through that. But right now, we have got to get her away from him, before something happens to her, too.",
        "Maddie: Louis wouldn't do anything to Eve.",
        "Henry: Baby, we don't know what goes on behind closed doors. And if he's running around attacking people -- killing people -- to stop you from ratting him out -- we've got to get her away from him.",
        "Maddie: Okay, you're right, but --",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Maddie: I want Eve to hear it before we go to the police, okay?",
        "Henry: All right. Okay, that's my girl. We'll go talk to her right now.",
        "Maddie: Oh, Henry?",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Maddie: I know you're gonna think I'm a coward --",
        "Henry: No -- not in this or any other lifetime.",
        "Maddie: But seeing Eve's face after you tell her what her husband did -- I don't know -- i don't think I can handle it.",
        "Henry: All right, well -- I can't leave you here, Sweetheart. I called Louis a rapist to his face. He could be looking for you right now.",
        "Maddie: No, well, being here in a random parking lot is a lot more safe than being in the hotel.",
        "Henry: With Louis on the loose, I don't think any place is safe.",
        "Maddie: I will lock the doors and honk the horn if there's trouble.",
        "Henry: Do you have your cell phone?",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Henry: Is it charged?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I promise.",
        "Henry: You do not leave this car. Do you understand me? You do not leave this car at all.",
        "Maddie: I won't.",
        "Henry: Don't go out there in crazy town.",
        "Maddie: I won't. Tell Eve I'm really sorry.",
        "Henry: And I'll tell her you love her.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Henry: Lord -- lock this door!",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Detective Hughes, where do you get off?",
        "Margo: Casey told me that this mask -- it's Maddie's. And then Gwen Munson told me that the person who attacked her was wearing this mask along with a dark hooded sweatshirt.",
        "Eve: Oh, so it follows that Maddie's the attacker and lying to cover up for her?",
        "Margo: Look, I know that you are doing your level best to keep Maddie from being arrested.",
        "Eve: You have no evidence tying my sister to any of these crimes.",
        "Margo: Could we not have this conversation in the hallway? Thank you. I know it's hard, isn't it? It's hard trying to figure out what's best for the people we love. And I know that -- you know, I have sympathy -- you're trying to protect your sister. But you have to understand, I'm doing my job. I'm trying to make sure that there's not another murder here. So if you know anything, I'm warning you, withholding evidence from a police investigation could result in your own arrest.",
        "Eve: Let me see the picture again. This is Casey behind the mask?",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eve: Looks like a perfect fit. Maybe he's the Slasher.",
        "Margo: But -- no, there's no motive. I mean, there's nothing that points to him.",
        "Eve: What, it's not a possibility that he's framing Maddie for breaking up with him?",
        "Margo: Excuse me, but Casey has done nothing but protect Maddie at every turn, and with mounting evidence and even at the risk of his own life. So to accuse him of framing her for murder is just not logical. Not only that, it's downright ungrateful.",
        "Eve: Well, you'll have to excuse me, Detective, if I'm not bursting with gratitude over the hell that my family's going through right now. I've answered your question --",
        "Margo: Untruthfully.",
        "Eve: I would like you to go now.",
        "Margo: I would like to search the premises.",
        "Eve: No way in hell!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You know, you don't have to stay out here.",
        "Gwen: I know. I -- I want to. I want to do something, say something, tell you that everything is going to be okay.",
        "Casey: I just keep thinking about something my mom said. She said that this was going to be my golden summer. You know, between high school and college. No worries. But what was going to make it golden was Maddie. You know? What happened to that?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. It's like there's no way that the person you love and believe in could do something so heinous. But then they do it, and it just --",
        "Casey: How did it get so twisted? I mean, this is Maddie we're talking about -- the girl that drove me nuts with all of her rules about doing the right thing. And the girl that had kittens on a notebook. She wouldn't even eat a grape in the grocery store without even paying for it.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Will: If she was jealous about me and Lia, the Maddie I know would have wanted to talk about it 24/7, not turn into some psycho Slasher who stalks people and then -- or maybe I never knew Maddie after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Ah, here it is. Here it is, Mom's list of baby names. That one. I remember she said that that was her favorite.",
        "Holden: She wrote the name's meaning next to it. Not bad.",
        "Luke: Works for me.",
        "Holden: So we're pre-approved, we're all set.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but, Dad -- if you knew about the list, then why did you wait until now to name the baby?",
        "Holden: Because I wanted to have both of my boys home at the same time.",
        "Luke: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Would you a couple extra duties around the house?",
        "Luke: Whatever you need.",
        "Holden: How about being your brother's godfather?",
        "Luke: Are you serious?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Why me?",
        "Holden: Because your brother needs somebody to look up to. And I think you're the man for the job.",
        "Luke: I'd be honored. Thanks, Dad.",
        "Holden: Good. [Doorbell rings] That must be the minister.",
        "Emma: Hey!",
        "Lucinda: Darling --",
        "Holden: Hello, welcome.",
        "Emma: Hello, my baby.",
        "Lucinda: Hello, other darling! Good to see you, darling.",
        "Emma: Hey, save some of those for me, young man.",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Jump in.",
        "Emma: My goodness, you look great.",
        "Luke: Thank you. I feel great.",
        "Holden: So Mama, where's Meg?",
        "Emma: Well, she felt odd about asking for the night off on her first night back at her job.",
        "Lucinda: How about that? That something good happened? Because she saved Lucy's life, they've reinstated her at the hospital.",
        "Meg: Isn't that wonderful?",
        "Holden: Is that it?",
        "Emma: That's it. This is it. This is the Snyder family christening gown.",
        "Lucinda: Now for the answer to the big question.",
        "Emma: We have the baby, we have the gown --",
        "Lucinda: What is the name?",
        "Emma: Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You know you can't quit, Michael. You're under contract.",
        "Mike: Sue me. I'll tell the judge how you bypassed the building inspector and got someone to sign off on a structure that's not up to code.",
        "Carly: Oh, tell me -- Simon, you tell me that you did not do that!",
        "Simon: Oh, come on, this? Please. This construction, completely solid.",
        "Mike: Katie warned you about working with him.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, Katie hasn't had a good word to say about me in a long time.",
        "Mike: Well, it didn't take you very long to do something unethical and completely illegal, did it?",
        "Simon: A little overdramatic, Mike.",
        "Mike: All right, you know what? Carly, you've still got a chance to walk away from this. Or you can hang around and hope this building doesn't collapse on you. I hope you walk, but that's up to you. Excuse me.",
        "Simon: Well, that boy is really uptight. Makes you wonder how Katie finds any fun with him.",
        "Carly: At least Mike's not a liar.",
        "Simon: Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no. You can't quit on me, too.",
        "Carly: Watch me.",
        "Simon: So you're really going, huh?",
        "Carly: Yeah, unless that door falls off its hinges and traps me underneath it.",
        "Simon: And what happened to staying and wowing the investors?",
        "Carly: Well, they're most likely stuck in the elevator. I think I'll take the stairs.",
        "Simon: Oh, come on, Carly, don't -- this is our big chance. Don't walk away from this.",
        "Carly: Simon, I am walking away from a disaster before it happens. After everything that's gone down over the last year, I can't afford to get into anymore trouble. Especially not if it involves selling investors on a possible death trap. I'm not gonna trade my children for a prison jumpsuit because you're too cheap or too stupid or too lazy to figure out what's wrong with this building and fix it!",
        "Simon: Listen, my dealings with the building inspector have nothing to do with you -- or Mike.",
        "Carly: That's right. As long as we get out while the getting's good.",
        "Simon: And look, you know, you know he's signed on to this project, trying to find a way to get to me. And he thinks he's hit on it.",
        "Carly: Simon, you bribed a city official!",
        "Simon: I didn't bribe anyone. I merely made a very small down payment on our future success.",
        "Carly: Down payment? Is that what you're calling it? That's cute, Simon. That's very creative.",
        "Simon: Come on, Carly, you know if I'd waited for those repairs, our whole enterprise comes to a screeching halt. The deal cools, the investors take their red hot little checkbooks and go scouring someplace else.",
        "Carly: Well, yeah, I'm sorry. I was always taught safety first!",
        "Simon: Safety first? Fine, if that's your attitude, then pack your stuff, and go home. Because no one got anywhere by playing it safe. Oh, and I might as well just rip this up, huh?",
        "Carly: Well what is that?",
        "Simon: This? This -- this is just the work orders for the minor repairs to commence as soon as the investors sign off on our project.",
        "Carly: But Simon, isn't that like fraud? Isn't that taking their money under false pretenses or something?",
        "Simon: Carly, Carly, Carly, Carly, you have my word. That everything will be brought up to code and beyond once this deal is made.",
        "Carly: Walk away. Walk away Carly, walk away. And don't turn back --",
        "Simon: Look, if everything's made right in the end, why not stay and play? Do what you did in New York, and they will be throwing money at you. Because at the end of the day, you and I -- we can make this hunk of glass and concrete into a showplace, four stars and rising. We'll be the talk of the town. But you know what? I'll admit Mike is right about one thing, it is your choice. So, if you want to run along like a scared little rabbit, I'm not going to stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: What were you two whispering about?",
        "Lucinda: Well, Holden has chosen a name from a list that Lily made ages ago.",
        "Emma: What, are you going to let me in on it? Oh, that's nice.",
        "Faith: Tell me, tell me!",
        "Holden: Maybe your brother can tell you?",
        "Faith: He can't talk.",
        "Holden: Sure he can. Ready, let's see. Okay, come on over here.",
        "Faith: That was you.",
        "Holden: Nah, I can't fool you, can I?",
        "Lucinda: Well I think it's absolutely perfect name. Leave it to my Lily to pick something original and perfect.",
        "Holden: Come on, guys. Sit down.",
        "Lucinda: There you go.",
        "Lucy: Smiling faces. I'd almost forgotten what they look like.",
        "Luke: You know, home hasn't felt like home until now.",
        "Lucy: I know. So much sadness. Dusty. Jen. Well, aren't I just the old party pooper?",
        "Luke: So, how are things with you and Dusty?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. He saved my life. That's as good as it gets, right?",
        "Luke: I don't know. Is it?",
        "Lucy: Well, we've made progress. Not as much blame in his eyes. He's tried to make me feel less guilty about letting Jennifer leave the hospital.",
        "Luke: But it's not like you guys are new best friends.",
        "Lucy: I'm still the grim reminder. It's hard for Dusty to be around me. So, it's better if I just keep my distance.",
        "Holden: Hey, Luke, can I get your help over here.",
        "Luke: To be continued.",
        "[Door bell ringing]",
        "Lucy: I'll get it. It's probably just the minister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: I told you I've never seen the mask before. If you want to search my rooms, you need to get a warrant.",
        "Margo: You realize you're just making things harder for Maddie.",
        "Eve: Good-night. I have nothing more to say, Detective.",
        "Henry: We need to talk.",
        "Eve: Go away.",
        "Henry: This is important.",
        "Eve: Look, if you're here to spread more filth about my husband --",
        "Henry: Please, Eve. Would you please let me in?",
        "Eve: No more lies, Henry. Promise me.",
        "Henry: They're not lies, Honey. They're not lies.",
        "Eve: I think you'd better leave.",
        "Henry: I just got back from Maddie. And she confirmed everything. In chicago, it was Louis, Honey. Louis raped our sister.",
        "Eve: No. It's not possible. You know for weeks now, Maddie does not know what is real and what isn't. I'm not saying she's lying deliberately --",
        "Henry: She did not lie. But you know what? You just lied to Margo about the mask. I haven't seen the picture, but I know exactly what she was talking about. It was that mask that Maddie made, and you sent it from Chicago with a bunch of her stuff.",
        "Eve: Look, the detective said that the attacker was wearing a dark sweatshirt and that mask when Gwen Munson -- I was trying to protect Maddie.",
        "Henry: Look, we both know that she does not have it in her to attack anybody. But someone attacked her.",
        "Eve: I do not have to stand her and listen to this --",
        "Henry: Someone attacked her in the safety of her own bedroom. In the privacy of your own home! In the privacy of your own home.",
        "Eve: Stop it! Stop it!",
