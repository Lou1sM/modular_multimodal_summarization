        "Lucy: I'm just going to run upstairs and change.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, Darling. You're perfect just as you are. Absolutely perfect. Hurry, hurry up. The food is ready and we don't want it to get warm.",
        "Lucy: You did all of this for you and me?",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course. Why not? We've got it. Let's use it. You're a hard working young intern, and we've had a uplifting day at the christening. Would you prefer to come home to paper plates?",
        "Lucy: Do you even own paper plates?",
        "Lucinda: Possibly we could find some in some rank corner of the pool house.",
        "Lucy: You know, I haven't had these olives -- these are Dusty's favorites.",
        "Lucinda: Are they? Pop the cork on the champagne, Darling. I want to have a drink -- a toast to lovely Ethan Walsh Snyder and do it properly.",
        "Lucy: Are you going somewhere?",
        "Dusty: Lucinda? I told you I'd take you up on your dinner invitation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Mosquito netting?",
        "Casey: You know, I don't want to get bit.",
        "Gwen: We are going to a lake, not the Congo.",
        "Jade: Have fun. So, I take it Crash is going to be closed over Labor Day?",
        "Casey: I figured it doesn't make much sense to open, everybody's going to be out of town.",
        "Jade: Including you two.",
        "Gwen: You know, it's not what you think.",
        "Jade: Well, I guess we all have to move on, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Barbara: I suppose you're still angry with me for showing up at the motel and trying to talk some sense into you.",
        "Will: I didn't like the way you were talking to Jade.",
        "Barbara: First, I hear that Gwen has been attacked. Then I hear that even though you saved her, she has moved out. I was upset.",
        "Will: I know the whole story, Mom. I was there. It doesn't justify you talking to her that way.",
        "Barbara: But you can't understand why I would want to lash out at someone who's trying to ruin the best thing that ever happened to you. Okay, I don't want to dwell on that. I am only here because I have heard something from your father that might be of interest to you.",
        "Will: About what?",
        "Barbara: He tells me that you've been accused of trying to hurt your wife the night she was attacked. Is that true?",
        "Will: Pretty much.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Will. Aren't things painful enough? Can I come in? I half expected to see Gwen here.",
        "Will: Yeah, she's -- she's staying with Margo and Tom.",
        "Barbara: Well, she probably feels a little safer there after the attack. This is so far our in the woods.",
        "Will: Thanks for trying to make me feel better.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you're so young. You've taken on so much.",
        "Will: Mom, I don't want to talk about this stuff right now. So, just tell me what you came to tell me.",
        "Barbara: Okay, while I was down at the station, your dad got a call from Margo. Evidently, there's been a break in the Slasher case.",
        "Will: What kind of break?",
        "Barbara: There's some new evidence. And apparently, it could lead to an arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: A lot of people have sweatshirts like that.",
        "Henry: Eve!",
        "Eve: It doesn't mean that my husband is a killer.",
        "Henry: He raped Maddie!",
        "Eve: No! No!",
        "Henry: I know this is hard for you accept --",
        "Eve: No!",
        "Henry: But you do not know who Louis real -- Jack. Whoa, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I was going to knock, but I heard screaming.",
        "Henry: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Eve: No, it is not okay!",
        "Jack: What is going on, Henry?",
        "Eve: It's all my fault. I didn't -- I didn't want to believe it.",
        "Henry: Honey, I am so sorry.",
        "Eve: Oh, God.",
        "Jack: Jack, its Louis. It's her husband. We think he's the Slasher.",
        "Eve: It's all my fault. Oh, God, my Maddie, my Maddie \u0096",

        "Dallas: Maddie, we need your permission before we can continue this conversation.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Margo: You sure you don't' want us to wait until Jessica arrives?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Margo: All right. [Margo sighs] State your name. Maddie?",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Margo: Just say your name.",
        "Maddie: Madeline Coleman.",
        "Margo: For the record, Madeline Coleman has stated that she is going to answer our questions on tape without benefit of counsel.",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Margo: For the record, Madeline Coleman is holding a photograph in her hand. It is of herself and Casey Hughes. Maddie, do you recognize the mask that Casey is wearing in the photograph?",
        "Maddie: Yes. It's mine. I made it. It was -- hanging on the wall above -- over my bed. No.",
        "Margo: Maddie, what is it? Maddie?",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Maddie: No -- no! No! No! No! No!",
        "Louis: Do you want it as much as I do?",
        "Maddie: No! No!",
        "Louis: Don't worry, it'll be our secret.",
        "Maddie: No!",
        "Louis: As long as you don't tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: No! No! No! No! No! No, I don't want to!",
        "Margo: All right, all right. What don't you want?",
        "Maddie: I tried to stop it.",
        "Margo: All right, honey, Honey, Honey -- Maddie, Maddie? Maddie, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Maddie, look at me. You're okay. You're in a safe place. Just breathe. And relax. Okay, tell me, what are you trying to stop?",
        "Dallas: Maddie, were you trying to stop yourself? Is that it? Were you trying to stop yourself from picking up that knife? From hurting somebody else?",
        "Margo: Maddie -- [Margo sighs] [Cell phone rings] Hughes.",
        "Jack: Margo, its Jack. I'm with Henry and Eve. They've got crucial information about the killings. Listen, we're going to pick up Maddie and we'll be in.",
        "Margo: Uh -- I've got her here with me. I picked her up earlier this evening.",
        "Jack: Margo, please -- don't question her until we get there. Promise me. You got to trust me on this. Just don't let her say a thing.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Jack: Maddie's down at the station.",
        "Henry: But I left her in the limo --",
        "Jack: Margo picked her up.",
        "Eve: Please tell me they're not questioning her.",
        "Jack: No, they're holding her until we get there.",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. This is so out of control. How did I let it happen?",
        "Jack: Eve, Eve, it's going to be okay. We're going to get this all straightened out. Okay? Don't you worry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Jack's right. Jack's right. Now that we know what's going on, we can do something about it. Talk to the police and we'll bring Maddie home. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hi. Hi, Darling.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.",
        "Lucinda: No! No, no, no, not a bit. You see, we were all enjoying ourselves so much at the christening this afternoon I thought, \"Hey, let's not call it a night. Let's get together, have dinner and catch up.\"",
        "Dusty: The three of us?",
        "Lucinda: Well, that was my plan. Unfortunately, though, I've had a phone call. One of my race horses has a --",
        "Lucy: You do not.",
        "Lucinda: A broken foreleg. All right, Darling. All right! I thought it was high time that the two of you got together. I mean, you are friends. Or you should be.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda, I came to the christening for Lily and Holden out of respect. But, you know, I'm not ready to social -- whatever. Excuse me.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, it's not socializing, Darling, it's just dinner --",
        "Lucy: Let him go! Let him go. You've -- you've really outdone yourself this time. How could you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, I only heard a few details. But apparently, Margo told Hal that Gwen identified the mask that the Slasher was wearing and it seems it belonged to Maddie Coleman. I shouldn't even be telling you this 'cause this news has not been released. So, please, please, just keep it to yourself.",
        "Will: I was accused --",
        "Barbara: I know you were accused. Just keep it to yourself.",
        "Will: So where's Maddie now?",
        "Barbara: Margo's bringing her in for questioning.",
        "Will: That's awful. I mean, I don't want to believe it's her, but after officer griffin picked her up here that night, you know, she just seemed so guilty.",
        "Barbara: She's obviously a sick girl.",
        "Will: So what's going to happen to her?",
        "Barbara: She's looking at a long stay in a hospital, I would think.",
        "Will: Wow, she's such a great person. I can't even --",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, Honey.",
        "Will: I mean, after you kill all those people, how can you come back from that?",
        "Barbara: One day at a time. Anyway, I just thought with everything else, you might want to hear a bit positive news.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess so. Thanks.",
        "Barbara: I'm glad to see that you're taking care of things around here.",
        "Will: Well, I couldn't live in it the way it was.",
        "Barbara: No. No. Listen, I want you to just take care of you for a few days, all right? Think about your future. And then when you feel like it, give Gwen a call.",
        "Will: Gwen doesn't want to talk to me.",
        "Barbara: She will. You give her time, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Nobody's moved on, Jade -- except for you and Will.",
        "Jade: Fine. Call it what you want.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Not that it's any of your business? Because it's not. But Casey and I are going to the thing at Raven Lake as friends because we need some distance. We need to get some space from everything that's going on here.",
        "Jade: So Maddie killing your friends and will sleeping with me, that's the same in your book?",
        "Casey: You know what, you have no proof that Maddie's killing anyone --",
        "Gwen: All right, you know what, let's not get into it.",
        "Jade: No, because hiding behind feeling sorry for yourself is easier than dealing with what you did.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me? What I did?",
        "Jade: Your husband loves you. And okay, obviously he's not perfect, but he's a wonderful guy. He's smart, he's kind, he's loving, he'd do anything for you. He risked his life trying to save you when Maddie tried to kill you --",
        "Casey: It wasn't Maddie.",
        "Jade: Whatever. Okay? The point is, Will is trying to fix the marriage and you won't give him a chance.",
        "Gwen: I'm not talking to you about my marriage.",
        "Jade: What marriage? You walked out on him. I would never do that to him.",
        "Gwen: Oh, let's not talk about what you would do.",
        "Jade: I'm not why you two broke up. What happened with Will and me, that was a one-time thing.",
        "Gwen: Really? Why are you guys living together at the motel?",
        "Casey: I thought we weren't going to talk about this.",
        "Jade: Listen, if it wasn't me around, it'd be somebody else picking up the pieces.",
        "Casey: Hey, let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Where is she?",
        "Jack: She's probably in the interrogation room.",
        "Eve: I thought you said Detective Hughes agreed not to question her before we got here?",
        "Jack: I'll talk to Margo and get her caught up. Eve! Eve! Henry!",
        "Eve: Maddie. Honey, I'm -- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.",
        "Jack: There have been some developments.",
        "Eve: Honey, I thought letting you live with us -- I thought it was helping you. I had no idea.",
        "Margo: Well, that makes two of us. So, does somebody want to explain what's going on?",
        "Henry: Honey, its okay. You can tell Margo the truth? Eve knows.",
        "Maddie: You're not mad?",
        "Eve: Oh, Sweetheart. I could never be mad at you. You need to tell the police what you told Henry. It's okay.",
        "Maddie: What I said about being raped -- it did happen. I was lying when I said I made it up. And I'm really sorry that I ran away. I just couldn't say anything. I didn't want to hurt my sister. The person who raped me was -- my brother-in-law Louis.",
        "Eve: Can you ever forgive me, Baby? Can you ever forgive me?",
        "Jack: We found this among Louis's things.",
        "Dallas: A dark hooded sweatshirt.",
        "Margo: So Louis is the killer?",
        "Jack: He threatened Maddie. He told her he'd kill Henry and Eve if she said anything.",
        "Dallas: That would explain his attitude when we saw them together.",
        "Jack: It would explain a lot.",
        "Margo: So where is he?",
        "Jack: Well, Eve told me that he said he was going back to their room at the Lakeview. When she got there, he was gone. She doesn't know. But my guess is as far away as he can get.",
        "Dallas: Henry? Do you have any idea where we might find your brother-in-law?",
        "Eve: Baby, I'm sorry.",
        "Maddie: It's okay. It's not your fault.",
        "Eve: What matters now is this is over. He can't hurt you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I really -- I love that one.",
        "Holden: He was really hollering. His mouth's almost as big as his head.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm going to take all these pictures, I'm going to make them into a collage for Mom when she wakes up. I'm going to get a picture of his birth certificate, you know, his footprints --",
        "Holden: You know what? I think it's really great what you're doing and I appreciate it.",
        "Luke: It's fun.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I'm thinking maybe you need to get out of the house. Why don't you hook up with some of your old friends? This project's not going anywhere.",
        "Luke: I wouldn't -- I wouldn't know who to call. You know, people are at work or they're away for the summer.",
        "Holden: Just make a couple of calls.",
        "Luke: I wouldn't know where to start.",
        "Holden: What about the guys from the basketball team?",
        "Luke: That -- no.",
        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Luke: Well -- they're all into girls -- and that's fine. It's fine, but I don't really fit.",
        "Holden: Okay. Well, I can understand that. But, you know, you guys, you were together for a whole season. I mean, that's kind of -- that's got to mean something, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but the truth is, Kevin -- Kevin pressured me into going on this really stupid blind date.",
        "Holden: And?",
        "Luke: And I tried to explain to him that I wasn't into it, but he didn't get it. And -- ah, the whole thing was just a disaster. I got drunk. You know, that's when I crashed the car.",
        "Holden: So that's why you were drinking.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I just felt so -- uncomfortable. Look, Dad, I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: No, you know what? That's all in the past. Just forget about it. So you and Kevin --",
        "Luke: Well, Kevin, thinks that I'm a weirdo. I don't really blame him. He just -- he doesn't understand and I can't find a way to explain it to him. Will and Jade are the only ones who know. Oh, and Lucy. She was great about it. She was like, \"oh, you're gay? What else? You know, how's summer going? Do you have plans for college?\" You know, like it was no big deal.",
        "Holden: Well, Lucy's a very caring person.",
        "Will: Yeah. And Kevin -- Kevin's just all, like, beer, girls, basketball. To be honest with you, I don't even know what I saw in him. He's really pretty boring.",
        "Holden: I don't know about that. You guys have known each other since the second grade.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Holden: You know what? You will tell Kevin about yourself when you're ready to do that. In the meantime, I really think you need to get out of this house.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm okay --",
        "Holden: Even if it's just to go see a movie. Something. You know, you don't want to talk about your orientation, then that's fine. You will do that when you're ready. Talk about things that interest you. Sports, photography, whatever. I promise you, you're going to find people -- friends who you can relate to. Who can relate to you.",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Luke: Ethan.",
        "Holden: I'll get him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: The man just lost his wife. He's grieving.",
        "Lucinda: I know that, darling. Why do you think I invited him over here? He's stuck in that hotel suite with that little baby all time. I wanted him to know that there are people who care about him.",
        "Lucy: This was a blind date.",
        "Lucinda: No.",
        "Lucy: What would you call it? The candles. The flowers. The two of us alone on the terrace.",
        "Lucinda: I'd call it a nice dinner among friends.",
        "Lucy: We were lovers, Grandmother.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, you were. I know that, Dear. And then you weren't and then he found somebody else. And he married her and she died. And he's a widower.",
        "Lucy: Partly because of me.",
        "Lucinda: No. That's nonsense. Jennifer died because she ignored doctor's orders. And he -- he was understandably upset about all that. But, I mean, clearly he wants to patch things up with you. You were very friendly at the christening.",
        "Lucy: Not anymore. Did you see his face a few minutes ago?",
        "Lucinda: He's a grown-up, dear. He's a grown man. You do not have to coddle him, all right? He'll state what he thinks, say what he wants to say. If he's unhappy with anybody around here, he's unhappy with me.",
        "Lucy: You think?",
        "Lucinda: And I don't care, 'cause I can handle it, okay? There are many times when I have been unhappy with him. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work. But that's okay because we're friends, so we can get on with it. We can move on.",
        "Lucy: Did it ever occur to you that maybe I wasn't ready -- I wasn't ready to be pushed?",
        "Lucinda: No. No, 'cause you still love him. And he cares for you. He still cares for you, Dear. Of course, everything in its good time. [Speaking French] Olive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I know you don't want to see me, but you weren't picking up and I think you should know the news.",
        "Will: I already heard about Maddie.",
        "Jade: Maddie?",
        "Will: Yeah, the evidence that they found. That she's the Slasher.",
        "Jade: Oh, my God. I mean, I know she was here the other night, but they have actual evidence that she stabbed people?",
        "Will: Why are you questioning it? You've been saying it's her since day one.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but I was still wondering. I mean, straight-a Maddie, the Oakdale Slasher? It's -- it's too weird.",
        "Will: I probably shouldn't have said anything, so you can't mention that to anyone.",
        "Jade: Of course not. What else do you know?",
        "Will: I can't talk about it.",
        "Jade: Of course, I'm just in shock.",
        "Will: So if you didn't come to talk about Maddie, then why are you here?",
        "Jade: Right, uh -- Gwen and Casey are going away to Raven Lake for the weekend at some Labor Day celebration.",
        "Will: Well, that's it.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Will: I'm going to go up there and I'm going to get her alone and I'm going to show her that we're not done.",
        "Jade: Will, wait.",
        "Will: I need a bus ticket. Hi, yeah. I'm going to need a ticket from Oakdale to Raven Lake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, how's it going in here?",
        "Maddie: Better.",
        "Margo: Listen, I talked to Henry. He's going to take you back to the Lakeview. We're going to give you a police escort. We're also going to station an officer outside your door. I want you to get some sleep tonight.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Henry: Hey, Sweetie. Come on, let's go. Let's go order way too much ice cream from room service. What do you say?",
        "Margo: Eve. We need you to help us.",
        "Jack: We need to find Louis.",
        "Margo: We need you to call him and have him meet you someplace.",
        "Eve: I'm sorry, I wish I could help you, but I don't know where he is.",
        "Jack: We'll be right here. Just keep the call short.",
        "Eve: What if he suspects something?",
        "Jack: You're his wife. You want to know where he is. It's a routine phone call. Nothing out of the ordinary. You can do this.",
        "Eve: Okay.",
        "Margo: Good. Good. We'll be right here. And you just let us know as soon as he tells you where he is.",
        "Louis: Eve?",
        "Eve: Hey, Honey. Where are you?",
        "Louis: A place called Yo's. Why?",
        "Eve: Did you say Yo's? Is that a restaurant? Did you eat dinner yet?",
        "Louis: I just had a beer. I'm headed up to that coffee place to get a sandwich or something.",
        "Eve: Oh, I haven't eaten anything yet. If you're headed over to Java, can I meet you there?",
        "Louis: Sure. Are you okay?",
        "Eve: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Louis: You sound funny.",
        "Eve: I'm just -- I'm just stressed out. The police are questioning Maddie again. They still think she's responsible for these -- I'll tell you about it when I see you, okay?",

He would just say he was checking to see if the doors were locked, or all the lights were turned off. But then, um -- I caught him on his computer, looking at one of those sites with young girls. He claimed that his client ran it and that he was doing research for an audit. And it didn't make any sense, but I wanted to believe him.",
