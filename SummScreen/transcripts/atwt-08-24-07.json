        "Henry: Sur --",
        "Vienna: Surstromming. You know, we need to get the printer to make an umlaut for the new menus.",
        "Henry: What is it?",
        "Vienna: You know, the O's with the two little dots.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. I mean, what is the sur --?",
        "Vienna: Oh, the surstromming. You've never had it? It's fermented herring.",
        "Henry: Fermented?",
        "Vienna: Well, maybe that's not the right word.",
        "Henry: Rotten?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, that's the right word.",
        "Henry: Great. Sweetie, they can't pronounce it, what makes you think they're going to order it?",
        "Vienna: I know it might not sound appealing to American ear. But it's a delicacy in Sweden. We have festivals to celebrate it, and we have museums to honor it. And people come from all over the world just to taste it. And where else in Oakdale can you get that, but here in Al's diner?",
        "Henry: That is an innovative marketing strategy. But if we don't get some butts in the seats, it's not going to matter if we have a new menus or a new business plan or any of that.",
        "Vienna: Oh, someone's coming! We have a customer!",
        "Alison: Where is everybody?",
        "Vienna: Okay, quick! You've got to get this off.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Vienna: Your uniform.",
        "Henry: Uh, Alison. You probably haven't heard. Vienna and I won Al's in a poker game, and so now we're your new bosses.",
        "Alison: Are you firing me? If you want my uniform?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. It's just -- she just hates the uniform, that's all.",
        "Vienna: Who would dress such a beautiful girl in this travesty of an outfit? We need to change it. You don't mind showing a little bit skin, do you?",
        "[Alison leaves]",
        "Henry: I -- don't worry about it, Sweetheart. She's probably just having a fermented day.",

        "Aaron: Lunch break.",
        "Holden: Yeah? Where's your lunch?",
        "Aaron: You can come out and just say it.",
        "Holden: Say what?",
        "Aaron: The video of Dusty and Alison online. Did you see it?",
        "Holden: I heard about it.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, somebody's gotta be really sick to do that to them.",
        "Holden: Well if you ask me, the one who's sick is Dusty.",
        "Lily: Hey. Dusty! Hey, why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, I've been busy. I'm just heading out now.",
        "Lily: Have you had any more trouble with Cheri since the video incident?",
        "Dusty: She actually just called me and wants to meet me.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. I'm on my way to find out.",

        "Cole: Why did you set me up like that, Sofie?",
        "Sofie: I didn't know Gwen was your sister! Why didn't you tell me you had family in Oakdale?",
        "Cole: Because I didn't want a scene like the one we just had. Why were you talking to her anyway?",
        "Sofie: Well, I was talking to Aaron, and he told me he had a friend in the music business.",
        "Cole: Do me a favor -- don't talk to Aaron about me or us or anything else that matters.",
        "Sofie: I was just trying to help.",
        "Cole: You call this helping? Thanks to you, she thinks I'm just trying to use her.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, Cole. But if she gets to know you better --",
        "Cole: No, no. It's too late for that. I gave up on my family a long time ago and I'm not about to give up my career.",
        "Sofie: Don't you even think about that. You are so talented, Cole. You are so incredibly talented. I want the whole world to hear your music.",
        "Cole: If I'm so talented, why do I need so much help? My music should speak for itself.",
        "Sofie: It does.",
        "Cole: Yeah, obviously you don't think so.",
        "Sofie: I do. You just need somebody to hear it first.",
        "Cole: Yeah, right. So, my sister hates me and my girlfriend thinks I'm a loser. Thanks for making my day, Sofie.",

        "Iris: Gwennie, what's wrong?",

        "[Iris screams]",
        "Iris: My baby's having a baby.",
        "Gwen: Knock it off.",
        "Iris: Do you know how happy it makes me?",
        "Gwen: I have a pretty good idea, yeah.",
        "Iris: Yeah. Oh, obviously I'm not the only one, huh? Looks like Barbie's staking her claim. You know, she may not be giving any money to Will, but I'm sure she's going to dole out some serious cha-ching for the baby.",
        "Gwen: What, you already took Will's trust fund? That's not enough. Now you have to steal from her child?",
        "Iris: Ah, no. That trust fund was given to me for services that I rendered. And I would never steal from the baby.",
        "Gwen: Barbara doesn't take anything from us. And that's all that you do. That's why Cole's here, right?",
        "Iris: Cole?",
        "Gwen: No. Don't give me that stupid surprised look, Mom! Well, you know what? I'm not gonna let you use Cole to get to me or my baby. I'm not going to let either of you near my family. So, whatever you're plotting, you can give it up right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I see, so you can handle being married to me, but you draw the line at wearing my ring?",
        "Meg: It's just that particular ring, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm not one for empty promises, Meg. Now, if are not committed to this marriage, you need to let me know that right now.",
        "Meg: You don't understand. The reason I can't wear that ring -- it's got nothing to do with you or us. It's because of Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's not fair to blame Craig for everything that's happened. Some of it was my fault.",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying? Are you saying that you hurt Jennifer? That's not possible.",
        "Paul: I hated Craig for what he had done to you. I hung on to the one thing that you'd left behind -- a clue about Jennifer's baby. And I followed that clue until I discovered the truth -- that Johnny was not dead. That Craig had just everybody believe that he was dead so that Jennifer wouldn't fight him for custody.",
        "Rosanna: And Jennifer must have been very happy when you told her.",
        "Paul: It's not that simple. Look, I did something I'm not so proud of. Well, if you can't forgive me, it's not like I blame you.",
        "Rosanna: Paul. I'd forgive you for anything.",
        "Paul: Maybe not this.",
        "Rosanna: You would never intentionally hurt Jennifer. So whatever happened, it was just a mistake. It was an accident.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, Craig deliberately ran you off the read and that's what he called it. A mistake. An accident. But it wasn't. It was deliberate. And so was what I did to Jennifer.",
        "Rosanna: What did you do?",
        "Paul: You were trying to get to Jennifer to tell her the truth. That her baby wasn't dead. That Craig had manipulated everyone. And when I finally put the pieces together, and when I discovered that Jennifer's baby had survived --",
        "Rosanna: You went to her and told her?",
        "Paul: I kept Craig's secret. I didn't tell my own sister that her son was alive. It's very hard for me to explain it. But she'd already been through so much. I guess I convinced myself that I was saving her.",
        "Rosanna: From Craig?",
        "Paul: Well, he'd almost killed you trying to get to his son. What was he going to do to her? All I saw for her was a lifetime of her being threatened by him -- being hurt by him.",
        "Rosanna: I understand.",
        "Paul: I didn't want him destroying her life the way he destroyed yours.",
        "Rosanna: He didn't destroy me, Paul. But what has he done to you?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. If I'd known -- if I'd already known what it was like to be a father, if I'd known the hell of losing a child, then I would've known that what I did to Jennifer was worse than anything Craig would have done. I mean, if I'd known how little time she would have had with Johnny -- I robbed her of that.",
        "Rosanna: No. Craig robbed her.",
        "Paul: Yeah, look, you don't need to make me feel better. Craig didn't love Jennifer, but I did. I loved my sister very much. Craig threw that in my face afterwards.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean? What did he say?",
        "Paul: He taunted me about how I could never manage to protect the women in my life from him.",
        "Rosanna: When was this?",
        "Paul: At the cliffs. When I almost died.",
        "Rosanna: But why would he do that now? I mean -- I was gone, Jennifer was gone. I mean, was it somebody else? Just tell me, Paul. Is there somebody else that you were trying to protect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know Paul and I were planning to eventually be married.",
        "Craig: I surmised.",
        "Meg: He'd bought the rings for us. This ring.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Meg: He had visions. He saw me wearing this ring, and he thought I was in danger. So he brought the rings back to the store and you --",
        "Craig: And I bought them?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Craig: That's some coincidence.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Craig: I never thought that Paul Ryan and I would share the same taste. So you don't want to wear this because of Paul?",
        "Meg: I'm just saying I can't wear that ring. I hope you understand.",
        "Craig: Of course I do. Of course I do. Of course I do. Come with me. Come on.",
        "Meg: Where?",
        "Craig: Come on. Just -- we want to go. Come on.",
        "Meg: Craig, we have tons of work to do.",
        "Craig: No, no. We have something much more important to do. Trust me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Dusty was dating Emily, and he slept with her little sister?",
        "Aaron: It happened before they were dating. Before I even came back into town.",
        "Holden: You're sure about that?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Holden: It must've been pretty shocking to see that video.",
        "Aaron: The first time, yeah.",
        "Holden: The first time. That's why you and Alison broke up.",
        "Aaron: No, we didn't break up because of Dusty. We broke up because she lied about it. I just don't understand it, Dad. I mean, she tells me about doing the porn films. She tells me about being addicted to crystal meth. And I say I still want to be with her anyway. But she still can't -- doesn't have the nerve to tell me about her and Dusty.",
        "Holden: Did she tell you why?",
        "Aaron: No. And then I lost it. I couldn't get past that. I mean, she didn't trust me enough to be honest with me? I mean, the rest of the stuff I can deal with. But that? No way. Crazy, right?",
        "Holden: I know how you feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I thought you were going to let this go?",
        "Dusty: Cheri told me she's leaving town. And I want to make sure she does that without any trouble.",
        "Lily: Dusty, if she was going to leave town, she would have left town. Why does she need to see you? What does she want from you?",
        "Dusty: That's what I've got to find out.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, no. Don't do that. Every time you get involved this woman, everything escalates. You stopped her business at the Avalon, you kept her from going into the Lakeview. Just let it go. It's not worth it.",
        "Dusty: Alison is.",
        "Lily: You feel guilty for getting her involved in this mess? I understand, believe me. I feel guilty myself.",
        "Dusty: You? Why?",
        "Lily: Yes, if you hadn't stopped me from giving those rooms to Cheri at the Lakeview, none of this would have happened.",
        "Dusty: Helping you was a benefit for the greater good. It was no big deal.",
        "Lily: So, is there anything I can do to stop you from meeting with Cheri?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Lily: Let me go with you.",
        "Dusty: I appreciate you trying to help --",
        "Lily: But why should you listen to me? I can't do anything else right.",
        "Dusty: No, you do a lot right. You have a family, that's why I'm not dragging you into this.",
        "Lily: You didn't. Cheri did. And now I'm worried. So, tell me -- what is the plan? How are you going to handle Cheri?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to make sure she stays out of our lives. For good.",
        "Lily: Dusty!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Do you know how much I want this child? No. No, no, no. Of course you wouldn't. Because you didn't want me or Cole.",
        "Iris: How could you say that to me?",
        "Gwen: Because kids know things, Mom. And I knew by the time I was four years old that you'd rather be out dancing at some bar than at home cooking me dinner.",
        "Iris: Yeah, but Honey, look how you turned out. I must've done something right.",
        "Gwen: You did a fantastic job. I knew how to use a microwave by the time I was five.",
        "Iris: Well, there you go. All right. So, you hate your mama. You're going to have therapy for life. That's no reason to take it out on your brother.",
        "Gwen: He left me, Mom. When I was a little kid and he was older. He left me.",
        "Iris: No, he left me! Look, don't be so angry at your brother, all right? You don't want to help me -- that's another thing.",
        "Gwen: You already helped yourself to everything we have.",
        "Iris: Yeah, but look, the bank has been replenished. I'm sure that Barbie is going to fork over a chunk 'o change for the little angel.",
        "Gwen: Shut up about the stupid money, Mom! We don't have cash hidden away somewhere! You took it all!",
        "Iris: Oh, you're like a broken record. Look, Sweetheart. You're happy. You're singing again. You got a baby on the way. What does Cole have, Honey?",
        "Gwen: Why is he my responsibility?",
        "Iris: All right, so you resent him because he left you. You want to show him what a better person you are? Have a heart, Gwennie. Is it going to kill you to just give him a little helping hand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey. Hey, I'd get you a tissue if I knew where they were.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: No, I'm sorry -- \"Hi, we're your new bosses, please take off your clothes.\" If you want to run screaming from here and from us, I totally understand.",
        "Alison: I really need this job.",
        "Henry: You're Emily's little sister. You've have nothing to worry about as long as we're running this joint.",
        "Alison: I've got plenty to worry about, but thanks for making me feel better in the job security department.",
        "Henry: I don't about job security if we don't get a customer sometime this century. Is it always this slow?",
        "Alison: This time of day, yeah -- pretty much.",
        "Henry: Well, on a more pleasant note -- how is Emily? I heard she was in Europe.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't know. We're not exactly speaking.",
        "Henry: It's not a more pleasant note. I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: I should probably just tell you this before you find out and decide to fire me. And actually, you're probably the only person in Oakdale who doesn't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry, there's a shifty-looking man outside. But he just keeps pacing back and forth, just peering through the window. What do you suppose he wants?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I assume this is not normal customer behavior. Is he a regular?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Vienna: Oh, well, maybe he's upset that al's gone. What if he just tries one of my pepparkakor --?",
        "Alison: No, no. This is not about Al. He's staring at me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I thought you were blacklisted here.",
        "Cheri: I've still have some friends in high places. You know, I hate having to leave Oakdale. I've grown very fond of so many things here. But, I guess it's the price of doing business.",
        "Dusty: So, what do you want?",
        "Cheri: Honestly, Dusty, I'd like to apologize for letting my temper get the best of me. And putting that video of you and Emily's little sister on the internet. It didn't really serve any purpose except for to give me some small sense of satisfaction.",
        "Dusty: And now that you're satisfied?",
        "Cheri: Well, I thought maybe it was time for us to call a truce before things get out of hand.",
        "Dusty: You mean, before I strike?",
        "Cheri: I do love an intelligent man. I've got a proposition for you.",
        "Dusty: Oh, no, thanks.",
        "Cheri: Look, this is kind of tough for me. I don't think I can get through it without a drink, so me drink alone. Please?",
        "Dusty: Okay, let's do this.",
        "Cheri: I'm willing to leave town.",
        "Dusty: How soon?",
        "Cheri: Well, that depends on you. Wherever I'm going, I'm going to need your help to get there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Is something going on with you and Lily?",
        "Holden: No. No, we're fine.",
        "Aaron: Because you said you understood how I felt about Alison.",
        "Holden: You know what? I shouldn't have said that. I don't want you to think that Lily's been unfaithful or anything like that.",
        "Aaron: I didn't. Dad, I know you love Lily. And if you need somebody to talk to, even complain, I still know you love her.",
        "Holden: She kept a secret. More than one. And it's like you said -- the lack of trust. It just hurts. And in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking that maybe she's hiding something else. And it's very hard to get past that.",
        "Aaron: Remember that day at the Lakeview, when she was calling and you didn't want to talk to her? I don't think that helps the relationship at all. Not that I should be giving you advice.",
        "Holden: No, it's probably pretty good advice.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, it didn't work for me. I tried it myself.",
        "Holden: You've tried to talk things out with Alison?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, you know, I tried -- I thought maybe Alison and I could be friends. I made the first move and decided to call her. But she hasn't called me back yet.",
        "Holden: Maybe that's for the best.",
        "Aaron: Maybe. Maybe it's not the best for you and Lily. Listen, if you can get through all of these years with me as your son, you can get through anything. Wow, this is the first time I've seen you laugh since I've been back in town.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Aaron: Hi. Is it cool if I keep my bike here until tonight?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. It's fine.",
        "Aaron: Okay, cool. See you later. See you, Pops.",
        "Lily: Is he okay?",
        "Holden: Not really.",
        "Lily: I could talk to him.",
        "Holden: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Lily: Why not?",
        "Holden: It's personal.",
        "Lily: Since when can't my husband talk to me about my stepson's personal problems?",
        "Holden: You really want to know?",
        "Lily: Yes, I do.",
        "Holden: The girl that he loves lied to him and he doesn't think he can trust her anymore.",
        "Lily: Maybe I should go talk to him.",
        "Holden: No, you know what? Aaron doesn't need you making excuses for Alison. He just needs time to be angry right now. He needs it, and he deserves it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I couldn't even help Cole if I wanted to. I'm not in the music business right now. And I just want to focus on my family.",
        "Iris: Cole is your family, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: He didn't even tell his girlfriend that he had a sister.",
        "Iris: What are you going to tell the baby ten years from now when he asks or she asks where they came from? That you're ashamed of who you are?",
        "Gwen: No. I'm ashamed of who you are. And even thought I would really love it if my baby had a big extended family, you and Cole will never be there for my child. Not by your choice and certainly not by mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Let me help you with that.",
        "Sofie: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: Hey, did you talk to Gwen? Is she going to help Cole with the whole music thing? Sofie, what's wrong? What happened?",
        "Sofie: Could I just have my tray?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
