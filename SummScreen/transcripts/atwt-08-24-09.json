        "Lucinda goes to see Lily, who has shut down according to Luke, as Lucinda wants him to get out of the house for a time so she will look after Lily. Janet tells Jack about a call from the funeral director regarding Holden's arrangements, as Jack tries to cope. He goes to speak with Lily, but she does not want to speak with anyone so he talks with Lucinda. Lily continues to not be able to cope at all with Holden's \u0091death.' Lucinda tries to get through but can't as Lily refuses to be a part of the arrangements or even attend any funeral. Noah receives amazing news from Mason about his screenplay and Jude Law wanting a meeting with him, but he turns him down to support Luke in his time of need. When Luke arrives to see Noah, he ushers Mason away after he implies that Noah is missing out on something. Emma doesn't react well to Damian's visit or apologies for her loss, as Meg is unhappy to see this. Emma won't apologize, as Meg later asks Damian for support and to go for a walk with her. As they are leaving, they bump into Lucinda, who is there to talk with Emma, but when Damian hears of Lily's behavior, he forgets he is supporting Meg and offers to go help Lily. At first, Lucinda is against this, but Damian finally persuades her. Luke convinces Noah to tell him what Mason was alluding to, as Noah finally relents and explains about the meeting with Jude Law. Luke is shocked but thrilled for him and urges him to go. Noah wants to stay with him and meet and get to know his family, who are coming into town, but Luke wants Noah to go on this meeting to help his career. He is finally able to convince Noah that he will be able to support him when he comes back. Damian goes to see Lily, who isn't receptive at first, but finally Damian is able to get through to Lily, which Meg secretly witnesses. Later, Meg pretends to just have arrived when Damian is comforting Lily, as they are headed over to the funeral home. Meg is very pleased at first when Damian tells her that he is happy she came, but it turns to disappointment when Damian asks her to take Ethan while he and Lily go to the funeral home. Meg hides her sadness and heads off, after a backwards glance at the two of them. Jack receives a fax from the police in Kentucky, as Jack is trying to make sense of the accident scene and the strange tire marks. Janet thinks he is trying to see a mystery there because he is a cop but at the end of the day, Holden will still be gone. Jack struggles not to be angry with Holden after they surmise he must have simply fallen asleep at the wheel, as Janet tries to comfort him. Lucinda and Emma talk about Holden and what kind of son and son- in-law he was, as Lucinda wonders if Emma wants to help with arrangements, but she turns her down. They lament that a child should never die before a parent. When Meg comes in with Ethan and she learns of how Damian helped Lily, Emma apologizes and admits that she was wrong about how she treated Damian. Damian holds Lily's hand at the funeral home, as she faces Holden's coffin, but she asks him to leave so she can be alone. Lily falls apart as she talks to \u0091Holden' not wanting to accept he is gone because she doesn't know how she will go on. Later, Damian arrives to see Meg, which makes her happy, as she also relays to him Emma's admission of being wrong about him. Damian seems very preoccupied with Lily and her feelings though, as he is supposedly there to comfort Meg, which isn't lost on her. A sleeping man rolls over in a dimly lit room, as we see it is Holden."

        "Lucinda: Hey! Where are you running to, young fella?! Oh! You fell down, and I'm gonna pick you up! Oh!",
        "Luke: Ethan, oh!",
        "Lucinda: Hey. Hi, Honey.",
        "Luke: Oh. Thank God you found him. He escaped from the babysitter.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Well, the babysitter better get a better look out for the kid.",
        "Luke: No, no. It's -- it's not her fault. Everything's just been in complete chaos since Dad.",
        "Ethan: When's he coming home?",
        "Luke: Ethan, I think Laura has a juice box for you in the kitchen. So why don't you go get it? And you have to promise you're not gonna run away, okay? All right.",
        "Lucinda: \"When's he coming home?\"",
        "Luke: He keeps asking the same question. \"When's Daddy coming home? When's Daddy coming home?\" We tried to explain it, but he just doesn't get it.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that's completely understandable. His -- his death is hard enough for the rest of us. And at his age --",
        "Luke: And I feel so bad for my mom. I mean, she won't get out of bed.",
        "Lucinda: Are you speaking figuratively or -- or literally?",
        "Luke: No! Grandmother, she's just lying there, and she won't talk to anyone.",
        "Lucinda: How long has this been going on?",
        "Luke: Since we got back from Kentucky. I was just up there for an hour, trying to get her to eat, trying to get her to talk. That's where we were when we found out Ethan was missing.",
        "Lucinda: So you've been holding down the fort all by yourself, huh?",
        "Luke: No, no. Grandma Emma's been coming by, and Aunt Meg, but won't see either of them. Honestly, I'm starting to get a little worried.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not surprised. And you're running yourself ragged, too. You know what? Get out.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Lucinda: I want you to leave this house!",
        "Luke: No, no. Grandmother, I can't.",
        "Lucinda: That is not a request. That is an order. I want you to get out to get some fresh air and some sunlight. Come on, chop-chop, Sweetie.",
        "Luke: All right.",
        "Lucinda: Go.",
        "Luke: Well, you have to promise that you won't push Mom too hard. She's very fragile.",
        "Lucinda: I've got other strings to my bow. I wouldn't do anything to give more stress to your mom.",
        "Luke: All right. Well, if you insist.",
        "Lucinda: Hurry up, before I change my mind.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Luke: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Hello, Emma.",
        "Emma: Damian.",
        "Damian: You already know how much I regret your loss. I just wanted to bring you a small token of my sympathy.",
        "Emma: Thank you.",
        "Damian: Holden was a fine man. I -- I can't imagine what you and your family must be going through right now. If there's anything I can do --",
        "Emma: Well, you know, actually, there is. It would really help me if you would leave.",
        "Damian: I didn't mean to offend you.",
        "Emma: You haven't offended me. I just don't want you here.",
        "Meg: Mama. You have no right to treat him that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey, yourself. What brings you by?",
        "Janet: Well, you weren't in bed when I woke up this morning. Did you even -- did you even come to bed last night?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I -- I got a lot of work to catch up on. I haven't been exactly logging in the hours the past few days.",
        "Janet: That's understandable. I'm sure Margo wouldn't mind if you took a couple days off.",
        "Jack: The thing is, I need to be here, Janet. Sometimes it's a relief to lose myself in the paperwork. Kind of helps from thinking about my own reality, you know?",
        "Janet: I know.",
        "Jack: What? What is it?",
        "Janet: There was a call this morning. Uh, Emma was in the basement, so I took it.",
        "Jack: About Holden? What did it say?",
        "Janet: It was the funeral home calling. They have Holden's, uh -- his -- his body's been delivered from Kentucky.",
        "Jack: Why -- why didn't Lily get that call?",
        "Janet: He tried to call her several times. Nobody picked up, so they automatically went to the next -- next of kin.",
        "Jack: How did Emma handle the news?",
        "Janet: Well, that's the thing. I haven't told her. Well, look. Everybody thinks -- Emma thinks that she's got everything under control and that she's handling the situation, but we all know that she isn't. So that's why I came to you, so that you could figure out what to do.",
        "Jack: Right. You did the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: I'm sorry if you think I'm being rude.",
        "Meg: Because you are being rude. You wouldn't let any of us speak to a guest the way you just spoke to Damian.",
        "Emma: Damian is not a guest. He did nothing but cause your brother trouble when he was alive. I don't want him in my home.",
        "Damian: I assure you, Emma, I never meant to cause Holden any harm or any trouble.",
        "Emma: But you did. And he's not here to ask you to leave, so I will.",
        "Meg: Mom, we all miss Holden, but Damian has been nothing but supportive these past few days. He flew down to Kentucky twice after the accident.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry! I'm just not going to stand here and watch you roll out the welcome mat for someone who did nothing but make your brother's life miserable! Excuse me, please. Excuse me.",
        "Damian: I'll call you later.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. Please, please. Please stay. Losing Holden has been hard on all of us. I can't get through this without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: Noah, you're not gonna believe this.",
        "Noah: Let me guess. You're ordering decaf.",
        "Mason: No, that will never happen. Okay, look. I didn't want to tell you about this earlier, because I didn't want you to get your hopes up, but I got a friend in Hollywood, out in L.A. who's an agent. Remember the other day, we were talking about who the perfect star would be for your thesis film?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Jude Law. I mean, we can dream, right?",
        "Mason: Your dream may be about to come true. I sent my friend a copy of your script.",
        "Noah: What?! But I wasn't finished. There's tons of rewrites left to do.",
        "Mason: That's all right. Hollywood is a rewrite town. We talked about this the other day. My friend knows it, too. It's okay. It's all right. He liked it. He knows Jude Law. He sent Jude Law a copy of your script. Short of the long, you got a meeting with Jude Law.",
        "Noah: Jude Law --",
        "Mason: Yeah.",
        "Noah: -- Likes my script?",
        "Mason: Uh-huh.",
        "Noah: Oh, well, of course, dude. I mean, he's not offered the top -- the top- budget scripts. I mean, he's -- he's dying to work with a rank amateur.",
        "Mason: I'm dead serious.",
        "Noah: What do you mean? Serious serious?",
        "Mason: Like a heart attack.",
        "Noah: I wish you hadn't said that, 'cause I feel like I'm having one right now. Mason, I -- I can't breathe.",
        "Mason: Smile. Just smile. You got a date with the law -- Jude Law.",
        "Noah: No way! W -- when?",
        "Mason: Tomorrow morning in L.A. so, don't you think you ought to go home, pack your bags?",
        "Noah: No. Tomorrow -- that -- that's impossible. Um -- Luke's father just died in an accident.",
        "Mason: Oh, yeah.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Mason: I'm sorry. How's Luke taking it?",
        "Noah: Really badly. I mean, his whole family is. T -- that's why I can't go. N -- not now.",
        "Mason: I get it. You got to support your boyfriend.",
        "Noah: If it were any other time --",
        "Mason: Noah, an opportunity like this comes up once. It comes up once. Please, just try to talk to him about it. See if maybe --",
        "Noah: No! I'm not gonna make it his decision whether I stay or go. Mason, I'm not gonna leave right now, not when Luke needs me.",
        "Luke: Noah.",
        "Noah: Hey, Luke.",
        "Luke: Hey, Mason. It's good to see you.",
        "Mason: I heard about your father. I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Noah: If you'll excuse us.",
        "Mason: Yeah. No, I'm -- I'm afraid I can't, not until you give this more thought.",
        "Noah: I'm afraid that's not possible right now.",
        "Mason: Please, Noah. Talk to him about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Honey. It's me. May I come in? Luke tells me that you haven't gotten out of bed in days. It doesn't do any -- anyone any good being cooped up in here like this. You need to talk to someone. Okay. Or maybe yell, you know, and scream. Aah, aah, aah, aah! Whatever makes you feel better. Huh? You know I'd do anything for you. You just need to tell me what you need me to do.",
        "Lily: I just want my husband back.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh, Honey.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know what to say. I can't say anything that would help you with the pain, Lily. What can I say to help you feel that your life isn't over yet? I can't say anything. All I can say, so I want to say it, is that you and your children are the most precious beings on this earth to me. And I will be here. I will be here for you and for them no matter what. No matter what.",
        "Lily: I always thought that Holden would be here, too. I can't stop thinking about all the time we spent apart.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, marriages always have -- oh, forget about it. Don't dwell on that.",
        "Lily: I can't help it. I -- I always thought we'd have the chance to make up for our mistakes. And all that time we wasted with Carly and Dusty and Damian -- we won't ever get that time back. Why didn't I appreciate what we had? Why didn't I treasure it?",
        "Lucinda: Treasure it? You did! You did! Both of you, you did. That's why you kept coming back to each other all the time, because you -- you knew that that's where you belonged. I mean, it's just wonderful. It's wonderful, and so lucky that you found your true love when you were so young. So you had -- the two of you, you had this, till now. Most people -- I mean, it's more than most people get in a lifetime.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm sorry, it's not enough! I -- I'm not ready to let go. I'm not ready to let him go. I -- I can't face my life without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Mason, I'm going to do what I know is right.",
        "Mason: Of course you are. It just seems to me that if you're going to do something which is gonna change the rest of your life, then maybe you ought to talk about it with your life partner. All right.",
        "Luke: So, what was that about?",
        "Noah: Oh, it's just typical Mason. You know, making things more dramatic. It's really not important. It's nothing.",
        "Luke: What kind of nothing?",
        "Noah: I want to hear how you are doing.",
        "Luke: Well, how about I just take a cue from Grandma Emma and say, \"As good as can be expected\"?",
        "Noah: Which is pretty bad. I know. But how is Emma? How is the rest of the family?",
        "Luke: I mean, people tell us that it's gonna get better, get easier, but I just don't see it. And, Noah, I am just so tired.",
        "Noah: Do you want me to drive you home?",
        "Luke: No. I can't sleep.",
        "Noah: Have you tried?",
        "Luke: Yeah. After my grandmother kicked me out of the house because she decided I was on the edge of losing it. She's right.",
        "Noah: Well, is there anything I can do?",
        "Luke: Yes. You can tell me what Mason was talking about.",
        "Noah: It's really nothing, I swear.",
        "Luke: Oh, good. Then I really need to hear it. Because after the last few days, I just need to talk about something that's completely not important.",
        "Noah: Well, it -- it's about the movie. You know, something happened. But the timing was off, so like I said, it's not happening.",
        "Luke: Well, can I know what's not happening?",
        "Noah: Mason showed my script to a -- a friend of his who show -- showed it to, uh, an actor out in L.A.",
        "Luke: An actor? An actor? Oh. Oh, wow. Would I know who this person is?",
        "Noah: Um, Jude Law.",
        "Luke: Jude Law? Like Jude Law Jude Law?",
        "Noah: Yeah, and he wants me to come out for a meeting. But -- but the timing's off, so --",
        "Luke: You -- you're seriously not going?",
        "Noah: The meeting is tomorrow, and that is out of the question, okay, because I am here for you.",
        "Luke: Noah, are you insane? You have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: As hard as it is, Lily's gonna have to be the one to decide what happens with Holden.",
        "Janet: I agree.",
        "Jack: So she's gonna have to know about that phone call.",
        "Janet: Yes. And I think that you should tell her about it in person.",
        "Jack: I agree. You want to come with me?",
        "Janet: No, no. You -- you guys, you should be together to talk about family stuff.",
        "Jack: You're family, Honey.",
        "Janet: Well, I don't have the history that you have with Holden, and knowing you, you would spend all your time explaining to me what you're talking about instead of concentrating on Lily. I'll be here when you get back. How is that?",
        "Jack: You're the best.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'll bet you say that to all the girls.",
        "Jack: No. Only -- only the best. Oh, I can't even imagine it. I really -- I can't. I can't imagine it.",
        "Janet: Don't, don't, don't. Just hold me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: The last thing I want to do is to cause trouble for your family.",
        "Meg: You're not.",
        "Damian: You heard your mother.",
        "Meg: Well, she's wrong, okay? I -- instead of giving in to her grief, she's fighting it so hard that it's coming out in the wrong way at the wrong time. You know, maybe if Mama and I could just talk about our feelings, it would help. But every time I mention Holden's name, she changes the subject, and then she starts rolling out more dough to make more strawberry pies.",
        "Damian: Let me guess. Holden's favorite?",
        "Meg: But nothing is gonna make him walk through that door. It never will. You know, the smell of baking in this kitchen used to be such a comfort. And now I just can't stand it anymore.",
        "Damian: Tell me what I can do.",
        "Meg: Take me away, just -- just for a little while. Can't we go for a walk?",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Meg: I just need to breathe. I -- I need to remember that there's still life out there somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I understand that. I understand that contacting the funeral home is just about the last thing she needs to deal with right now.",
        "Lucinda: Wait. Now, wait a moment. It's not a bad idea. Maybe if she focused on something, even something as awful as all of that, it might get her out of bed.",
        "Jack: It's got to be tough on you, too.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, thank you. I mean, this turn of events I -- I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.",
        "Jack: So if there's any way I can ease the burden, let me know, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. Of course. Thank you. That was Jack.",
        "Lily: I don't want to see anybody.",
        "Lucinda: I told him that. However, he came, um, delivering some news. There was a -- a call from the funeral home at the farm. Jack is going to take care of all the paperwork, but he does need to know what you want, what kind of a service you want.",
        "Lily: I don't want a service. I -- I just want my husband back.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, you have to honor Holden somehow.",
        "Lily: Don't you understand? I don't give a damn about services or arrangements or picking out a coffin! I just want him alive. I want him here. I want him home.",
        "Lucinda: I understand, baby. I understand perfectly. But there are other people who loved Holden, as well. And you may not feel a need for a service, but maybe the children might. They might want to say good-bye to their father.",
        "Lily: I'm not gonna put them through that.",
        "Lucinda: What about Emma and the rest of the family? You know, they might want to. Oh, Honey, Darling, they might want to get together and celebrate his life.",
        "Lily: If Emma wants to have a service, I am not gonna stop her, but I won't be there.",
        "Lucinda: Lily --",
        "Lily: I said no.",
        "Lucinda: You cannot ignore this call from the funeral home. At the very least, you have to make a decision and tell us what you want to do.",
        "Lily: Let somebody else decide! If no one can give me back my husband, then there is nothing else to talk about!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, Eliza fell asleep, and Mama said that she would listen out for her, so let's go for a walk.",
        "Damian: Lucinda. Hello.",
        "Lucinda: Damian, what a surprise. Hello, Darling. I haven't had a chance. My heartfelt condolences.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Damian: How is Lily doing?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, she's not doing well at all. That's why I'm here. Because the remains have been sent from Kentucky, and the funeral home wants to know what they're supposed to do now.",
        "Meg: Well, what does Lily want to do?",
        "Lucinda: Lily wants to lie in bed and sob her heart out. Now, I am perfectly capable of making the decisions, but I thought out of courtesy I should consult with your mother and find out what she would like.",
        "Meg: Mama may not be lying in bed, but she's not taking Holden's death any easier than Lily. I don't think she's gonna be any help.",
        "Damian: I think you should try to get through to Lily. No matter what she says, if she's not involved in making these final arrangements, she'll be sorry for it later.",
        "Lucinda: That's very wise, and I agree with you, but Lily flatly and violently refuses to have anything to do with the funeral or to go to a funeral.",
        "Damian: Let me talk to her.",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Okay. When everything was happening with me and my father, did you just leave me and let me try and figure it out all alone?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Luke: No. But it's not the same thing! This is your dream! You have been working for this since I met you.",
        "Noah: Do you really think my career is anywhere near as important to me as you are?",
        "Luke: Oh, I really hope not, but, uh -- but I want you to go. And I promise, when you come back, I will be the same emotional wreck than I am right now. And it's not like I'll be alone or anything. I mean, a lot of people are coming. Aaron's coming, and my Uncle Seth. I'll have a lot of family to support me.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, I thought I was part of your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Whether you like to admit it or not, Lucinda, Lily and I always shared a connection. And that connection might just help me get through to her when other people can't.",
        "Lucinda: She won't listen to you.",
        "Damian: Maybe not. But what would it hurt to let me try?",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Okay. Maybe you'll get her going.",
        "Damian: We can only hope so.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Meg: I'll go with you.",
        "Damian: No. No, no, no. I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Meg: Why not?",
        "Damian: Well, you have to admit you two haven't been on the best of terms of late. Don't worry, I'll call you and let you know how things are going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Janet: How'd it go?",
        "Jack: Well, I didn't see her. Lucinda said that Lily was refusing, basically, to get out of bed.",
        "Janet: I would, too.",
        "Jack: But Lucinda said that she'd keep working on her, try to get her to be a little more accustomed to dealing with, you know, things.",
        "Janet: Well, listen, if anybody can get Lily moving again, it's her mother.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I agree.",
        "Janet: Sergeant Brady left that on your desk. It's a fax. He said you were expecting it from Kentucky.",
        "Jack: I was.",
        "Janet: What is it?",
        "Jack: Something didn't sit right with me last time I was down there, so I had the Kentucky police fax me photos of the scene.",
        "Janet: What are you looking for?",
        "Jack: According to this picture, Holden was headed straight for this tree and then veered away. And take a look. See these two skid marks here? They're heading over this cliff and then into a ravine. That doesn't make any sense. That's not the normal trajectory of a car losing control.",
        "Janet: Whoa, hold on. You lost me. What do you mean?",
        "Jack: What I mean is that something just doesn't add up with Holden's accident.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Damian: Lily? I hope you don't mind my coming by. Cara? I know you can hear me.",
        "Lily: You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't be in Holden's bedroom.",
        "Damian: Then let's talk downstairs. I know you're hurting.",
        "Lily: Everybody thinks they know how I feel. But they don't.",
        "Damian: Then why don't you tell me?",
        "Lily: I can't. Words can't do it.",
        "Damian: I know what it's like to lose someone you love. There's no greater pain. But if things were reversed and Holden was here and you weren't, what do you think he would be doing?",
        "Lily: Don't.",
        "Damian: I'm just asking a question.",
        "Lily: Don't you dare use Holden to get me to do what you want.",
        "Damian: I'm not. But I know how much Holden loved you. You were the world to him. But do you think if he lost you he would just shut down and stop living? More to the point, would you want him to?",
        "Lily: I want you to leave.",
        "Damian: The only way I'm leaving is if you get up out of this bed and push me out. Holden loved you, and he loved his children. Lily, he wouldn't want any of you to give up living in his honor. Cara, you have so many people who love you. Who need you. Your mother, your children, me, we all need you, Cara. Please don't say we have to lose you, too. I know you want to stay here forever in this room you and Holden shared. But you can't. You have a family that needs you to hold it together.",
        "Lily: Holden was the one who did that. Holden was the one who held us all together.",
        "Damian: And now that he's gone, you must take his place.",
        "Lily: I can't.",
        "Damian: I know it's hard, Lily. But do you want Holden's family to fall to pieces? Do you think that's what he expects from the woman he loved more than his own life?",
        "Lily: No. He'd expect a lot more from me.",
        "Damian: Good. So do you think you're ready to start talking about the funeral arrangements? 'Cause I think it would be good for you.",
        "Lily: Please don't say it would give me closure.",
        "Damian: No, I would never say such a thing. I know you won't be able to get over Holden's loss so easily. But still, you have to go on, even though Holden's gone.",
        "Lily: I don't even know how to do that.",
        "Damian: You don't have to do it by yourself. I'm right here. And you can lean on me whenever you need to. Let's start by getting out of this bed, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Holden's remains have been shipped from Kentucky.",
        "Emma: Today?",
        "Lucinda: Yes. Yes, today. So the funeral home wants to know what to do next.",
        "Emma: Well, I think those decisions are -- they really should be up to Lily.",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course they should, but Lily is unable to cope with at the moment. So I-I'm just trying to take care of things.",
        "Emma: Oh, Lucinda, I guess that's what we do, don't we? We mamas kind of step in when children can't sort of take care of themselves.",
        "Lucinda: Right. I wondered if you'd like to part of the process of planning the service.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry. I just have so much arranging to do around here.",
        "Lucinda: Of course.",
        "Emma: I've made all these strawberry pies for afterwards. It was Holden's favorite.",
        "Lucinda: I thought as much.",
        "Emma: I really can't believe that when I turn my back, he's not gonna just sneak away with one of the pies. He always did.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I keep -- wondering how much I'm gonna miss when he calls me on one of the few occasions when I'm pigheaded about something. I'm really gonna miss that.",
        "Emma: Oh, I wonder about that, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: No, I-I will. And -- I'm gonna miss him.",
        "Emma: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Lily is devastated. No man could have made her happier than your son. All these years.",
        "Emma: She made him very, very happy, as well. It's just not right, Lucinda. We should be the ones who are going first.",
        "Lucinda: Tell me about it. No one ever said it was easy being a mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you see what I mean?",
        "Janet: Honey, you're the cop. All I see is a bunch of trees and some dirt.",
        "Jack: Darling, look, right here. These two skid marks right there. He's -- Holden was headed right for a tree. Why?",
        "Janet: Maybe he fell asleep at the wheel, and then he woke up at the last minute, and then he saw the tree, and he tried to turn, and then he lost control --",
        "Jack: Holden is not the type to fall asleep at the wheel. He's the careful one. He takes every precaution. He plays everything by the book. I think I should go down to Kentucky and check things out for myself, try to figure this thing out.",
        "Janet: And then what, huh? Honey, I know it's hard for you to turn off being a cop, but this is a mystery that, I mean, even if you solve it, even if you cross every \"T\" and dot every \"I,\" the outcome is still gonna be the same. Holden's still gonna be gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah, you are the most important person in my world. Which is why I would never forgive myself if you gave up this opportunity because of me.",
        "Noah: This is a major event in your life. I want to be here for you.",
        "Luke: I know! I know! And I -- God, I want you to be here, too. But not at the cost of your dream.",
        "Noah: What about -- what about your Uncle Seth and everybody else who's coming back into town? I mean, don't you want me to meet them? Don't want me to get to know anyone?",
        "Luke: Well, you already know Aaron. And as far as Seth and all the rest, I mean, honestly, I don't think this is a very good time to get to know anyone.",
        "Noah: Right, because they'll be grieving for your father.",
        "Luke: Yeah. But, hey, I promise. You'll get a chance to meet them all. But if you turn down this meeting, you might not ever be able to get that back.",
        "Noah: Yeah, that's what Mason seems to think.",
        "Luke: Yeah, see? So then just go. Go. You know what you can do to make me happy? You can go meet Jude Law and knock his socks off.",
        "Noah: Okay. If you think you don't need me.",

        "Meg: Hi, Lily. Damian. I just dropped by to see if there was anything I can do to help.",
        "Ethan: Mommy, you're awake! Will you play with me now?",
        "Lily: No, Sweetie. Mommy's not feeling so good right now. Maybe later.",
        "Damian: I'm glad you came. I can really use your help.",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course.",
        "Damian: Would you mind taking Ethan back to the farm while I take Lily to the funeral home?",
        "Meg: Sure. Sure. Hey, buddy. Let's go have some fun at the farm. Okay?",
        "Lily: Be a good boy for your Aunt Meg and your Grandma Emma.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're right. The answers I'm looking for, they're not in skid marks or reconstructions.",
        "Janet: I agree.",
        "Jack: I'm just never gonna understand why my sensible, careful, idiot of a cousin didn't have a cup of coffee before getting back on the road.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, everybody makes mistakes.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but they don't usually die as a result! That's why I'm so angry. T-this whole thing could've been avoided if he hadn't been so stubborn to take a nap!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You said Lily and Damian asked you to bring him over, or was it just Damian?",
        "Meg: No, Lily agreed. She and Damian went over to the funeral home to make the arrangements.",
        "Lucinda: Oh! Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, good! Excuse me, will you, please? I've got to get back, see if I can be of any help at Lily's.",
        "Emma: Okay. Well, I must say, Damian certainly did make a big difference with Lily.",
        "Meg: Well, he got her to listen when no one else could. Now do you see that he's not so terrible?",
        "Emma: I suppose I might've been less than generous with him.",
        "Meg: You were wrong.",
        "Emma: Yes. Now, when you see him again, would you tell him that I'm wrong, that I'm sorry?",
        "Meg: I'll do that.",
        "Emma: Thank you. Well, if he can help Lily, we all owe him our thanks. She's been through a lot. Can't begrudge her any support that she can get.",
        "Meg: No, we certainly can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Snyder. Please feel free to spend as much time as you like.",
        "Lily: It was very kind of you to bring me here.",
        "Damian: You know I'll always be there for you.",
        "Lily: I know. And now I'd like to be alone with my husband.",
        "Damian: Of course. I'll wait right outside.",

        "Meg: I'm sure she appreciated your support. You've done so much for all of us, Damian.",
        "Damian: I wish I could do more.",
        "Meg: Mama is finally coming around. She wanted to apologize for the way she treated you before.",
        "Damian: Oh, I hope you told her there was no need to apologize.",
        "Meg: I think it's a really good sign. I think she's starting to appreciate you. Especially after the way you helped Lily.",
        "Damian: A tragedy like this makes us all realize how fragile life is, how vulnerable we all are.",
        "Meg: I couldn't agree more.",
        "Damian: We can all use all the help we can get. Especially Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It feels so strange, talking to you when I can't see your face or hear your voice. They tell me that you're in here, but I just don't feel it. You're not inside this wooden box. The Holden I love is in my heart and in my soul. And you always have been, and you always will be. I've loved you for most of my life, Holden. I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to be without you.",
