        "Simon: Hey.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi.",
        "Simon: Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Carly: No, no, you didn't. I'm sorry, I was just a million miles away.",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Simon: About what happened --?",
        "Carly: About last night --",
        "Simon: So, I guess you were thinking about the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: The way I see it, we got a lot of things going for us. So basically, anyone who's not hooking up at Raven Lake doesn't deserve to be in the game. Like him.",
        "Luke: Hey, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: You're not going to the lake, right?",
        "Luke: Well, actually, I was thinking --",
        "Kevin: Don't. Because we're all trying to have a really good time, and basically, you're like the black hole when it comes to hooking up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opening]",
        "Maddie: No, leave me alone!",
        "Eve: Honey, hey, hey, hey. It's just us. It's just me and Henry.",
        "Henry: Its okay, Sweetheart. You're safe now.",
        "Maddie: I guess I was dreaming.",
        "Eve: Of course. We're sorry, Honey. We're sorry we startled you.",
        "Maddie: Where were you? Was I alone?",
        "Henry: He couldn't get to you, Baby. I made sure of that. You're safe now.",
        "Maddie: Where were you?",
        "Eve: I was at the police station.",
        "Maddie: They found Louis?",
        "Eve: Not yet. But I was doing everything I could to help them.",
        "Maddie: They're not gonna find him. He's too smart.",
        "Henry: Maddie, if they can't find him, that means he's 100 miles away from here. He knows what would happen to him if he even came near you.",
        "Eve: Yes, Henry is right. It's okay. It's over, Babe.",
        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Louis: This isn't over.",

        "Maddie: No, you don't understand! He is never gonna let it be over!",

        "Will: Hi.",
        "Kim: Hello. Feel like having a little company?",
        "Will: Um, well, the place is kind of a mess right now.",
        "Kim: No kidding? What a surprise. This is that mac and cheese that you like so much. Do not nuke it. Warm it up in the oven.",
        "Will: So you know about me and Gwen?",
        "Kim: Yeah, Honey, I do. Your mom told me and I'm really sorry.",
        "Will: How much did she tell you?",
        "Kim: Not much. Just enough. I think she was trying to respect your privacy.",
        "Will: Well, all you really need to know is that it was all my fault.",
        "Kim: Well, that's a refreshing attitude, coming from a man. Not that I'm sure it's accurate, however, it is refreshing. Are you going someplace?",
        "Will: Yeah, well, I was thinking about it. But then I changed my mind.",
        "Kim: Really?",
        "Will: Well, Gwen's going up to Raven Lake with a bunch of kids. And for a while, it seemed like a great idea if I just show up.",
        "Kim: But you just changed your mind.",
        "Will: Well, I realized it probably wouldn't work, seeing as how every time I see her, no matter how hard I try, I end up acting like a jerk and saying exactly the wrong thing.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey --",
        "Will: I'm just -- I'm really scared that I'm gonna blow my last chance to get her back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, Ma, it's me. I guess you're out protecting and serving. Just wanted to say thanks for letting me use the car. We're gonna be heading out soon. Yes, I will drive careful and I will call you this weekend. And you work too much. Yo! Hello. I thought you were gonna pick out some tunes for the ride.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah. It just seems kind of lame.",
        "Casey: It's the summertime and we're kids. We go to the lake.",
        "Gwen: My marriage is breaking up. I can't really say that I'm a kid anymore.",
        "Casey: Gwen, nothing you could do right now wouldn't feel weird. So, that's why we should go someplace with a lot of people. We could go swimming, build a bonfire, whatever. If you forget for even five minutes, it's worth it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Casey: And if you and Will don't talk for a couple of days, maybe the next time you do, you won't go ballistic and you could work things out.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe if we just give each other some space, things'll work out. And if Jade goes to hell and gains like 150 pounds, that'd be, like, really great, too. I swear, Casey, I think the main reason that I'm going is because I know that she's not gonna be there.",
        "Casey: Me, I'm going just to have a good time. You know? Not really thinking about the fact that I was kind of, maybe, dating a serial killer.",
        "Gwen: Are you starting to think that it might be her?",
        "Casey: It's scary to think that someone's out there with a knife, but it's also scary to think that someone would be that messed up. Let's do it. Let's get out of here. Let's pretend we have normal lives.",
        "Ann: Who's ready to party?",
        "Casey: Well, sort of normal.",
        "Ann: Casey Hughes, you have my undying gratitude. Taking the bus to the lake would have been like riding your bike to prom. Hey, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Hello, Ann.",
        "Ann: So, I have sandwiches, brownies, potato chips and cookies. I think we can gain three pounds by the time we get there. You got a cooler?",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's in the basement.",
        "Ann: I hope I have enough. Maybe we should get some chicken.",
        "Casey: Maybe this could be fun.",
        "[Gwen screaming]",
        "[Gwen screaming]",
        "Gwen: Casey! Casey! Casey, watch out for the knife.",
        "Casey: Call 911.",
        "Gwen: Watch out!",
        "Casey: Who the hell are you?",
        "Zach: \"Watch out for the knife, Casey.\" The rubber knife. [Zach laughs] Come on, man, what happened to your sense of humor?",
        "Gwen: You're so lucky this is rubber right now.",
        "Ann: I knew you were an idiot, Zach, but not world class.",
        "Zach: It was just a joke. Come on. Why's everyone acting so serious?",
        "Casey: So serious? You try anything like that again, I will pound on your face until you need that mask.",
        "Zach: Okay, geez. Sorry.",
        "Ann: You okay, Gwen?",
        "Casey: Gwen, it was just a joke.",
        "Gwen: No, I know. I know. It's fine. Can we just get the mask out of here? It's stupid.",
        "Casey: Yeah, right away. Out of the way, jokester.",
        "Zach: Look, Gwen, I'm sorry.",
        "Ann: Too late. You okay? Wanna take turns kicking him?",
        "Gwen: No, I'm fine, really. Let's just not talk about it. It didn't happen.",
        "Zach: And nothing's going to happen. They're watching Maddie pretty closely, aren't they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You need to start thinking about this as a part of your past.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I wish I could. But it's kind of hard when I'm a suspect for murder.",
        "Henry: Honey, you are not.",
        "Maddie: Henry, the TV and the papers, they don't say anything. They don't say it was Louis.",
        "Eve: Honey, the police just have to be really careful. They have to catch Louis before they can completely close the case.",
        "Maddie: But it's never gonna happen because they're never gonna catch him. 'Cause he's smart, and he's too smart, and he can do anything --",
        "Henry: Stop. You need to stop thinking like that.",
        "Eve: Yes, Henry is right. They will catch him, and this will end. It just might take a while. Which is why I've decided to go back to Chicago. And I want you to come with me.",
        "Maddie: Back there? To that place?",
        "Eve: No, not to our house. To Bernadette's.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Eve: We'd be safe there. And so much has happened here.",
        "Maddie: I don't even know if they're gonna let me go. I mean, I'm a suspect for murder.",
        "Eve: She's your sister, of course they'll let you go --",
        "Henry: It's a formality that they haven't closed the case. They know you're innocent.",
        "Maddie: Do they? You think Margo told Casey that it wasn't me?",
        "Henry: I don't -- I don't know.",
        "Maddie: I messed everything up with him. I mean, I was so mixed up when he tried to help me -- and I wouldn't even talk to him. And now, what am I -- I'm leaving? What is he gonna think? He's gonna -- I don't know what he's gonna think.",
        "Henry: Well, we should go talk to him before we leave.",
        "Eve: Henry --",
        "Henry: They were close for a long time. She has a right to tell him what happened. And that everyone else was wrong.",
        "Eve: Do you think that's a good idea?",
        "Maddie: I don't even know if he'll see me.",
        "Henry: Of course he'll see you, he's crazy about you. And once we clear up all these suspicions, you can put the worst of this behind you.",
        "Eve: She can't go alone.",
        "Henry: Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve. She needs to get back to being normal. And talking to her boyfriend with her brother in the background is not exactly normal. Go to the cops, tell them that you guys are leaving. She'll talk to Casey, and I'll make sure she's back here in time to leave for Bernadette's.",
        "[Eve sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I still don't understand what the problem was. I mean, I set you up with a girl who's totally into you, and you bail.",
        "Luke: Well, I guess you set the bar really high, Kevin. You put me off my game.",
        "Kevin: See, that's his problem. He thinks this is funny. We were with these two girls, and its smooth sailing until genius over here -- you know, I don't even know how he did it, but we managed to go from the road to paradise to nowhere.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Guy #1: Just what we're looking for this weekend.",
        "Guy #2: Not.",
        "Kevin: So unless you're bringing a girl this weekend, I suggest you stay home.",
        "Luke: You know what, I gotta go.",
        "Kevin: Hey, don't let us stop you. Man, there's something weird about that kid.",
        "Guy #1: Well you know, his mom is in the hospital.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, he's lucky. I mean, wish my father was in there. Hey, Jade. You going to Raven Lake? Need a ride?",
        "Jade: You mean with you? [Jade laughs] Have you seen Luke?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, he was here a minute ago, but he split. Can't figure out why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: She has every right to be mad. And I have no right to be jealous.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Will: I really want her back, and I keep saying these things, doing these things, and she can't even look at me right now.",
        "Kim: Oh, for the good ol' days when I could cheer you up with a peanut butter sandwich with the crusts cut off.",
        "Will: I had one for breakfast.",
        "Kim: Well, unfortunately, the good ol' days are gone. And you're not a kid anymore. You are married. You have made some pretty adult mistakes. And I would say the bottom line is either you have to grow up or you're gonna lose her. And walking around beating yourself up and saying that it's all your fault and saying what a bad guy you are --",
        "Will: It's true.",
        "Kim: Well, it doesn't help. It's a lot of noise, it's just a distraction. So you're really angry with yourself, you're feeling guilty, but what I want to know is -- have you made any changes? Have you taken the time figure out some kind of concrete things you can do to prove to Gwen that she can trust you again? Have you figured out if you want to spend the next week, or days, or months, or however long it takes to prove that you're reliable, to prove that you're really grown up.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Kim: Well, and?",
        "Will: I don't know if I can do it right now.",
        "Kim: Listen to me -- I'm not sure that anybody your age should be expected to be as adult as you're gonna need to be. But the fact is, you did get married, you did make a commitment, and you cannot be a boy any longer. You have to be a man.",

        "Carly: You first --",
        "Simon: After you -- oh, I know. We'll flip a coin.",
        "Carly: No, no. I always lose those things. So you just go ahead. You go first.",
        "Simon: Okay. We kissed last night.",
        "Carly: We did? Slipped my mind.",
        "Simon: Yeah. And it would be highly inaccurate for me to say that I didn't enjoy it.",
        "Carly: And we both know that you're a man who loves accuracy.",
        "Simon: Yeah. And, well, clearly kissing you was most excellent, and some might say, and I realize now it's not a clich\u00e9 -- I may have seen fireworks.",
        "Carly: Take it easy.",
        "Simon: But -- and this is a very important but -- you may not have wanted it and therefore, it may have been inappropriate.",
        "Carly: You're such a sensitive man.",
        "Simon: I'm trying. And I was thinking that nothing -- nothing should get in the way of us completing this apartment building and getting my investment paid off.",
        "Carly: Right. So, while kissing me may create fireworks for you, it doesn't pay the bills.",
        "Simon: Exactly. No, no, no, no. All I'm saying is that we should be professional, mature and focused on the big picture. And if smooching -- kissing should interfere with our working relationship, then we shouldn't do it again.",
        "Carly: Got it.",
        "Simon: Good. Hey, what were you gonna say?",
        "Carly: Same thing. Exactly the same thing. That we should just focus on the work, that finishing the job done is of utmost importance, and so that means no funny business.",
        "Simon: Good, none.",
        "Carly: Right, agreed?",
        "Simon: Agreed. To our professional working relationship.",
        "Carly: Right on.",
        "Simon: Uh-huh. So -- take off your clothes.",
        "Carly: And so just how is me taking off my clothing part of the big picture, business-wise?",
        "Simon: Oh, it's part of a new strategy.",
        "Carly: You know, call me when you grow up.",
        "Simon: No, see, taking your clothes off is just the beginning. Because after that, I want you to put on this.",
        "Carly: That's a Gorgio original.",
        "Simon: Why yes, it is. Direct from Milan.",
        "Carly: That would look so good on me.",
        "Simon: Why yes, it would.",
        "Carly: Simon, if this is your little way of apologizing to me, I accept.",
        "Simon: Well that, yeah, I apologize. And also, it's my little way of getting that marble supplier to speed up his delivery.",
        "Carly: I don't follow.",
        "Simon: I'm trying to be practical. You see, this guy's Italian, and this is an Italian dress, so you'll look like a blonde Sophia Loren. You'll hang on his every word, as he rambles on about shipping routes, and he's gonna be putty in your hands.",
        "Carly: \"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon Frasier. A man who enjoys ethnic stereotypes and demeaning women.\"",
        "Simon: I am also gonna demean myself. You see, I got myself an Italian suit, so we're going to dress Italian, entertain him Italian-style, grovel Italian- style, and we'll get that marble delivered Domani.",
        "Carly: There is something so morally wrong about you, but I can't help but like it. But I do get to keep the dress?",
        "Simon: Of course. I insist.",
        "Carly: Yes. So do I. All right then. I will see you later.",
        "Simon: Whoa, wait a minute. Where are you going? We've got to strategize.",
        "Carly: I have to go and talk to Jack about weekend plans for the kids.",
        "Simon: All right, fine, just make it snappy.",
        "Carly: Oh, Simon, you know how I hate direct orders.",
        "Simon: Carly, Carly, I'm sorry. Will you please be back here by 2:00?",
        "Carly: I'll do my best, Mr. Frasier. I aim to please.",
        "Simon: If you weren't so beautiful, smart and talented, I'd probably fire you. Damn it, Mike, I told you to clean up after yourself. Damn it!",

        "Luke: No, I just didn't feel like it.",
        "Jade: It's time that you get over Kevin. Just because a guy is hot doesn't mean he's worth your time.",

        "Maddie: Oh, actually, she called me and she wants me to stay here and wait for her to pick me up.",
        "Henry: So she cleared that with the cops?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm, yeah. I guess so. So, she's gonna be here any minute, so you can just --",
        "Henry: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Maddie: Henry, I know you care about me and you want to protect me, but I just saw Gwen and Casey and -- and I kind of want to be alone.",
        "Henry: Yeah, okay. Well, I'm not leaving.",
        "Maddie: Henry, just go wait in the car. I'll be fine. I'll just wait here until Eve gets here, okay?",
        "Henry: Okay. I'll be right around the corner.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Henry: Okay. You take care of yourself. And call me when you and Eve get to Chicago. Hmm?",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Henry: I'm right around the corner.",
        "Maddie: Okay. I'm fine. Eve, it's me --",
        "Eve: Is everything okay?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, it's great, really. I just decided not to go with you to Bernadette's with you.",
        "Eve: But we decided that that's what would be best.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know, but I talked to Henry and he wants me to stay with him and I said that I would.",
        "Eve: But, do you really think that's what you need right now?",
        "Maddie: I really just don't feel like going away. And you know Bernadette and I don't get along.",
        "Eve: Honey, she's your sister. I know she can be controlling sometimes, but she loves you.",
        "Maddie: I'm used to the way things are here. And I don't want any changes. Can you understand?",
        "Eve: Okay, well, if you have any second thoughts, call me.",
        "Maddie: I will call you, I promise. Hi, I am calling for information on busses going to Raven Lake.",

        "Jade: We had this all planned out.",
        "Luke: You certainly did.",
        "Jade: Think about it. I'm willing to go to this stupid lake where there's campfires and bugs and many, many other things that I despise just to see if I have a chance with Will. That's how important this is to me. And you just decide no?",
        "Luke: Right.",
        "Jade: I thought you'd support me.",
        "Luke: Look, I was gonna. Until I got a preview of this weekend would be like with Kevin and his Cro-Magnon friends and i decided.",

        "Jade: I've just been thinking about myself.",

        "Jade: You don't need to go to the lake to support me. You need to go for yourself.",
        "Luke: Man, that's great. I didn't even see that one coming.",
        "Jade: I'm serious.",
        "Luke: So, what, all of the sudden, magically, what's good for you is now good for me?",
        "Jade: I'm really not joking right now, Luke.",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Jade: Because who the hell is Kevin to pass judgment on you anyway? I mean, he's got the IQ of lettuce. And what the hell happened to my old friend Luke, who stood up to his parents, who's got more guts than anybody I know? Since when are you hiding out in your house from Kevin?",
        "Luke: Do you know how scary life is when you think to yourself, \"Jade is right\"?",
        "Jade: I want to go to the lake with my old friend Luke.",
        "Luke: Hey, I think -- what I'm scared of --",
        "Jade: Yeah?",
        "Luke: It's not Kevin or what he thinks about me. It's just -- I know I can't keep this up much longer. Eventually, he's gonna say one more stupid thing and I'm just -- I'm gonna lose it and I'm gonna tell him off and then -- I'm out. To him. Which probably means I'll be out to the whole school.",
        "Jade: That's what you want.",
        "Luke: Yes, it's what I want, but on my terms. With my timing. With Kevin acting the way he is, I feel like -- like I'm out of control.",
        "Jade: Maybe you are.",
        "Luke: Maybe I am. But you're right -- that shouldn't mean that I hide.",
        "Jade: Look, I don't have to do what you have to do. I don't know what that feels like. But I do know you're man enough to handle it. Really.",

        "Jack: Well, that was a stupid question. Of course everything's not okay. I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: No -- no, no, no, I knew what you meant. And it is okay. Its better -- to know about Louis. Today feels like a beginning and I haven't felt that way in a really long time.",

        "Eve: Before, when I said I knew what you meant -- I think it's because with you, I feel -- connected in a way I haven't felt in a really long time. I just want you to know how much you helped me through this.",
        "Jack: No, you helped yourself through it. I'm just glad I got to know you. And I hope that I was some kind of help, you know?",

        "Jack: 'Cause if you really want to let me have it, then we can go into the interrogation room. It's soundproof.",
        "Carly: You know what, Jack? I'm not even gonna raise my voice. There's no need.",
        "Jack: Eve's been through a lot, lately, okay? The last thing she needs is to be subjected to your analysis of our situation.",
        "Carly: You did a good thing.",
        "Jack: I -- I did?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. My instinct was to turn and leave and you stopped me and that was the right thing to do.",
        "Jack: Well, to tell you the truth, I've been rethinking that decision.",
        "Carly: There was no reason for me to leave. And there's no need for you to hide anything in your life. It's none of my concern. Just as the details of my life are none of yours.",
        "Jack: How detached.",
        "Carly: How mature. Finally. So, I came to talk about weekends with you. But clearly you're a little busy. So, I will just e-mail you a list of weekends that you can have the kids. You can amend it and e-mail it right back to me. And we can handle this the way that adults take care of projects of mutual concern.",
        "Jack: Oh, I see. Our kids are now projects?",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, this maturity thing is still pretty new to me. So, don't push it.",

        "Eve: I'm sorry. I get the feeling that I've complicated your life.",
        "Jack: Some complications are good. You're a pretty good one. It's sad you can't stick around, actually.",
        "Eve: Well -- I don't think I'll be gone forever.",
