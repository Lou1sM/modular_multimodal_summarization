        "Alison receives good news on one of her nursing tests. Aaron thinks since her career is starting to take shape, she should focus on them. Dani needs a favor from Chris. Alison admits that she loves Aaron, as he hides a ring box from her and offers to make her lunch. Dani needs to see violent crime records from the Morgue so Chris introduces her to the man she needs to speak with. Lisa tries to keep Lily from bumping into Carly at Fashions. Holden leaves the Lakeview restaurant when Mike walks in. Aaron hides his engagement ring for Alison in her sandwich and when she sees it, she is shocked by Aaron's proposal. Carly and Lily have an awkward meeting, as Sage is invited by Natalie to hang out at her house. Lily matter-of-factly tells Carly that Holden is all hers since he signed the separation papers. Mike tries to talk with Holden; if he wants Lily back, he needs to be honest and tell her, but if not then he needs to let her go. Holden tells Mike that it is over, but he doesn't have to like watching his wife with him. Alison tells Aaron that she is unsure how to feel; she thinks they are just getting back together as a couple and isn't sure they should rush it. Aaron understands but suggests Alison wear the ring for a few days to see how it feels. Faith doesn't react well to hearing her mom is going on another date with Mike. Dani faints into Chris' arms when she sees Mort about to autopsy a gun shot victim. Carly calls Holden to tell him what Lily told her. Carly is glad to no longer feel like a home wrecker since Lily gave them permission; she suggests a real date. Dani asks Chris out for lunch. Susan shares Alison's good news with Chris and mentions how Aaron told her that Alison has something to show her. Alison stares at her ring, as she contemplates a decision. Mike offers to take Lily and the girls to MagicLand Amusement Park with his VIP passes. Natalie and Sage are thrilled, but after they go to get ready, Faith wonders if Mike is trying to buy them off. Mike wants her to give him a chance because she might have fun, but Faith seems protective of her dad. Carly and Holden have their date; they are awkward and don't have much interesting to say to one another. Carly is confused as to why this is. After they go upstairs and Carly thinks the passion isn't there when they are finally allowed to see one another because it was no longer sexy or mysterious. Carly thinks they were kidding themselves and it was just he fun and exciting at the time. A dejected Carly leaves Holden's room. Mike manages to show Faith, Natalie and Sage a great time, as well as win them big stuffed animals too; he seems to be slowly winning Faith over. Holden shows up at Carly's and tells her that she was wrong about everything and he will show her, as he kisses her passionately. Alison snaps at Chris when he sees her hiding her hand. She doesn't want him to see the ring, but he was just trying to help thinking she was hiding a rash from the after effects of the poison. Alison tries to apologize, but Dani interrupts them and tells Alison that she is taking Chris out to lunch. Chris tries to stay and talk with Alison but she tells him to go. Aaron brings Susan to see Alison so she could show her the ring; Alison tells an elated Susan that she and Aaron are engaged. Susan can't wait to plan her wedding, but she is called away. Aaron asks Alison if that means she has given him an answer. Alison tells him that she has and it is yes. Carly and Holden are sitting on the floor in a blanket when Sage arrives home; Holden is able to hide before she gets in the house though. Holden listens while Sage tells Carly about how Mike is Aunt Lily's boyfriend and then about how much fun they had at the amusement park with Mike and about plans Mike has to take them to the car races soon. After Sage goes upstairs, Carly ushers Holden out and worries about what he heard. Holden promises her that he is ok and that he isn't thinking of Mike or Lily right now \u0096 only her, as he hugs her, but his face says something different."

        "Alison: I passed. At the least, I passed. I have to have at least passed. Oh, my God!",
        "Aaron: What's wrong? What happened?",
        "Alison: Oh, my God! You're looking at someone who just got a B-plus on her Chemistry exam.",
        "Aaron: Yes! Yoo-hoo!",
        "Alison: Oh, wait. Careful. Your shoulder. Your shoulder.",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey, hey, if I hurt something, uh, Memorial's top nursing student can fix it!",
        "Alison: Top nursing student. Yeah, right.",
        "Aaron: It's just a matter of time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I really feel like, you know, things are starting to come together for me, you know? Like the classes are finally starting to make sense.",
        "Aaron: Hey, I knew they would. You just had to relax and let it happen.",
        "Alison: Whatever was -- whatever was wrong before, whatever was messing up in my brain, it's gone now. Like a miracle.",
        "Aaron: As far as I can tell, there's only one question.",
        "Alison: How long will it last?",
        "Aaron: Do you love me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: There you are, Chris! I've been looking for you everywhere.",
        "Chris: Hey, Dani. How's the new job going? Breaking the bank? Buying that bottle of Latour?",
        "Dani: Mais bien sur. But I couldn't have managed it without you. In fact, I was kind of hoping you could help me out again.",
        "Chris: Sorry. The last thing I need right now's a really expensive hangover.",
        "Dani: That is not exactly the type of help I was looking for yet. What I need right now is someone with primo connections here at the hospital.",
        "Chris: Well, I guess I have some influence with the powers that be.",
        "Dani: Great, because I need you to hook me up with some dead people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I didn't mean to freak you out.",
        "Alison: You're not. You're not. Uh, when I left the hospital, they told me to stay hydrated.",
        "Aaron: It was a close call, Ali.",
        "Alison: It was for both of us.",
        "Aaron: Exactly. And when you go through something like that, I mean, that's when you start asking those tough questions, you know?",
        "Alison: Like whether I love you or not?",
        "Aaron: When Dani asked if I was your boyfriend and you said yes, I just -- I don't know, I --",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Aaron: Was I totally off base?",
        "Alison: No. Of course I love you. I loved you since the moment I laid eyes on you. Do you want me to start another fire to prove it?",
        "Aaron: No, no. I think Grandma likes her barn the way it is.",
        "Alison: What brought this all on?",
        "Aaron: I'm just wondering. It might make a difference in the menu.",
        "Alison: Are you feeling okay?",
        "Aaron: I'm feeling fine. I feeling -- I feel great.",
        "Alison: You're acting a little funny.",
        "Aaron: Well, I'm glad to know that I can still surprise you. Can you go to the fridge and get some lettuce for me? Please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Dani, meet Mort.",
        "Dani: The French word for \"Death.\" You're kidding, right? I mean, no, that's not to say -- it's a really nice name if that is your name.",
        "Mr. Mort: Dr. Hughes can never resist making that joke.",
        "Chris: Now let me redeem myself by asking Mr. Mort here to show you the hospital death records.",
        "Dani: Um, only the violent ones, please. You're funny.",
        "Mr. Mort: Knock yourself out.",
        "Chris: Thanks, Mort.",
        "Dani: Stabbings. Gunshot wound, gunshot wound. Hollow point-- I am like a kid in a candy store.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Hi. What can I do for you, Lily?",
        "Lily: Well, I just found out that Fashions branched into kid wear.",
        "Lisa: Uh, yes. Yes. Yes, we have. Well, it's always wise to expand a clientele.",
        "Lily: Well, my girls need something fabulous to wear back to school. You know how important it is to have just the right outfit.",
        "Lisa: Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, I do. Why don't you come back just a little bit later because this isn't a good time.",
        "Holden: I will have some coffee and one of those blueberry muffins, if you have any left.",
        "Mike: Holden.",
        "Holden: Mike. On second thought, cancel that order.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I didn't see a sign. Are you closed?",
        "Lisa: No. No, I'm not closed. Not exactly. It's just, as I said, this is not a good time. So if you'll just take the girls and go out and come back a little bit later, I'll spend all the time I can and get them something spectacular for school, huh? It's just -- oh, it's just so busy.",
        "Lily: Busy? Yeah, yeah, you're really hopping in here. Lisa, did I do something to offend you? I mean, because if I did -- if I said anything --",
        "Lisa: No, Honey. Of course not. It's nothing like that, believe me.",
        "Lily: Okay, well good. Well, then, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna look around. You can do whatever you need to do. And then when you have the time --",
        "Carly: Hi, Lily.",
        "Lily: Carly. Thank you, Lisa, but you don't need to jump through hoops to keep me from seeing Carly.",
        "Lisa: Well, I heard about what happened with the car, and I just -- well, I didn't want another incident here because it's hard to get blood out of silk, you know.",
        "Lily: I can assure you, there won't be any violence. I mean, at least not on my part.",
        "Carly: Not mine either.",
        "Lily: See? No problem.",
        "Natalie: Is Sage with you?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, she's just over at her dance class. It'll be out any minute.",
        "Natalie: Can Sage sleep over tonight?",
        "Lily: Well, that's up to Sage and her mother.",
        "Natalie: Please? Can she?",
        "Carly: I'm sure she'd like that.",
        "Lily: All right. Why don't you girls go see Sage and tell her that she's welcome to spend the night if she wants?",
        "Carly: Bye, Nat. Faith. I should go.",
        "Lily: Don't. There's something that I need to tell you.",
        "Carly: I thought that you had already said everything that you need to say to me, Lily.",
        "Lily: Not this. Holden and I signed the papers. We are legally separated.",
        "Carly: Oh, Lily.",
        "Lily: For a second there, I could almost believe you were sorry.",
        "Carly: I am. I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: Well, don't be. It's official now. Holden's all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Holden, wait. We live in the same town. We live in the same hotel. We can't avoid each other all the time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're right. But sometimes it's easy. Like now. See ya.",
        "Mike: You need to understand that I am not trying to get between you and Lily.",
        "Holden: You're sleeping with my wife. I would call that getting between us. Wouldn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: There is nothing between Holden and me. I've told you that.",
        "Lily: And you've been so honest with me in the past, Carly.",
        "Carly: Lily, the last thing that I am thinking about is a relationship with anybody, least of all Holden, really.",
        "Lily: And how long is that gonna last? How long have you ever actually gone without a man in your life? And now there's no reason for it not to be Holden.",
        "Carly: You can't be serious.",
        "Lily: Well, if we're separated, it means he can see whoever he wants, and so can I.",
        "Carly: I'm pretty sure he doesn't want that.",
        "Lily: When he signed the agreement, it was a pretty clear indication of what he didn't want. Now you guys could feel free to move on with your lives. I certainly intend to.",
        "Lisa: Am I crazy, or did she just give you the green light with her husband?",
        "Carly: That's just about the size of it.",
        "Lisa: So, you're not gonna go for it, huh? Oh, I mean the dress.",
        "Carly: Oh. You know something, Lisa, I think I'll take this one after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: If you want to be with Lily, then tell her that. If you don't, don't.",
        "Holden: And if I do?",
        "Mike: Then I would step back if that's what Lily wanted me to do. But either way, you need to make it clear whether you two have a future or not.",
        "Holden: It's clear. Our marriage is over.",
        "Mike: Then you have no reason to object my seeing Lily.",
        "Holden: No. No reason at all. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Here you go. You have to put your own mustard on.",
        "Alison: Well, I see I'm getting the royal treatment from you today. Can I have a knife?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Knife. Okay. Knife. There you go.",
        "Alison: Well, this is a steak knife. Do you have a butter knife?",
        "Aaron: All the butter knives are dirty. You should go ahead and use that. Go ahead.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: What's wrong now?",
        "Alison: Oh, is this that grainy kind?",
        "Aaron: Uh, yeah. Just go ahead and try it. If you don't like it, I'll just -- I'll make you another sandwich.",
        "Alison: Two sandwiches in one day? Ooh, you spoil me. What is this?",
        "Aaron: Will you marry me? Whoa!",
        "Aaron: I love you, Alison. And I want to keep loving you for as long as I live. You know, what we just went through just made me realize how -- how short life is. We came really close to losing each other.",
        "Alison: I don't like to think about it.",
        "Aaron: I know, but listen, it's true. It's true. We need to stop playing games and just grab on to this great thing that we've had going for so long before we lose it for good. If you really love me --",
        "Alison: I do.",
        "Aaron: Well, what are we waiting for? What do you think?",
        "Alison: I don't know what to think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Mort: GSW to the chest.",
        "Dani: A gunshot wound? Are you kidding? No, of course you're not kidding. Can I stay and watch? Please?",
        "Chris: Are you sure you're up to it, Dani?",
        "Dani: Of course I'm up to it. I'm a professional with a degree in Criminology. I mean, we live for this type of opportunity. Stop discouraging me. Um, is it a revolver or automatic? Do you know if the shots were at close range?",
        "Mr. Mort: See for yourself.",
        "Dani: Oh, my God.",
        "[Dani faints]",
        "Chris: Whoa!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's not you, Aaron, it's me.",
        "Aaron: Great. The kiss of death.",
        "Alison: I don't mean it like that. I mean, my life has been so crazy lately, more than usual. It was only just a couple days ago when I really started feeling that way about you, about us as us again.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's good. I mean, us is good.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but us isn't the only thing in my life right now. There's school, and I'm only just now starting to get a handle on that.",
        "Aaron: So? I mean, what, being engaged is gonna get in the way of all that?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Maybe. I just know that right now, it doesn't feel like the right time for me -- for us to make a move like this. We may love each other, but it feels like we're a long way from being ready for marriage. Please don't be mad at me.",
        "Aaron: I'm not mad, Ali. A bit disappointed, but I'm not mad. Hey, at least it's not a no.",
        "Alison: It's definitely not a no.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Well, how about this -- I'll tell you what, how about you wear the ring for a while and see how it feels?",
        "Alison: What, like a test-drive?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, like a test-drive. And, you know, if you get used to it and like it for some reason, you can keep it on.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll try it, but I'm not gonna guarantee anything.",
        "Aaron: All right.",
        "Alison: Well, aren't you gonna give me a kiss or something?",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna wait for \"Definitely not a no\" to turn into a \"Yes.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You still talking to me?",
        "Mike: That depends. Are you still the beautiful, sexy Lily Snyder?",
        "Lily: One out of three ain't bad.",
        "Mike: You are three out of three, and you know it. Or if you don't, you should.",
        "Lily: You certainly know how to brighten my day. Listen, I want to make up for that date I ruined the other day. Ethan's at a friend's house, and the girls are gonna spend the day with Sage, so I thought maybe we could spend the afternoon together?",
        "Mike: Sounds great. I'll be by your place in a little while.",
        "Lily: I'm looking forward to it.",
        "Faith: That was Mike, wasn't it?",
        "Lily: Yes, it was.",
        "Faith: Are you gonna go on another date with him?",
        "Lily: Yes, I am.",
        "Faith: Why? To get back at Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: Carly? I didn't expect to hear from you.",
        "Carly: Hi. Uh, well, I guess I didn't expect to be calling you.",
        "Holden: How's Parker doing?",
        "Carly: Well, it's sort of a constant struggle, much like everything in my life. Right now, he and J.J. are away at a school retreat for the next two days.",
        "Holden: Well, a little time apart is probably good for everyone.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I hope so. Actually, that isn't why I called you. I ran into Lily today at Fashions.",
        "Holden: What happened? Are you okay?",
        "Carly: No visible scars. She just made a very strong point of telling me that your separation is now legal, and then she invited me to help myself -- to you.",
        "Holden: She did what?",
        "Carly: I know. I guess I was sort of shocked, too.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not shocked, I'm insulted. Where does she get off saying something like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Sweetie, I know this is hard for you to understand, but I need to move on with my life just like your daddy has.",
        "Faith: You mean, because Dad slept with somebody else, you have to, too?",
        "Lily: You know that's not what I mean.",
        "Faith: You know what, whichever way you spin it, it still sucks!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: If and when you and I decide to be together, it's not gonna be because Lily gave us permission.",
        "Carly: Think about it, Holden. Lily has basically set us all free to do whatever we want to do. And so, for the first time, I can imagine being with you without feeling like a tramp or a home wrecker.",
        "Holden: What are you saying?",
        "Carly: Well, maybe today is that day -- that famous first day of the rest of our lives. And if we want to be together, we can be.",
        "Carly: Holden, are you still there?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I am. I'm just -- I'm a little overwhelmed.",
        "Carly: In a good way, I hope.",
        "Holden: Yeah, of course in a good way. I want to be with you. You know I do. But it's just -- I put those thoughts away for so long, and now --",
        "Carly: It's possible. For the first time, it's possible.",
        "Holden: Where can I meet you? And when?",
        "Carly: Well, why don't we try doing something that we haven't done before?",
        "Holden: Like what?",
        "Carly: Why don't we go on a date like normal, ordinary people?",
        "Holden: Carly, one thing you will never be is ordinary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Oh, God! What am I lying on?",
        "Chris: Do you really have to ask? I'm just glad I snapped you out of it before someone tried to perform an autopsy on you.",
        "Dani: Oh, you think you are so funny, don't you?",
        "Chris: I know I'm funny, but you, my dear, you are absolutely hilarious. But, Dani, I got to tell you, the first time I saw a cadaver, I kind of lost my lunch, so I guess neither of us has ice water in the veins.",
        "Dani: Yep. Just the usual red stuff here. Guess the rest of me is pretty standard, too. But, you know, if Dr. Hughes would like to check out the merchandise for himself --",
        "Chris: Well, I don't -- I don't think mort would appreciate that, this being his domain, after all.",
        "Dani: Well, at least let me buy you lunch to say thank you for settling me up with the files and keeping me from getting sliced and diced.",
        "Chris: Um, I still have rounds to do, but when I'm done, I'll let you know.",
        "Susan: Oh, Chris. Could you hold up a sec? I just thought you'd want to know that Alison is making real progress in her nursing classes. She got a B-plus on her Chemistry test.",
        "Chris: Hey, that's great. It sounds like she really turned a corner.",
        "Susan: Yes.",
        "Chris: Have you seen her? I'd like to congratulate her.",
        "Susan: Yes. She should be here soon. I've been looking for her myself. Aaron called in. He said she has something to show me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What am I doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, Mike.",
        "Mike: Hi, yourself. Oh, hi, Faith.",
        "Faith: Hi, Mike. I have to take this upstairs.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, you know, it's no surprise I'm not her favorite person. As far as she's concerned, I'm part of the reason that her parents aren't together anymore.",
        "Lily: Which couldn't be further than the truth. It's just that, when she sees us together, it makes her feel miserable, and I know that I invited you over here, and I'm sorry, but she's just having a really hard time adjusting.",
        "Mike: Well, I understand. Of course she comes first. Rain check?",
        "Lily: Please.",
        "Mike: No. Wait a minute. I may have a way to cash in that rain check and in a way that makes everybody happy. Girls, how would you like to go to MagicLand Amusement Park this afternoon?",
        "Natalie: MagicLand? Yeah!",
        "Sage: Whoa, that would be so cool.",
        "Mike: I got V.I.P. park passes form a client of mine, so we can have all the free rides we want. We can get food. We can jump straight to the front of the line on the crazy coaster.",
        "Natalie: The crazy coaster, all right! Did you hear that, Faith?",
        "Faith: I guess going to MagicLand might be kind of fun.",
        "Lily: Well, great! Go get your stuff. Let's go!",
        "Faith: Are you just trying to buy us off?",
        "Lily: Faith Snyder, you apologize right now.",
        "Mike: No, no. Its okay, it's okay. Look, Faith, I don't think that I could ever buy you off, all right? But I'm not above renting the pleasure of your company for a while. With one condition.",
        "Faith: I knew it.",
        "Mike: You give me one smile. Just one. I'm betting that you and your mother have the same gorgeous smile.",
        "Faith: I look more like my dad.",
        "Mike: Well, I can certainly see the resemblance.",
        "Lily: Faith, get your stuff now. Are you sure you don't want to pull out while you can?",
        "Mike: Not a chance. I don't give up that easily.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Five seconds of silence. That's just what I was aiming for.",
        "Holden: Were you aiming at stopping my heart? 'Cause you did that, too.",
        "Carly: Well, why don't we start it up again over a drink, shall we? Thank you.",
        "Holden: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Holden: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Oh, the salad looks good. Uh, except for the radishes, of course.",
        "Holden: Radishes? I didn't know you didn't like radishes.",
        "Carly: It's more like they don't like me, I'm afraid.",
        "Holden: Are you allergic? Break out or something?",
        "Carly: Yes, hives. Itchy. Hives everywhere. That's too much information.",
        "Holden: No. I asked. I asked. That's funny. I've known you all these years, and I never knew that you were allergic to radishes.",
        "Carly: I guess I didn't think that it would make for stimulating conversation. So, Sage is really enjoying her dance classes.",
        "Holden: That's great. That's great.",
        "Carly: Um, is Natalie? She's taking ballet, too.",
        "Holden: No, no. Two left feet, just like her old man.",
        "Carly: And how is Faith enjoying her summer?",
        "Holden: Well, she's actually been a little bored since she got back from camp. She's been begging me to take her to MagicLand to ride crazy coaster, so I think maybe I might do it this weekend.",
        "Carly: MagicLand. That sounds good.",
        "Holden: So, is it radishes that just don't agree with you? Just radishes?",
        "Carly: Yeah, as far as I know. Yeah. Oh, is it me, or is this the worst date you've ever been on in your entire life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't believe it. They're all having a good time.",
        "Mike: I know, I know. But don't tell her I could tell. She'd rather die than give me the satisfaction.",
        "Lily: Oh, God, if we could just bottle this, make our lives so much easier.",
        "Mike: I don't think we'll need magic or even MagicLand, for that matter, to get Faith to come around.",
        "Lily: Yeah? Seem pretty sure of yourself.",
        "Mike: Well, when there's something that is important to me, I don't give up on it.",
        "Lily: Is getting along with Faith something that's important to you?",
        "Mike: Spending time with her mother is, and I think that would be a whole lot easier if we could all get along. We may even learn to like each other.",
        "Lily: Well, I can't speak for Faith, but her mother already likes you. Very much.",
        "Mike: I'm liking her mother a whole lot, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I just can't figure it out. Is it because we feel weird being in public together, or maybe because we're calling this an official date, or what? For the first time, we can't think of anything interesting to talk about. Why is that?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Carly: But you're not disagreeing with me.",
        "Holden: I wish I could. Maybe there's something I can do about it. Let's get out of here. Can I get you anything?",
        "Carly: No, thanks.",
        "Holden: You don't seem very comfortable.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm sure I'll loosen up in a minute.",
        "Holden: Maybe I can help you relax. Okay, what's wrong?",
        "Carly: Uh. This. And not in that sexy, secret kind of way. You know, I hate to say this, but I think, maybe without the guilt and without the sneaking around, maybe there's nothing really there.",
        "Holden: No, no. That's not true.",
        "Carly: Well, I think we might have to face the facts here. We go on a date, and we talk about radishes and dance class. Now we're in your room, we're sitting on your bed, and are we tearing each other's clothes off? No?",
        "Holden: We could be.",
        "Carly: But we're not. We're talking. And not even fun talking. Boring, \"Where is this going\" talking. It's like we just skipped to the breakup without even having the relationship.",
        "Holden: So, what are you saying? Are you saying that it's over before we even got a chance to get started?",
        "Carly: Well, there's nothing to start, just fizzled.",
        "Holden: Well, maybe we just need a little time, you know, to get used to the idea of being out in the open together.",
        "Carly: Or maybe that's not really what either one of us wants and we're just too afraid to admit it.",
        "Holden: No, that's crazy. That's crazy.",
        "Carly: No. Maybe we just convinced ourselves that we were these star-crossed lovers because our normal, ordinary lives weren't working for us and we needed something else to focus on.",
        "Holden: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you saying that I made up these feelings that I have for you to distance myself from Lily? Because that's not true. I would never do that to her, and I would never use you like that.",
        "Carly: I know you would never mean to, but we both know that, sometimes, people do things they never meant to do.",
        "Holden: I guess so.",
        "Carly: Ain't this something, huh? After everything we've gone through, we can finally be together if we want to be, it's even okay with Lily, and I think that we both realized there was never anything there to begin with.",
        "Holden: Carly --",
        "Carly: No, no! You know what, its okay. Sometimes, you just have to cut your losses and walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: I'd like a pink unicorn.",
        "Mike: Well, your wish is my command. Consider it done.",
        "Faith: My dad says all these things are rigged, no one ever wins.",
        "Mike: Oh, yeah? Watch me.",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Lily: He got it!",
        "Faith: You're never gonna make this.",
        "Mike: Watch me.",
        "Lily: Get in there.",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Mike: Yeah!",
        "Faith: You did it! You really did it!",
        "Mike: I did, didn't I? You know, I was right.",
        "Lily: About?",
        "Mike: Faith does have your smile.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Holden: Five seconds of silence. Just what I was aiming for.",
        "Carly: Holden, what are you doing here?",
        "Holden: I've come here to show you that you're wrong. This is not about me looking for a way to break things off with Lily. It's not about you looking for a distraction from Jack and your kids. This is real. What happened between us is real. Don't you ever doubt that again.",
        "[Holden and Carly make love in the living room]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Ali! I hear congratulations are in order.",
        "Alison: Not yet. I mean, I didn't definitely --",
        "Chris: Ooh, I didn't let the cat out of the bag early, did I? Your mom just told me that you got a great grade on your Chemistry test, and I just figured you'd seen the results, so --",
        "Alison: Oh, my B-plus! Oh, right. Yes, yes, yes! My B-plus, right.",
        "Chris: Attagirl. Good job.",
        "Alison: Thank you. Um, yeah, but, you know, my mom really shouldn't be broadcasting my grades all over Memorial.",
        "Chris: She's proud of you, and so am I. Something wrong with your hand?",
        "Alison: No. Why?",
        "Chris: You just look like you're hiding it.",
        "Aaron: Dr. Stewart. Hi!",
        "Susan: Hey!",
        "Aaron: I've been looking all over for you! Has Ali -- have you seen -- have you seen her yet?",
        "Susan: No. Oh, what is all the secrecy about? What's the big surprise?",
        "Aaron: She'll have to show you for herself.",
        "Chris: Is that the same hand you wore the bracelet on, because when the poison wears off, it's normal to have some redness on the site. I did where I wore my watch. Why don't you let me take a look at it?",
        "Alison: No. I told you, it's nothing.",
        "Chris: Then why are you acting so weird?",
        "Alison: I'm not acting all weird, Chris. I don't even know what you're talking about, so would you please just let it go?",
        "Chris: Sorry I asked.",
        "Alison: No, no. I'm sorry, Chris. You were just trying to help. I shouldn't have snapped at you.",
        "Dani: Chris, are you done with your rounds yet? Alison, you would not believe how great Chris was to me today.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sure I would.",
        "Dani: That gunshot wound turned out to be really fascinating after I got over my urge to hurl. I was hoping I could take you out for a late lunch and tell you about it.",
        "Chris: Ali and I are kind of in the middle of something right now.",
        "Alison: Oh, don't let me stop you.",
        "Dani: Oh, great. Let's go, then. I'm ravenous.",
        "Chris: Well, we can't have you fainting again because of lack of food.",
        "Chris: Congratulations again, Alison.",
        "Aaron: There she is.",
        "Susan: Okay. What is the big mystery?",
        "Aaron: Show her.",
        "Alison: You told my mother?",
        "Aaron: All I said to her was that you had something to show her.",
        "Susan: [Gasps] Is that what I think it is.",
        "Alison: Uh, yeah, I guess it is. Aaron and I are engaged.",
        "Susan: I'm so happy for you! Oh, that's wonderful! I'm happy for you, too! [Pager rings] Oh, oh, oh. I so hate to have to take this. I want to talk about flowers and dresses. Have you picked out your bridesmaids?",
        "Alison: You know what, go answer that page. We will have plenty of time to talk about all that.",
        "Susan: I am so excited. I'm so excited.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I think we've created a Momzilla.",
        "Aaron: So, does this mean that you've said \"Yes,\" you'll marry me?",
        "Alison: I think it did, and I think that it means you have to give me what you promised me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Well, that was one heck of a first date.",
        "Carly: I'll say. What do you think it means about us?",
        "Holden: Who knows? Can we just take it one day at a time, see where it goes from here?",
        "Carly: I think we both know where it goes from here.",
        "[Car door closes]",
        "Carly: Get in the kitchen!",
        "[Horn honks]",
        "Sage: Bye, Mike!",
        "Carly: Sage! Honey, I thought you were spending the night with Faith and Natalie.",
        "Sage: I was going to, but Natalie threw up on the way home from MagicLand, so I decided to come back home.",
        "Carly: Oh. Lily took you to MagicLand?",
        "Sage: Yeah, with Mike. Did you know he's Aunt Lily's new boyfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Staying?",
        "Mike: I think that if I stay, I risk losing the ground that I gained today with Faith, and I wouldn't be willing to settle for anything less than all night with you. Good night.",
        "Lily: Good night.",
        "Mike: You know, today was pretty amazing in more ways than one. Do you realize that you didn't mention Holden's name one time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: It was so cool. Mike had these V.I.P. passes so we could go to the front of the lines. Faith rode the crazy coaster like five times.",
        "Carly: Crazy coaster? Wow.",
        "Sage: And he won Barnabas for me.",
        "Carly: Oh. Hello, Barnabas. You're very cute.",
        "Sage: He also won some really huge prizes for Faith and Natalie, and he talked about taking Faith and Natalie to the car races. Can I go, too? Please?",
        "Carly: Uh, I don't know, Honey. We'll see, okay? Where you going?",
        "Sage: To get a glass of milk.",
        "Carly: You know what, you both have had a very long day. Why don't I bring your milk upstairs to you, okay? Hey.",
        "Carly: Did you hear that?",
        "Holden: It's okay. It's not like I didn't already know.",
        "Carly: No, it's not okay. MagicLand?",
        "Holden: No, I'll take her some other place some other time. Besides, Lily and Mike are the last things on my mind tonight.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lily: Then why are you acting like this?",
        "Holden: Because you're so set on having your fun, you refused to see how Mike can hurt our kids.",
        "Brian: Come camping with me.",
        "Noah: You want to talk to Brian?",
        "Luke: No. I want to check him out.",
        "Casey: What am I to you, Emily?",
        "Aaron: I'd like to make a toast to my beautiful bride to be."
