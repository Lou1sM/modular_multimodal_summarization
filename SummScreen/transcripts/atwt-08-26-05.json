        "Meg: He's checking in right now? Perfect. No, no, no, don't tell him I'm here, it's a surprise. A big surprise. Okay, Dusty. Let's get this back on track.",
        "Dusty: Sorry 'bout that. Wrong room.",
        "Meg: Oh, it's the right room. The reaction could use a little work, though.",
        "Dusty: Meg?",
        "Meg: In the flesh.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: Well, you said you hated lonely hotel rooms. So I'm here to fix it. So how about you drop that overnighter and come give me a proper hello.",
        "Jennifer: Oh! Everything okay, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: That's a good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Hey, listen, um, could you tell me how much longer it's going to be? I've been waiting a long time here, and it's very important that I see her.",
        "Receptionist: I'm sure someone will be with you soon. You're welcome to sit in the lounge, have some coffee.",
        "Keith: I don't like coffee, and I don't like this. This is not what I expected.",
        "Lucinda: This is an outrage. It's an absolute outrage! What is that man doing here? You, you, I trusted you. I trusted you. I thought you understood about my need for privacy. And what -- I've been here 15 minutes, less than an hour, and already you've betrayed me.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: That's not possible.",
        "Lucinda: Then you -- explain to me what that man is doing over there.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: Why don't we step into my office, and we can discuss this in private?",
        "Lucinda: He cannot see me. That's it. Forget it! Forget the whole thing. I'm out of here. I'm out of here as fast as I can get out. I'm out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right. I was saving this, but I got a surprise. I got free tickets to the Cubby game from the department. Huh? It's tomorrow at 3:00. We can drive up there. We'll go early for Giovanni's pizza, we'll see the game, and then we'll go to Ricky's for ice cream afterwards. Sound good?",
        "Tom: Yeah, sounds great.",
        "Casey: Yeah, sure.",
        "Margo: I've got an extra ticket, you can invite a friend.",
        "Casey: Like who? My ex-best friend, Will? Or better yet, Gwen, my worst enemy? Or you know what? Maybe I can call up Celia up in Montega, and she'll fly back. Oh, wait, she never wants to talk to me again because of Gwen's stupid lies.",
        "Margo: All right. All right. All right. I know that you're really bummed about this, but I was thinking that maybe a diversion will be just what you need.",
        "Tom: Come on, your mom's right. It might be good for you.",
        "Margo: Oh, Case, come on. What happened to you wasn't fair. It shouldn't happen to any kid, but once the paternity test results come in, you're going to be off the hook.",
        "Casey: Right. I sure want to be off the hook.",
        "Tom: All right, tell you what. I have an idea.",
        "Margo: Good. Please.",
        "Tom: Let's barbecue. Ribs, steaks, whatever you want.",
        "Margo: All right, come on. He doesn't offer that too often. We gotta jump on it.",
        "Tom: I have never known a slab of baby backs that did not pull Casey out of his deepest funk.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine.",
        "Tom: Okay, good. Then, why don't you go to the store, get the supplies. And Casey and I will refill the propane tank. We'll meet you back at the house, and we'll do this thing.",
        "Margo: Yeah? That sound good?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Tom: Good. Then you go to the store. We'll meet you back at the house.",
        "Margo: Okay. We'll do that. I'll see you in a bit.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Casey: Okay, smooth move, Dad. Now that you've gotten rid of her, what is it you want to say to me?",
        "Tom: I think you already know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Listen, Gwen, I'm sorry. This whole thing is snowballing out of control, and it's not good. It's not good for you, the baby or Carly.",
        "Gwen: I don't really care what's good for Carly, and I know she doesn't care what's good for me. All I want is to do what's right for the baby.",
        "Jack: Yes, we all do.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, right, as long as your team wins. But nobody has the right to keep me from my kid. Not you, not your wife, not anybody.",
        "Jack: We care about the baby's well-being as much as you do.",
        "Gwen: No, you don't. If you did, then you'd let me get custody of him. He's my son. You only got him because of Rosanna's accident. You hadn't even planned on having him.",
        "Jack: That doesn't mean that we're not gonna take care of him.",
        "Gwen: You won't love him.",
        "Jack: Gwen, we already do.",
        "Gwen: Not the way I will.",
        "Jack: It takes more than love, Gwen. It's hard work raising a child. It's hard and relentless, and I'm not really sure you're prepared for that.",
        "Gwen: Yes! I absolutely am.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know, arguing like this, it's pointless. It's in the judge's hands now.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but your wife's doing everything she can to influence him. And if she doesn't stop trying to get my kid away from me, she's going to be sorry.",
        "Jack: Now what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Gwen: It means if she keeps it up, I'm gonna hit back, twice as hard. She wants to throw mud? Tell her to be prepared. Because I will bury her in it.",
        "Jack: I'd be careful with your threats, Gwen. 'Cause if you start coming after Carly personally, you'll have to deal with me.",
        "Gwen: You think I'm afraid of you?",
        "Jack: This gets ugly, you should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: You know, I stayed up last night thinking things through when I realized something. It's never going to be over between you and me. I mean, how can you put a price on the life of a child?",
        "Carly: It seems like you're about to try.",
        "Iris: My life was destroyed the day you killed my son. I never got it back on track.",
        "Carly: Iris, I am sorry for that. But I was just a child myself.",
        "Iris: Is that supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Carly: Look, if I could go back and undo whatever happened, I would. But I can't. And no amount of money from me can change that, can compensate you for what you lost.",
        "Iris: Yeah, but it can sure compensate for the life I've been left with. You can help me take care of the family I've got now. You know, $200 was a start. It bought a few pair of shoes, a couple days' groceries.",
        "Carly: What is it you want now?",
        "Iris: Add a few zeros to that initial $200, and then we'll start talking the same language.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hendricks: I assure you, Ms. Walsh --",
        "Lucinda: It is Mrs. Washington to you.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: Yes, of course. I apologize, Ms. Washington. But the man you refer to is a pilot, I believe.",
        "Lucinda: I know he's a pilot! What's he doing here?",
        "Dr. Hendricks: He's probably delivering medical supplies. It's pure coincidence he's here at the same time as you.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, really. Yeah.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: You have my word. Your identity and the treatment you receive will always be treated with absolute discretion. It's not good for you to get so rattled. Your heart is racing.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my God. My pulse. I'll probably have a heart attack and croak. My family cannot know that I'm here, and they cannot know that I'm seeking this kind of treatment.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: I do understand. We'll make sure he doesn't know you're here, and he has no clue, and he doesn't see you.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but he was asking for me.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: Did you hear him say your name?",
        "Lucinda: He said, \"I'm waiting for her.\"",
        "Dr. Hendricks: He was probably referring to one of our staff that handles the deliveries. Ms. Washington, please, put your trust in me. I will take care of you. I promise.",
        "Keith: You know, I'm beginning to think this is a waste of my time.",
        "Blanca: I'm terribly sorry. I was detained, but I'm on my way. And I have the shipment for you.",
        "Keith: Well, good. Well, you know what? Maybe you'll have to throw me a few more dollars for the time I've spent here?",
        "Blanca: Of course. That's the least I can do.",
        "Keith: Okay, well, hurry up. Because I'm on a tight schedule, and I do not want to fall behind.",
        "Blanca: I'll see you shortly.",
        "Keith: Well, I'll be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, this sure didn't go the way I thought it was going to.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that makes two of us.",
        "Meg: Hi, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Hi, Meg. And sorry.",
        "Meg: No, no, don't apologize. I'm the one with egg on my face.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no, you are fine. I'm the third wheel obviously here. So I'll just -- you pretend like you never saw me, I'm gonna go to my room, and maybe there'll be someone waiting in my bed for me. I'll see you later, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Okay. How'd you get in my room?",
        "Meg: A little white lie here, a wink there. Do I need to explain it?",
        "Dusty: No. But why?",
        "Meg: Oh, that. It seemed like a good idea at the time. You know, a fun surprise.",
        "Dusty: I'm not very big on surprises.",
        "Meg: You just think you're not. You just need to loosen up a little bit. You have to admit, the place looks great.",
        "Dusty: Yep, you really outdid yourself.",
        "Meg: Okay, so why don't you pretend to come back in again, and maybe we could do it the way I envisioned it in my head. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you really think I'm going to let you get away with this?",
        "Iris: Well, the way I see it, you don't got much of a choice. I mean, you want to hold onto custody of your kid, right? Well, remember. All it takes is one visit from me to that judge telling him how you murdered my son.",
        "Carly: Why are you doing this? What do you expect to get? Especially when you know my husband is a cop, for crying out loud!",
        "Iris: Oh, please, tell me that's not a threat.",
        "Carly: I'm not talking about muscle. I'm talking about money. Do you have any idea what a cop's salary is? I'm a stay-at-home mother. There are times we barely make ends meet. So if you think you're reaching for some brass ring, you're way off-base.",
        "[Iris claps]",
        "Iris: Nice try, Blondie. But you forget I know about the kid's trust fund, the one your sister left him? Come on, tell me you don't want to get your hands on that money as much as I want you to?",
        "Carly: I don't have access to that.",
        "Iris: But you will, once custody is decided, and if it's in your favor. So if I were you, I'd be figuring out a way to keep me happy so that I don't blow your chances right out of the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I'm just trying to protect myself. I'm not trying to hurt anybody.",
        "Jack: Neither am I, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Then tell your wife to do the right thing and let me have my baby back.",
        "Jack: I prefer to leave this in the hands of the courts.",
        "Gwen: Why? You have children. You both have a family. Why are trying to keep me from having the same thing?",
        "Jack: The only thing I'm trying to keep is the peace. It's a legal matter, and legal matters should be handled in courts. This infighting between you and Carly is not helping anybody.",
        "Gwen: Tell her that.",
        "Jack: I have. And I'm also telling you. Let this case play out the way it should.",
        "Margo: Hi, excuse me, somebody. Hello. I need a cake, a whole chocolate cake to go. I need one of those death by chocolate kind of --",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah. Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: Um, okay, never mind.",
        "Gwen: No. Mrs. Hughes, please wait.",
        "Margo: You know what? I don't have anything to say to you. We shouldn't even be talking.",
        "Gwen: I know, but I need to say something to you. It's important. It's about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Dad, why don't you just admit it, that you think I'm the father.",
        "Tom: Are you?",
        "Casey: I already answered that.",
        "Tom: Well, yeah, under a lot of pressure. But try to put yourself in your mom's and my shoes? I mean, what are we supposed to think? Because you weren't even going to tell us you had this big fight with Gwen. And we would have never known if we hadn't walked in on you guys. It looked like you were to kill each other.",
        "Casey: That's because she's making stuff up. I mean, she's trying to get me into trouble to save her own butt. I'm not supposed to be mad? Why don't you just admit that you don't believe me?",
        "Tom: Well, honestly, I don't know whether to believe you or not. But I do think it's time that you level with me as your father, as your friend. Are you scared of what this paternity test is going to show?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I am. Deep down dirt and oil...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I got a busy day. And a very busy night.",
        "Meg: Well, that's that, then. Believe it or not, it wasn't even my idea.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, right.",
        "Meg: Really. Lucinda thought it would be fun for me to surprise you here. She even provided the champagne.",
        "Dusty: Yep, that's her favorite.",
        "Meg: You know, I already popped the cork on it. It would be a shame for it to go to waste, don't you think? Maybe we should have a drink.",
        "Dusty: Well, it's tempting --",
        "Meg: But?",
        "Dusty: But I shouldn't. I got a business dinner with Jennifer, and I'm trying to keep a clear head. Sorry to, you know, blow your plans.",
        "Meg: Are you sure they can't change?",
        "Dusty: Yep.",
        "Meg: Of course not. You're not here alone. Jen was wrong. I'm the third wheel.",
        "Dusty: Jen came along last minute, for your information. We're here on a business trip, that's all.",
        "Meg: Well, you know what they say about all work and no play.",
        "Dusty: It keeps you on top of your game?",
        "Meg: It makes Dusty a dull boy.",
        "Dusty: Meg, I thought we were clear on where we stood.",
        "Meg: Relax, Donovan. Don't make it such a big deal. You're the one who said you don't like traveling on business and ordering room service by yourself, so I thought I'd do you the favor and come keep you from being lonely. That's it.",
        "Dusty: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. But I'm just not that big on surprises, like I said.",
        "Meg: Well, you can't blame a girl for trying. Can you?",
        "Dusty: No, I don't blame you for anything. But you should probably get dressed.",
        "Meg: Or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: No surprise guest for me. Guess I don't rate like Dusty does.",
        "[Jennifer sighs] [Radio turns on] Oh!",
        "Jennifer: Oh, well. Party alone.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: I hope I've allayed your fears, Ms. Washington.",
        "Lucinda: I do want to give you the benefit of the doubt, Doctor, I really do, because this -- the treatment is very important to me.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: And to me.",
        "Lucinda: But so is secrecy.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: You have nothing to worry about.",
        "Lucinda: When will we begin?",
        "Dr. Hendricks: I'll go and prepare your first treatment session right now.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: You'll be most comfortable waiting here, I expect. Enjoy your tea.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, I'm not at all certain that I can keep this down, unless it's a magic potion.",
        "Dr. Hendricks: It's a special detoxification blend. I'll send a nurse in for you shortly.",
        "Blanca: So sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. --",
        "Keith: Oh, no names, okay?",
        "Blanca: Oh, of course, I understand.",
        "Keith: Can we get down to business?",
        "Blanca: Oh, yes, follow me.",
        "Lucinda: Routine delivery my eye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: These tests are run multiple times for accuracy. So the truth is that a positive result is 99.9% accurate. And a negative result, 100%.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Tom: Absolutely. So if you didn't sleep with Gwen, there's not gonna be a mistake.",
        "Casey: Well, what if she gets someone to mess with the tests?",
        "Tom: Well, that's not gonna happen, buddy, because they did the swab at home, remember? And that was supervised. And the same thing with the baby. So I'm telling you, it's just not going to happen. So if that's what has you so upset, you need to calm down. But if there's something else that's bothering you, now is probably the time to tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What? What? What do you want to say to me?",
        "Gwen: That I'm sorry about how this turned out.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Gwen: You always treated me okay. You were very nice to me. I don't hold any of this against you.",
        "Margo: What do you mean, \"any of this\"?",
        "Gwen: The way Casey's acting. I know he's just scared. I understand that.",
        "Margo: How do you expect him to act?",
        "Gwen: Uh, I expect him to take responsibility, at least admit that he's the father.",
        "Margo: But he's not the father.",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about? Mrs. Hughes, the judge already knows. It's in the court record and everything.",
        "Margo: Oh, man.",
        "Gwen: I just want to get my kid back. And I know that you're gonna want to be a part of his life once I do. I mean, he is your grandson. I understand that.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God, I can't believe that you would ruin Casey's life like this.",
        "Gwen: What did he tell you? Did he tell you that I'm lying? Mrs. Hughes, Casey's the father. There's no one else it could be.",
        "Margo: Gwen, I just don't believe that.",
        "Gwen: Casey is the only guy I've ever had sex with -- ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How dare you? How dare you say that I'm after Rory's money! I made a commitment to my sister that had nothing to do with any trust fund. I'm not like that. I'm not like you.",
        "Iris: Oh, get over yourself. You're about to come into a huge chunk of change. Your family's set for life. And I'm still pinching pennies, trying to keep my head above water. Now, does that seem fair to you, after what you took from me? I don't think so.",
        "Carly: We still haven't talked about how much fairness we're talking about here.",
        "Iris: $10,000, and spare me the I'm a poor cop's wife routine. You know what they say -- when there's a will, and in this case, a trust fund, there's a way.",
        "Carly: And if I say no?",
        "Iris: Well, the judge is just a phone call away. You're a smart girl. You'll figure something out. And everything will turn out just fine for everybody.",
        "Jack: What will turn out just fine? What the hell is going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jack: Hey, you want to tell me what that was really about?",
        "Carly: What? What do you mean?",
        "Gwen: You believe me now, don't you?",
        "Margo: I don't -- I don't know what to believe.",
        "Tom: Test results are in. Judge is waiting for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I thought I made it quite clear, Iris, that I didn't want you anywhere near my wife or anyone else in my family, for that matter. So what the hell are you doing here?",
        "Iris: Carly invited me in, actually. Didn't you, Hon?",
        "Jack: I find that hard to believe.",
        "Carly: She just stopped by.",
        "Jack: What is it you want?",
        "Iris: Well, as a matter of fact, I've been doing a lot of soul searching these last few days.",
        "Jack: Soul searching?",
        "Iris: Yeah. I've been a very angry lady for a long time. Hasn't gotten me anywhere. So I figured it was time for me to let go of the past, of all that pain. And I -- I came here to tell Carly that I forgive her.",
        "Jack: Have you, now?",
        "Iris: Yes. Hating each other isn't the answer. I -- I know that now. In fact, I think we need to help each other through this, and help each other generously. Isn't that right, Hon? Isn't that what we were talking about?",
        "Carly: Something like that. Yeah.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm all for anything that will put this ordeal behind us. And I know Carly is, too.",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "Iris: You know, I just knew you'd see it that way. Now it just looks like everything is going to turn out right for everyone. Don't you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I need to know what's going to happen when this paternity test comes in. Are you the father of this boy?",
        "Casey: I don't want to talk about this now, all right? Mom's waiting, so can we just go?",
        "Tom: You know, I know you don't, but you can't keep running away from this. So I'm not gonna be angry at you, and your mom and I are not gonna feel any less of you if you're the father of this baby. But you need to stop being so scared and tell the truth. Did you sleep with Gwen, or is there a chance, any chance in the world, that you're the father of this baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: You know, I see girls like you, unfortunately, a lot. And you will say and do anything because I know that you're scared. You got will to lie about being the father, and now you're trying to saddle it on Casey.",
        "Gwen: Why would I do that? I'm not stupid.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but you are desperate.",
        "Gwen: Mrs. Hughes, I've never had sex with anyone but your son. I swear it.",
        "Margo: No, I don't think so, because he would never do that to Celia.",
        "Gwen: It was before he was with Celia. He kept it from her. Why do you think they broke up? She found out.",
        "Margo: All right, when did this happen?",
        "Gwen: At Joel's Christmas party last year.",
        "Margo: Joel Stansbury?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. It got pretty wild, there was a lot of beer there. We both had too much to drink. One thing led to another. And after it happened, we both pass out. And when we woke up, Casey freaked out. He didn't know how he was going to explain that he had been out all night. And I think he finally got will to cover for him with some story, I don't know what. Any of this ring any bells to you?",
        "Margo: Guess what, Gwen? You just have to have been to the party to know that he didn't come home that night. It doesn't prove that he was with you.",
        "Gwen: It proves a lot more than you want to hear. I can see it in your eyes. You know I'm telling the truth. Why won't you just accept it?",

        "Dusty: I'm here to work. Uh, I got a lot to do in a short amount of time. I can't get distracted.",
        "Meg: So it's not me, it's the circumstance?",
        "Dusty: It's you and the circumstance.",
        "Meg: So I guess there's no changing your mind then, huh?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Meg: Okay, I give up, you win. The lady's going home. But you will miss me in an hour.",
        "Dusty: I'm glad to see you're not too disappointed.",
        "Meg: How do you know I'm not completely devastated?",
        "Dusty: I'll give you some advice. I'm not worth it.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe I think you are.",
        "Dusty: You know, it's not that I don't appreciate the gesture. I do. But I'm getting worried now, because either I'm not making sense, or you're not listening. Maybe we need to set things straight.",

        "Carly: Why don't you take him upstairs? Put him in his crib for his nap?",
        "Jack: Sure. Good-bye, Iris.",
        "Carly: Don't you get too comfortable with this best friends routine. I haven't agreed to anything.",
        "Iris: Oh, yes, you have. Otherwise you would've told hubby everything, right now. But you didn't. Because you know what I can do to you. So you're going to get me those ten Gs, sweetie pie, and you're going to do it soon.",
        "Jack: Do what soon?",
        "Carly: Wow, whew, that was fast.",
        "Jack: Yeah, sound asleep as soon as I put him down. Anyway, do what soon?",
        "Carly: Just get together for some coffee.",
        "Iris: Yeah, you know, we should go to Java one afternoon. I go there a lot.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Iris: Boy, do you know, I feel wonderful. It's amazing how the act of forgiveness can just lift you right off the ground, you know? There's a saying that one act of forgiveness can erase 10,000 sins.",
        "Jack: I hadn't heard that one.",
        "Carly: Me, either. Well, thanks. Thanks for stopping by, Iris.",
        "Iris: Oh, my pleasure. Nice to see you again, and I'll talk to you real soon.",
        "Carly: All righty.",
        "Iris: Good-bye.",

        "Jack: Yeah, but do you buy the forgiveness spiel, honey?",
        "Carly: I don't know, Jack. People say strange things. I think that she's a little unstable, and we should stay as far away from her as we possibly can. [Phone ringing] Oh, I'll get it, okay? Hello? Really? Yes, great. Great, we'll be right there.",

        "Casey: I've already told you a dozen times that I'm not the father. I don't know why Gwen is saying that I am. And I don't know why you're having such a hard time believing me.",
        "Tom: Well, I want to believe you. So does your mom. We just need to make sure that you're not too afraid to tell us the truth.",
        "Casey: I am telling the truth.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Casey: This was supposed to be a great summer -- you know, the best ever. But thanks to Gwen, everything's gone to hell.",
        "Tom: Hey, come on, don't talk like that.",
        "Casey: About what, hell or Gwen? I'm sorry. I just -- I wish that I'd never met her. I mean, I wish that she would just disappear from my life. I mean, I just want this whole thing to be over with.",

        "Gwen: I'm not lying about this, Mrs. Hughes. No matter what he says. He's afraid to tell you the truth. I don't know why. You seem like pretty cool parents. I think you'd be pretty understanding about it.",

        "Gwen: You believe me now, don't you?",
        "Margo: I don't -- I don't know what to believe.",
        "Gwen: I just want a chance to be a mom to my son. I don't want any help from you, or from Casey, or anybody. I kept it a secret because I didn't want to put Casey in this spot. But then the judge made me tell the truth.",
        "Margo: Oh --",
        "Gwen: Look, if I was going to lie about it, wouldn't it make more sense for me to go back to will being the dad? I know he would've taken my back like he did the first time.",
        "Margo: Well then, why didn't you?",
        "Gwen: Because I was tired of lying. I was tired of keeping it all inside. And I bet, deep down, Casey's tired of it, too. I don't know why he pretends that it's not true. But it is, Mrs. Hughes. It is.",
