        "Luke is still harboring some resentment towards Brian for suggesting he might want to go back in the \u0091closet', and he is making his feelings apparent. Susan is throwing an engagement party for Allison and Aaron that night, as flowers arrive for Allison \u0096 only they are not from Aaron; Aaron peeks at the note and sees they are from Chris. Dani tries to ask out Chris, who tells her that he has feelings for someone else \u0096 Dani figures out it is Allison. Casey is offended when Emily doesn't want him to go to the family engagement party for Allison and Aaron. Aaron has a plan to stop Chris' advances towards Allison. Holden surprises Lily when he shows up unannounced to take the kids, as Lily tells him that Mike is taking them all to the races. Lily and Holden argue, as Holden thinks Lily shouldn't be allowing their kids to be around Mike because he could leave and therefore hurting their kids again \u0096 probably not the real reason Holden is upset though. Chris gets a text message from Allison supposedly telling him to meet her at the Lakeview. Dani and Casey commiserate together and then decide to crash the engagement party on each other's arm. After their argument, Holden explains that Aaron got engaged and that is where he wants to take the kids, as Lily is hurt that noone told her. Lily offers to drop the girls at the party. Emily is bothered when Casey shows up with Dani and drags him away. Aaron asks Lily to stay at his party and she calls Mike to cancel their plans. Brian asks Lucinda to go camping and mushroom hunting, as he admits to her that he is afraid he has lost Luke's trust; she is sure he will come around if he gives Luke time. Chris walks in as Aaron is toasting to his new bride-to-be. Allison doesn't understand why Chris is at her party and is even more confused when he says she asked him; Allison and Chris realize who set him up to show up there. When Luke finds out that Brian is taking Lucinda camping, he is worried and wants he and Noah to check into Brian. Allison is furious with Aaron for pulling that scheme on Chris, as they argue. Dani follows Chris to a bar after he showed up at the engagement party where he is getting drunk. Brian tells Luke that one of his references told him that he was checking up on him; Luke is skeptical so Brian invites Luke and Noah to join them camping, as Luke agrees. Aaron gives Allison a heartfelt apology, as they make up. Lily and Holden talk about Aaron and the past and agree that they should focus on getting along for the sake of their family, as they agree with a shake to make more of an effort."

        "Brian: You know, I don't think I can remember a time when a foundation strategy session went that smoothly.",
        "Lucinda: I think we're an extremely efficient team.",
        "Brian: I do, too. You know, it was Luke who pulled it all together. You have some very strong, coherent ideas.",
        "Noah: Uh, Luke's been thinking about this 24-7 since he came up with the idea, so --",
        "Lucinda: Well, now that we have such a strong mission statement, there won't be any problems at all getting big business to contribute.",
        "Luke: Well, unless I do anything inadvertently super gay. Got to keep an eye on that.",
        "Brian: I already apologized for offending you, Luke.",
        "Luke: And yet somehow I'm still offended.",
        "Brian: Then let me take another stab at this. I was just trying to give you a heads up on what you might expect from the corporate world.",
        "Luke: Well, Brian, my grandmother's had a lot more experience than you in the corporate world. She's never had a problem with me being gay.",
        "Lucinda: Luke --",
        "Brian: Proving Lucinda is more savvy than I, you'll get no argument from me on that score.",
        "Noah: I'm all for getting past this.",
        "Lucinda: I -- I couldn't agree more. Well, I'm starving. I'm absolutely starving. Come on. I'll treat us all to a bite. Okay, come on. Come, Gentlemen.",

        "Dani: Tonight's not good? We can do it tomorrow.",
        "Chris: Look, Dani, I like you. You're interesting, funny, and very pretty, and, I mean --",
        "Dani: Yeah, you're not dumping me, Chris. I mean, I'm just talking about dinner, you know? Salad, entree, a couple glasses of wine.",
        "Chris: And after the wine?",
        "Dani: First date, first kiss, first, second, third, fourth, fifth -- okay, maybe after the sixth, we have sex, then you'll be allowed to break up with me. But you won't want to.",
        "Chris: Okay.",
        "Dani: I'm that good.",

        "Emily: Oh, I love the way you say hello.",
        "Casey: I can say more than that. But, um, first can we get something to eat? I'm starving.",
        "Emily: Um.",
        "Casey: Burger at Al's?",
        "Emily: No, no. I, uh, have to go to Lakeview.",
        "Casey: Okay, that's fine. Let's go.",

        "Casey: Oh, a business thing?",
        "Emily: No, no, it's for Ali, actually. She -- you know, she got engaged to Aaron and my mother wanted to get the family together and celebrate.",
        "Casey: Oh, okay, okay. I'll change. We'll meet you at your place.",
        "Emily: No, I, uh --",

        "Emily: Well, only until the annulment's finalized.",
        "Casey: Did -- did I miss something? Did we just go back into hiding our relationship?",
        "Emily: No, I don't want to fight about this.",
        "Casey: No, just answer the question. What am I to you, Emily?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Maybe Emily sent the flowers.",
        "Aaron: Well, there's only one way to find out.",
        "Susan: Oh, you shouldn't you do that.",

        "Susan: What for?",
        "Aaron: It just says \"Congratulations.\"",
        "Susan: Oh, this is my fault.",
        "Aaron: You told Chris we got engaged?",
        "Susan: No, no. I -- I just was so excited about Alison getting that B-plus that I told Chris. I was just bragging. I didn't expect him to send her flowers.",
        "Aaron: That guy will use any excuse to come on to her.",
        "[Beeper]",
        "Susan: Oh, here, hold these. Oh, this is an emergency. Listen, put this out of your mind. I'll take care of Chris. Don't be late for that party.",
        "Aaron: I can hardly wait. Oh, Peggy? Peggy. Hi.",
        "Peggy: Hi.",

        "Aaron: Right, Aaron.",
        "Peggy: Nice to meet you.",
        "Aaron: Nice to meet you, too.",
        "Peggy: Uh, well, we don't usually give out a doctor's number, unless a patient has a question, so --",
        "Aaron: Actually, I got shot. And Chris was nice enough to make a house call and check me out. So I wanted to thank him personally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lily: You look nice. You going on a date?",
        "Holden: I'm sorry I didn't call. It was quicker to swing by 'cause I need to pick up the kids anyway.",
        "Lily: Pick up the kids? You can't. Not tonight.",
        "Natalie: Dad, we're going to the races with Mike! Isn't that cool?",
        "Holden: When is this happening?",
        "Lily: Right now. Sweetie, go get your sweater.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Lily: The sitter's already here.",
        "Holden: You know what, you go and have fun with Mike. The kids, they're coming with me.",
        "Lily: You know what? It is not fair for you to just show up here at the last minute and expect to take the kids!",
        "Holden: I shouldn't have to compete with Mike to spend time with my kids.",
        "Lily: Nobody is making this a competition except you, Holden. And you know what? It doesn't have to be an either-or situation. If you want to take the kids tomorrow, fine.",
        "Holden: That's not gonna work. Tonight is important.",
        "Lily: Well, then, you should have checked with me sooner.",
        "Holden: And you should have told me before you committed to this racetrack thing with Mike.",
        "Lily: You know what? The girls were so happy the last time Mike took them out. Are you so threatened by him that you don't want our kids to have fun?",
        "Holden: I am not threatened by that guy.",
        "Lily: Then why are you acting like this?",
        "Holden: Because you're so set on having your fun, you refuse to see how Mike can hurt our kids.",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "Lily: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Actually, uh, you know what? Noah and I can't have dinner with you tonight.",
        "Noah: We can't?",
        "Lucinda: Why can't you?",
        "Luke: Well, I forgot to tell you before the meeting, but Aaron got engaged to Alison Stewart.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Aaron is Luke's half brother.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and Alison's mom is throwing a party at the Lakeview, and we're invited, so --",
        "Brian: Well, I'm sorry you two can't join us.",
        "Lucinda: We'll just have to manage on our own.",
        "Brian: Have fun at the party.",
        "Noah: How did you come up with that party story so fast?",
        "Luke: It's not a story. And I honestly forgot. I guess dealing with Brian just makes me lose my mind.",
        "Noah: Okay, you are gonna have to figure out how to work with him.",
        "Luke: Yeah. But not right now. Come on. Let's go get changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm not going to spill my guts about my love life, or lack thereof, to you.",
        "Dani: Well, that is just not acceptable. If you won't go out with me, I at least have a right to know who's got your heart.",
        "Chris: No, you don't.",
        "Dani: So, I was wrong? It isn't Alison?",
        "Chris: If I explain things to you, will you drop it?",
        "Dani: You can give it try.",
        "Chris: I am still interested in Alison.",
        "Dani: Mm-hmm. And does she know that?",
        "Chris: It's complicated.",
        "Dani: Obviously, because I was under the impression she was all tied up with Aaron.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Chris: Uh, excuse me. I don't think Alison's as tied up as you think.",
        "Dani: Was that text from her?",
        "Chris: You know, Dani, I'm not trying to lead you on here. I'm not available. But if you ever need to get into the morgue again --",
        "Dani: I'll give you a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Casey, I'm going to the party alone.",
        "Casey: You really don't want to be with me?",
        "Emily: Yes, I do. Of course I do. It's just that Aaron's entire family's gonna be there.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and why would they care if we were together or not?",
        "Emily: Because they are not part of my fan club, okay? And I just wrote that story on their toxic land, and they're gonna be all over me, which means they're gonna be all over Alison.",
        "Casey: Okay, stop making excuses, please.",
        "Emily: I'm not! I'm just trying to explain to you why --",
        "Casey: Yes, you're trying to break up with me, and I don't --",
        "Emily: I am not try -- I am not!",
        "Casey: Good! You look as down as I feel.",
        "Dani: Just got blown off by Chris Hughes.",
        "Casey: Oh, good. What's his problem?",
        "Dani: He's got a thing for Alison Stewart.",
        "Casey: And why are you worrying about it?",
        "Dani: I happen to like him.",
        "Casey: Oh, well, Alison's out of the picture. She's engaged to Aaron.",
        "Dani: What? Engaged? When? Where did you hear this?",
        "Casey: Emily told me. They're having a party for her tonight. Well, aren't you family? Aren't you gonna go?",
        "Dani: My cell phone has been off since I was in the morgue last night. I haven't talked to anyone.",
        "Casey: The morgue? Uh, no offense, Dani, but this criminologist thing is kind of creepy.",
        "Dani: You are right. There is a party, and I'm expected. Are you going with Emily?",
        "Casey: Uh, no, it's supposed to be a family thing, I thought.",
        "Dani: You can come with me. You can be my date.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hi, Mom.",
        "Susan: Hey!",
        "Emily: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Susan: Uh, get me a club soda. It makes that champagne look so much less tempting.",
        "Emily: Okay, you got it. Hi, Emma.",
        "Emma: Emily, hello.",
        "Emily: So, it looks like we're gonna be family.",
        "Emma: Yes, it does. We're very, very fond of Alison.",
        "Emily: Right. [Emily clears throat] Uh, ex-excuse me. I'll just -- yeah.",
        "Susan: Hey!",
        "Emma: Susan, hello.",
        "Susan: Ohh.",
        "Emma: Ohh. My goodness, thank you for all this. It looks so beautiful.",
        "Susan: Oh, it was all so last-minute. I just hope I remembered everybody and everything.",
        "Emily: Mom?",
        "Susan: Thank you. Uh, are Paul and Meg coming?",
        "Emma: No, Paul sends his regrets. Meg's not well.",
        "Susan: Ohh.",
        "Aaron: Wow! This place looks amazing!",
        "Susan: Oh, thank you. I just hope all the people I called will be here!",
        "Aaron: Well, as far as I'm concerned, the most important person has arrived.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mike would never hurt our children! How can you even make an accusation like that?",
        "Holden: Is Mike gonna be in their lives forever?",
        "Lily: It's way too soon to even think about that.",
        "Holden: That's what I'm talking about here. Because this was a last-minute thing. Aaron and Alison are having their engagement party tonight, and I want the girls there. He's their brother.",
        "Lily: I didn't know Aaron was engaged. I -- I -- nobody told me.",
        "Holden: So, you know why this is important, then?",
        "Lily: Of course. I'll get the girls changed. I'll drop them at the Lakeview.",
        "Holden: Look, I don't want to interfere with your date. If you want --",
        "Lily: I said I'll drop them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You've made my son very happy.",
        "Alison: Well, let's just hope he stays that way.",
        "Aaron: Oh, I will.",
        "Emma: Guess what -- I have Julie and Caleb on the phone. They want to talk to you.",
        "Alison: Oh, hey, thank you. Hi! Yeah, can you believe it? We're finally going to be related.",
        "Holden: It was a good idea calling them. I know Aaron wishes his mom could be here.",
        "Emma: Yeah, it's too -- too long a trip for her as of yet. Uh, where are the kids?",
        "Holden: Lily's bringing them.",
        "Emma: Oh, that's wonderful!",
        "Holden: Uh, she's just dropping them off. She's not staying. Emily.",
        "Emily: Holden. Champagne?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Emily: There you go.",
        "Holden: Can you make it a double?",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "Emily: Sure. Finish this, and I'll give you another.",
        "Holden: Hey, hey.",
        "Emily: Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Remember the first time I did this for you?",
        "Noah: Of course. It was historic for me. That was the first time I ever wore a Windsor. [Both chuckle] You know, back then, I -- I couldn't imagine a life with you, and now I can't imagine a life without you.",
        "Luke: Well, lucky for you, Bubby, it's just beginning.",
        "Noah: Hurry up and get dressed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maybe I shouldn't stay.",
        "Dani: It is just a small family gathering. What is the big deal?",
        "Emily: The big deal is Casey's my --",
        "Casey: Husband? I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: Casey is my lover.",
        "Casey: Oh, that'll work.",
        "Emily: I thought I asked you not to come, Case.",
        "Dani: Looks like he disobeyed.",
        "Casey: Can't help it. I'm a bad, bad boy.",
        "Emily: Dani, since you're gonna be in town for a while, I have a little tip for you. Don't mess with my life.",
        "Dani: Lighten up, Em. Sometimes it's just about having fun.",
        "Emily: Right. Well, if Casey's having any fun, he's having it with me.",
        "Dani: Okay.",
        "Lily: All right, I will pick you guys up later. Go ahead in and have a good time, all right?",
        "Aaron: Lily, hi.",
        "Lily: Oh, hi. Congratulations. I can't believe you're gonna be a married man.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Hey, I saw the girls go inside. Where's Ethan?",
        "Lily: Oh, he fell asleep, so he's home with the sitter, but the girls are on cloud nine. They love a wedding. When's the big day?",
        "Aaron: Next year. Yeah, we're gonna do it up right, so --",
        "Lily: Oh, good. Be happy.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Aren't -- aren't you gonna stay?",
        "Lily: It's just family.",
        "Aaron: But you are family. Susan would have called you, but I just assumed that you'd show up with Dad and the kids.",
        "Lily: Well, uh, Holden and I aren't communicating very well these days.",
        "Aaron: I didn't -- I'm -- I didn't even think about that. I'm so used to you guys being together.",
        "Lily: It's okay.",
        "Aaron: Well, stay. Stay. This is a big day for me, and you belong here.",
        "Lily: Okay, I will. I'll just -- I'll just make a quick phone call, and then I'll come inside.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "[Lily clears throat]",
        "Lily: Mike, hi. It's Lily. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to cancel our date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Go on. This is the best hamburger in town.",
        "Brian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: I don't like hamburgers, but I like the mushrooms! Have some more. Have some more.",
        "Brian: They're good.",
        "Lucinda: I love them! They're fresh, and I love them. Every time I come, I gorge.",
        "Brian: They're good. They're good, but not -- but not as good as what you'll find growing wild.",
        "Lucinda: Well, growing in the wild -- forget about it. I'm not a mycologist. I don't pick my own mushrooms.",
        "Brian: Lucinda! I am horrified. You have never been on a mushroom hunt?",
        "Lucinda: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Brian: It's a fantastic sport and a culinary delight.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: You -- okay, I'll take your word for it.",
        "Brian: No, you don't have to do that. I'll prove it to you. Come camping with me, and we'll go mushroom hunting.",
        "Lucinda: You want to take me camping?",
        "Brian: We'll pitch a tent and do some stargazing while we're mushroom hunting. What do you say?",
        "Lucinda: Stargazing after mushrooming -- I mean, when was the last time I've had an invitation like that?",
        "Brian: I'll make all the arrangements, pick out the site, get all the provisions. All you have to do is say yes.",
        "Lucinda: Yes!",
        "Brian: One mushroom hunt and you will be hooked for life. You'll love it.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Lucinda: I'm beginning to believe you.",
        "Brian: Yeah. Now if I can just get your -- get Luke to believe in me again.",

        "Brian: I don't.",

        "Holden: You know what? It just -- it kind of caught me off guard, hearing Natalie so happy about going to the races with Mike. It just threw me.",

        "Susan: No, that would be entirely inappropriate.",
        "Chris: Well, I don't think Alison would agree with you, Susan, so --",
        "Aaron: I'd like to make a toast to my beautiful bride-to-be. It's taken us a long time to get to this point, and not because I haven't tried to marry Alison before. But we've been through a lot. We've seen each other through a lot of tough times. We've drifted apart. We've come back together again, and drifted apart and come back together again. But here we are, engaged. And, suddenly, it feels like we were headed this direction all along. Our hearts knew it, even when we didn't.",

        "Lucinda: No, no, Darling. I -- much as I would like to, I'm not going to demand that you like Brian. But I will ask that you give him a chance.",
        "Luke: I did. And he blew it.",
        "Lucinda: Well, he made a mistake. He's a good man, and I enjoy him. He's taking me camping.",
        "Noah: Camping?",
        "Lucinda: Ostensibly, we're hunting mushrooms. Would you believe?",

        "Chris: I got the message. I don't need to hear anymore.",
        "Alison: I don't understand. I saw you coming in to talk to me, and then you turned around and left. What is going on? Why are you even at the party?",
        "Chris: Because you invited me.",
        "Alison: Invited you?",
        "Chris: Yeah, it worked. You couldn't have been any more clearer. I can send all the flowers I want, but I'll never be the guy you want.",

        "Lucinda: To hunt for mushrooms. Now, it's very sweet of you to be so protective, darling. But Brian really has nothing sinister planned. He just wants to give me a little whimsy. And I'm grabbing it. So, have fun at your party.",

        "Aaron: Well, then let's fight over here. What did Chris say to you?",
        "Alison: You let me think you sent those flowers.",
        "Aaron: You assumed. You didn't let me have a chance to tell you.",
        "Alison: And what about sending that text to Chris in my name? Why would you do something like that, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: The guy's dense, okay? He doesn't take no for an answer.",
        "Alison: So you use our engagement party to get back at him? That toast was one of the sweetest things I have ever heard. But now I'll always be wondering if you were saying those words for me or for Chris.",
        "Aaron: I love you, okay? You never have to wonder about that.",
        "Alison: You used me to hurt Chris.",
        "Aaron: Okay, that was wrong. That was wrong, okay? I should have just looked for Chris myself and beat him up myself.",

        "Aaron: I'm sorry I upset you.",
        "Alison: Not good enough. Not even close.",

        "Alison: Yeah, that would be nice.",
        "Aaron: Explain something to me, Alison, okay? You're always talking about how you wish this guy would just leave you alone. Okay, and now he will. So what's the problem with this?",

        "Dani: I still haven't had dinner yet.",
        "Chris: Mmm. You wouldn't want to eat what they call food here.",
        "Dani: So we'll go someplace else. Ooh, I can see those wheels spinning. You still have a thing for Alison, but she's engaged, so that's a wash. But, uh, sitting across from you is this woman who you find very funny and interesting and very pretty.",
        "Chris: You have a good memory.",
        "Dani: That's why I graduated at the top of my class. I've got great analytical skills, too. Would you like me to continue in my demonstration?",

        "Noah: Well, they're businesspeople, Luke. I mean, it is after business hours.",
        "Luke: Or maybe he just made up all these numbers on his resume. I have got to find out what Brian's deal is.",

        "Emma: Oh, my.",

        "Susan: He's young. He's very young. And he's a Hughes. I don't know what Emily was thinking.",
        "Emma: Yes, I know. I'll tell you, I don't understand why the wrong people are together and the right people are apart. Well, anyway, Alison and Aaron seem to be relatively healthy couple.",

        "Brian: Game? Uh, I don't have a game. I -- I like you, I like Noah, I like your grandmother, I like doing good works, which is why I agreed to become the director of your foundation.",
        "Luke: So, that's it?",
        "Brian: Well, since I quit my other position to sign on with you, I -- I do need a job.",
        "Luke: So, you need the money, huh?",
        "Brian: Working nonprofits doesn't make you rich.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Sucking up to older wealthy women is so much easier.",
        "Brian: You should give your grandmother more credit, Luke. She's a brilliant businesswoman, and she's fun and fascinating. Why wouldn't I want to spend time in her company?",
        "Luke: Mushroom hunting? Give me a break.",
        "Brian: If you don't trust me, why don't you and Noah come with us?",

        "Aaron: Run that by me again.",
        "Alison: The old me. Whenever I -- I wanted something or someone, I would do something sneaky and -- and even illegal to get it. But you would never do something like that. You're too good, or at least you used to be.",
        "Aaron: Ali, all I did was treat Chris the way he treated you. The guy lies all the time.",

        "Noah: Don't feel so guilty.",

        "Noah: If you say so.",
        "Luke: You like him?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I mean, he seems like a straight forward guy. Look, it's not like he's some gay basher. I mean, he's been fine around us.",
        "Luke: Noah, he wanted me to go back in the closet. He wanted me to sell out my morals just so that we'd get some money. The fact that he's even willing to bring that up makes me think that he's done it before in the past.",
        "Noah: Maybe.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, I've got to find out the truth.",
        "Noah: You think all will be revealed on some mushroom hunt?",

        "Noah: Oh, yeah.",
        "Luke: What do you think we'll need to bag one of those suckers?",
        "Noah: I think we'll need some grenades, some tanks, some mortars. You know, but think how proud we'll be when we have a giant stuffed mushroom head on our wall.",
        "Luke: Ahh, well, you must really love me a lot to put up with all of this.",

        "Aaron: I'm sorry, Ali. To play that trick on Chris was just stupid. To use your name was low.",
        "Alison: Stupid and low. It's a good start. You know what else it was?",
        "Aaron: Inconsiderate?",

        "Lily: And our kids need you. I mean, no matter what, Holden, I don't want that to change. They adore you. And for good reason.",
        "Holden: Thanks for that. Um, I'm sorry I didn't let you know about the engagement party. I shouldn't have done that to you. And it was even worse to do it to Aaron.",
        "Lily: It's okay.",
        "Holden: Did you see him tonight? When he first came to us, he was so angry.",
