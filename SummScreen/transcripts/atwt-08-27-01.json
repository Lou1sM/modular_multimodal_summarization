        "Molly: Uh, hey, Hal. Hey, it's me again -- \r\nMolly. I was just wondering if \r\nyou took care of that favor that we talked about. Yeah? So what did Nick \r\nScudder have to say for himself this time? Oh. I see. Well, you know, that's \r\nokay. Because with the pressure, it's gonna make him crawl back under his \r\nrock sooner or later. Hopefully sooner, because there's no way that I'm \r\ngonna walk down the aisle with him playing a recording of the judge telling \r\nme -- sentencing me off to prison or some hologram of my mug shot \r\nhovering above the minister's head -- oh. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I know \r\nyou're busy right now, and I -- I just wanna say thank you so much, because \r\nyou are a lifesaver. Yeah, bye.",

        "Jake: So you're mad at me because -- because you -- you're just mad \r\n'cause you can't lie. Well, that's news. Why don't you -- why don't you tell \r\nme -- you know what? Why don't you tell me what you want to lie to me \r\nabout? Maybe I can help ya. \r\n",
