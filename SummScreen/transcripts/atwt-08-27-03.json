        "Jessica and Isaac tried to convince Bonnie not to tell Sarah that Marshall is a rapist, but she wouldn't listen. When Bonnie left for the shelter, Jessica tried to run after her, but Isaac and Ben convinced her to let Bonnie make her own mistakes. Marshall went to the shelter to pick up Sarah, but she didn't want anything to do with him, believing he had never cared about her. He calmed her down, and showed her pictures and told her stories about her mother. Bonnie walked in just as they hugged. Bonnie started to spill the beans, but couldn't ruin Sarah's happiness. Sarah told Troy that she suspected there was more to Bonnie's dislike of Marshall than she was admitting. Rick threatened to kill Susan, Emily, and Daniel, if Alison didn't help lure Susan to the house. When Susan called, Rick grabbed the phone and told Susan to come home alone. She gave Emily the slip, and arrived home. Rick held a gun on Alison and Susan, saying if they can't be a family in this life, they will in the next. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, Chris snuck in and knocked Rick to the floor. The gun went off, just as Hal burst in. The shot missed everyone; Chris has injected Rick with a sedative he had brought to calm Alison. Rick shouted that he loved Susan as the police dragged him away. Susan wondered how she could have fallen for such a maniac."

        "Marshall: You'll be living with me.",
        "Sarah: Do I have to?",
        "Marshall: Look, I -- I know it's a big change. But we'll get used to each other. Haven't you always wanted a father?",
        "Sarah: A father, yes. But not you! You can't make me go with you!",
        "Marshall: The court granted me custody, Sarah, starting today.",
        "Sarah: What?",
        "Troy: Sarah, look at the bright side. I mean, no more shelters, no more foster families.",
        "Marshall: Yeah, you'll have your own room, your own books, even your own father.",
        "Sarah: I can't live with you!",
        "Marshall: Honey, you're my blood. I mean, we've lost so much time already. We need to -- you know, get to know each other, find out what we have in common.",
        "Sarah: Like what?",
        "Marshall: I don't know, maybe the fact that we both like chili-burgers? Whatever it is, we'll find out, together.",
        "Troy: Sarah, this is a good thing.",
        "Marshall: So go on. Get your things, and we'll go home.",
        "Sarah: I'll run away. As soon as you turn your back, I will.",
        "Marshall: Why?",
        "Sarah: Because, Mr. Brilliant lawyer, in case you haven't figured it out yet, I hate you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You cannot tell Sarah that Marshall is a rapist!",
        "Bonnie: Mom, I love her. I cannot in good conscience let that man just step into her life and play hero.",
        "Isaac: He can play anything that he wants. He is her father, and you can't change that.",
        "Bonnie: No, but I can make sure she never lets her guard down against him.",
        "Jessica: Where are you going?",
        "Bonnie: To the shelter. It's time Sarah finds out who her daddy really is.",
        "Isaac: Leave it alone, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Whose side are you on?",
        "Isaac: If you don't know that by now --",
        "Jessica: Isaac is right, honey. You are out for revenge, and that is not the same thing as justice.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe you haven't heard, mom, but thanks to \"justice,\" the system has decided that a rapist is fit to father a beautiful, young girl.",
        "Jessica: Look, Bonnie, I don't like it any more than you do, but the law is on his side.",
        "Bonnie: You're right. He's a criminal, and the law is on his side --",
        "Jessica: He was never convicted of anything. His record is clean.",
        "Bonnie: Would you stop protecting him?",
        "Jessica: I am not protecting him! I am trying to protect you!",
        "Jessica: Sarah -- Sarah is going to be hurt if you try to bring her father down, Bonnie. Now stay away from that child, and for God's sake, just keep your mouth shut!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I can't believe that Alison is alive.",
        "[Susan crying]",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry we had to put you through this.",
        "Susan: I thought she was dead.",
        "Emily: I know, but listen to me. It was the only way. It was the only way we could get you away from Rick. But look -- look at me! It worked. Here you are. And you're okay, and he's never gonna be able to hurt you or any of us ever again.",
        "Susan: You're sure? You're sure? She's really and truly all right?",
        "Emily: Yes, she's fine. She's just worried sick about you. Chris took her home. He's trying to calm her down.",
        "Susan: Oh, she must be absolutely traumatized. And it's all my fault!",
        "Emily: No, Mom, it's not.",
        "Susan: I brought a monster into our family. I -- why didn't I see it? You and Ali saw it. Why didn't I see it?",
        "Emily: Because you loved him, Mom. That's why.",
        "Susan: Love -- I wish I never met him. I hope the cops find him. What if he followed me? What if he's out there somewhere --",
        "Emily: Listen to me.",
        "Susan: Hiding --",
        "Emily: No, no, don't think that. Listen to me! If Rick Decker comes back to this police station, it's gonna be in handcuffs. Margo and Hal are closing in on him now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Is this the man?",
        "Guest: That's him.",
        "Hal: All right. This officer will take your statement. Margo, I'm gonna take some uniforms. I'm gonna search the woods behind the house. You call Emily and tell her the bad news, and you tell her I'm not giving up on her.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Emily: Hello?",
        "Margo: Emily, it's Margo. An eyewitness spotted your mother leaving the motel pursued by Decker. We're searching the area.",
        "Emily: Margo, its okay. Mom's here with me at the police station. She got away from Rick.",
        "Susan: Did they find him?",
        "Margo: That's incredible. Is Susan okay?",
        "Emily: Yes. Thank God, she's okay.",
        "Margo: That's great. I'll tell Hal.",
        "Hal: Decker's car is gone.",
        "Margo: Oh, I just talked to Emily at the station, and Susan is there with her.",
        "Hal: She got away?",
        "Margo: Yes. Can you believe it? Finally, some good news.",
        "Hal: Great. Well, that gives us some time, but not much.",
        "Margo: Well, we better use it to figure out what Decker's next move is gonna be.",
        "Hal: Yeah, I know. We better catch him before somebody else dies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I stuck a needle in you. You were dead. The newspaper said you were dead.",
        "Alison: Don't believe everything that you read.",
        "Rick: How did you -- how did you stay alive?",
        "Alison: I put water in the vial instead of your poison!",
        "Rick: You little witch!",
        "Alison: No! No!",
        "[Alison screaming]",
        "Rick: You ruined everything! Go ahead and scream. Nobody can hear you. Now where is your mother?",
        "Alison: She ran away from you? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. You didn't hurt her. And you never will, because they're gonna put you in jail, you maniac!",
        "Rick: You don't think I can get your mother? Well, she's gonna be here in under two minutes flat, and do you know why? Do you know why?! Because you're going to help me, that's why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Hey, Chris. What do you got there, man?",
        "Chris: It's a sedative for Alison. Dr. Dixon prescribed it.",
        "Ben: Oh, she must be terrified. Is she staying here at the hospital?",
        "Chris: No, no, she's at home. I was gonna give her the sedative, hope it helps her calm down a little bit. But I don't think she's gonna get any rest until she knows her mother's safe from that lunatic.",
        "Ben: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Chris: Hey, any news on Decker?",
        "Walker: I just heard from Hal. Susan's safe.",
        "Chris: Are you serious?",
        "Walker: Yep, she's down at the police station with Emily. Somehow she got away from him. I don't know how.",
        "Chris: Oh my God, that's fantastic! I got to tell Alison. She's been going out of her mind --",
        "Walker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chris. Could you tell her in person, not on the phone? I don't want her getting in the car and trying to drive down to the police station.",
        "Chris: What part of this story did you leave out?",
        "Walker: Decker's still on the loose. The police don't know where he's headed. Where is Alison right now?",
        "Chris: She's at her mom's house. Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: What's worse for Sarah, mom? Knowing the truth about her father, or living in ignorance with a man who has absolutely no business raising a child?",
        "Jessica: You want to talk about the truth? Let's talk about the real reason that you want to tell Sarah her father's a rapist. Because you hate him, Bonnie, and you want to make sure that Sarah hates him just as much as you do.",
        "Bonnie: She already does, Mom. I'm not bursting any bubbles here.",
        "Jessica: Look, all I'm saying is don't ruin Sarah's opportunity to have a relationship with her father before it's even begun. And then if she doesn't want to have anything to do with him, she can make that judgment without your help.",
        "Bonnie: And what? Get seduced by his power and his charm, the way you were?",
        "Jessica: Well, hopefully, she'll be a lot smarter than I was.",
        "Bonnie: Mom, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that -- that did not come out -- what I was trying to say is that you are a smart, intelligent woman, and Marshall still tricked you. What does a 15-year-old girl -- what kind of chance does she have against that? That's why I have to go to the shelter. I have to tell Sarah what she's getting into.",
        "Jessica: No! No, Bonnie, look -- this is a small town. It's -- it's gonna come out, what Marshall did to me, sooner or later. Now he's probably trying to figure out a way to tell Sarah himself.",
        "Bonnie: And when he does?",
        "Jessica: Then she'll make her own decision, honey.",
        "Bonnie: Do you know who we're talking about here, Mom? We are talking about a man who hurts women!",
        "Jessica: No, we are talking about Sarah's father.",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Troy: Sarah, don't confuse being scared with hating someone.",
        "Sarah: Oh, I'm not.",
        "Troy: Then you have no excuse to speak to Mr. Travers in such a rude way.",
        "Marshall: Troy -- you mind giving us a few minutes alone?",
        "Troy: Sure.",
        "Marshall: So you hate me, huh? Well, why don't you have a seat, and let's figure out why. You know, I hope you're as -- as happy about getting a father as I am about getting a daughter.",
        "Sarah: You had a daughter 15 years ago, and you walked out! If you loved me, you would've found me way before today. But you didn't even look, did you?",
        "Marshall: Look, Sarah, I didn't know that you were right here --",
        "Sarah: And -- and when you did find me, you were mean to me.",
        "Marshall: Listen, certain people didn't want me to know that I was your father, and they arranged things so that I wouldn't.",
        "Sarah: Which certain people? Who did that?",
        "Marshall: Well, Bonnie. I mean, I'm not blaming her for all the mistakes that I made in the past, but when I tried to make things right, she did everything she could to make sure that we didn't find out that we were family.",
        "Sarah: Well, why wouldn't she want me to know that you were my father?",
        "Marshall: Because Ms. McKechnie hates me like poison.",
        "Sarah: Well, you must have given her a really good reason. And I want to know what that reason is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What did Hal say?",
        "Emily: They've got every available unit searching for Rick's car. We're gonna find him, Mom. I know it.",
        "Susan: But he's still out there. You don't think --",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: Is there any way Rick would be able to find out that Alison is still alive?",
        "Emily: I don't know how.",
        "Susan: We'd better call her and warn her.",
        "Emily: You don't think he'd go to the house? I mean, knowing that the police are after him, would he do that?",
        "Susan: We've got to call her and see if she's all right!",
        "Emily: All right, all right. Just calm down, all right? Call her. That's a good idea. We need to tell her you're okay anyway. But listen to me. That kid has been through hell. Don't scare her any more than you have to, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: There we go. Have a seat. Now we're gonna call Mommy.",
        "Alison: I won't help you trap my Mom.",
        "Rick: Oh, yes, you will. Because I can make people disappear, remember? And this time, there won't be water in the syringe.",
        "Alison: I won't help you get your hands on my mom.",
        "Rick: Oh, well, maybe I just won't kill you. Maybe I'll kill your sister and what's -- what's her son's name? That cute little boy? Was it Daniel? [Phone rings] I'm going to pick up that phone, and I want you to answer it in a normal, calm voice. Do you understand? Any hints, and you're dead in less than two minutes.",
        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Susan: Ali? Sweetheart, its Mom.",
        "Alison: Mom, it's so good to hear your voice. Mom, where are you?",
        "Susan: I'm at the police station with Emily. We just wanted to make sure you're okay. Ali, are you okay?",
        "Rick: Answer her!",
        "Alison: Sure. I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Susan: Good. We are, too. Oh, we're just waiting for Hal to call and tell us that they've caught Rick.",
        "Rick: Don't say a word if you want to see Alison alive. Are you listening?",
        "Susan: Yes.",
        "Rick: Good. Now come home. Come alone. If you tell anyone, I'll kill your baby. And this time, she'll stay dead.",
        "Susan: Whatever you say, Ali.",
        "Rick: Hurry home. I miss our little family get-togethers.",
        "Susan: Emily, I can't do that herbal tea. Please, just one cup of coffee?",
        "Emily: Yeah, sure. Listen, I'm gonna have the police send a cruiser over to the house, just to be on the safe side. I think that would be a good idea. Mom? Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: None of this would've been necessary if you had just been more supportive of my marriage with your mother. Oh, well. She'll be here soon, and then we'll just put an end to this once and for all.",
        "Alison: What do you mean by that?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[muffled screams from Alison]",
        "Chris: Alison -- open up. It's me, Chris. Alison, you can open the door. All the reporters are gone. Alison, come on. I have to tell you something -- and it can't wait. Alison, open this door, or I'm gonna have to break it down.",
        "Rick: Go away, Chris. Nobody's home.",
        "Chris: Alison, Decker's still on the loose.",
        "Rick: Now, don't say a word, or I'll kill you and boy wonder.",
        "Chris: Alison, are you there? She must've gone out. Damn.",
        "Rick: Too bad, Alison. Your boyfriend gave up. Or maybe he found somebody prettier than you. Ow!",
        "Alison: Go to hell, you psycho!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Uh, did -- did Bonnie tell you why she hates me?",
        "Sarah: She said a lot of things, none of which were nice, but -- I don't know. I don't remember exactly.",
        "Marshall: I mean, well, for instance, did she -- did she accuse me of something really bad, something that might have upset you?",
        "Sarah: No. Why -- why doesn't she like you?",
        "Marshall: Uh, Bonnie's mother and I used to date, and Bonnie didn't approve. But look, don't allow her personal grudges to become your battles to fight, okay? Hey, you know what that just was? That was my first bit of fatherly advice.",
        "Sarah: You're not my father just because you have a piece of paper that says you are.",
        "Marshall: Sarah, I'm your father in the only way that counts -- right here. I love you.",
        "Sarah: You don't even know me!",
        "Marshall: Well, give me the chance to get to know you. Let me in.",
        "Sarah: No! I wish you would just go away and never come back!",
        "Marshall: Hey -- well, look, I can't expect you to just run into my arms and call me daddy. But -- but that's who I am. It's taken a long time, too long, to find you, and I can't just walk away.",
        "Sarah: Well, then I will.",
        "Marshall: Before we even give this a try? Listen, whatever mistakes I made in the past, whoever tried to keep us apart -- I mean, however angry you are at me, none of that matters now. Not to me. I look at you, and -- and I know that I love you. I'm your father, Sarah, and nothing can change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The man is her father. Now think about what that word means to you and what it means to a child who's never had one.",
        "Bonnie: You're right, she's never had one. So she won't miss what she doesn't know.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, every time that little girl has been scared at night, every time that she has wanted a hand to hold, every time that she has wanted someone big and strong on her side, she has missed having a father. And now she has one. After 15 years, she has one. And if you -- if you tell her that that man is a monster, if you take away her right to love him, honey, she is gonna hate you.",
        "Bonnie: I'll risk it. I'll risk anything so long as it keeps her safe.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie --",
        "Bonnie: Mom, I heard what you said. But the decision is mine.",
        "Isaac: Bonnie left?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Isaac: She's going to tell Sarah about Marshall ?",
        "Jessica: Not if I can get there first.",
        "Isaac: You know, you can't run interference for her for her whole life, Jessica. Now, you told her that Sarah should make her own choices. Why don't you take your own advice? Let her go, Jessica. Let your baby grow up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Come on, Hal! Where the hell are you?",
        "Hal: I'm right here.",
        "Emily: Oh, Hal, Hal! Mom left. She was having a conversation with Alison on the cell phone, I turn around and got her a cup of coffee, and I turned back and she was gone --",
        "Hal: Slow down, Emily. Just tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Emily: I don't know what happened. Mom was talking to Alison on her cell phone. I went to get her a cup of coffee, I turned around, and she was gone.",
        "Hal: Have you tried calling Alison again?",
        "Emily: Yes, I did, and her cell phone's been turned off. I don't like this. What if Decker's back?",
        "Hal: I'm taking a unit over to your mother's house.",
        "Emily: I'm going with you.",
        "Hal: No. Emily, Decker's there, and if he's armed --",
        "Emily: He's got my mother and sister.",
        "Hal: I don't want you anywhere near this situation.",
        "Emily: Hal, this is not a situation, this is my family! And I'm going to be there, with or without your permission --",
        "Hal: -- I want a backup unit over at the Stewart house, and I want it there five minutes ago! Well, are you coming?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Chris!",
        "Susan: Alison? Alison, its mom. Let me in! [ Knocking at door] Alison!",
        "Rick: Susan, we've been waiting for you.",
        "Susan: Leave her alone! You -- leave her alone. I'll kill you, I swear! I'm gonna kill you --",
        "Alison: Mom, Mom!",
        "Susan: Oh, honey -- oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm so very, very sorry.",
        "Rick: What are you hugging her for?! I'm the one who's supposed to be able to count on your support! But you abandoned me, just like everyone else. Well, that's going to stop now. No one else is leaving me.",
        "Susan: Rick, I'll do anything you want, just don't hurt Alison.",
        "Rick: Oh, no, it's always about Alison! She doesn't care about you, not the way I do! I love you! I would've done anything for you!",
        "Susan: I know. I know. I want us to talk. I want us to figure this all out. Let's do that, Rick. Can we do that, please?",
        "Rick: All I ever wanted was a family. I thought I found it here. I thought I found a wife who loved and trusted me, a daughter who would come to me for advice. But you deceived me! It's all your fault! You turned people against me. You got people to doubt me. You got your mother to run away. You ruined my family.",
        "Susan: And you're very sorry about that, aren't you?",
        "Alison: Yes. Yeah, I'm very sorry, Rick.",
        "Rick: Doesn't matter. Because if we can't be together in this life, we'll find another way. You and I and our little girl are going to be together forever. For all eternity.",
        "Alison: Don't. Don't, please -- please, don't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: I think you should just leave it alone, Jess. If Sarah resents Bonnie and kicks her out of her life, that's the best thing that could possibly happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Alison? Anyone in there?",
        "Rick: You're too late, Hal!",
        "Rick: Don't hide behind your mother, Alison. The first bullet's for you.",
        "Susan: You will not hurt my child!",
        "Rick: I never hurt anyone. It'll be quick and painless, just like all the others. And then it will be our turn. It'll be so peaceful. You'll see, Susan. [Pounding on door] don't move!",
        "Hal: Open up, police! Susan? Alison? Anyone in there? There are doors around back -- go. Open up, or I'm coming in!",
        "Rick: You're too late, Hal. My family and I are off to ports unknown! And it's a far better place than this, and I'm ready -- ready to stop the pain. Are you?",
        "Susan: No.",
        "Alison: Chris! The gun!",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: Chris, be careful!",
        "[Struggling]",

        "Isaac: You're worried about Sarah resenting Bonnie? Maybe you should be worried about Bonnie resenting you. Because it's already starting to happen.",
        "Jessica: I'm her mother. And I'm not gonna let her do something that I know is gonna cause her pain.",
        "Isaac: Hey, Ben.",
        "Ben: Hey, Isaac.",
        "Jessica: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Ben: How you doing?",
        "Jessica: What are you doing here?",
        "Ben: Well, I've come to toast my brother. One last time, huh?",
        "Isaac: All right!",
        "Ben: You got a little something back there?",
        "Isaac: I do. I could actually use a drink.",
        "Ben: All right then.",
        "Isaac: Yes, one last beverage. I want to make a toast myself. To the mighty Dr. Ben, who saved --",
        "Ben: No, no, no, no, no. No, this one is for you. This is to Isaac -- you were a young man when you turned this old basement into Java Underground. And now, you're an old wise man.",
        "Isaac: I am. With very few grays and a couple extra bucks in my pocket.",
        "Ben: Oh yeah. [Glasses clinking] makes it all the sweeter.",
        "Jessica: Hear, hear.",
        "Ben: Hear, hear.",
        "Isaac: Mm, that is good southern cheer. Which reminds me, I got to get to my office and finish cleaning up. You all enjoy.",
        "Ben: All right, bro. All right. Well, how come you're doing that little thing you do with your eyebrows?",
        "Jessica: What thing?",
        "Ben: Something's wrong.",
        "Jessica: It's Bonnie. She's gone over to the Durgin Street Shelter to tell Sarah that her brand-new father is a rapist.",
        "Ben: What was she thinking?",
        "Jessica: She's not thinking. And Sarah is going to resent her for it. Now Isaac thinks that I should just stay out of it and let Bonnie make her own mistakes. But you think I shouldn't let her make this mistake, right?",
        "Ben: Wrong. Look, I think you should just leave it alone, Jess. If Sarah resents Bonnie and kicks her out of her life, that's the best thing that could possibly happen.",

        "Sarah: Don't say you're my father, and don't say you love me!",
        "Marshall: Sarah, I do love you.",
        "Sarah: You don't even know me.",
        "Marshall: I knew your mother. You know, when I look at your beautiful face, I see her. It's like -- it's like Neia's looking at me, right through you after all these years.",
        "Sarah: Neia?",
        "Marshall: Pretty name, isn't it?",
        "Sarah: Did she love me?",
        "Marshall: Of course she loved you.",
        "Sarah: You weren't there when I was born or when she died. How do you know?",
        "Marshall: 'Cause I was there when she found out she was gonna have a baby. She was very excited that you were coming into her life, and there was nothing that I wanted more than to see Neia happy.",
        "Sarah: You loved her?",
        "Marshall: Yes, I did.",
        "Sarah: Well, how did you meet?",
        "Marshall: Well, in college, actually. We were in a study group. We were making big, big future plans. And then -- well, then you came along.",
        "Sarah: You weren't married.",
        "Marshall: No.",
        "Sarah: So finding out there was a baby on the way, that kind of messed things up, didn't it?",
        "Marshall: No, Sarah. Your mother wanted you very much. When she found out she was gonna have a baby, she read everything there was about how to eat, how to sleep, how to exercise -- she was always smiling, always singing. She sang to you day and night.",
        "Sarah: What did you do?",
        "Marshall: Well, I -- I wish I'd been a better man. See, your mother loved you instantly, but -- back in those days, I was just too hung up on my dreams of becoming a lawyer. I didn't want anyone or anything to take that away from me. Because of that, your -- your mother went back to Brazil to have you.",
        "Sarah: Well, did she still love me? I mean, after I was born, even though she had to raise me all alone? [ Marshall shows Sarah her baby picture]",
        "Marshall: See that smile on your face? That is the smile of a well-loved baby.",
        "Sarah: I do look like her. [ Marshall laughs] I was so young when she died. I wish I could remember her more.",
        "Marshall: Well, you've the same mixture of strength and sensitivity that your mother had. Trust me, Sarah, you are carrying your mother everywhere you go.",
        "Sarah: I don't want to carry her. I wish she were here,",
        "Marshall: I know, I know. I wish she were here, too, but look, I'm here now, all right? I'm your father, and I'm gonna take care of you. I know I've had a late start in loving you, but I do. And I will never, ever stop.",
        "Bonnie: Sarah, there's something I have to tell you -- about Marshall .",
        "Sarah: I already know.",

        "Jessica: Bonnie is gonna be devastated if Sarah rejects her.",
        "Ben: No, Bonnie is gonna be safe from Travers. Now that he's staking his claim on Sarah, Bonnie needs to stay as far away from them as she possibly can. Now Travers is gonna try and use Bonnie's relationship with Sarah to get closer to you.",
        "Jessica: Well, he's never gonna get close to me again.",
        "Ben: He's gonna try.",
        "Jessica: Too bad. My eyes are open now, and all I see is you. And I am going to be your wife, and I am going to spend the rest of my years with you, and Marshall can't touch that.",
        "Ben: You know the man doesn't know when to quit.",
        "Jessica: Good thing we're very, very strong. We've already survived his worst, haven't we?",
        "Ben: You're right, we have. So what's wrong?",
        "Jessica: I just wish Bonnie were as indestructible as we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Are you okay? You look -- you look kind of funny.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, I'm -- I'm fine. You said you already knew what I was gonna tell you about Marshall ? Honey, what do you know?",
        "Sarah: Well, that he's my dad, and that my mother loved me and that I have her eyes. Did you hear? I'm gonna be leaving Durgin. I'm gonna live with him, and I'm gonna have my own room and my own clothes --",
        "Bonnie: And you're okay with that?",
        "Sarah: Yeah. I mean, Troy 's nice, but he's a social worker.",
        "Bonnie: A social worker who cares a lot about you.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I know. But he has a lot of other kids to worry about. I mean, it's not the same as having a dad. I mean, Marshall knew my mom, and he knew me when I was in her tummy. Is that what you wanted to tell me about him?",
        "Bonnie: Not exactly. Sarah, this is about your father and my mother.",
        "Sarah: Oh, yeah. He told me all about that.",
        "Bonnie: What did you say?",
        "Marshall: Just that your mother and I dated, and you didn't approve.",
        "Bonnie: Left out a few details, didn't you?",
        "Marshall: I don't want to overwhelm Sarah. She's had enough to handle already.",
        "Bonnie: Sarah, there are some things about your father that you need to know before you go off to live with him.",
        "Marshall: Bonnie.",
        "Sarah: What? What's wrong? Something bad is gonna happen, isn't it? Something bad always happens. Nothing ever works out for me.",
        "Marshall: Listen, Sarah, everything's going to be okay, all right? I promise. I won't let anyone hurt you.",
        "Bonnie: Sarah -- just be happy, okay? And always know that I will always watch over you.",

        "Susan: Is Rick --",
        "Hal: Out cold, but alive. The bullet went through the floor.",
        "Emily: So why is he unconscious?",
        "Chris: It was the only thing I had. I went back to the hospital to get a sedative for Alison when I ran into Walker , and he told me that Rick was still on the loose. So when I came back to the house and Alison didn't answer the door, I knew something was wrong.",
        "Alison: You came back to save me?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Hal: How did you get in?",
        "Chris: The bathroom window on the second floor. Soon as I got in, I filled the syringe with the sedative. Went to the stairs, I saw Rick with the gun. I used the only thing I had.",

        "Emily: Look, you know more than all of us he was ill, mom. He's ill.",
        "Susan: Why did it take me so long to find out?",
        "Emily: Because he didn't want you to. Don't you get it? Look, we have time, all right? Come here. We don't have to figure this all out today. Just know that it's over. It's all over, Mom.",

        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Troy: Well, that's good. 'Cause they need some time to say good-bye to you, too. And Vittorio's Pizzeria is dropping over a dozen pies. It was supposed to be a surprise party, but seems like you should know now.",
        "Marshall: Well, I wouldn't want Sarah to miss a party, especially not one in her honor. Look, we'll -- we'll start our little family tomorrow, okay? Look, I know you've had a lot thrown at you. But we're gonna be okay, me and you. Okay.",
