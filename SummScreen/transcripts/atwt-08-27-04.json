        "Carly: We could open a toy store. Ow. Parker Joe Munson, you better be straightening up your room. Well, hello. And how did you get down here?",

        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Mike: Bad timing?",
        "Carly: Oh, come in.",
        "Mike: Here, give me some of that.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Mike: Yep.",
        "Mike: Straightening up?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Loving every minute of it.",
        "Mike: I got here as soon as I could.",
        "Carly: Clairvoyant, too?",
        "Mike: No, I mean I got Parker's message. It sounded pretty important.",
        "Parker: Mike!",
        "Mike: What's up, buddy?",
        "Parker: I knew you'd come.",
        "Carly: You didn't tell me that you called Mike. You called him?",
        "Mike: He didn't tell you?",
        "Carly: No, he didn't tell me.",
        "Parker: Ready, Mike?",
        "Mike: Ready for what?",
        "Parker: To go find Jack.",

        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Julia: So what's new?",
        "Jack: It's all new to me. I keep thinking a story, or an image might spark something. I don't know. No such luck. I might as well have been dropped in from another planet.",
        "Julia: I know you're going to hate me for saying this again -- I know I've said it 3,000 times --but, Jack, you've got to be patient.",
        "Jack: You know one thing I've learned about myself over the last couple of days? I'm not big on patience.",
        "Julia: Well, that's progress. Listen, are you sure you're gonna be okay here? Remember, I promised J.J I was going to bring him to the water park.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. I might have the chance to fix that broken downspout.",
        "Julia: What part of \"relax\" don't you understand?",
        "Jack: At least let me pull something together for dinner maybe.",
        "Julia: Are you trying to be difficult?",
        "Jack: No, I'm not. I can't sit around here all day.",
        "Julia: Why not?",
        "Jack: Because I gotta feel like I'm helping out. I'm doing my share.",
        "Julia: All right. You know, maybe I shouldn't go to the water park.",
        "Jack: No -- why? No. You don't have to sit around here and baby-sit me, Julia. It wouldn't be fair to J.J. Go.",
        "Julia: Okay. But you have to promise you'll relax. You have my cell phone number?",
        "Jack: And your beeper.",
        "Julia: Okay. I wrote them down for you here, just in case.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. I saw them.",
        "Julia: You just hang out, relax, okay?",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "Julia: We'll be back soon.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Julia: Hey.",
        "J.J: I'm ready, Mom.",
        "Julia: Okay, so am I. So you just call me if you have any problems.",
        "Jack: Julia, I will. Please.",
        "J.J: You're not coming?",
        "Jack: Not this time, buddy. No.",
        "J.J: But it'll be so much more fun if you come. Please, Jack, please?",

        "Aaron: What's wrong with Ali?",
        "Emily: She's just a little upset, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: But she was looking forward to this shower. I mean, she practically ordered me to show up here. Where is everybody?",
        "Susan: That's what we were wondering. There was a little mix-up. Alison forgot to send the invitations and then she was made to feel like a criminal for it.",
        "Kim: I did not intend to be harsh with her, Susan.",
        "Emily: It's not your fault.",
        "Susan: Of course it's her fault!",
        "Aaron: Look, I'm gonna go.",
        "Kim: I don't understand why every time Ali gets into trouble, you blame me.",
        "Susan: Because you have made it very clear that you don't approve of this wedding.",
        "Emily: Well, neither do you.",
        "Susan: Who says?",
        "Aaron: I'm just going to leave the gift here.",
        "Susan: Aaron -- Aaron, honey, thank you for coming. It was very thoughtful of you. I'll make sure that Alison gets your gift.",
        "Aaron: Thank you. Okay.",
        "Susan: Please call Alison. Find out where she is and if she's okay. She was so humiliated.",
        "Emily: No, you know what? I'm going to physically go get her. Are you going to be okay by yourself?",
        "Susan: Of course. We'll be fine.",
        "Emily: I just -- be nice. Okay, try.",
        "Susan: I'll be nice.",
        "Emily: What are you still doing here. I'm going to go look for Alison.",
        "Aaron: She must have been pretty stressed out running out of here like that, huh?",
        "Emily: Yeah, as a matter of fact, she was. She forgot to mail the invitations. And no one's at her shower, and she's very upset, and I want her to know that it's okay -- it was a mistake. And we all love her very much.",
        "Aaron: Do you?",
        "Emily: Do I? Of course I love my sister. I love her very much. The last thing I want is to see her hurt.",
        "Aaron: Yeah -- well, me, too, Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison sobbing]",
        "Alison: I ruined everything. Everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Son, every groom has his doubts.",
        "Chris: Did you?",
        "Bob: Are you kidding? I broke into a cold sweat every time your mother brought out a bridal magazines.",
        "Chris: So I'm not a complete idiot?",
        "Bob: I might be more worried if you didn't have doubts. Of course, there's a vast difference between cold feet and serious misgivings. Anything else going on?",
        "Chris: Like what?",
        "Bob: Well, I guess what I'm asking is are -- are you concerned about getting married in general or marrying Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I know I promised to testify, dad, but I just can't. I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.",
        "Hal: Jen --",
        "Jennifer: And I'm sorry, daddy, because I know I'm letting you down, but --",
        "Hal: Jen, listen to me. I don't know what's going on, but I have to tell you something. Barbara made a very dangerous phone call a little while ago.",
        "Jennifer: Who did she call?",
        "Hal: Will. She played the victim. She told him that we were all against her. And the next thing I know, he's calling me, practically hysterical.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, dad, no.",
        "Hal: When I phoned his doctor, his doctor said that Will hasn't spoken a word since he put down the phone. I've got to stop her, Jen. And I can't do it alone. I need you. Will needs you.",
        "Jordan: Lieutenant Munson, maybe I could just speak to her --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, stay away from me.",
        "Jordan: Jen -- Jen, I love you. I never meant to hurt you. Rosanna and I, we were just half insane over losing Cabot. We weren't in our right minds. Jen, we were just reaching out to each other to try to take the pain away.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, and who's going to make my pain go away, now that you slept with Rosanna? My head's really trying to understand this, Jordan. I'm sorry, my heart's not going to go along with it.",
        "Jordan: Jen, please, please. Don't write me off. I love you as much as I ever have.",
        "Jennifer: You betrayed me! And if that's what you call love, then I'm sorry, I don't want any part of it. I've had enough of that in my life!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, well, well. It seems that mother was right, after all. Why don't you children ever learn the right way?",
        "Hal: That's enough.",
        "Barbara: I was right to protect you from Jordan. And I was right to protect Will from James. But if you still want to lock me up for that, you go right ahead, darling. You walk right in that room and make sure that I am locked up and never free to love or protect you ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Kim, I'm sorry that I got so angry. I'm sorry that Alison forgot to send the invitations, but could we just leave it at that?",
        "Kim: Well, I didn't intend for Alison to take what I said the way she did. If you think it will help, I will apologize to her.",
        "Susan: Well what good would that do? You're always judging her. You expect her to act like a grown-up and she's not, she's a kid. You want her to know things that she hasn't lived long enough to know.",
        "Kim: Well, you're right. She hasn't had a chance to mature. Frankly, I'm not convinced either one of those kids have their act together. That's what I've been saying from the beginning.",
        "Susan: But they love each other. They've made a choice. Maybe it's not the choice that we would have made, but it's done. All we can do is just get on board.",
        "Kim: No, no. It's not done. Not yet.",
        "Susan: What are you saying? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Kim: Well, I just have a feeling that if Ali were really committed to this marriage, there's no way in the world she would have forgotten to mail out those invitations.",
        "Susan: Are you saying that she did this on purpose?",
        "Kim: No. No, not at all. I'm just saying it wasn't a priority. I mean, not compared to that crazy key game she's been playing.",
        "Susan: I think you're reading too much into it.",
        "Kim: Am I?",
        "Susan: Yes, you are. Look, you don't want your son to marry my daughter, and you're always trying to justify it. But, it's too late in the game for that. Look, if you can't be happy about this wedding, then do us all a favor -- stay home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How's Mom? Did she tear Kim's hair out by her roots?",
        "Emily: Not yet, but it's still early.",
        "Alison: How am I going to talk my way out of this one?",
        "Emily: Alison, you made a mistake. That's all. And all the ruined shower plans in the world won't change the fact that Chris loves you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but Chris would never do something like that. He is always so grown up and honest and mature about everything.",
        "Emily: Alison, everybody makes mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes, but the important thing that you learn from them.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and what about the Stewart curse?",
        "Emily: What curse? What are you talking about?",
        "Alison: Well, Mom's never been too lucky with love. And, you know, until recently, neither have you.",
        "Emily: Honey, there is no curse, believe me. Would you stop talking like that. You and Chris are going to be just fine.",
        "Alison: I hope so. Because he's been the only guy, since my dad left, that makes me feel really special.",
        "Emily: Sweetie, good. Because you are very special.",
        "[Alison sobbing]",
        "Alison: I don't want to lose him, Emily!",
        "Emily: You won't. You won't. Nothing is going to come between you and Chris, Alison. You have to believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I don't want to cancel anything, okay? It's like you said, it's a big step. You know? I'm sure once all this wedding hype dies down, I'll be fine, okay? And this place, this apartment, is perfect for Alison and I to start our life together. Speaking of which, I should probably get back to the shower and tell her the good news, okay? Thank you.",
        "Bob: No problem. I won't even charge you a commission.",
        "Chris: I didn't mean for the apartment. Thank you for indulging me in my pre- wedding jitters. I feel a lot better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This place looks awesome, pal.",
        "J.J: Then let's go!",
        "Jack: And the world's fourth largest log flume? Are you kidding me? Who could possibly pass that up?",
        "Julia: I'm not sure that a man who just got out of the hospital is ready for a log flume.",
        "Jack: What about the wave pool?",
        "Julia: Well, it depends on the size of the waves.",
        "Jack: Listen, if it's something you don't think I can handle, then I could always watch from the sidelines.",
        "J.J: Yeah, he could watch and wave to us and stuff! Please, Mom, please?",
        "Julia: All right, fine. But you have to promise, Jack, you have to promise that you're going to take it easy.",
        "Jack: Julia, I promise. Nothing but fresh air and sunshine. That's it. Give it up, buddy boy. Give it up! Water wonder world, here we come.",

        "Carly: We can't just drive around all afternoon.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because we can't. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm sure that Mike needs to get back to work.",
        "Parker: You do?",
        "Mike: Let me have a few minutes alone with your mom, okay?",
        "Parker: Then we can go?",
        "Mike: We'll see.",
        "Parker: That usually means no.",
        "Mike: I'll come up to your room as soon as we're done.",
        "Parker: Promise?",
        "Mike: I promise, all right?",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry that he got you all the way out here.",
        "Mike: Don't apologize.",
        "Carly: I have done everything I can to get him to understand that Jack is gone.",
        "Mike: It's an awful lot for a kid to understand.",
        "Carly: Maybe he needs to speak to a professional.",
        "Mike: 'Cause he misses Jack? Carly, that's normal. So he's having trouble letting go? The kid wants a little hope. What's wrong with that?",
        "Carly: We both know that it's gone well beyond that. He is certain that Jack is still alive. Now, how long do I let him live with that fantasy?",
        "Mike: Not forever. But right now, who does it hurt?",
        "Carly: Him!",
        "Mike: I'm no expert, but I think you're going to end up doing more harm if you take away his hope too soon. He has to deal with Jack's death in his own way, in his own time.",
        "Carly: But for me -- and I know this is selfish, but every time he talks about Jack like he's alive, it breaks my heart all over again.",
        "Mike: I got an idea. Are you busy, do you have to work right now?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Mike: All right, let's pack up Sage, we'll get Parker, we'll go for a ride. It's a beautiful day. Come on, come on, come on. It'll be good to get out of the house.",
        "Carly: No, I don't know.",
        "Mike: Let Parker decide where we go and what we do.",
        "Carly: Well we know what he wants to do. And what happens when we don't find Jack?",
        "Mike: We'll deal with it when the time comes. All right, if you want, when we get back, I'll play video games with him. I'll chase him all over the backyard until he's too tired to think about Jack anymore -- or at least for today.",
        "Carly: How is it that you know so much about children?",
        "Mike: 'Cause I used to be one. And a stubborn one, at that.",
        "Carly: You're still pretty stubborn.",
        "Mike: So are we going on a road trip?",
        "Carly: Yeah, we're going on a road trip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I need a parent that I can trust, and dad is the only one who has earned that. He has never lied to me. He's never used me. He's the only man that I can lean on, no matter what.",
        "Hal: Nikki, get her out of here.",
        "Barbara: You can't just erase me, Hal. I'm her mother. I'll always be your mother.",
        "[Jen sighs]",
        "Hal: I don't know what to tell you, Jen. There was a time when I thought I knew your mother. She was a woman who I thought had goodness in her. She knew how to love her children without hurting them. Do you remember that?",
        "Jennifer: She had me still believing that she was still that woman. Of course then --",
        "Hal: Yeah, then. But, listen, I don't want to force you to testify if you feel you can't do it. I'll find another way to deal with your mother.",
        "Tom: Ah, Jennifer, good. You ready?",
        "Hal: Tom, I'm not sure that --",
        "Tom: The whole case rests on you.",
        "Hal: Jen isn't going to testify, Tom.",
        "Tom: Why, Hal? We can't afford a setback like this now.",
        "Jordan: Jen, I know that I'm the last person to have a say in this.",
        "Hal: You got that right.",
        "Jordan: You have every right to hate me. But Cabot was an innocent baby, Jen. Don't let Barbara get away with his murder.",
        "Jennifer: I'll do it, dad. I'll testify.",
        "Hal: Are you sure?",
        "Jordan: Thank you, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not doing this for you.",
        "Tom: Good, we're in business.",
        "Hal: Are you ready?",
        "Jordan: Jen, I'll never forget this.",
        "Jennifer: Go to hell, Jordan. And take Rosanna with you.",

        "Bailiff: All rise. This court is now in session. Judge Steven Logan presiding.",
        "Judge: Please be seated. In the matter of the State of Illinois versus Barbara Ryan, I ask the defendant to please stand. Ms. Ryan, to the charge of conspiracy to aid and abet a convicted felon, how do you plead?",
        "Barbara: I plead not guilty, your honor.",

        "Susan: Don't do that.",
        "Chris: I'm -- I'm sorry. The shower's over already?",
        "Susan: Haven't you heard? It was over before it even got started.",
        "Chris: No, no. What happened?",
        "Susan: That happened. Or didn't happen.",
        "Chris: She forgot to mail them?",
        "Susan: She forgot. And your mother -- your mother had a field day. She turned the whole thing into this big lecture about Alison's immaturity.",
        "Chris: Susan, I'm really sorry.",
        "Susan: Alison made a mistake, okay? But she doesn't need everybody coming down on her. Making mistakes is part of growing up. You should have seen Emily, she was worse than Alison at that age. And look at her now. She's -- can you believe what a great wife and mother she's turned into?",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, she's great. Where is Alison now?",
        "Susan: Oh, Emily's looking for her. Look, Chris, it's been a miserable day, but I really have to ask you something.",
        "Chris: Sure.",
        "Susan: I don't care what Kim thinks. But I really care what you think. Do you ever feel that Alison has -- I mean do you ever wish that she were more grown- up? A little more like Emily?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You and Mom should stick post-it notes to my forehead.",
        "Emily: Would you stop saying things like that?",
        "Alison: You know, the worst part is that I proved Kim right. I acted like a kid. I didn't even have the courage to stick around and look her in the eye.",
        "Emily: That's because you were embarrassed.",
        "Alison: And so were you. And so was Mom. What am I gonna say to Chris?",
        "Emily: The truth? I think he'll understand.",
        "Alison: How many times can I mess up? I mean, Chris needs somebody who's serious. Somebody who can help him with his career, someone who can host dinner parties and stuff like --",
        "Emily: You can do that.",
        "Alison: Yeah, right.",
        "Emily: Honey, you cannot learn how to be a doctor's wife overnight.",
        "Alison: I just want him to be proud of me.",
        "Emily: He is.",
        "Alison: And I want what you have -- you know, a marriage where the guy adores me.",
        "Emily: You do have a guy who adores you. Would you stop talking like this? Chris loves you. You're an incredible girl. Don't change that girl. [Cell phone rings] I wouldn't bet you any of my money that's him right now.",
        "Alison: I am so sorry. And I'm going to apologize to your mom and from now on, I promise you I'll have lists and --",
        "Aaron: Ali, it's Aaron.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were --",
        "Aaron: No, look it's not a problem. Look, I need you to come over to my house as soon as you can.",
        "Alison: I can't.",
        "Aaron: Ali, how many times have I dropped everything for you, huh? Come on, Ali, it's really important. You should come over.",
        "Alison: Okay, okay. But this better be an emergency.",
        "Aaron: It is.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll be right there. I've gotta go. Aaron has some sort of a crisis. But if you talk to Mom, can you tell her that I'm so sorry that I ruined the shower? And I'm going to talk to Chris as soon as I can.",
        "Emily: You bet. So you feel better?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do.",
        "Emily: Good.",
        "Alison: And in two weeks, I'm going to become Mrs. Dr. Christopher Hughes. And we are going to be the happiest couple to ever march down that aisle.",
        "Emily: That's more like it.",
        "Alison: And I know how lucky I am. I know I have a great guy like Chris, but I have you as my big sister. What else could a girl ask for? Thank you for this pep talk. You're the best.",

        "Chris: I didn't change the subject.",
        "Susan: Change it, avoid it. Same difference.",
        "Chris: Susan, what do you want me to say?",
        "Susan: I just want you to answer my question. Do you ever feel that Alison is a little too immature for you?",
        "Chris: Alison is Alison.",
        "Susan: Meaning?",
        "Chris: Meaning, that she's young. Okay, but I love her spirit. To Ali, nothing in the world is impossible. And I love that. Not to say that she doesn't drive me crazy sometimes. But I tried to get to take some classes, think about her career, focus on her future.",
        "Susan: Ali does everything on her own clock.",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, I'm not trying to push her.",
        "Susan: No, well don't because if you do, she'll just turn around and do the opposite.",
        "Chris: Are you trying to scare me?",
        "Susan: Look, marriage is tough. And false expectations make it impossible. Alison's going to grow up someday, but she's always going to be Alison. And I need you to tell me that, even with all her faults, you still think she's the right woman for you.",

Maybe go have some dinner, maybe take some food up to the lake and have a little picnic, just the two of us.",

        "Carly: Well, if he really is looking for Jack, he's gonna be pretty disappointed. Don't you think?",
        "Mike: Maybe, at first. But maybe after a while, he'll start having so much fun and he'll forget for a couple of hours. I think we could all use some of that.",
        "Carly: All right. I have a suit for him in the trunk for his swimming lessons. What about you?",

Because if you are, you know that you would do anything in the world to protect your children. My son, Will, my youngest child, was threatened by James Steinbeck. It's all on that tape. All the damning evidence, which is also my only defense. The threat against him was real and imminent, and I acted instinctively to protect him from James Steinbeck who is the real villain in this. Oh, I could hear you all jeering now. \"Why didn't you go to the police, Barbara? Someone else's child died because of you, Barbara.\" But not me. Not me. It was James Steinbeck who murdered Cabot Sinclair. Well, I see I haven't swayed you. You've already made up your minds about me. So, you leave me no choice. And as much as I hate to deprive you of the opportunity of kicking me while I'm down, there's only one last thing to say. So long, you miserable hypocrites! It's been real fun!",
