        "Bonnie: Mother, you can't be serious about this job thing. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Serious as a heart attack. Hopefully, your Godmother will \r\nconsider hiring you. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: As a shop girl waiting on people? \r\n",
        "Jessica: Well, I know it pales in comparison to your perfect life in Europe\r\n\r\nwith your perfect ex-fiance, the lord of the manor. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: He's a Duke, mother. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Whatever. It would have been nice if I could have met him. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: So you could lecture him on his lack of working class values? \r\n",
        "Jessica: No, honey, so that I could know what's going on with your life. \r\nNow, I knew something was wrong from your phone calls. I could hear it in \r\nyour voice. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: It's just the same old, tired story. I dropped in at the country \r\nhouse, and I found him with his ex-girlfriend and her friend and her friend's\r\n\r\nfriend, and did I mention the upstairs parlor maid? \r\n",
        "Jessica: I'm so sorry. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Don't be. I'm so past it. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Oh, really? \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Really. I mean, he wanted whatever he wanted whenever he \r\nwanted it. It's good I found out now, right? Good riddance. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, I know what it's like to lose someone you love. I want to\r\n\r\nhelp. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: But I'm fine. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, I'm your mother. I know you, and I love you. And \r\nsometimes, I just think it helps to talk about it. So why don't you tell me \r\nwhat else happened over in Europe? \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Well, what happened was I just needed a break from the constant \r\nround of social engagements. I mean, you give a guy a title, and they expect \r\nyou to be by his side at every new library, art gallery or day care center on\r\n\r\nthe continent. Look, all I wanted to do was come home for a visit, not be \r\npushed into the third circle of hell. \r\n",
        "[Jessica laughs] \r\n",
        "Jessica: This is how you refer to the working world? Sweetheart, there's \r\nnothing wrong with making your own way. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: And I will, as -- as soon as I find out what I'm really suited for.\r\n\r\n",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but you can't find that out in a spa or at the country club.\r\n\r\nOh, I need to see what's keeping Lisa. Maybe I should talk to her about this \r\nfirst, okay? Now, you work on that smile. ",
        "Bonnie: Oh, God. Be there, please. Please be there. Just \r\nbe there. Hi. It's me. Look, I should have never left Europe. It was a huge, \r\nhuge mistake. I'm so sorry. Well, how can I calm down? All of my credit \r\ncards are frozen, and my own mother is forcing me to -- I can't even barely \r\nsay it -- take a job waiting on people. I swear, if you don't come and rescue\r\n\r\nme, I'm gonna die from the terminally bored. ",
        "Duncan: You know, it's amazing. You look remarkably healthy for such \r\na tortured soul. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Daddy, I can't do this. Please. Please, you have got to take me \r\nhome now! ",
        "",
        "Rose: Am I late? Oh, I hate to be late. \r\n",
        "Craig: Oh, perhaps you're still on Atlantic City hours. \r\n",
        "Rose: Tell me about it. You know, it took me six months to hit the sheets \r\nbefore 4:00 A.M. ",
        "[Craig laughs] Thanks for the wine. Ah, thanks. \r\n",
        "Craig: I'm sure you didn't ask me here to discuss your sleep patterns. \r\n",
        "Rose: No. You strike me as a guy who likes to cut to the throat -- I mean \r\nchase. \r\n",
        "Craig: Nervous, Rose? \r\n",
        "Rose: Me? No. I haven't been nervous since my first confession. ",
        "[Both \r\nlaugh] Yeah. So I'm just gonna get right down to it, okay? Right down to \r\nbusiness. I want you to drop the lawsuit against Barbara and Paul Ryan. \r\n",
        "Craig: Is this you or Lucinda talking? \r\n",
        "Rose: Both. You see, this lawsuit is riding up our back like a bad rash. So\r\n\r\ndrop it before there's any trouble. Consider it a friendly suggestion. \r\n",
        "Craig: Are we friends? \r\n",
        "Rose: Don't you think you've done enough to those poor people? \r\n",
        "Craig: \"Those poor people\" who tried to send me to prison? \"Those poor \r\npeople\" who accused me of attempted murder? \"Those poor people\" who \r\nslandered me every day in the press as the antichrist? \r\n",
        "Rose: Ah, they weren't far off. You didn't light the match, but you sure \r\nblew up Barbara's life. You robbed her, you used her, you lied to her. There \r\nare many ways, many ways to kill a woman, Craig. \r\n",
        "Craig: Yeah, what about what Barbara and Paul did to me? You think I \r\ncould rebuild my life with a snap of my fingers? A reputation is a fragile \r\nthing, you know. \r\n",
        "Rose: I'm taking this as a no? \r\n",
        "Craig: The thought of sitting in a prison cell without hope of seeing my \r\nchildren or even the light of day for 40 years was pretty scary, Rosie. \r\nBarbara and Paul owe me for that, and they will pay me, with interest. \r\n",
        "Rose: I was afraid you'd say that. \r\n",
        "Craig: What is this? \r\n",
        "Rose: It's something that you're very, very familiar with. It's a lawsuit \r\nthat is all dressed up and ready to be filed at the courthouse. So either you\r\n\r\ndrop the lawsuit against Barbara and Paul Ryan, or Lucinda will sue those \r\ntacky pants off of you. Salut. ",
        "",
        "Nick: Yeah, the paper's kind of unusual, too. So can you \r\ncheck to see if anyone at your shop remembers working on it or if they \r\nremember who placed the order? Great. Yeah, I can be reached at the \r\nnumber I left. Thank you. ",
        "",
        "Carly: Excuse me. Hi. I'm looking for Molly Conlan. Is she around? \r\n",
        "Nick: No. She left after the broadcast. \r\n",
        "Carly: Do you happen to know if she was headed home? \r\n",
        "Nick: I don't know. ",
        "",
        "Kim: I don't believe it. Carly Tenney, you've got more nerve than any ten \r\npeople I know. You are not welcome here. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey, I was just -- \r\n",
        "Molly: You were just what? Jack, you don't look very good. You know \r\nwhat? I'm really sorry, 'cause I meant to call. Do you mind if I come in for a\r\n\r\nminute? \r\n",
        "Jack: No. No, please. Please, sure. \r\n",
        "Molly: Are you selling the place? \r\n",
        "Jack: No. It's just the rest of Julia's stuff. Her mom wants it sent back to\r\n\r\nPennsylvania. \r\n",
        "Molly: Listen, I tried to call you. I really did. I called down at the \r\nstation. \r\nI called your cell phone. I called Carly's apartment. \r\n",
        "Jack: What's up, Molly? \r\n",
        "Molly: Nothing. My whole life's just falling apart, that's all. \r\n",
        "Jack: What's wrong? \r\n",
        "Molly: It took me so long to find the perfect guy, I mean, the guy that I \r\ncould count on. Look at him. Jake is -- he can hit a seven/ten split. He can \r\nmake oatmeal taste edible. He can juggle the twins. He can even sing a heck \r\nof a lullaby, and he can win an Endicott Award, but he can't fix this. Jack, I\r\n\r\nneed you. I have no place else to turn. ",
        "",
        "Jessica: I know, I've been pushing the envelope lately. And, well, you \r\nalways taught me to test the limits and never settle. \r\n",
        "Duncan: I didn't mean the financial limits. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: I know. I know. I made a big mistake, and from now on, I'll \r\nmake better choices, and I'll live within my budget. I'll do whatever you ask.\r\n\r\nJust, please, please take me home with you. \r\n",
        "Duncan: Bonnie, you never do what anyone asks. And that fierce \r\nindependence is part of why we love you so much. But I don't think it's in \r\nyour best interests right now to go back to Europe. So you and I are going to\r\n\r\nsay a temporary good-bye. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Good-bye? Where are you going? \r\n",
        "Duncan: Well, I just got a call from Edinburgh. I've got to go home and \r\ntake care of business. I think this time with your mother will be good for \r\nboth of you. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: You're leaving me alone with mother? \r\n",
        "Duncan: You two will get along just fine, and I think you'll be a natural \r\nin the fashion business. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Fashion, yes, but retail? \r\n",
        "Jessica: Well, hopefully. I don't even know if Lisa will take you on yet. \r\n",
        "Duncan: But if she does, it will be an extraordinary opportunity for you. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Absolutely. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Oh, yes, \"extraordinary.\" Selling off-the-rack merchandise to \r\nhicks with no taste and getting sore feet for minimum wage? \r\n",
        "Jessica: Oh, please, can we dispense with the drama? \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Right. I need to just \"Buckle down and put my nose to the \r\ngrindstone\" -- whatever a grindstone is. Look, I'm sorry if I'm not who or \r\nwhat you think your daughter should be. \r\n",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, there is not any who or what I think you should be. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Well, can't you just accept me for who I am? Can't you just be a \r\nmoth and not a drill sergeant or a career counselor? \r\n",
        "Jessica: Okay, now, you're pushing it, bonnie. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I'm sorry. I forget. I keep forgetting. I'm a project, not a \r\nperson, like one of your cases. God, you ask me to pour out my heart about \r\nthe details of my love life, but why should I? Why should I with someone \r\nwho cares ten times more about their career than they ever have about me?! ",

        "",
        "Jack: Yeah, I got one of these invites, too. You sure Nick Scudder's \r\nbehind this? \r\n",
        "Molly: I'm positive. The problem is, even Jake thinks the guy is clean. \r\n",
        "Jack: Why? \r\n",
        "Molly: Because he had a talk with him. He checked him out. But you \r\nknow what? He doesn't know Nick like I do. This guy can talk his way out \r\nof a hanging. \r\n",
        "Jack: This is pretty sick stuff. \r\n",
        "Molly: Yeah, I know. Sick enough to make someone go crazy, make you \r\ndoubt who you are and how you want to live your life. \r\n",
        "Jack: You said you talked to Hal about this? \r\n",
        "Molly: Yeah. \r\n",
        "Jack: Then why me, Molly? \r\n",
        "Molly: Because -- because this guy isn't getting the message. \r\n",
        "Jack: Molly, I couldn't arrest the guy even if I caught him red handed. \r\nI've been suspended. \r\n",
        "Molly: Jack -- well that's not like being fired, through, right? \r\n",
        "Jack: Well, it's kind of like a dry run before they fire you. \r\n",
        "Molly: Listen, this is obviously not the right time to get you involved in\r\n\r\nsomething like this. I don't want to get you in even more trouble down at the\r\n\r\nstation. So I'll handle him, or he'll handle me. Whatever it is, I'll work it \r\nout. \r\nI really appreciate you listening to me. \r\n",
        "Jack: Molly, wait. I may not officially be a cop, but I'm still your friend.\r\n\r\nAnd to tell you the truth, leaning on some guy who deserves it sounds pretty \r\ngood right now. ",

        "Carly: I didn't do anything to hurt her. \r\n",
        "Kim: Oh, excuse me. That wasn't you, then, having a passionate kiss with \r\nher husband a few minutes before they got married. \r\n",
        "Carly: Why don't you take that up with Craig? Oh, right. Because I'm one \r\nnotch above \"The happy hooker,\" and Craig is just a guy being a guy, right? \r\n",
        "Kim: Wrong. I don't want to see either one of you around here. \r\n",
        "Carly: Fine. I just came by to tell molly I'm leaving town. I wanted to tell\r\n\r\nher in person. \r\n",

        "Carly: Asap. Is that soon enough for you? Just tell her, okay, please? Tell\r\n\r\nher I'll call her when I get settled. \r\n",
        "Kim: Fine. \r\n",
        "Carly: You know, I thought having a long and pretty happy life was \r\nsupposed to bring you good things, like wisdom, tolerance. \r\n",
        "Kim: You thought wrong. ",
        "",
        "Craig: If Lucinda were here, I would point out that chronic hatred of an \r\nex-son-in-law is hardly grounds for a lawsuit. \r\n",
        "Rose: Could I ask you something? Do you know what a good guy would \r\ndo in this situation? \r\n",
        "Craig: Haven't a clue. \r\n",
        "Rose: He would drop this lawsuit and let his ex get on with her life, for \r\ncrying out loud. \r\n",
        "Craig: Funny you should mention that. I came to that same conclusion \r\nmoments before your tortellini arrived. \r\n",
        "Rose: Really? Good. \r\n",
        "Craig: Yes, really. But now that I know that my ex-mother-in-law is so \r\neager to make this suit go away, I will take it all the way to the Supreme \r\nCourt if I have to. So why don't you scarf your pasta and scurry back to \r\nLucinda and tell her that? \r\n",
        "Rose: No. No, I can't, because we have unfinished business, Craig. \r\n",
        "Craig: Ah, I thought this meeting was over. \r\n",
        "Rose: No, it's over when I say that it's over. Remember that little incident\r\n\r\nat the boardroom, Worldwide, when Lucinda went all cuckoo? \r\n",
        "Craig: Ah, yes, one of my fondest memories. The failing queen watching \r\nreality slip from her grip. \r\n",
        "Rose: Well, she had a little help on that one-way trip to Mars. It turns out\r\n\r\nthat box of chocolates that she received as a gift was laced with goofy juice.\r\n\r\nBut who am I telling? The man who did it with his own two hands. And that \r\nlittle card with the chocolates saying that it's from her granddaughter -- that\r\n\r\nwas sheer brilliance. Lucinda loves Lucy. She gobbled 'em all up, and the \r\nrest, as they say, is unfortunately history. \r\n",
        "Craig: There is one problem with your fairy tale. There is no proof. And \r\nbesides, I was as shocked at Lucinda's behavior as you were. \r\n",
        "Rose: Yeah, I'm sure you were. Who am I to say? But you know, don't \r\nyou want to know what I got in my -- in my bag? \r\n",
        "Craig: No, not really.\r\n",
        "Rose: You know, my family, they used to call 'em something really fancy \r\n-- truffles. Yeah, truffles. You know what I call them? Proof. ",

        "Isaac: All beautiful women, all first class. I admit, I even gave them a \r\nlook or two. But I didn't pony up for any diamonds. Now, you -- you're in \r\nsuch a rush to say \"I do,\" you can't see they never will. See, some women -- \r\nsome women are great appetizers. You don't sit down to a whole meal. \r\n",

I covered for Julia, she covered for Craig,\r\n\r\nand neither one of us told the other. I guess maybe we knew how fragile our \r\nrelationship was, and we didn't want to risk what little happiness we had. So\r\n\r\nwe stopped trusting each other, and we hoped the little problems would take \r\ncare of themselves. That's no way to build a future. Listen, do me a favor, \r\nwill you?
