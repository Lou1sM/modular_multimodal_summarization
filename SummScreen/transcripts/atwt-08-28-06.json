        "When Mike walks in on a naked Simon and Carly, Simon lets him believe something is going on between them. Katie calls Mike to tell him she checked her temperature and he needs to get home. Carly is furious and walks out on Simon and heads over to Mike and Katie's to explain. She finds a negligee clad Katie waiting for Mike. Katie wants to know what is up though? Carly finally spits out about what transpired earlier between her, Simon and Mike. Katie is clearly shaken, and later when Mike is home ready to make babies, Katie is distracted thinking since Carly came all the way out to see them something must be going on, and bails out of their love making claiming to have an appointment. Carly meets up with Simon later, who pleads with her to return to work for him, promising he will never disrobe in front of her again \u0096 unless she invites him to. When Luke mentions Jade hitched a ride with him to find Will, this ruins Will and Gwen's talk. Kevin is not happy to see Luke, but begrudgingly agrees to talk to him. Luke finally comes out; Kevin is stunned and walks away without a word. Later, Luke tries to talk to him again and an angry Kevin calls Luke a freak. Tom and Margo talk about her guilt over not realizing Maddie was raped, but they are happy to have some alone time and that Casey and his friends are out of town and safe from Louis. Too bad the slasher is watching close by at Raven Lake where all the teens have gone for the weekend. When Will confronts Jade about following him there, she claims to be there for Luke since he is coming out. Will asks her to stay away as he tries to repair his marriage. The teens put together a football game and Gwen almost stays behind in the cabin where the slasher is hiding, but changes her mind. Alex, their nerdy friend goes back to retrieve his inhaler, unfortunately for him, as he is attacked by the slasher. Anne and Zach sneak away for some fun and head back to the cabin; when Zach gets up from the bed for some protection, Anne sees some shoes inside the closet and thinks someone is watching them. Zach whips open the door and a throat slit Alex falls at their feet. Back at the field, Gwen is aggravated when Will picks her to be on his team; Casey reminds her that Will is trying and his heart is in the right place; he wishes Maddie were there, but he knows he will never see her again, as he grabs Gwen's hand to head back to the game. Unbeknownst to them, Maddie is in fact watching them from close by from underneath the stands."

        "Simon: Wow. You do look lovely, by the way.",
        "Carly: Thank you. You know, I was thinking --",
        "Simon: Yeah, a little less thinking, a little bit more passing of the clothes.",
        "Carly: No, no, just hear me out. I was thinking, if I were alone in a construction site and I spilled -- what is it again?",
        "Simon: Spackle.",
        "Carly: Spackle, thank you.",
        "Simon: Spackle, yep.",
        "Carly: Yes, yes, that's the word. If I spilled spackle on myself, I wonder if I would just take off my clothes and shower right there?",
        "Simon: Well, if you were meeting an important supplier in less than half an hour and you didn't have time to go home and get changed, then --",
        "Carly: You are blushing.",
        "Simon: That's only because I was trying to be considerate and -- oh, to hell with it.",
        "Carly: You're welcome. And you look lovely, too.",
        "Mike: Oh.",
        "Carly: Hi. Mike, this is not -- it's not what it looks like. Simon spilled -- would you tell him, please?",
        "Simon: What can I say, Mike? You caught us.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Mike: No, no, don't mind me. I just came by to get some of my tools and stuff. I'm sorry I interrupted.",
        "Simon: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know, I should have known. Wherever you are, Jade is.",
        "Will: Come on. Gwen, you said we could talk.",
        "Gwen: I don't want to talk about Jade. I don't want to think about Jade. I don't even want to see Jade. That's why I left town, so I didn't have to deal with it.",
        "Will: I didn't know she was coming.",
        "Gwen: Oh yeah, right.",
        "Luke: No, Gwen, it's the truth. I'm sorry, I didn't realize -- Jade came with me. Will had nothing to do with this.",
        "Will: See? Now, can we please just go somewhere and talk, just you and me?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Fine. Well, let me at least help you with all that stuff.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you want to help me? Yeah, go away.",
        "Luke: Look, I didn't mean to mess things up between you guys. I'm sorry. Jade came --",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, Luke, it really doesn't matter how Jade got here. What matters is that she's here. And that some way, some how, she will find a way to hook up with Will.",
        "Will: That's not gonna happen. I don't want that to happen. And to prove it to you, I'm gonna send her away, okay?",
        "Gwen: And how's she gonna get back to Oakdale? She gonna get out her broomstick and fly?",
        "Luke: I'm sorry.",
        "Will: No, it's okay. It's not your fault.",
        "Luke: So what're you gonna do?",
        "Will: I'm gonna do what I came here to do. I'm gonna fix my marriage. Where's Jade?",
        "Luke: I don't know. She split as soon as we got here.",
        "Will: Okay. Find her and tell her to stay away from me and Gwen. Make sure she gets the message, okay? Thanks.",
        "Luke: Like that'll work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tad: Yo, kev! You gonna help me get this keg in the water or what?",
        "Kevin: Got you covered. Hey, don't go anywhere.",
        "Liv: You think Tad's cute?",
        "Ada: Very. And very into me.",
        "Liv: A lot better than our last double date, huh?",
        "Ada: God, Luke Snyder's such a loser. You know, I can't believe I ever thought he was hot. What is he doing here?",
        "Luke: Hey, Liv. Ada. How's it going?",
        "Kevin: Who invited you?",
        "Luke: Gil. I -- you need some help with that keg?",
        "Ada: No, my boyfriend, Tad, is helping us. We don't need you here.",
        "Luke: Okay, I just -- Kevin, can I talk to you?",
        "Kevin: I'm busy.",
        "Zach: How's the water, Case?",
        "Casey: Dive in and find out.",
        "Zach: We are so there. What are you waiting for, Ann?",
        "Ann: That water looks cold.",
        "Casey: It warms up when you get in.",
        "Ann: Where's Gwen?",
        "Zach: Probably trying on a slinky bikini so that Casey's eyes can pop out when he sees her.",
        "Casey: Dude, it's not like that.",
        "Ann: Gwen is in love with Will. They're married.",
        "Zach: For now. Are you coming or not?",
        "Ann: Not.",
        "Zach: You sure you want to stay there on the beach by yourself? You know this lake's haunted.",
        "Ann: No, it's not. Is it?",
        "Casey: No, it's not. Zach, stop it.",
        "Zach: Have you guys never seen a horror movie? The lake is always haunted. And the girl who never gets wet with the perfect hair is always the first to go.",
        "Ann: I'm not going in.",
        "Zach: That sounded like a dare to me. Did that sound like a dare to you, Case?",
        "Casey: Afraid so. A guy's got to do what a guy's got to do.",
        "Ann: What are you guys talking about? What are you gonna do? Wait! Stop!",
        "[Screaming]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will, would you just give it up?",
        "Will: You can spend the whole weekend running from me, or you can talk to me.",
        "Gwen: Fine. Say what you have to say.",
        "Will: Okay. Can we go somewhere quieter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Actually, I'm just looking for the spackle -- I guess you found it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, see, that's exactly what happened. The spackle fell on Simon and so he took a shower. I wasn't even here when he took a shower. I just walked in just before you did.",
        "Mike: Carly, it really doesn't matter. And I don't even work here anymore.",
        "Simon: Right.",
        "Carly: Is that all you have to say? Why is it that you have tons to say unless I need you to say something? [Cell phone ringing] Please, tell Mike what actually happened here.",
        "Simon: You just did.",
        "Mike: Carly, seriously, don't worry about it, okay? Excuse me. Hello.",
        "Katie: Guess what I'm holding.",
        "Mike: The phone.",
        "Katie: The thermometer. It's time for baby-making.",

        "Katie: How fast can you get here?",
        "Mike: Fast. Well, I'll see you around.",
        "Carly: Mike --",
        "Mike: Take care of yourself, okay?",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Simon: Well listen, that marble supplier guy's gonna be here any minute. Can you help me clean this place up? It's a mess.",
        "Carly: How could you do that?",
        "Simon: Do what?",
        "Carly: Mike thinks we were having sex in here.",
        "Simon: Well, I only witnessed Mike and Katie exactly the same thing right about -- oh, there.",
        "Carly: Okay, so to prove that you still have it, you have to try and make him think that we've done it?",
        "Simon: Who cares what Mike thinks?",
        "Carly: I do. I live in this town. It matters to me what people think. I don't want them to think that I'm having sex with my boss just in broad daylight where anybody could walk in!",
        "Simon: Nothing happened!",
        "Carly: You and I are the only people who know that.",
        "Simon: Carly, come on, relax. It's no big deal. I'll fix it with him.",
        "Carly: This is not going to work.",
        "Simon: Can we please not have this fight right now when an important supplier's about to walk in the door?",
        "Carly: You know, you make the right noises. You say that you want to be some big-time real estate developer. You say that you want my designs because they're one-of-a-kind.",
        "Simon: That's all true.",
        "Carly: This is really all about Katie.",
        "Simon: Oh, sweet fancy Moses!",
        "Carly: Making her miss you, making her want you, trying to make her jealous.",
        "Simon: I wasn't even thinking about Katie!",
        "Carly: I'm nothing to you, am I? I'm just a means to and end.",
        "Simon: Okay, now you're being ridiculous. You are very important to me.",
        "Carly: Just admit it, you're using me.",
        "Simon: You really think that little of yourself?",
        "Carly: Do you really care what I think?",
        "Simon: You know what, you admit it, Carly. The only thing you're worried about is that Jack might find out from Mike that we \"slept together.\" I'm sorry, wait, please. Can we just -- I'll square everything away with Mike, I promise. I'll fix everything. Can we just get this meeting out of the way? It's important.",
        "Carly: So is my reputation.",
        "Simon: Carly!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, you're leaving?",
        "Tom: Yeah. I just came by to get something to eat, I thought I'd get some work done while it was quiet in the house.",
        "Margo: Huh. It is really quiet with the kids gone.",
        "Tom: Yeah. So, any luck finding Maddie's brother-in-law?",
        "Margo: You know, the guy's from Chicago. He doesn't even know his way around this town. His only connection is his wife and Henry and Maddie. And somehow he's managed to completely disappear.",
        "Tom: Hmm. I think I'll make you something to eat.",
        "Margo: No, no. You've got to get going.",
        "Tom: No, I know where I need to be, and that is here.",
        "Margo: You know what, sometimes I go for days without thinking about it. Weeks.",
        "Tom: The rape?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Tom: So this case is bringing all that back up again, huh?",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It just takes so much help to get through something like that. You need therapy, you need friends, you need family. Maddie didn't have that.",
        "Tom: She's gonna get it now.",
        "Margo: And the reason she didn't have that is because I kicked her out of our home. I mean, how could I not see what she was going through before my very eyes? I mean, I went through it.",
        "Tom: So now you're beating yourself up because you didn't read Maddie's mind?",
        "Margo: Well yeah, the man who raped her is out there, I can't find him. I mean why? Why couldn't I have been more understanding? Why did I have to be so paranoid that she was seducing our son? And that Louis Browning should be locked up behind bars -- you know what, you've got to go. And I'm gonna be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Don't tell me you're sacking out on me, Man.",
        "Casey: I'm tired. I drove, remember?",
        "Zach: We're surrounded by girls wearing practically nothing. You can sleep when you're dead.",
        "Casey: I just need a minute.",
        "Zach: You're nuts, Man. It doesn't get any better than this.",
        "[Casey imagining]",
        "Maddie: Can I kiss it and make it better?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Maddie: Do you have a headache?",
        "Casey: No, why, Maddie?",
        "Maddie: Can I kiss it anyway? Even if it won't make it better don't give up, Casey. Don't give up on me.",
        "Ann: Casey, get up!",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Ann: You're on my sarong. It's couture.",
        "Casey: Oh, yeah, well, sorry.",
        "Ann: Sorry isn't good enough. This is payback.",
        "Casey: Oh!",
        "Zach: Casey!",
        "[Ann screaming]",
        "Casey: I'll show you payback.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, I thought we were gonna talk.",
        "Gwen: Look, you slept with Jade. You broke our marriage vows. What else is there to say?",
        "Will: Okay. Let's talk about something else. Like we used to. Let's talk about school or work, college, graduating, what we're gonna do afterwards, adopting kids.",
        "Gwen: Stop.",
        "Will: I can't. Gwen, I can't stop being married to you. It means everything to me. I love you.",
        "Gwen: I've gotta go.",
        "Will: Where?",
        "Gwen: To find Casey.",
        "Will: Yeah, that figures.",
        "Gwen: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Will: I'm still your husband.",
        "Gwen: No, don't. Don't you throw that in my face when the girl that you slept with is out there looking for you. You should just go home.",
        "Will: Is that really what you want?",
        "Gwen: I want you to leave me alone.",
        "Will: Gwen, wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ann: You are so dead! Oh, sorry. You scared me.",
        "Gil: It's okay. I just wanted to --",
        "Casey: Wanted to what?",
        "Gil: I wanted to tell you guys I organized a touch football game.",
        "Zach: Cool.",
        "Casey: Where's the field?",
        "Gil: It's a mile through the woods.",
        "Ann: A mile?",
        "Gil: It's a pretty walk. You'll like it. And we can build a fire, make hot dogs, smores and stuff.",
        "Ann: When were you planning on leaving?",
        "Gil: How about I meet you at the top of that trail in half an hour?",
        "Casey: I don't know, what do you guys think? Sounds like fun.",
        "Ann: Or not.",
        "Casey: Lighten up, ann. Everybody likes touch football. I'm gonna go see if Gwen wants to play, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You're creeping everybody out.",
        "Luke: I came here to talk to you, and I'm not leaving until I do.",
        "Kevin: Okay, talk.",
        "Luke: Here? Okay, look, I know why you're mad. It was because I bailed on you that night -- the night that you set up the double date.",
        "Kevin: You left us stranded.",
        "Luke: And I can explain why. But not here.",
        "Liv: Gil says they're organizing a touch football game.",
        "Kevin: When?",
        "Liv: Half an hour. We're gonna meet and then hike over to the field.",
        "Luke: Well, that gives us plenty of time.",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Look, don't leave without me. I'll settle things with him, and then I'll meet up with you.",
        "Liv: Are you sure?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. This better be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Case, over here.",
        "Casey: Hey, is that Will?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Look, I unloaded our stuff. I put it in with Ann and Zach's.",
        "Casey: What about Will? Is he gonna bunk with us, too?",
        "Gwen: Doesn't look like it. I guess he's leaving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Get in here, Sexy. I've got something I want to show you. Carly?",
        "Carly: Oh, oh, my God. Sorry. Oh, Boy. And I thought that Mike's timing was bad.",
        "Katie: What does that mean?",
        "Carly: Well, he walked in on something today -- you know what? It doesn't even matter. You guys have a good time, okay? Have fun. I really gotta go.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no, no, you don't. I'm not letting you leave here until you tell me what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I don't know why we had to came all the way back here.",
        "Luke: I had to get away from everybody. You know, no distractions. So I can get everything said.",
        "Kevin: Everything said about how you left us that night? That should take about two minutes.",
        "Luke: Well, it began before that. Back when -- [Luke sighs] This is so tough. Kevin, we've been friends for a really long time, and now it's like we can't even talk to each other.",
        "Kevin: That's because you got all weird.",
        "Luke: I know that's how it must seem. But there's stuff going on that you don't know about.",
        "Kevin: Look, if you're sick with the kidney thing, again -- I'd feel like a jerk if --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, no. I'm fine, it's not that. But I guess back when we were hanging out, you know, drinking all the time, I think that might have been part of it. You know, I was all messed up about almost dying.",
        "Kevin: That'll do it to you.",
        "Luke: But there was something else.",
        "Kevin: What?",
        "Luke: I was hiding. I had this -- this secret. And I didn't know what to do about it.",
        "Kevin: Secret? What, am I some kind of altar boy? Luke, whatever it is, you could have told me.",
        "Luke: Yeah? Okay, 'cause I was scared.",
        "Kevin: Of me? Why?",
        "Luke: Well, I didn't know how you'd react.",
        "Kevin: Well, just spit it out. Come on, man, what's the big secret?",
        "Luke: I'm gay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Hi.",
        "Will: Turn around -- turn around and just walk away.",
        "Jade: Why? What's going on?",
        "Will: I don't want to see you. I don't want to be anywhere near you.",
        "Jade: Why? What did I do?",
        "Will: You're here. You knew I came up here to get Gwen back. And still, you find a way to get right in my face. Why? Are you trying to ruin everything?",
        "Jade: No. That's why when I saw you with Gwen, I stayed away. I didn't come here for you.",
        "Will: So what, did you just decide to go spend the weekend in a cabin with no running water?",
        "Jade: I came for Luke.",
        "Will: What's wrong with Luke?",
        "Jade: He's coming out. He's telling everyone that he's gay, and he needs to know that there's gonna be people who are gonna support him afterwards. Like I will. And I was hopping that --",
        "Will: Yeah, I will. He knows that.",
        "Jade: Good. So, did I mess things up for you and Gwen?",
        "Will: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm gonna fix it. I'm not giving up on my marriage.",
        "Jade: Okay. I'm gonna stay out of your way.",
        "Will: Good. I'll hold you to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Hey guys. I grabbed these two bunks so I can be close to Ann.",
        "Ann: And so he can walk me to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I can't believe the bathrooms are outside. Yuck!",
        "Zach: There's still room for one more. Who do you think we'll get stuck with?",
        "Ann: I heard Will was around.",
        "Gwen: He was. He's gone now.",
        "Alex: Hi, guys! Whoa, guess we got the cool room, huh?",
        "Zach: It was the cool room.",
        "Gwen: Hey, how are you doing, Alex?",
        "Alex: Oh, great. Just great. Even though the outdoors really isn't my thing. You know, I'm kind of allergic.",
        "Gwen: Uh-huh. To what?",
        "Alex: Oh, everything, I guess. But it's okay, because I brought lots of antihistamine with me. And my inhaler. And tons of sun block. 'Cause you can never be too careful.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Alex: And I brought my cell phone, too. You know, just in case of emergency. But it hardly works up here.",
        "Gwen: Really?",
        "Alex: Yeah. I promised my stepmom I'd call her as soon as I got here, but before I could even tell her what cabin I was in, we got cut off.",
        "Ann: Oh, that's awful.",
        "Alex: Yeah, it really is, because you can never be too careful. Especially out here in the middle of nowhere with no lights or anything.",
        "Ann: Yeah, trying not to think about that part, thanks.",
        "Alex: Sorry.",
        "Zach: Alex, did you bring anything for snake bites?",
        "Alex: Yeah, sure did. Because you can never be --",
        "Zach: Wait, Alex, you forgot something!",
        "Gwen: Yeah, this is the cool room, all right.",
        "Ann: Zach, leave him alone.",
        "Zach: I'm just messing around.",
        "Ann: Are you okay, Alex? Stop it.",

        "Casey: Okay, fine. Then let's go play football.",
        "Gwen: Actually, I'm not in the mood. You go ahead.",

        "Alex: Are you guys going to the game?",
        "Casey: I am.",
        "Alex: Are you staying here, Gwen? Because if you are, we could hang out. I brought my own chess board. I even brought dominoes.",
        "Casey: Wow.",

        "Casey: No, wait, you sure you don't want to play dominoes?",
        "Gwen: You want to shut up, Casey? Great. Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Alex: Nothing. I felt like somebody was watching me.",
        "Casey: It's probably just an owl or a red hawk or something. Let's go.",
        "Gwen: Is it lame for me to be wearing flip-flops? How far is it to the football field?",

        "Carly: No, no, no, no, it's just for this special business thing. Anyway -- Simon was naked. I wasn't. I was not naked, not even for a moment. We were just talking, but that's when Mike walked in. And that's it.",
