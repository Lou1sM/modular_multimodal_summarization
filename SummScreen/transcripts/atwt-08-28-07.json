        "Jack suggests a movie, which thrills Carly thinking they will get alone time, except he wants everyone to go. Rosanna wants to know about Paul and Meg. Meg comes looking for Paul and an explanation. Craig realizes that Meg has gone to see Paul. Tom takes on Dusty as a client. Holden demands honesty from Lily, and she admits what happened to Dusty and how she has his gun. Paul explains succinctly his past with Meg, but he claims he is completely over her. Carly wants Brad to help her in her plan to get Jack alone at the movies, and Brad seemingly agrees, but then doesn't let her have alone time. He claims he is looking after Katie, which annoys Carly to no end. Margo agrees to release Dusty after Tom convinces her that there is no real evidence. Lily defends Dusty, which upsets Holden because he thinks she isn't thinking of her family again. Holden wants to go to the police with the gun because she is risking her freedom by keeping it. Paul and Meg come face to face and he is cold considering her choice in spouses, as Meg thinks she deserves an explanation, but she doesn't get one. Craig goes to see Rosanna and tries to convince her that he means well, but she is not interested. He is going to pay. Craig is convinced Paul is poisoning her against him, as Paul returns and taunts Craig about his freedom. Brad explains that he wants Katie happy, even if it isn't with him, and that Carly should stop the games. Holden brings Margo the gun, and they have to explain what happened. Dusty apologizes for putting Lily in the middle, as an angry Holden confronts him. Dusty rips up his statement and tells everyone what really happened. Carly is thrilled to massage Jack's leg when he has a cramp, which relaxes Jack as he lets her help him. Paul admits to Rosanna about seeing Meg, but claims they have closure now. He won't leave her side again; they will make Craig pay together. Meg is devastated by the way Paul treated her. Craig thinks they need to stand together to beat Paul because he is out to get both of them now. Meg thinks Paul hates her, and finds comfort in Craig's arms. Tom chides Dusty for not telling the truth and hopes there is nothing else he left out. Margo explains to Lily she may be in trouble, but it helped her that she came forward early. She better hope that Dusty's gun isn't the murder weapon. However, Margo then receives information from forensics; Dusty's gun was the murder weapon, as she arrests him for murder."

        "Carly: Hey, you're not supposed to overdo it. You know it.",
        "Jack: Oh, the jet wing weighs about two ounces. I think I can handle it.",
        "Carly: You're tense. That's why you keep getting these spasms. Will you let help you, okay?",
        "Jack: No, no, Honey, I don't need a massage. When I need is to get out of here. I can't sit around here for another whole day.",
        "Carly: Meg told you that you're in no condition to go anywhere.",
        "Jack: She didn't put me under house arrest. Where's the entertainment section of the newspaper?",
        "Carly: You want to go out?",
        "Jack: I want to see what movies are playing in Old Town?",
        "Carly: That's a great idea. Sage is on her sleepover. And the boys can look after themselves. What should we see? What looks good?",
        "Jack: Well, there's lots of summer blockbusters that J.J. missed out on. So, I think we could go see -- J.J., hey Parker, Guys, come down here! Let's go to the movies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The room's ready. Finally. Let's get you upstairs.",
        "Rosanna: No, just a second, you know, my memory may be a bit off, but I can still tell when you're lying to me, Paul.",
        "Paul: I'm not. The room's really ready. That's the truth, cross my heart --",
        "Rosanna: I'm not talking about the room. I'm talking about Meg Snyder. I saw the way that you looked her. You're in love with her.",
        "Paul: Whatever Meg and I did have, is now in the past.",
        "Rosanna: Do you realize that I've had to take your word for so many things? I believed you when you told me that Craig was responsible for trying to run me off the road.",
        "Paul: Do you want to see the police report?",
        "Rosanna: That's not the reason you're trying to get back at him, though, is it?",
        "Paul: You need another reason?",
        "Rosanna: It's because he took Meg away from you, isn't it?",
        "Paul: Okay, look, now's not a good time for you to be upset --",
        "Rosanna: Look, I'm upset, so don't treat me like some sort of porcelain doll, all right? I've had two year of life taken away from me. Two years! Do you know what the feels like? I don't know what -- what happened. I don't know what's going on. I don't know about all the important things, like you and me, and our relationship. Things that I need to know.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'll tell you what, why don't we go upstairs and I'll tell you exactly what I think of Meg Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Excuse me? Paul Ryan. He just checked in. I need his room number. It's an emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg? I brought you some tea. Meg? Meg! Meg!",
        "Maid: Mrs. Montgomery isn't here, Sir. She went out.",
        "Craig: Did she say where she was going? Never mind. I know exactly where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Dusty, you're lawyer is here.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for coming down, Tom. Sorry to call you so late.",
        "Tom: No problem. I was kind of bored at home. The wife's never around. You know? I'm sorry, did I say wife? Forgive me. This is going to be strictly professional.",
        "Margo: All right, let's just get down to it. I plan on holding your client for 24 hours without pressing charges.",
        "Tom: Well, I've read the police report and Dusty's statement. The only evidence the police have are Dusty's fingerprints in the room where Ms. Love was murdered. He has already admitted that he was there first after hearing the gunshots. You have no witnesses, no murder weapon. Therefore, no case.",
        "Margo: That may be. Unless there's more to this story that Dusty isn't telling us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, stop ducking the issue. What aren't you telling me about Dusty and this murder?",
        "Lily: Why do you assume that I'm lying?",
        "Holden: Look, there's a lot at stake here. And you promised me that you wouldn't lie to me anymore.",
        "Lily: I know I did.",
        "Holden: So tell me the truth -- all of it.",
        "Lily: The woman that was killed, she was a prostitute. The name was Cheri Love. She's the one that posted on the internet -- the video of Alison and Dusty having sex. Well, Dusty was in the room with her at the hotel when she was shot.",
        "Holden: So Dusty witnessed the murder?",
        "Lily: No, he didn't. He was passed out. His drink had been drugged. He didn't know what happened until he woke up and he saw the body.",
        "Holden: Why didn't you tell me this before?",
        "Lily: Well Dusty could -- he will definitely be a suspect.",
        "Holden: And that's why you're upset?",
        "Lily: No, there's more. This is the part you're really not going to like. When Dusty woke up at the crime scene, he saw a gun. And it was his gun.",
        "Holden: And what does this have to do with you?",
        "Lily: Well, Margo took him down to the station to interrogate him, before they could frisk him, he gave me his gun, and I hid it for him. And I kept it --",
        "Holden: You hid a murder weapon?",
        "Lily: We don't know it's the murder weapon for sure.",
        "Holden: That's because the cops didn't have the chance to find out. Lily, that's obstruction of justice. You committed a felony! Do you realize that you could go to jail for that? And that if you've hidden the gun in this house, me and my mother could go to jail right along with you?",
        "Holden: Lily, where's the gun? Tell me. Did Dusty ask you to do this?",
        "Lily: No, he didn't. It was -- it was my idea. I was not thinking. I was just trying to help a friend.",
        "Holden: What kind of friend does this to you? He made you an accessory to murder.",
        "Lily: No, he didn't. Because he is innocent.",
        "Holden: Lily, would you stop defending him? Did it occur to you that maybe he might be using you to cover his own tracks?",
        "Lily: No, because it was my idea to take the gun.",
        "Holden: Lily, it's possible. I'm telling you, he might have done this.",
        "Lily: No he didn't.",
        "Holden: Lily, that woman -- she exposed his affair with Alison. She put that video on the web. That is motive.",
        "Lily: Dusty -- you've known him, I've known him since we were kids. He did not do this. I trust him.",
        "Holden: Really? Do you trust him enough to risk your freedom, your marriage, your family, all to cover evidence of a murder?",
        "Lily: He's my friend. I know that he is innocent.",
        "Holden: Lily, he doesn't know what happened. He was drugged. Face it, taking that gun was wrong. There is no way that you and Dusty are going to get away with this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Desk clerk: Ma'am, once again, we don't give out room numbers, it's hotel policy.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, can't you bend the house rules just this once? He just checked in. In fact, he may be registered under Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Desk clerk: It's a matter of privacy for our guests.",
        "Meg: Look, it's an emergency. Okay? I need to speak to Paul Ryan.",
        "Desk clerk: You're welcome to use our house phone. I'll connect you.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Please hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Do you need a pillow or something?",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Rosanna: No. Are you going to answer that?",
        "Paul: No. I'll let it go to voicemail. So, let's talk about Meg. I was in love with Meg. But it's over.",
        "Rosanna: This is your idea of full disclosure?",
        "Paul: What do you want me to say?",
        "Rosanna: You obviously still care about her.",
        "Paul: What I had with Meg was a mistake. I can see that now.",
        "Rosanna: Why, because she's with Craig now?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: And you're not using me to get back at Craig because he's taken her away from you?",
        "Paul: No. I would never use you. Look, I want to get back at Craig for what he's done to you, but it's got nothing to do with Meg.",
        "Rosanna: I'm starting to think it has nothing to do with me, either.",
        "Paul: Don't say that --",
        "Rosanna: Why not? You're not telling me everything. What choice do I have but to draw my own conclusions?",
        "Paul: What do you want to hear? You want to hear about how we used to fight? Would you like to hear about I used her. How about I tell you how disappointed she used to make me feel? I was in love with Meg, but now I'm not. What else do you want to hear?",
        "Rosanna: I saw how you reacted when Meg showed up. I saw how you reacted when she was wearing Craig's ring.",
        "Paul: Everybody knows how I feel about Craig. And if she stayed married to him, that's fine. That's her choice. That's her choice. And I've made my decision. I'm never going back to Meg -- ever. And now I can see how wrong I was to ever trust her to begin with.",
        "Rosanna: And you're telling me that you wouldn't want her back? Even if Craig was out of the picture?",
        "Paul: All I care about is you. Do you believe me?",
        "Rosanna: I want to.",
        "Paul: I guess that's all I can ask for tonight. Let's get you some medicine and you can get some rest.",
        "Rosanna: I hate taking those pills.",
        "Paul: There's no water. I'm going to run down to the bar and see if I can get you a bottle of water.",
        "Rosanna: You think of everything.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, from now on, all I think about is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hello. I just came to check in on my brother. Make sure he wasn't hanging from the ceiling with an exotic dancer.",
        "Carly: That's more your style, isn't it, Brad?",
        "Brad: You know, you could at least pretend to be happy to see me.",
        "Carly: You know something? I actually am. This time, your timing is actually perfect. You're going to come to the movies with us.",
        "Brad: I could do a movie. Okay, what's playing?",
        "Carly: No, I need you to offer to take the boys to whatever they want to see. See, I can use this time to be with Jack alone. You know, maybe a romantic movie. Our hands meeting and touching in the bag of buttered popcorn.",
        "Brad: You know, did you forget that Jack is still engaged to Katie?",
        "Carly: That is a mistake that can be rectified.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. You're good at rectifying stuff. But who has to pick up the pieces?",
        "Carly: Brad, listen to me. You, Parker, J.J. -- a movie. You got it?",
        "Brad: Okay -- but I doubt you'll get anywhere with Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly, you ready to go? Hey, Brad.",
        "Brad: Hey, there he is! Whoa.",
        "Jack: No, no, no.",
        "Carly: I've asked Brad to come to the movies with us.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I'm crashing.",
        "Carly: The more the merrier, right?",
        "Jack: Sure, no problem at all. Hey, Guys, come on. Let's get going. We don't want to be sold out.",
        "Carly: This was a really good idea, Jack. I bet we're going to have a really great time.",
        "Jack: We are on the last row. I thought you liked sitting closer?",
        "Carly: It's perfect.",
        "Jack: I wish Brad hadn't taken the boys to another movie.",
        "Carly: They love that pirate stuff, you know that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, they love this cop hero stuff, too.",
        "Carly: Well, they already have their own cop hero -- they don't need to see the movie about one.",
        "Jack: Carly, can you give me some room here?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure. You okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Brad: Break it up, you two.",
        "Jack: Hey, you changed your mind about the other movie? Sit here. Sit here.",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Brad: What? This seat's not taken.",
        "Carly: You were supposed to take them to the pirate movie.",
        "Brad: It was boring.",
        "Carly: Well, they've seen all the other ones.",
        "J.J.: Yeah, it's getting old.",
        "Parker: It was lame.",
        "Carly: But you don't have tickets to this movie.",
        "Brad: You have no worries. I'm like this tight with the girl at the door.",
        "Carly: She's in high school.",
        "Brad: College. Pre-med. Junior. Got her number.",
        "Carly: You were supposed to be keeping the boys busy --",
        "Theatergoer: Hey, Lady -- give your mouth a rest!",
        "Carly: Hey how about you? We can hear you chomping on that popcorn like that.",
        "Theatergoer: Shut it, or I'll get the manager.",
        "Jack: Carly. Sorry.",
        "Carly: You intentionally interfered with my time with Jack.",
        "Brad: No, I am saving you from yourself. Scheming to get Jack back is really dumb.",
        "Carly: Whose side are you on?",
        "Brad: I'm doing a favor, okay?",
        "Carly: For who?",
        "Brad: Keeping an eye on Jack -- for Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Come on, Margo, you know you don't have enough evidence to make a murder charge stick.",
        "Margo: Not yet. But I do plan on keeping Dusty here until I find out what it is he is holding back.",
        "Tom: What, you think he's going to get bored and confess to a crime he didn't commit?",
        "Margo: No, but I just got a hunch that he's not so innocent.",
        "Tom: Well, you can't put him behind bars because you have a hunch.",
        "Margo: Come on, just between you and me -- you and me. Don't you think there's more in this story than Dusty's letting on?",
        "Tom: Client-lawyer privilege supersedes our relationship.",
        "Margo: I liked it so much better when you were the D.A. and we were fighting on the same side.",
        "Tom: You know, you're a good cop, you're a terrific person, and you always do the right thing.",
        "Margo: Well Dusty, you have the best lawyer in the state. I will draw up the paperwork and you're free to go. Don't you dare gloat.",
        "Dusty: Thank you, Tom. I appreciate your help.",
        "Tom: Open and shut case. Dusty, they don't have enough evidence to hold you. So, no smoking gun, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Someone obviously set Dusty up to frame him for murder. I had to help him. He'd do the same for me.",
        "Holden: Lily. You're doing more harm, than good. Not to mention what you're doing to this family. You left a gun under the sink! Is it loaded?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Holden: What if Faith or Natalie had found it, or one of Jack's kids?",
        "Lily: You're right. I wasn't -- I wasn't thinking. I just didn't know what else to do.",
        "Holden: There's only one thing to do. We turn the gun over to the police.",
        "Lily: What? No, no, no, no. I can not let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: Good to have you back, Mr. Ryan.",
        "Paul: Thank you. It's great to be back, I guess.",
        "Meg: Don't you walk away from me. Don't you dare do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Florist: Hey these are for -- Rosanna Cabot. Sir, I can't make out the room.",
        "Desk clerk: She's in Mr. Ryan's room. I'll write it down for you.",
        "Florist: Thanks.",
        "Craig: Good work. Got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Meg: Three words would have been nice -- \"Meg, I'm alive.\" Why didn't call me? How could you make me think -- how could you do that to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Rosanna: Hey. Did you forget your key?",
        "Craig: Surprise. Yes, I was hoping that I would find you alone.",
        "Rosanna: Why? Are you going to try and kill me again?",
        "Craig: These aren't poison, Rosanna. They are to welcome you home.",
        "Rosanna: I don't want them. Don't touch me!",
        "Craig: Do you really think that I would come here to hurt you?",
        "Rosanna: Why not? You've done it before.",
        "Craig: All right, has Paul Ryan been filling your head with nonsense? Because the man is certifiable, you know. He has visions. They should lock him up.",
        "Rosanna: You first.",
        "Craig: I know this is probably very disconcerting for you. Actually hearing everything -- Paul's spin on things.",
        "Rosanna: You mean hearing the truth, you mean?",
        "Craig: We are all grateful that you have come back to us, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: We? Yes, the royal we, how impersonal of you Craig. I was your wife.",
        "Craig: I remember. Do you?",
        "Rosanna: I try not to. Because when I think about how much I loved you, and how much I wanted to have a family with you -- it makes the betrayal a little more difficult to bear. And you now have a new wife.",
        "Craig: Things change.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, for the better. Don't you think? I'd rather not be tied to a man who doesn't exactly have my best interests at heart.",
        "Craig: You don't think that Paul Ryan has your best interests at heart? The man has an agenda, Rosanna. Do not trust him, especially not in this condition.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, and you don't have agenda? No, you're just here to bring me flowers and warn me about Paul. I don't think so. I think you're just a little bit more self-serving than that.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, is this from your recollection, or are you parroting Paul? Because the man is not going to paint me in a very favorable light.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I don't need Paul to paint me a picture you. It's actually quite clear that you have taken everything that was once mine and made yourself quite comfortable.",
        "Craig: I was put in charge oh your assets -- which I have invested wisely.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really? By turning Worldwide over to your new wife?",
        "Craig: It's Montgomery Enterprises and Meg and I are a team.",
        "Rosanna: That poor girl doesn't know what she's in for, does she?",
        "Craig: Speaking of my wife -- she left the house very early this morning without telling me where she was going. And I can't seem to find her. Unless -- do you know where Paul is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, hey. Why did you do it? Why did you let me think you were dead, that I would never see you again? Do you know how grief-stricken I was?",
        "Paul: You wear your grief well. You and Craig -- you were celebrating tonight.",
        "Meg: Do you know what I've been through? Do you know what your family, your friends -- what they've through? It was hell.",
        "Paul: You made your choices. You're married to Craig. You're living in Rosanna's mansion, spending her money. Tell me, did you arrive tonight in Craig's limousine?",
        "Meg: Okay, stop it. Don't mock me.",
        "Paul: Don't make it so easy.",
        "Meg: At least you owe me an explanation.",
        "Paul: I owe you -- nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily! We have to go to the police. You committed a crime by taking the gun in the first place. If we take it back maybe we can minimize the damage.",
        "Lily: What about Dusty? If we bring back the gun it's only going make things worse for him. He's my oldest friend.",
        "Holden: You should be more concerned about what's going to happen to your family if you go to jail along with your oldest friend!",
        "Lily: There's got to be something else we can do. Please, we can fix this. You can help me. Come with an idea.",
        "Holden: Okay, all right. Here's an idea. Put a stop to this, or I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie asked you to baby-sit Jack for her?",
        "Brad: Actually, she told me not to.",
        "Carly: Then what are you doing?",
        "Brad: Somebody has to keep you in line while Katie's away.",
        "Carly: But you want Katie for yourself. You should be helping me get back together with Jack.",
        "Brad: No, she hates it when I go behind her back to mess things up for her. She likes it when I help. So I am helping Katie be with Jack.",
        "Carly: Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?",
        "Jack: Okay, would you two stop it? Please. What's going on?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, I have to explain like every single plot point to your brother because he's an idiot.",
        "Brad: Me? You lost the game to Katie, and now you're trying to make time with Jack in the end zone.",
        "Carly: I've lost Jack before -- I always get him back. It's what I do.",
        "Brad: You know, you can put it on your business card. But if Jack ain't buying, you're out of work.",
        "Theatergoer: Will you people shut up?",
        "Jack: Seriously, do I have to separate you two?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yes, I prefer to sit next to you.",
        "J.J.: You know, everyone's looking at us. Why don't we just go?",
        "Parker: Yeah, we've seen this movie before. We know how it ends.",
        "Jack: You guys want pizza? Come on, grab your stuff.",
        "Brad: But I just bought this big popcorn.",
        "Carly: You're making a big mistake, Brad.",
        "Brad: You know, I don't think so. Katie's going to thank me. And you're going nowhere with Jack.",
        "Carly: I'm going to do something about that tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Paul and Meg are like a lit match and gasoline -- it is an explosive combination.",
        "Rosanna: It's not like you to be so insecure, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm just trying to tell you something that Paul will not admit. He loves Meg. And everything that Paul Ryan does and says is motivated by a very deep-seated, sick obsession with her.",
        "Paul: Don't mean to take the air out of your big news. But Rosanna already knows that I had feelings for Meg.",
        "Craig: Had?",
        "Paul: Well, those feelings are over.",
        "Craig: And where were you just now, Paul? Were you with my wife?",
        "Paul: The two of you deserve each other. I hope every six months or so you can get conjugal visits, after you're charged. And convicted.",
        "Craig: Convicted of what? Everyone knows that Rosanna's accident was just that -- an accident. And I have already spent time in prison for that, erroneously.",
        "Paul: So many crimes, so little jail time. Until Rosanna testifies against you.",
        "Rosanna: And I will testify.",
        "Craig: Oh, no doubt. No doubt. But what happens under cross-examination? Come on Paul. A first-year law student could prove that you're the one supplying her with these so-called memories.",
        "Paul: I think you should leave.",
        "Craig: If you care for Rosanna, don't do this to her, Paul. Don't. There is not a court anywhere that will take action based on the clouded memories of some woman who's just spent two years in a coma.",
        "Paul: Craig, Rosanna's recovering a lot faster than we'd hoped. I don't think it will be long at all before she remembers everything you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: Hey, Dad, if you're not tired, is there any way we can finish up the model with the turbo booster?",
        "Jack: Sure. Why not? Hey J.J., why don't you grab this and bring it upstairs. Parker, grab a pizza.",
        "Carly: What about our family dinner, here?",
        "Jack: Oh, family -- Brad's family. Why don't you finish that conversation you were having at the movie theater?",
        "Brad: Well, so much for your romantic night with Jack.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know about that. What could be more romantic than family time? It's the most important thing in the world to Jack. And I'm a big part of this family, and I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Brad: No, but Jack is -- soon as he moves in with Katie. Then we're talking shared custody. Sad but true. And then lots of lonely nights for Carly ordering takeout pizza for one. Can you pass me one of those, please. Easy.",
        "Carly: What is the matter with you? If you didn't want to help me, why didn't you just say something?",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, okay? And with your temper, I can see why Jack is with Katie.",
        "Carly: Katie can not give Jack what he wants -- his family. He will always want to spend time with me and our children.",
        "Brad: Then why is she wearing his ring?",
        "Carly: Why are you so supportive of them all of a sudden? I thought you wanted Katie to yourself.",
        "Brad: Maybe that's not what I want. Maybe I want Katie to be happy. And if that means being with Jack, so be it.",
        "Carly: Get this is into your head. Jack always comes back to Carly. Carly always comes back to Jack. It's inevitable. Nothing can keep us apart.",
        "Brad: Why? Because you're not just a couple of people who used to be married. You're Carly and Jack -- a force of nature.",
        "Carly: Something you'll never understand.",
        "Brad: I understand that you're slap-your-face crazy if you think you've got a snowball's chance in hell to be with Jack, all right.",
        "Carly: Why do I even bother talking to you? Why?",
        "Brad: You know what? You need somebody to help you see the light.",
        "Carly: You know -- just get out of here. Thanks for nothing, as usual. Get out!",
        "Brad: Well, glad to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Got a minute? It's important.",
        "Margo: Sure. What's up?",
        "Holden: I think we may have some critical evidence in the Lakeview murder case.",
        "Margo: Does someone want to explain this?",
        "Lily: It's my fault.",
        "Dusty: No, it isn't, Lily. It's my fault. Everything in this statement right here, it's a lie.",
        "Margo: And seeing the gun jarred your memory, huh?",
        "Dusty: Here's the truth, Cheri wanted to meet me. I went to her room. And she gave me a drink that was drugged. I passed out on the floor. And when I woke up, Cheri was laying next to me with a bullet in her chest. And my gun was lying next to here. I have no idea how it got there.",
        "Margo: How did Holden and Lily get the gun?",
        "Lily: It wasn't Holden, it was me.",
        "Dusty: I took the gun from the crime scene, and gave it to Lily just before I gave you my statement.",
        "Lily: It was my idea.",
        "Margo: All right, I'm going to get statements from all of you. But first things first. Harrison? I need you to take this gun down to the lab and see if it's been fired recently. Get back to me ASAP with the ballistics report.",
        "Cop #1: You got it, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: You two had better hope that that is not the gun that was used to kill that woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here you go.",
        "Jack: That's wonderful.",
        "Carly: The boys are fast asleep.",
        "Jack: Oh, good. Parker will never admit it, but he's really happy to have J.J. back.",
        "Carly: It's nice to be a family again, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Yes, it is.",
        "Carly: Hey, I'm sorry about Brad and the movie.",
        "Jack: No, that's all right. The kids were right. It wasn't that great of a movie anyway. And frankly, I've seen action lately. And if I never see another cops vs. ex-con movie again, I won't miss it.",
        "Carly: You and me both. You know, you don't look very comfortable. Why don't you let me take the couch tonight?",
        "Jack: No, Carly. Its fine, it really is. It's just that -- oh, ow. Leg cramp.",
        "Carly: A leg cramp?",
        "Jack: From the ping-pong championship earlier. No, no, no, it's all right.",
        "Carly: Just make room.",
        "Jack: It'll go away on its own. You don't have to -- you don't -- oh, that really feel good, yeah. Oh, right there. Oh, you can't do this all night though.",
        "Carly: I might jump you bones. Just close your eyes. It'll help you sleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I think it's too late to call Carly. Don't you? I don't want to wake the kids.",
        "Paul: We'll give her the good news in the morning. Here, take these.",
        "Rosanna: When are you going to stop treating me like an invalid?",
        "Paul: When you get better. I like taking care of you.",
        "Rosanna: You're sweet.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry I left you -- your side before. Let Craig get to you.",
        "Rosanna: That's all right. He tried to convince me you were with Meg.",
        "Paul: I was. That's why I took so long. She was in the lounge. She was looking for me.",
        "Rosanna: Why -- why would she do that?",
        "Paul: She wanted closure and I gave it to her. You don't have to worry about Meg, she's not our problem. She's Craig's problem now.",
        "Rosanna: How do you feel about that?",
        "Paul: I'm just glad I found you.",
        "Rosanna: I want us to get back the life we should've had. I want us to do it together.",
        "Paul: Well, then let's do that.",
        "Rosanna: I'm just having such a hard time remembering.",
        "Paul: You will.",
        "Rosanna: It's just so much more difficult then I thought it was going to be mentally and physically and what if I don't remember everything that Craig did that night? I mean, what if -- what if he gets away with it.",
        "Paul: He won't. Come here. Lie back. Craig is never going to hurt you again. If he tries, I'll be right by your side, always. I won't ever let anybody take you away from me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You all right?",
        "Meg: I went back to the Lakeview -- to see Paul.",
        "Craig: I know. I followed you. I was worried.",
        "Meg: I didn't see you.",
        "Craig: What did Paul say?",
        "Meg: He didn't want to talk to me. And the way he looked at me -- it's like I had betrayed him.",
        "Craig: He has no right to treat you that way.",
        "Meg: I couldn't get him to understand, Craig. He won't even listen to me. It felt like I was losing him all over again. And I'll never get him back.",
        "Craig: Listen, that being honest with each other thing -- is there any wiggle room in that?",
        "Meg: What did you do?",
        "Craig: When you were seeing Paul, I went to see Rosanna. I wanted to find out what they were up to. He's manipulating her, he's trying to use her against us.",
        "Meg: How?",
        "Craig: Tales of crimes of one another -- some made up -- unfortunately, for Paul, he doesn't realize how fragile her mental state is. She's not going to be much of an adversary.",
        "Meg: Paul hates me now. Almost as much as he hates you.",
        "Craig: As long as we stick together, Paul can't get to us. He can't -- he can't touch what we have. You get some sleep, okay?",
        "Meg: No wait. Stay with me. Hold me.",
        "Craig: Oh, Meg. Oh, Meg, I'll never let you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Taking the gun from the scene? Dumb move, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I know.",
        "Tom: Getting Lily involved -- even dumber.",
        "Dusty: You're right.",
        "Tom: Not telling your lawyer -- the dumbest of all. Now, unless you want me to stop representing you right now, you swear to me you're not hiding anything else.",
        "Dusty: What I said out there was the truth.",
        "Tom: Well, let's hope it's not too little, too late.",
        "Margo: I want you to read over the statements and sign them.",
        "Holden: Margo, be straight with us. How bad is this?",
        "Margo: Oh, it's bad. But the fact that you insisted that Lily bring the gun in immediately is good. The fact that you took the gun in the first place -- do you realize how many crimes you may have committed?",
        "Holden: So what kind of charges could we be looking at here?",
        "Margo: Evidence tampering, obstruction of justice. And if it does turn out that that gun is the one that killed Ms. Love, then you're going to be facing an accessory to murder after the fact.",
        "Lily: Oh, God help me.",
        "Margo: I don't think we need to go to the Lord quite yet. The fact that you knew you made a mistake and you corrected immediately will count for you. And I will emphasize that with the D.A.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Holden: All right, we appreciate all your help. Can I take her home?",
        "Margo: Yeah, just a second. Hughes. Yeah, would you bring it right up? Thank you. Lily, you can go, but don't leave town.",
        "Lily: I am so sorry, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: It's not your fault.",
        "Holden: Next time my wife offers to commit a crime for you, do me a favor and just say no.",
        "Lily: Please, don't --",
        "Holden: I'm taking you home.",
        "Margo: Oh, hold on. Hold on. We got a positive id on the bullet that was removed from the murder victim. It came from Dusty's gun. Dusty Donovan, you're under arrest for the murder of Cheri Love. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can not afford an attorney, one will be provided for you by the state. Do you understand?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Craig: So, Paul doesn't want you? Well, he's a fool.",
        "Rosanna: If you want Meg to suffer, I can't imagine a worse fate than the one she's chosen for herself.",
        "Henry: It's a contract to sell the diner.",
        "Alison: I'm really sorry Barbara. Gwen and Will -- they lost the baby."
