        "Craig: I think I've found a way to slash the marketing budget for Midday Sun.",
        "Rosanna: Hmm. Do these numbers include that photo shoot you had with Parker the other day?",
        "Craig: Of course they do. But the important figures are at the bottom of page two. That's where you'll see how much money we can save.",
        "Rosanna: When am I gonna see those pictures?",
        "Craig: What pictures?",
        "Rosanna: From the last-minute photo shoot.",
        "Craig: Oh, the photographer sent those directly to the agency.",
        "Rosanna: That's interesting. He's never done that before.",
        "Craig: First time for everything.",
        "Rosanna: Hmm. You're not holding out on me, are you, Craig? Because that definitely would not be a first.",

        "Janet: Liberty? Libby-Lou! Come here. Hi. Oh, Honey, you look like hell.",
        "Liberty: Love you, too, Mom.",
        "Janet: Oh, Sweetheart, this has been going on way too long. How's your stomach?",
        "Liberty: Aw, it's barely inside of me.",
        "Janet: Okay, she's had this bug for a couple days. A couple days too many, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Liberty: I'll be fine.",
        "Janet: If I didn't have this shift this morning, I'd take you down to Memorial. In fact, I think I should call Henry and get to switch with June. So, that way, I can take her.",
        "Teri: Don't do that, don't do that. I can take Liberty to the doctor.",
        "Liberty: Guys, I'm gonna have ginger ale. I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Janet: Really? I would appreciate it so much.",
        "Teri: Oh, no problem.",
        "Janet: Great, oh, great! Okay, I'll go upstairs and get the insurance card and a couple bucks for the co-pay. Thank you, thank you!",
        "Teri: Sure, sure.",
        "Liberty: Look, Aunt Teri, my mom's totally overreacting. I do not need to go to the doctor.",
        "Teri: I think you do need to see a doctor. Just maybe not the kind of doctor your mom has in mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Meg? How are you? We didn't get a chance to talk much after the funeral.",
        "Meg: No, no, it's okay. You were busy. I mean, you had to take Lily home, and there was so much going on.",
        "Damian: Meg, you have to understand --",
        "Meg: You know, it's been busy here, too. I mean, Seth and Aaron decided to stay a few more days.",
        "Damian: That makes your -- must make your mother very happy.",
        "Meg: It's a big help having family here. Until you look around and realize who's missing. No matter what we start talking about, we always end up back on Holden.",
        "Damian: I wish there was something I could do.",
        "Meg: There is.",
        "Damian: What can I do? Just tell me.",
        "Meg: Take me away. Make love to me, Damian.",

        "Lily: We haven't had much of a chance to talk lately.",
        "Faith: What is there to talk about?",
        "Lily: A lot. Your whole world has been blown apart, Faith.",
        "Faith: I'll be fine. Where are you going, dressed like that?",
        "Lily: I'm going to the foundation office. I have a lot to catch up on. Do you have a problem with me going to work?",
        "Faith: No, of course not. I wouldn't expect you to stay home and be upset about Dad or anything.",

        "[Door opens]",
        "[Chains rattling]",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Maeve: Oh, you're awake. Guess you just about wore yourself out with all that screaming and hollering last night, huh?",
        "Holden: Get these chains off me, now.",
        "[Maeve sighs]",
        "Maeve: Why don't you just sit back, and I can put the tray down. Fine, suit yourself. I thought you -- aah!",
        "Holden: Unlock the chains now!",
        "Maeve: Turn me loose! Aah!",
        "Holden: Let me go.",
        "Eb: Looks like he wasn't hungry after all.",
        "Holden: I said, let me go.",
        "Eb: We'll let you go as soon as you tell us where the money is.",
        "Holden: You know, I've told you a thousand times, I don't know what you're talking about!",
        "Eb: Well, in that case, we got ourselves a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How can you say that? You have to know what losing your father has done to me.",
        "Faith: And that's why you're all dressed up ready to go to work the day after his funeral?",
        "Lily: I thought -- I hoped that if I focused on something constructive, I might feel a little more human.",
        "Faith: Go for it. As long as it makes you feel good, doesn't even matter what anybody else feels?",
        "Lily: Okay, obviously, you have a problem with me going to work, and that is okay. We can sit down and talk about it.",
        "Faith: No, don't stay on my account! I'm going to the farm, riding!",
        "Lily: Faith, don't leave without telling me what's wrong!",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "[Lily scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eb: Now, get out of the way.",
        "Maeve: No, no, no. You don't want to do this.",
        "Eb: Did you hear me?",
        "Holden: He's right, Maeve. Maybe you should stand aside. Listen, Eb. Just put down the gun, okay? Nobody needs to get hurt here. Let's just -- let's just talk about this like reasonable people.",
        "Eb: You just tell us where the money is, we'll be reasonable as you like!",
        "Holden: You keep talking about this money that I don't know anything about. Maybe if, you know, you explained to me what you were referring to, maybe we could get somewhere.",
        "Eb: Like you don't know. All right, we'll play it your way. I want the money that Skaggs stole and hid from me before he got arrested! Are you happy?",
        "Holden: Okay, so, we're talking about stolen money.",
        "Eb: We're talking about my money! A share of that money was mine, fair and square! But Skaggs got picked up before we could split it up.",
        "Maeve: And that's the last we ever heard of it.",
        "Eb: All these years of scraping by when there's all that money out there somewhere just waiting to get spent! But Skaggs says we got to wait till he gets out. So, he breaks out of jail, and there you are, picking him up on the side of the road!",
        "Holden: I didn't just pick him up. Remember? He hijacked me.",
        "Eb: So you say. Well, here's how I think it went down. I think you and Skaggs set this up, maybe when you were in the stir together.",
        "Maeve: No, come on, Eb. He doesn't look like the type to be against the law.",
        "Eb: Yeah, and then you two were on your way here to kill me so you could get away with my share of the take!",
        "Holden: I don't know anything about this money! I swear to you, I never saw Skaggs before the other day!",
        "Eb: I sure thought spending the night in chains would make you a little bit more cooperative. But I guess I was wrong.",
        "Maeve: Eb, Eb, Eb. Let's just you and me talk. Come on. Come on, baby. Look, you got to stop waving that gun around. It goes off, takes that man's head off, you're never gonna get your money.",
        "Eb: You telling me how to run my business, Maeve?",
        "Maeve: No, no. I'm just saying, let me talk to him. Maybe I can get the truth out of him.",

        "Damian: I'm happy I'm the one you're reaching out for.",

        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: I thought I needed to get out of the house, but now I see all these papers stacked on my desk.",
        "Damian: You don't have to worry about such things right now.",
        "Lily: I'm fine. I just -- I could use some help sorting through everything that's happened since I've been out. And I hate to ask Luke.",
        "Damian: I understand.",
        "Lily: Is there any chance that you could lend me a hand?",
        "Damian: I'll be right over.",

        "Liberty: Did you guys not hear me? I said I don't need to see a doctor.",
        "Janet: And, Theresa, do me a huge favor. Call me as soon as you're finished with the doctor, okay?",
        "Teri: Of course, of course I will.",
        "Janet: Okay. Sweetie, Libby Lou, I love you, baby. Feel better. Okay, bye.",
        "Teri: Bye, bye.",
        "Liberty: Look, my mom is worried about nothing. I really do not need to go see a doctor.",
        "Teri: I think that you do.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm gonna get some water, and I'm gonna go back to bed. I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Teri: Liberty, are you sure that there is nothing you want to talk to me about?",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Teri: Okay, look, I know that I shouldn't have, but I saw what was in that bag from the drugstore the other day.",
        "Liberty: What bag?",
        "Teri: The one with the pregnancy test in it.",
        "[Refrigerator door closes]",
        "Liberty: Oh, God, um, look, that wasn't -- that wasn't for me. I was getting rid of that for a friend, so I --",
        "Teri: And that's why you brought it all the way home?",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Teri: Liberty, it's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.",
        "Liberty: How? I'm 17, and I -- I don't know what I'm supposed to do. My mom is gonna kill me.",
        "Teri: Whey don't you start by letting me help you.",
        "Liberty: How?",
        "Teri: Well, first, we need to get you to a doctor.",
        "Liberty: Why? So they can tell me I'm pregnant? I already know that I am.",
        "Teri: Well, let's be sure, because those tests are not always 100 percent.",
        "Liberty: You think the test could be wrong?",
        "Teri: You know, even if they're not, you still need to see a doctor to discuss your options.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Okay. Please, will you swear to me that you will not tell anyone about this?",
        "Teri: Of course not, of course not. Nobody else needs to know.",

        "Craig: No one's holding out on your, Rosanna. I'm just trying to prioritize.",
        "Rosanna: Really?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rosanna: You know what I think? I think you're either keeping something from me or the photo shoot never happened at all.",
        "Craig: The photo shoot happened. Parker nailed it, as usual. You'll see for yourself soon enough.",
        "Rosanna: You just can't tell me when.",
        "Craig: Well, if you want to hold your breath, feel free. In the meantime, go through the financials and let me know what you think, not that you ever needed my permission to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Teri: Hi, Craig.",
        "Craig: Hey, I think we have a problem with Rosanna.",
        "Teri: Well, what's wrong?",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Liberty: I should go, get this over with.",
        "Teri: I have to go. I have a doctor's appointment. I'll talk to you later, okay?",
        "Craig: Teri, are you still there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Damian: What happened?",
        "Lily: Nothing. I, uh -- I just dropped some papers.",
        "Damian: Here, let me.",
        "Lily: No, I did it. I can pick them up. I said I'd do it!",
        "Damian: Hey, I'm just trying to help.",
        "Lily: I don't need your help! I don't want your help!",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Damian: Cara, you called me here.",
        "Lily: I know, I know, and that was a mistake. I should be able to handle this myself. I -- I -- I shouldn't have called you.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Damian: You don't have to handle everything by yourself.",
        "Lily: Look, I said I can do this. Please leave. Just -- just leave me alone.",

        "Damian: I'm not going anywhere. Come here, come here. Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Maeve sighs]",
        "Maeve: Look, I'm sorry. I really got to apologize for Eb. Deep down inside, he's really a good man, really. He's just dead set about getting this money. Please don't get him all upset again. I'm afraid he might hurt you, and I'd hate to see that happen.",
        "Holden: The way you stood in front of his gun, you're just as likely to get hurt. I wouldn't want to see that happen.",
        "Maeve: You wouldn't?",
        "Holden: No. You've been good to me. And you seem to understand that I need to get home.",
        "Maeve: To Lily?",
        "Holden: How did you know her name?",
        "Maeve: You kept calling out to her in your sleep. Who is she?",
        "Holden: My wife.",
        "Maeve: Right. Wife. How come you don't wear a wedding ring?",
        "Holden: Skaggs stole it from me, along with my clothes and my wallet.",
        "Maeve: That sounds like him. Out for everything he can get. She must be missing you an awful lot.",
        "Holden: If you understand that, then let me get back to her. Think about what she must be going through, not knowing whether I'm alive or dead.",
        "Maeve: I'm sorry. I am. But it's not my fault.",
        "Holden: Look, you're not responsible for what got me here, but I am under your roof. Maeve, you got to do the right thing. You have to let me go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, how are you doing? Yesterday was pretty tough on all of us. I know it was on you.",
        "Faith: It was.",
        "Meg: You know, the only advice I could give you is that it does get easier every day, until, one day, it doesn't hurt as much as it does now.",
        "Faith: Promise?",
        "Meg: Come here. Oh.",
        "Faith: I've been in the barn. I don't want to mess up your outfit.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Doesn't matter. You know that.",
        "Faith: Where are you going, all dressed up, anyways?",
        "Meg: I'm gonna go meet Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I thought, if I could just put one foot in front of the other and come to the office, I might feel a little bit more normal.",
        "Damian: There's no need to put any pressure on yourself, Lily.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but I got to go through the motions, don't I? I can make it through the day, I can make it through the night and the next day and the day after that. And maybe, one day, I'll figure out a way to live this strange, new life.",
        "Damian: A life without Holden, you mean.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but I failed on my first attempt. I got here and I just panicked. I feel so alone.",
        "Damian: Hey. You're not alone. As long as I'm around, you'll never be alone.",
        "Lily: I appreciate everything you're doing for me, Damian, but you must be tired of propping me up.",
        "Damian: Hey, Lily, we've seen each other at our best and our worst. I think, deep down, you know that there's nothing you can ever say or do that could change how I feel about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Hey, perfect timing. I was just on my way to meet you.",
        "Damian: I was calling to let you know that I'll be a little delayed. I have some foundation work to catch up on.",
        "Meg: Oh. Um, well, do you still want me to wait?",
        "Damian: If you don't mind.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'll meet you in your room when you're done.",
        "Faith: What's wrong?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: That was, uh, Damian. He's gonna be late because he has to do some work at the foundation.",
        "Faith: Is that what he told you?",
        "Meg: What kind of question is that?",
        "Faith: Well, my mom told me she was doing foundation work today, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi, Rosanna. What can I do for you?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I just came by to see how you and the whole Snyder clan are holding up.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, you know, they're tough. They're gonna get through this.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they will.",
        "Janet: So, what can I get for you? The chef's got some great specials today. He's got a three-bean salad that'll knock your socks off.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I don't want to waste your time, so I'm just gonna cut to the chase, okay? Um, do you know what's going on between Craig and Teri?",
        "Janet: Besides business, nothing. I thought we went over this before.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, so did I.",
        "Janet: Rosanna, what do you know? Have you seen something?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: It's just that Craig lied to me. And I think that your sister is involved somehow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Well?",
        "Liberty: Well, I'm pregnant.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Liberty: We already knew that.",
        "[Teri sighs]",
        "Teri: Sorry, Liberty.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Teri: Do you have any idea what you want to do?",
        "Liberty: I want to wake up tomorrow and have this all just be a dream.",
        "Teri: Oh. I wish I could help you there, Sweetie.",
        "Liberty: The doctor went through all the options with me, and she told me to take my time to decide.",
        "Teri: That's good. That's really good advice. You know, the good thing is, you're not showing at all, so you have plenty of time to work with.",
        "Liberty: Right. Aunt Teri?",
        "Teri: Yeah?",
        "Liberty: I think that I already know what I want to do.",
        "Teri: Okay. Oh, okay.",
        "Liberty: I'm just so not ready to be a mom.",
        "Teri: Well, nobody says you have to keep it. You could always give it up for adoption.",
        "Liberty: I know, but I just -- watching Katie go through everything, I don't -- I don't think I could, like, carry a baby for nine months and then give it away. I just don't have it in me.",
        "Teri: It's a hell of a choice, whichever way you look at it.",
        "Liberty: I know.",
        "[Teri sighs]",
        "Liberty: If I have a -- if I have a baby, there goes college. I mean, there goes everything that I've ever planned on.",
        "Teri: Hey, you know, just so you know, there are girls that have babies, go to college, go on to do other things.",
        "Liberty: And then there's girls like my mom, who become waitresses and barely make it from week to week, and I can't do that. I can't. I don't want to be her age and look back and think I could have done this or I could have done that if I hadn't have a kid.",
        "Teri: This is a very big choice you're about to make.",
        "Liberty: I know. I know, but, please, I mean, you'll have to swear to me that you will not tell anyone about this, okay? Especially my mom, because it would -- it would kill her if she found out. I mean, this completely goes against everything that she believes in.",
        "Teri: At least you know that if you were to keep the baby, your mom would totally back you. She would never kick you out of the house like our parents did to her.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I'd still know how hurt and disappointed she would be in me. And she'd probably blame herself for my stupid mistakes. I can't do that to her, you know?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Liberty sighs]",

        "Craig: How's she doing?",
        "Teri: Oh, she's totally freaked out.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not surprised. It's a lot to handle for any girl Liberty's age.",

        "Teri: Oh, Sweetie, it's not like that.",
        "Liberty: I don't believe you! Who else did you tell? Did you tell Parker or Jack? 'Cause he's gonna tell my mom!",
        "Teri: No, I didn't tell anyone else, I swear!",
        "Liberty: I can't trust you now. I have to go.",
        "Craig: Wait, wait.",
        "Liberty: Please get out of my way, Craig!",
        "Craig: No, not until you hear me out. I want to help you, Liberty. And so does your aunt.",
        "[Liberty scoffs]",
        "Craig: She didn't want to tell me what was going on. I forced her to. I was worried that Parker might be the father.",
        "Liberty: Well, he's not, so you can just relax and just leave me alone, okay? Please, whatever you do, just don't tell my mom.",
        "Craig: I won't. You can trust me on that.",

        "Craig: I've been on your side and Parker's when no one else was. So you have to let me help you.",
        "Liberty: No one did this to me but me. I can handle it by myself.",

        "Teri: Okay, okay, then I will help you any way that I can. I'll make the appointment, take you there, take you home.",
        "Liberty: I just --we can't do it around here, because someone might find out. And I can't really face seeing my mom right after, you know?",
        "Craig: Okay, then we'll just have to find you a clinic somewhere else, maybe Chicago. I'll look into it.",

        "Janet: He can charm himself until he's blue in the face. She's not gonna fall for it.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I had an important business meeting with Craig this morning, and he cut it short so he could have a private, intimate conversation with your sister. Now, for all we know, they could be together right now, as we speak.",
        "Janet: They're not. They're not, okay? Liberty has been feeling under the weather, and so I asked Theresa to do me a favor and take her to the hospital this morning. So relax, okay? Don't go looking for trouble, especially where Craig is concerned.",

        "Lily: Yes! Must have much better things to do with your time.",
        "Damian: Very well. But you should go home, too. I -- I know it's hard to be there without Holden, but you're going to have to get used to it.",
        "Lily: There are just so many memories there.",
        "Damian: Well, running back to the office isn't going to help either. It's too soon for you to be back at work. But when you're ready, I'll be right here.",

        "Damian: Meg, it wasn't a secret. I was gonna mention it to you when I got here.",
        "Meg: Oh, and here you are. And yet I was the one to bring it up. Why is that?",

        "Meg: Oh! So it's my fault?",
        "Damian: You want to know what happened between me and Lily? I'll tell you what happened! She called me because she needed some help figuring out what had happened at the foundation in her absence! But when I got there, she fell apart!

        "Faith: He called Meg while I was at the farm. Put off her date with her to meet up with you.",
        "Lily: Uh, we had a lot to sort through. Luke and I had started talking about setting up a scholarship. And it's getting so close to the school year, we wanted to get that under way.",
        "Faith: Are you guys naming the scholarship after anybody?",
        "Lily: No, we hadn't discussed that yet. Why? Do you think we should name it after your father?",

        "Lily: Oh, Faith, I think that's a wonderful idea.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eb: He knows where the money is, all right. He just figured out you're sweet on him. He's trying to get around you.",
        "Maeve: No, Eb, you're wrong! All he wants to do is to get back to his wife and kids!",
        "Eb: What wife, what kids? For all you know, he's in there laughing about how he's playing you right now!",
        "Maeve: How do we know he's not telling the truth -- Skaggs did hijack him and they never knew each other before?",
        "Eb: So, what you're saying is, you're siding with that stranger, not me.",

        "Janet: Hey! You were supposed to call me when you were finished at the hospital.",
        "Teri: It was just a bug, like you thought, so we thought we'd come by and give you the good news in person.",
        "Janet: Good.",

        "Rosanna: I don't know. Depends on what it is.",
        "Teri: Is it okay with you if I take a day or two off to go to Chicago? Parker and Sage are gonna be getting ready for school, so they won't even notice that I'm gone. And don't worry, I'll keep the fridge completely stocked, so --",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Who are you going to Chicago with?",
        "Liberty: Uh, that would be me.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, yeah, I've been thinking about it for a while now, Mom. I want to go check out Loyola and Northwestern, and Aunt Teri said she'd take me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, then its fine with me. Take a few days off, Teri, and I'll see you later.",
        "Teri: Thank you so much. I'm gonna stop by the house and pick up an overnight bag. I'll see you later.",

        "Rosanna: Well, isn't that interesting.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: I just ran into Teri, and she asked me for a couple days off so she could go to Chicago with Liberty. Coincidence?",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: What else would it be?",

        "Meg: Of course. I'm not saying you shouldn't be there for Lily. But I want you to be there for me, too.",
        "Damian: If I haven't been, I'm sorry. You're the most important woman in my life -- the only one I want to be with.",
        "Meg: If you're trying to make me feel ashamed of myself, it's working.",
        "Damian: I don't want you to feel ashamed of anything, least of all how you feel. You have to believe me when I say you have nothing to be jealous about. Nothing.",

        "Faith: I just don't want you, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay. I promise, I will keep my distance. But baby, we've got to be honest with each other. We've got to tell each other what we're feeling!",
        "Faith: My dad just died! How do you expect me to feel?!",
        "Lily: I know, I know, Sweetie. And I know these are emotions that you're not gonna know how to handle.",

        "Liberty: Yeah, she's looking at a lot of the same schools as I am, and so we just thought that it would make sense for us to look at them together. Um, please, M Mom? Come on, it really has to be now.",

        "Rosanna: I know you lied to me, okay? I know you lied to me. I talked to Parker! He told me there was no photo shoot!",
        "Craig: And from that, you leap to the conclusion that I'm having a tryst with our employee?",

        "Craig: Despite the fact -- and, oh, you have no idea how much it pains me to admit this -- that she's young enough to be my daughter.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, please. You slept with Jennifer when she was about the same age, as I recall.",
        "Craig: That was one drunken night. And you're leaving out the fact that I happen to be very much in love with your sister.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, well, you were very much in love with me once, and look how well that turned out.",
        "Craig: Nothing has happened between me and Teri, and nothing is going to. Now, why don't you just give me the benefit of the doubt?",
