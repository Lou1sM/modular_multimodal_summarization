        "Bryant: Yeah, right. \r\n",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no more getting up at dawn to get Will off to school. No \r\nmore housework, no more schoolwork, no more yelling parents. Oh, I am \r\nfinally free! What's wrong?

        "Sierra: I came to say good-bye. I'm headed back to Montega. I really \r\nthought that maybe I'd hear from you after the trial. \r\n",
        "Craig: No, I was going to call you. I just -- the way you supported me in \r\nthe trial with my back against the wall -- and now, I'm a free man. \r\n",

        "Emily: Thanks. Thanks. They want me to reprint all my articles on the \r\nMontgomery trial. And get this -- they may want me to do an in-depth series \r\non how we found the real culprit. I mean, can you believe this? I know I'm \r\nEditor-in-Chief and all, but that doesn't mean I can't play reporter every now\r\n\r\nand then, right? And I've already figured out the angle.

        "Hal: I'll pass, Emily. Getting my old job back is good enough for me. \r\nBesides, I've read about how these things work. Next thing you know, they'll \r\nwant to make a miniseries of the whole story, and then they'll start fighting\r\n\r\nover who's sexy enough to play me. \r\n",
        "Emily: Good. All right, well, so who do you see to play me? I was thinking\r\n\r\nSharon stone or, I don't know, Gwyneth if she can toughen up a bit, but I don't\r\n\r\nknow. Who do you see? \r\n",
