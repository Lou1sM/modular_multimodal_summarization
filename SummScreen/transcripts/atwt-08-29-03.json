        "While searching for tools that she and Mike could use to escape, Katie found an old Fraser photo album, and lamented not knowing about Simon's life before their marriage. She figured that Simon had forgotten about her, but Mike insisted that was impossible. Mike patched into Mordecai's phone line, and he and Katie heard Simon warn Mordecai to stay away from Katie. Walker, Bonnie, and Molly arrived at the salon. Walker told Bonnie he had been offered a job in Oakdale, then reassured her she had done a good thing by giving Sarah a father. Molly cried to Lily about missing her family, and Lily convinced her she needed a night out with Carly. Paul heard Jen warn Connie to leave Dusty to her. Jen tried to pretend that she had been referring to him, but he didn't buy it. She promised to stay away from Dusty if Paul participated in the charity auction, but, when he agreed, she secretly plotted with Connie to get the penthouse to herself for the night. After Craig's anonymous tip to the police, he and Dusty were arrested for illegal gambling. Dusty mistakenly thought Jen was the whistle-blower. Rosanna was heartbroken when Craig's arrest forced the adoption agency to rescind their offer for an interview. Alison revealed her jealousy about Chris's participation in the auction to Aaron. Aaron offered to lend her the money to bid on Chris herself, if she promised to help make sure only someone \"safe\" bid on him."

        "Katie: Okay, so you just have to connect this thingamjig to this thing up here, and if all goes well, we'll be able to hear Mordecai's conversations?",
        "Mike: Yup.",
        "Katie: Okay. What if no one calls?",
        "Mike: We'll have to wait 'til Mordecai calls up a \"mate,\" or whatever they call them in Australia.",
        "Katie: Oh yeah, I'm sure he has tons of those. What if no one ever calls, and we get stuck in this pit forever?",
        "Mike: Doing a great job of cheering me up.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Mike. I'm just trying to be realistic. Nobody knows we're here. What if Mordecai gets sick of this whole entire thing and takes off? Then what? It's gonna be you and me and a bunch of sheep, stuck here.",
        "Mike: Katie, find something else to do besides drive me crazy.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'll explore. Oh you know, I've been wondering what the heck these things are, ever since we got here. I'm going to take one down and see what it is.",
        "Mike: You do, and it might snap your finger off.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: It's a trap, probably for badger or something.",
        "Katie: All right, well, I'm definitely through with the traps.",
        "Alison: My problem is, is that I thought that meant he loved me.",
        "Aaron: How do you know that he doesn't?",
        "Alison: Because tonight, he's going to line up with a bunch of \"hi \" and let women bid on who gets to take him home.",
        "Aaron: Oh, man. Chris Hughes is gonna be one of the bachelors that they're auctioning off?",
        "Alison: Did you hear about that?",
        "Aaron: Yes, you're talking to one of the \"himbos\" here.",
        "Alison: Ouch, I'm sorry. Lucy's okay with that?",
        "Aaron: It's her idea.",
        "Alison: Wow. But she's -- she's safe. You guys have been really solid together. But me and Chris are just starting out, and now he has to go and ruin everything.",

        "Lily: Could you just move it down a little bit? Keep going. A little bit more. Thank you. That's absolutely perfect. I think.",
        "Walker: Lily, right?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes -- no, that's Rose. I'm Lily. Hi.",
        "Walker: Do I give this to you?",
        "Lily: Oh, I guess. Oh! Dr. Daniels, one of my bodacious bachelors.",
        "Walker: Yeah, bodacious. Anyhow, listen, I tried to fill out the form there.",
        "Lily: Well, thank you.",
        "Walker: Some of those questions are a little personal.",
        "Lily: Oh, well, I mean, us women, we wanna know what we're getting. Have you ever seen us at the produce section in the supermarket?",
        "Walker: Then I guess I should be grateful that I'm not a cantaloupe.",
        "Lily: Yes, well, with this bunch. Yes, that's for sure. Oh, no, no, not there. Not there in the back. 'Scuse me. I'll -- excuse me.",
        "Walker: The formerly dignified Walker Daniels -- going once, going twice, sold. Ow -- hey. Hey, Bonnie. What are you doing here?",
        "Bonnie: I'm here to break some bad news to Lily. Isaac's not going to be part of the auction tonight.",
        "Walker: Oh, is he okay?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, he's fine. Just some personal stuff. You know, I was going to bid on him tonight, but -- long story.",
        "Walker: Well, you know, I'm -- I'm sure it'll work out. It'll be okay. You know, in the meantime, do you -- can you do me a favor? I mean, I need something that only you can give.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Connie: All I'm asking is, why do you want me to stay away from Dusty Donovan?",
        "Jennifer: He's trouble.",
        "Connie: He's hot.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, look, I can't get into the details about this, but Donovan is a jerk. He did something extremely lousy to my brother, and now it's payback time. So I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the man to me, okay?",
        "Paul: \"Leave the man to me\"? Hi. Something you want to tell me, Jennifer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm certainly glad you have the right perspective on my husband's indiscretions --",
        "Ingrid: Illegal activities.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, of course. And we take them seriously. But they were the products of a headstrong youth.",
        "Ingrid: Well, that's how we're going to treat it. And, as I said before, since your husband's record is clean now, there shouldn't be a problem working around his past.",
        "Rosanna: Lovely.",
        "Ingrid: But I do need to get the interview under way soon.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, of course. I mean, I'm sure that he's gonna be here any minute. He's anxious as I am to adopt.",
        "Ingrid: Well, people who are anxious to adopt tend to be on time.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, of course. Well, don't worry, he'll be here. Craig wouldn't let anything keep him away.",

        "[With southern accent]",
        "Craig: Hello, officer? I'd like to report gambling in a local bar, and I'd like to know when you're gonna take care of it? Well, I think you ought to worry less about my name and stop this thing before it gets out of hand.",
        "Dusty: Craig? Craig?",
        "Craig: Huh? What?",
        "Dusty: The meeting with the adoption agency? Aren't you gonna be late?",
        "Craig: I have time. I just wanna make sure that you and our contractors here are on schedule. We need to open this place as soon as possible, you know?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, everything's under control. You're going to be late. Go on.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. I'm gonna take another look at these plans. Make sure we have the --",
        "Jack: Hey, everybody stop what you're doing right now, please.",
        "Craig: About time.",
        "Dusty: What's this, a raid? You got a warrant?",
        "Jack: Right here. Guys, take this place apart. We're looking for any evidence involving an illegal betting operation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know, Craig is in the middle of this renovation of a new business that he is opening, and he is just swamped. But even though this appointment came up at the last minute, he didn't bat an eye. He said he would be here just as soon as he could. I mean, that is one of his best traits you know? That ability to roll with the punches -- and a very important one in a parent. Don't you think?",
        "Ingrid: I'm not sure how much longer I can wait, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Rosanna: Well, perhaps I could prevail upon you to wait just a few more minutes? Because he knows how important this is. I'm sure he's breaking land speed records to get here.",
        "Ingrid: All right, I'll give him a few more minutes, but that's it. As it is, I'd better call my office and let them know I'm running late. I'll be right back.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Well damn it, Craig! Better have a damn good excuse, or I'm gonna kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You got no right --",
        "Jack: Read that again, Dusty. That says I got every right in the world. [Phone rings] Craig, don't even think about answering that.",
        "Craig: I have to meet Rosanna --",
        "Jack: Shut it off!",
        "Craig: Whatever you say.",
        "Dusty: Did you know that according to this warrant, they know exactly what they're looking for? Somebody gave us up.",
        "Craig: Who would do that?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. I can't wait to find out. You know what? This warrant is a joke! As soon as my lawyer sees this, you and your department, you're gonna be looking at charges on illegal entry and harassment, otherwise known as --",
        "Cop #1: Found something, detective.",
        "Jack: Hold that thought, would you? What have we got here, boys? Didn't your mothers ever tell you it's illegal to make book?",
        "Dusty: I never even saw that bag. I've never seen this money or those -- whatever those are.",
        "Jack: They're betting slips, Dusty. Betting slips. But I'm sure you already knew that, right?",
        "Dusty: Whatever they are, I've never seen it before.",
        "Craig: I'm shocked!",
        "Jack: Cuff 'em, boys.",
        "Craig: Jack, I have to meet Rosanna. We have an important meeting.",
        "Jack: I'm getting you in hot water with your wife, I'm sorry about that. I know. Sometimes, I really do love my job, Craig. I'm gonna read you your rights, so listen up, although I know you probably know them by heart. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can, and will be used against you in a court of law. Well, knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, do you wish to answer my questions before consulting an attorney?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Damn you, Jennifer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You know, I was hoping you'd get home soon. I want you to meet my friend, Connie Larsen. Connie, this is my brother Paul.",
        "Paul: Hi, Connie. Nice to meet you.",
        "Connie: Let me tell you a little secret. The more you meet of me, the nicer it gets.",
        "Paul: Oh, so glad to hear that. Jennifer, you didn't answer my question. When I came in here, you were telling your lovely new best friend to \"leave the man to me.\" What man?",
        "Jennifer: You. Connie is notorious for devastating men. And -- and you've been through a lot lately, and I was just trying to tell her that you're not in the market for a relationship.",
        "Connie: Who said anything about a relationship?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I know you can take care of yourself. But you have been through a lot, and -- and I was trying to point Connie into another direction.",
        "Connie: All right, Jen. He is gorgeous, but I'll back off.",
        "Paul: Thank you. You know, about backing off? That might be a great idea for about now, if you don't mind.",
        "Connie: Sure.",
        "Paul: Jen, I would -- I would really hate to think that you're not being honest with me.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then don't.",
        "Paul: Well, how about this. How about you swear to me that you weren't talking about Connie and Dusty?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, please. Even she can see what a loser he is.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and some women, though, for whatever reason, really find that interesting; are you one of those women, Jennifer? Okay, I have been very clear with you. You are to stay away from Rose, and you are to stay away from Dusty.",
        "Jennifer: And I have been very clear to you, that you and mom both are not to get within fifty feet of my love life --",
        "Paul: Okay, now. Don't you dare compare me to Barbara --",
        "Jennifer: Okay, listen, I'm not even thinking about Dusty and Rose. I've got Connie the man-eating model visiting, and I'm trying to keep the studs of Oakdale safe. So that is my only agenda, okay? So, I swear.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Mitzi: Yoo-hoo. Anybody home?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, greetings.",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, greetings. Speaking of which, Lily sends hers.",
        "Jennifer: Come right on in.",
        "Mitzi: Oh, you said you needed an extra invitation to the benefit tonight?",
        "Jennifer: Right. Right, for my friend Connie. Connie! Hey, this is my friend Mitzi. Mitzi, Connie. She's a friend from modeling.",
        "Mitzi: Oh, a model. What a surprise. It's a real shame about your looks.",
        "Paul: So, Mitzi, you said something about Lily?",
        "Mitzi: Yes. She wants me to try to get you to reconsider participating in the auction tonight, okay? She thinks that you could raise a lot of money for a really great cause. And all you have to do is have dinner with the lucky winner.",
        "Paul: Tell Lily that I'm very flattered, but not this year",
        "Mitzi: Oh, you sure? 'Cause, you know, it would really mean a lot to Lily if you'd help her out.",
        "Paul: Yeah, yeah. No, I'm sure.",
        "Mitzi: Okay.",
        "Paul: Maybe next time, though. Here, thanks.",
        "Mitzi: No problem.",
        "Paul: Yeah, good to see you.",
        "Mitzi: Bye.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Jennifer: I'll make you a deal.",
        "Paul: Okay. What kind of a deal?",
        "Connie: Yeah, what kind of a deal? This is getting interesting.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, Connie, do you mind?",
        "Connie: You two have a real thing for privacy, don't you?",
        "Paul: What are your terms?",
        "Jennifer: You want me to stay away from Dusty Donovan? I will, if you change your mind about coming to the auction tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I used to feel like I knew so much about Simon, that -- obviously, he had a whole entire life before me.",
        "Mike: You had a whole life before you met him, too.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but I told him about mine. I told Simon everything that ever happened to me. If he saw a book like this of mine, he'd be able to figure out who was who. It would feel familiar.",
        "Mike: He's a guy, Katie. Guys don't hold on to stuff the way that girls do. They just -- they don't. They don't hold on to ticket stubs and bunches of flowers. They just move on. Did I say something wrong?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Mike: Katie, look, this phone tap system's gonna work. We'll figure out what Mordecai's planning, we will find Simon, and we'll get out of here.",
        "Katie: What does it matter anyway?",
        "Mike: You can't think like that.",
        "Katie: If you and I die in this place, miles away from anyone who loves us -- some stranger buys the cottage, and sells all of my wedding presents at a yard sale and tosses out every picture that ever existed of me and Simon -- if our lives together are completely erased, what does it matter? He's moved on. I'm sure he's forgotten I even existed.",
        "Mike: Now you're just talking crazy.",
        "Katie: That's what you said. That's what guys do.",
        "Mike: I said that guys don't hold onto souvenirs. I didn't say that guys don't hold on to things that are important to them. Simon is never gonna forget about you.",
        "Katie: How do you know that? He forgot about his entire childhood, and that was a whole lot longer than our marriage.",
        "Mike: You know what? I don't care if your marriage lasted 45 seconds. No man in the world would ever forget about a woman as beautiful as you.",

        "Walker: Now that the serial killer case is closed, they asked me to stay on at Memorial. Purely as a doctor, not an investigator.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, that's great! That's fantastic.",
        "Walker: Thank you.",
        "Bonnie: But how can I help?",
        "Walker: The DNA test that I ran for you -- if it should get out that I did it without Marshall's knowledge, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble, and I certainly won't be able to accept the job.",
        "Bonnie: Then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. Only you and I know that you ran those tests for me, and I certainly won't be discussing Marshall being Sarah's father ever again.",
        "Walker: You okay?",
        "Bonnie: No.",
        "Walker: I'm sorry.",
        "Bonnie: Don't be. It's my fault. It is. If I hadn't pushed -- if I had just let it alone, if -- if I didn't have to find out about Marshall, and -- Sarah would still be in the dark. And he wouldn't have a place in her life. And I wouldn't be completely shut out of it.",
        "Walker: You know, Bonnie, I know you may not be able to see this right now, because it hurts too much. But -- you did the right thing. I mean, you put Sarah's only living parent in her life. I mean, you were a pivotal function. You have to let her go.",
        "Bonnie: But how do I do that? I love that little girl.",

        "Molly: Hey, Lily.",
        "Lily: Hi!",
        "Molly: A check for you.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you so -- oh, wow! Thank you so much. You're gonna be here, right? I mean, you could get, like, a truckload of bachelors for this amount of money.",
        "Molly: I'm not so desperate that I have to buy my dates.",
        "Lily: No, no, of course not. But Nancy Hughes rsvp'd. So don't you wanna stick around to see who she bids on? You okay?",
        "Molly: Um -- no.",

        "Aaron: Wait, wait, wait -- back up. Back up. I don't understand why you think things have changed between you and Chris.",
        "Alison: Because he was asked to be a stupid bachelor at a stupid charity auction, and he stupidly said yes.",
        "Aaron: Well, aren't you forgetting something? You know, the part where you told him that it bothers you?",
        "Alison: But Aaron, he'll think I'm a baby if I say that I'm not cool about it. So I was cool, and I said that I didn't care.",
        "Aaron: Well, Alison, then you can't blame him for doing it.",
        "Alison: Yes, I can! Aaron, all the women over there, they're going to be older than me, right? I mean, think about it. And one of them will get him, and then they'll go out. And they'll have something in common that he doesn't have with someone my age --",
        "Aaron: So what?",
        "Alison: She'll have experiences, Aaron. Experiences that I haven't really had yet.",
        "Aaron: This is a charity auction, Alison. It's not -- they're not auctioning off people for sex slaves.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but -- c'mon, things can happen.",
        "Aaron: \"Things can happen.\" You think Lucy would let me do this if she knew there was more than dinner involved? Come on.",
        "Alison: Well, duh -- she can just bid on you herself. She has nothing to worry about. And if someone bids against her, then she can just keep bidding higher until she gets you.",
        "Aaron: Alison, you know what they say. \"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" Go to the auction and bid on him yourself.",

        "Jennifer: No, you are not. All you do is stress about me and Will.",
        "Paul: Well, with good reason. Will is living with that monster, Barbara, and you -- for whatever reason -- are hell-bent on hanging out with all the wrong people.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, gosh. Please -- I'm not even thinking about Dusty or Rose. And the only reason I do sometimes is because they hurt you so badly. You haven't even recovered.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, you do not need to worry about my recovery.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I can't help it. I love you. You know, and I wanna see you happy, and involved in the world again. All you do is face off with mom, and fester about Dusty. You have to stop obsessing.",
        "Paul: I have.",
        "Jennifer: Prove it. Meet me at the auction tonight. Get up on that block, be silly, have fun. Remember having fun? Show me that you're moving on.",
        "Paul: And if I go to this auction, you'll stay away from Dusty?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty who?",
        "Paul: Okay, fine, I'll do it.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, that's great, Paul. You are gonna have a wonderful time tonight.",

        "Marshall: Just spoke with Tom Hughes. We should be able to get a plea deal.",
        "Dusty: What's that mean?",
        "Marshall: It means no jail time, but hell when it comes time to get a liquor license.",
        "Dusty: How am I gonna run a bar without booze?",
        "Craig: We'll think of something.",
        "Jack: I bet you will, Craig. Hey, what kind of odds would I get with that?",
        "[Sarcastic chuckling]",
        "Marshall: This is not the small problem you may think it is. You may lose your club before it even opens.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that's what Paul and his sister, Jennifer are hoping for.",
        "Marshall: Come again?",
        "Dusty: Paul and Jennifer, they set this whole thing up.",
        "Craig: You have proof?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I do. I'll fill you in on the way back to the club.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Fill Marshall in. I told Rosanna I'd meet her here.",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "Craig: Something amusing?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's just -- I've never seen someone get in so much trouble, in so many different ways. It's incredible.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm happy for you, Jack. But maybe I'll make my call somewhere else.",
        "Jack: No, stay put. I gotta get your paperwork anyway.",
        "Craig: Hi, bub.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Craig. How could you?",

        "Alison: I would love to go to the auction and bid on Chris. I've thought about it like a zillion times, but I only have $187.26.",
        "Aaron: That's good money.",
        "Alison: Yeah, for us. But you know the women there, they probably spend that much on their lattes monthly.",
        "Aaron: Look, I got $300 you can borrow. If you want it, it's yours.",
        "Alison: I've made huge mistakes with you and Lucy in the past. Why would you want to do something to help me out like that?",
        "Aaron: Alison, I've always liked hanging out with you. And since you're not acting like a jerk any more, then, you know, I guess, we're good friends again.",
        "Alison: Thank you. Thank you, that's really cool of you, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: I am. You wanna borrow the money?",
        "Alison: Yes. You bet I do. And I'm going to win Chris Hughes at the auction, and if it takes me ten years to pay you back, I'll do it. But thank you. I'd gotta get going. But, thank you so much --",

        "Molly: No, no, it's not that, Lily. I really just -- I don't know. Nothing is really clear to me. Nothing's making sense. And then -- and then I keep crying for absolutely no reason.",
        "Lily: There has to be a reason. Maybe -- maybe you should talk about it.",
        "Molly: Okay. Well, the only thing that's absolutely clear to me is that I am incredibly alone. I just seems like everybody around me is, you know, moving on. They're building their families, they're having babies. They're taping finger-paintings to the walls. And I just -- you know, what do I do? I come home to this very expensive, very nicely-furnished, very beautiful, very empty hotel room every night. The thing that just kills me is that I had it. You know? I mean, I had it. I had it, finally. I had the guy that absolutely loved me more than -- I had the finger-paintings on the walls. I had it all. It was taken away in one second with one bullet. And it isn't fair!",
        "Lily: No, it's not.",
        "Molly: I don't think anything's ever gonna be the same again. Because I'm different. Jake's death completely changed who I am. I know I walk around laughing and joking all the time, but inside there's -- there's this person that can't stop crying. I'm sorry!",
        "Lily: It's okay. She's trying to get out now, that's for sure.",
        "Molly: I know. Even when I don't want her to.",
        "Lily: Oh. I know -- I know that we got off on the wrong foot when you came to Oakdale. But I also know that you've changed. You have. You've changed incredibly. You've gone through so much. But that's what you need. You need that person who knows you so well, who's seen you through all those difficult times. That's the person that you need to talk to, Molly.",
        "Molly: Well, I guess Carly's known me just about longer than anybody --",
        "Lily: Carly, yes. You need to call her.",
        "Molly: You think?",
        "Lily: Yes. Look at you -- absolutely! You call her. You come to this event and you whistle at cute guys and have a few drinks and have some fun. Smile.",
        "Molly: Sounds like fun.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Molly: Sounds like it could be like old times. You know what? I think a night on the town with my best friend is exactly what I could use right now. Thank you.",
        "Lily: You're welcome. Any time.",

        "Bonnie: She trusted me. She would tell me anything. And ask me for advice. And I would give it to her, because I loved giving it to her. Because I loved her. So, how can I just drop out of her life, now?",
        "Walker: You can't.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, but you just said that --",
        "Walker: I know, I know. I know what I said, Bonnie. But I didn't realize you had such deep feelings for her. I'm sorry.",
        "Bonnie: And she cares about me, too.",
        "Walker: Then you can't give up on her, okay? See, there's some times we meet someone and there's this connection. It's a -- it's like a tug. It's older and stronger than anything else around us. And we have to listen to those feelings inside of ourselves.",
        "Bonnie: You're the first person to really understand.",
        "Walker: You and Sarah, you'll find your way back to each other. All right? And you'll both be happy you did.",

        "Rosanna: We had an appointment to adopt a child and instead you got yourself arrested.",
        "Craig: Did I know there were illegal betting slips in the bar? Huh? Here, call Dusty, he'll tell you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?",
        "Craig: Who are you?",
        "Rosanna: Ms. Brice. What are you doing here? Did you follow me?",
        "Ingrid: Forgive me, but something about your corporate emergency didn't ring true.",

        "Ingrid: I'm Ingrid Brice, from the adoption agency. I'm sorry, but I believe this effectively rules out the possibility of another interview.",

        "Aaron: Angry, lonely, desperate women.",
        "Alison: Oh, please. You'll be able to handle it yourself. Come on, Aaron, think about it. You'll go on a date with a lonely, angry, desperate woman, and she'll play footsies with you under the dinner table.",
        "Aaron: Don't laugh. Don't laugh. Look, Lucy and I have something good, for once, okay? Everything is working out. I wanna keep it that way.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, then I'll make sure you wind up with a nice, safe woman. And $300 aside, I owe you this one.",

        "Dusty: I'm telling you, you know what? Jennifer knew about the betting slips.",
        "Marshall: And I'm telling you, you can't prove it. Look, Jennifer Munson may have seen the bag, but unless she admits to it, how are you going to show a connection to her and her brother?",
        "Dusty: She's got obvious motive. Her brother hates me. She's out there trying to settle the score for him.",
        "Marshall: Maybe. But it's your word against theirs. A judge is gonna call that speculation.",

        "Craig: No --",
        "Rosanna: No, if you cared at all, none of this would have happened. You would have showed up. You would have shook hands, you would've made nice, and not added \"bookmaker\" to your already illustrious resume. And I would've gotten the chance to be somebody's mommy.",
        "Craig: You know I love you. This will all work out.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I think to love somebody, you have to be able to look at them and see something that you respect. I can't -- I can't look at you right now.",
