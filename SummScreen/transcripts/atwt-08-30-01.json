        "Molly: You're saying that Mary is responsible for the mug shot on the \r\nInternet, on this T-shirt and on that phony wedding invitation? \r\n",
        "Jake: Yes, yes, yes. \r\n",
        "Molly: Oh, get a grip. This is nothing to joke about. \r\n",
        "Jake: I wasn't laughing when Nick Scudder found out who was responsible \r\nfor this. \r\n",
        "Molly: See, you can't believe what Nick Scudder says. \r\n",
        "Jake: Listen, I went to Hadley's. I went to check it out myself. Nick made a\r\n\r\ncouple phone calls to find out who was responsible for the invitations. And \r\nMary's signature is at the bottom of the receipt. \r\n",
        "Molly: Is there any way that Nick could have planted this or something? \r\n",
        "Jake: This was stapled to the original order form. \r\n",
        "Molly: How did Nick even get an invitation in the first place? \r\n",
        "Jake: He said that after you showed it to him, you threw it in the garbage\r\n\r\nand that's how he found it. \r\n",
        "Molly: Why would he bother? \r\n",
        "Jake: I don't know, maybe he wanted -- maybe he wanted to save his job. \r\n",
        "Molly: I don't believe this. I love Mary, Mary loves the kids. The kids love\r\n\r\nMary. I trusted her with my life, Jake. Why would she do this to us? \r\n",
        "Jake: I just think we should have checked her references. \r\n",
        "Molly: But we did. You saw the list that the agency sent over, they were \r\ngreat. \r\n",
        "Jake: Those could have been her friends. \r\n",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. The kids are with Mary, Jake. The kids are with a \r\nstalker!",

        "Paul: Wow. Rose, you -- you look great. \r\n",
        "Rose: Oh, thank you. \r\n",
        "Paul: Would you like a drink? We have a few minutes before they seat us \r\nin the dining room. \r\n",
        "Rose: You know what? I'm going to skip that drink until we discuss a little\r\n\r\nbusiness. \r\n",
        "Paul: Business? \r\n",
        "Rose: Mm-hmm. \r\n",
        "Paul: No, Rose, this is supposed to be your Thank You/Birthday dinner. \r\n",
        "Rose: Oh, I know, I know. I hope it doesn't set you back too much, \r\nbecause once you hear what I have to say, you're gonna owe me another one. \r\n",
        "Paul: Hasn't Lucinda taught you anything? You always wait till after the \r\nentree to talk business, even at a business dinner. \r\n",
        "Rose: Really? Lucinda says dessert. You know? Something sweet, makes \r\nthe bitter pill easier to swallow. \r\n",
        "Paul: Well, she should know. \r\n",
        "Rose: Yes. \r\n",
        "Paul: All right. So what deals have you been masterminding since I saw \r\nyou yesterday? \r\n",
        "Rose: I had a very long talk -- very long talk with Craig Montgomery, \r\ndropping the suit against you and your mom. He is. Mm-hmm. \r\n",
        "Paul: Are you serious? \r\n",
        "Rose: You're serious enough for both of us. Is this how you react when get\r\n\r\ngood news? \r\n",
        "Paul: No, Rose, I'm sorry. It's just hard to believe. When he came over to\r\n\r\nthe house, he was so cocky when he was terrorizing my -- how do you do it? \r\n",
        "Rose: Well, I just reminded him of some family obligations that he'd \r\nforgotten about. And I had something sweet up my sleeve -- for dessert. \r\n",
        "Paul: I bet you did. \r\n",
        "Rose: Uh-huh. \r\n",
        "Paul: Rose -- you continue to amaze me. \r\n",
        "Rose: Oh. Well, while you're sitting there still amazed, I need you to \r\nremember what we talked about. I need your guarantee, Paul. You gotta stop \r\nCraig from using and abusing those Worldwide stock. And you gotta protect \r\nLucinda before she loses her company. ",

        "Craig: I'm not here to upset you, Carly. \r\n",
        "Carly: Oh, you've come to help me pack? How sweet. \r\n",
        "Craig: How about I help you unpack? \r\n",
        "Carly: I knew it. I knew it! I should not have opened that door! \r\n",
        "Craig: I have no hidden agendas, Carly. There are no shocking \r\ndeclarations today. I'm just here to help. \r\n",
        "Carly: What? What are you saying? You know, my neighbor might have to \r\nturn up her hearing aid if you don't speak up, Craig. ",
        "[Carly yells out the door\r\n\r\nto her neighbor] Isn't that right, Darlene? You writing all this down, are you?\r\n\r\n",
        "Craig: Okay -- maybe I was a little insensitive the other day, you know, \r\nunder the circumstances. My timing with you hasn't always been perfect. \r\n",
        "Carly: Is this a lame excuse for an apology? Well, if it is, don't bother. As\r\n\r\na matter of fact, just forget that you came here and told me what you told me,\r\n\r\nbecause it means nothing to me -- it means less than nothing to me. \r\n",
        "Craig: If you say so. \r\n",
        "Carly: And yet here you are, wasting your time and mine. \r\n",
        "Craig: You're not leaving town like this, Carly. \r\n",
        "Carly: And how did you know that I was leaving town? \r\n",
        "Craig: I know everything about you. Haven't you figured that out yet? \r\n",
        "Carly: Is that supposed to be flattering? That some mind-reading control \r\nfreak is obsessed with me? \r\n",
        "Craig: So now I'm obsessed? \r\n",
        "Carly: Craig, good-bye. Don't forget to shut the door on your way out. \r\n",
        "Craig: Carly, Carly -- you are not leaving town. I am not going to let you.\r\n",
        "Craig: Carly, don't do this. It's a bad move. You will regret it. \r\n",
        "Carly: You are beginning to remind me of a certain dead ex-husband of \r\nmine. What is it with me? Why do I always seem to attract men who think \r\nthey know more than I do about what's best for me? \r\n",
        "Craig: Don't compare me with Winston Lowe. At least I am your friend. \r\n",
        "Carly: You're my friend? \r\n",
        "Craig: Yes, I'm your friend. \r\n",
        "Carly: You are completely deluded! \r\n",
        "Craig: I am your friend and you could engrave that on my tombstone. \r\n",
        "Carly: Well, this friendship, if that's what you want to call it, is not \r\ngonna \r\nlast that long. \r\n",
        "Craig: Hey, hey, hey! You need all the friends you can get, my friend. And\r\n\r\nafter the trial and that photo when Julia's psychosis -- you are on overload,\r\n\r\nwhich is not the best time to run away. \r\n",
        "Carly: This is the very best time. I happen to need a change of scenery, \r\neven if it's only Chicago. \r\n",
        "Craig: We take our problems with us, Carly. At least if you stay here, I can\r\n\r\nhelp you deal. \r\n",
        "Carly: Who, you? \r\n",
        "Craig: Yeah. \r\n",
        "Carly: Are you out of your mind? You are the reason I'm being driven \r\nfrom this town, Craig. I trusted you and I almost ended up in prison. You said\r\n\r\nthat you would respect my relationship with Jack and you didn't! You \r\ndestroyed it. And through all of that, I stood by you when no one else would. I\r\n\r\neven gave up the only opportunity I will ever have at financial security for you\r\n\r\nand your stupid butt! \r\n",
        "Craig: And I will never forget that generosity. \r\n",
        "Carly: That stupidity, you mean. \r\n",
        "Craig: So now you're gonna run away. I am not going to lose you, Carly. \r\n",
        "Carly: You already did -- that night of your wedding. \r\n",
        "Craig: One little kiss. \r\n",
        "Carly: It was the kiss of death. \r\n",
        "Craig: And I would die a thousand deaths for another kiss like that, Carly.\r\n\r\n",
        "Carly: Good-bye, Craig. And don't ever try to contact me again! \r\n",
        "Craig: Come on, Carly. I just want to do what's right here, okay? Tell me \r\nwhat to do and I will do it. Anything. ",
        "",
        "Rose: Thank you. Now, remember what you said that you'd marry -- marry \r\nLucinda if she made that lawsuit go away. \r\n",
        "Paul: Ooh, that's right. Lucinda. \r\n",
        "Rose: Uh-huh. \r\n",
        "Paul: I guess I better have my tux pressed, huh? \r\n",
        "Rose: Ah, hold that thought. I got a much better idea really. Lucinda's got\r\n\r\na big Worldwide board meeting coming up. And she's got two big problems. \r\nWhat Craig did to her at the last board meeting and what he's gonna do to her\r\n\r\nat this board meeting. \r\n",
        "Paul: Why, do you think the shareholders have lost confidence? \r\n",
        "Rose: Probably. It's not her fault. I mean, because of Craig she's seein' \r\nflying pigs in the box of chocolates. Now, he can do even worse to her. \r\n",
        "Paul: Yeah. Because now he owns enough worldwide stock that he could \r\nput her out of her CEO seat for good. \r\n",
        "Rose: That's right. And he doesn't need a box of chocolates to do that. \r\nLook, you and your mom, you gotta get that stock back. \r\n",
        "Paul: That could be a tall order, Rose. \r\n",
        "Rose: But he bought it with B.R.O. money without talkin' to your ma first,\r\n\r\nright? \r\n",
        "Paul: Yeah, but he still controls the shares. At this point, only an \r\narbitration can decide if he's entitled to them. \r\n",
        "Rose: Well, what are you waiting for? Come on, you got to do this. You \r\nhave to make sure that your mom gets that stock back. \r\n",
        "Paul: Well, she does have a case. Craig did sign the pre-nup. \r\n",
        "Rose: Oh, which entitles Mr. Wonderful to nothing, I hope? \r\n",
        "Paul: Yeah, nothing. Not a dime, which is exactly what he deserves. \r\n",
        "Rose: Touch\u00e9. So? Do we have a deal? \r\n",
        "Paul: Well, we'll see what we can do. We'll see if we can get those shares\r\n\r\nback, okay? Who knows, down the road, we may even sell them back to \r\nLucinda if she still wants them. \r\n",
        "Rose: It's really nice doing business with you, Paul Ryan. \r\n",
        "Paul: You know something, Rose? I was just thinking the same thing about \r\nyou. ",

        "Molly: What are you -- ? Jake, we have to call \r\nsomebody. Our kids are in the hands of an insane woman! ",
        "Jake: I don't think we need 911 just yet, all right? \r\n",
        "Molly: Because we have to -- \r\n",
        "Jake: Just give me a minute. Listen, Mary has never mistreated the kids. \r\n",
        "Molly: We don't know that -- \r\n",
        "Jake: Yes, we do. There would have been changes, behavioral changes. \r\nOur kids are happy and healthy. We don't want to change that by having cops \r\ncome in here and drag Mary out right in front of them. She doesn't know we're\r\n\r\non to her. Until the kids come back and they're safe, then we'll confront her\r\n\r\nbefore she has a chance to cover her tracks. \r\n",

        "Mary: Is there a problem? \r\n",
        "Molly: Yeah, as a matter of fact, there is a huge problem! We trusted you.\r\n\r\nOkay? But if you've laid a hand on these kids, I'll be the first one to rip your\r\n\r\nhead off your body! \r\n",

        "Sierra: Ah, I thought maybe you were studying architecture. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Would that make you happy, if I was studying something? \r\n",
        "Sierra: I don't know what'll make me happy these days so I'm going home \r\nto sort it out. \r\n",
        "Bryant: The trip certainly hasn't been fun for you. \r\n",
        "Sierra: It's had its silver linings. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Yeah, dad was plucked from the jaws of hell again. \r\n",
        "Sierra: I'm glad I spent some time with him. I'm even glad I spent time \r\nwith your grandmother. I only thought of matricide once or twice a day. \r\n",
        "Bryant: How'd you -- how did you do that? \r\n",
        "Sierra: I stopped speaking to her briefly. Made it a little bit easier. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Maybe I should try that sometime. \r\n",
        "Sierra: And I was glad to spend some much-needed time with you. I was \r\nvery proud of you that day in court. \r\n",
        "Bryant: I didn't go there for dad. \r\n",
        "Sierra: But you were man enough to apologize and to give him a hug. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Well, I'm glad that made you happy. Jen, on the other hand, was \r\nnot exactly elated. \r\n",
        "Sierra: What's going on? \r\n",
        "Bryant: I just thought once we moved in together and got away from \r\neverything that was weird and difficult that she'd relax and we could -- get \r\ncloser. \r\n",
        "Sierra: Should I ask what you mean by \"closer\"? Or should I just assume \r\nthat you're not talking about the emotional part of your relationship? \r\n",
        "Bryant: I think you get the picture. It's been over a year, mom, and I've \r\nbeen very patient with her. Been patient because I love her. But I thought once\r\n\r\nshe said yes to living together -- \r\n",
        "Sierra: Maybe she's just afraid. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Mom, I've done everything I can to make her feel comfortable. \r\n",
        "Sierra: You know, Bryant, I don't know Jennifer all that well. I mean, I like\r\n\r\nher. I think she's a bright and beautiful girl. But she's very young. Just out \r\nof \r\nhigh school, right? I mean, if she's putting distance between you two, there's\r\n\r\nprobably nothing you can do about it. \r\n",
        "Bryant: Please don't say that, mom. \r\n",

        "Emily: All right, so she can e-mail the column. She does know how to \r\ntype, doesn't she? \r\n",
        "Craig: No, Carly's place is here in Oakdale with her son. \r\n",
        "Emily: She's not taking Parker with her? \r\n",
        "Craig: No! The little tornado's staying here with Hal till she gets settled.\r\n\r\n",
        "Emily: Hal adores his son. It would kill him if she takes him to Chicago. \r\n",
        "Craig: Of course, you could tell Hal that you were doing this for him, that\r\n\r\nyou were giving Carly this opportunity so that she and Parker could stay in \r\nOakdale to be closer to papa. \r\n",
        "Emily: No. No, I'm not gonna lie to Hal! You know what? This is crazy! \r\nMaybe it's better for everybody if Carly just moves away to Chicago. I mean, \r\nespecially for Parker. He won't have to grow up in a town where everybody \r\nhates his mom. \r\n",
        "Craig: People forget. \r\n",
        "Emily: Not the people I know. \r\n",

        "Emily: Maybe Hal would appreciate not having to run back and forth to \r\nChicago to see his son. \r\n",
        "Craig: Uh? \r\n",
        "Emily: All right. All right. I will ask Hal to approach Carly with my job \r\noffer, and you can crawl back to the woodwork where you belong. \r\n",
        "Craig: I knew you'd make the right decision, Emily. \r\n",
        "[Emily sighs] \r\n",
        "Emily: One thing is becoming very clear, Craig -- you may not want to \r\nlook involved with Carly Tenney, but you are very, very involved, aren't you?\r\n\r\n",
