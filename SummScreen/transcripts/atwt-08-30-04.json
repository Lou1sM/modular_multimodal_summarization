        "Emily: Are you kidding me? That's enough food for an entire army.",
        "Chris: That's what your mother said. She thought you could use it to feed your family.",
        "Emily: Oh, family? That's funny. What family? Parker's with Carly, Daniel's at a friend's, Nikki and Hal are dealing with Barbara's arraignment, and nothing else in the world seems to exist, including me, until that's been taken care of.",
        "Chris: Well, at least you're not feeling sorry for yourself.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: All I'm saying is that that's a lot of food for one person, unless I can convince a friend to stay and join me.",
        "Chris: A \"friend\"?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Chris: How long do you think that we could keep this up?",
        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: Pretending that we're just friends, pretending that we can control this, whatever this is. Because I don't know how long I can hack it, how long I can control how I feel or how I act when I'm alone with you. I'm not sure that I want to.",

        "Barbara: Well, I see I haven't swayed you. You've already made up your minds about me. So you leave me no choice. And as much as I hate to deprive you of the opportunity of kicking me while I'm down, there's only one last thing to say. So long, you miserable hypocrites! It's been real fun!",

        "Lucy: I agree, but before you jump all over me about this --",
        "Lucinda: Wait a moment. Excuse me, my darling. When you called me last night to say that you were gonna spend the night here with Dusty, I said nary a word against it.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, my God. Dad, where would she go? What is she gonna do?",

        "Emily: We can and we will control ourselves, 'cause we're adults.",
        "Chris: Adults with a very intense past.",

        "Emily: Just stop it, all right? Don't start with me now.",
        "Chris: The same thing happens every time that we're alone together, every time we try to control how we feel. One minute, we're standing alone in a mattress store, and the next, we're falling into bed together.",
        "Emily: That happened once.",
        "Chris: It happened lots when we were dating.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, we stopped dating, remember? We broke up.",
        "Chris: Yes, yes, and I never quite got the reason for that.",
        "Emily: I think I know what we need to do.",
        "Chris: You do?",
        "Emily: We need to sit down and talk about our relationship and why it didn't work and the problems we had, and then maybe we'll be able to move on.",
        "Chris: And when exactly do you want to do this?",
        "Emily: Now. Yeah, now. Stay for dinner. We'll sit down and eat like two normal people and get everything out in the open.",
        "Chris: And you think that that will cool things down between us?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm. I mean, it couldn't hurt, right?",
        "Chris: Well, instead of cooling things down, it could just, you know, feed the flames.",

        "Craig: So what do you want? You want me to rise to your bait? So you manipulated my daughter into moving in with you. What a surprise.",
        "Dusty: Is it?",
        "Craig: Oh, Dusty, she was hurt, vulnerable, and you were conveniently always there. It's temporary.",
        "Dusty: It's what you say to yourself so you can sleep at night.",
        "Craig: She's growing up fast, Dusty, but you won't be her last mistake.",
        "Dusty: You still think she's your little girl, turning to papa for all the answers? Those days are gone. They ended when she found out you had her kidnapped. That's why she's with me.",
        "Craig: Oh. Well, she may be with you now, but you are still mad about something, aren't you? You're mad, because even in that hard-boiled fantasy you live in, you don't control her, and you know you never will. Right? She went all the way to the police station, and she couldn't turn me in, like you needed her to. Just one more thing out of Dusty's grasp. Well, she may be with you now, but in time, you'll be just an embarrassing memory. I will always be her father.",

        "Lucinda: Of course I haven't.",
        "Lucy: If this is -- this is my life. If I want to take a few months out to actually enjoy some of it, then I think that's my choice.",

        "Lucy: Grandmother --",
        "Lucinda: I just say that because you're not generally thinking very clearly or rationally. I mean, you're postponing enrollment.",
        "Lucy: Which isn't the end of the world or the end of my future plans. This could be something. I'm in love with Dusty, and he's in love with me, and there's nothing that you or anybody else can do about that.",

        "Jack: No, please don't cut the trip short. If I just sit down for a minute, I'll be fine, really. Where did you say he was again?",

        "Parker: Remember the time Jack took us to the place with the waterfall?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, Luthers Corners, right? Yeah, he loved that place.",
        "Parker: Right. So maybe he's at the waterfall here. It's right over there. Can I go look, please?",

        "Chris: Yeah, well, I told you one day that you would kick yourself for letting me get away.",
        "Emily: Look, I love my husband. I mean, I have a good marriage. I know I do. I mean, we have our problems like everybody else does, but it's a good marriage, and I don't understand why every time I'm with you, there is this force between us, and I can't stop myself.",

        "Lucinda: A summer romance.",
        "Lucy: It's more than that. He saved my life. He means everything to me, and if you can't see that, then I feel really sorry for you.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, please don't be sorry for me.",
        "Lucy: Why, because your life is completely devoid of love and romance, and you can't possible understand what I'm --?",

        "Lucy: That's not what I meant.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no, no. Of course, you're partially correct, darling. I don't have a love in my life. But I have memories. I remember romance and the agony and the ecstasy. And let me tell you something -- I never was a fool for any man.",
        "Lucy: Neither am I.",
        "Lucinda: I beg to differ, dear. This time, not only is love blind, but love is deaf and dumb, too.",

        "Craig: Okay, you wanted me here. I'm here. What do you want -- money? I got no money. You want my life. Is that it? Do you want me to negotiate for my life?",
        "Dusty: That sounds like a good place to start.",

        "Hal: Just for a few hours, until I get back, Emily.",
        "Emily: You think that's she's a real -- Barbara's a danger to me? She's gonna come after me?",
        "Chris: Hal's right. I'm gonna stay.",
        "Hal: All right, thanks. But, listen, in case I get hung up, this could turn into an all-nighter for me. Can you handle it?",
        "Emily: I'm fine alone, really.",
        "Hal: I would feel a lot better if Chris stayed.",
        "Chris: I'd be glad to keep an eye on her.",
        "Hal: Thanks. 'Night.",
        "Emily: Good night. Call me when you hear something.",

        "Lucy: I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, darling. No, you're not. It's your decision that I disapprove of. It doesn't make me love you any less.",
        "Lucy: Tell me something. How is Dusty supposed to measure up when you never approve of anyone?",
        "Lucinda: That's not true at all.",
        "Lucy: You didn't think Holden was the right choice for Lily, and they've been together for years. I know you never approved of my father. And even Paul Ryan, with all of his money, was never good enough for you or anyone else in this family. I've always wanted you to be proud of me. But if you can't accept the decisions that I am making, then -- I can't accept this.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, no! I'm not an Indian giver. That was gift of love to you.",
        "Lucy: If I kept it now, I would feel like I was breaking a promise.",
        "Lucinda: Nonsense, nonsense. You're gonna get back on track. You have to. You're my namesake. There's a lot of me in you. I'm sorry about that, and I just know -- I know that you're gonna succeed in everything you do, despite this -- this detour.",
        "Lucy: Then why can't you give me your blessing? I need you to love me enough to let me make my own choices, even if they seem like mistakes in your eyes. Can you do that for me, Grandmother, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, let's hear it, my man. How do you want to meet your maker? Jump, get pushed or take a bullet right between the eyes?",
        "Craig: You can't be serious.",
        "Dusty: Want to find out how serious? Give me an answer.",
        "Craig: You're going to kill me?",
        "Dusty: Or you can make it a do-it-yourself project. I told you, it's up to you.",
        "Craig: After everything -- you're going to -- you're going to -- [Craig laughs] You kill me, Dusty! Oh!",
        "Dusty: I'm going to, after you tell me what's so funny.",
        "Craig: You want me to drop to my knees and blubber, huh?",
        "Dusty: If your life means anything to you --",
        "Craig: Hey, look -- I'll make it easy for you. Come on, macho. One little push. Huh? That's it. One little push. If you've got the conviction. I don't think you do.",
        "Craig: Hey, guess what? I'm already dead. I've lost everything I cared about. So go ahead. Impress me, macho. Put me out of my misery. Oh, okay. You don't have the conviction, do you?",
        "Dusty: You go near Lucy again, and I'll kill ya.",
        "Craig: You need me alive, genius.",
        "Dusty: No, I don't.",
        "Craig: Anything happens to me, you're the first one they finger. And guess what? If Lucy ever suspects you of anything, she will smell you for the predator that you are. Come right back to me.",
        "Dusty: Lucy doesn't give a damn about you.",
        "Craig: No, she loves me, Dusty. I'm her father.",
        "Dusty: She knows the truth. She knows the truth about you now.",
        "Craig: The truth is, I am her father. She knows my flaws. She knows them all. She knows my flaws. She knows my shortcomings. But I will always be her daddy. And she will always be my little girl. A little angry, a little rebellious. And so she wastes a little time -- with worthless trash like you, Aaron Snyder. But she always comes back to Daddy.",
        "Dusty: We'll see about that.",
        "Craig: Yes, we will. And I'm guessing you're not gonna like it.",

        "Emily: There's more danger in you spending the night with me than Barbara making some kind of surprise visit.",
        "Chris: I made a promise to your husband.",
        "Emily: So did I. And this is a disaster waiting to happen. So could you just go, please? Go!",
        "Chris: Nothing is going to happen, okay? Look at you. You're trembling.",
        "Emily: That woman terrifies me, okay? She's wanted me dead ever since I married Hal.",
        "Chris: Hey, relax. Everything's gonna be --",
        "Emily: I'm gonna get the gun.",
        "Chris: What gun?",
        "Emily: There's a gun in the garage. Hal keeps it in the garage locked up.",
        "Chris: And you want to bring it in the house?",
        "Emily: Yes, all right? I hate guns, but I'm not gonna let that lunatic hurt me again!",
        "Chris: Fine, fine. Whatever's gonna make you feel better. We'll go get the gun.",
        "Emily: I don't need you to come with me, okay? I'm fine.",

        "Lucinda: What is with this guy?",
        "Lucy: Have you forgotten how much he's done for me?",
        "Lucinda: No! No. Now, look, and I will never forget. I'll never forget that he saved your life and brought you home safe to us. And I will always be grateful for that. But, you know, I won't forget other things about Dusty. I've known him since he was a cute kid. And like -- like the proverbial snow, he has drifted, dear. Think of the scandal, the money laundering with Lily!",
        "Lucy: He's different now.",
        "Lucinda: That remains to be seen.",
        "Lucy: You don't even know him.",
        "Lucinda: But I know you. And you are an honorable girl, and you've been blessed with many gifts. Not the least is a family that loves you. So don't take us -- any of us -- for granted.",
        "Lucy: I'm not.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my darling, I just worry that, you know, in the future sometime, you and Mom and I will be sitting down, and you'll wish that you had taken another path. But I honor you. And I know that, in the future, I will shower you with praise as well as love for all the things you're going to accomplish. And I look forward to that time. I do, really. I mean that.",

        "J.J.: It's mine!",
        "Julia: And we know that because we put his initials on all of his toys for school. See?",
        "Carly: Oh, you see, sweetheart? That's J.J.'s. You must've left your Spongebob guy at home.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I guess. Sorry, J.J.",
        "Carly: No, why don't you go ahead and shake his hand, okay? I'm sorry. Parker's been going through a lot. He lost somebody very important to him.",
