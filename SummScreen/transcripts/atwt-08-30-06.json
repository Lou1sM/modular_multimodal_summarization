        "Jack: Yeah, let me grab those --",
        "Carly: Thanks. I hit a sale. I thought the boys should have some new clothes for school.",
        "Jack: Oh, right. You really don't mind me dropping them off, huh?",
        "Carly: Well, no, as long as you remember to take pictures and take lots of video.",
        "Jack: Lots of video -- of course, yeah, I understand.",
        "Carly: All right, well, I'll go through that stuff and pick out their outfits then.",
        "Jack: Sure. Just don't tell the boys they're outfits, that's all. You know those health forms? Do you have them?",
        "Carly: You have the health forms, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, I don't --",
        "Carly: Jack, I gave them you the health forms.",
        "Jack: You're right. You're right. They're upstairs. I wanted to know who else you wanted to put on the emergency list.",
        "Carly: Emma, I guess.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll go grab them.",

        "Meg: Okay, what's Emily done now?",
        "Paul: Okay, it's not Emily -- it's me. I asked Lucy to contact Craig -- find out if he would be willing to sell \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Meg: To you?",
        "Paul: Well, somebody's gotta salvage that business, keep it afloat -- otherwise, Emily's going to stress herself out into a whole other crisis with this baby.",
        "Meg: There's not enough flowers in the world \u0096",

        "Jade: Poor little guy. He looks like a stick, I almost stepped on him.",
        "Will: It's a female.",
        "Jade: How could you possibly tell?",
        "Will: Well, the males have to fight for the females, so they're brighter. It makes them more noticeable, more attractive.",
        "Jade: That's not fair. How's life in the bug's world -- tough finding and keeping a guy?",
        "Will: You should get going, if you want to find Luke before it gets too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Casey, wait --",
        "Casey: I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I need to talk to you. Don't walk away from me!",
        "Casey: Or what?",
        "Maddie: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Casey: I'm not gonna tell anybody you were here.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you have to listen to me.",
        "Casey: No, you know, I can't listen, all right? I've tried, and it hurts too much.",
        "Maddie: Casey, wait!",
        "Casey: What the hell?",
        "Maddie: Casey --",
        "Casey: Get away.",
        "Maddie: No, I had no idea that --",
        "Casey: Don't --",
        "Maddie: No, somebody put that in there! Somebody put that in there -- he wants me to look like the killer because everybody knows what he did to me! He wants me dead, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Geneva: Did you see him?",
        "Gwen: See who?",
        "Geneva: That freak! He was watching me!",
        "Maddie: Casey, I know this sounds crazy --",
        "Casey: Yeah? Well, who's this guy you keep talking about? And what did he do?",
        "Maddie: He raped me, Casey.",
        "Casey: All right, it should be safe here.",
        "Maddie: The door?",
        "Casey: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Maddie: I couldn't. Then I would've had to remember. And I didn't want to remember. So I just acted like it was something that happened to somebody else.",
        "Casey: But you're remembering it now?",
        "Maddie: Because of Dallas Griffin.",
        "Casey: Is he the guy that --",
        "Maddie: No. No. He -- he was the officer that was at the hospital the night it happened. And then he showed up in Oakdale, and I couldn't hide from it anymore. That's when I started acting weird. And I was afraid to be with you.",
        "Casey: I couldn't figure what went wrong.",
        "Maddie: Being close to you reminded me of the rape. And I was losing it, Casey. So much that I thought that maybe I did kill Lia and Nate. And I didn't want to end up hurting you, too.",
        "Casey: But you didn't kill anyone.",
        "Maddie: I know. But he wants people to think that I'm crazy, and I'm not. I need you to believe that. Please.",
        "Casey: I do. I do, Maddie. I believe you. Tell me who this guy is.",
        "Maddie: My sister's husband, Louis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Geneva: That guy is a total pervert.",
        "Gwen: You okay?",
        "Geneva: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Hey, did you get a good look at him?",
        "Geneva: No, but he had binoculars.",
        "Gwen: You know what? Here. Take this, put this on. Come on, let's go find the others and warn them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: See anything interesting?",
        "Will: We're here to make the camp.",
        "Jade: And then build a fire. You want to come?",
        "Luke: Later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liv: Thinking about your boyfriend?",
        "Kevin: Knock it off, Liv.",
        "Liv: You and Luke were pretty close last year. Didn't you used to crash at his place sometimes?",
        "Kevin: I never switched teams, okay?",
        "Liv: Prove it.",
        "Kevin: Any time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Don't stay here by yourself --",
        "Will: Jade --",
        "Jade: We're all gonna be stuffing our faces with s'mores. You don't want to miss that, do you?",
        "Luke: Save me one.",
        "Jade: Come on, Luke. You don't want to be alone right now.",
        "Luke: I'll meet you back at camp.",
        "Jade: When?",
        "Luke: When I feel like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Geneva: He took off before I could yell for help.",
        "Gil: But you didn't see his face?",
        "Geneva: I did -- but I didn't. I mean, it all happened so quick. I mean, I think he was my dad's age maybe, or a little younger.",
        "Tad: It was probably just some old guy taking pictures for his website. Maybe you're famous, Geneva.",
        "Geneva: Shut up.",
        "Gil: It's not funny. Okay, everybody stick close and keep your eyes open. We're gonna build the campfire.",
        "Gil: You want to go get the marshmallows?",
        "Geneva: Ooh, where are they?",
        "Gil: In the cabin.",
        "Geneva: Be right back.",
        "Gwen: You know, maybe I should go with her.",
        "Gil: Yeah, good idea.",
        "Groupie: Gwen, hey, I saw you play at Crash. You were great.",
        "Gwen: Oh, thanks, that's really nice.",
        "Groupie: Do you think you could show me the chords to that song \"Tube.\" It's amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Slow down.",
        "Will: Sorry, I want to get back.",
        "Jade: To Gwen?",
        "Will: Well, yeah, she's the reason I'm here.",
        "Jade: It was nice of you to squeeze Luke in. Who cares if he's all alone, feeling like a total loser --?",
        "Will: What do you want me to do? Do you want me to make Kevin not be a jerk?",
        "Jade: Look, I'm sorry Gwen won't give you the time of day, but it's not my fault. I'm trying, Will. How many more ways are you gonna tell me I'm not good enough?",
        "Will: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Jade: That's exactly what you're saying!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You shouldn't have come alone.",
        "Maddie: I had to, I had to make you understand.",
        "Casey: Why didn't they arrest your brother-in-law?",
        "Maddie: He took off. And now the cops are looking for him. And I didn't want to wait until they found him. I wanted to be the one to tell you. And I needed to make sure that you didn't hate me.",
        "Casey: Hate you? Maddie, I could never hate you.",
        "Maddie: I'm so sorry, Casey. I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry, too.",
        "Maddie: I was just so scared, and I -- but I've missed you so much. I've missed you. I want to get better. And I want us to -- [Footsteps] What was that?",
        "Casey: I don't know.",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God. It's Louis. He found me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's from, Eve. You met her -- Henry's sister?",
        "Carly: Oh. Yeah, I know that, Jack. I sort of read the note.",
        "Jack: Some things never change.",
        "Carly: So, isn't she --",
        "Jack: Married? Yeah. Yeah. She's just a friend.",
        "Carly: Good friend.",
        "Jack: I barely know her.",
        "Carly: Have the kids met her?",
        "Jack: We haven't gone to the drive-in, if that's what you mean.",
        "Carly: Would you like to?",
        "Jack: Carly, come on. We've been separated only a few months, all right? And look at me, I'm one step away from living at home with my mom.",
        "Carly: And the kids love coming here.",
        "Jack: They seem to be handling things.",
        "Carly: They have their moments. So, is there anything else that you'd like to tell me about Eve?",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: There's not much to tell.",
        "Carly: She has very good taste in wine.",
        "Jack: I helped her out, listened -- this isn't weird for you?",
        "Carly: What? Because another woman finds you attractive?",
        "Jack: No, because we're talking about another woman finding me attractive.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, things are moving very quickly. For both of us. I have a job now, and the kids are used to a new routine. Maybe it's time that we all crawled out of limbo.",
        "Jack: Meaning?",
        "Carly: Meaning, maybe it's time that we finally filed for the divorce.",
        "Jack: You're right. Maybe we should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: All right. You see, that, right there? That's negative thinking. If you expect a disaster, than that's what you'll get.",
        "Meg: Craig won't give you the time of day, much less a depreciable asset --",
        "Paul: Well, maybe Craig doesn't need to know that I'm the one buying the paper.",
        "Meg: Have we learned nothing?",
        "Paul: Come on, Meg, think about it. Emily would be happy for once. She'd have her career back on track, she'd be financially independent.",
        "Meg: No, dependent on you -- again.",
        "Paul: Me? No, I'm just a name on a check, if that even.",
        "Meg: Okay, you wait. She's going to lock horns over who gets what byline and what ad to run --",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Meg, for me, this is just an investment that I hand off to other people.",
        "Meg: People she's going to bypass to get to you.",
        "Paul: It's worth a shot.",
        "Meg: You've already made up your mind.",
        "Paul: Come on, Meg, look. Stop, wait. Hold on a second. You don't understand. This whole newspaper deal gets us one step closer to you sitting in that rocking chair with our baby. But you know what? Maybe we have bigger problems than Emily and Craig.",
        "Meg: Well, I can't wait to hear this.",
        "Paul: Well, there's you. Because until you let me put a ring on your finger, all of our hard work and our planning, it doesn't mean a damn thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, it's okay. It was probably just an animal, like a deer or something.",
        "Maddie: No, Louis is following me. I shouldn't have come here.",
        "Casey: But you did the right thing.",
        "Maddie: No, because now I put you in danger.",
        "Casey: All right, well, who else knows you're here?",
        "Maddie: Nobody. Henry thinks I'm with Eve, and Eve thinks I'm with Henry.",
        "Casey: All right, let's get out of here.",
        "Maddie: But where?",
        "Casey: I don't know yet.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I'm scared.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Do you trust me?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: That's what I'm talkin' about.",
        "Liv: I don't know, Kevin. I think I need less talk and more action.",
        "Liv: Is that your \"A\" game? Not too convincing.",
        "Kevin: That's it. You asked for it.",
        "Liv: Real romantic.",
        "Kevin: Go get it.",
        "Liv: You know I can't swim.",
        "Kevin: You don't have to swim.",
        "Liv: It's not funny, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Come on. I'll hold you. We'll float.",
        "Liv: Oh, this is war. Kevin! Get it. Give it back.",
        "Luke: Who's there? Jade? Will?",
        "Liv: Kevin! Give it back, I mean it.",
        "Kevin: If you want it, you know what you have to do.",

        "Liv: Oh, my God! Kevin? Kevin? Oh, my God!",
        "Liv: Help! Somebody help!",

        "Geneva: Nope, just me.",
        "Will: Well, where'd you get her sweatshirt?",
        "Geneva: She lent it to me. Gwen's back at the campsite. Hey, tell everyone I'll be back in a jiff with the marshmallows.",
        "Gwen: Why don't you give it a shot?",
        "Groupie: I think I need Zach on harmonica.",
        "Gil: Has anybody even seen Zach or Ann since we got back?",
        "Tad: Not me.",
        "Ada: Me, either.",

        "Casey: Here, come on, rest up for a second.",
        "Maddie: We can't.",
        "Casey: It's okay.",
        "Maddie: What was that?",
        "Casey: I didn't hear anything. I think we're alone. Look, I need to tell you something.",
        "Maddie: Oh, you think I'm crazy after all?",
        "Casey: No. I'm sorry, too.",
        "Maddie: For what?",
        "Casey: For giving up on us.",
        "Maddie: You didn't give up.",
        "Casey: I should have tried harder.",
        "Maddie: I pushed you away.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but Maddie, if I'd only known -- I feel terrible. I mean, no wonder you ran away every time we got close. If I only had been able to convince you that it was okay, that no matter how long waited, I'm still gonna be here. I'm here right now. I'm gonna be here.",
        "Maddie: What if I -- what if I'm never ready?",
        "Casey: Maddie -- I want to help, but you need to tell me how.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you already have. I --",
        "Casey: What? Knock it off, Zach! Maddie, it's okay, he did the same thing this afternoon and scared Ann and Gwen half to death. Seriously, Zach -- not funny!",

        "Jack: Okay, whatever. Just let me know if we need to meet.",

        "Carly: No. No, Simon, for once it's not you.",

        "Simon: Usually, when it's gone this far, right?",

        "Simon: Carly, listen, I know this must be tough on you, but I'm sure it doesn't have to be a sad ending. I mean, think of it as a new and exciting beginning. One requires tears, the other -- a drink with a foolish Aussie who wants nothing more than to see you smile. It's your call.",
