        "Vienna: We're going to miss Jack and Katie's engagement party if we don't stop.",
        "Henry: Who?",
        "Vienna: Oh Henry, you're terrible.",
        "Henry: I think -- listen to me -- I think that after a long day of serving our loyal customers and earning an honest buck, we owe it to ourselves to enjoy all the perks of being our own bosses.",
        "Col Mayer: Oh, pardon me? I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong place. I'm looking for a Henry Coleman.",
        "Vienna: Oh, no, no, no, you found him. Henry, this very handsome man is here to see you.",
        "Henry: Hi, hi, how's it going? We're closed.",
        "Col. Mayer: The sign outside said open 24 hours.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, it's kind of private party, you know what I'm saying? Can you come back tomorrow?",
        "Col. Mayer: Perhaps I should introduce myself. I'm Colonel Winston Mayer. My son, Noah, is moving in with your sister. And I thought under the circumstances, we should probably meet.",
        "Henry: Absolutely, yes, yes. It's a pleasure -- pleasure to meet you, Sir. Maddie has told me so -- you're a Colonel.",
        "Vienna: Colonel, please sit down.",
        "Col. Mayer: Oh, no, no --",
        "Vienna: And yes, you're right. We should get friendly.",
        "Col. Mayer: No, thank you. That's -- that's -- no, I mean, look, you and Mr. Coleman seem very busy.",
        "Vienna: Oh, no, no, we were just fooling around. We can do that anytime. Please sit. Sit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: And it's really great because they have all of these cute, little one bedroom apartments right near the campus.",
        "Luke: Oh, so, you guys are getting a one bedroom?",
        "Maddie: Well, I mean, that's all the space we need and that's all we can afford. But we think we found the perfect place, right?",
        "Noah: Yeah, we liked it so much, we were ready to sign the lease right there.",
        "Luke: Well, I've heard once you find the right one, you know. Dad, Dad -- hey, what's going on? I thought you and Mom were going to a party at the farm?",
        "Holden: Yeah, in a bit.",
        "Luke: Is everything okay?",

        "Holden: Nice to meet you, too.",
        "Luke: Dad, really, what's going on? You're acting very strange.",
        "Holden: Have you heard about the shooting at the Lakeview?",
        "Luke: What? No, let me see this.",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God, Noah, look -- that's the woman that we saw Dusty arguing with. He grabbed her and said she'd be sorry, remember?",
        "Noah: Yeah, I know. That's crazy.",
        "Holden: Wait. You heard Dusty threaten her?",
        "Maddie: We walked in on it. Your mom must be freaking out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, probably. I mean, it's her hotel, and Dusty's a good friend of hers.",
        "Maddie: Right, but not only that, I mean, she was --",
        "Holden: She was what? Maddie --",
        "Maddie: She was there, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just heard. Rosanna's at the Lakeview with Paul? She's awake, Paul is alive, what are you wearing?",
        "Carly: This old thing?",
        "Lily: It's a little -- yeah, it's a cute little number. Where're you going?",
        "Carly: Jack and Katie's engagement party. I was invited.",
        "Lily: So was I. It's a casual attire affair. It's a barbeque.",
        "Carly: So, I can't look nice?",
        "Lily: You can't look like that. What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come on, Guys, put a little muscle in it.",
        "Parker: Well, this is supposed to be a party, can we do something fun?",
        "J.J.: Yeah, like burn something on the grill.",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah, and we could get the flames to shoot up. That would so rule.",
        "Jack: You could help Sage and Katie with the balloons if you like?",
        "J.J.: No, that's girl stuff.",
        "Jack: Okay, then forget that pyromania and let's get the benches.",
        "Katie: How many balloons do you think we need? Obviously, I can guess what your favorite color is, because we used up all the pink ones.",
        "Sage: Mommy and I both like yellow best.",
        "Katie: Well, luckily, we have a lot of yellow ones left, where do you think we should put them? How about on this chair here? So I was thinking, when I marry your dad, I'm going to need a flower girl. What do you think? Are you interested?",
        "Sage: Really?",
        "Katie: Really, of course. Who else would I ask? Oh, but I do have to say one thing, you cannot show up the bride. You have to promise, because that would not be cool.",
        "Sage: I promise, I won't.",
        "Katie: Okay, you're in.",
        "Sage: Daddy, Daddy! Katie said I could be the flower girl at your wedding.",
        "Brad: Darn, I was hoping that you would ask me to be your flower girl.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, you? You would definitely take attention away from the bride.",
        "Brad: That's impossible. Hey, where are you going?",
        "Katie: There's still more setting up to do for the party. Why?",
        "Brad: Well, I've hardly seen you since you've been back.",
        "Katie: Well, weren't you supposed to be looking at the dailies from Hawaii shoot? Doesn't that count as seeing me?",
        "Brad: No. Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, the hula segment. That was wow, Man, that was some mind altering TV right there.",
        "Katie: That's nice. What is that supposed to be? A compliment?",
        "Brad: Hey, aren't you going to thank me?",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Brad: For protecting your territory. Slowing down the Carly express. Man, I single-handedly, you know, saved your entire future with Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not up to anything. I was invited to a party and I'm going.",
        "Lily: Carly, give me a little more credit. I know how you operate. This is not just some little black dress.",
        "Carly: All right, so the dress is special. Jack's favorite. He could never resist me in this dress.",
        "Lily: Or out of it.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. Stop making it sound like I'm going to pounce on the man if he asks if I want a burger. I'm not.",
        "Lily: Don't tell me that you're not trying to get Jack's attention in that dress. This is an engagement party. To Katie.",
        "Carly: But he's not in love with her.",
        "Lily: Carly --",
        "Carly: He doesn't love her the way that he loves me. I've seen the way that he still looks at me. He feels what I feel. The pull. The connection. And no matter what he says, that will never change.",
        "Lily: You do know that this is crazy, don't you?",
        "Carly: It's not crazy. It's called fighting for what I want. And for what I know, deep down inside, Jack wants too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What exactly did you hear Dusty say to this Cheri woman?",
        "Maddie: Well, she said something like she was -- she meant to hurt him and she was glad that she did. And then, he told her that she would be sorry and that's when Mrs. Snyder interrupted them.",
        "Luke: Wait, Mom didn't tell you about any of this?",
        "Holden: Well, I've barely seen your mother lately. Anyway, we talked about it briefly.",
        "Luke: Well, did you hear what this woman said? Like how she was going to hurt Dusty?",
        "Holden: Cheri Love was the one responsible for posting that video of Dusty and Alison Stewart online.",
        "Noah: Man. That explains why Dusty was so upset. I mean, putting his personal life out there for everybody to see and talk about.",
        "Maddie: You know what? I'm so sorry. I told Henry that I'd meet him so he can co-sign the lease.",
        "Noah: Oh, do you want me to come with you?",
        "Maddie: No, that's fine. Besides, you wanted to edit some \"Invisible Girl\", right?",
        "Holden: Is that the project you've been writing?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. Noah's directing and editing and Maddie, as you know, is our star.",
        "Maddie: Well, it's a very tough job I have. Are you guys going to be back at the studio?",
        "Noah: Well, I did need to do some editing. I didn't know Luke was going to --",
        "Luke: Well, I was going to do some writing --",
        "Noah: I don't --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, it's okay. Go, go, I have to talk to my dad anyways.",
        "Noah: Okay. It's very nice to meet you, Sir.",
        "Holden: You, too.",
        "Maddie: Bye.",
        "Noah: Bye-bye.",
        "Holden: Is everything all right at work?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Something just seemed a little off. You didn't want to help with that edit.",
        "Luke: Uh, Noah knows what he's doing. He doesn't need me looking over his shoulder.",
        "Holden: Seems like a good kid. Don't you like him?",
        "Luke: What? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Luke: Dad, I really, really don't want to talk about this with you.",
        "Holden: I just don't want to see you unhappy, especially after everything that happened with Kevin.",
        "Luke: Kevin, that was completely different. You know, Kevin wasn't -- it was just different.",
        "Holden: Yes, this is different. You work with this guy. He's dating Maddie, she's your friend --",
        "Luke: Dad. I know. I get it. And I have it under control. So don't worry, okay?",
        "Holden: You're my son. One day you'll be 52 and you know what I'll be worried about? You.",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Luke: So, why didn't Mom tell you about this fight between Dusty and this Cheri woman?",
        "Holden: You know, things just have been crazy with me and your mom lately.",
        "Luke: Right. Look, what's going on between you two?",
        "Holden: You know what? Don't worry about it.",
        "Luke: Dad, one day you'll be 52, and you know what I'll be worried about?",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Luke: That you didn't do everything you could to fix things with Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Carly, you know Jack. He's not throwing this party to get to you. He's doing it to celebrate the fact that he's in love with Katie. And he's going to marry her. He's moved on.",
        "Carly: No, he hasn't. He's just -- he's trying to convince himself that he has.",
        "Lily: But he's doing a pretty good job of it.",
        "Carly: I wish you could see him when it's just the two of us. When we were together, looking for J.J., we were in sync. Working together. We were reading each other's minds.",
        "Lily: Your child was missing. Of course, there's going to be a connection between the two of you. Who wouldn't be connected?",
        "Carly: It was more than that. When he was here, and Katie was gone, there were times when we were a family again. We were Jack and Carly. He wanted me.",
        "Lily: Did something happen between the two of you --",
        "Carly: No. No, nothing like that.",
        "Lily: Carly --",
        "Carly: I can -- I can just tell that he still wants me.",
        "Lily: Carly --",
        "Carly: I know what I feel.",
        "Lily: Carly --",
        "Carly: And I know --",
        "Lily: Carly, you have to stop! None of this helping. Nothing happened with Jack when he was here because he's in love with Katie. I'm sorry. I know that's harsh. But I don't know how else to get through to you.",
        "Carly: You really think this marriage is going to happen.",
        "Lily: You don't?",
        "Carly: I know Jack. And I know when he accepts that what he feels for me is real, he'll come back to me.",
        "Lily: It's like talking to a brick wall. But I do love you.",
        "Carly: I love you too. But you know as well as I do, that Jack belongs with me. Not Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: My relationship with Jack doesn't need saving.",
        "Brad: Well, not anymore, I mean, thanks to me. I told you I was going to keep an eye on Carly, especially since Jack was all -- you know, laid up and helpless on Carly's couch.",
        "Katie: I specifically told you not to do anything.",
        "Brad: Do you know how many things you tell me not to do?",
        "Katie: Apparently not enough, because you keep doing them anyway. You don't listen.",
        "Brad: What? I listen to you. You didn't see what Carly was trying to do!",
        "Katie: I don't care. I don't care, Brad.",
        "Brad: Really?",
        "Katie: Really.",
        "Brad: Really?",
        "Katie: And you know why?",
        "Brad: Enlighten me.",
        "Katie: Because Jack and I are adults. We have an adult relationship based on respect and openness and communication.",
        "Brad: Whoa, wow, you'd better stop talking like that, you're getting me all hot and bothered.",
        "Katie: And we love each other. When we got together, we didn't have to manipulate people or situations, like you and Carly are so hell-bent on doing. It happened, naturally and slowly and beautifully, because it's meant to be.",
        "Brad: Well, I'll tell you what? Carly sure doesn't see things that way --",
        "Katie: Carly is only a problem because you keep throwing her in my face. And I'm tired of it.",
        "Brad: Okay. Okay, okay. I overstepped the bounds, the lines. You know, but what I did, I did for you. Don't laugh. So you could be -- have a happy future with Jack.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Brad: You know, and considering how I feel about the two of you together, I thought that would prove to you that I was being sincere.",
        "Katie: Do you want to prove to me that you're sincere? Apologize.",
        "Brad: For what?",
        "Katie: For interfering in my life when I keep telling you not to.",
        "Brad: Fine. I am sorry. It will never happen again.",
        "Katie: Just out of curiosity, what did Carly do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: How did you manage to get lipstick all the way over here?",
        "Henry: Well, some things must remain mysteries, Sweetheart. So, I -- I'm really glad that you stopped by, Sir. Colonel. Colonel Sir.",
        "Col. Mayer: You can call me \"Win.\"",
        "Vienna: Oh, Win! That's a fantastic name. You must be a lucky man.",
        "Col. Mayer: Not as lucky -- I suppose, yes!",
        "Vienna: Oh well, you most certainly are a very handsome man. No wonder our dear Madeline is so crazy about your son! Oh, and Henry's right, it's so good to meet you!",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, down. Let the man breathe, yeah?",
        "Col. Mayer: Thank you. Your sister tells me you recently acquired this establishment?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry actually won it with the most glorious hand in - -",
        "Henry: Oh, I don't think the Colonel needs to hear all the boring details.",
        "Col. Mayer: And did you always want to be in the service industry?",
        "Henry: No. I just sort of fell into it.",
        "Col. Mayer: What did you do before?",
        "Henry: Oh, a little of this, a little that.",
        "Vienna: Oh, please. Don't be so modest, Henry. Before, Henry -- he was a card shark, he was a TV producer, a private investigator, and he was a limo driver. So, you might say that I have a thing for a man in uniform?",
        "Henry: And what is it that you do, Colonel?",
        "Col. Mayer: I'm a Colonel. In the army. Retired, of course.",
        "Henry: Ah, yes, of course. Of course! Semper fi! Wait a second -- that's the marines, I'm sorry.",
        "Col. Mayer: It doesn't matter. Considering your fondness for uniforms, I must say that is certainly quite the outfit you have on.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, isn't it amazing? You should have seen what they were wearing before.",
        "Henry: Coffee?",
        "Col. Mayer: Please.",
        "Maddie: Henry, thank you so much for co-signing this lease. Otherwise Noah and I would not be able to get this apartment. Ask me again how happy I am that you're finally a legitimate business man.",
        "Henry: Madeline --",
        "Maddie: Yeah, it's right here --",
        "Henry: Madeline --",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Henry: We have company.",
        "Maddie: Colonel Mayer. What are you doing here?",
        "Col. Mayer: I, you know, since you're moving in with my son, I thought I should meet your family -- and words fail to describe the experience.",

        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Noah: You came. I didn't think you were going to.",

        "Noah: No. No, not at all.",
        "Luke: I believe you.",
        "Noah: Okay.",
        "Luke: I just wish it didn't make you so uncomfortable.",

        "Lily: Holden, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to keep you waiting, but I was caught up --",
        "Holden: Doing what? Breaking up another fight? Like you did between Dusty and Cheri?",
        "Lily: Who told you about that?",
        "Holden: I can tell you who didn't.",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm --",
        "Holden: Lily, I want to know when you were planning to tell me you not only saw Dusty with that woman, but you heard him threaten her.",
        "Lily: Can we not do this here?",
        "Holden: No, we are going to do this here, because I want answered, now. When we talked about this the other night, you had nothing to say.",
        "Lily: I -- I was just waiting for the right time.",
        "Holden: The right time? It's never the right time for you. You were never going to tell me about it.",
        "Lily: If you'd just let me explain, please --",
        "Holden: I'm tired of your explanations, and I'm tired for hearing your stories second hand.",
        "Lily: I wasn't -- [Lily sighs] it's not like I wasn't telling you. You were just so angry with me when I hid Dusty's gun from the police - -",
        "Holden: So, you keeping anymore secrets?",
        "Lily: Yes, because I knew you'd be upset about the situation -- about Dusty. I just -- I couldn't take it.",
        "Holden: So, you kept quiet.",
        "Lily: What was I supposed to do? I couldn't tell the police.",
        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because they could've misunderstand the entire situation!",
        "Holden: Yes, like me? What am I not getting here?",
        "Lily: Dusty was furious with Cheri, after she posted that video, online, of him with Alison. He had every right to be angry with her, but he did not kill her, Holden!",
        "Holden: Right. Right. That's why you took the gun. That's why you tried to hide it from the cops. You know what, you're lucky that you didn't get charged with obstruction. Am I the only one who's putting us first here?",
        "Lily: Dusty needed me. And he still needs me. I have to be there for him. He doesn't have anybody else.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe there's a reason nobody wants to stand up for the guy.",
        "Lily: I can't -- I can't do this. I can't. Why don't you go to the party, and I'll meet you there, later?",
        "Holden: Where are you going? Answer me.",
        "Lily: I'm going to the police station to post bail for Dusty.",

        "Brad: Well, she thinks she and Jack are inevitable, and it's just a matter of time before he comes back to her, and wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.",
        "Katie: I see.",
        "Brad: Look, if you ask me, if it was going to happen, it would've happened by now. He was on the couch for, like, what, a few days? If she couldn't make it then, it's not going to happen. You okay?",
        "Katie: I'm fine. Yeah. I'm just going to go say hi to some of the other guests. Thank you, Brad. For what you did. However unnecessary it was, it was sweet.",

I was sleepwalking through the day. And what I needed, what I didn't even know I needed, was a friend. And those of you who know Katie know that's what she does best. She listened and she didn't judge and she was there. No matter what. And it took awhile for me to realize, I'm a little slow on the uptake, but it took a while for me to realize that I had this really amazing person in my life. And one day I was looking at her, and I thought -- if I lose her, if I let her go, if I don't kiss right then and there, then I am the world's biggest idiot. So I did. I kissed her, and that was that. I was sold. I was gone. One kiss and I was completely woken up.",
