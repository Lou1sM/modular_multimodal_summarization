Paul turns down James money and when James tells him he is getting the money anyway Paul tells James he is giving the money away.

        "Emily: Are you sure you have enough closet space in this place for me?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Well, not really. I don't know. I'll throw away all of my clothes if it'll make you stay. So, uh -- what do you think of all of this, huh?",
        "Emily: I think it beats living with my mother. So, tell me one more time, how much do we love our paper?",
        "Paul: That's your reason. \"Beats living with my mother.\" That's why you're moving back in with me?",
        "Emily: No, babe. I moved back in with you because you have 1,000-thread-count sheets and maid service.",
        "Paul: Well, and?",
        "Emily: And you gave me a bunch of money to start a paper.",
        "Paul: And?",
        "Emily: There's something else about this place, but I can't remember what it is. It's on the tip of my tongue. That's what I'm talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I am so proud of you, Henry.",
        "Henry: Why is that, Hon? Turning my back on the old man?",
        "Vienna: Yes, and now you don't have to have anything to do with him ever again.",
        "Henry: And if I should get James' money, his inheritance, when he dies?",
        "Vienna: Well, then you just pass it over to your mother, and that'll be it. I feel so good about that.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Me too.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Geez.",
        "Audrey: I need you to go with me to see your father. It's a matter of life and death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Now, if you need some time to think about this, Mr. Stenbeck --",
        "James: Time? I don't know I have any time. As far as I know, I could be dead by the end of the day. So, it's imperative these changes need to be made now, right now.",
        "Lawyer: As you wish.",
        "James: Yeah. Hansen, another thing. I want to see my son. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, where's Emma?",
        "Parker: She's upstairs taking a nap.",
        "Jack: Anybody else around?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Jack: So, Faith is gone, Emma's upstairs. Why are you hanging around here?",
        "Parker: I was hoping to run in to Liberty.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Mom, please let me go to Chicago. It's the only chance I'm gonna get to look at colleges with Mac.",
        "Janet: Hey, I know that Mackenzie is your best friend and all, but isn't it important for me to like the college, too?",
        "Liberty: Yes, totally! And that is why, like Teri said, that we can go look at colleges together later.",
        "Janet: That's a good idea. You know what? In a couple weeks, I'll take a couple of days off, and we'll go together.",
        "Liberty: A couple weeks?",
        "Janet: Honey, you're still sick. In a few weeks, we will both feel better, and we'll go, okay?",
        "Teri: I think you're making a big mistake, Jan.",
        "Janet: Okay. Teresa, you haven't been a hands-on aunt for very long, so I'll forgive you for breaking the number-one rule.",
        "Teri: Which is?",
        "Janet: If you don't want a big fight with your sister, don't tell her how to raise her kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why should I answer any more of your questions when you never accept my answers?",
        "Rosanna: Well, why don't you try me?",
        "Craig: My trip to New York is not a cover. I am not having a secret love-fest with Teri Ciccone.",
        "Rosanna: I wonder if you even remember how to tell the truth anymore.",
        "Craig: Oh, actually, I lie to you every chance I get.",
        "Rosanna: You do?",
        "Craig: Yes, in order to avoid just the kind of tirade you're giving to me right now, because no matter what I do, you turn it into a reason to dump on me, and I'm getting sick and tired of it.",
        "Rosanna: How did you just turn this all into my problem?",
        "Craig: If you don't see what's in front of you, it is your problem. Do you really think Teri and I are having secret love trysts?",
        "Rosanna: You know, you claim to love Carly, but the first young, attractive woman who happens to spend a little extra attention on you, you're just zipping around!",
        "Craig: I do love your sister. What is this really about, Rosanna? When I was married to you, did I cheat, ever? No.",
        "Rosanna: There are worse things than cheating, Craig. Get out.",
        "Craig: Well, you lost me. What are you accusing me of now?",
        "Rosanna: Of doing whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it, no matter who gets hurt!",
        "Craig: That's certainly not what I'm doing. But you know what the hell of it is? Deep down, you know I love your sister, and that's why you've come up with this ridiculous theory about me and Teri.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not the one lying about photo shoots.",
        "Craig: But that's the plan, isn't it? Gather damning evidence, take it all back to Carly, and blow me out of the water. It's not gonna work.",
        "Rosanna: Sounds like a good idea to me.",
        "Craig: The thing is, the only thing you'll ever catch me doing is staying faithful to Carly. Everything else is in your head. So stop flailing around, looking for ways to separate us.",
        "Rosanna: You're really going to New York alone?",
        "Craig: I really am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: There was something that was bugging her that she wanted to talk about. We got interrupted, and now I just want to make sure that she's all right.",
        "Jack: Well, considering your history with Liberty, maybe you should just stay out of it.",
        "Parker: You just said that family should stick together.",
        "Jack: That's different.",
        "Parker: Really? Because Janet is your wife. Liberty's her daughter. I think that that makes her family.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you were once in love with her. That makes it complicated.",
        "Parker: Okay. Well, I'm not trying to get married to her again. I'm just trying to be a friend.",
        "Jack: You're sure that's all it is.",
        "Parker: I'm sure it is. Anyway, it doesn't seem like she's gonna show up here anytime soon. So I think I'm just gonna head out.",
        "Jack: Where are you headed?",
        "Parker: Rosanna wants me to get some new shoes, so I'm going to Old Town.",
        "Jack: She's right about that. Come on. I'll give you a life.",
        "Parker: Oh, no, no. I got my bike.",
        "Jack: I'll put your bike in the car.",
        "Parker: Is this you giving me a ride just for the sake of giving me a ride or are you trying to make sure I don't go looking for Liberty?",
        "Jack: This is getting to spend time with my son every chance I get. Aren't you lucky?",
        "Parker: Oh, I really believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Your mom's not gonna change her mind about this. Maybe we should give it a couple days, and we'll come up with another --",
        "Liberty: Teri, I can't wait, okay? I have to get this done now.",
        "Teri: Your pregnancy's not that far along.",
        "Liberty: I can't have this baby. I know that. But if I wait even a few more days, I don't know if I'll be strong enough to do it.",
        "Teri: I know, I know, I know, Sweetie. Here goes nothing.",
        "Janet: Let me guess, she is trying to get you to get me to change my mind.",
        "Teri: Pretty much, yeah.",
        "Janet: And I thought it would be a good thing having my little sister in town.",
        "Teri: It is a good thing, Jan.",
        "Janet: Not when you two are ganging up against me.",
        "Teri: Even if she's telling me stuff that she won't tell you?",
        "Janet: Is something going on with Liberty I should know about?",
        "Teri: Yes.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Teri: Holden Snyder died, and it's been really hard on you and Jack, and, you know, it's been hard on Liberty, too. She just needs to get away, Jan.",
        "Janet: Oh, gosh. Maybe that's why she's been feeling so sick lately, with everything that's been going on at home.",
        "Teri: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Janet: I should just take some time off and take her with me.",
        "Teri: Wait. But you can't get out of town right now, right?",
        "Janet: Well, it would be really hard to get somebody to replace me last- minute, and Jack and Emma, you know, they're still very shaky. It's just not a good time right now.",
        "Teri: Okay. Well, then let me take her, and I'll watch out for her.",
        "Janet: Are you sure?",
        "Teri: Totally, totally. I have the time off, and I'm glad to do it.",
        "Janet: So, this thing really has to be today?",
        "Liberty: Yes, Mom. She's looking at schools today. It's the only chance we're gonna get, and we're gonna maybe be roommates. So we want to check it out. Please.",
        "Janet: Okay. All right! You can go.",
        "Liberty: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Janet: But your Aunt Teresa is going with you, so you and Mackenzie have to keep her in the loop at all time, all right?",
        "Liberty: Of course.",
        "Janet: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Ray really believes that James was gonna pay back the $50,000 that I owe him, so now that he's got James in jail, that's his gravy train. He's not gonna get his money. So he's gonna have a meltdown, and he really believes he's gonna get stiffed.",
        "Henry: When did he say this?",
        "Audrey: When he came to my door, he told me that if I don't have his money in 48 hours, he's gonna kill me.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God! That's horrible! But how is Henry seeing James gonna change that?",
        "Audrey: Well, son, I just figured you could go talk to your father and just ask him for a little, tiny advance on your great big inheritance.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not gonna work.",
        "Audrey: Yes, it'll work. He would do it for you. You are his favorite son!",
        "Henry: It doesn't matter if he can't get to his money. The guy has committed a lot of crimes. They usually freeze the funds in that situation.",
        "Audrey: No. Not with James Stenbeck. He's very smart. He's probably got some cash tucked away somewhere. Please? Please, please, please, son? Help me! Do you really want to see your mommy dead?",
        "Henry: Well --",
        "Vienna: No! Of course not! You may have your issues with your mother, but she's still your mother.",
        "Henry: That's sad but true.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. And eventually you're gonna hand over all the money, so why don't you try to get her some right now so it will save her life?",
        "Henry: Okay. I'll do it for you.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Henry: All right, Mom. Let's go hit up the dying guy for a loan. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hello? Why, yes, it is. Interesting. I'll think about it.",
        "Emily: Who was that?",
        "Paul: That was James' lawyer.",
        "Emily: What did he want?",
        "Paul: James wants to have a meeting with me immediately.",
        "Emily: Well, to hell with that. You don't have to jump when he calls anymore.",
        "Paul: That's true.",
        "Emily: You're thinking about going to see him?",
        "Paul: Well, you know what? I don't think that I would mind seeing James today, of all days.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Paul: Well, obviously, he's read the newspaper.",
        "Emily: He's really mad.",
        "Paul: And he's going to demand a retraction, and I want to be there to deny him, to spit it back into his face. You coming?",
        "Emily: Oh, you better believe I'm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You said it was my son.",
        "Henry: I am your son.",
        "James: Oh, I was expecting Paul.",
        "Cop: I'll be right outside, if he tries anything.",
        "James: I was expecting Paul.",
        "Audrey: Why? I mean, why would that viper have the nerve to show up here after the way he treated you?",
        "James: What are you two doing here?",
        "Audrey: We just wanted to make sure you were all right, and we are both very, very concerned about you.",
        "James: Really? Really? What else?",
        "Audrey: Henry has something that he wants to ask you.",
        "James: Ask.",
        "Henry: I was wondering if you would consider possibly giving me an advance on my inheritance.",
        "James: Inheritance? I guess I did mention an inheritance, didn't I?",
        "Audrey: Yes, yes. And he certainly didn't want to disturb you. I mean, he knows you have so many other things on your mind.",
        "James: Yes, like incarceration and death.",
        "Audrey: Well, yeah. That. You know, but, the point is, I told him that your daddy would never want you to stand on ceremony and that you would provide every one of his needs.",
        "James: Really?",
        "Audrey: Yes, really, because, Jimmy, I know what kind of guy you are. You're very kind, considerate, and generous and giving.",
        "James: Right. Now, easy there, hot pants. I'm not dead yet, so stop spending my money as if I were.",
        "Audrey: I don't want you to think it's sounding like the money is more important than you, because it's not.",
        "Henry: Don't knock yourself out, Mom. He's gonna turn you down.",
        "Audrey: Unh-unh. He wouldn't.",
        "James: Yes, I would. Paul is now the sole Stenbeck heir.",
        "Audrey: Why?",
        "James: Paul has changed. I'm very, very proud of him. In fact, my lawyer's on his way back over here with the final draft of my will. Paul is now officially the sole Stenbeck heir.",
        "Audrey: Oh, Jimmy, I cannot believe you would do this. I mean, come on. Henry risked his freedom to keep you away from the police, and that other evil son of yours, he turned you in.",
        "James: Yes, but I'm very proud of him.",
        "Henry: You're proud of him for turning you in?",
        "James: Yes. I mean, Paul finally became a man. I mean, he suffered a lot getting there, but he got there. So he is the sole Stenbeck heir.",
        "Audrey: No. Come on. Are you forgetting how much we meant to each other? Are you forgetting everything I have to offer?",
        "Henry: Oh, please, God. Don't go there, Mother. Please, at least not while I'm in the room. Please, please.",
        "James: You know, Audrey, you're one hell of a woman, and our moments together were spectacular, but come on, let's face it, Darling, he's just an indiscretion.",
        "Audrey: You can't talk to -- to him like that. You can't talk like that to him. In my heart, he was always your son. I just didn't tell anybody. Now, he is your flesh and blood. That has got to be worth something.",
        "James: Flesh and blood. All right. You can use the Stenbeck name if you want.",
        "[Audrey sighs]",
        "Henry: Great. Thanks a lot. I think we're done here.",
        "Audrey: No! No, no, no! Wait! No! We can't just leave! I don't want to just leave!",
        "Henry: Let's go, Mom.",
        "Audrey: Jimmy!",
        "Audrey: What about Ray and the money?",
        "Paul: Did you get called in for a command visit, too?",
        "Audrey: Oh, don't you dare speak to him, you sneaky little money grabber!",
        "Henry: Mom, come on.",
        "Emily: Paul, what the hell was that all about?",
        "Paul: James brings out the best in everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Do you want some coffee?",
        "Jack: Why don't you tell me why you really didn't go, hmm?",
        "Janet: I just didn't.",
        "Jack: No. No, you didn't. You're worried about me, aren't you?",
        "Janet: And Emma.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: Because you two are always so independent, and lately you've needed me, and that's meant a lot to me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, to us, too, but I don't want you making sacrifices for my family.",
        "Janet: Our family, huh? Then, the more I thought about it, the more I felt like it would be good for Liberty to get away for a little while and spend some time on her own.",
        "Jack: I agree with you there. The farm has been kind of intense lately. Even Parker noticed that she's been more down than usual.",
        "Janet: So I made the right decision?",
        "Jack: Of course you made the right -- you always make the right decision. You married me, didn't you? Hmm?",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: So, you'll need to fill out these forms, and normally it could take a week to get an appointment.",
        "Liberty: A week?",
        "Nurse: But we've just had a cancellation, so we can get you in tomorrow.",
        "Liberty: I thought we were gonna be able to do this right away.",
        "Teri: Okay, it doesn't look like that's an option. What do you want to do? Do you want to have the procedure tomorrow?",
        "Liberty: I don't want to have this procedure at all.",
        "Craig: Liberty, if you're having second thoughts, that's okay. We'll do whatever you want.",
        "Liberty: I can't have a baby. I've seen what my mom had to go through having me so young. I can't do that to her. I can't do that to her.",
        "Teri: Okay, okay. We will schedule it for tomorrow then, okay?",
        "Liberty: What are we gonna tell my mom? It was hard enough getting her to let me come here today. She's not gonna let me come back tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Then I guess we spend the night in Chicago.",
        "Teri: Are you sure?",
        "Craig: I said I'll do whatever it takes, and I meant it.",
        "Liberty: Okay. What are we gonna tell her, because she's not --",
        "Teri: Don't worry. I will call Jan, and I'll tell her that we had to set up an interview at a college or something and we had to stay overnight.",
        "Craig: I'll book us some hotel rooms.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. I'm so glad my mom doesn't have to find out about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi, Jack. How you doing?",
        "Jack: Great, great. I ran in to Parker earlier. You're really doing a good job with those kids, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: That's so sweet of you to say.",
        "Jack: It's a fact, my dear.",
        "Rosanna: Well, thank you.",
        "Janet: So, what can I get you?",
        "Rosanna: I'm wondering if you have a slice of humble pie back there.",
        "Janet: Oh, oh. Is this about what we talked about?",
        "Rosanna: Teri and Craig, yeah.",
        "Jack: There's something going on between Teri and Craig?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I thought maybe there was, but now I think maybe I got the wrong impression.",
        "Jack: What gave you that impression?",
        "Rosanna: Well, Teri and Craig have been spending a lot of time alone together.",
        "Janet: At Metro. You know that she's gonna be the new head chef, and so they've been working on the design and renovations and everything.",
        "Rosanna: Right. So, I think maybe I jumped the gun, and I apologize, really. I hope you didn't say anything to Teri about what I said.",
        "Janet: I did not say anything. Don't worry about it. I knew there was nothing going on.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. As much as I hate to admit it, I think I might have misjudged Craig.",
        "Janet: What the --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: I better not be seeing who I think I'm seeing!",
        "Jack: Who's she seeing?",
        "Janet: Mackenzie!",
        "Mackenzie: Hi, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Janet: Why aren't you in Chicago?",
        "Mackenzie: Was I supposed to be?",
        "Janet: I thought you were going to look at colleges with your family.",
        "Mackenzie: Eventually, I guess, but probably not until later in the fall.",
        "Janet: The fall.",
        "Mackenzie: Mm-hmm. I was actually on my way to meet my mom.",
        "Janet: Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Bye.",
        "Mackenzie: Bye.",
        "Janet: She lied to me.",
        "Jack: Now, there's got to be a perfectly good explanation.",
        "Janet: Oh, there better be.",
        "Jack: All right. Why don't you give her a call?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I'm gonna call her, and I'm gonna find out why she lied and where the hell she is.",
        "Janet: You call me when you get this. Either she's out of range or she's not picking up.",
        "Jack: Where exactly was she headed?",
        "Janet: Teresa was taking them to Loyola or Northwestern.",
        "Rosanna: Do you think Teri was part of this deception?",
        "Janet: Why would my own sister help Liberty lie to me? I've got her phone number programmed in my phone.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm gonna call some of my buddies in Chicago, see if they can be some help.",
        "Janet: Thank you. Teresa, hi. It's Janet. Guess who I just ran in to in Oakdale? Mackenzie. Yeah, she was here. I thought you guys were all going to colleges together. Where are you? What -- call me back!",
        "Rosanna: Don't you think it's a little odd that Teri didn't pick up?",
        "Janet: Jack, you're taking me to Chicago. We're gonna go find Liberty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Wow. It was nice of Craig to do this for us, huh?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was.",
        "Teri: See, I think now we should call your mom and break the news that we're not coming back tonight.",
        "Liberty: She's so not gonna like that.",
        "Teri: I know.",
        "Liberty: What? What?",
        "Teri: My phone is totally dead, and I -- nope. I didn't pack my charger. Can we use your phone?",
        "Liberty: No. Can we just please not call her now? I'm tired.",

        "Teri: Hey.",
        "Craig: Hey. How's the room?",
        "Teri: It's great. How's yours?",
        "Craig: It's fine. You know, I had a thought. It's still early. Why don't we take a tour of some of the better restaurant kitchens in town? You might get some ideas for Metro.",
        "Teri: That would be wonderful. Oh, my gosh. Lib, doesn't that sound like fun?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I think I might just stay here and take a nap, if that's cool with you guys.",
        "Craig: How do you feel? Can we bring you anything?",
        "Liberty: No. I'm really grateful for what you guys are doing, but I kind of need some time alone.",
        "Teri: Okay, okay. That's understandable. Well, you get some rest, and we'll bring you back some food, okay?",
        "Liberty: Thanks. Thank you, Aunt Teri, and thanks, Craig.",
        "Craig: Feel better.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",

        "Liberty: Bye. Three missed calls?",
        "Janet: Liberty, it's me. Why haven't you called me back? Where are you? I know you're not with Mac. I just saw her. And I can't get a hold of Teresa. This is crazy. We're coming to Chicago to find you.",

        "James: Emily, you were not invited here.",
        "Paul: You can say what you want to say in front of Emily or not at all. It doesn't matter to me.",
        "James: Oh, I think it's gonna matter a lot to you, Paul, because, you see, I've changed my will. You're not the sole Stenbeck heir.",
        "Paul: No, thank you.",
        "James: It's not a choice, Paul. It's done.",
        "Paul: Well, undo it.",
        "James: It's too late. My lawyer's on his way back here right now. It'll all be official by the end of the day.",
        "Paul: Why? Why would you do something like that?",
        "James: Because I'm very proud of you. Very proud of the action you've taken these past few days.",
        "Paul: I've turned you in.",
        "James: I know. That shows you've become a man, Paul. You're a Stenbeck, and the money's yours.",
        "Emily: He doesn't want it.",
        "Paul: No. You know what? I do. I do want it.",
        "Emily: You do?",
        "Paul: Yes, of course, because I'm gonna give away every bloody cent.",
        "James: Oh, no. I doubt that. Money's power, and once you have it, you won't be so quick to give it a way.",
        "Paul: Don't bet on it.",
        "James: You're a Stenbeck. You're my heir. And you'll never be allowed to forget that.",

        "Audrey: He has not signed the will yet.",
        "Henry: So what? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna break his fingers so he can't sign it?",
        "Audrey: Well, he said he was waiting on the final draft. We just have to make sure he does not get it.",
        "Henry: How you gonna do that? Who are you calling?",
        "Audrey: Hey. Hello, Mr. Hansen. Yes, hi. It's Audrey Coleman. Do you remember me? Oh, you darling, charming man. Yes. Listen, I am in need of immediate, serious legal advice. It's a matter of life and death.",
        "Henry: Isn't it always?",
        "Audrey: So, I was wondering, could you meet me right away here at the Lakeview? I'm in Room 1011. That is perfect. See you soon. He's coming. Jimmy's lawyer's coming here.",
        "Henry: That's great. What then?",
        "Audrey: I'll figure it out.",

        "Audrey: It's Ray! It's Ray! He's come to kill me!",
        "Henry: No, no! Wait! Mom, he said he'd give you 48 hours.",
        "Audrey: Well, then, he lied! He's a loan shark. What do you expect?",
        "Henry: Right. You need to hide. Okay. I'll try to get rid of him.",
        "Audrey: Okay. What if you can't?",
        "Henry: Then we're both dead. Just hide. Just hide.",
        "Audrey: Okay, okay. Go, go, go.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Vienna: Finally. What took you so long?",
        "Henry: Raging paranoia. It's a specialty of my mother's.",
        "Audrey: Oh, you were scared, too. Hi. Vienna, hi. How are you?",
        "Vienna: So, how did it go with James? Did you convince him to give you the money?",
        "Henry: Not exactly.",
        "Audrey: Oh, but we are definitely working on it. Oh, did you hear that? I am starving. I'm so hungry. We didn't have lunch. Do you want to go get a table, and I'm just gonna freshen up a bit? Meet you down there.",
        "Vienna: No, no. We can wait, so we can all go together.",
        "Audrey: Oh, no. I insist. Please, go get a table. Two minutes, two minutes. It won't take that long.",

        "Liberty: Hi, Mom.",
        "Janet: Where have you been? Jack and I were just on our way to Chicago to come find you.",
        "Liberty: No, no, no. Don't go to Chicago, 'cause I'm not there.",
        "Janet: Where are you, then?",
        "Liberty: I'm on my way home.",
        "Janet: Well, is Aunt Teresa with you?",
        "Liberty: No.",

        "Emily: It doesn't matter what he says. He's never gonna be able to do that to you again.",
        "Paul: Why not, because he's dying? It hasn't stopped him before. He still messes with my head. He put a microchip in it.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and you know what? Since then it made you a different person. It made you a better person. You are free of James, everything he represents.",
        "Paul: You sure about that?",
        "Emily: I am. I am sure. I believe in you, and if you get that money, it means he's dead. Isn't that a good thing?",
        "Paul: Aah! I can't stop thinking that maybe this inheritance is some kind of a curse, and I just wish to hell it would go to somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Okay, quick. Tell me exactly what James said before Audrey gets down here.",
        "Henry: You know, the typical \"I'm Stenbeck, the all powerful, blah, blah, blah.\"",

        "Henry: She thinks she is.",

        "Vienna: We're waiting for one more person.",
        "Waitress: Perhaps you'd like to wait at the bar until your party is complete?",
        "Vienna: Perhaps you should go and get me a glass of champagne and a martini for my Henry. Thank you. I hate it when they get so pushy.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, you know, I hate it, too. I'm gonna go upstairs and see what's keeping my mother. No, I'll be right back.",

        "Mr. Hansen: I don't usually drink when I'm on a business call.",
        "Audrey: Oh, I'm sure, but, please, I insist. Please. You know, I have such a delicate, delicate matter to discuss with you. I need a little liquid courage before I can divulge all. You know, and it's really rude for a lady to have to drink alone. Cin cin. Mmm. Mnh-mnh! You know what? I feel the need for one more sip, and then I'm sure I can tell you everything that's wrong. Please.",
        "Mr. Hansen: I am obviously not used to this.",

        "Henry: Oh, my God. Mother, you killed the lawyer?",
        "Audrey: No, I didn't kill him! He's just doped up, and now I need you to find a place for me to hide him before he wakes up.",

        "Teri: Libby, we're back.",
        "Craig: Where is she?",
        "Teri: I don't know. Maybe she went for a walk or something.",
        "Craig: You want to call her?",
        "Teri: Maybe we should give her a few minutes.",
        "Craig: Well, wherever she is, she better hurry up, because this food smells delicious.",
        "Teri: I know. We hit, like, three four-star restaurants in under an hour. That's got to be record-breaking.",
        "Craig: And all it took was a fast car and a really large credit card. Tell you what, why don't we set all the food out. If Liberty sees it, she might get an appetite.",
        "Teri: That's so thoughtful.",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah. Speaking of, for the adults, a little something extra.",
        "Teri: You're not just thoughtful. You're brilliant. Mmm! This is so good! You have to try it.",
        "Craig: Thanks. I prefer the total experience. You know, knife, fork, plate.",

        "Liberty: I'm totally fine. I'm fine, really.",
        "Janet: Where have you been?",
        "Liberty: I completely misunderstood Mac. She ended up not doing the college thing, so I didn't go, either.",
        "Janet: Why didn't you call me?",
        "Liberty: Because I really needed, like, time to myself, you know, and you got so mad about me being gone for one lousy day. I just didn't want to get in to it, and I needed space.",
        "Janet: What? You needed space? Honey, we live on a farm! There are, like, a million acres out there! If you needed space, all you have to do is walk outside!",
        "Jack: Janet, Janet. Calm down.",
        "Liberty: Everyone's been so sad, too. I just couldn't handle it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. I know it's been intense around here, Liberty, but, still, you should have called your mother.",
        "Liberty: I know. I know. Mom, I didn't mean to make you worry. Really sorry.",
        "Janet: What about Teresa? Did she know about this?",

        "Vienna: Well, I was wondering what was taking so long. What's going on?",
        "Henry: Why don't you tell her?",
        "Audrey: Okay. It's Boris. Boris is an old, old boyfriend of mine. He just came by, drunk as a skunk, and he just passed right out.",
        "Vienna: Okay. So, what are you gonna do with him?",
        "Henry: We're gonna put him in a cab and send him home, and it's only gonna take a minute. Why you don't just wait back down in the lounge?",
        "Vienna: No. You know what? I'm tired of getting that attitude from the waiter. I'm gonna go to the room and order room service.",
        "Henry: Oh. Would you, Sweetie? Would you get me a cheeseburger and a pitcher of martinis?",
        "Vienna: Yes, I will.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Time to go back to your cell.",
        "James: No, no, no. I can't, I can't. I got to wait here. My lawyer's supposed to be on his way here with a document. I've got to wait for him.",
        "Cop: Too bad. Let's go.",
        "James: Lawyers. Can't trust them, can't kill them.",

        "Audrey: Okay, okay.",
        "Henry: Where?",
        "Audrey: Here, here, here, here, here! Put him down. Put him down. Careful. Ow! Ow! Okay. Look, look, look. I have rope. We can tie him up. Here.",
        "Henry: Do you always carry rope around in your purse?",
        "Audrey: Well, you know, a girl's got to be prepared!",
        "Mr. Hansen: Cheeseburger.",
        "Audrey: Oh!",
        "Henry: He's not gonna stay unconscious forever, Mom.",
        "Audrey: Right, right, right. I brought something to gag him.",
        "Henry: Those are panties!",
        "Audrey: Well, they're clean! He has to have something in his mouth!",
        "Henry: I demand that you stop talking!",
        "Audrey: Okay. All right. All right. Here it is.",
        "Henry: The will?",
        "Audrey: The will! That dirty, rotten creep! He really was gonna cut you out. Well, he is not gonna have a chance. As long as James dies before he signs this, you, my son, are going to inherit the entire Stenbeck fortune.",

        "Emily: When I moved back in, I knew that we would laugh a lot, talk a lot.",
        "Paul: Have a lot of sex.",
        "Emily: Well, swinging from the chandeliers, baby.",
        "Paul: Let me ask you something. I mean, all of this with my father's cursed money, is that some kind of a turn-on for you?",
        "Emily: It's not about the money. Paul, I got to be there for you. I got to help you through it. You know how long I've waited for that? Sorry. Girly moment. You know what? What do you say we go find that chandelier?",
        "Paul: Tell me I'm nothing like him.",
        "Emily: When I look into your eyes, I see you, Paul, not James, but you have to look in your own heart and know that James is not there. He never will be there.",
        "Paul: Maybe you could remind me every once in a while.",
        "Emily: As long as I'm around, I will.",
        "Paul: Well, stick around, and you can tell me every day, forever.",
        "Emily: What are you saying?",
        "Paul: Marry me.",

        "Liberty: Mom, Teri didn't know where I was going. She just knew that I was not going to Chicago.",
        "Janet: Well, then, why didn't she call me and tell me that?",
        "Liberty: Because I promised her that I was going to tell you, and I was going to. I just forgot. I flaked.",
        "Janet: Where have you been?",
        "Liberty: Mom, I've been hanging out by myself.",
        "Janet: Where?",
        "Jack: Liberty, you've given your mother a lot of excuses about why you didn't call. All she needs to know is where you were. So, where were you?",
        "Parker: She was with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: It says here \"Jan called.\" Liberty must have panicked and hopped on the first bus home.",
        "Craig: Which means we're right back where we started. Poor kid's still pregnant.",
        "Teri: Yeah. Looks like there's another secret trip to Chicago in my future. How about you?",
        "Craig: I'll help Liberty any way I can. But I had to say some less-than-honest things to get here in the first place. I don't relish the thought of doing that again.",
        "Teri: I know. I hated lying to my sister. God only knows what Liberty is telling Jan right now. I really don't want her to hate me over this.",
        "Craig: That might be unavoidable. Janet finds out you took her daughter to an abortion clinic and kept it from her, she's gonna be angry.",
        "Teri: I know. She is gonna kill me. But Liberty, she was so sad and alone. I couldn't turn my back on her.",

        "Jack: See, I thought Parker and Liberty were over.",
        "Janet: You don't think they are.",
        "Jack: You think they're sleeping together again?",
        "Janet: I don't know. God, I hope not!",
        "Craig: Why didn't I say this before? You're obsessed with the idea of everyone and else having hot, steamy sex because you're not getting any."
