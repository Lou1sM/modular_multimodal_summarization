        "Dusty: All you ever cared about is money, Dom. When did you become such an expert on love?",
        "Dominic: No, no, an expert on people. You're not her type, man, you know.",
        "Dusty: What are you talkin' about? She's got great taste.",
        "Dominic: That girl's country club. You're fight club.",
        "Dusty: Not anymore.",
        "Dominic: You got my number?",
        "Dusty: Yep.",
        "Dominic: Call me if you change your mind about my business proposition.",
        "Dusty: I'm not gonna change my mind. I don't want to get into boxing. It's too risky.",
        "Dominic: You want to win big, you gotta risk big, isn't that what they say? How long you think she's gonna like the smell of this place?",
        "Dusty: You gotta go now.",
        "Dominic: I'm just sayin', this is just no life for a lady. Old Dom -- I'll show her the right spots.",
        "Dusty: You go near her, and you're gonna be eating through a straw.",
        "Dominic: Touchy. Take it easy, Dusty, huh?",
        "Lucy: You know the most interesting people.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we used to do business together.",
        "Lucy: He doesn't look like your broker. I missed you.",
        "Dusty: Me, too. I'm sorry, I gotta stay here and run this place.",
        "Lucy: I can think of a lot of other things we could be doing.",
        "Dusty: Me, too. But I've gotta wait for my suppliers.",
        "Lucy: Well, I can just hang out here and enjoy the view. I even brought a book.",
        "Dusty: Oh, good for you. What are you reading?",
        "Lucy: \"The Long, Hot Summer.\"",

        "Parker: You mean it, Mom? We can go back to the Water Park?!",
        "Carly: No, Mike and I are gonna go. I need for you to stay here and help the sitter in case Sage wakes up, okay?",
        "Parker: But you'll call, right? As soon as you find Jack?",
        "Carly: Now I mean it. You go to bed when you're told, and you don't give Mrs. Perrini a hard time. That is, if I can even get her at such short notice.",
        "Parker: I promise I'll help, Mom. Thanks.",
        "Carly: Sweety. I'll call the sitter, okay?",
        "Mike: You're really going back to that Water Park?",
        "Carly: It's important to him, Mike.",
        "Mike: Okay, I get that, but it has been a brutal day for both of you. What do you think you'll accomplish?",
        "Carly: Honestly, I don't know.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry, Carly; I care too much about you and your family to let you drag yourself through that park again tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "JJ: Mom, can I wait outside for Kayley?",
        "Julia: Huh, what, honey?",
        "JJ: I changed my shirt.",
        "Julia: Yeah, you need your shoes.",
        "JJ: Why?",
        "Julia: Because I said so.",
        "JJ: I know. Where are they?",
        "Julia: I don't know, maybe your room.",

        "Hal: You all right? Everybody all right?",
        "Nurse: I think so.",
        "Barbara: Tell your men to drop their guns, Hal, or I'll use mine. I think you know now I'm serious.",
        "Hal: All right, drop your weapons. What are you doing, Barbara? You're not gonna shoot anybody.",
        "Barbara: You stay back, Hal! I want my son! And I want him now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, Mike, I don't remember asking you for your permission.",
        "Mike: Oh, I didn't mean it that way. But look at the message you're sending to Parker. It's like you're saying you believe Jack's alive, too. Do you?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Mike: You have to know. You have to help him accept the truth.",
        "Carly: Parker, he believes it in his bones, Mike. When he looks into my eyes and tells me that he saw Jack at that Water Park, it's -- it's almost impossible not to believe that there's something to it.",
        "Mike: Which is why you thought you saw him today, too. And you turned out to be wrong. Parker is wrong.",
        "Carly: Maybe he is, all I know is that something very weird is happening. And if I don't go back to that park and look for whatever clue there might be, I will regret it for the rest of my life. Jack never gave up on me. He never gave up on this family and if I just attribute all of this to Parker's grief, then it's like I'm the one who's giving up. And I cannot do that to my husband or to my child. I am going back to that park.",
        "Mike: All right, okay, fine, go, but I'll be damned if you're going to go alone.",

        "Worker: Might as well trash 'em now, it's starting to rain.",

        "Julia: Oh, Jack --",
        "Jack: Let me, let me finish. I -- I owe you an apology.",
        "Julia: For what?",
        "Jack: For wanting to kiss you.",
        "Julia: Did you see me complaining?",
        "Jack: No, it's just -- Julie, you've done so much for me. You fed, you've opened your house to me, you've helped me try to find out who I am. And I repaid you by hitting on you.",
        "Julia: You didn't hit on me. It just happened. No one should have to apologize.",
        "Jack: You're an incredible woman. And I'm -- I don't know what I am. I have no history, no job -- no prospects. You deserve to be with a guy who at least has a last name.",
        "Julia: Hey, you know what? I know people who have last names that aren't half the man you are.",
        "Jack: You have no idea what kind of man I am.",
        "Julia: Yes, I do. I know how you've treated me. I know how you've treated JJ. You know what I know? Whoever you are, where ever you're from -- somewhere out there -- and there are people who really love you.",
        "Jack: If that were true, where are they? Listen, bottom line is, that the only life I have is right here and right now. And because it's the only life I have, I'm afraid that I'm gonna ask too much, or expect too much. I don't want to put that kind of pressure on you.",
        "Julia: You're not.",
        "Jack: The trouble is, knowing you and being in this place -- it just feels good.",
        "Julia: Yeah, it does. I'm gonna go help JJ find his shoes, and when I get back down, we'll hit the computer and we'll start finding some things out.",
        "Jack: Yeah -- not tonight.",
        "Julia: Why?",
        "Jack: Because I don't think I can sit by you without -- I'm gonna go take a walk. I won't be long. Tell JJ, I'll be right back.",

        "Emily: How did you find us?",
        "Margo: Barbara called Hal and told him that she had you here. And the place was wired to blow.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Margo: No, I'm sorry, there's no bomb. There's no bomb. It's fine.",
        "Emily: Well, where's Hal?",
        "Margo: He's at the state hospital making sure she doesn't get Will.",
        "Emily: He knew I was here and he didn't -- he didn't --",
        "Margo: Well, I think it's a good thing he sent me instead under the circumstances, don't you think?",
        "Chris: Margo.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on. Don't even say it.",
        "Chris: But don't say what?",
        "Margo: \"Margo, this is not what you think.\"",
        "Emily: How dare you stand there and judge me?",
        "Margo: I am not passing judgments, but I'm not going to stand here and deny that I saw what I saw.",
        "Chris: Look, what you saw is two people who are afraid that they were never going to get out of here alive.",
        "Alison: Chris! Chris, Chris, thank God you're all right! Did she hurt you?",
        "Chris: We're fine.",
        "Alison: I was so scared that I'd lost you both.",
        "Emily: Honey, we're okay. I'm okay.",
        "Chris: How did you know that we were here?",
        "Alison: I overheard the cops. They said that Barbara was in this boathouse.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, so we raced over.",
        "Chris: For all you knew, there was still a bomb here!",
        "Alison: I don't care. I had to see you.",
        "Chris: Okay, look, thank you. I need some air.",
        "Alison: No, you have to promise to me that you'll never do this to me ever again. And from now on, I'm not letting you out of my sight.",
        "Margo: I mean it, Emily. I'm not going to forget what I just saw.",
        "Emily: Oh, this is rich. You think you have the right to stand there and lecture me after what you did to Tom? Yeah, it's a small town Margo, remember I run a scandal sheet. You think I wasn't going to find out about you and Doc Reese?",
        "Margo: Emily, I'm Hal's friend. And I'm yours, too, if you'll let me be. I know that you don't want to hear what I'm about to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway.",
        "Chris: Barbara wanted two things -- Emily's car and Hal's gun. Unfortunately, we walked in on her and she made us go with her.",
        "Alison: Well, that woman needs to be locked up.",
        "Chris: Truth is, Alison, I don't think she wanted to hurt us.",
        "Aaron: Why were you at Emily's anyway?",
        "Chris: Dropping off food -- leftovers from the shower.",
        "Alison: Oh, great. So, you have me to thank for all of this insanity.",
        "Chris: Alison, it is so not your fault. Okay? And its better that I was there. That way, that she didn't get stuck with Barbara alone.",
        "Alison: No, you're right. The last time that happened, she got whacked over the head -- wait, wait hold on. What is that?",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Alison: You have -- is that lipstick? No, no --",
        "Chris: Yeah -- well, look it must be Emily's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You get me my son or I start picking off pretty little nurses and flat-footed cops.",
        "Hal: You're not killing anyone.",
        "Barbara: Where is he?",
        "Hal: Just calm down and put the gun away, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Where?",
        "Nurse: He's in the maximum security wing.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Hal: He's under heavy guard, Barbara. You'll never get to him.",
        "Barbara: I got to you. I'll get to him.",
        "Hal: Well, you'll have to kill me first. How do you feel about that?",
        "Barbara: Come on, Hal, you know how much I love Will. I don't know why I do the things I do, I don't know what comes over me. But just the thought of never seeing him again, I can't take it.",
        "Hal: Put the gun down, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I've lost it, haven't I? I've lost my chance to have him with me? I've ruined it, haven't I?",
        "Hal: Maybe not. Maybe not, you know we could talk about it. We could talk about it, maybe we could figure something out. Maybe we could.",
        "Barbara: Do you mean it?",
        "Hal: I mean it. Come on.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, all of you outside! Move! Move, go! Hi. Hi.",

        "Lucy: You need some help?",
        "Dusty: Help from you?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, why not me? You don't think I can wipe down a bar?",
        "Dusty: I think you can do anything. And you know that.",
        "Lucy: Then why not let me do some waitressing?",
        "Dusty: Because it doesn't work for you.",
        "Lucy: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you just take it as a compliment? 'Cause it is one.",
        "Lucy: It doesn't sound like one.",
        "Dusty: I don't want my girl being harassed by a bunch of drunk people, you know?",
        "Lucy: I'm your girl now, huh?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're my girl.",
        "Lucy: But you still think I'm too good to work where you work?",
        "Dusty: No, I think you didn't go to prep-school to become a bar back.",
        "Lucy: Oh, too rich, too pampered, too what exactly?",
        "Dusty: Too -- you're different. Like no one else. Are you arguing with me?",
        "Lucy: No, I'm not arguing.",
        "Dusty: Are you sure?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm. You know why I'm here? Because you are. If you were working at the country club, then I would be there. And if you in a cardboard box on the street, then I would pulling up there.",
        "Dusty: No, you would not. I wouldn't let you.",
        "Lucy: You wouldn't have a choice.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to make you go to college one of these days. You know that, right?",
        "Lucy: Not today. You know, having a certain upbringing that we keep talking about. That doesn't mean anything if you don't feel loved.",
        "Dusty: Is that what I do for you? Do I make you feel loved?",
        "Lucy: You couldn't tell when we were at your place?",
        "Dusty: Our place.",
        "Lucy: I like that.",
        "Dusty: You trying to get me shut down?",
        "Lucy: Maybe.",
        "Dusty: Would you do me a favor?",
        "Lucy: Anything.",
        "Dusty: Would you go back to the Lakeview for me and get my key in my dresser? It's still in the safe, I forgot it. I'll finish up here.",
        "Lucy: Sure. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Excuse me, we're looking for this man. Did you see him in the park today?",
        "Woman: No, he doesn't look familiar. I don't think so.",
        "Carly: Just look again. All right, take your time. This is very important.",
        "Man: The park was really crowded.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry, he just doesn't look familiar.",
        "Mike: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Well, let's check inside.",
        "Worker #1: Park's closing, folks.",
        "Carly: Oh, this man might've been here today. Did you happen to see him? Have you been here all afternoon?",
        "Worker #1: Yeah, I take souvenir pictures, that's my job.",
        "Mike: Maybe you his picture.",
        "Worker #1: Look, I take hundreds of pictures a day so I --",
        "Mike: Would it still be here?",
        "Worker #1: If he didn't buy it.",
        "Carly: What do you do with the pictures that no one buys?",
        "Worker #1: They pick up the trash yet?",
        "Worker #2: No, the can's right there by the booth.",
        "Carly: There's so many.",
        "Mike: You know, this is a long shot, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't care. Just keep looking.",
        "Mike: Some of them are destroyed. The rain must have gotten to them.",
        "Worker #2: Sorry, folks, the park's closing.",
        "Carly: We're looking for somebody. Very important. It will be just another minute. Okay?",
        "Mike: We're almost done.",
        "Carly: Just a couple of seconds. We're just looking for a picture of some -- oh, my God, oh my God, Mike, it's him -- its Jack.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lucy: This has been the most perfect day.",
        "Dusty: It's not over yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: When Jack finds the picture with the note on the back, he'll come home.",
        "Carly: You mean the note you put in the bottle?",
        "Parker: He'll find it in the river soon. I know he will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Let me see. Carly, you can't even make out the face.",
        "Carly: Is there a negative?",
        "Worker #2: No, sorry.",
        "Mike: I don't know how we prove this is Jack. Do you recognize the clothes?",
        "Carly: No, but Parker said he was wearing a light blue shirt.",
        "Worker #2: Five bucks for the shot or it's time to go.",
        "Mike: All right, hold on a second, okay? Look, there could have been hundreds of men here today with that same build. It's just not enough to go on.",
        "Carly: I'll buy it! Here. Here, maybe it's not Jack, but there's something -- there's something about it. I can't give it up, Mike. I can't throw it away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You keep telling me that you you're not going to forget what you saw. That sounds like a threat to me.",
        "Margo: Well, it's not. I'm not going to run out and tell the world what I saw, all right? Stop worrying.",
        "Emily: Okay. Well, then don't you worry either, because I know what's at stake here, I know.",
        "Margo: Do you really? 'Cause boy, I thought I did and the whole world blew up in my face.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not you. I'm sorry, this is my life and --",
        "Margo: No, no, it's not just your life! It's Danny's life, too. And he loves Hal. Hal is just as much a father to him as Tom is. You've got this great family.",
        "Emily: Is this your way of not lecturing me? 'Cause --",
        "Margo: My family, I ripped it apart. I saw what I did to my son. Don't do that to Danny, he's just too little to understand.",
        "Emily: There's nothing to understand. Okay, it was a very intense situation and things got a little out of control. That's okay. That's it. It's never going to happen again.",
        "Margo: All right, I know that sometimes you feel lonely and I know that sometimes you feel that you're taken for granted. And sometimes you have no idea why you fell in love with the man you fell in love with. Hal is stressed. I see that. I'm sure he's not a load of laughs to come home to. He's such a good man. He adores you, Emily --",
        "Emily: I know he does! Okay? I'm not risking my marriage here.",
        "Margo: I think you're lying to yourself. I think that Chris is, too. And I think that when you add Alison into that mix -- she's your own sister. I mean, don't you see it's the domino effect? Everything in your life will slowly start to fall apart. It's not worth it. That's all I'm saying.",
        "Chris: Barbara tied us up facing each other. Okay, so when we were struggling to get free, Emily's face bumped against mine.",
        "Alison: All the way over here, I kept thinking, what if Barbara killed you? What if I never saw you again? What if I never saw my sister again? I don't know what I would do.",
        "Chris: It's over, Ali, okay? And we are both fine.",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Alison: Oh, Em, Chris was just telling me what Barbara did to you. Are you okay?",
        "Emily: I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. Barbara's the psycho, we're lucky she didn't shoot us.",
        "Aaron: You know, seems kind of weird how Barbara would just you know, tie you two up and just leave.",
        "Margo: Well, they were a decoy. She's really after Will. She was just hoping to lure Hal down here and throw him off the trail. But fortunately, he sees through things like that.",
        "Aaron: So after Barbara left, you two were tied up for a long time?",
        "Chris: What are you trying to say?",
        "Aaron: No, nothing. Just that you're lucky. You know, that nothing else happened.",
        "Emily: Well, a lot of things happened. And I think you should hear the whole story. Especially you, Ali.",

        "Barbara: Okay, get out. Will! Will, its Mom! Will! Hi, my son is in this unit. His name is Will Munson. Do you know where he is?",
        "Old man: I don't know anything.",
        "Barbara: Will, Will! Will! Honey, where you are? Hi, my son, Will Munson, is in here.",

        "Barbara: Do you know where he is?",
        "Girl: Will's nice.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Will! Come on, Will, we don't have a lot of time! Please answer me, Will! Where are you, honey? Will? Will! Oh, sweetheart, I found you. I'm going to get you out here. And we're going to be together. I promise you, nothing's gonna keep us apart ever again.",

        "Dusty: Of course. What do you think?",
        "Lucy: I think I should have just stayed home so you could concentrate on work.",
        "Dusty: It wouldn't have mattered, because I see you everywhere. Whether you're here or not.",

        "Mike: Are you sure?",
        "Carly: Just tell me what you think when you look at this picture. And be honest.",
        "Mike: Okay. I think it's a coincidence. I think that the guy has the same kind of build as Jack. I think he happens to be standing a certain way, and all you can hear in your head is Parker saying that he was there today. So you fill in the blanks the way that you want them to be. But it's not Jack. It can't be, because if it was, you and Parker would be in that picture, too.",
        "Carly: But it's not impossible.",
        "Mike: No, nothing's impossible, but you have to be careful. These aren't just your hopes on the line, they're Parker's, too.",
        "Carly: You think I should get rid of this?",
        "Mike: I can't tell you what to do. Give yourself some time.",

        "Mike: Carly, I'm your friend and I love you. But if I see you pushing this to a place that's not good for you and the kids, then I am going to say something.",
        "Carly: Deal. Now if you're really my friend, you'll get the hell out of here so I can get some sleep.",
        "Mike: Sure you don't want me to camp out down here tonight?",
        "Carly: No. You've already done your good deed for the day -- your good deeds for the year, I think, but who's counting?",
        "Mike: Good night. All right, call me if you need anything.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I will.",
        "Mike: Don't get up. I'll let myself out.",

        "Carly: I guess he did.",
        "Parker: I did see him today. Do you still believe me?",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, I will always believe you. Now, you have to believe me when I tell you that it's time to sleep. Now, go upstairs to your bed and I'll be up to tuck you in. Okay?",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. Hey, I love you, heart and soul.",
        "Parker: Heart and soul, Mom. Night.",

        "Kayley: No, but it's a big night at Costello's. The parking lot's full. It's open mic night, I think.",
