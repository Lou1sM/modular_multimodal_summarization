        "Paul: Normal procedure, a guy asks you to marry him, you say yes or no.",
        "Emily: I'm touched. And I -- I'm flattered.",
        "Paul: Aww!",
        "Emily: No, it's not \"Aww.\" It's not -- it's not that. It's just that I -- I had no idea that you had marriage on your mind and that you actually wanted to spend --",
        "Paul: That I want to spend the rest of my life with you?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You didn't know?",
        "Emily: No, I didn't. And now I don't know what to say.",
        "Paul: Say yes.",
        "Emily: Why? I mean, why now? Why now, all of the sudden?",
        "Paul: There's a -- there's a dividing line in my life before and after I lost my memory, okay? And after I got my memory back, I have to ask myself why I didn't go back to being the same selfish jerk that I used to be. And the only thing I can come up with is because of you.",
        "Emily: No. I mean, maybe you just don't want to be that guy anymore.",
        "Paul: You -- you make me stronger. Without you, I would have caved in when James dangled that millions in front of me, and he would have been pulling my strings in no time at all.",
        "Emily: No, I doubt that.",
        "Paul: I don't want to talk about this. Look -- will you marry me?",
        "Emily: Oh, Paul. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You see, Teri, Craig here assured me that my suspicions were simply a product of my, uh, paranoid imagination. Is that it? But this looks very real to me. Explain it to me, Craig. You're not in New York, and you're clearly not alone.",
        "Teri: Listen, please do not be mad at Craig.",
        "Rosanna: I am not mad at Craig. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed in both of you, you especially. You said that you needed time off to hang out with Liberty, to look at colleges. I wouldn't give you that extra time off if I had known you were coming to Chicago to have a tryst with my sister's fianc\u00e9!",
        "Craig: It's not a tryst.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it's not a tryst? Really? What is this? What is this, a -- a yoga retreat? Did this help you find your Kundalini baby?",
        "Craig: There's no need for sarcasm.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not being sarcastic. I'm just waiting for an explanation. So why don't you tell me, Craig? What are the two of you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So you and Liberty were together?",
        "Parker: Uh-huh.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. We, uh -- we drove down to the lake with a bunch of kids to hang out.",
        "Janet: Why would you have to lie to me about that?",
        "Liberty: I thought you would disapprove.",
        "Janet: Of what? What exactly were you doing at the lake?",
        "Parker: Nothing. We were just talking about school and stuff.",
        "Janet: Where's your swimsuit?",
        "Liberty: I didn't go in the water, Mom.",
        "Janet: Well, why didn't you answer your cell phone when I called you?",
        "Liberty: I didn't hear it! I'm sorry, okay?",
        "Janet: You should be sorry! You scared me half to death! What has gotten into you?",
        "Parker: We're sorry. We -- we didn't want to say anything because we -- we thought you guys would be disappointed in us. I mean, we're supposed to be grieving Holden's death.",
        "Jack: So you snuck out, and you lied about it to spare our feelings? Is that it?",
        "Liberty: Yes.",
        "Parker: Basically.",
        "Jack: Oh. That's -- that's so nice. Unfortunately, I don't believe you. You, outside, now. We're gonna have a little chat-chat.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. You're not going anywhere. We're not done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Teri and I came to Chicago to scout restaurants.",
        "Teri: Yeah. Craig -- Craig got us into some of the best kitchens in the city. I -- I spoke to all of these chefs, these guys that I'd studied their dishes since school. And now they gave me pointers on how to set up Metro's new kitchen, and they sent me home with all this great food to try.",
        "Rosanna: Which you decided to sample in the hotel room you're clearly sharing?",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Wrong again. My room isn't even on this floor. Oh, look. What have we here? Evidence. If it makes you happy, we could play match the menu with the restaurant containers.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you really must think that I'm some kind of idiot.",
        "Teri: Why don't you believe us?",
        "Rosanna: Because you both told me separate and very elaborate lies, which you wouldn't have bothered to do if you were harmlessly visiting restaurants.",
        "Teri: I have every right to be with Craig if I want to. You're my boss. You're not my mom, and you're not my priest.",
        "Rosanna: Wow. Thank God for that.",
        "Craig: Oh, you know what? Just don't take it personally. Rosanna gets this way sometimes.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, give me a break, Craig. You're just upset because I am clearly and rather inconveniently for you not blind.",
        "Craig: Okay. You did it. You broke me. We lied. But we did it for a good reason.",
        "Rosanna: I'm waiting. What was so top-secret you couldn't possibly tell me?",
        "Craig: Teri and I came up here to check out restaurants, as I said.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Craig: But that's not the only reason we came.",
        "Rosanna: What was the other reason?",
        "Craig: All I can tell you is it's not what you think, and there's a perfectly innocent explanation.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: If it's so innocent, why can't you just tell me?",
        "Craig: Because it's not my secret to share.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, give me a break. Teri, do you have anything to add to this?",
        "Teri: No. Craig pretty much covered it.",
        "Rosanna: He didn't say anything.",
        "Teri: Because it has nothing to do with you! Craig told you the truth. There's nothing dirty going on. I'm not sneaking around behind your back.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, you are. You are both sneaking around behind my back, and more importantly my sister's.",
        "Teri: We're not having sex! Craig is my boss! Besides, he's way too much of a gentleman to take advantage of that.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Spare me. My God. Is this the reason that you're here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry, Mom. Things have just been really messed up lately, and I feel like there's just a lot of stuff spinning around in my head. I feel crazy. And I'm just -- I mean, Parker just gave me an escape from that for a little while.",
        "Janet: What kind of stuff?",
        "Liberty: Mom --",
        "Janet: Honey, that's right. I'm your mommy. Tell me.",
        "Liberty: I'm just -- I'm very -- I'm worried -- I've been worried about school.",
        "Janet: Why, Sweetheart? You practically got straight A's last term.",
        "Liberty: \"Practically\" isn't good enough, Mother. I want to go to college, and I'm scared something might mess it up.",
        "Janet: Is it the money? If you're worried about the money, don't be, okay? You just pick the college of your dreams, and I will figure out a way to pay for it.",
        "Liberty: I love you so much. God.",
        "Janet: I love you, too, Sweetie.",
        "Liberty: I'm so sorry I hurt you, and I promise I will be more considerate next time.",
        "Janet: Well, just always remember to wear the nanny cam I glued to your beret.",
        "Liberty: Funny.",
        "Janet: Got to go. But don't ever do this to me again, okay? You are my whole life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Being casual friends, running into each other -- that's one thing. Inviting her to the lake -- completely different.",
        "Parker: It's not a big deal. And I didn't expect for such drama to ensue. I was just trying to make Liberty feel better, not worse.",
        "Jack: Did you figure out what was bothering her?",
        "Parker: No. No, I keep on asking her, but she won't tell me. Besides, I realize that everyone is a little bit on edge because of Holden. And I'm -- I'm sorry that I made things worse.",
        "Jack: Apology accepted.",
        "Parker: I should probably apologize to Janet, shouldn't I?",
        "Jack: You're being really responsible about this, buddy.",
        "Parker: I screwed up.",
        "Jack: Hey, okay, yeah, you did, but let's concentrate on the good things. You're going back to school. You're making some money. You're helping people out. I know it's not easy with your mother being gone.",
        "Parker: Well, I mean, it was -- it's easier now that she is -- I mean, before she started drinking.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, you handled it better than a lot of grown men would have, believe me. I mean it. You did good, kid. But when it comes to Liberty, you've got to use better judgment in the future.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Janet: Hey, I got to go. I don't want to be late.",
        "Jack: Okay. All righty. Um, want me to give you a lift?",
        "Parker: No, no. I -- I have my bike. Um, Janet, I'm -- I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to make you worried.",
        "Janet: Thanks, Parker.",
        "Liberty: Thanks for covering for me. You saved my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: That is personal. You have no right to go through my things.",
        "Rosanna: You're pregnant?",
        "Teri: What part of \"Personal\" do you not understand?",
        "Rosanna: And you're the -- oh, my God! Oh, my God! I -- okay. Uh, you know what? I -- I don't want to know about this, okay? This is your disaster, not mine. I don't want to have anything to do with this.",
        "Teri: Well, you could have fooled me?",
        "Craig: Never mind, Teri. Let it go.",
        "Teri: Oh, I'm not the type.",
        "Rosanna: Good luck, Craig.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, you have no clue what's going on here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't I? I think I do. And you know what? You're right. This is your business, not mine. But I don't want it anywhere near me or Parker or Sage. And as for you, I will mail you your last paycheck.",
        "Teri: What, you're firing me?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you bet I am. And you can forget about Metro, too, as soon as Carly finds out about this. She's not gonna want you anywhere near the place.",
        "Craig: That's not your call to make.",
        "Rosanna: Well, guess what, big boy? I just made it. And as for you, I just -- I never want to see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Why won't you marry me?",
        "Emily: It's not that I don't want to marry you. My God, I've been fantasizing about being married to you for like my whole life.",
        "Paul: So what, the reality doesn't live up to the fantasy, is that it?",
        "Emily: Paul, no.",
        "Paul: Look, I just -- I think this is -- this is the right time. We're both free and clear. We could start over.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. Starting over would be changing our names, tossing our cell phones, and moving to a deserted island with nothing but our clothes.",
        "Paul: Sounds great.",
        "Emily: Mm.",
        "Paul: I don't know. I feel like we're in a great place.",
        "Emily: We are. I mean, things have never been so good between us. I -- I don't want to -- I don't want to mess that up.",
        "Paul: Well, so then we won't. Come on. You're my partner in crime. Be my partner in not in crime.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: That's a greeting-card thing to say.",
        "Paul: What can I say? I'm feeling sentimental. All kidding aside, this could be a new beginning.",
        "Barbara: Well, what are you two cooking up?",
        "Emily: I, um, really don't have the head for her right now, so --",
        "Paul: Will you, uh, just think about what I said, then?",
        "Emily: I got to go.",
        "[Paul groans]",
        "Barbara: What was that all about?",
        "Paul: You want the good news or the bad news?",
        "Barbara: What's the good news?",
        "Paul: I went to see James.",
        "Barbara: That's supposed to be good news? He doesn't deserve one second of your time?",
        "Paul: Even if I'm back in the will.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Paul: In fact, I am the will. You're looking at the sole heir to the Stenbeck fortune.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Honey, that -- that is wonderful, and you deserve it. But you -- he couldn't possibly give you enough money to compensate you for everything he's put you through your entire life.",
        "Paul: It's a hail Mary. He -- he doesn't want to die alone. He's trying to buy himself a family.",
        "Barbara: I don't care what he wants. Once he's gone, you'll be set for life. And this time, you'll be more careful.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Barbara: About giving everything away to that slut, Emily Stewart.",
        "Paul: Which brings us to the other part of the news. I asked Emily to marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey. I didn't know you were coming in today.",
        "Hunter: Is it a holiday I'm not aware of?",
        "Emily: Uh, yeah. It's called \"The feast of crazy questions.\"",
        "Hunter: Are you making fun of me?",
        "Emily: Uh, no, actually. Making fun of myself. What's going on?",
        "Hunter: Well, I've been crunching the numbers. It turns out our first issue did very well.",
        "Emily: Online or newsstand?",
        "Hunter: Both. Now, I thought you ordered way too many hard copies, but you were right. We're all sold out, and they've been calling and asking for more. Now, I thought it might be best to leave them wanting more.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good call, good call.",
        "Hunter: And we got over 30,000 hits on our website already. You know, I really think we struck gold with this Stenbeck story.",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hunter: Okay, I was thinking we should do a cold-case issue. Um, maybe follow up with all of, uh, Oakdale's unsolved murders. Emily --",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Hunter: I -- I just pitched you a story. You weren't even listening. Are you bored?",
        "Emily: No. I -- I'm not bored. I'm just, uh -- thrown for a loop.",
        "Hunter: What, that I pitched you a story? I'm sorry if I stepped on your toes or something.",
        "Emily: Paul proposed to me.",
        "Hunter: Paul? Maniac Paul? Whoa, run to the nearest exit. Do not slow down. Do not look back. Are you crazy?",
        "Emily: Really, Hunter, don't -- don't hold back your feelings on my account.",
        "Hunter: You're not seriously thinking of saying yes, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Now that I've covered for you, do you want to tell me what's really going on?",
        "Liberty: I can't. You're already in trouble with your dad because of me. It will just make it worse.",
        "Parker: No, no. I talked to him. It's fine. Liberty, I'm worried about you.",
        "Liberty: I'll be fine. I can handle it.",
        "Parker: Really? Really? What would have happened if I hadn't walked in then? I mean, what would you have told your mom?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: You're acting really weird lately. Whatever it is, you can tell me, I mean, even if it's bad. You'll probably feel better.",
        "Liberty: I can't, because then you'll hate me, and I'll probably feel worse.",
        "Parker: No, no. Liberty -- Liberty, I could never hate you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Liberty: I -- I have to take this. It's -- its private.",
        "Parker: Okay. If you ever need to talk, you know where to find me.",
        "Liberty: Hello.",
        "Teri: Liberty. Oh, thank God. Where are you?",
        "Liberty: Where are you?",
        "Teri: I'm outside Al's diner, about to talk to your mom.",
        "Liberty: Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rosanna gasps]",
        "Rosanna: I thought I made it clear, I don't ever want to see you again.",
        "Craig: You did, and now I'm gonna make something clear to you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm not listening.",
        "Craig: Yes, you are, if I have to tie you to a chair and force you to.",
        "Rosanna: You wouldn't dare.",
        "Craig: Try me.",
        "Rosanna: All right, have it your way. You say whatever it is you have to say and then get out!",
        "Craig: This is so ridiculous, I can't believe I'm even bothering, but here it is. Teri is not pregnant, and I am not the father, nor am I trying to be the father of the child that she is not carrying. Now, is that clear enough for you?",
        "Rosanna: You forget, I know you, Craig. And I know that the degree of your righteous indignation is always in direct proportion to the size of the lie that you are telling. So this one must be a whopper.",
        "Craig: You know how I feel about my children.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Unfortunately, I do.",
        "Craig: Then think about it. If Teri were pregnant, if there was a chance I could give Johnny a little brother or sister, would I want her to get rid of him?",
        "Rosanna: So what are you saying? You and Teri were reading abortion-clinic brochures for entertainment?",
        "Craig: We didn't bring that brochure into the room.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Rosanna: You're such a liar.",
        "Craig: Oh, I knew I'd be wasting my breath! As usual, you jump to the worst possible conclusion! Your jealous and vengeful little mind has -- has created a scandal out of something completely innocuous involving bastard children and sexual harassment.",
        "Rosanna: Well, not necessarily in that order.",
        "Craig: What is it, Rosanna? Has the world been so hard for you that you find it impossible to believe anyone else can tell the truth?",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying? You're saying that, uh -- the Gideon bible and abortion brochures are now kept side by side in a hotel room? I don't buy it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: But then Parker came in and alibied me. Somehow, he figured out what was going on and said that I had been hanging out with him at the lake.",
        "Teri: Oh, good, good, good. Wait, what did you tell your mom about me?",
        "Liberty: Oh, don't worry, Teri. You're cool. I -- I said to her that you thought I was gonna fill her in on the change of plans, but I forgot. So you're not in trouble.",
        "Teri: Oh, thank you. Just the thought of your mom hating me is like -- ew.",
        "Liberty: I know. You're just trying to help.",
        "Teri: But she won't see it that way. She'll think I was trying to take her place.",
        "Liberty: She knows no one can do that, Teri.",
        "Teri: On a good day, she does, but -- not always. Her ego's been batted a lot lately.",
        "Liberty: Stupid meatballs.",
        "Teri: Yeah. That and a lot of other things. I just can't lose her again, you know? But that doesn't mean I'm not gonna help you. Next time, I will not leave you alone, I promise.",
        "Liberty: Do you really think that there's gonna be a next time?",
        "Teri: If you want there to be. And this time, we know how the clinic works, so we can make an appointment ahead of time, get our stories straight. Lib, don't worry. I'll get you whatever you need, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You can't marry the woman who shot you in the back!",
        "Paul: I deserved that.",
        "Barbara: You almost died.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I didn't. I'd like to think that that was for some kind of a reason.",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine. Donate to charity. Adopt a stray dog. Don't marry one.",
        "Paul: Emily is hardly a charity case.",
        "Barbara: Does she know about your inheritance?",
        "Paul: Yes. She was there. She was in the room when James brought it up.",
        "Barbara: Wow. Wow. And then boom, a proposal. That woman works really fast.",
        "Paul: There was no work involved.",
        "Barbara: Paul, she's after your money.",
        "Paul: No. She hasn't said yes.",
        "Barbara: Don't worry. She will.",
        "Paul: I hope so. I'd like to spend the rest of my life with her.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, you'd better get used to changing your pin number every hour.",
        "Paul: You have never liked any of the women that I've been involved with.",
        "Barbara: That is not true.",
        "Paul: You don't trust my judgment.",
        "Barbara: I don't want you winding up alone.",
        "Paul: I am alone. I've ruined every relationship I've ever had, and mostly with your help.",
        "Barbara: I'm your mother. I want to protect you.",
        "Paul: I don't need you to protect me, Mother. Emily's part of my life. Please don't make me choose between the two of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You don't even know Paul.",
        "Hunter: No, I know enough. Okay, right after he lost his memory, he seemed okay. He let us live in that giant mcmansion. He gave us start-up money --",
        "Emily: Right, because he's a generous guy.",
        "Hunter: When he can't remember his own name. As soon as brain kicked back in gear, he kicked us out, and he wasn't nice about it.",
        "Emily: Well, that's because he was a little confused.",
        "Hunter: And now he's just sane?",
        "Emily: As sane as Paul Ryan gets. Hmm. We've known each other a long time, Hunter -- since we were kids. And you know what? We're both damaged goods, but we get each other. Always have, even when things went bad.",
        "Hunter: No. Sorry, Emily. Business is one thing. But he's just not the kind of guy you want to fall in love with. What, you are in love with him, aren't you?",
        "Emily: We're connected.",
        "Hunter: Then why didn't you just say yes right on the spot? That's what people who are in love do.",
        "Emily: Really, because you're such an expert on love, Hunter?",
        "Hunter: Oh, yeah. It's really not that hard to figure out. You know, I did a web search on this guy.",
        "Emily: What? You were doing a search on my boyfriend?",
        "Hunter: No, Emily. He's my boss. I want to know where my money's coming from and if it's liable to stop at any moment.",
        "Emily: No, well, it won't. He -- he gave me the money. I control the checkbook.",
        "Hunter: Good to know, 'cause this guy's got a serious record, both in all the gossip columns and all the straight news stories -- all bad, by the way.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? Nice guys don't make the news, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: You're living in a serious state of denial.",
        "Emily: I get Paul. Hunter, I do -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. He used to be crazy, spoiled, vindictive.",
        "Hunter: What a catch.",
        "Emily: But he's not any of those things anymore.",
        "Hunter: Look, how do you know he's not gonna just change back?",
        "Emily: Because I have faith. Why is that such a foreign concept to you?",
        "Hunter: You're a fake, Emily. You pretend to be all hard-nosed. Really inside, you're just an \u00fcber romantic, wishing on a star.",
        "Emily: Why do you think things aren't gonna work out between me and Paul?",
        "Hunter: I lived in his house. I've seen firsthand how the man blows hot, cold. You know, he's burning up for you now. I just don't want to be there when he freezes you out again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You can dump on me all you want. I can take care of myself. But I won't let you ruin Teri's reputation.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Rosanna: Her reputation? I have done nothing but give that girl a job and a place to stay! You -- you took her to a hotel and got her pregnant. If anybody's ruined her reputation, it's you, not me.",
        "Craig: Oh, my gosh. Why didn't I see this before? You're obsessed with the idea of everyone else having hot, steamy sex because you're not getting any.",
        "[Rosanna smacks Craig]",
        "Craig: Phew!",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: What's the matter? A little too close to home?",
        "Rosanna: Get out.",
        "Craig: Why, so you can call Carly and do your best to ruin our relationship?",
        "Rosanna: You don't have a relationship with my sister anymore.",
        "Craig: We love each other, and you're so jealous of that, you can hardly stand it.",
        "Rosanna: I am not jealous. I don't want you. Can't you take that? I will never let you touch me again. The very thought of you touching me makes me sick!",
        "[Rosanna gasps]",
        "Craig: Yeah? Is that what I see in your eyes? Disgust, revulsion? Or is there something else?",
        "[Rosanna clears throat]",
        "Both: Parker, hi.",
        "Rosanna: W -- where have you been?",
        "Parker: I was hanging out with Liberty by the lake.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Parker: Yeah. It wasn't a big deal. Please don't make it into one.",
        "Craig: I was just leaving. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: I'm sorry! I thought Liberty was gonna go right home. I had no idea that she was gonna go off --",
        "Janet: She is a kid. You are the adult. You are supposed to be the responsible one.",
        "Teri: Don't get preachy on me! She's 17 years old. It's not like you need to put a leash on her.",
        "Janet: Hey, when my kid is headed off to Chicago by herself --",
        "Teri: Chicago? She was in Chicago all by herself doing that internship for weeks. She's got a good head on her shoulders, Janet.",
        "Janet: So did I, until I got knocked up at prom.",
        "Teri: Did you regret it?",
        "Janet: What kind of a question is that?",
        "Teri: Okay, here's -- here's a better one. If Mom and Dad had watched your every move, would it have made any difference?",
        "Janet: She is my kid. I didn't know where she was. I thought -- I don't know what I thought. Maybe that she wasn't coming home.",
        "Teri: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't think about Holden's accident. I really should have called you.",
        "Janet: Oh, you're damn straight you should have.",
        "Teri: Just don't be mad at me. I'm just trying to be a good aunt. I won't let it happen again, I promise.",
        "Janet: Okay. I am -- I'm glad that you guys are hanging out together, you know? Liberty didn't grow up with family like you and I did. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Teri: Me too.",
        "Janet: And I missed you. You know, Liberty and I were more like sisters instead of mother and daughter. Which is why when it comes to disciplining her, I'm not very good at that.",
        "Teri: What? You are doing a great job. You're an excellent mom. Don't judge yourself.",
        "Janet: Thanks. But she's still vulnerable. You know, she's going off to college. She's leaving home. She's scared. And so am I. She is the most precious thing I have, and I couldn't bear it if anything happened to her.",
        "Teri: I know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Emily did a hell of a job, didn't she?",
        "Paul: From what I understand, it was a team effort. So congratulations. You're not here for a review of the first edition, are you? What do you want, Hunter?",
        "Hunter: I want you to stay away from my mother.",
        "Paul: You want me to stay away from your mother?",
        "Hunter: You heard me. Emily's just getting herself together. Last thing she needs is you messing her up again.",
        "Paul: No offense. Technically, you are her son. But you showed up, what, a few months ago? You don't even know her.",
        "Hunter: Maybe not. But I know enough about you to know that you're pretty damn toxic.",
        "Paul: You should ask around about Emily. She's as much of a pariah in this town as I am. I think that's one of the reasons that we understand each other. I think that's one of the reasons that I can make her happy.",
        "Hunter: Hmm. How come with all your history, you've never been able to make her happy before?",
        "Paul: Because I did a lot of stupid things. I did bad things to Emily and -- and with her. But this time, I think it's different.",
        "Hunter: For how long? Seriously, Paul. I mean, right now, you seem like an okay guy. You mean well. But when does Dr. Jekyll morph into Mr. Hyde again, huh? Look, Emily's -- she acts tough, but she's not. Apparently, she opened her heart to you. If you don't intend to respect it, then you better step off before you do some serious damage.",
        "Paul: Okay. I promise that I will be good to your mom.",
        "Hunter: Yeah. You'd better. 'Cause from here on out, you're gonna be answering to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What, are you stalking me?",
        "Barbara: I heard that Paul proposed.",
        "Emily: Really? Well, you know what? Why don't I save you some time, and I will act out both parts of this conversation after you leave?",
        "Barbara: You might be surprised at what I have to say.",
        "Emily: Does it include the word \"Slut\"?",
        "Barbara: No, it doesn't. I understand why the two of you are drawn to each other. You're too damaged people looking for any port in the storm.",
        "Emily: Is that supposed to be a compliment?",
        "Barbara: The very thing that makes you and Paul irresistible to each other is also the thing that makes you terrible for each other.",
        "Emily: What makes you the expert? When have you ever known what's best for yourself?",
        "Barbara: I know when my son is being taken advantage of, and I know that you want to get your grubby little hands on his inheritance.",
        "Emily: I really don't care what you're thinking. Paul says I make him stronger. And you know what? He does the same for me. It's one of the many reasons we're together.",
        "Barbara: And how long will it last? I mean, you're happy for a while, then you start to hate each other. There's a betrayal. Maybe there are even bullets involved. Then you split, you hate each other a little bit more, and then the whole thing starts all over again. Why should this time be any different? Obviously, you've asked yourself the same question.",
        "Emily: You have no idea what I'm thinking.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, I do. You're trying to figure out why it is that Paul has turned to you now. Is it because James is back, and he's feeling shaky, so he's grasping onto the nearest straw, which happens to be you?",
        "Emily: Why does it matter why we're together as long as we want what's best for each other? It's more than I can say for most people in this town.",
        "Barbara: Well, I will leave you with one last question, then. Do you really think my son would even look at you if there was any chance of getting Meg back?",
        "Emily: Meg's moved on.",
        "Barbara: Paul hasn't. He still loves her. He always will. So the question is, are you prepared to be in second place behind the love of his life and the child that they share? Just a little food for thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey. Miss me?",
        "Paul: Well, I wasn't alone. I had some company. Your son stopped by to tell me not to marry you.",
        "Emily: Really? That's so funny. Your mother came to see me for the same reason.",
        "Paul: Really? Well, that settles it. We should get married just to spite them.",
        "Emily: Not a great reason to marry someone.",
        "Paul: How about this? How about I love you?",
        "Emily: I want to believe that.",
        "Paul: Then go ahead and believe it.",
        "Emily: You see, it was only a few months ago you loved Meg. She and Eliza were your whole life.",
        "Paul: Well, they're gone. I'm over it.",
        "Emily: Just like that?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm sorry that my mourning period wasn't long enough for you, Emily.",
        "Emily: I didn't say that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you did. You kind of did. That's kind of what you said.",
        "Emily: No, look, I -- I know that you want to close the door from your past, and it's not just Meg. It's James. You want to put all that pain behind you.",
        "Paul: Well, wouldn't you?",
        "Emily: You know I would.",
        "Paul: Well, that's just another way that we're the same. I -- I couldn't really put my past behind me before. But now, with you, I feel like I can.",
        "Emily: Maybe.",
        "Paul: Why don't you believe me?",
        "Emily: I do. I'm here. I -- I will do anything I can to help you. But I don't -- I don't want to be with you out of fear or lust. If we decide to spend the rest of our lives together, I want it to be about nothing but love and joy.",
        "Paul: It's a tall order.",
        "Emily: Yeah. But you know what? I think it's about time we rose to the occasion, don't you?",
        "Paul: You think we can?",
        "Emily: With a little luck. And when we do, I will most definitely say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Rosanna, what was going on with you and Craig when I came home.",
        "[Rosanna clears throat]",
        "Rosanna: Uh, well, Craig was upset because, um, he was lying, and I caught him. You know, there was that photo shoot and, uh -- that didn't happen, and, um, you know, the one with you.",
        "Parker: You mean the mystery shoot?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Parker: You asked me about that -- that one.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. And, um, Teri, uh, and -- and he were in Chicago when he said that he was in New York by himself.",
        "Parker: Doing what?",
        "Rosanna: \"Scouting restaurants.\"",
        "Parker: Well, that's Teri's job, isn't it? And, I mean, Craig's her boss. Why would he have to lie about something like that?",
        "[Rosanna clears throat]",
        "Rosanna: Well, I have a pretty good idea, but, um, I really don't want to discuss it with you, if you don't mind.",
        "Parker: I'm not a kid, Aunt Rosanna. You're not gonna shock me.",
        "Rosanna: I know, I know. But this is just something that is between me -- me and Craig. And, uh, all you need to know is that Teri is not going to be working here anymore.",
        "Parker: You fired her? Why?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I had my reasons, okay? And from now on, I want you to stay away from Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you thinking about?",
        "Jack: Probably the same thing you are.",
        "Janet: The kids?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. See, I thought Parker and Liberty were over.",
        "Janet: You don't think they are?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure. You think they're sleeping together again?",
        "Janet: I don't know. God, I hope not!",
        "Jack: I know, right?",
        "Janet: They've been spending so much time together. And with this whole thing with the lake today --",
        "Jack: What if something is going on? I think we need to know about it.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, you and me up against two teenagers with raging hormones?",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Janet: We're gonna need backup.",
        "Jack: Brad? Really? Seriously?",
        "Janet: Well, only if necessary. Because you know \"Liberty\" and \"Sex\" in the same sentence makes smoke come out of his ears. Thank God I've got her on birth control. Because if she's -- if she's having sex, at least she's safe.",
        "Jack: Honey, Honey, Honey, rest assured, you did the -- you did the right thing.",
        "Janet: She's got such a great future ahead of her with college and a career.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Janet: I just don't want her to get sidetracked the way I did.",

        "Liberty: Yeah. Parker, um, thanks to you, I'm not even in any trouble with my mom.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you're still in some kind of trouble, aren't you?",
        "Liberty: It's not your problem.",
        "Parker: Okay. I won't pressure you. But if you ever do feel like talking, I'm here.",

        "[Liberty sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, how did it go with Janet?",
        "Teri: Kids pretty much saved my butt. Parker told everyone that he was with Liberty all day, and Liberty told Jan that I thought she was gonna call. So I dodged a bullet.",
        "Craig: Good for you.",
        "Teri: She did manage to sneak in that \"If you had kids, you'd understand\" lecture. That's the one I love. I take it things didn't go so well with you and Rosanna.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: Well, I don't think she inflicted any permanent damage. She's determined to believe that I got you pregnant, and I don't want her putting the wrong idea in people's minds.",
        "Teri: You mean Carly.",
        "Craig: We haven't seen each other for a while. But even in her best times, Carly isn't the most secure woman on earth. So help me if Rosanna's trying to convince her that I'm cheating. I love Carly. I don't want to lose her, especially not over something I didn't even do.",
        "Teri: I'm so sorry that I dragged you into this. I'd totally understand if you need to bail. Liberty's my niece, not yours.",
        "Craig: I said I'd help you, and I will.",
        "Teri: I don't want you to, not if it comes between you and Carly.",
        "Craig: Rosanna's the one trying to hurt me, not you.",
        "Teri: Yeah, well, when Carly gets out of rehab, she's gonna need to feel safe. Having me around all the time -- I'm telling you, this is a woman, Craig. It's not such a good idea. I love this place, but I think it's best if I move on. It's not worth you ruining your reputation over it.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: First of all, this is my reputation. People think I'm an unrepentant womanizer. And second of all, I like Liberty, and I like Janet, and I like you. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna help Liberty fix her problem, and then we'll figure out a way for you to keep working here.",
        "Teri: You are the greatest man I've ever, ever known.",
