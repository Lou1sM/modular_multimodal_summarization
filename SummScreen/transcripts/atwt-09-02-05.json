        "[Barbara scoffs]",
        "Barbara: Well, if you ask me, she's nothing but trouble. I just thank God that it turned out to be a lie that Will was the father of her child. I don't know why he still calls her a friend. She must be holding something over him.",
        "Carly: What do you think it is?",
        "Barbara: I haven't a clue.",
        "Carly: I don't suppose there's anything you could tell me, anything that I could bring up in court, could you?",
        "Barbara: Why don't you look at where she lives? I'm sure there are 1,001 health code violations in that room that she calls home. And when I offered to help her out, she was ungrateful and disrespectful.",
        "Carly: And sounds like quite a slob. Thanks, Barbara. That's perfect. That's exactly what I need. I'll talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, I'm glad you decided to get out. It's good for you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I felt bad about giving you a hard time.",
        "Will: No, don't. It's okay. I understand you blowing off steam. It's better at me than Carly or the judge, or someone who's just gonna use it against you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Will: So, I've print out the movie times, and I think we should see a stupid comedy, get your mind off things.",
        "Gwen: You'd be wasting your money on the price of the ticket. I don't think I could pay attention to a movie or anything else for more than five minutes. All I can think about is the case. What's gonna happen? Am I gonna get my baby back?",
        "Will: Gwen, everything's going to be okay.",
        "Gwen: How can you be so sure?",
        "Will: The law's on your side. That's what your lawyer keeps telling you, right?",
        "Gwen: Well, my lawyer will say anything as long as I pay him.",
        "Will: Stop worrying about money, okay? Paul's gonna put pressure on Mom so we can get to my trust fund. He's gonna come through. I know he will.",
        "Gwen: Let's hope.",
        "Will: What? You don't think he can?",
        "Gwen: No, it's just -- I'm just wondering, why does he even want to help me out, anyways?",
        "Will: Because he's my brother. And he's a good guy.",
        "Gwen: Is he?",
        "Will: Why would you think he isn't?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But are you really sure we can trust him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hi, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Hi. Jennifer's not here.",
        "Dusty: I'm actually here to see you.",
        "Barbara: Is there a problem?",
        "Dusty: I think there is, yeah.",
        "Barbara: About Jen?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Well, you better come in.",
        "Dusty: I'm worried about her. I mean, her behavior. Her behavior's all over the place.",
        "Barbara: She's still dealing with the loss of her baby. Come on, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: She's totally manic. She's high one minute. She's furious the next, happy the next. I can't believe you haven't noticed this.",
        "Barbara: I have noticed, but I just assumed it was a reaction to the medication she's taking. She's on anti-depressants, you know.",
        "Dusty: Well, I thought the pills were supposed to take care of that kind of thing.",
        "Barbara: Eventually, but there might be some kind of instability in the beginning.",
        "Dusty: I'm worried about her, and I think the pills are nonsense. I mean, if this is what they're doing to her, they're obviously no good.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here, Dusty? Checking up on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You really want to know what's in there?",
        "Hal: For weeks, I've had this feeling that Paul's got you involved in something that you don't want to be a part of. If that's true, Emily, I only want to help you.",
        "Emily: Fine. I wasn't sure I was ready to show you this, but now I guess it's time. Here.",
        "Hal: These are divorce papers.",
        "Emily: That's right, they are. You break into my home. You rummage through my things. You better prepare yourself for what you might find.",
        "Hal: This is not what I came here looking for.",
        "Emily: No, you came looking for something you could use to hurt Paul! I can't believe I was actually going to wait to move ahead with the divorce.",
        "Hal: These papers are already signed. That's pretty damned definite, wouldn't you say?",
        "Emily: You break into my home and you interrogate me like I'm some kind of criminal and you think --",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Paul: What are you doing here, Hal?",
        "Emily: He was just leaving. Take the papers with you. Sign them, don't sign them. It really doesn't matter to me anymore. Because as far as I'm concerned, our marriage is over, whether a piece of paper says so or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What a dump. It's perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Do you have any idea how disappointed I am?",
        "Emily: You'll get over it. I did.",
        "Hal: Believe it or not, I came here to help you.",
        "Emily: I don't need your help.",
        "Hal: I'm sorry you feel that way. You sure need someone's.",
        "Paul: Hal, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave our home.",
        "Hal: Fine. You're on your own now.",
        "Paul: No, she's not. She's got me. Door's over there. You wanna tell me what he was doing here?",
        "Emily: He came with my mom. I gave her a key, in case she needs to look after Daniel.",
        "Paul: And they just barged in?",
        "Emily: Just let it go, okay? He's not coming back. Not now.",
        "Paul: I think you handled that really well.",
        "Emily: Did I?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Yeah, that was great. I knew I could count on you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I am checking up on you. I want to see how you are holding up.",
        "Jennifer: I'm holding up fine. I don't need a bodyguard or a baby sitter.",
        "Dusty: I didn't like the way things ended the last time we saw each other.",
        "Jennifer: It was no big deal. And, please, don't try to make it into one.",
        "Dusty: Whatever you say. I'm glad you're okay. I'll see you back at the office.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty? Please wait. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound so harsh.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about it. I know it's not fun having someone breathe down your neck all the time.",
        "Jennifer: Only because I don't need it. I am doing better. I'm moody, I'll admit that, but aren't I allowed to be? 'Cause I'm just trying to find a balance here.",
        "Dusty: I want to help you do that.",
        "Jennifer: The only way that i can make it is if I figure out how to do it on my own.",
        "Dusty: If you need me, you know where I am.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing?",
        "Jennifer: What is this, \"spy on Jennifer\" day?",
        "Barbara: I am not spying. I am concerned.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I see. So you just -- you rummage through my purse behind my back. What did Dusty say to you?",
        "Barbara: You know, Dusty didn't have to say a thing to me because you have not been yourself. And I've been very, very worried about you, Jen. And you know what? These pills -- only half of them are in here. You only had this prescription a couple of days. Now, do you want to explain that to me?",
        "Jennifer: The bottle fell into the sink. And some fell down the drain! Mystery solved! Now, can I please have the bottle back? Stop looking at me like I'm lying!",
        "Barbara: I'm not.",
        "Jennifer: I see suspicion in your eyes.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I am worried about you. I know what you're going through. And I understand how desperate you are to make the pain go away.",
        "Jennifer: I am learning how to deal with this.",
        "Barbara: Jen, I know these pills are supposed to help you, but they can also be a problem. They can become a crutch.",
        "Jennifer: What are you implying?",
        "Barbara: I just want you to know that you can talk to me. You can tell me anything. I won't judge you. You know that, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, look what the wind blew in.",
        "Dusty: Is that what I am to you? A piece of tumbleweed or something?",
        "Meg: How was Chicago?",
        "Dusty: It was, you know -- good, as expected, with exception to your surprise visit.",
        "Meg: Hey, I livened things up a little bit. Even if it was for a few minutes.",
        "Dusty: Let's not even talk about it.",
        "Meg: You're right. Damn that awkward chitchat. So, how's Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: I'm asking myself the same question. I don't know.",
        "Meg: Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Dusty: I hope not.",
        "Meg: Well, now, I'm curious.",
        "Dusty: Well, don't be. I'm probably overreacting.",
        "Meg: Not normal for you.",
        "Dusty: Well, there's a first time for everything.",
        "Meg: No, if you think something is wrong, it usually is.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's going through what you call major mood swings. I think she just took on too much too soon. It's all catching up to her.",
        "Meg: That, or she's taking advantage of your protective streak, and she has you exactly where she wants you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You know, I should really go. This is none of my business.",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. I mean, this is a family matter, and I appreciate your understanding.",
        "Keith: Okay. I'll call you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: You know, I think we just need to back up a little bit here and everybody just take a breath, and try to look at this from a different perspective.",
        "Lucinda: I don't. I'm not interested in that. I've found what I want, and I'm not interested in looking at anything in a different perspective.",
        "Lily: Could we at least talk to Dr. Berg about this?",
        "Lucinda: No! I dislike that woman. Anyway, we know exactly what her reaction is going to be. This is my illness. This place -- it has had wonderful results. I met a woman who is cancer-free after treatments there. I can myself attest that I feel better after, and it's more than that. Look. Now, just you look at this. This is my blood. This is improvement. I'll translate it for you. All right? This is what I want. And this is what I'm gonna do, so you just peruse that at your leisure.",
        "Lily: What are we going to do?",
        "Sierra: Stop her.",
        "Lily: How do we stop her?",
        "Sierra: I don't know. I don't know. Maybe we call Bob Hughes, and he can talk to her.",
        "Lily: Bob Hughes? She is long past changing her mind. Don't you think?",
        "Sierra: Well, then maybe we have to play by her rules. And do everything we can not to let her go back to that clinic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Hey.",
        "Will: Hey, Dad. I'm glad you came.",
        "Hal: No problem. What's up?",
        "Will: I need help with Gwen's court case. I already talked to Paul. I just -- I wanted to come to you, too.",
        "Hal: What kind of help?",
        "Will: I have to convince Mom to lighten up so I can get access to my trust fund.",
        "Hal: Why? So you can give Gwen money?",
        "Will: Dad, she's in really bad shape. She can't even afford her lawyer.",
        "Hal: With all due respect, son, how is this your problem?",
        "Will: She's my friend.",
        "Hal: Have you talked to your mother directly about this?",
        "Will: Like that's gonna do any good.",
        "Hal: Well, I got a news flash for you. Going to Paul isn't gonna do you any good, either. Because unless there's something in it for him, he's not gonna give you a damn thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, I have to admit. When I first came in, and I saw you and Hal over there by the safe, there was a minute there, I mean, just a minute when I thought --",
        "Emily: I was going to tell the truth about Jennifer's baby being alive.",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Emily: I considered it.",
        "Paul: So what changed your mind?",
        "Emily: I couldn't betray you. You know that I've had doubts about this being the right thing to do. But I am with you 100%.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No judge is going to let her raise a baby in a pig sty like this.",
        "Gwen: What do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Sierra: We've confiscated your passport and your driver's license so you can't leave the country.",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to help you out.",
        "Jennifer: Then get the hell out of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Give me that camera.",
        "Carly: These pictures are going directly to the judge. We'll see what he has to say about this. You go first.",
        "Gwen: I asked you what you're doing here. How did you even get in?",
        "Carly: I have friends, Gwen. Which is more than you can say for yourself, I bet.",
        "Gwen: What's with the camera?",
        "Carly: Did you really think that you could bring a little baby into a disgusting room like this?",
        "Gwen: I'm looking for another place to move as soon as the money comes in.",
        "Carly: So this is really all about the money, isn't it? That's the only reason you want Rory back.",
        "Gwen: I'm calling the cops.",
        "Carly: That's fine. Go ahead, it won't matter. Once the judge sees these pictures, he will agree that I did the right thing. Not only are you a liar, but you live in a place that's not fit for an animal, let alone a little baby!",
        "Gwen: Get out of my house!",
        "Carly: Just face it, Gwen. You are not ready to be a mother. Just accept it and let all of this go.",
        "Gwen: That's not true. I will be a good mother. I just need the chance to prove it.",
        "Carly: Face it. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Gwen: Give me that camera.",
        "Carly: These pictures are going directly to the judge! We'll see what he has to say about this!",
        "Gwen: You know what? It won't matter. I'm still getting my kid back. He belongs with me.",
        "Carly: Dream on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I saw Carly today. She's gonna go after Gwen with everything she's got. I'm worried, Paul. What if she comes across something that leads her to the truth about the baby?",
        "Paul: That's unlikely. We just have to get Gwen custody fast. Get Gwen and the baby set up somewhere far away. We play this smart, no one needs to know that Craig took Jennifer's baby and switched it with Gwen's.",
        "Emily: I don't know. It's all so precarious. What if Gwen doesn't want to go away?",
        "Paul: Gwen will do exactly what I tell her to do. I helped her keep her baby. She's not going to jeopardize that. I just have to make sure that the money that sets her up, she has to know that it comes from me and not from Will. I need to have a talk with Barbara. I need to make sure that Will never gets his hands on that trust fund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I know Paul's your brother and all, but he can't be trusted. For that matter, how do you know you can even trust Gwen? She's been lying left and right. She even asked you to lie for her when you were first claiming that the baby was your own.",
        "Will: No, that was my idea, not hers. I knew how upset Celia would be if she found out Casey was the father.",
        "Hal: But Casey isn't the father. The paternity suit was negative.",
        "Will: Gwen doesn't believe that. She thinks somebody tampered with the test.",
        "Hal: That's impossible.",
        "Will: Something's not right. And I don't believe that she's lying to me.",
        "Hal: Look, I know you're standing up for Gwen because she's your friend, and I admire that. But I'm just telling you to be careful. Things get really crazy where money is concerned. Now, that trust fund, it's for your education, Will. It's for your future.",
        "Will: Dad, money doesn't mean anything if you can't use it to help the people you care about. I care about Gwen and I trust her.",
        "Hal: Well, I hope she doesn't make you sorry that you do. Sometimes. When people want something too much, they'll go to any lengths to get it. They don't care who they use, and they start believing their own lies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Is that why Dusty was here? To get you to grill me about my medication? What do you think that I'm doing? Just popping pills, one after the other?",
        "Barbara: Honey, Dusty and I both agree that you've been acting a bit erratically.",
        "Jennifer: I don't believe this! I'm depressed, and then everyone tells me that I need to pull myself out of it. When I finally do, then I'm just suddenly erratic! I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't!",
        "Barbara: Dusty wants you happy. So do I.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty knows nothing about loss or true pain. He hasn't suffered like you and I have suffered, Mom. He doesn't understand. He never will.",
        "Barbara: You're right about that. He never will.",
        "Jennifer: So you need to just forget about what he said because I need you to be on my side. I need you to support me!",
        "Barbara: Honey, I do. I will. I always support you. You know that.",
        "Jennifer: Well, sometimes it feels like you're ready to hear what everyone else has to say before me.",
        "Barbara: No, Jen. I always put you before everyone else, honey. You know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why would you think that Jen's trying to manipulate me? I mean, she doesn't need to. She knows I'm here for her.",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's pretty obvious.",
        "Dusty: She's not the type to use a tragedy to get what she wants, is what I'm saying.",
        "Meg: Wait a minute. That's not what I meant.",
        "Dusty: So, what do you mean?",
        "Meg: Forget it.",
        "Dusty: Maybe it's you who's being manipulative.",
        "Meg: Meaning?",
        "Dusty: Meaning you're not in competition with her. Are you? She's a friend. And so are you. At least I thought you were, before you started putting down this woman who can hardly defend herself right now.",
        "Meg: I'm not putting down anyone.",
        "Dusty: No? Do me a favor. From now on, stay away from Jennifer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You two are still here? I mean, if you think that you're gonna hang around just to change my mind, forget it.",
        "Sierra: Oh, no, we know we can't change your mind.",
        "Lily: No, you made that perfectly clear. So you've left us with no choice.",
        "Lucinda: What are you gonna do? You gonna kidnap me?",
        "Sierra: Well, in a matter of speaking. We've confiscated your passport and your driver's license so that you can't leave the country.",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Sierra: Like Lily said, you've left us no choice.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my darlings. This is outrageous and utterly ridiculous and rather naive. I have traveled the world with nothing except my library card in my pocket. It's not going to keep me from going to Mexico.",
        "Sierra: I've also ordered the Worldwide jet back to Montega. It's on its way right now. And it can't come back unless I order it to.",
        "Lucinda: On whose authority?",
        "Sierra: Well, you did put me in charge recently.",
        "Lucinda: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Lily: To save your life.",
        "Lucinda: I just don't believe this insubordination.",
        "Lily: We're just doing this because we love you, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: No.",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but if you really loved me, you'd understand what I need. And, honey, I can get to Mexico without a passport. This is something that I think is going to help me, and my two daughters are preventing me from taking advantage. I don't know what you want. I mean, what do you want? Do you want to go on like all the rest of my life, and just being unhappy and miserable and dying, is that what you want!?",
        "Sierra: Mother, you trust this clinica de la vida. We don't know anything about it.",
        "Lucinda: Get out!",
        "Sierra: Give us a second to investigate it. We can make this decision together.",
        "Lucinda: Get out of my house, or I will call the police.",
        "Lily: Okay, we'll talk about this when you've calmed down.",
        "Lucinda: Go! I think -- I don't know. It's Mrs. Walsh. Your presence is needed, immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Well, you're the last person I expected to see back here today. I hope you've got an apology on the tip of your tongue.",
        "Susan: Yes, and an explanation. Oh, hello, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hello, Susan.",
        "Susan: I'd really rather talk to you in private.",
        "Emily: I trust Paul a hell of a lot more than I trust you. Anything you want to say to me, say it in front of him.",
        "Susan: Well, then I guess we'll be talking some other time. Sorry to disturb you.",
        "Emily: Wait, wait, wait. Back up! Hand over the key. I don't want anymore surprise visits from you, Hal or anyone else.",
        "Susan: I think you're making way too much of this.",
        "Emily: You come to my home behind my back. You make some illegal search. When did that become a casual affair?",
        "Susan: If you'll just let me explain.",
        "Emily: Fine, go ahead.",
        "Susan: In private!",
        "Paul: Em, if you want me to go, I'd be happy to --",
        "Emily: No, just -- please stay. I'm not gonna stand here and listen to you for the tenth time telling me how Paul's ruining my life.",
        "Paul: You think that being with me is ruining Emily's life? I'm devastated.",

        "Keith: So what is it you want from me?",
        "Lucinda: Don't laugh out loud. My daughters have seized my passport and have grounded me. I'm grounded. They've grounded my plane in Montega. They think that I won't be able to find a way to get down to la clinica de la vida.",

        "Barbara: What's really wrong with her is she's tired of people like you watching her every single move. And for your information, I did not rat you out about this. She figured it out by herself. You don't give her enough credit, that's the problem here.",
        "Dusty: We don't know what the problem is, but I have my suspicions.",
