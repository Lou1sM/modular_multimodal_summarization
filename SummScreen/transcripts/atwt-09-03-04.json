        "Lily: So you think our marriage isn't working? Where does that come from?",
        "Holden: I really don't want to get into it right now.",
        "Lily: You can't say something like that and then not talk about it.",
        "Holden: You're upset, I'm angry. I don't want to say something that I might regret.",
        "Lily: What could be worse than what you just said to me?",
        "Holden: Lily, don't push me.",
        "Lily: What are you gonna do? You're gonna walk out on me? Holden -- you kissed Molly, and now you're telling me that it's too hard to be married to me?",
        "Holden: I didn't say that.",
        "Lily: Well, for all I know, you have a foot out the door already.",
        "Holden: No, that's not true.",
        "Lily: I thought that our marriage was solid, and here you are. You are saying and you're doing things that are coming out of left field. I don't understand.",
        "Holden: Where have you been? This \"solid marriage\" that you're talking about, we haven't had that since Rose died.",
        "Lily: You're gonna go there? The death of my sister was awful, and what happened to her has changed me forever. I'm not going to apologize for that.",
        "Holden: It's the way you've changed.",
        "Lily: Have I become a person that you don't even like?",
        "Holden: Lily, I still love you.",
        "Lily: Then what is this? What?",
        "Holden: Who you are, the things that I love about you, none of that has changed. What's changed is the way you feel about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Not here, Nikki, please.",
        "Nikki: Why?",
        "Jennifer: Jordan and I came here so many times, and we -- we danced, and we held hands. We said \"I love you\" over fried zucchini right at the table.",
        "Nikki: Well, so we'll go over to this table, and we'll call it the \"where I forgot about how Jordan Sinclair broke my heart, and I got on with my life\" table. Now sit.",
        "Jennifer: Nikki, you don't understand. I loved him.",
        "Nikki: Like I've never had a broken heart.",
        "Jennifer: It totally bites.",
        "Nikki: Look, I wish there was some fast, easy cure, but until then, let's just get a drink and a bite to eat.",
        "Jennifer: No fried zucchini.",
        "Nikki: Okay, then let's rent some weepy DVDs and make some popcorn.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan loves popcorn!",
        "Nikki: Then we'll go shoe shopping, and we'll put on our brand-new shoes, and we'll rent DVDs and get chocolate ice cream. Like, a whole gallon of it, with two spoons. What do you say?",
        "Jennifer: Our family is falling apart, and we're eating ice cream?",
        "Nikki: Please, just one crisis at a time?",
        "Henry: Mike, get over to Metro right now. It's an emergency. Yeah. It's a love attack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Michaels: Barbara, we're going to transfer you to another hospital. It's a facility that's special. It's going to be able to help you. Do you understand?",
        "Hal: We have got to find a way to stop this. I don't want Barbara in the same hospital as Will.",
        "Dr. Michaels: I tried to have it changed. The judge was adamant, and now I'm forced to comply with his order.",
        "Hal: There are other psychiatric hospitals.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Not in this jurisdiction, not that are licensed to perform this kind of evaluation.",
        "Hal: Barbara jumped through a pane glass window to stop from being sent to prison. If she goes to that hospital, she will find a way to get to Will. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Hey, sweetie, take these to Jack for me, please.",
        "[Whispering]",
        "J.J.: Don't forget the present.",
        "Julia: I won't. Hurry.",
        "Jack: Okay. I think I'm ready to go. Very nice.",
        "Julia: You look really nice.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Thank you very much. Your mom picked me out some cool threads, didn't she, buddy?",
        "J.J.: Yep.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Now I'll finally be able to pay you back. Unless, of course, they hate me and I make no tips.",
        "J.J.: No way!",
        "Jack: No way! I wish I could put you in my pocket for good luck.",
        "Julia: Well, this will work just as well. It's from J.J. and me.",
        "Jack: Julia, you've already spent more than enough money on me.",
        "Julia: No, no, no.",
        "J.J.: This was free.",
        "Jack: Oh, wow. In that case, uh --",
        "Julia: It was my Dad's. I know yours got ruined in the accident, so we wanted you to have it, for luck.",
        "Jack: Luck?",
        "Julia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: I scored more luck than I deserve when the two of you came into my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Looks like you and Jack had a lot of fun together.",
        "Parker: We'll have more fun when Jack comes home. I'm going to put this up in my room. Okay, Mom?",
        "Carly: Oh, yes. Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead. Just don't wake up your sister. Well, you talked to Parker. He looked at Jack's pictures. What's your verdict? Is Jack, is he really gone, or is Parker right?",
        "Toby: I don't know.",
        "Carly: But you don't -- you don't feel it. You don't -- you don't feel that Jack is dead?",
        "Toby: No.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Toby: But that doesn't mean he's alive. I'm not getting anything one way or the other. I'm a psychic, not a mathematician. My gift is not an exact science. I'm really sorry, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, its -- its okay. You tried. It's just, if we had found his body, or if Parker were less sure, maybe I could make myself believe that Jack is really gone.",
        "Toby: I can tell you this -- the truth is somewhere in your son. Parker and Jack are very connected. You should let him guide you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I love you more than anything in the world.",
        "Holden: Really?",
        "Lily: After everything we've been through, all the years that we've known each other, you can even question that?",
        "Holden: There was a time when we could have been 1,000 miles apart, and I'd still feel close to you. Now I lie in the same bed with you --",
        "Lily: What is this about, sex?",
        "Holden: No. No, it's not about sex. I mean, do I wish it happened a little more often? Yeah, sure, why not? But if that's all I wanted from you, then we would never have made it this far.",
        "Lily: I know. I'm just confused. I don't know. I'm just -- I'm trying to figure out what you're missing.",
        "Holden: I used to walk into a room, and you'd be happy to see me. Whenever you were confused about something, you always came to me. We used to laugh about anything and nothing. I miss that. I think I miss that the most.",
        "Lily: Okay, I get that. I get that you're missing things in our marriage, but why turn to Molly? Why did you do that? Why did you hurt me like that?",
        "Holden: You know, when somebody used to say \"it just happened,\" I used to think \"what a crock.\" But --",
        "Lily: What, why?",
        "Holden: It seems like I was the strong one, and I have been the strong one forever. I carried the wait of your grief for Rose, took care of the kids 24/7. But it was okay. I handled it. I love the kids, I love you. I was okay with it. I knew that we were getting back on track. I knew it would only be a matter of time. And then Jack died, and I wanted you to understand.",
        "Lily: Tell me.",
        "Holden: Me and Jack were like brothers. We did everything together. We got in trouble together every summer as kids. And then all of a sudden, he was gone, and I just lost it. That control that I had over everything, I just lost it.",
        "Lily: You should have come to me. You shouldn't have turned to Molly.",
        "Holden: You were caught up in something else.",
        "Lily: Then you should have, I don't know, force me, grab me, did something to make me listen to you!",
        "Holden: You don't listen when you get like that. You were so busy with Craig -- you were busy with him ever since you brought him into our home. You only heard Craig. You only heard his voice. I'm sorry, but I'm tired of being drowned out by Craig Montgomery!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Let me help you.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Uh, my hands are really shaking. I hope that doesn't happen by that piano. It will be the shortest gig on record.",
        "Julia: You're gonna do just fine.",
        "Jack: Oh, sometimes things don't connect. My memory, it's -- what if I forget the words?",
        "Julia: Well, look at that. It fits.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Julia: The watch.",
        "Jack: The watch?",
        "Julia: It fits.",
        "Jack: Right. [Julia laughs] So you'll be there tonight.",
        "Julia: I don't know. I'm not sure.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. I already set up the babysitter and everything.",
        "Julia: I know, but they're short at work, and --",
        "Jack: Oh, well, you know, that's more important I guess.",
        "Julia: It's not. It's just the money.",
        "Jack: I understand completely. I do. It's just -- I better go.",
        "Julia: Unless, you want to call them and tell them you changed your mind?",
        "Jack: No, I'm going through with it. I just -- I just thought it would be cool to have a friendly face in the audience, that's all. Maybe you can come back after you work.",
        "Julia: I'll see what I can do.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm easy to spot. I'll be the one at the piano. Bye.",
        "Julia: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker, Toby's just leaving. You want to say good-bye?",
        "Parker: Do you know where Jack is?",
        "Toby: I'm afraid not, but I'm gonna keep trying. And you should keep listening to your heart.",
        "Carly: Hal? Hi. I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Toby: Good to see you, Lieutenant.",
        "Hal: Toby. Toby; see you later.",
        "Carly: Thanks for coming by.",
        "Hal: Hey, how's my boy?",
        "Parker: Good. Are we still going to the game Saturday?",
        "Hal: You bet. Hey, what was Toby doing here?",
        "Parker: She's going to help us find Jack.",
        "Carly: No, no, she didn't say that.",
        "Parker: She works with the police, and she knows Jack.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know that, sweetheart, but --",
        "Hal: Parker, would you run upstairs and play for a little while so I can talk to Mommy? Okay, what the hell is going on, and what the hell was that psychic doing here?",
        "Carly: Look, Parker, he is still feeling things. He still insists that Jack is gonna come home.",
        "Hal: I thought we put this to bed.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, we may have, but Parker hasn't. He refuses to believe that Jack is dead, and I --",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Carly: I'm starting to believe he may be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: You know what we need? A project. Something we can do together. You know, a whole sister thing.",
        "Jennifer: A project? Like what?",
        "Nikki: Well, when I was in DC, I got involved with this organization called Rock the Vote. And you know, getting this generation involved by getting them to vote. I had to back burner it when I got involved in the Starziak case. But who's to say we can't start it right here in Oakdale?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, Rock the Vote. I like that idea. It'd be a good way to make a difference and make some new friends.",
        "Nikki: Yeah, and it's exactly what we both need.",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Mike: You said it was an emergency. Where's the blood?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, I exaggerated. Mike, it is an emergency though. My blood pressure is in the stratosphere. My heart is doing like the cha-cha, and my chest and my knees are weak.",
        "Mike: And your mouth is working overtime, as usual. So?",
        "Henry: Nikki, Nikki, Nikki is here. Don't look. Don't look. You're gonna spook her.",
        "Mike: That's why you wanted me here? So that we could stand here and not look at Nikki together?",
        "Henry: I -- I need to know what to do next, okay? I've been hoping to run into her. It's finally happened. I can't blow this. Help me, obi-wan.",
        "Mike: First thing, calm down.",
        "Henry: Right, right. Okay. Next.",
        "Mike: Go over there and say hello.",
        "Henry: Hello? What, that's the best line you can come up with?",
        "Mike: Usually when I talk to a woman, I just -- I play it by ear, follow my instincts. Maybe you should try that.",
        "Henry: I will. That is a good idea. I'm gonna follow your instincts. Come on.",
        "Mike: What do you need me for?",
        "Henry: I'm -- she's here with her sister. I'm here with my buddy, all right? Boy, girl, boy, girl.",
        "Mike: No. Uh-uh.",
        "Henry: Yeah, come on. Come on. We pull this one off, I swear, I will never call you again.",
        "Mike: Never? You swear?",
        "Henry: I swear. I swear.",
        "Mike: Okay, let's make this happen.",
        "Jennifer: Don't look now, but they're headed this way.",
        "Henry: Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How can you compare my friendship with Craig to what happened between you and Molly?",
        "Holden: I'm not comparing anything. I'm just saying that the man is around all the time, and he's not helping us.",
        "Lily: We owe him! I would be dead right now if he didn't save me from that bell tower.",
        "Holden: If it weren't for Craig, you would never have been there in the first place!",
        "Lily: My niece was in danger!",
        "Holden: And you turned to Craig!",
        "Lily: That's her father! If that makes you jealous, then --",
        "Holden: No, if you needed help, you should have come to me.",
        "Lily: You would have said, \"let the police handle it.\" And we did not have the time.",
        "Holden: No time? What, you haven't heard? They have these new inventions. They've called \"police cars.\" They're really fast, and they have these sirens?",
        "Lily: Okay, you know what? This is not helping anybody.",
        "Holden: You're right, you're right. Lucy's home, and she's safe, and the crisis is over. But that's my point here. Craig, he is a big boy. He needs to find his own place. He needs to get on with his life, and he needs to get out of ours!",
        "Lily: You want him to be kicked out?",
        "Holden: Yes!",
        "Lily: That's spite talking! There's nothing between Craig and me but friendship.",
        "Holden: No, you and I have kids. We have a home together, we share a bed together, but yet we just don't seem like friends, do we?",
        "Lily: How is kicking Craig out going to change that?",
        "Holden: Look, it doesn't take a kiss to make someone an intruder. Craig is there, just like Molly was there, and you are turning to him instead of me.",
        "Lily: You want him kicked out? You do it.",
        "Holden: No. You're the one who has to decide that that's right for us, and then you have to do it.",
        "Lily: Why does this feel like an ultimatum?",
        "Holden: It's more of a crossroads for both of us. If you tell Craig to leave, we may still crash and burn. But if you don't, if you ignore what I want you to do, then I don't think that there is any hope for our marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Michaels: Barbara, this is Dr. Kitteredge. He'll be taking care of you now.",
        "Dr. Kitteredge: It's nice to meet you, Barbara. I'm looking forward to our work together. Now, I have a few things to go over with Dr. Michaels here, but I'll be back later, and we'll get acquainted then.",
        "Barbara: Nice to meet you.",
        "Dr. Michaels: If you do your part, Barbara, you'll make progress. But you have to be completely honest with yourself. That's the only way Dr. Kitteredge or any of us can give you the help you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You're gonna help me more than you know. Hi, I'm Barbara.",
        "Chuck: You ready for dinner?",
        "Barbara: Yes, thank you. Chuck -- Chuck, your name is Chuck. That's a very nice name. I was wondering, Chuck, if you might do a favor for me. There is a young patient here, a young man by the name of Will Munson. Could you get a message to him for me?",
        "Chuck: Sorry, ma'am. The staff has orders. You're to have no contact with him.",
        "Barbara: But I'm his mother. I don't want him to think that I've abandoned him. I want him to know that I'm here.",
        "Chuck: He can't know, ma'am. Is there anything else?",
        "Barbara: No, thank you. Damn you, Hal! Will? They said we couldn't see each other.",
        "Will: You just don't know how to work the system yet, Mom. But you'll learn.",
        "Barbara: Look at you. Look at you. Oh, God, I've missed you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know this is gonna sound crazy, but Parker knows things. He feels things. We were at the Water Park the other day, and he was convinced that he saw Jack there.",
        "Hal: And you know that that is impossible.",
        "Carly: Is it? How can you be so sure, Hal? We never even found a body.",
        "Hal: Carly, listen to me. Jack's car went through a guardrail and plunged over 100 feet into a river. Now, the crash alone was enough to kill him. And if that didn't do it --",
        "Carly: Would you please stop it?! I know all of that!",
        "Hal: Obviously you don't, or you wouldn't be standing there telling me there was a possibility that he was alive.",
        "Carly: Let me show you something. They take these souvenir pictures at the Water Park. Just look at it. I mean, it rained, so the face isn't clear. I know, but -- but doesn't it look like Jack? The arms, the hands, the shoulders.",
        "Hal: It's not him.",
        "Carly: How do you know? This could be proof that Jack is alive.",
        "Hal: All I see is a blur that looks like half the guys I know, Carly. And on the basis of this, you subjected my son to a psychic?",
        "Carly: I -- I didn't tell him who Toby was or what she did. I just said she was my friend.",
        "Hal: And that she would help him find Jack.",
        "Carly: I never said that. But talking to Toby didn't hurt Parker one bit.",
        "Hal: How do you know what kind of damage you've done? If our son is in trouble, you send him to a therapist, or you send him to a psychiatrist, not some damn psychic!",
        "Carly: Don't tell me what to do, Hal. What if Parker is right?",
        "Hal: Well, he's not right, because Jack is dead, and I will not have you doing to our son what Barbara has done to Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jack: Are you gonna stay?",
        "Julia: Yeah. I'm not gonna go anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All this nonsense about the possibility that Jack might be alive? It stops right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, now, look at this. Imagine us running into you and your sister. What a small world, huh?",
        "Nikki: Small town.",
        "Henry: Yeah, let's order another round. What do you say? Bartender?",
        "Jennifer: You know, you guys go ahead. I'm gonna get going.",
        "Nikki: I think I'm with you.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I guess I better take off, too.",
        "Henry: Yeah, let's all go.",
        "Nikki: Where?",
        "Henry: To Mike -- to Mike's place. You got beer in the fridge, right? Great, great.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks. Thanks anyway, but you know, I've had a rough few days, and I -- I am fighting off a headache.",
        "Henry: Oh, you know what? But you know, does Mike have some aspirin and some ibuprofen. He's got the works. It's a great little cabin in the woods. You're gonna get there, kick off your shoes, lay back in the old recliner, and that headache will be gone in no time. Come on, don't say no.",
        "Nikki: You guys, could you give us a second?",
        "Mike: Sure, you take all the time that you need.",
        "Nikki: You know what? You're going with me over to Mike's.",
        "Jennifer: Why? No. I'm a mess. I'll start crying.",
        "Nikki: How could anyone cry when Henry Coleman's around?",
        "Jennifer: Well, he's definitely into you.",
        "Nikki: Look, they're nice guys. They're fun to hang out with. They'll help you get over you know who. Now, maybe we can even convince them to get involved in the Rock the Vote campaign.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I don't know, Nikki.",
        "Nikki: Look, and if Jordan -- we run into Jordan Sinclair, and he asks you what you did tonight, you can say you hung out with a couple cute guys.",
        "Mike: I'm not sitting around making small talk with Jennifer while you make goo-goo eyes at Nikki, okay? And besides, I've got plans.",
        "Henry: With who?",
        "Mike: There is a game on --",
        "Henry: That is pitiful.",
        "Mike: No, no, Henry, take them out someplace.",
        "Henry: I can't go someplace with a lot of colored lights and a lot of noise, Mike. I need someplace private where Nikki and I can relax and get to know one another.",
        "Mike: Okay, get to know one another at your place.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: You're right, I would. I -- it's just since Katie left, I've -- I've been so lonely. And who has the energy to clean and --",
        "Mike: You just brought up Katie to make me feel guilty.",
        "Henry: I have always helped you with her, haven't I?",
        "Mike: Yeah, look how that turned out.",
        "Nikki: Hey, guys, how about we meet you over there, okay? Are we still on?",
        "Mike: Yeah -- I was gonna give you directions, but the route gets kind of tricky at night, so why don't you just follow me there, okay? My car's right outside.",

        "Barbara: Now, when have I ever let you down?",
        "Will: Never. And I'm not gonna let you down, either. We both need to get out of here, and I think I have an idea how.",

        "Jack: Yeah?",

        "Carly: You -- you are twisting this, Hal.",
        "Hal: Okay, so Barbara does it intentionally and you don't. But for you not only to allow but to encourage Parker's fantasies about Jack, it's just as unhealthy, Carly.",

        "Hal: It's delusional, Carly! What happens when Jack doesn't come back?! Oh, you really are buying into this, aren't you?",
