        "Damian makes plans with Meg for a picnic, as he goes to change, he runs into Luke, who is anxiously awaiting Noah's return. Luke becomes saddened when he sees Damian in a shirt that looks like his dad's. Lily is boxing up some of Holden's belongings to bring to Emma for her church, but she is having a hard time with it, as Natalie joins her and wants to keep one of Holden's shirt, like Lily did. Mason and Noah arrive home early happily still talking about their trip to California. Mason wants to spend more time together, but Noah thinks he should go see Luke, but Mason convinces him they can talk more about his script over coffee. Holden has a dream of Lily, which turns into a nightmare, when he realizes he can't get to her because he is shackled. He awakens and tries to convince Maeve to get a message to Lily because he is willing to make a deal; he will tell her where the money is, if she lets him out of the chains. She won't do it without Ebb's knowledge. When Ebb comes into the room, Holden convinces them that he knows where the money is and the only way he will tell is if they unchain him. Lily struggles with her decision to give away some of Holden's belongings and ends up at the pond where she sees Damian in a shirt that resembles Holden's and assumes it is Holden coming back. When she sees it is not he, she faints. Damian tends to Lily when Meg arrives. She is annoyed but tries to hide it until after Lily leaves. However, after Lily leaves, Meg calls Damian on his feelings for Lily; she thinks that she might be in the way because she feels his feelings have been rekindled now that Holden is gone. Damian tries to convince her that she is wrong, but he finally tells her that maybe some time apart might help her get her feelings clearer. Luke is not pleased to find Noah and Mason casually hanging out without telling him they took an earlier flight. By themselves, Luke is short and sarcastic with Noah at first, but Noah is able to get through to him and assure him that he has nothing to be jealous about. Luke feels better, but it is short lived when they are embracing and Mason shows up. Luke tries to hide his displeasure and afterwards, Mason watches Luke and Noah leave.",
        "Lily and Emma talk about losing Holden, as Lily can't seem how to move forward. After feeling better, Lily heads home just before Meg comes home and admits to Emma that she and Damian broke up because of Lily. Emma actually advises her that she is overreacting and she should call Damian, as Meg realizes she might have, but she wants Damian to call her instead. Holden pretends to find the place where the supposed money is buried but he tricks Ebb into leaning over the hole; he knocks Ebb out with a shovel. Holden tries to convince Maeve to let him have the keys to the car so he can get back to his family. Maeve is torn but trains the gun on Holden until Ebb awakens and he takes the gun back after Maeve looks like she was considering helping Holden. Ebb punches and kicks Holden and then orders Maeve to help him back to the cabin. Later, he tells Maeve that Holden will receive no more food until he admits to where the money is; he dies unless he tells them where it is. Damian goes to see Lily under the guise of checking on her, but soon he is sharing with her that Meg and he broke up because she thinks he is still interested in her. Lily urges her to reconcile with Meg, but Damian tells her that he can't because Meg is right; his feelings are as strong as ever. Upon hearing this, Lily orders Damian to leave her house."

        "Damian: Luciano.",
        "Luke: Noah's flight gets in in a couple of hours. I was sick of staring at the clock.",
        "Damian: I'm glad to see you.",
        "Luke: Well, I wondered if, um, maybe I still had a job.",
        "Damian: Of course you do. Are you ready to come back to work?",

        "Damian: I just want you to take as much time as you need to, okay?",

        "Damian: Look, I'm getting ready to meet Meg for lunch. I can't bring you up to speed right now.",
        "Luke: well, that's okay. I can look at the manifest, see what's going on.",
        "Damian: Good. Sit at my desk while I change.",
        "Luke: So, I take it Meg's doing a little better?",
        "Damian: I think so. What about you?",
        "[Luke chuckles]",
        "Luke: I'm just counting the minutes until Noah gets back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Thanks for the ride from the airport.",
        "Mason: Oh, just trying to make this trip last as long as we can, huh?",
        "Noah: I know what you mean. It was amazing.",
        "Mason: Yeah. What do you say we go grab a coffee and see if we can buy a couple more minutes?",
        "Noah: Uh, should call Luke.",
        "Mason: Oh, he doesn't even know you're back yet, right?",
        "Noah: No. I didn't get a chance to let him know that we caught an earlier flight.",
        "Mason: The only thing that made sense, right?",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Mason: After that party? What a party. Oh, no time to sleep. It was worth it, right?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Oh, it was awesome. That house was so cool.",
        "Mason: Yeah. The only place to live in L.A. is the Hollywood Hills, huh?",
        "Noah: I hear that.",
        "Mason: Yeah. Look, I really do got to load up on some caffeine, or I'm never going to make it through this faculty meeting.",
        "Noah: Did you sleep on the plane?",
        "Mon: Not enough. Hey, these media arts professors, they can be a rough crowd, really. As soon as they hear I'm back from L.A., they're going to be all, you know, \"Oh, back in the good-old days, I almost had a deal with Brad Pitt.\"",
        "Noah: I almost had a deal with Jude Law.",
        "Mason: Yeah, it's too bad he passed. But the fact that he wanted to meet you is huge. And maybe the next time he needs a writer, he'll think of you.",
        "Noah: Oh, how cool would that be?",
        "Mason: Very cool.",
        "Noah: Wow.",
        "Mason: In the meantime, we should make a list of all the actors who'd be right for that role and let them know that Jude Law is interested.",
        "Noah: But he's not.",
        "Mason: But he was. And by the time they find out that he's not anymore, they'll be in love with your script.",
        "Noah: Wait. That doesn't really work.",
        "Mason: I don't know. It might. Oh, and I got an idea about a casting idea thing. We should talk about it.",
        "Noah: Well, what is it?",
        "Mason: Buy me a coffee. I'll tell you all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You really are counting the minutes, huh?",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I can't believe I let Noah go away and miss my father funeral.",
        "Damian: That was very unselfish.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, next time I try to do something unselfish, rend me not to.",
        "[Damian laughs]",
        "Damian: Something wrong?",
        "Luke: It's the shirt.",
        "Damian: Too casual?",
        "Luke: No. My dad had the same one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, Sweetie. I didn't hear you. You want me to make you some breakfast?",
        "Natalie: Mommy, why are you wearing Daddy's shirt?",
        "Lily: Oh, Baby, it makes me feel close to him. I put some of your daddy's things in this box to give to Grandma Emma to take to her church. They keep a big box there for people who don't have money to but the things that they need.",
        "Natalie: Can I have one of Daddy's shirts, too?",
        "Lily: Sure you can. Hey, better yet, how about this? Doesn't that feel good? It smells like Daddy, too.",

        "Holden: So it's just us?",
        "Lily: For a while, at least.",
        "Holden: Well, let's not waste any time. Mm.",
        "Lily: Mm.",

        "Holden: Lily, wait.",
        "Lily: Holden, come upstairs.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden gasps]",
        "Holden: Oh, no. No. Maeve. Maeve! Maeve, I need to talk to you.",
        "Maeve: Stop the hollering. Are you trying to wake the dead?",
        "Holden: Did you mean what you said?",
        "Maeve: About what?",
        "Holden: If I tell you where Skaggs hid the money, will you tell my wife that I'm all right?",
        "Maeve: Are you saying you're ready to talk?",
        "Holden: Will you call her?",
        "Maeve: I thought you didn't know anything about the money.",
        "Holden: No, I do know.",
        "Maeve: You lied to us, then.",
        "Holden: O -- only because I wanted to keep the money for myself.",
        "Maeve: Eb said that.",
        "Holden: Well, you know what? None of that matters to me. All that matters is that I know where the money is, and I'm ready to show you.",
        "Maeve: All right, let me get this straight. First you tell me you never met Skaggs before in your life, and now you're telling me you know where he hid the money?",
        "Holden: I -- I was buying time so I didn't have to share the profits. Can you blame me?",
        "Maeve: You shouldn't have lied.",
        "Holden: You're right, because money's not important, especially when you stack it up against family. What's important is that my family knows that I'm alive. I need to get word to them, and then I will do anything you say.",
        "Maeve: How do I know you're not telling me all this 'cause you want me to let them know?",
        "Holden: I'm not Skaggs. I'm an honest guy.",
        "Maeve: Who goes around lying?",
        "Holden: I was trapped in a bad situation. I didn't know if I could trust you. But now I do.",
        "Maeve: You're just trying to sweet-talk me.",
        "Holden: All right, fine. You know, you and Eb do what you need. You -- you want to be stuck in this place forever?",
        "Maeve: Why wouldn't I want to be stuck here? This is my home.",
        "Holden: Think about it, Maeve. You take that money, you can buy yourself 100 acres, and all it's going to cost is one phone call.",
        "Maeve: I need to talk this over with Eb.",
        "Holden: No, no. You know what he'll say.",
        "Maeve: Well, maybe he's right.",
        "Holden: Maeve, listen. The cops -- they probably found my truck by now. Lily -- she's probably thinking that I'm dead.",
        "Maeve: Look, look, it's not that I don't feel for your wife. I do.",
        "Holden: What you need to do is just go into town and just make that one call.",
        "Maeve: Eb won't like it.",
        "Holden: He doesn't have to know.",
        "Maeve: So, now you want to make me a liar, just like you?",
        "Holden: You're not lying. Not if he doesn't know about it, it'll just rile him up.",
        "Maeve: All the more reason why I shouldn't.",
        "Holden: Maeve, Maeve, you saved me! You need to look out for me.",
        "Maeve: Seems to me it should be the other way around.",
        "Holden: You're a good person, Maeve. Good people, they do the right thing. So, what's it going to be? You just going to stand by and do nothing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why do we have to give Daddy's clothes away?",
        "Lily: Because I think it'll be good for the people that need them, and -- maybe it'll be good for us, too -- to make it more real that he's gone. But you can hold onto it for as long as you'd like. I think your daddy will really like it that you want to have it.",
        "Natalie: Then I'm keeping it forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: You want your wife to know you're okay? Take me and Eb to the money.",
        "Holden: Maeve --",
        "Maeve: That's the only way.",
        "Holden: If Lily doesn't know I'm alive, what's to keep you and Eb from killing me once you get the money?",
        "Maeve: We're not murderers.",
        "Holden: Not you. But he's the one running the show.",
        "Maeve: Maybe you ought to make your deal with Eb, then.",
        "Holden: Maeve --",
        "Maeve: Eb! Eb, get in here! Holden has something he wants to say to you.",
        "Eb: Make it quick.",
        "Holden: All right. All right, fine. I know where the money is.",
        "Eb: You don't say?",
        "Holden: I knew Skaggs. I knew him in prison. I got out first, and, uh, he offered me your share of the bank job if I helped him break out. He told me where the money was.",
        "Eb: You know the exact spot?",
        "Holden: I can take you there.",
        "Eb: No. You can draw me a map.",
        "Holden: No, no. You'll -- you'll never find it. No, Skaggs was evil, but he was smart. There's -- there's nothing to mark the site.",
        "Eb: This better not be another lie.",
        "Holden: Hey, come on, Eb. You're the one with the gun here. But it has to be this way. You want your money, you got to cut me loose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I just came back from L.A. I met all these actors and now I'm talking about casting? It almost seems real.",
        "Mason: It is real. Look, Noah, three-quarters of being in this business is believing you're in the business. You're in the business.",
        "Noah: It still sounds amazing to me. And it's all thanks to you.",
        "Mason: I had a really great time, too. You're a fun guy to hang out with.",
        "Noah: Yeah, you too",
        "Mason: I should be going.",
        "Noah: Hey. Thanks again, you know, for everything.",
        "Mason: Sure. Um --",
        "[Noah chuckles]",
        "Luke: Noah?",
        "Noah: Luke! I was just coming find you.",
        "Luke: I thought you were coming in later.",
        "Noah: We caught an earlier flight. The trip was amazing. Wait until you hear who we met.",
        "Luke: Wait. I -- I don't get it.",
        "[Luke chuckles]",
        "Luke: What are you doing here?",

        "Emma: Hey, Meg. What's this?",
        "Meg: Uh -- it's for a picnic.",
        "Emma: Oh. Oh, are you taking the kids?",
        "Meg: Uh, no. Um, Eliza and Damian.",
        "Emma: Oh.",
        "Meg: I -- I thought it would be good to get out of the house for a little while.",
        "Emma: Yeah. Sounds nice.",
        "Meg: Would you like to come, Mama?",
        "Emma: With you and Damian?",
        "[Emma chucks]",
        "Meg: What? It's a beautiful day outside.",
        "Emma: Is it, Sweetheart, I don't think so.",
        "Meg: Okay, then you know what? I will stay here with you if you want.",
        "Emma: No, you won't.",
        "Meg: Damian will understand.",
        "Emma: I'm sure he will. I'm sure he will. But I don't want you to stay here and spend your whole day trying to cheer me up.",
        "Meg: I'm not. I -- I know you're feeling alone now that Seth and Aaron left.",
        "Emma: Oh, Meg, please. Why don't you just go? Just go and have a good time. I tell you what. I'll keep Eliza, okay? She and I will have our own little picnic. It's a beautiful day someone said it was a beautiful day. They told me it was a beautiful day. We'll be fine.",
        "Meg: You sure?",
        "Emma: I am positive. I'm glad you're doing something nice for yourself.",
        "Meg: It's just a picnic.",
        "Emma: So things are, uh -- ok between you and Damian?",
        "Meg: I think things are back to the way they were before.",
        "Emma: Well, that's -- what we all should have and all should do -- get back to normal. Holden would like that.",

        "Luke: I was just on the way to the airport.",
        "Noah: Oh, well, Mason offered me a ride so I just figured I'd save you the trip.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, yeah, great. So, um, how was your trip?",
        "Noah: It was unbelievable. It was -- it was amazing. I met Jude Law.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah. Does he want to do your film?",
        "Noah: No, no. He really liked the script, though. And it was great just to get the chance to meet him. And then last night, we went to this amazing party in the Hollywood Hills. I mean, there were all these stars there. I met Seth Rogan.",
        "Luke: Cool.",
        "Mason: All right, well, uh, you two obviously need to catch up, and I really should get going. I got that faculty meeting and all that. So, I'll see you later.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Hey, thank you again.",

        "Luke: See ya.",
        "Noah: God, I missed you so much.",
        "Luke: Well, I bet partying with all those actors helped ease the pain.",
        "Noah: Okay. What's the problem?",
        "Luke: There's no problem.",
        "Noah: Really? 'Cause you don't seem thrilled to see me.",
        "Luke: Oh, Noah. You know that's not it. It's just --ell, how was I supposed to know that you were coming back earlier if you didn't call me? You know, I -- I was going to get a Grimaldi car so we could drive back from the airport in style. But I guess after frolicking in the Hollywood Hills --",
        "Noah: Okay. I wasn't frolicking, Luke. And I'm sorry I blew your surprise, but I mean, I didn't know about it.",
        "Luke: I know that",
        "Noah: Why are you so ticked off at me?",
        "Luke: I'm not!",
        "Noah: Luke, I -- I know your moods, okay, better than anybody.",
        "Luke: Look, I am good. I promise.",

        "Damian: Lily, you all right?",
        "Lily: Yeah, yeah. I just -- I got a little disoriented.",
        "Damian: Lily, I think you lost consciousness. You should be checked by a doctor.",
        "Lily: No. I -- I'm okay. I'm just --",
        "Damian: Just just here.",
        "Lily: -- Dizzy.",

        "Lily: That shirt.",
        "Damian: I had it for a while. Why?",
        "Lily: No reason.",
        "Damian: Luke told me Holden had one just like it.",
        "Lily: He did. It was his favorite.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have worn it. I'll get rid of it.",
        "Lily: No, don't be silly. You don't have to.",
        "Damian: Stay down, Lily. Rest a little longer.",
        "Lily: I'm okay.",
        "Meg: Damian. I didn't know Lily was joining us on the picnic.",
        "Lily: I didn't know there was a picnic. I just came down to the pond to cool off.",
        "Damian: She got so dizzy a minute ago, she blacked out. I'm trying to convince her to see a doctor, but she keeps saying she's fine.",
        "Lily: I am fine, okay? It -- it was probably just the heat.",
        "Meg: Well, if you did pass out, Damian's right. You probably need some time to get your bearings.",
        "Lily: Thanks, but I don't want to intrude.",
        "Meg: You're not.",
        "Lily: You know, I -- I really should get going.",
        "Damian: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm fine. Enjoy your picnic.",
        "Damian: I'm wearing a shirt that resembles one of Holden's. For a minute, she seemed to think that I --",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Damian: She called me \"Holden.\" Then she realized I wasn't him, and that's why she fainted.",
        "Meg: Into your arms?",
        "Damian: What's wrong?",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: Thing. Just every time we're together, there she is.",
