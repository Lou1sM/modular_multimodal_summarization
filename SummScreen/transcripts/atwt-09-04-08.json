        "Brad: Oh, Man, it happened again.",
        "Katie: It's just a dream. It's just a dream.",
        "Brad: He just grabbed onto me like a -- like a death grip, trying to pull me in with him. I wasn't trying to drown him, Katie.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Brad: I was just trying to scare him. Oh, boy. Now he's in a coma, and I'm in hell.",
        "Katie: You need to talk to someone.",
        "Brad: You mean Jack?",
        "Katie: He's your brother. He can help.",
        "Brad: He's a cop, Katie. If I tell him, he's gonna lock me up and throw away the key.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Jack, have you talked to your brother? He must really feel rotten about going after Parker the way he did.",
        "Jack: He does.",
        "Margo: How is Parker doing?",
        "Jack: He's pretty -- he's shaken up. But he's doing better now that Liberty knows that he wasn't the one who attacked her.",
        "Margo: Oh, good. How are you doing?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: A little spent after the whole ordeal. Hey, listen, any news on the Morrissey case?",
        "Margo: Well, we're not gonna know anything until he comes out of the coma.",
        "Jack: That expected to happen soon?",
        "Margo: Jack, given the oxygen deprivation, the doctors aren't sure he'll wake up at all. So, of course, his father is after the department to find out what happened.",
        "Jack: Do we have anything?",
        "Margo: Well, we traced the 911 call to the phone near where he was found, but the question is, who made the call?",
        "Jack: Right, right. Any theories?",
        "Margo: Good Samaritan? Would-be murderer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What can I get you to eat?",
        "Liberty: You look like you're -- you're wearing half the menu. Mom, did you sleep in that?",
        "Janet: Um, maybe. Look, I think it's time that you know that I've decided to move out of Emma's.",
        "Liberty: You decided? Or Jack kicked you out?",
        "Janet: I came to that decision on my own.",
        "Liberty: Right. It's because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You really think whoever saved Leo Morrissey tried to kill him first?",
        "Margo: Well, maybe their conscience got the better of them. Uh, you know, Jack, I've got Dallas on this case, but if you're interested, I could easily put you on.",
        "Jack: No, no. Dallas has got it. I got a big caseload, so --",
        "Margo: All right. Well, you just let me know if you change your mind.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: Hey, you got a minute?",
        "Jack: Please tell me this has nothing to do with Parker.",
        "Carly: It's about your brother.",
        "Jack: Come on -- in here.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Jack: What about him?",
        "Carly: Well, I kept telling myself that this is nothing, but I just can't shake this feeling.",
        "Jack: What feeling?",
        "Carly: I think that Brad had something to do with that kid ending up in the Reservoir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Why can't you let this go?",
        "Katie: Because you can't.",
        "Brad: Do you know what would happen if I went public with this? Kim would fire me. My career would be over. So would yours.",
        "Katie: You won't have a career if you keep this up. You couldn't even go in today, you were so messed up.",
        "Brad: Look, I just -- I need some time.",
        "Katie: You really think you're gonna forget? A young man is in a coma.",
        "Brad: I know that! But nothing I say or don't say is going to help him recover.",
        "Katie: Maybe not, but it might help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What makes you think Brad had anything to do with this?",
        "Carly: I went to the hospital looking for Dallas, and I saw Brad sneaking into that Leo's room.",
        "Jack: Sneaking?",
        "Carly: Yeah! He was looking over his shoulder. He clearly didn't want anyone to see him. I think that's sneaking.",
        "Jack: And what did he do once he was in there?",
        "Carly: Mostly he just stood there. But I swear, Jack, that I heard him say, \"I'm sorry.\"",
        "Jack: Maybe he was -- he was thinking of Liberty, like he was sorry for Leo and Leo better be sorry that he ever touched --",
        "Carly: No, no, Jack. He didn't look angry. He looked guilty.",
        "Jack: Hey, Brad -- Brad may be a bonehead, but he's got a -- he's got a good heart. There's no way he would -- that he would put someone in a coma.",
        "Carly: Jack, what is going on here? You are usually the first person to assume that your brother is up to something.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and you're usually the first person to tell me that I'm quick to judge.",
        "Carly: He accused our son of rape! He was completely out of control. Obviously, there is something going on here that you're not telling me, and I want to know what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, what -- what are you doing?",
        "Holden: I should have called. Sorry.",
        "Lily: Yeah, or knocked.",
        "Mike: Are you okay?",
        "Lily: My husband just saw me naked with another man.",
        "Mike: You're separated. And we weren't doing anything wrong.",
        "Lily: We weren't?",
        "Mike: No. The kids are at school. We're two consenting adults.",
        "Lily: You -- you weren't embarrassed at all?",
        "Mike: More for Holden than for us.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I got to go.",
        "Mike: Wait, what is the problem?",
        "Lily: There isn't one. It's just this isn't gonna stop Holden from making a big deal out of this.",
        "Mike: So let him. He doesn't have a leg to stand on and he knows it.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This is weird.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: You -- lying. You stink at it, by the way.",
        "Jack: Carly, I got a lot of work to do --",
        "Carly: Why are you dodging this?",
        "Jack: I just don't think there's anything to it.",
        "Carly: What would Margo think?",
        "Jack: Don't go to Margo with this, please. And I'd appreciate it if you forgot what you saw, okay?",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: Carly -- Carly, let it go. And don't tell anybody else about this, please.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: That's it?",
        "Carly: You asked me not to, so I won't --",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: After all the times you covered for me, Jack, it's the least I can do. Um, just keep in mind what you always told me. Be careful keeping secrets, Jack. They usually come back to bite you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You had nothing to do with my moving out. It was time, that's all.",
        "Liberty: Mom, are you and Jack over?",
        "Janet: Honey, we just have different priorities right now.",
        "Liberty: So he was mad.",
        "Janet: Look, we were moving too fast, anyway, and what happened with you and Parker was the wake-up call that I needed.",
        "Liberty: Mom, what are you gonna do now?",
        "Janet: I'm -- I'm gonna do what I've always wanted to do. I'm gonna find a place of my own.",
        "Liberty: No, you can't live alone, Mom. You can't live alone. You hate being alone.",
        "Janet: Come on, Honey. And besides, all those people going in and out of Emma's. It was getting really old.",
        "Liberty: You said that was your favorite part.",
        "Janet: Do you want something to eat or can I get you something? What? What do you want?",
        "Liberty: Okay, um, coffee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What's up?",
        "Jack: Can I come in?",
        "Brad: Yeah, sure. It's not Parker, is it? I mean, he's okay.",
        "Jack: Parker's gonna be all right.",
        "Brad: Jack, I feel horrible. I should've at least given him the benefit of the doubt before going for his throat.",
        "Jack: I know, it's hard, especially when everything you hear points to the same thing.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but he's my nephew --",
        "Jack: I'm not talking about Parker. I need to know exactly what happened the night Leo Morrissey ended up in the Reservoir.",
        "Brad: You told him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brian: I took the liberty of coming out ahead of time and setting things up, make sure we have everything we need.",
        "Luke: Looks like sleepy and grumpy were working overtime.",
        "Lucinda: A foundation meeting and then all of this. You just have been such a busy bee.",
        "Brian: I didn't want you waiting around while we men unloaded the gear.",
        "Luke: Nice touch.",
        "Brian: You and Noah can set up that tent up over there. I'll take care of this one.",
        "Luke: Two tents?",
        "Lucinda: Two tents. That's good. Two tents is great. Well, now, what can I do to help?",
        "Brian: I can handle this. You just sit right here and relax.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll relax. You know, I never would have imagined that you're such an outdoorsman.",
        "Brian: It's the shirt.",
        "Luke: Next thing you know, he's gonna be saying that they should share a sleeping bag just to keep warm.",
        "Noah: I am surprised they're sharing a tent. I mean, with us right here, it's a little in your face.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Do you think I should do something?",
        "Noah: Lucinda would kill you.",
        "Luke: So what, I should just let him take her, so to speak?",
        "Noah: I'm not sure you have much of a choice. But look on the bright side. While Brian is lulling Lucinda to sleep with tales of mushrooms past, you and I will be alone together under the stars.",
        "Luke: I like the way you think.",
        "Noah: I like the way you do a lot of things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, don't run off like this.",
        "Holden: What do you want? Should I come back and join you guys for coffee? I really don't think I'm dressed for it.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on. We agreed we'd be civilized about this.",
        "Holden: You know, Aaron and I wondered why you ran off so fast. I guess you were chomping at the bit to get back to the love shack, huh?",
        "Lily: You have no right to be angry with me. I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Holden: Lily, look, I know we're not together anymore and that you're with Mike, but you really don't need to throw this in my face, okay?",
        "Lily: I had no idea that you were coming over, Holden.",
        "Holden: Yeah, obviously.",
        "Lily: Well, better I was at my home than in a cabin two doors down from our daughters and their fellow campers.",
        "Holden: I can't do this right now.",
        "Lily: Wait. You said that you wanted to tell me something.",
        "Holden: Forget about it. You're busy.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I am busy -- moving on with my life.",
        "Holden: Yeah, with your new boyfriend.",
        "Lily: Mike is a part of that life, yes, whether you like it or not. So the next time you show up at my house or my life unexpected, prepare to see him there.",
        "Holden: Thanks for the heads-up.",
        "Lily: Here's another one. He's coming with me to Aaron and Alison's wedding. So if you have a problem with that, keep it to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I went to Jack because I love you and you need help. I knew once you had a chance to think about it, you would go yourself.",
        "Brad: So, you couldn't just wait for me? You had to just beat me to the punch?",
        "Katie: I knew if we waited too long, it would be too late. I did it to protect you.",
        "Jack: I wanted to kill that creep myself when I found out what he did to Parker, but vigilante justice, Brad --",
        "Brad: I wasn't trying to kill him. I just wanted to scare him.",
        "Jack: It's still assault -- and manslaughter if he dies.",
        "Brad: So, we're talking -- we're talking prison here, right? But you're my brother. You won't let that happen, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brian: So, I know you're accustomed to a certain level of luxury, so I brought a few extra items to make you feel more at home.",
        "Lucinda: That's really considerate. Now, okay -- wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do we do with these?",
        "Brian: Well, anywhere on the rug is good.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, excuse me. Where are you going?",
        "Brian: Well, to the men's tent, of course -- unless you need something else.",
        "Lucinda: No. Nothing.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Noah: Bah!",
        "Luke: You know, that is not how you set up a tent.",
        "Noah: Oh, really? It's not in the Boy Scout manual?",
        "Luke: No, it's not. And you know what else isn't in the manual?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Brian: Hi.",
        "Luke: Hi. Is, uh -- is something wrong with Grandmother?",
        "Brian: No, she's great. She's all set up. Mind if I unroll on this side?",
        "Luke: Oh, you're -- you're sleeping in here?",
        "Brian: Yeah, a lady needs her privacy. In case you're wondering, I don't snore. Is there a problem?",
        "Noah: No. No problem at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I thought Leo was gonna be fine. I thought he was gonna come up spitting cursing me out. I never thought -- I mean, seeing him lying there in the hospital bed -- that is a million miles from how it was supposed to be.",
        "Jack: I believe you.",
        "Brad: So, I mean -- I mean, is there any way out of this?",
        "Jack: The only way out is to confess.",
        "Brad: No way. No -- no way! No!",
        "Jack: If you don't turn yourself in, it's only a matter of time before they find you in an investigation.",
        "Katie: It's gonna be okay.",
        "Brad: No, it's not. No, they're gonna send me straight to prison.",
        "Jack: No, the fact that you went in after him and you tried to save his life -- that should speak in your favor.",
        "Katie: Is there anything you can do?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I can forget this conversation ever happened. I'm gonna go back to the station, and I will wait for you guys to show up. Then I will take your statement like it's the first time I've heard it. You have an hour. If you don't come in, I'm gonna have to come after you. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: You okay?",
        "Brad: No. I can't leave you. I can't go to prison.",
        "Katie: You're not going to. You don't have to. Jack said that the fact that you went in after him -- that's a good thing.",
        "Brad: Katie, I will get five years instead of 20.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I did not mean to make things worse. You've got to believe me.",
        "Brad: No. No, you didn't do anything. I am so sorry. I am so sorry for all of this. You didn't betray me. I betrayed you, and I promised that things were gonna get better -- that I was going to be a husband and not just a dad. And now it looks like I'm not gonna be here at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Oh, hey, I see one!",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Noah: Ahh.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling.",
        "Brian: Good job, Noah!",
        "Luke: Teacher's pet.",
        "Brian: Well, so now that you all know what you're looking for, I will meet you back at camp. I'll leave you to your hunting.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. You're gonna leave us?",
        "Brian: No, no. I thought I'd go back to camp and set up for dinner.",
        "Lucinda: I'll help you.",
        "Brian: Oh, God, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't dream of you missing out on all the fun. See you back at camp in about an hour. Happy hunting!",
        "Lucinda: And I thought I was gonna have a whimsical good time here. What am I gonna have? I'm gonna be -- I'm gonna be curled up on the cold, hard ground in a moldy tent!",
        "Noah: You guys are bumming me out.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, enough! I'm going back.",
        "Luke: You know what? I am right behind you.",
        "Noah: Wait! Did you guys notice anything about the clearing where we set up camp?",
        "Lucinda: No.",
        "Luke: What about it?",
        "Noah: Well, it didn't just come from nowhere. Somebody took the time and all the hard work to clear all the bushes and branches and rocks. So, not only did Brian come here early enough to do that by himself and save us from the grunt work, I think the least we can do is pick a few damn mushrooms.",
        "Lucinda: Ohh. That's sweet. I think you're right, Noah. Okay. If he's gonna work with us on the foundation, we're gonna work with him in the mushroom field.",
        "Luke: Okay, all right. But I am picking one, and then I'm done.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Mine! I see it! I got it.",
        "Noah: Oh, careful, Lucinda. That bush that your head is under -- I think it's full of --",
        "Lucinda: Ow!",
        "Noah: Brambles.",
        "Lucinda: Ow, ow! Ow! Ooh! Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Well, that was a mistake.",
        "Mike: I take it you found Holden.",
        "Lily: How is it he can have sex with my best friend while we're still married but I start seeing someone when we're not even together and somehow I'm the bad guy?",
        "Mike: What did he say?",
        "Lily: He said that I was rubbing us in his face.",
        "Mike: Well, seeing the woman you love with another man, even when you're not together, is never easy.",
        "Lily: He doesn't love me anymore.",
        "Mike: So, what did you say to him?",
        "Lily: I told him that you are a part of my life and that he'd better get used to it.",
        "Mike: How did that work for you?",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter. I mean, what's he going to do, make a scene when you show up next to me at Aaron's wedding?",
        "Mike: Yeah, about that --",
        "Lily: Believe me, if he says one word, one single, solitary word --",
        "Mike: Well, he won't -- if I don't show up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What are you doing out here?",
        "Carly: I went to see Jack about something. But it's still unresolved, so I came out here to think. You?",
        "Holden: I went to see Lily. Let's just say I wish I hadn't.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Holden: Doesn't matter.",
        "Carly: You know, there was a time you would have told me.",
        "Holden: I know that.",
        "Carly: So, can we pretend, just for a moment, that we're back in that time? Friends?",
        "Holden: I walked in on Lily -- naked with Mike.",
        "Carly: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It's not even that she was with some other guy.",
        "Carly: What, then?",
        "Holden: It's that she gets to be with whoever she wants to be with at home, at school, at family gatherings, and I have to accept that, and I can't do the same thing.",
        "Carly: We tried the public outing. It was a disaster.",
        "Holden: It wouldn't be like that now. Time has passed. Lily's living her life, and I should be able to live mine.",
        "Carly: Yes, you should.",
        "Holden: With you.",
        "Carly: You know that can't happen.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Carly: You know why.",
        "Holden: Every time I'm with you, everything just feels so right.",
        "Carly: Uh -- I got to go. You know what? I don't want this.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Carly: I don't want you kissing me because Lily might have a new boyfriend.",
        "Holden: That's not why I kissed you. Come on, Carly. You know that.",
        "Carly: I can't do this.",
        "Holden: You know what? I can't do it. I can't stop thinking about you. Every time -- I'm either driving to school or I'm driving to the store, I do everything I can to go out of my way, completely out of my way, just to avoid your house and not go there. Nothing works, Carly. You're in my heart. You're in my mind. All the time. Whenever I see you, I want to be with you. Tell me you don't want that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Weren't you the one that said we weren't doing anything wrong?",

        "Holden: Carly, your kids are resilient. They'll bounce back. My girls, they're fine seeing their mother with somebody else.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe that's because Lily didn't cheat on you with Mike while you were married. She didn't create a scandal with her best friend's husband.",
