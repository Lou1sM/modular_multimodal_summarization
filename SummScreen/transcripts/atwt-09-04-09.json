        "Craig arrives at Rosanna's to see Parker, but Rosanna lets him know that he is not welcome. Parker is reluctant to come downstairs because Craig and Rosanna are arguing. Craig tells Parker that they have a meeting, but Parker refuses to go to the meeting because he is meeting Liberty. Excitedly, Janet comes downstairs to go college hunting with Liberty, but Liberty is less than enthusiastic about college hunting. There is a knock on the door and it is Teri. Teri lets Janet know that she had been fired. Henry arrives at Audrey's and finds the lawyer. Parker meets up with Liberty. Teri, reluctantly, lets Janet know that Liberty is pregnant. Rosanna, Janet and Teri end up at Craig's apartment looking for Liberty, but she is already gone to an abortion clinic. At the clinic, the doctor makes sure that Liberty has been alerted to all of the facts. Janet and Teri go looking for Liberty at the clinic."

        "Craig: Trust me, you've already done that. And I'm not here to get slapped again, either, delightful as that was. I'm here to see Parker.",

        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: That's a good opportunity for you to make an impression on the recruiters.",
        "Liberty: And how am I supposed to do that, Mom?",
        "Janet: Okay. Come prepared, ask questions that show your interest in the school, and let them know what a special person you are.",
        "Liberty: You're such a dork. Where did you get at from?",

        "Janet: A website for parents whose kids are thinking about going to college.",
        "Liberty: Well, you're not one of those parents, 'cause I'm not one of those kids.",
        "Jan: What are you talking about?",
        "Liberty: I'm just not ready to start thinking about it yet.",
        "Janet: Honey, a few days ago, you couldn't wait to go look at colleges with Mackenzie. It's all you've been talking about for months.",

        "Parker: I could hear you two going at it from upstairs, and I really don't want any part of it.",
        "Rosanna: Satisfied?",
        "Craig: No. If you heard us talking down here, then you also heard me tell your aunt that we need to put aside our differences so we can focus on business.",
        "Parker: Which neither of you can do.",
        "Craig: I certainly can.",
        "Rosanna: Parker doesn't trust you anymore.",
        "Craig: Is that true?",
        "Parker: I just don't want to get caught in the middle of this.",
        "Craig: Oh, it looks like someone -- it looks like somebody has already put you there.",
        "Rosanna: Well, he had a right to know that you were using him to cover your tracks.",

        "Parker: You know what? I really don't have time for this.",
        "Craig: You're right. We have a meeting to get to.",
        "Parker: There is a college fair at school that I told Liberty I'd go with her to, so you'll just have to hale the meeting without me. Have fun.",

        "Vienna: Oh, my God. Thank you for coming.",
        "Katie: I was on my way to checkup, but you sounded so upset.",
        "Vienna: It's Henry.",
        "Katie: Was he arrested?",
        "Vienna: No, not yet.",
        "Katie: I figured the lawyer would have told the police by now that Henry and Audrey tied him up in the boiler room.",
        "Vienna: Katie! Do you want the whole town to know?",
        "Katie: They're all gonna know. They're all gonna find out when they see him in handcuffs.",
        "Vienna: Well, they have not been handcuffed yet.",
        "Katie: Maybe the -- the lawyer decided not to talk.",

        "Katie: Has Henry talked to a lawyer of his own?",
        "Vienna: No, he doesn't want to talk to anyone about what happened until he finds out what James is going to do.",
        "Katie: Maybe he's right. Maybe the lawyer won't talk.",
        "Vienna: You know, and that won't matter if James has something worse planned, and it's all Audrey's fault.",
        "Katie: I hope Henry's staying far away from her.",
        "Vienna: Oh, God, I hope so, too.",

        "Henry: You fed him yet?",
        "Audrey: I tried, but he started screaming for help.",

        "Henry: That was the wrong answer.",

        "James: Hansen, where the hell are you? You have to sign that revised will. I mean, I have already told Paul he's my only heir and Henry Coleman gets nothing. Don't make a liar out me, Counselor. I don't have much time.",

        "Henry: Uh, if you are talking about what I think you are talking about, then you need to stop talking about that.",
        "Audrey: Well, it has to happen.",
        "Henry: No. What did I just say?",
        "Audrey: Look, if James doesn't die, then he's alive long enough to sign that new will!",
        "Henry: Enough, enough, enough.",
        "Audrey: Listen to m we need the money. We'll get the money when he's dead, and I can pay off Ray, and you will get millions!",
        "Henry: I -- I don't care about any that!",
        "Audrey: Yes, you do! Of course you do! You want millions and millions!",
        "Henry: No, I don't! I do not. I don't care, okay? I may be a Stenbeck, but I am not a killer.",
        "Audrey: You can be.",

        "Craig: You actually told that boy your paranoid fantasies about me and Teri.",
        "Rosanna: Please. Not in any detail.",
        "Craig: I'm engaged to his mother.",
        "Rosanna: Carly is going to know everything.",
        "Craig: Why would you do that?",
        "Rosanna: Because my sister deserves to know what kind of man she's really dealing with.",
        "Craig: If I were doing the things you think I am, sure. But I'm not. So how does it help Carly's recovery to make baseless accusation against me?",
        "Rosanna: I don't think my accusations are that baseless, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, let's see. Uh, Teri's not pregnant. Teri and I aren't sleeping together. And Teri and I intend to keep it that way. So --",
        "Rosanna: Guess what? I don't believe you.",
        "Craig: You just don't want to.",
        "Rosanna: No, I just know you too well.",

        "Craig: So, you got all your bases covered, then.",
        "Rosanna: I sure do. And guess what I care more about my sister than you certainly do.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: You don't care about your sister.",
        "Rosanna: You bet I care about her. How dare you say that I don't?",
        "Craig: You're just looking for a way to get back at me. Your sister needs love and support, not to be dragged into a war over the past!",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you'd like it to be past, wouldn't you?",
        "Craig: You should want that, ok! Hasn't it consumed enough of your life?",
        "Rosanna: Don't need life lessons from you!",
        "Craig: I think maybe you do.",
        "Rosanna: You know, maybe -- maybe you're right. Maybe we all need to get over the past, including me.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: But I think the best way to do that is to get rid of you.",

        "Janet: Why did she fire you?",
        "Teri: I'm not really sure myself.",
        "Janet: I'm surprised. It seems so out of the blue, right?",
        "Teri: Right.",
        "Liberty: I got to go.",
        "Janet: Oh, right, right. Oh, it's -- it's college day. Listen to me. I want you to come home right after school, 'cause I want to hear all about it, okay?",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm. I'm so sorry about your job.",
        "Janet: So, what did she say when she fired you?",
        "Teri: Uh, she said that she didn't need me now that the kids are going back to school. I mean, maybe she's right, you know? They're gonna be busy, and Carly's gonna be back soon, so --",
        "Janet: And she won't let you stay at the house?",
        "Teri: The deal was I could stay there as long as I was working.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but still, I'm surprised at her.",
        "Teri: Don't be.",
        "Janet: Well --",
        "Teri: I mean, she's got a lot on her plate.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but she doesn't have any issues with you.",
        "Teri: Yeah, anyway, I -- I need to find a place to stay until I figure out my next move.",
        "Jan: Okay, okay. I'll -- I'll ask Emma and Jack, of course.",
        "Teri: Oh, I don't know. Maybe that's not such a good idea. Maybe it's time for me to go.",
        "Janet: No, no, no! I don't want you to leave. You just got here.",
        "Teri: I'll keep in touch.",
        "Janet: Honey, you still have your job at Metro, don't you?",
        "Teri: I think so.",
        "Janet: Okay, then. What's the problem?",
        "Teri: Uh, I guess there isn't one. What?",
        "Janet: Why do I get the feeling there's something you're not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I'm getting really tired of drama, Mother -- really tired.",
        "Audrey: You know that if James finds out what we did, he will kill us both.",
        "Henry: Whose fault is that?",
        "[Audrey scoffs]",
        "Audrey: I don't really think it's time for the blame game here, do you?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I do, actually. Who's the one that kidnapped this guy in the first place?",
        "Audrey: Do you think I had a choice? He was writing James' new will. Now, look me in the eye and tell me you're willing to end up with absolutely nothing!",
        "Henry: Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, if we let him go, he is gonna go to the police, and then they will charge you with kidnapping no matter what we do to James.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Well, don't you think I thought of that? Mr. Hansen and I have a -- an understanding.",
        "Henry: What kind of understanding?",
        "Audrey: He is going to stay quiet about this little escapade.",
        "Henry: In exchange for what?",
        "Audrey: $250,000.",
        "Henry: Are you out of your mind, Mom? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Audrey: No, I think it's fair. It's fair, it's fair. Hey, it's fair.",
        "Henry: Where -- where are we supposed to come up with that kind of money?",
        "[Audrey gasps]",
        "Audrey: Are you out of your mind? That -- that is the whole point of this whole little -- adventure.",
        "Henry: So wait a second. Let me get this straight. I need to commit murder in order to avoid being charged for kidnapping?",
        "Audrey: Well, and to inherit a huge fortune.",
        "Henry: What makes you think we can trust Mr. Hansen?",
        "Audrey: Oh, boy. Okay, Mr. Hansen, please tell my skeptical son that you can be trusted.",
        "Hansen: Ow!",
        "Audrey: Oh. Okay, tell him.",
        "Hansen: For 250 grand, I wouldn't talk if you killed my father.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Yes, yes. Here you go. You see what I'm talking about? That is what I love about lawyers. It's always just a simple question of price. All right. Henry, can we just get on with it? Can we just go ahead and kill James and get on with our lives?",
        "Henry: Mom, if you want him dead, you need to do it yourself.",
        "Audrey: No. Henry --",
        "Henry: Enough. I don't want any part of this, and I don't want any part of you.",
        "Audrey: Henry!",

        "Parker: Hey. Ready to go?",
        "Liberty: Go where?",
        "Parker: College day. Hello.",
        "Liberty: Oh, right. Yeah.",
        "Parker: I thought you were really into this.",
        "Liberty: I am.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, you're not acting like it.",
        "Liberty: It's just hard, thinking what's gonna be going on in a year.",
        "Parker: Well, you'll be out of high school. I mean, you'll be on your own, in college.",
        "Liberty: I guess.",
        "[Liberty remembering]",
        "Tony: Rule number one -- get yourself into a good frat. That way you have yourself a four-year party, right? Let's go someplace else. Coffee sucks here.",
        "Parker: It'd really help if you'd talk to me, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Everything's cool, Parker. I'm just -- I'm really tired.",
        "Parker: Okay. Um, well, how about you have another cup of coffee. It's on me.",
        "Liberty: It's okay.",
        "Parker: Should we go?",
        "Liberty: You know what? How about -- how about you go, and I'll -- I'll meet up with you?",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Liberty: There's something I really need to take care of. Please.",
        "Parker: Okay. Liberty, I can't help you if you won't talk to me.",
        "Liberty: I know.",

        "Teri: You know, there's -- there's nothing else to tell you, Janet. I mean, Craig is gonna try and find a way to keep my job at Metro.",
        "Janet: You Believe him?",
        "Teri: Yeah. Hey, wait a second. I thought we agreed we were not gonna fight about Craig.",
        "Janet: I don't remember anything like that.",
        "Teri: Well, if we didn't, we probably should have. But I'm pretty sure we did.",
        "Janet: Okay. Look, if you're not gonna be working with Rosanna, at least you can spend more time with me.",
        "[Teri chuckles]",
        "Janet: You know, I feel like I've missed out on so much of your life.",
        "Teri: Yeah, I know. I've missed a lot of yours, too, and almost all of Liberty's.",
        "Janet: I know. I'm so glad you two like each other.",
        "Teri: She is a great kid.",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm. You know, before I got here, she's pretty much all I had. We are so close. We share everything.",
        "Teri: Yeah. You know, I -- I've told you this before, Janet, but you really did a great, great job with her. I know it must not have been easy for you.",

        "Teri: Yeah. Uh, what's up?",
        "Liberty: I called the clinic, and I got an appointment for this afternoon. You can still go with me, right?",

        "Teri: Uh, possible job interview thing.",
        "Janet: Doing what?",

        "Vienna: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And how did that go?",

        "Henry: It's not that simple.",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Henry: Because it's Audrey; it's Audrey. And she will find a way to blame me. She always does.",
