        "Lily dresses up and goes undercover talking with some girls at the Avalon, and finds out Cheri was very afraid of a mystery man, but the girls catch Lily in a lie. Holden confronts Dusty about Lily. Will and Gwen go to see a fertility expert, but Susan first gently suggests that they not rush into a decision to have a baby. Craig's credit cards are declined, as Paul stops in to gloat. Lily is able to cover her lack of knowledge of Cheri and tells the women to call her if they want to talk. Allison goes to find Dusty, but finds Aaron and Holden with him, which causes her to take off, as Aaron goes after her. Lily calls Dusty while he is arguing with Holden and tells him to meet her because she has useful information. Aaron and Allison reforge a tentative friendship. Will has his reservations about getting pregnant again, but Gwen is full steam ahead about it. Allison tells Aaron about how she has been trying to be supportive of Will and Gwen since they lost the baby. Meg is annoyed that Craig didn't tell her what was potentially going on with Rosanna. Will and Gwen meet with the fertility doctor, who cautions them against rushing into anything and offers Gwen that her only hope is finding an egg donor. Lily tells Dusty about the mystery man and how she wants to investigate it further because she is the only one that has gotten them this far. Lily tells Dusty that she isn't going to tell Holden what she is doing. Allison is happy to hear Aaron says he will call her again. Paul goes to offer his condolences to Will and Gwen. Craig tells Meg that Rosanna has frozen his accounts; they are broke. Allison goes to check on Gwen and finds herself making a surprising offer. Will voices his concerns to Paul about Gwen getting pregnant again. Paul tells Will that he and Rosanna are back together and that Meg has to live with her choices. Meg and Craig move into the Farm. Craig assures Meg that he would never turn on her like Paul did, and she believes that. Lily and Dusty let themselves into Cheri's room and find something stunning \u0096 an engraved wedding band and a lock of boy's hair. Something went wrong because Cheri looked too happy in the picture to leave this boy, and that trouble must have followed her to Oakdale."

        "Lily: All I know is that one night she was so scared. She said she had a close call.",
        "Jewel: So, she told you about him, did she?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes. She didn't want me to know, of course. You know Cheri. She always wanted to seem tough and in control.",
        "Krista: She was tough and in control.",
        "Lily: I know. What I meant was that she was so scared -- different that night. I finally got her to open up about him.",
        "Jewel: You know, I've dealt with guys I knew you had to be careful with. But him -- I mean, he was --",
        "Krista: A monster.",
        "Lily: You met him?",
        "Jewel: Well, no. She just talked about him. After a couple of drinks, sometimes that was all she talked about.",
        "Krista: It was like he was right there in the same room with her. She would like, tremble just talking about him.",
        "Jewel: After that, I'd have nightmares about a guy I'd never even met.",
        "Lily: Well, I feel better now.",
        "Krista: Huh?",
        "Lily: Well, she only opened up to me that one time because I kept after her. I'm just glad she had the two of you to talk about it. I mean, it's just horrible to think about her walking around with that all bottled up inside.",
        "Jewel: Oh, repressed feelings can be very toxic. I heard that on TV.",
        "Lily: I think you're right. So, she really opened up to you?",
        "Jewel: Well, I'm like that. People just seem to want to tell me stuff.",
        "Lily: I get that about you. I just met you and I got that.",
        "Jewel: Well, some of my repeats say that my listening skills are as good as my -- you know, other skills.",
        "Lily: I hear you sister, I know. You know, the problem is that Cheri and I -- the night that she was telling me that story the both of us were just tippin' it back a little bit. And I'll never forget the story. But I cannot remember that guy's name.",
        "Krista: Okay, who are you and what do you want with us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Man, you're a piece of work. You know that?",
        "Dusty: I thought she was going home.",
        "Holden: When did she leave?",
        "Dusty: About twenty minutes ago.",
        "Holden: Come on. Why don't you just tell me? What's going on here? What is she doing for you now? First, she hides the gun, then she posts bail. What's she doing? Is she getting you a lawyer?",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry about the gun. Listen, I didn't ask her for help. I didn't want her involved. And of course, I'm going to pay the bail back.",
        "Holden: You ever notice what all the women in your life have in common? They all have problems. They're all at a place in their life -- a rough place in their life -- and then all of a sudden it's \"The Dusty show.\"",
        "Aaron: Dad. What's going on here?",
        "Holden: Talking to our old friend Dusty. Remember what good friends you and Aaron here used to be? Loyal friends.",
        "Dusty: I'm leaving --",
        "Holden: Not until you tell me where my wife is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't understand. I'm a friend of Cheri's.",
        "Krista: No, you're not. And she didn't tell you about that guy.",
        "Lily: I -- I don't understand.",
        "Krista: You said you couldn't remember his name. She told you and you can't remember his name?",
        "Lily: That's right.",
        "Krista: Cheri never said his name, it was like a thing with her.",
        "Jewel: Yeah, that's right. She said she would never tell anyone his name. And it wasn't safe for us to know it.",
        "Krista: So, Lola, why don't you tell us what you're really up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Are you nervous?",
        "Gwen: No. You're the one who's pacing.",
        "Will: I know. It doesn't make sense, but I don't like hospitals at night.",
        "Gwen: I know. But it was the only time Dr. Akido could see us. And Susan had to work really hard to get us that.",
        "Will: She's been great.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's been really great. Hey, sit with me.",
        "Susan: Hi.",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Susan: I just came by to tell you that Dr. Akido's going to be a few minutes late.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that's fine. We have plenty of time.",
        "Susan: He's looking over your blood work from after the miscarriage and checking your hormone levels.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, actually I read about that. They use it to determine when I should get pregnant.",
        "Susan: Well, that's part of it. I asked Dr. Akido if I could talk to you two first. And he's going to say something to you along the same lines.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Susan: Gwen, your body is still recovering from the miscarriage.",
        "Gwen: I feel fine.",
        "Susan: And there is a period of emotional recovery, too. And to see a fertility expert this soon --",
        "Gwen: I understand that, but we both want to have a child. And I know how long it can take. So, I don't know why -- why would we put it off?",
        "Susan: Because you might be taking a risk that you just don't have to take right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Have I created a Frankenstein? You're actually working while we dine?",
        "Meg: What? What? You made me CEO. This was your big idea. So, don't give me grief over me trying to figure out what I'm doing when I don't know what the hell I'm doing.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you do. You caught that accounting glitch.",
        "Meg: That? That was like balancing your checkbook, only there are nine more zeros after every number.",
        "Craig: I'm serious. You were born to do this, Meg. With you at the helm, we're going to double -- I bet you we're going to triple our holdings by the end of the year.",
        "Waitress: Look, I'm sorry. But your card was declined.",
        "Craig: Why? What seems to be the problem?",
        "Paul: Looks like somebody came up a little short. Something I can do to help out? Let this be on me. You can consider it a belated wedding present.",
        "Craig: You know what? One of these -- one of these will work, okay?",
        "Paul: Isn't this a cute little domestic scene? Husband and wife having dinner at the diner. Look at you, Meg. Work, work, work. So much I didn't know about you.",
        "Meg: I'm going to see how Patty's doing with those cards.",
        "Paul: It's like she didn't even want to talk to me.",
        "Craig: You know what? No one ever does. What are you doing here, Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm addicted to the pepparkakor.",
        "Craig: You know, I think it's -- what's the word I'm looking for? Not pepparkakor. Oh, yeah. Pathetic that a grown man like you would get a thrill out of a such non-event as this.",
        "Paul: I just wanted to be here right at the beginning. The beginning of the end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You're kidding, right?",
        "Krista: When a good friend is murdered, I don't tend to kid.",
        "Lily: No, I'm talking about Cheri not mentioning this man's name. She just wasn't superstitious like that.",
        "Jewel: You act like you knew her pretty well. I don't think you knew her at all.",
        "Lily: I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression. I'm sure she spoke about this man more to the both of you than she did to me. Was he someone she met before she got in the business?",
        "Krista: See, I keep asking you what you're up to, but you don't answer my question. You just keep asking your own.",
        "Lily: Do you blame me for wanting to know what happened to her? All right, maybe Cheri and I were not that close and we were competitive. Competitive -- that was a problem between us.",
        "Jewel: She was competitive. Krista, I mean, you got to admit that.",
        "Lily: But I liked her a lot. For her to get killed like that, that way, it's not right.",
        "Jewel: Oh Lord, its Lenny. If I have to listen to the time about he shot three under par one more time -- Lenny, what are you doing way over there? Aren't you going to buy thirsty little Jewel some champagne?",
        "Lily: She's seems sweet.",
        "Krista: She trusts people too much.",
        "Lily: You know who I don't trust? Cops. They took in the first person that they found instead of going after the guy that made Cheri's life hell. You know why? They don't care what happened to her. They don't care who killed her because of what she did and who she was.",
        "Krista: And you care because?",
        "Lily: I don't want to see another girl get hurt like that again. You know, these creeps, they just don't do it one time. Call me if you change your mind about talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: What's going on? Why are you asking him where Lily is?",
        "Holden: Because, apparently, she's not done aiding and abetting.",
        "Dusty: When Lily left here she was fine. Now, if she didn't make it home, I don't know.",
        "Holden: You just figured it out, didn't you? Where is she?",
        "Dusty: I think it's better if you let her tell you about it.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, let's take notes. We're getting advice from an expert on relationships.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Save it. Just tell me where my wife is, now.",
        "Alison: Dusty, they said you were -- Aaron, I --",
        "Dusty: Hey, Alison.",
        "Aaron: No, no. Hold on. I don't think she can handle any more of your help.",
        "Holden: Alison seemed pretty upset. What did she do? Show up for her assignment? Are she and Emily in charge of starting your defense fund?",
        "Dusty: Stop beatin' it, all right? I've made mistakes, leave it.",
        "Holden: Where is she?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: That's my lawyer, I've got to take it. Donovan.",
        "Lily: Where are you, I need to talk to you.",
        "Dusty: Nine tomorrow? Yeah, I can do it.",
        "Lily: No, I found something out.",
        "Dusty: But listen, I'm here right now with Lily Snyder's husband. And he's a little upset about the bail, and we've got to try to figure out how to pay him back.",
        "Lily: The diner in 15 minutes.",
        "Dusty: I'm not sure about that.",
        "Lily: I am. 15 minutes. It's important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey.",
        "Alison: Let me go!",
        "Aaron: Tell me why you're running and I will.",
        "Alison: What did you want me to do, Aaron? Order a beer, ask your dad how he liked the video online? Look you in the eye after --",
        "Aaron: You decided to stay in Oakdale. You're going to run into people you know. You can't just keep running, Alison.",
        "Alison: I can try.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, and you were looking for Dusty. And you didn't even talk to him.",
        "Alison: I knew you caught that. All I have to do is walk into a room and I just make things worse for you.",
        "Aaron: You heard about him getting arrested and you were worried about him because he brings that out in you. What?",
        "Alison: Aaron. That, \"It's all Dusty's fault and Alison is just a victim here\" thing. It doesn't help me. If I'm going to get myself out of this hole I dug, I need to be honest. Dusty never made me do anything.",
        "Aaron: Okay. But does that mean you have to punish yourself? And is a part of that punishment not talking to me? I called you -- you didn't call back. Stopped by your house a few times, you were never home.",
        "Alison: I wasn't doing drugs.",
        "Aaron: I didn't think you were. I thought you were just going to a lot of meetings.",
        "Alison: I was and I was spending a lot of time with Gwen and Will. Gwen lost her baby.",
        "Aaron: When? Huh?",
        "Alison: She's just in all this pain and she doesn't deserve to be.",
        "Aaron: And you do, right?",
        "Alison: I just thought I'd try a real change of pace. You know, caring about someone other than me.",
        "Aaron: Gwen and Will. Are they okay?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Gwen says it was a miracle that she even got pregnant. A miracle that ended up being the worst thing that's ever happened to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I understand that you're trying to help, but we've already made up our minds.",
        "Will: Gwen, I think we should listen --",
        "Gwen: We've already talked about this.",
        "Will: What are the risks? What could happen to her?",
        "Gwen: Will.",
        "Will: Gwen, we're going to listen. We're at least going to listen. All right?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: What were you going to say?",
        "Susan: Gwen, I understand what it's like to want a baby. I have Alison because of what doctors like Dr. Akido can do. I'm not saying don't do this, I'm just saying let's talk about the timing.",
        "Gwen: But I don't want to wait, you see, there's no reason to.",
        "Susan: There are a couple good reasons. First, any pregnancy, given your history, is going to be high risk. And second, you should be in the best health. Physically and emotionally and I just don't think you're there yet.",
        "Gwen: Well, then can I ask you a question? Why did Dr. Akido even agree to see me in the first place?",
        "Susan: Because I asked him to. I want you to have the information. I just don't want you to do this because you're grieving. Because you want to take some action to make yourself feel better. As a doctor, as a friend, I just think that doing this now would be risky for you and the baby.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I got it. I hear you and I understand that you're trying to help. But I, just for me, I need to hear it from Dr. Akido.",
        "Susan: Fair enough. I'll leave you two alone to talk it over. But Gwen, you're so young. You have time, you really do.",
        "Will: She might be right, you know?",
        "Gwen: I understand that she means well. But, I know my body and I'm fine.",
        "Will: And what about the other thing, then? You could just be trying not to feel so sad.",
        "Gwen: No. Why are you doing this right now? Why are you changing your mind?",
        "Will: Because as much as I want to have a baby -- I don't want anything to happen to you. Could you really go through this again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I think you were just about to tell me where my wife was.",
        "Dusty: She didn't tell me.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you know?",
        "Dusty: Would you calm down and listen to me?",
        "Holden: What? You gonna give me advice?",
        "Dusty: You don't have to tell me that giving a gun to your wife was stupid and selfish -- I've apologized to her, and now I'm apologizing to you.",
        "Holden: Oh, so everything is supposed to be okay?",
        "Dusty: You know, I gotta tell you -- I don't think this is about me, personally.",
        "Holden: Really, then what's it about?",
        "Dusty: I don't know, I heard you guys had a big fight. She doesn't want to talk about it. I'm worried about her.",
        "Holden: Don't worry about her. That's my job.",
        "Dusty: Good. I'm leaving. And don't be so ticked off at me, start thinking about her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Watching Gwen go through all that -- you know what hit me?",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Alison: This horrible thing happened to her, just out of the blue. My problems? All self-generated.",
        "Aaron: I got an idea. The drug store might be open, why don't we go there and get some index cards and we can list all your faults, one per card. And maybe we can put them in alphabetical order.",
        "Alison: Shut up.",
        "Aaron: Of course, that would take a couple of weeks. What is the worst, worst thing about Alison Stewart?",
        "Alison: This isn't funny. I've done terrible things to people. And nobody knows that better than you.",
        "Aaron: Yeah and I'm still here. I didn't die. Nobody's dying, Alison, the person that came close was you.",
        "Alison: That message you left. Your voice was just -- it was just so calm like that, like nothing had happened. It just didn't seem fair for me to call you back. You know how much I've hurt you. And why should I let you make me feel better about that.",
        "Aaron: Ally let's just skip the being fair part and just get to feeling better. Okay, that woman that Dusty killed --",
        "Alison: He didn't!",
        "Aaron: Okay he didn't. She did a lot of bad things to you. Okay, she did it, not you.",
        "Alison: That's what my mom said.",
        "Aaron: Well she's not always wrong. Promise me something.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Aaron: Next time I call you, you call me back. Look how beautiful that smile is. What happened?",
        "Alison: You said the next time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The beginning -- of the end. I think you amuse me most when you're portentous.",
        "Paul: You amuse me the most when you're broke.",
        "Craig: Broke is a state of mind. The best things in life are free.",
        "Paul: Then why did you bother to take all of Rosanna's money?",
        "Craig: Her money? My money were merged. It's a very complex thing but it will all be sorted out in time.",
        "Paul: Well, not too much time. See when your name is Cabot, you pick up the phone to Detroit and all of a sudden people want to help you. They want to do things. They want to speed along the process. Where is that waitress? What is taking her so long? She's had plenty of time, she's had enough time to run a dozen credit cards. Could it possibly be that all of them were cancelled?",
        "Craig: Why don't you get your pepparkakor to go?",
        "Paul: Oh, look at Meg, she's doing that thing with her eyebrow when she's upset. As if she's surprised that all of your credit cards have been cancelled. Don't tell me she didn't see this one coming?",
        "Craig: Okay, okay, you know I guess you gotta gloat when you get the little wins when you never get a big one.",
        "Paul: You see the thing is, I've heard now that the key to a successful marriage is an open and honest line of communication. So you might want to tell your new wife that Rosanna is about to wipe you out, in about 20 minutes. You know that the richer part of the richer and poorer is over.",
        "Craig: What did Meg ever do to you? Why do you have it in for her? Oh -- sorry I forgot.",
        "Paul: Good night, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Meg: None of these cards worked, Craig. And Paul seemed to know what happened and you weren't very surprised.",
        "Craig: You know, you would think that a near death experience would sort of mellow a guy out.",
        "Meg: Okay now, no little jokes, no evasions. Tell me what you know, and how long you've known about it.",
        "Craig: Rosanna is in Detroit, she's trying to wipe me out financially. I didn't tell you about it, because there's not a damn thing you can do about it.",
        "Meg: No. You didn't tell me because you didn't want me to know that you screwed up. Dinner was on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look I know that you -- I know that you are worried about me and losing the baby was -- it was really hard.",
        "Will: It could happen again.",
        "Gwen: Yes it could. But I would feel worse if I didn't try. If I knew that we didn't try.",
        "Will: Well, what if you're not strong enough physically.",
        "Gwen: Then the doctor will say that. All right, I just want to listen to what he has to say.",
        "Dr. Akido: Mr. and Mrs. Munson.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Dr. Akido: I'm Dr. Akido.",
        "Will: Nice to meet you.",
        "Gwen: Thank you so much for seeing us.",
        "Dr. Akido: Yeah, Dr. Stewart can be very persuasive. First of all, I'm very sorry about your loss.",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Dr. Akido: I know Dr. Stewart talked to you about the recovery process. It's very soon after the miscarriage to be seeing someone like me.",
        "Gwen: Ahh, we just want to know -- what we can do to have another baby. And when.",
        "Dr. Akido: I know. I wish I didn't have to say this, Mrs. Munson.",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm --",
        "Dr. Akido: Even with the use of hormonal therapies, the chances of your getting pregnant again are very slim.",
        "Gwen: But not impossible. I mean, I got pregnant before when everybody said that I couldn't.",
        "Will: Gwen. We said we were going to listen.",
        "Dr. Akido: The problem is, even if you did get pregnant, that baby would still be at great risk.",
        "Will: So that's it?",
        "Dr. Akido: No, there is another approach. I've looked over your history, and I think, in your case, you might want to consider finding an egg donor.",
        "Gwen: A donor?",
        "Dr. Akido: We would fertilize a donor egg with your husband's sperm and place it in your womb. There are no indications that you couldn't carry a healthy baby to term.",
        "Gwen: Well, ahh, okay. Umm, what do we do? When can we start?",
        "Dr. Akido: Please, Mrs. Munson, I'm concerned that we be very realistic from the beginning. There could be an extended search for a donor, it could take months. The IVF process can take years -- and even then there are no real guarantees it will succeed.",
        "Gwen: It doesn't -- it doesn't matter to me. I don't care how long it takes. I want to have a child with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Oh, man.",
        "Lily: I can explain.",
        "Dusty: You went back to the Avalon, didn't you?",
        "Lily: That's right.",
        "Dusty: Wearing that?",
        "Lily: We both agreed, that the girls would not talk to any man or an outsider.",
        "Dusty: Holden's going to love this.",
        "Lily: Holden is not going to find out about it. If you slow down for one second and listen to what I found out. I think I know who killed Cheri.",
        "Lily: So, Dusty, this has to be the guy.",
        "Dusty: You don't know his name, where he is, or what he looks like and this has to be the guy?",
        "Lily: You know, I get enough of that from Holden these days. The least you could do it say thank you.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Lily: You're welcome.",
        "Dusty: Now go home.",
        "Lily: No. No, no.",
        "Dusty: Lily.",
        "Lily: Dusty, I am good at this. I figured out that there was something else going on with Cheri. And I got those girls to tell me what it was. No, I didn't get a name, but there wasn't a name to get. And I have a sense of the guy, and a better sense of Cheri. Now, I'm not giving up. As far as I can see, I am closer to the truth than anyone.",
        "Dusty: Can we talk without fighting?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Dusty: Your husband's very upset.",
        "Lily: So what's new and different?",
        "Dusty: He doesn't want you involved in my business because I'm bad news.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not about you. It's about me. No, it is because I messed up. And Holden was there for me. He was great. He was there for me and the children. We're better now. And Holden does not have to be my caretaker anymore. Okay? So this is what we're going to do.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Lily: You said yourself. We have to find out the name of the guy that was spooking Cheri so badly. And they're going to be cleaning out her room very soon, so I'm going to change my clothes and meet you back at the Lakeview.",
        "Dusty: Hold on a sec. You want to break into the crime scene?",
        "Lily: No. We'll use my pass key.",

        "Alison: I will. [Phone buzzing] You're buzzing.",
        "Aaron: That's probably work.",
        "Alison: At the Lakeview?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Alison: And you came running after me? Aaron, you could lose your job.",
        "Aaron: Oh no! There goes my career in mixology.",
        "Alison: Don't joke, I don't want you to get in trouble.",
        "Aaron: Well, I can't find a better reason. Listen, tell Gwen and Will that I'm very sorry.",

        "Gwen: No, no, no. I'm fine.",
        "Will: You were pretty quiet on the way home, I figured you feel asleep.",
        "Gwen: I was just thinking. You know, I got a lot to think about.",
        "Will: Like Susan says, we have time.",
        "Gwen: Or it's like Dr. Akido said we should sign up because it could take a long time.",
        "Will: He said we could sign up.",
        "Gwen: You know what actually, I am feeling really tired. Do you mind if we talk about this in the morning?",
        "Will: Yeah, that's fine. You go to bed. You need your rest. I'll lock up.",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Will: And I'll get rid of whoever that is.",

        "Paul: I know it's late.",
        "Will: Yeah, usually it wouldn't matter, but Gwen's actually really tired right now, so --",
        "Paul: Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. No, you guys go out and talk. I'm just going to go to bed.",
        "Will: You sure?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Really, I'm just going to go lie down.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, I won't be long then.",
        "Gwen: All right. Be long. It's fine, really. It's really good to see you, Paul.",

        "Craig: They never have any cashews. And if I had a bar, I would have a bartender.",
        "Meg: Let's just go up.",
        "Craig: No. I want a bottle of champagne.",
        "Meg: I thought champagne was for celebrations. I also thought champagne was for when you could afford champagne.",
        "Craig: All right? You know what? You really are getting testy tonight.",
        "Meg: I don't like being kept in the dark, Craig.",
        "Craig: I don't like being told I screwed up, Meg. I can't control Rosanna. I didn't do this.",
        "Meg: What you did was try and take total control of her estate. And if you just kept your money separate from her money, she couldn't get to yours right now. How much of that was your money?",
        "Craig: I don't remember.",
        "Meg: I have a headache.",
        "Craig: You? You have a headache?",
        "Manager: Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Craig: Oh, finally. At last. Look, I'd like a bottle of champagne. We had a great '94 last week.",
        "Manager: I'm afraid we have a small problem here.",
        "Craig: I noticed that you don't have a bartender. We've been waiting for ten minutes.",
        "Manager: The card you left with us for your deposit was declined.",
        "Craig: I'll write you a check.",
        "Manager: I'm sorry, Sir, after that, we ran a credit check. We're going to have to ask you to leave.",
        "Craig: Well, that's harsh.",
        "Manager: We've packed up your things. You can get them from the valet. Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Quintessential bureaucrat. That was the highlight of that guy's week.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I loved that, too.",
        "[Cell phones rings]",
        "Craig: And I don't like being -- having my bags packed. I'm very particular about how I pack things.",
        "Meg: Aren't you going to get that?",
        "Craig: It's my lawyer. He will leave a very detailed message. And bill me for it.",

        "Craig: I love being married to you. Sandy, hello. You're burning the midnight oil. Yeah. Right. Right. Right.",
        "Meg: Well?",

        "Alison: I saw the lights on. I hope it's not too late. I figured you guys wouldn't really be up for shopping, so I picked up a few things. There's a vegetarian lasagna in there. It's not too bad. And you just have to heat it up.",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Alison: Talk to you soon.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm just making some coffee. It's decaf. Would you like some?",
        "Alison: Only if you want the company.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that would be really good.",
        "Alison: Did Will go to bed?",
        "Gwen: No, he went out with his brother.",
        "Alison: Oh, sorry I missed him. Paul's just crazy about me.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Alison: Forget it! You look tired. Are you sure you don't want me to go?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. I want to tell you about tonight. And about how great your mom was.",
        "Alison: Oh, what happened?",
        "Gwen: She got us in to see this fertility specialist, and -- it normally takes months to get an appointment with him, but she got us in right away.",
        "Alison: What did he say?",
        "Gwen: It was good. It was really great. He said that I should have no problem carrying a baby to term.",
        "Alison: Gwen, that's great! Okay, so how about you tell me why you seem so sad about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: The whole process can take a long time, and Gwen thinks it's great. Or she's acting like she thinks it's great.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Will: She keeps saying that she can have \"My\" baby. Does she think that it wouldn't be hers?",
        "Paul: Well, look who grew up when I wasn't looking. I guess I should have been paying better attention.",
        "Will: It's okay.",
        "Paul: No, it's not okay. I don't mean to get too sentimental, but I am going to try and be a better brother to you.",
        "Will: It won't be hard.",
        "Paul: Look, this egg donor thing is probably expensive. You want some help?",
        "Will: Well, thanks, but we don't even know how long it'll take, or if we can even find a donor. I'm scared. If this happens again -- you don't know what it does to her.",
        "Paul: So, what, you think you shouldn't even bother trying?",
        "Will: No, I think that we need to think about it more. But you know Gwen, she's like, no way, it's full steam ahead. Don't tell her I said this.",
        "Paul: Okay --",
        "Will: Part of me hopes that we never find a donor.",

        "Aaron: Okay, I guess.",

        "Dusty: Okay. You look around. I'll try to get into this computer here.",
        "Lily: I wonder what kind of spreadsheet you use when you run a prostitution business.",
        "Dusty: I just don't think she'd be keeping information about this guy.",
        "Lily: I don't know about that. I got the sense it was a long-term threat to her, and she might want to keep tabs on this guy.",
        "Dusty: I mean, you think he was obsessed with her?",
        "Lily: I think it was more than that. Look at this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So, it was Emily who gave one of her eggs to your mom?",
        "Alison: And here I am.",
        "Gwen: She was lucky.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't say that, she ended up with me.",
        "Gwen: No, I mean, that Emily was willing to do that for her. The doctor said that the process of finding a donor can take a really long time.",
        "Alison: And I'm sure you don't want to have to wait.",
        "Gwen: No, I just -- I just feel like -- like we're all waiting for our lives to start up again. You know, that everything right now is just kind of on hold.",

        "Will: Look, I want a baby. I just -- I don't want to see her go through this again.",
        "Paul: I know what you mean. Watching what Craig did to Rosanna was way worse than anything that Craig actually did to me.",
        "Will: She's okay now?",
        "Paul: Yeah, she's all right. She's weak, but she's getting better. We're getting that second chance that everybody always wants.",
        "Will: What about Meg?",
        "Paul: Meg has made her choice, and she's going to have to live with it.",

        "Craig: I can't believe we're doing this.",
        "Meg: Do you have a better idea?",
        "Craig: This is a temporary situation, Meg. We are not going to live like this.",
        "Meg: You keep forgetting who I am. I like living like this. Money doesn't mean that much to me.",
        "Craig: This isn't just about the money. This isn't just about me, you know.",
        "Meg: Look, it's late, I'm tired.",
        "Craig: I want you to think about what happened. I want you think about what Paul Ryan did tonight.",
        "Meg: I don't want to.",
        "Craig: He set you up to humiliate you. He's seeking revenge on you.",
        "Meg: I don't equate Rosanna wanting her money back as some kind of plot against me.",
        "Craig: Showing up at the diner like he did with all those remarks? Rosanna may want her money back, but Paul wants to pay you back for what you did to him.",
        "Meg: I understand why Paul did what he did.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, no, you don't. Not in a million years would you ever do anything like that. You're so much better than that.",
        "Meg: He's only doing what you've done time and time again!",
        "Craig: But not to you. I married you knowing you didn't want me. I stayed married to you knowing your secrets. And the only thing I tried to make you do was want to be married to me. That's the difference between me and Paul Ryan. Nothing -- nothing -- nothing that could happen would ever change how I feel about you. You do believe that, don't you?",
        "Meg: I do believe it. That's what scares me.",

        "Dusty: No.",
        "Lily: This is baby's hair. It's wrapped with a little blue ribbon. This is a baby boy. This hair, look at this picture. Wow, she looks so innocent. It's hard to think about how she ended up in her life. No names, no date.",
        "Dusty: Married with a kid. Who knew?",
        "Lily: I don't think anybody -- those girls at the Avalon knew about that. Late '80s, you think? The '90s?",
        "Dusty: Which makes her kid 16 to 20?",
        "Lily: That's Luke's age. Look at her. Look how happy she is here. She didn't leave this child or her husband willingly. Something happened. Something terrible happened to this family, and it followed her for the rest of her life.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, and it caught up with her here.",
        "Lily: And the thing is, that person's still out there.",
