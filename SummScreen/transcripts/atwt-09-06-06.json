Emily is unsure at first, but Paul convinces her he is looking out for her best interest. Emily and Paul are happily toasting their new relationship as Meg, Emma and Holden walk in hoping to surprise him to celebrate their engagement \u0096 guess the surprise is on Meg. Katie goes to see Carly about a job supposedly but soon Carly realizes she is there because of Simon. Katie claims she is just concerned, but it does appear to be more. Carly shares that she and Jack are finalizing their divorce so her life is too complicated to involve Simon; Katie apologizes but she just cares about her. When Jade is MIA, Gwen is convinced she is the slasher. Luke and Will defend her. Maddie takes the mask off of the pinned slasher; and is shocked to be looking at her sister Eve. Eve lays into her about how she is a slut and teased her husband by traipsing around in her little outfits until he succumbed to her. She pretends to be all innocent when she is a disgusting slut and all of the deaths are on her head. She had to stop her once she found out Maddie was going to try to blame Louis for what happened to her. She particularly wanted to kill Casey so she could take someone Maddie loved away from her like she did to her. Tom and Margo find an injured Casey with Maddie and they tell them the slasher is Eve, who has since freed herself and taken off. Eve runs into Jack and pretends to be searching for help for Maddie, but Jack is not convinced and arrests her. Henry walks up as he is and then he realizes she was involved. She responds by laughing. How could he do that to Maddie and all those kids? She coldly asks why he always fawns over Maddie and is even concerned about her as she is standing there in handcuffs. Gwen apologizes to Jade for accusing her. Jade still wonders if she has a shot with Will when she assumes Will and Gwen are still not back together, but Will and Gwen leave together as do Jade and Luke. Maddie prays Casey is ok."

        "Emily: Okay, what do you want to talk to me about?",
        "Paul: I had an idea.",
        "Emily: Oh, great.",
        "Paul: It's not a fait accompli --",
        "Emily: A whatta -- ?",
        "Paul: It's not a done deal, but I've been thinking a lot about your situation and your stress, and how I can help you out.",
        "Emily: You have helped me out --",
        "Paul: And what I've come up with is, I'm going to buy \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Emily: These look good.",
        "Paul: Did you hear what I just said?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm. I heard you. I'm processing. So, you want to help me and the baby, you want to reduce my stress, and by doing that, you want to become my boss?",
        "Paul: Well, it's a decision that we would make together.",
        "Emily: Is there anyone out there who still believes you when you say things like that?",
        "Paul: Emily, come on. I'm worried about you, and I'm worried about the baby.",
        "Emily: Oh. You're serious. Okay.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I am serious.",
        "Emily: Serious conversation. No more jokes.",
        "Paul: I'm not joking when I say that I'm not going to do this unless you say that it's okay. I'd like to know your feelings.",
        "Emily: Okay. Before we talk about my feelings -- let's talk about Meg's feelings.",
        "Paul: Meg's -- fine with this.",
        "Emily: Really? Is she fine, like the Paul Ryan \"fine\"? Because you haven't told her?",
        "Paul: Meg and I don't have any secrets.",
        "Emily: So she's fine with it?",
        "Paul: Of course. Right now, Meg is fine about everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: And after all that, he decided to go back to camp. What a great kid, huh?",
        "Meg: After all -- what, who decided to go back to camp?",
        "Holden: A bunch of kids went up to Raven Lake this weekend, and Luke ended up telling his friend Kevin that he was gay.",
        "Meg: Wow, that took courage.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it gets better. Kevin got drunk, and ended up calling Luke a faggot.",
        "Meg: That's horrible.",
        "Emma: That's what I said. But just wait 'till you hear what happened afterwards. This Kevin boy was drowning, and Luke saved his life.",
        "Meg: Is Luke okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. He's fine. I ended up talking to both of them at the hospital and it looks like they're going to be able to get past it, but Luke is worried about the other kids.",
        "Meg: And he still went back?",
        "Emma: Of course he went back. He's a Snyder boy. He's not going to hide from anyone. [Both laugh] What is so funny, may I ask?",
        "Holden: Oh, nothing Mama.",
        "Meg: She'll be marching with him next year.",
        "Emma: Oh, I'm glad I'm a constant source of amusement to you two. Ooh -- what is that on your hand?",
        "Meg: Oh. This -- is a ring.",
        "Emma: It's big, it's a diamond ring.",
        "Meg: Paul is a little traditional that way. Um, I said I'd marry him in the barn. Actually, in the barn, I said I'd marry him.",
        "Emma: Oh, I see. And just what was it that made you say yes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maddie didn't do this, Jack.",
        "Jack: I never said she did it.",
        "Henry: Jack, this is -- she wouldn't do this. This is sick.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it is. But you said she lied to you. You said she had talked to Eve about going to Chicago.",
        "Henry: Well, just because you think it was a woman does not mean it was Maddie.",
        "Jack: What time was that? When do you think Maddie left Oakdale?",
        "Holden: I am not helping you anymore.",
        "Jack: Look --",
        "Henry: You've been against her from the beginning -- no.",
        "Jack: Look, I now have evidence that points to a woman. And I will do anything and everything to find out who that woman is before she kills somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You have to find her, and you have to stop her.",
        "Luke: Gwen, Jade didn't do this.",
        "Gwen: How do you know she didn't fool you, just like she did everybody else?",
        "Luke: Jade didn't kill anybody!",
        "Gwen: Well, it explains everything. It explains why everything pointed to Maddie. She never liked Maddie, so she made her look like a killer.",
        "Will: Gwen, calm down.",
        "Gwen: Okay. And what if I'm right? What if she did do all this? She could be after Maddie right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I have to know. I have to know who it is.",
        "Casey: Maddie, no --",
        "Maddie: No, I --",
        "Casey: Maddie, don't. Maddie, no.",
        "Maddie: You did this?",
        "Eve: Look at you. Like you're watching one of your stupid movies. Cow eyes, and your mouth hanging open.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Eve: You never were too quick to catch on, were you, little sister?",
        "Maddie: You killed people!",
        "Eve: Because of you! All those dead kids? Yeah, that's your fault. You did that.",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Eve: Him? Your fault, too.",
        "Maddie: No!",
        "Eve: Yes! Oh, I can see how you're going to play this already. All hurt and innocent looks -- butter wouldn't melt.",
        "Maddie: I don't understand.",
        "Eve: Every stupid man, falling for it. Cute little Maddie, pretty little Maddie. How can we help helpless little Maddie? If they only knew.",
        "Maddie: Knew what?",
        "Eve: Knew that you were a disgusting slut, that's what!",
        "Maddie: You think that --",
        "Eve: No, no, no, no. Don't you try and pull that innocent act with me. You move into my house, you parade yourself in front of my husband, you make him crazy --",
        "Maddie: I didn't --",
        "Eve: Do not lie to me. It is finally time for the truth!",
        "Maddie: He raped me!",
        "Eve: Because you made it happen. He wasn't strong enough to resist you. You and your traipsing around in your little outfits, \"Oh, Louis,\" this, \"Oh, Louis\" that.\"",
        "Maddie: I didn't do that!",
        "Eve: He was mine! After that useless family and those useless parents, all I had in the world was Louis, and you took him from me!",
        "Maddie: You killed all those kids.",
        "Eve: I thought after you moved last year, it was going to be okay, that it was over.",
        "Maddie: It was --",
        "Eve: No, no. No, your good pal Margo, and that useless Henry, they were encouraging you to be free, and tell all -- and you were going to talk about Louis. You were going to make it his fault.",
        "Maddie: Is that what made you kill all those people that you didn't even know?",
        "Eve: I was going to frame you. Harder than I thought, since basically everybody falls for your \"poor, pitiful me\" act.",
        "Maddie: It wasn't an act. I didn't kill anyone.",
        "Eve: Don't get moral with me. I was protecting my marriage.",
        "Maddie: You tried to murder me. Your own sister!",
        "Eve: You are not my sister. You are a just a slut! And you're not even honest about it. Every move you make, every time you bat your eyes, or you wipe away a tear, or you look somebody in the eyes, you are lying. You are a vicious, grasping slut, and you put on this act like you're just some little girl next door, and men believe it! Louis believed it. My Louis.",
        "Maddie: Don't even start! Do not cry for him when you're the one that killed him!",
        "Eve: Don't you see? I had to. You gave me no choice!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Emily, I think that we need to set some ground rules. You and I will work together for the sake of the baby. But, how Meg feels is really my concern, and not yours.",
        "Emily: Right.",
        "Paul: And, I won't buy this newspaper unless you say that its okay, but I think it's a really good idea. It'll keep you from having to deal with Craig, it'll keep you from dealing with all the problems that you have because Craig is in jail, and I think that I've already proven to you that I am able to take up the slack, and take the pressure off you, whenever it's necessary.",
        "Emily: Wow. You really thought about this.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I have.",
        "Emily: Have you thought of all the contingencies?",
        "Paul: Yes, I have.",
        "Emily: Well, you see, I'm afraid you haven't. You see, this idea of yours? I hate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: That's kind of a strange question. I mean, why does any woman say yes to a proposal? She's in love, she wants to build a life --",
        "Emma: I didn't mean why you said yes --",
        "Meg: Oh, well, it sure sounded that way!",
        "Emma: What I meant was why now? I mean, he's been after you for so long.",
        "Meg: After me? He's in love with me, not after me.",
        "Emma: I'm just trying to -- hey, hey, don't get defensive.",
        "Meg: I'm not being defensive! Look, I know Paul and I have obstacles that we must face, and we all know what they are.",
        "Emma: Yes, Emily and the pregnancy.",
        "Meg: Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm blind by her impact on our lives. And I think we could overcome these obstacles if we just have faith in each other.",
        "Holden: Maybe that time I caught you in the barn, that helped you to decide, too, huh, Meggy -- ahh!",
        "Emma: Oh, Holden --",
        "Meg: You know, I back you up, I could use a little help here.",
        "Holden: Sorry.",
        "Meg: You know, some girls get engaged, they get congratulations. I get the third degree and little jokes.",
        "Holden: Paul is a very lucky, lucky guy. Congratulations.",
        "Meg: Thank you. So, any more questions, Mama?",
        "Emma: No. But I do have a suggestion. Hope you like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, we get why you think it could be Jade. But if no one agrees with you, then you should let it go.",
        "Gwen: But Maddie --",
        "Will: I know. And the cops are out looking for her. And there's more on their way. And they're doing everything they can. But you getting yourself crazy, it's not helping anybody. Especially you. You're hurt and you've got to take care of yourself.",
        "Gwen: I'm just really tired.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, the ambulance is on its way. Let's just sit down. I'll get you some water, all right?",
        "Gwen: I don't really want any water --",
        "Jade: Gwen? Oh, my God -- what happened? What's wrong? Why's everybody looking at me like that?",
        "Luke: It's the killer. He came to the lake.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on. She's been here all this time, she doesn't know that anything's wrong?",
        "Jade: What do you mean?",
        "Gwen: Where have you been, Jade? And what have you been doing?",
        "Jade: Walking.",
        "Gwen: Walking? For three hours?",
        "Jade: Yes, why is that any of your business?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, I guess it's some of my business when somebody's tried to kill me.",
        "Jade: Are you trying to say that I --",
        "Dallas: Answer the question, Jade.",
        "Jade: She's out to get me. I slept with her husband, so she's saying I'm the killer! I didn't kill anybody!",
        "Gwen: Oh, good, good. Thank God we have her word. I mean, she never lies.",
        "Jade: Will -- Will, tell them. Tell them you believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Margo?",
        "Margo: I'm not stopping.",
        "Tom: Then try breathing. Look, Margo, I know --",
        "Trooper: Detective Hughes, over here.",
        "Margo: Casey!",
        "Trooper: No -- no, I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Is that a bracelet?",
        "Trooper: Take a look at that.",
        "Tom: Signs of a struggle?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Someone was dragged off. Look. There. Radio that in, and then follow us.",
        "Trooper: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: You were in his blood. He couldn't help himself. Even if you were a killer, he wanted you. So you both had to go. You, because you deserved it. And Louis, I just thought of as -- more of a release.",
        "Maddie: And those kids? Their lives meant nothing to you?",
        "Eve: I'm quite sure I meant nothing to them. And they were really, just -- what do you call it? Collateral damage?",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God.",
        "Eve: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I have something -- I have something to tell you. It's real important. Not him.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Eve: Gwen and Lia, and those others, I don't really remember their names because they don't really matter. But Casey -- he was different.",
        "Maddie: I don't understand.",
        "Eve: Yeah. Casey, he was special. He had to die. Because then, I would have taken someone you love away from you. Just like you did me.",
        "Maddie: You must hate me very much.",
        "Eve: Oh, I do. Very much.",
        "Maddie: I think I'm going to be sick.",
        "Eve: Good. Don't let me stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi. Listen, I was on my way to the Lakeview to have a meeting with Kim, but I thought I would come talk to you first.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "Katie: A possible job opportunity.",
        "Carly: You know that I have a job with Simon.",
        "Katie: I know, just hear me out for a second. Do you have a minute?",
        "Carly: For you, of course.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Can I get you something?",
        "Katie: No, no, I won't be long. I just wanted to come say hi and see how you're doing.",
        "Carly: You just said that you wanted to talk to me about a job opportunity.",
        "Katie: Well, right, that, too. Unless you're perfectly happy working for Simon.",
        "Carly: Well, I prefer to think of it as working with Simon, not for him.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay, of course.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Katie: Unless he keeps showing up without any clothes on. Then you can't really call it work, can you?",
        "Carly: I explained that to you.",
        "Katie: Kind of --",
        "Carly: No, I did. I'll explain it again, if you want. Simon was at the model apartment, getting ready for a meeting, and there was a bucket of spackle that somehow ended up all over him. So he was getting cleaned up and he was changing his clothes, and that's when I walked in.",
        "Katie: And what?",
        "Carly: And nothing.",
        "Katie: Okay. All right.",
        "Carly: Oh -- you don't sound like you believe me.",
        "Katie: Listen, Carly, if you say that there's nothing going on between you and Simon, then of course I believe you. But you can't fault mike for jumping to conclusions when he walked in on that situation.",
        "Carly: But that's why I went to your house -- so I could prevent both of you from jumping to any conclusions. I guess that didn't work out quite the way I wanted it to.",
        "Katie: Listen, no, I'm not accusing you of anything, believe me. It's just that Simon can be a very persuasive man, especially naked.",
        "Carly: Katie!",
        "Katie: Well --",
        "Carly: Well, not when you are in the middle of a divorce, he's not.",
        "Katie: What? I mean, I knew you and Jack were separated --",
        "Carly: Yeah. We're taking steps to finalize things.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Carly: Yeah, really.",
        "Katie: When did you decide this?",
        "Carly: Recently. As you know, I guess I knew that it was inevitable, but somehow, that doesn't really make it any easier.",
        "Katie: No, of course it doesn't.",
        "Carly: And so obviously -- you know, my life now. And the last thing I need is to him.",
        "Katie: Right, well -- but then there's human nature.",
        "Carly: And what does that mean?",
        "Katie: It means that those times in life when people shouldn't get involved with other people, those are the times when they do get involved, and then they live to regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mama, I don't want to fight.",
        "Emma: I'm not -- no fight. I was going to say we should find a way to celebrate.",
        "Meg: You want to celebrate me marrying Paul?",
        "Emma: Yes. And we should ask Paul to join us. We have to -- after all, we have to welcome him into the family.",
        "Meg: You know, I didn't think that you'd react this way. It's not what I pictured.",
        "Emma: Oh, well now, you don't have me figured out all together, do you, young lady? But one thing you should know -- and that is, that when you're happy, I'm happy.",
        "Meg: I am happy.",
        "Emma: Oh, well, then that's all that matters. So, suppose I take you all out for some champagne so we can celebrate the good news. Okay?",
        "Meg: What, now?",
        "Emma: Yes, there's no time like the present. And call Paul, ask him to join us.",
        "Meg: Thank you, Mama.",
        "Emma: Oh, this is gonna be fun. I can't wait to see the look on Paul's face when I'm nice to him.",
        "[Emma and Meg giggling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You hate this idea?",
        "Emily: What, you're surprised by that?",
        "Paul: Yes, completely. Look, if you're worried about working for me, I don't know how long I'm gonna keep the newspaper. It's just a -- it's a temporary solution.",
        "Emily: Yeah, temporary for you. Permanent for me.",
        "Paul: I don't get it. I don't understand.",
        "Emily: No, I think you do. Because we both know you don't want to be involved in the day-to-day operations.",
        "Paul: Well, you handle the day-to-day operations.",
        "Emily: Right. Exactly. So now I go from one absentee boss to another, never knowing when you're gonna sell, never knowing when you're gonna tell me who I have to deal with next? I mean, do you have any idea how hard it is to sell a publication? You are creating work here, Paul. Work for me.",
        "Paul: Well, that's not fair. You yourself said that I helped you out a lot last month.",
        "Emily: Yeah, in a crisis situation. See, you -- you like crisis situations. You love saving people and fixing things and owning things. And we all know, you love to swoop in, but you love to take off. And then who's left stuck with the mess that you created? You know what, thanks for the peanut.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa, no, wait. [Cell phone ringing] [Emily sighs] Wait one second, please.",
        "Emily: Fine, fine.",
        "Paul: Hello.",
        "Meg: Hey, you sound busy. Where are you?",
        "Paul: I'm at the Lakeview, I'm just finishing up a meeting -- can I call you back?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it, I'll see you later. Bye. He's at a meeting at the Lakeview.",
        "Emma: Perfect. Tell him to stay there, we'll join him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Will, tell them.",
        "Will: Gwen, she wouldn't kill anybody.",
        "Jade: Thank you.",
        "Gwen: You take her side even now?",
        "Will: No, this isn't about sides. I just -- I think Luke is right. Jade wouldn't kill anyone.",
        "Gwen: Then that's the only thing she wouldn't do.",
        "Trooper: Griffin, we got a radio call from Pearson. He's with Detective Hughes. They're closing in on the killer.",
        "Dallas: Let's go.",
        "Jade: Looks like I'm not quite as bad as you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: No!",
        "[Maddie screams]",
        "Eve: I knew it.",
        "Maddie: Come on, Casey, you have to wake up. Casey, wake up, we have to get out of here. Casey! Casey -- come on, Casey, please. Casey, please. Casey --",
        "Tom: Hey!",
        "Margo: Casey! Casey?",
        "Maddie: Over here! Help! Please, help! Casey. He passed out. He tried to save me from her.",
        "Margo: Honey --",
        "Tom: Come on, Buddy. Come on, Buddy. You with me? You with me? Come on, come on.",
        "Margo: Casey, you're safe. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, Honey. Open your eyes.",
        "Casey: You're here.",
        "Tom: Yeah, we're here. We're here.",

        "Katie: Wow, you must be excited.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I think that they're probably -- probably, they just did it because they know that I'm at the end of my rope, and they feel very sorry for me.",
        "Katie: Do you think they know the divorce is going to be final soon?",
        "Carly: I think they know something's up. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Let's talk about something a little more cheerful, like the -- the job opportunity, right?",

        "Katie: I know. Of course you can. Nobody said that you couldn't.",
        "Carly: Well, every time I see you and mike, I see it in your eyes. I see you thinking it. \"Poor, dumb Carly, now with Jack out of the picture, she's going to fling herself at the first handsome guy who gives her the time of day.\"",
        "Katie: No, no. Don't go there. You are the one of the smartest people I have ever met.
