        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Sorry, I kind of have this habit of just showing up without calling first. It used to drive Aaron crazy and I can tell by the look on your face that you feel the same way. So, I'm just going to go --",
        "Gwen: No, no. Just a lot of information for me to process before I have coffee. Come in.",
        "Alison: Are you sure?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Alison: I guess it's not hard to figure out why I'm here. And I certainly don't mean to pressure you. I just -- I was kind of curious to see if you'd given any more thought to my offer. You know, to help?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I have. I thought about it a lot, actually. I just haven't had a chance to talk to Will yet.",
        "Will: Didn't have a chance to talk to me about what? Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Will: Do you guys want to fill me in on what's going on? Hello?",
        "Gwen: Last night, when you were out with your brother, Alison stopped by. And I was talking to her about our appointment with Dr. Akido.",
        "Will: Yeah?",
        "Gwen: I was filling her in about the in vitro, and the process of finding a donor.",
        "Will: Well, you remember what he said, I mean, we're a long ways off before we even need to start looking for someone's.",
        "Gwen: Maybe not. Alison offered to be the donor.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Alison: I know it sounds crazy, but I've really thought about it. And it's something I really, really want to do for you guys.",
        "Will: Alison, we're not asking to borrow your car. We're talking about a baby.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Will: No, I don't think you do. This isn't the kind of decision that you think about for just one night. I mean, we haven't even really decided --",
        "Gwen: Will, I want her to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Yeah, world civilization was not what I was expecting at all. And what's up with our professor with his word of the day?",
        "Roth: Fustigate.",
        "Luke: Fustigate, \"To beat with a stick.\"",
        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Oh, hi. I'm sorry, Noah, this is Roth.",
        "Noah: Hey. Do you have a minute?",
        "Luke: Uh, actually I don't. We were headed over to the bookstore. We've got, like, six dozen books for this one class --",
        "Noah: It's about the intern project. Kim's given us a deadline now that we're back in school. It's -- it's kind of important.",
        "Luke: Okay. Roth, I'm sorry, do you mind?",
        "Roth: No, not at all. I'll see you in class.",
        "Luke: You got it. See you. So, was there something wrong with the final edit?",
        "Noah: No, it's coming along. And I didn't know you knew that guy.",
        "Luke: Who, Roth? Oh, I don't. We just ended up sitting next to each other at class.",
        "Noah: You sat down next to him or he sat down next to you?",
        "Luke: What kind of question is that?",
        "Noah: Nothing, I just --",
        "Col. Mayer: Boys. Is everything all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Freeze. On your feet, ma'am.",
        "Katie: What's the problem, Detective?",
        "Jack: You know, we've had a complaint, an 807 in progress.",
        "Katie: 807?",
        "Jack: Yes, indecent exposure. You're not fully dressed. Can I have your arm, please?",
        "Katie: Jack.",
        "Jack: Yes, I had it sized this morning.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: Oh, my God, what?",
        "Katie: Do you see the time? I've got to go over to Margo's. I told her that I'd show her pictures of wedding dresses this morning. Where are they? No, no, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello? Come on, Sage. Hurry up, Babe. You're going to be late for school.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Honey, maybe you left them at your place. Or at the farm. You had them last night, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah. But I can't believe I would just leave them lying around.",
        "Jack: Okay, hold on a second -- hold on. Wait a second. You are going to find a beautiful wedding dress, okay? And I'm still going to be standing at the altar all tongue-tied and drooling.",
        "Katie: That's attractive.",
        "Jack: Yeah. So, what else? What else is going on in that pretty little noggin of yours? I can tell.",
        "Katie: Nothing, nothing.",
        "Jack: Oh, okay. Well, let's pretend for a second that I actually know you, and I'll ask you again, what's wrong?",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, you did go see Carly last night and you haven't said two words about it this morning.",
        "Jack: Ah, yes, I should've known that was bugging you.",
        "Katie: I'm trying not to think about it, really. I'm delving into the wedding planning, I'm not thinking about --",
        "Jack: Let me put you out of your misery then, okay? I told Carly and I made it very, very clear that she had no chance of taking me away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Oh, hey, Carly. Good morning.",
        "Carly: Well, good morning, Brad. Don't you look all bright-eyed and bushy- tailed.",
        "Brad: Why, thank you, pretty lady. You don't look so bad yourself. Although, I have to say I do miss you in that slinky little dress you were wearing last night. Come on, don't be bashful.",
        "Carly: Leave me alone, okay? I'm just waiting for my daughter.",
        "Brad: Well, you're going to be waiting a long time. Poppa Jack dropped them all off at school on his way into town.",
        "Carly: He did? I thought -- that's all right. I'm going to go.",
        "Brad: Hey, did you see these?",
        "Carly: Do you care?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I care.",
        "Carly: Why? Because you're such a good friend? Because you don't want to see my feelings hurt?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Carly: No, stop. You stop right there. You are not my friend. So don't you pretend that you are. Don't pretend that we're anything. I don't need you or anybody else to pretend anything anymore. Because it's over. I know it's over.",
        "Brad: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Look, I'm trying to help you.",
        "Carly: Help me? You're trying to help me?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Carly: This is your fault.",
        "Brad: Mine? What -- what did I do now, Carly?",
        "Carly: It's what you didn't do. If you had just done the one thing that I asked of you. You know, you've been messing up my life since the moment I met you.",
        "Brad: Is this helping? Taking it out on me, blaming me for everything -- is this helping you?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Brad: You know what the difference is here, is that I found a way to accept that Jack and Katie -- if they, they want to be together. You haven't.",
        "Carly: No. No, Brad, you gave up.",
        "Brad: No, I didn't give up. The fact is, somehow they just figured out how to be happy. That doesn't mean that we can't have that chance, too. Carly, we can. Just -- not with them.",
        "Carly: God, I'm tired -- I am so tired of this. I've got to go. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Brad: No. No, no, you can't drive --",
        "Carly: I can't be here! If they come back here and I'm here with all that stuff on the table. I can't do it.",
        "Brad: All right, okay. Okay. I will drive you. All you have to do is say you'll come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You actually got through to Carly this time? I'm almost afraid to believe it.",
        "Jack: So, we'll raise our kids and I will show you respect and I will do everything I can to make it easy on our children. But we're not friends anymore. Believe it. She knows that -- she knows how I feel and what I want. And she knows that isn't her anymore.",
        "Katie: Wow, that must've been hell for her to hear. She's been hanging on to the hope of you two for a long time. How does anyone let that go?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I just -- I guess you just get to that point that you finally hear what the other person is saying. And last night, Carly finally heard me. She knows that my heart is with you, Katie, and so is my future.",
        "Katie: And mine is with you.",
        "Henry: Great! The other half is here.",
        "Jack: Henry!",
        "Henry: Hey, did you -- did you tell jack about the party?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, Henry and Vienna want to throw us a wedding shower here at the diner.",
        "Henry: Yeah -- any special requests? Now, it's co-ed, okay? So we can't have any strippers or erotic dancers --",
        "Katie: Hey --",
        "Henry: I'm sorry to say -- okay, but we can do like cards and cigars.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Henry: Okay, great. Oh, is it okay if we serve pepparkakor? It's a -- it's -- it's a Vienna thing and I think she'll be really upset if we didn't have it.",
        "Katie: Then the answer is yes.",
        "Henry: Great. Great, I'll tell the chef.",
        "Jack: Wow.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. I'm really trying hard not to stress out, but Henry keeps talking about pepparkakor and I don't even know what our invitations are going to look like.",
        "Jack: Okay, okay, can I say something please? Can I say something? Just stop. All right, honey, listen. The best part of this wedding isn't going to be what the invitations look like. It's not going to be who sits at what table or pepparkakor. It's going to be the moment we start to share our lives together. Knowing that we wake up in the morning, it's not just -- it's not just Jack and Katie anymore. That we're husband and wife. With a whole lifetime of mornings ahead.",
        "Katie: Where?",
        "Jack: Where what?",
        "Katie: Where are these mornings going to be? Jack, in all the craziness of getting engaged and planning this wedding, we never stopped to figure out where we're going to live.",

        "Luke: Noah and I were just talking about our class schedule.",
        "Col. Mayer: I see. Are you two taking any classes together?",
        "Noah: No, sir.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, that's too bad.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm taking a lot of writing classes this semester. Well, look, I should get going.",
        "Col. Mayer: Hey, don't let me hold you up.",
        "Luke: See you around, Noah.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Maddie: Hey, is everything okay with Luke?",
        "Col. Mayer: Forget Luke. More importantly, how are you? Are you happy with your classes?",
        "Maddie: I am. I also -- I just got into a film seminar with Noah.",
        "Noah: We're also taking English Lit together every Tuesday and Thursday.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, that's fantastic. I'm sure you'll both be looking forward to that.",
        "Noah: Definitely. You know, actually, I have to go to the registrar's office. I realized that they gave me a class I didn't even take. Are you going to be around later?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, call my cell.",
        "Noah: Okay. Bye, Dad.",
        "Col. Mayer: Son. Maybe he'll add another class you two can take together. I can't imagine my son wanting you out of his sight even for a minute.",
        "Maddie: I am -- I am really flattered that -- that you think so highly of me, but um --",
        "Col. Mayer: Is there some reason I shouldn't?",
        "Maddie: Well, there's some things, not necessarily about me, but about my family that you should probably know.",
        "Col. Mayer: Please. I'm listening.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Well, you've met Henry, my brother. And I just -- I have a sister.",
        "Col. Mayer: Eve.",
        "Maddie: You know about her?",
        "Col. Mayer: Maddie, I'm army-trained. I know how to do a background search. I know all about what happened up at Raven Lake, what your sister did to those young people.",
        "Maddie: And you don't think about that when you look at me?",
        "Col. Mayer: No, I mean, the way I look at it, is that -- your sister's actions, however abhorrent, they're no reflection on you. I mean, you're two different people, are you not?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I guess that's why I'm kind of confused. I mean, you -- you like me so much and you think so much of me, but you barely know me.",
        "Col. Mayer: Here's what I know -- you have charm. You have grace, you have intelligence. And when I see my son with you, I know you are exactly the kind of girl he needs in his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, you want Alison to be the donor?",
        "Gwen: Will, this is our -- this is our chance to have a baby. We don't have to wait, we don't have to put ourselves on any list.",
        "Will: Don't you think we need to talk about this? Just you and me?",
        "Gwen: Does that mean that you'll consider it?",
        "Will: I think we need to talk about it first. I want to have a family with you and you know that. But, I think I get to be a part of the decision as to when and how we do that.",
        "Gwen: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Will: Okay, let's just slow down. We just saw the doctor. There's no need to rush, right?",
        "Gwen: I just -- I want this so much.",
        "Will: And I do, too. But I feel like you're putting me on the spot here.",
        "Gwen: I am and I'm sorry. That's not how I want this to go.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Alison, we're going to need some time.",
        "Alison: I totally understand. And I shouldn't have come running over here. I was just up all night getting really excited. And clearly I need to work on being patient.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you and me both.",
        "Alison: The last thing I want is for you guys to feel like I'm trying to push you into making a decision. So, just please take all the time you need. And I'll just go distract myself with some shopping or something. But just promise me you'll think about it, okay?",
        "Will: I will.",
        "Gwen: Will, come on. I mean, what's she offering, it's like the exact right thing at the exact right time. I mean, we have to say yes, don't we?",
        "Will: Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, all we have to do is find a place that can accommodate us, three kids, a rabbit and a turtle.",
        "Katie: We're going to get married, and we're going to be homeless.",
        "Jack: No, as soon as we get married, we're going on our honeymoon. And then when we get back from that, we're going to be homeless.",
        "Katie: Jack, you're not making me feel better. No, seriously, this is a problem. We have to solve this today.",
        "Jack: Wow, you're so adorable when you're crazed, did anybody tell you that?",
        "Henry: Okay, we need to review the guest list.",
        "Katie: No, Henry, we can't.",
        "Henry: If we don't, the chef won't know how much pepparkakor to make.",
        "Katie: Just stop saying that. I can't take you seriously when you say that.",
        "Jack: Uh, is that paper anybody's?",
        "Henry: No, I don't think so. Go ahead.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Henry: You can't opt out of everything here. This is your party.",
        "Katie: Yeah, our party that you're throwing.",
        "Henry: Don't you want to be a part of it? I mean, you're usually such a control freak about these sort of things.",
        "Katie: I know. And it's killing me. But Jack and I have no place to live right now.",
        "Jack: Classifieds, here we go.",
        "Henry: What are you talking about? The man has a farm with a barn.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and everybody in town is staying there. All the stalls in the barn are taken.",
        "Katie: Okay, here's what's going to happen. We're going to go find a place to live and you're going to plan the best wedding shower ever.",
        "Henry: But -- but Katie --",
        "Katie: Good-bye. Henry, wish us luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I think what Alison is offering to do is incredible. But it also has serious consequences. If we let Alison do this, then it's forever. She's always going to be in our lives, in our family. Are you really ready for that?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I'm willing to try. I'm willing to do anything to have our baby. Anything.",
        "Will: Well, some of the things she's done -- I mean, they affect your health. You know, I don't know if she'll get clearance to do something like this. I'm not judging her, I'm just being realistic.",
        "Gwen: But that's a risk that you take with any donor.",
        "Will: Those risks are higher with Alison.",
        "Gwen: The doctors will do tests before they decide to do anything. But if she is okay, and we say yes to her, it means that she's giving us the most amazing gift anyone could ever give.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Carly: You know something? I don't want to do this. I want to go home. I want to go back to bed.",
        "Brad: No. No, that is the worst thing you can do. You're going to go home, you're going to cry yourself to sleep. And then puffy eyes and bed head is no way to start a new life.",
        "Carly: You know something, Brad? Just because you graduated from con man to talk show host, does not mean that you know everything. So, save your life- coach routine for somebody else, okay?",
        "Brad: Look, I was just as busted up over Jack and Katie as you are.",
        "Carly: I seriously doubt that --",
        "Brad: But I found a way to move on.",
        "Carly: Oh, that must have been very difficult for you. You were infatuated with Katie for, what? Maybe a couple of months? You shared some air time with her? I shared a life with Jack!",
        "Brad: You know what? My feelings count, too. And I got past those feelings by throwing myself into work.",
        "Carly: Which you share with Katie.",
        "Brad: That is beside the point, okay? It gave me something to focus on. That's -- that's why we're here.",
        "Carly: You're working?",
        "Brad: No. You are. Okay, there's a guy staying here, he was on the show a couple of days ago. He's like some financial hotshot. He owns a bunch of businesses in Oakdale and Chicago. All right? But I'm thinking -- this is what I'm thinking, is that maybe he'll need an interior designer, or know someone who does. So we're going to call him, have him come down here, and you're going to have a meeting with him.",
        "Carly: No. No, I'm not. I'm not meeting with anybody. I'm not prepared.",
        "Brad: You'll wing it. You are great at that. Okay, so this is what I want you to do. I want you to go in there, pull yourself together. Okay, go. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, tell the realtor that we want to see the places on Riverside, definitely.",
        "Jack: I think you heard her. She wants to see the condos on Riverside.",
        "Katie: Not the ones on Jackson, though. They're awful.",
        "Jack: She wants to see the ones on Jackson, too.",
        "Katie: No, no, I said no.",
        "Jack: I was kidding, she put me on hold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: That's great, Ed. Yeah, we'll be waiting. All right --",
        "Carly: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Carly: Brad, they're in there. Jack and Katie are in there. They're looking for a place to live, they're crawling all over each other. There's no way I'm going to stay here and watch that.",
        "Brad: No. You're staying. They're the ones who are going to go.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No, I don't think so.",
        "Brad: Sweetheart, will you trust me? I'm going to herd them like cattle. Stay.",
        "Brad: No, no, no. No --",
        "Jack: Oh, Braddington --",
        "Brad: You two -- you two got to go. You can't stay here.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: Because in like ten minutes, I've got this incredibly hot woman coming to meet me for a date, and I would like some privacy.",
        "Jack: Here? Isn't Yo's more your speed there, Bradley?",
        "Brad: Ha, funny, funny. No, she's a fan, okay, she knows the show. If she sees Katie --",
        "Jack: She knows the show? So, you're dating a fan?",
        "Katie: That's probably not a good idea, Brad.",
        "Brad: You two are the only ones that are allowed to find a little happiness? A little companionship?",
        "Katie: No, we want you to be happy.",
        "Brad: You can't cut me some slack here? I need this, okay? I have been so cool to you guys, you're making me beg here.",
        "Katie: Okay, we're going. We're going. We really don't want to witness your mating rituals.",
        "Jack: Good luck --",
        "Brad: I don't need it. Thank you.",
        "Katie: Have fun.",
        "Brad: What did I tell you? Like cattle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey, I took a look at the final edit, made some notes. It looks very good.",
        "Noah: Yeah? Thanks.",
        "Luke: Figured I should do it now, you know, with school starting.",
        "Noah: Yeah, you'll probably be busy with other stuff soon, right?",
        "Luke: Well, I hope so. It is college, you know?",
        "Noah: I'm sure you and Roth will be out partying it up or whatever.",
        "Luke: Me and Roth? Why do you say something like that?",
        "Noah: I saw him at one of the gay and lesbian tables, filling some stuff out when I was signing up for classes.",
        "Luke: Yeah, so?",
        "Noah: So, I mean, he's gay, right?",
        "Luke: Noah, are you jealous?",
        "Noah: No, I'm not. Why do you always do that?",
        "Luke: Do what? Have coffee with guys? I don't know, maybe because I'm gay.",
        "Noah: No. Why do you always read into everything I say?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe it's because you never say exactly what you mean. You know what, Noah? Roth and I had class. We went for coffee, once. I didn't ask him out, he didn't ask me out. But either way? It's none of your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I had this really weird conversation with Noah's dad and I don't know what to really make of it.",
        "Henry: A weird conversation with colonel starch and stripes? I don't believe it.",
        "Maddie: You know how he was when he walked in on you and Vienna?",
        "Henry: Yeah, it was pretty awkward. I think the guy never seen skin before.",
        "Maddie: I'm under the impression that if he ever walked in on Noah and me --",
        "Henry: Whoa, whoa, visuals.",
        "Maddie: Sorry. Sorry. Is Vienna around?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, I can -- I can do this. I can do this, okay? Just proceed without the visuals.",
        "Maddie: It's not a big deal. What Noah and I do together, it's not a big deal. But, if it's just Noah -- if he so much as ties his tie crooked, his father is all over him. I don't understand it.",
        "Henry: He holds him to different standard, Sweetheart. Maybe not a realistic one, but it is what it is.",
        "Maddie: I guess.",
        "Henry: Noah's his son. It's just different. Be thankful that he's spending all this time judging Noah and not poking around about our lives. If he found out about Eve, he would take Noah and go AWOL.",
        "Maddie: Oh, no, he already knows.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. He did a background check or something like that. And he knows all about Eve, doesn't care. All he cares about is that Noah and I are together. And it's really weird because it's like he is more invested in us than we are.",
        "Henry: Well, it could be worse. He could dislike you.",
        "Maddie: That's funny. That's impossible. It's very hard to dislike.",
        "Henry: That is so true. You know what? Let me give you some advice here. Forget about the whole thing. Go off and be a college freshman, okay? And live with your boyfriend. And top the dean's list. And so on. Just focus on making me proud, okay?",
        "Maddie: Okay. Thank you. I knew that you would make me feel better.",
        "Henry: What is this? I give you advice and you just take off?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I have to get some stuff for the apartment, but I promise that whenever we are moved in, I will have you and Vienna over.",
        "Henry: Okay. I can't wait.",
        "Col. Mayer: Yes?",
        "Henry: Uh, Colonel Mayer, this is Henry Coleman.",
        "Col. Mayer: Hello, Henry.",
        "Henry: Sir, I was wondering if you could stop by the diner. I'd like to talk to you about something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, some of things that she's gotten involved in, they're serious. She had a meth addiction. You know, she's still in recovery. I don't know if she's ready to jump into a commitment like this.",
        "Gwen: And maybe this is exactly what she needs to feel better about herself.",
        "Will: So you honestly think that she's ready to be the mother of our child?",
        "Gwen: She would be the donor. I would be the mother of our child.",
        "Will: That's not what I'm saying. See, how you just reacted, though? I don't think she's the right choice for us. I'm just being honest.",
        "Gwen: Well, then, can I be completely honest with you? You're my whole life. I love you more than I ever thought possible.",
        "Will: I know that. And it's not about that.",
        "Gwen: But when I was pregnant with our child, I felt connected to you in a way that I can't even describe. It's like having a part of you, a part of us inside of me and suddenly it became so incredibly clear to me why I found you. Why you came to into my life when you did. It's so we could make this family that we've never had. To have this child this way. Please, Will, we've waited so long to be happy. Don't make us wait any longer than we have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Oh, you're here.",
        "Col. Mayer: I said ten minutes.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and it's been exactly ten minutes. Very punctual.",
        "Col. Mayer: What can I do for you, Henry?",
        "Henry: Uh, Sir, I want to apologize for what you walked in on with me and Vienna yesterday.",
        "Col. Mayer: No apology necessary, Son.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Well, I'd like to make it up to you, and I thought maybe, we could all go out to dinner and send Noah and Maddie off to college.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, I would like that. I think they would like that, too.",
        "Henry: Great. Good. I wasn't sure.",
        "Col. Mayer: You -- you weren't?",
        "Henry: Well, I didn't want to impose on the kids. And I haven't really even met Noah yet, so I wasn't sure if dinner parties were his cup of tea or not.",
        "Col. Mayer: You haven't met my son? That's ridiculous. I raised him better than that. Let me call the boy and get him down here.",
        "Henry: No, no. It's okay. It's perfectly all right. From everything Maddie has told me, I'm sure that he's the perfect gentleman.",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, that's very nice to hear. I'm glad he's found someone like your sister. She's good for him.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, on the surface, they sound they seem like a perfect couple, don't they?",
        "Col. Mayer: \"On the surface?\" Now I'm confused. You don't approve?",
        "Henry: No, no -- I do. I approve very much. It's just -- the problem I have sir, if I may, is the living situation. I'm sure a man like yourself with a strong moral code may have the same -- reservations.",
        "Col. Mayer: Which would be what?",
        "Henry: Maybe too much, too soon. I mean, come on, aren't they a little young to make this sort of commitment?",
        "Col. Mayer: No. Oh, not at all. I think the best thing that could've happened to my son is for he and Maddie to move in together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Luke, I like you, you know that. But as a friend.",
        "Luke: A friend?",
        "Noah: Yeah. And I know I gave you mixed signals and confused you and hurt you, but I never meant to do that.",
        "Luke: You know what, Noah? You're right. You did hurt me. But hey, at least you're being honest about your feelings now. You don't want me with another guy, not because you're gay or jealous, it's because you're my straight friend.",
        "Noah: Luke, I just want you to be happy, okay? Like I am with -- Maddie.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I cannot believe you just said that to me.",
        "Noah: Sorry. That's -- that was -- that was totally unfair.",
        "Luke: And that is totally not the kind of relationship that I want. You know what -- ahh! I am so done! I have got to move on.",
        "Noah: What, with Roth?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Maybe. Or if not him, someone else. I mean, there's tons of guys on campus who are gay, and out, and comfortable with who they are.",
        "Noah: Guys like you?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Guys like me -- who don't want to live a lie for the rest of their life.",

        "Brad: I don't know if you were able to see those waterfront properties, but those condos, those were Carly from head to toe.",
        "Ed: I heard those sold in record time.",
        "Brad: It did.",
        "Ed: May I ask you what your inspiration was for the design?",
        "Carly: Um, I just suppose that I just thought that something sort of fresh and modern would be good. You know, because the buildings were new.",
        "Ed: I see.",
        "[Brad laughs]",
        "Brad: Okay. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Don't let this one fool you. She's quiet and shy, but underneath all that, she's a tiger, all right? And her mind is bursting with ideas, you know? Excuse me, sorry. She's the artistic type, and doesn't like to talk about the creative process. Feels like it ruins the flow, right? Right?",
        "Ed: Well, I just acquired some property here in town and I've been working with a designer from a firm in Chicago. Unfortunately, we weren't quite seeing eye-to-eye.",
        "Brad: You don't say --",
        "Ed: So, I know your work on those condos was a definite selling point. Maybe I could show you around, we could brainstorm a few ideas.",
        "Brad: She'll be there. She will be there. With her sketch pad. You will not be disappointed.",
        "Ed: All right. Well, I'll be in touch, then. Thank you, Brad.",

        "Carly: Ed.",
        "Brad: Is that how you win over a potential client? Do you have any idea what I went through in order to set up that meeting? I mean, the least you could've done is just sit there without being all glossy-eyed!",
        "Carly: What do you mean, \"What you did to set up that meeting?\" What did you do -- you made a phone call? A phone call I didn't ask you to make.",
        "Brad: You know what? You got to pull it together. Fast. Otherwise, you're gonna lose everything.",

        "Katie: Okay, so I talked to Margo. I told her that I wouldn't be able to meet her this morning, because you and I don't have a place to live! I think she was actually kind of relieved. I don't think she wanted to look at a bunch of wedding dresses.",
        "Jack: Speaking of looking, are we going to check out this listing with the vaulted ceilings and exposed beams, 'cause --",
        "Katie: Well, yeah, I was thinking about that, but it's going to be hard to heat in the winter.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Katie: No. La la la la la la -- I found the best one. Where is it -- right there. This one. We have to see this one.",

        "Gwen: We wanted to talk to you, but we didn't want to do it over the phone.",
        "Alison: Oh. That was fast. So, I guess that means no. Which I completely understand. I probably wouldn't choose me as a donor, either.",
        "Gwen: Alison. It's -- yes. Our answer is yes.",
