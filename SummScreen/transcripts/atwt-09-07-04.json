When he shows up there with flowers, Emma douses him with a bucket of water and threatens him with a hide full of buckshot if he returns. Hal tries to discuss with Parker that Jack is really gone, but when Emily interrupts them, Hal and Emily argue. Emily finally gets Hal to understand that Parker and Carly are just trying to deal with their grief and that until more substantial proof is found that Jack is really gone, he should let them hope.

        "Nikki: Okay, show us what you got.",
        "Jennifer: Two aces.",
        "Henry: Nikki?",
        "Nikki: Hmm. I don't know. Is this what they call a straight flush?",
        "Henry: What the --?",
        "Nikki: I told you, Coleman, I play for keeps.",
        "Jennifer: How about you, Mike?",
        "Mike: I got nothing.",
        "Nikki: Mike loses again. This is not your night. But look on the bright side, the rock the vote campaign can use all the help we can give it.",
        "Jennifer: Too true. Oh, poor Mikey. Pants?",
        "Nikki: Oh, yeah. Pants. Off, my friend.",
        "Jennifer: Come on, Mike. Don't be shy. We're all friends here.",
        "Nikki: Oh, wait -- maybe he could use some music to help him out.",
        "[Yelling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Perfect. You're here in time for me to take you to dinner.",
        "Lily: I don't think so.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: We need to talk.",
        "Craig: What about?",
        "Lily: I don't know how to tell you this, but --",
        "Craig: You can tell me anything, there's no need for formalities.",
        "Lily: I think it's time you moved out of the guest house and find another place to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Emma: You know, you can't ignore this phone forever! Or maybe you can.",
        "Rosanna: I can almost ignore everything in that beautiful garden of yours.",
        "Emma: Gardening by sunset. Aren't they lovely?",
        "Rosanna: Thanks you so much for letting me hide out here.",
        "Emma: You know that you're welcome here anytime, my sweetheart. And it's only natural that you want to run away and hide after -- after what you've been through. Oh, lord, I feel like doing that myself, sometimes. But you have to remember that there are some people who love you. And they're probably pretty worried about you by right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Even before Parker almost drowned in the pond, he had this incredible connection with Jack. And he's always felt things none of the rest of us feel.",
        "Emily: I know, I remember how freaked you were after the pond incident. Some of the things he said to you --",
        "Carly: Well, he said he saw Jack that Jack is the one who sent him back to me.",
        "Emily: Right, that Jack was standing right behind him. This is giving me chills.",
        "Carly: No matter how hard I've tried to convince parker that Jack is gone, he just won't hear it.",
        "Carly: You know, now you sound like your husband.",
        "Emily: What else did Hal say?",
        "Carly: When he found out that I asked a psychic -- a psychic who has worked with the Oakdale PD, by the way -- to talk to Parker, he had the nerve to compare me to Barbara.",
        "Emily: Please tell me he didn't do that.",
        "Carly: Oh, he did. Then he told that I'm playing mind games with my own child, encouraging him to believe things that just aren't true. And then he went on about how he's not gonna allow another one of his sons to -- blah, blah, blah.",
        "Emily: Please tell me what I can do to help -- anything.",
        "Carly: Don't let Hal crush Parker's hopes. Parker believes that Jack is out there somewhere. What if he is, Emily? What if?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Wait a second -- you ran out of the club so fast, we didn't get a chance to talk.",
        "Julia: I don't want to put a damper on your opening night, okay? You were amazing. The people loved you, Jack. They couldn't get enough of you.",
        "Jack: I don't want to talk about the people. I want to talk about you. I wanna talk about us.",
        "Julia: There's really nothing to talk about.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry I kissed you. Wait a minute, what am I apologizing for? I'm not sorry. It's something I've wanted to do again for a long time. I'm sorry if it was more than you were ready for, but, Julia, if you're upset at me, you gotta tell me.",
        "Julia: Jack, did I look like I was upset? Resisting?",
        "Jack: But you're pulling away again. Why?",
        "Julia: Because I'm afraid if you kiss me again, that I won't be able to stop.",
        "Jack: Then we won't have to.",
        "Julia: Yeah, we do, Jack. You can't start something with me that you can't finish.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Julia: I can't give my heart to a man who's gonna walk out on me.",
        "Jack: Julia --",
        "Julia: What? I can't do that, Jack. Because if I do, then I don't -- I don't know what's gonna happen when you leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: That's the way to work it!",
        "Jennifer: Hey, we should have dollar bills.",
        "Nikki: Dollar bills are only for experienced professionals. I do not think Mike has perfected his routine yet.",
        "Henry: I've got an idea!",
        "Mike: It's about time! I'm dying here.",
        "Henry: Martinis!",
        "Nikki: Martinis? Now?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I think a little class added to the festivities. I've got my emergency martini kit out in the car. Would you care to join me, Mr. Kasnoff?",
        "Mike: Thought you'd never ask.",
        "Nikki: Now, wait a second, Mr. Kasnoff. You are not gonna weasel your way out of this. When you get back, your pants are history.",
        "Jennifer: Did you see the look on Mike's face?",
        "Nikki: Could he be too cute? Oh, my gosh.",
        "Jennifer: That's not cute, that's hot.",
        "Nikki: Yeah.",
        "Jennifer: Look all you like, big sister, but that heart belongs to somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna, it's me again, for like, the --",
        "Rosanna: Hello, stranger.",
        "Holden: I heard you were out here.",
        "Rosanna: Hope my secret's safe with you?",
        "Holden: Of course it is.",
        "Rosanna: Hello, Natalie. Look at you. Wow, you've gotten so big.",
        "Holden: You ought to see her when it's time for bed. She turns into a little monster.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no. She's an angel. Let's take this. Look at this. Isn't that pretty? Now you look like a fairy princess, huh? Here you go.",
        "Holden: I don't know if you had the chance to read the letter that Lily and I sent over with the flowers, but we when we heard about Cabot, we were both pretty broken up.",
        "Rosanna: Right. Thank you for that. Listen, I'm sorry I can't talk more, I have to go. I have to --",
        "Holden: No, wait a second. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought that up.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's okay. It's okay, really. I'm sorry. I have things I have to take care of. I'll see you sometime soon, right?",
        "Holden: Okay, take care.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Bye, Natalie.",
        "Emma: Holden? Hey, I thought I heard a little bunny rabbit out here. Hello there.",
        "Holden: Rosanna just left.",
        "Emma: Oh, yeah?",
        "Holden: She looks good all things considered. Seems a lot stronger.",
        "Emma: Well, looks can be deceiving. I mean, sometimes, there's a lot boiling under the surface.",
        "Holden: Why does that seem like it's directed towards me?",
        "Emma: Because I didn't raise any fools. So, have you started to straighten things out at home? And if not, why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Carly, what is your gut telling you? Do you believe Parker?",
        "Carly: I'm not sure what to believe anymore. All I know is that if I keep asking questions, Hal's gonna try to take my son away from me.",
        "Emily: He's not gonna do that. He would never do that.",
        "Carly: He just doesn't understand that I need more proof. Once I have that, we can move on. But now, what proof do I have that Jack is gone? Jack Snyder existed. He read bedtime stories and he burned waffles and he left his towel on the bathroom floor, and he loved us. He didn't just disappear.",
        "Emily: I know, but, honey, sometimes in circumstances like this, you want to hold on --",
        "Carly: I'm not asking you to believe me. I'm not asking you to humor me. Just please, get your husband to back off so Parker and I can live in peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Do you remember that lizard we bought last summer at the fireman's carnival?",
        "Parker: You mean Harvey?",
        "Hal: Right, Harvey. Do you remember how one morning we woke up and Harvey wasn't moving anymore?",
        "Parker: Yeah. We buried him out there in the yard.",
        "Hal: Yeah, that's right. And then we said a few words about what a good ol' lizard Harvey had been, and then, we said a few words about heaven. Remember that?",
        "Parker: That was sad.",
        "Hal: Yeah, it sure was. Parker, you ever think Jack is up in heaven, too?",
        "Parker: We didn't bury Jack.",
        "Hal: No, we didn't, that's right. Because sometimes, all we're left with is memories. But we still have to find a way to say good-bye. And you see, that's why we had that memorial service. It's to help us accept the truth. And the truth is that Jack is gone. It's just like Harvey's gone. And Jack is not coming back. Do you understand that?",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Hal: Good.",
        "Parker: But how do you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Sooner or later, someone's gonna come knocking on that door, kid. And she's gonna say that you're the love of her life and you're the father of her beautiful kids. And she's gonna take you away and you'll never look back.",
        "Jack: Hey, you don't know that.",
        "Julia: I do. Trust me, Jack. Someday, it's all gonna come back to you. This life that you used to have, and this family that you love more than anything else in the whole world. And when that happens, you'll walk out of our life and back into theirs and then it will be like this never happened and you're gonna forget all about me like I never existed and I can't go through that.",
        "Jack: Okay, if there is a true love out there, if someone is important to me that's looking for me, don't you think they would have found me by now?",
        "Julia: I think that there are a billion reasons, Jack, why that hasn't happened yet.",
        "Jack: Well, I can tell you one reason why. Because there is no one else.",
        "Julia: Jack, come on. You don't know that.",
        "Jack: I know this -- when I look at you, I have no past. There is no one but you, Julia. There is no time but now. And you and JJ and this life -- that make me happy, unbelievably happy. I don't want to lose that. I don't want to lose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Where's Natalie?",
        "Holden: She's outside with Ernie, feeding the horses.",
        "Emma: Well, now that you don't have Natalie here to distract you from answering, how are things with you and Lily? Are you working things out?",
        "Holden: We're trying. We had a nice, long talk earlier today.",
        "Emma: Well, that sounds good. And?",
        "Holden: And we've decided that we're going to work on the situation.",
        "Emma: Well, that sounds all warm and fuzzy.",
        "Holden: Well, it certainly wasn't the most romantic moment in our lives. But Lily said that she wants to save our marriage, and that's what I needed to hear.",
        "Emma: And what about you? Are you still committed to the marriage?",
        "Holden: Of course. And Lily has agreed to take the first step.",
        "Emma: Mm-hmm. And what would that be?",
        "Holden: She's gonna go on a crash diet. She's gonna cut 200 pounds of annoying fat out of our lives. His name is Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, I'm getting the old heave-ho.",
        "Lily: Oh, would you stop? Don't say it like that.",
        "Craig: What brought about this decision?",
        "Lily: Molly McKinnon left town.",
        "Craig: Oh, and of course, no need to inform me. I'm just her business partner. You get rid of her?",
        "Lily: No, I didn't do that. No, she did it of her own free will.",
        "Craig: Molly has no free will. She has great hormones and bad instincts.",
        "Lily: Well, she did realize she was interfering in our marriage, so --",
        "Craig: What an epiphany.",
        "Lily: And if Holden and I are going to focus on each other, we need to stay away from things that distract us from each other and our children.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. Holden think I'm interfering?",
        "Lily: I'm sorry to do this to you. I'm so sorry.",
        "Craig: No, for what? You took me in. I'll always be grateful for that.",
        "Lily: I know, but we've been through so much together and you've been through so much and -- you saved my life. You don't deserve this. You don't.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe not. But I will always be grateful and you've been a friend to me and given me more than I even have the right to expect. So let me return the favor.",
        "Lily: You don't hate me?",
        "Craig: Never. Never. But can you me a week to find a new place?",
        "Lily: No. Yes.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: Of course. Whatever you need.",
        "Craig: What I need is for you to remain my friend.",
        "Lily: Of course.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Lily: I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for you. I don't know how to repay you for that.",
        "Craig: Hey, hey, hey. Come on, no tears. No tears. You'd better get home before Holden starts worrying about you, all right?",
        "Lily: Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Craig: Of course I'm right. You know how fragile Holden is. I'd better come with you and break the news myself.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. All right. Please.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lily: Your best behavior?",
        "Craig: Me? Always. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Leave it up to me, Mike. I know what I'm doing, Mike.",
        "Henry: I do, I do!",
        "Mike: Well, then why am I the one losing my shirt and my pants?",
        "Henry: They just had a good stroke of luck. Now, just give it time.",
        "Mike: They've had plenty of time. Between the two of them, they've lost a watch and a couple of earrings.",
        "Henry: Mike, I'm gonna make my powerball martinis. They're never gonna know what hit 'em.",
        "Mike: Mm-hmm. Or I could be dancing for dollars within the hour. And forget it.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. You can't give up now. I promise you, this entire evening is going to take a nice, big turn for the better, all right? Trust me.",
        "Mike: Trust you. I am down to my boxers and you're the guy that I'm supposed to trust? I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: I do not have the hots for Mike.",
        "Jennifer: Great poker face.",
        "Nikki: You said he's hot, I agreed. I'm only human. And if the guy ends up in his birthday suit at the end of the night, I won't be disappointed.",
        "Jennifer: Dream on. And what if our luck changes?",
        "Nikki: It's not.",
        "Jennifer: How do you know?",
        "Nikki: Easy. I cheat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Did miss me?",
        "Carly: Like you would not believe.",
        "Rosanna: I'm so sorry I didn't call.",
        "Carly: Don't apologize. We are both going through very tough times.",
        "Rosanna: I know. But you shouldn't have to go through it alone, and I just had to disappear for a little while.",
        "Carly: Well, it looks like it's done you good. You look calm.",
        "Rosanna: Some days are better than others. Just have to do some letting go -- of Jordan and Paul and promises that couldn't be kept. I said goodbye to Fairwinds, too.",
        "Carly: Where are you gonna live?",
        "Rosanna: At Emma's for a little while, anyway. I highly recommend disappearing, if you can.",
        "Carly: Well, I wish there were certain people I could get to disappear. Others I could get to reappear.",
        "Rosanna: Sounds like you could use my help.",
        "Carly: Parker could, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I know how much you miss Jack. I miss him, too. We worked together a long, long time. Jack's spirit lives on. His memory lives on, but Jack himself --",
        "Emily: Hey, guys. Parker, how's it going, baby?",
        "Hal: Parker, why don't you run upstairs, see what Daniel's up to. We'll talk some more later on, okay?",
        "Emily: Sorry, did I interrupt something?",
        "Hal: Parker doesn't want to believe that Jack's dead, so Carly's letting him live in a fantasy world.",
        "Emily: Well, you know, kids believe what they want to believe.",
        "Hal: And it's up to their parents to correct them when they're wrong.",
        "Emily: Carly's grieving, Hal. She's alone and confused. She had no body to bury.",
        "Hal: We searched that river for days. What more could we do?",
        "Emily: I don't know. What's the harm in giving her a few days -- some time to wrestle with all of this? Isn't that the real basis of faith? To believe in something, even when there is no proof?",
        "Hal: Yes. But here, it's the basis for insanity, and I can see where you've been today. Carly's brainwashed you, too.",
        "Emily: Why can't you just try to see things from her perspective? Just --",
        "Hal: And why can't you see things from mine, Emily? Would it kill you to be more supportive of the way I raise my kids?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hal may be the father of your child, but he has no right to control your life.",
        "Carly: You don't know the half of it. If I keep looking for Jack the way Parker wants me to, Hal has threatened to take away my son.",
        "Rosanna: Well, if you do keep looking for Jack, don't tell Parker. That way Hal won't find out. I think you should do what Jack would do if you were the one that was missing.",
        "Carly: Hire the best private detective around.",
        "Rosanna: And don't stop searching until you find him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: I'm glad you're happy, Jack.",
        "Jack: Well, what about you? Do I make you happy?",
        "Julia: I think you know that you do.",
        "Jack: But you want me to go.",
        "Julia: It's not about what I want, Jack. I can't let myself get more involved, because this little house is just a pit stop on your way home.",
        "Jack: You're so sure that this is temporary. What if you're wrong? What if there's no one else looking for me? What if I don't remember anything about the accident, before I woke up in the hospital and saw your beautiful face looking back at me? Do you really want to walk away before we even give it a chance? In fear of something that may never come to pass?",
        "Julia: I've been hurt before.",
        "Jack: Forget about before. Everything begins right now -- tonight.",
        "Julia: I don't know.",
        "Jack: No, listen -- stop thinking and start feeling, Julia. What do you want? Don't you want to see where this goes?",
        "Julia: What about --",
        "Jack: Forget -- forget about everything but this moment, right now. What do you want right now?",

        "Lily: Oh, I feel the same about you.",
        "Holden: When you see Mommy you can tell her what we have been doing.",
        "Lily: Hey, what've you got there? Let me see, I think I know what this is -- peaches from Grandma's orchard.",
        "Craig: Hi, Holden.",
        "Holden: Craig.",
        "Craig: I was just thanking Lily for your generosity because I believe I have imposed long enough upon you. And I'm gonna move out as soon as I find a place.",
        "Holden: Really? Well, good luck with that. And I'm gonna put these in the kitchen.",
        "Craig: He's just cuddly, isn't he?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Look, thank you so much for understanding.",
        "Craig: Oh, personal space is my middle name. All right. Okay.",
        "Lily: Bye.",

        "Hal: Carly is filling Parker's head with some nonsense about Jack being alive.",
        "Emily: Carly isn't filling Parker's head with anything. And if you believe that, you don't know the first thing about Parker or Carly. God, I'd hate to think you don't trust Carly.",
        "Hal: Of course I trust her.",
        "Emily: Well, then why can't you open your mind to the possibility --",
        "Hal: You're asking me to stay silent and watch another of my sons unravel?",
        "Emily: I'm asking you to show Carly a little respect instead of treating her like a common criminal.",
        "Hal: I am trying very hard!",
