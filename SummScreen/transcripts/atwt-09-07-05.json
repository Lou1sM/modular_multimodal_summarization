        "[Keith remembering]",
        "Lucinda: You've told me, and I believed you, all the good that you do delivering to people -- saving their lives. And I know, from my own point of view, that this treatment has helped me more than anything else.",
        "Keith: You do what you want. You just leave me out of it.",
        "Lucinda: Please, I don't have time to argue.",
        "Keith: Damn it, you're asking me to lie to your daughter!",
        "Lucinda: Nothing new there. You've been lying to her since the day you met.",
        "Lily: You are such a liar.",
        "Keith: Listen, I can explain. Well, whatever I did, I should do again. What did you think I was lying about?",
        "Lily: You said you had a last-minute flight. And here you are, sipping coffee.",
        "Keith: I was just gonna leave for the airport.",
        "Lily: Don't. 'Cause I need you.",
        "Keith: What's the matter?",
        "Lily: I just grounded my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What kind of trip could you possibly be taking with Keith?",
        "Lucinda: Hi, darling. Were you expected, 'cause Lily's not here?",
        "Holden: I came to see you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, how sweet. Thank you. We're gonna have to visit another time, because I've got an appointment.",
        "Holden: With Keith?",
        "Lucinda: You overheard me on the phone? Yeah, I have -- with Keith. You know, Remington. The day trader who's always asking me to go to Tahiti with him. And I should go.",
        "[Lucinda chuckles]",
        "Holden: Uh-huh.",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: I'm about to hit redial.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, bullying does not become you.",
        "Holden: Says the woman who practically invented it.",
        "Lucinda: I haven't done anything wrong. Please, excuse me, I'm really tired. I've -- enough, for now, please.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. You know what I'll do, I'll just call him on my own cell phone. Better yet, I'm gonna track him down and get him to tell me what's going on with you two.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh, gosh. Oh.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm -- I'm -- I'm --",
        "Holden: You want me to get a doctor?",
        "Lucinda: I'm so tired. I'm really tired. No, I don't want a doctor.",
        "Holden: All right, well, just rest.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Holden: I'll get you anything you need.",
        "Lucinda: Rest, yeah.",
        "Holden: And once you've rested --",
        "Lucinda: I don't need anything, it's unnecessary.",
        "Holden: Then you can tell me what you're planning. And if you don't do it, I'll just make sure that Keith does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This can't be. Oh, Jennifer. Oh, Jennifer. Crystal meth. Friend, you're in big trouble.",
        "Jennifer: Jasmine, I have never felt this good. I am so creative. And talking to the press now is so easy. It's like I'm my old self again, only better. How many times do I have to say this to you? I am fine. You are the one who hooked me up with the stuff in the first place. Why don't you just stay off my back! Oh, damn you!",
        "Dusty: I didn't do it. It wasn't me this time, I swear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I have a proposition for you. Instead of waiting until tomorrow, how would you like to see Rory today?",
        "Gwen: You got him in your back pocket?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: No, I just -- I've been thinking, it's such a beautiful day outside and I'm going to be taking him out to the main street courtyard.",
        "Gwen: What does that have to do with me?",
        "Carly: Well, if you want to see him, that's where we'll be. Just come on down.",
        "Gwen: You're going to let me see my baby a day before the court says you have to?",
        "Carly: That's right.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Carly: Just consider it a favor.",
        "Gwen: From you? Hmm.",
        "Carly: Okay, fine. Gwen, if you don't want to see him -- if you don't want to see your son, it's no skin off my nose.",
        "Gwen: Good. See you.",
        "Carly: I don't know why I expected anything from you. You say you want your baby more than anything in the world, but that is really just an act, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: Don't you ever get bored with calling me an unfit mother? I heard it, you know, the first 200 times.",
        "Carly: I'm just waiting for you to prove that you love your son.",
        "Gwen: I can't prove that I love my little boy. I -- are we done here?",
        "Carly: You know, I find it very difficult to be away from my children for a day. If I couldn't even see them for weeks -- how can you turn down a chance to see your baby, even for a moment?",
        "Gwen: Well, you think you're doing me this big favor, making me this generous offer? This hurts a million times worse than those stupid pictures you took.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Gwen: Because I don't want to say no. I want to see him.",
        "Carly: Well, then do it, see him.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Carly: Come down to the courtyard.",
        "Gwen: I can't.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Gwen: Because of you. Of whatever you're planning to make me look bad again.",
        "Carly: Look, I am forcing myself to believe in you. Why can't you try and do the same thing with me?",
        "Gwen: Because if I do, and I'm wrong, then I lose everything. I want to see my little boy for more than a few minutes. And I don't want you there watching every move I make, taking stuff that you can take back to some judge. \"He cried for 3.2 seconds when she held him.\"",
        "Carly: No, Gwen, that's not gonna happen.",
        "Gwen: You're right. Because I won't let it happen.",
        "Carly: Do you think you're gonna win in court?",
        "Gwen: I don't think there's any way I won't win.",
        "Carly: I hope you don't. But if you do, I really couldn't stand one of those awful scenes where the baby is screaming and crying because he's being taken by somebody that he doesn't even know.",
        "Gwen: He knows me. I'm his mother.",
        "Carly: That's a very nice fantasy about how babies instinctively know their mothers. And maybe that's true for the first few moments after birth. But this has been weeks, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: You know what, 24 more hours won't make a difference. I'm seeing him tomorrow.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm, in a cold room. Surrounded by lawyers and social workers.",
        "Gwen: Well, at least I'll be with him and away from you.",
        "Carly: You despise me so much that you are willing to deny your son what he really needs? Gwen, more than anything, right now, Rory needs both of us to put him first.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I put him first. I've been getting things ready for him. I've been reading books about babies.",
        "Carly: Gwen, reading about mothering is a lot different from actually doing it. I'm giving you a chance for some hands-on experience. You do what you like. You know where we'll be. Come on, Gwen. Take the bait.",
        "Gwen: No way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You were there, you saw how angry my mother was.",
        "Keith: Yeah. And I hated to leave you and Sierra there, but I figured you two could double- team her, get her to say uncle.",
        "Lily: She didn't say anything near the word \"uncle,\" believe me. So, Sierra and I had to confiscate her passport and driver's license. There was no other way.",
        "Keith: I believe you. Sometimes your mother, you know -- she leaves you with no other choice.",
        "Lily: Hmm.",
        "Keith: You know, I really wanted to spend the night with you tonight.",
        "Lily: No, that's okay. You have to work. There'll be other times.",
        "Keith: Yeah, if I could get out of this flight -- if there was any way to get out of this.",
        "Lily: No, it's okay. Believe me, I understand. It's not like you're going out of the country, are you?",
        "[Lily chuckles]",
        "Keith: Not without you.",
        "Lily: Good. Then have a safe flight and come home soon.",
        "Keith: I will.",
        "Lily: So, how long do we have?",
        "Keith: Well, we got time for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I'm not ready to go solo yet. But Keith is gonna take over take-off and landing. But in the middle of that, it's all me. All the way to Chicago.",
        "Kevin: For real? No, man, I'm not buying that.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Kevin: Dude, he's just dating your mom, so he's gotta be nice to you. And he's probably just gonna put the plane on, like, automatic pilot or whatever and let you think you're flying it.",
        "Luke: No. Do you wanna bet? He's in there. Go ask him.",
        "Kevin: No, man, that's okay.",
        "Luke: I'm serious, go ask him. He'll tell you. I'm flying his plane all the way to Chicago today. So let's go. Hey, Mom. Hey, Keith.",
        "Lily: Hey.",
        "Keith: Hey.",
        "Lily: What are you guys doing here?",
        "Luke: Tell him.",
        "Keith: Tell me what? Oh, right, right, flying lessons.",
        "Luke: Yeah. See, Kevin here doesn't believe me that you're letting me fly your plane all the way to Chicago.",
        "Lily: Chicago? Are you sure he's ready for that?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm ready. We're going this afternoon. Right, Keith?",
        "Keith: Well, listen, it's not gonna happen today.",
        "Holden: Why are you heading off with Keith, of all people?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I want to. Gosh, I want to! Everybody's telling me what to do. Her, her, everyone -- I'm still me, although I'm sick! I'm still Lucinda Walsh, and I've toppled empires and I've battled wind-tossed seas and -- that's enough! That's enough!",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Holden: I've got an idea. Why don't I drive you? Come on, let's go.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want you to drive me.",
        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Lucinda: Because you're meddling.",
        "Holden: Yes, I am. Where is Keith taking you?",
        "Lucinda: Up, up and away. Nowhere.",
        "Holden: Sounds like fun.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, darling, don't try to horn in on this trip, because it's a two-seater, I think.",
        "Holden: Well then, you better tell me what's really going on here.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you mean, you think that I'm so dispirited and so disjointed and so distraught that I may go up in the plane with Lily's boyfriend and then decide to take us both down in fiery glory? Is that it?",
        "Holden: That thought never even crossed my mind. But the fact that it crossed yours, that's pretty scary.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm scary. I'm a scary lady. Just remember that. Look, it might be just that I'm trying to get to know Keith a little better, all right? Right. Is that it?",
        "Holden: One more question.",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Holden: Why did you fire Meg?",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Holden: I'm trying to get caught up here. This seems to be your day for bizarre behavior. This arrangement with Keith, you fire Meg --",
        "Lucinda: We had -- we didn't agree about certain things, and she couldn't work for me any longer.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Lucinda: Ask her! Oh, darling, what's the matter? Are you worried that if I spend time with Keith Morrisey, I'm gonna like him better than I like you?",
        "Holden: That's not possible because you're crazy about me.",
        "Lucinda: I am crazy about you. And you know why I'm crazy about you. Because you have consistently, wonderfully, enduringly loved my little girl. And if you won't move heaven and earth for that -- what you had -- I will.",
        "Holden: Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, by the way, darling. [Clears throat] I've had Meg's things packed up. So if you want to, you can collect meg's stuff and then, cart if off and be off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, why are you using your phone out here?",
        "Jennifer: It was private and I have company.",
        "Dusty: Oh. I just came by to apologize to you.",
        "Jennifer: Well, good. Go ahead.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe I shouldn't have gotten your mother involved, but I'm worried about you and I care about you, so shoot me.",
        "Jennifer: Well, too bad my derringer's at the cleaners.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you take a shot at me, then. I'm all yours.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I forgot to tell you that Meg was here. She and I have been talking fashion.",
        "Meg: You've been doing most of the talking. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Dusty: Are you?",
        "Jennifer: Why don't we go inside? You know, we don't need to linger out in the hallway.",
        "Meg: I need to talk to you.",
        "Jennifer: Come on, guys.",
        "Dusty: So, when did you become interested in the fashion business?",
        "Jennifer: She wanted to take a look at my designs.",
        "Dusty: Really? Really? I didn't know you cared.",
        "Meg: Well, there's tons you don't know about me. Or Jennifer, for that matter.",
        "Jennifer: That's the truth. Do you want something to drink?",
        "Dusty: No, thanks.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I am parched. How about you, Meg?",
        "Meg: No, I'm fine, thanks.",
        "Jennifer: Well, we ran into each other and we got to talking.",
        "Meg: Yeah. So Jennifer invited me over here to show me the new stuff you guys were working on. I was a little curious.",
        "Dusty: I bet. Would you excuse us? Jen and I have some business to go over.",
        "Meg: Yeah, okay. Could we get together later? I really do need to talk to you.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe I'm the one that should be leaving the two of you.",
        "Dusty: No. I'll see you at Java in half an hour.",
        "Meg: Jen, it was nice talking to you.",
        "Jennifer: Total blast.",
        "Meg: You know, if you ever want to hang out or vent, you could always call me.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you, I would like that.",
        "Meg: Half an hour.",
        "Dusty: Great.",
        "Meg: See you soon.",
        "Jennifer: Well, what do you know? Looks like I might have a new friend.",
        "Dusty: She's not your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: He's kidding. You're just -- you're kidding, right? You told me that we were gonna go up this afternoon. What --",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, something came up.",
        "Lily: Keith has to work.",
        "Luke: Since when?",
        "Keith: Today. You know, it happened fast, and I'm sorry. I meant to call you. I forgot.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, you forgot. That's --",
        "Kevin: I gotta take off. Bad choice of words, man, sorry.",
        "Lily: I know how excited you were.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well that makes one of you. What was it, a scam?",
        "Keith: What are you talking about?",
        "Luke: You were never going to take me up again, were you?",
        "Keith: Of course I was. But you know my job. These trips, they come up unexpectedly.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, yeah, I can see you're real busy right now.",
        "Lily: Luke.",
        "Luke: No, Mom, it's cool. See, now that you have what you want, you don't need me anymore. You can just blow me off whenever you please.",
        "Keith: No, I was gonna take you up when I get back.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna stand around and wait for that to happen.",
        "Keith: Hey, come on, come on. I promise.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. See, I'm not a little kid anymore. You can keep your fake promises.",
        "Lily: Luke.",
        "Keith: Wait a minute, all right? You better let him go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm just saying you should probably keep your distance from Meg. At least for a while.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I think she might be trying to get close to you to get close to me, you know what I mean? [Both laugh] What are you laughing at? I'm serious.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you really -- you really have too low of an opinion of yourself.",
        "Dusty: Right. What did you two talk about?",
        "Jennifer: Well, not to stroke your ego any more, but we did talk about you a little bit.",
        "Dusty: What did Meg say?",
        "Jennifer: I'll never tell.",
        "Dusty: But I need to know.",
        "Jennifer: It was girl talk. And you never tell your girlfriend's boyfriend what she said about him.",
        "Dusty: She called me her boyfriend?",
        "Jennifer: She was in your hotel room in your bed waiting for you. What was I supposed to think?",
        "Dusty: What else did she tell you?",
        "Jennifer: Look, I was just teasing you. We didn't talk about you that much.",
        "Dusty: What did she say?",
        "Jennifer: Well, she did wonder if you and I were together in Chicago.",
        "Dusty: She wondered that?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I started it. Because I said I couldn't stand you.",
        "Dusty: You said you couldn't stand me?",
        "Jennifer: I was being dramatic. Yes, but she was wondering why I was mad -- it was just talk, Dusty, okay? Just --",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: Stay away from Meg, okay? Okay?",
        "Jennifer: Okay. But that's really too bad, because I really could use a friend.",
        "Dusty: But you still have me.",
        "Jennifer: We're business partners.",
        "Dusty: We're more than that.",
        "Jennifer: So what are we?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Maybe we're the odd couple.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, that would be exactly it. All right, well, get out of here. 'Cause I gotta get some work done, you need to talk to Meg.",
        "Dusty: Remember what I said, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Hey. Okay, we're good. And hey, be sweet to her, 'cause she was really sweet to me.",
        "Dusty: Was she? Well, I'm not surprised.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: What is it?",
        "Lily: I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hello.",
        "Meg: Okay, Lily, don't start. I would have gone someplace else, but I'm meeting somebody here.",
        "Lily: I was just going to apologize to you for flying off the handle at my mother's. I appreciate you trying to help her. Thank you.",
        "Meg: Thanks for that. You know, whatever that clinic in Mexico was doing, I can't support it if it means Lucinda would discontinue her chemo.",
        "Lily: I know. But Sierra and I, we're doing our best to make sure our mother never goes back there again.",
        "Meg: Sure, whatever you say.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Meg: Come on, Lily, you know how Lucinda operates. When she wants something, she will do anything to get it. And nothing will stop her. Not even you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Did you get it?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, of course.",
        "Luke: Good, good, yeah. This actually looks like a 21-year-old version of me.",
        "Kevin: Well, it better. It cost me 50 bucks.",
        "Luke: All right, I'll stop by the ATM and get you cash. Come on, the first round of drink is on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, thanks for meeting me, Nancy.",
        "Nancy: I was happy to hear from you. And surprised. He's adorable.",
        "Carly: Yes. Oh, he is, isn't he?",
        "Nancy: Poor Rosanna. To adopt such a beautiful baby and never get to know him.",
        "Carly: I want to raise him for her, Nancy. I want to keep my promise to her. But now that the birth mother has decided to fight for custody, there's a real possibility she could get him back.",
        "Nancy: I see.",
        "Carly: That's why I invited Gwen here today. So she could spend some time with him.",
        "Nancy: You did?",
        "Carly: Well, yeah. That way, if the judge does give her custody, at least the baby will know her.",
        "Nancy: That's very generous, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, it's for Rory. We need to do what's best for him. I'm not even sure Gwen will show up.",
        "Nancy: Who could anyone stay away from that beauty?",
        "Carly: You made it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: I wanna know what is going on with Keith.",
        "Lucinda: Can you keep a secret?",
        "Nancy: Maybe you should give them some time alone.",
        "Carly: Do you really think I should?",
        "Meg: I found out something about Jennifer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I can't stay too long. I have a shift later at Al's.",

        "Lily: If you're so understanding, why did you bail on her?",
        "Meg: Because she thought that paying me meant that she could make me do something that would hurt her. I care about Lucinda, I didn't want to leave her, but -- you know, even when I'm gone, you find a way of accusing me of pulling some kind of power trip here. I just can't win with you, can I?",

        "Holden: Sometimes I think you lose sight of it, though. Sierra, Lily, the kids -- we don't put up with you because you topple dynasties and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We do it because we love you and because we worry about you.",
