        "Aaron surprises Allison while she is wedding dress shopping with Susan and Emily to give her a gift \u0096 her favorite box of chocolates. Allison teases Aaron about buying her this when she has to fit into her dress; they agree to hand out the gourmet chocolates at the rehearsal dinner that night. Dani convinces Casey to help her get a date with Chris; he finally gives in and agrees to help her. Chris calls Allison asking her to help with \u0091their puppy' since he is stuck at the hospital. Allison ends up blowing off wedding dress shopping to do as Chris asks, as Emily and Susan question her excuse of needing to take a nursing school test. Barbara tells Paul she can get him the money he needs to pay off the loan shark in a week so she wants him to tell James to leave. Henry is leery of Derek and Vienna is annoyed by Henry's attention to Bonnie's love life. Paul tells James he doesn't need him anymore. Paul meets with Derek and tells him that he needs a week and he will have his money. Derek tells him that they don't have a deal and then throws a subtle threat again against Meg and tells him that he has 24 hours. Paul asks Henry for a favor in getting Derek off of his back; Henry is unsure but then agrees. Chris runs into Allison at his room and they seem awkward with each other, so Allison leaves quickly but leaves her chocolates behind. Barbara reiterates to James that Paul doesn't need him anymore. Casey asks Chris to lunch, but then Dani shows up and Casey leaves and Chris smells a set up. Allison realizes she left her chocolates at Chris' and lies to Aaron to head back there. Henry makes some calls on Paul's behalf and realizes Derek was not sent by Henry's associate \u0096 but by some mysterious third party; Henry calls Vienna looking for Bonnie to warn her, which annoys Vienna even more. Chris tells Dani that he only wants to be friends. Allison arrives at Chris' and finds the puppy ate her box of chocolate; she calls Chris in a panic and he leaves Dani and races off claiming a hospital emergency, but she sees Chris head upstairs instead. Casey and Emily talk about their annulment, as Casey still wants to get married someday. Emily tells him that she doesn't want that based on her history; this upset Casey who reacts poorly. Derek lures Henry, who is following him, to the wine cellar at Fairwinds and to James. They trap Henry and order him to call Paul and tell him that Derek is dangerous and to do what he says. James and Derek lock Henry in the wine cellar. A frustrated Vienna is looking for Henry and assumes he is missing because of Bonnie. In front of Emily, who doesn't look pleased, Dani tells Casey their plan didn't work out. Chris and Allison nurse the puppy back to health and share a moment where they look about ready to kiss; Allison appears upset and Chris asks her what is wrong. She tells him it isn't all about the dog. Paul tells Barbara that Derek didn't go for his offer and so he has to stick with James; he has to continue to dig up around the Snyder farm until he finds the money no matter what. Aaron arrives at Lily's where many people are decorating for the wedding and wonders where his \u0091bride' is."

        "Susan: Ali, how about this one?",
        "Alison: Uh, not for me. But maybe for you. That one kind of screams mother of the bride.",
        "Emily: Yeah, not -- not so good.",
        "Susan: Oh, thanks for making me feel so young and glamorous.",
        "Alison: What about this one?",
        "Emily: With that neckline? Are you kidding me? Give it to me.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Emily: Alis--",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess it is kind of low.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, that works for me, too.",
        "Emily: Aaron?!",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Emily: What are you doing here?!",
        "Susan: Do you know what bad luck this is?",
        "Aaron: Ohh, come on! This is the 21st century. Are you guys really that superstitious?",
        "Emily: Uh, yeah.",
        "Alison: Well, I can't get this one.",
        "Susan: Obviously.",
        "Alison: Aaron, get out of here before my mom decides that any dress you might have seen is off-limits.",
        "Aaron: Well, can the groom at least give the bride a present before the wedding?",
        "Alison: Are you kidding? Of course. Oh, my God. I love these. Oh.",
        "Aaron: I know you do.",
        "Alison: Aaron Snyder, you are a cruel, cruel man.",
        "Aaron: Because I got you chocolates that you really love?",
        "Alison: Because you got me chocolates that I really love, and I have to fit into a wedding dress. Okay, you need to take these away from me now. Did you see what he just gave me?",
        "Susan: That's a pretty big box.",
        "Aaron: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Okay, but you're with me. You need to take these away from me, okay?",
        "Emily: Let's not be hasty. Let's not be hasty. I will be happy to take these to the rehearsal dinner, and everybody else can have them for dessert.",
        "Alison: Oh, great. So everybody else gets to scarf them down while I just watch.",
        "Susan: Oh, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Yeah?",
        "Susan: Do you remember? You have to take us to the Lakeview after the rehearsal at Lily's.",
        "Aaron: Yes, I do remember. I do. That sounds pretty good. I do, I do.",
        "Susan: All right, all right. Save one for the wedding. And speaking of the wedding, get out.",
        "Emily: Clear out of here so your beautiful bride can find something to wear. Go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Hey, where's your girlfriend?",
        "Casey: Um, Emily is with Alison, picking out a wedding dress.",
        "Dani: I am so looking forward to Ali's wedding. I can't even tell you.",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Dani: Maybe 'cause I'm excited for my cousin. Okay, all right, so it's good for me, too. Okay. I mean, if Ali's married, then that means that she's off- limits to Chris, right?",
        "Casey: Let's hope so.",
        "Dani: Why don't we make sure of that? Since Ali's out of the picture now, why don't you help me hook up with Chris?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Uh, okay, uh, hello! Bride being crushed by dresses.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Alison: Oh, oh. Hold on, Sweet. You guys take these. Just hold them for a second.",
        "Susan: Oh, oh, all right.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Emily: You need help there, Mom? Here, I'll take them.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Emily: Isn't this fun?",
        "Susan: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Chris: Hey, sorry to bother you, Ali, but I had an emergency at the hospital, and I'm worried about Morty.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Chris: Well, he's been alone since I left my early shift. He's got to be starving right now. Could you do me a favor, please, and go feed him?",
        "Alison: Well, I don't really think I can do that right now. I'm kind of getting married, remember?",
        "Chris: Yeah, believe me. I got the memo. But I'm afraid if he doesn't get fed soon, he's gonna start barking, and then Morty and I -- well, we'll be on the streets, so.",
        "Alison: Fine.",
        "Chris: Great. I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Chris: Uh, I just got a page. I got to go. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Wait, hold on. Hello? Um, bridal party, I think we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Good morning.",
        "Paul: Morning. You're here awfully early, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Well, I came to see Meg. I know from personal experience how incredibly tedious it is to be confined to bed rest.",
        "Paul: I'm sure she'll be glad to see you. I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately.",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe I can help out there. I just had a conversation with my broker who told me with a little bit of time he'll be able to get enough of my assets liquid to raise the money you need. So you tell your father to take his deal and hit the road.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry, Mom, but I can't let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Whoa.",
        "Vienna: Good morning, my Henry.",
        "Henry: Good morning.",
        "Bonnie: Aren't you a little overdressed, Vienna?",
        "Vienna: Oh, you mean this old thing? It's just something I threw on. Don't mind me. You two just keep going, doing whatever you were doing. I'll just wait over here until you're finished.",
        "Bonnie: Henry? Henry?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Bonnie: Hey, we were talking cherries.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Okay --",
        "Vienna: Cherries? I love cherries. Did you know that there's this little trick you can do with a stem? You just wind it around your tongue.",
        "Bonnie: Fascinating.",
        "Henry: Uh, you know, Bonnie, uh, we -- we've been working very hard, uh, this morning. Why don't -- why don't we take a break?",
        "Bonnie: No, no. Not until these invoices are done.",
        "Vienna: Hmm?",
        "Bonnie: Hey.",
        "Derek: Hey, there, yourself, Beautiful.",
        "Bonnie: What, do you want another Metro club sandwich?",
        "Derek: I was wondering what else was on the menu.",
        "Henry: Actually, the, uh -- the kitchen is closed until later when we're opened for customers.",
        "Bonnie: Oh.",
        "Henry: Bonnie, we got to get to those invoices.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, Henry. What about the break you were suggesting?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, why don't we just give Bonnie a long break, huh? Who Bonnie flirts with is her business unless he's mine, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I got myself into this mess, Mom. I can't let you bankrupt yourself just to try and help me out.",
        "Barbara: Do you think my bank account matters when my son is in danger? I will do everything I have to do to keep you out of your father's clutches.",
        "Paul: I know, Mom, but --",
        "Barbara: But nothing. Now, you make sure that that loan shark gives you one more week. And then he will get every dime that he's trying to bleed out of you.",
        "Paul: I can't thank you enough.",
        "Barbara: Well, I remember not so long ago we were having a chat about baby names. So, uh, Barbara if it's a girl?",
        "Paul: Um, yeah, if Meg thinks that's an okay idea.",
        "Barbara: Good point. Now I'm gonna go check on that little mother, and, uh, little Barbara.",
        "James: Oh, good morning, Paul.",
        "Paul: Morning.",
        "James: I knew you wouldn't begrudge your papa a little pate now that he's helping you out of your financial nightmare.",
        "Paul: No, enjoy it while you can, Papa. Because this gravy train is about to stop.",
        "James: You're acting very sure of yourself this morning.",
        "Paul: I have another way of paying my debts. So you can get used to prison food again. Because this game is over.",
        "James: This new source of cash, hmm? The good fairy?",
        "Paul: The only thing you need to know is that I will not be paying you with a pound of flesh.",
        "James: How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.",
        "Paul: Real guilt? You're that desperate?",
        "James: No, no, that -- that would be you. This new source, uh, would it be your well-meaning, but misguided mother, perhaps?",
        "Paul: The only thing you need to know is that I don't need your help anymore.",
        "James: No, that self-delusional streak -- you get that from Barbara. You do need me, Paul. It's a shame that children have to learn certain things all by themselves.",
        "Paul: If you're not gone when I come back downstairs, I'm calling the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: So, how is it that you look more beautiful in broad daylight than most women look by candlelight?",
        "Bonnie: Well, you see, if I told you --",
        "Derek: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bonnie: I might just have to kill you.",
        "Derek: Ooh. A taste for violence -- I like it. Nice.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Derek: Oh, I have to take this. Excuse me.",
        "Bonnie: Mm-hmm, sure.",
        "Derek: What can I do for you?",
        "Paul: We need to meet.",
        "Derek: Uh, well, since I'm part of \"We,\" and I don't have to meet, you might want to change that statement to a question.",
        "Paul: Will you meet with me?",
        "Derek: Where?",
        "Paul: Old Town, as soon as you can make it.",
        "Derek: Well, if I have to change my plans, you better make it worth my while.",
        "Paul: Count on it.",
        "Derek: And, looks like you're not the only one who has to work. Duty calls.",
        "Bonnie: Mmm, I know how that can be.",
        "Derek: Yeah, but we're still on for later, right?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Derek: Dinner, then dancing, but not here. I want you off duty and all to myself.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I think that can be arranged.",
        "Derek: Hmm.",
        "Vienna: Don't. Henry.",
        "Henry: What? What -- what -- what did I do?",
        "Bonnie: No, that smirk said 1,000 words and none of them good.",
        "Henry: Look, I wasn't gonna say anything. Your personal life is just that. I'm out of it. I'm out of it.",
        "Bonnie: Thank you. I appreciate that.",
        "Vienna: And so do I. I am so proud of you, Henry.",
        "Henry: Hmm.",
        "Vienna: Mmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: I really hope you have my money.",
        "Paul: Look, everything is under control. But I -- I need a little bit of time to kind of pull everything together.",
        "Derek: I believe I made the terms of this arrangement quite clear from the start.",
        "Paul: Yes, and you're gonna get everything that you're entitled to. I just -- I need a week.",
        "Derek: No. Now, if we're done, I was in the middle of talking to someone far more attractive than you.",
        "Paul: Hey, come on. Be reasonable.",
        "Derek: Listen, let's get this straight. I don't have to be reasonable. I don't have to be anything other than paid and in full. You have 24 hours.",
        "Paul: I can't do it. I can't get you the money in that time.",
        "Derek: Well, then you're gonna have to find another way, aren't you? And let's just hope, for the sake of your lovely wife and your soon-to-be child, that you find it fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings and Henry picks it up]",
        "Paul: Henry?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm guessing you're not calling to get my martini recipe.",
        "Paul: I need a favor.",
        "Henry: Again?",
        "Paul: I need to talk to you about the loan shark that you put me in touch with.",
        "Henry: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. Warrantless wiretapping, Paul. Warrantless wiretapping. We do not use the \"l\" word and the \"S\" word when somebody may be listening, okay? I, uh -- I will meet you at Al's, and we can talk there, all right? Moron. Uh, Ladies, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to step out for a minute.",
        "Vienna: Why?",
        "Bonnie: No, if we don't finish the invoices, I can't place any orders.",
        "Henry: I will be back before you two even notice. Would you play nice, please? Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: They're not kidding, Mom. If I don't go and take that pharmacology test, you know, I'm done. I won't pass.",
        "Susan: That is positively medieval. Doesn't Brenda know that you're getting married? Oh, look, I'm just gonna call her and ask her if you can't take a makeup exam.",
        "Alison: No, no, no. Don't. I mean -- you remember what happened last time someone tried to get Brenda Manning to cut me slack.",
        "Susan: Point taken.",
        "Emily: You know what? Go take your test, and when you finish, come right back, and Mom and I will continue to dress-shop.",
        "Alison: Uh, you know what? This is fine. I'll just get this one, okay?",
        "Susan: Hey, wait!",
        "Emily: Wait, wait.",
        "Susan: You haven't even tried it on.",
        "Alison: You know what? Buy it, I'll pay you back, and I'll just see you at the rehearsal, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Okay, me fixing you up with Chris -- not gonna happen.",
        "Dani: Give me one good reason why not.",
        "Casey: I'll give you two -- Alison and Emily.",
        "Dani: Um, ancient history.",
        "Casey: Chris has nothing but history with your family. Trust me. Take it from me. Not gonna happen -- too complicated.",
        "Dani: Yes, okay, but if Chris were with me, then he would be off-limits to other women, and let's face it. It really wasn't that long ago that he and Emily were steaming up the sheets.",
        "Casey: Okay, to quote you -- \"Ancient History.\"",
        "Dani: Okay, well, let's make sure it stays that way by taking Chris off the market. Look, all you have to do is get him someplace where I can accidentally on purpose run in to you guys, and leave the rest to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison walks in the room and puts her chocolate box on the table]",
        "Alison: Hey there, Sweetie! Did the big, bad doctor leave you all alone? Oh, come here. Hold on. We can't have that, now, can we? Where does he keep your food? Hey, what are you doing here? I thought the whole point was that you were stuck at the hospital.",
        "Chris: I thought I'd be longer, but the attending showed up and took over. I tried to reach you, but it kept going to voice mail.",
        "Alison: Oh, I was probably in the elevator or something.",
        "Chris: How was he when you first got here?",
        "Alison: He's fine. You know, just playing around with his blue toy.",
        "Chris: That squeaky blue one you gave him? He loves that one.",
        "Alison: Does he really?",
        "Chris: Yeah, he's basically chewed all the squeak out of it. We're going to need to take our boy out and get him some sturdier toys.",
        "Alison: Hey, well, uh, you know, now that you're here, I -- I probably should go. You know, I've got all this wedding stuff to do.",
        "Chris: Sure. Don't let me hold you up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What's this about a loan shark?",
        "Paul: Well, not just any loan shark. The one you helped introduce me to.",
        "Henry: Oh, great. I hope you didn't call him that to his face. They prefer \"Personal finance advisor.\"",
        "Paul: You know what? I don't care what he prefers. You need to get him off my back.",
        "Henry: I -- Paul, I can't. These guys -- they're sticklers, okay? And they set the terms. If you can't pay them back, they will collect in very painful, nonmonetary ways.",
        "Paul: Look, he's gonna get everything that I owe with interest.",
        "Henry: Oh, I don't like where this is going.",
        "Paul: But I need a week -- one little week.",
        "Henry: Yeah, let me guess. He didn't go for that.",
        "Paul: No. Henry, it's not even me I'm worried about. It's Meg. I don't want anything to happen to her.",
        "Henry: Fine, okay. I will see what I can do. What's the guy's name?",
        "Paul: Derek Coburn.",
        "Henry: Are you sure about that?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I think I'd remember the guy's name.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, of course you would. This is just getting worse and worse. If -- if -- and this is a big if. If I get him off your back, never, ever ask me for anything again.",
        "Paul: Okay. Let's hope I never have to. Thanks a lot, Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Barbara, you cannot wear yourself out like this.",
        "Barbara: James, what the hell are you still doing here?",
        "James: Look. I know Paul is your pride and joy, but you can't always rescue him. Our son has to grow up sometime.",
        "Barbara: So we're back to this, James? You think that I make Paul weak?",
        "James: No, you are a wonderful mother, Barbara. I -- I say stupid things out of anger sometime.",
        "Barbara: Bull. You will never get me to stop protecting my children.",
        "James: Listen. Your kind of protection isn't always possible. This time it isn't even necessary, and we both want the same thing, and that's to protect our son.",
        "Barbara: Do you think my cancer has made me stupid? I will never believe you, James, about anything. I just want you far, far gone, away from me and everyone I love.",
        "James: Listen. When fire destroyed your beautiful face, you lost all hope for the future. We worked together. We brought back your beauty, and we brought back your hope. We were allies then, Barbara. And we can be again.",
        "Barbara: Those days are over, James, never to be repeated.",
        "James: Never doesn't apply to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Chris, hi.",
        "Chris: Casey, I'm really glad to hear from you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I was wondering if you're free for lunch.",
        "Chris: Oh, Case, I'm sorry. No, this is not a good time.",
        "Casey: Oh, oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe we can meet some other --",
        "Dani: No.",
        "Casey: Okay, uh -- you know, can you work something out? 'Cause I really would like it to be today.",
        "Chris: This is kind of out of the blue, isn't it?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know. Like, things have recently only become less tense between us. You know, with the history between Alison and Emily.",
        "Chris: I never wanted you to feel like you had to choose sides.",
        "Casey: Good to hear, yeah. Good to hear. That's -- that's why I was hoping we could meet up and, you know, continue to clear the air.",
        "Chris: Okay, yeah. It'll have to be quick. Um, is Lakeview okay? About a half- hour?",
        "Casey: Yeah, that'll be good. Yeah, see you there. We're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Alison was right. This dress really does scream mother of the bride.",
        "Emily: Yeah, speaking of screaming -- what was up with her running out like that? I mean, it's like she just wants to get this wedding over with.",
        "Susan: Why? Just because she's not making herself hysterical over details?",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. When has finding the perfect dress ever been a detail for Ali?",
        "Susan: And we're not talking about any dress. This is her wedding gown.",
        "Emily: I don't know. Doesn't feel like something else is going on here?",
        "Susan: Maybe, maybe. But she's found a guy who's so good to her, who gives her the stability and balance she's always needed, and she's got the good sense to grab him. And I think it'll be good for her to lead a normal life.",
        "Emily: Okay, what Casey and I have may not be everybody's idea of normal, but -- it works for us, okay? At least for now.",
        "Susan: But is Casey a lifetime commitment?",
        "Emily: Point taken, Mom. Or I'm sorry. Maybe I should say mother of the bride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Aaron: Yeah, so, did you do it? Did you get the dress?",
        "Alison: Oh, oh! Yes, yes, I got it. Uh, but you will just have to wait to see it.",
        "Aaron: Well, I hope you make sure it's extra large so you'll have room for all that chocolate that's going in your tummy tonight. You're bringing it to the Lakeview, right, for desserts? Ali?",
        "Alison: Uh.",
        "Aaron: What's going on?",
        "Alison: Right, right. The chocolates. Um, I'm sorry. I just had a -- a lot on my mind.",
        "Aaron: You didn't eat all the chocolates, did you?",
        "Alison: Of course not.",
        "Aaron: Okay, uh, 'cause if you did, we can just work it out, you know, on the honeymoon.",
        "Alison: Ha ha ha. Well, we won't have a wedding, let alone a honeymoon unless you let me get back to work.",
        "Aaron: Okay, then, you know what? Go.",
        "Alison: Okay. Bye.",
        "Aaron: Bye.",

        "Henry: Henry Coleman here. Uh, is this -- right, right, right. No names, no names, no names. Uh, listen. I need you to -- to call off that personal finance advisor you sent Paul Ryan. What do you mean you didn't? Why not? No, I never -- no, I never called and told you the deal was off. Oh, okay, fine, fine. Then who is this Derek Coburn person, huh? No, the phone is not tapped. What -- what -- hello? Hello? That's great. That's great. Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great. Great, great, great, great. Hi, Vienna, Sweetie, hey. I need to talk to Bonnie. Why? Just Metro business.",
        "Vienna: Well, she's not here, but, um, maybe I can help you if you tell me what you need.",
        "Henry: Where is she, Honey?",
        "Vienna: Well, I don't know, I don't care, and neither should you. But where are you, anyway?",
        "Henry: I'm at Al's, and I will be at Metro soon. Love you, Sweetie. Just -- that's great. Bonnie, this is Henry. I need to see you. It's important.",
        "Henry: I'm pretty sure Paul doesn't want you anywhere near Fairwinds, Buddy. So what are you doing here? Only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: Are you here?",
        "James: Derek, quiet, quiet, please. There are a lot of people who'd like to see James Stenbeck back in prison.",
        "Henry: James Stenbeck? Ohh. Oh, Bonnie, you are in way over your head.",
        "James: Henry Coleman. We meet at last.",
        "Henry: I'm afraid you have the advantage, Stranger. I have no idea who you are.",
        "James: James Stenbeck.",
        "Henry: Stenbeck? Stenbeck. That doesn't ring a bell. So if you'll excuse me.",
        "Derek: I don't think so.",
        "James: Henry, I've heard of you. You must have heard of me.",
        "Henry: Yeah, maybe a word here or there, but nothing significant. You know, I got to get going -- people to go, places to see. Ugh.",
        "James: You know, I just can't let you run off like that, especially when I have a favor to ask of you.",

        "Casey: Yes, yes. I was in the neighborhood, so I decided to give you a call.",
        "Chris: Yeah, lucky you caught me today. I'm not usually home at this hour. I'm in kind of a rush, but -- hey, can we get some menus, please?",
        "Waiter: Certainly.",
        "Chris: Thank you.",

        "Chris: You know what? I want to start with the house salad, please. Case, you want to join me?",
        "Casey: Uh, sure, yeah.",
        "Dani: No way. It must be my lucky day -- two handsome men at the same table. You know, small world. I was just walking by fashions a few minutes ago. I think I saw Emily.",
        "Chris: Casey and I actually have some stuff to talk about, Dani.",
        "Casey: Oh, I have to take a rain check on lunch.",
        "Chris: What? You called me.",
        "Casey: I know, I know. Dani just mentioned Emily. I just remembered I got to meet her and bring some stuff over to Lily's for the wedding. Um, Dani, why don't you, uh, stay?",
        "Dani: Oh, take your place? Sure.",
        "Casey: Yeah, uh, see you later. You know, Chris, I'll call you, right?",
        "Chris: Right, right. Yeah.",
        "Dani: Hmm. Oh, I just can't make up my mind. Everything here looks so good.",
        "Chris: Everything except this little setup? Don't bat those eyes at me. This is an ambush.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Case? What? I didn't think you were coming here. Hi.",
        "Casey: Hi. I thought you might need an extra hand, you know. Mainly, I want to ask you a question.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Casey: Did you get the mail today?",
        "Emily: Yeah. I can see that you did, too.",
        "Casey: It's so weird. You know, one day you're married, and then the envelope comes in the mail with some judge's name on it, and, boom, done.",
        "Emily: We knew it was coming, Case.",
        "Casey: You know what I think? I think annulment is a stupid word -- to say something never happened? When it definitely did? I promised I would love you for the rest of my life.",
        "Emily: And you still can, Babe. If you want to, you can.",
        "Casey: You know I do.",
        "Emily: Well -- come on. I thought we decided we weren't gonna get hung up on this marriage thing. Listen to me. I don't want to be sad today, okay? Nothing that matters has changed.",
        "Casey: You're right, you're right, you're right. Okay. I guess you can put me to work now.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Emily: All right. Um, can you take some of these flowers and put them on the arbor -- anywhere you think, you know, might be pretty?",
        "Casey: No problem, no problem, Honey. Okay.",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Casey: Just putting it somewhere really pretty -- just like your directions.",
        "Emily: Why do you have to be so sweet, huh?",
        "Casey: Why do you have to be so beautiful? Do you think -- I just can't help but wonder. If we had a wedding like this, would it have been any different? We can still do it one day, you know -- have a real wedding. Tell the world we want to be together forever.",
        "Emily: Nothing is forever, Case. Least of all marriage. Believe me. I've been through enough marriages to last a lifetime. Never again.",

        "Dani: Is it so terrible that I want to get to know you better?",
        "Chris: I don't want you to get the wrong idea, you know. I'm happy being friends, but it's not going any further than that. I don't want to lead you on, okay? No, I'm afraid we're gonna have to cancel.",
        "Dani: No. Chris, don't. Okay, I promise I will not read anything more into this than lunch. And, besides, you need to eat.",
        "Chris: True enough. Sorry, go ahead with the salad. But you have to promise you won't do this again.",
        "Dani: Could you pass the salt?",

        "Chris: Dr. Hughes.",
        "Alison: Hey, Chris, it's me. Is it true that chocolate is toxic for dogs?",
        "Chris: Yes, why?",
        "Alison: Because I left a box of chocolates in the room, and before I could get back here, Morty ate them all.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. Don't panic. I'll be right there. Sorry, Dani. I have to go. I have to handle a hospital emergency.",
        "Dani: Yeah, of course. These things happen.",
        "Chris: Right. Uh, put this on my room bill, please -- uh, Hughes, 707.",

        "Chris: We're gonna have to pump his stomach.",
        "Alison: What is that?",
        "Chris: Peroxide. I got it from the housekeeping department. I only need you to hold him while I pour it down his throat.",
        "Alison: Okay, I can do it.",
        "Chris: This isn't gonna be too much fun for you, Buddy, but we need to do it to make you better.",

        "Casey: Never, Emily? You can't say that.",
        "Emily: Casey, I've lived long enough to know that it is better to live happily right now then waiting and hoping for a happily ever after.",
        "Casey: So me just wanting something more just makes me a hopeless, stupid romantic?",
        "Emily: Oh, God, no. It makes you adorable. But when you're older, you're gonna find out that I'm right.",
        "Casey: Can you stop making age an issue? 'Cause it's not -- at least not to me.",
        "Emily: Well, at least not now. But trust me. That will change.",
        "Casey: Mmm.",
        "Emily: Can we please just be happy with what we have right now?",
        "Casey: No. Because right now -- I'm not very happy.",

        "Paul: Henry. Did you manage to get your guy to call Derek off?",
        "Henry: Uh, no such luck. And it's worse than you thought. This guy, uh, Derek -- he's -- he's one of the toughest in the business. I'm hearing some ugly stories.",
        "Paul: He wouldn't hurt Meg, right? I mean, she's innocent. She's got nothing to do with any of this.",
        "Henry: I wouldn't rule anything out. I'm sorry, Paul. I wish there were something I could do.",
        "Paul: 24 hours. I got 24 hours.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I can't raise that kind of money in 24 hours! There's got to be somebody else you can ask.",
        "Paul: I've asked everyone I can think of, Mom. I don't know what to do. If I don't give this animal what he wants, there's no telling what he's gonna do. I can't risk him hurting Meg or the baby.",
        "Barbara: No, no, you can't.",
        "Paul: I don't know what to do. I -- for the sake of my family, I got to do whatever James tells me.",

        "Henry: You're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Derek: I don't think so.",
        "Henry: You know, your conversational skills have seriously deteriorated down here in the basement, Derek. Why don't we talk about it at Metro over a martini, huh? What is the problem? I did what you wanted.",
        "James: Yes, and you did it -- you did it very, very well. But, you see, it's not necessarily common knowledge that I'm no longer incarcerated.",
        "Henry: You did time? Really? I never would have guessed.",
        "James: I need to keep my, uh, whereabouts confidential.",
        "Henry: Hey, well, I won't tell a soul. I swear. Cross my heart and hope to --",
        "James: I believe you, Henry. I believe you 'cause you're not going to be able to tell anyone anything.",
        "Henry: What do you mean?",
        "James: Well, I mean, you've spent some time in this lovely wine cellar, hmm, before? So welcome back. Make yourself comfortable. You're gonna be here a while.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't do that. You can't do that.",

        "Alison: Well, we do make a pretty good team together when it, you know, comes to working.",
        "Chris: Not just working.",
        "Alison: I should probably go.",
        "Chris: Probably should. Wait, I, uh, think this was meant for you.",

        "Casey: Yeah, Emily has everything exactly the way she wants it.",
        "Susan: Is everything okay?",
        "Emily: Everything's fine. Lily gave us the run of the house, so Casey and I managed to get almost everything done.",

        "Emily: Casey helped with that. He's gonna help with the music, too. Isn't that great? Yeah, so now all we have to do is wait for the rest of the wedding party, and we're ready to go. Make that the rest of the wedding party and assorted guests.",
        "Dani: I hope you don't mind me crashing the rehearsal.",
        "Susan: Of course not. You're family.",
        "Casey: How was lunch?",
        "Dani: Oh, he gave me some speech about not wanting to lead me on, and then raced off to a hospital emergency.",
        "Casey: Sorry. I told you that was gonna be a bad idea.",
        "Dani: It was a perfectly good idea. It just didn't work.",

        "Alison: Yeah, I just -- I can't believe I almost killed little Morty with my stupid mistake.",

        "Alison: I know. But he's so little.",
        "Chris: He threw up all the chocolate, so I'm sure the vet will give him a clean bill of health. What is it, Ali? Are you really that concerned about Morty?",
        "Alison: It's not about the dog.",

        "James: Uh, everything -- everything is under control. You know, I just can't leave you all alone in there like this. It's -- it's much too cruel. So I suggest the Meerlust -- best wine in South Africa.",

        "Barbara: Honey, there's got to be some other way.",
        "Paul: There's no other way. Mom, look. I know that James won't hurt Meg or the baby, but this other guy -- I have no idea what he's capable of.",
        "Barbara: So you're choosing the devil you know.",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Barbara: But you don't even know if there's anything buried out there in the Snyder field!",
        "Paul: I don't care. I'll figure it out. If I have to get a backhoe and dig up every field in this county, I'll figure it out.",
