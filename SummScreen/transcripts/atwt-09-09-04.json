        "Lucy: I can't stand to hear you talk about giving this place up just to keep me out of the line of fire.",
        "Dusty: It's more than that.",
        "Lucy: We cannot let my father drive us away. He's already done enough with paying people to kidnap me. I could have pressed charges, but I didn't.",
        "Dusty: Your father owns a third of this club. It's going to be real tough to keep him out of here.",
        "Lucy: But that's just it -- you don't have to. For the first time in my life, I finally made it clear to him that there's nothing he can do or say that's going to change my mind about him, or about you.",
        "Dusty: Well, he's gonna keep trying, believe me --",
        "Lucy: Well, if he pushes too far, I will go to the police.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to fight, especially about your dad.",
        "Lucy: But you love this place.",
        "Dusty: Let me do what I gotta do, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sorry, I'm late, Dusty -- sorry. Lucy?",
        "Rosanna: I got it, Emma. It's probably the boy with the milk. Oh. Jordan. What are you doing here?",
        "Emma: I invited him. He's called twice a day since word got out that you were here. He just wanted to know if you were okay.",
        "Rosanna: Emma --",
        "Emma: Come on in. Come on in. Make yourself at home.",
        "Jordan: I won't stay long. I just wanted to see you for a moment.",
        "Rosanna: How are you?",
        "Jordan: Functioning. Sort of. You?",
        "Rosanna: You know --",
        "Jordan: No, I don't.",
        "Rosanna: I'm getting a lot of sleep and ruining Emma's vegetable garden and my hands.",
        "Jordan: I miss him, Rosanna. Even more now that he's --",
        "Rosanna: How's Jennifer? Did you guys straighten everything out?",
        "Jordan: No. She's broken it off. She doesn't want me in her life anymore.",

        "Jennifer: Paul! Oh, I'm so glad you're home!",
        "Paul: Are you okay?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. But I'm better, now that you're here. So, come in, come in. Yeah, it's been piling up since Mom went off the deep end. Oh, Paul, who's mother does the things that our Mother does? Who drives a car into the state mental hospital?",
        "Paul: Better she's breaking in than out. Have you heard from Rosanna?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Paul: 'Cause she's not returning any of my phone calls.",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry, Paul. She shouldn't be blaming you for Cabot's death.",
        "Paul: I think she does.",
        "Jennifer: Any word on Stenbeck?",
        "Paul: Did you know that he called Mother when Mother was in jail?",
        "Jennifer: She was still in touch with him? Even after Cabot died?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I hired somebody to penetrate the Oakdale PD phone records. Mother receive a",
        "Jennifer: Paul, Mom's under court-ordered observation. She can't have any visitors.",
        "Paul: I'll figure out a way in.",
        "Jennifer: Even if you do manage to get in to see her, she's just going to lie to you.",
        "Paul: I have other options. I got somebody watching James Stenbeck's bank accounts -- I mean, the ones that I know about. I even tapped Mom's phone lines. I even hired somebody to watch Jordan. What? What do you -- what is that?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I know that you want to catch James and -- and fix things. But some things are not meant to be fixed. Cabot is gone. Nothing will ever be the same. And I meant what I said. It's not your fault that he died.",
        "Paul: I didn't think that James was actually going to hurt Cabot. I thought he was just playing with my head. I thought he was just pitting me against Jordan.",
        "Jennifer: He was pitting you against Jordan. In more ways than you know.",
        "Paul: What really kills me is that Rosanna is suffering.",
        "Jennifer: I wouldn't worry too much about Rosanna. She found a way to cope.",
        "Rosanna: You explained to Jennifer what happened? You told her it wasn't premeditated? That we were grieving?",
        "Jordan: I told her. I told her. But the way she sees it, I turned to you instead of her.",
        "Rosanna: But that's not true.",
        "Jordan: It is true, Rosanna. We did turn to each other.",
        "Rosanna: Do you want me to talk to her?",
        "Jordan: No, no. I think that would only make things worse.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what do you think we should do?",
        "Jordan: That's it there nothing we could. She won't -- she won't see me.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what are you going to do?",
        "Jordan: I didn't come here to talk about all that. I just -- I just wanted to see you and make sure that you were all right. I'm going to go. I'll still be at the Lakeview if you need anything, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, I'm glad you came. Thank you for coming.",
        "Jordan: Cabot was very lucky to have had you.",
        "Rosanna: And you.",
        "Emma: You okay?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. You were right, as usual. He's a good man. Most other men would just walk away.",
        "Emma: Well now, don't you lose heart, here. There's a lot of good people in this world still.",
        "Rosanna: Mm-hmm, and I'm looking at one of them. Oh, I'm so sorry if I've been self-centered lately --",
        "Emma: Oh, nonsense, nonsense. Sweetheart, you just lost a child. You needed a little time to rest, that's all.",
        "Rosanna: You know, Jordan misses him as much as I do. And it seems like his girlfriend, Jennifer, just broke up with him.",
        "Emma: It's been my experience that the best way to heal a broken heart is to think about someone else, to help someone else. If there's something you can do for Jordan, maybe now's the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Look, I know you that would never hurt me or JJ, intentionally. You're not mean. You're not like him, I know.",
        "Jack: You're talking about your ex-husband?",
        "Julia: He wasn't like that when I met him, you know? It wasn't until after JJ was born, he -- I think just the pressure of having a new baby started getting to him, you know? And I wasn't working as much because of the baby, and he got bumped off a couple of jobs -- everybody's broke after their first baby, right? He didn't want to come home anymore, so he started hanging out at the bar. Drinking, and, you know, he'd come home very quiet, you know? Too quiet. I'd ask him what was wrong and he'd just lose it. Or he'd see JJ's toys laying in the yard and he'd go after him.",
        "Jack: Hit him, you mean. You, too?",
        "Julia: He always apologized and he always said he loved JJ. He just had a really short temper, you know -- he didn't have a lot of patience. He wanted JJ to be perfect, but what kid's perfect? What kid can live up to that, you know? So, eventually, one of my neighbors called child welfare services, which I was glad that they did. But I either had to divorce him or lose JJ. And I wasn't going to lose JJ. Our marriage was pretty much over at that point anyway. So I divorced him and I got a restraining order, but he ignored it. So I left. I left El Paso and I came here.",
        "Jack: And now he's followed you here.",
        "Julia: Which is fine. You know what? He did me a favor, because this time, he's going to jail. Anyway -- so, that's my story. I guess it's not hard to see why I didn't really want to share it.",
        "Jack: Or why you felt like you couldn't trust me. Julia? Hey, listen. I don't remember a lot of things about myself, but I know this -- I don't hit women and I sure as hell don't hit children. You have nothing to worry about, because I will always be a part of your life. I'll never walk out of your life, you can count on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know that it might have looked like that, but there's no way that Jack could have another family. He already has a family.",
        "Martha: Honey, I know lots of guys that have families and still chase other women.",
        "Carly: Jack's not like that.",
        "Martha: Are you sure? I thought he was hitting on me at first.",
        "Carly: What did he say?",
        "Martha: Well, it was more of a question. Did I know him?",
        "Carly: He asked you if you knew him?",
        "Martha: Maybe it wasn't a line. He seemed kind of confused.",
        "Carly: And then this woman came along?",
        "Martha: With the boy, like I said.",
        "Carly: What did she look like?",
        "Martha: Um, same age as you. Dark hair.",
        "Carly: Anything more specific? A wedding ring, a class ring from a nearby school? Or a scar, a tattoo, anything?",
        "Martha: She had a big, bright floral bag.",
        "Carly: A big, bright floral bag?",
        "Martha: Like a beach bag, only -- nicer than that? It was red with flowers all over it.",
        "Carly: I'm wondering if you could watch my little boy for me, just so I can change my baby's diaper, if that's okay?",
        "Julia: Great, I wouldn't mind at all. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Really? Good, thanks. You're a life saver.",
        "Martha: And then the man, this Jack person, he took the bag, slung it over his shoulder and off they went. I really have to get back to work.",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course. Thank you so much.",
        "Martha: Good luck to you.",
        "Carly: Thanks. She saw him. She talked to him.",
        "Dennis: She's positive?",
        "Carly: She recognized him from the picture. And you're not going to believe this. She described this woman he was with -- I met her. She has a little boy Parker's age. He was saying they were going to meet somebody -- a friend -- obviously, he was referring to Jack!",
        "Dennis: All right, how did you happen to meet this woman?",
        "Carly: She watched Parker for me for a couple minutes while I took Sage to change her diaper. When I got back, Parker was very upset. He was insisting that her son had taken something from him. He meant Jack! The boy had taken Jack.",
        "Dennis: Mrs. Snyder --",
        "Carly: They were arguing about a toy, but that's not why Parker was upset. He knew that this child was spending time with Jack.",
        "Dennis: Look, I think you're jumping to conclusions.",
        "Carly: You haven't been living with my child the past couple of months. He has Jack radar like you would not believe. If we find this woman and her son, we find Jack.",
        "Dennis: Did she tell you her name? Where she works? Where they live?",
        "Carly: I know she said that she lives nearby, nearby the park.",
        "Dennis: Well, that's it?",
        "Carly: Well, I wasn't thinking about tracking her down when I met her.",
        "Dennis: That's not much to go on. I mean, unless Martha knows more --",
        "Carly: No. She said she just saw her from a distance. She had a big, red floral beach bag. And I know her son had a little backpack that he carried his toys -- JJ. Her son's name was JJ.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Jack, I could jump on this. You're smart, you're kind, you're handsome. My kid loves you. You love my kid.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I love your kid. What's the problem?",
        "Julia: Okay. Let's say that I did this -- I jump on it. We go with it. What if we make love and then we start a life together? What happens when there's a knock on the door? And it's your wife, or it's your friend, or it's your brother, or it's your business partner -- whoever it is is standing there with open arms. And it's the best thing that could possibly happen, right? Because I can only imagine how broken up your family is and how much they miss you. But what about us? What happens to us? What happens to me and JJ? Because you'd have to go back. So, where does that leave us?",
        "Jack: We'll work on it.",
        "Julia: How do we work on it, though? If you have a wife and you have kids, they're not going to want to share you, Jack. And they shouldn't have to, you know?",
        "Jack: Julia, there's only one problem wrong with your theory, okay? If I have people out there -- family, friends -- where are they? It's been weeks. And I know we've had this conversation before, but if it was you who went missing? Your picture would be on every paper and your face would be all over the TV and your name would be on every missing persons list from here to Springfield. And I wouldn't stop, I wouldn't rest, until I found you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I wouldn't worry too much about it. The doctors here are pretty cool. It's all about the reasons for stuff, you know? If you can convince them that you are sane but you had a good reason for what you did, you walk.",
        "Barbara: I hope this doctor has a son as wonderful as you.",
        "Will: I'll put in a word with my shrink. But I got to get going, I'm seeing the doctor after lunch.",
        "Barbara: Oh, good. We'll all be sane by dinnertime. I'm looking forward to that.",
        "Will: We're having chicken cutlets tonight.",
        "Barbara: Goody.",
        "Will: Try and eat something, Mom. You'll feel better.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I should be taking care of you.",
        "Will: No, Mom. It's like I said. Now it's my turn. Do you remember what you told me?",
        "Barbara: I have told you a hundred million things.",
        "Will: Yeah, but it all boils down to one. All I ever need to know is that you love me.",
        "Barbara: That's right. And we stick together.",
        "Will: Yeah, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jennifer, if you've got something to tell me about Rosanna, tell me, please?",
        "Jennifer: She left town. That's what I heard.",
        "Paul: Well, she still keeps a suite at the Lakeview, because all of my phone messages have been piling up --",
        "Jennifer: I assume that she's coming back. But maybe not. And maybe that would be for the best.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, it's just that we have all been through so much.",
        "Paul: How are you and Jordan?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jennifer: Could you get that? I need to make a phone call -- finish up an order.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: I'm just never going to be able to forgive you. I wonder if Paul will ever forgive you for what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We're running out of time. If we don't find Jack soon, we could lose him forever.",

        "Rosanna: I didn't realize that you were back.",
        "Paul: And I thought you were out of town.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. I came here to see Jennifer. Would you tell her that I stopped by?",
        "Paul: No, come on in -- please, come on in.",
        "Rosanna: No, thank you.",
        "Paul: Jen's just in the other room. She's on the phone.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, I can't stay, so --",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you can't avoid me forever.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I can. I can try.",
        "Paul: I think we did the best that we could.",
        "Rosanna: No, we didn't. We were selfish and arrogant. We did what we wanted to do, and the hell with James, and look what it cost us. Cabot is dead and any chance that we had is lost. And I can't stand here and talk to you about it or debate it, okay? I don't have the strength to do this.",
        "Paul: Don't. Please don't -- please -- Rosanna, don't do this. If you do this, then James wins.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Jack, this is a small town. I haven't read anything but the local paper in months. I don't have time. And television? I don't watch news because it's too depressing. I mean, for all I know, your face could be plastered all over --",
        "Jack: Someone would've seen, Julia. Police put out bulletins on missing persons. Welfare agencies? They're constantly on the lookout. Someone would've recognized me.",
        "Julia: Jack, when you were brought in, you were really badly injured. You were half-drowned. It's possible that the people with you think that you're dead, or that, you know, that they died in the accident. I don't know. Listen, I'm just guessing. It's a huge world, though. You could've lost your way thousands of miles from here, Jack. The only thing I know for sure? I know that someday, somebody's going to knock on that door and you're going to get your life back. I promise.",
        "Jack: How can you be so sure, Julia?",
        "Julia: Because anyone who knows you could never forget you.",

        "Dennis: According to the tax rolls, there's a single woman living about a mile down river who has a minor child named John Joseph.",
        "Carly: JJ.",
        "Dennis: Yeah, but there's no age listed.",
        "Carly: What's the address?",
        "Dennis: Now, Mrs. Snyder, I know how important this is to you, but please, let me check it out first.",
        "Carly: My son said we're running out of time. If we don't find Jack soon, we could lose him forever. Now you give me that address!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You're just figuring that out?",
        "Lucy: No, it's much worse. I can't even really go into it. He's not exactly a part of my life anymore. At least, I want nothing to do with him, but he can't take no for an answer, so -- anyway, he owns part of the club, so we can't keep him out. I think Dusty might -- he might give up this place. Do business somewhere else.",
        "Aaron: Well, I know where he is. And with your dad on his back, if he can get out from under this, I say do it. Of course, if that's not the problem --",
        "Lucy: No. You know my father when he gets obsessed. He's impossible.",
        "Aaron: So Dusty's plan makes a lot of sense.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I guess it does.",
        "Aaron: What's the problem then, Luce?",
        "Lucy: Maybe there is no problem. Maybe Dusty's plan is totally legitimate. Maybe not.",
        "Aaron: So, you're afraid Dusty's going to get back involved in business with those guys he used to know?",
        "Lucy: I don't even know who those guys are, I just heard the gossip. That these guys in Chicago are a bit less than legal, and that this bar was his -- club was his chance to go straight. I don't know, you work here. Is that right?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. What I will tell you is that when Dusty Donovan makes up his mind on something? There's no changing it.",

        "Dusty: Is that your boy Rafael?",
        "Dominic: Him? Nah, they just spar. Fidel would never get in the ring with Rafael.",
        "Dusty: You find somebody yet?",
        "Dominic: Not yet. Why?",
        "Dusty: I'm thinking about branching out. Getting into something new, you know?",
        "Dominic: Sure, now that you've bagged your partner's daughter, right?",
        "Dusty: You interested? Or do I take my business somewhere else.",
        "Dominic: Why, you got a boxer in mind?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, nobody you know.",
        "Dominic: Even better.",
        "Dusty: You guarantee my money off the top, I'll set up the match, I find you a fighter, I'll put your boy on the map.",
        "Dominic: And you'll leave me out of it?",
        "Dusty: You and me never even had this conversation.",
        "Dominic: Sounds good.",
        "Dusty: He's not bad.",
        "Dominic: Rafael would eat him for lunch. That's why this kid you have in mind better have thick skin.",

        "Rosanna: James already won. We lost everything.",
        "Paul: That's not true.",
        "Rosanna: It's over.",
        "Paul: No, it is if you quit. It is if you give up.",
        "Rosanna: This was all a test. Don't you see that? If you had opened the right door, if you'd have saved Cabot, then maybe we would all be together now? Maybe saving me is what triggered the explosion?",
        "Paul: Who knows? I don't know. We're never gonna know that. But for you to blame me for some insane situation that my father set up --",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, but we knew that it was insane. You knew more than anyone. And still you chose to antagonize him so you could win.",
        "Paul: You of all people, you've never capitulated anybody, you never placate anyone, you fight! That's what you do, that's what I do when you're up against something that's wrong! And James taking everybody hostage, that was wrong!",
        "Rosanna: It all sounds very pretty now. And, yes, I wanted to believe that at the time. But, ultimately, Cabot was sacrificed. Because you couldn't accept the fact that sometimes, you can't win. Not when the person is stronger or more ruthless, or willing to kill a baby to prove a point.",
        "Paul: We've been over this. We've been over this, Rosanna, and over it. And I don't think that there's anything that we could have done any different.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, we could have believed him. You could have backed off.",
        "Paul: That would have meant losing you, and I wasn't willing to do that.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, right, you wanted me. And, at the time, I wasn't strong enough to resist you and you knew that. And for that -- I'm just never going to be able to forgive you.",

        "Jennifer: I wonder if Paul will ever forgive you for what you've done.",

        "Barbara: My stay? As in sit, stay, roll over?",
        "Dr. Kittredge: So it's fair to say you resent being here?",
        "Barbara: I behaved badly because my son is locked up in this place. He never should have been here at all. And you have him locked up in a cell.",
        "Dr. Kittredge: He never should have been here?",
        "Barbara: My son is the most loving, gentle, loyal child you could ever meet.",
        "Dr. Kittredge: Loyal to you, you mean.",
        "Barbara: Yes, to me. I'm his mother. Do you have any idea what it's like to open your heart to your children and have them turn away from you? Will is my only ally, my truest love.",
        "Dr. Kittredge: Who betrayed you, Barbara? Who made it so hard for you to trust?",
        "Barbara: Someday, doctor, when you've lived long enough to understand more than what you've read in your books, you will envy me. Because I know how the world works. I am very lucky. And I don't need your therapy. I have Will. And that's all that matters.",

        "Will: So, what happened to Mom after they took her away?",
        "Dr. Walters: She was treated for stress at Oakdale Memorial. Then the court ordered her brought here for observation, but you won't see her. She's in a separate wing, on a secure floor.",

        "Jack: Are you sure -- are you sure you're okay with this? You're not scared to get close to me?",
        "Julia: Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Kittredge: So you understand that while you're here, you won't be allowed to see Will?",
        "Barbara: Do you understand what it's been like for me all these months? Not being able to talk to him or tell him how I'm feeling? So just knowing that we're breathing the same air, walking the same hallways -- it's a miracle.",
        "Dr. Kittredge: So you're glad you're here?",
        "Barbara: I would check into hell for my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I mean, do you have any idea what it's like to live with someone like my Mom? It's all about her, all day, every day. What she needs, why she didn't get it, who she hates, how to get even. It's exhausting.",
        "Dr. Walters: So you're glad you're here?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: She's got this idea that we're fated. That it's supposed to be me and Mom against the big, bad world. Only guess who gets caught? I'm not saying she doesn't suffer, but I do the time. I pay the price.",
        "Dr. Walters: So Barbara's responsible for you being here?",
        "Will: I put the poison in Rose D'Angelo's mouthwash. I'm the reason she died. But why did I do it? I had nothing against Rose, she was nice to me. But Mom -- Mom's got her own agenda. She wanted Rose gone and Paul back in the family. That's her thing. Rounding up her kids, bringing us all closer together so she can protect us. Because she loves us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Have you ever loved anyone, doctor? Really loved them? They become your world. It's where you live, it's what you think about, what you cherish and tend to and sacrifice for. I have sacrificed everything for my children. My health, my ambition, my future. I would give my life for Will. And he knows it.",

        "Will: Mom is Mom. She's always going to need me.",
        "Dr. Walters: Barbara is a grown woman. She's responsible for her own well being.",
        "Will: Tell her that.",
        "Dr. Walters: I'm not minimizing how difficult this is, Will. Becoming aware of your mother's hold on you, recognizing the fact that you need to separate from her, beginning to make your own choices -- it's very difficult. But I want you to keep reminding yourself that it's not unkind or disloyal to grow up.",
        "Will: You know, one good thing about life with Mom? It's trained me to do whatever's necessary. She won't be a problem.",
