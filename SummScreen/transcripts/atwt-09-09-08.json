        "Brad: All right. What's going on? Okay, why do I need a lawyer if Leo doesn't remember anything?",
        "Jack: They lifted footprints going from the water up to the parking lot.",
        "Brad: Those could be anybody's. They could be the paramedics'.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, those guys are gonna be easy to rule because they wear regulation boots.",
        "Brad: So, I mean, this means nothing. I'm not gonna freak out about this.",

        "Brad: Okay. All right. I'm gonna freak out.",
        "Katie: Now, wait, hold on. Even if the prints they found are Brad's, that doesn't necessarily mean they can prove he was the one who pushed Leo in the water.",
        "Jack: But he did, Katie. What are you two missing here? This evidence puts Brad at the scene of the crime. Nobody else.",

        "Janet: Jack.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Janet: Yes! I know. Oh, you should have seen the look on his face when he came into Al's to apologize to me.",
        "Liberty: He was that good, huh?",
        "Janet: He took my hand in his hand, and he looked me in the eyes, and he said, \"Come back to me.\"",
        "Liberty: Oh!",
        "Janet: Oh! It was like something out of a romantic movie. It was amazing. And you know what killed me? Is that when he apologized, he actually meant it.",
        "Liberty: Mom, you're surprised by that?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I guess I am, you know? I -- well, I've never been in a relationship that's lasted long enough or -- or meant enough to make it to the other side of a fight. I feel -- I feel so --",
        "Liberty: Mature?",
        "Janet: Exactly. Yes. God, I hope I don't screw it up.",
        "Liberty: You won't, Mom. You won't.",

        "Liberty: I won't let you. I have never seen you like this, so stable and everything. It's really nice.",
        "Janet: Nice? It's spectacular! Hey, I know what you and Parker went through with Leo was hell, and I would never wish that on anybody, but it kind of -- it brought Jack and I closer, you know, in a way that I never saw coming. And I have a feeling it's gonna do the same thing for Jack and your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Let me paint a picture for you here, Brad. Your daughter was drugged and assaulted at a school picnic. And you know who did because the kid used to work for you. You're angry, you want justice, so you ask a pal at this station for the kid's information. And then this kid -- the one who assaulted your daughter, the one you're looking for, the one you're madder than hell at, he goes missing. And where does he miss up? He ends up half -- half-drowned and unconscious at the reservoir, the same reservoir where someone used a pay phone to dial 911 to report a possible drowning. You see where I'm going with this? Do you?",
        "Brad: Yes.",
        "Jack: Good. Because it's the same pay phone that the police lifted your fingerprints from. You see how the dots connect?",
        "Brad: Yeah, okay. What I don't see is a crime.",
        "Jack: No, you threw the kid in the water, Brad.",
        "Brad: It was an accident, Jack.",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter.",
        "Brad: It matters to me, because I pulled him out of the water, I gave him CPR, I called 911. He attacked my daughter. I save his life.",
        "Jack: The kid would not have needed CPR if you had just left the kid alone and let the police do their job. What you did was premeditated.",
        "Brad: That's just cop talk.",
        "Jack: No, it isn't. It's what the jury is gonna say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Look, I know you're upset about what you walked in on here yesterday.",
        "Holden: I didn't say a word about that.",
        "Lily: We promised we wouldn't do this today.",
        "Holden: You're right. I'll stop making cracks about Mike.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Holden: If you stop finding ways to remind me that I don't live here anymore. Deal?",
        "Emily: Oh, there are my fellow bridesmaids. Hey, you two. You want to help me make Alison's ribbon bouquet?",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "Dani: Still no word from Alison?",
        "Susan: No. And -- I -- it's not as if I'm worried, but it's her rehearsal, and -- and she's not answering her phone.",
        "Dani: And you're worried. You're worried. I understand. Do you want me to go to the hospital, see if I can track her down?",
        "Susan: Oh, Dani, would you? Oh, you're a lifesaver. Thank you so much.",
        "Dani: Yeah. Okay.",

        "Aaron: Text message from Ali.",
        "Casey: Uh-oh. Is she bailing on you?",
        "Susan: Don't make jokes like that. It's bad luck.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no. No worries, no worries, no worries. My bride is on the way.",

        "Chris: Ali, wait.",
        "Alison: Chris, I really have to go.",
        "Chris: Please, just -- just give me a minute. I may not get another chance to say this, and I want to get it right.",
        "Alison: Get what right?",
        "Chris: My apology. I --I had no right to say those things to you, and I promise it's -- it's not gonna happen again.",
        "Alison: Right. Well, I've heard that before, so --",
        "Chris: I mean it, Ali, all right? I'm not gonna push you to say things you don't mean, feel things you don't feel.",
        "Alison: Chris --",
        "Chris: I had no right to question your decision to marry Aaron, and -- and I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Then why did you? Why is it so important to you to know how I feel about Aaron?",
        "Chris: Because. I'm in love with you, Ali.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Are we talking jail time if it goes to trial?",
        "Jack: If they can prove premeditation, with the injuries Leo sustained, they could make the leap to attempted murder.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Assistant: We're going to have to redo the promo.",
        "Brad: I can't. You know, I can't. I really -- I really don't feel well. It's my stomach. I don't feel go at all. My brother's gonna take me to the hospital.",
        "Assistant: What about the promo?",
        "Brad: Well, Katie can do it. She'll be out in a minute. I promise. I'm sorry. Okay, so, how are we gonna fix this, Jack.",
        "Katie: Now, wait. Hold on. Whatever you're thinking of doing, we should about this.",
        "Brad: No, I don't want you involved any more than you already are.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Brad's right. With what you know, you're already an accessory.",
        "Brad: Please. Please do this for me.",
        "Katie: No, Brad, listen --",
        "Brad: Katie --",
        "Katie: All right.",
        "Brad: Okay, so what are we gonna do about this?",
        "Jack: We're not going to do anything about it, Brad.",
        "Brad: You're telling me they could charge me with attempted murder, and you're saying that you're just not gonna do anything about that?",
        "Jack: No, no! The evidence is what it is, Buddy. My hands are tied.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but you're my brother, Man. Untie them.",
        "Jack: I can't do that. Okay, listen. I will stand by you. I will defend your version of the story. But you have to turn yourself in first.",
        "Brad: I can't believe you're doing this to me.",
        "Jack: No, you did this to yourself! And you know that.",

        "Emily: I can't believe you're acting like this.",
        "Casey: Well, believe it.",
        "Emily: Is this really all because I said I didn't see myself getting married again?",
        "Casey: Why is it always about you, huh? What you want? What about what I want for us, how I feel? Does that even matter?",
        "Emily: Yes, of course it matters. It's just that -- y-y-you are so --",
        "Casey: Oh, don't use that lame excuse again.",
        "Emily: You didn't know what I was gonna say.",
        "Susan: Okay, we've made an executive decision to start the rehearsal.",
        "Emily: Without Alison? Do you really think that's a good idea?",
        "Aaron: It's fine. Yeah, I mean, we're only doing this for Natalie and Faith, anyway. Ali's not gonna mind. How hard is it gonna be walking down the aisle?",
        "Casey: Dude, you have no idea.",
        "Susan: Emily, you stand in for your sister. Holden, you be the minister. And let's just do it here on the terrace, since we're all here.",
        "Susan: Emily, ready to get married again?",

        "Nurse: She left early. She's getting married tomorrow.",
        "Dani: Mm-hmm. Um, sorry, just one more question. Is Dr. Chris Hughes here?",
        "Nurse: He was. He left a little earlier.",
        "Dani: Are you sure?",
        "Nurse: Yes, he asked a doctor to cover his shift. Said he had something important to take care of.",

        "Alison: You don't know what you're saying.",
        "Chris: Yes, I do, Hun. I'm in love with you, Alison.",
        "Alison: No. You only want me now because you can't have me. And you never even really wanted me! I was just a rebound after Emily!",
        "Chris: You were never a rebound. Not to me. You mean so much more than that.",
        "Alison: Yes. Yeah. I am Aaron's fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Chris: Because I'm an idiot. I let you go all those years ago, and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I was young. I was stupid. I didn't get it. Then later, when it looked like we had another chance, I went for it. Only this time, I did it all wrong. I just wanted you back. I didn't -- I didn't get what that meant. I -- I didn't understand that I needed to earn the right to be with you.",
        "Alison: Why are you telling me this now?",
        "Chris: Because I finally realized how much I hurt you, and why you turned to Aaron.",
        "Alison: I didn't turn to Aaron.",
        "Chris: Chose. Why you're with him.",
        "Alison: I thought you weren't going to tell me how I'm supposed to feel anymore.",
        "Chris: I'm telling you how I feel, all right, what I want. And I want you, to want me, Ali. To look at me the way I look at you. I want to be worthy of you loving me back.",

        "Faith: No that's not how it goes.",

        "Faith: You're supposed to say, \"Do you, Aaron, take Alison to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, till death do you part.\"",

        "Liberty: Since I was 5 -- um, Mom, do you have anything that buttons that high?",
        "Janet: No. So you know what this means?",
        "Liberty: No. No, no, no. You're not borrowing my stuff because you already stretched out my \"Italians do it better\" t-shirt.",

        "Brad: So, where are you going to be? You gonna be preparing my cell?",
        "Jack: No, I'm going to be in here with you. I'm going to help you through this.",
        "Brad: I don't want your help if it's just going to get me busted.",
        "Jack: Everything you know has got to come out, Brad, now. You don't want to make it seem like you're covering anything up.",
        "Brad: Or like you're covering anything up.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Brad: You heard me. I mean, you were more than willing to keep quiet about all this when it worked for you.",
        "Jack: No, time out! I was more than willing to keep what I knew to myself when I thought the case was closed. But now ev-- everything's changed.",
        "Brad: I'm still your brother. Is that changed? I am asking you to help keep me from going to jail.",
        "Jack: What do you expect me to do?",
        "Brad: I want you to take the evidence against me and get rid of it.",
        "Jack: No. No way. I'm not destroying evidence for you.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Jack: Well, for starters, it's illegal. And, secondly, upholding the law actually means something to me.",
        "Brad: But not me.",
        "Jack: I have been down this road before. I have broken the law to help somebody, and let me tell you something. It doesn't work, not for anyone.",
        "Brad: I am desperate here, Man. I know it is a lot to ask after what I put Parker through, but that is all on me. It is. But if I go to jail, I'm gonna lose everything. Every single thing that matters to me.",

        "Brad: Put yourself in my shoes. What if it was Sage?",
        "Jack: Stop. Stop it right there.",
        "Brad: No. I mean it. I know I haven't been the best brother. I have been a screw-up and a cheat, and I looked out for number one most of my life, and I took the easy road out, and I bailed on people when they needed me. But then something happened. I found something -- or someone that made sticking around look good. You know, for the first time in my life, Jack, I'm proud of who I am. I'm a husband now. I'm a good one. And I'm learning to be a father. I'm trying. I don't want to bail on them. I don't want to be just, you know, an absentee dad to Liberty and just one more guy that just promised to love Katie forever and couldn't go the distance.",

        "Alison: No. No, I don't. Okay? I'll just -- I'll just tell him that I had a lab or something, and he'll understand, and -- and I'll just be like dirt.",

        "Brad: Destroy the evidence they have against me.",
        "Katie: What? Brad, do you know what kind of position that puts him in?",
        "Brad: Yes, yes, yes, I do. I know it's not fair, but I'm fighting for our lives here, Katie.",
        "Katie: Well, there is a thing as asking too much.",
        "Brad: Look, look, if -- if Leo was still in a coma or, God forbid, he didn't make it, I would step up. You know that. But he's fine. He's fine now. And I have to look out for my family, and you are my family. So you tell me, do you want me to turn myself in?",

        "Liberty: Hello, uncle of mine. Just thought you might want to know I was with this ridiculously happy woman, formerly known only as my mom, helping her pick out a dress for this wedding.",
        "Jack: Why is she knocking herself out? She's got a half dozen things she looks fantastic in.",
        "Liberty: You're missing my point here.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm sorry. And that is?",
        "Liberty: Since you took my advice, you know, to give her a second chance, she's been really happy, and I've never seen her like this, ever. So don't fall down here. But thank you.",
        "Jack: All right. You're welcome. Although I would have gotten there on my own.",
        "Liberty: Um, maybe.",
        "Jack: So, how you doing after this -- this Leo Morrissey thing? It was pretty rough on you.",
        "Liberty: No. I'm a Ciccone. Nothing gets to us.",
        "Jack: For real.",
        "Liberty: It sucked. It really sucked. More for my dad than for -- for me, 'cause he was so mad and he wouldn't listen to anyone. He just -- he just kept saying, \"You hurt my daughter.\"",
        "Jack: Yeah. Dads can be like that sometimes.",
        "Liberty: I wouldn't know that. I've never had a dad before -- ever. But it was so weird having someone other than my mom care about me so much, and he just showed up and said that he would take care of me and everything would be fine. And it made me really realize something.",
        "Jack: What's that?",
        "Liberty: I have a dad. I have a dad, and he loves me, and he -- he cares about me, and he would do anything for me. And that is just so amazing, considering he didn't have to, 'cause I just kind of showed up full grown. But I guess that was all it takes. I can't imagine my life without him. Or without you. My uncle is pretty great, too. Thank you. Bye.",

        "Alison: What?",

        "Alison: I don't -- I don't know what I'm doing.",

        "Susan: Oh, I'm sorry you wasted a trip.",

        "Aaron: I know this happened very fast, and all you being here tonight means a lot. But what means most to me is Alison and that she agreed to marry me. I've never been good at saying how I feel. I've been told it's a Snyder thing.",
        "Emma: That's not true.",
        "Aaron: But I wrote it down. I wrote how I felt. And I gave it to Alison with a box of candy. And I wrote, \"We're together for good now.\" And I really meant it. I love you so much.",
        "Alison: I love you, too.",
        "Aaron: To Ali.",
        "Everyone: To Ali.",

        "Aaron: Well, I meant it. Where are the chocolates?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Aaron: The chocolates. We were gonna have them after dinner.",
        "Alison: Oh, uh, remember when you asked me before if I ate them and I -- and I kind of tried to change the subject?",
        "Aaron: Are you serious? All of them?",
        "Alison: I guess I was nervous. I wasn't really paying attention.",
        "Aaron: Okay, okay. That's fine. Just don't get sick on me. I only plan on getting married once.",
        "Emily: Can I talk to you for a second, please? I can't stand sitting next to you like this, knowing how miffed you are at me.",
        "Casey: What -- what am I supposed to do?",
        "Emily: Can you think of some way that you could be persuaded not to be mad at me anymore?",
        "Casey: I think there's something I can do, yeah.",
        "Emily: Come on.",
        "Alison: Would you please excuse me for a minute?",
        "Aaron: Where are you going?",
        "Alison: Uh, the ladies' room. I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Susan: I hope she's okay. She barely touched her dinner.",
        "Dani: Yeah. It must be all that nasty, sinful chocolate.",
        "Chris: Ali, what are you doing here? Did you tell Aaron?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Alison: And keep your voice down. I didn't tell him, and I'm not going to.",
        "Chris: Why not?",
        "Alison: I'm not gonna hurt him, Chris. Not for anything.",
        "Chris: No, you're just gonna marry him without ever telling him about us.",

        "[Giggles]",
        "Janet: I even made an extra one for us for later. We can have it with a little bit of whipped cream, a little caramel. A little -- what's wrong?",
        "Jack: Brad's in trouble. There's new evidence in Leo's case, and I'm the only one that knows that it connects back to him.",
        "Janet: What are you gonna do?",
        "Jack: Nothing. It's already done.",
        "Janet: Does anybody know you took it?",
        "Jack: No. And I want you to forget I did, too.",
        "Janet: Do you really think I can?",
        "Jack: If I ask you to, yes, Janet. That's exactly what I expect you to do.",
        "Janet: What's the evidence against Brad?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter, because I've gotten rid of it.",
        "Janet: No, you haven't. Give it to me.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: Give it to me! I will take it. I will hide it somewhere. I won't tell you where it is. And then you can forget all about it.",
        "Jack: No. I shouldn't have told you about this in the first place.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but -- wait, wait, wait. But you did. You trusted me enough to share this with me, okay? So if you hold onto it, it's gonna eat you alive. Please. After everything you've done for me and for Liberty and for Brad, please let me do this for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Am I forgiven?",
        "Casey: I don't know. I was pretty mad.",
        "Emily: I need -- I need for you to be serious for a minute.",
        "Casey: No, no. I do not want to be serious. I want to be naked.",

        "Casey: What?",
        "Emily: I need you to understand where I'm coming from, Case.",
        "Casey: I get it. You don't want to be married again. Yeah, even to me.",
        "Emily: Okay, the most important -- the most important word you just said was \"Again.\" I've been married, Case. It doesn't work for me. But this, what we have, it works better than I ever thought it could. So I don't need a ring to know that.",
        "Casey: Well, what do you want?",
        "Emily: I want you. I want you. I want to love you. Let Alison and Aaron get married, okay? Let them settle down. We can have any kind of future we want. Okay?",
        "Casey: Well, can you do something for me first?",
        "Emily: Name it.",
        "Casey: Stop bringing up the whole age thing, all right? You may think about it all the time, but I don't. I don't want that to be a part of our relationship.",
        "Emily: Okay. Fine. Anything else?",
        "Casey: Yes. Never ask me to stop kissing you, okay?",

        "Alison: What we did, it was terrible. It was a mistake. I want Aaron. I am marrying Aaron. I mean, how many times do I have to tell you that?",
        "Chris: Ali, I was there. I know better. I know every time we touched, every time you caught your breath, that told me how you felt about me.",
        "Alison: Stop it. Please.",

        "Aaron: How are you feeling?",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm fine. It's just there's -- there's so much to do and remember, and sometimes I'm just not great with stress.",
        "Aaron: You have nothing to be stressed about. It's gonna be you and me forever. The way it was always meant to be.",
