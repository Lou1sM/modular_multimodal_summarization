        "Rose: Neither did I!\u00a0 ",
        "Mitzi: Look at you, rose!\u00a0 When I left last year, you were a whatcha call it -- persona non\r\ngratis.\u00a0 I took bets in Atlantic City that you would be back in the\r\nkick line by Thanksgiving.\u00a0 ",
        "Rose: Oh, no.\u00a0 My dancing days are over.\u00a0 ",
        "Mitzi: I beg to differ.\u00a0 You were shaking it real nice at the Lakeview\r\nlast night.\u00a0 ",

        "Barbara: Yes, I am.\u00a0 Everything that was Barbara Ryan is\r\ngone.\u00a0 All that's left is a form without\r\na face.\u00a0 Look at me, Craig!\u00a0 You can't even look at me in the eyes because\r\nyou know that I am right.\u00a0 ",
        "Craig: Barbara, if I could change what\r\nhappened in the past, I would change it without hesitation.\u00a0 But I recommend you\r\nlook to your future.\u00a0 You do still have\r\none.\u00a0 ",
        "Barbara: As what?\u00a0 ",
        "Craig: You aren't tired of the way Lucinda\r\nlords around town?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 You put your shares with me,\r\nLucinda is out.\u00a0\r\nAnd you are the force to be reckoned with.\u00a0 I think you always wanted that.\u00a0 ",
        "Barbara: I wanted love.\u00a0 I wanted to be happily married to a man who\r\nadored me.\u00a0 Instead, I survived several\r\nmonths by being married to a man who made a fool of\r\nme.\u00a0 ",
        "Craig: That was never my intention, Barbara.\u00a0 All I was trying to do was make us rich.\u00a0 [Barbara laughs] ",

        "Barbara: Of what?\u00a0 Us being partners?\u00a0 Don't be ridiculous.\u00a0 I don't need to overthrow Lucinda Walsh to\r\nmake my mark on the world.\u00a0 ",
        "Craig: All right, let's talk turkey.\u00a0 Your company is losing money.\u00a0 BRO is about to go under.\u00a0 BRO \r\nneeds a savior, and like it or not, Barbara,\r\nI am the man for that job.\u00a0 ",

        "Carly: Now you love me, but what about\r\nlater?\u00a0 It's bound to happen, Jack it always does.\u00a0 I'll look at you, and instead of what I see\r\nnow, there'll be disappointment -- uncertainty.\u00a0\r\nYou won't even know it's there.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: I was there.\u00a0 Take another look.\u00a0 The only thing you'll see is me and my\r\ncommitment.\u00a0 And\r\nit's not going anywhere, I promise you that.\u00a0\r\nI sent my ego packing.\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: What about me?\u00a0\r\nAm I allowed to have any uncertainty?\u00a0\r\nI thought we loved each other enough that we could get through anything,\r\nJack.\u00a0 But instead,\r\nwhenever something happened, I had to beg you to keep having faith in me.\u00a0 I can't do that anymore.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: You're right.\u00a0 Everything you said is completely true.\u00a0 And it's all my\r\nfault.\u00a0 But I'm gonna fix it.\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: How?\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: By bringing you home -- to Oakdale,\r\nwhere you belong.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: Why don't you come home before that\r\nhappens?\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: Because I don't even know where home is anymore\r\nJack!\u00a0 That's why I'm lugging my\r\nportfolio all over this town, trying to get somebody to say something other\r\nthan, \"You've got great talent, Ms. Tenney.\u00a0 Too bad you\r\ndon't have enough experience.\" ",
        "Jack: Just like I\u2019ve always told you, with\r\nthe amount of experience that you have, it's only a matter of time before\r\nsomeone's smart enough to give you a break.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Carly: That's what I have to keep telling myself.\u00a0 That if I want to be a designer, I have to\r\nkeep knocking on doors.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but do those doors have to be\r\nhere?\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: Yes.\u00a0 They\r\nsure as heck aren't in Oakdale, Jack, so unless I want to pack and go to Paris -- the only chance\r\nI have at making something of myself is here.\u00a0\r\nAnd it doesn't cost plane fare.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: All right.\u00a0 So this is where you\r\nneed to be.\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: For as long as it takes.\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: Are you shaking?\u00a0 ",
        "Carly: Why wouldn't I be?\u00a0\r\nMy savings are shrinking faster than my morale.\u00a0 This hotel room costs a fortune.\u00a0 And the rents here\r\nare ridiculous, Jack!\u00a0 ",
        "Jack: Don't tell me you're already thinking\r\nabout quitting?\u00a0 ",
        "Carly:\r\nWhenever I do, I think about Jessica Griffin making me look like a parasite,\r\nliving off one man after another.\u00a0 Hers\r\nwill not be the last word, Jack.\u00a0 The\r\nnext time they hear my name in Oakdale, it will be because I am somebody.\u00a0 ",

        "Simon: So his name was Bruno, and you've\r\nbeen dating?\u00a0 ",
        "Katie: Nothing serious.\u00a0 Just a chance meeting at\r\nthe lounge downstairs, a few glasses of wine, a walk under the stars.\u00a0 It's an Italian thing, you wouldn't\r\nunderstand.\u00a0 ",
        "Simon: And you would?\u00a0 You're not Italian, Katie.\u00a0 You're as American as cherry pie.\u00a0 ",

        "Katie: Anyway, one thing led to another -- a\r\nknife wound?\u00a0 ",
        "Simon: No, no, don't you get off the subject.\u00a0 ",
        "Katie: Being Italian led to making wine in\r\nmy bare feet like the peasant women used to do.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Simon: Well, at least you're wearing your\r\nbikini like the old peasant women used to do.\u00a0\r\n",
