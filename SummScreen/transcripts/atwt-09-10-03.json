        "Mordecai told Mike and Katie that he intended to leave Mike in the cellar to die, while he took Katie to Sydney. Mike was determined to find a way to escape. Susan visited Rick at the asylum, and was told that he only has moments of lucidity. During one of these moments, he told her he chose her as his target because she was beautiful, successful, lonely, and desperate. Hal provided Jen with the transcript of the 911 call the night of the bust at Java Underground. She raced straight to the bar with the proof that Craig ratted out his own business. Barbara told Hal she was worried about Jen, but he reminded her she was a grown woman. She told him that she believed that Paul was financing Andre, but admitted she had no proof. Hal warned her that she'd be sorry if she turned her kids against each other. Paul told Rosanna that he was not the one that made the 911 call. The \"James\" in Paul's head told him he missed a perfect opportunity to get to Craig and Dusty through Rosanna."

        "Katie: So you're gonna let Mike go? If it's just you and me going to Sydney.",
        "Mordecai: Ah, no. Your friend stays here.",
        "Katie: But, Mike can help us. You know, two hostages are better than one. Why leave him here?",
        "Mordecai: Because I don't like him. Because the two of you are trouble together. You know, there's that whole business with the record player. And then, you know, the poor bloke that stuck his nose in where it didn't belong. That one's on you, mate. You know, if you hadn't gotten all creative, he'd be at home having tea with his missus right now. As it is, the poor bugger's dead. And someone's got to sit around and take the blame.",
        "Mike: Take me to Sydney. Leave Katie here.",
        "Mordecai: Oh, and why would I want to do that?",
        "Mike: Because it's a better plan. Once Simon sees Katie, you're gonna lose all your leverage. Leave her here and take me, okay? I'll convince Simon that you've got Katie and then you can do whatever you want with me.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Mordecai: See? She wants to die with her husband. You know, who am I to deny a beautiful woman's last wish. Say your last good-byes. You're never gonna see each other again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mom, listen, I know you want answers. But now that we're here, will you just take a look around? This is where they keep people who are criminally insane. Do you really think you're gonna get answers from a man who's lost his mind?",
        "Alison: That's what I was thinking. Now that Rick is locked up, he probably blames you or me or Emily. He's only going to try to make you feel worse.",
        "Susan: I'll know if he's telling me the truth --",
        "Alison: About what?",
        "Emily: What do you want him to say, exactly?",
        "Doctor: Dr. Stewart --",
        "Susan: May I see my husband now?",
        "Doctor: It's highly irregular. But as a special favor to Lieutenant Munson, we'll allow a short visit. But only you, Dr. Stewart. Your daughters will have to wait.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. My mother is not going in there alone. No.",
        "Susan: Honey, it's better this way.",
        "Alison: Do you have any idea what he did to her?",
        "Susan: Please, girls. It's gonna be all right. Just wait for me here.",
        "Doctor: I should warn you, Dr. Stewart. Your husband has had a psychotic break. He will be greatly changed --",
        "Susan: I know what a psychotic break is, doctor. Please, just let me see my husband now so I can get this over with? Please.",
        "Emily: All right. We'll be here, waiting for you, okay?",
        "Alison: All right, just don't let him get to you. Just 'cause he's saying something doesn't mean he's right.",
        "Susan: Rick?",
        "Doctor: Rick? You have a visitor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Hey, Dad.",
        "Hal: Hey! Hey, how's my favorite girl?",
        "Jennifer: I'm good.",
        "Hal: So what's up?",
        "Jennifer: I was wondering if you could answer for me a police-type question.",
        "Hal: A police-type question?",
        "Jennifer: Well, considering you are a policeman and all.",
        "Hal: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So what's the question?",
        "Jennifer: Who made the 9-11 call that led to the arrests at the Java Underground the other day? I mean, you guys should have that on record, right? Even if they didn't leave their name? You could trace the phone number and figure out who called?",
        "Hal: Dusty Donovan and Craig Montgomery were arrested for soliciting bets, and that's a felony. And I can't think for the life of me how that would involve you.",
        "Jennifer: Believe me, dad, I wish it didn't. But unfortunately, I am involved. Personally involved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey, where were you? I tried you at Rose's. Mitzi told me you were persona non grata. What happened?",
        "Dusty: Rose found out we got hauled in for bookmaking and threw me out.",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Craig: No. Well, what does that have to do with anything?",
        "Dusty: That's how women are. You ought to know. There's something in life you want to do that has nothing to do with them, they don't like it. They make you pay.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sorry for you.",
        "Dusty: Don't be sorry. It's not your fault.",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Craig: Hello, officer. I'd like to report gambling in a local bar, and I'd like to know when you're going to take care of it.",
        "Dusty: One phone call. I lose Rose, maybe the club, like that! One phone call.",
        "Craig: No, it'll work out.",
        "Dusty: It'll work out? I'll work it out. On Paul Ryan's skull.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna, hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi. I should have called.",
        "Paul: No, are you kidding? Come on, you're always welcome. Come on in. Can I get you something? You want something to drink? Is something the matter?",
        "Rosanna: Um, well, uh. No, no.",
        "Paul: Something's wrong. What is it?",
        "Rosanna: Please don't take what I have to ask you the wrong way. You've been a friend. You've been a very good friend, and I trust you. And that's why I'm here. 'Cause I need to ask you something. It's very important to me.",
        "Paul: Is it about Craig?",
        "Rosanna: Why would you say that?",
        "Paul: I don't know, it's just that -- you seem upset, and when you're upset like that, isn't it usually about Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: He doesn't know me.",
        "Doctor: As I mentioned, he's still having periods of lucidity and then, without warning, he retreats, as you can see.",
        "Susan: And the straitjacket?",
        "Doctor: He attacked an orderly, and he's been given a mild sedative.",
        "Susan: He attacked an orderly?",
        "Doctor: The orderly was in no danger, but Rick could have been hurt.",
        "Susan: Doctor, do you think it's possible that he's faking any of this? He's a doctor, he would know all the symptoms. He would know how to portray them. And he's lied. He's lied to everybody, to me, so many times.",
        "Doctor: No. From what I've observed, there's no question that he's mentally ill.",
        "Susan: And I had questions only he could answer. I guess it was foolish of me to hope that he was gonna be in any condition to answer them. Thank you for your time.",
        "Rick: Susan.",
        "Doctor: Susan wants to talk to you, Rick. If you think you're up to it.",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Susan: Are you sure you know who I am?",
        "Rick: Yes. I could hear you before. I knew you'd come back, Susan.",
        "Susan: I'm not back. I just came here to ask you some questions, and I need you to tell me the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, I'm sure there are times in any relationship where the husband or the wife is capable of causing a little bit of tension. But Craig is also extremely kind and understand --",
        "Paul: Hey, wait, hold on a second. I'm sure that he is. I'm really sorry. The last thing that I wanted to do was make you any more upset than you already were. Will you please sit down? Please? Sit down.",
        "Rosanna: Sure.",
        "Paul: Can I get you anything?",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm fine. Fine.",
        "Paul: This is all my fault.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Well, I thought that Craig could come over and talk and he wouldn't have to go running to you.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry, Craig was here?",
        "Paul: That's not why you're here?",
        "Rosanna: No. When was he here?",
        "Paul: Yesterday. He stopped by.",
        "Rosanna: What did he want?",
        "Paul: I'm not really sure. Look, you got to know, Craig and I, we don't agree on much. Yesterday, it was really no exception.",
        "Rosanna: I admire your discretion, but you don't have to protect him. I can imagine why he was here. He wanted to accuse you of tipping off the police about Dusty's little foray into bookmaking.",
        "Paul: Yeah, the subject came up.",
        "Rosanna: I hate to ask you this. He's just been so adamant about the whole thing.",
        "Paul: I did not call the cops. I didn't. I mean, that phone call wrecked any chance that you had of adopting, and why would I do that? I wouldn't hurt you like that. I didn't even know about the bookmaking stuff until after the fact.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Okay, I believe you. Thank you. I'm sorry I had to ask --",
        "Paul: Not at all. You'll let me know if there's anything I can do to help, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. There's nothing anybody can do to help.",
        "Paul: Well, it might help to know who actually did make the call.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it wasn't Craig, all right? He didn't do it. He wouldn't do something like that. He knows how much it mattered to me. He just wouldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: It's got to be Paul. It's got to be. Jennifer saw me stash the cash, she told Paul, Paul saw it as an opportunity, bang, we're dead.",
        "Craig: You questioned Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: No need to question anybody. I'm not a cop. Somebody crossed me. I'm not gonna let it sit, you understand?",
        "Craig: Hey, you're not gonna get an argument from me. I lived with his mother.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, he acts just like his mother.",
        "Craig: Well, that's not gonna get this place up and running.",
        "Dusty: Craig, unless we get these charges dismissed, we're not gonna have a liquor license. Hence, we got no club.",
        "Craig: Hey, Dust, these things can be finessed.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? You got a judge in your pocket? 'Cause I don't. And the Liquor Control Board's tied up real tight this year, if you don't know.",
        "Craig: It'll work out.",
        "Dusty: Well, I admire your cool, I really do. Ever since the cops busted in here, you've been totally unrattled. And sometimes, vaguely happy. Why is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You're personally involved with Craig Montgomery?",
        "Jennifer: No, of course not.",
        "Hal: Honey, he still blames you for Bryant. You get anywhere near the man, you're asking for trouble.",
        "Jennifer: I have stayed away from him, dad. I have. And I still blame me for Bryant. Listen, this has nothing to do with Craig. It's Dusty.",
        "Hal: You're personally involved with Dusty Donovan?",
        "Jennifer: Not like you think.",
        "Hal: I thought he was seeing Rose D'Angelo?",
        "Jennifer: He is. I'm involved with him -- okay, it's like this. Dusty and Craig hate Paul. And they've accused Paul, and me, of tipping off the police.",
        "Hal: Oh.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, so it's gotten pretty ugly. And I wanted to figure out a way, maybe some proof, to show that we didn't have anything to do with it. And I thought that if I could get that from you, then they'd leave us alone and I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore.",
        "Hal: Honey, you're a grown woman, and I can't tell you what to do. But Dusty Donovan and Craig Montgomery, they have nothing to offer. I mean, nothing real. They're like a couple of kids who never grew up. Worse, they're self- centered, they're dishonest, and they're broke. And when they see a beautiful young woman with her whole life in front of her -- a successful young woman --",
        "Jennifer: I will be careful, daddy. I promise. Besides, it's Paul I'm worried about. He just got back into town. And I don't want a war with Craig or Dusty to drive him away again. And it could. You know, this whole thing with Rose is still eating at him. I worry about him. You know what I mean?",
        "Hal: Yes, I do.",
        "Jennifer: So? Can you get me the number? It's not gonna get you into trouble, is it?",
        "Hal: 911 calls aren't really classified. Anyway, when have I ever been able to say no to my favorite girl.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you daddy.",
        "Hal: This may take a minute.",
        "Jennifer: I'll wait right here.",
        "Barbara: Well, what a wonderful surprise -- oh, I have missed you. It is so good to see you.",
        "Jennifer: I am not speaking to you, mother, and you know it, so back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why are you having him handcuff me if I'm going to Sydney ?",
        "Mordecai: Well, because there's lots of stuff before we go. You know? And I don't want you wandering off. All right, step aside. And if I come back and you've wandered off? I'll just put a bullet right through her skull. Hmm?",
        "Katie: Mike, just run. He's not gonna shoot me. He needs me to get Simon.",
        "Mike: I won't put you in danger --",
        "Katie: Come on, you can run to the police station --",
        "Mike: By then you'll be dead, and he'll be long gone. No, we've got to find a way to tip off Simon or warn Margo.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe when she hears that the constable doesn't call her back --",
        "Mike: I'm hoping his station can send somebody to look for him.",
        "Katie: And what if they don't? And what if I can't send Simon a signal?",
        "Mike: He's smart. He'll figure it out.",
        "Katie: What if he doesn't, Mike?",
        "Mike: Look, let's take one disaster at a time. All right? You'll do fine. Once you get to Sydney , you'll have plenty of opportunities to get away from him. It is a big town. He's gonna be overwhelmed. He'll make a mistake.",
        "Katie: And in the meanwhile, you'll -- what?",
        "Mike: Don't worry about me.",
        "Katie: This is all my fault. I never should've gotten you figured into this whole thing.",
        "Mike: Katie, I wouldn't have it any other way. We're best friends, remember?",
        "Katie: The absolute best.",
        "Mike: A year from now we're gonna look back on this and laugh.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry, Mike.",
        "Mike: Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "Katie: But what if we never see each other again?",
        "Mike: We're gonna see each other again. And the only problem will be whether I like your husband or not.",
        "Katie: You'll like him.",
        "Mike: I'll like him. And I'll hate him.",
        "Katie: Oh, Mike.",
        "Mordecai: Say good-bye, Katie.",
        "Katie: Where are you taking him?",
        "Mike: I'll be fine.",
        "Katie: Come on.",
        "Mike: Don't hurt her.",
        "Mordecai: Or you'll do what? Not much. Not now.",
        "Mike: You're finally gonna make good on all those threats, aren't you? You're gonna kill me?",
        "Mordecai: Uh, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I found those pictures you took of me. In Orlando? Before we even met. When you were -- what? Were you stalking me? I don't know, you picked me out for whatever reason and decided that I would be your cover? What? I don't know. What was I? Besides a fool. But you had a plan. You were looking for someone like me. Weren't you?",
        "Rick: For someone just like you.",
        "Susan: Why?",
        "Rick: I saw you at the conference, the lectures, the receptions. And you were attractive, professional, accomplished -- like a lot of women these days. But there was something -- something more. You were --",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Rick: Lonely. I got the feeling you'd been alone for a long time. I found that attractive.",
        "Susan: Attractive? Stop it.",
        "Rick: You were a dream come true. Vulnerable, desperate for attention. I knew that you would stick by me no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, you can't shut me out forever. I am your mother.",
        "Jennifer: No decent mother would ever do what you did to me. To pay off a man that I -- that I cared about.",
        "Barbara: He was using you, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: No, mother, he was using you. He was using your money and your obsession with controlling everyone in your life. Which is why Paul has left you and why I am now leaving you.",
        "Barbara: Wait just a second. Your brother is angry with the world right now, and I just happen to be a convenient target.",
        "Jennifer: You are at the root of it, mother. You are the basis for everything. Your -- I can't even call it love. The way that you treat people that you should love is criminal. And if you can't manipulate them, you suffocate them with your guilt and your endless vendettas. And I can't take it anymore. Paul's right. The only way to deal with you is from a distance. So good-bye, Mom.",
        "Barbara: This is your fault, Paul.",
        "Hal: Hey, Jen. Where're you going?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I was just looking for you. Did you find out who made the call?",
        "Hal: This is a copy of the transcript.",
        "Jennifer: Craig ratted out his own partner?",
        "Hal: Like I said. Evil little boys who never grew up",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What about Katie?",
        "Mordecai: She'll be dead. She and her husband --",
        "[grunting]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Which means that little call you made to the Oakdale Police to rat out your partner is on file.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Dusty, I have often been told my attitude is confusing. But I'm not underestimating the damages here. I know what it's gonna take to get the charges dropped, the liquor license granted, this place up and running. It's just that there's a silver lining here I hadn't anticipated.",
        "Dusty: You discovered you like pain?",
        "Craig: No, not usually. It's just that my wife's desire to have a baby is -- well, babies are good, it's just not for me, not now. Not now.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you been there.",
        "Craig: No, no. It's just that there are so many other things that I want to tackle. Including my wife. But it's nice that the adoption agencies just happen to frown on bookies.",
        "Dusty: Alleged. Alleged bookies.",
        "Craig: Yes. Well, Rosanna has been making noises about me ending my relationship with you.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Craig: I told her no. I told her no, that I'd made a commitment to you.",
        "Dusty: You bet you made a commitment. Let me tell you something. The women in this town? They're control freaks, all of 'em. Lily, trying to keep me away from Rose, Rose trying to keep me away from everybody.",
        "Craig: Well, they're twins.",
        "Dusty: Your wife. Insisting you toe the line like you're 5. Jennifer, with her girly manipulations. To hell with 'em. I put my faith in you, pal. We're gonna do great things.",
        "Craig: Yes we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Why would Craig jeopardize his own business?",
        "Hal: Well, whatever the reason, it made sense to Craig at the time.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it triggered Dusty to come after Paul and me. Maybe that was the point. But to sacrifice your business? I mean, he must really hate us.",
        "Hal: Jennifer, I want you to stay out of this.",
        "Jennifer: I will, dad. Don't worry. I've got the proof I need now, so Dusty can back off and I can get Paul to calm down.",
        "Hal: Honey, that's not your job.",
        "Jennifer: I know dad. It'll be okay, I promise.",
        "Barbara: Something wrong out here?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing's wrong. And it's none of your business. Thanks, dad.",
        "Barbara: I'm worried about her.",
        "Hal: Well, that's your job.",
        "Barbara: Only I blew it.",
        "Hal: I don't know all the details, and I don't want to know, Barbara, but apparently you interfered with one of Jennifer's boyfriends?",
        "Barbara: He was a gigolo, Hal.",
        "Hal: She's a grown woman.",
        "Barbara: And the guy had already taken her once. Do I want to stand by and watch it happen all over again?",
        "Hal: Like I said, I don't want to know.",
        "Barbara: But you're prepared to blame me, right?",
        "Hal: I'm not blaming anyone, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Well, I am. And this is all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Ah, thank you so much. I'm so sorry if I bit your head off.",
        "Paul: No. No, not at all. Unless it's me that you're upset with.",
        "Rosanna: No. No. I have to admit, it's very tempting to think that Craig made that call to the police. That he could do something so selfish. That he would purposefully sabotage our chances at adopting.",
        "Paul: Did Craig ever give you any reason to think that he didn't want any more kids? Not that doubts would justify an end run, but -- did he?",
        "Rosanna: He had some reservations, but we agreed. I don't know what I'm saying. Of course, it's possible. Of course, it's possible, but, you know what, I'd really rather not talk about it.",
        "Paul: Great. You know what, we won't talk about this. Not anymore. We could -- yeah, we could go sit out on the terrace if you wanted. You could enjoy your view.",
        "Rosanna: That's a great -- that's really sweet. It's a lovely view. I'm glad you're enjoying it. But, you know what, I should go. It's late. I'm sorry I stopped by unannounced. I won't do that anymore.",
        "Paul: Not at all. Look, you're welcome anytime. Look, you're one of the few friends that I have in this town, and I always really like seeing you.",
        "Rosanna: Thanks. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mordecai: I'm gonna leave you here, locked up in this cellar. No food. No water. No one to come snooping around. I mean, I know that was what you were hoping for, right? That some cop would come looking for the bloke we just buried. Well, sorry to disappoint you. They're gonna be looking for their mate in Queensland .",
        "Mike: What happens when they don't find him?",
        "Mordecai: They will. That's the beauty part. One of the handy things about having mates. Oh, and don't bother screaming. This place has been deserted for years. There's no one for miles. Next time someone comes round -- in a couple years, all they'll find is a pile of bones.",
        "Mike: What about Katie?",
        "Mordecai: She'll be dead. She and her husband --",

        "Doctor: Why don't we call this a day?",
        "Susan: No. Not yet. Because he's wrong. You're wrong. I trusted you. That's what you do when you love someone, when he says he loves you and begs you to marry him.",
        "Rick: Words you wanted to hear, Susan. The day we were married, you ignored your children, your friends, your instincts.",
        "Susan: Because I loved you.",
        "Rick: Because you wanted someone, anyone, even a serial killer, to share your bed, to fill up your empty life.",
        "Susan: No. That's not true.",
        "Rick: Susan --",
        "Susan: No. I had my friends, I had my family, I had my career.",
        "Rick: Susan, you made the case yourself. The failed marriages, the affairs, the drinking, the problems with your children. You're lucky I was certifiable. A sane man would have run for the nearest exit.",
        "Susan: But I wanted you to know about my past. Because I wanted you to know what I'd overcome. I was sober -- I'm sober.",
        "Rick: Susan, please.",

        "Rick: Susan, you're an attractive woman with a good job. But the truth is, you haven't felt good about yourself for a long time. And I haven't either. That's what we had in common.",
        "Susan: No. I may have wanted a husband, or even longed for someone to share my life with. But I never wanted a weak, pathetic, craven psychopath to share my life with --",
        "Doctor: He's gone.",

        "Katie: So what did you do? Where is he?",
        "Mordecai: Oh, you'll see him again. In heaven. Or in hell.",

        "Craig: Fell off the truck?",
        "Dusty: Off the boat, actually. I'm saving it for a special occasion.",
        "Craig: And here she is.",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Craig: Ah, survival. It makes life worth living. You would walk in here after what you've done?",
        "Jennifer: I could say the same for you. But then you don't read the fine print, do you? So you never realized that you pay a 911 surcharge on your cell phone. Which means that little call you made to the Oakdale Police to rat out your partner is on file.",
        "Craig: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jennifer: It means you're busted, Craig. And I have the proof. Oh, forgot the cookies.",

        "Orderly: You almost have to feel sorry for the guy.",
        "Doctor: Well, that would be a mistake. He's killed half a dozen innocent people and ruined the lives of countless others. If you want to feel for anybody, feel for them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I knew he would upset you.",
        "Susan: Of course it upset me, seeing him like that. In a straitjacket. It was horrible. Made me realize how irresponsible I've been. You were right about him. I should have listened to you.",
        "Emily: No. Until Alison found that safety deposit box, it was all speculation.",
        "Alison: And lots of kids hate their stepfathers.",
        "Susan: Oh, honey. I have been so foolish! I have been so foolish to put you two in danger like that. Alison, when I think of what you went through --",

        "Hal: I don't know. And I don't care.",
        "Barbara: He got it from Paul, obviously. I'm sure that Paul probably bankrolled this entire escapade. He's probably still paying this guy off.",

        "Barbara: Let my children go?",
        "Hal: The only way that you are gonna get 'em back is if you change your tactics, Barbara. Just be a friend. And don't spy on them. And don't build cases to justify one of 'em hating the other.",

        "Imaginary James: Close, but no cigar. And I had such hopes. I mean, the way you reeled Rosanna in -- ah! Beautiful work. Beautiful work. I could imagine how you could use her to get to Montgomery and then to Mr. Dustin Donovan himself. And you've spoiled everything because you've fallen for the woman.",
        "Paul: No, that's your fantasy, not mine.",
