        "Col. Mayer: No, no, don't get me wrong, Henry. Noah's a good kid.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, but you didn't like who he was hanging with back home, right? What was wrong with them? They were long-haired hoodlums? Or axe murders? Or the rival service branch?",
        "Col. Mayer: No, no, nothing like that. No.",
        "Henry: Nothing like which? Look, if this past of Noah's catches up with him while he's living with Maddie, I need to know the details, you know, name, rank, serial number --",
        "Col. Mayer: No, it's nothing --it's nothing that you need to worry about. You have my word on that. Maddie -- Maddie's just been a good influence on my son. That's all I meant to say.",
        "Henry: Hey, Luke -- hey, what are you doing? You here to check out the new menu?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm hearing good things.",
        "Henry: All right, great. Have you met the Colonel?",
        "Col. Mayer: Yeah, we've met. Excuse me, I -- I need to make some phone calls.",
        "Henry: What was that about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Sleep is very important to me.",
        "Noah: Funny, sleeping is not the first thing that came to mind when we talked about bed shopping.",
        "Maddie: Ah, I know. How much extra did you pay to get the mattress shipped today?",
        "Noah: What can I say? I was really looking forward to spending our first night in our new apartment.",
        "Maddie: Me too. Thank you.",
        "Noah: You can thank my dad. He's the one who gave me the money for all the new bedroom furniture.",
        "Maddie: He did? That's weird. I thought he'd be kind of old-school about us living together. I mean, I know he said that he was okay with it, but I really didn't think that he approved.",
        "Noah: Maddie, when it comes to you, he approves of everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, his credit card was denied at Al's and I think it brought a tear to Craig's eye. And he and Meg have been evicted from the Lakeview. They don't have access to another dime of your money. Yeah, I thought that might cheer you up. Yeah, I'm good. No, I'm great. But Rosanna, I wouldn't mind it if you came home soon. I miss you. Great, I'll see you soon.",
        "Maid: Excuse me, Mr. Ryan?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maid: I found this upstairs. What would you like me to do with it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This isn't the way you pictured our marriage starting out. I know that, but I'm really okay being here.",
        "Craig: I'm really not. And no offense to your family. They're wonderful people, but I -- need some time alone with you, you know, don't you?",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course. But you know there is something to be said about fresh eggs. Wait 'til you taste these --",
        "Craig: Stop, Meg, don't do that.",
        "Meg: You don't want breakfast?",
        "Craig: No, I want you to stop trying so hard to make the best of it. I really can't stand it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: Of course, we're going for a completely different look in this unit. We're hoping to attract upscale young couples with children. Any questions so far?",
        "Carly: Uh, no. Hmm-mm.",
        "Ed: See, Brad said that none of this would be a problem for you. That you'd be full of ideas. Do you have any ideas?",
        "Carly: Yes, I do.",
        "Ed: 'Cause you've hardly said a word all morning. Is something wrong?",
        "Carly: No. I'm just thinking.",
        "Ed: You do want this job, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: Everybody kept telling us that we were rushing into this marriage and I guess they were right.",
        "Jack: Katie --",
        "Katie: How could we have never talked about something so important?",
        "Jack: It never occurred to me, okay? Because I have three amazing kids already. And I can barely take care of them --",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Jack, you're an amazing father.",
        "Jack: Right, I let one of my sons get kidnapped.",
        "Katie: And then you saved his life.",
        "Jack: And I almost sent another one to camp for troubled kids for something that he didn't even do.",
        "Katie: But you didn't. And Parker's back on the right track. Your kids are amazing, Jack. And I love them.",
        "Jack: Yes. And they love you.",
        "Katie: I know and I'm very honored and I will love to be their step-mom. But you have to understand that that's not the same thing as making a baby with you. That's half me and half you. That's only in this world because of how much we love each other.",
        "Jack: Katie, when you get right down to it, most people, they -- they have babies for selfish reasons because they want them. Pure and simple. And that's great. But when they're here --",
        "Katie: You have to be completely selfless. I know. I was ready to do that with Mike.",
        "Jack: But Mike doesn't have three kids already. Katie, I'm sorry. I didn't even realize that you wanted --",
        "Katie: Well, now you do.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Katie: And you don't want to have another child. And that's it. Just case closed?",
        "Jack: Do I have to decide right now?",
        "Katie: Before we get married? Yeah.",
        "Jack: So, what are you saying? That if I don't change my mind, the wedding's off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I can handle sleeping in a twin bed. I can even handle Sage squeezing all the toothpaste out of the wrong end. I will pluck the chickens for you if I have to. The one thing I cannot handle is being a disappointment to you.",
        "Meg: You're not.",
        "Craig: How can you say that I'm not? You only stayed married to me because I offered you the reins of a multinational corporation. Now, I can't offer you anything. I can't even put a roof over your head.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? You need a shower. After your shower, you will feel so much better.",
        "Craig: You know what? This is your family homestead. You get first dibs.",
        "Meg: Uh, no, I have chores.",
        "Craig: Chores, chores. I've got to tell you, there's something very sexy about you in the role of milkmaid, you know that?",
        "Meg: See? I told you that there were benefits to life on the farm. Okay, I have to warn you -- don't use all the hot water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: One of the things that made me fall in love with you was knowing what a wonderful father you'd be to our child and to know that you never want to have a baby with me is just --",
        "Jack: No, I never said never, Katie. That's just how I feel right now --",
        "Katie: I know and I'm going to try and change your mind about something that you don't want. That's just not going to happen.",
        "Jack: Katie --",
        "Katie: I just -- please, I don't want to talk about it anymore.",
        "Jack: Maybe I didn't explain myself very well. Can I -- please -- please, please -- can you just hear me out?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Realtor: I am sorry to keep the happy couple waiting. Are you all set to look at some terrific properties?",
        "Katie: Actually, I'm sorry --",
        "Jack: No, yes, yes. Yes, we are. Okay?",
        "Katie: Are you sure you want to?",
        "Realtor: We can do this another day --",
        "Jack: No, we're getting married soon and we need a place to live.",
        "Realtor: Okay. Well, the first one I have for you is a brand-new listing and I think you're going to fall in love with it.",
        "Jack: Why's that?",
        "Realtor: Four bedrooms, two and a half baths total. And an alcove off the master bedroom that would be perfect for that nursery that you were telling about, Katie. And here's the kicker, they're opening a co-op preschool in the bottom of the building next year. Isn't that perfect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I didn't sleep very well last night. If you just give me some time alone in this space, I'll check it out. I'll take some measurements and I will be prepared to dazzle.",
        "Ed: Can I hear from you by the end of the day? With something concrete?",
        "Carly: Sure -- yeah. But I better get to work then.",
        "Ed: Okay. I don't want to hover. Lock the door behind you when you leave.",
        "Carly: You got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I guess I rubbed the Colonel the wrong way for some reason. Oh, I just remembered. I've got to talk to this professor about this class I want to audit. Um, I gotta run.",
        "Henry: Wait, don't you want to eat?",
        "Luke: Oh, I'll be back later. Bye.",
        "Henry: Get you some coffee there.",
        "Col. Mayer: Oh, thanks. Oh, somebody left their umbrella here.",
        "Henry: Oh, actually that's mine. I'm planning a wedding shower for my best friend, Katie. Actually, she works with Noah over at WOAK.",
        "Col. Mayer: Your best friend's a woman?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Col. Mayer: And she's having a bridal shower here in a diner?",
        "Henry: Yeah, it's non-traditional. All right, it's co-ed.",
        "Col. Mayer: Oh, I see. Wow, you know, I can't decide what to order. I'm trying to watch my weight -- watch what I eat, but everything looks really good.",
        "Henry: Well, we're working on it. Although, it doesn't look like you need to watch what you eat.",
        "Col. Mayer: Yeah. I still run three miles every morning. You know, try to stay in fighting shape. You know, I would like to wear my dress blues for Noah's wedding when that day comes.",
        "Henry: Wow, you really -- you really plan ahead, don't you?",
        "Col. Mayer: Well, yeah, somebody in this family needs to. I mean, when Noah moved here, he didn't know anyone. And he didn't know what he was going to do with his life or beyond this summer. So, that's why I'm really glad he met Maddie.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, she's not his only friend. I mean, Maddie and Noah and Luke -- they're all really tight.",
        "Col. Mayer: Yeah, so I understand.",
        "Henry: Go to school together, they work together. I think it's great to have a stable group like that that can support one another.",
        "Col. Mayer: Stable? That's a matter of opinion.",
        "Henry: Yeah, colonel, I couldn't help but notice a chill in the air when Luke came in. Did he do something to offend you?",
        "Col. Mayer: Let's just say I know Luke's type, and I don't want my son to have anything to do with him. You know, I just realized. I'm late for an appointment. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where'd you find this?",
        "Maid: In the guest room where Mrs. Montgomery was staying.",
        "Paul: She stayed in the guest room? Not with Craig?",
        "Maid: I believe so. [Door bell rings] Mrs. Montgomery is insisting on seeing you.",
        "Meg: You've got a problem with me? Then leave Craig out of this. Be a man and leave him the hell alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Realtor: Now, this would be in the Centennial school district, which, as I'm sure you know, is tops in the state achievement tests every year.",
        "Katie: That's great.",
        "Realtor: Now, the model is in the process of being redesigned, so please do your best to ignore the decor. But the master is to die for. There's a hot tub, and a gas fireplace. Come on, let's go take a look.",
        "Jack: Actually, we're wondering if we can just take a look ourselves.",
        "Realtor: There's a number of features I don't want you to miss, though.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know, we have a listing. I mean, we like to take our time and talk.",
        "Realtor: Sure.",
        "Katie: We'll call you as soon as we want to see some more apartments.",
        "Realtor: Okay, great. But if you're in a time crunch, I'd suggest you don't delay more than a day or two. And I hope you like it.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Realtor: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Jack, what are we doing? I'm not going to get this place.",
        "Jack: We've always wanted a Jacuzzi in the master bath.",
        "Katie: Its way too close to the highway. Which is not good for little kids. And if we're not going to have kids anyway, then what's the point of all this space --",
        "Jack: Katie, listen to me. Listen to me. Do you have any --do you have any idea how hard it is to support three kids on a cop's salary? And Carly -- she's basically unemployed.",
        "Katie: I work.",
        "Jack: Yes, but are you going to want to after you have a brand-new baby in the house?",
        "Katie: I'll bring he or she to work with me. There's a woman in editing that just had a little girl, and she talked to me about sharing a nanny.",
        "Jack: Again, that's another expense.",
        "Katie: Did you see our mortgage application? I do make six figures and I have pretty good savings.",
        "Jack: This is great.",
        "Katie: Jack, do you have a problem with me making more money than you?",
        "Jack: No, of course not. It's just -- it's just going to take a little getting used to not worrying about money, that's all. It's kind of ingrained.",
        "Katie: We can afford a new home. We can afford another baby. So, what's the real reason you don't want one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Not to worry, Darling. You can sell that device in your hand, and you will have enough to be able to afford a room at the Wagon Wheel. Although, wait a moment. You look just perfect the way you are, right now, down here on the farm.",
        "Craig: I should have known that you would crawl over here to gloat.",
        "Lucinda: Who are you texting? Not that I can imagine anyone wants to get a message from you, certainly not any of your associates at M.E., your company -- you know, as a matter of fact, there was a general atmosphere of glee at the office.",
        "Craig: If you're so convinced that I'm dead and buried, then what are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Well, oh -- oh, help. Oh, gosh. Oh, I think I -- oh, no. It's nothing. I thought I got something on my heel. But that's all right, I'm going to keep it. I'm going to keep it as a memento the day that I squashed you under my stiletto.",
        "Craig: Did anybody tell you about counting your chickens?",
        "Lucinda: Well, are we on chore rotation today? Wow, I think there's a reality series in the making here. And an opportunity for you to make wonderful new income.",
        "Craig: Are you finished?",
        "Lucinda: You know I won't be finished until the company is mine again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So Craig sent his little woman to fight his battle for him?",
        "Meg: It's not Craig's fight and you know it. This between you and me.",
        "Paul: Maybe you figured out that Craig's about to lose anything he ever had and so you're going to turn your back on him too.",
        "Meg: Is that what you want, Paul? I mean, if you don't love me, what do you care what Craig and I do?",
        "Paul: This is about paying Craig back for everything that he took from Rosanna.",
        "Meg: It's also about punishing me. I am so sorry I hurt you, Paul. But you're not sorry you hurt me, are you? As a matter of fact, you're pleased with yourself --",
        "Paul: How could I ever hurt you?",
        "Meg: How could you hurt me? You knew my heart was broken and you didn't even bother to tell me you were alive.",
        "Paul: You'd moved on.",
        "Meg: Because I thought that you were dead! You're the one who's moved in, just like that.",
        "Paul: That's right, I have.",
        "Meg: Why didn't you let me help you?",
        "Paul: Rosanna helped me.",
        "Meg: Rosanna was in a coma.",
        "Paul: She's not in a coma anymore.",
        "Meg: Okay. And you love her now?",
        "Paul: I've always loved Rosanna.",
        "Meg: Well, if that's true --",
        "Paul: That is true.",
        "Meg: Then why not forget about Craig and me? Why not leave us alone and be happy with the woman you say you love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Henry!",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Henry: Hey. Let me guess, Noah. I hear good things.",
        "Noah: Likewise.",
        "Henry: So, you are the reason my baby sis is staying in Oakdale.",
        "Noah: And you're the other reason.",
        "Henry: I like this guy already.",
        "Maddie: My brother has excellent taste.",
        "Noah: You know, I'm really sorry to meet and run, but they gave us like a 10-hour window for the dropping off the mattress and I should let the super know he's going to have to sign for it.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I can do that. Give you guys some time together.",
        "Henry: Actually, Maddie, would you mind sticking around? I'd like to talk to you about something.",
        "Maddie: Sure.",
        "Noah: Um, okay, I'll see you later. And it was really nice to meet you.",
        "Henry: Hey, you too. Take care, okay?",
        "Noah: You too.",
        "Maddie: Sorry -- sorry that was so quick. We need a plan to get together.",
        "Henry: Yeah, why didn't we do it sooner?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. You -- you do like him, though, right?",
        "Henry: Yeah. In the 10 seconds I talked to him. Sure. He's -- he's a lot different than this father.",
        "Maddie: That's a good thing.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: So what did you need to talk to me about?",
        "Henry: Well, I was thinking -- if you still want to go to Wesleyan. Vienna and I have the diner now, I think we can swing it.",
        "Maddie: You're not making any money at the diner yet.",
        "Henry: I know. I just want you to give up on your dreams just because I screwed up.",
        "Maddie: Dreams change. And I'm all registered for my classes here, and I found out that I might still be able to work at WOAK, which is fantastic. And it's probably too late to transfer now to Wesleyan anyway.",
        "Henry: Who are you trying to convince, Maddie? Me or yourself?",
        "Maddie: What's wrong, Henry? You said that Noah seemed nice. You don't like him, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Katie, of course I want to have a baby with you. It's not about you. Listen, when Carly took off, it was really hard for the kids. And I don't have to tell you that. But now that she's back, they're going through a little adjustment period. You and I getting married, that is absolutely huge, even if they are thrilled about it. But having a new -- having a newborn baby, I just think that -- it would make them feel a little displaced.",
        "Katie: I would never let that happen.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not saying that you would drop the ball in anyway. It's just jockeying back and forth from Carly's to the farm -- it's hard. And having a newborn baby, crying down the hall, it's just going to make things a little more -- disruptive. And now that we have J.J. back after the summer that he's had. I really -- I just don't want to rock the boat. Especially after he and Parker are finally getting along again.",
        "Katie: What about Sage? She wants a little sister so badly, she told me that she prays about it every night.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and last week she was praying for a puppy. Listen, Sage is finally back in school, she's independent. She's not in the little girl stage anymore. And I've got to tell you, I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back there just yet. I mean, don't you want -- don't you want to have time together to -- I don't know, travel and just be?",
        "Katie: Eventually.",
        "Jack: And adding another kid to the household, that's like triple the work they say.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but once you have that little baby in your arms, it's not going to feel like work. It's going to be another human being that you can love with your whole heart.",
        "Jack: I'm not saying never. I'm just saying -- I'm just saying not now. Can you live with that?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I want to marry you, Jack. But I want to make sure that I can eventually have your baby. This is just so hard. Oh, my God!",
        "Jack: What's going on, Carly? Did you follow us here?",
        "Carly: No. No, I was hired to decorate some of the apartments in this building. See?",
        "Jack: So, you being here is a total coincidence?",
        "Carly: Yes. Believe me -- the last place I want to be is in your way.",
        "Katie: Really? So, you were just here, and you heard us come in. What'd you do -- hide?",
        "Jack: Dizzy? Are you all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes. I just sat down just to rest, and the next thing I knew, I heard your voices. I must've fallen asleep.",
        "Jack: Right. And you decided that you were just going -- you were just going to lay there and eavesdrop?",
        "Carly: Honestly, I didn't know what to do.",
        "Katie: Oh, sure you did. You wanted to hear us fighting.",
        "Carly: No. Katie, I know you're embarrassed that I overheard anything, but believe me when I tell you that I'm the one who's completely mortified.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I had another little chat with Colonel Mayer.",
        "Maddie: Did you have your clothes on, this time?",
        "Henry: Yes. Actually, this time though, he was the one that was exposed.",
        "Maddie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean, he let slip some things that he didn't mean to. And I have to tell you, I don't like what he had to say.",
        "Maddie: Well, whatever he said, don't hold that against Noah.",
        "Henry: I don't. Here's the thing -- I get -- I get the definite impression that Colonel Mayer has a problem with gay people.",
        "Maddie: Really? Well, I'm not so surprised. He has those traditional family values.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah -- but doesn't that make you uncomfortable? I mean, what about Luke? You two are such good friends.",
        "Maddie: Yeah -- and Noah and Luke are really good friends, too. Just because the Colonel feels a certain way about something, doesn't mean that Noah does.",
        "Henry: Are you sure about that?",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Henry: It's just -- Colonel mayor made it very clear that he does not like the idea of Luke and Noah hanging out together.",
        "Maddie: Oh. And you're worried, because I am friends with both of them.",
        "Henry: Yeah --",
        "Maddie: What, Henry? What? This is like the time you had to tell me about my hamster dying. You made me play the longest game of \"20 questions\" ever, remember?",
        "Henry: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Maddie: Tell me what's on your mind.",
        "Henry: Okay. I -- get to the impression -- the distinct impression -- that the Colonel is afraid there's something going on between Luke and Noah.",

        "Lucinda: I'm sure Rosanna was absolutely thrilled to own an international conglomerate she has no use for, and absolutely thrilled that you had installed the new Ms. Montgomery at the helm. Won't take her long to find out Meg is intent on liquidating the hard-earned assets, systematically.",
        "Craig: Why do you think Rosanna's going to hand the corporation back to you?",
        "Lucinda: I think she'd give it to me for a song. Just for the pleasure. Seeing how it would gall you, that poor woman. Poor woman, two years stolen from her life.",
        "Craig: For which I am not to blame.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, nobody, nobody in the whole world would believe that. Least of all, the present Mrs. Montgomery, who married you for your money that you no longer have. How long do you think, before she ditches you, hmm?",
        "Craig: You know what, there is not an ounce of mercenary in her. I know you would find that impossible to understand.",
        "Lucinda: And you love her for it, don't you?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, well then, if you love her, if you were true about that, then you would set her free, so that she could find a man with a future. Because when Rosanna remembers what you did, you're going straight to jail. And they do not allow conjugal visits. Not when it's attempted murder charge.",

        "Paul: So, I'm just supposed to live my life with the woman that I love, while you live in her house, and spend all of her money?",
        "Meg: Of course not.",
        "Paul: So, what do you want me to do?",
        "Meg: Be honest, for one thing. If you're so blissfully happy with the woman you love, where is she now?",
        "Paul: Rosanna's busy. She's got, like, a thousand things to do, to get herself declared uncomatose.",
        "Meg: Can you just explain to me how this happened? I mean, you were presumed dead. Rosanna was in a coma. You crossed the globe, you both miraculously recovered, and now, suddenly you're proclaiming your love and planning a future together?",
        "Paul: Suddenly? What, too sudden? That's quite an accusation coming from a woman who changes partners about as often as you do.",
        "Meg: Does that help, to convince you that never really loved me?",
        "Paul: The whole time I was with you, I convinced myself that I saw something that was never there.",
        "Meg: Well, that doesn't say a lot about you as a person. And I know what kind of person you are, Paul. You're not cruel. You're caring and you're loyal and you're fair. That's why I loved you. That's why I still love you. And I know, the more you talk to me like that, the more I know you still love me too.",
        "Paul: You're a married woman.",
        "Meg: What if I weren't? Would that make a difference?",

        "Craig: Rosanna can have Paul.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. No, no -- no, no. Meggie wants him. Meggie wants him. I saw him go over the cliff. You were there too. We both saw it. We saw with our own eyes, all that grieving. Now you can't expect a girl to go through all that and then just to turn around, roll over and move on to the next psychopath. These are feelings. These are feeling that have to be dealt with.",
        "Craig: They have been. He has shown his true colors.",
        "Lucinda: So you're not afraid? Not one little tiny bit? That maybe Meg and Paul will get together for a little tryst and a little nookie?",

        "Lucinda: You're sure?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: Just as sure as you were when she seduced you into marrying her under false pretenses? Rosanna's out of town, I think. Isn't she? Where is Meggie right now?",
        "Craig: Get out. Get out.",

        "Meg: I am not pretending. But I think you are.",
        "Paul: Me? Wh -- how?",
        "Meg: If my marriage to Craig sent you running back to Rosanna, then I'm the reason you guys are together, right? So if you are so happy to be reunited with your true love -- you should be grateful to me. You should be thrilled. But instead, you're determined to punish me.",
        "Paul: I don't need to punish you. You just signed on for a lifetime with Craig.",
        "Meg: What about Craig? Why are you so hell-bent on getting him away from me by sending him to jail for a crime he didn't commit?",
        "Paul: He didn't? Are you sure? Are you positive, Meg? His last wife was in a coma for two years. Do you want that to happen to you?",
        "Meg: Do you?",

        "Maddie: I may not have the best track record with guys, and you were just saying that Noah and I were moving too quickly. Now you're trying to tell me --",
        "Henry: Forget it, forget it. Forget I ever brought it up. I'm sorry. Hey, forget it. I've never been so happy to be wrong about anything. And I often am wrong.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, no kidding. Must run in the family.",
        "Henry: Okay. Hey, you're staying in Oakdale. Lucky me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, and me.",
        "Henry: How's the move going?",
        "Maddie: We're okay. We're okay. Noah's father gave us some money for furniture. I umm -- feel really weird taking money from him --",

        "Jack: The things that keep happening like this, Carly, for whatever the reason -- yeah, it is a problem.",
        "Carly: That's why I didn't want you to know I was here. Because I knew, Jack, that you would think that I was stalking you -- and you would make me feel pathetic. Which, God knows, I do -- even though I know I haven't done anything to be ashamed of.",
        "Jack: And neither have we. So don't try to make us feel guilty, please.",
        "Carly: All I wanted to do today was get a job, so I can support my children and set a good example. I did not mean to hear what I heard.",

        "Carly: Katie, I'm sorry if you want me to think that you're a couple that never fights. But that's what people do sometimes when they love each other. They fight. And Jack does love you. Anyone can see that. Even me.",

        "Katie: I don't just want a baby, Jack. It's like a biological drive.",
        "Jack: I understand. Katie, I understand. You dreamt about having a baby like you dreamt about your wedding day. Seeing the blue line on the stick, putting together the nursery -- hearing the heartbeat on the monitor, I understand.",
        "Katie: And I understand it's different for a guy.",
        "Jack: No, hey, I had the guy version of those dreams, too. It's just that hey, reality, that was completely different for me. J.J. and Parker, they came into my life in not exactly the traditional way. And Sage -- well, she wasn't born without drama. You were there, you know the story.",
        "Katie: I know, I know things don't always happen the way you think they will. When I dreamt about my wedding, I didn't think I'd be doing it more than once. But I did know that I would marry a man as wonderful as you.",
