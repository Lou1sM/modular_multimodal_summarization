    "Transcript": [
        "Tom: I love your brother, and I accepted his death, but that doesn't mean I never stopped missing him, and by God, you know that I always kept wondering, as a father, what I could have done differently to change the way things turned out.",
        "Casey: Adam screwed up. It's not your fault.",
        "Tom: So, now I have another chance with him. But, you see, he stole a person's identity, and he came to this town under false pretenses, and that's fraud, but that's not the worst part. See, he forced your mother to help him.",
        "Casey: I don't think he forced her.",
        "Tom: Okay. He knew that she loved him too much to turn him in, and she knew that you loved her too much to do it either.",
        "Casey: Maybe.",
        "Tom: So, Adam says that he's changed, he's ready to be a good man. But you know what? Those are just words, and as long as he keeps skirting his responsibilities there, they're just going to be words he can't live up to.",
        "Casey: So you're going to turn him in?",
        "Tom: If it was just about Adam, I think so, but now he has your mom and you on the hook for aiding and abetting. So, do I follow my principles and say, \"Look, if you break the law, you take your punishment and do your time, no matter how harsh it is\"? Or do I throw all that out the window and just try to preserve what's left of my family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: I'm really sorry that I lied to you.",
        "Alison: Just to me? Because you also lied to Casey, Margo, Tom, your sick grandfather, and your grandmother.",
        "Riley: I'm sorry about all of it, okay? I'm -- I'm a screw-up. Nothing new there. But not everything I said was a lie.",
        "Alison: Well, how do I tell the difference?",
        "Riley: You know what? Fine. You can believe me or not, but I swear, Alison, I meant every word I said about wanting to live a better life.",
        "Alison: Whose?",
        "Riley: What?",
        "Alison: Whose life are you planning to lead, Riley Morgan's or Adam Munson's? Because if you stay Riley, I mean, that kind of cancels out the whole good thing. If you go back to being Adam, you got a hell of a lot to make up for.",
        "Riley: Don't you think I know that?",
        "Alison: Well, knowing it and doing something about it are two very different things.",
        "Riley: I'm trying to apologize!",
        "Alison: Your apology is bogus! It means nothing!",
        "Riley: No. In the past, maybe, but I have changed.",
        "Alison: The only thing that's changed is your face. The rest of you is as messed up as you always were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I want to pull out all the stops. I want every hors d'oeuvre that you and your little elves can whip up before this afternoon.",
        "Caterer: We're grateful for the business, Mr. Ryan --",
        "Paul: But?",
        "Caterer: Perhaps you might want to have a slightly more discreet reception, given that your guests are coming from a funeral.",
        "Paul: No. I don't want discreet. I want over-the-top celebration.",
        "Caterer: Oh, I see. You want to honor your father's life.",
        "Paul: Honor him? No. James Stenbeck was my father. I'm thrilled that he's dead. I want happy food and happy wine. I want fireworks.",
        "Caterer: Caviar and fireworks. Yes, Sir.",
        "Emily: Whoever that was, she looked like she just saw a ghost. What's going on?",
        "Paul: Caterer.",
        "Emily: Caterer? What? For what?",
        "Paul: Today we put James in the ground, and then we dance on his grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You think a black armband would be too much?",
        "Vienna: Don't go overboard with it.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm about to inherit my father's entire estate. I need to look suitably grief-stricken. Anything else would be unseemly.",
        "Vienna: Your obsession with James' money is the only thing that is unseemly. You promised me, Henry, once the will is read and you get the money, you give it all to Audrey, right?",
        "Henry: Yeah. When you say \"All\" --",
        "Vienna: Every single penny! It's the only way we can get rid of her, and, quite frankly, I can't live with you anymore with you being under her influence.",
        "Henry: Oh, Sweetie, you don't mean that. You don't mean that.",
        "Vienna: I do. I do. You have to make a choice. The money and your mother or you and me and the way we used to be.",
        "Henry: Oh, Baby. I choose you, always.",
        "Vienna: Oh God!",
        "Henry: Always.",
        "Vienna: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Well, you look remarkably well.",
        "Lawyer: For someone who spent days in a laundry hamper.",
        "Audrey: Oh. No hard feelings? Come on! I really truly wasn't going to hurt you. I'm not that kind of girl.",
        "Lawyer: And by \"Girl,\" you mean \"Kidnapper\"?",
        "Audrey: Shh, shh, shh, shh! Listen, you are getting quite a bundle for your time and trouble. That's the deal. Remember, after the funeral, after the will is read, Henry will give me the money, and you, you're going to get your share.",
        "Lawyer: Are you sure Henry will come through?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, I'm positive. Leave my son to me, and tonight you and I are going to go to bed a whole lot richer than when we woke up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: James was killed on your watch, and now your department is covering it up.",
        "Margo: We are doing no such thing.",
        "Barbara: There are far more people that wanted him dead than alive, and some of them were conveniently very nearby when he had his fatal heart attack, and if I don't call that a suspicious death, I don't know what is.",
        "Margo: I agree.",
        "Barbara: Then why was there no autopsy?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I took a personal day yesterday. But I will look in to it.",
        "Barbara: Then you agree with me that there should be official confirmation of death?",
        "Margo: Yes, I agree with you, and if there's any foul play involved --",
        "Barbara: Oh, there was. Of course there was.",
        "Margo: We will find out who is responsible, and they will be arrested.",
        "Barbara: If it's not too late.",
        "Margo: Excuse me. Margo Hughes, Oakdale P.D. uh, there's been an error. James Steinbeck's body was released to you before an autopsy could be performed, so we need you to send the remains back to the medical examiner's office right away, please.",
        "Barbara: Don't tell me.",
        "Margo: What? Is there a problem?",
        "Funeral director: Well, I'm afraid Mr. Stenbeck was embalmed this morning.",
        "Margo: I don't suppose you kept a sample of any bodily fluids? Damn.",
        "Barbara: The man was barely dead. Since when do you work so quickly?",
        "Funeral director: It was a special request from his son, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Henry, it's time.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry.",
        "Vienna: Yeah. Things will never be the same as long as she's here in Oakdale.",
        "Audrey: You know, I really think we should all go to the funeral together as a family, and that way we present a united front, not to mention the fact that then we can all be together for the reading of the will.",
        "Henry: What? They're reading the will today?",
        "Audrey: Yes. Why wait?",
        "Vienna: Oh, by all means. Let's get it over with, in case he wakes up again.",
        "Audrey: No. That's not going to happen. Not this time.",
        "Vienna: No. You would know.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. All right. Let's just -- we got a funeral to go to, all right?",
        "Audrey: It's just so sad. You know, I just got my Jimmy back, and just to lose him again.",
        "Henry: Oh, don't waste your crocodile tears on us, please. You didn't lose him. You dispatched him, and he was trying to pin it on me.",
        "Audrey: Yeah, that was a mistake.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I'll say.",
        "Henry: Okay, you know what? Let's just have a truce until after the funeral. Is that okay?",
        "Vienna: I'm not promising anything.",
        "Audrey: Okay. I am going to be on my best behavior. I promise.",
        "Vienna: So, who's paying for all of this, anyway? Because just because Henry is James' son doesn't mean he owes him anything.",
        "Audrey: No worries. Big brother Paul is going to pay for the whole thing. You know, he's paying for the tombstone and the casket. In fact, he actually invited all of us over to a little reception at Fairwinds. It's very considerate of him, considering James didn't leave him a dime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What were you thinking, having James embalmed?",
        "Paul: Champagne?",
        "Barbara: To celebrate what? You may have just ruined any chance you had of getting your father's money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: Alison, I didn't do it to hurt anybody.",
        "Alison: It was still dishonest.",
        "Riley: I know. Okay, I know, and I hated it, but every time I tried to talk to my mom about taking the rap for what I did, she begged me not to.",
        "Alison: Is that your excuse?",
        "Riley: No. Okay, no. But it's the reason I kept lying. I couldn't break her heart again.",
        "Alison: So, it's just by coincidence that by staying Riley Morgan you also saved your own hide? I mean, that's the truth of it, isn't it? Because if this were just about making your mother happy, you could have come back as yourself, faced the consequences of what you did to Maddie and Gwen. You know your mom and dad would have gotten you a killer defense attorney, and who knows? You might not even had to do time. But, personally, I think you deserve the max.",
        "Riley: Well, you can't serve on my jury, then.",
        "Alison: What jury? Adam Munson's a fugitive. You have reinvented yourself as Riley Morgan, war hero.",
        "Riley: Yeah, and I wish I hadn't. Okay, I just want to be Adam again.",
        "Alison: You still can. It's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I did what any normal next of kin would do. I called the funeral home, and I ordered a box for dead dad and a hole to put him in. It's all over but the shoveling, Mother.",
        "Barbara: If you hadn't been so hasty, there would have been an autopsy, and the police would have found out that Audrey killed your father, most likely with Henry's help, and you would have had the entire inheritance coming to you.",
        "Paul: I don't care how he died. I'm just glad that he did. I want to make sure that he stays dead. So I called the funeral director, and I told him to start the embalming ASAP.",
        "Barbara: Your paranoia erased any evidence of foul play.",
        "Emily: He doesn't care, Barbara!",
        "Barbara: You should have made him care, Emily! He sacrificed his entire future here!",
        "Paul: There's no sacrifice involved, believe me. Henry is welcome to the money, and he's welcome to the Stenbeck name, if he dares. I'm over it.",
        "Barbara: Just like that?",
        "Paul: No, not just like that. It's taken me years. It's taken me my entire life to get over it. But now that it's finally here, I'm going to enjoy every moment of it.",
        "Barbara: We suffered for years at your father's hand. I'm not going to walk away without anything for it.",
        "Emily: So, what are you going to do, steal the cufflinks off the body?",
        "Paul: Better get there before Audrey does.",
        "Barbara: You know, Audrey thinks that Jimmy's death is her own personal cash box, but she's not going to get away with it without a fight. She won't know what hit her.",
        "Emily: To James Stenbeck, the gift that keeps on giving.",
        "Paul: No. Unh-unh. From now on, that's Henry's problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: I'm -- I'm the widow Stenbeck. Well, technically, I'm not, but in our hearts, we really were.",
        "Henry: Ignore her.",
        "Audrey: And this is James' son, the one he actually liked. What are you doing?",
        "Henry: What do you think I'm doing? It's not like he hasn't risen from the dead before.",
        "Vienna: Well, he looks extremely dead to me.",
        "Audrey: Well, you know what? You never can be too sure. Let's just get the show on the road, shall we?",
        "Funeral director: Will there be any other mourners?",
        "Barbara: We're not mourners, but we're here.",
        "Paul: Is that him?",
        "Funeral director: I certainly hope so.",
        "Paul: Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke? It's funny. It is. I certainly hope so, too. All right. Let's make sure the old guy's really dead.",
        "Emily: Yeah. He's serious.",
        "Emily: Excuse me. Yeah. He's definitely not breathing.",
        "Paul: He's really dead this time.",
        "Emily: How you feel?",
        "Paul: Like doing something completely inappropriate. You want to join me?",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Emily: You bet.",
        "Audrey: Oh. Doesn't he look so handsome?",
        "Funeral director: Would anyone like to share a memory of the departed?",
        "Paul: I guess not. Let's put the old guy in the ground.",
        "Audrey: Oh, Jimmy! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy! My Jimmy! Oh, baby!",
        "[Audrey crying]",
        "Audrey: Oh, Jimmy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey. Wow, you look as bad as I feel.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I didn't get much sleep last night.",
        "Alison: How's your mom?",
        "Casey: She was a hermit in her room all night, but I could hear her crying. She went to work before me and my dad got up. My dad's torn up about the whole thing, too.",
        "Alison: What are they going to do?",
        "Casey: Nothing. Either we turn him in, which means sending me and my mom to jail, or we keep lying, pretend my brother is a complete stranger.",
        "Alison: Is your dad okay with that?",
        "Casey: No. No, he's a wreck. He just doesn't want to send me and my mom to prison.",
        "Alison: Thank goodness.",
        "Casey: Yeah, tell me about it. I'm just -- I'm just, like, worried about him. I don't think he can handle living a lie. He's not built that way.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I don't know what I would do if I was in your dad's shoes. I'd probably have a hard time staying sober.",
        "Casey: I just don't think my parents' marriage can take it.",
        "Alison: Oh, they'll be all right. They'll figure it out. They both love Adam. That's -- that's got to bring them together.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but my mom is in denial. She's decided that he's paid for his crimes with all the pain he went through in Afghanistan. Now she wants a big, happy family with -- with a stranger named Riley. I just hate it. I hate all of it.",
        "Alison: He came to see me earlier.",
        "Casey: Adam? Why?",
        "Alison: To apologize. I know. I told him to forget it and that it wouldn't help.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I don't think anything will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: I knew you wouldn't rat me out, Mom. That's why I told you the truth. Let's face it, I mean, that was selfish.",
        "Margo: You know what? I don't want to hear this. No more, okay? Listen, when I thought that I would never see you again, I didn't know if I could get through the rest of my life, but here you are.",
        "Riley: I can't have you lying for me anymore.",
        "Margo: It's my choice. I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Riley: It's not like I'm going to be in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Margo: Hmm?",
        "Riley: Even if I have to do time, we'll still be together. We can talk. You can come visit me.",
        "Margo: No!",
        "Riley: I made a huge mistake, but I still have the time to make up for this. I need to do this, Mom! If I can't set the record straight, how can I live with myself?",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Riley: I'm turning myself in.",
        "[Margo gasping]",
        "Margo: You cannot confess. Now, I have spent months covering up the truth.",
        "Casey: And look at the toll it's taken. Our family is being ripped apart.",
        "Margo: Okay, so it's been hard, but Tom knows the truth now, and I think, between the four of us, we can get through this.",
        "Riley: Dad's not a liar.",
        "Margo: Oh, and Casey and I are?",
        "Riley: You know that's not what I meant.",
        "Margo: Listen, listen. Your father is just -- he's in shock now, and it's going to take time, but I think that he and Casey are going to come around and move on with this.",
        "Riley: Mom, you're fooling yourself!",
        "Margo: Well, then, let me! I have you back. This is a mother's miracle come true. You can't make me lose you again.",
        "Riley: That's just it, Mom. You don't have me. All right, I can't be Adam, and I am not Riley Morgan. How am I supposed to go through life without an identity?",
        "Margo: It's a name! Come on, it's a name, a rose by any other color!",
        "Riley: What about my friends, my career, my past? I can't own any of those things! I'm just over here, floating! The only thing I'm capable of is breaking our family apart. That's not a life. It's an existence, and that's not good enough for me.",
        "Margo: You? What about the rest of us? I mean, if you come forward with this, this implicates Casey and me. Casey will be in violation of his parole, and I will be kicked off the force.",
        "Riley: I will not let that happen.",
        "Margo: Well, the only way to avoid that is to stick with the plan that we've got!",
        "Riley: No, there is another way, all right? But you're going to have to lie for me one more time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Jimmy, come back! Oh, my Jimmy!",
        "[Audrey crying]",
        "Barbara: What are you crying about? You killed him!",
        "Audrey: Hey! Don't you touch the merchandise!",
        "Barbara: Hey!",
        "Audrey: Oh, you want some more? Come on!",
        "Henry: Enough. There's a dead body here.",
        "Paul: Bro, relax. Pop loved a good catfight.",
        "Audrey: You do not besmirch my Jimmy's good name.",
        "Barbara: At least slander's not fatal.",
        "Audrey: I happened to love that man with all my heart. You wouldn't know about that, because you don't have a heart, do you? What do you run? How do you stay alive? Batteries?",
        "Barbara: You only love James' money, not him.",
        "Audrey: Ah, no. I also loved him in bed. He was the best. We could go at it hour after hour.",
        "Henry: For the love of God, Mother, are we to be spared nothing?",
        "Audrey: Oh, Henry, stop being so fussy! I have seen your costume collection, right, Sister Vienna?",
        "Emily: That's what does it for you, Henry? Nuns?",
        "Paul: Oh, nuns are hot.",
        "Barbara: Paul.",
        "Paul: It's true!",
        "Audrey: You know, if you two boys had only inherited half the talent in the bedroom that your dad had --",
        "Henry: Oh, my God! Make it stop, please!",
        "Audrey: Come on, ladies. You know what I'm talking about.",
        "Vienna: I never slept with James!",
        "Audrey: Well, that is a shame. Emily, come on. Go ahead. Tell her all about him.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you drag me into this. I'm here to support Paul.",
        "Paul: Okay. Enough reminiscing. The caterer's waiting.",
        "Audrey: Oh, come on. Come on. You come say good-bye. Say a proper good-bye to your daddy. Say it.",
        "Henry: What do you want me to do, kiss him?",
        "Audrey: Say it! Come on!",
        "Barbara: This is enough, all right?",
        "Audrey: You really want to fight, don't you?",
        "Barbara: Bring it, bitch.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. No bringing! No bringing!",
        "[Women screaming]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Riley: I'll come forward, confess to stealing Riley Morgan's identity, admit to hiding the truth from everyone.",
        "Margo: It is not as simple as that, because in the eyes of the law, when you chose to come back as Riley Morgan, you did it to cover up for the crimes that Adam Munson had committed. And, so, now you are going to have to answer to every charge in the book!",
        "Riley: Then I will take my punishment! All right, but you have to pretend that you never knew who I was.",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Riley: I know it's hard, Mom, but it is the only way. As much as I hate living a lie, I will not be responsible for you losing your job or your freedom. I have cost you so much already.",
        "Margo: I don't care! I'm not going to lose you again!",
        "Riley: You won't. All right, you know where I'll be.",
        "Margo: In prison!",
        "Riley: At least we can see each other, unless we both go to jail, which is exactly why that can't happen, Mom. It can't.",
        "Margo: All right, Riley. If I do agree to this, what about Tom? What about Casey?",
        "Riley: They'll say that this is the best possible solution. We need to do this now, Mom, before I lose my nerve.",
        "Margo: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Women grunting]",
        "Henry: All right, all right!",
        "[Others shouting]",
        "Henry: Come on! Come on! Paul, what do we do now?",
        "Paul: I guess we bury the guy!",
        "Emily: Maybe we should put a stake in his heart just to make sure.",
        "Barbara: Does that thing lock from the outside? I think we're good.",
        "Henry: Are you coming?",
        "Audrey: Yeah. Just give me a minute to freshen up. It's show time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Officer Carlton, would you come in here, please? This is my son, Adam Munson. He has a federal warrant out for him. Would you please place him under arrest?",
        "Carlton: But, Chief --",
        "Margo: Would you please just do it? Oh, what happened to our son? I'm just really kind of glad that you're not here to have to go through all of this. Oh, Hal. He's got such a good heart inside of him. So much good. I know, I know. I'm going to have to do everything I can to make sure he gets a chance to show it. I just hope it's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: To the demise of James Stenbeck.",
        "Barbara: To the end of the reign of terror. When I think back, everything James did to me all of these years, how he gas lighted me, he drugged me, had me locked up in an insane asylum. I could go on and on. But the worst thing that he did was try to make my son hate me, and yet here we are. We're all together, and he's dead, soon to be forgotten.",
        "Paul: Right. Selective amnesia.",
        "Emily: I tried for a really long time to get James out of my mind, but sometimes if I ate a little too much before bedtime, I'd have dreams of him choking the life out of me. I swear, if you hadn't shot him, he would have killed me.",
        "Paul: I should have aimed higher.",
        "Vienna: What, you shot your own father?",
        "Paul: Are you kidding? In my family, that's like bonding. He's tried to kill me. He set me up for murder. He's pitted me against my mother for my entire life, and don't forget, when he couldn't take me out, he had a microchip installed in my brain. He figured, if he couldn't kill me, he could get me to destroy my own life, and then, when the doctors finally took it out, everything was empty. He couldn't kill me. He had me erased.",
        "Emily: It was temporary.",
        "Paul: Dad, if you're listening -- thanks for messing with my head. I've never been happier.",
        "Henry: I thought my mother was bad.",
        "Vienna: Where is Audrey, anyway?",
        "Barbara: Miss her?",
        "Vienna: No, but she said she was right behind us.",
        "Audrey: Gather 'round. Kids, time to read the will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Your mom is here.",
        "Casey: Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Margo: Alison, could you excuse us, please? I need to talk to Casey alone for a minute.",
        "Alison: Of course.",
        "Casey: If this is about Adam, she knows. He and I told her, you know, the same day you told Dad.",
        "Margo: Really? Okay. Well, in that case, then you do need to be part of this conversation. Thank you. Your brother came in to the station and turned himself in. He's under arrest.",
        "Casey: Are you okay?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Casey: No? You got to be a little relieved that we're not lying anymore.",
        "Margo: You know what? Right now I just want to concentrate on doing everything I can to protect your brother.",
        "Casey: Okay. I don't mean to sound selfish, but what about us? Are we in trouble for keeping this a secret?",
        "Margo: Well, as long as we keep our mouths shut, we're okay. Adam is going to claim that nobody knew the truth. That's the way he wants it.",
        "Casey: Good for him, for once.",
        "Margo: Would you please? Don't do that. He didn't have to do this, you know, and I was prepared to spend the rest of my life protecting him, and you and your father would have done the same thing, no matter how hard it was. But Adam didn't want to put us through that.",
        "Casey: Or himself.",
        "Alison: Casey.",
        "Margo: He's right. He's right. Underneath it all, Adam couldn't live with the lie any more than we could. So he's taking responsibility for his actions, and he's let us off the hook.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: What happened?",
        "Riley: You and Mom were at each other's throats, and Casey hated me more than normal. Lying just wasn't worth it anymore.",
        "Tom: Did you make a statement?",
        "Riley: Not yet. You were right, Dad. I can never be a good man unless I'm willing to own up to the worst things I've done. Be the same jerk with a different label.",
        "Tom: Does your mother know?",
        "Riley: Yeah, but I'm going to cover for her and Casey. I put them in an impossible situation. They shouldn't have to pay for that. I can't keep them out of trouble if you won't help me. I know it's a hell of a lot to ask.",
        "Tom: You put this family between a rock and a hard place. Now there's several ways to play this. Nobody wins.",
        "Riley: I was stupid and thoughtless, and I'm sorry, but we're here now. All right, I've tried to think of some other way of coming clean without you having to lie for me, but it's impossible. This is the least bad lie I can think of. It is all my fault. I'm willing to take all the blame. Will you help me?",
        "Tom: I don't have an answer for you right now.",
        "Riley: Dad. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hansen: I leave my estate to my illegitimate son, Henry Coleman.",
        "Henry: Yes! This is so unexpected.",
        "Barbara: It is criminal, and it won't hold up in court!",
        "Paul: There won't be any court. Henry, you're welcome to the money. I hope you enjoy it. Best of luck.",
        "Vienna: We have all the luck we need, don't we?",
        "Audrey: That is so sweet.",
        "Henry: We have so much to talk about, Sweetheart. We have a lot to talk about.",
        "Audrey: Oh, wait a minute. Hang on. We have a lot to talk about, too!",
        "Hansen: Ditto!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, Mother. Let it rip.",
        "Barbara: You know what? In times like this, I wish you had a little bit more of your father in you.",
        "Emily: What a horrible thing to say!",
        "Paul: The curse of the Stenbeck millions.",
        "Barbara: What did Henry ever do for James except perhaps kill him?",
        "Paul: Public service, if you ask me.",
        "Barbara: Would you just wake up? This is the second time that your father has cheated you out of your inheritance, and he didn't do it because he wants to make Henry or Dusty's life any easier. He's trying to make you suffer.",
        "Paul: Well, he failed. Cut it out, Mom. The money is just not important to me.",
        "Barbara: Really? What is?",
        "Paul: Emily.",
        "Emily: Play nice or we'll make you sit next to Audrey at the wedding.",
        "Paul: Did I hear you correctly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You don't have to lie anymore, Casey. Why aren't you happy?",
        "Casey: Is it me, or even after everything he's done, Adam still comes out looking like the hero? I mean, he ran out on the family. He broke my mom's heart, and even after he confesses under pressure, it's like he's doing all of us some favor.",
        "Alison: I understand why you might see it that way, but I really think he heard what we were telling him. I mean, he's trying to make up for what he did.",
        "Casey: He can't. It's too late.",
        "Alison: Well, he's going to prison, Casey.",
        "Casey: We'll see. You know, he's so slick, I wouldn't be surprised if he got off without doing any time at all.",
        "Alison: That's not going to happen.",
        "Casey: Whatever. If we all agreed to keep this quiet, it already split up our family so much. I'm just scared it's going to be permanent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know?",
        "Tom: Saw Adam at the police station. I know what has to be done.",
        "Margo: Well, it's not perfect, but it's a justice of sorts, isn't it?",
        "Tom: So, you all right?",
        "Margo: I don't want my son to go to prison, but at least he's alive, and I'll know where he is. I can go and see him.",
        "Tom: And what about us?",
        "Margo: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "Tom: Well, we've lied to each other before. Not often, but it's always turned out badly, and there's only so much that one person can do without shutting down.",
        "Margo: It wasn't an attack.",
        "Tom: You didn't trust me.",
        "Margo: I have always trusted you to do the right thing, but with this, I need you to do the wrong thing.",
        "Tom: And what did you expect?",
        "Margo: I expected -- I thought, I hoped, that you would be happy that Adam was alive. I mean, after all, Tom, you did raise him as your own son, and, yes, he went through this nightmare of a period where he made one horrific choice after the other, but then does that just make him Hal's son? Do you love him any less now?",
        "Tom: Of course not. Sometimes I think I probably love him a little more, but this is a complicated situation.",
        "Margo: And I hated lying to you, but losing Adam was so painful, I just wanted my son back.",
        "Tom: Riley Morgan was not our son.",
        "Margo: He was to me. Now, I know that I have made mistakes. I know that, but it's over now, and I know that Adam is going away again. I think that's a big enough price to pay. Don't you? Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you two going?",
        "Henry: Home.",
        "Audrey: Uh, no. We have unsettled business.",
        "Vienna: Oh, please. Henry just buried his father.",
        "Audrey: Oh, good grief! Don't give me that sob story. You both hated Jimmy.",
        "Henry: We don't have the money yet, Mother. It was a will, not an atm.",
        "Audrey: Okay. No problemo. Let's see, let's see. I'll go get some stationery out of the desk, and then you can draw up a sworn statement, telling me you're going to give me all of it free and clear. You pay me, I pay the lawyer, I get lost, quick and dirty.",
        "Henry: No, no. My money, my terms. I give you enough to take care of the lawyer, and then you can take care of Ray Zuma, and then we'll see.",
        "Vienna: No! We won't see! You told Audrey she would get it all. \"All\" means all, the whole amount, Henry. Please don't tell me you're changing your mind.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no! Sweetie, no! I'm having second thoughts, that's all.",
        "Audrey: Second thoughts? You were born. That is it. I did all the real work.",
        "Henry: I wouldn't advertise that if I were you.",
        "Audrey: Oh, son. So, you want to fight, is that it? Okay. I'll tell you what, you go to the police, and you tell them that I killed Jimmy. Well, there's no evidence. It's your word against me. By the way, that's automatic reasonable doubt.",
        "Henry: Maybe I kept the murder syringe.",
        "Audrey: You wouldn't dare.",
        "Henry: No. Henry Coleman wouldn't, but Henry Stenbeck, that's a whole other matter. I would count your lucky stars there, Mom, okay? You don't have to run from Ray anymore, but if I were you, I'd skip town before Barbara figures out a way to charge you with murder.",
        "Audrey: Oh, son, you know you're not going to get rid of me that easily.",
        "Henry: Come on.",
        "Vienna: No! You said you were choosing me, not the money!",
        "Henry: I'm choosing both, Sweetheart! Look, it's just money, Liebchen. It's a means to an end. Why can't we give Audrey enough to satisfy her and then keep the rest for ourselves?",
        "Vienna: No, because Audrey won't be satisfied until she gets it all, and until then, she is going to make every single day of our lives a nightmare, which is why I said the money is cursed. We got to get rid of it, otherwise it's going to ruin our lives.",
        "Paul: You told my mother that you were planning a wedding.",
        "Emily: Hmm?",
        "Paul: Did you mean it?",
        "Emily: Yeah. It just sort of slipped out.",
        "Paul: Okay. Did you mean it?",
        "Emily: I'm not sure.",
        "Paul: Okay. Let's say, for argument's sake, that you did mean it. Why now?",
        "Emily: Because. Because I was so impressed with you today.",
        "Paul: You were impressed with me?",
        "Emily: Yes, I was impressed with you, because you could have gone after James' money and all the power that went along with it, but you didn't. You weren't even tempted. You just walked away. I loved that.",
        "Paul: No. Chicks love money. Chicks love power.",
        "Emily: Been there, done that. With you, actually. Among others. It's not worth it.",
        "Paul: So, what's worth it?",
        "Emily: Someone I can trust.",
        "Paul: Oh, trustworthy. Wow. I've been accused of a lot of things. Trust worthy's not among them.",
        "Emily: Yeah. You know what? If you had asked me a month ago, no way, but today, right now, definitely. I trust you, Paul. And, you know, doesn't hurt that no one turns me on like you do, so --",
        "Paul: So you'll marry me.",
        "Emily: Do you think we can -- can we do it better this time around?",
        "Paul: James is dead. It's a whole new world.",
        "Emily: Okay. So, the curse is over. I will marry you.",
