        "Bonnie promised Sarah that even if she had to live with Marshall, he wouldn't keep Bonnie out of her life. She told a frantic Marshall that she would tell him where the girl was in exchange for shared custody. He refused, and ordered Hal to arrest her for kidnapping. Meanwhile, Jessica discovered the girl hiding in her apartment. After talking through her fears, she convinced Sarah to give living with Marshall a try. Jen showed Dusty, Rosanna, and Craig the proof that Craig had made the 911 call that got the club raided; he admits his guilt. She demanded an apology from Dusty, insisting she really does like him. He said she just needs to stay away. Rosanna was furious and hurt, but said that Craig could make things better by giving up the club. When he begged her not to make him give it up, she said she would just pull her money, instead. Overhearing this, Dusty threatened to beat up Craig. Barbara told Paul that she knew he had paid off Andre to set her up, and threatened to tell Jen. Paul tried to call Andre, then had a drink with Rosanna. Barbara went to see Jen, and told her that Paul is not all that he seems."

    "Transcript": [
        "Marshall: What about the bus stations? Have you shown Sarah's picture around the bus stations?",
        "Hal: One of the first places we looked. We're checking every departure point from Oakdale, including the airports. We're also checking CD stores, video arcades, malls -- places a 15-year-old girl might go. Now, if you can think of any other places Sarah might like to hang out, you will please let us know.",
        "Jessica: Faith and patience is what you need right now.",
        "Marshall: I wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for Bonnie.",
        "Jessica: Look, Bonnie may be impulsive, but she's not a fool. She'd never risk the legal consequences of hiding Sarah, no matter how much she loves her.",
        "Marshall: She disapproves of me being Sarah's father. She'll do anything she can to keep her as far away from me as possible, and you're probably helping her.",
        "Jessica: There's no conspiracy at work here, Marshall . Sarah probably ran away because her life is about to change drastically, and she's scared.",
        "Marshall: Yeah, well -- she's not the only one.",
        "Jessica: Look, Hal will find her. And until then, just -- just be grateful that she knows the streets. Her chances of survival are better than most runaways.",
        "Marshall: I'm gonna check and see if there's any news.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie? It's your mother. Pick up if you're there. I need to talk to you right away. Call me on my cell. I'm at the police station, with Marshall . If you know where Sarah is, you have to come forward. This is important.",
        "Sarah: You don't want me to hear that?",
        "Bonnie: I don't want you to worry.",
        "Sarah: Bonnie, are you going to get in trouble for letting me stay here?",
        "Bonnie: Me, in trouble? I'm a duchess, remember. If anyone gives me any problems, I just say, \"off with their heads.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: May I come in?",
        "Paul: You know, ordinarily, that would be a terrific idea, but I am incredibly busy. I have to go now and soak a comb.",
        "Barbara: Oh, well, while you're doing that, why don't you think about how betrayed your sister is going to feel when she finds out that you have betrayed her. That's right, Paulie. Mama knows all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I have proof that Craig was the person who called 911.",
        "Dusty: Why would he blow the horn on himself, along with his partner?",
        "Jennifer: This is a log of calls to 911 the day that you guys got arrested. And that is the call that got you arrested.",
        "Dusty: This call is from your cell phone.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Craig: Rosanna --",
        "Jennifer: Well, you -- you may as well hear this, too. Paul and I were not the ones who got you and Craig arrested. Your partner here did it all by himself.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, why? It doesn't even make sense.",
        "Rosanna: Makes sense to me.",
        "Rosanna: I think you called the police because it allowed you to fulfill a particular agenda. Why don't you explain that agenda to all of us, darling?",
        "Craig: I don't want to talk about our personal business in front of anybody else, all right? So can we just go home?",
        "Rosanna: No, we cannot go home. Why don't you please explain to everyone why you decided to sabotage your business, betray your partner, frame someone else.",
        "Dusty: This better not have anything to do with that \"silver lining\" thing you were telling me about.",
        "Rosanna: What silver lining thing?",
        "Dusty: You were so cool, totally unfazed, throughout the bust. Didn't you say that the arrest means that you would get off the hook with this adoption thing?",
        "Rosanna: Did you say that?",
        "Craig: It was out of context.",
        "Dusty: Hey, Craig? I'm gonna ask you this just one time. Did you call the cops and rat us out?",
        "Rosanna: Did you? Don't lie to me.",
        "Craig: Yes, I am the one who called the cops.",
        "Dusty: What do you want?",
        "Jennifer: An apology. And you better make it count.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Now may I come in?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you might as well. You'll probably scratch the door until I let you in anyway.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's okay. You don't have to pretend you're doing me a favor, because I know the truth. I know that you are scared to death that I'm gonna blow you out of the water about Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Okay. What you got on me, Barbara? What did I do that was so awful?",
        "Barbara: Think Andr\u00e9.",
        "Paul: What about him?",
        "Barbara: He showed up in this town without a euro in his pocket. And now, my friends overseas are telling me --",
        "Paul: Oh, really? Who would be your friend? Come on.",
        "Barbara: -- Telling me that Jennifer's former beau is single-handedly trying to pull Europe out of its current economic slump. But where, oh, where, did he come into so much money?",
        "Paul: Don't know. Don't care.",
        "Barbara: From you, darling. That's where.",
        "Paul: Really? Why? Why? Why would I gave him money?",
        "Barbara: Because you want Jennifer to hate me. Because you knew that I would be horrified that she had gotten connected to that piece of euro trash, and so you paid him to come over here and set me up!",
        "Paul: I had no idea I was so clever.",
        "Barbara: Oh, so clever. Just like your father.",
        "Paul: I have two parents. Don't underestimate your contribution.",
        "Barbara: Well, congratulations. Your plan worked. She won't even speak to me.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You have only yourself to blame.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no. You're wrong about that. I have myself. And I have you. Come on, now. Come on. Admit that you're the one that masterminded this whole mess. Fine. It doesn't matter whether you fess up or not, 'cause you're not gonna stop me from telling Jennifer what I know.",
        "Paul: What do you know? I mean, really? What do you know? I mean, I know what you think you know. You think that I paid Andr\u00e9 to set you up. But do you have any proof? No? No proof, huh? Because you're bluffing. And I wouldn't go looking for any, either, because if you try and flush me out, not only will Jennifer hate you, but she will make sure that will does, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Something's wrong, isn't it?",
        "Bonnie: I could just tell from the sound of my mom's voice that things are pretty tense at the police station. Marshall has a lot of people looking for you.",
        "Sarah: I don't want to live with him!",
        "Bonnie: I know. And, Sarah, I might not be able to change that. But I might be able to make it better.",
        "Sarah: How?",
        "Bonnie: That's my secret. What I need for you to do is go up to the third floor and do not come down until I come get you. Take books, magazines, whatever you need. Just go upstairs and don't come down, okay?",
        "Sarah: Well, what if your mom comes home and finds me?",
        "Bonnie: Don't worry about my mom. She'll be at the police station for a while. Sarah, things are gonna work out. You might have to live with Marshall , but you don't have to lose me in the process. That's a promise. Uh -- okay. Now go. Just go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I know, Isaac. But if you do hear from Bonnie, have her call me immediately. I will.",
        "Marshall: Jess, I -- I'm sorry I snapped at you. I think Bonnie has something to do with Sarah's disappearance, but I really don't think you had anything to do with it.",
        "Jessica: Well, let's not rush to judgment on my daughter.",
        "Marshall: Jess, I just don't like feeling helpless.",
        "Jessica: You? Helpless?",
        "Marshall: Losing Sarah? It's like when -- when Stenbeck first told me she was alive. He had me looking every which way, and no matter what, I couldn't find her. I need that child. I need to make things work out with her. It's like, if I can fix this -- if I can be a good father, even this late in the game, then maybe I can atone for some of the mistakes that I've made. You of all people can understand that.",
        "Jessica: Your redemption is none of my business, Marshall . I'm not interested in saving your soul, just your daughter.",
        "Marshall: Then help me find her. You keep saying you want to sever any ties with me. As soon as I get Sarah back, she and I will become our own little family, which means we'll be staying as far away from your family as we can get. So you'll find Bonnie, she'll find Sarah. And we'll be out of your life for good.",
        "Jessica: For that, I'll do whatever I can.",
        "Marshall: Can't even get a decent cup of coffee. Why are so many uniforms pushing paper around here? You need to have them out on the street looking for --",
        "Hal: You are not the D.A. Anymore. You do not get to have an opinion about how I run this squad. Now, I know what I'm doing, Marshall , so back off and let me do my job.",
        "Marshall: I will back off when -- where's my daughter? I know you know where she is, so don't try to deny it.",
        "Bonnie: I wouldn't think of it.",
        "Marshall: You're under a legal obligation to tell me.",
        "Bonnie: The only obligation I have is to Sarah. I will tell you where she is under one condition.",
        "Marshall: What is it?",
        "Bonnie: You agree to share permanent custody of her with me.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie?! At least you could have left me a message or a note or something. You could have put away your cads. Maybe you're down at the country club. I think I'll check over there.",
        "Jessica: I thought you might be here. [to Sara]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, you have managed to turn Jennifer against me. But you will not do the same thing with will.",
        "Paul: No, I don't have to do a thing.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I see, because you think Jennifer's gonna do all your dirty work for you. Well, I don't think so. She and I may be having problems right now, but the minute she finds out the way you've manipulated her, she's gonna come running back to me.",
        "Paul: This from a woman who paid Andr\u00e9 to get out of town, I mean, all behind Jennifer's back.",
        "Barbara: Wait a second! You know full well that I never paid that guy a cent. But somebody did. And I'm gonna prove that it was you.",
        "Paul: You have too much free time. You know what you need? A hobby. Maybe macram\u00e9. Yeah, you could make yourself a whole line of macram\u00e9 pantsuits. That could be your big comeback.",
        "Barbara: I have plenty of outside interests. Don't you worry about me, Paul. None of which is as important as making sure that Jennifer knows exactly the kind of man her brother is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What am I suppose to apologize for, Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: For accusing Paul and me.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you and Paul didn't call the cops. But you would have had you had the opportunity.",
        "Jennifer: But I didn't. And therein lies the difference.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, you've been trying to set me up. Now, if I had taken advantage of you that night when you were pretending to be drunk, you would have gone to the cops. You would have told Paul that I attacked you. Am I right?",
        "Jennifer: No! No! The whole -- the whole drunk thing was my idea, okay? I never said anything to Paul. He doesn't know anything about it.",
        "Dusty: So why'd you do it?",
        "Jennifer: Because -- because I like being with you. And I think you like being with me, too, don't you? I felt it, Dusty. You kissed me back.",
        "Dusty: Don't give me that. All right? This is about revenge, Jennifer. You hate Rose. You want revenge for what she and I did to your brother.",
        "Jennifer: No. No, it's not.",
        "Dusty: No? You think you're clever. You are not. You are an amateur. Your primary objective has been to mess things up with me and Rose.",
        "Jennifer: Have you looked in the mirror lately, Dusty? This is not about Rose. It's about you. All of you. Rose is one lucky woman. Where is she tonight?",
        "Dusty: It's none of your business.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Listen, if -- if there's something wrong between you and Rose, and it's something I did, then I'm really sorry.",
        "Dusty: Every time you or your brother comes near me, that's a problem for me.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, I know we got off on the wrong foot. I'm sorry about that. I really am. But that's why it's so important to me that you understand that Paul and I didn't give you up to the police.",
        "Dusty: I got it. I understand. And I'm sorry I sold you short. We're done.",
        "Jennifer: And Paul? Sorry you misjudged him, too?",
        "Dusty: Don't push it.",
        "Jennifer: Apologies accepted. Friends? Kind of?",
        "Jennifer: Good luck working things out with Craig.",
        "Dusty: I'll work it out. Craig needs the luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm so sorry about all of this.",
        "Rosanna: Go away.",
        "Craig: I will. I will. I will, if you give me a chance to explain.",
        "Rosanna: There's nothing to explain. You obviously found the idea of having a baby with me so distasteful, you got yourself arrested.",
        "Craig: I tried to tell you so --",
        "Rosanna: When did you try to tell me? I never knew how you felt. You let me assume that we both wanted to have a baby.",
        "Craig: It just all happened so fast. I didn't -- I didn't have the heart to.",
        "Rosanna: So, what, you -- you let me set up this interview with an adoption agency, and then you pull a high school prank at the last minute?",
        "Craig: Well, I thought it would hurt less somehow. And I can't hurt you. I love you.",
        "Rosanna: Then you should have trusted me. I wasn't asking you to raise a child alone. I would have been there. I would have done all the hard work.",
        "Craig: I know. I know. I know. I know. But an army of nannies would not have made a difference here. The years that I spent raising Bryant, Lucy, were the most wonderful, frustrating and terrifying years of my life. And I am glad they are over.",
        "Rosanna: So, that's it? You get to decide whether I get to be a mother?",
        "Craig: Oh, Rosanna, you and I have so much to do in life. I've never been happier. I've never been this content. This is perfect. But a child -- a child is going to change that. And I don't want to change anything.",
        "Rosanna: I made such a fool of myself.",
        "Craig: No. No, you didn't.",
        "Rosanna: I did.",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Rosanna: I was looking through catalogs to find things for a nursery. If you had told me from the beginning, you would have saved me so much pain!",
        "Craig: Well -- before we got married, all of our discussions about children centered on the fact that -- that you couldn't have any. And if I had known adoption was in our future --",
        "Rosanna: Well, you didn't know because I didn't know. I just had a life- changing operation. I couldn't think straight. I'm sorry I never told you that I wanted to have a baby so badly, but I just found out!",
        "Craig: I can't stand to see you unhappy.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then you know what? Just do me a favor and leave.",
        "Craig: Isn't that where we started? Haven't we made any progress here? Isn't there something that I can do to make you feel better?",
        "Rosanna: You know, there's one thing.",
        "Craig: Well, tell me. Please.",
        "Rosanna: It's non-negotiable.",
        "Craig: Well, I would expect nothing less.",
        "Rosanna: Give up your club -- immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As The World Turns\" --",
        "Barbara: There's something you need to know about your brother. He's not the man that you think he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You don't want to have a baby with me. I don't want to have a business with you. I'm going to take all my money out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.",
        "Sarah: You're gonna send me back to my father.",
        "Jessica: No, I just want to talk to you that are all.",
        "Sarah: Well, I'm not going to go.",
        "Jessica: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. I don't have to talk. I can listen. You want me to listen? Why don't we sit down over there, and you can tell me why you don't want to live with your father? Okay? Are you hungry? Can I get you something to eat or something to drink?",
        "Sarah: No.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Take all the time you need.",
        "Sarah: Well, it's just -- I always thought I wanted be someone's daughter. But now that I am --",
        "Jessica: It's a little strange.",
        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: And harder than you imagined, right? I mean, here you thought you didn't have any parents. And suddenly this man --",
        "Sarah: This stranger.",
        "Jessica: This stranger is telling you that you have to live with him and expecting you to act like a daughter.",
        "Sarah: I don't know how a daughter's supposed to act.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's something you have in common with Marshall , because he doesn't know how a father should act either.",
        "Sarah: No kidding. Do you know what he got me for a present? He got me this little doll, like I'm 10 years old. I mean, he calls -- he calls himself my father, he doesn't even know me.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe not completely. But a part of him has always known you. You know, Sarah, it wasn't that long ago that Marshall found out you even existed. And he made many sacrifices to find you.",
        "Sarah: Well, why didn't he?",
        "Jessica: The only reason that he stopped looking was because this -- this very bad man told him that you were dead. This man was blackmailing your father and making him do things that he didn't want to do. And when your father turned the man in, he was shot.",
        "Sarah: By the bad man?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. And he almost died. So, in light of all of that, I mean, do you think maybe you could overlook his clumsy attempts at trying to be a dad and give him a chance to learn?",
        "Sarah: You think I should?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I do.",
        "Sarah: Then you wouldn't have to worry about me messing up Bonnie's life anymore.",
        "Jessica: Sarah, listen to me. Bonnie loves you. And I don't have a problem with that. But she can't be your parent. You have a father, a man who wants to do right by you. And you should be with him.",
        "Sarah: It sounds like you like him a lot. Bonnie doesn't. She said you didn't either.",
        "Jessica: Well, it really doesn't matter how I feel, does it?",
        "Sarah: Bonnie said that something really bad happened between you and Marshall. What was it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: You know, you are playing a dangerous game. I don't succumb to blackmail.",
        "Bonnie: No one is blackmailing you. I am merely offering you an exchange. I will tell you where Sarah is, in return for shared custody.",
        "Marshall: No deal. You either tell me, or I'll bring you up on charges for extortion, withholding the whereabouts of a minor, kidnapping.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I'm sure my mother can handle whatever you bring my way, Marshall .",
        "Marshall: Your mother's on my side.",
        "Bonnie: You know, there's a lot more at stake here than your precious legal victories.",
        "Marshall: What's at stake here is my child. My child, not yours. You don't have any rights regarding custody of her, not one.",
        "Bonnie: You may have all the legal rights, but I have the emotional ones. I love Sarah. I understand her. She is not some prize I just won or a way to stop feeling guilty for my past mistakes, Marshall . To me, she is a person. And that has to count for something.",
        "Marshall: It can count for anything you want it to, but it still does not make you her parent. That's my right. And if you try to take that away from me, I will come after you with every law on the books.",
        "Bonnie: You know, every time you think I'm getting in your way, you threaten to haul me in.",
        "Marshall: And I haven't, for your mother's sake. See, I'll fight for my child. And I will destroy anybody who threatens her. And this time -- that means you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Andre, its Paul Ryan again. You need to call me. I'm not kidding around. You really need to call me. Hey, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, yourself.",
        "Paul: What's with you?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I found out who clued the police that Dusty and Craig were running an illegal betting operation.",
        "Paul: No kidding? Supermodel or super sleuth? I'm very impressed.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it helps when your dad is chief of detectives. I had him get me a copy of the 911 phone log for that day. Three guesses who blew the whistle.",
        "Paul: Well, I don't care what Dusty says, I know it wasn't you or me.",
        "Jennifer: It was Craig! He had himself arrested so some adoption agency would rule him unfit to be a parent. Can you believe what a loser he is?",
        "Paul: No. I mean, yeah.",
        "Jennifer: And he was totally, totally willing to have us blamed for the arrest. But thanks to me, Dusty now knows the truth.",
        "Paul: Wait a second. Why do you care what Dusty thinks?",
        "Jennifer: I don't.",
        "Paul: You got plans for Dusty, you drop them. Dusty Donovan is off-limits to you.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. And you know what's off-limits to you, Paul? My life. No one gets to tell me how to live it. And that includes you. And if you don't believe me, just ask mom.",
        "Paul: You have no idea what this guy is capable of.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, if you start telling me that you're trying to protect me --",
        "Paul: Okay. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. You're right. You're right. And I quit. Just tell me that you will at least think about what I said to you.",
        "Jennifer: Paul --",
        "Paul: All right. Change the subject. How about Rosanna? Does she know that Craig called 911?",
        "Jennifer: She was right there when I showed Dusty the phone log the call was traced from.",
        "Paul: How'd she take that?",
        "Jennifer: Terrible. It was like her -- like her best friend just got killed. And, of course, Craig tried to explain, but, you know, she ran out.",
        "Paul: Do you know where she went?",
        "Jennifer: No idea. I'm sure she didn't go home. She wouldn't want to run into Craig.",
        "Paul: No, probably not.",
        "Jennifer: That poor woman. She must really be desperate for someone to understand what she's going through. But Craig, obviously, never could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I give up my partnership in Java Underground or --",
        "Rosanna: Or you lose any chance to fix the mess you've made of this marriage.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: Is that an ultimatum?",
        "Rosanna: Those are my terms. You can look at it any way you want to. You're either married to this business that isn't worth your time, or you're married to me.",
        "Craig: Well, am I asking you to give up Cabot Motors?",
        "Rosanna: I don't have any problem keeping Cabot Motors from affecting our relationship. You live in two separate worlds -- business and personal. And the bridge that you build between them is made of lies. I have been through this once before with Monte Carlo . I'm not going through it again. I'm not going to be the outsider in my own relationship. I'm not going to be the last person to know what my husband is up to.",
        "Craig: No, you won't, because this is not gonna happen again.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no.",
        "Craig: No!",
        "Rosanna: It probably won't. But you know what? Some other situation will come up, and then you will just go sliding headlong down whatever slippery slope is ethically available.",
        "Craig: This situation -- this club is the first thing that I've had any fun with, besides you, since Monte Carlo . All right?",
        "Rosanna: Wow, well, that must have made it really tough for you to narc on your partner. Still, it got you out of being a parent, being a father, didn't it?",
        "Craig: All right, all right. That's what you're angry about. And we will work that out, all right? But don't ask me to leave a partnership that could be a huge success.",
        "Rosanna: What about our partnership?! Doesn't that count?!",
        "Craig: You and I can work anything out.",
        "Rosanna: Really? I don't know. I'm not sure. So I'm going to make this very simple for you. You don't want to have a baby with me. I don't want to have a business with you. I'm going to take all my money out.",
        "Craig: You can't pull your money out of Java Underground.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really? Yes, I can.",
        "Craig: We are about to open. We have spent a small fortune in renovations. And we have a deal.",
        "Rosanna: We have a marriage. And you keep changing the rules.",
        "Craig: All right. Look, look, look. You want to punish me, make me sleep on the coach or something. But don't -- don't try to control me with money. That's not gonna work.",
        "Rosanna: You know what I'm doing actually has nothing to do with you. It has to do with me and protecting the last shred of dignity that I have.",
        "Craig: Rosanna --",
        "Rosanna: No, don't follow me, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Damn you, Montgomery. You're gonna pay for this, pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: What did my father do to you that made Bonnie hate him so much?",
        "Jessica: What makes you think it has anything to do with me?",
        "Sarah: Well, Bonnie said you dated.",
        "Jessica: We did date briefly. But it ended.",
        "Sarah: Ended good or ended bad?",
        "Jessica: Badly. It ended badly.",
        "Sarah: Why?",
        "Jessica: Well, you know just grown-up stuff.",
        "Sarah: You keep saying you want me to live with the guy, and you won't even tell me what happened.",
        "Jessica: Well, sweetheart, because it really has nothing to do with your relationship with him.",
        "Sarah: It does if it means that I can't trust him.",
        "Jessica: Honey, it's personal. Okay. Basically, your father's feelings for me were stronger than mine were for him. And that imbalance led to a great deal of conflict. Okay? And -- Bonnie is just still angry at him for the way he behaved during that time.",
        "Sarah: So you forgive him, and she doesn't? Why?",
        "Jessica: Maybe because I'm a mom. I know what it's like to have a daughter. I know what's at stake here. But the point is, Sarah, Marshall is your father. And he wants to give you a home. Please let him do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: I'll find Sarah with or without you.",
        "Bonnie: And you know all she's going to do is run away from you. She will hate you for having me arrested.",
        "Marshall: In a few weeks, she won't even remember you.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, she will remember me. She will always remember me as someone who loved her, someone who reached out to her.",
        "Marshall: I love her. I reached out to her.",
        "Bonnie: You don't even know how to talk to her, Marshall! You are so far in over your head here. The only way Sarah will ever trust or respect you is if I am standing right there telling her it's okay. You need me.",
        "Marshall: I need you to tell me where my daughter is.",
        "Bonnie: Not unless I get shared custody. I promised her -- I promised her I would never leave her side and that I would never just turn her over to you, not like this. I keep my promises.",
        "Marshall: Hal! Arrest this girl on charges of extortion, kidnapping, obstruction of justice.",
        "Hal: Hold it. Hold it. Bonnie, I'm gonna need your help here.",
        "Bonnie: By all means. Arrest me.",
        "Bonnie: Go ahead, Hal. You do what you have to do.",
        "Hal: Just tell me where Sarah is, and we can put an end to this right now.",
        "Bonnie: Nope.",
        "Hal: Bonnie, if I charge you, marshal's gonna get a conviction.",
        "Marshall: You got that right.",
        "Hal: You'll have a record for some very serious crimes. Look, I'm willing to overlook the fact that this department has put in a lot manpower and a lot of money. Now if you know where Sarah is, it's time to come clean right now.",
        "Bonnie: I'm sorry, Hal. But I just I can't do that.",
        "Jessica: What's going on here?",
        "Marshall: Bonnie's about to be arrested.",
        "Jessica: Well, there's no need for that. Sarah's fine.",
        "Marshall: Oh, thank God. I was so worried. Why'd you run off like that?",
        "Sarah: Well, I was scared and -- well, I'm better now. And I'm ready to go home.",

        "Barbara: May I come in?",
        "Jennifer: Paul's not here.",
        "Barbara: Good. Good. I want to talk to you.",
        "Jennifer: There's nothing to discuss.",
        "Barbara: Well, honey, there is. There's something you need to know about your brother. He's not the man that you think he is",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna? Oh, Dusty, let me explain.",
        "Dusty: What? It's gonna be hard for you to explain with your teeth knocked down your throat.",
        "Bartender: Here you go, Ms. Montgomery.",
        "Rosanna: It's Cabot. Again.",
