        "Gwen: I will. I'll be good, I promise. Can I ask you, how's Casey Hughes doing? I heard that they transferred here from another hospital.",
        "Lucy: They did. He's in intensive care.",

        "Gwen: Okay, thank you.",
        "Lucy: Now, I want you to stay off that leg as much as possible. Do you have someone coming to pick you up and take you home?",

        "Will: I told Carly I'd take you home.",
        "Gwen: You don't have to do that.",

        "Katie: No, Oakdale Realty.",
        "Mike: I was close.",
        "Katie: Pretty close. I met with a realtor and I saw the most beautiful houses. Look at this one. Oh, my God. So gorgeous. It makes our house look so small and -- well, the important thing is, location, location, location. Look, miles outside of town. Away from everything and everyone.",
        "Mike: Okay, I'm not letting Simon Frasier run us out of town, and neither are you.",

        "Carly: Good morning.",
        "Simon: The jet's all fueled and ready to go. How about you? You ready to takeoff? What's the matter? I thought you wanted to be single by sunset.",
        "Carly: I did. But now I'm not so sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why are you playing matchmaker with me and Lucy?",
        "Lucinda: I have not uttered the girl's name?",
        "Dusty: You said you had a date in mind for me.",
        "Lucinda: And visions of Lucy popped into your head --",
        "Dusty: Why do I need a date? I'm working.",
        "Lucinda: Mr. Yamamoto is one of the most important businessmen --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I read his bio. He's a major dude. He makes major paper. Why do I need a date?",
        "Lucinda: Because Mr. Yamamoto is very traditional. Not just -- we hold the business cards the correct way, he believes in family values. He really means it. He never travels without his beautiful wife.",
        "Dusty: So what?",
        "Lucinda: So, we want show that he's investing with a company that believes in Mom and apple pie, and that he'd be working with people who believe as he does, that your commitment in your personal life will prove what your commitment in business will be.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Should I bring Johnny?",
        "Lucinda: Funny. Very funny. What's this billions riding -- what's so hard about having a beautiful girl on your arm?",
        "Dusty: A beautiful girl named Lucy?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't see any other girl. I mean, I'll look, I'll look. And it's not too late, for rent-a-date. But I do happen to know that Lucy has the afternoon off.",
        "Dusty: Come on. Come on, please. Please? I don't need a social director.",
        "Lucinda: Mrs. Yamamoto on his right, and Lucy on his left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: He's so precious.",
        "Luke: Yeah, he does kind of grow on you. Do you want to feed him later?",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah. I don't know. Maybe I better not, I don't want to push it with your dad.",
        "Luke: No, he won't be here for awhile.",
        "Jade: He is one happy little man.",
        "Luke: You're really good with children, Jade.",
        "Jade: Right, I'm a regular Mary Poppins --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, I mean it. I've seen you with my sisters, braiding their hair, telling them stories -- for awhile there, they were all about Jade, and now, you can add little baby Ethan to your fan club.",
        "Jade: Do outcasts have fan clubs? You know, I didn't have much of a childhood. And it was unfair, but there's nothing I can do about it now. But if I can see one little guy like this get all the love and attention he deserves, that -- it makes it better. Did you hear that baby Ethan? I only have eyes for you.",
        "Holden: Luke? I just wanted to grab those new cd's for your mom \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm just not sure that, that now is the best time for me to leave home.",
        "Simon: Okay, all right, because here's the thing. Putting a quickie divorce on hold kind of defeats the purpose.",
        "Carly: Simon, did you see the headlines this morning?",
        "Simon: Something about a serial killer.",
        "Carly: Right, there were murders up at Raven Lake. And my sister was there. And she was hurt.",
        "Simon: Oh, God. I had no idea, and I'm so sorry. Is she okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I think so. I think she's going to be fine. She's being released from the hospital and she's coming here. And I just don't know if she'll be strong enough for me to leave her. Oh, Gwen. Oh, Gwen. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what you went through. Let me get a look at you, okay? Are you okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm still standing.",
        "Carly: You are?",
        "Will: Standing? She was ready to power walk out of the hospital. They practically had to strap her to the wheelchair.",
        "Gwen: That's because that was stupid.",
        "Will: Then we get here, and I go to open the car door, and she's halfway up the porch.",
        "Gwen: I don't need help getting up the stairs. I'm getting around fine. Hello.",
        "Simon: Hey.",
        "Gwen: I'm Gwen.",
        "Simon: Nice to meet you.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is my sister Gwen and this is her husband, Will.",
        "Simon: Will.",
        "Carly: This is Simon Frasier. He's my boss.",
        "Simon: It sounds like you two had quite an ordeal. I'm glad that you are both okay.",
        "Gwen: Thank you. Are you going somewhere?",
        "Carly: I was thinking about it.",
        "Gwen: Like a business trip.",
        "Carly: Personal business.",
        "Gwen: What kind of personal business?",
        "Carly: Oh, Gwen. It's nothing for you to worry about, really. Simon was going to come along with me for moral support. That is if I decide to go, because I'm not even sure that I can leave you. That I want to leave you.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm just going to chill out on the couch with the remote and a bag of potato chips.",
        "Will: And I'm going to be here checking in every hour on the hour.",
        "Simon: All right then, we should really get going. Carly, what's stopping you now? Your sister is going to be fine. Let's do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Oh, good morning, my morning glory.",
        "Jack: Good morning.",
        "Emma: I got halfway to the livestock auction, and I forgot the catalog. Here it is. I have it all marked. You know, Jack, something's just don't look better in the morning.",
        "Jack: What's that?",
        "Emma: The divorce papers. Holden told me you were having a hard time signing them last night.",
        "Jack: Boy, some people just can't keep a secret around here --",
        "Emma: What secret? What secret? What secret? I've seen you struggling with this. Every time Carly comes to pick up the kids or drop them off, I mean, you look at her like it was your wedding day. And she looks back at you the same way.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well Emma, there's no harm in looking. It's when we talk, things get all jammed up.",
        "Emma: I don't know Jack, there's some kind of feeling here that's stopping you from signing off on this divorce.",
        "Jack: It's just I -- it's tough to close the door. Even after Carly and I have been away from each other for as long as we have, it's not getting any easier.",
        "Emma: Well, it shouldn't. You made your vows. You know you're in it for the long haul. It shouldn't get any easier. What are you supposed to do? You're supposed to pick up a pen, and sign on the dotted line, and shout \"next.\"",
        "Jack: What Carly and I had, it's over. It's been over for a long time.",
        "Emma: Maybe it's not so over. If you still love someone, and someone still sometimes still loves you back --",
        "Jack: Sometimes love just isn't enough, Emma.",
        "Emma: Jack, are you sure? You know, ending this marriage was your idea. I'm sure if you told Carly that you changed your mind, that she wouldn't put up a fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: I have just the find the girl to fit the bill.",
        "Dusty: Excuse me. Is Doctor montgomery still working?",
        "Nurse: Yeah, I just saw her. Do you want me to have her paged?",
        "Dusty: No, no emergency. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike, give me one good reason why we can't move.",
        "Mike: I'll give you a handful of reasons. First off, you love our house.",
        "Katie: It's just a house.",
        "Mike: The house has been lived in. I mean, it's not just a house. We made a lot of memories there.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, it wasn't always our house.",
        "Mike: Okay, but we've worked hard to make it our house. Why do you think I put the deck out back? So we could sit outside and watch the kids play.",
        "Katie: I have been thinking a lot about our son lately, and he looks just like you.",
        "Mike: Okay. Look, you want another reason why we shouldn't move? All right, our family's here. Okay, Casey's laid up. Your sister's going to want you around. You're going to want her around when that baby comes. Okay, everything we have, everything we want, is right here. It doesn't make any sense at all to move.",
        "Katie: Even though Simon's right there every time you turn around?",
        "Mike: Look, I'm not saying that I like having him around. I don't even like being in the same area code as the guy, but I'm going to be damned if I'm going to let him run us out of town.",
        "Katie: No, I don't want that either.",
        "Mike: Okay, look, we both want the same thing. We want a family and a future. I don't care if the two of you carved your initials in the wood. I'll sand it off.",
        "Katie: So, you're really not mad that I told Simon we were trying for a baby?",
        "Mike: I was a little irritated at first, but I don't know, it just hit me, you know? I don't care what he knows, I don't care what you told him. Okay, because the Kasnoff family, party of two, soon to be party of three -- that's all that matters to me. What's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing, just a cramp.",
        "Mike: You all right?",
        "Katie: I'm not sure I know how to answer that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You don't have to hold my hand, Simon. Or shove me through the door.",
        "Simon: How about a gentle little push?",
        "Carly: Try it, and you'll end up in the cow pasture.",
        "Simon: Yeah, there's nothing like being back on a farm to make you realize how nice it is not to be back on a farm.",
        "Carly: I love this place.",
        "Simon: Well, maybe you can make it part of the divorce settlement. You get to visit every second Tuesday.",
        "Carly: No, don't do that. Don't make it sound like my marriage is something that I'm trading away.",
        "Simon: I'm not. I'm not. I just thought that's why we were here.",
        "Carly: My reasons are my own.",
        "Simon: Obviously. I mean, you haven't even told your sister about the divorce yet.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe that's because it's not all about me. Maybe because she's having marriage problems of her own.",
        "Simon: Or maybe if you actually say those words out loud, \"I'm divorcing Jack\", it will all make it seem too real.",
        "Carly: I've said it. Well, I whispered it. I've stood there in the shower and thought about it for so long that I couldn't even remember if I washed my hair. I even asked J.J.'s magic eight ball. \"Will Jack and I get divorced?\"",
        "Simon: And what'd it say?",
        "Carly: \"Reply hazy, try again.\" I will tell Gwen when the divorce is final.",
        "Simon: Okay, there you go. So maybe the haze has lifting a bit. What about Jack?",
        "Carly: What about him?",
        "Simon: What if he's not as willing to walk away from this as he said? Are you going to puddle up and go back to the guy that walked out on you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: That was very weird.",
        "Will: What was?",
        "Gwen: Seeing Carly with another guy.",
        "Will: Well, she said he was her boss.",
        "Gwen: Do you know anything about him?",
        "Will: Simon? No, I mean, the last time he was around, I was a kid.",
        "Gwen: Doesn't tell me a whole lot.",
        "Will: You know the books that use words like \"cad\" and \"bounder\"? That was kind of his rep.",
        "Gwen: So my sister has personal business with a bounder.",
        "Will: Maybe it's not what it looks like.",
        "Gwen: Maybe. Maybe it's time that I stop hoping that Carly and Jack get back together.",
        "Will: Hope. It's hard to let go of.",
        "Gwen: How'd you sleep in that hard hospital chair?",
        "Will: Who says I slept?",
        "Gwen: You didn't sleep at all?",
        "Will: Well, when the nightmare woke you up, I kind of sat up, and was just watching you for awhile.",
        "Gwen: When did you shower and change your clothes?",
        "Will: When the day shift came on, I ran home and did a some errands.",
        "Gwen: Came back in time to personally escort me home?",
        "Will: Yeah. I wanted to make sure you got settled in, you know.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's something I probably won't be feeling for awhile.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Gwen: A lot of our friends -- they're dead, Will. And Casey's still in critical condition. And I'm sitting here on the couch with a soda, and I'm acting like everything is fine.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. You've got to remember how lucky we are.",
        "Gwen: Oh I do. I made a list of things that I want to do when my leg gets better. I want to see Johnny and kiss him and hold him. I want to raid the Snyders' pumpkin patch -- dance, even though I can't. I want to sing with my band. I want Maddie to be okay. And I want to force Casey into a wheelchair and bring him home, just like you did with me.",
        "Will: Like I could ever tell you what to do --",
        "Gwen: I was just cranky and in a bad mood.",
        "Will: Why don't you lie down and take a nap?",
        "Gwen: I don't want to -- I'm afraid that if I close my eyes, I'll have that nightmare of the knife coming at me again.",
        "Will: Okay, well then let me stay, Gwen. I'll keep the bad dreams away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Would you go back to Katie if she gave you another chance?",
        "Simon: I told you -- I've moved on and I meant it.",
        "Carly: Well, so have I. And for your information, I don't dissolve into puddles as you said.",
        "Simon: My mistake.",
        "Carly: So why are you standing here watching me?",
        "Simon: I don't know -- I guess I just enjoy the view.",
        "Carly: Go wait in the car, Simon. Wait in the car.",
        "Simon: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Carly: Hello, Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: I guess I don't have to ask what those papers are?",
        "Jack: I haven't signed them yet.",
        "Carly: You're not going to sign them, Jack. And neither am I.",
        "[Carly rips them up and throws them in the trash can]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will, I know that I was of out of it last night, but I know for sure that I said something about us, and it was too soon.",
        "Will: I'm not talking about it going back to the way it was. I know that can't happen right away, you know. But maybe we could just be like -- housemates.",
        "Gwen: What does that mean?",
        "Will: It means you sleep in one bedroom, and I sleep in another, or on the couch, and then when you need something, I'm here.",
        "Gwen: If I need something -- like what?",
        "Will: I don't know. 24-hour kitchen. Midnight grilled cheese. I'll throw in the tomato soup for free. I'll stay up with you until you're too tired to keep your eyes open. Too tired to be scared.",
        "Gwen: Then what?",
        "Will: And then I'll walk you upstairs. Put you to bed. You know, leave the light on and your door open a crack. I'll check on you. I owe you that much. I've done nothing but get it wrong for so long that maybe I can finally get something right.",
        "Gwen: Well, you were some kind of hero last night. That's enough.",
        "Will: Yeah, but look what it took for me to show up for you.",
        "Gwen: But you did. Let's just leave it at that for now?",
        "Will: You're scared of me.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, Will.",
        "Will: No, I mean, you're afraid that if you let me stay, then I'm gonna push it. And I'll get my hopes up about us getting back together or I'll pressure you into giving our marriage a second chance. But if me staying here doesn't work for you, that's okay too, you know. I've got a few things to get out of the car, and then I'll leave you alone.",

        "Luke: Dad, I didn't expect you --",
        "Holden: Obviously. What's she doing here?",
        "Jade: I think this little guy needs a diaper change.",
        "Luke: I invited her.",
        "Holden: I don't want her spending any time with Ethan.",
        "Luke: But you let her hold him before.",
        "Holden: That was in public. I was on the spot. But this is our home, and it feels like you sneaking behind my back.",
        "Luke: Dad come on, that's not what it is. And you should have seen her defend me when I told Kevin I was gay, I mean he got really ugly and she was like, a woman on fire. It was awesome.",
        "Holden: I appreciate that. And I'll thank her when she leaves.",
        "Luke: Actually, I was thinking. Well, you've seen her with Ethan and with the girls. And you know, since we have babysitter issues, I just thought that -- never mind.",
        "Holden: You thought that we should hire Jade? As Ethan's nanny.",
        "Luke: Dad, she's a natural. I mean, right now she really needs to feel needed. And admit it, it would be a big weight off your shoulders, you can spend much more time with mom at the hospital.",
        "Holden: It's not going to happen. I don't want her in this house.",
        "Luke: But I don't think she has much going on for her out there -- I don't even know if she has a place to stay.",
        "Holden: You know what, I feel for her, I do. I know that she's had it rough, but I don't trust her. Neither does your mother, and there is no way in hell that I am going to let her back into our lives.",

        "Jack: Carly, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: What does it look like?",
        "Jack: Like you just shredded our divorce papers.",
        "Carly: Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Jack: I'm just confused.",
        "Carly: Seems to be a lot of that going around lately.",
        "Jack: Thought we both decided that we were gonna go through with the divorce, right? That it was the best thing for both of us.",
        "Carly: Only thing we've agreed on in a very long time. And if we're both so sure, I got to thinking, why drag it out? Filing for divorce and waiting for it to become final -- it's really not good for either one of us.",
        "Jack: That's why you filed the papers in the trash?",
        "Carly: I went online. And I found a way to speed up the process. But I have to go down to Santo Domingo to make it official. So you'll need you to take the kids and hopefully you can go over and check on Gwen --",
        "Jack: Like you have to ask.",
        "Carly: Good. Thank you. So, this is what I downloaded. And you just have to sign and in 48 hours, we'll both be free.",
        "Jack: No, no Carly. I can't let you do this.",

        "Dusty: Picking up a prescription.",
        "Lucy: Oh, is Johnny sick?",
        "Dusty: No.",

        "Lucy: Ouch, I mean, that can really hurt. Let's see if they have anything at the desk.",
        "Dusty: That's okay, it can wait. I've got a meeting at the Lakeview -- Worldwide's wining and dining some Tokyo media guy, and your grandma's in charge of the whole deal.",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh. Did she go over the top as usual?",
        "Dusty: Sushi bar, gift bags --",
        "Lucy: Sounds like fun.",
        "Dusty: You think?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, why not?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. You're a doctor -- whatever.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, don't let this shock you, but I have other interests besides medicine.",
        "Dusty: I remember. So you think my business meeting sounds like fun, huh?",
        "Lucy: If I were going, yeah.",
        "Dusty: So how fast can you change? We've got to be there by noon.",
        "Lucy: Dusty Donovan, are you asking me out on a date?",
        "Dusty: It's not really a date. It's a business function.",
        "Lucy: Oh, with a sushi bar and gift bags.",
        "Dusty: Right.",
        "Lucy: But it's not a date.",

        "Dusty: Good, so it's a --",
        "Lucy: No, no. Not a date. I know you're not ready for anything like that. So why don't we call it something else then?",
        "Dusty: Like what?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. How about herb?",

        "Carly: And in the second place?",
        "Jack: I don't like the idea of you traveling all the way to a strange country all by yourself.",
        "Carly: Well Jack, in the first place, with what Simon pays me, I can afford the trip. And it's actually irrelevant in this case because he's flying me down there on his private jet, and in the second place, they're not called strange countries just because you've never been there.",
        "Jack: I guess you've got this all figured out then.",
        "Carly: I'm trying. Any objections? Because if it's Simon, there is nothing going on. He's just, he's going with me as my friend.",

        "Gwen: It smells like you.",
        "Will: And your mp3 player with some good music on it. I was going to bring your guitar. But I figured you should come get that yourself.",
        "Gwen: Is there anything else?",
        "Will: Yeah, we've got fuzzy socks. And a picture from Christmas. And that's it.",

        "Katie: I was even starting to feel like I had cravings, you know? I wanted you to go out and get me chow mein in the middle of the night. My clothes felt tighter. I even saw a glow this morning in the mirror, I thought.",
        "Mike: Well, I hate to tell you this, but you always have that glow.",
        "Katie: Why do I do this to myself? Two days late and I already had myself six months pregnant. Then I felt that feeling and -- not this time.",
        "Mike: Okay, well then next time.",

        "Katie: I was so sure.",
        "Mike: It'll happen when the time is right. Your clothes will start to get a little tighter. And I'll be out doing those chow mein runs every night, and I promise you when you give me that card it will be sitting right on the bedside table right next to your picture. And I'll be thanking God for both of you.",
