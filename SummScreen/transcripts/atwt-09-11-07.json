        "Clerk: I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan is not in his room.",
        "Lily: Okay, when he comes in, can you just tell him I need to see him immediately. It's urgent. Thank you. [Lily calls Dusty on her phone] Dusty, it is Lily. I need to follow up with you about Cheri. I still want to help you. I cannot see you go to jail for a murder that you did not commit. Call me when you get this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg? Meg. J.J., have you seen Meg?",
        "J.J.: Did you try calling her cell?",
        "Craig: She's out doing chores.",
        "J.J.: No, she's not. Sorry. I saw her drive off in her car.",
        "Craig: When?",
        "J.J.: About a half-hour ago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You felt that, Paul. You can't tell me you didn't.",
        "Paul: You're right. I did feel something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Saleswoman: You get the best buys at sample sales. And you were smart to get here early.",
        "Carly: First smart thing I've done all day.",
        "Saleswoman: Let me know if you need any help.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[Carly picks up a black dress and remembers]",
        "Jack: So, yeah, you wearing that dress, it makes me remember. And that's where -- that's where you made a mistake Carly. You made me remember everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Saleswoman: That one would look great on you. Would you like to try it on?",
        "Carly: Well, I do love this color, but I think it's time I tried something new.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Katie -- Katie, wait a second. Wait a second. Will you just listen to me for a second, please? You're right. There is no guarantee that a year from now I will feel differently about us having a baby together.",
        "Katie: And you were right, too. You already do have a family --",
        "Jack: I just think that Parker and J.J. and Sage need some time to get used to having a step-mom and feel more secure about Carly. They need to know that she's not going to run out and leave them again.",
        "Katie: It always comes back to Carly. That's why I want to have a baby with you. Our baby. So that for once it's not about Jack and Carly. It could be about Jack and Katie. That's never going to happen, is it?",
        "Jack: Can I say something that I think you don't want to hear?",
        "Katie: Go ahead.",
        "Jack: I think that you are the one who's making this about Carly. I think the reason you want to have a baby so much is because Carly and I have a baby together. And if you have the same thing, then it makes you -- even somehow.",
        "Katie: Can we not pick this apart? I wanted a baby with you ever since I fell in love with you. Isn't that natural?",
        "Jack: Yes. Yes, Katie, you know I want to make you happy. I will do anything -- anything to make you happy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you can't want this for me. You need to want it for yourself.",
        "Jack: All I'm saying is -- it's just -- it's complicated.",
        "Katie: And all I'm saying is I don't want to end up some lonely old childless woman.",
        "Jack: That will never happen. You know why? Because my kids love you so much.",
        "Katie: I love them, too. Because in each and every one of them, I see a part of you. Like Parker has your honesty and your strength. And J.J. has that sweet, good heart. And Sage has your sense of humor and your smile. I know how much they mean to you. Is it so wrong to want to give you a baby that's going to mean that much to you, too?",
        "Jack: No, no, it's not wrong at all. But -- do we have to decide this right away?",
        "Katie: I just don't want to get married and a year from now, you still don't want to have a baby and I still do.",
        "Jack: Katie, we will work this out. We have to. I love you too much to lose you.",
        "Katie: I love you too. That's why it's so hard -- letting go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When you kissed me, what I felt was pity -- that you would be so desperate.",
        "Meg: You don't mean that.",
        "Paul: Yes, I do.",
        "Meg: Then why did you kiss me back? I'll tell you why. Because whether you want to or not, you still have feelings for me. They never went away. We still love each other, Paul. We always will.",
        "Paul: Is that what you tell yourself when you're having trouble sleeping? When you're lying in your bed awake next to Craig? The second you put that wedding ring on, whatever you and I did have, died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: So you're trying to find Meg so you can make up with her, right?",
        "Craig: I said we're not fighting.",
        "J.J.: Parker said you're broke.",
        "Craig: Well, who's Parker, is he my accountant?",
        "J.J.: No, but you moved out of your big house so you can come live at the farm, right?",
        "Craig: Maybe I wanted to get a taste of the simple life.",
        "J.J.: Yeah, right. Oh, you love living at the farm. I can tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I left you a note at the house. Didn't you get it?",
        "Lily: Uh, no, I didn't get it. What did it say?",
        "Holden: You know what? We need to talk. Sit down.",
        "Lily: I figured since you were staying in the guest room, we weren't talking.",
        "Holden: Lily, we've had a lot of disagreements lately, but we still have our children, we need to raise them.",
        "Lily: I know. Because of those children, I think we need to work things out.",
        "Holden: Well, that might be easier to do if you can make a promise and keep it for once.",
        "Lily: This is all about me breaking the rules --",
        "Holden: You know what? I heard you on the phone just now. You said you were going to stay away from Dusty and this case until it was resolved. But you couldn't do that, could you?",
        "Lily: Dusty did not commit this crime --",
        "Holden: Lily, I think it's time to make a choice. Stay away from Dusty and the murder investigation. Because if you keep it up, if you keep doing things behind my back -- we won't have a marriage anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know what? If you need to punish me for staying married to Craig, go ahead. Get it out of your system.",
        "Paul: You were supposed to stay married to Craig long enough to bring him down. Did you know how long that plan was supposed to last? Until the wedding night.",
        "Meg: I still love you, Paul. When I thought you died, it felt like my life was over.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you got yourself a new and improved life, didn't you? Craig. Running his company, living in his mansion.",
        "Meg: Without you, it didn't matter what happened to me. So I just stayed where I was.",
        "Paul: And that's where you are now -- tied to a guy who's about to lose everything. How does that feel?",
        "Meg: How does it feel living your life driven by hate? You need to let it go, Paul, for your own sake. But I know, deep down, that's not what you want.",
        "Paul: You know what I want? I want you to leave, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What are you saying, Katie? That you're giving up on us?",
        "Katie: I have to give up on a dream that I had. A dream that I would have a child with you. That was one of the things that I wished for when you tied this around my wrist. So now it's just never going to come true --",
        "Jack: You don't know that, okay? And neither do I. This -- I'm just saying, that's how I feel right now, okay? So can we please just table this conversation for a while anyway, and focus on our wedding?",
        "Katie: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Listen to me. Henry is busting his tail over there, getting that diner ready for the shower. All of our friends and family are going to be there. You said you wanted to buy a new dress for the party. Why don't you do that? And I'll go over to the diner and help Henry. Katie, we're still getting married. That hasn't changed.",
        "Katie: Okay. And when the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Wise up, would you? A new dress isn't going to solve anything. Jack doesn't love you anymore. Don't say it. Even if he and Katie do break up over this baby thing, that doesn't mean that Jack will ever want you again. Well, I'm not doing this for Jack -- I'm doing it for me.",
        "Saleswoman: If you like that designer, there's more of her fall line in the other room.",
        "Carly: Oh, great. Good. I'll check it out.",
        "Saleswoman: Let me know if you need help.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Saleswoman: Well, hello there. Katie Peretti, right? I am a shameless \"Oakdale Now\" fan.",
        "Katie: Oh, thanks. Well, some people think the show's pretty shameless, thanks to Brad.",
        "Saleswoman: He's so bad. I mean, in a good way. And I just love how you put him in his place. Wish I could do that with my husband.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it's not so easy to get men to do what we want, is it?",
        "Saleswoman: Well, you make it look easy.",
        "Katie: The magic of television. Real life, a different story.",
        "Saleswoman: Buy yourself a new outfit. You'll forget all your troubles.",
        "Katie: I should be so lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Clanging sound]",
        "Rosanna: Hi. Kind of early to be drinking.",
        "Paul: How are you?",
        "Rosanna: I'm good. Stay there. I have a surprise for you.",
        "Paul: A souvenir from Detroit?",
        "Rosanna: No, something better than that.",
        "Paul: Craig's head on a stick?",
        "Rosanna: You have a one-track mind. [Roseanna stands up] Whoa. Watch. There's more.",
        "[Roseanna walks]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: When did you stop trusting me? When I started taking those pills?",
        "Holden: No, I got past that. Because after the pills, after you lost your mother's company, you woke up. And after rehab, I started to breathe a little bit easier. But then you gave Carly that ransom money. And you followed that up by hiding Dusty's gun.",
        "Lily: So you're just all out of forgiveness.",
        "Holden: I've always forgiven you. And you've always said that it won't happen again. But then it does.",
        "Lily: You know, I'm sorry I'm such a big disappointment.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sorry that I couldn't have helped you more.",
        "Lily: What, do you think it's your responsibility to stop me from messing up?",
        "Holden: Look, I just want us to stop making the same mistakes over and over again, all right? And can we at least try -- [Cell phone rings] Hey, Jack, what's up?",
        "Jack: I was just wondering if you can come down to the diner. I need some help setting up for the party.",
        "Holden: Uh, yeah, sure. I'll be right there. I've got to go.",
        "Lily: You know, I want you to be able to start trusting me again. I would never do anything deliberately to hurt you or the family. You know that.",
        "Holden: I know it's not deliberate.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Krista: It's Krista, from the Avalon. You gave me your card?",
        "Lily: Yeah -- yes, hi. Do you have any more information about Cheri?",
        "Krista: You said you'd make it worth my while, right?",
        "Lily: Definitely.",
        "Krista: Can you meet me right away at Old Town?",
        "Lily: If you have a lead on who killed her, sure. But I'm not paying for a wild goose chase that doesn't go anywhere.",
        "Krista: I'm not going to waste your time, okay? You want to meet up with me, or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Saleswoman: I'm sorry, Ms. Peretti, it's cash only.",
        "Katie: Oh, I didn't realize that. I don't think I have enough.",
        "Saleswoman: There's an ATM just down the block.",
        "Katie: Okay. Would you mind holding this for me? It's the best thing that's happened to me all day and I don't want to lose it. I'll be right back.",
        "Saleswoman: Find anything you like?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes, just now.",
        "Saleswoman: I'm sorry, but that one's taken.",
        "Carly: Really? By who? I don't see anyone else here.",
        "Saleswoman: Well, she just stepped out.",
        "Carly: Well, then I guess she doesn't get the dress, does she?",
        "Saleswoman: She went down to the ATM to get cash. She's coming right back.",
        "Carly: What if she doesn't? You'll miss a sale.",
        "Saleswoman: I'm sure she'll be here any minute.",
        "Carly: Just let me try it on.",
        "Saleswoman: I don't want you to be disappointed.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to be disappointed. It's beautiful. I love the color. The cut's great. I'm just going to try it.",
        "Saleswoman: I'm sure we have something similar by the same designer. I'll see what I can find.",
        "Katie: I ended up finding money at the bottom of my purse. Don't you love when that happens? Okay, I think this should cover it. Where's my dress?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, my young friend, Meg and I won't be imposing on you or the rest of the Snyder family much longer.",
        "J.J.: Who is Stanley?",
        "Craig: Stanley is my lawyer, who is unfreezing assets as we speak.",
        "J.J.: Yay! So you're not going to be broke anymore.",
        "Craig: Well, let's just say you, Parker, Sage, you can argue about who left the wet towels on the floor in the bathroom. Meantime, Meg and I --",
        "J.J.: Will be fighting all the time.",
        "Craig: We're not fighting. How many times do I have to tell you that?",
        "J.J.: Whatever, okay? You know, I'm going to go muck out the stables before I go back to school.",
        "Craig: Oh, joys of country living. You'd better be there this time --",
        "Meg: Hey, Craig.",
        "Craig: Where the hell have you been? Why didn't you tell me where you were going?",
        "Meg: I didn't want to upset you. I went to see Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Paul: Having you back so soon, that's nice. Seeing you walk on your own, that's fantastic.",
        "Rosanna: I practiced the whole time that I was gone. It was a little tricky at first, but, you know, bit by bit -- I finally feel like I'm alive again.",
        "Paul: After everything that Craig had done to you -- so how did everything go with the lawyers and the accountants?",
        "Rosanna: Well, everybody I talked to said that Craig has been using Cabot Motors as his own personal checking account for the past two years. That's how he bought Worldwide and everything else he could get his greedy little hands on.",
        "Paul: Well, we'll make sure that he has to pay for every single dime that he stole from you.",
        "Rosanna: And now that I can walk again, perhaps I shall stomp him right into the dirt.",
        "Paul: That, I'd like to see. It's an amazing comeback.",
        "Rosanna: I did it for you. For us.",
        "Paul: I missed you. What?",
        "Rosanna: Is that lipstick? It's -- it's not mine.",
        "Paul: Meg was here -- earlier.",
        "Rosanna: Do I want to hear any more of this story?",
        "Paul: Not much of a story to tell, really.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Craig warned me that you two couldn't keep your hands off of each other.",
        "Paul: Well, Craig, as usual, doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.",
        "Rosanna: Then how did the lipstick get there?",
        "Paul: She kissed me. Not because she wants me back, it's just a -- it's just a pathetic attempt to get her -- well, to get me to back off from Craig.",
        "Rosanna: You think Craig sent her here to seduce you?",
        "Paul: Well, I wouldn't put it past him. But this I know for sure, that kiss meant nothing to Meg.",
        "Rosanna: What about you? Did it mean anything to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You went to see Paul?",
        "Meg: Yes, I tried to get him to stop this vendetta he has against you. Unfortunately, it didn't do any good.",
        "Craig: Do not fight my battles for me, Meg. Thank you anyway.",
        "Meg: There's nothing to thank me for, believe me.",
        "Craig: What happened?",
        "Meg: Nothing. I had no effect on Paul whatsoever.",
        "Craig: I don't believe that's true. It wasn't long ago the man was madly in love with you.",
        "Meg: Well, he's not anymore. Now he cares about Rosanna and getting back at you.",
        "Craig: Did he upset you?",
        "Meg: I just thought, with our history, that I could get through to Paul on some level. But I couldn't.",
        "Craig: Just how did you try to get through to him? Tell me everything that happened. Don't try to protect me.",
        "Meg: I'm not hiding anything, Craig. I went to argue your case -- he wouldn't hear of it. That's all.",
        "Craig: So, why do I feel like you're still not telling me something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Krista: You got here fast.",
        "Lily: Time is money, right?",
        "Krista: Right. You said you wanted to help to get to the bottom of who killed Cheri. Tell me why you think that Dusty Donohue guy is innocent.",
        "Lily: Oh, Dusty Donovan.",
        "Krista: Do you know him? Is he an old trick, or what?",
        "Lily: No, no, no -- I just think the police arrested the first guy that they saw. Which means they have the wrong guy. And the real killer's out there somewhere. That's not good for any of us girls.",
        "Krista: That's right. But I still think it's strange that Cheri never mentioned you.",
        "Lily: No, you know Cheri, she didn't like talking about the past. But I will tell you one thing I didn't tell you the last time I saw you -- I know Cheri was married, had a child, and her real name was Charlene.",
        "Krista: That's right. Charlene Wilson. I seen her name on an old driver's license Cheri ripped up. She made me swear I'd never tell anyone she had a kid. But I saw a picture of the two of them when he was just a baby.",
        "Lily: Oh, I saw that picture, too.",
        "Krista: One time, Cheri took it out and told me how much she missed him. She said she wondered what he looked like, hoped he didn't have her face, so her ex wouldn't take his temper out on him.",
        "Lily: Sounds like the ex was a real nightmare.",
        "Krista: Keeping that boy away from his own mother the whole time he was growing up -- it was cruel.",
        "Lily: Cheri didn't deserve that.",
        "Krista: It's not like he was the first guy to catch his wife in the sack with another man.",
        "Lily: Oh, please --",
        "Krista: She didn't do it for money. She was lonely.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Poor Cheri.",
        "Krista: That ex had no pity. He took the kid, forced her to leave Georgia, and said if she ever came back, or tried to see the kid, he'd make her regret it.",
        "Lily: Sounds to me that you think the ex killed her.",
        "Krista: No, not him. If the guy they arrested didn't do it, I bet her son was the one that plugged her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, how are things going with you and Lily, hmm? Don't tell me you're still going at it?",
        "Holden: The last thing you need to worry about is Lily and me.",
        "Jack: Honestly? I don't worry about you. You're living proof that marriage can survive the odds.",
        "Holden: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Jack: You guys could get through anything. Are you kidding me? What -- what -- tell me this, what do you do when a couple can't see eye to eye before the wedding?",
        "Holden: Wait, I thought things were going well with you and Katie.",
        "Jack: They were. Until today.",
        "Holden: Is it Carly? What'd she do this time?",
        "Jack: For once, Carly's hands are clean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I suppose you're going to accuse me of stalking again, yeah?",
        "Saleswoman: Is she one of those freaky fans?",
        "Katie: No, she just hates me. What are you doing in my dress?",
        "Carly: Your dress?",
        "Katie: Yes. I just paid for it, it's mine. Do you mind telling her that you're holding it for me?",
        "Saleswoman: Yes, I tried to explain that to her, but she --",
        "Katie: Yeah, I can't believe the lengths that you would go to to get everything that belongs to me, right down to the very dress I was going to wear to my wedding shower.",
        "Carly: You know what? Do you know something? I don't want the dress. You can have it.",
        "Saleswoman: She did already pay. I'll let you two work this out.",
        "Katie: So, when we ran into you at the model apartment earlier, you just pretended to leave, didn't you? You were eavesdropping on Jack and me. Well, now you know that I want a baby and Jack doesn't, so I'm sure you're going to use that to try and stop the wedding.",
        "Carly: Are you insane? I have been trying to steer clear of you and Jack. And as far as the wedding goes, if something screws that up, it ain't going to be me. If you lose Jack, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself.",
        "Carly: Here you go. All yours. [A strap breaks and falls on the floor] Katie gasps] Ah, I oppose you're going to blame me for that, too, huh?",
        "Saleswoman: Can I put that in a bag for you?",
        "Katie: I don't know, I've got to go.",
        "Saleswoman: Just one sec. I hope you enjoy it. And good luck with the show.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "[Carly leans over a table]",
        "Saleswoman: Now, can I help you find something else? Ma'am, are you all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Could I have a glass of water, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, this is about Carly --",
        "Jack: It's not about Carly. I just want to make sure that my kids don't have their lives turned upside down again.",
        "Holden: You know what? That's one way of looking at it. But you can look at it another way, too. You know, having another child can make your family feel more secure. When we thought we lost Lily, having Ethan -- that was the only thing that got us through it.",
        "Jack: I remember when Sage was born. There was nothing like that.",
        "Holden: Honestly? I can't get enough of that feeling. And I don't think you can, either.",
        "Jack: You got a point.",
        "Holden: I'm not saying it's going to be easy. I guarantee you that there will be times when you say to yourself, \"What the hell was I thinking?\" But when you look at your kid's face, and you teach him how to ride that bike or catch that ball -- it doesn't get any better than that.",
        "Jack: You're right.",
        "Holden: I mean, that's what it's all about, isn't it? It's all about family. You've got to be careful not to mess that up. You know what? I'll be back.",
        "Jack: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: I've got to go take care of something. I think you should, too.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Krista: If he shot his own mother for doing what she had to do to make a living, well, it doesn't get any lower than that.",
        "Lily: Thank you for telling me this. Definitely some things to think about.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Krista: Damn, a new client. This is when I really miss Cheri. She used to screen these guys for us. Now, you never know who you're going to get.",
        "Lily: Oh, this should cover your rate. Tell him to take off.",
        "Krista: With pleasure.",
        "Lily: Call me if you think of anything else.",
        "Krista: Cross my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Jack: Well, I can't say that it goes with your outfit.",
        "Katie: That's okay. I love it.",
        "Jack: As for the wish, Darling --",
        "Katie: I don't think you're supposed to tell.",
        "Jack: Ah, I guess I'm just going to have to stick around until that thing falls off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What's wrong?",
        "Katie: When this fell off, it was supposed to mean that all of our wishes would come true. But that's not going to happen, because you don't want what I wished for.",
        "Jack: Actually, I do.",
        "Katie: You don't have to say that to make me feel better.",
        "Jack: I'm not.",
        "Katie: That's okay --",
        "Jack: Seriously. I thought about it, I changed my mind.",
        "Katie: Does that mean --",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. I want us to have a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: When Paul came home with Rosanna, he was different. He turned into someone I don't know.",
        "Craig: It's not the first time he's gotten obsessive about revenge, Meg.",
        "Meg: It was just never directed at me. Anyway, now that Rosanna's back, she is all that he cares about. And I went to see if his feelings for her were real, and I see now that they are.",
        "Craig: Paul and Rosanna was always difficult to compete with. I tried. I suppose that in the end, I didn't love Rosanna enough to keep trying. I guess when someone rejects you often enough, you finally get the message.",
        "Meg: Well, that's funny. Because I've rejected you, but you never gave up on me. You kept loving me no matter how much I pushed you away.",
        "Craig: I tried to give up on you, Meg. And I can't. I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: To your recovery.",
        "Rosanna: How about we toast to you answering my question?",
        "Paul: What question?",
        "Rosanna: About Meg.",
        "Paul: Meg and I were supposed to take Craig down together. And then, after Craig threw me over the cliff, she stayed married to him. And she lived in his house, and she rode around in his limousine, and she ran his company with him. And Meg Snyder sold herself to the highest bidder.",
        "Rosanna: Well, now that Craig doesn't have the money, or the limo, or the company, do you think that she'll stay with him?",
        "Paul: That, I don't know, I don't know. She came here to plead his case.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe -- maybe she didn't come here to plead his case. Maybe she came here because she wants you back.",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter if she does.",
        "Rosanna: Why not? Because of Craig?",
        "Paul: No, because of you. Rosanna, having you back has made me realize that my feelings for Meg were as false as the feelings that she said she had for me. Rosanna, I do love you. You are the only woman that I want. You are the only woman -- the only woman that I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Has Mr. Donovan returned yet?",
        "Desk clerk: Yes, I saw him go upstairs about ten minutes ago.",
        "Lily: Could you call him and have him meet me in the lounge? Thank you, Barry.",
        "Holden: Lily -- why are you dressed like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know, I should finish that salad.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know, I've got an appetite, too, but it's not for greens.",
        "Meg: You know, funny that you should say that. Because I was thinking, we need to come up with some green of our own, you know, the kind that buys things --",
        "Craig: Oh, I am one step ahead of you. I've just been on the phone with my lawyer. He has filed an injunction to unfreeze some of our assets. So at least we won't starve.",
        "Meg: So does that mean we'll be moving out of here?",
        "Craig: We will be back on our feet, Meg. And Rosanna and Paul won't keep us down.",
        "Meg: But they'll try.",
        "Craig: Let them. As long as I've got you by my side, I can handle anything that they throw at us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What -- what is it?",
        "Paul: I just -- I can't believe you're here.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I am.",
        "Paul: You're so beautiful.",
        "Rosanna: I'm never going to leave you again, Paul. Okay? I promise. What? [Rosanna laughs] You're killing me!",
        "Paul: No, no, you're -- you're recovering, and I don't want to push.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm walking now. I'm ready for anything, don't you agree?",
        "Paul: I thought you'd never ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't believe we're going to have babies together!",
        "Jack: Well, let's start with one.",
        "Katie: Okay --",
        "Jack: Please?",
        "Katie: I can start with one. Unless I happen to get pregnant with twins. And then we'd have a boy and girl -- that would be perfect.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah -- 3:00 A.M. feedings, diapers, teething -- all in stereo.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. Kind of making me exhausted just thinking about it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and you just can't wait.",
        "Katie: I can. I can wait at least a year, for the man of my dreams. I can't wait to marry you. The man who makes all of my dreams and wishes -- my wish -- came true! When this thing fell off, I thought it was a bad omen. But that must've been the exact moment that you changed your mind.",
        "Jack: That must've been.",
        "Katie: Unbelievable. These things really work.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I guess they do. But you know what the secret is, I think the secret is when two people are meant to be, like you and me -- then there's just no stopping us. [Cell phone rings] I spoke too soon. Hold on, just a second. Yeah, it's the station. They need notes from me on a stake. They're in my car. I'll be right back.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God! How long were you eavesdropping this time, Carly?",
        "Carly: I wasn't --",
        "Katie: Oh, well, just in case you didn't hear the good news, Jack wants to have a baby with me after all. We're going to have a nice, big family, and I can't wait.",
        "Carly: Congratulations.",
        "Jack: All right, I'm all yours. Carly, what's going on? [Carly faints] Carly? Carly!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lily: I hate lying to my husband. But it's going to be worth it if we can prove that you're innocent.",
        "Dusty: I'll prove it. You go back to your husband. And thank you.",
        "Gwen: Alison offered to be a donor, so we could try and have another baby.",
        "Will: You know, if you want to bail, now would be the time.",
