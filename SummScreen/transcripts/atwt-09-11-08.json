Jack covers but Carly knows he is hiding something and is determined to discover what Jack is hiding that has him acting so strangely. Carly advises Janet that making Jack break his strict code of ethics even if it is for a good cause could cause the end of their relationship.

        "Paul: You might want to get out of the way, Mike!",
        "Mike: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Paul: You have spent weeks supervising this project, and where has it gotten us? Nowhere!",
        "Mike: You are the one who shut the project down and sent the crew home!",
        "Paul: I'm in charge here, Mike!",
        "Mike: Do you even know what you're doing besides putting a big hole in the ground?",
        "Paul: I said move!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You don't have any idea where Paul went?",
        "Meg: He said he was gonna be right back. Maybe I should call him again.",
        "Emma: No, no. I think he's capable of taking care of himself. It's you, you sweet girl, that I'm worried about, and that sweet little life inside you.",
        "Meg: Okay, Mama, look, I have been as quiet as a mouse since we got here, and believe me, seeing Aaron and Alison get married is exactly what the doctor ordered.",
        "Emma: Fine, fine. Now I'm gonna take you home.",
        "Meg: No. I should wait for Paul.",
        "Emma: Paul? You can wait for Paul at home! Don't you give me any lip, young lady. Okay, I'm gonna go say so long to Lily. Now, you sit here, and I'll be right back.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Have you lost your mind?",
        "Paul: Listen to me, Mike. You see this land? Everywhere you see is poisoned. And I promised Meg -- I promised Emma that I would clean it up! I gave them my word!",
        "Mike: I know that, Paul. I've been here since day one, remember?",
        "Paul: They're counting on me! This is their home! They're not gonna lose their home because of me!",
        "Mike: Listen to me. You are not going to fix anything by doing this.",
        "Paul: Once I get what I'm looking for, I'll be sure to put all of this back for you.",
        "Mike: What are you looking for? What is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You've done the right thing, Henry. And thanks to your reassurance, the lovely Ms. Hyatt and Ms. McKechnie are safe and sound.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Why doesn't that put me at ease? Oh, I know. It's because it's coming from you.",
        "James: Oh, no paranoia, please, Henry.",
        "Henry: James, you have me locked up in your son's wine cellar, okay? We passed paranoia a few miles back.",
        "James: I like you, Henry. You -- you amuse me.",
        "Henry: I swear, if you do anything to hurt Bonnie and Vienna --",
        "James: I have made it very clear -- I have no interest in harming either one of those young ladies, okay? Actually, your call was an act of mercy. Vienna thinks you're running around the world gambling, so there's no chance she'll come looking for you.",
        "Henry: And if she does?",
        "James: Oh, that wouldn't be good for any of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I don't understand. You're saying Henry said he was playing some blackjack, and that is some kind of S.O.S.?",
        "Vienna: I told you, he doesn't play blackjack!",
        "Bonnie: So, what if he's trying something new? Get a hold of yourself! Come on. If he was in trouble, he wouldn't have even called you.",
        "Vienna: No!",
        "Bonnie: You're just overreacting, as usual.",
        "Vienna: No, he was sending me a message. I heard it in his voice. I gotta find him!",
        "Bonnie: Okay, obsess about this. Give yourself some nice, deep worry lines. Please, please do.",
        "Vienna: No. What if he's gambling away our share in Metro? You could be out of work!",
        "Derek: Well, I would certainly support that if it frees your evenings for me. We still on for the game tonight?",
        "Bonnie: Absolutely, and I cannot wait to get out of here. Let me just grab my purse.",
        "Vienna: You -- you're a thug, right?",
        "Derek: Excuse me?",
        "Vienna: I think that's the right word. You know, somebody who threatens people in order to get what he wants.",
        "Bonnie: Vienna! You'll just have to excuse her. She thinks her accent gives her a free pass to just say whatever she wants!",
        "Vienna: Henry told me that you are a dangerous man, and if you are, you can help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Don't be an ass!",
        "Meg: Paul, Mike! Stop! Stop it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: That shoot was brutal.",
        "Katie: We did completely miss Alison and Aaron's wedding.",
        "Brad: We'll send them something really expensive. They won't even care that we were no-shows.",
        "Katie: Always thinking.",
        "Brad: That's me. And you know what I'm thinking right now?",
        "Katie: Gee, let me guess.",
        "Brad: I want to take a nice, long, hot shower followed by a nice, long, hot nap with my wife.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Hell yeah!",
        "Katie: Where did this come from?",
        "Brad: My wife is hot! Hello. Got my life back. This whole Leo thing has been hell on both of us, and now that the evidence is, you know -- taken care of.",
        "Katie: Thanks to Jack.",
        "Brad: Yes. Thanks to Jack, I'm the luckiest guy on earth. I don't have to dread prison or leaving you. I want to celebrate. Starting now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah, and tell the lab to put a rush on the Morrissey evidence. The prints we picked up from the pay phone are gonna I.D. the 911 caller, and if my hunch is right, it's the same person who is responsible for the victim's near-drowning.",
        "Dallas: You gotta love the hunch.",
        "Margo: Where is it?",
        "Dallas: Where's what?",
        "Margo: The file, the evidence. There's nothing in the file.",
        "Dallas: Wait, no, that's impossible. I put it in there myself!",
        "Margo: And did you remove it yourself?",
        "Dallas: No. And the only other person that looked at Leo's file was Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Boy, I thought my family could bulldoze a buffet, but you Snyders take the cake! There's hardly any food left after that wedding.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that -- that was good food.",
        "Janet: You gonna tell me where you went?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: During the reception. You disappeared. I couldn't find you.",
        "Jack: Emma asked me to check on something. I didn't think I was gone that long.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Margo: Jack, its Margo. We got a situation. I need you to come down to the station.",
        "Jack: Sure, I'll be right there.",
        "Janet: Who was that?",
        "Jack: It was Margo. She asked me to come down to the station.",
        "Janet: But it's your day off. Do you think this has something to do with Leo?",
        "Jack: I'm sure it's nothing. I get calls like this all the time. All the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: That was the best wedding ever.",
        "Carly: It was, huh?",
        "Sage: I bet if you and Dad had another one, it would be even better.",
        "Carly: Sage, that's not gonna happen.",
        "Sage: I know, but sometimes, I want to think it could.",
        "Carly: You know, I just realized, Honey, that your father never signed your permission slip for field hockey. I was gonna bring it to him.",
        "Sage: I need that for tomorrow.",
        "Carly: I know you do. You know, I could bring it over to him right now if that's okay. You could stay at the Lebos'.",
        "Sage: It's okay. I could tell them all about the wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Stop it, both of you! Come here. What is going on?",
        "Mike: Why don't you ask your husband? He's completely lost it.",
        "Paul: Me? You shouldn't even be here, Mike. I shut this whole project down! Get lost!",
        "Mike: I am here because Emma asked me to come here. She heard noise at the wedding reception. It happened to be Paul digging up this place with a backhoe!",
        "Meg: Is that why you left?",
        "Paul: Well, I had to. Look, Mike's botched this whole place up! I'm just trying to fix things.",
        "Mike: Paul, you're not fixing anything. Look at yourself!",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm fine. Did you walk here all the way from Lily's house?",
        "Meg: I'm fine.",
        "Paul: You're supposed to stay off your feet.",
        "Meg: And the baby is fine! I just got tired of waiting for you to come back and wondering, \"What would be so much more important than being with me at the wedding?\"",
        "Paul: I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: No, no. Stop, stop, okay? No, no! I don't know what you're going through, Paul, but you're in no condition to drive me home. Mike, can you take us to Fairwinds?",
        "Paul: No, no! Absolutely not.",
        "Meg: I am not arguing with you, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You cannot just go around calling people names.",
        "Vienna: I wasn't calling him names. I asked him a question. A man like you, you must know things.",
        "Bonnie: She thinks that you know where Henry is, and you don't.",
        "Vienna: But you can help me figure it out, can't you? You must know where gentlemen in Oakdale go to gamble.",
        "Derek: Vienna, I'm a legitimate businessman. I respect the law. But, occasionally, I have had to entertain clients above and beyond what might be considered appropriate. With Bonnie's permission, I could make a few phone calls on your behalf.",
        "Vienna: Well, give him your permission.",
        "Bonnie: Are we gonna still be able to see the Bears play tonight?",
        "Derek: You have my word. I mean, come on, don't you want to help your friend?",
        "Bonnie: Just make the call.",
        "Vienna: Thank you, Derek.",
        "Bonnie: Thank you. And, for the record, you are not my friend.",
        "Vienna: And, for the record, your boyfriend -- he's a thug.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: To show my appreciation of your cooperation earlier, I've prepared lunch for you. A little something I picked up during my time in Bangkok.",
        "Henry: They gave you cooking classes in prison? Wow. Some guys get all the breaks. Smells delicious.",
        "James: Well, let's say it is. Its noodles, kinpara gobo, and sesame seeds.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. I see the Thai noodles there. That looks great. You know, if you ever give up on this whole Machiavellian thing, you'd make a hell of a chef.",
        "James: Eat.",
        "Henry: Vienna and Bonnie, I have your word that they will be okay?",
        "James: Any reason to doubt me so far?",
        "Henry: James Stenbeck is asking me to trust him? What do you do? What do you do with that?",
        "James: You know, Vienna would want you to eat, so eat. Oh, very good. Very good. You've started with my favorite -- the fugu.",
        "Henry: The fugu?",
        "James: Yes, fugu is a very special species of Japanese blowfish.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. I've heard of it.",
        "James: Then you're aware that one bite can be fatal unless, of course, it's prepared properly. You know, I worked for months to learn how to prepare this particular dish. Do try it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime delicacy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What are you doing? My back is not gonna wash itself.",
        "Katie: Is that all I am to you -- a pair of soapy hands?",
        "Brad: Yeah, my own little loofah sponge.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Katie: You gonna get that?",
        "Brad: No, I'm not.",
        "Katie: What if it's Liberty?",
        "Brad: What if it's a telemarketer?",
        "Katie: Well, whoever it is, just get it.",
        "Brad: Talk fast. Naked here.",
        "Janet: Uh, ew. Okay, thanks. Listen, I'm sorry to bother you, but there is something I need to talk to you about.",
        "Brad: Janet, is it Liberty?",
        "Janet: No, no. It's not Liberty. It's Jack. Margo called and wanted him to come down to the station.",
        "Brad: So?",
        "Janet: So?! Today's his day off!",
        "Brad: Did he say why she wanted to see him?",
        "Janet: No. But I've got a knot in my stomach the size of Texas. I'm worried about this.",
        "Brad: Well, obviously, you think it's about Leo's case.",
        "Janet: Don't you?",
        "Brad: No, no. I mean, Jack said he took care of it.",
        "Janet: He did. I know he did.",
        "Brad: Well, there's nothing to worry about. Whatever the police had, they don't have it anymore.",
        "Janet: No, they don't.",
        "Brad: Jack's a cop. He gets calls like this all the time.",
        "Janet: That's what he said.",
        "Brad: Listen, I got to go. I'll call you later.",
        "Katie: So, Janet, what did she want?",
        "Brad: Listen. Shower's running. Water's wasting, my little loofah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Explain this to me. Evidence in an ongoing open investigation is missing. I'm coming up blank.",
        "Jack: Perhaps somebody already sent it down to the lab.",
        "Dallas: Negative. I just checked with the lab. They never got it.",
        "Margo: So, Gentlemen, let's start at the beginning.",
        "Dallas: Okay. Like I said, I put the file together, and then I gave it to Jack to take a look at.",
        "Margo: Jack?",
        "Jack: I glanced at it. Nothing jumped out at me.",
        "Margo: I'm not asking for your analysis.",
        "Jack: I guess I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Margo: Jack, you were the last person to see this file intact. I want to know when that was.",
        "Jack: Are you accusing me of something here?",
        "Margo: Jack.",
        "Jack: Listen, I'm sorry about your damn evidence, Margo, but after Parker was cleared in Liberty's attack, I stopped caring what happened to Leo Morrissey.",
        "Margo: Really? Well, then, we've got a problem here.",
        "Margo: This is great. This is great. We got a kid who almost drowned, he's in a coma, and now he wakes up and he doesn't remember anything that happened to him. And all the evidence we've got to go on is missing! Now, this is all happening on my watch?",
        "Dallas: You know, we could try recanvassing the area.",
        "Margo: No, we can't recanvas the area. Any evidence we find now will be compromised.",
        "Jack: We don't even know that the evidence we had pointed to anyone.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Jack. I don't think that Leo Morrissey threw himself into that body of water, nor do I think he pulled himself out!",
        "Jack: Why does it even matter, Margo? The kid tried to drug a young woman and tried to rape her.",
        "Margo: And frame your son for it. No matter what sleazy thing this kid did, he's still the victim of a crime himself. So, yes, that matters to me, Jack, and the badge on your belt says it should matter to you, too.",
        "Jack: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Good. Find my damn evidence and close the case.",
        "Carly: Bad time, huh?",
        "Jack: I think you could say that, yeah.",
        "Carly: What's going on here, Jack? A few days ago, all you cared about was finding out what happened to that Morrissey boy at the Reservoir. Now you don't even care that the evidence is missing. What gives?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Get him out -- get out of here! And don't you ever come near that job site again!",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, hey, it's okay!",
        "Mike: Are you sure? With the state he's in?",
        "Meg: I can handle it.",
        "Mike: Okay. If you need anything, call me.",
        "Meg: You are scaring me, Paul. I mean it. What has gotten into you?",
        "Paul: That guy bugs me.",
        "Meg: I don't think this has anything to do with Mike.",
        "Paul: It's got everything to do with Mike. This whole project's falling apart. It's all his fault. And I made a promise to your family that I would make sure this deal went through, and he's in my way.",
        "Meg: Nobody's in your way but you.",
        "Paul: You're right. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm really trying. I just want to be the man that you want me to be. I want to be the husband that you deserve. I want to be the father of your children that you deserve. Right now, I don't think I'm even coming close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Well? Well?",
        "Henry: I'm not dead yet. My compliments to the chef, I guess.",
        "James: Good. Well, I'll leave you to enjoy the rest of your meal in peace.",
        "Henry: Where are you going?",
        "James: Don't worry about me. I'll be back.",
        "Henry: And maybe I will be one step closer to being gone when you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: So, I have a lead on a game.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you do? Where is it?",
        "Derek: In one of the warehouses along the waterfront.",
        "Bonnie: Why am I not surprised? It's such a wonderful part of town.",
        "Derek: So, I have the address. Only problem is, I don't really know that area very well.",
        "Vienna: Well, just give it to me. I'll find it.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, wait, hold on, hold on. You don't even know if Henry's there.",
        "Derek: Well, my contact told me, a man matching Henry's description was seen entering the building yesterday.",
        "Vienna: Oh, God. My poor Henry. Where is it? Tell me!",
        "Derek: I will, but I would better about this if you weren't going alone.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, oh, hold on. Hold on. You are gonna go with her? What about our plans!",
        "Derek: We can still make it.",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no. So, you expect me just to wait here while you go off with her?",
        "Derek: No, no, no. Come with us. We'll find Henry, and as soon as we do, I promise, the rest of the night will belong to us.",
        "Vienna: Well, she agrees. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't want to fail. I don't want to fail you. I don't want to fail this baby.",
        "Meg: You won't. Every day I'm with you, I find another reason to love you. I find another reason to want you to be the father of my children. And you know what? It has nothing to do with eco-friendly housing.",
        "Paul: No?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: It doesn't?",
        "Meg: No, it doesn't. It has everything to do with how much I love you, how much I believe in you.",
        "Paul: What? Here, sit down. Come here.",
        "Meg: He just moved. Or she moved. Here, feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This isn't like you, Jack. It's not Jack Snyder to ignore the fact that there is evidence missing from one of his cases!",
        "Jack: Number one, it's not my case. Number two, why do you even care?",
        "Carly: I care because Leo Morrissey almost put our son in jail and because, at one time, you were quite anxious to know what happened up at that reservoir and who was responsible!",
        "Jack: Well, after living with it for a while, I've decided that, after what he put Parker and Liberty through, I don't care what happens to Leo Morrissey.",
        "Carly: Jack, you're lying. You know, you're usually very good at separating the professional from the personal, but right now you're doing a lousy job.",
        "Jack: Is there another reason you're here, other than to give me a hard time?",
        "Carly: I would like to talk about what happened between us at the wedding.",
        "Jack: I can't get into that now.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, maybe you have time for this. They need both our signatures on this permission slip for Sage.",
        "Jack: Fine. Anything else? No? Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, I feel terrible you had to come to the job site and look for me today. I'd feel a whole lot better if you were just upstairs, getting some rest.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe all those kicks really do mean, \"Hey, Mommy, go up there and lie down, will you?\"",
        "Paul: That's my boy. Smart boy.",
        "Meg: Yeah, just like his daddy.",
        "James: You're making a lot of promises, Paul. I'm curious, how do you intend to keep those promises without my help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: This is it?",
        "Vienna: It seems so deserted.",
        "Bonnie: Well, what did you expect? Nobody advertises an illegal card game.",
        "Vienna: I can't believe that my Henry's been here the whole time.",
        "Bonnie: Can we go? We found the warehouse. Can we just let Vienna drag Henry out on her own?",
        "Derek: I want to check it out first, just to make sure it's safe. You two wait here. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Can make a martini blindfolded and with your hands tied behind your back, but you can't pick a lock, Henry? What kid of man are you? Let's see. What is Morse code for \"Help? I'm being held hostage by a psychopath\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You want to help me? Why don't you give me the money I need instead of sending me on some stupid scavenger hunt to find a buried treasure that I don't think is even there? I don't have time for this. I've got a loan shark circling me and my family all because of you.",
        "James: Paul, Paul. If you need to buy yourself some time with this shark, why don't you give him this?",
        "Paul: Where'd you get that?",
        "James: Well, when I buried the gold on the Snyder farm, I just kept a little something for myself. You want it? It's yours.",
        "Meg: Paul? Hey.",
        "Paul: Why aren't you upstairs resting?",
        "Meg: Well, I was trying to, but there was all this banging from the pipes coming from the basement. Didn't you hear it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi, Katie, Brad. I need to talk to you.",
        "Brad: Well, now is not really a good time.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry about that. I really am. But I'm not leaving.",
        "Katie: What's going on?",
        "Carly: Something is wrong with Jack, and I think you know what it is.",
        "Brad: So, why do you think something's wrong with Jack?",
        "Carly: Well, I just saw him at the station, and he was not acting like himself. He was really getting into it with Margo.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Carly: They were arguing about a case.",
        "Brad: Well, it probably happens like ten times a day.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, Brad, evidence does not disappear every day.",
        "Katie: Evidence disappeared? That's why they were fighting?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Evidence in the Leo Morrissey case. I think you know something about it.",
        "Brad: You know, what I don't get is why you're up in Jack's business all of a sudden.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Brad: I mean, you're not his wife anymore.",
        "Carly: I'm well aware of that.",
        "Brad: You know, so, I mean -- I just don't understand why you're all worked up about Jack being in a bad mood.",
        "Carly: No, it's not a mood. Brad, there's something about this case that is really eating him up inside. I can tell!",
        "Brad: Okay, I don't -- I don't know how to say this, Carly, but you're not the expert on Jack anymore. He's with Janet. He's happy. So, his moods are really none of your concern.",
        "Carly: I don't know why you're giving me the runaround, or why you're being so damn quiet all of a sudden, but I know you know something, and I am gonna find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Good, you got my message. Do you want some coffee?",
        "Jack: No, I'm fine.",
        "Janet: You don't look fine. What happened with Margo? What did she want?",
        "Jack: She wanted to ask me some questions.",
        "Janet: About what? Come on, Jack. Don't shut me out.",
        "Jack: About the missing evidence, Janet.",
        "Janet: Does she know that you --",
        "Jack: No. I told her I didn't know what happened to it, and I made it -- I made it seem like I didn't care, and it made me sick to my stomach.",
        "Janet: I hate this.",
        "Jack: She's not only my boss, okay. Margo is my friend. I lied to her.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry. But you didn't lie to her. Not really.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, you tell that to my gut.",
        "Janet: Come on, Jack! You don't know where it is! You don't know what happened to it!",
        "Jack: Pure, pure technicality!",
        "Janet: You did what you had to do to protect your family.",
        "Jack: No, don't start making excuses for me, okay? Please, don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Carly's not gonna let this go.",
        "Brad: She's not gonna find out anything. She can nose around all she wants. I mean, Jack's not gonna say anything to her. The guy's a vault.",
        "Katie: That's not the point. I don't think we should have asked him to help us.",
        "Brad: What were we supposed to do, ask Margo?",
        "Katie: No! But you know your brother! He can't be dishonest. He can't hide things. That's not in his nature!",
        "Brad: Maybe not, but he sure knows how to be in denial, and you know that better than anybody, and that's all he has to do is just deny everything.",
        "Katie: All right, fine. So you think that it's fair, what we asked him to do?",
        "Brad: No. No, I don't think any of this is fair, but I didn't do it just for me. I did it for us. I made a promise to you that I was never gonna leave you. I love you.",
        "Katie: I love you, too.",
        "Brad: And Liberty, I'm not gonna let her live any more of her life without a father.",
        "Katie: See, that's just it. Jack has kids, too, and a job. And if this gets out, he's gonna go to prison, along with you.",
        "Brad: Listen, it's not gonna come out! It won't! I'm telling you, it won't come out. Okay, maybe it was selfish. Yes, it was selfish for me to ask him to destroy the evidence. But if that's gonna keep my family together, I'm not gonna feel bad about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't hear anything.",
        "Meg: Okay, so you think I'm going crazy again?",
        "Paul: I'm the last person to ask about crazy right now.",
        "Meg: I swear, Paul, it was so loud. It sounded like it was on purpose.",
        "Paul: It's a big, old house, Meg. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you about the pipes, but it stopped now. Get some rest.",
        "Meg: Okay, you're right. Come tuck me in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Not smart, Henry! Making all that noise. I thought you would appreciate my hospitality.",
        "Henry: Just answer me one question, okay? What do you want from me? Why do you have me locked up down here?",
        "James: That's two questions.",
        "Henry: Look, I know you have some grand plan for Paul, okay? I just don't see how I fit into that.",
        "James: I have no grand plan. No hidden agenda. I'm simply trying to help out my son.",
        "Henry: Right. I'm simply here for the ambiance.",
        "James: You know, Henry, if you're lucky enough to have a son one day, you'll understand. So, until then --",
        "Henry: Until then, what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Oh, my gosh! There's a bug!",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God!",
        "Bonnie: That's a really big bug! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh, your shoes!",
        "Vienna: See, that's how much I love Henry.",
        "Bonnie: That's a whole lot of love. Great, great.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Bonnie: We are missing the game. Thank you so much, Vienna. Thank you for ruining my date with Derek.",
        "Vienna: It's not my fault that your boyfriend wants to help me rather than spending time alone with you.",
        "Bonnie: Well, if your boyfriend didn't spend his nights gambling with creepy strangers, then we wouldn't even be here right now.",
        "Vienna: It's a sickness!",
        "Bonnie: You got that right.",
        "Vienna: Okay, this is ridiculous. Derek should have been out by now. I'm going in.",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no, no. You aren't going in without me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Please don't do this, Jack. Don't second-guess yourself. I know you're struggling with what you've done, but I promise you, it's the best thing for everybody.",

        "Janet: No, please! Stay! Jack!",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Carly: Could I talk to you for a minute about Jack, please?",
        "Janet: You know, I don't really think that's a good idea. You know how private he is.",
        "Carly: Something is bothering him. It's obvious.",
        "Janet: He's tired. He's been working a lot lately. Between that, the wedding, and helping out at the farm. Don't worry about it.",
        "Carly: That's good. You're good. And if I were anybody else, I might actually believe you.",
        "Janet: Look, if you're here to get territorial on me, I'm really not --",
        "Carly: I'm not, Janet. I'm not. It's just that I know Jack. He is a very honest man. And if you want to love him -- if you really want to love him, you have to accept what that means.",
        "Janet: I get it. Yeah, I hear you, loud and clear.",
        "Carly: I don't know that you do. Jack lives by a very strict code, and if you ask him to break that code even once, even with the very best intentions, it will destroy your relationship.",
        "Janet: Is that what happened with you guys?",
        "Carly: Many times. I know the signs, Janet, and I see them now.",
        "Janet: I appreciate what you're trying to do, really, but Jack and me, we're not like you guys.",
        "Carly: I hope not. Because another thing about Jack, he doesn't change. Not for anybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How you doing?",
        "Jack: I'm drinking.",
        "Katie: Carly came by.",
        "Jack: She's everywhere today.",
        "Katie: She told us what happened at the station with Margo. Brad doesn't seem to think it's a problem, but I'm worried that she's not gonna let it go.",
        "Jack: Would you stop worrying, please? She tried to get me to open up, too, and I shut her down.",
        "Katie: That must not have been easy.",
        "Jack: I did what I had to do.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry that we put you in this position, Jack.",
        "Jack: It's all right.",
        "Katie: No, it's not! Are you really okay with what you've done?",
        "Jack: It's a little late to be asking that question, don't you think?",
        "Katie: I'm just -- I hate myself for dragging you into this! I don't know what I was thinking!",
        "Jack: Then why'd you do it?",
        "Katie: I was petrified! I am petrified for Brad, for me. I didn't know where else to go.",
        "Jack: But you knew you could count on me, right? Good old, dependable Jack.",
        "Katie: I never should have asked you to keep secrets. Brad never should have asked you to bury evidence. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you did. You did, though. You both did. And I did. And it's done. I appreciate the apology, but I think it's better if we never talk about this again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So, what can I do for you?",
        "Margo: Well, as you know, Leo Morrissey is out of his coma, and, so, we're in the process of building a case against him for the drugging and the attempted assault of your daughter.",
        "Brad: Good, good. Yeah, that's good. Is that it?",
        "Margo: Well, no. I would like to talk to Liberty about what happened.",
        "Brad: Well, you know, she already gave a statement to you guys.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. But I have a couple more questions.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I just don't want her to have to go through, you know -- remember what happened.",
        "Margo: I know, I'm sorry. I understand your hesitancy here.",
        "Brad: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Margo: No, I do. I do. I assure you, I know how to handle this. I'm not gonna push her. I'm not gonna say anything to upset her.",
        "Brad: No, I said no, Margo.",
        "Margo: Do you understand that, if this goes to trial, Liberty's gonna have to testify.",
        "Brad: No, absolutely not. I'm not gonna put her through something like that.",
        "Margo: What is the matter with you, Brad? If you don't let me talk to her, there's every chance that Leo's gonna get away with this. Is that what you want?",
        "Brad: Well, if that happens -- if that happens, then that's on you.",
        "Margo: Brad, what, Brad!",
        "Brad: Listen, this is a family matter, and that's exactly how we're gonna keep it. And I'm just asking you to respect that, Margo. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry! Hello? Answer me!",
        "Bonnie: Is that all you can do is screech? Derek! Where is he?",
        "Vienna: I don't know, but I don't think there's any card games here.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, no kidding. Okay, okay, fine. You are on your own. This place is just giving me the creeps. Derek is probably outside waiting for me. Good luck finding him, okay? What the hell? It's locked.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not. Move over. It's locked.",
        "Bonnie: No? Really? Who would want to lock us in here? My boyfriend's a thug.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Did you have any problems?",
        "Derek: No, no. The women were eager to comply.",
        "Henry: The women? Okay, you better not be talking about Bonnie and Vienna. What have you done to them?",
        "James: They're fine, Henry. They're just fine.",
        "Henry: You promised me you wouldn't hurt them! You promised me, James!",
        "James: And I kept my promise. In fact, they'll have each other for some companionship.",

        "Meg: Mike? Why are you back?",
        "Mike: Hey, I came back to talk to Paul. The maid said he went out, wasn't sure where.",
        "Meg: Well, I was upstairs resting. Is everything all right?",
        "Mike: That depends on what you mean by all right. Are you all right? I mean, Paul was pretty wound up earlier.",
        "Meg: Yeah. He's calmed down. I was able to talk to him. He's just put a lot of pressure on himself to make this project a success. I think he's at his breaking point.",
        "Mike: Yeah. Look, there's something I think you should know.",
        "Meg: Okay, what?",
        "Mike: I just went back to the site to collect my things and have a look around. It turns out, the damage -- just, all the digging that Paul did uncovered massive structural damage that we didn't even know existed. That's why I came back. I came back to tell Paul that they're gonna have to shut it down.",
        "Meg: What? Are you sure?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah. Tell him, if he has any questions, he can call one of the engineers. And if you -- if you need anything anytime, you can call me, okay? I'm here for you.",
        "Meg: Thank you, but I have Paul. I have everything I need.",

        "Carly: If you don't do the right thing, you will never be able to live with yourself.",
        "Brad: If the evidence doesn't exist, it would be like Jack never took it.",
