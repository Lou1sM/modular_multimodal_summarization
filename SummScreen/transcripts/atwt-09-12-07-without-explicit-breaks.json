        "Susan is stunned when she finds out that Allison offered to be Will and Gwen's donor. Sophie feels her baby move and shares it with Aaron. Lily, dressed up to meet Christa, bumps into Holden and pretends that she dressed up to come look for him. Jack is afraid when he tries to rouse an unconscious Carly, but after she comes to, she claims she was faking. Jack and Katie are livid and Brad wonders where she will draw the line, all of them unaware that Carly isn't faking. Susan is worried about the ramifications of Allison being the donor and reminds them of the trouble Emily had, but Allison is determined. Holden and Lily make love. Carly pretends that this was a ploy to get Jack, but when she later almost passes out again, Brad realizes she really isn't well. Allison assures Will and Gwen that she wants to do this for them more then anything, but Will is nervous that they can't be let down again, as Gwen is on cloud nine as she sees her dreams coming true. Sophie tells Aaron that she is going to tell Cole that night about her being pregnant. Right after Holden asks Lily for them to put each other first, Lily secretly calls Dusty and asks him to meet her outside her room. Aaron learns of Allison's generous offer from Gwen. Lily meets Dusty outside and tells him what she found out from Christa about Cheri's real name and how her son might have something against her. Lily doesn't want to stop helping him, even though Dusty reminds her that Holden is angry about this, but she thinks it will be ok in the end once they prove his innocence. Carly tells Brad that she has something wrong with her \u0096 a broken heart. She pushes Brad out the door right before she collapses on the floor. Aaron goes to see Allison, which thrills her, to tell her how brave and proud of her that he is. Holden tells Lily that he was out of line when he forgot her and Dusty's history, but that wasn't really what upset him, but rather that she was keeping things from him, as Lily looks guilty. He wants her to promise not to do that anymore. Jack, Katie, Lily and Holden toast to their marriage and upcoming marriage. Cole is angry after he quits his job and pulls away from Sophie, causing her to fall. Aaron sees this and blurts out about Sophie being pregnant. Brad finds an unconscious Carly on the floor, but she awakens and demands he not call an ambulance. She claims she has a bug, but until she sees a doctor, she asks Brad to keep this to himself."

        "Will: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Oh, we're good. You know, I don't know if I -- I don't know if I actually ever properly thanked you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been willing to come by when I was miscarrying.",
        "Will: I guess making house calls runs in the family.",
        "Alison: Hi, Mom.",
        "Susan: Hey, Alison. What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Oh, I just dropped off some food from Al's. I figured Gwen and will wouldn't, like, you know, feel like cooking.",
        "Susan: Oh, that was so thoughtful!",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's been really, really great.",
        "Susan: I heard you two talked to dr. Akido about -- certain options?",
        "Gwen: You know, we've -- I've explained everything to Alison, so you can say what you need to say.",
        "Susan: Oh, okay. Dr. Akido told me that you've decided to try in-vitro fertilization with an egg donor. I just wanted to be sure that you understand, this is not a simple process.",
        "Will: Yeah, dr. Akido said that it might be a long process.",
        "Susan: And very frustrating. You have to find a donor, first of all -- a viable donor. And that could take months. You have to put your names on a long waiting list.",
        "Alison: Actually, mom, they're going to be able to skip that part. They have a donor.",
        "Susan: Really? How did you find one so quickly?",
        "Will: We kind of had a friend step up for us.",
        "Susan: Oh -- do you mind if I ask who?",
        "Alison: Me.",
        "[Sofie gasps]",
        "Aaron: You okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. Yeah, I just felt the baby move. I mean, I think that's what it was. It was like -- like a little flutter. Do you want to see if you can feel it, too? Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, I'm not freaked out.",
        "Sofie: Are you sure?",
        "Aaron: No. That's actually pretty cool.",
        "Sofie: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Ooh, there it is. Oh, that's pretty cool.",
        "Sofie: Isn't it?",
        "Aaron: That's hard to imagine that little butterfly is going to be a bump pretty soon, huh? A little baby.",
        "Sofie: It suddenly feels so real. I mean, finally sharing it with someone else.",
        "Aaron: You still haven't told Cole that you're pregnant?",
        "Sofie: Not yet.",
        "Aaron: Well, lucky you. Because in about a minute, you're going to get your chance.",
        "Lily: I was just about to call you. How did you know I was here?",
        "Holden: Lily, you didn't answer my question. What are you doing dressed like that?",
        "Lily: Way to make a girl feel sexy, Holden. I did it for you.",
        "Jack: Carly? Hey, hey -- can you hear me? Huh? Are you okay? There you are.",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm right here. What -- what just happened?",
        "Carly: I don't know. One minute I was standing, and now I'm not.",
        "Jack: Don't, don't, don't -- don't get up too fast. Just take a couple of deep breaths for me, okay? Okay.",
        "Brad: What's going on?",
        "Katie: Carly fainted. Surprise, surprise.",
        "Brad: Fainted from what?",
        "Katie: Lack of a better idea, maybe? She seemed perfectly fine earlier this afternoon when she followed me to the sample sale and tried to buy the dress that I wanted.",
        "Jack: She did? Carly, I consider myself a rather patient man, but you are really starting to wear me out.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Jack. I shouldn't have tried to put one over on you.",
        "Jack: So, you admit it? This was just another -- another play for attention?",
        "Carly: What can I say? An opportunity presented itself and I took it -- I wanted to get your attention, yeah. I'm sorry. Could you -- could you help --",
        "Jack: It's got to stop, Carly. It really does. It's just -- Katie and I are getting married, and none of these tricks are going to change that. So, would you stop, please? Following us and fainting, and trying to make me jealous?",
        "Carly: You're right, yeah.",
        "Jack: What if the kids had been here? What if they would have seen this? What were they supposed to get from this? That scheming is a perfectly fine way of getting what you want? Carly, what good does that do any of us?",
        "Carly: None. No good. You're absolutely right.",
        "Jack: Okay, then if you mean that, cut it out. Katie and I are getting married. You're just going to have to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Susan: You cannot volunteer to be an egg donor. It's out of the question.",
        "Alison: I already did, mom. And besides, I think that's my decision.",
        "Susan: Well, obviously, you haven't thought it through.",
        "Gwen: Maybe will and I should give you two some time alone.",
        "Susan: No, this concerns all three of you.",
        "Alison: I can't believe you're coming down on me like this. I'd have thought you, of all people, would be a little more sympathetic.",
        "Susan: Honey, I am sympathetic. I know what it's like to want a baby more than anything on earth.",
        "Alison: And you'd never have had that if Emily hadn't been willing to give you one of her eggs. So if I can do that for will and Gwen, that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Susan: Honey, it's not that simple.",
        "Alison: It's a lot easier than when you did it, mom. I've checked online. They do it now with an ultrasound. I can be put to sleep.",
        "Will: If you're worried about whether it's safe for Alison or not, we're not going to take any chances.",
        "Gwen: We'll do all the right tests to make sure that she's healthy.",
        "Susan: Of course you will, memorial will demand it. It's just -- I'm not sure that it's the right time for Alison to put herself through this.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Susan: Because, even if you are a viable donor, and you're physically up for it, have you thought about the emotional ramifications? Have any of you? This is not some simple medical procedure that you do over the course of few months. If you do this, the three of you will be tied together for the rest of your lives. Are you prepared for that?",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't get it. We had a fight and you get dressed up like this?",
        "Lily: I put on a sexy dress, I thought we could spend some time alone. My master plan isn't working. I feel like a fool. Forget it --",
        "Holden: No, no, no. I'm sorry. You just -- you threw me, that's all. You do look pretty sexy.",
        "Lily: Yeah? Are you just saying that?",
        "Holden: No. You just took me by surprise, that's all. But, now that I know what's going on -- correct me if I'm wrong, but you are part owner of this hotel, aren't you?",
        "Lily: I am, yes.",
        "Holden: Could you get us a room?",
        "Cole: Can you float me a loan? Just a few bucks.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I guess. How come?",
        "Cole: Some new CDs are coming out today. I want to listen to them at work.",
        "Sofie: They haven't paid you yet?",
        "Cole: All right, look, if you're going to give me an attitude about it --",
        "Sofie: I don't have an attitude -- I was just -- I was just wondering.",
        "Cole: I'm supposed to get paid later today. Can you help me out?",
        "Sofie: Sure. Here.",
        "Cole: Thanks. I'll stop by during my break.",
        "Sofie: I know. There's somebody at table three.",
        "Lily: So, I told you why I was downstairs, but you didn't tell me why you were here.",
        "Holden: I was hoping that we could make up, too. I just wasn't as imaginative as you.",
        "Lily: I guess we're on the same wavelength, huh? Champagne?",
        "Holden: Ownership has its privileges.",
        "Lily: Yes, it does. Can I pour you a drink?",
        "Holden: In a minute. I just want to look at you first.",
        "Lily: You like what you see?",
        "Holden: It's different.",
        "Lily: In a bad way?",
        "Holden: No. It's not the thing that I would think you would pick Nat up in from her play group, but it's just you and me. I have no problem with it. No problem at all.",
        "Lily: I think I went a little far with the eye makeup. But the dress is okay, if I do say so myself.",
        "Holden: I disagree. I think it's way more than okay.",
        "Carly: You can't blame a girl for trying.",
        "Katie: Maybe he can't, but I can. Carly, I've been trying to be civil with this whole thing, but when is it going to end? First, you were at the apartment we were looking at, and then you follow me to the sample sale, and now this? All in one day!",
        "Carly: Look, Katie -- honestly, I swear to you, I -- yeah. You're right. You know, my behavior is inexcusable. I won't bother you two again. What? I just said that I wouldn't bother you, is that what you wanted?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that is -- that is what we want. Come on. We have people waiting for us. I'll see you later.",
        "Brad: The shower. Yes. Later. Yeah. That was nice. That was a really -- that was really nice. You really got to Jack with that little stunt. I mean, now what do you do to seal the deal?",
        "Gwen: I know that you're worried that we haven't thought about all the consequences, but we have.",
        "Alison: We've talked about it a lot already, Mom.",
        "Susan: Have you talked about what it's going to feel like, Gwen, if the baby has Alison's eyes or her smile?",
        "Gwen: It's not going to be a problem, because we want to include her in the child's life.",
        "Susan: Include her? As what?",
        "Gwen: As exactly what she is, someone who made our dream come true.",
        "Alison: It worked in our family, mom.",
        "Susan: Alison, don't you remember all the problems we had? Emily didn't know half the time whether she wanted to be your mother or your sister.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but we made it work.",
        "Gwen: And we can, too.",
        "Susan: Nobody can predict the future. And you're very young. This is usually thought of as a last resort.",
        "Will: Gwen and I have been handling things for a long time that most people thought we weren't ready for. And I think we can handle this, too.",
        "Susan: There's no way I can talk you out of this?",
        "Gwen: No, not really.",
        "Susan: Okay, then all I can say is, think about it a little more. Just take a little more time before you take the leap.",
        "Will: You know, if you want to bail, now would be the time.",
        "Carly: Coffee from the bottom of the pot. That'll make me feel better.",
        "Brad: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Carly: I know, I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: Do you want to talk?",
        "Carly: Not about Jack and Katie. Not about why I fainted. So, no.",
        "Brad: Okay, what about the design gig? Did you meet with ed about the condo?",
        "Carly: Actually, that's a sore subject as well.",
        "Brad: How come? I thought you two were going to work together?",
        "Carly: I doubt it. I didn't know small town life had so many drawbacks.",
        "Brad: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: Jack and Katie.",
        "Brad: I thought we weren't going to talk about them. That's why I asked you about design gig.",
        "Carly: I went to the place to check it out, take measurements. They were there. Can you believe that? They went to view the condo. They accused me of stalking them.",
        "Brad: Well, did you explain?",
        "Carly: Yes, I tried. I -- they were angry because I'd overheard some personal stuff. And the more I tried to explain that it was an accident, the more ridiculous I sounded, even to myself.",
        "Brad: You can't catch a break, can you?",
        "Carly: Are we playing \"state the obvious\"?",
        "Brad: Well, I know something that is pretty obvious that you can't seem to get, is every time you come up with a new scheme, the universe fights back. Maybe if you just gave up all the tricks --",
        "Carly: I have.",
        "Brad: You were lying on the ground when I walked -- walked over here. Okay? Don't you think faking a swoon is a little bit high school?",
        "Carly: Whatever.",
        "Brad: Don't whatever me! You know, hey, come on. Look, you're backsliding. And you're lucky I'm here to keep you from going down in flames.",
        "Carly: Are you going to give me some advice?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I'm going to give you some advice. I was a trickster of tricksters, okay? I played every game in the book in order to get Katie. And -- but I've -- I don't know, turned over a new leaf. I think you should learn from me, grasshopper.",
        "Carly: There's only one thing that I want from you, brad. I really want you to leave me alone.",
        "Brad: Okay. Whatever you want. Don't say I didn't try.",
        "Katie: I'm just glad you saw through Carly's act.",
        "Jack: Can we please talk about something else?",
        "Katie: Gladly.",
        "Jack: New dress?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Jack: It's hot.",
        "Katie: You think?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm!",
        "Katie: I don't even know if I want it anymore.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Katie: I never told you the whole story, but that's the reason the fita bracelet broke.",
        "Jack: What does one have to do with the other?",
        "Katie: I had the saleslady hold it for me while I ran downstairs to get money from the ATM. And when I came back, Carly was wearing it. We had words, and she threw it at me, and that's when the bracelet broke. It fell off my wrist.",
        "Jack: So where's the downside? Your wish was supposed to come true when it fell off and it fell off. And it came true.",
        "Katie: I know, and I'm thrilled. I just feel weird, okay? I don't really want to wear a dress that Carly just had on. It's like bad karma.",
        "Jack: Oh, I don't believe in any of that junk. Here, try it on. Wow! Now, how could anything that looks like that be bad karma? I guess it helps that the most beautiful woman in the world is wearing it.",
        "Katie: You think it's right for me? Because I thought so --",
        "Jack: Katie, I can't see it on anybody else, okay? You look amazing.",
        "Katie: I just want to be special for you.",
        "Jack: Have you ever been anything else?",
        "Brad: Whoa, whoa -- hey.",
        "Carly: No, I just lost my balance. These shoes, I knew I shouldn't have worn these shoes.",
        "Brad: No -- you weren't faking, were you?",
        "Gwen: We already talked about this. Alison said that she was on board.",
        "Alison: I totally am. And everything I told my mom was the truth.",
        "Will: If we start this and you get cold feet --",
        "Alison: Do you want me to pinky swear, will? I mean, whatever it takes, I'm not going to back out of this.",
        "Will: I hope not, because Gwen and I have been through a lot.",
        "Alison: Don't you know by now I would never do anything to hurt either of you?",
        "Will: I want to believe that.",
        "Alison: Helping you and Gwen have this baby means almost as much to me as it does to you guys. I won't let you down, I promise.",
        "Gwen: We believe you.",
        "Alison: Thank you. But I should tell you, I do have one condition.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Alison: As soon as the baby's old enough, I want you to tell him or her how they got here.",
        "Gwen: Of course we'll tell them. What makes you ask that now?",
        "Alison: Because once that baby's here, you're going to be taking care of it and holding it, and it'll be so easy to think, you know, \"what's the difference if it knows how it got here? It's ours.\" Because that's what my mom did, and the truth never hurt as much as when I found out that my life had pretty much been a lie.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I promise you, we'll tell the baby the truth. And when they get old enough to understand and start asking questions, you'll be there, too.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Gwen: All right, I got to get back to the Lakeview. I've got to go, I've got to be at work.",
        "Alison: Oh, I actually have to go to work, too. So, I'll just go over with you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, all right. I love you.",
        "Will: I love you, too.",
        "Gwen: Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Alison: She's right. You'll see.",
        "Lily: Oh, I've missed this.",
        "Holden: Me, too.",
        "Lily: How did we get so far apart?",
        "Holden: We argued. And then we hunkered down in our own corners and vowed not to come out.",
        "Lily: And we finally woke up.",
        "Holden: Maybe it's a perk to being married so long. We know where to find each other and get back on track.",
        "Lily: Oh, I just hate being out of sync with you.",
        "Holden: Well, then, let's make a promise to each other. We'll put each other first. Always. No more outside distractions. No Lucinda, no Dusty, nobody.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: I've got to hit the shower. I've got this trader in Nevada that I need to call before the day is out.",
        "Dusty: So, you ever connect with Alison?",
        "Aaron: What's it to you?",
        "Dusty: Well, if you two -- you know, could put it together, it would be good. I mean, if you stop sweating the small stuff.",
        "Aaron: The small stuff?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: You mean like that video of you and Ali that's all over the web? [Dusty chuckles] You know, it's none of your business what's between Ali and me.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Donovan.",
        "Lily: Hi. I'm sorry, I know I asked you to meet me, but then Holden was there.",
        "Dusty: Oh, don't worry about it. It's not a problem.",
        "Lily: I only have a couple of minutes can you come meet at room 509?",
        "Dusty: If it's about the same business, I told you, it's over.",
        "Lily: No, it's not over for me, because I found out something.",
        "Dusty: I told you to leave it alone.",
        "Lily: I didn't go looking for this. This is important information. Can you come now?",
        "Sofie: I've decided you're right. I can't wait any longer. I'm going to tell Cole about the baby tonight. I mean, I'm not really giving him a chance to step up if I don't tell him anything, am I? So, yeah, besides, he's always in a good mood after he gets new music. So, it will be fine.",
        "Aaron: I think you're making the right move, Sofie. Because in a couple of weeks, that little flutter is going to turn into a bump, and he's going to see it for himself. I think it would be better if you told him yourself.",
        "Lily: Thanks for coming. I have some news.",
        "Dusty: From who?",
        "Lily: Krista. Krista said that Cheri had a son in his teens.",
        "Dusty: We already knew that.",
        "Lily: Krista said there might have been bad blood between them, and that we should be looking for him.",
        "Dusty: It's a long shot.",
        "Lily: It's the only lead that we have.",
        "Dusty: You think this kid got my gun, set up the whole thing -- I think it's someone much more experienced.",
        "Lily: Is it worth looking into, or not?",
        "Dusty: You know how to find this kid?",
        "Lily: All I know is Cheri's real name is Charlene Wilson, and her son was born in Georgia. Is that enough information for us to find him?",
        "Dusty: There's no us, remember?",
        "Lily: But if it weren't for me, we wouldn't have any information.",
        "Dusty: And you lied to Holden about why you were wearing this get-up?",
        "Lily: Which is why I have to be involved now, Dusty. I hate lying to my husband, but it's going to be worth it if we can prove that you're innocent.",
        "Dusty: I'll prove it. You go back to your husband. And thank you.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Can I get a bottle of water?",
        "Aaron: Sure. I'm surprised to see you back at work so soon.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you heard?",
        "Aaron: Ali -- Ali told me. I hope it's okay. I mean, she wasn't like gossiping or anything like that --",
        "Gwen: No, it's fine. It's fine.",
        "Aaron: It must have been hard.",
        "Gwen: It was. I honestly don't know what I would have done if Alison hadn't been there.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, Ali can really step up when she has to. I'm glad she was there for you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's been a really good friend. More than a good friend. She's been unbelievable. I want to tell you something and I don't think she would mind.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Please, yeah.",
        "Gwen: Well, will and I -- we want to try and get pregnant again but there are certain problems on my end. So Alison offered to be a donor so we can try and have another baby. Isn't that the most incredible gift?",
        "Aaron: That's amazing.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's got a lot more going on than people give her credit for.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: I've got -- thanks for the water.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. Okay, see you.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, can you cover my shift for a little bit?",
        "Sofie: Sure, if you cover for me later. If I'm going to tell Cole about the baby, we need some time to celebrate.",
        "Aaron: I'll be back in plenty of time. Hey. Did you think about how you're going to tell him?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I guess I'll just -- just do it. You know, plain and simple.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, that's a good idea. All right, good luck.",

        "Alison: So, I was really excited when Henry and Vienna asked me to work your shower.",
        "Katie: You were?",
        "Alison: Sure. I mean, it's good to see things work out for people who deserve it. And I'm sure you and Jack have had your problems, but it seems like you two have found each other and really made it work. I'm happy for you.",
        "Katie: Thank you, Alison. That's sweet.",
        "Alison: Oh, and I also got you a pre-wedding gift. It's a kokopeli doll from back out west. And he brings you good luck and sometimes babies. So I thought you'd like it.",
        "Katie: Wow, that was very thoughtful. Thank you so much.",
        "Alison: Well, I should probably get stuff started, so--",
        "Katie: Okay. Thanks, al.",
        "Jack: Dress talk over?",
        "Katie: Actually, it was more than that. Alison gave us a present.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Jack: I didn't think you were that close.",
        "Katie: Well, we were very friendly a while ago. It's nice to see that she's grown up and it's good to see that people can change.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm, speaking of that, you still nervous?",
        "Katie: About getting married? No. About this party -- maybe a little bit. I hate to bring it up, I don't want to jinx anything, but -- you don't think Carly is going try and show up?",
        "Jack: Oh, do we have to talk about Carly?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Jack: Katie, I really think that that fainting spell was just a last-ditch effort to come between us. She's done now. And I'm done talking about Carly.",
        "Carly: You didn't have to follow me home, brad.",
        "Brad: Well, I wanted to keep you from nodding off, and driving into a ditch.",
        "Carly: Yes, well how could I nod off, with your headlights glaring at me in my rear view mirror?",
        "Brad: I still think we should go to the hospital and get you checked out.",
        "Carly: What for?",
        "Brad: People don't faint for no reason, Carly.",
        "Carly: I had a reason. It just didn't work.",
        "Brad: What's wrong with you?",
        "Carly: Nothing. I just had a dizzy spell, that's all. It passed. I'm fine.",
        "Brad: How can you be sure if we don't go to the hospital and let them give you some tests or something?",
        "Carly: You're right. You're right, there is something wrong with me. But I'm not going to go into it with you, brad. Or anybody else. So say good night.",
        "Brad: Wait, so you're just gonna tell me that something's wrong with you and I'm just going to go, \"oh, okay, Carly, you know, um sweet dreams, don't let the bedbugs bite.\" I'm not going anywhere, until you're straight with me!",
        "Carly: All right, you wanna know what's wrong with me? It's my heart.",
        "Brad: Okay. Okay, okay, what's going on? Are you having palpitations or something?",
        "Carly: No, not exactly.",
        "Brad: Okay, what is it, exactly?",
        "Carly: My heart is broken.",
        "Brad: Oh, Carly!",
        "Carly: Oh, and you wonder why I didn't want to talk to you about it?",
        "Brad: So, okay, so, that's what you're saying, you're saying you're depressed.",
        "Carly: No, I'm saying that my heart is broken. And it's different.",
        "Brad: Okay, if that's why the job with ed didn't work out, isn't it? You know, you're too down in the dumps, you know, to give it your all.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you for the analysis, doctor. Now, if you would just let me up off your couch and get out of house and leave me alone, I'd really appreciate it.",
        "Brad: No! No! No, Carly. I'm not going anywhere while you're like this. No.",
        "Carly: Well, fine. Fine, then I'll kick you out myself! Get out! Get out of here now!",

        "Lily: Please. Please, don't be. It was my idea to hide the gun, post his bail.",
        "Holden: Maybe so, but he could have stopped you. He should have stopped you.",
        "Lily: I don't want to talk about Dusty. You have Jack and Katie's shower to get to. If we start arguing, then we're never going to get there.",
        "Holden: No, I -- I don't want to argue. I just want to tell you that even though I think Dusty was wrong, I understand why you needed to bail him out.",
        "Lily: You do?",
        "Holden: Yeah. You guys, you've been friends forever and I did not take that into consideration when I came down on you for it. So for that, I apologize.",

        "Holden: Yeah, but one more thing. One more thing.",

        "Lily: I does. It's good. It's good when we talk.",
        "Holden: It's good when we do other things, too. We just need to be honest with each other, and everything will be fine. That's all we need to do, okay? It's all I care about.",
