        "All of the digging for gold bars that Paul did at the work site leaves structural damage too far to be repaired. Meg is upset that Paul is acting strange, and Barbara fears that James is trying to drive Paul insane. Carly helps Jack see that hiding the evidence is against everything that he stands for and that he won't be able to live with himself if he doesn't come clean. He agrees, but Janet & Brad have already destroyed the evidence. Jack comes clean to Margo. Lily leaves a message with Holden to come watch the kids while she goes off to meet Mike at the hotel for a tryst, but he doesn't get the message, and by the time the parents arrive home, Ethan is missing. Playing alone at the construction site, Ethan chases a ball into the deep hole."

        "[Meg talking to Barbara on the phone]",
        "Barbara: So, how's the little mama-to-be this morning?",
        "Meg: Good. Barbara, listen. Have you talked to Paul since last night?",
        "Barbara: No. What happened?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I went to bed while he was out, and when I woke up this morning, he still wasn't home.",
        "Barbara: Did he tell you where he was going?",
        "Meg: I didn't know he was going anywhere until Mike came looking for him.",
        "Barbara: Well, Honey, maybe he came home and left again before you ever woke up.",
        "Meg: No. There is no sign that he's been home. And I've been trying his cell. He's not answering.",
        "Barbara: Meg, try to calm down, all right?",
        "Meg: I'm scared, Barbara. He had a very stressful day yesterday. Oh, my God. I got to go. I was so worried about you! Come here!",
        "Paul: Why? I'm fine. Everything's okay.",
        "Meg: No, it's not. Look at you. What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: He claimed he was trying to find the source of contamination. I need you to tell me if the digging Paul did caused structural damage too big to fix.",
        "Foreman: That's putting it lightly.",
        "Mike: The hole was half this size yesterday!",
        "Foreman: This is something we can't fix.",
        "Mike: Damn it, Paul! What the hell were you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Jack, hi. It's me. Listen, I was wondering if you were feeling any better about, you know -- I mean, the good thing is, it's done, and what's done is done, and now, hopefully, we can put it behind us and just move on and forget about it, you know? 'Cause that would be best for everyone concerned. I'll call you later.",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Janet: Oh, Lieutenant Hughes! What a surprise.",
        "Margo: Really? That's funny, 'cause Tom said, just this morning, \"We spend more time in Al's diner than we do in our own home.\"",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Janet: Well, I'll get somebody to help you because I'm going on my break.",
        "Margo: Actually, no. I'm here to talk to you. It's official business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey, hey. I've been looking for you. I went to the station, but I should have known you would go to the diner and scarf down free food from your girlfriend.",
        "Jack: No, not today. I don't have much of an appetite.",
        "Brad: Really? I'm starving. You want to have breakfast with me?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, I'll eat, you sit and listen.",
        "Jack: The last thing I want to do is sit there and watch you eat, Brad.",
        "Brad: But I have news, all right? You're not the only one that's got his brother's back.",
        "Jack: Can we not talk about this right now?",
        "Brad: I told Margo that I wasn't gonna let Liberty testify against Leo, which makes the Morrissey case D.O.A. and you, my man, totally off the hook.",
        "Jack: What is it gonna take to shut you the hell up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Holden: I'm just checking on the horses.",
        "Carly: Feels like a million years since I've been riding.",
        "Holden: Well, you know, you can come out here anytime.",
        "Carly: I'm not sure your mother would like that. I'm looking for Jack.",
        "Holden: Just missed him.",
        "Carly: Damn it.",
        "Holden: Everything okay?",
        "Carly: Not really.",
        "Holden: Want to talk about it?",
        "Carly: Not really.",
        "Holden: You know, I'm still the guy that you can tell anything to, remember?",
        "Carly: Not this.",
        "Holden: It's funny. After all this time, you still do have secrets.",
        "Carly: Not funny, really. I think \"Pathetic\" is a better word. For some reason, I can't seem to stay out of my ex's life.",
        "Holden: I know the feeling. You know, if we had lives of our own, maybe we wouldn't get so caught up in theirs. That's not funny, is it? That's not funny. That's pathetic.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: I should go.",
        "Holden: Hey, I was just about to make some coffee. Why don't you stay? I promise you, I won't ask you about Jack.",

        "Mike: Kasnoff.",
        "Lily: Did you go to the wrong tree?",
        "Mike: Lily.",
        "Lily: I don't know how you missed it. It's the only copper beech on the property.",
        "Mike: Oh, I am so sorry. I know I said I'd meet you, but if I had any idea that Emma's little favor was gonna turn into such a nightmare, I would have told her no.",
        "Lily: Well, it's okay. I'll forgive you, providing you make it up to me this morning.",
        "Mike: This morning?",
        "Lily: You owe me.",
        "Mike: Believe me, it's a debt I'm happy to pay. Just, I have to do one thing first, and then I'm all yours.",
        "Lily: I like the sound of that.",
        "Mike: Shall we try for the tree again?",
        "Lily: No. Actually, I was thinking something a little bit more comfortable. Meet me at the Lakeview in half an hour.",
        "Mike: I'll meet you in the lobby.",

        "Margo: I came to talk about Leo Morrissey.",
        "Janet: I figured as much.",
        "Margo: So Brad told you I came to see him about Liberty testifying against Leo?",
        "Janet: Right, that.",
        "Margo: Well, Brad is making a huge mistake. You two cannot drop this case. I know that he's reticent about having Liberty testify, but I --",
        "Janet: I feel the same way as Bradley. Why put Liberty through that?",
        "Margo: Because she has been through a horrible thing, and the only way to get past it is to acknowledge it and to seek justice. Brad thinks that he's protecting Liberty by not letting her talk about this, but I don't think he realizes that she's gonna start thinking that she's the one who did something wrong.",
        "Janet: Oh, she knows that's not the case.",
        "Margo: On a conscious level, maybe, but that's not the message that she's getting.",
        "Janet: Look, we both just want our daughter to forget about this and move on with her life.",
        "Margo: If I may, speaking from personal experience, that's never gonna happen unless you confront your attacker. I mean, unless it's okay with you and you don't care if Leo gets away with this.",
        "Janet: That is -- no, absolutely not.",
        "Margo: Unless Liberty testifies, that may very well happen. And then how protected is she or any other young woman gonna feel?",
        "Janet: I never thought about it that way.",
        "Margo: Please, Janet. Let her testify. Don't let her walk through life feeling like a victim. I think you owe her that much as a mom, as a woman.",
        "Janet: You're right.",
        "Margo: Great. Then you'll talk to Brad?",
        "Janet: I will, yes.",
        "Margo: Okay. All right. And please, please tell Brad that this is too big to just ignore. Okay. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you really think it's smart to be discussing this in public?",
        "Brad: What discussion are you talking about? Took about 10 seconds. Who sneezed in your cereal this morning?",
        "Jack: You don't get it, do you? To you, this is just another screw up that someone else is gonna fix for you.",
        "Brad: You know what your problem is? For the first time in your life, you didn't do something right, and you can't stand it, even though the person you stuck your neck out for is your own brother.",
        "Jack: Is that what you think? That I did this for you? Believe me, I would let you fry before I broke the law to save your sorry tail.",
        "Brad: Wow, okay. That's harsh, considering what I just did for you.",
        "Jack: Your refusing to let Liberty testify is for you, and you know it! Stay out of my face, and don't you ever, ever, ever talk to me about this again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, thank you for the coffee. I really do have to go.",
        "Holden: Okay, I'll walk you out.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Holden: That's strange.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Holden: These are my mother's things. I brought them over to Lily's for the wedding. I wonder why whoever dropped them off didn't bring them inside.",
        "Carly: You don't think Lily came by, do you? If she saw us --",
        "Holden: No. She's getting the kids ready for school. I guess it was Luke. Maybe he dropped them off before class.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Holden: So, listen, I got to go over to the Lakeview, return some things from the wedding. I'll walk you out to your car.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: No way! Did anybody see them? I got to go. Text me. What's with the death glare?",
        "Lily: When I asked you to watch your brother and sister, I didn't mean \"Don't get ready for school.\" Now you're gonna be late! I'm gonna have to write you a note!",
        "Faith: Stop stressing, Mom.",
        "Lily: Well, you know how much I hate to have to do that.",
        "Faith: I won't be late because there's no school today.",
        "Lily: Oh, really? I have the school calendar right over here, and you definitely -- don't have school today. Teacher conference? You just got back to school.",
        "Faith: I know, and they're already sick of us.",
        "Lily: I guess that goes for Ethan's pre-k teacher, too. Where are they, by the way?",
        "Faith: Ethan's watching his new DVD, and Nat's playing wedding with her dolls.",
        "Lily: I've got some errands to run this morning, so I am going to need you to watch them for a little longer.",
        "Faith: How much longer?",
        "Lily: Couple of hours.",
        "Faith: Seriously?",
        "Lily: Is there a problem?",
        "Faith: I have this huge science report due tomorrow, and I can't do that and watch them.",
        "Lily: Oh, really? But you can talk on your cell phone and watch them? Fine. I'll call your father. Do me a favor -- just watch them and hold off on your project until your dad gets here, okay?",
        "Faith: Fine.",
        "Lily: And try not to act like it's the end of the world, Faith Snyder. Try to pull yourself away from Carly for two minutes.",
        "Holden: Hi, it's Holden. Leave me a message. Thanks.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Lily: Hey, listen. It's me. I forgot, the kids don't have school today, and Faith is here watching them, but she's got a big science report. So it would be great if you could come over and watch the kids, assuming you're not too busy with something else. Let me know if that's the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, we need to talk.",
        "Jack: No. No, we don't. Unless it's the kids.",
        "Carly: Kids are fine. You're not, and I'm worried.",
        "Jack: Don't be.",
        "Carly: I can't help it.",
        "Jack: I'm really busy, Carly.",
        "Carly: Yes, Jack, I can see that. Come on. Let's go, okay?",
        "Jack: I am not going anywhere with you.",
        "Carly: Well, if you know what's good for you, you will. I don't think you want anyone with a badge to hear what I have to say.",
        "Jack: Fine.",

        "Paul: Did you get anything to eat yet?",
        "Meg: Hey. No. I was so worried.",
        "Paul: I'll make you something.",
        "Meg: No, Paul! Look, you took your shower. You have to tell me where you were last night.",
        "Paul: I was at the work site.",
        "Meg: I thought you agreed not to go back there.",
        "Paul: I can't just abandon the project, Meg. Everything I have is invested in this.",
        "Meg: What were you doing there?",
        "Paul: Making progress.",
        "Meg: Oh. Well, I hope you weren't using the backhoe, because Mike said --",
        "Paul: Why would I care what Mike has to say? You don't understand. I can't get through to you. Everything that I'm doing, I'm doing for you and your family.",
        "Mike: I warned you, Ryan.",
        "Maid: I'm sorry. He refused to leave.",
        "Meg: No, no, it's okay.",
        "Mike: I told you to stay away from the site, but you just couldn't, could you?",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Mike: You turned that hole into a pit and made the damage even worse than it was before. We need to declare the site condemned now.",
        "Paul: Fine, if that's what we have to do.",
        "Mike: Fine? Is this what you wanted?",
        "Paul: Mike, I didn't do anything!",
        "Mike: Right. And, you, you told me that he had changed. I really hoped, for your sake, he had.",
        "Paul: Why do I bother talking to this --",
        "Meg: Did you lie to Mike? Why would you do that?",
        "Paul: Who's side are you on? I didn't lie to Mike. I didn't go anywhere near the spot that he said was dangerous. I was at the site, but not there.",
        "Meg: Okay, then where were you? You're covered in dirt. You were covered in dirt.",
        "Paul: I fell in a ditch.",
        "Meg: You fell?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. It was really stupid. I was in a hurry. I don't feel like I have a lot of time, Meg. I got to turn this all around. I do not want to disappoint you. I do not want to disappoint your family.",
        "Meg: I told you, this project means nothing to me if it's gonna make you crazy. I love you. I need you. We -- we need you. This means nothing if you're not here with us.",
        "Paul: I'm not going anywhere. Everything's gonna be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I thought he'd be happy when I told him I wasn't gonna let Liberty testify against Leo. Instead, he totally went off on me. You guys having problems or what?",
        "Janet: No. This is about what you talked about with Margo.",
        "Brad: Margo came to see you, too?",
        "Janet: Yeah, and I think she has a point. You know, what Leo did to Liberty was wrong.",
        "Brad: Yeah, of course it was wrong.",
        "Janet: And I think, as her parents, it's our job to make sure that she is not the victim.",
        "Brad: Well, how do you think she's gonna feel if she blows this case wide open and sends her father to jail?",
        "Janet: No, no, no. They're two different cases.",
        "Brad: But they're connected. If we go after Leo, it's not gonna be long before he puts two and two together.",
        "Janet: I know, but --",
        "Brad: What? But what?",
        "Janet: But I don't want her to end up like me, backing down when somebody treats her badly. I want her to stand up for herself!",
        "Brad: Yeah, but she doesn't have to stand up for herself. I stood up for her! I mean, for the first time in her life, Liberty had a dad around to defend her honor.",
        "Janet: But she doesn't know that you're the one that went after Leo.",
        "Brad: And she can't ever know, Janet -- ever! That would only make things worse.",
        "Janet: How is it for Jack, huh? How do you think it is for him? What he did to protect you is killing him!",
        "Brad: He'll get over it.",
        "Janet: What if he doesn't? What if what we're doing now is the worst thing for the both of them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yo's for breakfast? Boy, it doesn't get any deader than this.",
        "Carly: We didn't come here to have fun, Jack.",
        "Jack: We used to, remember?",
        "Carly: You're not gonna distract me by taking a little trip down memory lane. Now we're here because it's the only place I could think of where we wouldn't be interrupted.",
        "Jack: I told you, we have nothing to talk about.",
        "Carly: Right. Except perhaps for that missing evidence you supposedly have no interest in.",
        "Jack: Boy, you just never give up, do you?",
        "Carly: Not unless I'm forced to. When I couldn't get anything out of you, I went to talk to Brad and Katie, who, of course, played dumb. Brad even had the nerve to ask me why I care so much.",
        "Jack: Why do you?",
        "Carly: You know I'll never stop. Jack, Brad is the one who threw Leo into the Reservoir, isn't he? Only no one knows because you took the only evidence that could prove it, and now you hate yourself.",
        "Jack: Okay, stop. Will you just stop it, please?",
        "Carly: You're in on this, aren't you? You and Brad and Katie. And Janet was acting sketchy, so I suppose I can add her to the list, too. If I'm wrong, Jack, you look at me and you tell me so. I'll believe you. I'll never ask you again. I just need to know one thing.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: Why would you risk everything for your brother when you wouldn't do it for your own son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I know this is really hard on Jack, but think of all the lives that will be affected if it came out that I was the one that pushed Leo in the water. Liberty's, Katie's, yours, and now that Jack helped cover it up, his whole family. Is that what you want?",
        "Janet: No, of course not.",
        "Brad: It's not like I meant to put Leo in a coma. I didn't, but he's fine now, which makes it even more pointless for me or anyone else to suffer for what happened.",
        "Janet: I guess you're right.",
        "Brad: It's not like I don't think that it would do Liberty some real good to go after Leo, because I really do, and if the situation were different, I'd be the first in line to nail that little bastard, but I just think it would do her more good to have her father around to see her get on with her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Listen, I hate that I didn't do something to help Parker's case. Not just because he's my son but because what Sam tried to do to you is as bad as anything that Leo tried to do to Liberty. And if I had walked in and saw what Parker saw, I would have shot him, too.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, you wouldn't have. You are too good a cop for that. Maybe I can only say this now because Parker was cleared. But as mad as I was that you wouldn't break the law to help him, I loved you so much for being the one person I could count on to do what's right, no matter what. That's why I'm telling you that you can't keep this up, Jack. It's not who you are.",
        "Jack: Well, I never thought I'd see the day that you, of all people, would be begging me to keep my spot on the moral high ground.",
        "Carly: You're right. I'm in no position to talk. But you're not like me, Jack. And if you don't do the right thing, you will never be able to live with yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What you need to do is just go home and forget this whole thing.",
        "Janet: Well, that's easy for you to say. Jack didn't give you the stolen evidence.",
        "Brad: He what?",
        "Janet: I'm gonna go.",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Why would he give it to you?",
        "Janet: Because I asked him to. Because I knew that he would never destroy it because it's against the law.",
        "Brad: He's such a good guy.",
        "Janet: I know! He's too good!",
        "Brad: Which is why we need to help him put this whole thing behind him.",
        "Janet: Like how?",
        "Brad: Like destroying the evidence.",
        "Janet: What?!",
        "Brad: Yeah. I mean, what? I mean, after everything -- after everything Jack has done for me -- done for us, it's the least we could do, you know? So just give it to me, and I'll build a nice little bonfire. There's got to be a pack of matches around here somewhere.",
        "Janet: You cannot be serious about this.",
        "Brad: I'm so serious. Okay, once that evidence is ashes, this whole nightmare will be over for all of us.",
        "Janet: You know, there's only one other guy that I've ever liked besides Jack, and that was you.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Janet: And when you kicked me to the curb, Jack stepped in, and he made me realize that I deserved so much more than what I was settling for.",
        "Brad: Good for you. Good for you.",
        "Janet: And when he had the chance to let me go, he didn't take it, and that has never happened to me before.",
        "Brad: Okay, Janet. What are you trying to say here?",
        "Janet: I don't want to lose him.",
        "Brad: You won't. You won't. Okay, if anything, he'll be grateful that you did both him and yourself a favor because, once the evidence is gone, he can stop obsessing about what he did wrong and focus on more important things like you.",
        "Janet: It's at the Snyder farm behind my makeup mirror.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're gonna have to face it, Jack. You're hardwired to be a stand-up guy.",
        "Jack: For all the good it's done me. Sometimes I think I lost more than I've gained because of it.",
        "Carly: You lost nothing that mattered as much to you as being a good cop.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't be so sure.",
        "Carly: What are you gonna do?",
        "Jack: Don't you know?",
        "Carly: Would you like some company?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Where is he? Is he all right?",
        "Meg: Barbara, I am so sorry. I forgot to call.",
        "Barbara: When you didn't call me back, I was just so worried, Meg.",
        "Meg: I know.",
        "Paul: Why? I'm fine.",
        "Barbara: Then why didn't you come home last night? Your wife was worried sick.",
        "Paul: You called my mother?",

        "Lily: Ooh, you really had a bad morning.",

        "Barbara: Dig where, Paul?",
        "Paul: Emma Snyder's farm. That's where James hid the gold.",
        "Barbara: Do you know how crazy that sounds?",
        "Paul: Yes, I know. I said the same thing. And then James showed me this. He said that I should give this to Derek Coburn and that would buy me a little bit of time until I can dig up the rest.",
        "Barbara: Do you really think that, after everything your father has done to you your entire life, that he has a pot of gold waiting for you in the ground at Emma Snyder's farm?",
        "Paul: There has to be. The lives of my wife and unborn child depend on it.",
        "Barbara: I'll tell you what, you give that gold bar to Coburn and I'll give you the rest of the money next week.",
        "Paul: Next week's too late.",
        "Barbara: I have to do something, Paul!",
        "Paul: There is something that you can do. Maybe you could come up with a cover story so I can keep doing what I'm doing. That way, when I get the money back, I'll give it to James, and then he's out of our lives. Our troubles are over.",

        "Brad: Have I ever steered you wrong? Look, prom night 17 years ago doesn't count, all right? Look at the bright side. If the evidence doesn't exist, it'd be like Jack never took it. And if that doesn't ease his conscience, I don't know what will. It's all good. You'll see. It's all good. Hey, what are you doing here?",

        "Carly: Don't do that. Don't make Jack the bad guy here. You have no idea what this has cost him.",

        "Jack: I never told you to get rid of that stuff.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: Whatever! Whatever! I mean, it's done. Jack can't stab me in the back because he doesn't have anything. So why don't we just forget that we walked in here, because I'm sure as hell gonna try.",
        "Jack: I can't do that.",
        "Brad: Right, because you're such a good guy. So good, you're about to leave Liberty without a father just so you can sleep at night.",
