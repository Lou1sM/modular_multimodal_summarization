        "Chris: Hey, you're up early.",
        "Alison: Hey. I couldn't sleep anyway. There's still so much to do. Don't forget your tux.",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Alison: Today's the last day you have to get it fitted in time for the wedding. I already left a message with Tom and Casey, I just spoke to Emily and I just got off the phone with your dad.",
        "Chris: Oh, Alison. You made a list?",
        "Alison: Yeah and I'm going to use it. I refuse to make any more mistakes with our wedding, okay? So you get going. And I have to get back to item eight or we're in big trouble.",
        "Chris: What's that?",
        "Alison: The photographer. I know that I should've done it weeks ago, but I'm going to get it done right now.",
        "Chris: I said I'd help with the photographer. And you waited for me, right? Alison, I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: It's okay, it's no big deal.",
        "Chris: No, no I should've been on this weeks ago. So you know what? Today, you and I are going to go out and find the best photographer.",
        "Alison: What about work?",
        "Chris: Its pictures of the most important day of our lives. Work can wait.",

        "Aaron: The mistress of time -- the heir apparent sits on the throne -- I got it. The last key's in London. Book the flights.",
        "Curtis: Come on, that's pathetic.",
        "Aaron: What do you have?",
        "Curtis: Nothing. I'm clueless. Clue-free.",
        "Aaron: Mrs. Grimaldi! That was fast.",

        "Curtis: All right.",
        "Aaron: Nancy Hughes has helped a lot in \"Six Keys to the Kingdom\" contest. You guys really know your history.",
        "Lisa: Well, I'm not sure it's going to help this time. I've been kicking it around in my head all the way over here. I am stumped.",
        "Aaron: Okay, well let's take a seat. Let's relax.",
        "Lisa: Oh, thank you.",
        "Aaron: By the way, when you talked to Mrs. Hughes, did she mention at all that she had to talked to Ali this morning?",
        "Lisa: No, she didn't mention it.",
        "Aaron: I don't get it. I mean, Ali knows the last clue comes out today. She knows exactly what time the paper hits the stands.",
        "Lisa: Well, honey, Alison's wedding is just around the corner. Surely, she has other priorities. So what do you say we get down to business, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Dusty? Dusty? I know you're awake.",
        "Dusty: Good morning, princess. Did you get a 1500 on your balance test too?",
        "Lucy: No. But your breakfast is in serious danger if you don't let go now.",
        "Dusty: You're right, you're right. We can manage breakfast without all that --",
        "Lucy: Food?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. And I don't fake anything, just so you know. I didn't want to ruin your little surprise here, which is very nice.",
        "Lucy: I thought you needed it.",
        "Dusty: Are you trying to keep my strength up?",
        "Lucy: You didn't really sleep very well last night.",
        "Dusty: Was I talking?",
        "Lucy: No, you just, you just seemed to keep waking up and trying to fall back asleep. Hey, something wrong?",
        "Dusty: No. Maybe. But I'm gonna make it right.",
        "Lucy: What is it?",
        "Dusty: I've made some decisions. And you need to hear what they are.",

        "Julia: In a hurry?",
        "Jack: You know it.",
        "Julia: Um -- listen. I might have a quicker way. I don't know, it's probably a long shot, but it's worth a try.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Julia: These are the clothes -- or what's left of them -- that you had on when they brought you in. I went by the hospital, picked them up.",
        "Jack: They kept them?",
        "Julia: Yeah, and you know what I found out is -- hang on.",
        "Cop: Ms. Latrobe, there've been some developments.",
        "Jack: What kind of developments?",
        "Cop: You two better come down to the station.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Freddy, get this report to the DA and ask them where the charges are from the two B&Es from last night. And call the Commissioner, tell him I can brief him on the Bova report at noon. Okay?",
        "Emily: Only if you're really, really fast at the tailor's.",
        "Hal: Emily, hey. What are you doing here, hon?",
        "Emily: You have a fitting at the tailor. Your tuxedo -- remember?",

        "Emily: Can't?",
        "Hal: No.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? This is Alison's wedding. This is the last day you can get fitted for your tuxedo.",
        "Hal: You can see I'm really busy here.",
        "Emily: You're busy, I know. It's always busy, you're busy, everything else comes first, I get that. Look, I know it's a tuxedo, it's not a bug deal. But if it doesn't fit you --",
        "Cop: Sorry, Lieutenant, it's an out-of-state call -- line two.",
        "Hal: In a minute. Look, I tell you what. Why don't you go home, why don't you get my dress blues because they fit perfectly. Why don't you take them to the tailor and he can size the tuxedo from that. Okay? Okay hon, I got to take this. All right? [Phone ringing in background] Lieutenant Munson.",
        "Chief: Lieutenant, this is Chief Keegan. I run the police department down in Barstow. Yeah, we're down on the river, across the state line in Missouri.",
        "Hal: I know where Barstow is, Chief. Can I help you?",
        "Chief: I was hoping to help you. One of my uniforms brought in a guy who's acting like a cop. Says his name's Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, no, Hal, I can't. Not today, all right? I just don't have any fight left in me today. And I haven't mentioned Jack to Parker --",
        "Hal: It's not about Parker. I got a call from the police chief in Missouri, down river. They have a guy at their station. It sounds like it could be Jack.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Hal: They could have Jack. Where are the kids?",
        "Carly: Parker's at school. Lily picked up Sage for a play date with Natalie.",
        "Hal: Okay, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hi, excuse me, I -- hey.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm here to pick up Casey's tux.",
        "Tom: I guess you're not surprised to see me here at the last minute, huh?",
        "Margo: Well, kind of par for the course.",
        "Tailor: Is that all right?",
        "Tom: You know, I was always kind of lousy at this stuff. Is this all right?",
        "Margo: I think, you know maybe, maybe just half an inch in through here. Otherwise, you know, you'll get to the middle of the party and find an excuse to leave.",
        "Tom: All right, thanks. Could you go and get that tuxedo that she came to pick up for Casey Hughes? Thank you.",
        "Margo: So, it's gonna be a beautiful wedding.",
        "Tom: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Margo: Yeah, the groom's party is going to be dashing.",

        "Margo: Picking up your tux.",
        "Casey: Oh, man. You're getting my tux?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Kind of made sense, 'cause I'm the one with the car.",
        "Casey: I guess I forgot.",
        "Margo: Yeah, the car that I had to get back to you in an hour because you had an absolutely drop-dead important appointment.",
        "Casey: Well, you know, it was such a nice day out, I took my mountain bike anyway. Look, this whole transportation thing, it's really hard to keep straight. Why don't we all just go to the wedding together? You know, keep it simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Let me see. This one I would say maybe -- what do you think?",
        "Alison: Can doctors get fired?",
        "Chris: Alison, I already called work. I'm covered. Okay?",
        "Alison: It's just so sweet of you to do this.",

        "Chris: Okay, well these are the yeses and these are the maybes. How about this guy?",
        "Alison: I don't know. How can you tell when it's total strangers?",
        "Chris: You got a good point. I'll tell you what. We'll have each of these guys take our picture and then we'll pick the best one.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Alison: We can do that?",
        "Chris: Of course we can. It's our wedding. We call the shots.",
        "Alison: I can be dressed in two seconds. This is gonna be so much fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Ali, where are you? Come on, this is our last chance. Mrs. Grimaldi is here, helping us out. Okay, but you got to call me right now. I'm serious. Bye. How are you doing?",
        "Lisa: Well, I'm fine. So you weren't able to reach Alison?",
        "Aaron: No, looks like we're on our own. How 'bout this right here, the mistress of time? Is that like a Greek goddess?",
        "Lisa: I don't think it is. Though, I am truly not an authority on mythology.",
        "Aaron: What about the throne part? It's not like we have royalty in Oakdale.",
        "Lisa: She would, wouldn't she?",
        "Curtis: What?",
        "Lisa: This is it.",
        "Aaron: The City Times?",
        "Lisa: Yes, yes. \"The mistress of time\", Lucinda Walsh.",
        "Curtis: All right.",
        "Aaron: And \"close to home\" means the \"City Times\" building.",
        "Lisa: Bingo.",
        "Curtis: That place is huge, though.",
        "Aaron: Can we narrow it down?",
        "Lisa: Oh, I'm afraid you have to give me a minute. Yeah.",
        "Curtis: All right. Well, you go ahead, stake out the place, and we'll call you.",
        "Aaron: That's a good idea. This way I'll be ready to move. And you know what, if Kevin shows up, he's gonna have to get through me. Mrs. Grimaldi, thank you so much.",
        "Lisa: My pleasure.",
        "Aaron: Okay, and if Alison calls, send her over.",
        "Lisa: Oh boy. Just leave it up to that old Lucy to make herself the clue in her own newspaper.",

        "Beatrice: Please, that's valuable.",
        "Man: Looks like a throne.",
        "Lucinda: Beatrice, darling, who are these people? They can't be Rock the Vote because they're not coming till later this afternoon.",
        "Beatrice: No, Ms. Walsh, the last key to the contest is hidden here.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my God. Here?",
        "Man: Where? Where is it?",
        "Lucinda: Whose lame-brained idea was this? People, I'm sorry! I have meetings today in this office all afternoon! Sisters, no, no.",
        "Man: Let it go. I got it!",
        "Lucinda: Okay, let's call security, Beatrice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I want your father out of our lives for good. You know? I don't want to walk in on some drama like the one he was trying to pull you into yesterday at Metro. My gosh.",
        "Lucy: But I all ready told you, it's different now. I don't let him get to me anymore.",
        "Dusty: I don't even know how you can see him every day. I can't.",
        "Lucy: I don't want you turning your whole world upside down because of me.",
        "Dusty: I'm not, sweetheart, I'm not. I want to get out of Metro for a lot of reasons.",
        "Lucy: So you'd sell your share of Metro? I mean, it's an asset, right?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's an asset, but it comes along with a load of debt. And I got to take care of that before I can do anything else. But I think I got a way.",
        "Lucy: How?",
        "Dusty: I got a business opportunity that's gonna take a lot of my time over the next few weeks.",
        "Lucy: What? Why?",
        "Dusty: It's okay. I got to work, I got to work, that's why. I'll be gone now and then, not for long.",
        "Lucy: I don't like this opportunity.",
        "Dusty: That's 'cause you don't know.",
        "Lucy: I don't know because you don't tell me.",
        "Dusty: That's 'cause I'm still working out the details.",
        "Lucy: I'm great with details. Let me help.",
        "Dusty: Oh, are you really?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I mean, it's not like I have a job. I have time.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no. It's okay. Its okay, I'll handle it.",
        "Lucy: Why are you being so vague? What are you getting involved in that I can't be a part of?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Case, don't put pressure on your father like that. I'm sure we'll all find our own way to the wedding.",
        "Tom: Or we could just go together. I mean, if that's okay with you?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, sure, that'd be great.",
        "Casey: Great. Awesome. So dude -- last clue, keys contest today. You gonna give me a hand or what?",
        "Tom: As soon as I get out of the monkey suit -- dude. I'll call before the wedding, we'll make arrangements.",
        "Margo: Okay. That was flat-out shameless.",
        "Casey: But it worked. He said yes, Mom.",
        "Margo: Did you know that your father had this appointment this morning?",
        "Casey: Of course.",
        "Margo: And so you arranged it that I would be here at exactly the same time.",
        "Casey: This is why you're such a good detective.",
        "Margo: No honey, you're just not a very bright boy. Look Casey, that's -- it's just -- that's not fair to me or your dad.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but look what happened. You guys were like, smiling at each other.",
        "Margo: Yes, yes we were. And things are better now.",
        "Casey: And the wedding will be the best.",
        "Margo: Don't push it. But thanks.",

        "Security guard: People, this is a restricted area.",
        "Man: Why'd you put it in your contest, man?",
        "Twin #1: It's a scam to make sure nobody wins, right?",
        "Nun: Is this a fraud, Mrs. Walsh?",
        "Lucinda: Oh Sister, no, of course not!",
        "Man: You maybe lookin' at one ugly lawsuit, lady.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah? Really, what law school taught you that nugget of wisdom?",
        "Man: Boalt Hall, Class of '88.",
        "Lucinda: Then you ought to know that you cannot obtain my office with impunity. This is absurd.",
        "Beatrice: I checked with legal. Fuzzface is right. If the key is in here and we bar people from looking for it, it could be construed as fraud. And the publicity would be horrible.",
        "Lucinda: So I'm obligated to allow these --",
        "Beatrice: Paying customers and loyal readers.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yes! All them to roam through the executive suite at will.",
        "Beatrice: I'll check with legal and make sure they protect whatever they can.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you, darling. People, I'm going into my office and I'm going to lock the door. Beatrice, bring me the severed head of the editor who dreamed of this. Oh, darling, darling really the hunting is much better outside. It'll work out, you'll find it.",
        "Twin #1: But I --",
        "Lucinda: Yes you will, you will. How did you do that? Come on, get out of here.",
        "Twin #2: I have an idea. Did you bring the crowbar?",
        "Lucinda: Beatrice! Call my masseur. I'm going to need him right after my meeting.",
        "Twin #2: Kevin Canavan was seen on the first floor. Maybe we should try there.",
        "Aaron: Mrs. Grimaldi? Hey, any luck with the rest of the clue?",
        "Lisa: No, not yet. Are you there?",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah. Yeah I'm here. And there's a lot of people here. Including Kevin Canavan.",
        "Lisa: Is that the boy who has also five keys?",
        "Aaron: Yes, ma'am. So you understand the problem.",
        "Lisa: I'm on it.",
        "Aaron: It's starting to get nuts.",
        "Beatrice: No! Please, I have to insist. Sue me, but don't mess with my files!",
        "Man: Give me that! This is a contest!",
        "Aaron: Did you hear that?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, okay. Go. Go, go. And let me think.",

        "Alison: Yeah?",
        "Chris: Yeah, he got your spirit.",
        "Alison: Done. I can't believe how easy this is when we both do it -- and fun.",
        "Chris: That's how it should be. How it will be. No more distractions, I promise.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Alison: Oh, it's Aaron. I better get this. Hello?",
        "Aaron: Finally! Why didn't you answer my messages? Better yet, why didn't you show up at metro this morning?",
        "Alison: What's going on?",
        "Aaron: Did you just ask me what -- oh, you know what, not much, Ali.",
        "Alison: Aaron?",
        "Aaron: The clue, the clue! The last clue to the contest.",
        "Alison: Oh my God, I totally forgot! Where are you?",
        "Aaron: Look, the key is somewhere in the \"City Times\" office.",
        "Alison: Are you sure?",
        "Aaron: Uh, yeah. There right now watching two nuns dismantle a desk and a Billy Gibbons look-alike just threatened to sue Lucinda Walsh. Ali, it's a zoo.",
        "Alison: So nobody's found it yet?",
        "Aaron: No, nobody. Ali, but listen. Kevin is in the building.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Aaron: But if you want any chance of getting that prize, you better get here fast.",
        "Alison: I'm on my way. Don't let anybody get their hands on that key. Is it okay?",

        "Cop: Well, that's what I'm here for. If you'll come to the station --",
        "Julia: No, look, forget it. I know you mean well, it's the best you can offer, all that. But even with a restraining order, if he shows up again, the best you can do is what? Hold him a couple of days. That's not gonna stop Les Sweeney. It barely slows him down. Thank you. But no thank you.",
        "Jack: You know what, let me handle this. I'll bring her down myself.",
        "St. Genevieve cop: Thanks. I've alerted the patrol cars in the neighborhood, but --",
        "Jack: I got it. Don't worry. Thank you. Something tells me you've been down this road a couple times.",
