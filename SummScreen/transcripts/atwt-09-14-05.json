        "Maddie: I got the paper.",
        "Henry: Great. Leave the want ads and put the rest inside.",
        "Maddie: Henry, I think Katie believed you last night.",
        "Henry: Oh, if she believes in miracles maybe, but I haven't been to Lourdes lately, so -- I am the con who cried wolf, little sister. The only reason that Katie and Mike didn't throw us out last night is because they were too shocked to go to plan B.",
        "Maddie: No. Katie let us stay because she still loves you.",
        "Henry: In her fashion, she does, yeah. But the jig is up. Hey, look on the bright side. The next place we have will have a stunning view of the turnpike.",
        "Maddie: Oh, come on. We are not gonna get shipped back to that limo.",
        "Henry: You wanna bet?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, actually, I do. I'll bet you another cup of coffee.",
        "Henry: Great. It might be my last one that doesn't come in a paper cup.",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Maddie: Good, you guys are up. Henry wants to take us all out for breakfast to celebrate his recovery.",
        "Henry: That's right. Sky's the limit. Al's, anyone?",
        "Mike: Hmm, look at the big spender. Did you sell your miracle cure to the tabloids already?",
        "[Henry chuckles]",
        "Henry: Yeah, I don't think anybody would believe it. I can hardly believe it myself. The one minute I'm flat on my back, and the next minute, I'm strong as a horse --",
        "Katie: No more lies, Henry, please. I heard enough last night. Were you ever really hurt, or was it just a con to keep me away from Mike?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Detective Munson. Well, tell him I need to speak to him. Dusty Donovan. Tell him it's urgent. Tell him it's a family matter, all right?",
        "Meg: Visiting the infirm? And your good deeds never end.",
        "Dusty: Emma told me that you got a job here.",
        "Meg: Oh, so you thought my first day would be a great time for a dire warning to steer clear of Jennifer? Relax, Dusty. I'll never go near her again.",
        "Dusty: Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. I need your help. You're the only one I can turn to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Where's your brother?",
        "Paul: He's on his way. I wanted his take on what happened with Gwen yesterday.",
        "Emily: Oh, Gwen -- the courthouse. You know what? I got to get going over to the courthouse, figure out what's going on.",
        "Paul: All right. Well, call me when you know something.",
        "Emily: Okay, will do. Hey.",
        "Paul: Hey, Will. Thanks for coming.",
        "Will: Yeah. Paul, what's going on?",
        "Will: I just wanted to touch base.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you know what, I was just leaving. So I've got some errands to run. You sit down here and catch up with your brother. I'll take this to go. I'll see you later.",
        "Paul: All right, see you later.",
        "Will: Sorry, I didn't mean to scare her off.",
        "Paul: No, she was leaving anyway.",
        "Will: So what did you want to talk about?",
        "Paul: I heard something happened with Gwen yesterday.",
        "Will: Who told you that?",
        "Paul: Carly and Emily are still friends. Gwen okay?",
        "Will: What do you care?",
        "Paul: She's your friend.",
        "Will: She was my friend.",
        "Paul: Something happen with you guys?",
        "Will: We had a fight.",
        "Paul: About what?",
        "Will: Gwen had a visit with the baby yesterday. And I guess -- I don't know how -- but right in the middle of it, she fell asleep.",
        "Paul: Gwen fell asleep?",
        "Will: Yeah, she didn't mean to. When she woke up, the baby was gone. Everything's okay. He wasn't taken or anything, but she said it's a plot against her.",
        "Paul: And you don't think it is?",
        "Will: That's why we got in the fight. She said Carly drugged her, and then she said that Casey's mother and great-grandmother were in on it. And that's just crazy.",
        "Paul: All right. I am so sorry.",
        "Will: Me, too. Now the only person on her side is her lawyer.",
        "Paul: Good lawyer, though.",
        "Will: Sometimes, I'm not so sure. I think Cass is more interested in money than he is the baby.",
        "Paul: I think he's probably most interested in winning.",
        "Will: I should probably go down to the courtroom and see how the hearing's going.",
        "Paul: No, don't. Don't. You don't need to go near that courtroom. Do yourself a favor, Will, and put some distance between you and Gwen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: And?",
        "Gwen: Look, I know what I have to say --",
        "Cass: Come on, I want to hear the words.",
        "Gwen: And since then, I realized I had to change my lifestyle.",
        "Cass: All of them.",
        "Gwen: I regret my promiscuity.",
        "Cass: Excellent. \"And from now on, will devote the rest of my life to raising my son.\"",
        "Gwen: And from now on, will devote the rest of my life to raising my son.",
        "Cass: I may cry.",
        "Gwen: I wrote something myself. I'd like to tell the judge in my own words.",
        "Cass: You tell the judge what I tell you to tell the judge.",
        "Gwen: But what about yesterday?",
        "Cass: Forget about yesterday.",
        "Gwen: Forget that Carly drugged me?",
        "Cass: Do you hear me? Are words coming out of my mouth?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but he has to know.",
        "Cass: If you open your mouth about what happened to that baby yesterday, there isn't a judge in the state of Illinois that will let you walk out of that courtroom with your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Oh, look who's home. You want to get a little cuddle before he has his bath?",
        "Jack: I should really wash up.",
        "Carly: Long night?",
        "Ellen: The water's ready for his bath, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Carly: Oh, okay. Thanks, Ellen. There you go. All right. [Baby fusses] You look exhausted. Why don't you get a shower before court?",
        "Jack: You know, Carly, I was up all night trying to figure out what really happened yesterday.",
        "Carly: Jack, we'll talk about everything, I promise. After the hearing.",
        "Jack: No, we'll talk about it now. I want you to go to that judge before the hearing starts and tell him what you did.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to have some private meeting with the judge, Jack. I can't do that.",
        "Jack: If we end up with Rory, it's got to be for the right reasons. Your sister would not want us to win custody with dirty tricks.",
        "Carly: I'll tell you what my sister wouldn't want! She wouldn't want Gwen raising her baby. She doesn't have any idea how to be a mother, Jack.",
        "Jack: You don't know that.",
        "Carly: Yes, I do. Just look at her. Look at her anger, her defiance. I know that girl -- how she thinks, how she's wired. She's fighting for the baby for purely selfish reasons. She just doesn't want anybody else to have something that's supposed to be hers. But in a few months, she's going to start to resent him, for getting in her way, for keeping her from having fun. I know that in my heart.",
        "Jack: You don't know what Gwen will do. That's why you've got to tell the judge the truth.",
        "Carly: The only truth that matters is what's best for Rory.",
        "Jack: At what cost?",
        "Carly: At any cost! She has no money. She has no future. She has no idea how to raise a child, Jack.",
        "Jack: She should learn, honey. You did. Damn it, Carly, they way we live, the things we do, set an example for our children. Now, if the boys or Sage ever found out what you pulled yesterday --",
        "Carly: I will tell them that I did it to keep Rory safe. And that I will do anything to keep them safe, too. You want me to be sorry. But I'm not. Jack, I know this isn't your style. I know you think I've crossed a line. But I really need you to come to that hearing with me today.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm sorry. I can't do that. It's getting late. You better get going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What is with all these accusations? Aren't you just happy that Henry's better?",
        "Katie: That's not the point, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: What else matters? Come on, you guys are friends.",
        "Henry: No, look, don't blame them here. This is a lot to take in. One minute I'm a slug and the next, I'm ready to don my tap shoes.",
        "Katie: Oh, God, forget it! Forget it. So much for giving him a chance to come clean.",
        "Henry: No, wait, wait, wait. Katie -- you asked an honest question, you deserve an honest answer. I did fall, I was hurt -- and I got better.",
        "Katie: When?",
        "Henry: Before yesterday.",
        "Mike: How long before?",
        "Maddie: What does it matter?",
        "Katie: Henry, you didn't have to pretend.",
        "Henry: Pretending seemed a lot easier than getting down on my knees and begging for a roof over our heads.",
        "Katie: If you needed a place to stay, you could have just asked.",
        "Henry: I know, I know that. That's the problem.",
        "Katie: What is the problem?",
        "Maddie: He was too proud.",
        "Mike: But not too proud to pretend he was an invalid.",
        "Katie: And what about the rest of it?",
        "Mike: The flowers --",
        "Katie: The sweater --",
        "Mike: -- From Katie's secret admirer. It was you, wasn't it?",
        "Katie: Not Simon.",
        "Henry: Wait, wait, wait. You that think I --",
        "Mike: No, no, no. That's just ridiculous, Henry.",
        "Henry: No, no, wait. You're way off on this, Mike. Way off.",
        "Mike: Am I? Give me one good reason I shouldn't put you back in that wheelchair.",
        "Maddie: Me! I'm the reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So you've found something I might actually be good for? Can't wait to hear this.",
        "Dusty: I need some information about a drug.",
        "Meg: Call your pharmacist.",
        "Dusty: Wait a second, not the legal kind.",
        "Meg: What, your sources dry up?",
        "Dusty: I need a medical perspective. And you've seen a lot, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, you won't believe what comes through the E.R.",
        "Dusty: You ever treat someone on crystal meth?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dusty: Can you give me a quick rundown?",
        "Meg: Meth makes hell look like a five-star hotel. What you think you know doesn't even come close to how bad it really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Jen, hey. How's it going?",
        "Jennifer: Hey, fine, fine. I came to get my coffee fix.",
        "Emily: No better place. You sure you're okay, sweetie?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm just really tired. I stayed up until, like, 4:00 A.M., sketching.",
        "Emily: That's pushing it, don't you think? I mean, I'm all for creativity, but need to take care of yourself, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, yeah. Will do.",
        "Emily: Why don't you take a break and go sit down. Your brothers are inside.",
        "Jennifer: Great, thanks.",
        "Emily: I'll see you around?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You know, if she just admitted that she made a mistake, I'd be okay. I understand, I get it. You know, she fell asleep because she was exhausted. I would be, too, if I was working double shifts.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but you wouldn't point the finger at innocent people. I mean, Nancy Hughes? Come on. This is a pattern with this girl. When things get rough, she points at everybody else. And you are a really good guy, will. But you get sucked in by needy people.",
        "Will: She used to be straight with me. Now nothing makes sense. She's got this ton of cash, I have no idea where it came from.",
        "Paul: Gwen has money?",
        "Will: Yeah, out of nowhere.",
        "Paul: She didn't tell you where it came from?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Paul: Well, she has been been working a lot of double shifts.",
        "Will: I don't care if she was working triple shifts, there's no way she would have saved that much money.",
        "Paul: Maybe she has family?",
        "Will: No, she's not close with her family. Something going on, she won't tell me what. It's weird. How do I get her to trust me again?",
        "Paul: It's a tough call, Will. But sometimes, when things get this bad, the only thing left to do is walk away from the friendship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Todd: Where's Jack?",
        "Carly: He's at home with the kids.",
        "Ms. Todd: He's not coming?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Ms. Todd: Well, you're the last one here. Let's take our seats.",
        "Carly: It's okay without Jack?",
        "Ms. Todd: It's not ideal.",
        "Judge: Now that your client's here, Ms. Todd, I assume we can proceed.",
        "Ms. Todd: We're sorry for the delay, your honor.",
        "Judge: We'll open the proceedings by revisiting the issue of paternity. Mr. Winthrop, you've indicated that your client would like to make a statement.",
        "Cass: She would, your honor.",
        "Gwen: Your honor, I apologize for any confusion I may have caused. I claimed that Casey Hughes was my baby's father because I honestly believed he was. And I was obviously mistaken.",
        "Judge: Go on, Miss Norbeck.",
        "Gwen: I don't know who the father is.",
        "Ms. Todd: Your honor, I'd like it to go on record that Miss Norbeck has admitted to a promiscuous lifestyle that is inconsistent with good parenting.",
        "Judge: Let her continue, counselor. Miss Norbeck, do you have any idea who the infant's father is?",
        "Gwen: No, sir.",
        "Cass: Miss Norbeck's behavior is not unlike that of many others her age, your honor. Ms. Todd's accusation of promiscuity should not serve as an indictment of this young woman's character. I'd like to enter her most recent transcript from Oakdale Latin into the record. We also obtained observations from teachers of her work ethic and her character, as well as a list of jobs that she has held in order to support herself.",
        "Judge: Very well.",
        "Cass: Your honor, there is more to Gwen Norbeck than the careless mistakes of youth. She has grown and learned from those mistakes. But most importantly, her legal position has not changed. She is the child's biological mother. And under the laws of the state of Illinois, she has every right to gain full and unchallenged custody immediately.",
        "Judge: There is still another issue which was brought to my attention a few minutes ago. An incident which occurred when Miss Norbeck had the infant in her care yesterday.",
        "Cass: Your honor, there is no basis for questioning Miss Norbeck's abilities.",
        "Judge: This police report would indicate that there was, counselor.",
        "Gwen: I was set up! Tell him what you did, Carly! Tell him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maddie, sweetie, this isn't your fight.",
        "Maddie: But you are not Katie's secret admirer.",
        "Mike: Who else could it be?",
        "Henry: Mike, she's a beautiful woman. Pull out the yellow pages and look under \"guys with great taste.\"",
        "Katie: So you swear it wasn't you?",
        "Henry: I -- you have my word as a gentleman. You have my word, at least. I am not the one that sent the gifts.",
        "Mike: You believe him?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I believe him.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. My money -- if I had any money -- my money is on Simon. You say he wouldn't send you a pink sweater, listen, maybe he got a saleswoman, a personal shopper, if you will.",
        "Mike: You know, you might be on to something there, Henry.",
        "Henry: I might?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Maybe the person who sent Katie that sweater wasn't a guy at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Lucky me. Coffee with the two of the handsomest guys in Oakdale. Hey.",
        "Paul: You want to sit down?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yeah, yeah. Thanks.",
        "Will: So, how's it going?",
        "Jennifer: Better every day. Hey, how's Gwen? I hear that she's trying to get custody of her baby. What? Are you expecting a meltdown?",
        "Paul: No --",
        "Jennifer: I'm -- I can think about other people's babies, and even their mothers and grandmothers and first cousins --",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Jennifer: I'm capable of a lot of things these days. You know, like going out and hanging out with friends. And even working.",
        "Paul: Dusty must be pleased.",
        "Jennifer: Not really. I quit Street Jeans.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Jennifer: I need something new, a fresh start.",
        "Paul: Jen, you can't turn your back on a company that you created. You built that line from the ground up.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then, I'll build something new from the ground up. And I talked to mom and we're going to partner.",
        "Will: You and Mom?",
        "Jennifer: Don't say that like it's a disease.",
        "Paul: Oh, don't worry, Will. She's joking.",
        "Jennifer: No, I'm very serious.",
        "Paul: Jen, are you feeling okay? Because \"Barbara\" and \"fresh start\" don't go together. What the hell are you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Todd: As you can see from the affidavits, your honor, Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Snyder left the child with Miss Norbeck, only to return and find him missing.",
        "Gwen: Because they framed me!",
        "Cass: Your honor, let me just state for the record that the baby was fine. He was only out of my client's sight for a matter of minutes.",
        "Ms. Todd: Miss Norbeck fell asleep, your honor. Perhaps as the result of a late night or a party --",
        "Cass: That's a baseless assumption. As for Mrs. Snyder's affidavit, given her vested interest, I find her less than objective.",
        "Ms. Todd: And what about Mrs. Hughes? She corroborates Mrs. Snyder's observations almost word for word. Where's her vested interest?",
        "Cass: Mrs. Hughes, with all due respect, is elderly and she may not be clear on the details.",
        "Ms. Todd: And your honor, the Oakdale Police Department is considering charging Miss Norbeck with child endangerment.",
        "Gwen: Because she drugged me! She's the reason I fell asleep! She did it to me! They checked the water.",
        "Cass: Sit down, Gwen.",
        "Judge: I have the report on the lab tests done on the water bottle in question, Ms. Norbeck.",
        "Gwen: Good. Read the report. I want everybody to know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Mike: Did Henry put you up to this?",
        "Henry: No. No, Mike. She's innocent.",
        "Meg: But at least I know what you get from me. What do you get from Jennifer?",
        "Iris: Uh-oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: There were no traces of any drug in your water bottle, Miss Norbeck.",
        "Gwen: No, they're wrong. Check 'em again!",
        "Cass: Gwen, please, sit down.",
        "Gwen: No, but I was --",
        "Gwen: It's a lie.",
        "Judge: Miss Norbeck, did you or did you not fall asleep while the child was in your care?",
        "Gwen: Yes. Your honor, the baby was happy with me. I just -- I remember holding him. And I remember his smile. I was excited, I wasn't tired at all. The last thing in the world that I would do is fall asleep and miss it for a moment. That's all, your honor.",
        "Judge: Mrs. Snyder, would you like to make a statement?",
        "Carly: Yes, I would. I can see that Miss Norbeck cares about the baby. I feel the same way, and I'm very sorry that one of us will be hurt by your decision. I understand that even the very best parents make mistakes, but maturity and experience, they are so important in providing a stable and healthy home for any child. Now, my husband and I, we love Rory as we love our other children. I respect that Gwen wants to raise him. But I believe as much as she wants to, that she cannot be the mother that he needs.",
        "Judge: Thank you, Mrs. Snyder. I am going to review the pertinent documents before rendering my decision. I'll ask all parties remain until that time.",
        "Emily: You okay?",
        "Jack: Not now, Emily.",
        "Emily: What's going on, Jack?",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, you weren't in on it? It's a page right out of your playbook.",
        "Emily: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Jack: Well, consider yourself lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey, wait a minute. I'm as anxious to get to the bottom of this secret admirer thing as you are. But to accuse my sister? You think a kid could pull of this scam?",
        "Mike: A kid who hates my guts. A kid who'd love to get me out of Katie's life.",
        "Katie: Maddie, I opened up my home to you. This is how you thank me?",
        "Maddie: Katie, I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: Sorry's not enough. Now we want to hear in your own words -- did Henry put you up to this?",
        "Henry: No! No, Mike. She's innocent. It was me. I'm the secret admirer.",
        "Maddie: Henry --",
        "Henry: No -- Mike and Katie deserve the truth. I wanted to confess last night. And I feel a lot better, now that I've unburdened myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Paul, be happy for me. Starting a new company is a good move, for all of us.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, every design at Street Jeans has your signature on it.",
        "Jennifer: It wasn't fun anymore.",

        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait -- where you going?",
        "Will: Seniors get to skip first period, usually, but I'm pushing it. So I'll see you later.",
        "Paul: Right. Where were we? Right, fun. You said it stopped being fun.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, well, as soon as Worldwide took over, it just -- I don't know, it was different. I feel limited and closed in.",
        "Paul: I thought Dusty was some kind of a buffer.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's what he was supposed to do. He was supposed to take care of the business end and I was supposed to take care of the rest.",
        "Paul: Right. So what went wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty just -- he has an opinion about everything, lately, from what fabric I'm supposed to use to what I eat for lunch. He just got so controlling, and it was just -- Paul, he was driving me nuts. So I got out.",

        "Meg: The symptoms are pretty obvious. Paranoia, anxiety, confusion -- the person seems euphoric and then can turn around and crash without warning.",
        "Dusty: What about physically? Is it lethal, or what?",
        "Meg: It can be. It amps up your blood pressure, gets your heart racing. It can cause damage in your blood vessels, go into your brain, cause stroke.",
        "Dusty: Is it addictive?",
        "Meg: Sometimes after one hit.",
        "Dusty: And tough to kick?",
        "Meg: It's nasty, Dusty. A lot of repeat users. So when did you find out -- about Jen?",
        "Dusty: You knew? Look at me. You knew? Why didn't you tell me? What are you doing? Were you hoping she'd self destruct before I could help her out? I am dedicated...",
        "Meg: I tried to tell you after I found the crystal meth in her purse.",
        "Dusty: When?",
        "Meg: Yesterday. But you shut me down. You made it personal. Broke your number one rule, by the way. I tried giving you this.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Is that an apology?",
        "Dusty: I didn't realize. I read your signals wrong, I guess.",
        "Meg: Well, I read you loud and clear. No one gets near Jen unless they go through you first. I went through you.",
        "Dusty: You can get rid of the sarcasm.",
        "Meg: Then you can get rid of the ego. I'm not jealous. I don't care what you and Jennifer are about.",
        "Dusty: No? You sure about that?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm sure. You and I are a good time, Dusty. I get that. You don't want a relationship? Fine, I'll deal. But at least I know what you get from me. What do you get from Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Why do I have to get anything?",
        "Meg: Because that's how it works in the human race. You give, one takes. One takes, one gives. What does Jen give?",
        "Dusty: What's your problem? Jennifer is in a bad place.",
        "Meg: Oh. Is the crystal meth helping with that?",
        "Dusty: Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you pin me up against a wall and make me listen?",
        "Meg: When I pin you up against the wall, it won't have anything to do with Jen Munson. Talk to her.",
        "Dusty: I tried. I tried talking to her. I tried talking to her mother. She got to her first, covered all her bases. I don't know what to do.",
        "Meg: Oh, so you mean you tried helping, had the best intentions and you got shot down? Welcome to the club, Donovan.",

        "Jennifer: For some crazy reason, my feeling better is a problem for Dusty.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",

        "Paul: What do you mean?",
        "Jennifer: He started -- I don't know. He started micromanaging street jeans first, and then he started micromanaging me. Watching me like a hawk. Every single thing that I did, he was worried about. Everything that I -- how I felt, what I did -- so I don't know. He must have a hero complex or something.",
        "Paul: Well, wouldn't you rather have a hero on your side than a walking head case?",
        "Jennifer: Very funny. Paul, Mom deserves a second chance, too. As much as I do.",
        "Paul: Mother has run through a dozen second chances. Where did you leave things with Dusty?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I have tried to stay friends, but he's already undermining me.",
        "Paul: How?",
        "Jennifer: Spreading rumors, telling Mom and anybody else who'll listen how worried he is about me. Now, she blew him off, but it wouldn't shock me if he comes to you next with some wild story.",
        "Paul: Well, thanks for the heads-up.",
        "Jennifer: No, please, Paul. Will you say you'll work with us at the company?",
        "Paul: With Mother?",

You sat here every day, looked her in the eye, while she cooked for you, she took care of you. You used her. You used her for her compassion. Do you hate us that much?",

        "Maddie: Oh, that is not true. You are the greatest.",
        "Henry: She's happy here. I'm happy having her here. And if you throw us out now, you're going to ruin the rest of her sweet, innocent life. Just -- look, all I can do is throw myself on your mercy and beg forgiveness.",

        "Judge: I must begin by stating that I find this a very disturbing case. The law states that Gwen Norbeck has an irrefutable right to raise her child. But when the welfare of a minor is at stake, other factors must be considered. I'm reluctant to make a final decision until I get a further evaluation of Miss Norbeck's fitness to raise said minor. In the meantime, I think it's in the best interest of the child to remain in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Snyder.",

And he knows exactly how much we value his friendship. We did everything we could try to get the three of us to a good place, and he blew it.",

        "Maddie: But you're not laughing now, though, are you?",
