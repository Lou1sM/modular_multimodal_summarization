        "Will: Okay, name your sugar rush. Fruity-o's, chocolate frosted cocoa bombs, or marshmallows and charms.",
        "Gwen: No way Carly lets her kids eat all that junk.",
        "Will: Maybe not all the time, but she and Jack are separated. My mom and dad feels so guilty when they split up, we would be eating pizza for breakfast.",
        "Gwen: Well, since it's a little too early to order from Tony's, I will have a combination of all three.",
        "Will: Oh, that's my girl.",

        "Will: Me, too.",
        "Gwen: It's kind of hard not to feel guilty for feeling so happy on a day when we're having a memorial service for our friends.",
        "Will: Well, at least the nightmare's finally over.",
        "Gwen: For us, maybe. But for a lot of other people, it's going to last a long, long time.",

        "Casey: What? And put my hands where you can see them?",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm sorry, but what do you think you're doing?",
        "Casey: Maddie never came back last night.",
        "Margo: Oh, maybe it got late.",
        "Casey: No, she's not picking up the phone either.",
        "Margo: Well, it's early.",
        "Casey: Mom, she's supposed to be with me today at that memorial. And now I don't think that's going to happen. So, I need to make sure she's all right.",
        "Margo: No, you're not going anywhere except right back to bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's official. I am no longer Mrs. Jack Snyder.",
        "Simon: And can you tell, how does it feel?",
        "Carly: Are you kidding? Fantastic! Top of the world!",
        "Simon: All right, my lie detector just blew a fuse.",
        "Carly: You're right. I've never been so miserable in my life.",
        "Simon: Well, it just so happens, I have the cure for what ails you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Grandpa, before you even say anything, today there's a memorial for the kids that didn't make it, and I need to be there with my friends to say goodbye.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, Honey, but you can't do that. It's too soon.",
        "Bob: Well, actually I stopped by to tell Casey he's good to go.",
        "Casey: Thank you.",
        "Bob: But to go from the hospital does not mean to go on the town. Promise me that you'll take it easy.",
        "Casey: All right, no iron man --",
        "Bob: And after the service, you go straight home.",
        "Casey: I promise, I promise. All right, I'm going to call Maddie, okay?",
        "Margo: Okay. Bob, you know I really don't want -- I don't want to question your judgement --",
        "Bob: Nonsense. Mothers get a free pass.",
        "Margo: Oh, good. You really think that Casey's well enough to go to this memorial?",
        "Bob: I think it would him more harm if he didn't go.",
        "Margo: He really needs to mourn the loss of his friends.",
        "Bob: What happened to those poor souls and those families is something this town is going to have to deal with for a long time.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, the high school's setting up grief counseling.",
        "Bob: That's great. But this is something the kids are doing themselves. And they can choose their own way to say goodbye and gives Casey that chance too. And one day soon down the road, he'll wake up and he will be his old self again and think that he'll live forever.",
        "Margo: Well, you're right. You always are.",

        "Bob: Whoop, incoming E.R. listen, his discharge papers and his after-care instructions are at the desk. You take care, too, Mama Bear.",
        "Margo: Okay, Papa Bear. Thanks, Bob. Well, I was just telling your granddad that he's got to stop being so overprotective.",
        "Casey: Sure you were. Mom, you don't have to worry about me.",
        "Margo: You tell me how that's going to happen. I'm so sorry, Casey. I'm so sorry that you lost your friends. I'm so sorry that you didn't get your golden summer.",
        "Casey: I'll catch the next one.",
        "Margo: Did you get a hold of Maddie?",
        "Casey: No, she's still not picking up. Mom, she thinks that everyone's blaming her for everything. There's no way I'm going to the service without her.",
        "Margo: Good, that's my boy. I think it's time that Maddie came out of hiding. The memorial will do her good.",
        "Casey: Good, so, can you give me a lift to the Lakeview to track her down?",
        "Margo: I will, but Casey, we have to let this be Maddie's decision. We can't force her to do anything --",
        "Casey: No, she just needs a little support. You know, if she knew how much I wanted her to be there, then she'd go.",
        "Margo: Honey, I think that her not calling you is her way of saying no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, no pressure, but I was thinking maybe you'd like to move back home.",
        "Gwen: I'm already there.",

        "Will: We can do it.",
        "Gwen: Okay, you got to go. You're going to be late. You're in charge of the service.",
        "Will: What about you?",
        "Gwen: I'm going to clean up and then I'm going to take Carly's car. I got to stop at crash, pick up music. I'm going to clean up the breakfast stuff and take Carly's car.",
        "Will: Okay, I'll miss you.",
        "Gwen: I'll miss you more.",
        "Barbara: Just when I thought that I didn't have one more good morning in me.",
        "Will: Hi, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Hi, you. How's Gwen?",
        "Will: She's great. She's the best. See for yourself.",
        "Barbara: Okay, bye. You look wonderful. Should you be standing on that leg?",
        "Gwen: It's -- you know, the leg's fine. I'm not ready to river dance quite like yourself yet, but I'm feeling okay. And I'm actually in a rush because I'm going to be late.",
        "Barbara: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast. I'm not about to ignore what I just saw. And if my son isn't going to stick around to explain it, you're going to.",
        "Gwen: Explain what?",
        "Barbara: That kiss. Does that mean that you two are back together?",
        "Gwen: You figure it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What time is it?",
        "Meg: Early. Looks like you did a full shift.",
        "Paul: I guess I fell asleep.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I see that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you know, I didn't want to leave until that I knew that the baby was okay.",
        "Meg: Oh, when did you graduate medical school?",
        "Paul: I didn't go to medical school.",
        "Meg: This is a hospital, Paul. Fully staffed and equipped to take care of Emily and the baby.",
        "Paul: I just fell asleep.",
        "Emily: Paul, you're still here. You said you'd stay, but I honestly didn't think you meant it --",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Emily: I had a dream. We had a daughter. We were with our baby girl. And the sun was shining and suddenly it got really dark out. And rain started coming down in sheets. And the streets started flooding. I begged you to save the baby. But you promised that you would save the both of us. And you did. You pulled us to safety. You did that. And then the rain stopped and the sun was shining again.",
        "Meg: Well, just like in the movies.",
        "Emily: Is Dr. Schiller in yet this morning?",
        "Meg: No, not according to your chart.",
        "Emily: Could you go find her please? I would like a professional opinion about how my baby's doing.",
        "Meg: No problem.",
        "Paul: I'm going to go, too. See if I can't find the doctor --",
        "Emily: Paul, please. Please, don't go. I need you. We both do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Gracias. All right, pay attention class. You're divorced. You're depressed. You want all the pain to go away. So, step right up and partake of dr. Frasier's miracle tonic. One sip and you'll be smiling. One drink, and you'll be bringing down the house. Two drinks, and the guy at the front desk will start to look like George Clooney. And after the pain goes away, we'll hit every night spot on the island and party until the sun comes up. Repeat the process until one day you wake up in the morning and you go, \"Jack, Jack who?\"",
        "Carly: I see. Drink. Party. Amnesia.",
        "Simon: Oh, I forgot to mention, you also get to take the glasses home as a souvenir.",
        "Carly: Oh, so where do you keep yours, Simon? The one that reminds you how completely over Katie you are? That's why you pushed me to get this quickie divorce, isn't it? Because if Jack and I could be over, well, then maybe, you and Katie could be over, too. So, the hard sells. Drinks, a little dancing, and happy days are here again.",
        "Simon: Well, there you go. Worked for me. I've never been happier.",
        "Carly: Now who's lying?",
        "Simon: All right, touch\u00e9, you got me. I admit to a twinge every now and again. When you've loved someone so passionately, they're deep in your bones, you can't forget about them overnight. But you do get over it. Slowly but surely.",
        "Carly: With the help of Dr. Frasier's miracle tonic.",
        "Simon: Of course, that and the right amount of time. Last time I was here, I sat hours on end, on that stool. I was a miserable wreck. Look at me now.",
        "Carly: Yeah, look at you now. You can't even say the \"K\" word.",
        "Simon: Oh, Katie, Katie. Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie. See? Not a scratch of me. With the right amount of time, I realized that Katie and I just weren't meant to be. Now, you follow my lead, very soon, you'll feel the same way about you- know who.",
        "Carly: It's just strange. Waiting in a line for your divorce to be processed. You know, they actually give you a number, like -- like you're waiting to buy lunch meat or something. And you don't know really whether you want the line to move quickly or slowly. Then, your number's called. And you pay your 200 bucks and one stamp, marriage over.",
        "Simon: And you're on to the next big adventure. Looking forward, not back. Carly, I've seen the future, and we are it. Our prospects are huge. Now, that building project back home, that is the birth of an empire.",
        "Carly: Well, let's hope so.",
        "Simon: The sky's the limit. Sweetie, you and your kids are going to want from nothing. Money, your money worries, they're finished.",
        "Carly: I like the second of that.",
        "Simon: So, let's declare this your independence day. Come on, raise your glass. Toast, to new beginnings.",
        "Carly: Hey, isn't that George Kirby?",
        "Simon: Yeah. George Kirby, what the hell is our star investor doing here in Santo Domingo? George! Join us for a drink. George! Whoa, whoa, whoa, George. What are you doing?",
        "Carly: Wait, why is he running off?",
        "George: I'm sorry. I -- with everything else, I didn't want to face you with the news.",
        "Simon: What news?",
        "Carly: What news?",
        "George: Due to circumstances beyond -- due to circumstances, I'm afraid I'm forced to pull out of your business enterprise.",
        "Carly: Like hell you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: My blood pressure could go up again, and I could have another pre- eclampsia attack and that can effect the baby. We both know what can happen --",
        "Dr. Schiller: I'm happy to report that both mother and baby seem to be just fine.",
        "Paul: Wait, see. Nothing to worry about.",
        "Emily: But my blood pressure was sky high --",
        "Dr. Schiller: And we were able to bring it back down to normal. Based on your overnight readings, I think it's safe to spring you from this joint.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Dr. Schiller: I mean, we need to you to be comfortable right? And you would be much more comfortable at home than here.",
        "Paul: I think that's a great idea, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I just need to examine you before I sign off on the release.",
        "Paul: Then, I'll get out of your way --",
        "Emily: No, no, you don't have to go. It's okay.",
        "Paul: Don't worry. I'll be right outside.",
        "Meg: Shouldn't you be in there? After all, Emily's life is in your hands.",
        "Paul: You know, I was really worried about Emily and the baby.",
        "Meg: I know. I'm sorry. See how crazy this is making me?",
        "Paul: What? You don't think it makes me nuts?",
        "Meg: No, I don't.",
        "Paul: What would you call someone who would stay up all night holding his ex- wife's hand?",
        "Meg: An enabler.",
        "Paul: Will you stop it?",
        "Meg: You being there to hold her hand whenever she has a meltdown. Paul, you're creating a monster. All that's missing are the neck bolts.",
        "Paul: Look, I feel responsible. I mean, the whole reason that Emily had the latest pre-eclamptic attack was because I told her that Craig Montgomery wasn't going to sell me the newspaper.",
        "Meg: So, what is it going to be the next time? Emily finds out we're engaged, and you have to call 911?",
        "Paul: I know this is really hard on you.",
        "Meg: It's not about jealousy, okay? It just seems that every time you're around, holding her hand, she takes advantage of the episodes like last night, just to get close to you.",
        "Paul: What do you want me to do? This is a very small town. The changes of Emily running into me again --",
        "Meg: Just got shot down to zero.",
        "Paul: Well how? Aside from me falling off the face of the planet --",
        "Meg: That's exactly what you're going to do. And it's going to be one big happy landing for both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Your sister did those things, not you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Maddie: Casey, you have to give up on me. Please. Hi, Henry. How's Chicago? Yeah, I bet. I know. They're probably really freaked out, huh? I'm fine. Great. Really. Yes, I'm pulling an all media blackout, as per your orders. No, no newspapers. Casey? He's good. I just saw him yesterday at the hospital. No, I haven't run into any of the other kids. But they've been totally supportive. Sending cards and emails. [Knock on the door] You know what? That's Lisa. I really have to go. Okay, I love you, too. Bye. [Knock on the door] Lisa, I'm okay. I don't need any breakfast. I don't need anything, okay?",
        "Casey: Maddie, it's me. I need to talk to you and I'm not leaving until it happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ada: Here's one of Maddie.",
        "Liv: Now that is someone that I would not want to be right now.",
        "Gil: Even though it turned out that she wasn't the Slasher?",
        "Liv: Picture people everywhere you go. Keeping their distance. Staring. Waiting for you to turn around like your crazy sister.",
        "Will: Well, then don't stare. When Maddie gets here, just treat her like a friend.",
        "Ada: You think she'll even show?",
        "Will: I don't know. But if she does, we all need to do our best to make sure that she doesn't feel any worse.",
        "Gil: What else can we do?",
        "Will: Actually, some of the parents are coming by early to lay some stuff down for the children at the altar. So, I think it would be nice if you were here to meet them.",
        "Gil: All right.",
        "Gwen: So, you'll stick by me? Get me through this?",
        "Will: I will. And you with me?",
        "Gwen: I will.",
        "Jade: Wow. Will, you've done an amazing job.",
        "Will: Thanks. The service doesn't start for awhile, so you can wait if you want.",
        "Jade: I couldn't imagine. Those poor parents having to say goodbye to their children.",
        "Will: Well, you don't always get a choice.",
        "Jade: Oh, will, I'm sorry. Your sister. I wasn't thinking.",
        "Will: Nah, forget it. It's fine. Have a seat.",
        "Jade: Well, actually, I didn't come here for the memorial. I came here to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Casey: I think if we can get through today, we can get through anything.",
        "Jade: What? Move on?",
        "Will: Yeah, I think it's a good idea if you and I do the same.",
        "Jade: Then, you better think again.",
        "Carly: We just lost our major investor.",
        "Simon: I've got something much better than money on my side.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Simon: Oh, like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You cannot back out of our building project.",
        "George: I'm afraid it's beyond my control --",
        "Carly: Do you know what a contract is, George?",
        "George: Of course --",
        "Carly: It's an agreement between two parties that when signed, is legal and binding. You signed such an agreement.",
        "George: And I signed it in good faith.",
        "Carly: Good faith? What the hell does that mean?",
        "George: It means I believed in your project and I was going to back it with everything I had. Until I went broke.",
        "Carly: Oh, don't you dare? Don't you dare cry poverty to me!",
        "George: It's true. I barely have enough to cover my bar tab.",
        "Carly: Since when?",
        "George: Since a few investments I made came back to bite me. Well, now that the money's gone, so's my wife. I know sorry won't cut it.",
        "Carly: You're damn right it doesn't. Sorry doesn't finish this project. And your lame excuses don't pay the bills. Now, you honor that contract. You honor your word, or we'll sic our lawyers on you so fast, you won't know what hit you!",
        "Simon: Whoa!",
        "Carly: What is that?",
        "Simon: That guy was lucky he got away with his life. You're a regular spitfire.",
        "Carly: What are you smiling about? We just lost our major investor!",
        "Simon: I got something much better than money on my side.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Simon: Oh, like you.",

        "Meg: Paul, as long as you're in town, you're still in range for an sos. But if, say you were going to take a trip somewhere? Well, that would make Emily finally learn to cope on her own.",
        "Paul: I don't want to take a trip. And I don't want to go anywhere without you.",
        "Meg: Look, look, it's not like I want you to go away -- I'd miss you like mad. But as hard as it is for me not to see you, at least I won't be taking the backseat to your ex-wife.",
        "Paul: You know it's not even about Emily. It's about how her meltdowns affect my baby.",
        "Meg: But don't you think it's a little weird that these meltdowns happen when she's with you? And these crises may be real, but she's milking them for all they're worth, so she can get as much as your time and attention. And it's got to stop.",
        "Paul: If I'm gone, who's going to look after her?",
        "Meg: Well, between Susan and Henry, she'll be fully covered.",
        "Paul: You know, you're right. This is getting completely out of control. So, maybe I should go away, but -- I'm not going anywhere without you.",
        "Meg: Paul, you know I can't leave. I mean, I just got reinstated. Asking for time off is not an option --",
        "Paul: Then I won't go.",
        "Meg: But we just thought it would be a good idea --",
        "Paul: No, no, what I mean is, Emily won't know. She'll think I'm far, far away, but I'll just tell her that and in the meantime, I'll hide out at my place.",
        "Meg: Do you remember what happened the last time you lied to Emily? You got a 16-caliber surprise.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm willing to take the chance, if it breaks her dependency. I think it might be kind of fun. You know, sneaking around with you. Stolen moments. Secret rendezvous.",
        "Meg: As long as Emily doesn't catch us.",
        "Paul: You leave Emily to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I never got a chance to thank you for defending me at raven lake, when I was suddenly getting accused of being the Slasher.",
        "Will: Well, you don't have to thank me.",
        "Jade: Maybe not. We've always had that unspoken something -- you look out for me, I look out for you.",
        "Will: I'm glad everything worked out.",
        "Jade: Yeah, like when you were accused of being a murderer, and I was your alibi.",
        "Will: Except I didn't really need an alibi.",
        "Jade: Oh right. You saved Gwen. But I was the only one that believed you. You know, your wife just stood by while everybody was treating you like a prime suspect.",
        "Will: Listen, Jade, while you're here, there's something I need to tell you.",
        "Jade: Will, you don't have to thank me either. I know how you are in your heart.",
        "Will: No, there's something you gotta hear from me -- something you need to know, okay? Gwen and I are back together.",

        "Barbara: I am so happy. Now we have to make that little tramp move on as well.",
        "Gwen: Come on Barbara, we were having such a good time.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry -- I don't mean to rain on your happy news, but she is determined to work her wiles on your husband.",
        "Gwen: Wiles. Wow. Wiles?",
        "Barbara: She clearly wants to insinuate herself into his life and trust fund.",
        "Gwen: It's not going to happen. Because he is in love with me. And I have too much to be grateful for to worry about some girl named Jade.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, you're right. Shame on me.",
        "Gwen: It's okay, you're just being a mom.",
        "Barbara: Yes I am. And you two have so much to look forward to -- like college.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yes. If will passes his ged, we could graduate by the year 2010.",
        "Barbara: I bet with all this chaos going on, you haven't had time to shop for your back-to-school wardrobe, have you?",
        "Gwen: I don't think I do wardrobe.",
        "Barbara: No, but you have a very unique and creative look. You're a beautiful girl. You have great style. I'd like to take you shopping. Jennifer and I used to do that before school started. We would get all dressed up and we'd go down to Brindel's department store and shop and have lunch in the tea room.",
        "Gwen: Barbara, maybe you don't need to go to another memorial service right now.",
        "Barbara: You know, they say death gives us memories so we'll have roses in winter. I think I'll have a lot of roses this winter. And I am just so thankful that Jennifer was at peace when she died. And unlike all those parents today, I had the chance to say goodbye to my child. So I want to be there for those who weren't so lucky. I'm gonna go. You can call me about shopping anytime.",
        "Gwen: Barbara, wait. Actually, could I get a ride with you? Because Carly's car is acting kinda funny. And I thought, you know, maybe we could go together -- I've got to stop at Crash and pick up some music and maybe we could drive by the windows of that department store, Brindel's?",

        "Maddie: You shouldn't be here. You should be back at the hospital resting.",
        "Casey: My grandfather set me free, actually. My parents are in the car waiting for us to take us to the memorial service.",
        "Maddie: Today? I didn't know. I mean, I figured that there would be one.",
        "Casey: Will set it up. He's going with Gwen.",

        "Maddie: They still blame me.",
        "Casey: You don't know that, either.",
        "Maddie: Yes, I do. That's why I didn't come back to the hospital.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I noticed that.",
        "Maddie: I heard Ada and Gil talking about me.",
        "Casey: Is that what this is about? Don't you get it? What they think doesn't matter. Do this for me.",
        "Maddie: I am doing this for you. If you show up at the church with me, people are gonna look at you like you've lost your mind having anything to do with me. And you don't need that right now.",
        "Casey: What I need is for you to be there with me today, holding my hand. You know, us together. Like it was before this whole mess started.",
        "Maddie: Casey, are you okay?",
        "Casey: I just need to sit down.",
        "Maddie: You okay? This is why you don't need me today.",
        "Casey: This is why I do need you.",
        "Maddie: You need to get better. You need to concentrate on yourself and just forget about me, okay.",
        "Casey: There she is. The bossy old Maddie that used to live with my parents.",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: No, it's fine. I've missed it, actually. I have no idea what today's gonna be like. My parents, they think they know what we've been through, but they don't. Only we do.",
        "Maddie: You're right.",
        "Casey: My mom said not to push you away. But I think if we can get through today, we can get through anything.",

        "Carly: How? You said yourself, he was our biggest investor.",
        "Simon: He's not the only guy with money in the world. I'll make a solemn promise to you, right here, right now. That you and your kids are gonna be fine. That I will find the capitol to finish our building project. Do not worry.",
        "Carly: In the meantime, though, it's back to the drawing board.",
        "Simon: The good thing about drawing boards is you can make it up as you go along.",
        "Carly: It's just, seems so incredibly unfair! Just when you think your day couldn't possibly get any lousier.",
        "Simon: Listen to me, all right. I'm gonna find the money. Paints, carpets, shiny fixtures are all gonna be delivered. Contractors will paid on schedule, and Frasier Towers will be our showcase. Then we're gonna sell the units off one by one and move onto the next thing.",
        "Carly: Well, Simon it seems like quite a challenge.",
        "Simon: I hope that I don't have to face it alone. It's gonna be a lot of hard work, but I know you're not afraid of that. I also know that as long as you are with me, we will get the job done. Carly? Don't do that. You are with me, aren't you?",
