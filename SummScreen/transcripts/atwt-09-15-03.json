        "When Alison and Chris left for a date, Susan poured herself a drink. Thinking better of it, she poured it out and put the bottle back in her purse. After paying off Henry to let them use the cottage for a few hours, Alison and Chris stopped by to check on Susan, and Alison found the bottle. Jessica told Bonnie it was best that she move out, then cried on Ben's shoulder. He told her it was time that she lead her own life; she said she was ready to feel safe with him again, and said she wanted him to make love to her. Isaac told Bonnie that they were through, and that he was leaving town. Molly agreed to finance the Java Underground renovations. Craig said that no one must know that she invested, not realizing that Carly had already spilled the beans to Rosanna. When Craig lied to her and said that Dusty was working on financing, Rosanna said that she needed honesty, and couldn't stay married to Craig. Jen told Dusty that Paul had lied to her, and she no longer trusted him. She said that she knew Dusty wouldn't lie to her, and begged him to make love to her. At first, he resisted, but started to give in, just as Molly walked in on their kiss."

        "Chris: Hello, beautiful.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Susan: Hello, Chris.",
        "Chris: Hi, Susan. Good to see you. You ready?",
        "Alison: Yeah, um, just hold on for just a minute, please? Mom? Are you going to be okay?",
        "Susan: Of course. Of course I am.",
        "Alison: Well, Emily can't stop by, so I feel a little funny about leaving you here by yourself.",
        "Susan: Honey, you two have been baby-sitting me 'round the clock. I can manage one evening by myself. Now go on, go on. Have fun.",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Susan: Bye.",
        "Chris: Your mother seemed a lot better tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You're telling me to move out?",
        "Jessica: How can we keep having the same fight over and over again?",
        "Bonnie: Well, if you would just be on my side for once --",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, I am on your side. I am always on your side. But I just can't sit and watch you step in it with Marshall and this poor child and not try to make things right.",
        "Bonnie: You still don't get it mom. I could have forced him to share custody of her with me.",
        "Jessica: And that would have been a disaster. Bonnie, sweetheart, if we can't even agree to disagree, I just don't know how we can live under the same roof.",
        "Bonnie: So your answer is to kick me out?",
        "Jessica: I just think it would be better if you got your own place. And that way I won't be tempted to interfere with your decisions.",
        "Bonnie: All right, Mom. But there's one thing you should know. If I leave tonight, I'm not coming back. Ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Let me say this out loud so there's no misunderstanding. You are willing to write a check for whatever dusty and I need for the new club, no questions asked?",
        "Molly: That's right.",
        "Craig: And your only condition is that your reason stays your business and yours alone?",
        "Molly: Smart boy, Craig. So, do we have a deal?",
        "Craig: Do fish swim?",
        "Molly: Oakdale is going to be knocked off its axis, isn't it?",
        "Craig: By our club? You betcha.",
        "Molly: Well, I'm not talking about only the club. I'm talking about when people find out that you and I are teaming up.",
        "Craig: Well, molly -- and I hate to interrupt anybody handing me money, but I have a condition, too.",
        "Molly: Copycat. What's yours?",
        "Craig: You don't want anyone to know your reasons for investing? I don't want anyone to know you're the investor.",
        "Molly: Wait a minute. It's my money, but you want it to be a big secret? Should I be insulted?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. It's my problem, not yours.",
        "Molly: And let me guess. The name of your problem is Rosanna?",
        "Craig: For various reasons, for various personal reasons, my loving wife Rosanna has decided to pull her money out of Java Underground. Dusty and I need a new investor. And we thought that you would be the perfect fit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, my timing is terrible. You've had an awful day. Why don't I talk to you tomorrow.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no. You came to tell me something. What is it? About Craig?",
        "Carly: It's not important.",
        "Rosanna: Look, whatever it is, it can't be as bad as finding out he sabotaged our plans to adopt. Just tell me. I can handle it. Okay, maybe I can't. But whatever it is, I need to know. Please tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That's a hell of an opener, kid. What's your game plan?",
        "Jennifer: It's not a game. I want to be with you tonight, Dusty. I need to. I think you need to be with me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You know, there -- there's still something I still don't get. You wanted me out of Marshall 's way, right?",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, that's what I've been saying.",
        "Bonnie: And in order to do that, though, you have interfered with every single plan I've had with Sarah.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, Marshall has the means and the resources to hurt you. If you keep stepping on his toes, there's no telling what he'd be inclined to do. And you could lose all hope of seeing Sarah again.",
        "Bonnie: But that's exactly what happened anyway, mom, isn't it? I lost her! And I'm sorry, but I can't help to feel like all of this is happening because of your interference.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well that's why you should get your own place. So I can't interfere and you can't blame me.",
        "Bonnie: Well, great. Great. I've lost Sarah, and now I've lost my mother, too.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie! That's not what I'm say --",
        "Bonnie: You know what, mom? There's nothing else left to say, is there? I'm gonna go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Well?",
        "Dusty: Well, what?",
        "Jennifer: You're not getting any closer. Is it because of Rose?",
        "Dusty: She's not just a girl that I've been riding with, you know? Runs a little deeper than that.",
        "Jennifer: But you two aren't together anymore.",
        "Dusty: Let's forget about Rose. Let's talk about your technique. You come over here totally unannounced and throw yourself onto me. Do you think that's gonna work?",
        "Jennifer: You think I'm running some sort of game on you, don't you? That Paul and I are working at some angle.",
        "Dusty: Once burned, twice shy, you know?",
        "Jennifer: Well I can understand why you would think that. Paul and I have been extremely close. I've trusted him over anyone else in my entire life. But that's over now.",
        "Dusty: Well, lovers can split up, but sisters and brothers -- I think you're stuck with it.",
        "Jennifer: Believe me, I wish I could understand it myself, but I -- I don't.",
        "Dusty: Well what is it? Huh? Start from the top. Break it down from there.",
        "Jennifer: When I first came to Oakdale I thought Paul was dead. And then I found out that he was alive, and it was like -- it was like this godsend, this miracle. I'd been given a second chance with him. And I was going to make the most of it. Be the sister he needed. And I thought that he felt the same way.",
        "Dusty: He does. He'd go to war for you.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe at first. Maybe at first. I mean, he'd been hurt. He needed me. He was the reason I stayed here.",
        "Dusty: Well, what about your folks? Hmm?",
        "Jennifer: I love Hal. He's been wonderful to me, but he has a whole other family to worry about. And -- well, you know my mom. You know exactly how she is. It didn't take me long to realize that her best events are torture and control.",
        "Dusty: So you put everything into your brother.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. I took everything to him. My heart, my hurt, my secrets, my fears. He was the one person that I could trust. The only person that wouldn't hurt me. I thought -- I thought I could count on him.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Look at me. Did he do something to you?",
        "Jennifer: He ripped my heart out. But I look at you, and I can't see you ever hurting me like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: It's just that I need a little time to ease the news in to Rosanna. Just a couple of days, tops.",
        "Molly: You're afraid of your wife.",
        "Craig: Yeah. I love her. More than you know.",
        "Molly: Said the canary of the cat. Love doesn't breed fear, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, you're exactly wrong. We're all afraid of losing what matters. When your heart beats to somebody else's pulse you understand how fragile love is. That at any moment, it could be gone.",
        "Molly: Okay. You got me. That part I understand. But do you really think that if Rosanna finds out about our little deal that she's gonna -- I mean, it's gonna cost you your marriage?",
        "Craig: At this moment? Yes I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I really wish I wasn't the person telling you this.",
        "Rosanna: I'm his wife. Don't I deserve to know?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you do. Craig is asking Molly to replace the money that you're withdrawing from Java Underground.",
        "Rosanna: Molly. Molly.",
        "Carly: Did you hear what I said?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Oh, yeah, I heard. Yes. Well, I expected him to ask Sierra. Molly -- that's interesting. That's an interesting little twist. Predictable.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry,.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that my husband doesn't understand why I need him so much right now.",
        "Carly: And that's why you're adamant that he pull out of Java Underground?",
        "Rosanna: Well, that and the fact that the whole thing is doomed to failure. I mean, do you really think that Dusty Donovan, bookmaker and part time gigolo, is a suitable partner?",
        "Carly: No. No I don't. But this is Craig's mistake to make, isn't it? I mean, if you want to pull your money out, then that's perfectly understandable, but to nix the partnership completely --",
        "Rosanna: He used the club in order to get out of being a parent. With me.",
        "Carly: So it's punishment, then. For screwing up the adoption.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe. Every time he goes to that club, I'm going to resent him. I just don't understand why he thinks this stupid little nightclub is more important than our marriage.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't think he thinks that a business venture is stupid at all. Ambition is a very big part of who that man is. You know that. And you're drawing an awfully deep line in the sand. You know that? So what, you want things to end with him?",
        "Rosanna: No. I just can't take the lying anymore.",
        "Carly: What are you gonna do?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I suppose at this point it's pretty simple, really. By tonight, everything will be resolved, one way or the other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You okay?",
        "Alison: I'm just worried about my mom.",
        "Chris: Well, she seemed like she was doing a lot better tonight.",
        "Alison: Well, she just put on a brave face so you and I would have a good time. I should call her.",
        "Chris: Again? Alison, look, you can't just keep checking up on her every five seconds. All right? You're just gonna make her feel worse. And make her feel like she can't cope, or something. You got to let her deal with some of this on her own.",
        "Alison: You're right. You're right. How'd you get so smart? Thank you.",
        "Chris: All I can think about is making love to you again.",
        "Alison: Where can we go?",
        "Chris: You still have the key to Katie's?",
        "Alison: No. Henry had me drop it off.",
        "Chris: A motel?",
        "Alison: Too creepy.",
        "Chris: I know, I know. I just want everything to be perfect for you, Alison.",
        "Alison: I guess we're stuck.",
        "Chris: Maybe we're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You keep mum about the deal; I'll keep mum about the investor. Can you do that?",
        "Molly: I won't lie about it. But I just won't publicize it either. For now.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Molly: Oh, wait. No so fast, buster. Keys.",
        "Craig: Oh, to Java.",
        "Molly: Yeah, I am a partner, after all. Though I'm keeping this on the quiet. Well. I have opinions, and I'm not planning on keeping them to myself.",
        "Craig: When have you ever?",
        "Molly: Plenty. Oh, and I plan on keeping you and Dusty on a very short leash, so curb your enthusiasm for breaking the law. Capisce?",
        "Craig: Eh, here's the key.",
        "Molly: Thank you. One more question. Quickly.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Molly: I know that I promised to keep this a low profile until you work things out with Rosanna, but given that she's so chilly about the idea, Craig, do you really think that you can?",
        "Craig: That's the fun part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So that's the plan?",
        "Rosanna: That's the plan.",
        "Carly: You sure you want to do this?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I won't really be doing anything. It'll all be up to Craig. Either he'll do what he always does, or he won't either way, I'll know whether we have a future together.",
        "Carly: All right, well, take care. And if you need anything, whenever, at any time, you can call me. 'Cause I love you.",
        "Rosanna: Thanks. I love you, too.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry about this with Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, well, thank you for coming over here and telling me what you did. Thank you so much for being a loyal sister. It really means a lot to me. And give that beautiful little baby of yours a big squeeze. And Parker and Jack -- give them a big hug from me too, okay? [Phone ringing] hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: Where are you, Bub, I need to see you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm home. I'm in the garden.",
        "Craig: Excellent. I have news, and it can't wait.",
        "Rosanna: I'll bet it can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Ben: Jess.",
        "Jessica: Hey. I'm sorry I should have called you first.",
        "Ben: Hey, come on. Please. You know you don't need an appointment.",
        "Jessica: Well, I know you have an early day tomorrow, and we didn't plan on seeing each other tonight.",
        "Ben: Something happened, didn't it? What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: It's Bonnie. I told her she should move out. I can't believe I'm throwing my baby out of the house. But I didn't know what else to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Hi.",
        "Isaac: Hey, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: My mom must have called you.",
        "Isaac: No, I just came by because I wanted to talk to you. What's with the suitcases?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I'm gonna be staying with Lisa for a few days.",
        "Isaac: Are you and your mom on the outs?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. Can we talk tomorrow? I'm sorry, but right now I'm just -- I'm upset, and I'm exhausted and I really don't think I'm gonna be worth anything tonight. I wish I could just put the world on hold, you know? Just for a minute.",
        "Isaac: I'm afraid, that this can't hold. I need to talk to you right now.",
        "Bonnie: What's so important that it can't wait until tomorrow, honey?",
        "Isaac: Me. I'm important.",
        "Bonnie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just got so caught up in my own stuff. Listen, what is it? What do you want to say?",
        "Isaac: Good-bye. I came to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: A little late to be gardening.",
        "Rosanna: You had some news?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: About Java Underground, I assume. I hope Dusty wasn't too brutal about my withdrawing my investment in the business.",
        "Craig: Dusty was upset. But --",
        "Rosanna: Oh, wait, don't tell me -- he refused to accept defeat.",
        "Craig: While you had every right to take your money out of Java Underground because of what I did, but you can't expect Dusty not to look for money. That's what he did.",
        "Rosanna: That's what Dusty did?",
        "Craig: That's right.",
        "Rosanna: And what source of funding did Dusty find?",
        "Craig: Well, you know Dusty. So your guess is just as good as mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.",
        "Dusty: It's all right. It's okay. Talk to me.",
        "Jennifer: I found out something really, really horrible tonight.",
        "Dusty: What's that?",
        "Jennifer: It is so strange. When I first came to town, you and I, right off the bat, we were enemies.",
        "Dusty: Well, yeah. I mean, you were loyal to your brother.",
        "Jennifer: So, automatically, his opponent was mine. But, I mean, you -- you never had any reason to like me or trust me, and you didn't. But you never -- you never, ever once lied to me. Never once.",
        "Dusty: Paul lied to you?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. And about something really important. I couldn't believe he did that. Do you remember how honest he used to be? How good? And I know -- I know that deep down inside, he's still there. But I --",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Jennifer: I have this horrible fear that there's something in my blood. Something in my family's genetic code that keeps us from being honest. But I don't want to be like them. I don't want to lie and hurt people. I've been on the other side of those lies and I know how it feels. God, I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Actually, I'm the one that wanted to talk to you.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Chris: Yeah, see, uh, I was hoping that you'd be nice enough to let us go back to the cottage. Alone together. Say, tonight?",
        "Alison: For just a few hours.",
        "Henry: You want me to let you use my humble, innocent little cottage for sex? No. No, no, no, no, absolutely not. It's out of the question. In fact, I am shocked, shocked frankly that you think I would lower myself so that you and the jailbait over here --",
        "Chris: There's $100 in it for you.",
        "Henry: Of course, on the other hand, you know, I've always been a believer in true love. It's just what I live for. I'll give you three hours, not a minute more.",
        "Alison: Thank you, Henry, thank you.",
        "Henry: All right. Anything for a friend.",
        "Alison: You genius.",
        "Chris: Come on. I cannot wait another second to be alone with you.",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait. Can we just stop back at my house? I just want Alison -- no, just for a few minutes. I just want to make sure she's okay.",
        "[Susan opening a bottle of vodka and poring it. Raises glass to her lips.]",
        "Susan: No! What am I -- oh, God, what am I doing? [Pours drink into plant holder. Hides bottle in couch.] Alison will find it.",
        "[Puts pint bottle into her purse.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Naturally, I'm going to have to give Dusty a little time to get his ducks in order with this new investor.",
        "Rosanna: And you don't even know where this person is from?",
        "Craig: Chicago , maybe. I don't know, really. The important thing is I can't leave Dusty high and dry.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, you can't do that.",
        "Craig: He still needs me. He's only done a little investing over the past couple years.",
        "Rosanna: That's right. When he hasn't been racketeering.",
        "Craig: Yes. Still, it's gonna take a little while before I can pull out of this thing. You understand?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, uh-huh, yes. I understand very well.",
        "Craig: Huh? Did you say something?",
        "Rosanna: You know, you can be so generous, and so loving, and so kind. It's the best part of you, you know. The honest part. It's the part that I fell in love with when I had my surgery. But you have another part to you that is so manipulative and so selfish. The part that lies. And I told myself when I married you that I might be able to handle it, that I would be able to bring out the best in you more often than not. But I don't think I can. And it's just no good pretending anymore.",
        "Craig: You're losing me.",
        "Rosanna: No. You're losing me. And the sad part is that I still want you. I want you so much I can't stand it. But I also need the truth. I don't care how painful it is. I need the truth -- now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Isaac: I have thought about this for a very long time, for weeks.",
        "Bonnie: And you haven't talked to me?",
        "Isaac: When was there time to talk to you? Like when you were trying to get that illegal DNA information for Marshall 's paternity test? Or when you were trying to take Sarah out of his custody? When was it a time that we could talk about my life?",
        "Bonnie: Is that why you're leaving? Because I took in an interest in a wonderful but completely helpless teenager? Or is it because I said I wasn't sure I was ready to marry you?",
        "Isaac: When you said that you wouldn't marry me, it was tough, but I thought we'd get past it. I thought we'd be okay. I thought that you'd get this Sarah thing out of your system and everything would work out. But the fact is, we don't work. We don't work because something is wrong at the core of us. And sometimes, you just need to cut your losses.",
        "Bonnie: Is that what I am to you? A loss?",
        "Isaac: Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you love me deeply, and no matter what happens, it's us against the world. See, I can't blame you for feeling that way. But I've got to say what's going on here. I can't be the side guy while you chase down Marshall or Sarah. I've got to have a life of my own. I need that.",
        "Bonnie: Wow. Wow, you -- you really thought a lot about this. So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Isaac: My buddy, Sims, from Florida called me and he has a business opportunity. It involves several clubs and, you know, for the first time in a long time, I'm excited, I'm nervous. That anticipation going for the future, and I need that. The truth is, is that if I don't look out for myself, then who's going to do it?",
        "Bonnie: There's got to be something else I can say to you.",
        "Isaac: You can say \"good luck.\" You can say that you don't hate me for making the decision that we both knew had to have been made.",
        "Bonnie: I could never hate you. Isaac, you've loved me in spite of my brattiness and castles and royalty and -- to me, you -- you're the only knight in shining armor I've ever known.",
        "Isaac: And you will always be my duchess. You're an amazing woman. I wish you nothing but the best.",
        "Bonnie: Good luck.",
        "[Bonnie sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: But the thing is, Bonnie really believes she was doing what was best, you know? I just feel terrible.",
        "Ben: Why?",
        "Jessica: Because I couldn't support her with Sarah, at least not the way she wanted me to.",
        "Ben: Because you didn't think that what she was doing was right. When you told her so, what did she do? She told you were interfering.",
        "Jessica: And now there's this huge rift between us, and I don't know what to do.",
        "Ben: Oh, come on. Jess, Bonnie's a big girl now. Maybe it's time she learned to live her own life. Maybe now you can live yours.",
        "Jessica: I haven't been doing that, have I? Living my own life.",
        "Ben: Not for a very long time. No, no. Don't -- don't -- don't beat yourself up. You've been real busy between Bonnie and Sarah and work and --",
        "Jessica: And the rape.",
        "Ben: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: You can say it. You know, I've really been trying not to think about it. But when you get right down to it, that's all I ever really think about. And I can't live like that. No way. I have to move on. Is it okay if I spend the night?",
        "Ben: Sure. You know, I don't -- I don't expect -- you know, I can just -- just hold you.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ben: Just like we've done before.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but that's what I'm -- that's what I'm trying to say. I don't want you to just hold me. I want more. It's time.",
        "Jessica: You know how there's one moment you remember? Like, one moment that's, like, frozen in time? For me, it's that night.",
        "Ben: The night Travers raped you.",
        "Jessica: Everything changed.",
        "Ben: I know.",
        "Jessica: But it didn't just start the moment Marshall put his hands on me. You know, it started -- it started before then. It started the moment I sent you away. I wanted to be with you, but I was so concerned that Marshall couldn't handle the pain of burying his child that instead of being with you, I sent you home.",
        "Ben: Look, Jess, you couldn't possibly have known what Travers was going to do.",
        "Jessica: Of course not. I know that. I know -- I don't blame myself for what happened. Marshall has full responsibility for that. But ever since that night, I've continued to be afraid. Afraid of letting you get too close. Afraid of the scars Marshall left on my body and on my heart. Afraid that I would never feel safe. But I understand something now. I am safe. I'm safe with you. I always have been, I always will be.",
        "Ben: I always want to be here for you, and with you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Ben, I love you so much. I want to be with you in every way, now and forever.",

        "Alison: Yeah. I don't want to wake her up. She needs her sleep.",
        "Chris: Right. So, you write her a note. Let her know that you were thinking about her and you stopped by, and you'll be back later.",
        "Alison: That's a great idea. Great idea. Hold on. Just a second. Okay. Do you have a pen?",
