        "Lily: Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey.",
        "Lily: Thank God.",
        "Lucinda: What took you so long?",
        "Lily: I was in another country with two children who were wondering where their big brother was.",
        "Lucinda: Not my fault. Not my fault that Luke has developed a taste for vodka and then stowed away in your boyfriend's plane.",
        "Holden: Have you heard from Keith?",
        "Lucinda: Why -- darling, why would you ask me that, when he could -- he could call your wife? No, darling, I haven't heard a peep -- not a peep from him. Not since we spoke last night.",
        "Lily: I thought he was on his way back here to look for Luke.",
        "Holden: I'm going to go find Lieutenant Cesar and tell him that we're here.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, him I spoke to. He's had men out all night -- all night looking for them. So far they haven't been able to find either one.",
        "Lily: So you're telling me that Luke and Keith are -- they both vanished?",
        "Lucinda: I'm afraid so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hal, can I talk to you?",
        "Hal: I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Dusty: This can't wait.",
        "Hal: All right, just stick with what you wrote. Don't elaborate and you'll do fine. I'll see you inside. So what's so important you couldn't wait for me to call you back?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer.",
        "Hal: What about her?",
        "Dusty: I don't know how to tell you this, but she's got herself a drug habit.",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Dusty: Crystal meth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You'll do it? You'll work with Mom and me?",
        "Paul: I said I would talk about it. I'm willing --",
        "Jennifer: You -- you have no idea how much this means to me.",
        "Paul: No. No champagne. Not yet. Okay, we have a lot of details we need to work --",
        "Jennifer: Well, I have to go tell Mom.",
        "Paul: That we're talking. Just talking.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, she's gonna be fine with it. She'll go along with anything that you want, really, really. And now I've got to go. Emily, thank you so much for pushing him into this.",
        "Paul: Hey, I'm not in. And she didn't push -- why did you push me into this?",
        "Emily: Because at this point, the closer you stay to Jennifer, the better.",
        "Paul: It's not Jennifer I'm worried about. It's the thought of working with Barbara.",
        "Emily: Oh, we have bigger problems than Barbara. Gwen fell apart in court today. She may never get custody of the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So what happened in court?",
        "Gwen: I lost the baby, as if you care.",
        "Will: I do care. So the judge ruled?",
        "Gwen: He may as well have.",
        "Will: So it's not final.",
        "Gwen: Are you even listening? I told you the judge gave the baby to Carly so they could send me to a bunch of social workers. And we all know what they're gonna say. If I don't become a different person, I can't be a mom.",
        "Will: So what are you supposed to do now?",
        "Gwen: After what Carly pulled, there's nothing I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ellen! When you pick up the boys will you ask the coach what time the game starts tomorrow? Thanks.",
        "Iris: Hello.",
        "Carly: Put that down. What are you doing here, Iris? I told you at the courthouse you're not getting another cent out of me. The baby is mine. And this is over.",
        "Iris: So you're saying that the court decision is final?",
        "Carly: As far as you're concerned, yeah, it is.",
        "Iris: From what I've read, these things are never over. Not as long as there's a birth mother who's pining for her child.",
        "Carly: Well, in this case, the birth mother is why I have custody. The judge took one look at her and decided that the baby's better off with me.",
        "Iris: You don't think the judge would change his mind if he knew certain things?",
        "Carly: No. No, I don't.",
        "Iris: You're either lying or you're a fool. But, either way, you're gonna pay me what I'm worth. Because if you stiff me at this point, I'll make sure that that baby is out of this house by nightfall. And you know I can do it.",
        "Carly: Tell you the truth, Iris, I don't think you can change the judge's mind. You see, compared to the birth mother, I'm a dream come true.",
        "Iris: But if the judge knew what you did to my beautiful boy --",
        "Carly: What happened to my brother was a tragedy, for all of us. But I was just a kid, Iris. I was a minor. I never should've been left there in charge of a helpless, little infant. And I think the judge will take that into consideration. Let him send someone to my house. Let them interview my family. This family works, Iris, because Jack and I are good parents. Unlike the birth mother, who showed everybody how unfit she is when she misplaced her own baby. So you see, you're fresh out of luck.",
        "Iris: Hmm. You seem pretty sure of yourself, Carly. But, you know, I don't know. How are you gonna feel when you see your face all over the front page of every paper. \"Baby killer.\" Can't you just read those headlines? Now, I'm not saying that the judge is going to give the baby over to the birth mother, but, you know, who's to say he's not gonna place the baby somewhere else. Say, foster care. It's a risk.",
        "Carly: You're right. It is.",
        "Iris: I knew you'd see it my way.",
        "Carly: Hmm. It's a risk I'm willing to take to get you off my back. You, Iris, are a leech. And you are not getting another penny. Rosanna left that money for rory. It's his.",
        "Iris: And yours, you mean? I know that's how the papers will see it.",
        "Carly: Okay, fine. You go to the papers, I go to the cops. You'll be convicted of blackmail, Iris. I believe that's -- that's about ten years. So if ten years in the state pen sounds like fun to you, go ahead. There's the phone, make the call. Give us both a problem we don't want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So the test on the water bottle came back negative?",
        "Gwen: That's right, will. I'm a liar -- again.",
        "Will: I didn't say that.",
        "Gwen: But that's what you're thinking. That I lied about Casey, I lied about the paternity test, I lied about Carly setting me up, the water bottle --",
        "Will: Let's not go there, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: There's nowhere else to go. That's my life -- a big, fat lie.",
        "Will: Look, how you choose to deal with things is your choice. I'm just trying to be supportive.",
        "Gwen: What does that mean? It doesn't matter if I tell you the truth or not? You'll just sweep it under the rug?",
        "Will: You want me to smile and nod? Fine. All the tests are rigged. They hate you. They're lying. Whatever you say. But when you told me that you couldn't afford a lawyer,I offered to go to my mother. I wouldn't go to my mother if my life depended on it. But for you I was willing. And now? I come to see what? That you have $10,000 in cash?",
        "Gwen: Not anymore. I gave it to the lawyer.",
        "Will: Well, I'm sure whoever gave you the money will be happy to give you more.",
        "Gwen: Take that back.",
        "Will: Whatever you say.",
        "Gwen: Get out. Hey, be sure to apologize to your mom. You know, you wouldn't want to upset her. Couldn't survive that, huh?",
        "Will: Go to hell.",
        "Gwen: A little too close to the bone? Looks like I'm not the only one with problems.",
        "Will: My only problem right now is you.",
        "Gwen: Why is that, Will? Why am I such a big problem? Why do you even care? I'll tell you why. Because it's easy to focus on me. That way you don't have to fix your own screwed-up life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So the first 30 minutes Gwen is allowed to be alone with her own child, we're supposed to believe that she fell asleep and the baby disappeared? Only to be found a few minutes later by the friendly neighborhood snack vendor? It's crazy. It's too convenient.",
        "Paul: You think Carly set her up.",
        "Emily: Yeah. And so does Jack. I mean, he can't prove it, but I know he smells a rat.",
        "Paul: And what about her lawyer?",
        "Emily: Winthrop? He tried. I mean, he tried his best. But Gwen let everybody push her buttons, and the judge intervened, and she hung herself.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I should have known this was gonna happen.",
        "Emily: What? That Carly would sandbag her?",
        "Paul: No, no. That Gwen would fall apart. You know, she says that the water was spiked.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, the original water bottle is long gone. Carly made sure of that. So there's no way we can prove that she tried to set her up. Which means Gwen is never going to get that baby back. Which means your plan to ship her out of town away from you sister ain't happening.",
        "Paul: Okay. So from now on we focus on keeping Jennifer from discovering that Rory is her baby.",
        "Emily: Which is why I pushed you back into business with your mother.",
        "Paul: So I could keep an eye on my sister.",
        "Emily: I just hope it's enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mom? Are you here? Mom? Mom! Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up. Ah. Mom, Mom, it's me. Call me. Or better yet, come home, because I have incredible news. Oh.",
        "Jennifer: You tapped the phones. Didn't you, Dusty. Well, of course you did. Guess what? You can't tap my cell phone. Oh, Jasmine, please be home. Dusty? Did you bug the room?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Barbara: Jen. What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, did you get through to Cesar?",
        "Holden: Still no sightings of either Luke or Keith. Lucinda, last night, when you went back to the plane, what exactly did Keith do?",
        "Lucinda: He left me -- he left me, he gave me this, this. I'm sitting there, chasing the shadows and he came back here to try to see if Luke had come here.",
        "Lily: You just had to do it, you just had to come down here. Now, because of this, I may lose my son.",
        "Lucinda: You're not going to lose your son! The ambassador is a friend. I have a phone call in to him. He will get back to me and he'll be able --",
        "Lily: To what? To what? Find Luke? He's the ambassador! I'm sure he doesn't leave the embassy without an armed guard! You going to pay him to run down the dark alleyways, calling out your grandson's name?!",
        "Lucinda: If your boyfriend had just checked the back of the damn plane -- yes!",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. Blame Keith. From what I understand, you gave him no choice.",
        "Lucinda: Did he tell you why? Did he tell you why I was able to force him to bring me down here?",
        "Lily: No, mother, we didn't have time to chat about that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, that's just a pity, because it might have been enlightening.",
        "Lily: I'm not going to listen to you run down Keith while he is out there, risking his life to find my son.",
        "Lucinda: Maybe he just ran off.",
        "Lily: Why would he run off?",
        "Lucinda: 'Cause the jig's up. The secret's out.",
        "Holden: What secret?",
        "Lily: No, don't. Don't indulge her. I'm not interested in any secrets.",
        "Holden: No, I want to know. What are you holding over him?",
        "Lucinda: Well, if you want to know, your knight in shining armor is a smuggler.",
        "Lily: No. I don't -- I don't believe that. Keith would never have anything to do with drugs.",
        "Lucinda: Did I say drugs? I don't think I said drugs, no. He's smuggling human body parts on ice. He's flying them up north, where they can be sold to the highest bidder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I tried to talk to her, but she doesn't want to listen to me. Besides that, she walked out on Street Jeans.",
        "Hal: She quit her own company?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I haven't even told Sierra yet. I'm hoping we can turn things around, but I don't know.",
        "Hal: And there wouldn't be any other reason my daughter would rather not work with you? So you thought maybe an accusation of drug use might give you some leverage?",
        "Dusty: No. You might want to talk to Meg Snyder. She pulled out some drugs from Jen's purse. She came to me. I didn't want to believe it, either. Believe me. Until I met Jen's dealer.",
        "Hal: When was this?",
        "Dusty: Yesterday. While Jen was out at a cash machine somewhere, he's sticking in his pockets anything that would sell.",
        "[Hal remembering.]",
        "Hal: How much do you need?",
        "Jennifer: No, Dad. Don't. Don't. I'll figure something else out.",
        "Hal: Don't be ridiculous. Just tell me how much you need.",
        "Jennifer: $500.",
        "Hal: $500? What do you need that kind of cash for that can't wait? Why? Why would she take drugs?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: 'Cause she's hurt, she's -- her baby. She's not getting over it. Maybe I called her back to work too soon, I don't know.",
        "Hal: I've gotta get over there. All right, thanks for coming to me, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I care about her.",
        "Hal: I know you do. Which is why I'm going to ask you to let me handle this --?",
        "Dusty: No, no, I'll let you handle it. Believe me, she doesn't want to hear from me, anyway. If you don't mind, just let me know.",
        "Hal: As soon as I can. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Sorry, Mom. My cell phone just wasn't working.",
        "Barbara: So you threw it across the room?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mom! Paul has decided to come back to work with us.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, I just spoke with him. And I told him that Street Jeans just wasn't working, that you and I decided to go into work -- into business together and I said I needed him. And he said yes.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God, honey. Oh, that is so wonderful! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I have wished for this, I've prayed for this. We have to start making plans. We'll have dinner tonight. Okay, we'll have dinner.",
        "Jennifer: Fine.",
        "Barbara: And then tomorrow morning, we'll have a breakfast celebration and just the three of us -- no, we'll invite Will, the four of us. And in fact, I will even invite your father, too. I'm gonna call him right now.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe we should just have dinner with Paul, because Dad and Paul --",
        "Barbara: I know, I know. But you know what? When he finds out that we're all together again,I know that Hal will make the effort, he will. Because it's so important. Because I need my children. Because you and your brothers are everything to me.",
        "Jennifer: Mom --",
        "Barbara: The years that we had together at B.R.O. were the happiest years of my life. And I -- I have missed that. And I've been afraid to wish for it, but we're going to all be together again. We're going to be together, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Not all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Your sister is haunted by the memory of her child. I can't stop thinking about the christening when she heard rory cry. It just breaks my heart, Paul.",
        "Paul: Mine, too. I don't ever want her to feel pain like that again. That's exactly why I've been trying to get her boy out of town.",
        "Emily: Well, until we make that happen, we need to keep them as far apart as possible.",
        "Paul: You're right. You're always right.",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: There's only one solution. I need to leave town. Get Jennifer to come with me. I'll make it look like its business. Stay away a few months, whatever it takes.",
        "Emily: Yeah, um -- I don't mean to sound selfish right now --",
        "Paul: Come with me. Bring Daniel.",
        "Emily: You want us to come with you?",
        "Paul: We're together, Emily. Don't you know that by now?",
        "Emily: I guess I don't. At least when it comes to leaving the country.",
        "Paul: We'll make a whole new, fresh start. Leave Barbara here to hold down the fort.",
        "Emily: Now, that's the best idea you've had yet.",
        "Paul: You are the best idea that I've ever had. So let's think. Jennifer could say no to Europe, or she could say yes. It'll still take a few weeks.",
        "Emily: So how do we keep her away from Rory?",
        "Paul: You.",
        "Emily: Me?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I know I'm asking a lot. If you do this one little favor for me --",
        "Emily: What is the matter with you? Don't you know I'd do anything for you?",
        "Paul: It'd cost you a friendship. But if you play her right, Jennifer could be spared the sight of her child.",
        "Emily: You want me to talk to Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: You can kiss that baby bye-bye.",
        "Carly: I'll send you a cake in prison, Iris. Well, I think we're done here, don't you?",
        "Iris: Hmm. Picture perfect. Too bad they can't see the real Carly. You're a piece of work, you know that? I don't know how you live with yourself, knowing that there's a mother out there whose heart is breaking. I know how I felt, my child was dead. But if he were alive and in your hands?",
        "Carly: I'm a good mother, Iris. And if I can save that baby, that will be a good thing. And maybe, maybe somehow it'll help make up for what happened to your son.",
        "Iris: No! Nothing will help make up for that!",
        "Carly: I will try. You know, Rory's birth mother is even worse than you, in some ways. She's completely reckless. I can't leave that baby alone with her. He would never survive. Gwen doesn't even know which end of him to diaper --",
        "Iris: Who?",
        "Carly: Rory's birth mother. Gwen Norbeck.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: Something's wrong.",
        "Emily: Something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong.",
        "Hal: No one is going to keep me from seeing my daughter, least of all, you.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here?",
        "Nurse: I've brought your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What'd you do that for?",
        "Iris: I'll get it fixed.",
        "Carly: No, don't. Please, leave it! Just get out of here, all right?",
        "Iris: You think by taking this baby you're gonna make up for what you did? You couldn't be more wrong.",
        "Carly: I said get out of here, Iris.",
        "Iris: You're gonna pay for what you did to me. I promise you, you are not gonna keep that baby as long as there is breath in my body. [Baby crying] Is that him?",
        "Carly: I asked you to leave.",
        "Iris: And I asked you a question -- is that Gwen Norbeck's baby?",
        "Carly: Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I didn't come from money. I have a screwed up family, but I got out of there. I walked away. You? You're too scared. Hey, you know what? We all have problems. I turned my head the other way about you being a former psycho just the way you turned your head away about me being a liar. But you know what, Will? It's not working, you hanging around and being supportive. If I needed a dog, I'd buy one.",
        "Will: And we know where you'd get the money.",
        "Gwen: That's not who I am.",
        "Will: Then I guess we're both wrong.",
        "Gwen: Then prove it. Come on! Tell me you believe me or not! Show me something! You can't. You won't. You'd rather be that nice guy in the corner. Well, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of you looking at me, and feeling sorry for me, and helping me, and treating me like I've let you down. You let me down! You were supposed to be my friend! I thought that you --",
        "Will: That would be really crazy, though, wouldn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, I am so sorry. This is not the time to be talking about family reunions when all you can think of is who's missing.",
        "Jennifer: Don't, okay? I don't want to talk about it. Besides, let's just focus on the positive. And I was thinking, since all three of us are together, and we're all three Ryans, that we could incorporate as \"Ryan Designs,\" in case we wanted to diversify, you know, if we wanted to start some furnishing lines or linens.",
        "Barbara: Should you be taking them?",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Barbara: Aren't you supposed to take those after breakfast?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, and I just had breakfast with Paul.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: You're checking on me?",
        "Barbara: No, I'm not.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, you are, because of what Dusty said about the drugs.",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Jennifer: I won't be watched! I didn't want to take these things in the first place.",
        "Barbara: And you went to the doctor, and you listened to the doctor, and you're doing much better.",
        "Jennifer: I'm just trying to do what everybody wants me to do, which is to get on with my life -- and I am. I'm happy. I'm working, and I'm happy -- it's fine.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I know you're doing much better. And I'm proud of you, okay? Why don't you just relax for a little while and then you can call your brother. I'm gonna go downstairs and talk to the chef and arrange for dinner. You call Paul, tell him to be here at 7:00, all right?",
        "Jennifer: Fine.",
        "Barbara: It's all going to work out. It's all going to work out, I promise you, okay? Relax.",
        "Hal: Barbara?",
        "Barbara: I was just gonna call you.",
        "Hal: Is Jennifer inside?",
        "Barbara: Yes, she's resting.",
        "Hal: You left her alone?",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about, Hal? Yes, what's going on here?",
        "Hal: Open the door.",
        "Barbara: Not until you tell me what you want.",
        "Hal: I just spoke to Dusty.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I see, and you believed him? Let me tell you what's going on here. Dusty and Jennifer had a falling out. She's decided to leave Street Jeans and come back to work with me. And Dusty is angry, he is hurt, and so he's made up these vicious lies because she's left him in a lurch.",

        "Holden: Luke probably walked into something that he shouldn't have. And they grabbed him.",

        "Dr. Hendricks: Mrs. Walsh, any news? You look a little pale. Have you had lunch?",

        "Carly: Oh. What brought this on?",
        "Emily: I was thinking about you and me, and I hate feeling like we can't be friends anymore. And I realized you were right. I am still jealous of Rosanna. Which I realize is a really weird thing to say, given what's happened to her. But I know how much Paul loved her.

        "Carly: Oh, no. No, no, I had no idea. But I suppose since both of the babies were premature, maybe their cries sounded alike.",
        "Emily: Yeah, so you know what? It'd be a good idea to steer clear of her for awhile.",
        "Carly: Yeah. No, of course I will. And I'll let Jack know, too. 'Cause he likes to take the baby to the park with the boys. I'll tell him know to keep an eye out for her.",
