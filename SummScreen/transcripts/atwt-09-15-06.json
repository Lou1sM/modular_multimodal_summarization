        "Carly: What the hell is in this thing?",
        "Simon: Alcohol, alcohol --",
        "Carly: Oh I'm sorry.",
        "Simon: Don't waste it -- more alcohol.",
        "Carly: No, kidding.",
        "Simon: Few more of these and you won't remember a thing in the morning.",
        "Carly: Well, now Simon -- if I didn't know better, I'd say that you were trying to get me in the sack.",
        "Simon: You know what, let's go with that. You're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Wait --",
        "Maddie: I can't do this.",
        "Casey: Yes, you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What did you just say?",
        "Jade: I'm pregnant.",
        "Will: You're pregnant.",
        "Jade: Yeah. So I'm sorry if you wanted closure or whatever, but it's not that simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Hello Gwen , Barbara. Good to see you.",
        "Kim: Hi, Girls. How are you darling -- how's the leg?",
        "Gwen : It's much better. It's still a little bit sore but the swelling's gone down --",
        "Kim: Oh good, you're giving her antibiotics I suppose?",
        "Bob: Yes, Dear --",
        "Kim: Now you had a tetanus shot right away.",
        "Bob: Yes she did, Dear -- she keeps it up, I'll have to put her on staff.",
        "Kim: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just asking -- everything was so chaotic that night.",
        "Barbara: We're pretty lucky. The doctor told me she could have bled to death.",
        "Gwen : I've been lucky in a lot of ways. It makes you think. Coming that close to dying. You don't want to waste another minute.",
        "Barbara: Well should we go outside? I think that probably other people have gathered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: It's not about Dusty, it's about me -- and I'm just not going to go there again.",
        "Lucinda: Why ever not?",
        "Lucy: Because I don't want to okay?",
        "Lucinda: Dusty's a cute guy too, I don't know why you're afraid to pursue him --",
        "Lucy: I'm not afraid.",
        "Lucinda: Well then, call him up and ask him to the movies. And do something about your hair darling. You're a beauty, you have beautiful eyes -- and you just play everything down.",
        "Lucy: Grandmother -- Grandmother, okay, okay. Dusty and I were lovers. A long time ago. But let's face it. It didn't work.",
        "Lucinda: Well, Dear, it didn't work because you left town because you wanted to get yourself an education --",
        "Lucy: Yeah, because I was 18. Which brings me to problem number two, our age difference --",
        "Lucinda: Well, you're grown up now -- you're an MD. Anyway, a lot of women marry older men. I did -- I had to of course.",
        "Lucy: I am not ready to marry anyone -- especially Dusty.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, so what are you going to do? You just gonna date? Your gonna hop from club to club and have fun. You're a doctor. And he is an important young business man with a kid.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, which brings me to problem number three. Daddy.",
        "Lucinda: Daddy -- what does Daddy got to do with it?",
        "Lucy: He's Johnny's biological father. And I don't care if you think that I'm being a coward. I don't want to have that conversation. The \"Lucy, I love you but I have to think about my son\" conversation. I'm not going to do that to me, and I'm not going to do that to him.",
        "Lucinda: That's the strangest reasoning I've ever heard, Darling. Dusty has adopted Johnny -- legally. There's no court in the world that would return him to your father. The less said about him the better. I look at you -- why are you so stubborn?",
        "Lucy: Because you're not listening to me! I'm not going back to Dusty and that's final.",
        "Lucinda: Fine. Be sad -- be all alone.",
        "Lucy: I'm not sad! I'm just going to the movies --",
        "Lucinda: All by yourself?",
        "Lucy: Yes, by myself. I like going to the movies by myself -- I don't have to talk to anyone!",
        "[Lucinda laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Why don't you ladies go on in, and I'll join you in a minute.",
        "Barbara: I guess we're the first to arrive. So many children.",
        "Gwen: It really hits you when you see them all together.",
        "Kim: Bob knew every one of them. Their families. Pastor Anderson asked him to lead the service.",
        "Barbara: I don't envy him.",
        "Kim: No.",
        "Gwen: Dr. Bob, did you see Will outside?",
        "Bob: No, I didn't, Sweetheart.",
        "Gwen: Because he was supposed to meet me here.",
        "Barbara: They have some really good news. Honey?",
        "Gwen: Will and I, we've gotten back together.",
        "Kim: That's wonderful -- I'm so glad.",
        "Bob: Well at least something good came out of this mess.",
        "Barbara: You two organized this, you think maybe Will's in back with the minister.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I didn't exactly expect congratulations, but you could say something.",
        "Will: I'm just a little --",
        "Jade: Me, too.",
        "Will: I've got some questions --",
        "Jade: You and me both. This wasn't exactly on my agenda.",
        "Will: So when'd you find out?",
        "Jade: Yesterday. I was late. But I thought it was from all of the stress that had happened at Raven Lake. But then I took a serious look at the calendar. And it's been a couple weeks. So I went to the drug store, and I got a test -- and it was positive.",
        "Will: You're sure.",
        "Jade: Of course, I'm sure.",
        "Jade: It was positive. I'm pregnant. What you don't believe me?",
        "Will: No, it's not that I don't believe you, but I wore a condom.",
        "Jade: Condoms break --",
        "Will: Yeah, I'd have known --",
        "Jade: They fail, okay? No method's 100% sure. I'm sorry. I'm not happy about this, either. And I know the timing stinks. That's why I didn't want to wait to tell you. What? Why do you keep looking at me like you think I'm lying to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Come on, I'll walk you in.",
        "Maddie: I can't. Everybody's looking at me. They don't want me here.",
        "Casey: Hey. Who cares what they think?",
        "Maddie: I do. And I know you say that I shouldn't, but I can't help it. My sister did this -- my sister.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but they're not gonna hold it against you, all right? These people, they've got a lot more information than they had a few weeks ago. They know that you were attacked and almost killed by someone you love. Come on, cut yourself some slack.",
        "Maddie: I just want to disappear.",
        "Casey: And then what? You're gonna hide in your room for how long? A week, a month? It's not gonna go away. Now, I know that you feel like you're under a microscope right now, but I'm here. I'll walk you in, we'll sit together, and I'll take you home, okay? We'll find a couple seats in the back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Dallas: Well, um, the parking lot's almost full. So the church is probably packed. We should probably head in if we want seats.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You need to take another man. [Carly laughs] Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: You know, Simon, I hate to break it to you, Romeo, but Jack is definitely not the only man that I've ever been with.",
        "Simon: Whatever. That was then, this is now. You are freshly divorced. It's you. You need to -- you need to wake up that gorgeous body of yours and say, \"I'm free!\"",
        "Carly: You don't think a good bungee jump would do it?",
        "Simon: Oh, bungee jump, no. A new man. You need to experience new terrain, new -- sensations.",
        "Carly: In other words, I need you.",
        "Simon: Know what? No, I need you. I just lost half my financing. I need to know there's still hope.",
        "Carly: I think maybe you've had enough.",
        "Simon: No, no. Come on, I just got started.",
        "Carly: How can you drink it? It's like lighter fuel.",
        "Simon: Well, after the first four or five, you don't even notice.",
        "Carly: You've had four or five of these?",
        "Simon: I got a head start.",
        "Carly: And you're still standing?",
        "Simon: Well, I'm sitting right now at the moment. But you know what? That can all change.",
        "Carly: Oh, what is it now?",
        "Simon: Oh, you know what? This music is brutal. Tell you what, you got to finish that drink. You need to catch up. You go and knock that one back, I'm gonna go speak to someone, get this soundtrack changed.",
        "Carly: Hey, can you dump that out, please?",
        "Manager: Oh, your friend had me make this especially for you.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, I'm sure he did. But I -- I'd prefer a nice rum and cola, okay? And easy on the rum, please.",
        "Innocencia: They're beautiful, no?",
        "Carly: Yes, yes. I'm sorry, are they yours?",
        "Innocencia: No, I'm glad you picked them up. Now I know what it is you want.",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Innocencia: The card in your hand? Turn it over.",
        "Carly: What now?",
        "Innocencia: Relax. The cards can't tell me anything you don't want me to know.",
        "Carly: That's good.",
        "Innocencia: You're lucky. There's a dark, handsome man in your future.",
        "Carly: There was a dark, handsome man buying me drinks. Is that who you're talking about?",
        "Innocencia: Let's see.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Innocencia: This card, the five of cups. It means loss, and gain. The cups can be empty or full. You've been crying.",
        "Carly: You're right again.",
        "Innocencia: You've lost something very precious to you. But this card says that many good things remain and that the future will bring you much joy.",
        "Carly: So this dark, handsome man, is he a loss or a gain?",
        "Innocencia: Depends.",
        "Carly: On what?",
        "Innocencia: You. The cards just -- they tell you what is possible.",
        "Carly: So it's possible then that a dark, handsome man might --",
        "Innocencia: The choice is yours. Now you have to decide. Do you let the opportunity slip through your fingers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Oh! Oh, my God! I am so sorry! Here, you know, have mine.",
        "Dusty: That's okay, Princess. I like salt and butter on mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I didn't say you were lying.",
        "Jade: Do you think I wanted this to happen?",
        "Will: The chance that something went wrong with the condom is practically nonexistent!",
        "Jade: You can tell yourself that all night. I did. And I even took the test again this morning, and I still didn't believe it. So then I went to the clinic.",
        "Will: The hospital?!",
        "Jade: What, do you think I'm stupid? No, I went to the free clinic across town, because I didn't want to expose you in case, you know, it was nothing. I saw Dr. Conrad. You can -- you can talk to him. I have his number.",
        "Will: What did he say?",
        "Jade: That it was positive. He examined me, and I'm pregnant. Do you want to call him?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry.",
        "Will: No, it's -- it's not your fault. I didn't mean to act like I doubted you.",
        "Jade: I couldn't believe it myself.",
        "Will: It's just a lot to take in. So have you thought about what you're gonna do?",
        "Jade: I know that it would be a lot easier if I had an abortion. And I thought about it. I did. But the only reason why I'm here is because my mother didn't go that route. And I know that it was really hard for her back then, being unwed. People can be really cruel. And that's the reason why she gave me up. At least, that's what I tell myself.",
        "Will: So, maybe adoption?",
        "Jade: I don't know, Will. It was so awful for me growing up. And it's not my mother's fault that the nuns gave me to people who didn't love me. But it was so hard, not knowing who I was, being in a family where I felt trapped and unwanted and unloved. I could never do that to a child.",
        "Will: So what are you saying?",
        "Jade: I'm keeping the baby. I'm not trying to rope you into anything. You can do what you want. But I have to do this. Maybe it's why it happened, so that I could give this child what I never had. So I'm okay with it. I'm gonna have this baby, and I'm gonna love it and care for it. And you can do whatever you want. We'll be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: How you doing?",
        "Maddie: I'm okay.",
        "Casey: How are you doing? I didn't know if you'd be here with your leg.",
        "Gwen: It's fine. How are you?",
        "Casey: I'll live.",
        "Gwen: Did you guys see Will outside?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Minister: If you can take your seats, we're about to get started.",
        "Gwen: I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Gwen: I'm really glad you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: What happened? Something bad?",
        "Will: Yeah, something bad.",
        "Simon: Let's go upstairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Acoustic guitar music playing)",
        "Margo: No, Casey, no.",
        "Casey: Mom, but I've got to go after her.",
        "Margo: No. Come on, you just got out of the hospital.",
        "Casey: But she's upset.",
        "Margo: I'll go talk to her. I'll find her. You sit down.",
        "Casey: And you'll call me?",
        "Margo: Yes, I will, if I found anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Let me get you another popcorn.",
        "Dusty: No, come on. I'll let you get back to your date.",
        "Lucy: My date?",
        "Dusty: Well, whoever you're with.",
        "Lucy: I came by myself. I've been wanting to see this movie for days. I left work as soon as my shift was over.",
        "Dusty: I know what you mean. I love her. I never miss \"Astro Girl.\" You know that.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's right. You were always a fan.",
        "Dusty: She's smart and she's beautiful. What's not to like? Isn't she great?",
        "Man: Shh!",
        "Lucy: You want to join me?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Yeah, why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, when are you due?",
        "Jade: In the spring. Which gives me plenty of time to find a place to live and get a job. I need benefits. And Crash is great, but I'm gonna need medical.",
        "Will: Jade, you're pregnant. No one's gonna hire you, let alone give you benefits.",
        "Jade: I'm gonna figure it out.",
        "Will: What? What are you gonna figure out?! You're pregnant!",
        "Jade: The ceremony is starting.",
        "Will: Yeah, the service.",
        "Jade: Yeah. You should, um, take a minute. I'm gonna go grab a seat.",
        "Will: Yeah, okay.",
        "Jade: Look, you know, it was my decision to keep the baby. So whatever you want to do, it's okay. If you want to be involved, that would be great. But if you don't, I can go it alone, okay? I'm used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: In times like these, there's comfort in fellowship. Dr. Hughes has agreed to lead our service today. Bob?",
        "Tom: Hey, no.",
        "Casey: My mom said she'd call.",
        "Tom: Then she'll leave you a message.",
        "Casey: What if Maddie needs me now?",
        "Tom: Give them both some time. You're in church. Turn it off.",
        "Bob: One of the joys of being a doctor in a small town is that you know all your patients, and you've seen them grow up. I have held each of these children in my arms when they were babies, and I did watch them grow up. Zach got his letter in lacrosse, track and field. Alex, swimming. Geneva, she ran the toy drive at the hospital at Christmas. And Ann, sweet Ann, she wrote a poem that was published in the paper that I read. I guess it was last March. And Ian -- Ian, the captain of the debating team. He would argue with anybody, given half a chance, including me. And he usually won. I know their mothers, I know their fathers, I know their brothers and their sisters. Good families.",
        "Bob: This is a terrible loss for them, and a personal loss for me. If I've learned anything as a doctor, I've learned that life is a mystery, that death can seem to defeat us, make us grief-stricken. Yet somehow -- and I'm no theologian. I can't explain this, but I've felt it, that the spirit lives on in each and every one of us. That the energy force, the life force that we felt from these young people lives in us. And it also lives in every baby that's born. It's undeniable. It's indestructible. A life force that continues to renew itself every time and a man create a child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Let's go upstairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: When I used to come home from school and see Eve's purse on the table, I knew I could relax, because everything was okay, and she was home. She'd put Mom to bed, make dinner, help me with my homework. She never used to hate me. But she hates me so much right now. I'm fine. I just -- I need to accept it, that she's not herself. She's not herself.",
        "Margo: Honey, she's mentally ill.",
        "Maddie: I know. I looked it up. They called it a psychotic break. She may never recover. And it's --",
        "Margo: It's your fault?",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Margo: Yes, and now you're going to tell me that if it weren't for you, Eve's marriage would've worked, that Louis never would've even looked at another woman? He never would've raped you? So if all that is true, Baby, then Eve would still be happily married, and she never would've picked up that knife. And all those kids, they'd all still be alive, and no one would have been hurt if it weren't for you.",
        "Maddie: How did you know?",
        "Margo: How you're feeling? Because Maddie, I've felt the same way so many times. Every time a friend on the force is hurt or killed, or someone that I'm desperately trying to protect is attacked. After I was raped.",
        "Maddie: I remember you telling me --",
        "Margo: And after I was raped, I felt that it was all my fault, that I could've done, I don't know, whatever to protect myself. I could've fought harder than I did.",
        "Maddie: Stopped him.",
        "Margo: Yes, but the truth is, the man who raped me broke the law. He committed a violent crime. It was his choice. It was his fault. It was Louis' choice, Louis' fault.",
        "Maddie: And what about Eve?",
        "Margo: Oh, Eve. Eve, I'm sure that in the end, the doctors are gonna find that she didn't even know what was right or wrong. She's one of Louis' victims as well, isn't she?",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Margo: And Maddie, that's not the point here. The point is, you're gonna recover. You're gonna move on with your life, because you've got so much to look forward to. You've got college and a career and marriage --",
        "Maddie: Nobody's gonna want me.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, that's not true.",
        "Maddie: That's how I feel. And I don't know how to change it.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, Baby. I'm sorry. Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Will: Nothing. You should -- you should really go back in.",
        "Gwen: I'm not going anywhere until you talk to me. It's not easy sitting through this. Maddie took off right when she saw the pictures, and I think Margo's with her.",
        "Will: No, it's not about the service.",
        "Gwen: What is it? Where were you before it started? I thought you were gonna meet me.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: No, it's okay. It's fine. It's just Margo said she saw your car and couldn't find you. Go for a walk?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Gwen: You okay? You want to go home?",
        "Will: No, that will not help.",

        "Carly: Simon --",
        "Simon: I don't know what we got to talk about. Let's just --",
        "Carly: No, um, it's just that I've been divorced for like --",
        "Simon: I know, about five minutes now. But you know what? You've been separated for months, and I really don't think you should be left alone.",
        "Carly: Wait, how do you -- how do you know?",
        "Simon: Oh, I know.",
        "Carly: But, you're drunk.",
        "Simon: That doesn't change the facts.",
        "Carly: It's just that we have a very good thing going, business-wise, you know? And I don't want to mess that up.",
        "Simon: Okay. Okay, we won't.",
        "Carly: Simon, stop!",

        "Dusty: Kind of like a doctor I know.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, right. Guess that popcorn wasn't so terrible.",
        "Dusty: You know what? Considering there was no salt and butter. What else you got?",
        "Lucy: Nothing.",
        "Dusty: Come on, don't forget who you're talking to. Where's the licorice. You never go to the movies without your red licorice. Mm.",
        "Lucy: You don't even like red licorice.",
        "Dusty: Let's see it. A-ha, just making sure. No, no.",
        "Lucy: Oh, oh, come on. Don't be a candy snob.",
        "Dusty: Nope.",
        "Lucy: Mm. All that red dye and processed sugar. All that self-restraint --",
        "Dusty: Would you like it back now?",
        "Lucy: Oh, it's all yours, big guy.",
        "[Explosion]",
        "Dusty: Ow! Ferocious.",
        "Lucy: Serves him right for wearing tights.",
        "Man: Shh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Reverend Anderson and I, deciding how we should do the format for this, both agreed that we should open it up to everyone, anyone who would like to say anything, or read something, or play some music, whatever. In any event, I encourage you to join us if you have something that you'd like to share with us. Casey?",
        "Casey: I'd like to say something. I know this is hard for everyone, that we all miss our friends, and that we all feel, or at least I feel really angry about how it happened. This is such a waste. But I also think it's important to lay the blame where it belongs. Eve Browning did this. She and her husband Louis were obviously very messed up, you know, to do what they did. But Louis is dead, and Eve's been arrested, so I don't think there's any point in us taking out our feelings on other people, on Maddie. She suffered more than anyone through this. Her sister and her brother-in-law, people that she lived with, people that she trusted, people that were supposed to be good to her, hurt her badly. And then they tried to blame her for the terrible things they'd done. So she needs our support. And anyone who doesn't want to do that, that thinks they're just gonna turn their backs on her, they're gonna have to answer to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Oh, please, stop apologizing. You know, I think the reason we take on all this guilt is it sort of in a strange way makes us feel that we weren't as helpless as we really were. The truth is, in that moment, we had no power.",
        "Maddie: In that moment, I know there was nothing that I could have done. But before and after --",
        "Margo: Honey, you did everything you could. And now you've got to move forward, because you can't change the past. You can only learn from it.",
        "Maddie: How long did it take you till you felt normal again?",
        "Margo: Normal? I still have my moments. But I guess when I feel bad about myself, I talk. I talk to Tom, I talk to someone else who understands. And then I move on. You just got to move on with your life.",
        "Maddie: I don't even know where to start.",
        "Margo: Why don't you start by coming home with me?",
        "Maddie: Oh, um, no thank you. Henry's coming back, and we're gonna order some room service. And we have to get rid of all of Eve and Louis' stuff.",
        "Margo: No, no, there's always time for that. Really there is, Honey. You need to be someplace where you feel safe and you feel comfortable, and you got family around you and a home. I want you to move back in with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So what happened?",
        "Will: Well, um, we got here early to set up, and --",
        "Gwen: You just started thinking about Jen? I mean, I can't imagine what it must be like to be back in this church for another service.",
        "Will: Yeah, yeah, I guess so. But then --",
        "Gwen: Will, come on. It hasn't been that long since she passed away, and all these kids. So look, if you feel like going home, I completely understand. Just know that once you get some rest, and things get back to normal, you'll feel better. And when you do, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Will: You say that now --",
        "Gwen: Look, I know that things have been messed up for a while, but you have to believe that that's over. We're together again, and I honestly feel more married to you now than I did before. And there's nothing that you could do that would change the way I feel about you.",
        "Will: If you only knew how much I want to believe that right now --",
        "Gwen: What is it? I mean, there's nothing that you can't tell me.",
        "Will: You know how much I love you.",
        "Gwen: I know. I love you, too.",
        "Will: All I've ever wanted is for us to be together and do all the things that we've talked about.",
        "Gwen: We are. We're doing them. We're gonna move back into our house, and we're gonna register for school, and we're gonna adopt some kids. I'm not talking about right now. I'm saying in a few years, once we graduate, we're gonna have the family that we've always wanted. Come on, so what is it? What's got you so upset?",

        "Next week on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Will: Jade's pregnant.",
        "Dusty: So come home with me.",
        "Paul: I will die before I let you keep me from my child.",
        "Emily: Well, then die then! And this time, stay dead.",
        "Carly: Right about here."
