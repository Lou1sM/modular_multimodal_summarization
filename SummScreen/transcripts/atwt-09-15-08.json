        "When Allison opens her door, Morty runs in with Chris right behind him. Dani goes looking for Chris and learns he took a sick day. Chris tells Allison he and Morty miss her and wonders if she is happy being married. Allison wants him to leave, but Aaron comes out of the shower and demands to know why Chris is in their room. Janet comes to talk with Carly about Jack. Carly tells Janet that she surmises that Jack is taking full responsibility of what happened. Jack quits the force because he took evidence and it got destroyed. Margo isn't so quick to let this happen though. Carly and Janet talk about Jack's high morals and Carly tells Janet that Jack may never forgive her because she speaks from experience. Lily and Holden search for a missing Ethan. Margo thinks there is a way out of this for Jack, but he won't let her get involved. He doesn't want her compromising herself and ultimately he knows she, he and Hal would do the right thing. Margo begrudgingly accepts his resignation. Jack praises Margo and thanks her for being such a great friend and boss. Aaron kicks Chris out of his room and goes to call the Front Desk about Chris having a dog in his room, but Allison is quick to defend Chris. Jack tells Carly and Janet that he quit the force. Janet wants him to fight, but Carly understands and explains that Jack has to do this. Holden and Lily can't find Ethan and end up blaming each other for a minute because Holden was with Carly and she was with Mike, but then they come to their senses and agree to work together. Allison talks Aaron out of calling on Chris and entices him out of his jealousy by leading him into bed. Dani comes to take care of Chris. Morty doesn't seem to bond with Dani like he did with Allison. Janet tries to get Jack to go home and talk with her and while he appreciates why she asked him to do the thing he did and he ultimately takes responsibility, he can't go with her. Jack and Carly are hanging out when Holden calls about Ethan going missing. Jack and Carly show up to help, as Lily is momentarily thrown by her, but Carly promises she just wants to help. Holden and Lily call the police, as Jack is forced to admit he quit the force. Aaron talks about his desire to start trying to have a baby, as Allison looks overwhelmed. Chris and Dani end up kissing, but Dani pulls back telling him that he needs to get over Allison first. Chris assures her that he is fine, but then realizes he isn't and stops himself before he takes things further. They agree to remain friends with benefits for the time being. Allison tells Aaron that she is not ready citing her school and career, but Aaron is sure of himself and tries to persuade her, but Allison looks very unsure. Margo shows up and they all talk about the circumstances around Ethan's disappearance. Holden gets a lead Ethan was in the woods; Margo gets a lead and Carly and Jack head out to look themselves. Allison finally relents and agrees to talk babies at a later date sooner rather then later, Aaron hopes. Aaron surprises Allison with impromptu honeymoon reservations; he already ok'd it through Bob. Again, Allison looks unsure, but she covers well and tells Aaron she is going to pack. Lily and Holden find Ethan's blanket and hope he is asleep underneath it, but he is not there. Holden comforts Lily. Allison spies Dani and Chris kissing. Lily is so scared that Ethan is hurt or worse, as Holden wants her to be strong for when they find him. Lily wants her and Holden to make a promise to never forget what is important after they get through this, as Holden readily agrees. Carly and Jack come across the gaping hole on the farm and worry. Carly and Jack think their and Lily and Holden's worst fears are realized when they find Ethan's shoe by the open hole."

        "Alison: Why do movies like that always get to me?",
        "Aaron: Chick flicks make girls cry. I think that's the whole point.",
        "Alison: Spending a whole day in bed with no car chases or explosions. That can't be fun for you.",
        "Aaron: What are you talking about? I mean, I'm here with you in bed. What else do I need?",
        "Alison: A honeymoon, maybe? A real honeymoon?",
        "Aaron: Well, hey, don't worry. We're gonna have a honeymoon pretty soon. Anywhere you want. You just have to be patient.",
        "Alison: You're the one who's being patient. What's a wedding night without the main event?",
        "Aaron: Oh, every day with you is a honeymoon. I'll go take a shower. Don't you go anywhere.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll clean this place up. Morty! What are you doing here?",
        "Chris: I guess he misses you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Excuse me. Hi. Uh, I need a favor. Could you page Dr. Chris Hughes for me? It's not for work. I'm a friend.",
        "Nurse: Sorry, Dr. Hughes isn't here. He called in sick today.",
        "Dani: Ah, Man. Under the weather and all alone in his hotel room. He must need some cheering up.",
        "Nurse: From a friend?",
        "Dani: I'm on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Poor guy's kind of kiss-deprived.",
        "Alison: I've missed him, too.",
        "Chris: I usually don't let him roam the halls, but when I tried to get his leash on, he got away. Two seconds later, beeline for Mommy.",
        "Alison: Please don't call me that.",
        "Chris: He was given to both of us, Alison.",
        "Alison: I know, but it doesn't feel right anymore.",
        "Chris: Why not? I know you still love him.",
        "Alison: Yeah. He is a cute little guy.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but his eyes get all sad when you're not around. Yours look a little sad, too.",
        "Alison: I'm fine.",
        "Chris: Are you sure? Are you really sure this marriage is what's gonna make you happy, Ali?",
        "Alison: Chris, stop it.",
        "Chris: I can't help it. You and I, we could have had something good together.",
        "Alison: It's too late, okay? We can't do this! Just go!",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Aaron: What the hell are you doing here?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Janet.",
        "Janet: I know I'm the last person you want to talk to right now, but I have to know -- have you heard from Jack?",
        "Carly: No, I haven't. Come in. Didn't you say that you and Jack would have no trouble getting past this?",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, I guess I spoke too soon.",
        "Carly: You think?",
        "Janet: Look, I know Jack has every right to be mad at me.",
        "Carly: You burned evidence that the police had against Brad. I'd say that's a pretty good --",
        "Janet: Actually, Brad was the one that lit the match. But you know what, that doesn't matter. The evidence is gone, and there is no way we can get it back.",
        "Carly: And that's why Jack is in a tough situation.",
        "Janet: I know. Do you have any idea where he could be, what he's doing right now?",
        "Carly: Well, if I had to guess, I would say he is at the police station right now, admitting to destroying evidence.",
        "Janet: But he didn't destroy it!",
        "Carly: Jack takes responsibility for everything. I told you that, Janet, you just didn't listen.",
        "Janet: Oh, God. I can't let this happen. I can't let his career get trashed because of me.",
        "Carly: Well, I'd say that that's a real possibility.",
        "Janet: Do you think it could go that far?",
        "Carly: I hope not. The up side is that Jack and Margo go back a long time. She could cut him some slack.",
        "Janet: And the down side?",
        "Carly: The down side -- let's not think about the down side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, Jack. I've given you some time to think this over. So we're sure that taking the evidence was a deliberate act.",
        "Jack: I knew what I was doing, yes.",
        "Margo: Well, tell me.",
        "Jack: It's not important.",
        "Margo: Yes, it's important to me.",
        "Jack: You are not gonna get me to point the finger at anybody, Margo. The Leo Morrissey case has been compromised because I did away with crucial evidence. That's all that matters.",
        "Margo: You realize how serious this is?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I broke the law.",
        "Margo: Yeah. And I can't really look the other way.",
        "Jack: No, I know that. So I'm gonna save you the trouble of suspending me. I quit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You know, I wouldn't blame Jack if he never speaks to me again. Do you think he will?",
        "Carly: Do you want me to be kind, or do you want me to be honest?",
        "Janet: I think I got my answer.",
        "Carly: I don't have a crystal ball. All I have is what I've learned from my own experience.",
        "Janet: And?",
        "Carly: I think it is quite possible that Jack will never get past this.",
        "Janet: That's what I was afraid of.",
        "Carly: It's like I told you, Janet. He has higher standards than the rest of us.",
        "Janet: I know. The guy's whole world is black or white. There are no shades of gray. No rose-colored glasses. Me, I got about a million different pairs of those things.",
        "Carly: Do you really want my advice?",
        "Janet: I'll take my chances.",
        "Carly: Jack, he's a by-the-book guy. Try to change that, try to change him -- and you will lose him for good. Just like I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, Jack! Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.",
        "Jack: Listen, I know the position this puts you in. So I think it's best if we just make a clean break.",
        "Margo: Well, that's not gonna change what happened, is it?",
        "Jack: No. No, it won't.",
        "Margo: It's not real hard to see through this. This is about your brother. Somehow, your brother is responsible for Leo Morrissey's \"Unfortunate accident.\" And you're trying to protect Brad from prosecution. Am I right?",
        "Jack: If I'm not a detective anymore, then I cannot be a part of any official investigation.",
        "Margo: Now, wait a minute. I haven't accepted your resignation. So you stay here. You go through this with me, all right? Let's just consider the fact that Leo Morrissey confessed to drugging Brad's underage daughter and trying to rape her. Now, those -- those are extenuating circumstances. I think we got a plea bargain here. I think that Morrissey could easily concede that what Brad did to him was excusable, even justified. Charges may not ever be filed.",
        "Jack: For Brad, maybe. But now you know that one of your officers tampered with evidence, and that's not gonna be plea-bargained away. Margo, I don't want to see any of this fallout landing on you. So why don't we stop wasting department time and money. I'll sign a statement. Prosecute me if that's what you need to do. But as of right now, I am off this investigation and I am off the force.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Okay, Guys, this is very important. You need to tell me exactly where Ethan was the last time you saw him.",
        "Faith: He was right here. He was playing with his ball and he was wearing his blanket like a cape when he would play superman.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, then he just walked out on the patio.",
        "Lily: How long ago was that?",
        "Faith: Not long. Maybe 15 minutes?",
        "Holden: Okay, he couldn't have gone far.",
        "Lily: You know what, this morning when I was getting him dressed, he was so excited about that new calf at the farm. Maybe he went over there to see it.",
        "Faith: You think that he walked all the way to the farm?",
        "Holden: Well, it's possible. He's walked those fields with me a million times. I'll go check.",
        "Lily: Faith, I want you to stay here with your sister, okay, in case he comes back. You call me on my cell phone immediately.",
        "Holden: Honey, don't worry. We're gonna find your brother. He's gonna be fine, okay? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ethan!",
        "Holden: Is anybody home?!",
        "Lily: Ethan!",
        "Holden: Mama, are you up there?",
        "Lily: Her truck wasn't outside.",
        "Holden: All right. I'm gonna go back out to the stables and check the barnyard.",
        "Lily: I'm gonna go look upstairs. Maybe he fell asleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: No, no, no. You're not going anywhere yet.",
        "Jack: Am I under arrest?",
        "Margo: No, I'm just trying to talk some sense into you, Jack. Listen. Look what you're trying to do here. You're trying to throw away everything you've worked so hard for -- your pension, the medical coverage for your children. You've worked a lifetime for this, sacrificed everything. And you're gonna throw it away? No, I don't think so. I don't think so -- not when you are my best detective.",
        "Jack: Then why can't you be good enough to know that I don't have any choice here, Margo?",
        "Margo: Okay, you messed up. Okay, you messed up bad. But that doesn't have to be a deal breaker.",
        "Jack: I am not gonna let you cover for me.",
        "Margo: We do it all the time for friends and family. Look what I've done for Casey, for Adam, for Tom.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you still -- you did the right thing. When it came down to it, you arrested Casey. He was sent to Statesville. Why should I get better treatment than your own son did? I love you for caring. But if you were in my position, you'd do the same exact thing, and so would Hal. Am I right?",
        "Margo: You sure, Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm sure. Thank you. Thank you for everything. You've been a great boss, and a true friend. And I mean it. There are no hard feelings. So if you need to prosecute, I completely understand. You know where to find me. It has been an honor serving with you, Lieutenant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You know, the sign says \"Do not disturb.\" How'd you get through medical school without knowing how to --",
        "Chris: I didn't come here on purpose, Aaron. The dog got away, ran in your room.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah, right. Did he knock or did he have a room key?",
        "Alison: I opened the door to put the tray outside, and the puppy ran in.",
        "Aaron: Do you not remember that I work here? You can't have a pet in your room.",
        "Chris: All right. He's just staying with me until I can find him a real home. Do me a favor, keep your mouth shut. I won't bother you anymore.",
        "Aaron: Get out.",
        "Alison: Aaron, what are you doing?",
        "Aaron: Calling the front desk.",
        "Alison: About what?",
        "Aaron: The dog. What else? If they kick Chris Hughes out, I'm not gonna shed a tear.",
        "Alison: No. I can't let you do that to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I never should have put Jack in that position. I was so wrong.",
        "Carly: The whole reason I'm not with Jack anymore is that very same problem. We had the same battle over and over again. And finally, I realized that I am not the kind of woman he needs.",
        "Janet: What makes me think that I am? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Carly: It's a question you have to answer for yourself.",
        "Janet: Thanks. For the iced tea and sympathy. Jack!",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Where have you been? What happened? I was worried about you! Wh -- wh -- wh --",
        "Jack: Well, you called it. You knew I couldn't live with myself if I kept covering up.",
        "Janet: What did you do, Jack?",
        "Jack: I resigned from the force.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack.",
        "Janet: No! No, come on!",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: You can't do that! There has to be another way. Can't you explain? Can't you make a deal?",
        "Carly: No, he can't. It's what I've been trying to tell you, Janet. Jack tried to do what everybody else wanted, and now he's the one who ends up paying the price.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No, no sign of him upstairs.",
        "Holden: He's not in the stables or the barn or any of the buildings out back.",
        "Lily: Did you check the hay lofts?",
        "Holden: Yes, but there's no way he would go up that high.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but he's getting bigger, and he's so fearless.",
        "Holden: Which is why I told him that he can't wander off on his own?",
        "Lily: You think I haven't told him the same thing?",
        "Holden: You know, Lily, I really don't know what you're thinking. And I don't know how you could leave the kids alone like that.",
        "Lily: I left you a message! I thought they were with you!",
        "Holden: Well, you never bothered to check to see if I got the message. You were too busy hitting the sheets with Mike to worry about who was taking care of your kids!",
        "Lily: Oh, come on! The reason you forgot your phone was because you were too busy, distracted with Carly!",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: Don't lie to me! I was here! I saw the two of you all lovey-dovey and laughing, and I left!",
        "Holden: Carly was here looking for Jack. I was with her all of two minutes! So don't try to turn this thing around on me! You went out, you were having your fun with Mike!",
        "Lily: Stop it, stop, okay?! I feel bad enough! I never should have left him! I never should have assumed -- oh, my God, if he gets hurt because of me -- I will never forgive myself!",
        "Holden: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's not your fault.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God, Holden. What if we can't find him? My baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's not like Chris",
        "Alison: It's not like Chris set out to crash our honeymoon. It was an accident. His dog got loose. Don't go ballistic, please.",
        "Aaron: You believe what you want, Alison, okay, but there's no way that I'm gonna believe that that was just a coincidence that he ended up here. He's still carrying a major torch for you. Okay, he's mad as hell that we got married and he's gonna do anything he can to break us apart.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but can you hear how paranoid that sounds?",
        "Aaron: It was bad enough before, but, like, you're my wife now. Okay, he has no business sniffing around here anymore. Him and that stupid little dog.",
        "Alison: Come on, you can't be jealous of a cute little puppy.",
        "Aaron: I'm your husband. I can be jealous of anything I want.",
        "Alison: Including pets?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, definitely. I heard you call him cute.",
        "Alison: Well, he's not half as cute as you. And I promise -- from this day forward, I won't ever look at any other man or dog out on the prowl.",
        "Aaron: Especially a dog like Chris Hughes.",
        "Alison: Chris who?",
        "Aaron: Exactly.",
        "Alison: You know, I think I have the perfect way to make you forget all about this.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Come back to bed and I'll show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Sorry, Morty. You can't drop in on Mommy like that anymore. It's not allowed. Yeah, I don't like Aaron much, either.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Chris: Wait. I think our luck might have changed. I think one of us is irresistible. Hey, Dani.",
        "Dani: Hi, Chris. Um, I heard you were sick, so I brought you the cure that is sure to put every doctor out of business, kosher chicken soup from Greenblatt's Deli.",
        "Chris: That was really nice of you, Dani, but I'm not really --",
        "Dani: Oh, look! I did not realize you had a puppy! Oh, my God, he's so adorable! Hi, sweet thing! I'm Dani!",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Dani: Was it something I said?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's still our honeymoon, right?",
        "Aaron: Yep.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. So let's enjoy it.",
        "Aaron: Mmm. Listen, I'm all for that, but you said you wanted to wait.",
        "Alison: So I changed my mind. You're my husband now.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Alison: You are the only man that I want.",
        "Aaron: Well, listen, though, just for the record, are you absolutely sure?",
        "Alison: See for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: And you haven't seen Ethan, say in the last half an hour?",
        "Holden: Did you hear barking this morning?",
        "Lily: No?",
        "Holden: Okay, fine, that would be great. If you could look around. Thank you.",
        "Lily: No, no, I'm sure we're gonna find him. Thank you.",
        "Holden: No one's seen him.",
        "Lily: Where could he have gone?",
        "Faith: Any sign of Ethan?",
        "Holden: No, not yet. I was hoping you were here to tell us that you found him.",
        "Faith: Not yet.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, you were supposed to stay with your sister.",
        "Faith: I asked Mrs. Cooper next door to stay with her. They're making calls.",
        "Holden: That's what we're doing, too.",
        "Faith: I can't believe we haven't found him yet.",
        "Holden: We will, we will, don't worry.",
        "Faith: This is all my fault. I'm his big sister -- I should have been paying more attention to him!",
        "Holden: Sweetie, it's all right. Don't worry, okay? We're gonna find him. He's gonna be all right.",
        "Lily: Yeah, listen to your daddy. We are gonna find him. We just have to figure out what our next step is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You shouldn't be punished for something I did, Jack.",
        "Jack: Don't blame yourself. Brad's the father of your child. You were trying to protect him.",
        "Janet: But I should have realized what kind of an impact this would have on you.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, he probably worked you. He said what he needed to say to get you to cover his tracks for you.",
        "Janet: But I shouldn't have listened to him. I should have realized that what we were doing was stupid, and selfish, and wrong.",
        "Jack: No, it was wrong of me to ask you to hide evidence from me. I don't know why I did that.",
        "Janet: I do. Because you trusted me. And I let you down.",
        "Jack: No. No, this is my problem. It's not yours. It was wrong for me to get you involved.",
        "Janet: Jack, this isn't just your problem. This is our problem. Now, let's go home and let's figure out how we're gonna work on this.",
        "Jack: I can't do that right now.",
        "Janet: I understand. Take all the time that you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I think it's time to call the police.",
        "Faith: Does that mean you think something bad has happened to Ethan?",
        "Holden: No, no, not at all. It just means that we need more people out there looking for him. I'll call Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: It's Holden. What would he want?",
        "Carly: Don't look at me.",
        "Jack: Well, I don't want anything to do with him.",
        "Carly: Hey, it could be important. Would you answer the phone? Jack.",
        "Jack: Well, you've been right about more than one thing today. What the hell? Yes, Holden.",
        "Holden: Jack, I need a favor. Ethan's missing.",
        "Jack: For how long?",
        "Holden: Uh, at least an hour. Can you help us out?",
        "Jack: Of course. Ethan's gone missing. They don't know where he is. So, where was he seen last?",
        "Holden: He was at the house with the girls, at Lily's house. We think that maybe he wandered off into the yard. We looked at the farm. We looked everywhere, but there's no sign of him at all.",
        "Jack: Okay, I will meet you back at Lily's, all right?",
        "Holden: All right. We'll meet you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Come on. We gotta go back to your house. Jack's gonna meet us there.",
        "Lily: Let's hope he can help us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm coming with you.",
        "Jack: Do you really think that's a good idea?",
        "Carly: Yes. Lily may not want to see me, but if one of our children was missing, I'd want as much help as possible.",
        "Jack: That's a good point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I put on a video for Nat. Faith, she's e-mailing all her friends. She's gonna tell them to keep an eye out for Ethan. Wh -- what is that?",
        "Lily: Of all the toys my mother's bought him over the years, he'd rather play with this dinky car than anything",
        "Holden: We're gonna find him.",
        "Lily: He's so little, Holden. What if he's lost? He must be so scared.",
        "Holden: You know what, Jack will put out an Amber Alert. They'll have cops on every street corner looking for him. Maybe I should call Aaron and let him know what's going on.",
        "Lily: No, no. Don't interrupt his honeymoon. Luke and my mother are away on business. I'm not gonna call them. I'm not gonna worry anybody until we know there's something to worry about. Please, God, don't let there be anything to worry about.",
        "Holden: Lily, he hasn't been gone that long. We're gonna find him. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Holden: That's Jack.",
        "Lily: He's gonna need pictures. What is she doing here?",
        "Carly: I want to help, Lily, any way I can.",
        "Jack: The more people searching for Ethan, the easier it's gonna be to find him.",
        "Holden: Okay, so where do we start?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I miss this.",
        "Alison: Me, too.",
        "Aaron: Why did we ever break up? I mean, I love you so much. I always have.",
        "Alison: I love you, too. And I really just want to make you happy.",
        "Aaron: Well, news flash, mission accomplished.",
        "Alison: So can I at least hope that you're not jealous anymore?",
        "Aaron: No, no. I know you don't care for Chris Hughes or his wacky little dog. But I have to say, that dog is crazy for you. He acted like you were his long- lost friend.",
        "Alison: That's easy to figure out. I like dogs, and all animals, and, you know, I think they can sense that stuff.",
        "Aaron: Maybe we should get you a puppy.",
        "Alison: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Aaron: Why not?",
        "Alison: I mean, why do I need a pet when I have you?",
        "Aaron: Ah, just don't send me to obedience school.",
        "Alison: That's a thought. I could get you, you know, a leash and a leather collar with studs.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I didn't know you were so kinky.",
        "Alison: Well, there's a lot of things you don't know about me.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah? Like what?",
        "Alison: You know, like I'm thinking about taking a cooking class so you don't have to live on frozen food.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah. She's getting domestic.",
        "Alison: Why not? I'm an old married woman now. I have to take on certain responsibilities.",
        "Aaron: Except you don't want a dog.",
        "Alison: Not right now.",
        "Aaron: What about a baby?",

        "Dani: Come here, puppy. Come on.",
        "Chris: I don't get it.",
        "Dani: Maybe he's just not that into me.",
        "Chris: I don't see why not. He loves his mommy.",
        "Dani: Who?",
        "Chris: I'm just saying this dog is definitely into girls.",
        "Dani: Okay, well, not this girl. Let's forget about the puppy for now, okay? Let's concentrate on you. You need to try this soup before it gets cold. So when did you start getting sick?",
        "Chris: Well, technically, I'm not. More like a personal day.",
        "Dani: Okay, is this maybe because a certain nursing student, uh, married another guy?",
        "Chris: I thought about what you said at the wedding. Alison made her choice. I have to live with that.",
        "Dani: Uh-huh, and that -- that is not so easy, so now you feel like hiding and never coming out like Morty over here.",
        "Chris: Well, unlike Morty, I can be enticed by a pretty girl with a treat.",
        "Dani: Really? And what kind of treat are you talking about?",
        "Chris: This kind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Don't be too shocked.",
        "Alison: Of course I'm shocked. I thought you just said you wanted us to have a baby.",
        "Aaron: I did. I do want to have a baby. I mean, would that be so bad?",
        "Alison: Aaron, hello, we don't even have a place to live right now.",
        "Aaron: Yes, we do. We can stay at the farm. There's plenty of rooms.",
        "Alison: I don't think that's such a great idea.",
        "Aaron: It's just temporary. We'll stay there, we'll save up some money, then we'll get a place of our own. And meanwhile, we have tons of family who can help us out.",
        "Alison: Okay, whoa, down, Boy.",
        "Aaron: Come on. What's the problem?",
        "Alison: The problem? The problem is this just came out of nowhere, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I've always thought about us having a family.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know, but I thought it was, you know, down the road a while.",
        "Aaron: Okay, how far down the road?",
        "Alison: After I get my nursing license, maybe, and after we're both a little more established.",
        "Aaron: Alison, I didn't grow up in a big family with lots of kids, okay, but when I got back with my father and I started having all these cousins and brothers and sisters, you know, it was really cool to be a part of a big, you know, rowdy family that loves each other.",
        "Alison: Okay, big is fine. Rowdy is fine. But dysfunctional, not so much. And that was my family. And I don't want to repeat their mistakes.",
        "Aaron: Well, then you won't. Think of this as a way to have another chance to do something right. Ali, ever since we've been together, we've messed up a lot of things, okay? This time, I want it for keeps. And maybe the best way to keep that and to do it right is to have a baby. Just promise me you'll think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Dani: Uh, I don't know. This is just a surprise.",
        "Chris: If you don't want to do this.",
        "Dani: No, no, no, no. I do want to do this. It's just, I didn't really expect it to happen like this.",
        "Chris: No? Coming here with chicken soup, showing up at the hospital all the time?",
        "Dani: Okay, so I've had a crush on you.",
        "[Morty barking]",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Dani: Which some might not approve of.",
        "Chris: Hey, I didn't say anything.",
        "Dani: Um, you know, I just don't know if this is right, considering where your head is right now?",
        "Chris: So you think this is a problem?",
        "Dani: Well, you know, you can't be with Alison, so you're trying to turn the page, and I don't know if this is the right time. You know, for us.",
        "Chris: Let me see if I can help you decide.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Chris: Maybe I am the one with the problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: The girls were the last ones to see him, but they have no idea where he went.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll talk to Faith and Natalie.",
        "Holden: I'm not sure how much more they can tell you.",
        "Lily: And Natalie feels responsible, and Faith, too. I mean, this has been such a toll on her.",
        "Jack: I just want to ask them some questions, okay? Even the smallest detail will be helpful.",
        "Holden: All right, they're upstairs.",
        "Jack: In the meantime, maybe you should get Margo involved, have her put out an Amber Alert.",
        "Holden: Jack, I assumed that you would have already done that.",
        "Jack: No, I didn't do that, Holden, okay? I think it's best if you call her.",
        "Holden: Is something going on?",
        "Jack: I resigned from the force today.",
        "Lily: I'll call Margo.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Holden: Resigned from the force? Why would you do that?",
        "Carly: That is not important right now. Really, we should concentrate on finding Ethan.",
        "Holden: You're right.",
        "Lily: Yes. I need to report a missing child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm just saying, I don't think it's practical for us right now to have a baby. I mean, I want to finish nursing school and start a career.",
        "Aaron: As you should. And I don't want to tend bar forever, okay, but we can still start a family. I can work nights and I can watch the baby while you're in school during the day.",
        "Alison: That doesn't leave a lot of time for us.",
        "Aaron: Baby, I'll make some time for us, okay?",
        "Alison: You've got this all worked out, don't you?",
        "Aaron: It's got to work for you. It's got to be fine with you and it's got to be fine with both of us.",
        "Alison: Well, eventually, it will be. But, you know, right now, I mean, there's a lot of things I want to accomplish, and I don't know if I'm ready to deal with 3:00 A.M. feedings and diaper changes.",
        "Aaron: Don't worry about the diaper change. I got that down. I took care of Ethan.",
        "Alison: I know you will be a great dad. Some day.",
        "Aaron: Some day's fine, as long as I know we're gonna has a big family in the future.",
        "Alison: Big?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I didn't say big family.",
        "Aaron: Well, how about, you know, three or four?",
        "Alison: Okay, I have to go to work, so can we talk about this later?",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast. I called Bob Hughes and asked him to have some time off for you. So, surprise, Mrs. Snyder, we're going on our honeymoon after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm really sorry, Dani, all right? It's not about you. I think you're beautiful, smart, funny -- I really like you.",
        "Dani: Thank you.",
        "Chris: I like you too much to use you, and that's exactly what I'd be doing. You know, I put a woman in that position before. It ended badly. It was all my fault. I don't want to be that guy.",
        "Dani: I know, I know. You had a rough time with Alison.",
        "Chris: I think it's just gonna take some time.",
        "Dani: I agree. But as long as we're still friends, you won't be using me.",
        "Chris: Do you mean, like, friends with benefits?",
        "Dani: How about we are friends who have fun, and down the road, who knows? You are way too good a kisser for me to let go of. So, um, keep it coming, Doc.",
        "Chris: You're really great, Dani. I just wish I didn't have so much baggage.",
        "Dani: You'll get over Alison. She's moved on. And you will, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You got Bob to give me time off?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I mean, you wanted a honeymoon, right?",
        "Alison: Sure. Sure. I'm just surprised you did all this without, you know, asking me.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's why it's a surprise. Check it out. I booked us an awesome room at a B&B on Lake Michigan. It's like a spa. In every room, there's a heart-shaped Jacuzzi.",
        "Alison: Well, it looks incredible. I'm just, I wish I had known so I could have planned for this.",
        "Aaron: No, you don't need to. I knew you had a full plate, so I took care of it.",
        "Alison: Well, I certainly have a very wonderful husband. Did you pack a bag for me, too?",
        "Aaron: What are you, crazy? No, I'm leaving that to you.",

        "Margo: Oh, it's no problem. Jack.",

        "Lily: Yes, yeah. These.",
        "Margo: Okay, these are perfect. Okay, have Gonzales take these back to headquarters. Who was the last to see Ethan?",
        "Lily: Faith and Natalie.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I already questioned them. I doubt they'll remember anything more, but if you want to talk to them, you're the one in charge.",
        "Margo: Jack, please stop. Badge or no badge, I trust you instincts. Now, what's your gut?",
        "Jack: To me, it looks like Ethan wandered off on his own. No foul play.",

        "Holden: That was my stable hand, Eddie. He said that he thinks he saw Ethan out in the field, so I'm gonna head out there and check it out.",
        "Lily: I'll go with you.",
        "Margo: And I will go talk to the man in the van.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Well, I hope Ethan didn't wander out here. It looks treacherous.",
        "Jack: Yeah, this is the area that Paul Ryan's developing. But it wasn't this dug up the last time I saw it. That's quite a drop.",
