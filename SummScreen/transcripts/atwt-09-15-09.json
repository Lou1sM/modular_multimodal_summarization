        "Damian: Not yet. Lily, sit down. You okay?",
        "Lily: Yeah, yeah. Can I -- can I get you a cup of coffee?",
        "Damian: No, thank you, and you shouldn't be having anything that will keep you awake. Did you sleep last night?",
        "Lily: An hour or two. What -- what else did the police say?",
        "Damian: That's pretty much it. Lily, I just want to make sure you realize that any answer we might get is not gonna tell us much.",
        "Lily: But if Holden wrote that letter --",
        "Damian: Look, you're looking for proof that Holden's alive, and that's only natural. But he couldn't have survived that crash, Lily. He just couldn't. I don't want you to get false hopes.",
        "Lily: False hope is better than no hope.",

        "Vienna: What? Where?",
        "Henry: I'm running late for a meeting at the lawyer's office.",
        "Vienna: Oh, is this about James Stenbeck's estate?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I got to sign a few papers before I can get my inheritance, that's all.",
        "Vienna: And then more papers when you're handing over all the money to your mother, right?",

        "Vienna: But you made a solemn vow!",
        "Henry: I know I did. I know. I know. Mm, 'cause I knew how much it meant to you. I knew. I knew. But then I thought about it, and I thought, \"Look, James is taking this money from Paul and giving it to me.\" Well, I don't know -- it would be disrespectful to his memory to refuse. Do you understand what I'm saying?",
        "Vienna: I do.",

        "Damian: Without checking with me?",
        "Meg: Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. It's all set. We finally get to have some time alone together, away from my family and all the cares and woes.",
        "Damian: I, um, I suppose a -- a long weekend together might be nice.",
        "Meg: Two weeks would be better.",
        "Damian: Two weeks? How can you possibly get away for that long? What about Eliza?",
        "Meg: We'll -- we'll take her with us. So, what do you think? Do you like the idea?",
        "Damian: Yeah, of course. Yeah, so, when are we taking this big trip?",
        "Meg: Ah, we leave tonight.",
        "Damian: Sweetheart, you should have checked with me before. I mean, I can't possibly leave tonight.",
        "Meg: How many times have you told me that you could run your business from anywhere in the world? All you need is a laptop and a phone.",
        "Damian: Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't really --",
        "Meg: Okay, so what else is keeping you here?",
        "Damian: Well, you must admit that the timing is a little delicate, right? Meg I mean, your brother passing away has been hard on your family, and for both of us to have right now -- I mean, people might think it's insensitive.",
        "Meg: Well, my biggest concern is my mother, and she's away visiting Seth. Now, if you're thinking about how this is gonna affect Luke --",
        "Damian: Well, yeah, well, he is my son and I've been gone for much of his life. I can't desert him now. And you know how close he and Holden were.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe you can call him, run it by him, see how he feels.",
        "Damian: No matter what he said, I would feel as if I were abandoning him.",
        "Meg: It's just a couple of weeks.",
        "Damian: All right, I can see this means a lot to you. Just give me some time to work out the logistics, and then we can take the trip next month, okay?",
        "Meg: I already booked everything. Everything's been prepaid, and it's nonrefundable.",
        "Damian: Don't worry about the expenses. I'll take care of it.",
        "Meg: I guess I shouldn't have planned anything without checking with you first.",
        "Damian: Are you mad at me?",
        "Meg: I'm, uh, disappointed, but I'll get over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I try not to think about it -- about him being in pain or alone, but I can't turn my mind off and -- it's tearing me apart. I mean, I just feel like I'm going crazy.",
        "Susan: You're grieving. And under the circumstances, what you're experiencing is par for the course. Have you taken anything to help you sleep?",
        "Lily: Just a few over-the-counter pills that Damian gave me, but they didn't work.",
        "Susan: I'm gonna prescribe something a little stronger.",
        "Lily: Susan, is there any way we could avoid that?",
        "Susan: I know you've been treated for addiction.",
        "Lily: Yeah, to anti-anxiety medication. I mean, that's why I've been so careful not to take anything.",
        "Susan: You don't have to explain to me. I know how scary it is to start that or even take a chance and starting that cycle again.",
        "Lily: What scares me the most is how it would affect my kids. I mean, Faith has been acting out so much since Holden's death, and if she thought I was developing --",
        "Susan: No, we're not gonna let that happen. I'll just write a prescription that'll last a few days.",
        "Lily: You think that'll be enough?",
        "Susan: Well, it'll be enough to break the cycle of wakefulness and get you back to a sleep pattern. Then we'll discontinue it.",
        "Lily: I think what I'm most afraid of is the dreaming.",
        "Susan: Before you go to sleep, think of all the good times you had with Holden, and hopefully, that's what you'll dream about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come here. Come here. I thought you loved me.",
        "Vienna: Get one thing straight, Henry. I don't just love you. I adore you. I need you like I need my next breath of air. Please, I gotta go pack.",
        "Henry: What? No, wait. What? Wait a second. If you feel that way, then how can you leave me?",
        "Vienna: It's called self respect, Henry.",
        "Henry: Oh, Honey, me inheriting James' money -- it's not a big deal. What you and I have is worth more than anything.",
        "Vienna: What do we have, Henry?",
        "Henry: We've got love, and we've got laughter, and we've got commitment, and we've got friendship, and we've got great sex. What could be better than that?",
        "Vienna: If you had kept your promises, that would be much better. Just, please, just give the money to your mother.",
        "Henry: I can't give it to Audrey. She's the one that murdered James.",
        "Vienna: Well, then give it to charity.",
        "Henry: Alot of it? Sweetie, Sweetie. No, listen. Listen to me. I don't think you're realizing what we can do with this money. Now, we can buy a place here. We can get a place with a pool and a sauna and a heliport.",
        "Vienna: And lots of room for all the children we won't have?",
        "Henry: Whoa. Who says we won't have children if we want to?",
        "Vienna: I don't want to have children with a man who can't keep his promises.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, we can work this out. Please don't leave. Please.",
        "Vienna: I don't know how to live without you.",
        "Henry: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Vienna: But if that money isn't out of your hands by tonight, I'm getting on a plane by tomorrow.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Audrey: Good morning, you two.",
        "Henry: Not now, Mother.",
        "Vienna: Henry?",
        "Henry: I can't.",
        "Vienna: What? Okay.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Vienna. Vienna, wait!",
        "Audrey: Oh, well, she seems upset. Wait a minute. Is she packing here? Son, you're telling me she's leaving you?",
        "Henry: No, but she will if I don't give away James Stenbeck's money.",
        "Audrey: Okay, I can help you there. Just sign it all over to me, and then everything will work out like we planned.",
        "Henry: Like we planned? No. You're the one who masterminded my father's murder, not me. I'm not giving you one cent of that money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I cannot believe I let you set me up like this again! I did not want to marry you. I was perfectly happy the way things were. And you -- you badger me into saying yes, and then what? You back out on me again? You know what you are, Paul? You are selfish and spoiled and manipulative.",
        "Paul: I'm selfish. It's true I'm selfish. I want to bind you to me forever in holy matrimony.",
        "Emily: Are you being manipulative?",
        "Paul: Ooh. I don't know. I kind of feel like being a little manipulative. Oh, you smell good.",
        "Emily: What are you saying? Do you want to marry me or not?",
        "Paul: Yeah, that'd be great.",
        "Emily: So, why did you say you didn't?",
        "Paul: No, I said I didn't want to get married at city hall.",
        "Emily: Why not?",
        "Paul: Because the first time we got married, you shot me in the back.",
        "Emily: Yeah, because you broke our engagement.",
        "Paul: And the second time, it was just a big fraud. It was a scam, a fake, right?",
        "Emily: It was a fake because you wanted to set Meg free from jail.",
        "Paul: You kidnapped Dusty, and you were trying to keep --",
        "Emily: Oh, my God! We really shouldn't get married, because every time we're together, it gets criminal.",
        "Paul: The next time we get married, I'm gonna bring it to a whole other level.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Now you're scaring me.",
        "Paul: Like in a church.",
        "Emily: You're serious?",

        "Paul: Maybe half of them.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Paul: Why? I want to show my family and yours that this is the real thing. You can throw flowers. You can wear a garter.",
        "Emily: Oh, no! I don't -- wait. Just -- a garter? I don t know. I'd feel so foolish. Everybody knows our history. Everybody.",
        "Paul: Yeah, all the more reason to prove to everybody that it's different this time.",
        "Emily: Different. Okay, I draw the line at wearing white.",
        "Paul: You can wear a white garter. You could wear nothing at all. As long as we show the whole world that we're forever.",

        "Damian: I've been thinking about what you said before, and I don't want you to misunderstand. I always want to be with you, Meg.",
        "Meg: Then come with me to Aruba.",
        "Damian: I can't. Not yet.",

        "Damian: I'm trying, Meg --",
        "Meg: And I know Luke is just a kid and I should be able to take care of myself. And you know what? I probably should just pack up Eliza, and we could just go together.",
        "Damian: Why don't you?",
        "Meg: Because with you, it would be heaven. And without you, it'd just be lonely. And I would have too much time to miss my brother. Why'd you stop?",
        "Damian: Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in front of the baby.",
        "Meg: She doesn't mind.",
        "Damian: Well, apparently, I do. So, we'll have to make sure that Eliza has her own room in Aruba tonight.",
        "Meg: Do you mean that?",
        "Damian: Yeah. I'll go pack a bag and meet you back here, okay?",

        "Emily: Yeah, only because I have to break the news to my mother today.",
        "Paul: Yeah, good luck with that.",
        "Emily: You know what? Forget it. I'm just gonna bite the bullet and get it over with.",

        "Paul: A little? Hi, I'd like the telephone number for a club in Oakdale called Metro. Hey.",
        "Meg: Sorry to interrupt. The housekeeper told me to come in.",
        "Paul: No, please, come on. Is Eliza okay?",
        "Meg: No, she's great. She's actually really great. I wanted to know if you wanted to watch her for a while.",

        "Meg: Well, yeah, you would have in the past.",
        "Paul: Um, I'm happy for you. I'm glad you're happy. All I've ever really wanted was for you to be happy. I hope you're happy for me when you hear what I have to say.",

        "Emily: Okay. Oh, no, here we go. Go ahead, let her rip.",
        "Susan: Somebody who hadn't broken your heart a million times, somebody with a little honor and somebody who wasn't in love with somebody else.",

        "Susan: Honey, that guy is flakier than a croissant. Emily, two months ago, he was obsessed with Meg. He kidnapped her baby. And then, the last thing I hear uh -- uh, he claimed to have no memory.",
        "Emily: No, he didn't claim anything. They took something out of his brain, okay? And it left him with amnesia.",
        "Susan: So, what did you do? Catch it? Have you forgotten all the terrible things he did to you?",

        "Audrey: Charity? Where on earth did you get that dumb idea?",
        "Henry: Well, it wasn't my idea. It was Vienna's idea, but that doesn't matter. If that's what I have to do to keep her, then that is what I'm going to do. Even if hurts like hell.",

        "Emily: Just come celebrate with us. Decide to be happy for us.",
        "Susan: All right, I will.",
        "Emily: You will?",
        "Susan: Yep.",
        "Emily: You will? And you're gonna come, you're gonna smile, you're gonna be nice to Paul?",
        "Susan: I can do that, because you're my daughter and I love you. I just hope to hell you don't rue this day.",
        "Emily: Hmm, okay. Well, you know what? Coming from you, that qualifies as congratulations, so I'll take it. Thank you, Mom. Okay. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know, I don't mean to criticize, but given that Emily once shot you in the back, do you really want to marry her?",
        "Paul: Look, Emily's very intense and, you know, at times, as crazy as I am.",
        "Meg: Crazier.",
        "Paul: But I kind of look at it like that makes us kindred spirits.",
        "Meg: You really believe that?",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Meg: Because you were in love with me once, Paul. You married me, we had a child together, and I am nothing like Emily.",
        "Paul: I look back on the time that I spent with you -- and it's like I never really got to be myself, you know, because I was always trying so hard to hold onto you, to impress you. And I don't know, with Emily, I can just kind of be.",
        "Meg: What can I say? Congratulations, Paul.",
        "Paul: Same -- same to you, you know? Damian -- that's great. How are things? Things are good?",
        "Meg: Yeah, he manages to make me feel loved without hovering, something I never had before.",
        "Paul: Right. Look at us.",
        "Meg: Yeah, we each have someone else.",

        "Audrey: Vienna really doesn't want you to take James' money, right?",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Well, what if you could get exactly the same amount of money, but in a legit fashion? Would she want you to give it away then?",
        "Henry: Well, no, of course not. But how could we possibly do that?",
        "Audrey: Metro. Metro's going to re-open with a new chef, and you are half owner.",
        "Henry: So?",
        "Audrey: So, what if you got a whole lot of new customers?",
        "Henry: Mom, Mom, we would have to pack the joint every night and twice on Sundays to come even close to the amount of money that James left. There's no way that we could legally make that much cash.",
        "Audrey: Unless I bring in Ralph.",
        "Henry: What is a Ralph, and how does it help me keep Vienna?",

        "Damian: You don't know? Oh, never mind that. Let's get you home.",
        "Lily: I don't know what happened.",
        "Damian: You haven't been getting enough rest, and it's made all this seem unbearable. Lily, do you know what it did to me when I saw you drowning?",
        "Lily: Damian, you don't think -- I didn't try to kill myself.",
        "Damian: Then how did you end up in the water?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Damian: You promised me you were gonna see a doctor today.",
        "Lily: I did. I saw Susan Stewart. She gave me those pills.",
        "Damian: Did you take these?",
        "Lily: I went to sleep. And Holden was here.",
        "Damian: You were dreaming about him, you mean?",
        "Lily: It didn't feel like a dream. He was here. I could see him. And then he called me, and I followed him.",
        "Damian: You were sleepwalking.",
        "Lily: It was so real. It was heaven to have him back, to see him.",
        "Damian: How did you get in the water?",
        "Lily: He asked me to come in the water to swim with him, and -- and then he -- he disappeared. I panicked, and I couldn't swim. I was so scared. And then you were there. Why were you there?",
        "Damian: I was on my way back here to check on you.",
        "Lily: But I told you not to come back. I told you to stay with Meg.",
        "Damian: It's a good thing I didn't listen. You're still shivering. Its okay, Lily. You're all right. I won't let anything happen to you.",

        "Audrey: Ralph has a lot of money, and he needs to put it into circulation.",
        "Henry: Clarify.",
        "Audrey: Well, when you mentioned charity, it made me stop and think. Ralph has a charitable organization.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah? What's the name of this charity?",
        "Audrey: Um, I don't know. Something like children of adversity or something. I don't know. It doesn't matter. The point is, is with James' money, you make a donation to the foundation.",
        "Henry: What does the foundation support?",
        "Audrey: Mostly Ralph.",
        "Henry: Oh, you must think I'm a real idiot. I write a check for all my money. To some friend of yours, and I never see it again.",
        "Audrey: Oh, sure you do. Ralph needs your money, and he needs to give his money to you.",
        "Henry: You're not making any sense, Mother.",
        "Audrey: Okay, okay, listen to me. You make a donation to the foundation, and then Ralph turns around and gives the exact same amount to Metro. You see? You now have given away James' money, and you've gotten the same amount through a business venture. Vienna's happy. You're happy. I'm happy. And you never have to deal with me again.",
        "Henry: Well, that's -- now, that's tempting. That's very temping. So, I give Ralph -- wait a minute, Mother. I give Ralph my money, he gives me the money. That's money laundering. That's illegal.",
        "Audrey: Well, so is a lot of gambling, but that never kept you from taking a seat at the table. Well, do you want to keep the money or do you not?",
        "Henry: If it means hooking up with a gangster to launder money through a club that I am part owner of, then the answer is absolutely no.",

        "Emily: Didn't expect to see you here today.",

        "Meg: If that's not too much trouble.",
        "Emily: No. Oh, my, no. I think its great that Paul that gets to spend time with his daughter. You planning on popping in every day to check on them -- you know, dispensing hugs and kisses?",
        "Paul: Meg's not gonna be in town.",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Paul: She'll be in Aruba with Damian.",

        "Paul: You're jealous.",
        "Emily: Stop it. It's just a little post-traumatic stress from seeing my mother. She greeted our engagement with a lot of gloom and doom.",

        "Vienna: Those are very pretty. But you shouldn't have wasted any of your millions, because I can't carry it on the plane.",

        "Vienna: Oh, so you'll get it tomorrow. Congratulations. I hope you enjoy it.",
        "Henry: Listen, I rescheduled because I realized that I couldn't enjoy being rich without you. You make everything -- everything more fun, even working hard and living paycheck to paycheck.",

        "Henry: I'm saying that I'm going to sign the papers and get the money and then give it away.",
        "Vienna: To your mother?",
        "Henry: No. I can't reward Audrey. She's the one that bumped off Daddy Stenbeck. No, I'm gonna take the money and give it away to charity.",
        "Vienna: Which one?",
        "Henry: I -- I don't know. One we can find together, if you still want to be with me.",
        "Vienna: Oh! Of course I want to be with you. Thank you for giving up millions for me, Henry.",
        "Henry: Aye-yi-yi. Yeah, okay. You -- you remember this moment -- come here. You remember this moment when some rich dude sweeps you off your feet, okay?",
        "Vienna: Well, some rich dude will never have a chance.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah why's that?",

        "Meg: Damian, hey. I keep getting your voicemail. Where are you? I thought that you would be here at the farm, all packed and ready to go. But you know what? I'm glad you're not, because I have a surprise for you, and I think you are gonna love what I'm taking on our trip with us. Anyway, you are probably running around like a crazy person, trying to get everything done before we leave. But call me, okay?",

        "Ralph: Yeah, of course. So, tell me something. Did you talk to your son about the deal?",
