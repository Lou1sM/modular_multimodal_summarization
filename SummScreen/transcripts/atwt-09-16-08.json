        "Katie: And that is how to prepare your summer garden for the winter. I do love the changing of the seasons. It's wonderful, right, Brad?",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Katie: Brad.",
        "Kim: Cut! Everybody take five. Brad, is there any chance that you could get your act together in the next five minutes?",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, Kim. I'm sorry. I'm just really out of it.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, get back into it or you and I are gonna have some words.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Brad. I can't keep holding this show together by myself.",
        "Brad: I can't focus. I can't focus. You know, I got one eye peeled on the door, expecting Margo to bust in here and drag me off to -- drag me off to jail.",
        "Katie: You can't think that way.",
        "Brad: Look, you didn't see the look on Jack's face. I know the minute he left us, he was headed straight for OPD to turn me in.",
        "Katie: No, he would never do that.",
        "Brad: My straight-arrow brother wouldn't think he had a choice, not after me burning the evidence that connects me to Leo.",
        "Janet: You don't have to worry about that, Brad.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Katie: What do you know?",
        "Janet: Your brother is not gonna rat you out.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe not today, but he is a cop.",
        "Janet: No, he's not a cop anymore. He quit because of you.",

        "[Grunts]",
        "Vienna: Hello? Is somebody out there? Somebody? Anybody? I'm locked in! Hello?",
        "Bonnie: We -- we are locked in.",
        "Vienna: Did you find something on the other side?",
        "Bonnie: No. It's just another locked door.",
        "Vienna: I'm trying to listen for people, but there's nothing. I can't hear anything.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I guess there's not a lot of foot traffic in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Vienna: Because your thug boyfriend brought us to a place where no one will ever find us!",
        "Bonnie: Vienna, get a grip. It is time to use your head for something other than holding up your earrings. Now look. Derek would not do this for no reason. So what is it?",
        "Vienna: Well, maybe he's getting back at you for something.",
        "Bonnie: I didn't do anything. Maybe you did.",
        "Vienna: So now you're blaming me.",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no. Derek knew that you were looking for Henry.",
        "Vienna: So?",
        "Bonnie: So, what if, maybe, Derek didn't want you to find him.",
        "Vienna: Why? Oh, God. What if something horrible has happened to Henry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I am so sorry that lunch is late, Henry. You see, I got in this rather experimental mood.",
        "Henry: I'm not your guinea pig. What did you do with Bonnie and Vienna?",
        "James: You know, I think you're really going to like this -- Gay Pad Prik. I actually managed to find some exceptional curry paste.",
        "Henry: You told Derek to do something with them. What was it, James?",
        "James: That's a rather offensive tone for someone who's life and liberty in my hands.",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Henry: Derek. Derek! Bonnie and Vienna -- what did you do with them?",
        "James: You know, it really needs a little more jasmine rice. That helps set off the spices, you see? Let's not disturb Henry, while he's dining, with our little chat. All right. Paul -- his progress, how's it going?",
        "Derek: I'm afraid he's run into a little snag.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know I sound like I'm nagging you, but I really do think that you should go lie down and get some rest.",
        "Meg: You're trying to get rid of me.",
        "Paul: No. I'm trying to be a good husband to my pregnant wife and get her to follow doctor's orders.",
        "Meg: Well, you know what your pregnant wife would really like is to know that you're not putting her to bed so you can go back to that dig site and dig some more.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not.",
        "Meg: Did talking to the therapist help?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course. I'm -- yeah, I feel better. I'm gonna schedule another appointment as soon as I get some space.",
        "Meg: Well, you know, in the meantime, how about we do some hands-on therapy ourselves? Something like this.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Paul: Is that --",
        "Meg: Yeah. How about we spend some time taking a look at our baby?",

        "Jack: Ethan? Ethan?",
        "Carly: Do you see anything down there?",
        "Jack: Nothing.",
        "Carly: Well, that's good, isn't it? And this may not be his, Jack. Kids are losing shoes all the time.",
        "Jack: You're grasping at straws, Carly.",
        "Carly: We have to grasp at something, don't we? This is Holden and Lily's little boy we're talking about.",
        "Jack: You think I want to tell them what happened? It's not a call I want to make.",
        "Carly: Well, let's not, then. Let's not scare them to death if we don't have to.",
        "Jack: We don't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Think, Holden. You've got to think. Where else would he have gone?",
        "Holden: Lily, we've gone everywhere that we can possibly think of.",
        "Lily: What about that robin's nest? Remember, the one we found a couple of months ago?",
        "Holden: You think he might have gone back there?",
        "Lily: It's worth a try.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: Hey, Jack. Have you found him?",
        "Jack: Carly and I are at the construction site. We think you two should get over here.",
        "Holden: Okay, we're on our way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Where is he? Is he all right?",
        "Jack: Is this his?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: Where did you find it?",
        "Jack: Over here by the hole.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: What happened here? Jack, you don't think that he's down there, do you?",
        "Lily: He's not in there.",
        "Holden: Lily, we don't know that.",
        "Lily: Ethan! Ethan, if you can hear mommy, yell! Yell so I can come get you! Do you see him?",
        "Holden: Lily, I can't even see the bottom of the hole.",
        "Lily: Ethan?",
        "Holden: Ethan! Can you hear us?",

        "Frankie: Mrs. Hughes says your five's almost up.",
        "Katie: Okay, thanks, Frankie. We'll be right there.",
        "Brad: Jack resigned from the force? No way. No way. You must have your wires crossed.",
        "Janet: No. My wires are fine. Jack's the one who's been crossed, and we did it to him.",
        "Katie: But Jack loves being a detective. His job and his kids -- that's his entire life.",
        "Brad: Where are you getting this from?",
        "Janet: He told it to me himself. Are you happy now?",
        "Brad: This -- it's all my fault, right?",
        "Katie: I'll talk to Margo. I'll talk to my sister.",
        "Janet: Margo has nothing to do with this. Jack is determined to pay for this himself. It's something we made him do.",
        "Katie: Brad, Brad, this is not fair.",
        "Brad: No, no. Jack made his choice, all right? And there's nothing we can do to change that now, so we just should get back to work.",
        "Katie: You don't really mean that.",
        "Janet: Yeah, this is not right.",
        "Brad: Okay, as far as Margo's concerned, that evidence was lost. Jack could have left it to that. He could have left the whole thing alone, but he didn't.",
        "Janet: No, he couldn't. He couldn't because that's not who Jack is. We never should have burned that evidence.",
        "Brad: Would you rather me go to jail?",
        "Janet: I would rather you didn't try and drown someone in the Reservoir.",
        "Kim: What are you talking about? Brad? You tried to drown somebody?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Katie: We were on Route 7 and our car broke down. We had to call a tow truck, and the guy was such a jerk. He totally tried to rip us off. And Brad was so mad that he said, \"I want to throw the guy in the Reservoir.\"",
        "Brad: That would have been too good for him.",
        "Katie: You have such a temper.",
        "Brad: I know, I know.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, you know what? We'll just wait till it gets dark, and we'll go find his truck and siphon the gas out. It's fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ethan?",
        "Holden: Lily!",
        "Jack: Hold on a second. Let us check it out and make sure -- let us check it out and make sure the ground's not gonna give way. Why don't you go home and wait, and we'll call you --",
        "Lily: I'm not going anywhere, Jack! My child is down there! Ethan, can you hear me? Baby, are you all right?",
        "Ethan: Mommy?",
        "Holden: Its Mommy and Daddy, Buddy! We're gonna get you out of there as soon as we can!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I think she's got your eyes.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Well, you know, pretty soon, we will know if she is really a \"She.\" But you know, boy or girl, I think our baby is beautiful.",
        "Paul: Not as beautiful as what I'm looking at now.",
        "Meg: You know, I know you've had a really tough time lately, and whatever has happened on the side isn't really your fault. I really need you to look ahead because this, our baby, that's what counts. You know, I think I'm gonna take your advice and go upstairs and take a little nap. Do you care to make it a family affair?",
        "Paul: I'll be up in a little while.",
        "Meg: Okay. See you later.",
        "James: Very touching, Paul. I had to fight back the tears.",
        "Paul: You've never shed a genuine tear in your life.",
        "James: There's no time for emotion. Time to be practical. But one cold bar is not gonna hold off your loan shark for very long, hmm? An image of my gran --",
        "Paul: No way. No way you ever get anywhere near my child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I knew it. I knew it from the beginning that it was your fault that Henry disappeared. Your fault. Your boyfriend, he made this happen. You just admitted it.",
        "Bonnie: I didn't admit anything. I just said that maybe Derek had something to do with it. But at least we know that Henry's okay. He did call you, didn't he?",
        "Vienna: To warn me! Henry called me and told me he was playing blackjack, which is his way of telling me that he needed help. I tried to help him, and well, here we are.",
        "Bonnie: You know, I never thought I would say this, but you could be right.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: You don't have to worry about Vienna or Bonnie. They're fine.",
        "Henry: Not until you let them go, they're not.",
        "Derek: Hey, let me give you a little advice, okay? The best thing you can do is just wait this out.",
        "Henry: Derek, please.",
        "Derek: I haven't hurt Bonnie or Vienna, and I'm not going to.",
        "Henry: Right, right. And I should trust you because you've been so trustworthy up to this point. And, oh, yeah, you're James Stenbeck's flunky! Let's not forget that!",
        "Derek: Oh, is that how you want to play this?",
        "Henry: Just tell me where they are, please?",
        "Derek: You're forgetting, I don't have to tell you anything. Now, are you finished with your meal?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm finished. I'm finished with it, all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ethan, are you hurt? Tell Mommy if you're hurt! I can't hear him.",
        "Holden: You need to just keep talking to him, okay? So that he hears your voice. That way, he'll stay calm.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, it's Mommy, okay? Listen, I know it's dark down there, but you don't have to be scared. Mommy's right here.",
        "Holden: Is he calling to get more people out here to help?",
        "Carly: I think he's talking to someone from the department, but I don't know what he's saying.",
        "Holden: Listen, Carly. You need to do me a favor. You need to go find Faith and tell her what's going on, okay? I'm afraid that if Lily or I do it, we might upset her more than I want to do right now.",
        "Carly: Okay. What should I say?",
        "Holden: I don't know. Just think of something. I trust you.",
        "Jack: I called off the search, and I put in a call to the rescue squad.",
        "Mike: Hey, Guys. What are you guys doing here?",
        "Holden: You want to tell me what kind of operation you're running out here?",
        "Mike: Well, I'm trying to run a safe one, which is why I need you to leave.",
        "Holden: A safe one? Then why is my son trapped at the bottom of this pit?",
        "Mike: Ethan? I had the entire thing cordoned off with planks.",
        "Holden: Yeah? Well, where are they now, Mike?",
        "Mike: I did -- there's no way that Ethan would be able to move those planks! Lily, oh, my God! Is he okay?",
        "Lily: He said a few things, but, Mike, you got to get him out of there. It's dark, and he's alone, and he's afraid of the dark.",
        "Mike: We will get him out. I promise.",
        "Holden: I think we need to wait. We need to wait for the rescue crew to get here.",
        "Lily: No, if Mike can do something, he would do it now, Holden.",
        "Mike: Okay, look. The first thing that we need to do is shore up the sides of the hole. I'll get started on that.",
        "Paul: Hey. What's going on? What happened?",
        "Holden: I'll tell you what happened. Somebody left this huge hole uncovered and our son is at the bottom of this pit! If anything happens to him --",
        "Lily: Don't say that. Don't you ever say that!",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry. We'll do everything we can. And I'm sure -- I'm sure Ethan will be fine.",
        "Holden: Do me a favor. Will you call Meg, let her know what happened?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Lily: I just wish there was a way that we could give him his blanket. Maybe then he wouldn't be so scared.",

        "Bonnie: Help! Help!",
        "[Truck wheels squealing]",
        "Vienna: You can't be tired already!",
        "Bonnie: There's something! It sounds like a truck!",
        "Vienna: Help! Help us! Hello? Help us! Hello? Hello?",
        "Bonnie: Don't just stand there! Go grab something and bang! Your shoe or something! Just make some noise! Help!",
        "Vienna: Hello? Hello? Don't go away! No!",
        "Bonnie: Oh, God. I feel the same way.",
        "Vienna: No, you don't. Because this -- this was one of my last pair of designer shoes, and you owe me 325 Euros!",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no. I did not break your ugly, overpriced shoe.",
        "Vienna: No, but you brought a kidnapping criminal into our life, and you made me break my shoe to top off the whole thing!",
        "Bonnie: Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Henry had a lot of shady connections, Vienna, so how do we know one of them isn't to blame?",
        "Vienna: Stop saying his name! I want to keep this place --",
        "Bonnie: Whoa! Is that what you want, to get physical, Vienna? Is that what you want? Then I am always ready!",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Bonnie: Bring it on. Come on. Come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: You idiot! This suit cost more than your whole damn club. I'm trying to be nice to you, Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, really? Yeah, you and your boss have been a couple of princes. Remind me to tip the maid before I leave these stunning accommodations.",
        "Derek: Come on now, Henry. You're a smart guy. You know, this could end a whole lot worse for you. If I lose my patience, it's gonna be a whole different ball game.",
        "Henry: You know, Derek, it's really hard to take a threat seriously from a guy who's covered in Gai Pad Prik.",

        "Kim: Come on. Wait a minute. You've been walking around here like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.",
        "Brad: You know what I think it is? I just think it's that thing with the car. I hate getting ripped off, and it's a horrible way to begin the day.",
        "Kim: You're telling me that that's what this is all about? It makes no sense at all.",
        "Frankie: Mrs. Hughes, you have a call.",
        "Kim: I'm not finished.",
        "Katie: It's just, you have to keep a lid on this whole Leo thing, especially around here. I know you didn't mean to, but you almost blew this entire thing right in front of Kim.",
        "Janet: But I didn't, did I? No. Brad still has his job. Jack doesn't.",
        "Brad: Jack threw away his job for no good reason, Janet.",
        "Katie: Would you sh --",
        "Brad: She's acting like she had nothing to do with it. You were willing to do anything to keep me a party of liberty's life.",
        "Janet: I was upset! I made a huge, big mistake! Big!",
        "Kim: Brad, Katie!",
        "Katie: What? Are you listening to me? Okay. What's going on?",
        "Kim: There's been a terrible accident out at the Snyder farm. I want you two to get out there with the crew and cover it.",
        "Janet: Was Jack involved?",
        "Katie: Was anyone hurt?",
        "Kim: I don't know. I don't know anything yet. Get your gear together. You'll be briefed on the way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: He must be so scared down there. No blanket, no sweater. I can't bear the thought of him being cold or hurt.",
        "Holden: As long as you keep talking to him. As long as he hears your voice, he won't get scared.",
        "Jack: There's a child down in the hole. May have sustained some injuries, but, at this point, we don't know. He's responsive, so we know he's conscious.",
        "Dallas: How deep we talking?",
        "Jack: Well, that ground is still shifting, so we can't get any clear bearings. Now that the press is here, you might want to get the civilians away from it.",
        "Dallas: Okay.",
        "Jack: It's not my job anymore. It's yours. You need any help, let me know.",
        "Carly: I let Faith know that Ethan's been found and that everybody's working together to make sure that he gets home safely. I tried to reach Emma, but she's not home yet.",
        "Holden: Okay, thanks.",
        "Carly: I don't suppose there's any word.",
        "Holden: No, no. I wish there were.",
        "Lily: How long until you can get him out of there.",
        "Mike: It depends on how long it takes to secure the area. We can't make a move until then.",
        "Carly: Hi. I thought you could use this.",
        "Lily: Take your water and get the hell away from me. Stay away from me! Stay away from my family!",
        "Carly: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Listen, Carly, if you want to help me, you got to get out of here because I need to focus all my energy on getting my son out of there.",
        "Carly: If you need me to go, I'll go, but I'm not gonna stop doing whatever I can to help. I love Ethan, too.",

        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: I woke up and you weren't there. I thought you were gonna join us. Please tell me you didn't go to the work site.",
        "Paul: I did.",
        "Meg: Paul, why? You said you wouldn't do that!",
        "Paul: Before you get upset, there's been an accident. Ethan's in trouble.",
        "Meg: Is he badly hurt?",
        "Paul: He fell down a pit, and it's really deep. EMS is there. They're trying to get him out.",
        "Meg: Oh, my God. He must be so terrified.",
        "Paul: And Holden and Lily.",
        "Meg: Oh, my God. They must be going through hell. I need to get out there.",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Meg: It's my family. I need to go.",
        "Paul: No. Your unborn child is your family. You need to get some rest. You need to avoid stressful situations.",
        "Meg: Sitting here, waiting for news, is gonna be a lot more stressful than me being out there seeing things happen. I need to go, Paul, so you can either drive me or I'll go by myself.",
        "Paul: You're gonna need a little jacket.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Now what am I gonna do?",
        "James: I don't see you digging, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's because of your stupid digging, looking for your stupid pot of gold, some kid fell down a pit. If anything happens to him -- god forbid, if anything happened to him, it's on me. It's my fault.",
        "James: Well, sitting around moping isn't going to help anyone.",
        "Paul: I'm done. Your little treasure hunt is over.",
        "James: I cannot believe that I have a son that's such a coward. Stop whining, Paul. Do something. Take some action. For once, act like a man.",
        "Paul: So, if I show any kind of compassion or show any kind of remorse, then I'm a coward in your eyes?",

        "Paul: Hey. Hey! I'm done.",
        "James: No, no, no. You're not done. Because if you don't get out there and keep digging, that loan-shark friend of yours is gonna cost you infinitely more money than my plan will, and you will lose both people that make your life worth living.",
        "Paul: No. I'll never lose Meg.",
        "James: Then why don't you fight for her? Destroy any evidence that puts you anywhere near that site. Deny any accusations, fabricate a story, cover your tracks. Come on! That's my boy.",
        "Paul: Don't you ever call me that again.",
        "James: By not saying the words doesn't make it less true.",
        "Paul: Will you just shut up? Shut up!",
        "Meg: Paul? What's wrong? Who are you talking to?",
        "Paul: I'm talking to him!",
        "Meg: There's no one there, Paul.",
        "Paul: Of course not.",
        "Meg: Then why are --",
        "Paul: I'm just trying to work some stuff out, and I got carried away.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Paul: It's no big deal. Come on, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: What's wrong?",
        "James: Nothing that a little demonstration of backbone from my son couldn't fix. Get out to the site and make sure everything's going to plan.",
        "Henry: You really are running a gulag in this cellar down here, James. I mean, the fine cuisine and wonderful wine notwithstanding, I believe you're breaking some Geneva conventions.",
        "James: My son is a disappointment to me.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry to hear that. You know, what's not a disappointment, though, is a Mouton Rothschild. Would you care to join me for a glass?",
        "James: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I have to warn you, I have been taking self-defense classes.",
        "Vienna: Oh, really? To protect yourself against all the women who want to kill you for stealing their husbands?",
        "Bonnie: How many years ago was Ian? You just can't let it go.",
        "Vienna: 'Cause I don't like a thief, and you're a thief! Whoa!",
        "Bonnie: No, no. He left willingly, just like the other men who tried to hook up with you.",
        "Vienna: Henry didn't leave me! Aah! Ow! That hurts!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Well, I never expected to see you here.",
        "Carly: I know. And I'm only here because Lily and Holden need you.",
        "Emma: I think you're the last person to talk about what Lily needs.",
        "Carly: Emma, I know how you feel about me, I do. Please, please come with me. Ethan is in trouble, and Lily and Holden could use your strength right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Trust me. I've been working in this soil. You're gonna need more than that to stabilize the situation.",
        "Man: Well, what would you suggest?",
        "Lily: You're gonna be out of there soon, Sweetie, and Mommy's gonna be right here with some cookies for you -- chocolate chip, your favorite. How much longer? It's getting cold, Holden. It's gonna be dark soon. He's gonna be scared.",
        "Katie: Lily, Holden. We just heard about Ethan. How you guys holding up?",
        "Holden: Guys, what's with the cameras?",
        "Katie: Kim sent us over from WOAK to cover the rescue. There's just so many people who care about you guys in this community that want to know what you're going through, be able to offer their support.",
        "Lily: I think we have all the support that we need right now. And besides, he's gonna be out of here any minute. There's no story.",
        "Katie: I'm sure you're right, Lily. Would you mind if we just stuck around to make sure he's safe?",
        "Brad: And we promise, we won't get in the way.",
        "Brad: There's Jack.",
        "Katie: Jack, hey.",
        "Jack: Katie, Brad.",
        "Katie: Kim sent us over to cover the rescue. Can you tell us what's been done so far?",
        "Jack: Dallas Griffin's in charge. I'm just here as a family member.",
        "Brad: So, what Janet was telling us is true.",
        "Katie: You resigned? Oh, Jack. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jack: No, don't be, don't be. Listen, you want a statement from the department, I'm sure Dallas will be willing to help you.",
        "Brad: You know, I don't get you, Jack. This whole business with Leo, it was finished. You know, no one had to know you were involved.",
        "Jack: I knew. I knew, Brad.",
        "Brad: Why couldn't you just let it go? I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate what you did, but you quitting a job that you're good at, who's that supposed to help?",
        "Jack: I don't owe you any explanations, okay? And there's other things for us to be worried about right now, so why don't you go get your story and leave me the hell alone?",
        "Janet: Jack, what can I do to help?",
        "Jack: Why don't you check in with Lily on that?",
        "Janet: Please, Jack, don't freeze me out. How many times can I say I'm sorry?",
        "Jack: Janet, I'm really busy right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Do they know if he's all right? He's not hurt, is he?",
        "Carly: Lily and Holden have been talking to him. He's been responding.",
        "Emma: Oh, Faith. Would you call the neighbors and tell them I'll be late picking up Natalie? And I won't be long. I'll be back. You stay here.",
        "Faith: I want to go with you.",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, that's not necessary.",
        "Faith: Why don't you want me there? Is it because you think Ethan's gonna die?",
        "Emma: Oh, no, no, Honey! It's be -- it's because --",
        "Carly: Faith, you know something? Ethan is gonna be just fine. No one is gonna let anything bad happen to him, okay?",
        "Faith: But it's my fault he got lost.",
        "Carly: No, no, it is not your fault. You are a wonderful sister. And as soon as he can, Ethan will tell you that himself.",
        "Faith: But he wanted to play with me, and I said no. I was paying attention to my friend on the phone and my project.",
        "Carly: Don't blame yourself, Honey.",
        "Faith: I could have at least gotten off to, like, read him a story or something.",
        "Carly: Hey, why don't you read to him now, huh? You can go grab a couple of his favorite books. You can read to him and let him know that his big sister is waiting for him to come back safe and sound, okay?",
        "Faith: I can do that.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Emma: Thank you, Carly. I think that was -- that was just what she needed to hear.",
        "Carly: I hope so.",
        "Emma: Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was so rude to you earlier.",
        "Carly: Emma, it's already forgotten.",

        "Mike: It is possible that the excavation may have caused some sort of sinkhole effect.",
        "Katie: Was it something in particular that set it off? Mike, was this just a tragic accident, or did something set it off?",
        "Meg: Mike, how are things going?",
        "Mike: Did you come back here?",
        "Paul: I'm standing right in front of you, Mike, so, yeah, I must have come back here.",
        "Mike: Paul, don't get cute with me. Did you come back here and keep digging after I told you to stop digging?",
        "Paul: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Mike: Ethan fell down that hole, and it's your fault, isn't it?",
        "Meg: Where are these accusations coming from?",
        "Paul: It's pretty obvious to me where they're coming from. Mike's been in charge of this whole work site since day one. As soon as there's an accident, he's trying to shift all the blame off himself and put it on me.",
        "Mike: Whoa! No. Paul was out here digging with a backhoe without clearance or authorization, and that is what created the sinkhole.",
        "Holden: Why would Paul start digging on his own?",
        "Mike: I don't know. I don't know why Paul does half the stuff he does.",
        "Paul: Let's just get Ethan out of the hole, okay? And then we'll have a full investigation. We'll figure out what really happened. Can you tell us what's going on?",
        "Holden: I think Mike can answer that question better than I can.",
        "Mike: You know, there are a lot of unknowns. We don't know how deep the hole is, but we need to form the rigging so that we can add extensions if we need to.",
        "Meg: Okay, and then you'll be able to get Ethan out, right?",
        "Mike: Yes. We will get Ethan out, but we need to plan for as many contingencies as possible because we don't know what we're gonna run into down there.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I can only imagine.",
        "Jack: Hey, what's all this?",
        "Janet: Billy, Tim, Vernon -- three of my best customers from Al's. They're here to help. And with them, they have enough sandwiches, pies, coffee to feed everybody, and there's more in my car. Guys, Jack Snyder. What he says, goes.",
        "Man: Sure thing, Janet. You're the boss.",
        "Man: What he said.",
        "Jack: I think Mike could use some help to set up the rigging.",
        "Janet: I'll go set up the buffet.",
        "Meg: Hey, I'm gonna see if there's anything I could do to help.",
        "Paul: Okay. But please don't tire yourself out.",
        "Meg: I am not leaving until they get Ethan out of there.",
        "Paul: All right. Let's hope they do that soon.",
        "Meg: They will get to him no matter what they have to do.",

        "James: No. No, no, no, no.",
        "Henry: Attaboy.",
        "James: You know, I was afraid -- I knew this would happen if I wasn't around -- Barbara would turn my son into a wimp! A mama's boy!",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's a shame. Children can be such a disappointment. I know my little sister, Maddie, she said she wanted to follow in my footsteps, and she used to read the racing forms with me and have little poker parties with her dolls. And one day, she up and said she wanted to be a writer, so I don't mind telling you, I was very hurt by that. I'm sure a psychotic like yourself, though, would have just let that pass.",

        "Bonnie: That's a waste of some perfectly good lipstick.",
        "Vienna: Well, it's not a waste if it keeps you away from me. The only way you and I are going to survive this torture is if you stay on your side and I stay on mine.",
        "Bonnie: Fine.",
        "Vienna: Fine!",

        "Lily: Please, everybody who's watching, please send us your good wishes and your prayers. Please pray for my little boy. I got to go.",
        "Faith: Mom.",
        "Lily: Faith, what are you doing here?",
        "Faith: Carly drove me and Grandma. I brought some books to read to Ethan, but I couldn't remember if he likes the one about the dinosaurs or about the fox better. Do you remember?",
        "Lily: I don't know which one --",
        "Carly: Why don't you bring them both over to Ethan? I'm sure Ethan would enjoy hearing either one.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",

        "Mike: All right, I think it'll hold. Fred, will you strap the harness to me?",
        "Holden: Oh, no you don't. It's my son down there. I'm the one who's going after him.",
        "Mike: This is a bad idea, Holden. We need to send someone down there with experience.",
        "Holden: Experience? What kind of experience do you have being lowered into a pit on a rope?",
        "Mike: If this is some kind of competition for Lily -- this isn't personal.",
        "Holden: No, it's my son down there. It doesn't get any more personal than that.",
        "Paul: If anybody's going down that hole, it's me. This project is my responsibility.",

        "Holden: He's right. You're not going down there because I am!",
        "Emma: Stop it! Please, please stop it! None of this is helping Ethan. If Holden wants to, I think he should. It's his son down there. He'll do the best he can. And after that, all we can do is pray. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.",
