        "\r\nMolly: I had the perfect gift for Jake for the wedding, and they don't want to \r\nsell it.",
        "\r\nDonna: Well, go buy him a silk smoking jacket. There's not a man alive that can \r\nresist a smoking jacket. Just kidding. Just kidding! Can you imagine Jake in a \r\nsmoking jacket?",
        "\r\nMolly: Not even under deep hypnosis, Donna.",
        "\r\nDonna: Oh, speaking of images, pictures and things, have you made an appointment \r\nwith your wedding photographer yet?",
        "\r\nMolly: No, not yet, I haven't.",
        "\r\nDonna: That's because your dress isn't ready, right?",
        "\r\nMolly: Right, because Carly's out of town. But I'm sure she's gonna have it any \r\nday now. I'm sure of it.",
        "\r\nDonna: And the dresses for the girls, you've gotten those?",
        "\r\nMolly: I had, yes, beautiful dresses, but they don't fit them anymore, and I \r\nhaven't had time to go get new ones yet.",
        "\r\nDonna: Any thoughts of eloping?",
        "\r\nMolly: About every five minutes. Yeah.",
        "\r\nDonna: Okay, put all those thoughts out of your mind right now, because weddings \r\nhave a way of coming together at the last moment, I promise.",
        "\r\nMolly: Then why does mine feel like it's falling apart? Here you go. Are you all \r\nright, Michele? Hey, Bridget, come over here. Donna, I thank you. This is so \r\nnice of you -- here you go, sweetie -- to help us out like this, because after \r\nfinding out that Mary is not the woman we thought she was, I couldn't -- I \r\ncouldn't stand to hire another nanny right now.",
        "\r\nDonna: Are you sure that you can trust me?",
        "\r\nMolly: Of course I can trust you.",
        "\r\nDonna: Then why don't you ever leave me alone with the children?",
        "\r\nMolly: I don't. I'm so -- you know, I don't even realize, I'm hovering, aren't \r\nI? I am. You know, I'm sorry. I don't want to make you think that I don't trust \r\nyou, because I do.",
        "\r\nDonna: From the moment I arrived here, you have hardly spent one moment at your \r\nwork, and I know you love your work. So if you're not worried about leaving the \r\ngirls alone with me, then what are you worried about?",
        "",
        "\r\nJake: So she leaves the house at the very last second. She goes to the studio, \r\nshe does her broadcast, she flies right home with her makeup still on, and I \r\nthink I know why.",
        "\r\nNick: It's my fault again, right, Jake?",
        "\r\nJake: You don't have a clue about getting along with me. Don't guess what I'm \r\nthinking.",
        "\r\nNick: Okay, all right, then tell me.",
        "\r\nJake: Okay, I'll tell you. I -- I want to thank you for scoping out who was \r\nbehind the phony wedding invitations. I mean, I would have never guessed it was \r\nthe nanny in a million years, and thanks to you, she's no longer close to my \r\nkids.",
        "\r\nNick: Well, there's no thanks required.",
        "\r\nJake: How about an apology?",
        "\r\nNick: For what?",
        "\r\nJake: Accusing you of doing it. It's not my M.O. to go around blaming innocent \r\npeople.",
        "\r\nNick: Well, look, you were protecting the woman you love.",
        "\r\nJake: I still -- I still am. So how have you and Molly been getting along since \r\nthe whole mug shot thing came to an end?",
        "\r\nNick: Well, as far as I'm concerned, we're fine. You know, she apologized. I \r\nsaid, \"don't worry about it,\" and we both agreed to just put it behind us.",
        "\r\nJake: I get the notion she's not comfortable with that yet.",
        "\r\nNick: That's why she's been making herself really scarce around here, right? \r\nWell, is there something that I can do to help?",
        "\r\nJake: You know, it's funny you should ask that.",

        "\r\nMatthew: This way, folks.",

        "\r\nEmma: What is this? What is this, Rose? Is it about Lily?",
        "\r\nRose: Yes and no.",
        "\r\nJoe: Is she all right?",
        "\r\nRose: Well, you could say that.",
        "\r\nEmma: Now you're making me nervous. What's this all about?",
        "\r\nRose: Sit down, please. Just -- come on. Lily found Holden and Luke.",
        "\r\nEmma: What?",
        "\r\nRose: They're alive. Your son and your grandson, they're alive!",

        "\r\nRose: No, no, no, Lucinda came back from Malta. Lily is with Holden right now at \r\nthis very minute. They're together.",
        "\r\nEmma: Holden. Holden's with Lily? Is he all right?",
        "\r\nRose: As far as I know, yes. He's fine. He's as good as new.",

        "\r\nBarbara: Well, good -- morning. You're -- you're up fairly early, aren't you?",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, and so are you. What time did you clock in today?",
        "\r\nBarbara: Oh, 5:00. I had a concept for a cocktail dress that was nudging me wide \r\nawake.",
        "\r\nPaul: Well, just as long as you don't wear yourself out. You got a big couple of \r\ndays coming up, Mom.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Don't remind me.",
        "\r\nPaul: Look, I know you're not looking forward to going back to the hospital, and \r\nI don't blame you, but these skin graft tests are very important to your \r\nrecovery.",
        "\r\nBarbara: I understand that. It's just that this spring line is the most \r\nimportant thing I've ever done, and I don't want to stop working on it.",
        "\r\nPaul: And I promise you it will not be a total loss. While you're in the \r\nhospital, I'll start preparing for the November show in New York. You know, as a \r\nmatter of fact, if you can give me a sketch right now, I can use it to get the \r\npeople excited.",
        "\r\nBarbara: I know that's how we've always done things in the past, Paul. I just \r\nthink that this time, I'd like to reveal everything all at once.",
        "\r\nPaul: You know, but it could really help me get some buzz started. You know, \r\nperception's half the battle.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Well, I think you need to tell the Press that they'll have to just wait \r\n-- wait and wield the suspense.",
        "\r\nPaul: One outfit? One dress? All I want is something hot, you know?",
        "\r\nBarbara: Nope. This entire line will be hot! I've done it before, and I will do \r\nit again.",
        "\r\nPaul: And I know, and that's what I want the people to see.",

        "\r\nEmily: So? Come on, does The Intruder have a new fashion reporter? Did Carly say \r\nyes?",
        "\r\nHal: Did you hear that, Parker? That's a perfect example of how not to start a \r\nconversation.",
        "\r\nEmily: Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Good morning, Hal. Good morning, Parker. \r\nHave you checked the sky? It looks like there could be rain. Now, what happened \r\nwith Carly?",
        "\r\nHal: Carly's coming back from Chicago early today.",
        "\r\nEmily: What, she said yes, she's gonna take the job?",
        "\r\nHal: I didn't mention it to her.",
        "\r\nEmily: Why not?",

        "\r\nHal: I'm very much aware of that. But if there's any chance she's going to take \r\nthis job, she's gonna have to get past that, isn't she?",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, but right up front? I mean, I thought we could, you know, ease into \r\nit gradually. And I thought -- no, I thought you could ease into it gradually. \r\nYou agreed to take on this assignment. You call -- you call me when it's --",

        "\r\nHal: Carly, don't agitate.",
        "\r\nCarly: You know, I'm sorry. You're right. Broadcasting the intimate details of \r\npeople's private lives -- now, that would be Emily's job, right?",
        "\r\nEmily: You are awfully feisty this morning, aren't you? Chicago must be your \r\nkind of town.",
        "\r\nCarly: It will be.",
        "\r\nHal: Are you convinced you're gonna move there?",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, yeah. More than ever, Hal. Chicago is a fantastic city with so many \r\nopportunities for me.",
        "\r\nHal: Yeah? Well, you know, there are opportunities here, too. I mean, if you're \r\nopen to look at them.",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh, no, please. The only breaks I'm gonna get around here are the kind \r\nthat require a cast.",
        "\r\nHal: Yeah, but plenty of things can change really quickly. As a matter of fact, \r\nfor example, Emily was just telling me that The Intruder is looking for a \r\nfashion reporter.",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh, is that right?",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah.",
        "\r\nCarly: Why is that? Do Martians wear clothes now?",
        "\r\nEmily: No, actually, Carly, I am in the process of expanding my lifestyle \r\nsection, and fashion will naturally be a part of that.",
        "\r\nHal: Say, you know fashion. Why don't you apply for the job?",
        "\r\nCarly: I'm a designer, Hal. I'm not a reporter. Besides which, I just told you \r\n-- I'm moving.",
        "\r\nHal: Yeah, but, I mean, wouldn't this avoid a lot of chaos? And Parker wouldn't \r\nhave to go through all that. I mean, you said you wanted to start over. Wouldn't \r\nthis be an easier way?",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, but you know, it's more than that, really. You would be perfect for \r\nthe job.",
        "\r\nCarly: I would?",
        "\r\nEmily: Mm-hmm. Because high fashion can be very intimidating to the average \r\nwoman. And, you know, now that I think about it, having, you know, a local \r\ndesigner write the column, it would make fashion that much more accessible.",
        "\r\nCarly: Wait a minute. Are you telling me you would actually want to hire me?",
        "\r\nEmily: Look, I never let my personal feelings interfere with business.",

        "\r\nPaul: Mom, I understand.",

        "\r\nPaul: Mom, when I look at that man, all I see is how he's cheated you out of \r\neverything you've ever cared about. I mean, he married you for every wrong \r\nreason there is, and when he finished, he ended up with a fistful of stock \r\ncertificates, and you ended up in a coma. I'm just trying to even things up \r\nhere.",

Maybe if I \r\nexplain to you guys exactly what's going on, okay? Got a little story for you. \r\nMommy and Daddy are getting married in two weeks, and that is not going to \r\nhappen if I don't have a lot of work accomplished. I have to okay invitations \r\nand seating charts, and Mommy and Daddy have to come up with a song, a song to \r\ndance to for our first dance as husband and wife.
