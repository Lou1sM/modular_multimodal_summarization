        "Dr. Ramirez: Not a problem. Just get better soon, all right? My wife already said that if I'm not careful, she's gonna run off with another man.",
        "Ben: Well, wouldn't want to break up a happy marriage.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Oh, please, it'll never happen, man.",
        "Ben: It can happen. You'd be surprised. Go down to the hospital pharmacy, and get this prescription filled for Henry Coleman.",
        "Nikki: What about medication or anything like that?",
        "Ben: What I did is I wrote down a couple of over-the-counter headache remedies. He won't need a prescription.",
        "Jessica: Ben? Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.",
        "Ben: You never mean for anything to happen, do you, Jess? It just happens out of your control.",

        "Ben: He's a patient.",
        "Jessica: It's pain medication. What's going on?",
        "Ben: He's a patient! It doesn't have anything to do with you. Nothing in my life has anything to do with you anymore.",
        "Henry: Strong and yet soft.",
        "Mike: Why, Henry, I didn't know you cared.",
        "Henry: I'm talking to Nikki.",
        "Nikki: How's the head, Coleman?",

        "Nikki: Dr. Harris said you needed to stay awake.",
        "Henry: Dr. Harris went to Paris in a puddle of rain. Oh! I need a nap.",
        "Mike: That's exactly what you don't need. Ben said no napping.",
        "Henry: No, but I'm sleepy. Gin always makes me tired.",

        "Henry: Only a couple.",

        "Hal: Get security, Paul.",
        "Paul: I'd love to. Security! Hey. My mother's Barbara Ryan. She's a patient here, and I was told that she would be kept far away from my brother, Will, who's also a patient here. But my mother just found a way into my brother's room.",
        "Guard: Who's your brother's doctor?",
        "Paul: Dr. Walters.",
        "Guard: I'll have to bring her down here.",
        "Paul: I'm coming with you.",

        "Jennifer: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Will: I should have expected this.",

        "Julia: No. J.J., No, you cannot stay up and watch \"The creature feature.\" You know you have nightmares from it. Yeah, listen, Buster Keaton, you need to go to bed. Okay? Okay, I will. I love you, too. Bye. J.J. says good night.",
        "Jack: I could have gotten on the phone.",
        "Julia: Yeah. You know what? It's way too late. It's past his bedtime. He wants to stay up and watch the show, \"The creature feature.\" It's one of our local stations. They play these old scary movies --",
        "Jack: Really? You know, I seem to remember, I like old, scary movies with popcorn.",
        "Julia: I'll make you some. First, I have to go check the downspout. I don't want it to blow away from the house.",
        "Jack: No, you don't. I fixed it, remember?",
        "Julia: You did.",
        "Jack: I did.",
        "Julia: That's right. Do you think that maybe you were a handyman or --",
        "Jack: I have no idea.",
        "Julia: Repairman.",
        "Jack: No, I don't know. I seem to be pretty good with my hands.",
        "Julia: You're better than pretty good.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Julia: Yeah. I'm gonna go make the popcorn.",
        "Jack: No, stay.",
        "Julia: No, it'll just take a minute.",
        "Jack: So will this.",

        "Parker: Aren't we going to finish the story for Sage?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, honey, we will. It's just that that story gave me an idea.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: You know how the prince had to go to all the different houses to find the girl who fit the slipper?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Well, that's what were going to do. We're going to go to all different houses to find Jack. But lucky for us, we have a way to cover a lot more ground than they did in the old days.",
        "Parker: It's too late.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't, honey. No, it's not too late. You want to know why? 'Cause I won't let it be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Could you please explain something to me? Could you please explain to me how she got her hands on a nurse's outfit?",
        "Barbara: Just let me go.",
        "Dr. Walters: I'm sorry about this, Lieutenant.",
        "Barbara: Who are you?",
        "Dr. Walters: I'm the doctor handling your son's case, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Hal: It's a good thing you're a doctor, because if you were a cop, I'd have your badge.",
        "Paul: We were told that she would not go anywhere near Will.",
        "Barbara: \"She\"? I am your mother, Paul.",
        "Dr. Walters: Is Will okay?",
        "Hal: How can he be okay? His mother just broke into his room.",
        "Barbara: I have every right to see him.",
        "Dr. Walters: I'll get to the bottom of this.",
        "Barbara: Doctor, this is my fault. I was desperate to see my son, so I took a chance. But only because all of you have backed me into a corner. I had no choice.",
        "Dr. Walters: Take her away.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, you won't keep me from will. You won't. It's wrong. It's against nature.",
        "Guard: Dr. Walters.",
        "Dr. Walters: He'll need help subduing her.",
        "Barbara: You won't keep me from Will, Hal! No one can! Not you! Not the courts! No one!",
        "Paul: She's not kidding, Hal. As long as she's breathing, she's a threat to Will.",
        "Hal: Well, then, we'll just have to find a way to put an end to that threat.",
        "Paul: But how, Hal? How do we get rid of her?",
        "Hal: By getting rid of Will. He can't be in the same building as Barbara. I want him out of this place. Now, even the courts have to see that has to happen.",
        "Paul: Can we file a petition tonight?",
        "Hal: Well, it's probably too late for that, but I'll be on it first thing in the morning.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. Where's Mom?",
        "Hal: Oh, Dr. Walters took her some place. Some place with a padlock, I hope.",
        "Jennifer: If Mom wants to get to Will, she'll be able to do that. She's proven that already. He's not safe here.",
        "Hal: Paul and I were just saying the same thing.",
        "Paul: You know, I'm going to call Jessica. I mean, she's already up to speed. She knows that Mom's been committed. She knows what a threat she poses to Will.",
        "Hal: Go for it.",
        "Jennifer: Go for what?",
        "Paul: Hal and I were just talking about getting Will out of here, as soon as possible.",
        "Jennifer: That's great.",
        "Hal: Well, it's just an idea, Jen. Getting a judge to sign on is going to be tough.",
        "Jennifer: Well, what do you think our chances are?",
        "Hal: Well, I would've said slim to none this afternoon.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but now that Barbara's proved that she's going to continue to go after Will, maybe the courts will be more lenient.",
        "Dr. Walters: We're going to have to sedate your mother. She's having outbursts of violent behavior and can't be reasoned with at this point.",
        "Jennifer: You know, could I talk to her first, please? I promise, I won't upset her.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa. No, Jen, don't. She's just going to play on your sympathy, just like she always does.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, don't worry, Paul. I'll never fall that \"poor me\" routine ever again.",
        "Barbara: Jen. Help me. Please, help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What happens to you will always be my business, Ben. No matter what my mistakes were, I will always care about you.",
        "Ben: So, is that what you came to tell me? That you will always care about me?",
        "Jessica: I brought your mail. Some of it is still coming to the house. The one on top is from your insurance company, so I thought you might need it.",
        "Ben: I'll call the post office. I don't want to trouble you with anything anymore.",
        "Jessica: It's not trouble. I mean, really, I don't mind.",
        "Ben: Look, let me be clear. Next time you need to bring me something, leave it with my assistant.",
        "Jessica: Ben, please. I mean, can't we -- can't we even just talk to each other anymore?",
        "Ben: Do you think I want to talk to you? Why in the world would I want to talk to you?",
        "Jessica: So we can try and understand what happened.",
        "Ben: So, you tell me. Tell me, why do you cheat on a man who loves you completely, who was always honest with you? You can't even understand it yourself.",
        "Jessica: No, I can't. So I think maybe if we talk about it -- I mean, obviously, there was some underlying problem that I --",
        "Ben: Well, the problem was you.",
        "Jessica: Okay, it was me. And I am willing to work on it, I swear. I mean, I will do anything to give us another chance.",
        "Ben: I don't want another chance. I don't even want to know you anymore.",
        "Jessica: Ben, please, stop. Look, this isn't you. This angry, bitter man -- this isn't you.",
        "Ben: No, that's where you're wrong. 'Cause this is all that's left.",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Ben: Yes. You don't like the new Ben Harris? Too bad, you made him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Do you know what I like?",
        "Jack: I think I have an idea.",
        "Julia: I like feeling safe, Jack. I see it in J.J., too. We're both breathing so much easier now that you're here.",
        "Jack: That mean I can stick around for awhile?",
        "Julia: You can stay as long as you want, kid. I hope you'll stay for a long time. You know?",
        "Jack: What -- what are you doing? What's going on with you?",
        "Julia: I don't know. I just -- I'm sorry, I keep bothering you with the same stupid questions.",
        "Jack: No, don't apologize. Just tell me what you're thinking about.",
        "Julia: I just don't want to open the door, Jack, and find the other Julia standing there, demanding her husband back.",
        "Jack: Ex-husband. Ex-husband. And why would she want me back when she hated me enough to try to kill me? You have nothing to fear from that woman. So what else are you afraid of?",
        "Julia: Maybe I'm afraid this isn't real.",
        "Jack: Feel. It's real. I'm real. I'm here. And I'm here to stay.",
        "Julia: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hmm.",
        "Julia: Promise me.",
        "Jack: Oh, try getting rid of me. Julia, this place, it feels -- you and J.J., you feel like home.",
        "Julia: Yeah?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Julia: What exactly does home feel like?",
        "Jack: Oh, feels good. Perfect. I'm like that stray dog you fed scraps to. I know a good thing when I see one.",
        "Julia: If you're a stray dog, then you better get off my couch.",
        "Jack: Oh, never.",

        "Kim: Okay. Hi, darling.",
        "Carly: Oh, thank you so much for doing this.",
        "Kim: Oh, you're so welcome. You don't really need to thank me at all. Hi, Parker. If you think there's any chance at all that Jack is alive, I'd do anything in the world to help bring him home.",
        "Carly: Did you talk to the other stations in the area?",
        "Kim: I did. I did.",
        "Carly: What did they say?",
        "Kim: They said they're going to pick up our feed and broadcast live with us. That means that every station with 500-mile radius around here is going to carry your message.",
        "Carly: That's wonderful. I just hope it works. You know, if the accident did affect Jack's memory, then hearing the name Jack Snyder isn't going to have any affect on him at all.",
        "Kim: We don't need to rely on his name recognition. We can carry his picture. If anybody's seen him, they'll call immediately, I'm sure.",
        "Carly: From your mouth to God's ears. And then we'll get in the car, and we'll bring jack home.",
        "Kim: You bet. And that's exactly what we're all praying for.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, let's get a mic on me. It's time to find Jack.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: How are you feeling, son?",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Hal: Will, this is me. You don't have to pretend. We both know that having your mother barge in here tonight was scary as hell. Now, you don't have to make excuses for her behavior, Will.",
        "Will: I'm not, Dad. I swear.",
        "Hal: Are you sure? 'Cause in the past, you always felt like you had to protect your mom.",
        "Will: Well, being in here has taught me something.",
        "Hal: What is that?",
        "Will: She was supposed to protect me, you know? Not try to show me how bad her life was, not try to get me to fix it.",
        "Hal: That's right.",
        "Will: You know, she made me do a lot of bad things in life to prove how much I love her. I don't belong here, Dad. She does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Is it really necessary for my mother to be restrained like this?",
        "Guard: She wouldn't stop fighting me.",
        "Dr. Walters: I'm sorry, but yes, it is necessary.",
        "Barbara: Of course I fought. He wouldn't let me see my baby boy. Honey, tell Dr. Walters, that I'm not afraid to fight for my children.",
        "Jennifer: First, I think we need to talk. Can we have a minute, please?",
        "Dr. Walters: Only for a minute, because as I said, she needs sedation. We'll be right outside.",
        "Barbara: Did you hear that? They just want to shut me up. That's what they do around here. That's how they treat you. They want to turn you into a vegetable, and they don't have to deal with you anymore. They want to throw you into a corner and let you wither up and die. Don't let them do that to me, please, Jen. Please, honey. Will has to see that I'm okay, otherwise he'll be worried sick. He needs me.",
        "Jennifer: No, he doesn't, Mother. He has been making real progress.",
        "Barbara: Yes, he has. Since I've been in here, I've been able to see him. I've been able to communicate with him.",
        "Jennifer: What? You had no right, Mother. The court said --",
        "Barbara: The courts can't tell me how to be a mother.",
        "Jennifer: You destroyed Will's childhood, Mother. But then, that doesn't matter to you, does it? Nothing matters to you except getting your own way. That little visit in there with Will could have could have flipped him into a tailspin!",
        "Barbara: No, honey, you're wrong. He was excited. He was happy to see me.",
        "Jennifer: He was terrified!",
        "Barbara: If he was terrified, why did he come to my room? Why did he bring me a nurse's uniform? Why did he tell me to meet him?",
        "Jennifer: You really are insane.",
        "Barbara: I'm as sane as you are. Now, get me out of this thing.",
        "Jennifer: Are you kidding? I'm gonna order you one in every color. And when Dr. Walters comes in here to sedate you, I will personally make sure that she gives you plenty, Mom. Because you are never getting near my little brother again!",
        "Barbara: Backstabber. You're just like Paul.",
        "Jennifer: No. If I were just like Paul, then I would have seen the truth about you a long time ago.",
        "Barbara: And here I thought you were the one person in the world I could always turn to.",
        "Jennifer: I was. To my everlasting shame, I was! I stuck by you while I watched you ruin Paul's life, and then Will's, and then Rosanna's and Jordan's! Oakdale is littered with lives that you have wrecked!",
        "Barbara: Don't you dare walk out on me!",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I'm walking out this door and I will never turn back.",
        "Barbara: Jen! Jen, don't walk out on -- Jen!",
        "Jennifer: Go ahead, give it to her. Give her all of it, and then some.",
        "Barbara: I'm still your mother!",
        "Paul: Hey, Jen. You okay?",
        "Jennifer: I will be, as soon as I get out of here.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa. Where you going?",
        "Barbara: I will always be your mother!",

        "Ben: Don't even try to talk to me about my life. I already told you, my life has nothing to do with you.",
        "Jessica: Okay, it's gonna take some time. Okay, if you need time, you need some space, I'll give you anything you want.",
        "Ben: Really? 'Cause there's only one thing I want from you, Jessica. A divorce. [Cell phone rings] Go ahead, answer it. We're done.",
        "Jessica: Hello?",

        "Jack: Let me tell you something. When I left the hospital, I felt like I didn't need anybody either. And I found myself on that park bench, not being able to get you out of my head. Every time I closed my eyes, there you were. And I felt like finally somebody cared whether I lived or died.",
        "Julia: I did care -- I do -- because from the minute I met you, I felt like we'd known each other before.",

His car went off a bridge on Route 17, just outside of Oakdale, Illinois. His body was never recovered, and now -- well, we think that he is still alive and may be suffering from amnesia. So, I'm begging you, please, pay more attention to strangers in your area. And if you see this man --",
