Paul and Emily later have a very touching wedding ceremony before a justice of the peace.",
        "Margo persuades Tom to defend Adam in his trial because she doesn't want him to plead guilty to the charges against him. Casey is angry that Adam always gets what he wants no matter who gets hurt. Adam tells Casey and Alison about when Gwen and Maddie buried him in the ground and left him to die but insists that neither of them tell anyone about the incident because he doesn't want to cause Gwen and Maddie anymore pain. Alison thinks that what Maddie and Gwen did to Adam was horrible and thinks that Casey should talk to Maddie or Gwen and hear their side of the story. Casey thinks that Adam deserved whatever Maddie and Gwen did to him and he is annoyed because Alison is taking Adam's side just like everyone else."

        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Adam: Hey, yourself. I would get up to give you a hug, but, um --",
        "Margo: Well, I think I can fix that. Here. So, um, how you doing?",
        "Adam: Fine, fine. How are you? How you holding up?",
        "Margo: You know, you don't have to even deal with that. I'm fine.",
        "Adam: How are Dad and Casey?",
        "Margo: Um, your father is trying really hard to accept everything that's happened.",
        "Adam: But not succeeding.",
        "Margo: Well, he's doing a whole lot better than Casey is, but you know what? Sooner or later, we're gonna work this all out. We will. We have to. So, what's going on? What did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Adam: I've made a decision.",
        "Margo: Really? I don't know if I like the sound of that.",
        "Adam: I'm gonna plead guilty to all charges.",
        "Margo: No. Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know this is really last-minute. I mean, I just found out about it myself, and then I totally understand if you don't want to go, but Emily is kind of throwing a cocktail party at Metro for her engagement to Paul, and I was kind of hoping you'd be my date.",
        "Casey: Of course.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: It wouldn't be too weird for you?",
        "Casey: I mean, I am dating my ex-wife's sister, who happens to be her daughter, so if I can handle that, I think I could handle this party.",
        "Alison: That's a good point.",
        "Tom: Hey!",
        "Casey: Dad.",
        "Alison: Mr. Hughes.",
        "Tom: Hey, guys. Uh, Case, I need to talk to you.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Right. Uh, okay, so, why don't I just meet you at Metro later?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Just text me, and be specific of what I need to wear.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Casey: Okay?",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Casey: Bye. So, uh, what's Adam done now?",
        "Tom: It's nothing like that. I just didn't want you to be surprised.",
        "Casey: By what?",
        "Tom: Well, your mom and I have made a decision, so, as far as Adam's concerned, we are both on the same side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lily. I was worried about you. I came by the house to see how you were doing, but Luke wouldn't let me in.",
        "Lily: He told me.",
        "Damian: I thought it best not to pressure him to change his mind for both your sakes.",
        "Lily: Thank you for that.",
        "Damian: I can't stop thinking about you. How are you? Were you able to get through to Faith and Luke?",
        "Lily: Luke is doing his best to understand, but I can see the accusation in his eyes, which is a step up from Faith, because she won't even look at me.",
        "Damian: They'll get over it. They just need some time.",
        "Lily: They don't need time, Damian. They need me to fix this.",
        "Damian: There's nothing for you to fix.",
        "Lily: How can you say that? We made a terrible mistake.",
        "Damian: We slept together. We needed each other. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not a crime.",
        "Lily: It is to them, and I can't take it back. But I can make sure it never happens again.",
        "Damian: You don't mean that.",
        "Lily: I do, Damian. I came here to ask you to stay away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey. I thought you were on your way out of town.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call first. I came to get Eliza.",
        "Paul: Um, why?",
        "Meg: Um, I can't explain right now. May I? Come here, Sweetie. Oh, come here. Mommy missed you so much.",
        "Paul: What happened to your out-of-town getaway with Damian?",
        "Meg: Uh, plans changed.",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm fine. I just need my daughter.",
        "Emily: But what happened? I thought you were gonna let Paul spend time with her.",
        "Meg: Some other time, I promise. I'm sorry. I just need to get her home.",
        "Emily: Go. You want to find out what's wrong.",
        "Paul: Well, you know, she's not usually like that, you know? There's got to be something bad.",
        "Emily: Just go. It's okay.",
        "Paul: Okay. See you at Metro.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Don't fight me on this.",
        "Damian: Lily, listen, I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I think you're being too hasty.",
        "Lily: No. What we did was hasty. This is me coming to my senses.",
        "Damian: Look, Faith walking in on us was unfortunate, but it's not like you were cheating on Holden.",
        "Lily: Maybe not, okay, but we can't expect my children to just get over it because we asked them to.",
        "Damian: But they will get over it, if they see that we can be good for each other.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Damian: Go away!",
        "Lucinda: No, not on your life. It's me. Open the door, Damian. I'm not gonna budge until you do.",
        "Lily: She means it.",
        "Damian: All right. I'll handle your mother. Lucinda, this is not a good time.",
        "Lucinda: I disagree completely. It's perfect timing. And you -- you're coming with me right now.",
        "Lily: Don't.",
        "Damian: Lucinda, you're out of line. And you have no right to barge in here.",
        "Lucinda: Well, what right did you have to crash-land in my daughter's life and destroy her family?",
        "Damian: I have done nothing of the kind.",
        "Lucinda: I know all about it.",
        "Lily: You know nothing, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: I know how Damian used your son to insinuate his way back into your life and back into your bed!",
        "Damian: I know Luciano thinks that now, but it's not true, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: What you need, Darling, is a change of scene, and I can arrange it. We can do that. We can go away together.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Lucinda: As a matter of fact, I think that would be good for all of us, maybe around the world on a plane or maybe a ship.",
        "Lily: You think I would leave my children and go away with you?",
        "Lucinda: Well, they can come, too.",
        "Lily: What about school?",
        "Lucinda: We'll get them tutors. I mean, they'll learn more from life than from school anyway, and, Darling, once you have your brood all together, like, on a ship, then you can relax and start to mend.",
        "Lily: You can't fix problems by running away!",
        "Lucinda: Dear, is this -- is this fixing anything? Wasn't it bad enough we you lost Holden? And now Damian has caused this rift. Come on. Drastic times call for drastic measures. With any luck, my friend in the state department can get you deported.",
        "Lily: Are you insane?",
        "Lucinda: Are you insane? Are you insane, Darling, throwing everything away just for a dalliance? And, you, wasn't that convenient that Holden happened to die when you came to town? Or did one of your many criminal minions arrange that, too?",
        "Lily: What a horrible thing to say!",
        "Lucinda: What a horrible thing to do! And I don't hear Damian denying it.",
        "Damian: It doesn't matter what I say, Lucinda. You seem determined to think the worst of me.",
        "Lucinda: Unfortunately, it's usually true.",
        "Lily: All right, all right. Just stop it, okay? Enough. I will not have you blame Damian for something that I'm equally guilty for.",
        "Lucinda: Well, Dear, how long are you going to continue to flaunt this attachment in front of the kids?",
        "Lily: My personal life is my business, Mother, not yours.",
        "Damian: Lily's a grown woman, Lucinda. You can't tell her what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul.",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: You ask me that after you storm in to my house and grab Eliza and then rush back out?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take her from you like that. If you call me later, then we can set up another day.",
        "Paul: I'm not worried about Eliza. I'm worried about you. You all right? Something happened. Did something happen with Damian? What?",
        "Meg: You know, it was nothing that I shouldn't have seen coming. In fact, I did see it coming. That was the worst part.",
        "Paul: What did you see coming?",
        "Meg: He slept with Lily.",
        "Paul: Are you sure?",
        "Meg: Of course I'm sure! Do you think I want to believe that he would do this to me, that Lily could do this to Holden's memory? That --",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.",
        "Paul: It's fine. You're not dumping anything on me.",
        "Meg: You know, how could Damian do this to me? I mean, he took what we had and, you know -- this is crazy. You're the last person I should be telling this to.",
        "Paul: Why? I'm here. I'm happy to try and help.",
        "Meg: Because you're my ex-husband, Paul. I can't be crying on your shoulder about how the man I love has betrayed me.",
        "Paul: The man you love.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I thought he loved me, too. Okay, okay. Is there something you want to ask me?",
        "Paul: All right. Look, you and Damian, you got really close right after Holden's death, correct?",
        "Meg: We were seeing each other before that.",
        "Paul: You were seeing each other, but that's not -- you know, is that love?",
        "Meg: He helped me through one of the worst times in my life. I don't think it's that surprising that I fell in love with him after that.",
        "Paul: So, you were grateful, but that's not the same thing, is it?",
        "Meg: Well, I'll admit it's not what you and I had together.",
        "Paul: Right. When I wasn't acting like a lunatic and trying to push you away.",
        "Meg: I don't know. I just feel like nothing has been the same since Holden died, and half the time, I don't even know what I feel about anything.",
        "Paul: You're right. This is crazy, and I am probably the last person in the world to give anyone advice, but maybe what you should do is take a deep breath and just stand back, and when it all clears, I'm sure you'll see that Damian Grimaldi is not the answer for you.",
        "Meg: And who is, Paul? You?",
        "Paul: Oh, God, no! You deserve much better than either one of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Uh, thank you, but we are gonna need more champagne than this. I think there's another case in the back. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Emily: Alison! Oh, my word! Am I running that late already?",
        "Alison: No, relax. I'm early. I just wanted to see if there's anything I could do to help.",
        "Emily: No, no. Got everything under control. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Are you sure?",
        "Emily: Sure, I'm sure. Sure, I'm sure. It's gonna be a great engagement party for a great engagement.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, shouldn't your fianc\u00e9 be here celebrating with you?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Well, he, um, uh -- Meg stopped by Fairwinds a little earlier. She was upset when she came to pick up Eliza, so he needed to go talk to her.",
        "Alison: And you're okay with that.",
        "Emily: Sure, I'm okay with it. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Maybe because your fianc\u00e9 is spending time with his ex instead of you?",
        "Emily: No, look, she was upset, and he needed to go talk to her. It's -- they share a child together, okay? He needed to find out what was wrong.",
        "Alison: And he couldn't hold off on that until after his own engagement party?",
        "Emily: Alison, will you listen to me, okay? She's the mother of their child, okay? He's concerned about her. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Maybe now that the running and the lying is over, Adam Munson may someday turn into someone you can actually be proud of.",
        "Margo: Well, doing time in a federal prison is nothing to be proud -- in there with all those repeat offenders, those lowlifes, with an ax to grind? I mean, God knows who you'd be when you came out of there, what you'd be when you came out of there, but I know that it would kill me to see you in there. So stop it, Adam, please.",
        "Adam: Mom, there are things that I've done that you don't even know about.",
        "Margo: Well, if you're not being charged with them, then why bring them up?",
        "Adam: Because I think it's important to know.",
        "Margo: It is important to know that you don't spend any more time than it is absolutely necessary behind bars. Adam, for God's sakes, if you're not gonna fight for yourself, then I will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What happened? How did Adam get to you, too?",
        "Tom: That's really not what happened. Look, I feel as bad about what happened to Adam as you do. That was probably even worse because I was the one that was kept in the dark the whole time.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I hate that that happened. I promised Mom, though. So --",
        "Tom: Yeah, I know, and I don't blame you, and I can't blame your mom. Now, Adam is facing some serious hard time, and I really don't know what this is gonna do to your mother.",
        "Casey: You act like it's a done deal. You don't think he's gonna get off, do you?",
        "Tom: Um, I seriously don't think so, but we still have to help your mom get through this.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I'll try, but I don't think I'm ever gonna feel the same way about Adam again.",
        "Tom: And I don't expect you to because I'm not sure that I can feel differently about him either. But not to worry, I don't think your mom expects us to change our feelings about Adam anytime soon. Hey. Thought you were at work.",
        "Margo: Uh, yeah, I was.",
        "Casey: What's wrong?",
        "Margo: Tom, Adam is about to make a bad situation worse, and you are the only one who can stop him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mother, I am not taking my children out of school to go on a world cruise, all right? Their lives have been thrown in to enough chaos.",
        "Lucinda: If you don't like the cruise idea, well, think of something else.",
        "Lily: No, no, we are not going to make any decisions about my life. Do you understand that? End of discussion. Stay out of it!",
        "Damian: You heard what Lily said.",
        "Lucinda: This is far from over.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry you had to go through that.",
        "Lily: Thank you for standing up for me.",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Lily: The worst part about it is my mother is right. I've caused my family a lot of pain at the worst possible time. My children have lost their father. They need me to be their mother. They need me to put them first.",
        "Damian: Of course they do. And that's only one reason why we have to be more cautious.",
        "Lily: No, Damian. We need to stop seeing each other. I'm not asking you to disappear. As angry as Luke is at the both of us, you're still his father, his only father.",
        "Damian: Cara --",
        "Lily: At some point, Luke is gonna need you again, and I would never want to come between the two of you. But you and I can't continue.",
        "Damian: Lily, we can't ignore what we mean to each other.",
        "Lily: We have to. Maybe someday my children will understand and they'll forgive us, but for right now, you need to stay away from my house. Don't try to see me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Lucinda. If you're looking for my mother, she's still at Seth's. I can give you the number there.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, no, Darling. I'm not looking for your mother. No, no. It's you I want to see.",
        "Meg: What about?",
        "Lucinda: Don't be coy. Don't pretend you don't know about the developments between Lily and Damian. I thought as much. Well, are you gonna hang out here and mope or are you gonna go fight and get your man?",
        "Meg: He doesn't seem to be my man anymore.",
        "Lucinda: Lily and Damian are a catastrophe. You and Damian, however, are sort of a charming possibility.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? And you would know that how?",
        "Lucinda: So, are you gonna get going, get moving, and get your man back?",
        "Meg: Okay. What's going on here, Lucinda? Because you don't really care about me or who I love. You just want Damian away from Lily.",
        "Lucinda: Of course. Of course I do. That puts us on the same side. It's not bad being on my side. Now, the Meg Snyder of yore would have done anything to get what she wanted.",
        "Meg: That was a long time ago.",
        "Lucinda: Are you saying that you've lost your edge?",
        "Meg: I'm saying that I deserve better than the way Damian treated me.",
        "Lucinda: Of course you do! That's why you have to get him back, teach him some manners, educate him, and it's difficult to do that with a man, you know, who's going after somebody else.",
        "Meg: Well, what if I think that Damian's not worth the trouble?",
        "Lucinda: Don't kid a kidder, Honey. You want him as much as you ever did, but the question is, are you willing to put your money where your mouth is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I can't believe that you're asking me to take this case, because you know how I feel about what Adam did.",
        "Margo: Fine. Then how do you feel about me?",
        "Tom: Oh, don't play that card. Don't.",
        "Margo: No, no. I will do anything I need. If you won't do this for Adam, then do it for me. Tom, please, do this for me.",
        "Casey: I don't believe it! He doesn't give a damn about any of us! Can't you see that?",
        "Margo: Casey, please. Just stay out of this.",
        "Casey: Fine. Whatever.",
        "Margo: This is between your father and me.",
        "Casey: I'm out, okay?",
        "Margo: Tom, please. I have never needed you more than I need you right now. Please say \"Yes.\" Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay. I'll see you.",
        "Paul: I know I'm a little late, but --",
        "Emily: It doesn't matter.",
        "Paul: Looks like I'm not the only one. Where is everybody?",
        "Emily: Not here.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Emily: Because I called them and I told them not to come.",
        "Paul: Why would you do that?",
        "Emily: Because there's no point in having an engagement party if there isn't gonna be a wedding.",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: The wedding's off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: Can we please do this another time?",
        "Meg: No. We've waited too long as it is.",
        "Lily: If you came here for an apology --",
        "Meg: You know, that's just so typical. You do what you want, the hell with who gets hurt, and then you say \"I'm sorry,\" and you expect instant forgiveness.",
        "Lily: I know what happened with Damian was --",
        "Meg: You know what? It's not entirely your fault. I understand that, Lily, 'cause people always let you get away with it, didn't they? I mean, Holden did, didn't he?",
        "Lily: Don't bring Holden into this.",
        "Meg: Why not? Holden used to live here. You sleep with Damian in Holden's bed.",
        "Lily: Stop it! Damian and I, it just happened!",
        "Meg: Yeah. I don't buy that. I think it started before Holden died.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Meg: I saw it with my own eyes. I just didn't want to believe it.",
        "Lily: Nothing happened with Damian while Holden was alive.",
        "Meg: But you wanted it to. You couldn't stand the fact that Damian was falling in love with me. That's why you interfered. That's why you went to my mother and warned her that I shouldn't get involved with Damian! That's why you pulled out all the stops to keep us from going away together!",
        "Lily: I just thought the two of you were moving too quickly and that you needed time --",
        "Meg: No, you needed time, Lily, to get Damian back! I mean, the minute Holden was gone, oh, well, that was the perfect opportunity for you to take Damian away from me, and then, suddenly, it was, \"Holden who?\"",
        "Lily: How dare you say that!",
        "Meg: You know what the worst part is? What you've done to Damian. Everybody's gonna blame him. Everybody's gonna say, \"Oh, poor Lily. She was so vulnerable. Damian took advantage of her,\" but this whole time, you're the one that took advantage of him because you are who you've always been, a spoiled little princess who wants what she wants, when she wants it, and always gets it, no matter what. Well, you know what? It's over now.",
        "Lily: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Meg: You know what? I actually felt sorry for you. Do you know that? I thought, \"Poor, devastated Lily.\" I made it easy for you. I didn't like how much time Damian was spending with you, but I forced myself to understand. I could have fought harder, but I didn't, and I'm not gonna make that mistake again.",
        "Lily: I never wanted any of this.",
        "Meg: You know, I can't tell if you're lying to me or to yourself, but it just doesn't matter anymore, does it? You know, because my brother loved you so much, I'm gonna give you fair warning. Getting by on \"I'm sorry\" and \"Poor me\" just doesn't cut it anymore, Lily. You need to change, and fast, or you're gonna lose everything, and not just Damian -- your whole family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Damian: I have nothing to say to you, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I have something to say to you. Now, you were able to evict me from your hotel suite, but let's just see you try to throw me out of my own offices.",
        "Damian: Very well. If you won't leave, I will.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, no, no. Please, just -- just one simple question. What will it take to get you out of my daughter's life for good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The wedding is off?",
        "Emily: That's what I said.",
        "Paul: Why? What happened to change your mind? More importantly, what do I have to do to get you to change it back?",
        "Emily: I realize, no matter how good your intentions are, I will never be first with you.",
        "Paul: Because I went after Meg? You said you understood.",
        "Emily: I did understand. Meg was upset. I get that. But your first response, your gut response, was to go after her. Obviously you think you're over her, but you're not.",
        "Paul: I was worried about her. I'll always care about Meg.",
        "Emily: I knew it.",
        "Paul: She's the mother of my child.",
        "Emily: Yeah, no, no, no. See, your feelings for Meg are not just about Eliza.",
        "Paul: Okay, you're right. I admit it. I was worried about her.",
        "Emily: I knew it.",
        "Paul: But not in the way you think.",
        "Emily: No, what I think -- what I think is when you give an ex a shoulder to cry on, who knows where it goes from there?",
        "Paul: Look, I saw how sad she was, how upset, and I didn't want to save her. I mean, she got to me, but not in the way that she used to get to me.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but you still left me to go to her. Do you see that? And I'm sick of that. I'm sick of coming in second with you, first with Rosanna, then with Meg. And I can't take it anymore.",
        "Paul: Okay. You don't have to.",
        "Emily: It was your idea to get married. It wasn't my idea. You said you wanted to give me everything. Why are you laughing at me? You can't give me anything when you're so busy with somebody else!",
        "Paul: Emily, what can I say? You're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: We cannot wipe the slate clean. Too much has happened.",
        "Margo: Well, what if we had said that every time that we made one of our big mistakes, some of which were big enough to break us apart for good, but we always found a way back to each other, didn't we, Honey? We always did, no matter what, because we never gave up.",
        "Tom: But we didn't have a choice, Honey. Living without you was never an option.",
        "Margo: But it's not an option with Adam either. Come on. We can't just turn our backs on our son, and I think deep down you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Casey. Wow. This is a surprise.",
        "Casey: I thought you would be in a cell.",
        "Adam: Yeah, I'm just waiting for the officer to come get me and bring me back down.",
        "Casey: When's this gonna end, Adam?",
        "Adam: What are you talking about?",
        "Casey: You claim that you want everyone to forgive you, but you go out of your way to make everyone turn on each other. Is this some sort of game to you?",
        "Adam: What game am I playing? Huh? I'm sitting in jail.",
        "Casey: Well, how'd you get her to do it, Adam? Honestly, when I left home, Mom was working on Dad, trying to get him to represent you.",
        "Adam: Are you serious?",
        "Casey: Don't pretend like this is the first time you heard this.",
        "Adam: It is. I never asked Mom to do that.",
        "Casey: Oh, so you hinted it. Okay, same difference.",
        "Adam: That's not true. I told Mom that I didn't want a lawyer, all right, that I was gonna plead guilty.",
        "Casey: You did what?",
        "Adam: You heard me, all right. I'm pleading guilty.",
        "Casey: You really mean that?",
        "Adam: Why do you act so surprised? I mean, you know how I feel about what I did to Maddie and Gwen.",
        "Casey: Yes. You keep saying that. Sure.",
        "Adam: Because it's true, all right. There is no justification for what I've done, but you knew me before all the bad stuff happened, Casey. I was never this person who would go around hurting others. Or I wouldn't run away and hurt Mom for no reason.",
        "Casey: You had a reason. You wanted to stay out of jail.",
        "Adam: Oh, my God. No, Casey. That was not the reason, all right? Now, I'm not making excuses about what I've done, but after everything that happened, I mean, things were never the same for me.",
        "Casey: You're gonna have to be a little more specific.",
        "Adam: Don't worry. I have no intention of hurting Maddie or Gwen any more than I already have.",
        "Casey: Well, good.",
        "Adam: But after they buried me in the woods --",
        "Alison: What did you just say about Maddie and Gwen?",
        "Casey: Ali, what are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I wanted to tell you that Emily called off her party, but your phone was turned off, so I thought that maybe your mom would know where you were. You just said that Gwen and Maddie buried you in the woods. What the hell does that mean?",
        "Adam: You weren't supposed to hear that.",
        "Alison: Is it true? And you were awake? I mean, why would they ever do something like that?",
        "Adam: Maddie thought that I was trying to hurt Gwen, even though I wasn't. Not yet, at least. So, she hit me with a shovel and knocked me out. They thought they'd killed me.",
        "Alison: So they just dug a grave and --",
        "Adam: They were scared out of their minds, so they buried me in the woods.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Casey: Have you told anyone else about this?",
        "Adam: I tried to tell Mom to try and help explain things to her, but she didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Alison: What about the police?",
        "Adam: No, Gwen and Maddie have been through enough already. No, what's the point of bringing them down here for questioning if it's also gonna run the risk of them being thrown in jail, too?",
        "Alison: Adam, you have to tell the police.",
        "Adam: Getting them in trouble isn't going to help me. I won't do it, and I don't want you to, either. I want you to swear that you're not gonna tell anyone.",
        "Adam: Alison, I need you to promise me that you will not tell anyone.",
        "Casey: You caved?",
        "Tom: It's family, Casey.",
        "Casey: No, it's bull, okay? Come on. Let's go.",
        "Tom: So, I will be representing you.",
        "Adam: No, you won't.",
        "Margo: Don't be stupid, Adam. Let your father help you.",
        "Adam: I know Mom strong-armed you into this, but don't worry. I'm not gonna hold you to it.",
        "Tom: No. I want to do it.",
        "Adam: Why?",
        "Tom: Because you're my son.",
        "Adam: I remember when you used to feel that way.",
        "Tom: Well, I still do, even though I don't show it much lately.",
        "Adam: Yeah, well, I can understand --",
        "Tom: Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm mad as hell. You've disappointed me more than I thought was possible. But no matter what, you are my son, and you always will be. So, I suggest we get to work on getting you out of here.",
        "Adam: Whatever you say, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I just, I don't believe it. Anyone else would be in prison right now, but not Adam. No.",
        "Alison: I guess your father just feels like he has to do whatever he can.",
        "Casey: Well, yeah. Because it's never poor little Adam's fault, is it?",
        "Alison: No. I'm just -- I don't think that it was his fault that he was buried alive. I mean, can you believe it, Casey? That's something out of like a horror movie, but it actually happened to Adam. I mean, maybe that could even make a difference to his case.",
        "Casey: I'm pretty sure he deserved whatever Gwen and Maddie did to him.",
        "Alison: That's a little harsh, Case.",
        "Casey: Don't tell me you're on his side, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm sorry if my reflex to go after Meg upset you. We both have a lot of baggage.",
        "Emily: Oh, please. We could bring down a 747.",
        "Paul: So, let's just get rid of it.",
        "Emily: How, Paul? What are we gonna do, throw it on the side of the road?",
        "Paul: I don't see why not.",
        "Emily: How are we gonna do that?",
        "Paul: Look, we don't need to act the way people expect us to act, right? Regular people are never gonna like us, let alone think we're good enough.",
        "Emily: You got that right.",
        "Paul: So, why are we even playing this game?",
        "Emily: I am not following you.",
        "Paul: Do you really want a wedding, you know, with all the bells and whistles and the flower girls and hors d'oeuvres?",
        "Emily: No, I didn't want any of that. None of that mattered to me.",
        "Paul: Okay, then. The wedding is off.",
        "Emily: Fine. I'm glad we agree on something.",
        "Paul: But that doesn't mean we don't get married. Come with me, my soon-to-be ex-fianc\u00e9e.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, Damian and I could have had something real if you hadn't gone after him!",
        "Lily: Oh, come on. If Damian really wanted you, I could have never taken him away.",
        "Meg: He felt sorry for you, Lily. You played damsel in distress.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I take the role you wanted to play?",
        "Meg: I don't care what role you play. Just be prepared, 'cause actions have consequences, even yours.",
        "Lily: I'll bear that in mind, but for now -- get the hell out of my house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Are you really so afraid of me that you feel the need to bribe me, Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: I'm not afraid of you. And I think that Lily will see through your Maltese charms and send you packing. I just want to expedite things. That's all. So, when you determine what the price is, and you will, just -- let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Damian, I think we've said everything there is to say.",
        "Damian: You couldn't be more wrong. Meet me.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Damian: Please. Lily. There is something you need to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay. So, does this mean what I think it means?",
        "Paul: Yeah. We'll get married our own way. I mean, if you still want to marry me.",
        "Emily: Oh, I think this could turn out to be the wedding of my dreams.",
        "Judge: Good afternoon. On this, your special day, would you like the long version or the short?",
        "Paul and Emily: Short.",
        "Judge: Groom, repeat after me.",
        "Judge: By the power invested in me and by the state --",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.",
        "Emily: What? What's wrong? I'm sorry. Are you changing your mind on me again?",
        "Paul: No. No, please. I left you at the altar once. I'm not gonna repeat that performance, at least not until I get a chance to frisk you for weapons.",
        "Emily: Wh -- well, then, stop it. Why are you interrupting the nice man?",
        "Paul: I need to tell you how much I love you, Ms. Stewart. I've known you my whole life, been in love with you since I was too young to know any better. You've been through all of the best of my times and the worst of my times with me, and, well, even when I hated you, at least there was passion there, and that's what I want in my life. I'm passionate about you. I love you.",
        "Emily: We have been so tied to each other over the years, haven't we? In the good ways and bad. And sometimes I thought we'd never straighten things out, but here we are. Somehow we've found a way to someplace new. This new place, I love it. It's home. You're my home. I love you. You know, you're fearless. I mean, you have to be. You're marrying me, aren't you?",
        "Paul: You ready?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "Paul: Let her rip.",
        "Judge: I now pronounce you husband and wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, the first thing we do is try to figure out some type of defense.",
        "Adam: There isn't one, all right? That's what I keep trying to tell you guys.",
        "Margo: Yes, there is. There has to be, because I know you, Adam. You don't have a violent nature. There must have been some reason for you to lash out so viciously.",
        "Tom: I mean, if we were able to prove there were mitigating circumstances, that would go a long way toward getting a jury to cutting you some slack.",
        "Margo: Right. Now, we're not talking about an insanity defense, but something must have happened. Maybe there was an emotional distress or undue provocation.",
        "Adam: There was nothing, all right? Nothing we can use.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm just giving him the benefit of the doubt, but there is one way that we could know for sure. We could ask Gwen and Maddie.",
        "Casey: No, no. I'm not getting involved in it. I don't think you should either.",
        "Alison: But if that's the way we could find out the truth --",
        "Casey: Ali, okay. Even Adam said we shouldn't do anything, tell anyone, okay? So, just let it go, okay?",
        "Alison: I'm just saying, there's always another side to any story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, baby girl. You know, things might not look too good right now, but don't you worry, okay, 'cause I am not giving up. I am gonna fight for Damian, and you know, who knows? Maybe you'll have a wonderful, new daddy. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What did you want to talk to me about, Damian?",
        "Damian: I just wanted to make sure that you were all right after your mother's unexpected visit.",
        "Lily: I'm fine.",
        "Damian: Well, I wish I could say the same.",
        "Lily: She said some pretty horrible things about you. I'm sorry.",
        "Damian: You know, I'm getting really sick of hearing what a terrible person I am.",
        "Lily: I know what you mean. I feel the same.",
        "Damian: You know, I'm really sorry that Faith and Luke got dragged in to this mess, but, Lily, I must confess, I don't feel we did anything wrong.",
        "Lily: I don't either. I did at first, but I don't anymore.",
        "Damian: Do you mean that? You don't regret what happened between us?",
        "Lily: I don't. I know Holden's family thinks that I betrayed his memory by being with you, but they couldn't be more wrong. As much as I loved Holden, he's gone, and I need to accept that, and you're helping me do that.",
        "Damian: Cara, listen, I know you said you didn't want to see me anymore, but I'm not ready to walk away yet, not from you. Not from what we have together. But I will if you insist. Now, are you really sure you want to end things between us?",
        "Lily: No, I'm not.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Audrey: Ralph, I would like to present to you my son, Henry.",
        "Ralph: How you doing, Partner?",
        "Craig: You don't scare me.",
        "Henry: You might want to rethink that.",
        "Craig: So, take your dirty money and get out.",
        "Liberty: This is my body, and I should have the right to decide what to do with it.",
        "Katie: I do. I do respect that.",
        "Liberty: No, you don't. Just leave me alone. I want to go to Chicago again and get this done now. Will you still help me?"
