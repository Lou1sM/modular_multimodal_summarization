    "Transcript": [
        "Bob: Most days, a small-town hospital is a pretty quiet place in the early hours of the morning. In those moments before the carts begin rattling down the hall and the doctors and nurses start their rounds, all you can hear is the steady hum of the machines. Everything else is silent. That's my favorite time to be here. Always has been. It's the one time of day when I can assure myself that on my watch, all is as it should be. Of course, I know that at any moment, my grand illusion of order will be shattered. The hospital will spring to life along with the rest of the people who call this town home. The world will have turned once more, and another day will have begun in Oakdale, Illinois. As a doctor who has spent his entire professional life in this town, I've come to know an awful lot about the people of Oakdale.",

        "John: Indeed I am, and we intend to hang our little, wooden, Dutch shoes in your little hotel. And by the way, I would like roses on her breakfast tray every morning.",

        "Bob: No, I wasn't daydreaming.",
        "Kim: Mwah.",
        "Bob: I was just thinking about this place and how many patients that I've taken care of here, some of them from their first breath to their last. It really seems remarkable.",
        "Kim: Yes indeed. It does.",
        "Bob: It doesn't seem possible that I'm -- I'm going to retire today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: To witness the birth of a child is to witness a miracle. Except that it's actually the most ordinary thing in the world.",
        "Carly: Here you go.",
        "Jack: How's the morning sickness?",

        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Janet: Um, but, you know, if it's, uh -- if it's too much of a commitment for the both of you, I -- I know that it's -- it's, um -- if it's awkward, it's -- I totally understand.",
        "Jack: I would be honored, Janet. Thank you. Thank you very much. In fact, we have some news of our own.",

        "Casey: Yes, I will. I will. I know how lucky I am.",

        "Margo: You know what? I know that you haven't always felt that I've been fair to you, or that I've been harder on you than I needed to be. But, Casey, I just wanted you to be better than you ever thought you were, 'cause I knew you could be.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I read once somewhere that a happy marriage is a long conversation that always seems too short.",
        "Chris: Come here.",
        "Katie: Hold on a second. I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Chris: No, this is -- this is important?",
        "Chris: You know, I remember before I went into surgery, there were some things that I said to you, some promises that I made.",
        "Katie: Chris --",
        "Chris: And I know one of those things that I said is that I wanted to marry you.",
        "Katie: Stop right there. Hold on a second. I'm not gonna hold you to anything you said that day. You were going in for a heart transplant. We were all just desperate to believe we were gonna have a future together.",
        "Chris: I know. And now we have that future. And I want you to hold me to it, every word I said, every promise I made.",
        "Katie: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. What are you doing?",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no. Its okay, it's okay. If I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do it right. Katie, we both know how unpredictable life can be, how quickly things can change just when you think everything is perfect. And this is -- this is what I fought for when I was sick -- to wake up to your beautiful, sunny smile every morning, to fall asleep with you, curled up in my arms. Katie, I promise to love and care for you and Jacob for however long forever is for us. Will you marry me?",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Katie: You knew my answer before you even asked.",
        "Chris: Is that a yes?",
        "Katie: Yes! Of course it's a yes. It's a big yes. I will marry you.",
        "Chris: Will you help me up so I can kiss the hell out of you?",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Katie: Mm!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I just can't -- I can't -- I feel like I've been -- punched in the gut.",
        "Tom: Hey. Casey will be home, and you know that. You know, for visits and holidays.",
        "Margo: Well, that's not gonna be the same.",
        "Tom: Well, I was serious about what I said before. You know, this just might be a new beginning for us. I mean, look. We're gonna have the whole house to ourselves.",
        "Margo: Yeah -- this big, empty house.",
        "Tom: You're looking at this the wrong way. You know, what happened to Chris reminded me of all the promises that we made to each other when I had my heart attack, and they were we were gonna cut down on work and spend more time with each other.",
        "Margo: No. I'm not ready to retire yet, no.",
        "Tom: I didn't say anything about retiring. I'm talking about living in the here and now.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Margo: Well, the here is empty, and that's all I can think about now.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay, what?",
        "Tom: Give me your hand. We're going out.",
        "Margo: Thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You know, I was just thinking that, um, maybe we should consider getting a bigger place.",
        "Katie: You don't like it here?",
        "Chris: I -- I like it here. It's just -- it's getting a little full.",
        "Katie: You don't want to live in Brad's shadow.",
        "Chris: Well, I'm already living with Reid's heart. I thought maybe we could have something that's just our own.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: Oh. I'll get it. Hey.",
        "Tom: Your, uh, sister needs a distraction.",
        "Margo: Casey and -- and Alison left for Carbondale this morning. [Voice breaking] And now I just have this big, empty house and a bunch of dirty dishes.",
        "Tom: Like I said, distraction.",
        "Katie: I got a good one. Chris just asked me to marry him, and I said yes!",
        "Margo: Oh! Oh, my God, Katie, what? Oh, my God!",
        "Tom: Congratulations, Little brother. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Margo: Okay, I want details. Tell me what, when, when?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I don't know. We haven't even thought -- talked about it yet. But, um, we're gonna get Chris through his recovery, and then we want to look for a bigger house. You know, this place is kind of cramped.",
        "Margo: Oh, Man. You're looking for bigger. I'm looking for smaller. Oh -- oh, my God.",
        "Katie: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Margo: Exactly. If you're thinking what I'm thinking, you're thinking yes.",
        "Katie: Yeah!",
        "Margo: Oh!",
        "Chris: Tom, I'm scared.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, I think you'd better get used to that feeling.",
        "Margo: Yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Going through the changes life throws at you together is part of any marriage. But doing it with a sense of humor may be the key to a happy marriage.",
        "Barbara: Oh my. You -- you know that I never, never, ever mind when you kiss me.",
        "Henry: Excellent. Let's just -- let's keep that tradition going.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, but the problem is -- the problem is if you keep that up, we're never gonna get over to Paul and Emily's for dinner.",
        "Henry: You have the most luscious slope of neck I've ever seen in my entire life. It's ridiculous.",
        "Barbara: Well, you can admire my slope later on.",
        "Henry: You know, uh, if tonight really is an olive branch from Paul and Emily, are you sure you want to talk to Paul about the decisions that we've made?",
        "Barbara: Paul's gonna be upset no matter when we tell him.",
        "Henry: And you're sure this is what you want?",
        "Barbara: More than anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Emily: So, you're really gonna do it? You're really gonna tell Barbara you're walking away from B.R.O.?",
        "Paul: Yes, I am. I even had papers drawn up for the dissolution of our partnership. But do me a favor, okay? Don't -- don't talk to my mom until I get a chance to talk to her about this first.",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah. No, you don't have to worry about me. You can do all the talking this time. I'm gonna be busy hiding the knives in the kitchen.",
        "Paul: Look, she can kick and scream all she wants. I'm not changing my mind. You and Eliza are my first priority from now on. I'm cutting all strings. I'm gonna do something that makes myself happy for a change.",
        "Emily: Really? Like making out with me?",
        "Paul: That would make me happy.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Barbara: Hello.",
        "Henry: Uh, sorry to interrupt.",
        "Emily: Hello.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Paul: Can I get you guy a drink?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Barbara: Well, I -- in a moment. Um, Honey, there's something I need to talk to you about, and I don't really know how to do it other than just kind of lay it out. So here.",
        "Paul: What's this?",
        "Barbara: I'm dissolving our partnership in B.R.O. Paul, I love you, and I have loved working with you. But I have Henry now, and I want to spend my time with him. So, um, I hope you'll understand.",
        "Paul: I understand, more than you know.",

        "Chris: Luke, it's good to see you.",
        "Luke: Yeah. You as well. You look fantastic.",
        "Chris: Yeah. I feel great. I feel great. Transplant was a success.",
        "Luke: Good. Well, I thought you should know that I just came from dinner with a board member at the hospital, and I strongly suggested that once you're fully healed, they name you the new chief of staff at Memorial.",
        "Chris: Well, I'm -- I'm flattered. Really, I -- I am. But I, uh -- I'm not sure if that's the path I want to go down.",
