        "Dusty: What are you going to do with that?",
        "Lucy: I'm giving it to you to give to Johnny. He might not appreciate it now, but one of these days, \"Astro Girl\" might end up being his favorite superhero. If he's a truly evolved nonsexist human being. So when you give it to him, tell him to save it for when he's older and wiser.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you give it to him yourself?",
        "Lucy: When? I never see him.",
        "Dusty: So come home with me.",

        "Bob: In the program, there's a blank sheet of paper. It's there if you'd like to write a prayer, message, blessing for the young people that we've lost and their families. Once you've written it you can then deposit it in this little box over here. That concludes this service, but please feel free to stay as long as you like.",
        "Liv: Hi, Casey.",
        "Casey: Hi.",
        "Liv: Mr. Hughes. I just wanted to say -- I was wrong before, saying things about Maddie, blaming her. If you see her, would you please tell her that I'm sorry?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Liv: Thanks.",
        "Tom: Looks like your speech did some good.",
        "Casey: I just wish Maddie would have been here to hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You want me to move back into your house with you? Why?",
        "Margo: Would you rather stay here with memories of Eve and Louis everywhere you turn?",
        "Maddie: I still have Henry.",
        "Henry: What's wrong?",
        "Margo: No, nothing -- nothing. Not an official visit.",
        "Henry: Good. I'm glad to hear that. I don't think I could handle one of those right now.",
        "Maddie: Henry, you sounded wiped on the phone. Were things worse than you said?",
        "Henry: Ahh, no, just dysfunctional. You know, as always. That's what makes us the Colemans. I went home to tell the family what they couldn't read in the papers. What really happened with Eve?",
        "Maddie: Everybody okay?",
        "Henry: No one is angry with you. How many times do I have to tell you that before you start to believe me?",
        "Margo: About that --",
        "Maddie: You know what, thank you, Mrs. Hughes for inviting me, but I need to stay with Henry. I've had it rough, but so has he.",
        "Henry: You want to catch me up here?",
        "Margo: I asked Maddie if she would move back in with Tom and me.",
        "Maddie: Bad idea, right?",
        "Henry: Actually, that's a great idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Kim: Where are you going?",
        "Barbara: I'm concerned about Will. He was very upset.",
        "Kim: Honey, Gwenny is with him.",
        "Barbara: I understand that, but if he's upset --Will.",
        "Bob: He has his wife to comfort him.",
        "Kim: They just got back together again. Now they deserve some alone time.",
        "Barbara: But they're not alone. That wretched little Jade followed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Baby, what is it? What's wrong?",
        "Jade: Can I help?",
        "Will: Let's get out of here.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'm just going to tell your mom.",
        "Will: No! Now, Gwen! Let's leave right now.",
        "Gwen: Why, Will? What does Jade have to do with this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Here. You can take it. It doesn't have any gay cooties on it. How's Kevin?",
        "Liv: Okay, I guess. I haven't really seen him. I've just been sticking pretty close to home ever since -- you know, if Kevin didn't fall in that lake, we would have still been there. She could have killed us.",
        "Luke: Lucky us. No, I mean that. I'm not being sarcastic. We are lucky, and we've got to remember that. Appreciate the lives that we have, and the friends that we have.",
        "Gil: Are you ready to go, Liv?",
        "Liv: I guess. Yeah.",
        "Gil: See you, Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You know, I still have days where I just can't believe that Jennifer is really gone. And so being here, and seeing all these parents and knowing what they're facing -- it just makes me want to protect all that I have left that's good. And so if I'm a little anxious about Will and Gwen --",
        "Kim: But they have so much more going for them than most people their age. You just have to trust that.",
        "Barbara: I do. I do trust them. I don't trust Jade. I'm going out there.",
        "Bob: Barbara, don't. The kids are going to think that you're trying to micromanage them.",
        "Kim: They can manage their own marriage.",
        "Barbara: And what if they can't?",
        "Kim: Well, then they'll turn to you of their own accord. Now isn't that better than forcing yourself on them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Will: Jade, I want you to leave.",
        "Jade: But --",
        "Will: Go, now. I need to talk to Gwen.",
        "Dallas: Jade, hey, I was looking for you.",
        "Jade: Why? I didn't do anything.",
        "Dallas: I didn't say you did. Did something happen outside?",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Dallas: All right, you just seem defensive, that's all.",
        "Jade: Are you being a cop now?",
        "Dallas: About that -- look, I'm sorry if things were getting rough. I mean, questioning and everything. Everybody was a potential suspect. Now if I was too hard on you -- believe me.",
        "Jade: I'm fine.",
        "Dallas: How can you be? With everything you're dealing with?",
        "Jade: What do you mean?",
        "Dallas: If you want to talk --",
        "Jade: No, I have friends to talk to. Luke. There you are!",
        "Luke: Hey, I didn't know you were looking for me.",
        "Dallas: Look, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for everything you two are going through.",
        "Luke: So what's going on?",
        "Jade: He was just asking questions about things that were none of his business.",
        "Luke: No, I meant with Will and Gwen.",
        "Jade: Nothing.",
        "Luke: Well, first Will gets up and leaves the church, and then Gwen, and then you follow them. So what's happening?",
        "Jade: I needed some air.",
        "Luke: Okay, fine. Then I'm going to ask Will.",
        "Jade: Okay, okay, all right. I'll tell you. Everybody's going to find out anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: We should go somewhere and talk.",
        "Gwen: No. Tell me here. Are you in love with Jade?",
        "Will: No! Of course not, I love you. After everything that we said to each other yesterday, how could you think that?",
        "Gwen: I don't know what to think! Okay, you're scaring me. And the idea of you falling out of love with me is the scariest thing I can think of. So what's going on?",
        "Will: I've never wanted to lie as much I do right now. And tell you that nothing's wrong, and for you to believe it, and for us to go on like before.",
        "Gwen: You promised.",
        "Will: I know. I can't keep secrets from you. And I won't lie to you.",
        "Gwen: Okay. What's going on?",
        "Will: Jade's pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You want me to go? You do blame me!",
        "Henry: No, I don't!",
        "Maddie: Then why are you sending me away?",
        "Henry: Well, Margo offered, and -- come here, come here, come here. I love you, I do. And of all my relatives, you are far and above my favorite.",
        "Maddie: That's not saying much. You don't like any of them.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but I love me. I love me. That's why when I say that I value you more than my own life, that is high praise, Kid. I mean, come on. We have a problem, you and I.",
        "Maddie: What kind of problem?",
        "Henry: I can't say no to you.",
        "Maddie: You say no to me all the time.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know, I do. And then you pester me and you snarl at me, or you hug me, and then forget it, I cave in. And that's not good for you.",
        "Maddie: Sure, it is.",
        "Henry: Maddie -- Maddie, you were raped.",
        "Maddie: I don't -- I don't want to talk about that.",
        "Henry: I don't want to talk about it, either. I don't want to talk about it, either. But that's what happens. I avoid it, and you avoid it, and then it just sits there. Festering.",
        "Maddie: Like it did with me and with Eve.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm a real wuss when it comes to talking about certain things. Margo, though, she's tough. And she's been through it, and she got past it, and maybe she can help you get past it, too. She's someone how can talk to about it, maybe get you to talk about it. I want you well, Kid, okay? And that's not going to happen if you stay here with me.",
        "Maddie: Aren't you going to be lonely without me?",
        "Henry: We're gonna have breakfast at Java, lunch at Al's, we'll have dinner right here at the Lakeview.",
        "Margo: And Henry can come over and visit us any time he wants.",
        "Henry: Well, thank you very much. Expect to see me around dinner. Very often. What do you say, Kid?",
        "Maddie: What if she kicks me out again?",
        "Margo: Oh, Honey, I'm sorry about that. That was a knee-jerk reaction. And I hurt you. And I never should have had you move out.",
        "Maddie: I know you were worried about Casey and me -- being together.",
        "Henry: Casey! I completely forgot about Casey. Wow, I really am tired. Margo, I'm sorry, she can't move in with you.",
        "Margo: Because of Casey?",
        "Henry: Your son's a teenage boy. And he thinks that he's in love with Madeline.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but Casey won't --",
        "Henry: I know you think he wouldn't push her into something she's not ready for yet, but you don't know that for sure. Forget everything I said, okay? You're not going anywhere. You're staying right here. As far away from Casey and his red-blooded hormones as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Your speech was beautiful, Casey. I'm just sorry your mom missed it.",
        "Tom: I was just telling him the same thing.",
        "Dallas: Casey, can I have a minute?",
        "Casey: Sure.",
        "Dallas: Look I want to clear the air about Maddie.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I went off on you a couple of times, but I was out of line. I know now that you were really trying to help her.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, I was. How's she doing?",
        "Casey: I pushed her to come here tonight, but then she saw the way some of these kids were acting and she just couldn't stick around for it --",
        "Dallas: I don't blame her, your speech will cut through a lot of that. And if I ever see Maddie taking any flak, I'll be sure to remind them of what you said.",
        "Casey: Thanks --",
        "Tom: Hey Dallas, Casey just got out of the hospital. I think I need to get him home.",
        "Dallas: Feel better, Man.",
        "Tom: Ready?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Dad?",
        "Tom: Yeah?",
        "Casey: I don't want to go home.",
        "Tom: Look, you promised your grandfather, not to mention your parents, that you would take care of yourself. You need to rest.",
        "Casey: I need to see Maddie too, Dad. I want to be with her, tonight, when it counts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Drink this.",
        "Simon: No, no, never drinking ever again. No --",
        "Carly: It's bottled water, Simon.",
        "Simon: Wow, you really are beautiful. All three of you. You're all beautiful.",
        "Carly: Thank you, we all three thank you.",
        "Simon: And that's why I'm sick.",
        "Carly: Because you think I'm beautiful?",
        "Simon: No! Because I drank all those stupid, but very -- very delicious cocktails tonight.",
        "Carly: Ah.",
        "Simon: That was bad. But kissing you --",
        "Carly: Better?",
        "Simon: Yeah better -- that was beyond better.",
        "Carly: Well that's high praise coming from someone like you.",
        "Simon: You know this water seems to be doing the trick. There are only two of you now.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Simon: No, where were we?",
        "Carly: Ahh let's see where were we? Well, if I remember correctly -- we were right about here.",
        "Simon: Oh yes, yes -- do with me what you will. Take control. But be just a little bit gentle -- I'm quite fragile.",
        "Carly: All right, big guy? This is not foreplay.",
        "Simon: Carly!",
        "Carly: Yes -- I'm right here, keep it down.",
        "Simon: Shhh.",
        "Carly: Did you want to tell me something?",
        "Simon: No -- oh, yeah. You know what the worst thing about being divorced is?",
        "Carly: What's that?",
        "Simon: Losing, too.",
        "Carly: Huh?",
        "Simon: Losing too. You know, the word , too. Like \"I'm having ice cream. Do you want one, too?\" \"I love New York in spring time.\"",
        "Carly: Me, too.",
        "Simon: Yeah, you got it! I love you. I love you, too.\" When you're divorced, you don't hear that much anymore.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you for the preview.",
        "Simon: Good night.",
        "Carly: Don't sleep -- do not sleep!",
        "Simon: Okay -- what are we going to do?",
        "Carly: We're going to take a shower. Okay? Come on up.",
        "Simon: A shower. Just you and me?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Simon: That's going to be hot.",
        "[Carly laughing]",
        "Carly: All right. Now hold on -- hold on --",
        "Simon: Oh this is going to be good.",
        "[Carly laughing]",
        "Carly: All right --",
        "Simon: This is going to be great.",
        "Carly: All right, in you go -- well I don't know how you'll feel about this exactly.",
        "[Simon screaming]",
        "[Carly laughing]",
        "Simon: This is freezing!",
        "Carly: Yeah, I thought you'd feel that way. It's the best way to sober you up, Simon. Come on.",
        "Simon: Ahh! I got to get out. I need -- [Simon laughing] Oh, I told you I'd make you scream.",
        "[Carly laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, no, no Henry, you don't understand I would never ask Maddie to move back in with us if Casey was going to be living there too.",
        "Henry: Okay, where's he going to be?",
        "Margo: Well he'll be at the campus at Oakdale U. Tom and I both agreed he should live in the dorms. So, that kicked my empty-nest syndrome into overdrive. You let Maddie live with us -- I promise you, Tom and I are in the best frame of mind. We'll take such good care of her.",
        "Henry: Maddie, what do you want to do?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Tom: You're still here?",
        "Margo: Yeah well, Maddie and I were talking so --",
        "Casey: How are you feeling?",
        "Maddie: I'm good. Your mom asked me to move back in.",
        "Casey: You did?",
        "Henry: How do you feel about that?",
        "Tom: Great. Margo and I talked about it last night. We'd love to have Maddie back.",
        "Margo: So what do you think?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I would love to live with you guys.",
        "Casey: This is so cool!",
        "Margo: Cool for us. You'll be living on campus.",
        "Casey: Not anymore. If Maddie's going to be living at our house, then so am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: When you said you had a sitter for Johnny, I assumed it would be at your place. Not here at Barbara's.",
        "Dusty: Well Barbara wanted to spend some time with him before she went to the memorial service.",
        "Lucy: When will she be home?",
        "Dusty: Not for a while. Are you scared of my mother-in-law?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Don't be. Johnny will protect you. He's got her wrapped around his finger.",
        "Lucy: Okay, Johnny. Are you ready? This action figure is for you!",
        "Dusty: All right -- what do you know? He's destined to be a superhero movie freak just like his big sister.",
        "Dusty: He watches DVDs all the time. He loves them.",
        "Lucy: When he's older, maybe I can take him to the movies, get to know him better -- if that's okay with you.",
        "Dusty: Can I come along?",
        "Lucy: If my little brother says it's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well it looks like Will and Gwen won't be back anytime soon and -- since I would like to leave tonight, and since that's the only way out.",
        "Bob: No it's not -- there's the back door. And it's closer to the parking lot.",
        "Barbara: Why are you two being so adamant about this?",
        "Kim: Because he's not your little boy anymore. He's a man and he has a wife.",
        "Barbara: Yes, a wife I'm very fond of, and would like to keep a member of my family.",
        "Bob: Didn't you promise Jennifer that you would not interfere so much?",
        "Barbara: Okay. Where is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Jade is going to have a baby. Your baby.",
        "Will: Yes. I never meant -- this is crazy I know.",
        "Gwen: Didn't you guys use protection?",
        "Will: Yeah, of course we did -- we used protection. I guess something must've went wrong, one of those crazy accidents.",
        "Gwen: An accident, yeah --",
        "Will: I'd give anything to make this different. I love you. I don't want Jade in our lives. But if she's going to keep this kid then -- then I'm going to have to deal and do the right thing for the baby.",
        "Gwen: So, she's going to keep it?",
        "Will: Yes. I know I'm asking a lot of you, to accept this, and to stick with me anyway. But please -- love me enough to do that.",
        "Gwen: Again. You want me to love you enough to forgive you, again.",
        "Will: Nothing has changed between you and me. I still feel exactly the same way as I did when I said those vows.",
        "Gwen: I forgave you, Will. I forgave you for lying to me and for sleeping with Jade.",
        "Will: This is theme on what do you want me to say?",
        "Gwen: That we still have a marriage? That everything is going to be okay?",
        "Will: Yes. I want you to say that.",
        "Gwen: I can't do that.",

        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Maggie: I know you want this Casey.",
        "Casey: I don't want any of it if I can't be with you.",
        "Carly: I was ready for you Simon. But the problem is you weren't ready for me.",
        "Lucy: You're his dad. Johnny will never hear anything different from me.",

        "Luke: Jade, come on -- just let Will go. Let Will go.",
        "Jade: He must have told Gwen about the baby. I should be with him.",
        "Luke: Give them some time. Unless you're trying to ruin their marriage permanently.",
        "Jade: I'm not.",
        "Luke: Good.",
        "Jade: You don't think Will would run out on me and the baby, would he?",
        "Luke: No -- no. Come on we're talking about Will here. He's a good guy.",
        "Jade: Yeah but he didn't even ask about how I was feeling or anything. All he cares about is Gwen.",
        "Luke: They're married, Jade.",
        "Jade: Like I don't know that.",
        "Luke: Well then act like it. Open your eyes. Will loves Gwen. And you being pregnant is not going to change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Sorry about that. Sometimes he moves a lot faster than I do.",
        "Lucy: It's okay. I'll just put some water on it, and it'll come right out. I'm just glad it landed on me instead of Barbara's couch.",
        "Dusty: Oh, he's a wrecking ball.",
        "Lucy: He's amazing, Dusty. You're phenomenal. Did you know that?",
        "Dusty: His pediatrician says he's just normal.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well I'm a doctor and I say he's the most spectacular child ever.",
        "Dusty: I just want him to stay healthy.",
        "Lucy: He is that. And he's strong. And determined. You're doing a great job with him, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: He gets his strength from his mom. She was a very determined woman.",
        "Lucy: My father can be described as a pretty determined guy.",
        "Dusty: I'm Johnny's father.",
        "Lucy: Of course you are.",
        "Dusty: Why did you bring up Craig?",
        "Ly: I can't help thinking about him when I look at Johnny sometimes. His genes are in both of us.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to be reminded.",
        "Lucy: You don't need to run from it, either. Who Johnny is, who you're raising him to be, has nothing to do with Craig Montgomery. Johnny could hear his name every day, and it wouldn't matter, because you're his dad in all the ways that count. Dusty, you're his dad. Johnny will never hear anything different from me.",

        "Tom: That's not a good idea, Casey.",
        "Casey: Sure it is. This way, you and Mom can save money on dorm fees, and Maddie and I can hang out the way we used to.",
        "Maddie: Casey --",
        "Henry: I'm not comfortable with that.",
        "Margo: We're not comfortable with that, either, Casey. That's not the plan.",
        "Maddie: Can I just -- can I just say something?",
        "Casey: So we'll change the plan.",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Maddie: Hi, hello! Can I just talk to Casey alone for a minute? Everyone leave? Please?",
        "Henry: Don't pressure her.",
        "Maddie: Henry.",
        "Henry: Leaving.",
        "Casey: This is going to be good, Maddie. We can finally get back to we used to be.",
        "Maddie: A lot has changed since then.",
        "Casey: Right, but you liked living with my parents?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I did. Your parents are a lot different from mine. I mean, they care when you're leaving or not, and whether you ate breakfast. It's a safe place. And I really need to feel safe right now.",
        "Casey: So it's all set.",
        "Maddie: Not unless you do something for me.",
        "Casey: Name it.",
        "Maddie: I want you to move out, Casey. I want you to live in the dorms.",

        "Simon: What can I say?",
        "Carly: You don't have to say anything.",
        "Simon: Oh, boy, I cannot remember the last time I drank so much that I was actually sick.",
        "Carly: It's okay. You know, we're probably lucky that it happened.",
        "Simon: Okay. Am I still drunk or did that just make no sense?",
        "Carly: Obviously, we weren't meant to be together tonight.",
        "Simon: Right, right. So what was with all the kissing and groping?",
        "Carly: Can we not analyze it, okay?",
        "Simon: All right. Or maybe it was just 'cause you weren't ready.",
        "Carly: Oh, I was ready for you, Simon. The problem is, you weren't ready for me. Here I come.",
        "Simon: Listen, if you need proof that I was ready --",
        "Carly: No, no, Simon. Physically -- oh -- physically, you are prime. But emotionally, you're a mess.",
        "Simon: And how did you come to that conclusion?",
        "Carly: I knew those drinks were lethal after just taking one sip. And after watching you down them one after the other, it was sort of obvious that you wanted to get drunk.",
        "Simon: Why on earth would I want to do that? Why would I do that purposefully?",
        "Carly: So you wouldn't have to take that last step. You were trying to avoid it.",
        "Simon: Oh, come on. If I was trying to avoid you, why was I so quick to rush you up here?",
        "Carly: To prove that you wanted me. But you really don't want me.",
        "Simon: Why does every single conversation have to mention my ex-wife?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm just keeping it real.",
        "Simon: No, real -- real's good. Do you want to keep it real?",
        "Carly: Yeah, lay it on me.",
        "Simon: All right, I got drunk tonight because I wanted to get you drunk. I wanted to show you a good time, try to take your mind off your pain. But the next thing I knew, my world was spinning and you were still annoyingly sober.",
        "Carly: I had the bartender water down my drinks.",
        "Simon: Smart. Sneaky, but smart.",
        "Carly: Simon -- do you really want me?",
        "Simon: Yeah. I mean, you're not scared of my past. You're always two steps ahead of me. And boy, are you unbelievable fun. And looking at you right now -- oh, I got some ideas of what I would like to do. Ideas I promise I will not act on tonight.",
        "Carly: Because you can't?",
        "Simon: No, not because I can't. No, because I'm going to wait 'till tomorrow afternoon.",
        "Carly: What happens tomorrow afternoon?",
        "Simon: Well, it gives me tonight to sleep off this -- tomorrow, to recover, and then you and I have a date back here tomorrow afternoon, where we are going to pick up where we unfortunately had to leave off.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Simon: No?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Simon: Never?",
        "Carly: No, not necessarily never. Just no, not right now. We really need to finish the building, okay?",
        "Simon: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Carly: And then we're gonna see what happens.",
        "Simon: How am I possibly going to do any good work when this is all I'm going to be thinking about?",
        "Carly: Just think of it as motivation, as inspiration --",
        "Simon: Frustration --",
        "Carly: Just get some rest. We'll go back home and the building will be finished soon.",
        "Simon: All right. So let me get this straight. The sooner we flip this building, the sooner you and I get to --",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. But Simon, work fast, because I could always change my mind.",

        "Lucy: I bought it at the movies.",

        "Barbara: How nice.",
        "Lucy: I should be going.",
        "Dusty: Johnny poured his drink on Lucy. Do you have anything to get the stain out?",
        "Barbara: Why, of course I do. It's in the guest bath. I'm sure you remember where that is.",
        "Lucy: It'll wait till I get home. It's really -- its okay. It's okay. It'll be fine.",
        "Barbara: I think you should take care of it right now.",

        "Casey: So I'll help you.",
        "Maddie: You keep saying that. So do it. Please, help me. Live in the dorms.",
        "Casey: So you don't want to see me at all while you're dealing with this?",
        "Maddie: I want you to have the freshman year that you've always wanted. I want you to jump into college with both feet, and not have one stuck at home with me. This is your year, Casey. You can go out and stay out without a curfew, and decorate your dorm room however you want, pull all-nighters and not have to explain why you waited until the last minute to start that paper --",
        "Casey: You make it sound great.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, that's how you described it to me about a million times. I know you want this, Casey.",

        "Dusty: You made her feel like she got a visit from the vice squad. Am I wrong?",
        "Barbara: No. Look, it has been a very difficult evening. This memorial was lovely, but it was very upsetting. You are my son-in-law, I care deeply about you and about Johnny --",
