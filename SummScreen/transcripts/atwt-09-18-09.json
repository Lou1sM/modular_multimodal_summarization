        "Craig: Ready?",
        "Teri: No.",
        "Craig: You'll do fine.",
        "Teri: I'm totally freaking out.",
        "Rosanna: It's just a practice run, right?",
        "Craig: Just to make sure we're ready.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, you're gonna be fine. Good luck!",
        "Craig: Hey, why don't you come with us?",
        "Rosanna: Why would you need me?",
        "Teri: Moral support? And an honest opinion.",
        "Craig: You'll never get anything but that from her.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, ha, ha.",
        "Teri: I could really use another friendly face.",
        "Rosanna: Where's Janet?",
        "Teri: Not speaking to me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, 'cause you tried to help with Liberty. Okay, then yes. I will come.",
        "Teri: Great.",
        "Craig: I'm glad you're coming.",
        "Rosanna: Really? Why?",
        "Craig: I hate eating alone.",
        "Rosanna: Right, of course. Why else would you want me as a dinner companion? [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, Liberty, are you okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine.",
        "Parker: You sure? I saw you bail on assembly.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I threw up, so the nurse saw me and dragged me to her office.",
        "Parker: What'd you tell her?",
        "Liberty: Food poisoning.",
        "Parker: Did she buy it?",
        "Liberty: For now. But I don't know how long I can keep the truth from coming out.",
        "Parker: It's nobody's business.",
        "Liberty: Right, like kids don't spread ugly rumors in high school.",
        "Parker: When are you gonna decide what you're doing?",
        "Liberty: I've already decided, Parker. I just have to figure out how to do it without my mom hating me forever.",
        "Parker: Well, if you wait much longer, you're gonna let your mom make your decision for you.",
        "Liberty: You think I don't already know that?",
        "Parker: Sorry.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm sorry. It's not your fault.",
        "Parker: If there's anything that I can do for you -- you know that.",
        "Liberty: I know. You can't.",
        "Girl: Hey, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Oh, hey, guys.",
        "Girl: So, how was your summer, baby-mama?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How's she doing?",
        "Janet: She's quiet and angry. And now I have to go talk to Brad about something that he wants her to do that I think she will regret for the rest of her life.",
        "Jack: Well, you guys got to get on the same page.",
        "Janet: How?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Janet: Yeah, well, there's no way of compromising here, is there?",
        "Jack: Then you're gonna have to figure out a way to agree to disagree, Honey, because Liberty needs both of you.",
        "Janet: I know. Thank you.",
        "Jack: For what?",
        "Janet: For not disagreeing as much as Brad does, because, let's face it, we both know you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: We got to do something soon.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "Brad: About Liberty. I mean, I just don't -- I don't understand what she's waiting for.",
        "Katie: Seriously?",
        "Brad: Look, I know that Janet's having trouble with the idea. You know, the idea of an abortion.",
        "Katie: No, she's not having trouble with it. She's dead set against it.",
        "Brad: Maybe if we just go over there tonight and try to explain it to her in a calm, unemotional way.",
        "Katie: Right, because when people disagree about abortion, they're always so calm and unemotional.",
        "Brad: I know, I know, I know. But I'm just -- maybe if we told her that we both feel really strongly, that Liberty having a baby right now would be a huge mistake. She should at least try to understand. I mean, it's worth a shot. What do we have to lose?",
        "Katie: It's not that.",
        "Brad: Then what is it?",
        "Katie: I just -- I'm not sure if you and I totally see eye-to-eye on this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Just letting the sitter know that today's a half day, and she needs to pick up Johnny. There. So. What do you think?",
        "Rosanna: I'm impressed.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. I think you and Teri have done a great job. [Laughs]",
        "Rosanna: If the food is half as good as it looks on the menu, you're gonna have 'em lined up around the block.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. We all know Teri's a great chef, so I think you got a winner here, Craig.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, really. What's wrong with you?",
        "Craig: I'm not used to so many words coming out of your mouth aimed at me that didn't include an insult.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can be positive when there's a reason to be.",
        "Craig: I didn't know that.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I guess you wouldn't.",
        "Craig: So, does this mean you think I've done a pretty good job here?",
        "Rosanna: It seems so.",
        "Craig: And does that mean that you might think that I'm actually not such a bad guy after all?",
        "Rosanna: I wouldn't push your luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: How many of those have you had?",
        "Henry: Not enough.",
        "Audrey: Son, we solved your problem with Vienna, remember?",
        "Henry: Getting a gangster to launder money through Metro is not my idea of a solution.",
        "Audrey: It's going to be fine!",
        "Henry: Why, Mother, why? Because Ralph is such a sweetheart?",
        "Audrey: Because you can count on him.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I can count on him to break my knees.",
        "Audrey: He's not a violent man.",
        "Ralph: Oh, there she is, that lovely Audrey. Good to see you.",
        "Audrey: Hello, you. Muah, muah. Ralph, I would like to present to you my son, Henry.",
        "Ralph: How you doing, partner?",
        "Henry: Uh, I'm fine, but we're not partners.",
        "Audrey: Henry.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. It's nothing personal. It's just, I don't think this business works for me.",
        "Ralph: But your mother and I, we made a deal.",
        "Henry: Right, but I didn't agree to that.",
        "Ralph: Are you calling your mother a liar?",
        "Henry: No, of course not. She just has a problem with boundaries.",
        "Ralph: There are no boundaries between a mother and son. And a deal is a deal.",
        "Henry: I understand how you feel, I do.",
        "Ralph: I certainly hope so.",
        "Henry: You can let go now.",
        "Ralph: You are gonna learn to respect your lovely mother and our deal, aren't you?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, absolutely, yes.",
        "Ralph: Okay, good. Let's go see our club.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, hey, come here! Come here! If anyone's knees get broken in this, it damn well better be yours! [Coughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Are you telling me that you think Liberty should have this baby?",
        "Katie: It's not that simple.",
        "Brad: She is 17. It sounds pretty damn simple to me.",
        "Katie: Maybe because you're a man.",
        "Brad: I'm her -- I'm her father, Katie! I thought you agreed with me.",
        "Katie: On some things, I do. But it's really hard for me to sit here with this miracle baby growing inside me and think about some other woman having an abortion.",
        "Brad: Okay, look around you. Look around you. Your situation is totally different.",
        "Katie: I know that. And I would never tell another woman what to do. But we tried so hard to get pregnant. I didn't think I would be able to for a while, then we went through all of that stuff trying to adopt, and what about what we went through with Vienna?",
        "Brad: This isn't about us. This isn't about you. This isn't about me. This is -- I mean, come on, she's 17. She should be thinking. She should be focusing on college, SATs, prom night.",
        "Katie: Look, I know that, but she did get pregnant.",
        "Brad: I'm not telling you that she doesn't bear some responsibility for what happened, because, yes, she does. But I don't think its right for Janet to be pressuring her to do what she wants instead of what Liberty wants. Ahh, okay, I got to go to the studio. Can I tell Janet that we're gonna come over later?",
        "Katie: I would be happy to talk to Liberty, yeah.",
        "Brad: Thank you.",
        "Katie: I'm just not sure what I'm gonna say to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Come on, Parker, let's go.",
        "Girl: So, Liberty, when do you start to get fat?",
        "Girl: She'll probably need a guys' size graduation robe.",
        "Parker: Get lost.",
        "Girl: He's ticked. She wants Tony to be the daddy.",
        "Girl: You guys used to be married, right?",
        "Parker: Yeah, so?",
        "Girl: So the baby's yours and everybody knows it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi, thanks. Is Brad here?",
        "Katie: He already left. Aren't you gonna be late?",
        "Janet: I wanted to talk to him.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "Janet: Liberty.",
        "Katie: Yeah, actually, he wanted to talk to you about that later, too, after work.",
        "Janet: Katie, I don't know what I'm gonna do. A part of me wants to just go ahead and let Liberty do what she feels is right, and then another part of me wants to just hang on, you know. I mean, look at you. You're glowing. I don't think she understands what she could miss out on.",
        "Katie: She'll have it one day, just not now.",
        "Janet: You sound like Jack. And my sister.",
        "Katie: Listen, I'm not trying to sound like anyone. Liberty has to decide on her own about this. You know that better than anyone.",
        "Janet: I know, I know, I know. I was terrified. It wasn't easy, trust me. And I'm not telling Liberty to do what I did, which is to raise a baby on my own. But it's just -- an abortion?",
        "Katie: I know. I know. A baby is a precious gift.",
        "Janet: You agree with me?",
        "Katie: Well, I don't think I should take sides.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but I just think that she needs to know all the options.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. That's fair.",
        "Janet: Right, and then, if you could talk to her, seeing as you're pregnant yourself, she'll listen to you. She respects you.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know, Janet.",
        "Janet: Please. Katie, she's already tuned me out. Maybe she'll listen to you. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I don't care what Tony told you. There's no baby.",
        "Parker: Okay, here's the deal, you guys. Either you shut up and leave right now, or I tell the next 50 people about what you two did at the party last month. Bye.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Parker: There's still Tony.",
        "Liberty: I can't believe he said I was lying, then just goes shooting his mouth off.",
        "Parker: He won't be for long.",
        "Liberty: Parker, no. Please don't get in trouble over this. He's really not worth it.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you are. I mean that in a completely step brotherly/friend way.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Liberty: Hold on. Hm. Katie.",
        "Katie: Liberty, hi.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, hi.",
        "Katie: I was just wondering if you could come by the house on your way home from school.",
        "Liberty: Sure. Why?",
        "Katie: I have a cake plate of your mother's.",
        "Liberty: Right. Cake emergency. No problem.",
        "Katie: Great. I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Thank you so much.",
        "Katie: I can't promise anything.",
        "Janet: I know, it's just so nice to know there's at least one person out there that doesn't think I'm a crazy church lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Hey, Dude.",
        "Parker: How hard do I have to beat on you before you shut your mouth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, hello. Hey, it's Carly's co-owner, in the flesh!",
        "Henry: Craig. You know what, maybe we should come back later.",
        "Craig: No, no. Your timing's impeccable. Our new chef is giving our new kitchen a test drive.",
        "Ralph: You've got a new chef, huh? Supposed to be good?",
        "Craig: Better than good. And who might you be?",
        "Ralph: I'm your partner's new partner.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, you're not.",
        "Audrey: Hello. We haven't met yet. I'm Audrey Coleman. I'm Henry's mother. Actually, I had him in high school or something. But you're Craig Montgomery. Henry's told me so much about you. But he failed to mention how absolutely delicious you are.",
        "Craig: Nice to meet you, too. You, I'm not so sure about.",
        "Ralph: I'm getting a lot of negativity off you.",
        "Rosanna: You know, don't worry about it. Most people do. Hi, I'm Rosanna Cabot. I'm Carly Tenney's sister. We're here on her behalf since she's away for a little while, representing her interests.",
        "Ralph: Oh, good. Well, her interests are my interests, now that I've got a stake in the place.",
        "Craig: Okay. Henry, I think we need to have a little talk in private.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Right after I take this call.",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me one second.",
        "Craig: Craig Montgomery.",
        "Henry: We should come back when he's not here.",
        "Ralph: That's not how I do things.",
        "Henry: I just don't want any ugliness, that's all.",
        "Ralph: No ugliness. I'm just gonna set the guy straight.",
        "Craig: A word?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Craig: The sitter never got the message, which means Johnny's still at school, waiting for someone to pick him up. I need to go get him.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't worry about it. I'll do it.",
        "Craig: You will?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Yes, you stay here and figure this out.",
        "Craig: Well, thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Excuse me, bye. Excuse me.",
        "Craig: Henry.",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Craig: Can we talk?",
        "Ralph: Well, there's nothing that you can say to my partner that you can't say to me.",
        "Craig: I don't think so.",
        "Henry: Uh, no, Craig, he's right. Ralph and I, we don't have any secrets.",
        "Craig: Ralph?",
        "Ralph: You have a problem with my name, too?",
        "Craig: No, I don't have a problem with your name. I have a problem with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Oh, really? Yeah.",
        "Tony: Let go of me.",
        "Parker: You need to man up.",
        "Tony: About what?",
        "Parker: Liberty. The kid's yours. You need to step up.",
        "Tony: How do I know it's mine? She could be doing the whole football team.",
        "Parker: Really? [Groaning]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey. Sorry I'm late.",
        "Brad: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Janet: I went by your house, actually.",
        "Brad: Well, what do you need?",
        "Janet: Well, I wanted to talk to you, but Katie said you were here already.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too. We need to figure out what to do about Liberty.",
        "Janet: Yes, Katie told me.",
        "Brad: I mean, I -- we all want the same thing, what's best for her.",
        "Janet: Yes. And my mistake was I didn't realize you have the same doubts as I have.",
        "Brad: What doubts?",
        "Janet: About the abortion.",
        "Brad: Well, who wouldn't? I mean, it's a very big deal.",
        "Janet: I know, but I didn't realize that you were against it.",
        "Brad: Who told you that?",
        "Janet: Katie. She said there was no way she would ever go down that road.",
        "Brad: For herself.",
        "Janet: And Liberty.",
        "Brad: She said that?",
        "Janet: Yeah, she did. So I thought that she should go talk to Liberty and try to talk some sense into her.",
        "Brad: She's gonna try to talk her out of it.",
        "Janet: Liberty's probably on her way there right now.",
        "Brad: You know what? You know what, you get my wife to do your dirty work?",
        "Janet: It's not dirty work.",
        "Brad: Well, whatever it is, it's totally out of line, Janet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thanks for coming by to get this. You want something to drink? Water or tea? I've been drinking this pregnancy tea.",
        "Liberty: Pregnancy tea?",
        "Katie: Yeah, it's great for when your stomach's kind of queasy.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, tea might not be such a bad idea.",
        "Katie: So have you been feeling a little wobbly?",
        "Liberty: I'm just ready for this to be over.",
        "Katie: You know, the uncomfortable part didn't last that long for me. Maybe like six weeks, I guess?",
        "Liberty: You know I'm not going through with this, right?",
        "Katie: I know you're thinking about it.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm pretty sure. My dad said he's behind me all the way, so --",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Katie: It's just that sometimes you don't know what's gonna happen.",
        "Liberty: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Katie: You know, for years, I tried not to get pregnant, and then when I finally wanted to, I couldn't. I tried everything, and then I finally just gave up. But now I have this miracle.",
        "Liberty: That's really great for you.",
        "Katie: I'm just saying that sometimes, we don't realize how much we want something until we don't have it.",
        "Liberty: Wait. I didn't have to come over here to get something, right? My mom put you up to this, didn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal: He's all yours, Mr. Snyder. You, come with me.",
        "Parker: He had it coming.",
        "Jack: That's your explanation?",
        "Parker: He's been telling the entire school that Liberty's pregnant.",
        "Jack: Parker, she is.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but that's nobody's business.",
        "Jack: So you beat him up? In school?",
        "Parker: She didn't want anyone to know.",
        "Jack: What does this have to do with you?",
        "Parker: She's family.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and you promised you wouldn't get caught up in Liberty's problems. What happened to that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Since when are we open to new investors?",
        "Henry: Okay, maybe we didn't have that exact conversation.",
        "Craig: We didn't have anything even remotely like it.",
        "Henry: You're not a co-owner. You don't get to make decisions.",
        "Craig: Carly gave me her power of attorney, which puts me in charge of her business affairs.",
        "Audrey: Hey, you could handle my affairs anytime you like.",
        "Henry: My God, Mother, not now, please.",
        "Ralph: Can I make a suggestion?",
        "Craig: Sure, if it has to do with you leaving.",
        "Ralph: I'm really starting to dislike your attitude.",
        "Craig: All the more reason to leave and not come back.",
        "Ralph: Look, my friend --",
        "Craig: I'm not your friend.",
        "Henry: Hey, you know what, let's all calm down. For your own good.",
        "Craig: I don't need your advice.",
        "Henry: I think maybe this one time, you do.",
        "Craig: I don't know why you brought this guy here.",
        "Henry: Look, he's a friend of my mom's, and he's just trying to help me out.",
