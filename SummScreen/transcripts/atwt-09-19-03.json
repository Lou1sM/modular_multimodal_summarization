        "Mike knocked out Mordecai, then rescued Katie. They heard Simon calling out for Katie, but Mike carried her out before they could find him. Just then, the building exploded. Katie told Mike she hated him for cheating her out of a final moment with her husband, and accused him of only saving her because he wanted her for himself. As Henry listened in, Carly confronted Craig, saying he needs to work things out with his wife. Molly suggested that, instead of giving up the bar, Craig should use a baby broker to find a baby to adopt. Although it could be illegal, Craig agreed, and told Rosanna that he has found a Canadian lawyer who thinks he can help them. Rose broke off Paul's kiss, and told him to go. Dusty saw him leaving, and, when Rose was too shaken to say what happened, he punched Paul. Paul told Dusty that he and Rose had kissed. Rose asked why he had kissed her, and he reminded her that she kissed him. He admitted he is not over her, and believed she isn't over him. She denied this, and ran out in tears. Molly made a pass at Dusty, but he turned her down. Henry told Paul about the pass, and Paul decided to have a talk with Molly. Chris worried that Alison is taking on too much responsibility, but she insisted she is fine. He told her he is staying at Tom and Margo's while they are gone."

        "Mordecai: Yeah, listen up, Frasier, I've got your wife down here with me at the warehouse. I thought you might like to know, she's sitting on enough c-4 plastique to blow her to kingdom come. So you've got, oh, just under ten minutes to grow a backbone and get down here or the missus goes up in smoke.",
        "Mike: Make one move and I will cut you open so wide they'll know exactly what you had for breakfast. Do it. Do it. I dare you.",
        "Mordecai: Easy up with the knife, mate.",
        "Mike: Shut up. Don't move. Looks like you won't be blowing anybody up today, mate.",
        "Mordecai: Beg to differ with you there, my heroic buddy.",
        "Mike: What are you talking about?",
        "Mordecai: Little precaution I took, in case of emergency. Once that remote's switched off, the bomb switches to its own automatic timing device.",
        "Mike: You're lying.",
        "Mordecai: 'Fraid not. But if you'd like to hang around for another, oh, four minutes, you can find out for yourself.",
        "Mike: Where is Katie? Where is she? If you do not tell me where she is, I am gonna kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Simon? Simon! Is that you? Please, just stay away! Just don't come in here, please. [Beeping] oh, my God. Oh, my God. Simon, is that you?",
        "Simon: Katie? Katie, where are you?",
        "Katie: Simon, please, just stay away. Don't look in here. Mike? Mike! The bomb! It's about to go off.",
        "Mike: Don't worry. I know, I know. I'm gonna get you out before anything happens.",
        "Katie: Simon's in here. He's in here.",
        "Mike: How do you know?",
        "Katie: I heard him. I heard his voice. We can't leave here. We have to find him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You need to get a lot of sleep, don't you? Mm-hmm. When you grow up, you're gonna be big and strong. Then your auntie Rosanna can take you shopping. Hmm, yes, you like that idea, don't you? You and I are going to have so much fun. And I promise you, I will always be there for you when you need me, okay? Okay.",
        "Carly: How's it going?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, hi. Hi. It's wonderful. She's wonderful.",
        "Carly: Yeah?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Hey. Hey, there's your mother.",
        "Carly: Oh, you have the magic touch, Rosanna. She's so peaceful when she's around you.",
        "Rosanna: She makes me feel very peaceful, too. I wish Craig could see me with her. Maybe then he'd change his mind about adopting, you know?",
        "Carly: You miss him, don't you?",
        "Rosanna: Sometimes. Which is odd, really, because I always seem to be much happier when he's not around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Have you seen Rosanna?",
        "Molly: No. Nice to see you, too, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, no, it's just that I've been everywhere looking for her all day, and --",
        "Molly: You know, if I were you, I would stop looking for her and wait for her to come to me.",
        "Craig: She went off in a huff. I just have to know she's all right, that's all.",
        "Molly: Buddy, stop crawling. It's really not very attractive.",
        "Craig: At least I'm not paying for it.",
        "Molly: What the hell's that supposed to mean?",
        "Craig: Meaning investing in a club might just buy you a little quality time with Dusty.",
        "Molly: You know, you better just back off, partner, 'cause I don't like where that is headed.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe Dusty is more muffin than stud, anyway.",
        "Molly: For your information, Dusty is amazing. The best I've had in bed since -- don't you have a bridge to sell to somebody somewhere?",
        "Craig: How could I leave when you're just about to tell me all your secrets?",
        "Craig: I don't blame you. Sexual compatibility can be a powerful thing. Does Dusty feel the same way?",
        "Molly: You know, I'm warning you, Craig. One more word out of you, and I'm going to brain you with a bar stool.",
        "Henry: Oh, I had no idea this was going to be so much fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: That didn't happen. Y'hear me? That kiss that just happened, that never happened!",
        "Dusty: Rose. What happened?",
        "Rose: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Dusty: Did he do something to hurt you, or what? Did he?",
        "Rose: No.",
        "Dusty: All right, all right. I'll get the answer my way.",
        "Rose: No, no, Dusty, no. No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: There's nothing wrong with missing your husband. And whatever you feel, whatever it is, you don't have to hide it from me.",
        "Rosanna: No matter how ridiculous it might seem?",
        "Carly: Ridiculous? You want to hear ridiculous, I have some stories that would throw your back out.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I'll tell you. While I was holding Sage, I was fantasizing that Craig showed up and saw me with her and said what a good mommy I would be. And then, we go get on a plane and pick up our own baby.",
        "Carly: It's not your fault that Craig doesn't want another child. And if you have those maternal instincts, you have to listen to them.",
        "Rosanna: You're right. He just has this talent for making me doubt what I know is true.",
        "Carly: Are you busy this afternoon?",
        "Rosanna: No, I took the day off. Why?",
        "Carly: Great. I -- would you mind watching Sage for me?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, I would be happy to, but are you sure?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yeah, I'm sure. I've just got a couple of errands to do, I'll be back in a flash.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. What if she wakes up and wants her mommy?",
        "Carly: Follow your instincts. See you. I didn't want to do this, Craig. But it's time I stepped in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imaginary James: Splendid work, splendid work. And very soon, you'll be celebrating because you will be getting the revenge you deserve.",
        "Paul: I don't want it anymore. I don't want anything to do with Rose or Dusty. Really, the whole thing is just way too intense for me.",
        "Imaginary James: But that'll only last a short while. Once you've destroyed their relationship, they'll be out of your life forever. Unless -- wait, wait, wait. Wait. She still gets to you, doesn't she? Rose.",
        "Paul: Just leave me alone.",
        "Imaginary James: Have you forgotten what Dusty and Rose did to you? They broke you. They humiliated you. You crept out of town. Paul, they have to be punished. It's -- it's only right.",
        "Paul: Leave me alone! [Knock on door] who is it?",
        "Dusty: Dusty. Gotta talk to you. What happened between you and my girlfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: We'll look for Simon on the way out. We can't waste time. This thing's going to go off in three minutes.",
        "Katie: No! No, no, Simon came here to rescue me. I'm not leaving without -- how did that blood get on your knife?",
        "Mike: Mordecai wouldn't tell me where you were.",
        "Katie: Did you --?",
        "Mike: No, no, no, I didn't. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.",
        "Katie: Simon! Simon, are you still here?",
        "Mike: You get out of here, you get out of here. I will find Simon.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. I can't let you do that. No wait, hold on. Can't we just -- can't you figure out how to take out the wires or something? Make it stop.",
        "Mike: There's no way. I touch the wrong wire, we are both gonna die.",
        "Simon: Katie? Answer me. Are you in here?",
        "Katie: Simon! Simon, wait, there's a bomb! Please get out of here as fast as you can.",
        "Mike: All right, I'm sure he heard you. Let's go.",
        "Simon: If you can hear me, Katie, I'm coming for you. Please, don't move!",
        "Mike: Simon, find another door! Katie's okay! Come on.",
        "Katie: No, you go by yourself. I am waiting. I am waiting for Simon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Molly, you're a beautiful woman, with a bank book as thick as the -- but I don't care if Dusty can do backflips off a headboard, you're still crazy to be going after him.",
        "Molly: When did I say I was going after Dusty, Craig?",
        "Craig: Then tell me why you invested in this club without even looking at the books.",
        "Carly: I don't even know why I am still talking to you, Craig, but for my sister's sake, I'm gonna give this -- I'm gonna give it one more shot.",
        "Craig: Have you seen her?",
        "Carly: Yeah. She's at my place. She's looking after Sage.",
        "Craig: Is she coming home?",
        "Carly: I don't know. Right now, she needs the closeness of a child, the comfort of a family, and clearly you can't give her that, so she had to look elsewhere.",
        "Craig: I am going to make her happy, but what kind of ritual sacrifice do I have to perform on myself here?",
        "Carly: What about a little night club? Can you sacrifice a little night club?",
        "Craig: The point is, if she has to dictate every --",
        "Carly: But she doesn't want that. All she wants is for you to show her that your marriage is important to you.",
        "Craig: I have talked --",
        "Carly: Talking -- talking isn't gonna do anything. You have to get yourself out of the bar business today and start working on your relationship.",
        "Molly: Oh, how you sisters are sticking together. You know, it's really amazing that you have time for anybody else. Oops, that's right. You don't. I forgot.",
        "Carly: Molly. Hitching your wagon to Dusty and Craig is one of the lamest things you've ever done, and there's still a way you can fix it.",
        "Molly: Oh, what might that be?",
        "Carly: Buy him out. Send Craig home to his wife.",
        "Molly: To do what? Help Rosanna? Why in the world would I want to do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Your mother admitted to you that she was tempted to drink, but didn't. Okay, that kind of honesty is crucial to staying sober. You know, maybe she's out of danger.",
        "Alison: Or maybe when she was going downstairs and she found us there, she was on her way to get more vodka to replace what she threw out. Chris, alcoholics are really good at lying. They can fool anyone, even people that know them really well.",
        "Chris: Well, have you discussed it with Emily?",
        "Alison: Yeah, only about, like, ten times a day. But I'm the one who's living there, which means, I'm the one who needs to make sure that she stays sober.",
        "Chris: Well, then maybe you should move out.",
        "Alison: I can't. Chris, she needs me. I have to be there.",
        "Chris: Alison, listen to me, okay? You have a life of your own. If you give it up to take care of her, then, you know, then neither of you are gonna be happy.",
        "Alison: Then what do you think I should do?",
        "Chris: I think that you should move out as soon as you can.",
        "Alison: Are you saying what I think you're saying?",
        "Chris: Probably not. What do you think I'm saying?",
        "Alison: That the two of us should move in together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So -- you wanna know what happened? What happened was that Rose and I -- we were having an argument, see?",
        "Dusty: Over what?",
        "Paul: Well, I told her that -- that I didn't think that you could be trusted.",
        "Dusty: She's heard that before. But it never affected her like this.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, this is just, you know, the straw that broke the camel's back. You know what that means, right?",
        "Dusty: I didn't wanna do this, but you're not giving me a choice.",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Rose: Dusty, are you in there?",
        "Paul: Come on in, Rose. You're just in time to ring the bell for the first round.",
        "Rose: What are you -- what did you do? What did you do?",
        "Dusty: Hey, relax! I am trying to figure out what's going on between you two. I tried to figure it out the nice way. It didn't work. Nobody told me what's up. So now I'm trying the hard way.",
        "Rose: Let me just talk to Paul alone, okay? Please go, Dusty. Please.",
        "Dusty: Baby, I'm not going anywhere until somebody tells me what's going on. What did he do that's got you so rattled?",
        "Paul: We were kissing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Molly, I know that it bothers you that I care about my sister. But I cannot let that stop me from helping her any way I can.",
        "Molly: Knock yourself out. Let her use you all she wants. Just don't ask me to pitch in.",
        "Carly: I assure you, it won't happen again. Rosanna loves you. I don't have the foggiest idea why. It's not my place to ask the question. But as strong as that love is, it can be lost.",
        "Craig: Well, I -- I don't want that.",
        "Carly: Well, she doesn't want it, either. But that's where you're headed, unless you go to her and you admit that you were wrong. Start acting like a husband. Find a way to make her believe that you will do anything to win her back.",
        "Craig: \"Anything\" is a mighty big word.",
        "Carly: Craig -- your marriage is in really, really big trouble. Now, you can stand your ground, and you can watch it slip away. Or you can do something. Do something that makes Rosanna believe you're worth keeping. If you love your wife, you have to make a choice.",
        "Craig: Will you tell Rosanna --",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Craig -- tell her yourself.",
        "Craig: I have to go.",
        "Molly: Don't tell me you actually bought what she was saying!",
        "Craig: If giving up a bar is what it's gonna take, then that's what I'm gonna do.",
        "Molly: Oh, no. See, she won't respect that, Craig. Women don't want a guy that they can push around.",
        "Craig: So what do you want me to do to show her that she's important to me?",
        "Molly: Do what she wants. Give her a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: We don't have time to argue about this! If you don't come with me now, you are gonna die!",
        "Katie: Just hold on! Simon, just let me know you can hear me! I'm not leaving! Hey, stop it! Stop, please! Let me go! Simon is still in there! I'm not gonna let him die!",
        "Mike: There's nothing we can do! This place is gonna blow!",
        "Simon: Katie?!",
        "Katie: Simon!",
        "Simon: Katie!",
        "Katie: Simon -- Simon! Simon!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You kept me from having one last moment with Simon, and for that, I hate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: That kiss -- not your kiss or my kiss, but our kiss -- it has obviously had some kind of effect on you.",
        "Dusty: This girl would've dropped you if you tried to kiss her. Somebody's gonna tell me what happened before I showed up here.",
        "Rose: You know, why don't we do this? Why don't you go back to Java underground? And I will talk to Paul, and then I will tell you everything, I promise.",
        "Dusty: Was it a peck on the cheek? Or was it a juicy one, on the mouth? Rose? Am I right? Yes or no?",
        "Rose: Yes. No, no -- no, hold on a second. That's not gonna help anything. Please, don't fight.",
        "Dusty: You messed up.",
        "Rose: No, no, no. You cannot fight. Because if you fight, you're gonna lose the bar. And I'm not protecting him. I'm protecting you. No fighting.",
        "Dusty: I don't know where or when -- but you and me, we're gonna go.",
        "Rose: Oh, come on, please. Please.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Paul: Boy, can he light up a room or what?",
        "Rose: What is with you? What is with you? We were fighting -- you and me, fighting like cats and dogs. And then you kissed me.",
        "Paul: No, Rose. You kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Living with you would be a lot of fun. Okay? And maybe it will happen someday.",
        "Alison: Okay, I get it. I'm sorry that I even brought this up. You were, like, a million miles away from asking me to move in with you, right?",
        "Chris: Alison, I haven't been this excited about a woman in a really long time. Okay? But you and I are just starting out. All right? I don't wanna get ahead of ourselves.",
        "Alison: A woman?",
        "Chris: Yeah. I mean, after our night at the cottage, there's no turning back.",
        "Alison: I like that you're being honest with me. So -- I guess I should be honest right back. Even though I really wanted you to ask me to move in with you, I don't think I would even be able to say yes.",
        "Chris: You wouldn't?",
        "Alison: Well, my mom and I used to fight a lot, but I was always just really proud of her. And when she gave up drinking, she totally turned her life around. And -- but now she's -- she's just been hurting a lot, and there's a chance that she could just lose everything she's worked so hard for. And that's why I have to be there. And if it means being home for as long as it takes, then that's what I gotta do.",
        "Craig: You know, given my police record, adopting a baby may not be an option.",
        "Molly: Well, Craig, I been thinking about it. You know? And there's many ways to get a baby. Though it could involve some risk.",
        "Craig: Well, I have nothing against reasonable risk.",
        "Molly: Okay, hear me out. Last year, I did a story at WOAK about these baby brokers -- these lawyers that cut corners to speed up the adoption process. And if you want -- I mean, I could give the guy I interviewed a call and see if he could help you out?",
        "Craig: Partner?",
        "Molly: Think about it, though. Okay? Because it's not gonna be easy. It will be expensive. And it could be breaking the law.",
        "Craig: So?",
        "Molly: Where are you going?",
        "Craig: I'm gonna tell Rosanna the -- the good news.",
        "Henry: Cutting corners to speed up an adoption? And accuse me of being sleazy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Did you find Simon?",
        "Mike: Look, I checked everywhere. I got as close to the fire as I could. There's no sign of him.",
        "Katie: Oh, God. He's gone. Mike, he's gone. And it's all my fault! Oh, God. He was right there. I heard his voice. We didn't even get to -- this does not feel real. This does not feel real.",
        "[Katie sobbing]",
        "Mike: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Katie.",
        "Katie: I just wanted to see him one more time. You knew that! Why didn't you let me do that, Mike?!",
        "Mike: Well, the building was about to explode! I was just trying to save your life!",
        "Katie: Just one more second would've been fine. I just wanted to hold him again and tell him I loved him. And if we died, we'd die together.",
        "Mike: I -- I know you're upset. And I understand that. But -- but you're alive. I'm not gonna apologize for keeping you alive.",
        "Katie: Oh, you want me to be grateful for you for saving my life? I'm sorry, Mike. I can't do that. You kept me from having one last moment with Simon, and for that, I hate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I know what it's like when your parents need you. Okay, Alison? But looking after an alcoholic is a big job. I just -- I hope it's not too much for you.",
        "Alison: I can handle it, Chris. But it's sweet for you to worry.",
        "Chris: Well -- it's not all about you.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Chris: Well -- one thing about having sex -- once you have it, the more you want to keep having it.",
        "Alison: I know what you mean.",
        "Chris: And with you looking after your mother --",
        "Alison: No, I know. And that's what I was trying to tell you before. Because I'm still gonna make sure that there's time for us, Chris. And Emily said that she can cover for me if I need her to.",
        "Chris: Well, I'm really glad to hear that. Now I've got a surprise for you. You want to take a guess at what these unlock?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Whoa. Hey, come on. I've been there. And I've gotta tell ya that when you drink your troubles away, you're really just trading one problem for another.",
        "Dusty: I'd call it a fair trade. I'm not even looking for trouble. And the guy's asking for it, so -- I'm gonna bring it.",
        "Molly: Who? Who is?",
        "Dusty: Paul.",
        "Molly: What'd he do?",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: I don't wanna talk about it.",
        "Molly: Did he hurt Rose? No, of course he didn't, because then you'd be in jail for killing him.",
        "Dusty: Well, don't rule it out. Still might go down.",
        "Molly: Why? You know, we're partners now. We're supposed to share.",
        "Dusty: They were kissing.",
        "Molly: So where's Rose now?",
        "Dusty: In Paul's apartment. And then she's gonna meet me here.",
        "Molly: So, is that why you're drinking?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Molly: I see. You just don't like the idea of those two being alone together. [Dusty sighs] do you mind if I make a suggestion, Dusty? Don't get drunk. Get even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: You have a very short memory. I was yelling at you, and you turned it into a kiss.",
        "Paul: You could've stopped me. You could've. You could -- a well-placed knee. You could've kicked me in the -- shins",
        "Rose: Oh, no, no. You caught me by surprise. Another two seconds, you would've been on the ground, looking for your teeth.",
        "Paul: \"Surprise.\" That's why you were nervous. That's why you were flushed. Tell that to someone else. 'Cause I know every inch of your face by heart. I know every inch of all of you, Rose.",
        "Rose: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Paul: Doing what? You think I have some kind of a plan?",
        "Rose: I don't know. 'Cause that runs -- that runs in your family.",
        "Paul: That's not me. It's not.",
        "Rose: I know you wanna cause trouble for Dusty and me because we hurt you. He broke us up. You've suffered. You said you were over it. You'd gotten past it. I was hoping that was true.",
        "Paul: I was hoping so, too. I -- it's not the first time, you know? It's not -- I'm starting to think that I'm just not someone who gets what they hope for.",
        "Rose: What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: I'm just not convinced that I'm over you the way I thought I was.",
        "Rose: You know, I've gotta tell you something. That kiss that we shared -- it meant nothing. Zilch. Kissing you was like drinking a flat can of soda. No fizz left.",
        "Paul: So -- if there's no fizz, how come you didn't just leave with Dusty?",
        "Rose: Because I wanted you to know where I stood.",
        "Paul: Yeah, where is that? Where do you stand, Rose? 'Cause I know that you're not as over me as you think you are.",

        "Carly: Hey. So, how'd it go? Where's Sage?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, she's upstairs. I let her play with that little mirror toy. She likes it very much. How were your errands?",
        "Carly: Fine. [Knock at door] who is it?",
        "Craig: Mr. Rosanna.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, yes, yes! You have to see him.",
        "Craig: Carly, I need to talk to Rosanna.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'll be right upstairs, then, if you need me.",
        "Craig: I need to talk -- about you and me.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's going to be a very short conversation, because I have nothing to say.",
        "Craig: All right, well, just listen, then, all right?",
        "Rosanna: You said \"talk,\" not \"touch.\"",
        "Craig: Are you going to listen?",
        "Rosanna: I'm not making any promises.",
        "Craig: I have a solution. I have a lawyer who is going to help us.",
        "Rosanna: Help us how?",
        "Craig: Find a baby to adopt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I know I've said it, like, a hundred times. But I guess I gotta keep saying it until it sinks in. What you and I had is over. All the feelings are gone. There's nothing left but memories for us.",
        "Paul: I have my own memories. I have memories of praying that the night wouldn't end. And spending all next day wishing that I could get you back in my bed. Now, you're gonna tell me that -- that there's not a part of you that misses that?",
        "Rose: I don't miss it. I don't miss you.",
        "Paul: See, I -- that kiss -- not your kiss or my kiss, but our kiss -- it has obviously had some kind of effect on you.",
        "Rose: Just -- I just gotta go. But the next time Dusty wants to rearrange your face, just don't expect me to --",
        "Paul: Please. Don't go.",
        "Rose: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't -- look, you're a part of me. And I can't do it -- I can't. I try, and I can't -- shake you loose.",
        "Rose: I know. I know you got problems. And I know they're because of me, and I hate that. Believe me. But I can't -- I can't do this. I can't listen to this. You gotta find somebody else who's gonna listen to you -- a priest, a friend, anybody. But I can't do this anymore. Please don't come to me with this anymore!",

        "Alison: Well, they couldn't be your house. 'Cause what would be the big deal?",
        "Chris: Right.",
        "Alison: So someone's lending you their house?",
        "Chris: Keep going.",
        "Alison: A house for us to be alone?",
        "Chris: All right. Now, whose house is it?",
        "Alison: I've got it all figured out. It's Tom and Margo's house, right? Because they're going on vacation. And they're lending you their house. And that's where we're gonna be tonight?",
        "Chris: That's amazing.",
        "Alison: So where are they going? And -- and for how long?",
        "Chris: Well, they're gonna be gone for a week. And they were supposed to leave today to go to Hilton Head for a little vacation with the kids. So their house is ours. And my job is to water the plants and stuff. But I figure, as long as I do a good job, it's none of their business if I do some other activities.",
        "Alison: Absolutely not. I don't know what I'm getting so excited about, Chris. I can't go anywhere tonight unless Emily can watch my mom. We better pray she's available on really short notice.",

        "Mike: If it makes you feel better to say you hate me --",
        "Katie: I do hate you, Mike. I will never forgive you for what you did.",
        "Mike: But it wasn't me who killed Simon! I did everything I could to get you back to him.",
        "Katie: You dragged me out of that warehouse against my will! When I tried to go back in there, you pinned me to the ground! Simon was crying for help, cries that I will hear in my nightmares for the rest of my life. And you know what? When I hear his voice, I will remember who kept me from him.",
        "Mike: I did what I thought was right!",
        "Katie: No, you didn't. For you, yeah, Mike. Not for me.",
        "Mike: What are you saying?",
        "Katie: You didn't pull me out of that warehouse to keep me alive. You kept me alive 'cause you wanted me for yourself.",

        "Rosanna: You're working with a Canadian lawyer so that we can adopt a baby? Do you know what that sounds like to me, darling?",
        "Craig: It's the solution to our problems.",
        "Rosanna: It sounds like a desperate, self-serving lie in a long list of desperate, self-serving lies.",
        "Craig: I'm trying to make us happy! What are you talking about?",
        "Rosanna: I don't want to raise a baby with a father who doesn't want to be one.",
        "Craig: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Rosanna: What is it supposed to mean?! You had yourself arrested so it wouldn't happen!",
        "Craig: So it wouldn't happen so fast -- that's all! I love being a father. I want to share that with you. But I am a little nervous, all right? So can you give me a break?",
        "Rosanna: You know -- I don't know what to say. I -- I don't -- would you just leave? Just leave. I don't wanna talk about this anymore.",
        "Craig: All right. Okay, all right. All right, whatever you say. Carly did say that you were doing a -- a great job with Sage. Lucky kid.",
        "Craig: I got you. Now all I have to do is find us a baby.",

        "Dusty: I like being partners with you. Give me the bottle.",
        "Molly: I like being partners with you, too. But, you know, there's something I wanna tell you. I just think that Rose D'Angelo is -- just more trouble than you wanna handle right now.",
        "Dusty: Why's that?",
        "Molly: 'Cause I've been in this town a long time. And I know something for sure. I know that her sister, Lily, gets whatever she wants.",
        "Dusty: And what's that got to do with me?",
        "Molly: Well, because if Lily wants you out of Rose's life, then that's exactly where you're gonna be. Think about that. Then maybe next time I make a pass at you, you won't find it so funny.",

        "Henry: Yeah. Not only that, she's going to be the nanny for their daughter.",
        "Paul: No kidding?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. In addition, Molly McKinnon is gonna set Craig up with some kind of renegade lawyer, who can help them find him a baby.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Paul: I thought he didn't want any more children.",
        "Henry: Well, obviously, he's changed his mind. But wait, wait -- I'm not done. Molly is still hot for Dusty and made sure he was aware of it.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Henry: Know what I'm saying? I'm gonna need some more pads, by the way.",
