        "Barbara warns Dusty that having Lucy near Johnny is as dangerous as inviting Craig into his life. Dusty defends Lucy and Barbara backs down, so it seems, claiming she is simply worrying that they will forget Jen. Later, Barbara summons Lucinda in hopes she will help keep Lucy away from Dusty. Lucinda refuses. Dusty and Lucy make another date. Paul and Meg hide out in his apartment pretending to be in a romantic getaway to Hawaii. Emily goes to see Henry to cheer him up, but she really wants him to help her break into Paul's apartment to find out where he went. Henry and Emily dress in disguise and break into Paul's apartment. Meg orders Emily out but not before Emily gets some parting shots in taunting her over their supposed break up. Will pleads for Gwen to come back and talk to him; Gwen shows up to see Jade and they have it out. Gwen talks to Will and admits she loves him and can't imagine her life without him, she also knows she isn't big enough to stand by throughout their life together while Jade gives him something she will never be able to give him. Will begs for her to stay with him, but Gwen feels in the end she will be resentful of him, Jade and the baby and she would rather leave now then later. Will is heartbroken. Luke advises Jade not to get her hopes up even if she is pregnant because he saw Will and the way he talked about Gwen, and nothing will make him feel for her as he does for Gwen. Emily and Henry overhear Paul and Meg talking in his apartment after she left, and she barges back in to confront them and to promise them that noone makes a fool out of her!"

        "Dusty: Nobody needs to warn me about Craig Montgomery. And nobody needs to warn Lucy.",
        "Barbara: I'm just worried about my grandson.",
        "Dusty: Lucy would never let Craig use her to get to Johnny.",
        "Barbara: I don't think you're in any position to judge right now. You're still vulnerable.",
        "Dusty: You talking about me or you?",
        "Barbara: And rushing into a relationship --",
        "Dusty: A what?",
        "Barbara: Or whatever it is with Lucy --",
        "Dusty: There's nothing with Lucy -- she's trying to be a friend. The point is, it's none of your business.",
        "Barbara: We're all walking around in a fog since Jennifer --",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's dead. The only thing I can do for her now is take care of our son. Trust me to do that.",
        "Barbara: I do. But putting Lucy into this equation complicates things --",
        "Dusty: Come on, enough! I don't want to hear it.",
        "Lucy: I do. If Barbara's got more to say about me, I think I should hear it for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, Henry, you're here. You just took so long to answer the door. And you're sitting in the dark.",
        "Henry: When did they spring you from the hospital, Em?",
        "Emily: Please, I don't want to talk about me. How are you holding up?",
        "Henry: Okay. I just got back from Chicago. I had to tell the sisters what really happened with eve.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, that must've been brutal. You know what? We need to find a way for you to forget your troubles for a while.",
        "Henry: Well, you know me, Em. I forget my troubles by starting with an \"M\" and ends with an \"ini.\"",
        "Emily: No, no, actually, I was thinking something a little more nonalcoholic. You need a friend, Henry. A good friend. And you're the best one I've got.",
        "Henry: It's not exactly a feather in your cap, Em.",
        "Emily: Honey, I'm worried about you. Sitting alone in this room -- in the dark, drinking. You know what you need? You need an adventure.",
        "Henry: No, I don't.",
        "Emily: Yes, you do.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. No adventures.",
        "Emily: You need a full blown, old fashioned, dust-off-your-maid's uniform adventure.",
        "Henry: Well, I retired the maid's uniform, okay? By the way, I've got housemaid's knee. It's a debilitating condition. It's a terrible thing --",
        "Emily: Paul's missing in action.",
        "Henry: Missing as in missing -- \"without a trace\" missing?",
        "Emily: No -- I mean, I don't know. He said he was taking a trip. He said that he and Meg needed to have some time apart from each other.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Emily: Really. I mean, that's what he said. But he didn't say where he was going. That's why I need you to pick up his scent.",
        "Henry: Oh, Em, that is wrong on so many levels.",
        "Emily: Henry, please, please. I need to find Paul as much as you need a reason to get out of this room and live your life again. Come on, Henry. For old times' sake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg laughing]",
        "Meg: Memo to Paul -- we are still in Oakdale.",
        "Paul: Really? 'Cause it feels like heaven.",
        "Meg: Until the phone rings --",
        "Paul: Well, we don't actually answer the phone.",
        "Meg: Or Emily comes banging on the door.",
        "Paul: No, I took care of that -- I talked to Coop.",
        "Meg: The doorman?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I gave him a big tip and I told him that if a crazy, pregnant, blonde lady shows up, I'm on vacation.",
        "Meg: For how long?",
        "Paul: For as long as we want.",
        "Meg: So we're actually hiding out?",
        "Paul: Yeah. And then, you know, we'll get you some vacation and I'll whisk you away to paradise.",
        "Meg: Remember when we were going to Fiji?",
        "Paul: How could I forget? Oh, that's a good idea. I'll order up a hula skirt and a box of pineapples.",
        "Meg: Isn't that more like Hawaii?",
        "Paul: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you just said. I just -- I can see you in a grass skirt.",
        "Meg: Well, then we'll stick with Hawaii. What, am I supposed to be doing a hula dance or something?",
        "Paul: Yeah, can you do that? Show me your moves.",
        "Meg: Only if you show me yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, it's me again. We really need to talk. I'll meet you anywhere you want. Please, just call me.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Luke: You okay?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Jade forgot her sweater, so -- look, I know. Jade, she just told me that -- that she's pregnant.",
        "Will: Did she add that my life is now worth exactly nothing? Thanks to Jade, I've used up my last chance with Gwen. And this time, there's no going back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: What do you want?",
        "Gwen: I want to know what I did to you. I tried to be your friend. I gave you a place to live. I stood up for you when people said what a liar and a user that you were.",
        "Jade: I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Gwen: Oh, no? Then explain something to me. I get one thing -- one good thing walks into my life and you take it away. Why, Jade? Huh? Do you hate me that much?",
        "Jade: You're wrong, Gwen. I don't hate you.",
        "Gwen: You know what I think, Jade? I think that it was a setup from day one.",
        "Jade: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Gwen: From the minute that you gave Will that great advice about how to graduate.",
        "Jade: I was trying to help.",
        "Gwen: Yourself! You were trying to help yourself. You thought that if you could get him to cheat at school you could get him to cheat on me.",
        "Jade: I didn't get him to do anything. You pushed Will away that night.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you moved in awfully fast!",
        "Jade: You told Will that it was over.",
        "Gwen: You have no idea what was said between the two of us that night -- no idea.",
        "Jade: There was no setup, Gwen. I didn't intend on getting pregnant. It just happened!",
        "Gwen: How many guys, Jade? Huh? Since Will -- how many?",
        "Jade: There was nobody else.",
        "Gwen: So you'd be cool with a pregnancy, test?",
        "Jade: Yeah, now, if you want.",
        "Gwen: Too easy. You'd probably scam your way through that.",
        "Jade: Women who can't give a guy what he needs always blame those that do.",
        "Gwen: If you weren't pregnant --",
        "Jade: You'd what? Get off it, Gwen. You and I are not so different, and you have the history to prove it.",
        "Gwen: Casey was not married! We were not committed to other people when I got pregnant!",
        "Jade: Details. You love Will, right? If he comes through for this baby, you and I don't have a problem.",
        "Gwen: Does he have a choice?",
        "Jade: Yeah, guys always do. Or did you forget that, too?",
        "Gwen: Wow, you're loving this, aren't you? You think that this baby is gonna buy you all the things that you never had growing up.",
        "Jade: Yeah. Yeah, like I really want to blow up like a balloon and have no life. That's definitely my idea of a good time.",
        "Gwen: What is then? Wrecking lives?",
        "Jade: Whatever happens between you and Will, Gwen, live with it. I have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Let's see, what would be Paul's dream vacation? Maybe a quick jaunt to Transylvania?",
        "Emily: You know what? Forget it. Forget it. I will break into his apartment and I will find him all by myself.",
        "Henry: You must really love the sweet smell of a holding cell.",
        "Emily: What choice are you leaving me?",
        "Henry: Amnesia! Forget about Paul, come on --",
        "Emily: Henry, listen, I break into his apartment, I'm in there for ten minutes. That's all I need, ten minutes. I'll find the brochure, an itinerary, a receipt --",
        "Henry: Bread crumbs?",
        "Emily: You are the only one who knows how to break open a lock, Henry.",
        "Henry: We have been over this, Dorothy. Rational people do not break and enter. They ring the doorbell, they knock on the door.",
        "Emily: I would do that -- I would do that, but I don't know where he is and I need to find him. Because Dr. Schiller is making all this noise about genetic testing for my baby.",
        "Henry: Genetic testing, Dr. Schiller? Oh, my goodness! Where did you hear this, in a dream?",
        "Emily: Henry, it is the truth. I am telling you the truth. And I cannot make a decision about my baby without talking to him first. Once I'm in, I will take it from there.",
        "Henry: Take it where exactly?",
        "Emily: The less you know, the better.",
        "Henry: Oh, Sweetheart. Oh, take it from me -- someone who's been in the dark for a long time -- the less I know, usually the worse things are.",

        "[Hawaiian music plays]",
        "Meg: So, where'd you get the music?",
        "Paul: Are you serious?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I don't expect you to have this.",
        "Paul: When I was at BRO, there was a fabric supplier from Honolulu. He sent me a CD every Christmas.",
        "Meg: It creates quite a mood.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's the idea.",
        "Meg: It kind of makes me want to make love on the beach, under the stars.",
        "Paul: You know -- there are stars -- right there on the balcony, you know, out on the terrace.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, well, maybe you have neighbors -- out there on the balcony, on the terrace.",
        "Paul: Well, we'll just turn all the lights off and be really, really quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I promised her that I was going to make her life easier, and all I did was make it worse.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe you can still keep that promise.",
        "Will: And keep Jade in the picture?",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Will: It's Gwen. Thank you. Thank you for calling me back --",
        "Gwen: Where are you?",
        "Will: I'm still at the church.",
        "Gwen: We need to talk. I'm on my way.",
        "Will: Gwen's on her way.",
        "Luke: Well, that's -- that's a good sign.",
        "Will: You think so? I'm afraid to get my hopes up.",
        "Luke: Will, I really hope you guys can work through this.",
        "Will: Yeah, me, too. And thanks, Luke.",
        "Luke: For what?",
        "Will: For what you didn't say.",

        "Barbara: You have no idea what life has been like for us these past weeks.",
        "Dusty: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: We smile, Lucy, a lot. We pretend that our hearts aren't breaking, for Johnny. We pretend we're a happy family, for Johnny.",
        "Lucy: I know how hard it must be.",
        "Barbara: Like hell you do! You have never buried a child.",
        "Dusty: You want to get mad, you can be mad at me.",
        "Barbara: I'm mad at life.",
        "Dusty: How is that Lucy's fault?",
        "Barbara: I'm afraid she's going to take advantage of Jennifer's death so you two can cozy up and stroll down memory lane --",
        "Dusty: Oh, you don't need to hear this -- trust me. I'll walk you out. I'll walk you out. What can I say? Sorry.",
        "Lucy: Look, I understand how she feels.",
        "Dusty: Still, that's more than she deserves.",
        "Lucy: It is soon --",
        "Dusty: Soon for what, a movie? There was a moment -- a few moments that I -- I wasn't reaching out for Jen's hand.",
        "Lucy: Is that good?",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Lucy: I don't want to cause a problem with you and Barbara. You two need each other right now.",
        "Dusty: I need all the friends I can get. And I think Jen would approve of you being one of them. You pull a stunt like that again, and we're out of here.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so blunt. I should've made it clear to Lucy -- it's not about her personally.",
        "Dusty: You sure?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I am sure. You know, I just don't understand how you can think that it means nothing that she's Craig's daughter. Johnny is his son.",
        "Dusty: Johnny's my son.",
        "Barbara: Craig doesn't care about some legal document that you and Jennifer signed. He cares about flesh and blood.",
        "Dusty: Lucy cut him loose. He's doing time in jail. He ain't getting out.",
        "Barbara: How can you really be sure that she cut him off? He's her father.",
        "Dusty: I believe her.",
        "Barbara: And what if some day he sends her some tearjerker letter wanting to know how big he is, how many new words he knows --",
        "Dusty: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Barbara: You know, letting Lucy in your life is the closest thing to letting Craig back into this little boy's life. Jennifer would never risk Johnny's safety.",
        "Dusty: Stop beating it, would you? You're not afraid of Craig or Lucy. You're afraid that I'm gonna forget about Jen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, are we celebrating or drowning sorrows?",
        "Lucy: Neither. What are you doing up so late?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, a long, long miserable board meeting.",
        "Lucy: It's past your bedtime.",
        "Lucinda: If you say so.",
        "Lucy: Another white wine, please?",
        "Lucinda: Vodka. Why are you drinking alone?",
        "Lucy: I'm not alone.",
        "Lucinda: Oh? How was the movie?",
        "Lucy: You'll never guess who I ran into.",
        "Lucinda: Dusty?",
        "Lucy: What are the odds?",
        "Lucinda: I'd say that fate was giving you a little push.",
        "Lucy: Oh, Grandmother --",
        "Lucinda: Well, what do you think?",
        "Lucy: Dumb luck. He invited me upstairs and I got bounced by Barbara.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me, Barbara bounced you? Why?",
        "Lucy: Basically, she resents the fact that I'm alive and Jennifer isn't.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey. How ugly did that get?",
        "Lucy: Dusty ushered me out before she drew blood.",
        "Lucinda: And before Barbara, how was it?",
        "Lucy: Pretty nice, actually.",
        "Lucinda: How nice?",
        "Lucy: Almost like old times.",
        "Lucinda: Do I have to drag this out of you syllable by syllable?",
        "Lucy: Okay, okay, you're right. You've always been right. I am still in love with Dusty. I never stopped loving him.",

        "Paul: There you go.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Paul: If I haven't told you in two minutes or so -- I love you.",
        "Meg: I love you, too. Did you also order that moon over there?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I did. I ordered the moon and the stars and little old me \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: All right, Henry, enough! I cannot believe the doorman thought I was Barbara.",
        "Henry: It was the prop.",
        "Emily: Okay, it was the prop.",
        "Henry: Yeah, the blind bit always works. He was so busy watching me tap around as Barbara's blind cousin, he wasn't even looking at you.",
        "Emily: Okay, give me the shades. Lose the shades, lose the stick -- open the door, come on.",
        "Henry: Yeah, hold this.",
        "Emily: So what are you gonna use, huh? Credit card, pick?",
        "Henry: This is your last chance to back out.",
        "Emily: Just do it. You know, I was thinking, Henry, maybe I'll make you the godfather of the baby.",
        "Henry: Oh, what'll I have to do for that, rob a bank?",
        "Emily: Ooh, Uncle Henry. I like the sound of that.",
        "Henry: Uncle pushover is more like it. Yeah, I should have these hands insured. And you are in.",
        "Emily: Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Henry: All right, why don't you just grab whatever you need to get and let's get out -- here that? There's music. What is it, luau night?",
        "Emily: You know what? Paul, he does that, he puts on music or the television or something when he leaves town. It's okay.",
        "Henry: Is he too cheap to get a security system? Messy packer, too.",
        "Emily: Exactly. Fine, okay? A messy packer -- everything.",
        "Henry: Look, why don't you just rummage around and hack and spy, and do whatever you need to do. I will be out in the hallway.",
        "Emily: Take the stuff. Go, go, go. Not that. Take this. Go!",
        "Henry: Goodness gracious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What was that?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Paul, where are you? You must've left a clue somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's Emily.",
        "Meg: I thought you changed the locks.",
        "Paul: Yeah, no, I did. I did.",
        "Meg: How'd she get in?",
        "Paul: I have no idea.",
        "Meg: Great. Now what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will --",
        "Will: Hey, you came. You okay? Where'd you go?",
        "Gwen: I saw Jade.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: There were some things that I needed to say.",
        "Will: You don't have to explain.",
        "Gwen: I'm not explaining.",
        "Will: Well, whatever you came back for, I'll take it. Just as long as you're here. Ever since you called, I've been sitting here, kind of trying to pray.",
        "Gwen: For what?",
        "Will: For us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"as the world turns\" --",
        "Paul: I promise you, everything is gonna be all right.",
        "Emily: He was in there the whole time with her?",
        "Lucy: Are you trying to cheer me up?",
        "Dusty: What are friends for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: 'Cause I'm never ever gonna feel this way about another girl. And being with you is all that I ever want.",
        "Will: I haven't prayed a lot in my life. It doesn't come easy. But tonight, I knew I needed some extra help from somewhere. So I sat here and I was trying to find the words to ask for a second chance. But it didn't feel right, because I think that it's not God I need forgiveness from -- it's you.",
        "Gwen: It doesn't really matter if I can forgive you or not.",
        "Will: What we're talking about here is the same mistake we got past the first time. It's just feels a whole lot worse because now there's a baby involved.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's right. A baby changes everything.",
        "Will: What? Say it.",
        "Gwen: Do you remember what it was like the first time that we brought Billy home?",
        "Will: Sure, I'll never forget.",
        "Gwen: We got close. Babies do that. Staying up all night, walking the floors together.",
        "Will: Sleeping in shifts.",
        "Gwen: Only this time, it's your baby -- with Jade.",
        "Will: Whatever plans I make, I'm making them with you, okay, not Jade. I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Gwen: I love you, too. What I learned these last few weeks is that I don't know how not to love you.",
        "Will: Thank you.",
        "Gwen: But it's not enough. I'm not that strong.",
        "Will: What do you mean?",
        "Gwen: It hurts too much. I cannot spend the rest of my life watching Jade give you the one thing that I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: It doesn't matter how I feel.",
        "Lucinda: Since when does love not matter?",
        "Lucy: Since the guy I'm in love with is still in love with his dead wife. You know, that first day at the hospital, when I heard his voice --",
        "Lucinda: And your earth moved?",
        "Lucy: My heart practically stopped. He was taking Johnny for a checkup. When he told me all about Jen and how in love they were, I pretended to be happy for him. I pretended a lot of things for a long time, grandmother. I can't -- I can't do it anymore.",
        "Lucinda: You don't have to. Just be his friend, and if something develops, when it develops, you'll know. But in the meantime, don't let Barbara bully you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You were right. I am sorry. I am afraid of us forgetting Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: Why? I mean, it can't happen.",
        "Barbara: It has. I try to remember the sound of her voice when she was 16, and I couldn't. So I dug up some old high school videos and put them on and cried until I couldn't anymore.",
        "Dusty: I just look into Johnny's eyes -- they're her eyes.",
        "Barbara: And her smile.",

        "Barbara: And sometimes I do. I can't help it.",
        "Dusty: It's not Lucy's fault. She's not spying on Craig. She's just a friend, that's all.",
        "Barbara: Please tell her I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: I will. And next time she comes around --",
        "Barbara: I'll be on my best behavior. I promise.",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna check on Johnny, and then I'm gonna take a walk.",
        "Barbara: Good, good.",
        "Dusty: You okay to watch him?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I'm fine. You could use a walk.",

        "Lucinda: Yes?",
        "Barbara: Hi, it's Barbara. Come up to my place right away. We've got a big problem.",

        "Meg: No, you stay here, and I'll get rid of her, okay?",
        "Paul: Let me take care of it.",
        "Meg: No, you stay on our island and I'll handle her. What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: Did you pick the lock?",
        "Emily: No, I did not pick the lock.",
        "Meg: Get out.",
        "Emily: Where's Paul?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I came by to pack a few things.",
        "Emily: Really, suddenly got the urge for a Polynesian polka?",
        "Meg: It was on when I got here, all right?",
        "Emily: Have you heard from him?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Emily: Do you know where he is?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Emily: I heard you the two of you are having some problems.",
        "Meg: Our problems are none of your business.",
        "Emily: Really? Well, when they force Paul out of town, they become my business. You see, Dr. Schiller has asked for some genetic testing on the baby. And I need to get in touch with Paul so I can get his input.",
        "Meg: Testing for what?",
        "Emily: Lots of things. It's none of your business, really.",
        "Meg: They wouldn't order any tests unless they thought there was a problem.",
        "Emily: When did you get your MD?",
        "Meg: I worked enough OB floors to know.",
        "Emily: Cleaning out bedpans does not qualify you to comment on me or my baby.",
        "Meg: Trumping up genetic testing is pretty low, even for you, Emily.",
        "Emily: Being jealous of a helpless baby is low, even for you, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know, let me put it in simple English so you get it this time -- Paul's commitment to the baby is not a commitment to you.",
        "Emily: Okay, fine. Fine, if you're not jealous of me and the baby and you know where Paul is, then why not tell me? Because if you don't, I'm gonna swing into plan \"B.\"",
        "Meg: Plan \"B\"?",
        "Emily: Yeah. I'm gonna tear this place apart and find out where he is for myself.",
        "Emily: My guess? He's not far.",
        "Meg: You're quite the detective.",
        "Emily: I'm thinking maybe an hour or two away by plane.",
        "Meg: Hey, put that down.",
        "Emily: You know what? It makes sense that you wouldn't know. I mean, you're the reason he's forced to leave town, so -- you know what? Why don't you run along? Go pack all your nighties. I'll do my own digging. Whoa -- what's that?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Emily: I understand him leaving you behind, but Paul would never leave his laptop.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe you don't know him as well as you think.",
        "Emily: I know he loves this child more than you could possibly imagine.",
        "Meg: You touch one more thing and I'm calling the cops.",
        "Emily: Ooh, Cousin Jack? I'm so scared.",
        "Meg: You know, jail's an odd choice for such a devoted mother in need of genetic testing, don't you think?",
        "Emily: Okay, fine. I'll go. Because, you know what? I think Paul will probably get in touch with me sooner or later, anyway.",
        "Meg: Maybe he will.",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm. And when he does, I'll be sure you say hi.",
        "Meg: You do that.",
        "Emily: Bye, Meg.",
        "Paul: Well, I'll use my cell phone and I'll call her in a couple of hours. And you won't have to deal with --",
        "Meg: With Emily? Of course I will, Paul. She's like death and taxes!",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Meg: I wanted to dropkick a very pregnant woman across the room. Does that sound like I'm okay? No, I'm not okay!",

        "Jade: Thanks.",
        "Luke: It was on the pew, just like you thought.",
        "Jade: Too bad you didn't get here a few seconds earlier. It was a real freak show.",
        "Luke: Huh?",
        "Jade: Gwen was here, and she's blaming me for everything.",
        "Luke: Oh -- well, are you surprised? I mean, Will and Gwen were just working things out, and then all of a sudden --",
        "Jade: It's not my fault.",
        "Luke: No, I didn't say it was. Just be prepared.",

        "Jade: You don't know that.",
        "Luke: Jade, I just saw the look on Will's face. He's all about Gwen. And you being pregnant, that doesn't change anything. I don't think anything could.",

        "Will: Gwen, don't leave, please.",
        "Gwen: There's nothing else to say, Will. We cannot fix things this time.",
        "Will: No, we can. I know we can. Just stay with me, all right? Please, just sit. Just being in the same place with you changes things.",
        "Gwen: How?",
        "Will: I don't know. I just feel okay, you know? Like I can breathe. It's like I know who I am when I'm with you.",
        "Gwen: I feel the same way. And I wish that was all it took, I really do. I've been going over the last few months in my head, and -- it was my fault, too. I put too much pressure on you -- to graduate and get a place to live. And maybe, if I hadn't --",
        "Will: No, this isn't your fault.",
        "Gwen: I tried to tell myself that I can be big about this. But then I think of you and Jade -- and your baby, all together --",
        "Will: Gwen, this baby is never going to replace what we had with Billy.",
        "Gwen: But it will. And it should. You'll be a real dad.",
        "Will: Yeah, but we're going to adopt some day and have a family of our own. The family that I want, the family I need with you.",
        "Gwen: Come on, Will. You can't write a few checks and then walk away. You're not that kind of guy. You were raised by a good dad.",
        "Will: I want to be a good husband, too. And there's got to be a way to do both. Because I'm never, ever going to feel this way about another girl. Not Jade, not anybody. I love you. And being with you is all that I ever want.",
        "Gwen: It's all I want, too. I wish that I could close my eyes right now and get lost with you. But I have a pretty good idea of how things are going to play out, and it is not a happy ending.",
        "Will: You don't know that.",
        "Gwen: Resentments build, Will. Slowly at first -- but then they become all that you know. That's what happened with my mom. Until one day, I couldn't stand the sight of her walking through the door. If I came home with you, maybe things would be okay for a while. But then I'd start to resent Jade, and then you, then the baby. That's no way to live. That's why I can't go home. So I would rather end things with us now than for us to end it like that.",
