        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, you broke my heart, Emily. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Our trip down memory lane's always going to be a bumpy one, Paul. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Is that your way of saying you're sorry? ",
        "\r\nEmily: What are you doing here? ",
        "\r\nPaul: My mother needed me. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Your mother needed you, so then you went and bought Fairwinds. Are you \r\nthat hung up on bad vibes? ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, she needed a secluded place where she could heal. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Sure, I'm sure she's happy to get out of the hospital. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Well, not right now. She's back in getting some preliminary skin grafting \r\ntests. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Ooh. That sounds awful. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, well, it's a painful process. But she has to do it in order to get \r\nher life back together. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, but it just seems so unfair that she has to suffer so much after \r\nwhat she's been through. ",
        "\r\nPaul: So don't destroy her, Emily. Please, for old times sake?",
        "",
        "\r\nJennifer: So -- what is the word for a girl like me? Enlightened? Or is it the \r\nbig bad \"b\" word? ",
        "\r\nBilly: You know, a girl who treats a guy who loves her the way you treat Bryant \r\nalready knows all the words. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: I don't care what you think of me. ",
        "\r\nBilly: Bryant's just not my cousin, okay? He's my best friend. And I don't want \r\nto see him with some girl that's always gonna give him a bad time, okay? ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Why? Because I haven't gone to bed with him yet? ",
        "\r\nBilly: Wait. You think he's about that? Because he hasn't. He hasn't told me \r\nanything. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: See, you only think you know everything. ",
        "\r\nBilly: No, come here. I'm sorry I can be dense sometimes. But can you at least \r\nclue me in?",
        "",
        "\r\nHolden: It's late. We should try to get some rest, okay? We'll get a fresh start \r\nin the morning. ",
        "\r\nLily: How long have we been looking for Luke? 24 hours? 48 hours? I've lost \r\ntrack. ",
        "\r\nHolden: We'll find him. ",
        "\r\nLily: It just seems like everybody that knew something -- they're all gone. \r\nGuido, Cordina, all the thugs and the liars, they've disappeared without a \r\ntrace. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Yeah, well, at least Dant\u00e9 is dead now. ",
        "\r\nLily: What difference does that make? The person that we thought was the biggest \r\nthreat is now gone. And our son is still gone. How could Damien take him like \r\nthat? ",
        "\r\nHolden: Using the same old story, that he was only trying to protect Luke. How \r\ndo we know what to believe here? ",
        "\r\nLily: But thank God I found you. I would lie in that bed every night and wonder \r\nhow I would get through another day. Now I know I can. I said all of my prayers \r\nand now you're here. ",
        "\r\nHolden: I promise you, we're gonna find our son. We're gonna find Luke. [\r\nKnocking at door] ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: Signora Snyder, may I speak with you please? ",
        "\r\nLily: Oh, Signora Cordina! Have you spoken to Damien? Does he have a message? He \r\nmust for us. ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: Message? No. ",
        "\r\nLily: Please don't play games. Please, we need to speak to Damien, and you know \r\nwhy. ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: I'm sorry, but that is not possible. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Since when? [Signora Cordina sighs] ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: It breaks my heart to tell you. There was a terrible car \r\naccident last night. A father and a son -- ",
        "\r\nHolden: Damien and Luke? ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: There was a death. ",
        "",
        "\r\nCarly: I didn't come here for this. Just give me a break. ",
        "\r\nCraig: Yeah! But all that pounding on the door was exciting. Ever since I \r\nconfessed my true feelings to you -- ",
        "\r\nCarly: You don't love me, you just think you love me. ",
        "\r\nCraig: I love you. ",
        "\r\nCarly: Cut it out. If you loved me, you'd stop it with these tired, old games.\r\n",
        "\r\nCraig: What tired, old games? ",
        "\r\nCarly: You leaned on Emily Stewart to give me a job, didn't you",
        "\r\nHow did you get her to do it? ",
        "\r\nCraig: Nobody can strong-arm Emily! She's a mule. Wanted to upgrade The \r\nIntruder, a little more style, little less gossip. She told me she wanted a \r\nfashion columnist. I suggested your name. Why wouldn't I? You want some water?\r\n",
        "\r\nCarly: Mm-hmm, okay, well just between us, Craig, The Intruder needs a fashion \r\ncolumn like a hooker needs a chastity belt. You're just trying to use me. ",
        "\r\nCraig: For what, fashion tips? ",
        "\r\nCarly: Yeah. [Craig laughs] you need to know if Barbara can come up with a \r\nspring line before the fall fashion shows. I don't know why you need to know, \r\nbut you do, don't you? ",
        "\r\nCraig: Why would you accuse me of something so base? I am a changed man. ",
        "\r\nCarly: Prove it. ",
        "\r\nCraig: How?! You won't believe me anyway. No matter how hard I try. ",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, Craig, it's really quite easy. All you have to do is let me walk \r\nout that door without a single question about Barbara's new collection. ",
        "\r\nCraig: You saw?! ",
        "\r\nCarly: Uh! Be careful. Bye-bye. ",
        "\r\nCraig: Wait, Carly!",
        "",
        "\r\nEmily: Destroy your mother? I helped Hal Munson find the psycho who tried to \r\nkill your mother, Paul. If anything, you should be thanking me. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Carly Tenney showed up at our house today. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Carly, yeah, she's my new fashion reporter. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, so she said. ",
        "\r\nEmily: She's a little brassy, I know. I'm sorry that she barged in on you guys \r\nlike that. ",
        "\r\nPaul: She was seeking information that no designer ever gives out in advance.\r\n",
        "\r\nEmily: Well, I'm sure she explained to you with all the publicity about your \r\nmother, people are dying to know what's happening with B.R.O. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, well, this recent publicity that you're talking about isn't \r\nsomething that my mother needs in her life right now. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Understood. But I'm sure Barbara realizes I'm not trying to hurt her. \r\nShe's got to know that even negative publicity can have a positive affect on \r\nbusiness. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Okay, look, look, I am not here to have an argument about how valuable \r\npublicity is. I'm just here to tell you that Carly gave me her word that she \r\nwouldn't print anything about my mother's sketches. And I'm just here to make \r\nsure that you hold her to it. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Your mother -- your mother's sketches. Carly probably saw them? ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, I'm sure she probably called you as soon as she left the house, \r\nright? ",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, of course she called. We discussed the ramifications. It would make \r\nquite a story. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Okay, look, my mother's sketches are a work in progress. No one sees them \r\nuntil they're finished. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Not even you? ",
        "\r\nPaul: No, not even me. And Carly shuffled through them like a deck of cards. ",
        "\r\nEmily: So I guess she saw all there was to see. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yes, which is exactly why we don't want this to get out. ",
        "\r\nEmily: Of course you don't. ",
        "\r\nPaul: You know, if our backers think that we're slipping -- ",
        "\r\nEmily: Right, B.R.O. -- B.R.O. could be in big, big trouble. ",
        "\r\nPaul: No, no! B.R.O. is fine! It's just my mother is working a little slower \r\nthan usual. ",
        "\r\nEmily: You know what? Who could blame her? But Barbara is Oakdale's only \r\nconnection to the fashion industry. And if she can't come up with a spring line, \r\nthat's big news. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah. Which is exactly what we don't want to print. ",
        "\r\nEmily: So what, you want me to do the honorable thing? ",
        "\r\nPaul: Hmm. Forget honor. Just think of it as refusing to be Craig Montgomery's \r\npuppet.",

        "\r\nLily: Who died? ",
        "\r\nHolden: Just say it. ",

        "\r\nSignora Cordina: I'm so, so sorry. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Yes, you will be sorry if my wife is right. And I think she is, because \r\nI don't think there's a word of truth in anything that you're saying. Lily, \r\nlisten to me. These people have been deceiving us from the very beginning. \r\nThere's no reason to believe anything that they say. They'd say anything to get \r\nrid of us here. ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: No, I'm telling you, this is the truth. My friend does not even \r\nknow Damien. He works for the Fire department. And they were called in after the \r\naccident. ",
        "\r\nLily: You tell Damien that I walked out of my husband and my son's memorial \r\nservice because I knew in my heart that they were alive, and I was right. Just \r\nas I know it now! You tell Damien that I want my son back! ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: I'm sorry. It is not possible to contact Damien. ",
        "\r\nLily: You've been in contact with Damien since I saw you on that plane. ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: Yes, but now everything has changed. ",
        "\r\nHolden: How can you be in such a horrible game? Keeping a child from his mother, \r\nyou can't be that cruel! ",
        "\r\nSignora Cordina: I am a mother myself. I have much sympathy for Signora Snyder. \r\nThat is why she is here in Malta in the first place, because of me.",

        "\r\nJennifer: You know what? Bryant could have stopped that wedding. He could have \r\nstopped his dad from marrying my mom, but he had to let his grandmother take \r\nover. And what did she do? She blew it. ",
        "\r\nBilly: What happened? ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Doesn't matter anymore. And then he pretends to be all torn up inside \r\nabout having to take this trust fund that just happens to be money that his \r\nfather stole from my mother. ",
        "\r\nBilly: Wow. I thought my family was nuts. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: And then, on top of everything, he lies to me about it. I mean, he not \r\nonly takes the fund, but he makes up this non-existent job to explain how he \r\ncould afford all this stuff. ",
        "\r\nBilly: Stuff for you, right? I mean, if I had someone in my life that had money \r\nand wanted to share it, I'd be pretty psyched. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: You don't understand at all. ",
        "\r\nBilly: Okay, maybe I don't. But you expect Bryant not to take the trust fund \r\nbecause you say it's dirty money? And Bryant's supposed to turn his back on his \r\nold man because you say he's a bad guy? ",
        "\r\nJennifer: You haven't seen the scars on my mother's face, okay? ",
        "\r\nBilly: Look, you don't like Craig. That's your problem. Okay? So don't make it \r\nBryant's. Because what I hear, he has stood by you t times. Not that he wants \r\ngratitude. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Then what does he want? ",
        "\r\nBilly: What do you think? He wants someone who loves him, not some girl who's \r\nconstantly putting him down. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: You know what? This is really none of your business. ",
        "\r\nBilly: Then why did you spill your guts to me? ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Because you asked. You know what, forget it. Forget I said anything at \r\nall. Forget everything I said, you'll probably just blab it all to Bryant \r\nanyway.",

        "\r\nEmily: B.R.O.'s about to be wrecked on the rocks and Craig can smell it. Maybe \r\nyou can weather the storm if I sink the story. Maybe you can't. But it would \r\njust make such a great follow-up to the trial. Why should The Intruder take the \r\nhigh road on this? ",
        "\r\nPaul: What do you want, Emily? ",
        "\r\nEmily: I will 86 any mention of B.R.O. if you give me the inside scoop. ",

        "\r\nEmily: Oh, come on, he's not Hannibal Lecter. ",
        "\r\nPaul: But he's a murderer, nonetheless. And you of all people? Why would you \r\nwant to open this can of worms? ",
        "\r\nEmily: Because, are you kidding me? It's the kind of news our readers would love \r\nto read. Your father wreaked havoc everywhere, and then just poof! Up and \r\ndisappeared. What? Do you think he's dead or something? ",
        "\r\nPaul: With any luck at all, yeah. In an unmarked grave with a wooden stake \r\njammed through his heart. ",
