        "Jessica: Paul? What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: We agreed that it would helpful to get Lily and Holden to sign off on this petition.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and I said I'd handle it. Lily is Rose's sister.",
        "Paul: Rose was my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Jessica: And your brother is responsible for Rose's death.",
        "Paul: All of which made it much more difficult for me.",
        "Jessica: This is not a competition.",
        "Paul: Sure sounds like a competition to me.",
        "Jessica: Paul, let's stay focused on the goal. To persuade the judge that will should be released from the state hospital. Now, if we can get the victim's sister to sign the petition, that's going to be a tremendous help, but your presence here -- Lily is still angry with you.",
        "Paul: I lost just as much as she did.",
        "Jessica: And if you want to get your brother back, we have to convince the judge that Will's presence in the community won't be a problem. Now Lily is a powerful woman. She owns a television station. Her mother owns the newspaper.",
        "Paul: So, I'll sell B.R.O. I'll do whatever I have to do. I'll spend every penny that I have to.",
        "Jessica: You're not hearing me. Lily has resources, connections, relationships that you don't begin to have. She can inflame public opinion. I can see the headlines now, \"boy murderer released from mental hospital.\"",
        "Paul: If she does that, I'll sue.",
        "Jessica: Which will take how long? And in the meantime, your mother is terrorizing your brother. Paul, I will talk to Lily. She's a mother. I'm sure that, some place in her heart, she has compassion for Will.",
        "Lily: Don't count on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Will? Will, where are you? Will, where --",
        "Will: I'm right here.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I knew you'd come. I was having a terrible dream. I was in a dress, or -- no. No, no, it was a uniform. A nurse's uniform. And it -- my arms -- what happened?",
        "Will: Before or after you stormed in on Paul, Dad and Jennifer?",
        "Barbara: They were there? It wasn't a dream?",
        "Will: No, I'd say more like a nightmare.",
        "Barbara: But you said it was okay. You told me to put the uniform on and come to your room.",
        "Will: Oh, you did exactly what you were supposed to, Mother. For once. Actually, everything went just like it was supposed to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So you'll get the rest of this list and you'll send it over? Good. And thank you, Kim. For the broadcast, for handling the calls, for everything. And if you hear anything about Jack, anything, please call me. I'll be home all day. Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: That was Kim?",
        "Carly: Yes, it was.",
        "Rosanna: She called you about the list of people who have been calling the station?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. Yeah, the police are at WOAK. They're following up on any call that seems reasonable, so --",
        "Rosanna: That's great. There've been lots of calls?",
        "Carly: Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Hundreds. Apparently, Jack has been seen in Lisbon, the Netherlands, any world capital. Apparently my husband is there!",
        "Rosanna: Come on. Do you think maybe he has left the country?",
        "Carly: No. We found his wallet, remember? His license, his social security card, you can't get a passport without I.D. No, these are just crank calls. And don't people realize that this is serious? That my husband is missing.",
        "Rosanna: Come on. Someone has seen him. And they will call. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sky dog: Hey, babe, spare some change? Come on, sister, trickle down. Be a kinder, gentler point of light. Hey. Whoa, man, you look well fed. How about, how about buying a fellow citizen some breakfast? Put a coin in the cup.",
        "Tourist: Get a job, deadbeat.",
        "Sky dog: Yo, man, prunes, they work wonders, man. It's all good, brother. Peace.",
        "Wyoming: Tourists, man. Ruining this country. We make enough for coffee?",
        "Sky dog: Maybe half a cup. I think we should move someplace else.",
        "Wyoming: All right. You're driving, though. I can't even see yet. Weren't we supposed to do something?",
        "Sky dog: Put the roach in the can, man.",
        "Wyoming: After that. We had to call somebody?",
        "Sky dog: Oh, that pretty lady, man. Jack's wife. On TV.",
        "Wyoming: I knew I hang out with you for a reason. Did we call her?",
        "Sky dog: Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. No. No. Rain soaked the paper. For jack.",
        "Wyoming: Brother Jack. Phones should be free, man. It's a resource.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. I woke up and you weren't there.",
        "Julia: I didn't want to wake you up.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You're such a noisy worrier, you decided to come down here.",
        "Julia: I wasn't worrying.",
        "Jack: Oh, well, it's just I'd be worried if I were you. A strange man makes love to you all night long and then asks you to marry him.",
        "Julia: Mmm. You're not a strange man, Jack.",
        "Jack: No?",
        "Julia: Unh-uh.",
        "Jack: So what are you doing down here on the sofa?",
        "Julia: Thinking.",
        "Jack: About how the last man who proposed his love to you turned out to be a psycho loser?",
        "Julia: Something like that, yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm not him.",
        "Julia: No. You're not, Jack. You're nothing like him. And I hope to God I'm nothing like your wife.",
        "Jack: Ex-wife. According to our new friends, Sky box and Winona.",
        "Julia: Sky dog and Wyoming.",
        "Jack: Oops, that's him. Well, one of us has a good memory, at least.",
        "Julia: You said she tried to kill you. What if she comes looking for you? What if she finds you the way that les found me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ring, dammit. Or don't ring, unless you're Jack. Do you know, last night before they started screening all the calls, I actually got a call from someone who wanted to know who does my hair. My hair! And another call was from some guy who wants to clean my gutters.",
        "Rosanna: There are some crazy people out there. But all it takes is one real call. [Phone rings] Do you want me to --",
        "Carly: No. It's okay. Hello?",
        "Wyoming: Is this the pretty blonde lady on TV lookin' for Jack?",
        "Carly: Who's calling, please?",
        "Wyoming: It's her. Sky dog. I mean, we'd do anything for Jack. Anything.",
        "Carly: Sky dog?",
        "Wyoming: That's my partner. I'm Wyoming. Like the state. I wasn't born there. But I can't go back there again, ever, so I call myself that so I won't forget.",
        "Carly: I see. Well, Mr. Wyoming, I suggest that you and your partner beam yourselves up back to your planet and leave me the hell alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I agreed to meet with you, Jessica, even though you were very vague about why you wanted to see me.",
        "Jessica: I thought it best I explain in person.",
        "Lily: I don't remember you mentioning Paul.",
        "Paul: We need to talk about my little brother.",
        "Holden: Jessica, Paul.",
        "Jessica: Holden.",
        "Holden: Nice to see you both.",
        "Jessica: You too.",
        "Holden: Why don't we take this inside?",
        "Lily: You know what, I don't think there's anything to talk about.",
        "Jessica: Barbara has been committed to the state hospital for observation.",
        "Lily: I can't say that I'm surprised.",
        "Holden: We're sorry to hear that, Paul.",
        "Paul: Thank you. I think, and the doctors agree with me, that it's an unhealthy situation that the two of them are in the same hospital.",
        "Lily: Well, they know best.",
        "Jessica: I have a statement --",
        "Paul: We need to get Will out of there. Jessica's drawn up a petition asking the court for Will's release.",
        "Lily: Release? Are you serious?",
        "Holden: Why don't we all go sit down?",
        "Lily: Sit down? No, no. We're talking about the person that killed my sister.",
        "Paul: It was an accident.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. It wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate act.",
        "Paul: He was just trying to hurt her. It's not like I defend that choice, but the last thing he wanted to do was kill her. And when it all happened, Lily, he was just as horrified as the rest of us.",
        "Lily: He should have been.",
        "Jessica: As you can see, the doctors feel that Will has made exceptional progress.",
        "Lily: Well, then he should stay where he is.",
        "Jessica: He understands that his relationship with his mother was unhealthy.",
        "Paul: Will isn't the villain here. Barbara is.",
        "Lily: They're both sick.",
        "Paul: He's just a kid.",
        "Lily: Look, I'm sorry. But -- I'm sorry that your brother is desperately ill. I am. I'm sorry for your entire family. But I will not buy into this sentimental idea that Will is a victim. My sister was the victim! And I'm sorry, but your brother is exactly where he belongs -- in a mental hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You told me that you had a way for us to be together. That I was supposed to put the nurse's uniform on and come to your room.",
        "Will: That's what I said.",
        "Barbara: Of course, you didn't know that they were coming. Did you? And you had no way of letting me know. It must have been just awful for you having to pretend to be surprised when you saw me.",
        "Will: And the Oscar goes to --",
        "Barbara: Will Munson. You were brilliant. Brilliant. The look on your face. And your dad, so shocked.",
        "Will: Yes and no.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Oh, did he think I was going to try to pull something? Well, little did he know that it was all you. Following in your mother's footsteps.",
        "Will: You taught me everything I know.",
        "Barbara: I know I shouldn't make light of this. It must have hurt you to see how they humiliated me. But don't worry, because we're going to have the last laugh. When we get out of this snake pit and toasting our success. They'll see.",
        "Will: I wouldn't be so sure.",
        "Barbara: Oh, honey, I know your father. He's going to be fit to be tied. We'll send him a postcard from Borneo.",
        "Will: Borneo? Not exactly what I had in mind.",
        "Barbara: Well, wherever. As long as we're together.",
        "Will: I don't think that's going to be possible.",
        "Barbara: And why not? You said you had a plan to get us out of here.",
        "Will: Oh, I'm getting out, Mom. But you're staying right here, where you belong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Jack, you said she tied you up and she tried to drown you.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's good news. Who's gonna come looking for a dead guy?",
        "Julia: Maybe we should go looking for her.",
        "Jack: Look for -- she's a lunatic, Julia. Look, hey, look -- if she shows up, I'll do whatever legal stuff I have to do. But I'm not going back to her. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here with you. If you're worried that it's too soon, that you don't want to get married right away, that's fine with me too. I just wanted you to know how I feel. That I'm here, that I love you, and that I'm committed. That's all.",
        "Julia: I do. I get that.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Julia: I totally get that. It's just, you know, jack, I have to think about J.J. too. And he's been through so many ups and downs already --",
        "Jack: Yeah, I get that. And now you're tied to a guy with no last name.",
        "Julia: No, I don't care about your last name, Jack, or what you had to do to get to me. I know what a great man you are. I know what a miracle you are in my life. I just, you know, I think I get -- I guess I'm just afraid that I'm going -- you're going to wake up one day and you're going to remember who you are and maybe J.J. And I won't be what you want.",
        "Jack: Okay. Listen to me, first. I thought you'd put my ring in a drawer somewhere.",
        "Julia: I just tried it on. I wanted to see what it'd be like to be Mrs. Jack Jackson.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jack: Jack -- well, I can stand it if you can. Look, don't be worried about something that may never happen. If I wake up one of these mornings, and remember more about my life before I met you? That's my past. It has nothing to do with the guy I am now or how I feel. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Maybe we could ask Margo to reroute the phone here to the station.",
        "Carly: No. No, if Jack calls, I want to be the one to answer the phone.",
        "Parker: Who called?",
        "Carly: Oh, that was nobody, sweetheart. That was just a wrong number. Come here, you. You hungry?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Carly: Can you say good morning to Aunt Rosanna?",
        "Parker: 'Morning.",
        "Rosanna: Good morning, sweetheart.",
        "Carly: Have you been asleep all this time?",
        "Parker: No. You look sad.",
        "Carly: No. No, I'm okay. I'm just tired. How about you?",
        "Parker: Did you find Jack?",
        "Carly: No. No, not yet. But we will. There've been a lot of calls.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Carly: Um, Parker, would you help Aunt Rosanna check on Sage?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, come on. You said there was a new poster up in your room? Let's go look at it. Come on, let's go.",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Sky dog: That was cold, hanging up on my man Wyoming.",
        "Wyoming: We spent real money calling you.",
        "Carly: Look, if you have information, the police have an 1-800 number, okay?",
        "Sky dog: No. No, no, no police.",
        "Wyoming: Just hang up, man.",
        "Sky dog: Our thing is, is we'll deal with you personally.",
        "Carly: You want to deal with me?",
        "Sky dog: We saw your old man.",
        "Carly: When? Where?",
        "Sky dog: Yesterday. In a parking lot.",
        "Carly: A parking lot?",
        "Sky dog: Look, we'll tell you everything you want to know. Soon as we sit down.",
        "Wyoming: It'll cost you!",
        "Sky dog: Hey, hey. Let me handle this? Ma'am?",
        "Carly: You want to sell me information about my missing husband?",
        "Sky dog: For whatever it's worth to you. I'm not trying to get rich here.",
        "Wyoming: Why not?",
        "Sky dog: 'Cause it's Jack's wife, that's why not. Look, I'm sorry, he gets a little cranky when he hasn't eaten. We haven't had a decent meal in two days.",
        "Carly: Well, listen, that is not my problem. And if you call here again trying to extort money, I will have you arrested and thrown in jail.",
        "Sky dog: She hung up on me.",
        "Wyoming: Man, I keep telling you, you can't trust anybody these days.",
        "Sky dog: Damn. No wonder our boy Jack ran off.",
        "Wyoming: She's there alone, right? Just her and those kids?",
        "Sky dog: Dude, I am not going back to jail, man.",
        "Wyoming: No, we're just gonna talk to her. We have valuable information. We saw jack. That's gotta be worth at least a couple hundred.",
        "Sky dog: And we're just gonna talk to her? 'Cause I know how you get, man.",
        "Wyoming: Me? You're the one broke that lady's jaw.",
        "Sky dog: All right. This is a transaction. We've got legitimate business with the lady. We're sellin', she's buyin'.",
        "Wyoming: And nobody gets hurt.",
        "Sky dog: No. No, of course not. We're just gonna talk to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You haven't even read the doctor's report, but you somehow magically know what's best.",
        "Lily: I've known your brother since the day he was born. And I am sorry for what your mother has done to him, but the damage is done.",
        "Paul: All the more reason to get him out of there. As long as my mother and Will are in the same institution, Barbara poses a threat to Will's safety.",
        "Lily: Well, then, take Barbara out of there! Why should the whole community be at risk? Why should my children? Holden, why should our children have to feel threatened? Do you think Luke -- how's he going to feel? He won't be able sleep at night knowing Will is walking around.",
        "Holden: Lily, you don't know that. Jess, what exactly do you want from us?",
        "Jessica: We're filing a friend of the court petition requesting Will's immediate release. Of course, he'd be closely monitored, living with his father, seeing a psychiatrist on a daily basis.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, we have to go along with this or the judge is not going to go along with this plan. Right?",
        "Jessica: While that's not entirely true, as members of the victim's family, your support would be greatly appreciated.",
        "Holden: I'll tell you what. We will read over everything.",
        "Lily: We're not -- we're not signing the petition. Do I have to hire an attorney to point out all the reasons why this is a mistake?",
        "Paul: You know, in the weeks after Rose died, you had your legal team mount an attack on me because you were convinced that I murdered Rose.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I told you that.",
        "Paul: You were wrong then, Lily. But you are more wrong now. Holden, thank you for your time.",
        "Jessica: I know how difficult this all is and what memories it stirs up. But if you just look over everything in the next few days --",
        "Lily: We're not going to change our minds.",
        "Holden: Jess, I'll walk you out. Thanks for keeping us informed.",
        "Lily: You cannot tell me that you are even considering signing that petition.",
        "Holden: Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: The doctors? Are they listening? Tell me what to say.",
        "Will: Nobody's listening, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Then why are you saying these things to me?",
        "Will: I've come to say goodbye.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no, they're moving you because they caught me in your room. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.",
        "Will: I'm going home, Mom. Dad's working on it right now. When you showed up in that nurse's uniform, it convinced him that I'm not safe here.",
        "Barbara: But it was your idea. All of it. You knew they were coming? You set me up? No, no, no. I don't believe it.",
        "Will: Someday you're gonna have to stop underestimating me.",
        "Barbara: Why would you do such a thing to me?",
        "Will: You think I like it here? This is a mental hospital.",
        "Barbara: I know you've suffered, honey.",
        "Will: Because of you, Mother.",
        "Barbara: No! No, not because of me! I tried to take you away. I had that helicopter waiting, but you're brother and your father, they wouldn't let me take you.",
        "Will: Because they knew you were crazy.",
        "Barbara: I am not. They're telling you lies. All of it. I pretended to be crazy so I could get in here so I could be with you.",
        "Will: But I don't want to be with you. I want to go home and see my friends, go see a movie.",
        "Barbara: We can do that.",
        "Will: No. We won't. I want my life back. And that means you're going to stay right here.",
        "Barbara: You don't make any sense.",
        "Will: I want you out of my head! Out of my life! You don't know how to be happy and I'm sick of being the one to make you feel happy. All you know how to do is hate people.",
        "Barbara: Are you finished?",
        "Will: Don't do that.",
        "Barbara: Do what?",
        "Will: That tone of voice. Acting all cold and disappointed. You know what I mean.",
        "Barbara: You want me to be proud of my son who is screaming at a woman in restraints? This hasn't exactly been a joy ride for me either.",
        "Will: Here we go.",
        "Barbara: I gave up my life for you, Will.",
        "Will: I thought I was your life, Mom. Me along with Paul and Jennifer, of course.",
        "Barbara: But you were always my favorite. And you know why? Because we understand each other. When your father married that woman --",
        "Will: Her name is Emily.",
        "Barbara: When your brother wanted to run away and leave us --",
        "Will: He wasn't leaving us. He was getting married.",
        "Barbara: And you killed her! And I took the blame for it. And I would have gone to prison for you. I would die for you. And you know why? Because I love you. You're my baby. My precious little lamb.",
        "Will: Stop it!",
        "Barbara: You need me. You need me, Will, just like I need you. Look at me.",
        "Will: No.",
        "Barbara: They've made you afraid of me.",
        "Will: I'm not afraid of you.",
        "Barbara: Then look at me. You won't be happy without me. I was miserable without you. Trust me.",
        "Will: We can't keep doing this, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Doing what? Loving each other? Now come here. And untie these. And let me hold you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What's up?",
        "Julia: Ah, that was the hospital. Holly called in sick. I have to go in.",
        "Jack: That's all right. What can I do? I can take care of J.J. if you want me to.",
        "Julia: I promised I'd take him to a baseball game.",
        "Jack: I love baseball, I think.",
        "Julia: You do? You wouldn't mind taking him?",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? It'd be a blast.",
        "Julia: Okay.",
        "Jack: Besides, if I play my cards right, I'm gonna be around a lot longer, right?",
        "Julia: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: And I'm warning you, I get baseball and football. Anything to do with a ball, it's my arena. And you can take him to the spelling bees, and school plays and whatever.",
        "J.J.: What's happening?",
        "Julia: We had a little change of plans.",
        "Jack: Yeah, your mom is sending us to a baseball game.",
        "J.J.: You and me?",
        "Jack: You and me.",
        "Julia: You know what, you could at least pretend to be disappointed.",

        "Rosanna: How'd they get your number then?",
        "Carly: It's listed. And I'm not going to change it. Not until Jack comes home. Hi, sweetie.",

        "Rosanna: Listen, I have an idea. Why don't we all go out for breakfast someplace? I know you love Al's, right? They have those great blueberry pancakes.",
        "Carly: No, I can't. You know that I have to stay near the phone. And Sage should sleep. She was up half the night.",

        "Paul: I know that Lily's grieving. Thank you. We're all grieving. I'm grieving. What I don't understand is why she's so sanctimonious about it. All, \"nobody suffers the way Lily Snyder suffers.\" She's just like my mother -- she's like Barbara. She's a narcissist, through and through. She can't even spare a second to think about a poor kid's been locked up in a mental institution for month after month. No, it's all about her pain, it's all about her anger. And what I want to know is who gave her the power? Now you tell me that.",
        "Jessica: Are you finished? Because the family could have insisted that Will be charged and tried. Instead, they allowed him to be treated.",
        "Paul: Oh, they \"allowed\" him to be treated.",
        "Jessica: Do I have to remind you of Lily's position in this community?",
        "Paul: No. Lily constantly reminds everybody about her position in the community.",

        "Jessica: I'm saying that you just might have to get used to the idea that Will's going to be there for awhile --",

        "Holden: Why are you so angry?",
        "Lily: Because Rose didn't have to die! It was personal. That boy hated her. Then he poisoned her. He didn't spend one day in jail!",
        "Holden: Lily, he's a minor.",
        "Lily: So what, he gets to go out, be on a baseball team? Go to college, get married, have children while my sister's buried in New Jersey?",

        "Lily: A mistake? He deliberately poisoned another human being!",
        "Holden: So she would get sick and they would postpone the wedding.",

        "Holden: Do you really honestly believe that that boy wanted Rose to die?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know what he wanted. I just know what happened. He went online, he researched it, he got the poison, he broke into her house, and he poisoned her --",
        "Holden: Yes, we all know how it happened.",
        "Lily: Then how can you defend him? He's pathological. You don't get cured from that in a few months. Until somebody can prove to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that that boy has changed, I want him locked up!",

And the doctors are all very pleased with the way your coming to terms with -- you know, Mom's influence. And you just need listen to yourself -- what you're feeling, what you need -- and you can always ask me. If you need anything, I'm here.",
