        "Katie: Did you hear that?",
        "Mike: Yeah. It's silence. Maddie's gone. Henry's gone.",
        "Katie: Maddie will be back.",
        "Mike: Ah, but not until you pick her up. And then she will be gone for good. And that's a great thing. You know why?",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Mike: This is why.",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Katie: Maddie.",
        "Mike: Where?",
        "Katie: She left her computer on.",
        "Mike: Oh.",
        "Katie: Mike, it's like having someone in here watching us.",
        "Mike: Where are you going?",
        "Katie: To find out why that thing is making so much noise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Bob: Hey, Will. What are you doing here?",
        "Will: Roughing it, same as you. I figured since Aunt Kim was working late tonight, this was my best bet for dinner.",
        "Bob: Isn't Casey giving a party tonight?",
        "Will: He is.",
        "Bob: Didn't he invite you?",
        "Will: He did.",
        "Bob: Well, then why aren't you there? Has it escaped your attention that you are 17 years old?",
        "Will: No, it hasn't escaped my attention.",
        "Bob: Okay, then you should be at that party.",
        "Will: It's not my thing.",
        "Bob: Well, it should be. You're young. You should be there scoping out babes.",
        "Will: Babes?",
        "Bob: Yeah, devouring non-nutritious snacks and having your eardrums burst by incomprehensible, loud music.",
        "Will: I think I'll pass.",
        "Bob: I'd go myself, but Kim would kill me.",
        "Will: Casey might have invited me, but doesn't mean he wants me there. My bet is, I won't be missed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Pretend I'm not even here.",
        "Casey: No wait. Why were you hiding back there?",
        "Maddie: I was just passing by. Carry on.",
        "Casey: Who are you?",
        "Maddie: Maddie Coleman.",
        "Lia: I think she's one of the new girls at our school.",
        "Casey: Want to tell me why you were spying on us?",
        "Maddie: Sorry.",
        "Lia: You really were spying on us?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I prefer to call it research.",
        "Casey: Trying to pick up some pointers?",
        "Maddie: No, actually, I'm writing a book. The title is \"lame come-ons that have somehow survived into the 21st century.\" And with that, how'd it go? \"Hey, baby, let me smell your perfume\" line, I think you might have made it to the cover.",
        "[Lia laughs]",
        "Lia: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Dr. Michaels has given Jennifer a sedative.",
        "Emily: Well, the only reason she needs a sedative is because she knows her baby is alive. Even though everybody is telling her he's dead!",
        "Paul: Please, Emily, keep your voice down.",
        "Emily: It was just so hard seeing her with him today.",
        "Paul: You know why I did this.",
        "Emily: No, we -- we did this. We're in this together. And I will keep my promise. I'm not gonna say anything to her. But you need to rethink this.",
        "Paul: I thought she was getting better. That she was happy.",
        "Emily: Paul, your sister isn't happy. You have to tell her.",
        "Paul: How do you want me to do that, huh? What do you want me to say to her? If only Gwen had gotten custody --",
        "Emily: Well, she didn't. Which means Rory is going to be growing up here in this town. And Jennifer is going to be running into Carly and the baby constantly. Just like she did today. I mean, do you want her to go through that agony again and again? You have got to tell her the truth, Paul. Tell her tonight.",
        "Jennifer: Why won't you believe me? Why doesn't anybody believe me? That was my baby!",
        "Barbara: Honey, honey, listen to me. I know it feels like this pain won't go away, and you can't take it anymore, but you'll be better.",
        "Jennifer: He's not dead!",
        "Barbara: Why is the sedative not working?",
        "Jennifer: He's not!",
        "Dr. Michaels: Jennifer, listen to me. Look at me.",
        "Jennifer: He's not dead.",
        "Dr. Michaels: I want you to take a couple of deep breaths. Can you do that for me? Your pulse is a little rapid and we want to bring it down. So I want you to those breaths a little bit slower. All right, count to five when you inhale and then exhale and count to five again.",
        "Jennifer: Ah, my chest! My heart! It hurts!",
        "Paul: Doctor, what's happening?",
        "Barbara: What's going on, Lynn?",
        "Dr. Michaels: She's gonna need an ambulance. Call 911. Jennifer, I want you to take hold of my hand and together we are going to slow down that breathing. I know you can do it.",
        "Emily: Paul --",
        "Paul: She's going to be okay. She has to be okay.",
        "Barbara: Yes, hello, this is an emergency. I think my daughter's having a heart attack.",
        "Barbara: The Lakeview Towers. Please, hurry. My daughter could be dying.",
        "Paul: What's the problem?",
        "Barbara: There's an accident on the interstate. They don't think they could get an ambulance here for at least ten more minutes.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Okay. Paul, there should be a defibrillator downstairs, I'm sure the hotel desk can locate it for you. We need to get it up here, just in case.",
        "Emily: I'll go. I'm gonna go right now. Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: What are you doing?",
        "Dr. Michaels: No, Paul. Paul, she shouldn't be moved.",
        "Barbara: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What did you do that for?",
        "Mike: So you wouldn't read Maddie's e-mail.",
        "Katie: I was not going to read her e-mail.",
        "Mike: Katie -- okay, I hate to tell you this just before I'm about to get you naked, but you're nosy.",
        "Katie: I'm not nosy, I'm curious.",
        "Mike: I stand corrected. Now, where were we?",
        "Katie: But now that you mention it, maybe I should just take a look.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Katie: Because I kicked Henry out and I'm shipping Maddie off to Tom and Margo's.",
        "Mike: Yeah. So?",
        "Katie: So aren't you a little curious to see what she's writing about me to her little friends?",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Katie: Okay, I should at least log off the computer. I don't want to waste energy.",
        "Mike: You're worried about the electric bill? Now? Now, when we can do whatever we want without having to worry about Henry or Maddie walking in?",
        "Katie: Do you think Maddie's gonna be happy at Tom and Margo's?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm sure she will.",
        "Katie: And Henry?",
        "Mike: Yeah. What's going on?",
        "Katie: Well, Henry's gone and Maddie's gonna be gone soon. The renovations are almost done on your place, so you're not gonna be around as much.",
        "Mike: Hey, I am not going to desert you.",
        "Katie: Oh, I know, I know. You know what, it's actually probably gonna be good for me to have the place to myself.",
        "Mike: It will?",
        "Katie: You can come over any time you want.",
        "Mike: I thought --",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: You know what we need?",
        "Katie: A bed?",
        "Mike: A fire.",
        "Katie: So romantic. I love having a fire on a cold night, cuddling up all toasty.",
        "Mike: Well, I will make sure that you have plenty of wood and kindling, you know, so we can sit and watch the fire and meditate.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but when I'm alone, I don't usually bother with them.",
        "Mike: Well, that is a problem. Maybe you need a roommate. Someone that can actually pay the bills, keep the fires burning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, this isn't funny!",
        "Maddie: Sorry.",
        "Lia: Oh, come on, lighten up. It's not that big of a deal.",
        "Casey: I know, I know. Right. Who cares? I just don't like being watched.",
        "Maddie: I wasn't watching you, per se. I was just hanging out here. And before I could even open my mouth, you were putting the moves on -- what's your name?",
        "Lia: Lia. And you said your name was Mattie?",
        "Maddie: Maddie. Short for Madeline.",
        "Lia: Right. Well, it's nice to meet you. Isn't it, Casey?",
        "Casey: Let me get back to you on that.",
        "Lia: That's not very nice.",
        "Casey: Well, the mood's kind of spoiled, you know?",
        "Lia: The night's not over yet. You can try all your best lines on me later. I'll pretend I didn't hear them all. [Cell phone rings] Hey, what's up? No, I'm outside. Where are you? Yeah, no way. I'll be right there. Darcy McCormick got implants and all the girls are looking at her in the bathroom. I'll be right back.",
        "Maddie: She got going. I bet you want to see that one.",
        "Casey: Is everything a joke to you? This is serious.",
        "Maddie: I agree. It is so sad when a girl's self esteem is so tied to her bust size.",
        "Casey: So, are you here with anybody or what?",
        "Maddie: What's it to you?",
        "Casey: I've just never seen you at school.",
        "Maddie: And I've never seen you. So let's keep that going, how about it?",
        "Casey: Hold on. Did you crash this party?",
        "Maddie: No, I was invited. In fact, lover boy, I have more reason to be here than you.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Casey: You want to tell me the lame-brain that invited you?",
        "Margo: That would be me.",
        "Casey: Mom, you've got to be kidding me.",
        "Maddie: He's Casey? He's your son?",
        "Margo: That's right. I wanted you to get to know Maddie before she moves in.",
        "Casey: Moves in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: How's Jennifer?",
        "Barbara: They're trying to calm her down right now. Should we call Will?",
        "Hal: No, no, not until we know more. Jennifer was having chest pains?",
        "Barbara: Everything happened very fast. There was an incident and I called Dr. Michaels. She came over, she gave her a sedative, but it doesn't seem to be helping at all.",
        "Hal: Why was Jennifer so upset?",
        "Barbara: It was about the baby.",
        "Hal: The baby? What about the baby?",
        "Paul: Carly was at the Lakeview with the kids. Including the baby that they took in.",
        "Emily: And Jennifer thought the baby was hers, Hal.",
        "Barbara: She picked up the baby, and when we tried to separate her from --",
        "Hal: What? What did she do?",
        "Barbara: She just kept claiming it was hers. She's just very distraught about her own child. She's not rational at all. She's upset about the death of her own baby. That's why she's acting so crazy. Right, Paul?",
        "Paul: She's not crazy. We have something that we need to tell you.",
        "Hal: No, not now. I need to see Jennifer right away.",
        "Barbara: You can't do that. Dr. Michaels is sitting with her.",
        "Hal: I need to see Dr. Michaels, too. She needs to know what she's dealing with. Jennifer's life could depend on it.",
        "Paul: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Barbara: How is she?",
        "Dr. Michaels: She's being monitored and she is breathing a little more easily. But I'm still very concerned. Her heart rate is still dangerously elevated, despite everything we've done.",
        "Hal: I think I know why that is. There's a chance that Jennifer could be on methamphetamines.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: That's not possible.",
        "Barbara: That is ridiculous, and I can't believe for a second that would believe Dusty Donovan. He came to me with those same accusations.",
        "Paul: Whoa. Dusty told you that Jennifer was on drugs? When?",
        "Hal: If it's true, Dr. Michaels, it would explain why her heart is racing.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Yes, it would. And I will call the cardiologist and order a tox screen immediately. Thank you for the information.",
        "Barbara: It's a waste of time. This is impossible.",
        "Paul: How long have you known about this?",
        "Barbara: Jennifer is not on drugs. It's impossible.",
        "Hal: I knew something was off when I saw her at the cash machine. She said her card wasn't working. She was desperate for money. I gave it to her.",
        "Barbara: Why would Jen be desperate for money?",
        "Hal: Because Dusty was right. She needed the cash to buy drugs. I knew something was wrong. That's why I came up to the suite. I had to talk to her, even though you didn't want me to.",
        "Barbara: What did she say to you?",
        "Hal: She denied everything. I didn't buy it, I just wanted to believe she was gonna be okay.",
        "Barbara: We all want to believe that, Hal.",
        "Hal: Well, she's not okay, is she? I just hope to God we haven't waited too long.",
        "Barbara: Oh, God, my poor baby.",
        "Paul: Why didn't you tell me? My sister's on drugs, you don't even tell me?",
        "Dr. Michaels: Hal? I can't get Jennifer to confirm what she's taken or how much. And the sooner we know -- would you try to get through to her?",
        "Hal: Yes.",
        "Jennifer: Daddy?",
        "Hal: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Jennifer: I'm scared.",
        "Hal: Yeah, me too. And I want you to get better. Dr. Michaels is trying to help you. You know that, don't you?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Hal: Now, I'm going to ask you a question. And I need you to be completely honest with me, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Okay.",
        "Hal: You know what it is I'm about to ask you, don't you?",
        "Jennifer: I just wanted the pain to stop. It just hurt so bad, Daddy. I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Are you not going to Casey's party because of Gwen?",
        "Will: No. Gwen and I -- we're not exactly speaking.",
        "Bob: Listen, I hope this is something because of what I said. I mean, I suggested to you that you be careful not to get too involved, but I didn't mean you --",
        "Will: No, of course not. I didn't bail on Gwen. She bailed on me.",
        "Bob: Why?",
        "Will: 'Cause the whole custody thing and she's trying to get her baby back, and I know that's hard. But instead of dealing with it, Gwen thinks everybody's out to get her. Including me.",
        "Bob: I see.",
        "Will: And I didn't do anything. All I did was try to put some logic into the situation.",
        "Bob: And she didn't want to be logical?",
        "Will: Not even close. She actually said that the only reason I cared about her was because it let me feel superior. And if I picked someone who's more of a loser than me, then I wouldn't feel so lame.",
        "Bob: Well, she was angry and hurt.",
        "Will: I guess.",
        "Bob: Listen, you're not a loser. And neither is Gwen.",
        "Will: I know, but trying to convince her that --",
        "Bob: Well, the next time you two bump into each other, you remind Gwen that she tried to make some very serious decisions that had a lot more to do with her baby's happiness than her own. A loser doesn't do that.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Bob: And as for you -- I mean, you stepped up and took responsibility for Gwen's baby. That was a very unselfish thing to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that the baby is not yours, but that was quite a sacrifice to make for a friend. And that's as far from being a loser as you can ever get.",
        "Will: So you think I should call her?",
        "Bob: I think you should remember that you're 17 years old and stop taking on all these responsibilities. And put some fun back into your life. I happen to know about this party \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You're Casey? Great.",
        "Casey: Mom, how do you even know her?",
        "Margo: Maddie is Henry Coleman's sister.",
        "Casey: I thought Aunt Katie divorced that guy?",
        "Margo: Yes, she did. But Maddie's new in town, she's going to be going to Oakdale Latin with you, so I thought you could show her the ropes. So while Henry's getting himself together, Maddie's gonna stay with us.",
        "Casey: Why us?",
        "Margo: Will you stop being so rude? She's like family.",
        "Maddie: Former family.",
        "Margo: Okay, we'll be like friends. You guys wanna get back to the party?",
        "Casey: You mind if I talk tom my former relative for a minute?",
        "Margo: All right. Be nice.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What's that?",
        "Katie: Hot cider. For the fire. [Mike sighs] What?",
        "Mike: You didn't make hot cider 'cause you wanted hot cider. You needed some time to think.",
        "Katie: Do I get to keep any secrets at all anymore?",
        "Mike: No. So now that you've had time to about it, what's the verdict? Do you want me here?",
        "Katie: No. Of course.",
        "Mike: But you just don't want me to move in? I thought we talked about this. I thought it was cool.",
        "Katie: I want you to move in.",
        "Mike: So what's the problem?",
        "Katie: We don't have any problems.",
        "Mike: Okay, you're going to have to explain this to me.",
        "Katie: There's always been someone or something standing in our way. And we don't have that anymore.",
        "Mike: That's a bad thing?",
        "Katie: I don't know, maybe. I mean, normal life is normal. What if it gets boring and monotonous? I mean, what if we --",
        "Mike: Wait Katie, you could never bore me.",
        "Katie: How do you know?",
        "Mike: You're right. I never thought about that. Wow, it's been nice knowing you.",
        "Katie: Mike Kasnoff, don't you set one foot out that door. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. You love me and I love you.",
        "Mike: You love me?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: I love you too, angel. And I want normal with you. I want to be happy with you, miserable with you. I want it all with you. Nothing but you.",
        "Katie: Where are we going to do all this? I mean, I love your place, but I don't want to live there. There's too many memories of Jennifer.",
        "Mike: I understand that.",
        "Katie: And you can't live here.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because you've only had one wife. I've already had two husbands.",
        "Mike: Yeah, but you love it here.",
        "Katie: Yes, but --",
        "Mike: So I think we need to get rid of those old memories.",
        "Katie: And how do we do that?",
        "Mike: Start some new memories. We can do that right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I don't know how it got so bad. I just thought that I would do it once, just to get through the pain.",
        "Barbara: I did this, Jen. I pushed you too hard after the baby died.",
        "Jennifer: No, Mom. You didn't do anything wrong. Really, you didn't.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Jennifer, were you taking antidepressants along with the meth?",
        "Barbara: 0h God, honey -- you told me the pills fell down the drain. Honey, don't worry. We're going to get through this. We will get you through this, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I want to talk to Paul for a minute. Okay?",
        "Barbara: I'll be outside.",
        "Emily: I'm so sorry.",
        "Hal: You wanted to talk to me? Before, you and Paul were going to tell me something.",
        "Emily: It's okay. I think Paul's taking care of it.",
        "Paul: I didn't know. Jennifer, I really wish I had known.",
        "Jennifer: I lied to everyone. How could you know?",
        "Paul: Yeah but if you had come to me, I would have been able to help you.",
        "Jennifer: Do you really want to help me?",
        "Paul: Absolutely.",
        "Jennifer: Will you do something for me?",
        "Paul: Anything. Just tell me.",
        "Jennifer: Get me out of here.",

        "Katie: Welcome home.",
        "Maddie: Ohh!",
        "Jennifer: You are just like the rest of them!",
        "Paul: No, I'm not.",
        "Jennifer: No. You were supposed to help me. You're my brother. I need you, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Michaels: Well, Jennifer's heart rate is coming back down into the normal range. She should be stabilized soon.",
        "Hal: Then what?",
        "Dr. Michaels: I'd like to keep her here so we can help her through withdrawal.",
        "Barbara: Will it be painful?",
        "Dr. Michaels: They'll be some discomfort, but she'll be a lot safer here where she can be monitored.",
