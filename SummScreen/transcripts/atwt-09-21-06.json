        "Katie: When we have a baby.",
        "Mike: When --",
        "Katie: When -- don't ever let me hear you say if again. We're talking --",
        "Mike: When.",
        "Nurse: The doctor will see you now.",
        "Katie: Oh great, thank you so much.",
        "Nurse: You know, most of the couples that come in here, they're not usually laughing. That's nice.",
        "Katie: Well, most couples are probably pretty nervous. That's why they're not laughing. I guess I'm a little nervous.",
        "Mike: Katie, we don't have to do this --",
        "Katie: No, no, like I said. I'd rather know if there's a problem now rather than later.",
        "Dr. Chen: Mr. and Mrs. Kasnoff --",
        "Katie: Hi, it's so nice to meet you.",
        "Dr. Chen: It's nice to meet you. We usually start with an interview and written assessment first, but we have a little scheduling problem this morning.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. Do we have to come back?",
        "Dr. Chen: No, we're just going in a different order. Mr. Kasnoff, the private room is across the hall. You'll find cups, some magazines -- as soon as you're done, we can get your sample off to the lab.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi, I'm sorry I didn't call. I need to talk to Tom. Is he here?",
        "Margo: No, he's not here.",
        "Emily: What do you mean he's not here? I talked to his office this morning. They said he was working at home.",
        "Margo: He was but --",
        "Emily: Look, I apologize that I didn't call, and I realize this isn't easy on you, but I need to talk to Tom --",
        "Margo: Emily, Tom is not here. He got a phone call and he left.",
        "Emily: Who called him?",
        "Margo: I don't know.",
        "Emily: Would you stop messing around with me? I need to talk to Tom. Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Thank you for coming by. I really need to talk to you, and it has to be private.",
        "Tom: Will Paul be joining us?",
        "Meg: Paul had to go out of town. That's part of what I need to talk to you about. Please sit down.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Meg: Would you like some coffee?",
        "Tom: No, no, thanks. Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Meg: Well, it's Emily. She had a major meltdown last night. And she said she was going to leave Oakdale.",
        "Tom: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Look, she's ready to do whatever it takes to keep Paul from having any access to his baby. And until Paul can get a court order to keep her from going, we need to find a way to stall her.",
        "Tom: We?",
        "Meg: Tom, we need you. I mean, as Daniel's father, you must be upset by this, and as the D.A. you're our only hope.",
        "Tom: Hmm.",
        "Meg: What? What do you think?",
        "Tom: I think you're not telling me the whole story.",
        "Meg: Tom, you know what Emily's like -- how unstable, how vengeful, what more do you need to know?",
        "Tom: I guess I need to know what you and or Paul did to cause this meltdown.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You got what you wanted, Jack. The divorce is final.",
        "Carly: You got what you wanted. What you wanted. What you wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I know Will inside and out, and he's not lying. He does love me. He doesn't love Jade.",
        "Carly: That's important, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. All that love doesn't really change the fact that she's having his baby and I can never can.",
        "Carly: What about you? Do you love him?",
        "Gwen: Yes. Do I want to? No.",
        "Carly: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: What is this? It's your divorce decree. You did it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but let's not talk about that now, okay?",
        "Gwen: That's why you were gone -- so, you know exactly what I'm talking about when I say that love isn't enough?",
        "Carly: Gwen, can we just talk about you today, okay?",
        "Gwen: It's seems to me that we are having the same problem.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. No. Do not compare yourself to me. Your situation is very different. And God forbid that you should ever, ever end up like me.",
        "Gwen: I don't think it would be so bad to be like you.",
        "Carly: Then, I must make it look a lot better than it is. Listen to me, Gwen. Jack and I are divorced. It's over. For good this time. And even though this time may be considered no fault. Believe me, in the history of the Jack and Carly relationship, I, myself, have put every single nail in the coffin. Jack has been the forgiving one. You're like him. You are not like me. You haven't done anything wrong. You have not been an impulsive idiot, and you do not have to end up alone if you don't want to.",
        "Gwen: Okay, okay. What if I can't get past it? Maybe I can get over the fact that he slept with Jade, but maybe I won't be able to get over the fact. I'm so tired of crying.",
        "Carly: Oh, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: It was so nice -- it was so nice in the church when we made up. And it was like, it erased the past or it made us stronger somehow.",
        "Carly: Yeah, it probably did.",
        "Gwen: It didn't. I'm not strong enough for this. I know that I can't take this.",
        "Carly: Maybe you can't right now. So you do what you have to do. You go to school. You take care of yourself. Try to forget about Jade for now. And in a while, after some time has past, you see how you feel. You see how strong you are then.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I would just love it for one day not to be horrible.",
        "Carly: You have had your share, haven't you?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Gwen: I'm not talking to you. I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Will: Sorry, I didn't know you were here. I came by to see Carly.",
        "Carly: Oh, um, well, I'm sort of busy right now.",
        "Gwen: No, um, you know what? I promised Casey I'd talk to him about something. I will do that now. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Will: She didn't even look at me.",
        "Carly: Are you surprised?",
        "Will: No. Carly, you have to help me get her back.",
        "Carly: I would like nothing more.",
        "Will: Thank you.",
        "Carly: But that's just not gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Apparently, there's been some kind of mistake. This appointment's for Katie.",
        "Dr. Chen: We have here the appointment's for both of you.",
        "Mike: No, that's not right.",
        "Katie: Yes, actually, it is. Just a second. Um, I guess you kind of have to think about this like you're fixing a motorcycle.",
        "Mike: Like what?",
        "Katie: Like, you know, when you need to fix a motorcycle, and you don't know what's wrong with it, you kind of Zen out and look at the whole bike not assuming anything.",
        "Mike: Okay, well, there's not a problem, and this isn't a motorcycle.",
        "Dr. Chen: If you two would like a moment?",
        "Mike: No, no, we don't need a moment. She can do whatever she wants, but I'm -- I'm not doing that.",
        "Dr. Chen: I'll give you a moment.",
        "Katie: Thank you. Well, that was nice and embarrassing.",
        "Mike: You -- you're accusing me of embarrassing you?",
        "Katie: She's a complete stranger!",
        "Mike: Well, maybe if you'd told me what you were up to before that complete stranger came in here and told me to go -- I cannot believe this. I can't believe you.",
        "Katie: What are you talking about? We had this conversation last night.",
        "Mike: No, last night you told me that you were going to the doctor.",
        "Katie: I told you that we were seeing a fertility expert. I just thought that it would be clear that both of us would --",
        "Mike: You know what's clear? Is you knew how I felt about this, okay? You knew that if you were straight with me, that I'd say no. Okay, instead, you skated over the tricky parts so you can get what you want.",
        "Katie: You are using a simple misunderstanding to justify a personal attack on me.",
        "Mike: You know what? Maybe you're right.",
        "Katie: I'm right?",
        "Mike: No, I said, maybe you're right. Maybe this is just a misunderstanding, okay? So you can get checked out to your heart's content. I'm gonna go home and get some sleep.",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Mike: Yes.",
        "Katie: It doesn't make any sense for me to get checked out if you don't get checked out. We're trying to have a baby together.",
        "Mike: I don't need to get checked out, okay? I think that I've demonstrated that my motorcycle works just fine.",
        "Katie: Why, because you got Carly pregnant?",
        "Mike: Kind of proves I can make babies.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, Mike, that was when you were young.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Margo, this is really important. Who called Tom?",
        "Margo: You know what's really important? That you calm down. Because you don't want to make another trip to the ER, do you?",
        "Emily: No, of course not.",
        "Margo: Well, come on in. Wait over there, and -- I don't know who called Tom, but I do know he's gonna be back here before he goes to the office.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Margo: So you can just six and relax and wait.",
        "Emily: No, I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Margo: You want some coffee or --?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Margo: Danny?! Daniel?!",
        "Emily: Daniel's here?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Daniel, guess who's here for ya?",
        "Daniel: I don't know, who? Mommy!",
        "Emily: You don't know who? Get over here and hug your mother.",
        "Daniel: Is it all right?",
        "Emily: Huh? Oh, it's fine. Oh, Honey, it's fine. Oh, you are so cute. You know, right now when you just said that, you were concerned about the baby. I know you are gonna make the best big brother ever.",
        "Daniel: I'll try. When is the baby coming out?",
        "Emily: Well, not anytime soon.",
        "Daniel: Oh, it's taking forever.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Well, tell me about it. Oh, I love you. Oh, your hair smells like sunshine.",
        "Daniel: You always say that. Mom, is something wrong?",
        "Emily: No, no. No, everything's fine and happy. I'm so happy. I'm thinking about you, and the baby, and what a wonderful, wonderful family we're gonna be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So what did you do?",
        "Meg: I told you, nothing. We told her we were engaged, and she flipped out. Okay, maybe --",
        "Tom: Maybe?",
        "Meg: Maybe she reacted that way because -- well, maybe she started telling herself that Paul and I weren't that close.",
        "Tom: Well, here's a shot in the dark. Emily wasn't telling herself that you weren't that close anymore. Paul was telling her.",
        "Meg: He didn't lie to her.",
        "Tom: Lie? Paul? Who would suggest such a thing? Besides, he doesn't have to lie to get Emily to do whatever he wants her to do, or to think whatever he wants her to think.",
        "Meg: You know what? You weren't there to see her in that ER -- how she was freaking out, her blood pressure shooting through the roof. And Paul there seeing that, knowing that she's carrying his child. Tom, even you would have done whatever it took to calm her down.",
        "Tom: Right. Against his very nature, Paul bit the bullet and conned someone, but all for the good of a child.",
        "Meg: You don't know what Paul's been going through.",
        "Tom: No one knows better than I what it's like to deal with Emily, but I'm not fooled by her, and I'm not her neighbor. But I do know what Paul did to her, so if he needs to deal with her fragile ego, let the punishment fit the crime.",
        "Meg: Tom, there are children involved here. Your child, Paul's child. Do you really want to leave their fate up to a crazy woman?",
        "Tom: Well, when you have a spare moment, you might want to mull over what's going on here right now. Paul's away, and his left behind girlfriend is moving heaven and earth to try to get someone else to do what Paul wants them to do. Does that have a familiar ring?",
        "Meg: You don't like Paul. But does that give Emily the right to keep his child away from him?",
        "Tom: Hmm. Legally, she might have a shot. So, the best Paul can hope for is that Emily takes into account how honest and above board he's always been and how easy he is for her to trust. And of course, his deep and abiding respect for the mother and child bond, like Jennifer and Johnny.",
        "Meg: Okay, you can go now.",
        "Tom: Look, I don't want her to leave. But if that's what she believes is best for my son and Paul's child, then so be it, because she would never hurt either one of them. She puts their welfare high above her own, and that's something that no one has ever, ever seen Paul Ryan do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: One, two, three, four, five -- no! [Daniel laughs] Stop laughing at your mother! Thanks a lot!",
        "Tom: Hey, what are you guys doing?",
        "Daniel: Hey, Dad. Mom's home.",
        "Tom: Looks like you're having fun. Is he -- is he creaming you?",
        "Emily: Creaming me? Let's just say this guy has quite a way with the dice.",
        "Margo: Hi. Hey, you want to come help me upstairs, Daniel?",
        "Daniel: You want me to go?",
        "Tom: Actually, I just wanted to have a talk with your mom. You mind?",
        "Daniel: Is something wrong?",
        "Tom: No, it's just kind of adult stuff. Not wrong, just boring.",
        "Daniel: Don't move your piece.",
        "Emily: Swear I won't. I need to talk to you. It's very important.",
        "Tom: Why are you leaving town?",
        "Emily: What? How did you know? How did you hear?",
        "Tom: I got a call from Meg this morning. She was recruiting allies.",
        "Emily: What did she say to you? You cannot listen to a thing she says. She doesn't -- you don't know the whole story.",
        "Tom: It is nothing to get upset about. She wasn't successful.",
        "Emily: I am so sorry. I cannot believe you heard it from her and not from me.",
        "Tom: I know. To tell you the truth, to hear Meg pitching that hard kind of gave me an indication of what you've been going through. I mean, you put her together with Paul. That can be formidable.",
        "Emily: And he's -- he's lying. He's been lying and tricking me. He will say anything to take this baby away from me, Tom, and I can't let him. Can Daniel hear us down here?",
        "Tom: Not as long as we stay calm and keep our voices down.",
        "Emily: So, you told her that you didn't have a problem if l leave town?",
        "Tom: I told her that you would never do anything to hurt denial or the baby.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Okay, it is official. You are the greatest guy ever.",
        "Tom: No, I just told the truth. I told her you would never do anything to hurt Daniel or the baby.",
        "Emily: I wouldn't. I swear to you I wouldn't. But thank you. I know that you could make my leaving very hard, so thank you.",
        "Tom: It's your decision. I know it's a painful one.",
        "Emily: My mom, my job and you -- I don't want to leave all those things behind.",
        "Tom: I know.",
        "Emily: But I have to. I can't trust Paul.",
        "Tom: I understand why you feel that way.",
        "Emily: Once I'm settled, you know, wherever I'm settled, I will call you. And you -- you can come see Daniel anytime you want. That goes without saying.",
        "Tom: Well, like I told Meg, you'll never do anything to hurt your children.",
        "Emily: My God, of course not.",
        "Tom: And that's how I know that you'll understand when you sit here and think about this -- Daniel cannot go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm really sorry. That came out so wrong. I just meant that you're not as young as you were before, when you were younger.",
        "Mike: I seemed young enough for you this morning.",
        "Katie: Oh, Honey, come on. I can't believe that a masculine guy like you is so threatened by this.",
        "Mike: Threatened?",
        "Katie: I'm simply asking you to provide a sample so that we can be sure we've covered all bases, baby-wise.",
        "Mike: Right.",
        "Katie: I'm not questioning your manhood. I'm just trying to be sensible.",
        "Mike: You know what you're being? Controlling.",
        "Katie: Oh. Oh, my God.",
        "Mike: Yes, you have taken this natural, beautiful, essentially fun process and turned it into a to-do list.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: You know why that nurse came out here and said that nobody laughs? Because when people come here, they're worried, okay? Because things have not gone right, and they're trying not to give up hope, okay? But we zoomed right past all that. We went from two incredible months to being completely miserable.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know why you're miserable. I'm not miserable.",
        "Mike: Okay, look, there's something you need to know about me. I don't like being steered. When somebody steers me, I have a strong urge to head in the other direction.",
        "Katie: Why are you so mad at me?",
        "Mike: Why don't you think about that?",
        "Dr. Chen: So, are things clearer now?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah. Real clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Will, I know you love Gwen. Gwen knows you love her. But --",
        "Will: I know. It's all my fault.",
        "Carly: Will, you know, I've given up any right to judge anyone for anything.",
        "Will: I can't believe what I did. But thank you. Thank you for not screaming at me or hating me.",
        "Carly: And what would be the point of making you feel worse than you already do?",
        "Will: Carly, she -- she really, really trusts you. If you can talk to her, just, you know, make her see that we can work this out, or that I will change --",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Will, this isn't something to try to talk her into. She has to feel herself, in her heart, that she can keep going with you. If she's pushed or she's talked into it, it's not gonna last.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And I really hope that it does work out. Here's what I told her -- that she has to concentrate on herself, on her own life, on being self- sufficient and strong. And I'm telling you the same thing. Don't go after her, just work on yourself and hope for the best.",
        "Will: Whatever.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Will: What?",
        "Carly: It's just me giving marital advice. It's funny.",
        "Will: Well, thanks for talking to me.",
        "Carly: Hang in there, Will.",
        "Will: What choice do I have?",
        "Carly: Take care. [Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Simon: Why aren't you here?",
        "Carly: Because I'm here.",
        "Simon: Do you have any idea how much work we've got? We should have started an hour ago.",
        "Carly: I'll be right there.",
        "Simon: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: What do you mean, what's wrong?",
        "Simon: Well, when I talk to you like that, you don't talk to me like this. So what's up?",
        "Carly: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. It's a real red letter day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack yells]",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Jack: Come on, you know better than to sneak up on someone who's holding an axe, Meg, seriously.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, excuse me.",
        "Jack: What the hell are you thinking?",
        "Meg: You're asking me that? You've chopped enough wood here to last through March -- of '09. So what did Carly do know?",
        "Jack: No, it has -- how do you know it's about Carly?",
        "Meg: Axe, wood.",
        "Jack: She didn't do anything. It's just -- we're divorced.",
        "Meg: Oh. You knew this was coming though, didn't you? I mean, you did agree to it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I agreed to it. It was the worst mistake I ever made.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Will: Just take what we feel for each other and what we said to each other in that church and throw it away.",
        "Gwen: I didn't throw it away, you did.",
        "Henry: What exactly is it that we have to fix?",
        "Simon: No matter how much you snarl and sneer and scrunch up your little face, you really are quite beautiful.",
        "Meg: Get her back, or we won't have any more trees.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay -- just put that thing down and listen to me, okay? If you made a mistake, do something about it. Besides make firewood.",
        "Jack: That's a great idea. Yeah, I'll do something about it. I'm curious, though. What the hell do I do?",
        "Meg: Oh, I don't know, grovel?",
        "Jack: Very funny.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, I'm sorry, all right. No more jokes. I swear. But Jack, we're talking about you and Carly. There never really is an end, is there?",
        "Jack: Isn't that pretty much what divorce is? Besides --",
        "Meg: Besides?",
        "Jack: She got the divorce. But Meg, I'm the one who ended it.",
        "Meg: So, is this a pride thing?",
        "Jack: No. Honestly, no, no. For a while there, yeah, at times, it was. But not now. I keep thinking about it, and the fact is, all the reasons I ended it are still in play. I just don't know what could change to make it all better.",
        "Meg: I see.",
        "Jack: And the other fact -- she's a part of me, Meg. It's not just the kids. She's my best friend.",
        "Meg: Okay, maybe -- just maybe -- the divorce is a step in the right direction. Listen, listen, listen. You've drawn a line through the past. Now, you can start over and do it right this time.",
        "Jack: Right. Right, 'cause divorce is known to bring people together.",
        "Meg: People? You're not people. You and Carly have never done anything like other people. As a matter of fact, I expect a very unique divorce. Jack, get her back. Or we won't have anymore trees.",

        "Tom: You know I'm right, Emily. Danny can't go.",
        "Emily: I need my son.",
        "Tom: Well, he needs to be here. Where it's stable. Don't you think you'll have enough to worry about with the move and the new baby?",
        "Emily: I just told him we were all going to be a family, Tom.",
        "Tom: You didn't lie. You, Danny, the baby -- will always be family. But if you feel it's necessary to leave town to protect the baby from Paul, then I must stay here and give Daniel the kind of love and attention that he deserves.",
        "Emily: Because I don't give that to him?",
        "Tom: Okay, I said that wrong. You and I are a team, bringing up this boy, okay? So, I don't say this to hurt you. I'm just trying to think about my son.",
        "Emily: Yeah, we're a team -- partners. I'm the one with the record.",
        "Tom: Now you know, I will do anything I can to help you with Paul. I understand that's an intense situation, but I'm putting my son first. He can't go.",
        "Emily: You know what is crazy? That I would actually turn on the one friend that I still have. But I am not crazy.",
        "Tom: I know that.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry if I upset you.",
        "Tom: You didn't upset me.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Margo: Everything okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, no everything's fine. Everything's fine. Um, I know what good care you take of Daniel -- both of you, really. I'm sorry if I disturbed you.",
        "Tom: Hey, you didn't disturb us.",
        "Emily: You know what, can you give Daniel a hug for me? I've got to go to the doctor's. I have an appointment.",
        "Tom: Listen -- anything I can do to help --",
        "Emily: Just pray for me. And thanks again for talking to Meg, you know. Maybe it'll help. Maybe Paul will get that you support me, and he'll back off. I don't know. I'll be in touch. I'll let you know when and what I decide.",
        "Margo: What was that all about?",
        "Tom: Paul is pushing her really, really hard. She's thinking about leaving town.",
        "Margo: With Daniel?",
        "Tom: Well, I was very nice about it. But I made it very clear. He's not going with her.",

        "Henry: I'm great.",
        "Simon: You know, that was a really stupid thing to say. I'm sorry. I heard.",
        "Henry: No, it's okay. It's all right. It's been interesting to say the least. People say what's new -- and then you watch them try to stuff the words back in their mouths. So don't worry.",
        "Simon: You know what? You and I, we should get together -- take your mind off things, throw a few back and lie about old times.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'd like that.",
        "Simon: All right, I've got a business meeting, but I'll give you a call, and we'll catch up.",
        "Henry: Thanks.",
        "Simon: So good to see you. And once again, I'm sorry.",

        "Carly: All right, I'm here. So let's have another one of our high-powered, titans of industry business meetings, okay?",
        "Simon: Oh, you're in a foul mood.",
        "Carly: Yes, I am as a matter of fact. And I'm looking forward to taking it out on you.",
        "Simon: Okay, fine. First of all, we've got to pare back on the fabric allotment and --",
        "Carly: And what?",
        "Simon: You know what, it really is amazing. Incredible. No matter how much you snarl and sneer and scrunch up your little face -- you really are quite beautiful.",

        "Gwen: So, I finally decided. Oakdale U. I'm gonna register this week.",
        "Casey: Cool, maybe we'll have some classes together.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Your enthusiasm is catching. You sound like you're registering for a root canal.",
        "Gwen: Casey, I have to tell you something -- no, you can't -- you can't do this. You can't follow me like this.",
        "Will: Gwen, you and I have to talk. We can solve this, but only if we talk --",
        "Gwen: No, we cannot solve this. Do you hear me? We cannot solve this.",
        "Casey: What's going on?",
        "Will: You can't just take what we feel for each other -- and what we said to each other in that church -- and throw it away.",
        "Gwen: I didn't throw it away. You did.",
        "Will: No, I didn't. I'm right about this, Gwen, and you know it.",
        "Gwen: No, please go.",
        "Will: I know this hurts, but if we can get past it --",
        "Gwen: Casey, can you please ask him to leave?",
        "Casey: Can you guys tell me what's going on first?",
        "Gwen: Do you, Will? Do you want to tell him what we're talking about?",
        "Will: Can we please just talk alone?",
        "Gwen: Well, I mean, if it's no big deal, if it's something that we can get past, then we can tell Casey, right? Hey Casey, guess what?",
        "Will: Don't do this -- stop.",
        "Gwen: Jade's pregnant.",
        "Will: Why are you doing this to yourself?",
        "Gwen: And guess who the father is --",
        "Casey: Oh, Man --",
        "Gwen: So can you, can you please get him out of here now? Can you understand why I don't even want to look at him right now?",
        "Will: Why? Why is it so different from you two?",
        "Gwen: What, you have to ask?",
        "Will: You know what, I can't seem to say or do anything right. So, I'm just gonna stop trying.",
        "Gwen: Want to know what the difference is? You and I weren't married! We weren't married -- I didn't even know. I hate her, Casey. I hate her so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: They told Tom?",
        "Emily: Meg told Tom that I was leaving town. Before I could tell him myself. They put everything in the worst possible light -- they tried to turn the father of my child against me --",
        "Henry: They told Tom that you were leaving? Did he freak out or what?",
        "Emily: No, no. He was great. He told me that he really put her in her place. Said it was my decision.",
        "Henry: Hmm.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Henry: Well, I just -- if that's where it ended, I wouldn't have gotten one of your red-alert phone calls. Now, what else was there Emily? What exactly is it that we have to fix?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I might be able to get some cheaper fabric, but if you cut back on the yardage, the drapes are gonna look really tacky.",
        "Simon: Cut back on the yardage?",
        "Carly: Or maybe I ought to just rethink the whole design, then.",
        "Simon: You pretend like I don't say anything at all.",
        "Carly: You said cut the budget. I'm trying to cut the budget.",
        "Simon: No, about you being beautiful and in a foul mood.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, Simon, if I reacted every time some man told me how beautiful I am, I'd never get anything done, now would I? Now if the drapes aren't full --",
        "Simon: Wow, wit, beauty and design sense -- you really are a most alluring package.",
        "Carly: Would you just can it? We made a deal. We were gonna put our personal lives on hold until we finish this project.",
        "Simon: Fine. Can I resume compliments once the project's over?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Simon. You can write me a damn sonnet, for all I care. Right now, what I want to know is why the design budget is being cut when it's the construction budget that's so over.",
        "Simon: Because Carly, it's way more fun to fight with you.",
        "Carly: Oh, no --",
        "Simon: What? Oh, okay I'm sorry. I promise I won't say anymore of those things again.",
        "Carly: No, it's not that. It's -- I don't have the paint charts. I can't finish the stupid model without the stupid paint charts, so now I'm gonna have to go and get them. Let's just hope there's just as much traffic as there was on the way over here, because I really wouldn't want anything to go right, would I?",

        "Meg: I know, you're welcome. I don't really like it when people tell me how to live my life. And I really hate when people think they know more about me than I do myself.",

        "Meg: Not without your okay.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Meg: You and Carly together. Pretty -- intense. Unpredictable. Maddening.",
        "Jack: Don't sugar coat it, okay?",
        "Meg: And you wouldn't have it any other way. Jack, women you get along with bore you. Carly doesn't bore you.",
        "Jack: I don't know. When she came in here with those divorce papers signed, she didn't seem all that upset.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah. Gee, she would never, ever play tough just to make sure that you didn't know you hurt her.",
        "Jack: Do you think -- what you said before -- that it could work?",
        "Meg: Can you be more specific.",
        "Jack: Maybe -- maybe the divorce was just a way of putting the past -- in the past? And then maybe, if we started over, knowing what we know now --",
        "Meg: Okay, okay -- how about this? In this life, if you get a shot at being happy, it's your damned fault if you don't take it.",
