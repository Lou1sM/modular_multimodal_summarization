        "Luke confides in Noah about how he is struggling with his mom and Damian. Noah suggests he provide support instead of judging because there are extenuating circumstances. Mason comes to see Noah and suggests they head out of town for a film festival. Noah is appreciative but resistant because he has to be there to support Luke, which Mason admits that he is envious. Jack and Meg discuss Meg's concerns about Lily and Damian's inappropriate \u0091relationship.' Jack goes to speak with Lily and finds an unseen Faith downcast, as she watches Lily and Damian kissing. Jack confronts Lily about her behavior as gently as he can, as Lily is upset that he is judging her. Jack suggests her children stay with him for the time being, but Lily is incensed thinking he wants to take away her kids. Damian defends Lily; but Jack is doing it for the kids. Jack thinks she us not handling them well and doesn't need to be shoving Damian (another father figure) into their life so soon after Holden's death. Faith wants to go, but Lily puts her foot down. Luke overhears and offers to move home for his siblings. A furious Damian confronts Meg, as she admits to him some jealousy but also explains that their actions make her feel as if they are forgetting about Holden. Damian apologizes but refuses to stop seeing Lily, which infuriates Meg, as she leans on Jack for support promising that what they are doing isn't right. Jack's and then Luke's words seem to finally have an affect on Lily, as she vows to make it right. Luke tells Noah that he needs to move out for a short time to take care of his family, as Noah is saddened but supportive. He then decides to head to the film festival with Mason after all. Eb thinks he should kill both Maeve and Holden for their trouble, but Holden finally convinces him that if he calls Lily, he can get ransom for him. The police show up at Eb and Mauve's, as Eb pretends to have no knowledge of who Skaggs is when they try to connect the two men. The police don't believe him and promise they will be putting him in jail because Skaggs killed a police officer. A worried Maeve secretly pleads with Holden not to leave her behind when he gets Eb the ransom fearing for her life. Holden promises he will take her with him. Eb is spooked and wonders if he should just get rid of Holden and head out of town, but Holden talks him down again and they head off to call Lily. Lily explains to Damian that her feelings for him haven't changed, but she can't be with him right now because she has to out her kids first. Damian wishes he could change her mind, but he promises not to go anywhere until she decides the time is right. Holden goes to call Lily as an officer is calling her. Damian answers the phone while Lily is out of the room. The officer tells him that the DNA evidence is back and the man in the car was not Holden, as a stunned Damian hangs up soon after. Holden gets a busy signal when he tries to call home and is about to try again when Eb spots a police officer and tells him to hang up. Lily asks Damian who was on the phone, as Damian looks to be contemplating giving her an honest answer."

        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Meg: Good morning.",
        "Jack: I fixed the rotary tiller. I make no guarantees.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you. You know, I was always aware Holden was tinkering with some piece of equipment. I just realize now how many things he did take care of. I tried to make a list. I didn't know where to start.",
        "Jack: We'll take each thing as it comes. You don't have to take Holden's place, Meg.",
        "Meg: Well, nobody can, no matter what some people may think.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Meg: Well, I guess things could be worse. I just miss my big brother. You know, I didn't always like what he had to say, but I trusted it.",
        "Jack: Well, I know it's not the same, but I'm willing to pinch hit for Holden, if you'll let me.",
        "Meg: As a matter of fact, there is something that has been bothering me, and I don't know what to do about it.",
        "Jack: Shoot.",
        "Meg: It's Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: You're still really mad at your mom and Damian, huh?",
        "Luke: Wouldn't you be?",
        "Noah: Yeah. But she did try to explain. She's been really messed up -- taking pills to go to sleep. And between that and being out of her mind with grief.",
        "Luke: Yeah, she wasn't thinking straight. I get that -- intellectually. I even told Faith that we should cut her some slack.",
        "Noah: But the wise big brother thing was just an act? What?",
        "Luke: Well, I guess if they had slept together once, then maybe I could handle it.",
        "Noah: Wait, wait. You told me this was a one-time deal.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I found out that weeks earlier, before my dad even died, there was something going on between them. I mean, it wasn't as extreme. They didn't hit the bed or anything, but they kissed. Faith saw them.",
        "Noah: Wow. Your sister has some bad luck.",
        "Luke: No, it's not luck, Noah. Faith might not say much, but she sees everything, and she is so smart about people. It's kind of like my dad. But she didn't tell anybody about this kiss until a couple days ago, and now I just can't get it out of my head.",
        "Noah: It was just a kiss.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but, Noah, if she loves my father, then what is she doing kissing Damian?",
        "Noah: I asked myself the same question when I found out you kissed Brian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm afraid Lily is still not handling Holden's death very well. Something happened.",
        "Jack: Go on.",
        "Meg: She took some sleeping pills, I don't know how many, but she walked into the pond, and she said she didn't know what she was doing.",
        "Jack: You don't think she tried to kill herself?",
        "Meg: Either way, it's not good.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Okay, so do you think she's getting addicted again?",
        "Meg: I don't know, but nobody sees her. She spends most of the time in her bedroom. She and Faith aren't even speaking. Luke is upset. And -- and I'm sure Natalie and Ethan sense something is wrong.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's the last thing they need to deal with right now.",
        "Meg: And that's not the worst of it. The other day, Lily all but attacked me.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Meg: Damian.",
        "Jack: What did he do now?",
        "Meg: Look, it's not really my place to say, but there's been some inappropriate behavior going on over there, and I'm really worried about the kids, Jack. I'm very worried. And I hate to say this, but --",
        "Jack: But you got to tell me. Meg, listen. I promised Holden that I'd look after those kids if anything happened to him. If they're in trouble, you got to let me know.",
        "Meg: Whatever is going on with Lily, she is seriously unstable right now, because that is the only legitimate excuse for letting those kids see what she and Damian are up to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: How are you feeling, Cara?",
        "Lily: I feel like the worst mother in the world.",
        "Damian: That couldn't be further from the truth.",
        "Lily: My daughter won't even look at me. And Luke's disappeared. I can't answer the phone, because it's my mother calling to tell me how I've let everyone down, and I guess I have. Nobody understands my choices. They won't even try.",
        "Damian: That's not true. You're not alone.",
        "Lily: Then why do I feel so lonely? You're the only thing that saves me. The problem is you're the thing they disapprove of.",
        "Damian: I don't care what your family thinks. I just want to be here with you, to help you through this.",
        "Lily: That may take a very long time.",
        "Damian: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Let Maeve go. She's in a lot of pain.",
        "Eb: So am I, from the knot that frying pan left on my head.",
        "Holden: That was my fault. I talked her into helping me escape. She didn't want to do it.",
        "Eb: Yeah, I'll bet.",
        "Holden: No, it's true. I told her -- I told her what she wanted to hear. I used her. So punish me. I deserve it. Leave her alone.",
        "Maeve: Don't waste your breath. Once Eb's made up his mind, there's no going back.",
        "Holden: She didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Eb: It doesn't matter. The little lady tried to beat my brains out with a skillet. She's got to be punished.",
        "Maeve: Sitting here smelling you is punishment enough.",
        "Eb: Oh, baby doll, this is only the beginning of what I got in store for you.",
        "Holden: Seriously, Eb, what's it gonna take? I want you to leave Maeve alone.",
        "Eb: If I had that robbery money Skaggs hid from me, I might be a little more likely to be lenient.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. If its money you want, you got it.",
        "Eb: I knew you knew where that money was.",
        "Holden: I'm not talking about the robbery money. I'm talking about ransom. It's the only way you're ever gonna get a dime out of me.",
        "Eb: So I write a note to your wife and I get paid off, just like that?",
        "Holden: All you have to do is call my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hi, Faith. What -- what's going on? Why aren't you in school?",
        "Faith: I left.",
        "Jack: You just left? Does your mother know?",
        "Faith: No. She's inside with Damian again, making out.",
        "Jack: Well, hello.",
        "Damian: Hello, Jack.",
        "Lily: Hi, Jack. How are you?",
        "Jack: Perhaps I should have called first.",
        "Lily: No, don't be silly. You're family. The door's always open for you.",
        "Jack: I thought things might have changed.",
        "Lily: Faith, Sweetie, why aren't you in school? Are you sick?",
        "Jack: No, she's fine. She just had a bad day. That's all. Right, Sweetheart? Listen, why don't you give your mom and I a few minutes to talk things out? Can you go upstairs for a bit?",
        "Faith: Yeah, okay.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Lily: Wow, she listened to you. That's impressive.",
        "Jack: She's a good egg.",
        "Lily: Yeah, she is. But she's -- she's really been acting out lately. I thought that stage was over, but ever since Holden --",
        "Jack: Yeah. She's, uh, she's missing her dad.",
        "Lily: We all are. If it were tears and confusion, I could manage it, but she's been so angry. I just don't even know how to get through to her.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm not really comfortable saying this, but for Holden's sake, I feel I must ask. What's going on with you two?",
        "Damian: That is none of your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eb: I get the dough, and I'm supposed to let you go?",
        "Maeve: That's how ransom works.",
        "Eb: Forget it. Uh-uh. You'll call the cops. They'll bust down my door, throw me the tank. Jail doesn't agree with me.",
        "Holden: You've held me all this time. Are you willing to just -- just give up with only a pair of corpses for all your hard work?",
        "Eb: Look, I want the money Skaggs hid from me, okay? That way, I don't get connected to the bank robbery or a kidnapping or anything else.",
        "Holden: And I told you. I don't know where the stolen money is. The only one who does is your buddy Skaggs, but unfortunately he died when my truck burned.",
        "Maeve: If Holden knew where the money was, don't you think he'd have told us by now? Come on. He knows it's his only way out. You gotta go to plan \"B.\" You gotta call his wife. She's rich. I seen her.",
        "Eb: Why, you little --",
        "Holden: Do you want your money or not?",
        "Eb: All right. All right. I'll call your wife. We'll see how much she thinks you're worth. But here's the deal. If the missus pays up, I let you go, but Maeve stays here. And if I find out you said one word about me to anybody, I'll put a bullet right between her eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I was drunk when I kissed Brian. It was extenuating circumstances.",
        "Noah: There usually are.",
        "Luke: Why are you still holding onto this?",
        "Noah: I am just playing devil's advocate. I mean, your mom's whole world just got turned inside out, and then she almost drowns in her sleep? I mean, those are extenuating circumstances.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, but it's completely different.",
        "Noah: I know, but anything can happen in a bad moment. Your mom must feel like her life is just out of control right now.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but, Noah, we're talking about before my father died. Our life was fine. Our family was happy.",
        "Noah: Okay. So it was an impulse. It was just a kiss. She said herself it was a mistake.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I'm not sure that I can believe that.",
        "Noah: You're not gonna know the real truth. She might not know herself. But it's over, okay? And you've got to stop holding onto it. That's just gonna make you feel worse.",
        "Luke: Noah, how can I let go? I mean, Damian has come in, and he's made his move. It's just like my father said. Damian came back here to get with my mom, and my father's accident cleared the way.",
        "Noah: You gotta stop beating up on your mother. She loves you. She needs your help, so help her.",
        "Luke: You're right. You're right. Maybe I can stop this before Damian does anymore damage. Thank you.",
        "Noah: Don't worry about it. They're my family, too, you know.",
        "Luke: Oh. Hi, Mason.",
        "Mason: Hey.",
        "Luke: How are you?",
        "Mason: Good. Don't leave on my account.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm not, I'm not. Good to see you.",
        "Mason: Good to see you.",
        "Noah: I got your message. What's up?",
        "Mason: How do you feel about another road trip?",
        "Noah: You got something special planned for the class?",
        "Mason: Nope, just the two of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's awkward for me, too, but it is my business. Holden's not only my cousin, he was my best friend. I've got an obligation to his kids. I'm worried about them, Lily.",
        "Lily: So am I.",
        "Damian: Lily's doing a terrific job with the children, which is not easy under the circumstances.",
        "Jack: I understand that, Damian, but this is between Lily and me.",
        "Damian: Are you asking me to leave?",
        "Lily: Jack, whatever you have to say to me, you can say it in front of Damian.",
        "Jack: All right, listen. I don't think that Faith is handling her father's death all that well. She hasn't been herself since she ran out of the funeral. And after what I witnessed just now --",
        "Lily: What you saw just now?",
        "Jack: Lily, the kids' lives are changing way too fast. They've been traumatized.",
        "Lily: We all have.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know that. But they need someone that they can depend on, someone who's not gonna fall to pieces without warning.",
        "Lily: Are you --",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. I'm not accusing you of anything. And I know it's a lot for you to handle. But for the time being, I think it would be a good idea for Faith and Natalie and Ethan to come stay with me at the farm.",
        "Lily: You can't take my kids away from me!",
        "Jack: Lily, hold on. They'd be with family out at the farm. Emma, Janet, and Meg -- we could all help keep an eye on them. And they'd feel closer to Holden that way.",
        "Lily: No, this is their home. They -- they belong with their mother, especially after what's happened.",
        "Damian: You have no legal right to those children.",
        "Jack: Okay, time out. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm merely asking you to consider it.",
        "Lily: Why on earth would I?",
        "Jack: Because you love your kids, and because they're struggling. Don't make it worse by letting them see you with another man in their father's bed.",
        "Lily: How dare you come in here and start throwing accusations around.",
        "Jack: What have I said thus far that's not true?",
        "Damian: That's not the point.",
        "Jack: Yes, it is. Obviously something is going on between the two of you, because when I drove up, Faith was on the terrace. She was too upset to come inside, because she saw the two of you in here making out.",
        "Lily: We thought that she was at school. That's where she's supposed to be.",
        "Jack: I'm not here to comment on your personal business, but if you're gonna flaunt your relationship in front of those kids.",
        "Lily: We weren't flaunting it. There was no way we --",
        "Jack: Faith is very sensitive. The last thing she needs is to be confronted with this right now.",
        "Lily: You think I'm an unfit parent.",
        "Jack: No, I think you're tired, Lily, and I think you're overstressed. I think you're grieving.",
        "Lily: My kids are all that I have left of Holden. If you take them away --",
        "Jack: Lily, I'm not taking them away. I just don't think that this is a very healthy environment for them at the moment.",
        "Damian: Because of me?",
        "Jack: Yes, absolutely because of you. It is too soon to bring another man into their lives. They have barely had time to deal with the death of their father, who, by the way, was not very fond of you.",
        "Lily: You know what, Jack? Why don't you worry about your kids? After all the trouble that Parker's been in, for you to presume --",
        "Jack: Did you know that Faith was confiding in Parker? He's worried about her, too. Again, I'm not -- I'm not gonna tell you how to run your personal life, but these kids -- it's too soon to bring another father figure into their life, especially him.",
        "Damian: I've done nothing but try to be supportive.",
        "Jack: This isn't about you, Grimaldi. We're all adults. This isn't the first family member we've lost. But to these kids, losing their dad has changed their entire world. They need to be the center of attention right now.",
        "Lily: And you don't think I can give them that?",
        "Jack: Right now, no. Lily, I'm sorry, I don't. I just think that until things change around here, they would be much better off living at the farm with me.",
        "Damian: Did Meg put you up to this?",
        "Jack: She's worried about the kids, Damian. We all are. She asked my advice.",
        "Lily: She didn't do it for the sake of the kids. She did it because she's angry at Damian.",
        "Jack: Well, can you blame her? The two of you broke her heart.",
        "Damian: Excuse me. I'll call you later.",
        "Lily: Jack, you're a good man. I know that you came here with the best of intentions, but you are wasting your time. My children aren't going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: The Minneapolis film festival. It's one of the biggies. I managed to scrounge up a couple of all-access press passes.",
        "Noah: I don't believe it. These things are like gold.",
        "Mason: Yeah, they are. But don't expect to sleep too much, 'cause the first screening's at 8:00 A.M., the last one is at midnight, and that's when all the networking begins. What do you say? You up for it?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I mean, who wouldn't be? But what about my classes?",
        "Mason: We'll call it \"Independent study.\" Come on. An experience like this is worth way more than a grade in a gut class. I mean --",
        "Noah: Yeah, unless that grade is incomplete.",
        "Mason: All right. Give me a copy of your calendar. I'll contact all your other profs.",
        "Noah: Oh, come on, like that's gonna work?",
        "Mason: Why not? Come on, the basketball team -- they take off like a week every time they've got a tournament.",
        "Noah: Why me?",
        "Mason: Because you're one of the best students I've ever had.",
        "Noah: Hmm.",
        "Mason: That and the fact that I can't drive myself. So if you don't come, I don't go.",
        "Noah: Well, I am really flattered, and this is an unbelievable opportunity, but you're -- you're gonna have to find somebody else.",
        "Mason: I didn't just hear that.",
        "Noah: Luke's family's in bad shape right now, and he's trying to make sure everybody's okay, which is impossible and not his job. That's Luke. And I need to be here with him.",
        "Mason: Well, do you ever do anything without wondering how Luke will feel?",
        "Noah: No. Um, nothing. Why? Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Mason: No. Maybe I'm just a little bit jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: How dare you.",
        "Meg: How dare I what?",
        "Damian: You don't seriously believe Lily's unfit to care for her own children.",
        "Meg: I don't know what you're talking about, Damian.",
        "Damian: You're lying! You went to Jack with a fairytale about how Lily and I are threatening or traumatizing her kids, and now he's trying to take them away.",
        "Meg: He is?",
        "Damian: Don't -- don't pretend you had nothing to do with it. You obviously put the idea in his head!",
        "Meg: All I did was tell Jack that I was worried about the kids, and I told him why. I had no idea what he was planning to do with that information.",
        "Damian: Of course you did.",
        "Meg: Well, if you have all the answers, why'd you come storming over here?",
        "Damian: Someone has to get you to mind your own business.",
        "Meg: Well, not you. I want nothing to do with you anymore. As far as I'm concerned, you're a bad memory.",
        "Damian: Look, you have every right to be angry. I made mistakes in our relationship.",
        "Meg: Like letting me believe we were having one?",
        "Damian: But it isn't Lily's fault. I should have been able to control myself. I just --",
        "Meg: I don't want to hear about this anymore.",
        "Damian: You had no problem discussing it with Jack, though. Look, if you want to blame someone, blame me, not Lily.",
        "Meg: Why? She could have said no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I feel like half of me has been ripped off, okay? It's all I can do to keep from curling up and praying to God to take me so that I can be with Holden.",
        "Jack: Please, please don't say that.",
        "Lily: It's okay. I don't -- I don't let the kids see it. But in my heart of hearts, if it weren't for them, there would be nothing for me here. And Damian -- he understands that. He -- he helps me. He keeps me strong so that I can be strong for my children.",
        "Jack: But you're not. They see Damian in your bedroom, and they assume their father's been replaced.",
        "Lily: I am devastated that Faith walked in on us, but Damian and I are the only people that know what really happened in that room, and we have nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Jack: Look, Lily, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth here. You and Holden were joined at the hip. How could you move on so fast? And with the one guy that Holden would never want for you in a million years.",
        "Lily: He's gone, Jack! It's the last thing in the world that I wanted, but it's a fact. And no matter what's happened between Damian and me, my husband isn't coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily can get her hands on a lot of money very quickly.",
        "Eb: My kind of gal.",
        "Holden: You just tell her when and where you want the money -- some anonymous location -- and she'll do it. And you can go pick it up. It'll be like going to a drive-through window at a bank.",
        "Eb: I don't -- I don't have much use for banks, unless I'm robbing them. So, uh, this wife of yours -- is she pretty?",
        "Holden: She's the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen. But she may not take your word that you have me.",
        "Eb: Even if I hack off an ear for proof?",
        "Maeve: That's not gonna do. She's not gonna believe it's his.",
        "Holden: The only way she's gonna believe you -- if she hears it from me.",
        "Eb: Oh. All right. How's that gonna work?",
        "Holden: You need to take me to a phone.",
        "[Eb laughs]",
        "Eb: I'm not gonna give you a chance to make a break for it. Forget it. We'll do this my way.",
        "Holden: Yeah? What are you gonna do?",
        "Eb: You're just gonna have to trust me.",
        "[Creaking]",
        "Maeve: Who is it?",
        "Eb: I'll be watching you. You keep your damn mouth shut!",
        "Maeve: You can't leave me here with him. He's never gonna forgive me for running off with you. The minute he gets his money, he's gonna shoot me dead.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that, and I'm gonna keep my promise. We're gonna get out of here -- together -- I promise you. Once I get back to civilization, I'm gonna find you a safe house.",
        "Maeve: One of them shelters?",
        "Holden: It's gotta be better than this.",
        "Maeve: Hell is better than this. Just don't leave me behind. Please.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Maeve: Who is it?",
        "Eb: It's the cops. They're right outside.",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Maeve: Almost there, Officer! Now what?",
        "Eb: Answer the door, but keep him outside. Go!",
        "Maeve: Oh. I'm sorry, Officer. I was just taking a bath when you knocked. May I help you?",
        "Officer Grady: Do you know a man by the name of Ebberly Stone?",
        "Maeve: Yeah, it's my husband.",
        "Eb: Oh, I didn't know we had company, Buttercup.",
        "Officer Grady: Are you Stone?",
        "Eb: Why do you want to know?",
        "Officer Grady: Well, a couple weeks back, a prisoner by the name of Bingham Skaggs escaped from the federal pen. You know anything about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You've always been a good mother, but right now you're not being yourself.",
        "Lily: Forgive me for not grieving the way you think I should.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, lady. You're better than this. And underneath all that self-pity, you know I'm right. It's not good for the kids to have Damian here. They need to feel protected. The farm -- the farm's perfect for that.",
        "Lily: This is their home.",
        "Faith: I want to go with Jack!",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Faith: I don't want to live here anymore. I want to move to the farm with him.",
        "Lily: Faith, no, absolutely not.",
        "Luke: What's going on here?",
        "Jack: I want to take Faith, Natalie, and Ethan to stay with me at the farm for a while.",
        "Faith: I'm gonna go pack.",
        "Lily: No, stop it, all of you. This has gotten completely out of control!",
        "Faith: I want to go.",
        "Lily: Faith, you don't get to make that decision. Honey, I am your mother. You belong with me.",
        "Faith: What do you care, anyways? You're always with Damian!",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Jack: Lily, this isn't forever, okay? Just 'til the kids get their bearings again.",
        "Lily: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Jack: Someone's got to put your kids first, Lily.",
        "Lily: No, this is a comment on me. You think that I betrayed Holden, so now you're trying to punish me.",
        "Jack: No one's punishing you.",
        "Lily: Well, it sure feels that way. But you know what? I don't care! Because my kids aren't going anywhere, and that is the end of it!",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, I guess there's nothing more to say.",
        "Faith: Great.",
        "Jack: Come on, kid. I'll give you a ride back to school.",
        "Luke: Look, Jack, I'll move back home for a little bit, keep an eye on the kids.",
        "Jack: That's a great idea. Thank you, Luke. If you change your mind, the door's always open. Let's go.",
        "Lily: So, now you're gonna act as designated spy?",
        "Luke: I don't have to spy on you, Mom. You and Damian are doing whatever it is that you're doing pretty much out in the open.",
        "Lily: Maybe that's because we have nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Luke: Mom, let's get real. You're scared, freaked out, and totally needy, and I understand that. But what you and Damian are doing is wrong, and you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You made a terrible mistake with Lily, and now it's tearing our whole family apart.",
        "Damian: I'm not the one who went to Jack. What were you hoping to accomplish, Meg? You think I'll see the error of my ways and then come running back to you?",
        "Meg: Why would I want you back in my life? Look, I know you thought I was jealous, and it's true. That was a part of it. But I went to Jack out of concern for my family. We are all grieving, Damian -- all of us. We lost Holden.",
        "Damian: I'm painfully aware of that.",
        "Meg: Not aware enough. Your relationship with Lily, it feels like -- it feels like a denial for my brother. Like you've both forgotten that he's ever existed. Why can't you see that?",
        "Damian: What do you want me to do, Meg? Never see Lily again? Stop talking to her? Is that what you're asking?",
        "Meg: Yeah. If you are the gentleman that you pretend to be, that's exactly what you would do.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry I hurt you and your family. All I can say is that I hope time will heal those wounds.",
        "Meg: Wait a minute! Are you saying you're gonna continue your relationship with Lily?",
        "Damian: If she'll have me.",
        "Meg: How could you do this?",
        "Damian: Because some things are meant to be, and Lily and I -- we belong together, no matter who's against it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mom, I don't mean to sound like I'm judging you. This is just how I feel.",
        "Lily: I understand.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, I'm gonna go home and pack, and I'm not coming home to spy on you. It's so that I can help out with Faith and the others. And whenever you need to talk, I'll be here.",
        "Lily: It'll be good to have you home, Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eb: Skaggs? Skaggs? No, sorry, Officer. Never heard of him.",
        "Officer Grady: Save it. We know you and Skaggs were tight. You knocked off a bank a couple years ago.",
        "Eb: A bank? No, you -- you must have me confused with somebody else.",
        "Maeve: Yeah. Eb's never even spent a night in jail.",
        "Eb: Not for anything serious, anyway. Bank robbery -- that's a new one.",
        "Officer Grady: We know you did it. We just didn't have enough evidence to charge you. And Skaggs wouldn't give up his accomplice. So the night he escaped, naturally we thought of you.",
        "Eb: Well, you thought wrong.",
        "Officer Grady: We know Skaggs had help from the outside, and we have a witness says they saw a man with his description getting into a truck with somebody else the night that he took off.",
        "Eb: I don't know what to tell you, Officer. It wasn't me.",
        "Officer Grady: The thing is, Ebberly --",
        "Maeve: He hates that name. It's \"Eb.\"",
        "Officer Grady: As I was saying, Ebberly, Skaggs executed a cop the night that he escaped. We're gonna find him. And when we do, we're gonna throw the book at both of you.",
        "Eb: Get that gag off of him.",
        "Maeve: Come on. Come on. Come on. Easy, easy. Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: They think you're a cop killer. They're gonna be watching your every move.",
        "Eb: Lousy bunch of buzzards. And Skaggs -- what kind of moron kills himself a cop and thinks he can get away with it?",
        "Maeve: Well, maybe you ought to call Holden's wife before the cop comes back.",
        "Eb: No, no. There's been a change of plans. That ransom scheme of yours -- that ain't gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: You jealous of Luke? Mason --",
        "Mason: No, I'm not jealous of -- of your relationship. It's very -- it's evolved.",
        "Noah: You should have seen us when we first got together.",
        "Mason: Yeah, well, you're great now. I mean, it's amazing. You guys -- you think of each other. You put the other person first. It's fabulous.",
        "Noah: You make it sound like it's unusual.",
        "Mason: You must have learned it somewhere.",
        "Noah: Not really. I mean, my mother wasn't in the picture growing up, and I haven't been around that many same-sex couples, not that that would be necessarily different than straight couples. But if Luke and I are doing something right, it's because of Luke.",
        "Mason: Oh, don't sell yourself short. Come on. I mean, the great thing about the two of you is that you do everything 50-50, right? Right? Right? Right. Right. So it means that whenever something goes well, you got to take credit for it. When it goes bad, well, you got to share the responsibility, too, but --",
        "Noah: Yeah, but that's what a relationship is, right?",
        "Mason: Yeah, when it's good, not that I've ever had one.",
        "Noah: What about you and George?",
        "Mason: Just because you live together doesn't mean that you do it right. What George and I had -- it never came close to what you and Luke have.",
        "Noah: I guess I'm just lucky.",
        "Mason: Yeah. Luke's lucky, too.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Sorry. Can I talk to you for a moment?",
        "Mason: Yeah. Go. I'll be here.",
        "Noah: Yeah, what's up? Is it Faith? Is everything okay?",
        "Luke: Faith -- Faith is fine at the moment. I really hate to do this. I have to move out for a little bit. My family needs me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Think about it, Eb. If you want out of this situation, you're gonna need money.",
        "Eb: How am I supposed to pull that off with the cops dogging my every move, huh? I can't go anywhere. I can't call anyone. No, no, no. I gotta lay low, which means I can't be hiding you here anymore.",
        "Maeve: Why not? The cop was just here. He didn't suspect anything.",
        "Eb: Yeah. It would have been different if he had a warrant. Next time he'll have one. No, I got to get rid of the evidence.",
        "Holden: Meaning me?",
        "Eb: Yeah. You catch on quick, Amigo.",
        "Maeve: No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Eb, don't go off half-cocked now. Just -- just think about it. You can still get your hands on the ransom.",
        "Holden: She's right. My wife will not tell the cops if I tell her not to.",
        "Eb: Yeah. That's what they all say.",
        "Holden: No, this will work. I swear to you it will. You'll have your money, you'll be rid of me, you can move out of town. You can leave the country if you want.",
        "Eb: Why would we want to do that?",
        "Holden: Do you really want to live under the thumb of the cops? They're gonna be watching you, day in and day out. They're gonna take potshots at you for thinking that you killed one of their brothers. Do you want that?",
        "Eb: Hell, no.",
        "Holden: Well, then drive me into town. You can keep the gun on me. You can keep me tied up, whatever. Just get me to a phone so I can call Lily and get you your money.",
        "Eb: How long will all this take?",
        "Holden: She has access to a private plane.",
        "Maeve: See? I told you she was rich.",
        "Holden: She can have you your money within an hour. Then you will have your freedom, I will have mine, and you will never ever have to see me again.",
        "Eb: Okay.",
        "Maeve: You mean it?",
        "Eb: I said so, didn't I? Wait a minute. What if your wife doesn't want you back?",
        "Holden: If you knew us, you wouldn't ask that question.",

        "Damian: I just came from Meg. She's every upset.",
        "Lily: We've made a lot of people very unhappy.",
        "Damian: And I'm sorry about that. But I don't regret what we've done. The important thing is that we found each other again, Lily. Even though, I grant you, we made a bit of a mess.",
        "Lily: Yes, we have, but not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: This isn't gonna be for long, not at all, just until my mom gets better.",
        "Noah: Can I help?",
        "Luke: You can keep my side of the bed warm.",
        "Noah: You don't even have to ask. Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Luke: Maybe you'll finally be able to catch up on your schoolwork without me as a distraction.",
        "Noah: Wait. I'm still gonna get to see you, though, right?",
        "Luke: Oh, yes. Yes, of course. But I do have to stick pretty close to home for the time being. Noah, thank you so much for understanding. You are truly amazing.",
        "Noah: Do you want me to come home and help you pack?",
        "Luke: If you come home, I'll never leave.",
        "Noah: Yeah, so it looks like I'll be able to go with you after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Holden always thought that Damian wanted more from Lily than he would admit to. Looks like he was right.",
        "Meg: He always had a sixth sense about people. I should have listened to him more often.",
        "Jack: 20-20 hindsight, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe if I hadn't fallen for Damian's charm, then he would have left town.",
        "Jack: Don't do that. Don't blame yourself, please.",
        "Meg: I wanted Damian.",
        "Jack: You were in a crazy place in your life. Damian just happened to be nearby. People do it all the time.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but I actually convinced myself that I could make it work with him. I mean, what kind of an idiot am I?",
        "Jack: Stop it. Don't even think about the guy. He's not worth it.",
        "Meg: No, he's not, and that's why I hate to see Lily doing what she's doing. It's not right. It's just not right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Damian, my feelings for you haven't changed, but we can't sleep together anymore -- not now. I can't risk hurting my children.",
        "Damian: Jack shouldn't have said those things. He should know better. He should know that you would never intentionally harm your children.",
        "Lily: But I have hurt them. And up until now, I didn't realize how much. But now that I know --",
        "Damian: Lily, listen to me. You're being too hard on yourself.",
        "Lily: No, I am just trying to be a good mother.",

        "Lily: I'm saying \"Not now.\"",
        "Damian: Then I'll wait for you, Lily, until you're ready. I'll wait for as long as it takes.",

        "Damian: Officer Grady, this is Damian Grimaldi. We met when I came down to Kentucky after Mr. Snyder's accident.",
        "Officer Grady: Right. You were there with one of the family. His sister, was it?",
        "Damian: Yes. May I ask, what is this call about?",
        "Officer Grady: There have been some urgent new developments Mrs. Snyder needs to know about.",
        "Damian: Mrs. Snyder can't come to the phone right now. May I take a message?",
        "Officer Grady: Well, I just got a call from the lab. The DNA results finally came in on that body we found in Snyder's truck. It wouldn't have taken so long except that they had to extract the DNA from the teeth.",
        "Damian: I remember. I remember. What was the finding?",
        "Officer Grady: The DNA in the body wasn't a match. The man in that vehicle was not Holden Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: The line's busy.",
