        "Gwen: So what are you saying? That I should just forget that Will got another woman pregnant?",
        "Casey: How about you focus on all the stuff he's done right. Starting with stepping up when I let you down. If he hadn't been there, you'd have gone through that whole pregnancy alone. I mean, he ran away with you twice. At a huge risk -- he could've gone back to that institution or got arrested. But he didn't care. All he cared about was helping you.",
        "Gwen: You don't think I know that?",
        "Casey: So take him back. You guys can work it out -- it's not like he loves Jade.",
        "Gwen: They're having a kid, Casey.",
        "Casey: So? Yeah, I know, it's hard. It hurts. But you love kids. And it's not the kid's fault that it's got Jade as a mom. The kid will probably end up living with you anyway when Jade blows it, which she will. So it'll be one big happy family. I mean, look at your sister -- she's got kids from all over the place.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but she and Jack -- they have Sage.",
        "Casey: So? You and Will, I mean -- I'm talking someday, like, down the road, like after school -- you guys will have your own kids.",
        "Gwen: I can't have children, Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Can you believe how cold it is out there?",
        "Jade: Summer's always over too soon.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that's bizarre. It's like February outside. So, have you talked to Will since last night?",
        "Jade: Oh, I left him a couple of messages. But he hasn't gotten back to me yet.",
        "Luke: Oh, Jade, I'm sorry.",
        "Jade: No, he'll call. It's not like they're back together -- she is not going back to Will.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.",
        "Jade: After what she said to me last night, she's not gonna be able to accept that I'm having Will's child.",
        "Luke: Yeah, she might be angry right now, but in a few weeks -- in a few days -- I mean --",
        "Jade: No, Luke, you did not see her face.",
        "Luke: I'm just saying. If Gwen has second thoughts about this -- and chances are, she's gonna -- what will you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Simon, wait. You don't know where the paint charts are. I don't even know where the paint charts are --",
        "Simon: How many places can they be?",
        "Carly: Well, last week I found my brand new toothbrush in the freezer.",
        "Simon: All right, I'll tell you what. I'll call you if I can't find them, but in the meantime, will you please deal with the movers?",
        "Carly: Yes, I will help the movers. Big, strong me.",
        "Simon: If you leave me with the movers, then all that furniture that you ordered will end up in the wrong position. And then, who'll have to move it again? Me.",
        "Carly: We're gonna have to move it again anyway when we paint --",
        "Simon: Do you have any idea how much work we've got to do on this apartment still? The broker's open house is in, like --",
        "Carly: Right. Well then let's just stop wasting time arguing. I will stop by my house, and I will pick up the paint charts --",
        "Simon: You'll get trapped, I know you.",
        "Carly: What is gonna keep me there, Simon? What? Laundry? I will be out of there in ten minutes, tops.",
        "[Doorbell ringing]",
        "Jack: You're working, aren't you, Carly? That means you're gonna be famished when you get home. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "[Carlos whistles]",
        "Rachel: The girl cleans up.",
        "Lucy: I'm having dinner with a friend.",
        "Rachel: That's how you dress to meet a friend?",
        "Carlos: Guess that means we're not friends.",
        "Lucy: Oh, stop it. How's the wait?",
        "Rachel: You want a table for two, it's endless.",
        "Carlos: We'll go check in with Memorial and be back later.",
        "Lucy: All right. Hey -- I'm glad you could make it. I hate eating alone. I hope you made a reservation. I hear there's a wait on tables for two --",
        "Dusty: Well, let's make it a table for three. If you don't mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: First love is a really powerful thing. I mean, look at my parents. They've been together for such a long time, and they've had numerous reasons to break up -- and they have, a bunch of times.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but neither of them had a child with somebody else.",
        "Luke: Yeah -- me.",
        "Jade: Oh, Damian. I forgot.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, both of my parents have spent time with other people, but it never works. They always get back together.",
        "Jade: And had children together, of their own. Gwen and Will can't have kids.",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Jade: Gwen can't have kids.",
        "Luke: But I thought she had a kid with Casey Hughes --",
        "Jade: Yeah, she did and -- I don't know, she had some sort of an accident, and -- whatever, it's all over for her.",
        "Luke: How do you know?",
        "Jade: Well, she told me.",
        "Luke: When? Last night?",
        "Jade: No, no. She told me a while ago. And I feel terrible for her. I still feel bad. I didn't intend on getting pregnant. We used protection. We didn't want to get pregnant. It -- it just happened.",
        "Luke: Well, even if Gwen won't take Will back -- which, you know, he wants to be with her --",
        "Jade: Your point is?",
        "Luke: Well my point is, is even if they get divorced -- it doesn't mean that he's gonna come running to you.",
        "Jade: I know Will. Will is not going to abandon his child.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's gonna marry you --",
        "Jade: Who said anything about marriage?",
        "Luke: Look, all I'm just saying, Jade -- Will loves Gwen.",
        "Jade: Okay, and I ruined it. Too bad. I don't care what you think --",
        "Luke: No, I'm not saying that I think that, it's just -- well, you know, this is a small town and --",
        "Jade: Yeah, I know. And everybody hates me. So what? I'll survive.",
        "Luke: What's that?",
        "Jade: Oh, I ran into Casey's grandmother at Crash. She gave it to me to give to him. I should probably get going. I'm not really looking forward to it. Casey's a really big \"Gwen and Will\" fan.",
        "Luke: Ha ha! So you do care about what people think!",
        "Jade: Don't you? Admit it. It really, really hurts when people are talking about you and they don't know the first thing about how you feel or who you are.",
        "Luke: I am so not looking forward to going back to school. I'm sure it's gotten around.",
        "Jade: Everybody knows you're out?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. I'm sure the entire school knows that I'm gay.",
        "Jade: Has anybody said anything?",
        "Luke: No, it's just the opposite. My phone hasn't rung once.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?",
        "Jade: Well, we'll both be the town outcasts.",
        "Luke: The gay kid --",
        "Jade: And the whore! Whatever -- that's what I know everybody's saying. But too bad. Because I'm not going anywhere, and neither is my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Sorry to bring you down.",
        "Casey: I'm so sorry, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: It's okay. He said that he didn't mind -- that we could adopt -- and that's what we were going to do once we'd finished school. We were gonna adopt a lot of kids -- all kinds, from everywhere -- any kid that, you know, needed a home. 'Cause we needed that. To make a family, a good one.",
        "Casey: Sounds great.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. And you know what? I knew that it didn't matter. Because after Johnny, I knew that I could love any baby that you put into my arms. I knew that it would be fine. That after time, it wouldn't matter that I couldn't have my own. And then this happened. And it makes me sick inside to think about it, and it really scares me.",
        "Casey: I think that it'd hurt even if you could have kids.",
        "Gwen: Not like this. See, it's not that -- it's not that I don't love Will or that I don't remember all the incredible things that he's done for me. It's not even him. It's me. I can't get past it. The fact that Will and I can't have kids, and we want one so much. And here's Jade -- and she doesn't even care. When I would give anything, I would give absolutely anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I hope you don't mind.",
        "Lucy: Why would I mind? Hey, Johnny. How's my little brother doing?",
        "Dusty: Well, the sitter's running late, and Barbara's out of town --",
        "Lucy: Well, like she'd want to baby-sit so you could have dinner with me.",
        "Dusty: Barbara's not an issue anymore. I spoke to her. She understands how I feel. So, it's you, me and Johnny boy until the sitter gets here.",
        "Lucy: Has he had dinner? We could order him some applesauce, if you want, while we wait --",
        "Dusty: Oh, no, he's cool, he's cool. He ate before we left.",
        "Lucy: Superdad.",
        "Dusty: I had a good teacher.",
        "Dusty: You think he's old enough?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, why not? We could get a matinee, and we could leave when Johnny's, you know, had enough fun. You know, kids love the colors and the music and the lights, so -- have you ever seen him while you're driving at night?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, he loves lights.",
        "Lucy: Same thing.",
        "Dusty: What do you say, Johnny boy? You want to catch a flick with Lucy and me?",
        "Lucy: I'll even let you two share my red licorice.",
        "Dusty: Oh, no. That's okay.",
        "Lucy: Oh, come on. He might like red licorice.",
        "Dusty: No, I'm sure he wouldn't.",
        "Lucy: Oh, is he a candy snob like his dad?",
        "Dusty: Yep.",
        "Lucy: So what do you say? You have a sweet tooth? Come here, hey -- hi, honey.",
        "Dusty: I think he's got a sweet tooth for you.",
        "Lucy: You think?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, look at him. [Cell phone beeps] My sitter insists on sending me text messages.",
        "Lucy: Oh, yes, us young people like to do that.",
        "Dusty: Johnny, are you gonna let her talk to me like that?",
        "Lucy: Here, let me see. This is how you do it. Um, okay. See -- on -- my -- way.",
        "Dusty: I got it. And I'll be right back.",
        "Lucy: All right. Bye bye!",
        "Dusty: Say, bye, Buddy.",
        "Manager: You're beautiful.",
        "Lucy: Um, thank you.",
        "Manager: It also happens to be the title of a song. We need volunteers for karaoke night.",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, I could never --",
        "Rachel: If I can do it, you can do it.",
        "Lucy: I can't sing --",
        "Carlos: Neither can Rachel -- [Laughter] Ow!",
        "Manager: Your friends have assured me you're quite the songbird.",
        "Lucy: I can sing -- you know, in the car, in the shower --",
        "Manager: You're hired.",
        "Lucy: Oh, I can't. Okay, okay, but it has to be something I can actually sing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay. Beer is on ice -- get this out of the way. [Car pulling up] What are you doing here?",
        "Simon: I guess I could ask you the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, boy.",
        "Mover 2: What my partner means is that, we've got to get going.",
        "Carly: Sure. Okay, yeah, I understand. And thank you both. I know I've been a little demanding.",
        "Mover 1: Who, you?",
        "Mover 2: It always takes a while to get used to something new.",
        "Carly: Yeah -- yeah, I guess you're right about that. Oh, Simon, where are you? Why'd I let you go get the paint charts?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, where -- where's Carly? And what are you doing with her keys?",
        "Simon: Oh, Carly asked me to swing by and pick up something for the apartment we're remodeling. So, she gave me the keys. Do you mind?",
        "Jack: Oh, okay. So she's working, that's where she is?",
        "Simon: Yeah, she's working. She's very busy, Jack. And listen, between you and me, I'm not sure how happy she's gonna be if she comes back and finds you here.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I wouldn't make the mistake of telling me what you think my wife needs.",
        "Simon: Ex-wife, Jack. I mean, that's what you wanted, wasn't it? It was your idea, right? The divorce, breaking up the happy family? You couldn't forgive and forget. Now Carly's moved on. And yet, here you are.",
        "Jack: I have every right to be here, Simon.",
        "Simon: And the roses and the candles? What's that all about, Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You're going to have a family someday, too.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I hope so.",
        "Casey: And I'm sorry that I came down on you about walking out on Will. I get it. And I promise that no matter what you want to do, you've got my support. 100%.",
        "Gwen: You know what I'd like to do right now? I would like to go down to school and register for classes.",
        "Casey: All right. Just let me go inside and change my shirt --",
        "Gwen: Please?",
        "Casey: Oh, and you should think about Emerson's poli-sci. He's supposed to be some kind of genius.",
        "Gwen: Poli-sci? I'm a music major.",
        "Casey: Who needs something to sing about, hello? Like politics? And global warming?",
        "Gwen: I can just see it now -- a pop ballad about global warming headed straight to the top of the charts.",
        "Casey: Hey, you've got to broaden your horizons. Trust me on this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lucy: Hey, handsome, where you going?",
        "Jade: You know what the difference between me and you is? No matter what Will did, I would never, never leave him.",
        "Simon: You really care about her? Leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Will, you okay? I heard that Gwen was really upset when she found out about Jade and the baby.",
        "Will: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Luke: Well, you knew it would be tough. But I still feel like -- I don't know -- like she can get over it.",
        "Will: I don't think so.",
        "Luke: Will, come on. You've got to give it time.",
        "Will: Luke -- my marriage is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Did Will send you here?",
        "Jade: Why would he do that? He knows how you feel about me and the baby.",
        "Gwen: You know, I don't have any bad feelings about the baby.",
        "Jade: Oh, just me and Will. You're making a huge mistake. Your husband still loves you --",
        "Gwen: Wow, you should've thought of that prior to copulating with him.",
        "Jade: You know what the difference between and me and you is? No matter what Will did, I would never, never leave him.",
        "Gwen: You must be an inspiration to women everywhere.",
        "Jade: You know, you can say what you want, but the fact of the matter is you're the one ending the marriage -- not Will. So don't go feeling sorry for yourself or blaming me. Will and I got together because you turned your back on him -- again and again and again. This is just more of the same.",
        "Casey: Where's Gwen?",
        "Jade: I don't know. She was on her way out when I got here. I guess she had someplace to be. Your grandmother wanted me to drop these off. It's the schedule for next week. So, I guess I'll see you at work.",
        "Casey: Wait, Jade. About that -- that's not gonna work out anymore.",
        "Jade: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You want her back, Jack? Is that it?",
        "Jack: This is none of your business.",
        "Simon: Hey listen, man, I don't blame you. Hey -- I mean, there are plenty of women I wanted back after I let them go -- and you're on the right track -- candles, roses -- nice touch.",
        "Jack: All right, you know what? I'm going to be as polite as I can possibly be with you right now and ask you to, please, leave.",
        "Simon: And leave you here to ambush Carly when she gets home? You have any idea what you put that woman through?",
        "Jack: I am not having this conversation with you right now.",
        "Simon: Why? Talk to me.",
        "Jack: No, because I think it's wildly inappropriate for you to be mouthing off about my relationship with Carly when you have no idea what it was like or what it meant --",
        "Simon: No, you're right, I don't. I don't. All I know is that Carly and I are friends -- we work together, and she tells me what's going on. All right? But do you -- do you think it's right to waltz back in here and give her false hope, just cause you're suddenly feeling regret?",
        "Jack: You have no idea what it's like to be married and have kids and the responsibility it takes to carry on everything that goes along with it!",
        "Simon: Kids I've got no idea about, but being married I do know. I know what it's like to lose a wife because you're too stupid to hold onto a good thing.",
        "Jack: You don't care anything about Carly, are you kidding me? All you care about is getting in her pants.",
        "Simon: Don't go there, all right? I think she's an amazing woman, and I am there for her right now. That's it.",
        "Jack: Well, that's very comforting.",
        "Simon: Bottom line, Jack. She feels good about herself for the first time in months. Now don't take that away from her because the divorce didn't turn out the way you wanted it.",
        "Jack: I'll be damned if I'm gonna take any advice from you --",
        "Simon: Why not? Hey, listen to me. What? I have made more mistakes with women than you could possibly know. But you haven't -- this is new territory for you, Jack. 'Cause you're one of the good guys. Too good. That's your problem. Now, you walked out on a good thing because it wasn't perfect, and now you have to live with that. No walking back in here, trying to make yourself feel better. That's not fair to her, and you know it. Listen, Jack -- you really care about her? Leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlos: Lucy, you're breaking my heart.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rachel: You sure you don't mean your ears?",
        "Lucy: Hey, handsome, where you going?",
        "Lucy: Was I that bad?",
        "Dusty: You were great. I gotta go.",
        "Lucy: You're going?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. We'll do it another time.",
        "Lucy: Well, if the sitter can't stay, we can go upstairs --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, no. You haven't even eaten yet.",
        "Lucy: Well, we'll order room service.",
        "Dusty: That's no fun. Stay with the music. Stay with your friends.",
        "Lucy: They're due back at the hospital soon. And besides, I wanted to spend some time with you.",
        "Dusty: It's just that Johnny's not -- he acting really fussy. I don't know what the problem is. But I should get back there.",
        "Dusty: Well, it could be a tooth, I don't know. But I don't want to take any chances.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I don't blame you. You want me to take a look at him?",
        "Dusty: No, no. He's okay. Trust me.",
        "Lucy: No, it's no problem -- my bag's in the car --",
        "Dusty: I said no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Bingo.",
        "Gwen: Hello, Simon --",
        "Gwen: Pizza and beer -- that's her favorite.",
        "Simon: Well, she does work hard.",
        "Gwen: Yes, she does. Is she upstairs?",
        "Simon: No, actually, she's still over at the site.",
        "Gwen: Do you know when she'll be back?",
        "Simon: No idea. We're kinda working really hard on the apartment at the moment, so --",
        "Gwen: Yeah, and then there's beer -- and that's a pretty big pizza --",
        "Simon: Yes, it's huge.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Simon: Yeah, hey, listen. Do you want me to get her to call you, or -- no?",
        "Gwen: No, that's okay. I was just wondering.",
        "Simon: All right. Well, better --",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Simon: Listen, great to see you.",
        "Gwen: You, too.",
        "Simon: All right, you take care.",
        "Gwen: Goodnight.",
        "Simon: Goodnight.",
        "Gwen: Carly, what are we doing? How did our lives go so wrong so fast?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You can't fire me -- I'm pregnant. It's against the law.",
        "Casey: You're part-time. I can do whatever I want.",
        "Jade: Casey, please --",
        "Casey: Look, I'm sorry. But, that's the way it's got to be.",
        "Jade: This is because of Gwen.",
        "Casey: No, this is because with you around, it's not a happy working environment --",
        "Jade: So I'll work a different shift.",
        "Casey: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Jade: No, you're not. You blame me for what happened with Will and Gwen. This is not my fault. You of all people should understand that.",
        "Casey: I've made my share of mistakes --",
        "Jade: So why is this my mistake and not Will or Gwen's?",
        "Casey: Look, I'm not judging you, Jade. I just can't have you and Gwen under the same roof. I'm looking out for business. And Gwen's full time -- in charge of music. And you're just a --",
        "Jade: Part-time waitress.",
        "Casey: That's what it comes down to.",
        "Jade: You really believe that? That this is just business?",
        "Casey: Look, Gwen's going to suffer every time she has to watch you walk in with your kid, okay? Is that what you want to hear?",
        "Jade: Think about this, Casey. This is the second time you've thrown another pregnant woman out into the cold.",
        "Casey: I'm sure you'll find someplace warm to curl up to. You always do.",

        "Will: I lost everything. My wife, all the plans we made --",
        "Luke: You don't know that.",
        "Will: She won't even talk to me. She's so hurt, and it's because of me. I can't believe I was so stupid. I went through that whole thing with her, you know, with Casey. She got pregnant because she was drunk and had sex with him. And I was there with her throughout the whole thing. And then I turn around and I do the exact same thing. It's awful.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it happens to a lot of people.",
        "Will: No. I knew better.",
        "Luke: Will, sex is this -- this big, complicated thing, and the fact that you and Gwen have both made mistakes in that area -- I think it just proves that you're human.",
        "Will: She doesn't see it that way.",
        "Luke: She's hurt.",
        "Will: Yeah, it's more than that. She can't handle it.",
        "Luke: Give it some time. [Cell phone rings] It's my dad. Hey. Oh, how is she? Okay, I'll be over as soon as I can. I've got to get to the hospital.",
        "Will: Your mom okay?",
        "Luke: No change. Anyway --",
        "Will: Yeah, thanks. And I'm sorry that I dumped all of this on you.",
        "Luke: No, Will, you don't understand what it means to me that you'd share this stuff with me. That you're still my friend.",
        "Will: Why wouldn't we be friends?",
        "Luke: Well, a lot of reasons. But I've got to go. Just do me one favor?",
        "Will: Don't worry, I'm not going to get wasted and do something stupid.",
        "Luke: Okay, good. But that's not what I was going to say. Look, I know you're angry and frustrated. But try not to take it out on Jade. She's having a really tough time, too.",

        "Carly: How did this get here?",
        "Jack: Carly? I knocked, you didn't hear me --",
        "Carly: What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I need to talk to you --",
        "Carly: Is it the kids? My cell phone's been on --",
        "Jack: The kids are fine. They're asleep at Emma's.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Jack: There's no other way to say this. I have been a class-a jerk. You were right. I was judging you when I should've been getting down on my knees every day and thanking you for being my wife. For raising my children and doing everything you could to support me and keep our family together. But, instead -- I blew it. I broke your heart, I upset the kids --",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: No, listen. Listen, I know I don't deserve a second chance. I don't even deserve the right to ask you to hear me out. But if you love me half as much as I love you -- Carly, I have been miserable. It's just not the same without you. And I know it's asking a lot -- you've obviously moved on. You've got a great new job, a new life. And maybe -- maybe you are happy. But if there's a part of you that misses our life together, that -- that misses me. Please, give me a chance to make that up to you. Marry me. Take me back.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack -- Jack -- Simon?",
        "Simon: Where are you going? We were just getting started.",
        "Simon: What's got you going?",

        "Jade: Have you seen the manager?",
        "Will: No, he left a little while ago.",
        "Jade: Damn.",
        "Will: What's going on?",
        "Jade: I need to get a job, like, now.",
        "Will: Well, what about Crash?",
        "Jade: Casey fired me. And so I went back to the hotel, and the manager overheard me talking to the doctor.",
        "Will: Is the baby okay?",
        "Jade: No, no, the baby is fine. I was just calling to make an appointment, but he heard me and he kicked me out.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Jade: Because I made the mistake of being honest about getting fired, and so, that's it. He told me to leave.",
        "Will: Well, what about the money I gave you?",
        "Jade: I've been living off of it. Only now I don't have a job and I gotta hurry up and find a place to stay. Or else I'm going to be out on the street. Pregnant this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, I fired her.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Casey: She's just a headache, either way you look at it. And with school starting and the club gearing up. And plus, I've got to spend time with Maddie and not worry about Jade and all of her problems.",
        "Gwen: Okay. A week ago I would've tried to talk you out of it.",
        "Casey: You know, whatever, I fired her, not you. And I'm totally cool with it.",
        "Gwen: Is it okay then if I stay at Crash?",
        "Casey: No, you're going to stay at the dorms.",
        "Gwen: I can't afford it right now.",
        "Casey: You know, whatever, that doesn't mean you have to settle for a 12x7 with a view of a dumpster. You'll find a place. Now let's get inside -- it's freezing. Hey, we could go to Al's and get some coffee. There's a place on campus --",
        "Gwen: No, that's okay. I have to tell him something anyways. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Will: No, it's okay. Do you want to get some coffee or something?",
        "Gwen: No, I just think you should know that I'm going to be moving into the dorms with Casey. So any of the stuff that I left at the cottage you can just send over to Oakdale U.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: You just have to pack it up --",
        "Will: No, Gwen -- I think we should talk about this first.",
        "Gwen: Well, I need to get on with my life. And that means finding a place to stay. Since I'm going to school, the dorms make perfect sense.",
        "Will: No, this doesn't make any sense.",
        "Gwen: Well, this is how it is right now.",
        "Will: This was your idea, wasn't it?",
        "Casey: You know what? She said she was going to be crashing at the club, I thought the dorms sounded like a better idea.",
        "Will: Better for you, maybe. So you can move in on her --",
        "Casey: No, Will, will you grow up? No, Gwen and I are friends. That's it. She needed someone to help her out while she's sorting this stuff out.",
        "Will: Look, I'm her husband --",
        "Casey: Yeah and you know what? You did a really good job of that.",
        "Jade: She'll get over it.",
        "Will: No, she's moving on with her life.",
        "Jade: No, its just school. It's not like she's leaving town. Just give her some time. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. At least she has a place to stay.",
        "Will: You'll find something.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I know I will. As soon as I get a good job, I'm going to rent a room someplace. And I will get on it first thing tomorrow. But, since Gwen isn't coming back to the cottage -- could I come home with you?",

        "Dusty: I didn't mean to snap at you. Sorry. It's just that -- Johnny's under the weather.",
        "Lucy: You're nervous. It's perfectly understandable given Johnny's history. Which is why I think you should have him examined. And if you don't trust me to --",
        "Dusty: Of course I trust you. I just need to spend time with him.",
        "Lucy: And you don't want me to come with you?",
        "Dusty: I think we should call it a day. I'll call you.",
        "Lucy: This isn't about Johnny, is it? There's something else wrong. What happened? We were having such a nice time. And now you can't even look at me.",
        "Carly: Where have you been? The movers left already.",
        "Simon: Yeah, I'm sorry. I got kind of caught up. Ooh, love the table.",
        "Carly: You brought pizza and beer?",
        "Simon: Yeah, you know, I figured it was going to be a long night. Anyway, before we get started, I've been meaning to say this -- I want to thank you for sticking by me. And for all the time and talent you've put into this project. You know I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you're right. You couldn't.",
        "Simon: Yeah. You are, without a doubt, the most gifted, hard-working woman I know. And a result, these apartments -- they're going to sell like hotcakes.",
        "Carly: I hope so.",
        "Simon: Yeah, me, too. Because once they do, my designer promised me a very special bonus.",
        "Carly: Well, then I guess we gotta get back to work.",
        "Simon: You walked out on a good thing because it wasn't perfect. And now you've got to live with it. No walking back into her life to make yourself feel better. That's not fair, Jack, and you know it. If you really cared about her, you'd leave her alone.",
