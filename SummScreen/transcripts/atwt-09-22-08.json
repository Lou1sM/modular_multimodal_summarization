        "Chris gives Ethan a clean bill of health and a reason for Alison to go search him out again \u0096 supposedly to thank him for his help with Ethan. Paul finds Meg is missing. Barbara pleads with Mike to get Paul out of the collapsed hole, but he tells her that there is nothing more for them to do. Emma and Jack talk about his life now. Paul calls a shocked Barbara to tell her that he is ok, as an angered, Barbara relays that to Mike after she feels he was ready to pack it in. Barbara finds out from Paul that James took Meg, and she suggests he work with Jack because he resigned from the force. Paul calls Jack. Lily, Holden take Ethan home and have a small family celebration. Holden looks depressed when Mike shows up outside. Alison tells Aaron that she can't blow off work so she can go home to Ethan's party, but then she later blows off work to go to Chris' to see Morty supposedly. When Alison overdoes it trying to convince Chris about how happy she is, they share another kiss. Paul tells Jack what happened with James, Derek and Meg and he agrees to help. They go in search of Henry to find out about Derek. The Snyder party ends early, as it is suggested that Lily and Holden get some rest, as the kids head off with Emma. Holden assumes Lily is going to go be with Mike and even offers to look after the kids, but Lily doesn't want him to leave. Jack and Paul talk with Henry about Derek. Aaron talks about having kids. Jack and Paul go to Bonnie for help with Derek. She finally agrees to call him. Derek agrees to meet her at Metro where an enraged Paul and Jack are waiting. Derek doesn't give up any answer, as Jack and Paul play good cop, bad cop so to speak. Jack runs Derek downtown to see Dallas. Lily wants to take a shower and asks Holden if he would like to stick around to take one after so they can relax together. Emma talks to Aaron about waiting a little while before he and Alison try to have kids. Alison pulls away from Chris, who pleads with her to reconsider her marriage. Alison tells him that it is too late and heads home and right into Aaron's arms. She desperately comes onto Aaron, who is a little stunned by how she is acting. She tells him that she wants to have a baby with him \u0096 now. Aaron is unsure at first considering her quick turn around, but gives in when Alison tells him that she is sure now. Dallas questions Derek, as an impatient Paul waits. Bonnie arrives at the station and Derek wants to talk with her only. Paul pleads with her to talk with him. Derek wants her to represent him, but Bonnie tells him that he is crazy; she was his victim and will not represent him. When she tells Paul and Dallas, Paul again pleads with her to do as he asks because if he will talk about where Meg is, it would be to his lawyer. Holden is in Lily's room when she comes out of the shower. Holden thanks Lily for keeping his clothes for him. Chris heads into work when he can't get Allusion off of his mind. After Holden showers, he touches a sleeping Lily's hair. She awakens, takes his hand and asks him not to leave. He lies down beside her, tells her she is beautiful, which leads to a kiss. When Lily pulls back gently, Holden asks what is wrong. She tells him that she is so happy he is home, as they fall back on the bed and begin to make love."

        "[Ethan coughs]",
        "Chris: All right. Looks like your superhero's gotten all his powers back. He's been through a lot, but his lungs, his throat are clear. Physically, he's good as new. I'm gonna go get the discharge papers ready. Good job, Super Ethan! High five. All right.",
        "Holden: Anything special we need to do?",
        "Chris: Yeah, keep him away from holes in the ground.",

        "Jack: So, how is Ethan?",
        "Emma: Well, Holden called a while earlier. He was very scared when he went to the hospital, but he is bouncing right back. Pretty soon, he's gonna be running us ragged in no time.",
        "Jack: So, you're bringing this to the hospital?",

        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's great. Especially after the hell everyone's been through.",
        "Emma: Yeah, all because of that damned development project.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but that's been put on hold indefinitely, though, right?",
        "Emma: I am gonna make sure it's put on hold for good! Time things got back to normal around here. For everybody.",
        "Jack: Almost everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Chris: I better go get those discharge papers ready.",
        "Aaron: My dad and Lily must be wiped. I should go with them. You know, get Ethan settled and see how the girls are, especially Faith. I mean, this has been so hard on her.",
        "Alison: Well, she'll feel a lot better once she sees the little man is back in action.",
        "Aaron: Come with me.",
        "Alison: I have to finish my shift.",
        "Alison: You already strong-armed Bob to get all those days off for our honeymoon.",
        "Aaron: I wouldn't exactly call it strong-arming.",
        "Alison: Well, I'll come by later, okay? All right?",
        "Aaron: There's my man!",
        "Alison: Yeah! He looks good!",

        "Alison: You saved Ethan's life.",
        "Chris: Just doing my job. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be such a hero.",
        "Alison: You would have caught that obstruction within like two seconds.",
        "Chris: Okay, maybe we both deserve a medal. Can we just leave it at that, okay?",
        "Alison: Okay. You going home?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I have to go feed Morty before he chews up the rest of the carpet.",
        "Alison: Well, he doesn't like his chew toys?",
        "Chris: Not when he can do enough damage that'll cost me next month's salary. Ha, ha, ha. Go ahead and laugh. I'll send you the bill right after I get kicked out for having a dog.",
        "Alison: Poor little guy. He's probably just upset 'cause he's alone. I wish I could help.",
        "Chris: Well, you can come by for a visit, make his whole day.",
        "Alison: I don't know. I'd have to get someone to cover my shift.",

        "Barbara: You can't just walk away and leave him down there!",
        "Mike: Barbara, I know how hard this is for you.",
        "Barbara: That is my son!",
        "Mike: There is no way that anybody could have survived that.",
        "Barbara: You just rescued the Snyder boy! Someone's got to rescue him now!",
        "Mike: I know this has to be hard for you, and we'll call you if we find anything.",
        "Barbara: I'm not leaving here until you pull my son out of there!",

        "Barbara: Paul? Is it really you?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Barbara: Oh, God. They said that you wouldn't be able to survive anything. Tell me -- thank God you're okay!",
        "Paul: Mom, cut it out. Is Meg with you?",
        "Barbara: No, I took her home. Remember, you told me to take her home? How are you even getting a signal down there?",
        "Paul: I'll explain everything. Get to Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: No. I am not leaving until they pull you out of that hole!",
        "Paul: I am out! Mom, get here now!",
        "Mike: Hey, what happened? Was that Meg?",
        "Barbara: Paul's alive.",

        "Maid: Mr. Ryan, are you all right?",
        "Paul: Have you seen my wife?",
        "Maid: Last time I did, she was with your mother.",
        "Paul: Did anybody else come here after my mother left?",
        "Maid: I was upstairs cleaning, but I didn't hear anyone.",
        "Paul: You left her alone? You left Meg alone? She's pregnant! Why would you leave her alone?",
        "Maid: I'm sorry. Did something happen --",
        "Paul: Get out. Get out! Damn it, James! What did you do to my wife?",
        "Paul: Meg? Meg?",
        "Barbara: Oh God. Oh, thank God you're home. I thought I'd imagined that phone call. Are you okay? What happened? How did you find another way out? Why didn't you call us and let us know you were out?",
        "Paul: I was told not to call anyone.",
        "Barbara: By who?",
        "Paul: By Derek.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Paul: Mom, all of it -- the loan shark, the deadline, the rescue through some tunnel that nobody else heard about, it was all engineered by my lunatic father.",
        "Barbara: He let that little boy suffer for nothing?",
        "Paul: How else was he gonna get me out of the way long enough to make his move on Meg?",
        "Barbara: Oh, God.",
        "Paul: He has her. Mom, that son of a bitch has my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Well, her things are still here.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Emma: Janet's makeup, it's on the bathroom counter, so I assume that means she hasn't left yet. Although, it's quite clear that the two of you are having trouble.",
        "Jack: It is?",
        "Emma: Well, you didn't take her to work this morning, and you came by after she was gone. Is she one of the reasons that you're resigning from the force?",
        "Jack: Wow. Is there anything you don't know?",
        "Emma: It's hard not to keep up-to-date when you're living under the same roof as someone. My poor sweetheart. You look as if your life has been turned inside out.",
        "Jack: No. I should be used to that, though, right? Inside out's pretty much my status quo the last couple of years. But you know, I'm due for a change.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Emma: Oh. Hello?",
        "Holden: Your prayers were answered.",
        "Emma: He's home?",
        "Holden: And already asking for you.",
        "Emma: Oh! Tell him I'm on my way. Oh. Ethan is home!",
        "Jack: That's great. You called it.",
        "Emma: Why don't you come with me, okay?",
        "Jack: You know, I've got --",
        "Emma: Good to spend some time with the family.",
        "Jack: I have things to do. You give him a hug for me.",
        "Emma: Well, I'm sure that he'd much rather have a hug from you. Come on.",
        "Jack: Let me help you with the stuff.",
        "Emma: No, no, no, no. Listen, I can manage.",
        "Jack: All right, okay.",
        "Emma: You know, Jack, I remember, when you first moved out here after your divorce, you never thought you'd be able to adjust to being away from Carly and the kids and the house, but you did. You managed. 'Cause you have my strong heart. You're a strong, strong boy. You are my strong boy. And so I'm not worried about you because, whatever happens, I know that you can make the best of it. Listen to me, you always, always do. See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What does James possibly want with Meg?",
        "Paul: What do you think, Mom?",
        "Barbara: Have you called the police?",
        "Paul: The police? The police -- when have they ever been able to stop James?",
        "Barbara: Well, you can't go about this yourself. It could be another trap for you. I just heard that Jack Snyder resigned from the force. You've got to call him. Call him. He can help you with this. Yes, yes. He's a good detective. He's had experience with your father. The two of you will be way ahead of anyone else. You've got nothing to lose, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: He's such a good, sweet, brave boy. Yes, he is. You a brave boy?",
        "Lily: Emma, you didn't have to do all this.",
        "Aaron: I'm glad she did.",
        "Emma: You didn't have time to make all that food and do all those things. Think about that.",
        "Lily: Oh, my goodness. My mother! My mother and Luke. I didn't call them!",
        "Emma: No need to worry. No need to worry. I called her from the car. She said she'll be over as soon as possible.",
        "Lily: Thank you so much.",
        "Emma: You're so welcome so much.",
        "Lily: You're the best.",
        "Emma: So, now who's gonna help me put out all this food?",
        "Faith: I will!",
        "Emma: Good. Come on. Let's go. Let's go, Geronimo.",
        "Ethan: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: So, how are you holding up?",
        "Lily: I'm just afraid that this is a dream and I'm gonna wake up and he's still gonna be trapped down that hole.",
        "Holden: It's not a dream. I promise.",
        "Lily: Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Chris: You made it!",
        "Alison: It took me longer to get someone to cover my shift than I thought.",
        "Chris: But you still made it. Morty will be psyched.",
        "Alison: Oh, hi! Hey, come here!",
        "Chris: I told you.",
        "Alison: I missed you, Boy!",
        "Chris: Not as much as he missed you.",
        "Alison: Where you going there? Yeah, it's good that I came by today because, you know, I'm not gonna have that much free time now that I'm married. And any time I do have, I'm gonna be spending at home, obviously.",
        "Chris: You're gonna become a professional housewife now.",
        "Alison: Well, I didn't mean to make it sound like work. I mean, Aaron and I are great. We have a great time together. He actually just got, you know, our honeymoon -- a trip to Lake Michigan.",
        "Chris: He went all out, didn't he?",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was great. The trip was great. I mean, not just the trip, the marriage, in general.",
        "Chris: Alison, what are you doing? Why are you telling me all this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. Ethan's home, we're all together under one roof.",
        "Aaron: Except for Lily.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, we're still a family, otherwise, I wouldn't be here right now. But Lily and I decided to live separate lives. We both accepted that.",
        "Aaron: Well, it doesn't mean it doesn't bother you to see her with somebody else. You know, I felt that way with Alison. Maybe that's why I decided to get married so fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You didn't say anything to Emma about this, did you?",
        "Paul: No, of course not. I called Emma looking for Meg, but I didn't tell her that I thought James had her.",
        "Jack: Good, good. Let's keep it that way, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to any of the other family members about this. Not after everything they've been through.",
        "Barbara: I agree. So you think you can resolve this quickly enough that no one else will know?",
        "Jack: I'm damn well gonna try.",
        "Paul: Jack, what do we do?",
        "Jack: The loan shark that threatened you, Derek Coburn.",
        "Paul: Derek?",
        "Jack: He was on James' pay roll, yes?",
        "Paul: If anyone would know where Meg was, it would be Derek.",
        "Jack: Okay, and how did you usually get in touch with him? Did you -- cell phone, e-mail?",
        "Paul: No. He would just kind of show up and let me know that time was running out.",
        "Jack: But you had to make initial contact?",
        "Paul: No. That was Henry Coleman. Henry contacted him, and the next thing I know, Derek showed up with all the money I needed.",
        "Jack: All right, well, that's where we start. In order to find Derek, we have to find Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey. Hey, wait a minute. You're not telling me the only reason you married Alison was because you didn't want her to be with someone else.",
        "Aaron: No, no. No, no. I was kidding. There is no one else.",
        "Holden: 'Cause marriage is no guarantee that there won't be someone else. Neither is having kids. Lily and I are proof of that.",
        "Aaron: You know, Dad, it's, like, the last thing I want to hear after my honeymoon.",
        "Holden: You're absolutely right. Don't listen to me.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: And he wouldn't tell you how he got out?",
        "Mike: No. He didn't seem to feel like sharing that with anyone. But I wanted to let you know that he was out so you don't worry about the hole anymore, and that I boarded it up again, with extra barriers this time.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Mike: And I've also arranged for around-the-clock surveillance in case Paul or anyone else should decide to revisit the site.",
        "Lily: Trust me, I am not letting my little boy anywhere near that site ever again.",
        "Mike: He seems to be recovering very well.",
        "Lily: Yeah, like nothing ever happened.",
        "Mike: How about you?",
        "Lily: I'm still a little shaky. When I think about how close I came to almost losing him -- I should get back in there.",
        "Mike: Yeah. Well, I'll call you later?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Mike: And don't forget, I'm here if you need me.",
        "Faith: Please, please, please, can we go to Grandma's and help her make cookies?",
        "Holden: Faith, your brother just got home.",
        "Faith: So?",
        "Lily: What he needs more than cookies is a nap.",
        "Aaron: And if you ask me, looks like you and Dad need a nap.",
        "Emma: You know something? I think it'd be good for them to go. I mean, after all this craziness, it'll be something normal, and I think you two can get a little rest, okay? Please, Mama? Please, Daddy? Please?",
        "Aaron: All right, yeah!",
        "Emma: Yay! Whoo-hoo! Okay, wait for me! Wait for me! You're welcome. Wait up!",
        "Lily: When Aaron said I needed a nap, I must have scared him. Do I look that bad?",
        "Holden: No. You look beautiful. But I can understand not wanting to sleep. It's pretty hard to turn off the switch after this adrenaline rush we've had for the past couple of days. Anyway, I'll look out for the kids. I'll go pick them up and bring them home.",
        "Lily: I wasn't worried about that.",
        "Holden: No, what I'm saying is, if you want to go catch up with Mike, go ahead and do that. It's not a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Henry: Yes, come in, Liebchen. Let the healing process begin.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Henry: Don't tell me you're the new nurse.",
        "Jack: No, it's Jack Snyder, Henry.",
        "Jack: Oh, oh. Oh, great! A cop and a spawn of Stenbeck. Just what the doctor ordered.",
        "Paul: We need your help, Henry.",
        "Henry: No, I don't think so. No, the last time I helped you, I ended up in a wine-tasting marathon with daddy dearest.",
        "Paul: He kidnapped my wife.",
        "Henry: Really? I would thought, as a son, you're exempt from that.",
        "Paul: No. Not in this lifetime.",
        "Jack: You hooked Paul up with Derek Coburn?",
        "Henry: Great! First your dad tortures me, and then you throw me to the wolves!",
        "Jack: Anything you say is off the record, Henry.",
        "Henry: Says the detective.",
        "Jack: I'm not a detective anymore.",
        "Henry: You're not? What happened, Jack?",
        "Paul: Can we sort out Jack's little career crisis some other time, please?",
        "Jack: What did you know about Stenbeck's connection to Coburn?",
        "Henry: Nothing until I was a prisoner.",
        "Jack: Would you say they were close?",
        "Henry: Like a poisonous snake is close to its prey right before it strikes. Yeah.",
        "Jack: You think Coburn was working for him against his will?",
        "Henry: That's the feeling I got, but he was not a very forthcoming thug, okay? I asked why he was releasing me, and he said, \"If he told me, he'd have to kill me,\" so I didn't press it.",
        "Jack: Any idea where I can find him?",
        "Henry: Not a clue.",
        "Paul: You helped me find him the first time.",
        "Henry: That was through a friend of a friend. Actually, an acquaintance of an acquaintance.",
        "Jack: You got a number for me?",
        "Henry: No. But I think I know someone who does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Ethan's eating all the chocolate chips!",
        "Emma: You let Ethan do what he wants. You, on the other hand, you help Natalie pour the flour.",
        "Aaron: Pretty soon, you're gonna be ordering my kids around your kitchen.",
        "Emma: Well, not too soon, I hope.",
        "Faith: Is Alison pregnant?",
        "Aaron: Not yet.",
        "Emma: You know, there's a reason why they call this the honeymoon period. It's because the husband and wife get to know each other before children get into the mix.",

        "Chris: You can't leave yet. Don't you want to tell me how deliriously happy you are with your new husband?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to rub your nose in it.",
        "Chris: Didn't you?",
        "Alison: I guess I just wanted you to know that everything is working out.",
        "Chris: And I need to know that? Why, exactly?",
        "Alison: Because it seemed like you thought I was making a mistake marrying Aaron.",

        "Bonnie: Henry warned me about this guy, and by that time, it was too late.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but before that. When you and Derek did meet, did you ever go to his place?",
        "Bonnie: No. No, never. I asked him once or twice where he lived, and then he just changed the subject.",
        "Jack: Yeah, what about his phone number?",
        "Bonnie: No, no. He always called me.",
        "Jack: So, his number should be stored in your cell phone, yes?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, yeah. Here it is.",
        "Jack: How do you feel about calling him and asking him to meet you?",
        "Bonnie: Jack, the guy locked me in a warehouse and left me for dead with Vienna. I mean, I really didn't want to see this guy face to face!",

        "Jack: Derek -- Derek may be our only hope to finding Meg and James.",

        "Derek: Does this mean that you forgive me?",
        "Bonnie: No. I really wouldn't go that far.",
        "Derek: I told you I wouldn't let anything happen to you or your friends, and I meant it.",
        "Bonnie: I know, and you also said you didn't really have a choice.",

        "Vienna: I didn't even know they were friends.",
        "Henry: They're not friends, but it seems that Stenbeck didn't limit his kidnapping to just us chickens. I guess he made off with Paul's wife, as well.",
        "Vienna: Meg's been kidnapped?",
        "Henry: So it seems. Jack's trying to find her. He's not a cop anymore, but he hasn't lost his touch. In fact, he gave me quite a grilling over Derek Coburn.",

        "Aaron: Does anybody in this family remember seeing me say my vows?",
        "Emma: And with that commitment comes a lot of, lot of pressure. Trust me, now. It takes a long time to get to know somebody. You don't know them until you live with them for a while, and that's why it's a good idea to wait till you think about having children.",
