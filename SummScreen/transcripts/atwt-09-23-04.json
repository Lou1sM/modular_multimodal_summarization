        "[Will remembering]",
        "Barbara: Untie me, son.",
        "Will: I wouldn't untie you if the room was on fire.",
        "Barbara: Will --",
        "Will: Goodbye, Mother.",
        "Barbara: Don't leave me here!",
        "Will: Dad has to get me out of here.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Will: Paul. Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Grab your toothbrush, Will. You're going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Will is getting released today?",
        "Holden: Today, tomorrow -- what difference does it make?",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. I thought there was going to be a hearing.",
        "Holden: There was. Jessica represented Hal, Paul and Jennifer.",
        "Lily: I guess if the victim's own brother-in-law thinks its okay for her killer to walk the streets, then why not?",
        "Holden: There were a lot of other signatures on the affidavit, Lily. A lot of them were more important than mine.",
        "Lily: Who signed it? Excuse me, don't I have the right to know that?",
        "Holden: Bob, Kim, Lisa --",
        "Lily: What about Rose? Doesn't the that way she died mean anything to anybody?",
        "Holden: Depriving Will of his entire childhood is not going to bring Rose back.",
        "Lily: I cannot believe your attitude about this.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sorry. But it's done. Will is coming home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Well, I've got Will's room ready. Paul and Jennifer should have picked him up by now. So he should be here any minute.",
        "Emily: Murderer to model citizen in less than a year. That's got to be some kind of record, don't you think?",
        "Hal: My son is not a murderer! You know as well as I do that Will didn't mean for Rose to die. His mother goaded him into believing he had to save the family, so he did something that backfired in a way he never imagined.",
        "Emily: Barbara has to take a lot of the blame for that, I'll give you that. She damaged the boy, but -- my question to you is, doesn't it take a little longer than this to undo all that damage?",
        "Hal: You haven't talked to Will, Emily. I have. And for the first time, he sees how dangerous Barbara is and he wants nothing to do with her.",
        "Emily: Oh, okay. So that means he's cured?",
        "Hal: His doctors think he's made remarkable progress.",
        "Emily: Can I get that in writing?",
        "Hal: There are no guarantees, Emily! You know that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I do know that. I'm just wondering if you do.",
        "Hal: I'm doing what anybody in my position would do. I'm taking care of my son.",
        "Emily: And I'm doing the same. Which is why Daniel and I have to leave.",

        "Susan: Oh, come on, Emily! Pick up!",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "[Susan remembering]",
        "Susan: What happened that made Alison slap you like that?",
        "Aaron: Ask Emily.",
        "Susan: There she is. There's my girl.",
        "Alison: Morning, Mom.",
        "Susan: I made you a special wedding breakfast. French toast with fresh raspberries --",
        "Alison: No food. No food.",
        "Susan: Wedding day jitters, huh? Perfectly normal.",
        "Alison: Well, is it normal for the bride to hurl on her way down the aisle?",
        "Susan: Honey, you're not gonna hurl. I'm a doctor. I can fix that.",
        "Alison: Mom --",
        "Susan: You're gonna float down the aisle -- excited and beautiful -- in a dress that fits you like the petals on a rose. And you're gonna know in your head and in your heart that Chris Hughes is the luckiest man on the planet.",
        "Alison: Then why --",
        "Susan: Why? Why what? What is it, sweetie?",
        "Alison: No, no -- I promised myself I was not gonna think about that today.",
        "Susan: Is it Aaron? He said some really awful things to you yesterday. And I wouldn't blame you a bit if you were having a hard time forgetting it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Miracle of miracles! I'm actually gonna have a dress to wear today.",
        "Chris: The place in Chicago finally sent it?",
        "[Kim groans]",
        "Kim: \"Finally\" is the word. Do you think having a dress arrive on the day you're getting married is cutting it a little short?",
        "[Chris chuckles]",
        "Chris: See, I told you. Everything was gonna work out. You're gonna look great.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, we all know that every eye is going to be focused on the bride.",
        "Chris: Yeah, Ali's pretty psyched about her dress.",
        "Kim: Of course, the dress doesn't count. It's who is wearing it. And Ali is gonna be a glowing bride, I guarantee it. That girl has lots of sparkle. She could probably get married in a --",
        "Chris: Mom, would you stop it? Just stop, please. Stop pretending like you're happy about my wedding.",
        "Bob: Will somebody tell me what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I got a place. I got a justice of the peace. Now all I need is my bride. Where is my bride? There is my bride! Oh!",
        "Julia: Frank said we could get married at his place?",
        "Jack: Oh, they guy loves weddings. Who knew? He's been down the aisle five times himself. Come on! Go get dressed.",
        "Julia: Wait a minute!",
        "Jack: We're getting hitched today.",
        "Julia: What am I going to wear? I gotta call all my friends from work and Kayley and how am I gonna get all this done?",
        "Jack: Miracles have gotten us this far. One more and we're be husband and wife. That's it. J.J. -- just the man I wanted to see. I gotta ask you a question.",
        "J.J.: What is it?",
        "Jack: If it's okay with you -- I'd like to marry your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Carly, do you want something to eat or drink? Carly? Honey, can you hear me?",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah. I am sorry. I'm just trying to think of a way to find the little boy this cap belongs to. I'm sure it was the same kid who was with that woman at the water park and that they know where Jack is.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe.",
        "Carly: Why else would we have found this hat right at the same place that Jack made the call?",
        "Rosanna: If it was Jack that called.",
        "Carly: No! No, it was Jack!",
        "Rosanna: Honey, you had just gone on TV begging for help in finding your husband. People aren't always that kind.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, I recognized his voice. The employee at the water park recognized his photograph. Jack is alive. And the last time he was seen, he was with J.J. and his mother. If I find out where they live, I find Jack.",
        "Rosanna: But you don't even know their last names.",
        "Carly: But I do know what they look like.",
        "Rosanna: Who are you calling?",
        "Carly: The one person who can help me bring Jack home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't care what Aaron says. He was just jealous, so he made up a lie. I mean, Chris would never cheat on me. I know that. You've known him forever. Would he ever do something like that?",
        "Susan: Honey, let's not waste our time talking about hypothetical situations. We have a very, very sacred ritual to perform.",
        "Alison: We do?",
        "Susan: We do. We have to make sure you have something borrowed and something blue.",
        "Alison: That is so cheesy.",
        "Susan: You don't want to do it?",
        "Alison: No, of course I do! Can you call Emily? Do you think she's too busy getting ready?",
        "Susan: Emily is your sister. Today of all days, she's going to put you first. Or she's going to answer to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Is this really about Daniel? Or is it about getting back at me because I didn't run this by you? Because I would have, you know, if I'd been given a little bit more lead time. But things just happened so fast.",
        "Emily: Oh, right. So fast. No time. No time to consult me, to hold me, to share a meal with me, just to talk to me!",
        "Hal: All right, Emily. What else is going on?",
        "Emily: Isn't Will's release enough?",
        "Hal: No. You've been tense for weeks.",
        "Emily: I love Will. Okay? I want to help him. I want to be there for him. It's just --",
        "Hal: What? Tell me.",
        "Emily: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Hal: Then work with me. Don't take Daniel and leave. Can you imagine how will Will feel if he comes back here and he finds out the two of you have moved out? Now, I am asking you as your husband and your partner -- work with me on this, please, Emily?",
        "Emily: Everything we have right now, it just seems so fragile and so -- [Phone rings] I'm sorry. That's my mom. Hello?",
        "Susan: Emily, Alison and I want you to come over so we can do the \"something borrowed, something blue,\" ceremony.",
        "Emily: Mom, I'd love to, but I can't.",
        "Susan: Emily -- you get over here in five minutes or I will march over there and drag you out by your heels. Emily's on her way.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Emily: Wedding crisis. I have to go over there. I'm sorry.",
        "Hal: But Will is going to be here any minute.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I can't, okay? I'm sorry. I just have to do this.",
        "Hal: Are you coming back?",
        "Emily: What about a compromise?",
        "Hal: Like what?",
        "Emily: I don't know -- maybe Daniel and I stay at my mom's for a week and let Will settle in. And -- we'll see what happens then.",
        "Hal: I guess I can live with that.",
        "Emily: Can you?",
        "Hal: I guess. Thank you.",
        "Emily: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Mom, I'm sorry, okay? But I'm just a little wound up today. I didn't mean to tear your head off.",
        "Kim: Well, you know, I really did mean what I said. I mean, Ali's going to be a beautiful bride. And your father and I are looking forward to welcoming her into the family.",
        "Chris: I know that she's not the ideal bride that you would have picked out for me. But I -- I appreciate you supporting it, anyway.",
        "Kim: I -- I have such a bad feeling about this.",
        "Bob: Well, he's not the first person in wedding history to get last-minute jitters.",
        "Kim: I know. I know, but I -- I'm really serious about it. Yesterday, at the rehearsal, Ali seemed so -- I don't know. Like she was trying so hard. Maybe too hard. I just wonder if she's starting to see what I've been seeing and that's -- Chris is unhappy about something.",
        "Bob: Any suggestions?",
        "Kim: I don't know. Maybe you ought to have a heart-to-heart with him, make sure that he really wants to get married. Otherwise, those two kids are going to end up with so much heartache.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know, most people in this town are okay with will being released.",
        "Lily: Emily's not. She doesn't want someone with Will's problems living under the same roof as Daniel. I've got to talk to her.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Lily: Because the judge only agreed to release Will if he lived with Hal. And if Emily refuses, then maybe we can get him locked up again!",
        "Holden: Lily, would you please just listen to yourself? It's like you're bound and determined to destroy this kid's life.",
        "Lily: How can you stick up for him?",
        "Holden: The same way I stuck up for you after Rose died. You went off the deep end. I was there for you. And I'm glad that I was.",
        "Lily: That was different. I didn't hurt anybody.",
        "Holden: Yes, you did. But I forgave you. Luke and Faith, they both forgave you. Now it's your turn to forgive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Can I just tell you how much I am not gonna miss this place?",
        "Jennifer: Good. Because you are never coming back here.",
        "Paul: Where you're going, Will, Mother won't be able to get to you. Ever.",
        "Will: Promise?",
        "Jennifer: Hey. She's been sedated, Will. And she's locked in isolation.",
        "Will: Let's go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: You want to marry my mom?",
        "Jack: Yeah, J.J. J.J., I love her. Ever since I woke up in the hospital bed and she was looking down at me, I felt like it was meant to be.",
        "J.J.: You mean like fate?",
        "Jack: Like fate. Smart kid. Yeah, like some higher power was making sure that the three of us were a family.",
        "J.J.: When you say you want to marry my mom -- do you mean forever?",
        "Jack: With your permission. Yeah.",
        "Julia: I think we just got our last miracle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna, this is Evelyn Lynch. She's the forensic artist down at the police station. Evelyn, this is my sister, Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Nice to meet you.",
        "Evelyn: I'm so glad I could do something for Jack's family. He was a great guy.",
        "Carly: He is a great guy.",
        "Evelyn: Everyone down at the station is hoping you're right.",
        "Carly: I am. And with your help, I'll be able to find him. Sit down, please.",
        "Evelyn: Now, you say you're looking for two people you met at a park -- a mother and her son?",
        "Carly: Yep, that's right.",
        "Evelyn: And those are the people you think Jack is with now?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: If --",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Evelyn: All right. Sit down, please. Close your eyes. Picture yourself arriving at the park. You're parking the car, you're getting out, you're at the entrance, you're buying tickets --",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Evelyn: Now, try to focus in on those two people. Let's start with the boy's mother. Tell me what you see.",
        "[Carly remembering]",
        "Carly: Hi. Excuse me. This is an odd favor, but I'm wondering if you could watch my little boy for me just so I can change my baby's diaper, it that's okay.",
        "Julia: Great. I wouldn't mind at all. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Really. Good. Thanks. You're a life saver.",
        "Carly: I see her.",

        "[Upbeat music]",
        "Jennifer: Well, does is it look just like you remember it?",
        "Will: Kind of. Hey, did Daniel and Parker do those?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. They sure did. They missed you so much.",
        "Will: Me, too.",
        "Jennifer: What else did you miss?",
        "Will: Dad's pancake dinners -- shooting hoops in the driveway -- family movie night. Sure beats listening to weird screams from down the hall.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, honey --",
        "Will: I'm okay.",
        "Hal: Will. I didn't hear the door. Hey, hey, my boy is home! He's home, where he belongs! Oh, you don't know how long I've prayed for this day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What is it?",
        "Emily: And now, for Miss Alison Stewart -- something borrowed and something blue.",
        "Alison: Oh, Em --",
        "Emily: I wore it when I married Hal.",
        "Alison: You are the best, the absolute best.",
        "Emily: Oh, sweetie. Thank you.",
        "Alison: I have something for you.",
        "Emily: Oh? Ali, you didn't have to get me anything.",
        "Alison: But after everything you've done for me? If it weren't for you, I'm not so sure that Chris and I would have made it. Open it! Do you like it?",
        "Emily: Alison, it's beautiful. You didn't have to do this, sweetie.",
        "Alison: But I wanted to get you something special to thank you for being my matron of honor.",
        "Susan: You must have been saving up for months.",
        "Alison: But you deserve it. Guys, I have something that I wanted to tell you. For a lot of my life, I wished that I had a Dad who was like a lot of other dads, but I know now that it was a waste of time. You know why?",
        "Susan: Why?",
        "Alison: Because I have so much more than most people. The three of us -- we're not like other families, we're special. >From the way I came into this world. My two moms. I love you guys so much.",
        "Susan: That's how we love you, baby -- so much. Now, get out of here or I'm going to start crying and then I'll have bulgy eyes in all the pictures.",
        "Alison: I'm going. I'm going.",
        "Susan: Where? Alison, you can't be late for your wedding.",
        "Alison: I won't. I'm just going to take one last walk as a single woman.",
        "Susan: Walk fast. You want to know why I was afraid of bursting into tears?",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Susan: A well-meaning friend told Alison that Chris is in love with another woman. Would you happen to know anything about that, would you? No? How could you? How could you do that to your own sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Frank!",
        "Frank: Hey!",
        "Jack: I'd like you to meet my best man, J.J. J.J., This is Frank. He's my boss.",
        "Frank: Hey, how are you, little guy? Where's your mom? She didn't back out, did she?",
        "Jack: No, don't you worry. Nothing's going to go wrong. Your mom went to go pick up Kayley. We talked about this -- she'll be here soon.",
        "Frank: All right.",
        "J.J.: There she is.",
        "Jack: Yes, there she is. Wow.",
        "J.J.: You look nice, Mom.",
        "Julia: Everybody's here?",
        "Jack: Even the justice of the peace. We can start any time. Do you have any idea how proud I am to be the guy you're going to marry?",
        "Julia: Don't -- don't. If you make me ruin my makeup, I will kill you.",
        "Jack: All right. No tears, then, promise.",
        "Justice of the peace: Shall we begin?",
        "Julia: Shall we?",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah.",
        "Justice of the peace: We're gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest occasions -- the union between --",
        "Les: If you think this little game of charades is going to keep me from getting my boy, you don't know who you're messing with.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns --\"",
        "Jack: To tell you the truth, you're a bit of a buzz kill. This is our day. So, I think I speak on behalf of all of us when I say get the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Please, don't ruin this day for me. This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Les: I'm J.J.'s father. You decide to hook up with this -- punk, who thinks he's can take my job? Forget it!",
        "Frank: Hey, I'm going to call the cops, here.",
        "Jack: No, no. I'll handle this.",
        "J.J.: You're not supposed to be here! Leave us alone!",
        "Les: You think he's going to be your daddy? I'm your father.",
        "J.J.: No, you're not. Jack is.",
        "Jack: This is my family now, Les. You come anywhere near my wife or J.J., I'll rip you --",
        "Les: He's mine. You think I'm going to walk away from my flesh and blood?",
        "Jack: No, you had your chance. You blew it. To tell you the truth, you're a bit of a buzz kill. This is our day. So I think I speak on behalf of all of us when I say get the hell out of here. [Applause] You okay?",
        "Julia: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",

        "Evelyn: Did we nail it?",
        "Carly: Well, that's definitely the mother, but something about J.J. isn't quite right.",
        "Evelyn: Was anyone else with you at the water park? Anyone who might remember what he looks like?",
        "Carly: Yes. Parker, sweetheart, would you come down here, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: So, Alison and Chris are getting married today and I have to be there, but I'd love to take you if you want to come with me.",

        "Hal: What? Too many people for you?",
        "Jennifer: Dad, Will just got home.",
        "Hal: All right, then I'll stay here with you.",
        "Will: No way.",
        "Hal: Oh, Emily will understand.",
        "Will: No, just tell me one thing -- if I wasn't here, and everything was normal, would you even consider missing the wedding?",
        "Hal: Well, if I had an air tight excuse -- I mean, these are special circumstances --",
        "Will: I don't want anybody changing anything for me, Dad. I just want things to be normal. Please.",

        "Susan: Chris Hughes again?",
        "Emily: It was nothing.",
        "Susan: Define \"nothing.\"",
        "Emily: Nothing. I was just a -- a mild flirtation between two people. Kissing, a little kissing. That was it. It was stupid stuff. Stuff that I wish I could just forget ever happened. The guilt is killing me, believe me.",
        "Susan: Well, don't expect me to feel sorry for you. Not when your sister is out there somewhere, trying to prepare herself, emotionally, for the biggest day of her life -- not knowing that the matron of honor and the groom have been making out behind her back.",
        "Emily: Okay, all right, all right. You cannot possibly make me feel any worse than what I already do.",
        "Susan: Let me ask you something -- mother to mother. I have a daughter is about to marry a man who, for all intents and purposes, has already cheated on her. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't stop this wedding and tell her the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You up for some company? So, how you feeling?",
        "Chris: Like I'm ten again. Starring in that school play. The rehearsals were great, but then, all of a sudden, there was an audience and I choked.",
        "Bob: Well, forget about the audience. You know the reason that grooms all basically dress alike is because everybody's looking at the bride. All you have to do is make sure, in your heart, that you really want to get married.",
        "Chris: You didn't tell Mom, did you?",
        "Bob: That there was someone else? Well, of course not. You told me that in confidence.",
        "Chris: Then why did she say I looked miserable?",
        "Bob: I guess maybe, because -- you do.",

        "Alison: Okay, maybe I'm supposed to save this for church, but I think that I would rather say it to you here. Do you remember all those times that I wanted a lot of money and a big house so that I could make all those other girls jealous? Well, I don't care about any of that anymore. 'Cause I just -- I want to make Chris proud. I just want to make sure that I'm ready for marriage. I love him so much, and I know that he loves me too, I do. So, please, please, just let us be happy forever. Amen. [Snapping] Who -- hey! Who's there? I know -- I heard someone. Who is that?",
        "Aaron: Hey, Ali.",
        "Alison: Were you spying on me?",
        "Aaron: No. I just got here. And just I saw you, and now I'm leaving.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about it. I'm leaving.",
        "Aaron: No, Ali -- please wait.",
        "Alison: Don't you think that you've said enough ugly things to me?",
        "Aaron: Ali, I didn't do it to hurt you.",

        "Aaron: I do love you.",
        "Alison: Okay, then why would you say such a horrible lie about Chris? That was the meanest thing that anybody has ever done to me. You're supposed to be my friend.",
        "Aaron: I -- we are friends, Ali. That's how come I --",
        "Alison: Then go on and say it.",
        "Aaron: I just don't want you to stop dreaming.",
        "Alison: I don't have to dream anymore because I'm getting the real deal. I'm getting married to Chris Hughes.",

        "Bob: Listen, I just hope that you're not going through with this just to go through with it.",
        "Chris: It's just that thing that I told you about.",
        "Bob: I think it was a \"flirtation,\" as you described it.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well -- anyway, it's over. I came out of it really committed to making this marriage work, okay? I am behind Alison 100%.",
        "Bob: Well, if you don't have any doubts, neither do I.",
        "Chris: I wouldn't blame you if you did. Seems like everything I've ever done I've screwed up sooner or later.",
        "Bob: Look, we all make mistakes. The past few years, you've managed to fix yours. You're grown up. Your mother and I have complete faith that you will do the right thing. You'd better get dressed. Do you need help?",
        "Chris: With what?",
        "Bob: Your tie.",

        "Emily: It wasn't like that. It wasn't like that! Chris loves her, he adores her. And he realized, we both realized that we were very close to ruining that relationship.",

        "Will: No, I'll do it. We have stuff for sandwiches, right?",
        "Paul: I guess. And then afterwards, I'm not kidding -- you and me, on that basketball court, I own you.",
