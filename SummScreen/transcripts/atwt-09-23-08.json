        "Holden and Lily say tell Mike and Carly that they have decided to give their marriage another try and Carly is happy for them. Mike is sad and tries to hold back tears when Lily tells him the news but he wishes Lily the best of luck with her marriage. Emma decides to shut down the development project because she blames herself for Ethan's accident. Mike tells Lily since the project is shut down he will probably leave Oakdale. Janet gets angry at Jack because he didn't tell her himself that he was going out of town on a private case instead he sent Carly to tell her the news. The incident makes Janet realize that Carly will always come first with Jack so she tells him that he should stop lying to himself and get back together with Carly. Janet also tells Carly not to lose Jack and try to have a relationship with him again. Emma decides to donate the land to the city and make it a wildlife preserve or a park for children. Lucinda's friend Brian suggests that they have a benefit to raise money for the project. Derek tells Jack and Paul that James has a beach house somewhere on the east coast and that is probably where he took Meg. Paul thinks Jack's way of finding Meg is too slow so he goes out to search for Meg on his own. James does indeed take Meg to a very secluded beach house and says that it will be her new home."

        "Alison: Wish you didn't have to work. We could, uh, still be in bed, and I could --",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Aaron: Whoa! Later! Later.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God! Get a room!",
        "Alison: Hey, Guys.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Casey: How is it going? Enjoying the honeymoon, obviously.",
        "Aaron: It shows?",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Emily: Why don't you guys join us for lunch?",
        "Aaron: Well, I have to work. I mean, Ali, if you want to stay, it's --",
        "Alison: Yeah. Actually, I have the whole day off, so --",
        "Emily: Oh, good! Stay, please! And we promise not to pay attention when you two blow kisses at each other across the room.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Don't work too hard.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Have fun.",
        "Emily: Oh, Ali, you guys seem ecstatic.",
        "Casey: Why wouldn't they? Being married is great.",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's -- it's really amazing. And, uh, just between us, but, uh, we decided to kick it up a notch. We started trying.",
        "Casey: Trying?",
        "Alison: To get pregnant. We want to have a baby.",
        "Casey: Fantastic!",
        "Emily: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Casey: No! That's a great idea, isn't it?",
        "Emily: Casey -- oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Didn't I tell you that the boys are at soccer, Sage is at dance?",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. I'm not here about the kids. Can I come in?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Is everything okay?",
        "Jack: Um, yeah. It's fine. Listen. I just wanted you to know that I'm working on a case.",
        "Carly: Oh, you got your job back. That's great news.",
        "Jack: Not with the department. It's a private matter. Anyway, it's gonna take me out of town. So I was wondering, maybe the kids could stay with you full- time while I'm gone?",
        "Carly: Yes, of course.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Carly: What's the case?",
        "Jack: I can't talk about it.",
        "Carly: Jack -- is it dangerous?",
        "Jack: Carly, I'll fill you in on the details later.",
        "Carly: Jack, if the father of my children is in danger, I think I have a right to know.",
        "Jack: All right, fine. Fine, I'll tell you. But it goes no further, Carly. You hear me? I want you to swear to me.",
        "Carly: Yes, I swear. What is it?",
        "Jack: James Stenbeck is back, and he kidnapped Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Please. You -- you have to tell Derek that you will take his case.",
        "Bonnie: Even if I agreed, there is a conflict of interest. Derek Coburn kidnapped me. So representing someone who I know committed a felony involving me is not only bizarre, it is unethical. I would be disbarred.",
        "Paul: So what? You said you didn't want to practice law anymore anyway.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. So even if I agreed to commit professional suicide, there is still the confidentiality issue. I -- I'd be bound by law not to tell you anything that Derek says.",
        "Paul: Come on. So what? If he does tell you something that leads us to Meg, isn't it worth it? Bonnie, please. There are two lives at stake here.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. I'll -- I'll do it. I'll help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Come on, now. You've been working and cooking nonstop.",
        "Janet: Oh!",
        "Emma: Take a day off.",
        "Janet: Emma, feeding people makes me feel useful.",
        "[Emma laughs]",
        "Janet: And besides, it's the least I could do to thank you for letting me stay here.",
        "Emma: You're welcome. And I have stolen a few of your recipes.",
        "Janet: Oh, good! Right back at you.",
        "Emma: And -- I know that you, uh -- you want to be close to Jack.",
        "Janet: I don't think that's in the cards right now.",
        "Emma: Oh, now, just hold on. Give him time. Let him work out a few things for himself. You know, I have -- I have a very strong feeling that he may come around.",
        "Janet: Oh, gosh, I hope so. You know what I always tell Liberty? \"Hoping for the best may not always guarantee you'll get what you want, but it's a lot better than expecting the worst, right?\"",
        "Emma: It sure is.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Mike: Hey, Emma.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Janet: No problem.",
        "Emma: You're not interrupting anything. We just had lunch. Would you like a sandwich?",
        "Mike: Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. You know, I was just down at the construction site. I was making sure that they'll be no more accidents.",
        "Emma: Heaven forbid.",
        "Mike: Look, I -- I think we need to reassess our options for development.",
        "Emma: No, Mike. Uh, we don't have to reassess anything. As of now, I'm shutting down the project for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Feels so good to wake up together.",
        "Holden: Sure does.",
        "Lily: Did you ever think this would happen again?",
        "[Holden laughs]",
        "Holden: I don't think I want to ask too many questions right now.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Lily: Fair enough.",
        "Holden: We still have a lot of things that we need to work out.",
        "Lily: Yeah. But I'm just so grateful that something positive came out of what happened to Ethan.",
        "Holden: When you come face-to-face with the prospect of losing a child, it gives you instant perspective.",
        "Lily: We needed some of that.",
        "Holden: We did. When I thought we were gonna lose Ethan, it made me realize there are only a few things that matter in this world -- my children and you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: They're bringing up Coburn from lockup now.",
        "Paul: Let's hope this works.",
        "Bonnie: It's a long shot, but if it helps to find Meg, it's worth it.",
        "Cop: He's all yours.",
        "Derek: You came back.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. I thought it over, and I decided to take your case after all.",
        "Derek: Hmm. Well, I changed my mind. I don't want you to represent me after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Poor Meg. Paul must be a wreck.",
        "Jack: Putting it mildly.",
        "Carly: How are Emma and Holden?",
        "Jack: I haven't told the rest of the family yet, Carly.",
        "Carly: Don't you think they should know?",
        "Jack: Listen, they just went through this nightmare with Ethan, right? Now, I'd -- I'd love to spare them going through another one so soon.",
        "Carly: Okay, but I don't think they're gonna be very happy when they find out that you kept something like this from them.",
        "Jack: I'm willing to take that risk. Let me tell them something happy later on.",
        "Carly: All right. Well, I won't say anything.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: How do you plan on getting Meg back?",
        "Jack: Oh, don't worry. I know what I'm doing. We already have one of Steinbeck's flunkies in jail. And if we can get him to turn on his boss, maybe we'll all be able to get out of this without anybody getting hurt.",
        "Carly: Well, I know that I can't talk you out of it, Jack. Please, promise me that you'll be careful.",
        "Jack: I will. You know I will. There's one more favor I need to ask you.",
        "Carly: Anything.",
        "Jack: Talk to Janet for me. Tell her -- tell her I've got some important business that I'm working on and I'm gonna be out of town for a while. Okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, no, Jack. No way. I'm not getting in the middle of your relationship with Janet.",
        "Jack: It's not a relationship, Carly. We're barely seeing each other.",
        "Carly: Then tell her yourself.",
        "Jack: If I tell her, she's gonna ask me questions that I can't answer.",
        "Carly: You are really a piece of work. You know that? You have the guts to go after someone like James Stenbeck, but you don't have the guts to sit down and talk to the woman you've been -- been sharing a bed with for how long now?",
        "Jack: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, listen. I've got to concentrate on Meg. If I tell Janet what I'm doing, she's not gonna be able to keep the secret. I don't want to put her in that position.",
        "Carly: Well, you're right about that. She doesn't seem like the type to be able to keep a secret.",
        "Jack: So will you do me this favor?",
        "Carly: You're gonna owe me, big-time. You know that, don't you?",
        "Jack: Yes. And I'll make it up to you. I promise. Mwah! Kiss the kids for me.",
        "Carly: Okay. And Jack, take care of yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: It won't be easy, but we can still clean up the soil.",
        "Emma: Yes. We have to do that. We have to do that. We have to -- we have to protect the land.",
        "Mike: But you don't want the houses built anymore?",
        "Emma: That's right.",
        "Mike: Do you realize the money that you stand to lose?",
        "Emma: Look, I realize that this might not sound like a rational decision, but, uh, I really -- I have to listen to what's in my heart right now, and I just cannot shake the idea that this whole project was doomed from the beginning. I -- I really should not have sold this precious, precious land for a profit.",
        "Mike: Don't make this decision when you're emotional. You should talk to your family about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: The rest of the family thinks we're asleep. What would they say if they knew how we were passing the time?",
        "[Holden laughs]",
        "Holden: I won't tell if you won't.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: It's my mother.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Lily: Does she have ESP?",
        "Holden: Mama, hi.",
        "Emma: Hi. Holden, listen. Sweetheart, are you and Lily busy right now?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, sort of. Um, what's up?",
        "Emma: Well, Mike is here, and we have to make some decisions about the development. And I, uh -- I just need your help, your input.",
        "Holden: Well, we have to pick up the kids anyway, so we'll be right over. Bye- bye.",
        "Lily: Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah. She, uh -- she wants us all over there. It sounds like a meeting about the construction project. Sorry to break this up.",
        "Lily: It's okay. I have a feeling we're just getting started.",
        "Holden: I have that feeling, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Uh, a turkey sandwich to go.",
        "Casey: If two people love each other, why shouldn't they have a baby right away?",
        "Emily: Alison and Aaron should enjoy their honeymoon first and put off the responsibilities of having a family for just a little while.",
        "Casey: You make \"Responsibility\" sound like a dirty word.",
        "Emily: No. Look, I love kids. Kids are wonderful. I -- I have one. But they tend to tie you down a little. That's all. Alison, you really think you're up for this? Ali. Hello, Alison.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Having a baby is a beautiful thing.",
        "Casey: Exactly.",
        "Alison: I can't wait.",
        "Emily: Oh, why do I even bother, really?",
        "Alison: You know, I should get going.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Alison: I got way behind, you know, in classes when we went on our honeymoon, and I have a lot of reading to catch up on.",
        "Emily: Honey, you didn't finish -- you didn't touch your salad.",
        "Alison: I'm not really hungry, okay?",
        "Chris: Hey, Alison. How's it going?",
        "Alison: Uh, everything's great. Thanks.",
        "Aaron: You're all set.",
        "Chris: Thanks.",
        "Alison: Uh, I'm gonna take off. Will you miss me?",
        "Aaron: Oh, you know, I will.",
        "Alison: And, uh, let's work on that baby project later. Love you.",
        "Aaron: Love you, too.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: I'll be right outside.",
        "Bonnie: So why the 180?",
        "Derek: Come on, Bonnie. Let's be honest here. You're playing me.",
        "Bonnie: Playing you?",
        "Derek: Nice. Very nice. You look me dead in the eye and lie. That's a good quality in a lawyer.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I'm not lying.",
        "Derek: Hmm. Lawyer, loan shark -- we both scam people for a living.",
        "Bonnie: Well, if that's how you feel, this is a huge mistake.",
        "Derek: No, no, no, no. Not so fast, beautiful. Stick around.",
        "Bonnie: What the hell for?",
        "Derek: Maybe I want you to tell me, uh, how you're the best lawyer I can get.",
        "Bonnie: Who's playing now?",
        "Derek: Not me. Pull up a chair. Make yourself comfortable. I've changed my mind. I've decided to hire you after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Paul: Where have you been?",
        "Jack: Taking care of some personal business. Has Coburn flipped yet?",
        "Paul: Bonnie's got him in there, but she's not gonna get anything out of him.",
        "Jack: Give her some time.",
        "Paul: Time? My father's probably dragged Meg halfway to Thailand by now. Time's something we don't have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Come in.",
        "Carly: Hello. Hi.",
        "Emma: Hey.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry to interrupt. Uh, Janet -- could I speak with you privately, please?",
        "Janet: Uh, sure. Of course. I'll be right back.",
        "Emma: Okay.",
        "Janet: Um, what's up?",
        "Carly: I have a message from Jack. He got some freelance work, some P.I. stuff. He, uh, just wanted me to let you know that he might be out of town for a few days.",
        "Janet: And he couldn't tell me this himself?",
        "Carly: Well, he had to leave sort of suddenly, so I don't think he had time.",
        "Janet: Oh, but he had time to tell you.",
        "Carly: We have children, you know. He -- he had to tell me.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on, Carly. That's baloney.",
        "Carly: Don't shoot the messenger.",
        "Janet: No! I'm not mad at you, okay? I'm mad at Jack, and I'm not gonna let him get away with this.",
        "Emma: Everything all right out there?",
        "Carly: Hi. Yes.",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "Carly: Yeah. It's all good. I'll see you later.",
        "Emma: Bye.",
        "Carly: I -- I was just leaving. Take care.",
        "Holden: You know, I really should just, uh, go talk to her. You don't mind, do you?",
        "Lily: Go. Go ahead.",
        "Holden: Carly, don't go. Not yet.",
        "Janet: Well, look who's still here. Aren't I lucky to grab you away from some very important business that has you so very, very busy that you couldn't pick up a phone?",
        "Jack: Janet, I need you to understand something, okay?",
        "Janet: No, I need you to understand something, okay? You owe me some respect, Jack -- some respect and common courtesy.",
        "Jack: You're right. I do. I won't be long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Great. Anything else gonna go wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What's your problem?",
        "Casey: It's no wonder Alison lost her appetite. You made her feel like an idiot because she wanted to have a baby?",
        "Emily: I was being realistic. What? My sister has struggled these last few years, okay? She is very impulsive, and she never, ever thinks anything through.",
        "Casey: Yeah. And so maybe she's trying to grow up. She's going to nursing school. She's married. The next logical thing is to have a baby.",
        "Emily: No. I don't think she's fully ready for that. She's so young! She should enjoy her freedom, enjoy her life.",
        "Casey: Oh, so this is about me and not Alison.",
        "Emily: No, it's not about you. Look, all I'm saying is bringing a child into the world -- it's not easy.",
        "Casey: Maybe not. But getting there -- that's a different story, isn't it?",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Will you stop? Would you stop? There's a big difference between sex and procreation.",
        "Casey: Yeah. So let's get out of here, and I'll give you an, uh, hands-on demonstration, huh?",
        "Emily: Oh. I'm sure you will.",
        "Casey: Come on.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Chris: Getting ready for rounds. Why?",
        "Alison: Don't play dumb.",
        "Chris: You mean showing up at the Lakeview? I had to get lunch.",
        "Alison: And that is the only place in town that serves food? You're stalking me, Chris, and it needs to stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: What I want is simple -- complete immunity in exchange for my full cooperation.",
        "Bonnie: So you think I can get you a \"Get out of jail free\" card? It's not gonna happen. No way.",
        "Derek: Eh, eh, eh, eh. You'll never know unless you try. Who knows? You might surprise us both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey, I thought I would have heard from you by now. Any news on Meg?",
        "Paul: No. Why's he doing this, Mom? Is it some kind of a test? I mean, he sent me on a wild-goose chase to find some gold that wasn't there. Is this some kind of a test, like I'm supposed to go find my pregnant wife?",
        "Barbara: Honey, I -- I don't want to upset you any more, but I do believe your father is through testing you. In fact, I think he intends not to bring Meg back at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Thank you. Look, I know you're working on something really big. But to send your ex-wife to clue me in -- are you trying to let me down easy?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm sorry if it seemed insensitive. I -- I didn't mean to hurt you, Janet.",
        "Janet: Either you're lying to me or you're lying to yourself. Because the truth is, Carly is still your home base, your port in a storm, so to speak. And she always will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Now, I know -- I know this puts Mike out of a job. And Mike, I'm really sorry about that. But the idea of putting houses -- building houses on this land -- I mean, after what happened to Ethan, I just -- I couldn't do it.",
        "Lily: Listen, I -- I know it was hell. But Ethan is fine. And Emma, you've got to think about yourself. I mean, you -- you have to make sure that you have enough money to live on, not just today, but for the future.",
        "Emma: Well, I can't do that by selling this land that's been in my family for years. It was -- the arrangement was terrible to begin with. It was wrong.",
        "Lily: Nobody blames you for this, Emma.",
        "Emma: I blame myself. Excuse me.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry she's so upset.",
        "Lily: Mike, if she shuts down the project, what will you do?",
        "Mike: I don't know. You know, those houses were the reason I came back to Oakdale. I guess I'd have to move on -- unless you give me a reason to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I just figured that you'd rather hear it from me than get the news third hand.",
        "Carly: Its okay, Holden. I can see for myself that you and Lily are on your way back to something. And that's good. If you're happy, then I'm happy.",
        "Holden: Our problems -- they just seem so insignificant after almost losing Ethan.",
        "Carly: Right. Yes. A, uh -- a crisis definitely brings people closer. The question is, what happens when the crisis is over?",
        "Holden: So I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Lily and I -- we decided that -- well, we're gonna give it another shot, not only for ourselves, but for our kids. And I wanted you to know that.",
        "Carly: You and Lily have been together for practically your entire lives and I -- I never wanted that to end, Holden -- not on my account.",
        "Holden: You know, you got me through one of the hardest -- hardest times in my life. And I will never, ever be able to thank you for that.",
        "Carly: You just did. I, uh -- I wish you and Lily the very best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You still haven't answered my question.",
        "Lily: Mike, you are a wonderful person, but if you're asking me to give you a reason to stay, I can't do that.",
        "Mike: You and Holden. I noticed something changed for the two of you when Ethan was in trouble.",
        "Lily: It's like all the defenses came down, you know? The dust cleared, and suddenly, we saw each other again.",
        "Mike: So you're back together?",
        "Lily: We're -- we're gonna try, for our family's sake.",

        "Janet: Oh, I'm not so sure about that, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: Because things were going really well between the two of us -- until I made that stupid mistake of helping Bradley destroy evidence. And then everything changed. And I'm not saying that you should have shrugged it off or that you should have forgiven me, but the one thing I wish you hadn't done was go back to your comfort zone. And that's Carly.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm not gonna deny that I was angry with what you did. It was a huge part of my life that was impacted by that. I am no longer a detective. And I need to deal with that.",
        "Janet: I know. And I hate the fact -- I hate myself that you have to go through this.",
        "Jack: Don't hate yourself. I don't want you to hate yourself. I just need space to deal with the changes in my life. I'm not punishing you. It's just -- I need to work through some things. And I'm sorry if it feels like I'm neglecting you. I'm not. It's just -- it's all I can give right now.",
        "Janet: I understand. You are a very special guy. And if I could have you all to myself, I would. But there is a part of you that will always belong to Carly. And that's too bad, 'cause I'm an all-or-nothing kind of girl.",

We can't spend every waking moment trying not to run into each other. And I refuse to avoid seeing you, because to tell you the truth, I like seeing you. I like it a lot.",
        "Alison: Why do you keep pushing this?",

        "Bonnie: Well, can you find someone who will?",
        "Dallas: No. Look, with the charges against him and the limited amount of info he may have to offer, a plea bargain is not in the cards.",
        "Bonnie: I told you this was not going to work.",
        "Derek: Look, I'm not trying to tell you your job, but it doesn't look like you're trying that hard for me, either.",
        "Bonnie: Well, look. Maybe you need to just get another lawyer.",
        "Derek: No, no. You're definitely the only one that I want.",

        "Paul: So he's not even after Meg? He's after our baby?",
        "Barbara: I believe that he sees your baby as a legacy he can control -- another shot at immortality, his future.",
        "Paul: No! It's my future! It's my future, Mom! It's my future with Meg! And I'll die before I let him get his hands on my baby!",

        "Lucinda: Okay. What are you gonna do with that land?",
        "Emma: Well, that's just the question. You know, if I had, uh, you know, deep pockets, I had enough money, I could buy it back. But, you know, I was thinking I might donate it to, uh -- to the town, make it into a nature preserve, you know, or -- or a little park for children to play in.",

        "Brian: Yeah.",

        "Emily: You're not gonna give up with this baby thing, are you?",
        "Casey: I might as well, because it takes two to make a baby, and obviously, you're not into it.",

        "Lily: Well, since the development's not happening, he's probably gonna leave town.",
        "Holden: How do you feel about that?",
        "Lily: I want Mike to be happy. If that means he has to move back to Europe, I think he should do it. What about Carly?",

        "Janet: Oh, Carly. It's more than that, and you know it.",

        "Paul: Oh, come on, Jack. You believe a word he says? Derek could still be working for James. He could be deliberately misleading us.",
        "Barbara: I agree. Sending us up a blind alley would be vintage Stenbeck.",
        "Bonnie: You'd better not be lying.",
        "Derek: I hate Stenbeck as much as everybody else. I was only working for the guy because he was blackmailing me.",
