        "Lily: Mother, there's no proof, but this man claims he has Holden, and I believe him. He said that he wants $100,000, or he's gonna kill him.",
        "Lucinda: $100,000? Honey, it has to be a hoax.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Lucinda: Because it was a horrendous accident, and Holden couldn't have survived. Nobody could.",
        "Lily: I know a lot of this doesn't make sense, but I also know what I feel.",
        "Lucinda: I know, Honey, but what you feel and what you want and what's possible -- they're two different things.",
        "Lily: But if -- if this man has been keeping him hostage all this time --",
        "Lucinda: All right. Then why doesn't he give you some real proof along with the ransom demands?",
        "Lily: They gave me the letter.",
        "Lucinda: But the letter could be fake.",
        "Lily: What do you want?",
        "Lucinda: I want a -- a photo, um, a tape recording, let -- you, talk to him on the phone.",
        "Lily: I -- I don't know. I'm not an expert in ransom demands. And neither are you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't know about that. Honey, did you tell this to Jack?",
        "Lily: Of course.",
        "Lucinda: And?",
        "Lily: He thinks it's somebody just trying to cash in on a story they read in the newspaper.",
        "Lucinda: That's what I've been saying.",
        "Lily: But he -- he didn't say that he didn't think it was possible that they have him. In fact, he and Luke went down to Kentucky to check it out.",
        "Lucinda: I'm afraid, Darling, it's gonna be people taking advantage of the family's grief.",
        "Lily: Mother, I don't think that somebody would chance that unless they actually had him.",
        "Lucinda: $100,000 is very simple people. I -- I just -- I hate seeing you have your hopes built up and then to have them crushed.",
        "Lily: I'm not worried about that. I know I don't have logic. I know I don't have proof. But suddenly, I'm not afraid anymore, because I truly believe that when Jack and Luke come home, they're gonna have Holden with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eb: Answer my question. Is this a trap?",
        "Jack: Okay, why don't you just calm down so we can talk?",
        "Eb: You're a cop, aren't you?",
        "Jack: I'm not from around here. Holden Snyder's my cousin. I'm only here because you called his wife.",
        "Eb: Who's the kid?",
        "Jack: Holden's son.",
        "Eb: This one here?",
        "Damian: I'm a family friend.",
        "Eb: Which one of you's got my money?",
        "Damian: I told you, I don't know anything about any money.",
        "Jack: He's talking about a ransom, Damian. But we're gonna need proof that Holden's alive.",
        "Damian: Is he?",
        "Eb: Like I told the lady, a 100 grand cash, you find out.",
        "Jack: First we find out. And then you get your cash.",
        "Damian: You really think he has Holden?",
        "Jack: That's what he says.",
        "Damian: I don't believe it.",
        "Luke: Are you holding my dad or not?",
        "Jack: Luke, calm down?",
        "Eb: You ought to listen to the cop, Sonny.",
        "Jack: He's worried about his dad. I'm sure you can understand that. You just put that gun down before anyone gets hurt. Then we can work this whole thing out.",
        "Eb: You'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, I'm not as dumb as I look. Now, I want my damn money!",
        "Jack: Not until you prove that Holden Snyder is alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Eb's been gone a long time. Do you think he killed that cop?",
        "Maeve: I -- I really don't think he'd do that.",
        "Holden: If he thought that that cop was on to him. Officer Grady is already dead. He probably got the ransom money and just took off.",
        "Maeve: I hope he didn't take off with you chained up to me, tied to this chair.",
        "Holden: Someone will find us.",
        "Maeve: Holden, you've been here a while. You see us getting much company?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Maeve: If Eb doesn't come back, we're as good as dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Damian? Damian, are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Listen to me. I'm a wealthy man. The money's not a problem.",
        "Eb: So where is it?",
        "Damian: I can get you as much as you want.",
        "Eb: It's supposed to be here now!",
        "Jack: You're not gonna get a dime until we have proof that Holden Snyder's alive.",
        "Eb: Or how about I start shooting you one at a time, starting with sonny boy here?",
        "Jack: How's that gonna get you your money?",
        "Eb: I'm not here to argue.",
        "Jack: And I'm not here to be scammed.",
        "Luke: Jack --",
        "Jack: Let me take care of this.",
        "Damian: Let Jack do his job.",
        "Jack: We got confirmation from the Kentucky police that Holden Snyder was dead. We had a funeral for him back in our hometown. You prove that we're wrong, we'll make you a very rich man.",
        "Eb: Look, I'm through talking. You got my money or not?",
        "Jack: I don't understand why we're having such a communication problem here. I made it very clear --",
        "Eb: Then the kid dies!",
        "Damian: No!",
        "Jack: Luke, stay back! Stay back!",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Luke: No! Damian!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Why aren't these here? And where's the report? Why didn't you give the report to Lily, Damian? You didn't get the analysis done, did you? What the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Damian -- Damian, are you all right?",
        "Damian: My shoulder.",
        "Luke: You're hit.",
        "Jack: Yes, this is Detective Jack Snyder from Illinois I've got a medical emergency. A man has been shot. I'm on the county highway west of Hardwick. Yes, I'm on the scene. Thank you very much.",
        "Luke: Okay. Just -- just hang in there, okay? Okay.",
        "Jack: The entry wound is out! It's actually in a good spot.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "Jack: Yes. And the -- the pool of blood beneath him means that the bullet went through with a clean exit.",
        "Damian: Splendid.",
        "Jack: Just lie still until the medics get here, okay?",
        "Damian: I wasn't really planning on going anywhere.",
        "Luke: Any sign of him?",
        "Jack: Not from up here. It's a long way down.",
        "Luke: That's where my dad went off the cliff.",
        "Jack: I can still see the -- the path he took, if it was him in the truck.",
        "Luke: Wait. Do you think that guy was telling the truth? Do you think my dad is still alive?",
        "Jack: It's hard to know, Luke. He could have been running a scam. Or he could be holding your father somewhere.",
        "Damian: How did you get here?",
        "Luke: He called and said to bring $100,000 to him. My father. He said to make the drop-off here.",
        "Jack: He probably thought you had it, Damian.",
        "Damian: Does that mean Holden's alive?",
        "Jack: We don't really know. A cop was supposed to meet us here, an Officer Grady. Have you seen him?",
        "Damian: No, no. I haven't seen anyone since I got here, except him.",
        "Luke: What are you doing here anyway, Damian?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I was wondering the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So you're telling me that no one ever comes here?",
        "Maeve: No. It's pretty much just me and Eb. Except when Skaggs lived here, and that wasn't that long.",
        "Holden: Why would you let him cut you off from the world like that?",
        "Maeve: I loved him. Let's face it. He wasn't that wrong about people, either. Then he came to live here, and look what happened.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, Skaggs was a special case. There are a lot of other people out there -- normal people. People that you would like. People who would like you.",
        "Maeve: You, for instance?",
        "Holden: Yeah. There's a whole lot more out there for you.",
        "Maeve: You're wrong. People like me don't get much in this life. I'm not like you and your Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I came down to talk to the same officer, Grady. He -- he called.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Damian: At first, I -- I it took a while to get to the point.",
        "[Damian remembering]",
        "Grady: Well, we don't know who burned up in that truck, but it definitely wasn't Holden Snyder, which makes this a whole new case. Eventually he cut to the chase, and he said that as a friend of the family, I might want her to know that, uh -- there has been a lot of talk in the police department about \"Mysterious circumstances\" surrounding Holden's death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: \"Mysterious circumstances\"?",
        "Damian: Yeah. He was implying that, uh, they had some evidence, uh, that Holden was driving under the influence -- alcohol, maybe -drugs -- and that he was carrying someone in the truck that wasn't supposed to be with him.",
        "Jack: Wait, you mean like a woman?",
        "Damian: He didn't come out and say that, but, uh, that's what he was implying. And I -- I told him that those were damaging accusations. And the last thing I wanted was for Lily and her family to hear that.",
        "Jack: And how did he respond to that?",
        "Damian: He said that he had been approached by the media but that he hadn't talked yet.",
        "Jack: What do you think he wanted from you?",
        "Damian: I think he was hoping I would offer him an incentive to keep quiet. That's when I decided to come down here and -- and talk to him face-to-face and to set him straight and to make damn sure that Lily and her children wouldn't get hurt by his damn story, his crazy -- but ever since I got here, I haven't been able to track him down. He hasn't returned my calls.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Jack: It's Lily. Hey, Lily.",
        "Lily: Did you find out anything?",
        "Jack: Uh -- no. I'm sorry, Honey. There's still no proof that Holden's alive.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: What about that man who called?",
        "Jack: He was here, but Holden wasn't. Looks like a hoax.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "[Siren wailing]",
        "Jack: I'll call you as soon as I can, okay? I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: he's not coming home.",
        "[Lily sobs]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, Honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There was no sign of my cousin. Just this backwoods guy with a gun. He was six feet tall, 160 pounds, Caucasian, blue eyes, mustache, blond hair under a baseball cap.",
        "Keeler: Could be a dozen guys from around here.",
        "Jack: Right. And Grady didn't tell you where he was going?",
        "Keeler: It's not like him to disappear.",
        "Jack: Why don't you try and raise him again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know, you're wrong about me. I pretty much grew up like you did.",
        "Maeve: I highly doubt that.",
        "Holden: No, no. I grew up on a farm. Learned everything there was to know about horses. In my teens, I got a job as a stable boy. Lily -- she used to come down and ride. She is the one who lived in a mansion. Hell, I pretty much, uh, fell in love with her the first time I saw her.",
        "Maeve: Was it love at first sight for her, too?",
        "Holden: Are you kidding me? She didn't even look at me. I was just some guy who took care of her horse.",
        "Maeve: Sounds like you took pretty good care of her, too.",
        "Holden: Well, not then. I wasn't her kind of people. And everyone told me that I never had a chance.",
        "Maeve: So what happened?",
        "Holden: I never gave up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Even now, even after talking to Jack, I -- I feel like Holden is trying to reach out to me through those people to let me know that he isn't dead.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, how is that possible?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I -- I just don't feel like I've lost him.",
        "Lucinda: That's because you -- you haven't had time, really, to accept that he's -- he's gone. Holden is still in your heart.",
        "Lily: He always will be.",
        "Lucinda: That's why I think you have to take your time now, wait till you can accept that he's gone before you start anything new.",
        "Lily: This is about Damian.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. It's not just Damian.",
        "Lily: You don't give up, do you? You just keep pushing and pushing!",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I'm worried about you, I love you, and I do not think that you are ready to start any kind of a new relationship.",
        "Lily: I want you to stop.",
        "Lucinda: No. I won't. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: Stable boy and the princess. Sounds like a fairy tale.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it was pretty much like that when she told me that she loved me. But then it became like real life. We had our ups and downs, our disappointments. We even betrayed each other.",
        "Maeve: You did, or she did?",
        "Holden: Both of us.",
        "Maeve: Why?",
        "Holden: We were just people. Made mistakes, did stupid things. But we never stopped loving each other. We never stopped believing that we belonged together.",
        "Maeve: What you have with Lily -- I always hoped I'd have something like that with Eb.",
        "Holden: What made you think it was possible with him?",
        "Maeve: He wasn't always like this.",
        "Holden: What was he like? What did you see in him?",
        "Maeve: Well -- he was young and handsome, full of hope. He said we'd get rich, get out of here, that he'd give me everything I ever wanted.",
        "Holden: And you believe him?",
        "Maeve: Yeah, I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You think you know what's right for me.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you know, you go back and forth like a ping-pong ball. One minute, you think that Holden's still alive. The next minute, you're jumping into -- into bed with Damian.",
        "Lily: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Lucinda: Do you even know what you're doing?",
        "Lily: What kind of a question is that?",
        "Lucinda: I am not the only one who's worried about you. Your kids are worried about you, as well. Faith is in agony. She has lost her father, and she can't confide in her mother about it.",
        "Lily: I'm not having this conversation with you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, why not?",
        "Lily: Because it's not the right time.",
        "Lucinda: I think it is the right time. I think it's time. It's time that you stopped doing what you are doing right now before Damian ruins what's left of your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Luke: Anything?",
        "Jack: No sign of Grady. And Officer Keeler doesn't recognize the gunman from my description.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Great. So we're nowhere.",
        "Jack: We are alive, Luke, thanks to Damian.",
        "Luke: He's right, you know? You saved my life.",
        "Damian: It was my privilege.",
        "Luke: Look, Damian, I know I've been really tough on you lately, and I'm still not happy about you and my mom, but I --",
        "Damian: It's all right, Luke. I'm not expecting you to understand.",
        "Luke: But I know that you have her best interests at heart.",
        "Damian: Always.",
        "Luke: And mine, too.",
        "Damian: Always.",
        "Luke: Damian, are you okay?",
        "Damian: I just --",
        "Luke: Help! Help, help! He passed out!",
        "Jack: We should search the ravine for that gunman. If by any chance he's still alive, he can tell us something. What's going on?",
        "EMT: He's stabilized, but we should take him to that clinic --",
        "Damian: No, no. I need to get home.",
        "EMT: I wouldn't advise that.",
        "Damian: I'll get treatment when I'm back in Oakdale. I'll be fine. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Yeah, he's stubborn. Sorry about that.",
        "EMT: No worries.",
        "Jack: Anything? You really got to organize a search.",
        "Keeler: Thanks, Detective, but, uh, we'll take it from here.",
        "Jack: You have my cell. Keep me posted?",
        "Damian: If you help me get to the airport, you're welcome to fly home with me.",
        "Jack: No reason not to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: Skaggs was pretty ticked off that Eb got to go free and he had to do time.",
        "Holden: So Skaggs -- he never told Eb where the money was?",
        "Maeve: Skaggs said Eb's share was the price he had to pay for Skaggs keeping his mouth shut. Eb just about went crazy knowing all that money was out there, and he couldn't get his hands on it. And he never was the same after that. He got mean. He got violent. I don't know. It's like -- like he disappeared in this angry, angry head.",
        "Holden: And took you with him?",
        "Maeve: Yeah. I guess so.",
        "Holden: That's why you need to get out of here. That's why you need to get away from him.",
        "Maeve: I really thought I could do that. I did. Then I woke up.",
        "Holden: No, don't say that.",
        "Maeve: Holden, you told me some really pretty stories, and I really wanted to believe them. It's too late for me.",
        "Holden: No, that's not true. You're a young woman. You got your whole life ahead of you. You just need help. I'm gonna make sure that you get it.",
        "Maeve: I hate to break it to you, but you're chained to a bed, and I'm chained to a chair, and we're not going anywhere. Eb doesn't come back, we're just gonna die here.",
        "Holden: No, we're not. We're gonna get out of here, now.",
        "Maeve: What -- what are you doing?!",
        "Holden: Getting us out of here. Okay. I'm gonna try and knock you over.",
        "Maeve: Why would you do that?",
        "Holden: Once you're on the floor, I'm gonna untie your feet, and then I'm gonna slip the handcuffs off the chair.",
        "Maeve: That's not gonna work.",
        "Holden: Do you have any better ideas?",
        "Maeve: No.",
        "Holden: You're gonna need to brace yourself. You're probably gonna hit the floor pretty hard.",
        "Maeve: I figured that.",
        "Holden: Ready?",
        "Maeve: I guess so. Okay.",
        "[Both groaning]",
        "Holden: Maeve? Maeve, are you okay? Maeve? Maeve, just blink. Just nod. Maeve? Maeve, answer me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Your vital signs are stable. We'll need to keep you overnight for observation.",
        "Damian: Is that really necessary?",
        "Doctor: If you're okay, you can go home in the morning. You'll need to limit your activities and go to therapy, but you should make a full recovery.",
        "Damian: Thanks, Doc.",
        "Luke: That doesn't sound that bad.",
        "Damian: Yeah, I guess I was lucky.",
        "Luke: What were you doing going after that guy in the first place?",
        "Damian: I wasn't doing anything. I was thinking he was pointing that gun at you and threatening to use it. I had to do something.",
        "Luke: Well, it was right after you told me to let Jack do his job.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, I never was very good at taking my own advice.",
        "Luke: Mm. Me neither. Must be genetic.",
        "[Damian chuckles]",
        "Luke: I'm glad you're okay.",
        "Damian: I am. So you don't have to hang around here, Luke. I know you have many things to do.",
        "Luke: Well, Noah is away with one of his professors, so I actually have nothing to do. And you saved my life. The least I can do is keep you company.",
        "Damian: Have you called your mother?",
        "Luke: Not yet.",
        "Damian: Well, you should. Let her know you're okay.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Well, maybe you should get some sleep. Um, I've got some stuff I need to do. But I'll be back.",
        "Damian: Tell your mother I'll speak to her later.",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Damian: Luke -- thanks for giving me another chance.",
        "Luke: You deserved it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Honey. I'm sorry I didn't find him.",
        "Lily: You were right. It was too good to be true.",

        "Lily: What kind of a person takes advantage of people like that?",
        "Jack: We don't know.",
        "Lily: He got away?",
        "Jack: Probably not. When we got to the crash site, he was holding a gun on Damian.",
        "Lily: What? Damian was there? He told me he was going on a business trip.",
        "Jack: He told me he was following up on a call he got from a cop in, uh, Kentucky.",
        "Lily: What cop?",
        "Jack: An Officer Grady. He was part of the crew investigating Holden's accident.",
        "Lily: What was left to investigate of the accident?",
        "Jack: Nothing that I know of.",
        "Lily: Why would that cop be calling here now?",
        "Jack: Lily, these are all things you have to ask Damian.",
        "Lily: It wouldn't be about the ransom demand. He didn't even know about that. He just said that he was going to San Francisco on business for a few days for the shipping company, and he never mentioned a word about Kentucky.",
        "Jack: Okay, whatever he went to go talk to that guy about, he never got a chance to, because Officer Grady is missing. When we got there, it was just Damian and this perp. The perp had a gun. He was threatening Luke. Damian went after him. He ended up falling off the same cliff as Holden.",
        "Lily: He's dead?",
        "Jack: Probably. The cops have to find a body to make sure.",
        "Lily: Is Luke okay? Where is Luke?!",
        "Jack: Luke took Damian to the hospital.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Jack: Because Damian took a bullet in the shoulder when he went after the guy. He's fine. He's fine. They're just checking it out.",
        "Lily: I -- I have to go there to him.",
        "Jack: You know what? I'm gonna meet you over there as soon as I check in at the station. I want to ask Damian a few more questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hi. I -- I assume that you've heard about the ransom fiasco. It was a cruel hoax.",
        "Meg: So my brother isn't alive?",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: There was no sign of him. And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry if your hopes were -- were raised. It's just not fair. It's not fair to you. It's not fair to Lily.",
        "Meg: Okay. I have something to show you.",
        "Lucinda: Good heavens. Is this the letter from the first extortionist?",
        "Meg: That's right. That's right. And the other one is a list from Holden that he gave to the stable guys.",
        "Lucinda: Where did you get these?",
        "Meg: Damian's room. But there was no report. I don't think he ever got the handwriting analyzed.",
        "Lucinda: I wonder just what he was planning on doing.",
        "Meg: You tell me.",
        "Lucinda: Lily still thinks that Holden could be alive.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Well, that makes her recent behavior even stranger.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, come on. She's in pain. She doesn't know what she's doing from one day to the next. She's just clinging to the possibility that somehow, Holden survived the awful crash.",
        "Meg: Well, Damian must believe it, too, if he's afraid to get those analyzed.",
        "Lucinda: Damian's first impulse is to lie, always. But, of course, Darling, you know that.",
        "Meg: I thought he changed.",
        "Lucinda: You wouldn't be the first one to fall for that little fiction.",
        "Meg: You mean Lily?",
        "Lucinda: Luke.",
        "Meg: But not Holden.",
        "Lucinda: No. Holden never trusted him. Neither did I.",
        "Meg: Well, you were right.",
        "Lucinda: Mm.",
        "Meg: So now what do we do with these to prove it?",
        "Lucinda: Take them to Jack. He never trusted him, either.",
        "Meg: I can't do that. He'll know I stole them.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, if Damian gave you the key to his room, you had every right to be there.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but I didn't have a right to go through his things when he wasn't there.",
        "Lucinda: Jack won't arrest you.",
        "Meg: I don't know about that. He never forgave me for lying to get Paul off the hook when he disappeared with Eliza.",
        "Lucinda: Water under the bridge.",
        "Meg: I'm not gonna take that chance. My daughter needs me. What are you doing?",
        "Lucinda: I will not tell Jack that I got these from you.",
        "Meg: He'll think that he took them yourself.",
        "Lucinda: Let him.",
        "Meg: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Lucinda: My daughter needs me, too.",

        "Lily: Jack told me what happened. Are you all right?",
        "Damian: I am now.",
        "Lily: He told me you saved Luke's life.",
        "Damian: I'm just glad I was there.",
        "Lily: You didn't tell me you were going to Kentucky.",
        "Damian: I wanted to speak to a policeman down there.",
        "Lily: I didn't even know anyone had called. You should have told me.",
        "Damian: They were just making wild speculations about how the accident might have happened. I didn't want you to have to go back there.",
        "Lily: Jack said that the cop disappeared. You never even got to talk to him.",
        "Damian: No.",
        "Lily: Damian, if this is gonna work between us, you have to tell me everything.",
        "Damian: I will from now on. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: This is the authorization that the woman gave to Holden's bank.",
        "Jack: When she tried to access his account.",
        "Lucinda: Damian was gonna get that compared professionally with known samples of Holden's writing -- this.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, he should have taken care of this.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I think the reason he didn't want you to was he didn't intend to do it at all.",
        "Jack: What makes you say that?",
        "Lucinda: These were found in a drawer in his hotel room. Now, he never told Lily he got them back again, and there is no report.",
        "Jack: Wait. These were found in his drawer?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, Sir.",
        "Jack: And how did you come to have them?",
        "Lucinda: If you're accusing me of breaking and entering, I didn't do it.",
        "Jack: Who did?",
        "Lucinda: No one.",
        "Jack: Don't lie to me, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: I am not the liar here.",
        "Jack: Okay. Then what -- what makes you think he didn't want to have these analyzed?",
        "Lucinda: Because if there was a conclusive match, then Lily might think that Holden was still alive.",
        "Jack: And is that what you think -- that Holden's alive?",
        "Lucinda: No, no. No, I don't. But Damian wants a clear path to Lily. He doesn't want any hope.",
        "Jack: That's a bit of a stretch.",
        "Lucinda: What else explains this?",
        "Jack: Maybe he was doing her a favor.",
        "Lucinda: How?",
        "Jack: She's grasping at anything that might mean that Holden's alive, and the sooner that she accepts the truth, the better.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I think she's accepted the truth a little too fast, but that's another subject. I do not think its okay for Damian to mislead Lily like this.",
        "Jack: No. I don't think so either.",
        "Lucinda: So you're gonna follow up on it?",
        "Jack: I'm more concerned as to how you procured these samples. Because if they were stolen by somebody, they're inadmissible as evidence.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, well, there must be something, you know?",
        "Jack: I knew that Damian was gonna have them analyzed.",
        "Lucinda: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: I guess it wouldn't hurt if I asked him if he got the results.",
        "Lucinda: And if he lies?",
        "Jack: Now, that's a lead I can follow.",

        "Maeve: I'll go for help.",
        "Holden: No, no. You can't just leave me here. What if Eb comes back? He'll kill me.",
        "Maeve: We got to get somebody to get you out of the chains.",

        "Maeve: How?",
        "Holden: I don't know, but you can't just leave me here. Not like this.",

        "Damian: It's, uh -- it's fine. Thanks. You were right. Nothing serious. Little uncomfortable.",
        "Jack: Good. Glad to hear it.",
        "Damian: What about Grady? Have they found him?",
        "Jack: I haven't heard yet.",
        "Damian: Will you let me know when you do?",
        "Jack: Absolutely. In the meantime, do you mind if I ask you a few more questions?",
        "Damian: Why?",
        "Jack: Just trying to tie up a few loose ends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, I heard the, uh, ransom call was another hoax.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Looks like it.",
        "Meg: Is your mother okay?",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Luke: Like you care. She told me about the little conversation you had.",

        "Luke: You said that you were really hard on her about Damian.",
        "Meg: Luke, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't see how this concerns you.",

        "Luke: They're my parents, Meg. And I know that you weren't happy that they got back together.",

        "Luke: Look, Meg, I know you're hurt, and I don't blame you. But I'm just asking for a favor. Can you please just back off? My mom is having a really rough time right now, especially with all these phony ransom demands.",
        "Meg: This isn't easy on any of us.",
        "Luke: No, I know. It's not. And we have to deal with it in any way we can. And if Damian can help my mother by giving her some of the solace that she needs, I think that's a great thing.",

        "Damian: I'm fine, Jack. What do you need to know?",
        "Jack: The letter that woman at the bank said was from Holden -- didn't you take that in to have that handwriting analyzed.",

        "Damian: He said it wasn't a match.",

        "Damian: For the same reason we didn't tell you about the call from the policeman, which I already promised I won't do again.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we're gonna need a copy of that report for our records.",
        "Damian: As soon as I get it.",

        "Damian: It's all right, Lily.",
        "Lily: No, it's not all right. You need to rest. Jack, I think you've asked enough questions for today. I think you should leave, now.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, he's desperate that Lily thinks that he's gone.",
