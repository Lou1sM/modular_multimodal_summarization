        "\r\nDamien: Yeah. But first, we must see my plan through. Luciano, you're my life. \r\nTo lose you would be to lose my very life, do you understand? You're a young man \r\nnow. You've been through a difficult ordeal. And you've been, but since you are \r\na young man, I must be completely open with you. I know you can bear the truth.",

It was a \r\nboarding school, and I was to be there for three years. I was scared and lonely \r\njust like you are right now. Yes, seemed like forever, and I was counting the \r\ndays till my first visit home. I was allowed no phone calls, no letters, no \r\ncontact with the outside world for the first few months. I was completely cut \r\noff from anyone I knew and loved. You know what I did? I would lie in bed at \r\nnight and close my eyes and in an instant, I would be home again. I would \r\nimagine my father's face. Do it, Luciano. Close your eyes. Go ahead, try it. \r\nClose your eyes. What do you see?",

And, yeah, of course you need time to heal, but it just seems to me, Jack, \r\nas if you're punishing yourself for something that wasn't your fault. It was not \r\nyour fault. It was Julia and Owen. Sure, you made a bad call, but you were \r\nsuspended. You have been punished. It is over.",

And I -- I know I can \r\ncome up with some ideas that we can run with, and if I can't handle it, I \r\npromise, I'll call in the reinforcements. Don't look at me like that.
