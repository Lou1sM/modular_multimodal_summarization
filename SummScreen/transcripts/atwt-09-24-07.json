        "Cop: Maybe I should call an ambulance.",
        "Carly: No. No, no, no, no. I'm just -- feeling a little lightheaded. That's all. I'm okay.",
        "Cop: Right.",
        "Carly: You know, I haven't eaten yet today. I've been going through a pretty tough time, you know, Doug.",
        "Cop: I understand.",
        "Carly: I probably just poured myself a few too many glasses of wine last night.",
        "Cop: I'm not leaving you here. And in ten minutes I'm going to be late for a stakeout. So if you don't want to go to the hospital, then you're coming with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: By gathering together all our fondest hopes for Jack and Kathryn from all present here, we assure them that our hearts are in tune with theirs.",
        "Vienna: What are you doing?",
        "Henry: Keeping an eye out for the one whose fondest wish is to see this wedding tank.",
        "Vienna: If Carly does show up, there's a pitchfork in the barn. Maybe I should go get it.",
        "Henry: Carly with a pitchfork -- how apt.",
        "Vienna: Let's try not to think the worst. After all, love is in the air.",
        "Minister: They stand before us today, because that seed and friendship blossom into love. Kathryn and Jack --",
        "Kim: What's with Brad?",
        "Bob: I know. Looks like he'd rather be anyplace but here.",
        "Katie: We will.",

        "Parker: Hey J.J., get ready for bunk beds.",
        "Minister: Marriage is an act of faith and a personal commitment as well as a moral and physical union between two people. It requires and deserves daily attention and loving kindness, supported by the will to make it last.",

        "Cop: I didn't know what else to do but bring her here.",
        "Carly: I do not need a babysitter.",
        "Cop: I think she might need a lot more than that.",
        "Dallas: No offense, but you really don't look so good.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you. And you know, I didn't want to argue with Doug, but passing out at Old Town is not an arrestable offense. So if you'll excuse me --",
        "Dallas: Driving without a license is an arrestable offense. So is driving while intoxicated.",
        "Carly: I am not drunk!",
        "Dallas: I can see that. Which is why I'd like to take you to the hospital.",
        "Carly: No, thank you.",
        "Dallas: Jack would want me to make sure you're okay, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not Jack's job to look after me anymore, is it?",
        "Dallas: At least let me call someone. Gwen? Or Rosanna.",
        "Carly: No. No, I don't want them to see me like this.",
        "Dallas: Then you admit you're in bad shape.",
        "Carly: Yes, I'm in bad shape. The love of my life is marrying another woman.",
        "Dallas: Okay. If you won't let me take you to the hospital, then you need to have a responsible party come and get you. Because there's no way I'm letting you out on the town alone in this condition.",
        "Carly: Dallas, please.",
        "Dallas: You've got to be reasonable.",
        "Carly: Who, me?",

        "Minister: Into this holy estate these two persons present now come to be joined. If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.",

        "Holden: Would you turn that thing off?",
        "Brad: Okay, I'm sorry. I'll be right back. It's an emergency.",
        "Margo: I knew I should've kept that phone.",
        "Brad: Hello?",
        "Carly: I hope I didn't catch you in the middle of something.",
        "Brad: Uh, no. What do you need?",
        "Carly: I need you to come down and get me. I'm -- I'm at the police station.",

        "Carly: It's a long story. I'll explain when you get here.",
        "Brad: I'm on my way.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to make you late for the wedding, am I?",
        "Brad: No, no worries. I'll be right there. I'm sorry.",

        "Brad: I mean, I'll be back. Right back, okay? There's something I have to do. It's important.",
        "Jack: No, it's not okay.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. Wait for me. Wait for me.",
        "Jack: What is wrong with you, Brad? It's all right, just -- let's keep going.",
        "Katie: No, no. I think we should wait.",
        "Jack: Katie --",
        "Katie: What's a few minutes? We'll at least be married.",
        "Jack: I know, but --",
        "Katie: We did this so fast, and so many of our friends and family couldn't be here. I know it's important for you to have your brother here. It's important for me, too.",
        "Jack: You're right, you're right. Sometimes I think you know me better than I know myself. Umm -- sorry everybody. Sorry for the hold-up, but it looks like we're going to take a five minute break. So feel free to stand up and stretch, and chit-chat. Help yourself to one of Emma's famous pecan cookies. She mailed us six dozen to remember her by. But don't touch the cake. Okay? No cake.",
        "Henry: What are they thinking?",
        "Margo: Do you have any idea who was on the phone with Brad?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Margo: Because he's been on that phone all day.",
        "Holden: I figured he was trying to get a date for the reception. He must've called every woman in his little black book of his.",
        "Margo: Well, whoever she is, she better get here soon or I'm gonna kill 'em both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're not going to tell Jack about this, are you?",
        "Dallas: I heard you had a car accident the other night.",
        "Carly: I wasn't drinking.",
        "Dallas: I didn't say you were.",
        "Carly: I am not a danger to myself or to anyone else.",
        "Dallas: Why don't you want Jack to know what happened to you today?",
        "Carly: Because I don't want him to overreact. Because I don't want him to keep me from my kids --",
        "Dallas: He wouldn't do that, Carly. He'd want to know.",
        "Carly: Dallas, promise me you won't tell him. Please.",

        "Margo: Sit.",
        "Katie: I can't, I'll wrinkle.",
        "Margo: Well, stop pacing, you'll sweat. Here -- drink.",
        "Katie: I can't, I'll have to go to the bathroom. And how am I going to do that in this dress?",
        "Margo: Why don't you just march right back out there and get married?",
        "Katie: Why am I so nervous? I know Jack loves me. And I know I love him.",
        "Margo: All right, I'm just going to come right out and ask this -- do you think that Carly and Brad are up to something?",
        "Katie: No. No, Brad wouldn't do something to me on my wedding day. And Carly better not try to do anything -- oh no!",
        "Jack: Boy, I sure knew what I was doing when I chose you to be my best man.",
        "Holden: Brad will be back.",
        "Jack: I'm paying the photographer by the hour. She's got another gig today. Boy, leave it up to my brother to push my buttons.",
        "Holden: You know what, Katie was right. Brad's family and that's important. That's why we're waiting for him.",
        "Jack: He'd better not let us down.",
        "J.J.: Umm -- what're you doing?",
        "Parker: This thing's choking me. I mean, I'll put it back on if this wedding ever gets started again.",
        "Faith: Don't say if.",
        "J.J.: Well I hope the party starts soon. I'm starving.",
        "Parker: You're always starving.",
        "J.J.: Well good luck putting back your tie.",
        "Faith: Don't worry, I'll help you. By the way, you guys look great.",
        "J.J.: Thanks. So do you.",
        "Kim: Well, I don't know. I've seen Oakdale weddings stopped for just about every reason under the sun, but this takes the cake.",
        "Bob: Well, if we ever get to cut the cake. You think it looks like rain?",
        "Tom: I always heard rain on your wedding day was good luck.",
        "Bob: Not if your wedding's outside. And my umbrella is in the trunk of my son's wonderful automobile on the side of the interstate.",
        "Kim: All right, all right you two. You know, Katie and I talked about featuring her wedding on the show. But she said she was too superstitious.",
        "Tom: No wonder. I told you it was a bad sign when my car broke down.",
        "Kim: Poor Katie -- I really wanted this day to be perfect for her.",
        "Bob: Well if she winds up being married to Jack at the end of the day, it probably will be.",
        "Vienna: Brad won't be back anytime soon.",
        "Henry: That's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Dear. How are we going to entertain our guests?",
        "Henry: Well that's easy. If there's one thing that we know how to do, it's how to liven up a party.",
        "Vienna: There are children here.",
        "Henry: I know that. You're so dirty. Hey -- hey, everybody. I got an idea as a way of passing the time, maybe with a little stimulating conversation. What do you say about we each take turns and talk about Jack and Katie's best-kept secrets?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Here she is.",
        "Brad: What happened?",
        "Carly: Hey, I'm sorry, Brad. I didn't know who else to call. I blacked out again.",
        "Brad: Here?",
        "Carly: No, in Old Town. When I woke up, I didn't even know who I was. The police, they brought me here.",
        "Brad: They brought you here? Why didn't they take you to the hospital?",
        "Carly: I didn't want them to.",
        "Brad: Carly.",
        "Carly: Brad, I know what's wrong with me. And they can't do anything to fix it.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. But maybe they can buy you more quality time. You tell me, if you could have one more day with your kids -- wouldn't that be worth it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Katie, my lovely wife-to-be, doesn't have any secrets. No, she doesn't. Even if you haven't read \"Oakdale Confidential,\" all you have to do is watch her show for a week. And you will know everything from what she eats for breakfast to what she wears to bed. Thank you very much.",
        "Henry: Like that won't change after today. [Laughter] You know, I'm sure that some of you are aware of Katie's perky and fluffy little bunny, Snickers. And Sage's pet turtle, Arnold. Right, Arnold? Which brings to mind the famous fable of the tortoise and the hare. Stay with me.",
        "Jack: Yes, I'm with you.",
        "Henry: Fate brought Jack and Katie together a long time ago, first as friends. Now I'm sure that some of you are aware that Katie can be a little quirky, can be a little flighty --",
        "Jack: Take it easy.",
        "Henry: She can be flighty. But there is no better friend than Katie Peretti soon-to-be Snyder.",
        "Vienna: Hear, hear.",
        "Henry: All right. Now I'm not the one that should be saying this, but I've got to tell you that this is the secret to a long lasting relationship. I know this seemed like a whirlwind courtship, but I think this wedding will prove -- that slow and steady wins the race.",
        "Jack: It all has a point!",
        "Henry: I'm a genius!",
        "Jack: You are. A genius! That was a wonderful story.",
        "Henry: Yes well, you know --",
        "Jack: And speaking of turtles, my brother is certainly taking his time, isn't he? Kim, he doesn't have much of a social life. Do you think that phone call could have had something to do with work?",
        "Kim: Well, no. We're not even shooting this week. Have you thought about calling him?",
        "Jack: Now there's an idea.",
        "Kim: Well, that's why they pay me the big bucks.",
        "Jack: Yes they do. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Come on. Let me take you to the hospital. You can't go around fainting all over the place. Especially if you don't want Jack to know that something is wrong. [Cell phone rings] It's Jack.",
        "Carly: You're in the wedding party. He needs you. You have to go.",
        "Brad: No, I'm a lowly usher. He doesn't need me. I'll just tell him that I'm running a little late.",
        "Carly: You won't mention anything about me?",
        "Brad: I promised, didn't I? Ahh, hey. Yeah, how's it going?",
        "Jack: It's not. Where are you?",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. This is taking longer than I thought. But I will be there real soon.",
        "Jack: Well, just get here when you get here. You know, I didn't want to get married without my brother, but hey, I understand -- you've got more important things to do.",
        "Carly: Is everything okay?",
        "Brad: Yep, yep. Jack is -- he's fine. Great. It's all set.",
        "Carly: The wedding is starting soon, isn't it? Brad, you have to go. Go get to the farm.",
        "Brad: No, no. I'm exactly where I need to be. Nothing is more important than taking care of you. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh Katie, it's only water.",
        "Katie: There's a reason these dresses are dry clean only. Maybe I should've invited Carly. She'd know what to do.",
        "Margo: Voila. As good as new.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Margo: Yeah. See, I'm good for some things.",
        "Katie: Oh, you're good for a lot of things. Thank you so much! Okay, now I gotta get out there and get married before something else goes wrong.",
        "Jack: Nothing else - nothing else is going to go wrong. Ready to say I do?",
        "Katie: Brad's here?",
        "Jack: I am -- I am saying I do in front of God and my children. That's all that matters. Let's get married.",
        "Katie: You sure?",
        "Jack: I am beyond sure.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm so excited. I can't wait to be Mrs. Jack Snyder.",
        "Jack: Thankfully, you won't have to. Save that for later.",
        "Katie: So close!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Have you ever waited less than four hours in the emergency room? You're going to miss Jack's wedding.",
        "Brad: And I'm not going to take you to the emergency room. I'm sure Dr. Evers will fit you right in.",
        "Carly: Still. I don't remember exactly when the ceremony is, but I know it's in the afternoon. So I'm sure you're cutting it close.",
        "Brad: Jack said that Katie's having a hair emergency. And I know from work that could set them back at least two hours. Look, I know you don't want go to the hospital and get more tests 'cause you're afraid you might get more bad news. But you cannot avoid the doctors forever.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Brad: Because if he can do something for you -- you owe it to your kids, and you owe it to yourself.",
        "Carly: All right. You're right. You're right.",
        "Brad: Get out. Hey, excuse -- I need to write this down. You know, hey Dallas, do you have a pen and paper? She just said I'm right. See, that's the Carly that I know. Come on, let's go. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Thank God. I was running out of stories.",
        "Jack: Yes Darling?",
        "Sage: But Uncle Brad isn't here.",
        "Jack: He'll be here for the best part -- the party. So can we -- can we pick up where we left off? Please?",
        "Minister: If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together --",
        "Parker: Nobody objects. Let's do this.",
        "Jack: Katie, true to form, it's been one heck of a day. There's a time there when I didn't think we'd make it through our first date, much less all the way to the altar.",
        "Minister: Twice.",
        "Jack: Okay, thank you. And you know I don't read Shakespeare, but I do believe he said something about the course of true love not being smooth. You and I both thought that we'd found true love in the past. And it wasn't so long ago, we were just a couple of lonely hearts looking for someone who understood. And that's when I saw you with my children -- and that's when I fell in love with you. Katie, we're not -- we're not going to be joined together as one today -- but as a family. And I cannot wait to start building our family and our future, together.",
        "Katie: Jack, my whole life I have been searching for something -- thrill, adventure -- I could never really put my finger on it. Until you. I figured out what it was. It was you. Strong, stable, wonderful you. And your wonderful family. And now I would like to say something to Parker, Sage and J.J. I am making vows to your father, today, but I want to make a promise to you, too. I know you have a mother who loves you very much. And I could never replace her. I would never try. But I am here for you. And I will love you and respect you always. Thank you so much for sharing your father with me. And I feel so blessed to have all of you in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Evers: You know, I did warn you that the symptoms might worsen.",
        "Carly: I didn't realize it would happen so quickly.",
        "Dr. Evers: The lesion may be growing more rapidly than we hoped. Listen, I'd really like to admit you and run some tests.",
        "Carly: More tests?",
        "Brad: Couldn't she do it as an outpatient?",
        "Dr. Evers: I'm afraid not. I really want to monitor you overnight. Look, I'll just -- I'll be right back with your admissions paperwork, okay?",
        "Carly: This is exactly what I was afraid of. I don't know if I can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I, Jack, take you, Kathryn, to be my wife. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, 'til death do us part.",
        "Katie: I, Kathryn, take you, Jack, to be my husband. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish, 'til death do us part.",
        "Minister: Wedding rings are an outward and visible sign of an inward spiritual grace and the unbroken circle of love, signifying to all the union of this man and this woman in marriage.",
        "Jack: Thank you. This ring is a token of my love. I marry you with this ring, with all that I have, with all that I am.",
        "Katie: This ring is a token of my love. I marry you with this ring, with all that I have and all that I am.",
        "Minister: By the power vested in me by the state of Illinois, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you.",
        "Minister: I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Jack Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Dying is bad enough. Dying just as my husband marries a woman that I don't even like, who's now going to be the mother of my children -- can life be so unfair?",
        "Brad: Your kids have one mother, Carly. And that's you.",
        "Carly: Not for much longer. I've already wasted so much time, I am not going to waste another minute.",
        "Brad: Then stop arguing with everyone who's trying to help you, and help yourself. It's just a few tests.",
        "Carly: Which could lead to a few procedures. Who knows if I'll ever leave this place again?",
        "Brad: Your life is not over. What are you afraid is going to happen if you stay?",
        "Carly: I'm afraid of losing control. Losing my kids.",
        "Brad: Look at me. Then take control. Get treatment. Fight. Because no one could be a better mother to your children than you.",

        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Faith: You okay?",
        "Parker: I was just kind of dreading today. I mean, I like really Katie, and I know nothing's going to go back to the way it was before -- it all just seems so permanent now.",
        "Faith: I know.",
        "Parker: And I feel sorry for my mom, too. I mean, here we are, officially a family now. And Jack's not even my real dad. Well, I mean, he is, but you know what I mean. He's not J.J.'s either. She's the whole reason that we were a family. And now she's just -- alone.",

        "Jack: Not exactly.",
        "Katie: Okay, perfectly us. And I don't want it to end.",
        "Jack: Oh, you see, it has to. Because after today, there's tomorrow -- and the next day, and the next day, and the next day.",
        "Katie: Thank you for putting that into perfect perspective.",

        "Katie: I do!",
        "Margo: Except for you. You, Katie, have gone through a lot to get to this day, and I think everyone knows that Katie's got a little bit of a reputation to live up to. But the truth is, when Katie loves you, there isn't anything she wouldn't do for you. Including giving you half her liver. Beautiful, beautiful little sister, be happy, be healthy, and be married for a long, long, long time! Cheers.",

        "Carly: Well?",
        "Dr. Evers: Well, your disorientation earlier may have been caused by a seizure.",
        "Carly: Well, what does that mean?",
        "Dr. Evers: It means you're likely to have more.",
        "Brad: Is there anything you can do for her?",
        "Dr. Ever: Well, again, I recommend palliative treatment. It won't change the outcome, but we can improve your quality of life in the short term.",
        "Carly: What if the treatment just makes me sicker?",
        "Dr. Evers: The option to discontinue the protocol is always yours. But if you are going to try it, I advise you to do it immediately.",
        "Carly: Or?",
        "Dr. Evers: Your disease is progressing very quickly, Carly. If you wait to begin treatment, it may be too late for us to do anything significant for you. Look, why don't you stay the night, all right? Get a good night's rest. I'll schedule you for an MRI and we can discuss an exact course of treatment in the morning.",
        "Carly: No. No. I'm supposed to watch my kids while my -- ex-husband is on his honeymoon.",

        "Carly: He can't know.",
        "Dr. Ever: He's going to find out eventually.",
        "Carly: Not on his wedding day, he's not. If it's the last gift I can give him, I will not ruin his happiness. Not this time.",
        "Brad: Carly, Jack would never forgive you if he found out that you were sacrificing your health just so he wouldn't get bad news on his wedding day.",
        "Carly: Jack won't forgive me for a lot of things. I'm not sacrificing my health, Brad. I'm dying no matter what.",
        "Brad: We're all dying someday, Carly.",
        "Carly: Dr. Evers, are you saying that this treatment will give me more time? Or that it will just make the time that I have more comfortable?",
        "Dr. Ever: Look, I can't make any promises. But I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was worthwhile to give it a try.",
        "Brad: Doctor, Carly is the most stubborn, determined woman you will never know.",
        "Dr. Ever: Well, if we can persuade you, Carly -- that strong will of yours can only work in your favor.",
