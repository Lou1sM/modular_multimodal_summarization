        "\r\nJennifer: Hello? Oh, Emily, hi. I was just going to call you actually. Thanks \r\nagain for taking me to your doctor this morning. Well, yeah -- it really meant a \r\nlot to me. [Knock at the door] I do feel a little bit different actually. I'm \r\nnot so used to having so many secrets. Um -- I have to go. But thanks again, \r\nEmily. You were really there for me. Bye.",
        "\r\nBilly: Hi. I just wanted to say some things.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Okay.",
        "\r\nBilly: First of all, how're you doing?",
        "\r\nJennifer: All right.",
        "\r\nBilly: Good, good. So, you know Bryant came in after you left the cottage.",
        "\r\nJennifer: You guys talk?",
        "\r\nBilly: Nah, he just, you know, wanted to blow off some steam. So we raced each \r\nother across the lake.",
        "\r\nJennifer: That must have been chilly.",
        "\r\nBilly: Yeah, I just kept thinking, I wish I would have been in all that cold \r\nwater a couple hours before. But anyway -- but we're out there treading water in \r\nthe dark and being best friends. And he told me how he never wanted to give up \r\non you. But I already knew that. I mean, he loves you",
        "\r\nJennifer: I'm not sure he knows what \"loving me\" means right now.",
        "\r\nBilly: Yeah, but I'm not too sure about a lot of things myself. But you know \r\nwhat, Jen? There's one thing I do know, that what happened with you and me, \r\ndon't let it get in the way of you and Bryant. I mean, now that you know that he \r\nfeels the same way and that he wants you back, why don't you think about living \r\nwith him again? I mean, wouldn't it be the best for everybody? [Painful \r\nsighing]",

        "\r\nJake: Tell me all about how you hurt your foot.",
        "\r\nBonnie: It was crushed by a large clown. So if you want a drink, you'll have to \r\nask someone else. I'm on break.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Jake! My man! What's going on? I see you've met Bonnie. She will be \r\nworking tonight's festivities.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Can't you see I'm injured? Some drunk in this mosh pit broke my foot \r\nlast night.",
        "\r\nIsaac: You stubbed your toe, and I saw it. Okay, but you know what? If you want, \r\nwe can go to the hospital. We can get the emergency room. My brother Ben would \r\nbe glad to get some x-rays and we could check it out. Well, look at that! She \r\ncan walk! That's amazing!",
        "\r\nBonnie: I'll consult my private physician.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Yeah, you do that. And these are the logos for the club. They're on the \r\nnapkins here. Could you please make sure they face up this time. Thank you.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Tell the groom and his buddies not to push their luck with me tonight.",
        "\r\nJake: I would be the groom, and that's my buddy.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Then consider yourself warned.",
        "\r\nJake: Cute kid. Obnoxious seems to work for her.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Yeah, but not for me. I hired her as a favor to Lisa. Now, you figure out \r\na way to get rid of her, and tonight's festivities are on the house.",
        "\r\nJake: Yeah, after our one-time-only, live-from-Oakdale special event, she might \r\nbe long gone.",
        "\r\nIsaac: I don't think a night of football and cigars would scare her away.",
        "\r\nJake: Football?",
        "\r\nIsaac: Yeah, what you laughing at?",
        "\r\nJake: Football?",

        "\r\nMolly: Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, not only is he living in town, but he's working at \r\nWOAK.",
