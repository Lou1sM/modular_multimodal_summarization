        "Gwen wants to move into the dorms but is at a loss on how to get enough money to do that. Jade manipulates Will into letting her stay with him for a few days. Lucy is sure Dusty is using Johnny not feeling well as an excuse and wants him to simply own up to what the problem is. He tells her he can't be around her anymore. Simon and Carly are having trouble kicking it into gear for their Open House and when Simon won't stop coming onto Carly, she kicks him where it counts. Dusty explains that when he saw her singing all he could see was Jen. It wouldn't be fair to even be friends with her when he still wants his wife back. Lucy pleads for them to stay friends, but Dusty can't do it and walks away leaving a sobbing Lucy behind; Lucinda shows up and Lucy rushes into her arms. Maddie comes to stay at Tom and Margo's and suddenly Casey doesn't want to leave, but soon they are all heading off to move Casey into his dorm room. Kim learns Gwen moved out and Jade is staying \u0096 temporarily \u0096 with Will because she is pregnant with his child. Jade listens to their conversation and when Kim leaves Jade rushes to hug him to thank him for not blaming her for the pregnancy. Carly doesn't think Simon is taking her seriously so she goes to leave but Gwen has come to see her and Simon uses this to make Carly stay. Gwen wants her to know she is enrolled in college but is trying to find a way to live in the dorms. Simon listens and explains she can get a scholarship through him; Gwen and Carly are skeptical. Simon asks one question of her and after she answers it, Simon writes her a check. Carly suggests Gwen cash it soon. Carly is moved by Simon's generosity. Lucy tells Lucinda Dusty doesn't want to be with her anymore. Lucinda thinks it may be that Lucy has awakened some past feelings he had for her and it feels like a betrayal to Jen. She advises her to give him time. Dusty asks Lucinda if he can go to New York to close a deal; Lucy fears Dusty is running away from her and voices her anger at Lucinda for pushing her to admit her feelings for him. Maddie and Casey get close as he is moving into his dorm and as they joke about how dorky his roommate might be, but then Maddie freezes. Casey promises he is in no rush because he loves her. Gwen is Casey's new neighbor in the dorm. Will doesn't want Jade to get the wrong idea about them; he is doing this for her because of what Gwen went through with Casey. The only thing they are going to share is becoming parents; he doesn't love or and he never will!"

        "Gwen: Do you think I could get an advance on my salary from Crash?",
        "Casey: Oh, it's freezing! Do you want some coffee?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'll get it. So what do you think? Do you think that your grandma would go for something like that?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I mean, she'd want to help you out. I mean, how much is room and board at Oakdale U anyway?",
        "Gwen: Here.",
        "Casey: Ouch! I thought it was supposed to be cheaper at in-state schools.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, not necessarily. If you live on campus, it can be just as bad as out-of-state schools.",
        "Casey: Well, you're not going to be able to get an advance that big. You'd be working it off forever.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but it'd be worth it. I mean, I'd have my own place.",
        "Casey: A very small room with a roommate.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but once I have it, I won't have to worry about rent or utilities or buying food.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you're still gonna need the money you're making at Crash to pay for stuff like -- I don't know, books, your clothes -- geez! Gloves? Man, I'm turning up the heat.",
        "Gwen: I'm gonna stop by the financial aid office tomorrow, see if there's a grant or a scholarship or something.",
        "Casey: For this year? I mean, they're probably already taken. You know, there's an easier answer.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm not --",
        "Casey: At least think about it.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm doing this on my own.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you need money to do that. And you guys are --",
        "Gwen: I'm not taking money from Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You want to move in with me?",
        "Jade: Well, not permanently. I just need a place to stay for one day or maybe two. I mean, losing my job and my place both in one day -- it's just kind of got me freaked out.",
        "Will: But staying at my place is --",
        "Jade: Oh, if Gwen came back, it would be kind of awkward.",
        "Will: No, Gwen's not coming back. But don't worry, we'll find you a place. Jade, are you okay? Jade? Jade, why don't you come back inside and sit down?",
        "Jade: Oh, God, no! The food and the smell --",
        "Will: Well, it's freezing out here.",
        "Jade: I kinda like the cold. It helps me get past that I'm-about-to-hurl feeling.",
        "Will: All right, well, what do you need? Can I get you, like, a soda or some tea or something?",
        "Jade: No, I need my own bathroom. I need a bed! You don't know how it is, Will. Being pregnant is so random. It's not like I get morning sickness just in the morning and it's over. I can be sick any time. And then I'm exhausted. And emotionally, I'm just all over the place. Like right now. If I was thinking straight, I would not be laying all this on you.",
        "Will: Well, it's my baby, too.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but I decided to keep it. So don't worry about me. I'm gonna figure something out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Let's just leave it alone.",
        "Lucy: I will, as soon as you tell me what's really wrong.",
        "Dusty: I just told you.",
        "Lucy: Johnny is not sick. I just saw him. He wasn't even flushed.",
        "Dusty: I know when my kid's not feeling well.",
        "Lucy: Well, if he really were sick, you wouldn't be pushing me away. You'd be asking me -- a doctor -- to look at him. I thought you had more guts than this.",
        "Dusty: What was that?",
        "Lucy: Blaming this 180 on a defenseless kid when it's really about me. If you don't want to be with me, just say so.",
        "Dusty: Okay. I don't want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Carly, you know, I've been thinking -- maybe we have bitten off more than we can chew. You know any painters or carpenters willing to work on a deferred payment schedule?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you and me. Now, get a paintbrush!",
        "Simon: Maybe I can find another investor.",
        "Carly: Tonight? And get enough money so we can hire people to finish this place for the brokers by tomorrow?",
        "Simon: Oh, you know what I can do when I put my mind to it?",
        "Carly: Simon, if we don't get people very interested in this building, the bank will foreclose, and you will lose everything you put into it.",
        "Simon: I'll get a paintbrush.",
        "Carly: All right. Hey, why don't you take the trash out first? Just in case one of those brokers comes by tonight, I don't want the place smelling like pizza and beer.",
        "Simon: All right, Ma'am. Taking out the trash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Radio announcer: An unprecedented early ice storm has hit in Oakdale, where the governor has declared a state of emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Simon: Oh, just remembering my other incentive for getting this place into shape.",
        "Carly: Well, forget it. We made a deal and we're sticking to it. Now, after the apartment sells --",
        "Simon: I get to have my way with you. Then again, why wait?",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no. Come on, now. Stop. You stay focused. Seducing me is not going to get paint on these walls, is it? Seducing me is not going to get knobs on the doors.",
        "Simon: But seducing you is going to make me so happy.",
        "Carly: You know what would make me so happy?",
        "Simon: I'm all ears.",
        "Carly: Apartment sales. Money in the bank.",
        "Simon: All right, fine.",
        "Carly: Oh, I want to get this drop cloth over the sofa so we don't splatter on it.",
        "Simon: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Can you help me, please?",
        "Simon: Absolutely. [Carly screams] I'm really sorry. I just had to do that.",
        "Carly: Yeah. That goes double for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Sorry.",
        "Lucy: Don't apologize. You know, I asked you for the truth, and you gave it to me, right between the eyes.",
        "Dusty: There's more to it.",
        "Lucy: Oh, a longer, more detailed rejection? No, thank you.",
        "Dusty: It was the karaoke.",
        "Lucy: Dumped due to karaoke. That's got to be a first.",
        "Dusty: Well, I came in here, I saw you up there -- and I saw Jennifer. Some time, we were in Florida, goofing around -- I looked up there, I saw you, I saw Jen.",
        "Lucy: Right, I mean, that's going to happen. It's only natural. When you see a woman that walks like her, or hear a laugh that reminds you of hers --",
        "Dusty: She's still my wife.",
        "Lucy: And I'm still your friend. Where's the conflict?",
        "Dusty: I just can't do it.",
        "Lucy: Can't hang out with me? Can't have drinks with me? Or go to the movies?",
        "Dusty: I can't be half there. I can't be with you, and want my wife back. I won't do it. You deserve better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Here. I asked her not to make the tea too strong. And don't worry, it's decaffeinated. I brought you some crackers.",
        "Jade: Thanks. You're watching me.",
        "Will: Well, I'm worried about you. And the baby. I think maybe I should get you a room at the Lakeview.",
        "Jade: No, no, no, that is too expensive. And to tell you the truth --",
        "Will: What?",
        "Jade: I'm scared to be alone. I've never been pregnant before. And what if something happens to me and I'm all by myself? You know, this sounds hormonal, even to me. Look, there's a bed and breakfast five blocks away. It's cheap. It's clean. And if you could afford to put me up there for a couple of nights, I can find a new job and I can pay you back as soon as I can.",
        "Will: Come on.",
        "Jade: I can walk. It's only a couple of blocks.",
        "Will: No, I changed my mind. Right now, the best place for you is with me.",
        "Jade: Really?",
        "Will: Yeah, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So you'll find the money some other way. You'll discover some long-lost rich relative, or find out about a special grant that hasn't been given out yet.",
        "Gwen: Yes, for music majors whose last name begins with the letter \"M.\" Or \"N.\" I think I'm gonna change my last name back to Norbeck. You know, that way, at least, you know, it'll be like we never even got married.",
        "Casey: No, it won't. Gwen, when you love someone like I love Maddie, I mean, it changes you. Whether you're with them or not, loving them makes you different.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I know. I don't like it.",
        "Casey: Any time you want to hang out, just stop by the room or call me.",
        "Gwen: You actually have to get going. You're going to move into the dorms tonight, yeah?",
        "Casey: No, I mean, I already packed. Where are you going?",
        "Gwen: I'm going to Carly's. I'm going to tell her that I enrolled in school, see if there are any rich relatives that I really don't know about.",
        "Casey: You'll find the money.",
        "Gwen: You know what, if anything -- oh, freezing -- I'll end up staying with Carly. It could be worse. I could, you know, end up out here with nowhere to go.",
        "Casey: Yeah. So, I guess the next time I see you will be in intro to music theory.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. It's weird. I can't believe we're going to college.",
        "Casey: It's crazy.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'll see you there.",
        "Margo: Casey!",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Margo: What are you still doing here?",
        "Casey: I got hung up. But I'm headed out now. Maddie, what are you doing here?",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Tom: She's moving in, remember?",
        "Casey: But I'm moving out today.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I thought the whole idea is that you get to the dorm first so that you beat out your roommate for the best bunk.",
        "Casey: No, that can wait.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you don't have to change your plans for me.",
        "Casey: No, it'll be fine. I'll just stick around, stay for dinner, help you get settled in. I can go to the dorm rooms whenever.",
        "Margo: I think I heard Tom calling me.",
        "Maddie: I didn't hear anything.",
        "Margo: I didn't, either.",
        "Casey: Why didn't you tell me you were moving in today?",
        "Maddie: Well, Henry's going to be out late. And I didn't want to be alone.",
        "Margo: So we moved up the move-in date.",
        "Maddie: He's going to bring over my stuff tomorrow.",
        "Casey: That's great.",
        "Maddie: But you know what? You should go. You know, if you show up there and your roommate took the good bed and desk and closet, you're gonna be miserable, so --",
        "Casey: But I want to spend time with you while I can.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know. We'll see each other. I'll come over sometime next week, maybe. We'll hang out.",
        "Casey: Why not tonight?",
        "Maddie: Tonight?",
        "Casey: Yeah, tonight. Like, you could come over. It'd be me and you in my brand new room.",
        "Margo: And me and Dad. I mean, we wouldn't want to miss out on where you're going to spending your first year of college. This is a big moment for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You're amazing.",
        "Will: Jade, it's a fire. Anybody can get one going. It's not that big of a deal.",
        "Jade: No, I meant the way that you take care of me. Most guys would -- I guess you took care of Gwen when she was pregnant.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Jade: Now it's actually yours.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Jade: You know what I worry about sometimes? That something will happen to our baby -- like with Gwen. That I won't take care of myself enough, and --",
        "Will: Well, Gwen was living alone and she had no money.",
        "Jade: Like me.",
        "Will: But you're going to have all the things you need. You're going to take prenatal vitamins. And you're going to get check-ups. And maybe Uncle Bob can set you up with a doctor at Memorial.",
        "Jade: Is that where Gwen went?",
        "Will: That was that, and this is this.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, I'd rather stick with the doctor at the free clinic.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Jade: Because I might as well get used to taking care of things on my own.",
        "Will: But you're not going to be on your own.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Jade: Is that your mom? Because I cannot take getting yelled at by Barbara Ryan right now.",
        "Will: My mom's out of town. Who is it?",
        "Kim: It's Aunt Kim. It's very chilly out here.",
        "Jade: You know what? I'm gonna go.",
        "Will: Just a sec.",
        "Jade: Nobody needs to know that I'm here right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You still love Jennifer. I understand that. And I'm not trying to push you into anything that makes you uncomfortable.",
        "Dusty: I know.",
        "Lucy: Look, being around each other feels right. You said as much to your mother-in-law. You told Barbara you wanted to be my friend.",
        "Dusty: I know what I said.",
        "Lucy: I like being friends, Dusty. I don't want anything more.",
        "Dusty: Even being friends -- I can't -- I can't with any woman. It just feels like too much.",
        "Lucy: You would feel this way about any woman?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Any woman, or just Craig Montgomery's daughter?",
        "Dusty: Whatever. I just can't do it. Sorry.",
        "[Lucy sobbing]",
        "Lucinda: Honey -- Darling -- oh, Honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We agreed to be hands-off until this apartment is finished.",
        "Simon: Well, I really -- I don't have to use my hands.",
        "Carly: Oh! Stop it! You know that I have a couple more moves. One of which could render parts of your anatomy completely useless for a very long time -- maybe months.",
        "Simon: Months? What are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm only joking around.",
        "Carly: How can I work with you when you won't take me seriously?",
        "Simon: Well, how can I work with you when all I think about is how seriously attracted to you I am? Whoa, whoa, wait. Why are you so uptight about this? I mean, you're free, you're single.",
        "Carly: I may be single. But I have three children, so I'm far from free. You've got no one else to take care of but yourself, so maybe that gets you off the hook when it comes to how much cash you have at hand. But for me, it's the difference about whether my children eat or not!",
        "Simon: Look, Jack gives you some child support. That's being a little dramatic.",
        "Carly: And you are being selfish.",
        "Simon: That's true.",
        "Carly: You know, it may be worth it for you to watch our dreams go up in smoke for a roll in the hay. Well, it's not worth it for me.",
        "Simon: I'm not giving up on anything. I'm just taking a small break, that's all.",
        "Carly: Simon, if you cared about this project at all -- if you cared about me at all -- just forget it, get out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Simon: It just so happens that I have a scholarship that you might be just right for.",
        "Casey: It's not going to be my roommate that makes me run home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: No. You're not going to go. I'm going to paint, I'm going to hammer, I'm going to wallpaper -- I'll even hang curtains. I may have to duck out for the occasional cold shower, but I will not make any more moves on you until we are done.",
        "Carly: Get out of the way, Simon. Get! Gwen --",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Sorry, are you on your way out? I really need to talk to you.",
        "Simon: Gwen, come on in. Don't be rude, Carly. Invite your sister in. You are freezing.",
        "Gwen: It's very cold outside.",
        "Simon: Well, I was about to start work, so if you two need a little privacy, I will --",
        "Gwen: No, its fine, I don't mind. You know, I don't want to interrupt your work.",
        "Simon: All right, then. I'll just be -- don't mind me.",
        "Carly: So, what's up?",
        "Gwen: Well, I decided to go ahead and apply for college.",
        "Carly: That's great! Oh, I'm really happy to hear that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Carly: And you know that you can stay with me, so you don't have to worry about any of that.",
        "Gwen: Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings -- I don't think I'm going to, but --",
        "Carly: What? No, you probably won't. What is it?",
        "Gwen: Well, I kind of want to be on my own, you know, with kids my own age. So I applied for on-campus housing.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's okay. That's a great idea. But can you afford that?",
        "Gwen: I'm working on it right now.",
        "Carly: Oh -- well, what about your trust fund husband?",
        "Gwen: Well, do you take money from Jack?",
        "Carly: That's different.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it is. You've been married to Jack a lot longer than I've been married to Will. And you don't take anything from him, except for the kids. I'm not taking anything from Will.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I wish I could help you. But I don't have anything, and I won't until this apartment is finished and sold --",
        "Gwen: No, it's fine. I'm going to work something out. I still have my job at Crash. I can apply for another loan. It's too late for a grant or a scholarship, but --",
        "Simon: Or maybe it's not.",
        "Carly: Just stay out of this, Simon, please?",
        "Simon: I'm sorry, Carly, I just couldn't help but overhear. You know, we're in the same room and all that -- but it just so happens that I have a scholarship that you might be just right for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Will: I'm not hiding from this, why should you? I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Come on in.",
        "Kim: Oh, that's all right. It's my fault. I should've called before I came over. Oh, hello.",
        "Will: You remember Jade Taylor, right?",
        "Kim: Well, I can't say we've been formally introduced. Hello, Jade.",
        "Will: Jade, this is my Aunt Kim, Kim Hughes.",
        "Jade: Hi, Mrs. Hughes, nice to meet you.",
        "Kim: Thank you, thank you. You're all bundled up. Are you freezing like the rest of us, or you don't feel well?",
        "Jade: Well, now that you mention it, I think I'm going to go lie down, if that's okay?",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. Just yell if you need anything.",
        "Kim: So, what's going on? Where's Gwenny?",
        "Will: She's gone. She moved out.",
        "Kim: Why?",
        "Will: Jade's pregnant. And it's mine.",
        "Kim: Oh. Are you sure?",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Kim: When did you find out about this?",
        "Will: At the memorial. Jade told me and I told Gwen, and --",
        "Kim: Does your mother know?",
        "Will: No, of course not.",
        "Kim: Oh, of course, of course. She left a message for me saying she was going out of town. She never would've left if she'd had any idea.",
        "Will: She wanted you to come check up on me?",
        "Kim: No. No, actually, that was my idea. Oh, Honey, what can I do to help?",
        "Will: I don't know what I'm doing, Aunt Kim.",
        "Kim: You invited Jade to move in with you?",
        "Will: No, that's just for tonight. And maybe tomorrow, too, I don't know.",
        "Kim: Well, it's probably a fairly good idea to give yourself some time and space so you can figure out what you want to do about this -- I mean, before you tell your mother, or anybody else, as far as that's concerned.",
        "Will: I'm not keeping this a secret from anybody. I slept with Jade and she got pregnant with my baby. So I'm going to do right by her and the child. You know, I'm not going to act like Jade did this to me. 'Cause that's not the way it was.",
        "Kim: I'm so proud of you.",
        "Will: Why?",

        "Lucy: You really think so?",
        "Lucinda: Are you really ready, maybe, to think and listen to all, anything I say? Darling, Dusty loved you so very, very much. You know? But now, perhaps -- I mean, just maybe he's feeling other -- those feelings again. And they feel like a betrayal, that he would have any kind of inkling or suspicion of affection for anyone other than Jennifer. You know? [Cell phone rings] Oh, excuse me, Honey. Oh, it's Dusty. He must be feeling guilty or he wouldn't be calling me. Yes, Dusty.",

        "Simon: Okay. You ready? Question -- why do you want to go to college?",
        "Gwen: Okay. All right, well, I always wanted to go to college. Growing up, I didn't know anyone who went to college. My mom is pretty uneducated, and I knew that I didn't want to be anything like her. So, I believe that -- I do believe that knowledge, when used with humanity, is the most powerful thing that we can have. And I love learning, and the thought of doing what I love for four years -- I can't really think of anything better than that.",

        "Carly: Gwen and I are not alike, you know? You're wrong about that. She knows books and music. And you know what I know? Men. I've used them, scammed them, slept with them, married some of them, left them.",

        "Simon: It's only because I am so singularly attracted to you.",
        "Carly: Well, I like it that you think that way. I just don't want that to be the only thing that you think of me.",
        "Simon: Come on. You know that's not right. I think a lot more.",
        "Carly: Simon, didn't you need that money to pay the suppliers?",
        "Simon: Look, I already owe them so much money already. A few thousand is not going to make a dent. Besides, I can see with Gwen, it made a difference. So, are we still --?",
