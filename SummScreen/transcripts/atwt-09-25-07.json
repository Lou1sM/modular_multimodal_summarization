        "Craig: Hi, you can just put the tray down on the desk, but if you leave the cover on, that would be great. I don't want it to get cold.",
        "Meg: Gee, of all the times I shouldn't have left my waitress uniform at home.",
        "Craig: Meg. I thought you were still at Iva's.",
        "Meg: So, what is all this? I'm gone for a few days, and you trade the farm for room service?",
        "Craig: Well, let's just say, I like to keep a woman guessing.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, when it's your address or your wife, you should be a little more forthcoming.",
        "Craig: Duly noted. Hi.",
        "Meg: So, do you want to tell me why we've moved back into the Lakeview? I thought we were having financial difficulties.",
        "Craig: Well, we were. But my lawyer managed to extradite some assets out of the mess that Paul and Rosanna have created.",
        "Meg: Legally?",
        "Craig: Yes, legally.",
        "Meg: Well, he does work for you, Craig. I mean, you can't blame a girl for asking.",
        "Craig: Meg, I would not do anything that would jeopardize our future. Everything is being handled above board.",
        "Meg: So, Rosanna -- she's aware of everything your lawyer has accomplished?",
        "Craig: Well, I would imagine so.",
        "Meg: So, if she's not fighting it, maybe this means that she's stop blaming you for her accident.",
        "Craig: We both know Rosanna is not the one spearheading this.",
        "Meg: Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: There's so much time to make up for.",
        "Paul: The only thing that stands in our way is Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Ugh. And everything was going so well.",
        "Paul: Oh, stop it, come on. I love you, Rosanna, that's why I proposed. And you want to marry me, that's why you said yes.",
        "Rosanna: You're well aware that I said yes, aren't you? I mean, couldn't we just focus on that and on us? And being happy and just forget about Craig?",
        "Paul: Look, I'd love that. I would like nothing more. But every time I try that, all I can think about is how he took you away from me. And he deserves to suffer for what he's done. Not just for me, but to everybody who missed you. You know what you have to do to make that happen. Rosanna, we agreed.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know what our agreement was. Yes, this is Rosanna Cabot. I'd like to report a crime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, Ladies. Line it up. Right about here. Okay, ready?",
        "All: Mm-hmm!",
        "Katie: One, two, three!",
        "[Brad catches the bouquet]",
        "Parker: Way to go, Uncle Brad!",
        "Vienna: I'm supposed to catch it. It's mine.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Well, hey if anything entitles you to a do-over --",
        "Katie: I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Vienna: No, forget about Brad. Just hand it over to me.",
        "Jack: No, okay, wait, wait. Wait, this isn't right. What do you think you're doing?",
        "Brad: It was an accident. I just came at the wrong time.",
        "Jack: Well, you shouldn't have left in the first place. You've been treating this wedding like it was a joke from the start. And I'm sick of it. And so is everybody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't want anymore tests. No matter what we do, it's not going to change the fact that I'm dying, right?",
        "Dr. Evers: No, it's not.",
        "Carly: So, then there's nothing that we need to do tonight. And I'd like to go home.",
        "Dr. Evers: Look, Carly, if you leave, I can't stop you. But you're doing this against medical advice.",
        "Carly: Well, that's what I do best. Ignore advice.",
        "Dr. Evers: If something happens to you, we can't help you.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm ready here right now and you can't help me, so what's the difference?",
        "Dr. Evers: The difference comes if we succeed in making you more comfortable.",
        "Carly: I know you want to do everything you can. But if nothing can save my life, is there really any point?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's a new low, even for you.",
        "Brad: I had a good reason --",
        "Jack: You absolutely had no reason. Who stands at an altar and answers his cell phone? Probably some bimbo you met at a bar last week. Brad, you were supposed to be standing up for me at my wedding.",
        "Brad: You got married, didn't you? Me not being there didn't change that.",
        "Jack: That's not the point. I wanted you here. But no, you couldn't suck it up long enough to watch me marry Katie.",
        "Brad: This has got nothing to do with Katie.",
        "Jack: It's got everything to do with Katie! She didn't choose you, so you had to act out because you just -- you just -- you couldn't handle it. You didn't get what you wanted.",
        "Brad: Will you listen to me?",
        "Jack: No, I'm not going to listen to you -- I'm going to be on my honeymoon --",
        "Brad: Will you please just listen to me -- just stop talking --",
        "Jack: Whatever you have to say, I really don't care about --",
        "Brad: I wasn't with another woman. I was with Carly.",
        "Jack: Oh, you're pulling out all the stops now, aren't you?",
        "Brad: She's so sick, Man. She's in the hospital and it's serious.",
        "Jack: Man, you are just -- you'll use any excuse, won't you?",
        "Brad: Hey Jack -- Jack. Hey Jack, you know, whatever you think of me, I wouldn't lie about someone being sick. Come on.",
        "Jack: Not even if Carly wanted you to?",
        "Brad: She didn't. Okay, she only called me because she felt like she had no one else to turn to. She made me promise not to say anything so you wouldn't find out.",
        "Jack: Oh! That makes all the sense in the world. Of course she made you promise, 'cause she knows you can't keep a secret. So, it's perfect for her. She gets her little information out there, and she keeps her hands clean.",
        "Brad: No man, it's not like that.",
        "Jack: Then what is it like? Tell me, please. You got my attention now.",
        "Brad: She collapsed in Old Town.",
        "Jack: Like she did before?",
        "Brad: No, not like she did before. The first time, actually, that was real, okay? The second time was worse because when she woke up, she was disoriented, she didn't know who she was. There was a cop there, he recognized her, brought her to the station. Call. Check it out.",
        "Jack: So, she was calling you from the station?",
        "Brad: Yes! So I went there, took her to the hospital, so a doctor could look her over.",
        "Jack: What'd they say?",
        "Brad: Look, Jack, it's not my place --",
        "Jack: What'd they say?",
        "Brad: Look, no -- I'm not going to tell you. You want to know what's going on with her, then you have to ask her yourself.",
        "Jack: Fine. I'll call her. You think they'll let her answer her phone in a hospital room?",
        "Brad: She's been getting these headaches, Man. Really bad. Really bad. And you know, that's what's been causing the fainting spells, that's why she blacked out when she was in the car with Sage.",
        "Jack: She never really did give me a good explanation for what happened that night.",
        "Brad: She couldn't without you -- without letting you know what was going on. She didn't want to put this on you with the wedding so close.",
        "Jack: So why are you telling me this now?",
        "Brad: Because she's refusing treatment. And the doctor says she can't afford to wait.",
        "Jack: She's not listening to the doctors?",
        "Brad: Oh, come on, Man. You know Carly. She thinks she's got everything under control, but she doesn't.",
        "Katie: Ah, Man, I owe Holden 20 bucks. Jack hasn't killed you yet.",
        "Brad: Katie.",
        "Katie: Stop. Mr. Snyder, we have to start our honeymoon. Would you like to go now? What's wrong? What did you say to him?",
        "Jack: No, Brad didn't do anything. We're going to have to take a different flight, I think.",
        "Katie: Why? What happened?",
        "Jack: Carly's sick. She's in the hospital. Brad says it's -- it's serious. And if she's going to be watching the kids, I just want to find out for myself if everything's okay.",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, of course. Jack, I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: What are you apologizing to me for? I should be apologizing to you. This is your wedding day.",
        "Katie: It's okay. You have to figure out what's going on.",
        "Jack: I'll be as fast as I can, okay?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jack: I love you.",
        "Katie: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have missed you so much.",
        "Meg: I kinda missed you too.",
        "Craig: Just \"Kinda?\"",
        "Meg: Don't push it.",
        "Craig: Hey, you know what? Come here. What do you say, will you let me take you to dinner tonight? Okay? Just you, just you and me, a quiet table, a bottle of wine.",
        "Meg: That sounds nice. But are you sure there's nothing you want to get off your chest first?",
        "Craig: Everything, everyone can wait until tomorrow. I just need one perfect evening where I can make love to my beautiful wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: No second thoughts that this could possibly be a big mistake?",
        "Paul: What? Getting married? No.",
        "Rosanna: No. Going after Craig. I mean -- what if this just opens all these old wounds and history?",
        "Paul: If Craig has old wounds, he can show them to the prison doctor. Rosanna -- when you were in a coma, lying in a hospital bed, he didn't give a damn about you. You know why? Because he was here in this house, your house, spending your money.",
        "Rosanna: And marrying Meg.",
        "Paul: Meg's got nothing to do with it. I love you. I have wanted this. These moments -- I've wanted them for so long.",
        "Rosanna: I just -- I just don't want to lose us in the pursuit of Craig.",
        "Paul: We won't. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. I just want us to be married so that none of that -- none of that stuff touches us.",
        "Rosanna: I just wish I had the same conviction as you do that this is the right thing to do.",
        "Paul: It is! Look, we're doing this for us. We're doing this for Jennifer. We're doing this for Johnny.",
        "Rosanna: Well that -- that's right. That's right. You're right.",
        "Paul: Great. So, then a toast. To Craig Montgomery finally getting what's coming to him.",
        "Rosanna: To us. To our happiness. May we never forget the price we paid to get it.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Jack told me what's going on. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: It's okay.",
        "Holden: He doesn't want the kids to know until he has a chance to talk to Carly or a doctor. So I'm going to take them for a hayride, or something. And if you hear anything, call me. Let me know.",
        "Katie: Thank you. How bad is it?",
        "Brad: What? You're not going to call me a liar or accuse me of being part of some massive conspiracy?",
        "Katie: No. I know this is real.",
        "Brad: What gave it away?",
        "Katie: The look on your face right now. You're scared.",
        "Brad: Katie.",
        "Katie: How bad is it, Brad?",
        "Brad: It's pretty bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack -- what are you doing here?",
        "Jack: It's my turn to ask the questions now. Are you her doctor?",
        "Dr. Evers: And you would be?",
        "Carly: He's my ex-husband.",
        "Jack: So, what's going on here?",
        "Dr. Evers: I'm sorry. I can't talk about Carly's case without her consent. [Pager beeps] I'm sorry. I gotta go. Listen, I'll be back. Hopefully, you'll have a better chance of getting through to her than the other guy did.",
        "Jack: That other guy -- he's talking about Brad, isn't he?",
        "Carly: Oh, damn him. He wasn't supposed to say anything.",
        "Jack: I really didn't give him much of a choice, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't care. He promised me. Jack, I didn't want this.",
        "Jack: He said you're sick, and that you're refusing treatment.",
        "Carly: The treatment would be a waste of time.",
        "Jack: Why? Carly -- why would the treatment be a waste of time?",
        "Carly: Because I'm dying, Jack. There's nothing anybody can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey, Officer Griffin. Nice to see you out and about tonight.",
        "Dallas: This isn't a social call.",
        "Craig: Oh well, don't let us get in the way of you doing your official business. Our table is waiting.",
        "Dallas: Unfortunately, you are my business. I have a warrant for your arrest.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: That's ridiculous.",
        "Meg: Unbelievable. Why can't you leave us alone? I mean, seriously. Trumping up more charges out of some sick need for revenge?",
        "Paul: This isn't about revenge. This is about justice.",
        "Meg: You know, I'm getting really sick and tired of telling you this, but Craig is not responsible for Rosanna's accident.",
        "Rosanna: He's gotten very good at telling that story, hasn't he?",
        "Meg: It's not a story. He swore to me it was the truth.",
        "Rosanna: Trust me, Sweetie. Its lies. The man does nothing but lie. He lies with every breath. I'm sure he's told you one about how much in love with you he is, and how you're the only one to ever really truly believe in him. That's one of his favorites. Sadly, Craig's lies aren't enough to save him now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry, can I ask you a favor?",
        "Henry: Bubbles, today you can ask me for anything.",
        "Katie: I just talked to the airline. I told them that we would be postponing our honeymoon.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: It's okay. It is still my wedding night. So I would like to spend it with my husband, whether it's in a hospital or not.",
        "Henry: That's a healthy attitude.",
        "Katie: Yes, it is.",
        "Henry: And you have cake.",
        "Katie: And I have cake.",
        "Henry: Aha!",
        "Katie: So, I was wondering if you would take me to the hospital?",
        "Henry: Oh, of course.",
        "Katie: I think I should just be there for Jack right now. Maybe I can make things a little easier for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg, its okay.",
        "Meg: No, it's not okay. This is harassment.",
        "Craig: Let them say what they want. I can't be charged for the same crime twice.",
        "Paul: Then it's a good thing there are new charges.",
        "Meg: What are you talking about?",
        "Dallas: The charges against Mr. Montgomery have nothing to do with Ms. Cabot's accident.",
        "Meg: So they're making things up now?",
        "Paul: No. Your new husband is being charged with kidnapping and fraud. He switched Jennifer's baby with Gwen's baby the day they were both born, and Rosanna can prove it.",
        "Craig: You are making a big mistake, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Funny, I thought you'd be proclaiming your innocence, rather than making threats.",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: That's the two-minute warning, so you can kiss your husband goodbye.",
        "Meg: Nobody here is blameless for what happened to Johnny. You and I -- we're just as guilty for keeping that little boy away from Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Well if you'd like, I can have them look into adjoining cells for you two.",
        "Meg: This is all because you couldn't get Craig for Rosanna's accident, isn't it?",
        "Paul: \"Accident?\" Rosanna finally figured out what Craig had done and look what happened to her. The very same night. You really think that was an accident?",
        "Craig: Meg? It's okay. It's all fine. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Paul: Everything's going to be fine as soon as he's in jail. Officer?",
        "Dallas: I'm sorry, but I have to take you in now.",
        "Craig: I understand.",
        "Paul: Don't forget to read him his rights.",
        "Dallas: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're not dying, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Jack: No. This is crazy. I mean what -- who is this doctor? What do you know about him?",
        "Carly: Dr. Evers is a neurologist. He knows what he's doing. They've run a lot of tests.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen to me. These blackouts that you're having, fainting spells, whatever you want to call them, they're not fatal. All right? And if you're turning down treatment, obviously there is a way to fix the problem. So why don't you let them do that?",
        "Carly: The treatment -- is just to make me more comfortable. There's no cure.",
        "Jack: A cure for what?",
        "Carly: I have a tumor. A lesion on my brain. Because of where it is, they can't operate. It's going to get worse.",
        "Jack: Okay, so, these -- these doctors, they know what it is, and they know where it is, and there's nothing they can do about it? Is that what you're telling me?",
        "Carly: They've already told me what I can expect over the next couple of months.",
        "Jack: Couple of months? Wait, wait, wait a second. Whoa, hold on a second. Are you saying --?",
        "Carly: That's how long they're giving me.",
        "Jack: No -- no, this isn't -- this isn't happening. I'm not going to let you die, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg, my lawyer is coming down here. Please, please. Don't let Paul and Rosanna's little stunt upset you.",
        "Meg: You know what bothers me the most about all this, Craig? You didn't seem surprised.",
        "Craig: I've been arrested before.",
        "Meg: No, I mean when you knew what the charges were. You always knew this would be a possibility after you had your little talk with Rosanna, didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Meg: So, she knew you switched the babies?",
        "Craig: Look I -- I don't know what Rosanna knew, or what Paul's told Rosanna she's supposed to know. I mean, come on. The woman's credibility is minimal at best.",
        "Meg: That's not what I'm asking you.",
        "Craig: There is no evidence to back up any claim that I did this. No one can prove that this wasn't a mistake made by the hospital.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop! Stop spinning theories at me. Did Rosanna know?",
        "Craig: Why does that matter?",
        "Meg: I'll tell you why it matters, Craig. Because if Rosanna figured it out the night of her accident, then maybe you did run her off that road on purpose, to cover up the truth.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay. So you're not asking me whether or not I switched the babies, you're still wondering whether or not I was responsible for her accident.",
        "Meg: Are you?",
        "Craig: I have told you what happened that night, 1,000 times and my story has never changed once, because it's the truth. Now, you can either believe them, or you can believe me.",
        "Dallas: Meg, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.",
        "Meg: Fine.",
        "Craig: Meg -- Meg -- Meg. Please. Just -- please. Just go home. Just wait for me. I will straighten this out and be home as soon as I can, and then we will talk. I promise. Meg! I love you.",

        "Brad: Well, hey there, Kinfolk. How was the hayride?",
        "J.J.: Oh, it ruled! We went out in the woods and stuff. And Faith got all scared.",
        "Faith: I was not! Parker, tell him!",
        "Parker: You were, maybe, a little scared. So where's do you go anyway? I mean, you bailed in the middle of the ceremony.",
        "Holden: Ah, you know what? It's getting kinda late. We should probably get going. Where's your stuff?",
        "Faith: I put it in the car.",
        "Holden: All right. Let's go. Brad, keep me posted.",
        "Brad: Will do.",
        "J.J.: You know, I'm going to go upstairs and play some videogames.",
        "Brad: Good night.",
        "Sage: Night.",
        "Brad: So you got big plans tonight, my man?",
        "Parker: Not really. I should probably head up. Why is Jack's bag here?",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Parker: Well I mean, he and Katie were supposed to leave for their honeymoon right after the wedding. But they didn't, did they? How come?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You should have told me. I could've --",
        "Carly: Could've what? There's nothing you can do.",
        "Jack: Still --",
        "Carly: I didn't know how to say it without sounding like --",
        "Jack: Like what?",
        "Carly: Like it was another trick to get attention.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't have thought that. Okay, maybe I would have thought it at first, but can you blame me? Carly there are doctors, and tests and results and -- eventually, I would have had to believe you.",
        "Carly: And then I would have had to believe it myself. I wasn't ready to do that. I don't know that I am now.",
        "Jack: You're doing just fine. I don't know how you are, but you are.",
        "Carly: If it could just stop here, with telling you. But somehow -- somehow, I have to tell the kids.",
        "Jack: No -- hey, hey, hey. We'll tell the kids, okay?",
        "[Carly cries]",
        "Carly: Oh, God. God, it's so hard.",
        "Jack: I know. I know it is.",
        "Carly: I was so stupid before, Jack. I left, and I came back, and I thought its okay now. I can make it up to them. I won't have that chance now, will I?",
        "Jack: You don't have to. 'Cause they forgave you a long time ago. Believe me.",
        "Carly: I ask them questions, so many questions, and they roll their eyes. They don't understand. It's so that I can know everything. So that I can know every detail. Every single fact, so that, in my mind, it will seem like I was never gone. But I was. And for what? Oh my God. Oh God, for what? I get it. I get it now. That time -- it's gone. And I can never get it back. I just want more time with them, Jack. I need more time to watch them grow. More time to be their mom.",

        "Katie: You know. Jack is just, you know, he's -- taking care of Carly, she's very upset. Obviously.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Ah, I don't know exactly how to put this. The nurse -- Monica. She likes to play five card stud on her nights off and we've had some quality time together. And I get the impression that Carly is not good.",
        "Katie: No. No she's not. Oh, God. Poor Carly.",
        "Henry: Yeah, poor Carly. But Sweetheart, you just married Jack. Carly's going to be a much bigger part of your life, and I'm not just talking about the kids, you know what I mean?",
        "Katie: Oh, God. Oh God, Henry the kids don't even know she's sick yet. How are they going to handle this?",
        "Henry: So, what about you? How are you going to handle it?",
        "Katie: With Jack. We're married now, you know. That's what you do. You go through the hard times together. We should go.",

        "Carly: Jack, all the doctors say the same thing. I have to accept it. You have to let me --",
        "Jack: No. No, what you need to do is fight.",
        "Carly: Jack. Jack, you did it. You and Katie -- you're married. Get out of here. Now.",

        "Brad: Parker, you know what? I'm not going to lie to you. All right? Today was really tough on your mom. You know how she feels about Jack.",
        "Parker: She loves him. And a lot. And she was trying to hide it, but she felt really bad about them getting married.",
        "Brad: I want you to know something about your mother, okay? And don't ever forget this -- she's one tough lady. She pushes through. She'll be okay. You'll see.",

        "Meg: I picked the lock. What do you think? I used to live here, some of the staff actually liked me.",
        "Paul: Rosanna's in bed and I was just about to join her. So say good night, Meg.",
        "Meg: Not until I hear from Rosanna exactly what happened the night of the accident.",
        "Paul: Craig already told you what happened the night of the accident. That's what you've been telling everybody.",
        "Meg: And now I want to hear Rosanna's side of it. I already know Craig's.",
        "Paul: Rosanna's side is very simple. He tried to kill her. There were two cars and a dark road and a ditch. And he almost pulled it off.",
        "Meg: Why would Craig try and kill his wife?",
        "Paul: You mean, because he's so nice to his new wife? Craig tried to kill Rosanna because Rosanna was going to tell the world that Craig switched the babies. And Rosanna is not like us. She couldn't keep a mother from her baby. Not for a minute, not ever for a second.",
        "Meg: Coming here was a mistake.",
        "Paul: What Craig did was cold and calculated. And if he told you anything other than that, he lied.",

        "Paul: Is that what you say to him? Do you? Do you let him touch you the way you used to let me touch you?",

        "Carly: No, you won't. You absolutely won't!",
        "Jack: Well unfortunately, it's not your decision to make! I told you I wasn't going to let you go through this alone and I meant it.",

        "Rosanna: Get out of my house!",

        "Craig: No, please don't call the police. The police are the ones who let me go. That's what they do when you make bail.",
