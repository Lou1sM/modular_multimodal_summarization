        "Audrey: Finally!",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah. I got here as fast as I could.",
        "Audrey: Where have you been?",
        "Henry: Just a little shopping, if you must know.",
        "Audrey: Oh, shopping? Really? What did you get? What did you get? Let's see it.",
        "Henry: It's something personal, Mother, okay?",
        "Audrey: Personal, huh?",
        "Henry: Look. Vienna told me that she would give me a night that I would never forget since she thinks that I am giving James' money to a real charity, and -- why am I telling you this?",
        "Audrey: Son, I think Vienna will absolutely love the bullfrog.",
        "Henry: How do you know about the bullfrog?",
        "Audrey: Never you mind. It's not important right now. What's important is we have something else to discuss. Guess what came today? The first installment. The payment from James' estate.",
        "Henry: Let me see that.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Listen, all you have to do is sign it over to Children of Adversity, and then Ralph will reinvest it into Metro, and then voila! The money will all come to us!",
        "Henry: Come to me, Mother. Come to me. Holy moly. That's a lot of zeros.",
        "Audrey: Come on. You want to count them together?",
        "Henry: No, I do not want to do that. I just -- let me sign this over to Ralph before I change my mind!",
        "Audrey: Okay. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.",
        "Barbara: I wouldn't get too comfortable with your newfound wealth if I were you.",
        "Audrey: And why wouldn't we? James did leave it all to us.",
        "Henry: To me, Mother. To me.",
        "Barbara: Come, now. We all know that James had no intention of either of you having any of it.",
        "Audrey: You just keep saying that over and over again. Nothing is going to change.",
        "Barbara: Well, we'll just see. Because I plan on contesting the will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ralph: Teri?",
        "Teri: Yeah.",
        "Ralph: What's with the face?",
        "Teri: What face?",
        "Ralph: The face that tells me that something's bothering you.",
        "Teri: I know. I think I'm just really nervous about taking you to see Janet.",
        "Ralph: What are you worried about? You don't think she's gonna be thrilled to see me?",
        "Teri: No. I mean, of course she's gonna be excited to see you. You know how much she loves you.",
        "Ralph: Then what is it?",
        "Teri: Its how she's gonna react to seeing me. I told you, we had that huge blowout, and it ended really bad.",
        "Ralph: And I told you, I am gonna fix everything.",
        "Teri: It's not just something that's as easy as all that.",
        "Ralph: You haven't even told me what all this is about.",
        "Teri: I know. I just think it's probably best if you hear it come from Janet. That's all.",
        "Ralph: Okay, then. Now let's go to your sister's house, and let's get to the bottom of this mess, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You okay?",
        "Liberty: Well, still pregnant, so --",
        "Parker: What are those?",
        "Liberty: Oh, they're just something my mom gave me.",
        "Parker: Can I see them?",
        "Liberty: Sure. They're just from churches and hospitals.",
        "Parker: Why would she give this to you?",
        "Liberty: So that I can read about all my options.",
        "Parker: Your options?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. She wants me to consider all the alternatives before I make my final decision.",
        "Parker: Liberty, two days ago, you were ready to go to Chicago and have an abortion.",
        "Liberty: I know.",
        "Parker: What's going on? I mean, have you changed your mind about what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Hey, you can come in now.",
        "[Janet gasps]",
        "Ralph: Hello, gorgeous!",
        "Janet: Get out! Uncle Ralphy!",
        "Ralph: Oh, give me a big hug, baby!",
        "Janet: Gosh, I can't believe it! Oh, oh! Still as strong as ever!",
        "Ralph: Are you a sight for sore eyes?",
        "Janet: Oh, I have so many questions for you! What are you doing here? You're not sick, are you?",
        "Ralph: Do I look sick?",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Ralph: Okay. Now it's my turn to ask you questions.",
        "Janet: Wait a minute! I only asked you one question!",
        "Ralph: That's okay. If you answer my question, I'm gonna tell you anything you want.",
        "Janet: Oh, you always did drive a hard bargain. All right, go ahead. Shoot.",
        "Ralph: What is this rift that's going on between the two of you? You're family. You should not be fighting. What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hang on one second. Uh, yes. His name is Ralph Manzo.",
        "Craig: What are you doing?",
        "Rosanna: Shh! Shh! M-a-n-z-o. Yes. I just want a simple background check, nothing that's gonna raise any suspicion. Can you do that? Great. Thank you so much. I will be in touch. Okay, bye.",
        "Craig: Why are you running a background check on Ralph Manzo?",
        "Rosanna: Well, why not?",
        "Craig: Because it's unnecessary.",
        "Rosanna: If Henry is going to be bringing random investors into my sister's club, I mean, she's co-owner. I have to know who she's gonna be dealing with when she returns.",
        "Craig: Sure, but I don't think you need to take it this far.",
        "Rosanna: We have no idea who Henry has done business with in the past, nor do we know if he owes anybody any money due to all of his gambling.",
        "Craig: Henry is going to owe anybody any money. He just inherited the Stenbeck fortune.",
        "Rosanna: Well, all the more reason to be careful. We don't know what kind of person that money may attract now. And what's the one big 180? I mean, I thought you were suspicious of the guy.",
        "Craig: Well, that was before I knew he was Teri's Uncle Ralphy. I mean, you heard her vouch for the guy.",
        "Rosanna: And you don't think, perhaps given the family connection, her opinion might be a little bit biased?",
        "Craig: I spoke at length with her about him. There's nothing to worry about.",
        "Rosanna: So, as far as you're concerned, everything's on the up and up.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sorry. I don't agree.",
        "Craig: You're not gonna let this go, are you?",
        "Rosanna: Is that gonna be a problem for you?",
        "Craig: I thought we were on the same page about this.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I'm sorry. You don't expect me to question when a virtual stranger literally walks in off the street and is suddenly an investor in my sister's bar? I thought you'd want to protect Carly's interests, as well.",
        "Craig: I do.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Then we are on the same page, because when things seem too good to be true and there are large amounts of money involved, it's better to be safe than sorry. Need I remind you how I lost all my money? Don't want the same thing to happen to Carly. Nice suit, by the way. Was it expensive?",
        "Craig: Is this about us or Ralph Manzo?",
        "Rosanna: Listen, you asked me for an explanation, and I gave it to you. Should I have phrased my answer differently?",
        "Craig: No, no. I think you've made your point very well.",
        "Rosanna: All right, then. Good. Excellent.",
        "Craig: We're never gonna get past this, are we?",
        "Rosanna: Past what?",
        "Craig: You said it yourself. You're only doing this because of me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I said no such thing.",
        "Craig: I trust Ralph Manzo, and that's reason enough for you not to.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you are being absolutely ridiculous. But thank you for proving my point. I have trusted the wrong person in the past, and I have no intention of making that mistake again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Yeah. It's not as simple as whether or not I've changed my mind or not. My mom, she gave me these brochures. So I have to look at them.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you have to remember that in the end, it's still your decision.",
        "Liberty: You know, when we first got married, my mom totally thought that I was ruining my life. I mean, she kept saying, \"You're too young to be someone's wife.\"",
        "Parker: I remember.",
        "Liberty: How can she not see that me being someone's mom is, like, a million times worse.",
        "Parker: It's gonna be okay.",
        "Liberty: I really wish that I could believe that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm dumping this all on you.",
        "Parker: No, no. Really, I don't care about that. I care about you, Liberty, and I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'm gonna be there for you, okay?",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I cannot forget what she did.",
        "Teri: I know that you don't like the fact that Liberty wanted to have an abortion.",
        "Janet: Oh, my -- do we have to talk about this?",
        "Teri: She was scared and alone, and I was just trying to help.",
        "Janet: But you didn't help, did you? You could have come to me, and you didn't!",
        "Teri: I was trying to support her choice.",
        "Janet: Oh, there's that word again, \"Choice.\" Abortion is not a choice. Tell her, Uncle Ralph.",
        "Ralph: Listen, I don't think anyone is right or wrong in this situation. The problem is, is that you're both missing the point.",
        "Janet: Which is?",
        "Ralph: You both love Liberty. You both love each other. Now, in my business, when you come to a stalemate, you have to find some kind of common ground.",
        "Teri: Common ground?",
        "Ralph: Common ground. And in this situation, it's Liberty. You both want what's best for her. Am I right? So, that's where we start from.",
        "Janet: What do we do first?",
        "Ralph: First, I want to meet this young lady. Second, I want the two of you to cook lunch. And, third, I'm gonna make this into a special occasion.",
        "Janet: Every meal with you is a special occasion!",
        "Ralph: Oh, guilty as charged.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's why I love you so much. I'm gonna call Liberty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie. It's Mom. Can you come home right now, please? There's somebody I want you to meet.",
        "Liberty: It's not another priest, is it?",
        "Janet: Oh, he's definitely not a priest. Just hurry up.",
        "Liberty: Bye. Well, she wants me home. Something's up.",
        "Parker: Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Liberty: You wouldn't mind? 'Cause I have no idea what I'm walking into.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: You can stay bent out of shape and go ahead and contest the will. It's not gonna do you any good.",
        "Barbara: And why is that?",
        "Audrey: Because my son is not keeping any of the money.",
        "Barbara: Really? An attack of conscience?",
        "Henry: Something like that, Barbara. I've decided to give all the money to charity.",
        "Barbara: Is that your new nickname for your mommy?",
        "Audrey: Hey!",
        "Henry: Actually, it's a real charity, thank you very much.",
        "Barbara: Which one?",
        "Audrey: Children of Adversity.",
        "Barbara: Never heard of it.",
        "Audrey: It's new.",
        "Henry: I thought it was the best way to make something good out of all the bad that James did in his life.",
        "Barbara: If you two think I'm going to buy this, you're more stupid than I thought. This is just another ploy to keep the Stenbeck fortune away from my son.",
        "Audrey: Well, you just go ahead and think whatever your little pea brain wants to think.",
        "Barbara: All right. I will look in to your so-called charity, and if I find anything that doesn't jibe, you two are going to be very sorry.",
        "Audrey: Oh, my God!",
        "Henry: Did you have to egg her on like that?",
        "Audrey: Well, oh -- okay, okay. We just cannot let her look in to Ralph's charity.",
        "Henry: I told you, this whole money laundering thing was a bad idea.",
        "Audrey: You just have to stop her.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Audrey: No, no, no. I'm serious.",
        "Henry: You expect me to stop Barbara Ryan? How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Audrey: By any means necessary.",
        "Henry: Uh, let's see. The last time I heard \"By any means necessary,\" you asked me to kill James, and I refused, and we all know how that turned out.",
        "Audrey: Would you stop it? Stop being so dramatic. I do not want you to kill Barbara Ryan.",
        "Henry: What exactly do you expect me to do? Hmm?",
        "Audrey: Distract her.",
        "Henry: Distract her? When she's trying to get James' fortune from us? Mother, I am good, but I'm not that good.",
        "Audrey: Yeah, but you heard her. She said if she finds one teeny, tiny little reason to be suspicious of Ralph's charity, then we're curtains. We're dead. We don't get anything. Nada!",
        "Henry: Which brings us back to the question -- how are we supposed to stop her?",
        "Audrey: Henry.",
        "Henry: Yes?",
        "Audrey: You are so charming and sophisticated and so very handsome. You know how to hold a woman's attention when you need to.",
        "Henry: This is getting weird.",
        "Audrey: Oh, baby, just use what your mama gave you. Use it to make sure Barbara thinks it's a great idea for us to be keeping the money.",
        "Henry: By any means necessary?",
        "Audrey: Yes, yes, yes! Do it! Don't waste any time, because you know what? Barbara's on the war path. Go, go.",
        "Henry: You want me to do it now?",
        "Audrey: Yes, you bet I do! Come on! Eye on the prize! Focus, focus! Victory is ours! Go, go! Don't come back until it is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're looking for problems where there aren't any. That's like when you got it in your head that Teri and I were having an affair!",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no. This is nothing like that.",
        "Craig: I told you you were wrong. You refused to believe me. You could not take me at my word. And what did your paranoia get us? You alerted Janet to the fact that her daughter was about to have an abortion, and that gave her just enough time to get there and stop her.",
        "Rosanna: I cannot believe you are throwing that in my face!",
        "Craig: I know, but the truth hurts, don't it?",
        "Rosanna: Get out!",
        "Craig: No problem. I know better than to try to reason with you when you're on a tear.",
        "Rosanna: And don't let the door hit you in the ego on the way out.",
        "Craig: And one more thing. When your investigation blows up in your face, don't come crying to me. The only thing I'll have to say is, \"I told you so.\"",

        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Janet: Libby, Sweetie, this is your famous Uncle Ralphy.",
        "Liberty: Uncle Ralphy? You never mentioned that you had a brother named Ralph.",
        "Janet: Well, he's not that kind of an uncle.",
        "Ralph: Yeah, but still family, all the same. And who's this nice young fella?",
        "Parker: Oh, Parker Munson-Snyder.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. This is my friend.",
        "Parker: Nice to meet you.",
        "Ralph: Are you the guy that got my niece into trouble? 'Cause if you are, you better set things right for her.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Liberty: You told someone I hadn't even met yet?",
        "Janet: I had to.",
        "Liberty: No, you did not.",
        "Janet: Yes, I did. Liberty, Uncle Ralphy is here to help us figure out the next step.",
        "Liberty: He's not the father. He's just my friend.",
        "Janet: And he's her stepbrother.",

        "Ralph: And cousin?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Not of its blood, so don't worry about it.",

        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Ralph: Come on. I know about the situation that you're in right now.",
        "Liberty: We really don't have to talk about this. Mom --",
        "Janet: Just hear him out, Sweetheart.",
        "Ralph: Listen to me. I'm a family man. First and foremost, there is nothing in this world that's more important to me than family.",
        "Liberty: That seems to be the Ciccone way.",
        "Ralph: I understand you tried to handle this situation on your own.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I was gonna have an abortion.",
        "Janet: But she has wisely decided to consider all of her options.",
        "Ralph: Well, that is a great start. Now, if you have the baby --",
        "Liberty: I can't have a baby. I don't want to be a mom.",
        "Ralph: Listen, you don't have to be a mom, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Liberty: Then what am I supposed to do?",
        "Ralph: You could have the baby adopted.",

        "Craig: Ms. Coleman. I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Audrey: Well, Mr. Montgomery. You know, my son is partner in this fine establishment. So, what's your excuse?",
        "Craig: I was hoping to find someplace I could be alone.",
        "Audrey: You do not look like you should be alone.",
        "Craig: Looks can be deceiving.",
        "Audrey: Oh, come on. Don't be like that. Here. Come here. Sit down. Talk to me. Tell me what's going on. Did you have -- please. A fight with that girlfriend of yours?",
        "Craig: Girlfriend?",
        "Audrey: Yes, that cute little blonde I saw you leave with the other day.",
        "Craig: Oh. Rosanna. Rosanna is not my girlfriend.",
        "Audrey: Oh, but you do have a woman in your life?",
        "Craig: I do. I do, indeed.",
        "Audrey: Huh. In that case, how come I never see the two of you together around anywhere?",
        "Craig: Carly's out of town dealing with some personal matters.",
        "Audrey: Carly, as in my son's partner here, Carly?",
        "Craig: One in the same.",
        "Audrey: Wow. Well, what do you know? Well, no wonder you're tense. You don't have anybody looking out for you right now, taking care of you.",
        "Craig: I can look out for myself just fine, thank you.",
        "Audrey: Wow. You are in a mood.",
        "Craig: I think I'll just be going.",
        "Audrey: No. No, no, no. I know exactly what you need at this point.",
        "Craig: I'm not sure that's the answer.",
        "Audrey: Oh, but it is, you see, because it is 5:00 somewhere. Come on. Don't be an old fuddy duddy. You're not gonna let a lady drink alone, are you? Come on. Ah, I knew chivalry wasn't dead.",

        "Barbara: What are you doing here?",
        "Henry: I think we should talk.",
        "Barbara: I have nothing to say to you. I've made that position quite clear.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but you haven't heard my side of it, and I think if you did, we could work something out.",
        "Barbara: Come in.",
        "Henry: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: Is your lovely mother going to be joining us?",
        "Henry: No. It'll just be the two of us. Audrey tends to rub certain people the wrong way.",
        "Barbara: So you thought you'd be more successful on your own.",
        "Henry: I think we could work out some kind of mutually beneficial resolution.",
        "Barbara: I wouldn't hold your breath.",
        "Henry: Duly noted.",
        "Barbara: Okay, Henry. You have one shot with me. Make it good.",
        "Henry: Let me just ask you one question first, okay?",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Henry: Why are you so against me giving this money to charity?",
        "Barbara: Because I don't believe that your charity is real. In fact --",
        "Henry: What are you doing?",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna call my lawyer. I'm gonna have him look in to your Children of Adversity right now.",
        "Henry: You don't need to call your lawyer. You don't.",
        "Barbara: Afraid he's going to find out that your charitable organization is nothing but a big giant fraud?",
        "Henry: No, no. On the contrary. It is completely legit. It is a charity. It's just that that's not the reason that I'm here.",
        "Barbara: Why are you here, Henry?",
        "Henry: Because, Barbara, more than anything else, I want you on my side.",

        "Henry: Do you really want to saddle Paul with money that will do nothing but remind him of the father that he despised?",
        "Barbara: Paul earned it, unlike you, who met James at the end of his life and just sucked up to him for all you're worth. Or all he's worth, I should say.",
        "Henry: Wait a second. Now, do you think it's healthy for Paul and for you to profit off a man that made your life a living hell?",
        "Barbara: Why not? We lived through worse.",
        "Henry: Barbara, Barbara. James is dead, for good this time, and you don't have to live in his shadow anymore, and isn't that what you wanted? Let me give this money to charity. Let the last act of James Stenbeck stand for something good.",
