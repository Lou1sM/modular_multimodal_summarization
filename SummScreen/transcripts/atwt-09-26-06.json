        "Will dreams of Gwen. Gwen is having trouble getting over Will, even as she starts her new life in the dorms. Mike has a change of heart about being tested; he goes looking for Katie to tell her at the same time she is looking for him to apologize. Emily accuses Meg of following her; Meg calls Paul to say she can't do this anymore, but Paul pleads with her to keep following her. Will and Gwen meet Elwood, who is a dead ringer for Alex, who turns out to be his cousin; Elwood asks Gwen out. Jade prances around in the barest of \u0091clothes' in front of Will. Nancy advises Katie to throw out her thermometer, how to books and calendar and remember she has a husband with feelings involved. Lucinda tries to talk to Dusty about Lucy, but he is not interested and just wants to get out of town to NY. Henry goes to see Maddie at Tom and Margo's, but when Margo is called out because of the weather, Henry lets a lurking Emily in; she is determined to find Daniel's passport because she is leaving town. Gwen borrows Casey's car to buy some stuff for her dorm room. Will suggests Jade go look for a job and gives her money to buy clothes to keep warm; Jade is insulted and knows he wants her gone. Dusty gets stuck on his plane as he tries to fly out to NY. Johnny's babysitter calls the hospital about him having a fever and Lucy takes the call. Margo visits Katie to see if she is ok; Katie is waiting with candles burning for Mike, but admits to her that she is very worried where he is. Meg heads home to check on the Farm as the weather worsens. Henry insinuates to Meg that Emily may run with Daniel, so Meg calls her and threatens to call the police if she doesn't meet her at the Farm. Lucy thinks she needs to get Johnny to the hospital. As Jade is driving, she thanks Will about all the pretty clothes she is now able to buy. Gwen's car veers off the road; Will comes to her rescue."

        "Gwen: Hey, Will. Hey. Wake up, Sleepyhead.",

        "Will: Gwen? Gwen?",
        "Jade: Will, it's me. Jade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Gwen: Hello?",
        "Casey: Hey, Gwen, it's Casey. May I enter with my eyes open?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah. I'm decent.",
        "Casey: It's wicked out there.",
        "Gwen: Still? I almost froze to death last night.",
        "Casey: You know, but today is worse. So I went to the cafeteria earlier and I was looking for you.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm so excited, I can't eat.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, I got you that coffee.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that's great. Thank you.",
        "Casey: So it felt pretty cool. First night, you know, on my own. I thought I'd test out the whole \"stay up as late as you want\" thing, and I made to 11:30. [Gwen laughs] Yeah, it was either that or listen to my roommate talk about his ant farm.",
        "Gwen: Wow. My roommate hasn't even gotten here yet.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, let's hope that she doesn't use those strips -- you know, for snoring?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm. Or a cheerleader who does pom-pom routines all day and all night.",
        "Casey: See, that doesn't sound too bad.",
        "Gwen: Hey, come on, bad boy. So, what's on your agenda for the night?",
        "Casey: I thought that we could go to the campus bookstore.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that sounds -- that sounds fun.",
        "Casey: You sure? You all right?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be all right? This is the life, right? This is what we all wanted.",
        "Gwen: I don't even know how that got in with my stuff.",
        "Casey: I do. Let's face it. Maybe you living in the dorms isn't the life for you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: It's cold outside. It's freezing. Hi, Dear. Have you been out yet today? It's September, but my heavens, it's so inclement.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for the weather report. You can leave the contracts right there. And if don't need anything else --",
        "Lucinda: Well, actually, I'd rather like a cup of something hot. Or barring that, could I have a cup of kindness for my granddaughter?",
        "Dusty: I don't have time for this. I gotta catch a flight.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, New York, with Mr. Yamamoto. But I know why you're in such a rush to get out of town. You're running away from the poor girl, and I think it stinks to high heaven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Has the storm started yet?",
        "Lucy: No, not yet.",
        "Bob: Good day to stay home. Matter of fact, aren't you supposed to be off today?",
        "Lucy: I signed on for an extra shift.",
        "Bob: Well, would that all our interns were that dedicated. I got a call from two who are on vacation saying that they can't get back because of the weather.",
        "Lucy: Well, it's pretty nasty out there.",
        "Bob: Yeah, it sure is. Listen, I'm glad you finally got in. We can always use the extra hands.",
        "Lucy: No problem. It's not like I had other plans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Excuse me. Dr. Chen?",
        "Dr. Chen: Yes?",
        "Mike: I'm Mike Kasnoff. From your office the other day? I was here with my wife, Katie.",
        "Dr. Chen: Yes, of course, Mr. Kasnoff. How can I help you?",
        "Mike: Well, I've changed my mind about the fertility testing. Since it means so much to my wife, I've decided to go through with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Nancy, I can't believe you still showed up with this horrible storm coming. You need a cell phone. I would have called you back to cancel.",
        "Nancy: Don't worry about that. You sounded so upset on the phone, Dear.",
        "Katie: I am beyond upset. I don't even want to say this out loud, but -- my marriage is in big trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: All right, that's it. That's it. If you don't stop following me, I'm calling the cops and I'm having you arrested for stalking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Radio announcer: An unprecedented early ice storm has hit in Oakdale, where the governor has declared a state of emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm stalking you, right.",
        "Emily: Oh, so you're not following me?",
        "Meg: Of course not.",
        "Emily: So that wasn't you pulling up behind me at the cleaners earlier?",
        "Meg: I wear clothes, Emily. And yeah, I spill things. So what am I supposed to do? Stay at home and do my own stain removal so I don't risk running into you at one of the few good dry cleaners in town?",
        "Emily: Okay, what about after that, at Al's? Huh? I was picking up an order, and who was there?",
        "Meg: Coincidence.",
        "Emily: Coincidence, huh? Paul's out of town. He's out of town for real this time, and he's got you shadowing me, doing his dirty work. You know what? I bet you I know how he got you to do it.",
        "Meg: You know what? I'm really not interested in your analysis about my relationship with Paul.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. Paul does one relationship, Meg. Based on his wants, his needs. \"Come on, Meg, do this one thing for me, and I'll give you the moon.\" You know, sometimes I honestly feel sorry for you.",
        "Meg: Save your pity.",
        "Emily: No, really, I mean, it's got to bother you. You're finally in this place with Paul, and everything's okay. And then you find out I'm pregnant, and Paul's all about the baby. And he asks you to hide his happiness, your engagement. I mean, that's got to hurt.",
        "Meg: Well, that was my idea.",
        "Emily: Or he made you belie it was your idea. Like that cute, little plan of pretending that he was out of town. Was that your idea, huh? Until I caught on and I ruined it for the both of you?",
        "Meg: We really weren't trying to hurt you, Emily!",
        "Emily: I know that. I know that now. And honestly, if the situations were reversed, I would probably do the same thing to you in a heartbeat. Only, I would make your life more miserable, Meg. I mean, look at me, I already have. And deep down, I'm sort of sorry about that.",
        "Meg: Emily, do you really mean that?",
        "Emily: No, Meg, that is me lying to you, just like you and Paul lied to me. So tell me, Meg, how does that feel?",
        "Meg: Paul, hey. Call me. I can't do this anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Living in the dorms, I always saw it as this kind of, like, rite of passage, you know?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I mean, it's all we talked about senior year.",
        "Gwen: But even before that. When I was a kid, I used to have these fantasies about what it would be like to go to college and living on campus.",
        "Casey: Keggers, midnight pizza runs.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, meeting kids who came from places I've only seen in the movies.",
        "Casey: Solving the world's problems while sitting in the second floor stairwell.",
        "Gwen: Gaining the freshman 15. That's more of a nightmare than a fantasy, but --",
        "Casey: Yeah. So, are we leaving anything out?",
        "Gwen: Classes?",
        "Casey: Classes, yeah.",
        "Gwen: I mean, kids leave home for college, right? For all kinds of reasons. Not just the keggers or the all-nighters, or even school. But just because it's -- like, it's the next thing that you do. Or to get away from something. Leaving home has always been my dream. Until I found a new one. With Will.",
        "Casey: That's what I mean. Maybe home with him is where you need to be.",
        "Gwen: I cannot go there right now, Casey. I just can't.",
        "Casey: Okay, no, fine. Sorry. If this is what you want, then you'll make it work.",
        "Elwood: Holy guacamole, Dude! Is this foxy lady your girlfriend?",
        "Gwen: Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, you look exactly like this boy that --",
        "Casey: Alex.",
        "Elwood: Oh -- he died, I know. He was my cousin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, are you feeling better? How are you?",
        "Jade: Fine. I am not going to let morning sickness own me. I'm going to stock up soda and crackers, and as soon as I get a job and get a couple of paychecks under my belt I'm going to get out of your way.",
        "Will: Jade, you're not in my way.",
        "Jade: That's nice of you to say. But I know the only reason why you took me in was because I had nowhere else to go. But you gave me and our baby a roof and a bed, and I'm nothing but grateful. Here's your coffee.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Jade: Drink up. Warm your insides. The weather guy said it's gonna get to below 30 tonight. How freaky is that? So, I'm gonna take a hot shower and shake off the chills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I think Katie's getting a little ahead of herself. I mean, we've only been trying to have a baby for a couple months. I'm sure if we let nature take its course, it'll happen.",
        "Dr. Chen: You made that quite clear in my office.",
        "Mike: Well, you're the expert. And Katie has her heart set on getting pregnant. And, you know, since it means so much to her, why don't you go ahead and give me the cup?",
        "Dr. Chen: I beg your pardon?",
        "Mike: The cup? You know, I can go in the room with the magazines and -- you know -- then you can tell me whether or not things seem to be working.",
        "Dr. Chen: Mr. Kasnoff, I'm happy that you and your wife have resolved your differences. See my secretary and you can schedule an appointment for early next week.",
        "Mike: Next week? Why can't we do it now?",
        "Dr. Chen: I'm sorry, I have to go pick up my son. I'll see you next week.",
        "Bob: Hey, Mike. I haven't seen you in long time.",
        "Mike: Hey, Bob.",
        "Bob: What brings you here? You okay?",
        "Mike: Well, yeah. I mean, I'm not sick, if that's what you mean. I'm trying to find Katie.",
        "Bob: Well, my mother said that she was joining Katie for coffee.",
        "Mike: Thank you. And to answer your question, everything's going to be fine.",
        "Bob: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We went to see a fertility expert because I wanted to know why we weren't getting pregnant. And when it came time for Mike to -- you know, do his part -- he freaked out, we got in a huge fight and he left.",
        "Nancy: Oh, Dear.",
        "Katie: Yeah. When I got home, he wouldn't talk to me. When I woke up this morning, he was gone. I've been trying him on his cell, he won't pick up. He wants nothing to do with me.",
        "Nancy: Or he wants everything to do with you, but not in some sterile clinic.",
        "Katie: Well, I just wanted to make sure that nothing was wrong. I mean, we've been trying for a while now.",
        "Nancy: Well, not, in the general scheme of things, too long. And perhaps in trying so hard to get the baby, you've forgotten there's a real man involved, with real feelings.",
        "Katie: Yeah, maybe I have been pushing a little too far.",
        "Nancy: You pushed him right out of your bed.",
        "Katie: Nancy, what am I gonna do?",
        "Nancy: Katie, take all your how-to books, and your calendar and your temperature readers, and throw them in the fire. And snuggle up to it, and make yourself concentrate on absolutely nothing but how much you love your husband and how much he loves you.",
        "Katie: Yeah, you make it sound so simple.",
        "Nancy: Man and woman haven't been simple since Adam and Eve.",
        "Katie: You are right, I do have to make this up to him.",
        "Nancy: Now, go home and apologize to him.",
        "Katie: Okay. You'll be okay? I mean, I don't want to just leave you here.",
        "Nancy: It's all right. I'll sit here and finish my coffee. Now, go! And Katie, be happy.",
        "Katie: Thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know what I would do without you. And cross your fingers, okay? I am going home and I'm apologizing to Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You still here?",
        "Lucinda: Did someone ask me to leave?",
        "Dusty: My mistake.",
        "Lucinda: Your first big mistake, my friend, was running out on Lucy last night.",
        "Dusty: None of your business.",
        "Lucinda: It becomes my business when you use your job with my company Worldwide in order to hurt my granddaughter.",
        "Dusty: But using your granddaughter to help Worldwide, that's cool?",
        "Lucinda: It's killing two birds with one stone. Thrift, Horatio, thrift.",
        "Dusty: You got the contracts?",
        "Lucinda: Do I have the contracts? I spoke with Lucy last night.",
        "Dusty: Mm-hmm. I got that part.",
        "Lucinda: So you know that I know how things are going with you two.",
        "Dusty: Between Lucy and me?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, yes.",
        "Dusty: Listen, if you don't want me to close this deal with Yamamoto, just say so.",
        "Lucinda: I didn't say that. I am just hoping that you are not using this important, important business deal in order to put distance between yourself and a young lady.",
        "Dusty: Come on, let it go.",
        "Lucinda: Or to punish Lucy for who she is.",
        "Dusty: What does that mean?",
        "Lucinda: Look, Lucy can't help it that she's Craig Montgomery's daughter. The genes, the experiences, there's nothing she can do about that. And you know perfectly well, better than anybody in the world that she's as unlike him as can be. She is her own person.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to tell me who Lucy is. Give me the contracts. Or not. Either way, I'm going to New York. And this is the last time we talk about my private life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So you're Alex's cousin?",
        "Elwood: Yeah. His dad and my dad are brothers. But Alex and I didn't see a lot of each other growing up, 'cause I'm from California. So I didn't really know him. What was he like?",
        "Gwen: We didn't actually really know him either. But we were up at Raven Llake.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, it's a terrible thing.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm very sorry.",
        "Elwood: Thanks. So, anyway, I'm Elwood.",
        "Gwen: Oh, hi.",
        "Casey: Oh, yeah, this is Gwen. And she's my friend, not my girlfriend.",
        "Elwood: Oh, Gwen. Is that short for Gwendolyn or Guinevere?",
        "Gwen: Neither, but nice try.",
        "Elwood: Cool. Well, I'm named after my uncle. We used to spend Saturday nights on his crystal radio, trying to contact life on other planets.",
        "Gwen: Oh, cool, did you ever make a direct hit?",
        "Elwood: No. But I'm going to use the astronomy lab just to keep an eye out.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you never what's out there.",
        "Elwood: So, what's your major?",
        "Casey: Excuse me, I'm going to finish unpacking. You two just --",
        "Gwen: It was really nice meeting you, Elwood.",
        "Elwood: Yeah -- well, hey, no hurries, no worries! I mean, classes don't start until tomorrow. All I gotta do today is just buy some ant chow.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I heard about that.",
        "Elwood: Well, since you're not Casey's girl or anything, maybe you'd want to meet the little critters?",
        "Gwen: No, thanks.",
        "Elwood: Or we could watch the skies for ufos? Or we could go out dancing tonight, and I could show you my moves?",
        "Gwen: Listen, Elwood, it's not going to happen. I'm married.",
        "Elwood: Married? Whoa. I've never been with a married chick before.",
        "Gwen: Casey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I used your shampoo, I hope you don't mind.",
        "Will: No problem.",
        "Jade: Can you see the bump? Will, can you tell I'm pregnant?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Jade: Oh -- well, some women take a while to show. Can I use your laptop?",
        "Will: Yep, sure. Jade, about you getting a job?",
        "Jade: Mm-hmm. I'm looking for one online.",
        "Will: Yeah, Oakdale's not too big on that. You'd probably have better luck just driving around, looking for help wanted signs.",
        "Jade: I don't have a car.",
        "Will: Well, take mine.",
        "Jade: You don't need it?",
        "Will: I'm not going anyplace.",
        "Jade: Well, I don't know if I can brave that storm. And nothing in my wardrobe works for this weather.",
        "Will: Take this, it should be enough to keep you warm.",
        "Jade: Be a little more obvious, why don't you? You don't want me here, fine. But you don't have to bribe me to get rid of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Of course I want you to go to New York. I wouldn't put a stop to it. Business is business, and Mr. Yamamoto is fun, but --",
        "Dusty: Just give me the contracts.",
        "Lucinda: Right over there. Here's the contract. Have a safe trip. You seek the lord hamlet, there he is.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about her. Boy, it looks like it's really raining out there. Let me take your coat.",
        "Jane: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: So, I'd like you guys to stay inside today. I'm only going to be gone a couple of days, but I only need you one night. My mother-in-law is coming back tomorrow, and she'll take over. Believe me. I put some numbers down for you over here -- the pediatrician, the hotel where I'm staying -- and you always have my cell phone. He's been eating a little fussy, so wait a while, then give him peaches and yogurt. And he'll take the spoon from you, but don't worry about it. Okay, I think we got it covered. There he is. Daddy loves you. More than anything in the world. You and only you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hello, Meg.",
        "Meg: Hey, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Great day to crawl back into bed and pull the covers over your head.",
        "Meg: You know what? I was thinking the exact same thing. It's wall-to-wall sleet out there.",
        "Lucy: Which unfortunately means car accidents and a loaded E.R.",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know what? I should go down and make sure everybody's good to go.",
        "Lucy: Page me if you need me.",
        "Meg: Yeah, okay, thanks. [Cell phone rings] Hey, Paul, I can't talk right now. No, Emily can't hear, I'm at work. Emily is wherever she needs to be. Look, I tried following her and she called me on it. Yes, I know how important this is to you. Emily wants to take off, and she wants to make sure you never see your baby again. And I hate this as much as you do, Paul, but I'm just not good at this. Okay, okay, okay, okay, fine. Fine. As soon as my shift is over, I'll pick up the trail again. I'm sure Emily can't do that much damage between now and then.",

        "Henry: Hey!",
        "Margo: Henry? Come in, come in, come in!",
        "Henry: Yes, it's me!",
        "Margo: Oh, look at that!",
        "Henry: I really do know how to come in out of the rain -- or the sleet, in this case.",
        "Margo: Is that Maddie's stuff?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah. How's she doing?",
        "Margo: Well, you know. Sometimes good, sometimes not-so-good. She had a nightmare last night, she woke up screaming.",
        "Henry: Well, that'll go away, won't it?",
        "Margo: Not on its own, you know?",
        "Henry: I don't know what I know.",
        "Margo: Oh, Henry, come on. Maddie put out a lot of calls for help, and none of us really heard them.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know. I wish I knew why it was easier to buy her an ice cream soda than it was to just open my ears and listen, you know? You know, she once asked me to place a bet for runaway money? Can you imagine that? My baby sister was sitting there, practically in tears, asking me to put $20 on lefty to show, and its all fun and games for me.",
        "Margo: Well, done is done. You know? You can't do your sister any good by beating yourself up.",
        "Henry: Well, what will do any good?",
        "Margo: Just time, love, therapy.",
        "Henry: You don't think her being here, that's not just me copping out again?",
        "Margo: No. No, that's the best way to show her that you love her. Because I can talk to her in ways that you can't.",
        "Henry: But I'll get her back, won't I?",
        "Margo: Of course you will, Henry. You're her favorite person in the world.",
        "Henry: Is she here?",
        "Margo: No, she's out doing some errands.",
        "Henry: Isn't it a bit too soon for that?",
        "Margo: No. Life goes on.",
        "Henry: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Margo. This beats chatting in the interrogation room, I can guarantee you. [Margo laughs] I'm going to get out of your hair.",
        "Margo: No, why don't you sit and relax? You know, she'll be home soon with this storm a-brewin'.",
        "Henry: No, I don't want to intrude. I really don't.",
        "Margo: Excuse me.",
