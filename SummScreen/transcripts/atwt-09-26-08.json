        "Jack won't let Brad buy his forgiveness and tears up his check for $20,000. When Katie implies that she doesn't respect him, Brad goes to see Janet then apologizes to Jack for causing him to lose his job. After Brad promises to turn himself in for throwing Leo in the water, Jack assures him that Katie will be proud of him. After Mike informs Katie that he's going away for a while, she wants to have a fun time, so they go to Chicago and get drunk without telling Brad. On his way to see Bonnie at the club, Derek is taken by James and locked in the Fairwinds wine cellar after he refuses to go watch Meg at Faro Island. Worried when Derek doesn't arrive, Bonnie asks Dallas to find him but he has other concerns.",
        "Surprised when he sees a picture of Meg and Dusty on his laptop, Paul calls Jack, but the picture has disappeared. Paul then goes to the police station to read the coroner's report of Dusty's \"death,\" but Dallas tells him to back off or he'll be arrested. Concerned about Paul's behavior, Jack and Barbara take him to the hospital where he is admitted and sedated. Fighting to stay alert, Paul sneaks out of the hospital and finds Derek who tells him that Meg is at Swans Down cottage on Faro Island. There, Meg tries to get into a boat she found but gets stomach pains and stuns Dusty with the news that she's pregnant. Although she urges him to save himself, Dusty takes her back to the cottage and looks for a place where they can hide from James, but Meg insists she can't go anywhere, because she might lose her baby."

        "Jack: Can we make this fast, please?",
        "Brad: Good to see you too, Bro.",
        "Jack: I was in the middle of something when you called me, Brad. Let's go.",
        "Brad: Something with Carly?",
        "Jack: Are you having me followed?",
        "Brad: No, just Janet said you two might be getting back together.",
        "Jack: That is not even -- is that why you got me over here? To grill me about Carly?",
        "Brad: Wait, don't get your boxers in a bunch. I called you over to do you a favor.",
        "Jack: Last time you did me a favor, I had to quit my job.",
        "Brad: I know, I know. And I'm hoping this'll take the sting out of that. Katie, can you come out here, please?",
        "Jack: Hey, Katie. Brad's acting all mysterious. You want to tell me why he got me over here?",
        "Katie: I didn't even know he called you. You didn't tell me.",
        "Brad: Okay, I had to do something, didn't I? And I know, I am in the doghouse for what happened with you. And I am hoping that this will get me out.",
        "Jack: Does this check say $20,000?",
        "Brad: I want you to have it. I mean, it's the least I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on, Meg. I saw you before. Why don't you just come back to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Do you see that?",
        "Meg: Tell me it's not a mirage.",
        "Dusty: I told you there was a way out of here. You okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I just need a minute.",
        "Dusty: We don't have a minute. When James realizes we're gone, he's going to come hunting. A few hundred feet and we're home free. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You're in no condition to come in today. Well, because you just got out of the hospital, not to mention captivity. Now, if you show your face here, I will call Vienna. Yes, I know how to make martinis. Well, some people say that mine are actually better than yours. Yes! Well, go get rest and stop calling. Okay. Oh, my gosh.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bonnie: Didn't I tell you to stop calling?",
        "Derek: I don't remember you saying that.",
        "Bonnie: Derek? I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.",
        "Derek: Well, that's a relief.",
        "Bonnie: I didn't expect to hear from you.",
        "Derek: I told you, I really want to see you again.",
        "Bonnie: Well, men say that.",
        "Derek: Yeah, but I meant it. Although I may have to wait until the cops find Stenbeck.",
        "Bonnie: Why? What, are you worried that he might come after you?",
        "Derek: If he finds out I talked to the cops, he won't be happy, that's for sure. He's made a lot of threats. I don't want to give him a chance to make good on them. I'm going to lay low for a while.",
        "Bonnie: Look, why don't you come over to the club? No one's here.",
        "Derek: I don't know.",
        "Bonnie: Look, I didn't go out on a limb to get those charges dropped just so you could be Stenbeck's next victim. Just come over, I'll make you a sandwich.",
        "Derek: If you put it that way, I'll be there in ten minutes.",
        "Bonnie: All right. I'll be waiting.",
        "Jack: I don't get it.",
        "Brad: I wanted to give you cash. But the guy at the bank said a check was classier.",
        "Jack: Wait, why are you giving me $20,000 in any form?",
        "Katie: Good question.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm trying to take responsibility.",
        "Katie: Oh, my god.",
        "Brad: You said I don't listen.",
        "Jack: I'm still lost. How is giving me money taking responsibility?",
        "Brad: You were forced to leave your job because you wouldn't give me up to the cops. The least I can do is make up for some of the salary you're losing.",
        "Jack: Unbelievable.",
        "Brad: No, no, seriously, it's nothing. I mean, it's a huge chunk of my savings. But I did get a raise with this new contract.",
        "Jack: Okay, so giving me this check, that's supposed to make everything better?",
        "Brad: What, you don't think that it's enough? Because I got to tell you, I thought I was pretty generous.",
        "Jack: Brad, you could offer me $100,000. You can't buy a chunk of forgiveness.",
        "Brad: Oh come on, Jack. Is it so hard for you to let me be the good guy for once?",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm sorry. This is about him making himself feel better. I should have known.",
        "Brad: What is your problem? If someone gave me a $20,000, I -- what the hell just happened here?",

        "Jack: Paul, I have not heard from Dallas yet.",
        "Paul: Forget Dallas. I want you to come over to my place right away. I found Meg.",
        "Jack: What? Where? Where is she?",
        "Paul: I don't know where she is. But I know who she's with.",

        "Paul: Yep.",
        "Jack: Dusty's dead.",
        "Paul: No he's alive. And he's with Meg. They're in a picture together that was just sent to my computer.",
        "Jack: Who sent you the picture?",
        "Paul: I don't know. It just popped up.",
        "Jack: Was there a message attached?",
        "Paul: No, just the picture.",

        "Meg: No, I -- I can't.",
        "Dusty: If you just make it over the side -- here, let me help you. What is it, Meg? What is it?",
        "Meg: I can't.",
        "Dusty: Yes, you can. You have to.",
        "Meg: No, it hurts.",
        "Dusty: All right, you're probably -- you probably just have a cramp. We were pushing it a little back there.",
        "Meg: No, it's not that.",
        "Dusty: If you can just make it into the boat, Meg, it's gonna be worth it.",
        "Meg: Not if I lose my baby!",
        "Dusty: You're pregnant?",
        "Meg: I can't let anything happen to this child. And if it means going back to James to keep my baby safe, then I will do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What happened? Like -- no, what happened? You were the one that told me to take responsibility.",
        "Katie: Oh, is that what that was? Because it looked to me like you were insulting your brother.",
        "Brad: How is giving someone $20,000 insulting? You told me to make amends, I did. I paid him back for his trouble.",
        "Katie: When I said that, I didn't mean to literally pay him back with money.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay, okay. What did you mean?",
        "Katie: You know your brother. You know he wouldn't take your money. And for you to offer to pay him off like he's some obligation you have to check off your to-do list was just so --",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, just say it. Stupid.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it was.",
        "Brad: Do I do anything that's right in your eyes?",
        "Katie: It's been a while.",
        "Brad: How long? How long, since this whole Leo and Liberty thing? Since before that? Have I been a constant disappointment since you married me?",
        "Katie: I didn't say that.",
        "Brad: You didn't have to. Why are you with me?",
        "Katie: Because I love you.",
        "Brad: Right.",
        "Katie: I do, Brad. I just wish --",
        "Brad: What? What? Say it!",
        "Katie: When I first met you, I didn't think I could be with someone like you, because you would always be thinking of yourself. But then, you proved me wrong. You grew up. And then, this thing happened with Leo, it's like you reverted back to that person that you were. And that's not the person I married.",
        "Brad: So you love me. You just don't respect me. Not like you respect Jack and Mike.",
        "Katie: Mike? What does he have to do with this?",
        "Brad: Well, he was your husband once. And I'm sure you thought more of him then than you do of me now. Didn't you? I'll take that as a yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You know, it's a wonderful thing, living in a small town. You're always running into someone you know.",
        "Derek: I thought you'd left town.",
        "James: I did. I had some things to take care of.",
        "Derek: Yeah, what kind of things?",
        "James: You look a little agitated. Are you all right?",
        "Derek: Yeah, I just don't think we should be seen talking to each other.",
        "James: Why not?",
        "Derek: Because your son's been yapping to the police. He thinks I had something to do with the disappearance of his wife because I've been working with you.",
        "James: Oh. So law enforcement knows all about that, and you're still a free man? That's amazing.",
        "Derek: Yeah, well, they don't have anything on me except his suspicion.",
        "James: Hmm. So Henry and his delicious little ladies didn't press charges?",
        "Derek: Nope. No, I guess they just wanted to put the whole thing behind them.",
        "James: Lucky for you.",
        "Derek: Yeah, lucky for both of us. And if we want to keep it that way, I should get going.",
        "James: No, no, no. I need you to go with me.",
        "Derek: Where?",
        "James: Faro Island, off the coast of Maine. I have a plane waiting.",
        "Derek: Now why exactly do you need me to go to Maine?",
        "James: Well, I need you to help keep an eye on a houseguest. You see, well, she's not really a guest. I mean, Meg's more like family. But she's a little difficult to handle from time to time. And at Swans Down cottage, accommodations are wonderful, lovely. But she does tend to wander off. And I need you to help keep an eye on her, you know. Especially in her delicate condition.",
        "Derek: I can't.",
        "James: Why not? I thought you and Meg were relatively close.",
        "Derek: Yeah, that's before she knew I worked for you.",
        "James: She'll get over it.",
        "Derek: Yeah, well, she won't need to get over it, because I'm not going.",
        "James: Yes, you are.",
        "Derek: You told me yourself, once I got Paul out of that hole, my work would be done.",
        "James: Well, that's before I knew about Meg's wanderlust.",
        "Derek: Yeah, well, find someone else to look after her.",
        "James: No. No, Derek, I want you.",
        "Derek: Yeah, well that's too bad.",
        "James: Don't double-cross me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, is this a bad time?",
        "Katie: Is there a good time lately? Come on in.",
        "Mike: What happened?",
        "Katie: Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.",
        "Mike: Right, which means you don't want to tell me about it.",
        "Katie: No, it's just -- Brad and I had a fight.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: He got mad and walked out. And when the doorbell rang, I thought it might be him, like he'd forgotten his keys. But it was you and that's why I didn't want to tell you what was going on, because that's not what you came here to listen to. Why did you come here?",
        "Mike: To say good-bye.",
        "Katie: What do you mean, good-bye?",
        "Mike: I'm leaving Oakdale.",
        "Katie: For good?",
        "Mike: Who knows?",
        "Katie: What happened?",
        "Mike: Look, you got enough to worry about. I'll just come back later.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. I want you to tell me. Why are you leaving?",
        "Mike: Well you know, after the cave-in at the development site, everything pretty much went bust.",
        "Katie: I heard.",
        "Mike: Yeah. And that was the reason I was in Oakdale in the first place. So --",
        "Katie: What about Lily?",
        "Mike: She and Holden are going to try to give their marriage another shot.",
        "Katie: Are you okay?",
        "Mike: I'm disappointed. But it's like, I kind of knew all along that they were going to end up getting back together.",
        "Katie: Yeah. That's one of those marriages that you just see going on and on, no matter what happens.",
        "Mike: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna let you track down Brad. And I'm gonna --",
        "Katie: I don't think that's going to happen right now anyway.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Katie: I'm too angry and disappointed. And I don't want to say something that I'll regret. I was actually just leaving him a message telling him I wouldn't be here when he got home.",
        "Mike: Where were you planning on going?",
        "Katie: I hadn't decided yet. Where were you planning on going after you said good-bye?",
        "Mike: I don't know, I was probably gonna go grab a beer somewhere.",
        "Katie: Sounds good to me.",
        "Mike: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's Dusty. I'm positive, it's Dusty. And Meg is wearing something that I just gave to her, so I know it's a recent photo. And it's -- just give me a second. Where'd it go?",
        "Jack: What am I looking at here, Paul?",
        "Paul: Oh, hold on a second. Maybe it's in the trash. It was right here. Jack, the photo was right here.",
        "Jack: Okay, maybe you shouldn't have taken those pills.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. It's not the pills. This is real. There was a picture of Dusty and Meg. They were on a beach someplace. I saw it!",
        "Jack: Paul --",
        "Paul: I'm not making this up! Jack, I'm not making this up!",
        "Dusty: Are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Yeah. My doctor put me on bed rest. I shouldn't be moving around this much.",
        "Dusty: If I had known, I wouldn't have been pushing you like this.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. It's not your fault.",
        "Dusty: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Meg: After the way you reacted when you found out that Paul and I were together, I was a little reluctant to tell that I was also having his baby.",
        "Dusty: It's just hard for me to believe, after all the things he did.",
        "Meg: He's come a long way. He's changed. He's a different person. I believe in him. And I really believe this baby is really our hope for our future. This baby means everything to us.",
        "Dusty: What is it?",
        "Meg: Oh, God. I really need to go back and lie down.",
        "Dusty: No, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Meg: I've already lost one baby. I can't go through it again.",
        "Dusty: Listen, if we go back, we might never get off this island.",
        "Meg: But you will.",
        "Dusty: What are you saying?",
        "Meg: Go without me. What are you waiting for? Get in the boat. You can save yourself before it's too late.",
        "Dusty: No. No way. I'm not leaving you here.",
        "Meg: You have to, okay? If nothing else, you can send for help.",
        "Dusty: What's the point? What's the point if it's too late, Meg?",
        "Meg: I won't hold it against you.",
        "Dusty: You gave me a chance to find my son. Now I'm giving you a chance to raise yours without Stenbeck.",
        "Meg: Even if the child you're protecting is Paul's?",
        "Dusty: His and yours, it's your baby.",
        "Meg: You do know what you're up against if you stay with me.",
        "Dusty: Listen, dealing with Stenbeck's gonna be a piece of cake. Where in this together, Meg. And that's how we're getting out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's got to be here someplace, Jack. Something like that just doesn't --",
        "Jack: Dusty is dead, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, we thought my father was dead. We were wrong about that, weren't we?",
        "Jack: So you're saying that Dusty faked his own death? Why? Why would he do that?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I don't care! Dusty's alive.",
        "Jack: There's an autop -- what do you want? What do you want, a coroner's report?",
        "Paul: Why, you sure you got one?",
        "Jack: Come with me. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Derek, it's me. Did you change your mind about coming here? Because I thought when you said ten minutes, you meant 10 and not 35. So just call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You're in pain.",
        "Derek: What happened?",
        "James: I asked for your help and you refused.",
        "Derek: So what, you took a hammer to my head?",
        "James: I do not handle rejection very well, Derek.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You know, you can tell me to mind my own business. But it just seems like this fight with Brad is pretty big.",
        "Katie: Well, it's not so much a fight, I don't think, as much as a light bulb going off about how different we are. I thought I knew him. I thought that there wasn't anything that I didn't know. But I'm asking myself, who is this guy that I married? Who are we as a couple?",
        "Mike: Do you remember, I came to you right before you got married?",
        "Katie: Yes, I remember. You told me to wait, not to rush into anything.",
        "Mike: Right. And you said that you knew that Brad was the one.",
        "Katie: I was sure.",
        "Mike: Was? What about now? Are you saying that you made a mistake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: All there in black and white. Cause of death -- lethal injection.",
        "Paul: It's wrong.",
        "Dallas: What, are you saying the coroner made a mistake?",
        "Paul: I'm saying somebody lied to you. I know who was in that picture.",
        "Dallas: Okay. Show it to me.",
        "Paul: I can't.",
        "Jack: It was sent anonymously to his computer and then it disappeared off the screen.",
        "Dallas: I see.",
        "Paul: Oh, you think I'm making this up.",
        "Dallas: No, I think you're exhausted, and you need to go home and get some rest.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, here's what I think of your report!",
        "Dallas: You know what the penalty is for assaulting an officer? Huh?",
        "Paul: You want to arrest me for telling you the truth? You go right ahead.",
        "Jack: Don't, okay? He doesn't know what he's saying at this point. Let's get him some help.",
        "Paul: No, I don't need help, Jack! I'm not crazy! I know what I saw! Dusty is alive, and he's with my wife!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Doesn't look like he's here.",
        "Meg: Oh, no. He probably came back from that wild-goose chase I sent him on, and he probably freaked out when he saw that we weren't here.",
        "Dusty: Well, hopefully we have a little time.",
        "Meg: God knows what he's gonna do when he comes back.",
        "Dusty: You're gonna let me worry about James, all right? You need to rest. We gotta get you something to eat. What do you feel like? What is it? Another cramp?",
        "Meg: No, I haven't felt anything in a long time.",
        "Dusty: That's a good sign, isn't it?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I'm scared.",
        "Dusty: Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Meg: You don't know that. You don't know that. I'm afraid I pushed too much. I can't lose this baby. I can't, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Do you trust me? Then believe me when I tell you, you are not going to lose this baby. Not on my watch.",
        "Katie: I don't know if marrying Brad was a mistake. I love him. And we've been really happy, up until now.",
        "Mike: So far, so good.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but it's easy to be happy when things are running smoothly.",
        "Mike: Yeah. And then a crisis comes along, and it gets tricky.",
        "Katie: And that's just the thing. This crisis wasn't just about us. There were other people involved whose lives were totally turned upside down. And Brad saw it, he knew it, but he didn't do anything to make it better. And that's what scares me. That maybe he's not the person that I thought he was.",
        "Mike: Can you live with the person he is?",
        "Katie: I hope so.",
        "Mike: And if you can't?",
        "Katie: I can't go there, not even in my head. Another divorce? Am I insane? How many times do I have to do this before I realize that I am a total failure at relationships?",
        "Mike: You're acting like it's always your fault.",
        "Katie: Most of the time, it is.",
        "Mike: Not with us. I was the one that left you, remember?",
        "Katie: Because I cheated on you.",
        "Mike: True, that wasn't your finest hour. But it's not like you didn't beg me to stick around. And instead of doing that, I bailed on you.",
        "Katie: I didn't blame you.",
        "Mike: You should have. I made a promise to stick by you through good times and bad, and I broke it. You know, sometimes I wonder, what if I hadn't run? Would we have worked through what happened with Simon and stayed together?",

        "Brad: I screwed up royally. With Katie, with Jack, with you --",
        "Janet: With me?",
        "Brad: Well, I'm the reason why you two broke up, and you had to move out of Emma's. So I'm, like, what -- I'm three for three. Your life, Jack's career and my marriage. And I think I've lost something that I might not ever get back.",
        "Janet: Your good looks?",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Janet: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bradley. I couldn't resist. What is it that you've lost, that you're not going to get back?",
        "Brad: Respect. You don't respect me. Neither does Katie.",
        "Janet: You know, I've messed up, too. And sometimes, you have to lose something -- a job or your freedom -- to get back what you believe in the most.",
        "Brad: Like Jack did?",
        "Janet: Hell, yeah. He took the heat and faced it like a man.",
        "Brad: So I need to take a lesson from Jack?",
        "Janet: Couldn't hurt.",
        "Brad: Why is it always the answer to everything, for me to be like Jack?",

        "Katie: What good will it do to think what might have been? It won't help either of us.",
        "Mike: But it might help you and Brad.",
        "Katie: I don't know. I've just been lying awake, night after night, trying to figure out where we went wrong. And I can't. I'm just tired, I'm sick of thinking.",
        "Mike: So stop thinking, you know? Turn off your mind.",
        "Katie: I used to be able to do that without trying. But not anymore.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Katie: I guess I just changed. I grew up a little bit, myself.",
        "Mike: Come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "Katie: Where are we going?",

        "Dallas: It was the only way we could restrain him.",
        "Barbara: What happened?",
        "Jack: He claimed a picture of Meg popped up on his computer screen out of nowhere.",
        "Barbara: A recent picture?",
        "Jack: So says Paul. But there was another person in the picture, too.",
        "Barbara: James?",
        "Jack: Dusty. Dusty Donovan.",
        "Barbara: No, that's impossible, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know that. But Paul insisted it was Dusty. Even after we showed him the coroner's report.",
        "Dallas: And then he went ballistic.",
        "Barbara: Who sent him this picture?",
        "Jack: Barbara, there was no picture. He went to show me, and it was gone. I think those pills you gave him had an adverse effect.",
        "Barbara: It wasn't the drugs, Jack! It's James. He's behind this, he sent him this picture.",
        "Jack: To what end?",
        "Barbara: He is trying to destroy my son's credibility. Now, it's the only way he can gain back control. And I know you don't get this. But there's a lot history here, Jack. James has never forgiven me for taking Paul away from him when he was a little boy, or forgiven Paul for not being a part of his life. So he's trying to drive him crazy, do you understand? Can I see him, please?",
        "Dallas: Yeah, okay.",
        "Barbara: Are you okay?",
        "Paul: Did Jack talk to you?",
        "Barbara: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I'm not crazy. That picture was on my computer.",
        "Barbara: I believe you, Paul. But you have to know that your father is behind this. He's setting a trap for you, and you're falling right into it.",
        "Paul: Even if James did send that picture, it doesn't change what was in it. Meg was with Dusty. They were on a beach together. They were holding hands. Why would she do something like that to me?",
        "Barbara: She wouldn't, Honey. She wouldn't.",
        "Paul: Why was he there?",
        "Barbara: I'm going to talk to Jack and get you out of here, okay? You gotta help me. We gotta get him out of here and into a hospital right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: My feelings were hurt. I asked for your help, you wouldn't help me. After all I've done for you.",
        "Derek: You just caught me at a bad time. It was nothing personal.",
        "James: Nothing personal? Nothing personal? You give me to the cops, and it's nothing personal? Did you think I wouldn't find out?",
        "Derek: I told you, Paul had them after me. They were going to throw me in jail if I didn't give them something.",
        "James: So you gave them me.",
        "Derek: I didn't give them anything specific. If I had, they would've caught you by now. And listen, I know you want me to look after Meg. But if you wanted to do the --",
        "James: They haven't caught me by now because I'm too damn smart. I don't need you to help me look after Meg. I know where Meg is all the time and exactly what she's doing! You got that? Don't even think about it! My friend outside that bonked you on the head is willing, waiting and ready to finish the job.",
        "Derek: Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're just going to leave me here now?",
        "James: Well, until I determine how to finish our very fruitful relationship off, yes. I do hope you've eaten. Because you see, in the present economy, the prisoner's meal plan has been cut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Eat. I also want you to put your legs up. It's good for circulation, takes pressure off the back.",
        "Meg: You know so much. I'm sorry you lost Jennifer, Dusty. I know you loved her a lot. And now, I know what it's like to love someone that much. My heart goes out to you.",
        "Dusty: I hope Paul makes you happy.",
        "Meg: He does.",

        "Doctor: Well, he's suffering from acute sleep deprivation. I convinced him to take a sedative to get him through the night. And I've arranged for a psych consult first thing tomorrow.",
        "Barbara: Thank you, Doctor.",
        "Doctor: Listen, you should go home, get some rest yourself.",
        "Jack: You know, he's right. You'd be no good to Paul if you're exhausted.",
        "Barbara: I am no good to him as it is.",
        "Jack: Let me give you a ride home.",
        "Barbara: Okay, thanks. But what you have to do is keep working on finding Meg. I couldn't save Paul from his father. Maybe she can.",

        "Brad: Says who?",
        "Janet: Katie. She had a choice and she chose you, not Jack. I think she just wants you to step up and be the man she knows you can be.",

        "Katie: Whoa! When you said we were going someplace fun, I thought perhaps Mabel's, not Chicago.",
        "Mike: Are you sorry you came?",
        "Katie: Well, I won't have to worry about running into Brad here, that's for sure. That's a good thing. Still, it does feel a little weird to leave town without telling anyone.",
        "Mike: Well, the girl you used to be might have looked at it as an adventure.",
        "Katie: You sound like Brad.",
        "Mike: I don't know how to take that.",
        "Katie: He just has this amazing ability to do what he wants today, and not think about tomorrow. Which means he probably has a lot more fun than the rest of us.",
        "Mike: That doesn't seem fair.",
        "Katie: Maybe if I thought a little bit more like him, I wouldn't resent him so much. That's what I'm going to do. Tonight, I'm going to be Brad.",
        "Mike: Should I be scared?",
        "Katie: No, I am just going to live in the moment and to hell with the consequences.",

        "Bonnie: So? This is really serious, Dallas.",

        "Brad: I never expected you to. Okay, I'll admit when I gave you that check I was hoping that you and Katie would see me as a great guy. And I see that it was stupid, and it was wrong.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Brad: And I wasn't entirely unselfish when I asked you to cover for me with the whole Leo thing. I didn't want to go to jail.",
