Meg locks Emily in the barn and calls Paul to tell him frantically what is going down. Katie sees Mike's car at the crash scene, but he is gone, leaving a pool of blood behind. When Margo's attention is elsewhere, Katie decides to go looking for Mike. Emily calls out to Meg for help when she doubles over in pain. Dallas asks Jade why she didn't tell him she was pregnant? When Will heads out to see Jade, Gwen stops him asking him not to go. Lucy crashes her car, but Johnny is fine.

        "Flight attendant: Good evening, everyone. On behalf of the crew, I'd like to apologize for the delay. The captain has asked me to assure you that he's been in contact with the tower. We'll be taking off as soon as possible, flying nonstop from Oakdale to New York City. We're just waiting for the storm to change directions so the ground crew can begin de-icing.",

        "Flight attendant: If everyone could just remain calm.",
        "Dusty: What was that?",
        "Flight attendant: I just spoke with the captain. Apparently, that rocking motion was caused by a gust of wind.",
        "Dusty: A gust of wind?",
        "Flight attendant: The storm has picked up, but I want to assure everyone that we're perfectly safe and that as soon as the storm moves out, we'll begin our preparations for take-off.",

        "Lucy: I need an ambulance. I have a very sick child. There has to be an ambulance available. Put me through to Dr. Hughes. Hello? I got cut off. The switchboard must be overloaded.",
        "Jane: Would you like me to try to get through?",
        "Lucy: No, no. It's no use. All the ambulances are out on call. And with the weather the way it is --",
        "Jane: Where are you taking him?",
        "Lucy: The hospital. All right, are you ready little one? We're gonna go on a trip, okay? Look, I need you to call Memorial and tell them -- and tell them that Dr. Montgomery is bringing in Johnny. Then call Dusty again. If you can't get through to him, leave him a message and tell him that I've taken Johnny to the hospital and I'm gonna call him as soon as I know anything. And if he left you a number for Barbara, call her and let her know what's going on. Okay. Oh, good -- Barbara, I'm glad you're here. I'm taking Johnny to Memorial --",
        "Barbara: Over my dead body.",

        "Meg: Good girl. They really don't want to be out there in the cold.",
        "Emily: You slop the pigs and shovel out the stalls, too?",
        "Meg: Emily -- no, we have a hired hand for that. As a matter of fact, he should be here any minute.",
        "Emily: Really, does he drive a pickup truck?",
        "Meg: Yeah --",
        "Emily: Well, he's in a ditch -- about a mile down the road.",
        "Meg: I should go see if he's okay.",
        "Emily: I checked. There's no one there. But, I'm here.",
        "Meg: Because I threatened to call the cops if you left town with Daniel?",
        "Emily: Yes, you did. Not that it matters, but did you?",
        "Meg: Call them? Not yet, but I will.",
        "Emily: Not if I have anything to say about it.",

        "Gwen: What, are you following me?",
        "Will: No, I didn't even know it was you. I thought it was Casey.",
        "Gwen: He let me borrow his car. What are you doing out here?",
        "Will: See the lights? That's our place.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I must've gotten really turned around. It was really dark. The main road had a lot of traffic, so I took the back way --",
        "Will: Past our house? You're gonna flood the engine.",
        "Gwen: Whatever. You know what? Honestly, you can go. I'm fine.",
        "Will: Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna go and leave you stranded in an ice storm.",
        "Gwen: I'm not stranded --",
        "Will: The car won't start. What would you call it?",
        "Gwen: Well, you know what? It's not your problem.",
        "Will: Okay, fine, it's not my problem. It doesn't mean I can't help you. I came out here because I saw a car skid off the road. I was gonna help whoever it was. Move over. At least let me help you start the car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Where are you, Will? Pick up. The power must be out. [Tires squealing] Give me a little warning, why don't you!",

        "Margo: You're telling me, then, that I can drive through the storm, but Mike -- who's raced professionally -- he's not gonna make it.",
        "Katie: Well, I mean, we got in this fight, and I'm just worried that he's gonna be distracted or something.",
        "Margo: All right, what was the fight about?",
        "Katie: Sperm.",
        "Margo: Oh, that'll do it.",
        "Katie: No, we went to see a fertility specialist, and when it came time for him to -- give her a sample, he didn't want to. And I --",
        "Margo: Well, you -- you insisted?",
        "Katie: Of course I did. I want to get pregnant. And I'm gonna be the one blowing out my waistline and giving birth. It's the least he could do.",
        "Margo: Well, it's just sometimes guys get embarrassed about the procedure.",
        "Katie: Oh, please, like it's not embarrassing for a woman to have a doctor looking up her hospital gown?",
        "Margo: I'm sure that Mike'll come around. He was probably just taken off guard.",
        "Katie: I just want him home. At least he could call. [Phone rings] Mike?",
        "Nancy: So, he's not home yet?",
        "Katie: Nancy, hi.",
        "Nancy: Hello, Darling. I just talked to your handsome husband.",
        "Katie: Where?",
        "Nancy: Here at the hospital. He brought me here to wait out the storm, then he's going straight home to you. I expect the storm has slowed him down, but he said he was going out to take the interstate.",
        "Katie: What was he doing at the hospital?",
        "Bob: Hey, Mom, enough loafing. They need some help down at the switchboard.",
        "Nancy: Oh, absolutely. Katie, I have to go. I'm going to help Bob here. I'll call you tomorrow.",
        "Katie: Wait, Nancy!",
        "Margo: Mike is at the hospital?",

        "Will: Well, are you cold?",
        "Gwen: That's not the point.",
        "Will: Yeah, it is the point. You're cold, and I'm not, so take the coat.",
        "Gwen: Fine, you don't have to be so mad.",
        "Will: Well, you don't have to be so stupid. I know you hate me, but you're freezing, so take the damn coat.",
        "Gwen: I don't hate you.",
        "Will: Well, you could've fooled me. Okay, the thing about this car? If you take your foot off the gas once it's stalled, it's just gonna stall out again. I told Casey to fix the idle, like, 20 times --",
        "Gwen: Well, why don't we just back up?",
        "Will: Out of an icy ditch? Fine, let's just back out of the ditch -- okay.",
        "Gwen: Okay, okay, Will. You know what? You don't want to do this? Go back home.",
        "Will: Oh, that sounds like a great plan. Then you're gonna run out of gas in 20 minutes and freeze to death. Just put your foot on mine.",
        "Gwen: Excuse me?",
        "Will: I have to push the car, which means I have to take my foot off the gas and get out. And when I do, the car's gonna stall.",
        "Gwen: Like that?",
        "Will: Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna open the door.",
        "Gwen: Whoa, whoa, wait.",

        "Gwen: Yeah. Here, take your coat.",
        "Will: No, I'm fine. Thanks.",
        "Will: Keep your foot on the gas, and then put it in reverse. When I tell you to, just give it a little gas, okay?",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: Okay, go!",
        "[Tires spinning]",

        "Will: Gwen, what are you doing? The engine died!",

        "Will: Well, now you're stuck. And we're not gonna get the car to start again.",
        "Gwen: Okay, we're stuck. I thought you were hurt.",
        "Will: Does your phone work?",
        "Gwen: No, does yours?",
        "Will: It's in the house. Are we just going to stand out here?",
        "Gwen: Well, you can go up to the house and call a tow truck. I'll wait in the car.",
        "Will: Yeah, and freeze to death?",
        "Gwen: Oh, so it's okay for you to get run over, but I can't freeze to death? [Will laughs] It's not funny.",
        "Will: Come on, Gwen, this is stupid. Why don't we just go to the house and call a tow truck? And don't worry, you can still be as mad as you want. I won't get in your way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you have there, Emily? A pistol?",
        "Emily: A glove, Meg. It's cold in here. You actually thought I was going to shoot you?",
        "Meg: Well, it wouldn't be the first time you used a gun to solve a problem.",
        "Emily: And you are a problem. But those days are over. I will never let Paul push me over the edge again.",
        "Meg: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Emily: But that doesn't mean I'm not gonna defend myself -- against you. Defend my child, defend myself.",
        "Meg: By running away? And kidnapping Daniel? And the baby?",
        "Emily: Wait a minute -- I never said anything about kidnapping Daniel. And as far as my baby goes --",
        "Meg: According to Henry, he said that you were planning on leaving --",
        "Emily: Well, Henry doesn't know what he's talking about.",
        "Meg: So you weren't planning on taking Daniel out of the country?",
        "Emily: Meg, there's an ice storm. I mean, even if I could get the plane to take off, come on! And Tom's the district attorney. Why would I antagonize him like that? He'd have every cop in the state after me the second I left the driveway.",
        "Meg: So Tom knows nothing of your plans?",
        "Emily: We've discussed the situation. He's actually quite sympathetic. He understands that I need to put some distance between myself and Paul.",
        "Meg: I kind of find it hard to believe that Tom will allow you to take Daniel out of the country. I mean, you don't even share custody. And there was a time where you didn't even have visitation rights.",
        "Emily: And why is that?",
        "Meg: Because you can't be trusted, Emily.",
        "Emily: No, Paul can't be trusted. But you haven't gotten there yet. But you will, trust me. Things will go wrong. You will figure it out and you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me.",
        "Meg: Emily, look. I know you've had your feelings hurt --",
        "Emily: My feelings hurt?",
        "Meg: Okay, you've suffered. But don't make this worse. You're out of jail, you're out of the psych ward, you're gonna have a baby -- don't blow this. Have your baby, focus on your career, enjoy Daniel -- you could have a pretty nice life if you don't make every moment into such drama.",
        "Emily: No -- Paul will never go near this child again. And thanks to you and your interference, I have to make the kind of choice no mother should ever have to make. I have to choose between my son and my unborn child.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Cue the violins.",
        "Emily: And Paul's gonna blame you for this. I guarantee it. No more wedding, no engagement, no ring around your finger. Because of you, I have to leave my son behind and go into hiding.",
        "Meg: Oh, Emily -- you're being ridiculous --",
        "Emily: I am gonna leave town, and I'm never coming back.",
        "Meg: And what are you going to live on? You can't get a job, you're about to give birth. You have no family, no friends --",
        "Emily: Yeah, thanks to you, Meg.",
        "Meg: Oh, Emily, come on. Are you seriously gonna go to God-knows-where and leave Daniel?",
        "Emily: No, I will send for my son.",
        "Meg: Oh, and Tom will just happily pack up his little suitcase and stick him on a plane? After you've kidnapped Paul's child?",
        "Emily: No, my child. My child.",
        "Meg: That you would use this child to hurt Paul because he's marrying me -- that you would deprive this child of his father -- how can you even think like that?",
        "Emily: I had a good teacher -- goodbye, Meg.",
        "Meg: Don't go, okay? Not out in that storm, not right now! You'll hurt yourself, and the baby.",
        "Emily: Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to take that chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How could you let her take him anywhere?",
        "Lucy: Barbara, he needs medical attention.",
        "Jane: I called the hospital, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Oh? And let me guess, Dr. Montgomery answered and you rushed right over here. Thank you very much, I can handle it from here, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Barbara, he has a fever. Feel his head.",
        "Barbara: He's just all bundled up in his snowsuit, aren't you, sweetie pie?",
        "Lucy: Barbara, if he's having a relapse, he'll need a transfusion, and he'll need his meds.",
        "Barbara: He's very warm -- call the hospital, we need an ambulance.",
        "Lucy: We tried that already, but the weather -- there aren't any ambulances available.",
        "Jane: And I tried calling Mr. Donovan.",
        "Lucy: But Dusty's on a plane trying to get to New York. Look, Barbara, my car is downstairs. I'll take him to the hospital --",
        "Barbara: You're not driving him anywhere!",
        "Lucy: He needs treatment.",
        "Barbara: I have already lost my daughter to your carelessness. Do you think I would let you touch her son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Miss?",
        "Flight attendant: I'll be with you in a moment, Sir. Can I please have everyone's attention? I've just spoken with the captain, and it looks as if we'll be here for awhile. He appreciates your patience. Given the circumstances, he's going to allow you to use your cell phones. I do have to warn you that because of the storm, reception is spotty. I know it's aggravating, but unfortunately we have no control over the weather. I suggest you try to relax, and we'll be around to take your drink orders.",
        "Dusty: Miss?",
        "Flight attendant: You'll have to wait your turn, Sir --",
        "Dusty: I can't wait. I can't wait. My son's sick. I gotta get off this plane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I know my daughter would want me to forgive you, but I can't. Not where my grandson is concerned.",
        "Lucy: You drive him to the hospital, fine. I don't care. But we need to go.",
        "Barbara: We're not driving him anywhere. I was just out in this storm. I passed three accidents. It's not safe out there.",
        "Lucy: Okay, look. I'll drive him to the hospital and you and Johnny can sit in the back seat.",
        "Barbara: You're not driving anywhere, do you understand? You'll go right into a telephone poll. No, what we need is an ambulance. You have to call the hospital.",
        "Lucy: But there aren't any ambulances, Barbara. And we're wasting time.",
        "Barbara: Okay, you're not taking him anywhere. Don't you move. Yes, this is Barbara Ryan. Would you please page Dr. Hughes and tell him that it's an emergency? Yes, I need -- I don't care if there's a crisis! I know that there's an ice storm out there. I need an ambulance here. It's my grandson. I need an ambulance, do you understand? Give me your name. Because I'm going to report you, that's why! Hello?",

        "Gwen: Thanks. Hello? Yeah, hi. My name is Gwen Munson -- my club code number is 8755328. I drove my car into a ditch on the southside of the lake in Oakdale. Wait, what do you mean, tomorrow? What am I supposed to do between now and -- hello? She hung up on me.",
        "Will: Looks like we're gonna have to stay here. The line must be down. Do you remember where you put the matches?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Jade was here last night?",
        "Will: Yeah, she was. And I hope that wherever she is now, she's smart enough to stay put. The power's probably gonna be out for awhile, so I'm gonna go get some wood. Do you want to start a fire?",
        "[Will remembering]",
        "Will: You know, we're lucky we got here when we did. It's really coming down out there. We might even get snowed in.",

        "Emily: Why, Meg? So you can convince me to stay? So I can work all day with my kid in daycare while you and Paul are planning your dream wedding? I don't think so.",
        "Meg: Do you even know why you're leaving? I mean, first, it was because you didn't want Paul to see his child. Then, you didn't want to see us getting married. Now, you're leaving because your life didn't turn out the way you planned it?",
        "Emily: It all boils down to the same thing.",
        "Meg: Yes, it does. You're jealous. And I understand. I was jealous, too. I know how that feels, but you have to find a way to move on.",
        "Emily: That's the plan, Meg.",
        "Meg: Move on emotionally --",
        "Emily: I can't. Not here. Not now. Not with you and Paul trying to humiliate me and lie to me and use me every time I turn around. Maybe it's just too hard for me. Did you ever think of that? Maybe I need to go someplace new -- somewhere where there are no memories, where there's no chance of me running into Paul. Somewhere where I can go and love my baby and not hold my breath every time his father wants to take him out the front door. But I can't do that here. I can't see it. I can't see a future here.",
        "Meg: I hear you.",
        "Emily: Good. Now get out of my way!",
        "Meg: Okay, now, wait. Wait, there has to be a way to work this out. I mean, I know how hard it is putting the pieces back together with all these reminders, but you can't leave town, Emily. You're a mother. You can't leave Daniel.",
        "Emily: I don't have a choice.",
        "Meg: Yes, you do.",
        "Emily: God, Meg, get out of my way. Please!",
        "Meg: Okay, fine! Fine, you can leave, but just not tonight. Not in this storm --",
        "Emily: I don't have a choice. If I don't leave now, I will never get a chance.",

        "Emily: Call my mother? That's a great idea, I'll call my mom.",
        "Meg: Since you're so close to the due date, don't you think it would make sense if you took your mom with you? I mean, she is a doctor. She could help you deliver the baby, she could help you have some privacy and have some extra help at the same time. I mean, and then in a month or two, you could --",
        "Emily: Yeah, in a month or two when you fight for custody to take my child away from me?",

        "Will: And now my sister's dead and we're babysitting Johnny. Gwen, stuff happens. You can't control it, you can't even predict it. But what you can do is hang onto what works and what's good.",

        "Will: Look, I don't want to sound like I'm not owning up to what I did or what you've gone through, but we're still here. Nobody's sick, nobody's dying, no one's trying to stop us. And I know it's not easy to trust someone again once they let you down, but you knew I wasn't perfect. I never will be. I'm probably gonna make a lot more mistakes, but I'm still me, and I love you.

But just that the way that that felt. And I wish that we could feel the way that we did. You know, that it was like you and me against the world. And, you know, before you, I was alone.",
