        "Holden: You sounded just like her.",
        "Faith: The way she made Horton talk.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Nat, want to say goodnight to your mommy?",
        "Lucinda: Okay, goodnight, Mom.",
        "Holden: Goodnight.",

        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, just give me a minute, okay?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Holden: You know, Faith, she practiced that all day. Luke, he spent two hours just going over and over it with her. You would've been very proud of him. You should have been there.",

        "Lily: Tell them their mother is coming home. And I'll be with them soon. Don't let me go, Holden.",
        "Holden: You know, I'm not the only one waiting for you. I heard what you said to me. And I know that you're going to keep your word.",

        "Will: You don't want me to go?",
        "Gwen: No. It's just -- you know, you're right. She's at the hospital. There are doctors there taking care of her.",
        "Will: Well, that's why I shouldn't go to the hospital. Why do you think I should stay here?",
        "Gwen: Well, because of the storm. It's not safe to be driving right now.",
        "Will: So, me staying here, that's about safety?",
        "Gwen: I'm just trying to be, you know, logical. It doesn't make any sense for you to leave right now.",
        "Will: This is just you being logical?",
        "Gwen: No. No, it's more than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I -- I don't understand.",
        "Dallas: You know, I think it's a pretty simple question. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?",
        "Jade: I didn't think.",
        "Dallas: You're pregnant and in a car wreck, that should be the first thing you think about.",
        "Jade: How would you know?",
        "Dallas: I called Will. Okay? He seemed pretty concerned that the baby was all right. More concerned than you seem to be.",
        "Jade: Well, it's like you said, I was in a car wreck. I'm dazed. Isn't it normal for someone who's been smashed in an airbag for 30 minutes to be a little out of it? I couldn't breathe, Dallas. I almost passed out.",
        "Dallas: What are you trying to say? That you couldn't get enough oxygen to your brain?",
        "Jade: Maybe.",
        "Dallas: Well, you seem pretty lucid here. And turning down medical help?",
        "Jade: I don't like the way you're talking to me.",
        "Dallas: And I don't like what I'm thinking. So why don't you set me straight? Just what is it you're not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Oh, Baby, it's freezing in here, isn't it? Don't worry, Sweetheart. We'll get out of here and get you to the hospital. It'll be fine. We'll be fine.",

        "Paul: The same as you, I'm trying to get to town.",
        "Dusty: You're not really trying to steal my cab, are you?",
        "Driver: Look, look, there's no need for fighting. All right? 'Cause I ain't going out in this mess.",
        "Paul: No, well, of course you are. Because I'm going to give you $1,000. Okay? Are you seriously going to tell me that you're not interested?",
        "Dusty: This is my taxi! I have a crisis on my hands!",
        "Paul: Crisis? Emily's the walking definition of crisis, all right? Let me tell you something, Dusty. It's going to take a hell of a lot more than you to keep me from getting in this taxi.",

        "Meg: Your water broke? Are you sure?",

        "Holden: I was just talking to your mom.",
        "Luke: Well, you said that -- that she told you something?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, maybe there's some things that your father would rather not divulge.",
        "Holden: You know what? It's okay. You know what? I should just tell you. After we talked to the chapel, I decided to stick around. To try and sort things out. And Lily -- she talked to me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling.",
        "Holden: You know what? It's okay. You can think that I'm crazy, but I know that it was her. She told me that we shouldn't give up on her. That she was going to come back to us. And I believe her.",
        "Bob: Luke, why don't you see if the girls are all right? Holden, I'll be outside, but I do want to talk to you.",
        "Holden: Do you think I'm crazy?",
        "Lucinda: Not me. I mean, if anybody knew half of what goes through my mind, I would have been locked up long ago.",
        "Holden: But you don't think she talked to me.",
        "Lucinda: I want to believe it. I really want to believe it. I'll wait outside. I'll be outside with Bob.",

        "Holden: I know you're just doing your job, and I know you think that this is false hope --",
        "Bob: Why would you think that? You know, I've been around a long time, and I've seen people's faith work wonders.",
        "Holden: But -- I know there's a but.",
        "Bob: I think it's important for you to know that faith and hope are not denial. But also, you have to be aware that you have to prepare yourself and your family for what might be coming.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Bob -- Bob!",
        "Holden: No, I understand, I understand. You know, maybe we should just talk about this in a day or so. I know you have a lot of things that you need to deal with right now.",
        "Bob: Well, you're right. I've got hours to go before I sleep. But I wanted to tell you, I think you should stay here. The roads are worse, if that's possible. And I don't need any more patients.",
        "Holden: Anything we can do to help out?",
        "Bob: I'm sure there is downstairs.",

        "Emily: Help? What are you kidding me? You did this to me, you locked me in here!",
        "Meg: Emily, think about the baby, okay? Just shut up and think about the baby. I know you, when you think about the baby, you calm down and you do what's right. Look, I know what I'm doing. I've helped many women deliver babies, and I can help you. So let me just do it. Are you having contractions?",
        "Emily: No, not since the first one. Maybe that was it. Maybe everything's going to be okay, and -- oh! Oh, God, no!",
        "Meg: I think we just answered that question. Okay, how strong was that one?",
        "Emily: It's really strong. Okay, you can give me something, right, to slow down the labor? They do that. You can take me to the hospital and give me something to stop my labor, right?",
        "Meg: Whoa, whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?",
        "Emily: Meg --",
        "Meg: The first thing you need to do is calm down, okay? I'm gonna go get my bag.",
        "Emily: No, you're not going anywhere. You gotta get me to the hospital. We gotta go to the hospital, Meg.",
        "Meg: Emily, we can't. The roads are a mess.",
        "Emily: Ow! But my water broke. That means there's a chance for infection, right? Would you look around? We are in a barn. A barn is not sterile, Meg.",
        "Meg: Emily, I know what to do, okay? You time your contractions and I'll be right back. Just stay there, don't move, and think about the baby!",
        "Emily: Think about the baby? Oh, I am thinking about you. Come on, I'm thinking about you. Okay \u0096",

        "Driver: Okay, okay, listen. All right? I'm going to take you and him. I'm going to take the both of you for $5,000. But when you get in the car, and I'm driving, you both gotta keep your stupid mouths shut. You got it?",

        "Gwen: What else is there to say?",
        "Will: You said it wasn't just logic that made you ask me to stay.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You know -- I mean, if you're out there, I'd be worried about you. I can't just stop caring about you overnight.",
        "Will: It's not just caring. You still love me?",
        "Gwen: Of course I do. None of this would hurt so much if I didn't. Believe me, if there was a switch, I'd flip it.",
        "Will: Well, lucky for me, there isn't one. Look, if me being here makes you unhappy, I'll go --",
        "Gwen: No! It doesn't. Look, why don't you just stay here? And we'll talk about, like, the weather.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, if you're inside and you're warm enough, then it's actually pretty nice out. And the trees look beautiful.",
        "Gwen: Yes, they do.",
        "Will: It's really quiet, you know? It's almost like the rest of the world just went away. Gwen, wouldn't it be nice if we could make the rest of the world go away? Jade and the baby --",
        "Gwen: It's not that easy.",
        "Will: Maybe it is. Maybe it's just making a decision. Maybe it's saying there's an ice storm outside, and I'm inside, all alone with the one person in the world that I love to be all alone with. And in the place that we were going to make our first home.",
        "Gwen: I was so happy here.",
        "Will: We were. And we still can be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: But think about that pile-up. Look around this hospital. There are plenty of other people who could use a cop right now. I am not one of them.",
        "Dallas: You know what? You're right. I've got to get back to work.",
        "Jade: Please, don't let me keep you.",
        "Dallas: But before I leave, I want you to think about this. Okay? Whatever you tell the doctor is confidential. No one's going to find out you're pregnant just because you get a checkup.",
        "Luke: Jade, what are you doing here?",
        "Jade: Along with half the town, I was in the pile-up on the interstate. Those socks are fabulous. I want them.",
        "Holden: Are you okay?",
        "Jade: Yeah, I'm fine. How's your mom?",
        "Luke: She's the same. So, you stuck here for the night here, too?",
        "Jade: Huh?",
        "Luke: Well, they're sitting up a shelter because they don't want us to leave.",
        "Jade: That's just what I need.",
        "Faith: Maybe we can have a sleepover.",
        "Jade: You know? That would be fun.",
        "Lucinda: You think so, do you? Well, I don't.",
        "Jade: Maybe next time. Okay, well, I'll catch you guys later.",
        "Holden: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Jade: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",

        "Casey: No. But I have a confession to make. I am sick of that book you got me started on at the hospital.",
        "Maddie: Don't joke. I think Gil and Ada were right when they said that my problems were the last thing that you needed.",
        "Casey: Maddie, Gil and Ada are never right. That's just a given.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I am a basket case. You have to take care of me all the time. I mean, just now-- I heard your voice, I knew it was you, and I continued hiding. That's seriously messed up.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you called my name. You didn't keep hiding.",
        "Maddie: I'm sitting here, aren't I?",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, then, you know, we're going to change that. We're going to get up, we're going to light some candles, maybe get something to eat.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Casey: Okay? And then I'm gonna tell you something.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: That when you said you thought you were gonna be scared forever? I knew exactly what you meant.",

        "Lucy: Can you help us? We can't get out. The door is stuck. Thank you. Thank you so much. But can I ask you one more favor? My baby brother is sick, I need to get him to the hospital. Can you help me, please? Please, help me.",

        "Emily: Oh, God!",
        "Meg: All the phones are dead. Emily, what are you doing?",
        "Emily: I gotta get to the hospital --",
        "Meg: Emily, we can't make it, okay? And the more you move, the more you're speeding up the contractions. Sit down.",
        "Emily: This is not happening to me --",
        "Meg: Okay, come on, we need to get you settled, okay? Listen to me, sit down. You know, what you were saying about slowing down the contractions?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Meg: I have something I could give you.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Meg: When I was doing home care nursing, I used to have this patient that would go in and out of premature labor, and I just kept some extra medicine on hand so I would have it to give to her in case of an emergency.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, no!",
        "Meg: Come here.",
        "Emily: No! You think I'm going to let you help me? After what you did to me, after what you tried to do to me?",
        "Meg: Emily, I'm what you've got. Look, I've gone to nursing school, all right? I've assisted in labor rooms, delivery rooms -- I can help you here, okay? So you need to trust me, okay? For the baby's sake.",

        "Meg: Okay?",

        "Emily: It hurts, it hurts! Is it going to stop the labor?",
        "Meg: It could help. But listen to me -- what's going to help even more is if you and I promise each other to just calm down and do everything we can for this baby, all right?",
        "Emily: All right.",
        "Meg: Now, I'm assuming you've taken childbirth classes, right?",

        "Will: Okay, well, can I just say something? Can't we just look at this like the worst has got to be behind us? Because I can't screw up any worse than I already have. What would that be? Armed robbery?",

        "Casey: Because I'm a guy.",
        "Maddie: Oh --",
        "Casey: And guys always do something else when they're talking about something serious. Like tune the car, watch a game.",

        "Casey: Yeah, me and my dad waterproofed the basement when he told me about sex.",
        "Maddie: Are you kidding me?",
        "Casey: Yeah, here, go. The awkward pauses weren't as awkward when he didn't have to look me in the eye when he got to the real nuts and bolts. Importantly, later, we acted like the conversation never took place. We went upstairs, congratulated each other on a good job that we'd done, and we've always been proud of how dry our basement is.",
        "Maddie: That makes me think that you don't want to have a serious talk, that you're embarrassed or something.",
        "Casey: Of course I am. Roll again. Anyway, earlier, when you said that you thought that you'd be scared forever, I really do know exactly what that feels like. Like, when I found out that Gwen was pregnant, and that I was the father --",
        "Maddie: We don't have to talk about this.",
        "Casey: What I'm trying to say is, I acted really terrible, and I did everything I could to cover it up because I was afraid of what was going to happen. And now, I mean, looking back, I would have definitely done things differently. But it was in the past, and I mean, now my life's good. And I know that good things can happen.",

        "Casey: And I know that what happened to me was my fault, and that you didn't do anything wrong, but -- I mean, think I really do get how bad that feels.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Casey: And I didn't figure all of that out on my own. My mom told me about it. She'd probably talk to you, too, if you wanted. She does a lot better job explaining it.",
        "Maddie: You do a pretty good job. It's still your turn. Casey?",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Maddie: We can pretend that we didn't have this conversation, but I'll never forget it.",

        "Dusty: No, he's not.",
        "Paul: Dusty, don't even start, okay?",
        "Dusty: Hey, just go straight, all right?",
        "Paul: Look, I know you're Mr. Big Shot Business guy now, or at least you think you are, but Emily's got my kid. She's threatening to leave the country and I gotta get to her because I gotta give her a court order.",
        "Dusty: We're going to the hospital. Johnny's sick.",
        "Paul: What? Johnny's, what, like, bad sick?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, bad.",
        "Paul: Well, why didn't you tell me when we were arguing over the cab?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause I don't like talking about, especially to you!",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. All right, you know what? We'll go the hospital first, all right? You said it's urgent.",

        "Meg: Emily, your water broke. The baby is coming.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, no!",
        "Meg: But, listen to me, listen to me. We can keep the contractions from coming too quickly, okay? And that way you have a really good chance --",

        "Meg: You have a good chance to making it to the hospital --",
        "Emily: Oh, God! This is not happening! Will you stop it! You are just trying to keep me from panicking.",
        "Meg: Okay, look. I've seen what you've been through with this pregnancy, how you fought. Pretty impressive. You're not going to give up now, right?",
        "Emily: Right. Gosh, it is freezing.",
        "Meg: It is freezing. Here.",
        "Emily: No, no, Meg, come on. Cut it out. Meg, you're gonna freeze.",

        "Meg: That sound? Something is wrong.",

        "Casey: No, you are a sneak. Actually, you're worse than that. You are, like, real sneaky. You put on this little front, where you act like you're all cute and innocent, and it's just a disguise for a mean, mean person.",
        "Maddie: Okay, it is not my fault that you're just -- really bad at this game.",
        "Casey: Oh, that's really nice. Really nice.",
        "Maddie: All right, what are we going to do now?",
        "Casey: Well, we're not playing any more games, I can tell you that right now.",

        "Maddie: Ah -- so, why'd you come back anyway? I thought you loved the dorms.",
        "Casey: The ice cream. Yeah, I knew that there was a blackout, and it's your civic duty to make sure that none of it gets wasted. So, I'm going to be right back. If you hear something that sounds like me falling down the stairs, it's probably me falling down the stairs.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Case? It looks like the ice cream doesn't need rescuing anymore.",
        "Casey: Well, it does, if it's Rum Raisin. Look what I found. Rum Raisin.",
        "Maddie: I sleep with the lights on.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Maddie: You knew that, though. You walk by my room. And tonight, when you heard that there were blackouts, you came back to check and see if I was freaking out, which I was.",
        "Casey: Maddie, with good reason. There are a lot of people that are afraid of the dark that haven't been through half of what you've been through.",
        "Maddie: When the lights went out, the first thing that I thought of was, it would be okay if Casey were here. And then, there you were, with your jokes, and knowing the right thing to say.",
        "Casey: Well, I am perfect.",
        "Maddie: Seriously, you make me feel like I'm not a victim. I just -- I don't want it to be like you're taking care of me, more like --",
        "Casey: We'll get there. And I'll continue to be perfect.",
        "Maddie: You know what I want? Let's turn out the lights. Even the candles.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Maddie: Okay. It's nice to feel safe, even in the dark.",
        "Casey: Safe?",

Now, listen, I want everyone who is not working or waiting for treatment to leave this area and go to the cafeteria. We need this space. Now, everybody stay calm. We expect more patients to be coming in. Thank you very much.",
        "Holden: Bob, Lily, she's hooked up to so many things. I'm worried about the loss of power --",
        "Bob: Now, don't worry. There's no problem, because the alarms would have gone off. [Pager beeping] I gotta go, Holden. Why don't you go to the cafeteria? And don't worry.",
        "Holden: Yeah, like I'm not going to worry. Okay, guys, here's what we're going to do. We are going to have sleepover in the cafeteria. Okay? So why don't you all head down there and I'll catch up with everybody in a bit, okay?",

        "Jade: They could hurt the baby?",
        "Nurse: Have I finally gotten through to you? Yes, it can hurt the baby. I'm going to call the ob resident, she can tell us what's the next step.",

        "Meg: Paul? Paul, when you get this message, you need to call me ASAP. I had to lock Emily in the barn. She was threatening to run away.",

        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: This is when we'd talk about all the things that we were gonna do.",
        "Will: Well, we could do that now.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but before, when we'd talk about all the years that were ahead of us, I really did think that we had forever.",
        "Will: We still could.",
        "Gwen: I even believed the things that probably weren't going to come true.",
        "Will: Like what?",
        "Gwen: Like awards and platinum records.",
        "Will: I'm still sure of all that. But maybe we just shouldn't make such big plans, you know, so far off. But what about, like, suppose tomorrow we wake up in the morning and I'm still here and you're not sick of me yet, then what would we do then? What would you plan then?",
