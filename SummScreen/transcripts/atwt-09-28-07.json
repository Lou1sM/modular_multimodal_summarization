        "Rosanna: I thought you said you were going to run errands.",
        "Paul: It's nothing important.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, good, okay. Is everything okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah, everything's fine. You seemed a little blue, I thought you might not want to be alone.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, I'm just tired, that's all. And my physical therapist is on his way, so you know, I'm not going to be alone.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, then I'll just hang out here until he comes.",
        "Rosanna: Actually, I don't need a babysitter. Um, Boy, that came out wrong. That's really not fair. I'm sorry. I just -- these sessions make me a little anxious, you know?",
        "Paul: It's okay. I understand.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Would it hurt your feelings terribly if I took you up on your offer to let me be alone for awhile? I just need time to focus, and you know, sometimes I feel a little self-conscious doing all this work --",
        "Paul: Sure. I'm going to go to Old Town. If you need to reach me, my cell will be on, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thank you for understanding.",
        "Paul: Listen, I know how hard it is to try to get your life back, so, Rosanna, you don't ever have to worry about my feelings.",
        "Rosanna: But I do, Paul, I do. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Craig: I was wondering if you had a chance to think about what I said.",
        "Rosanna: Actually, I thought quite a bit about many of the things that you said. And I think most of them are probably lies.",
        "Craig: You will lose Paul. To Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Meg? Mrs. Montgomery?",
        "Meg: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I guess you didn't see me there. I was just shopping. I bought myself a new dress for Craig's hearing for tomorrow. Something festive, because I plan on having the time of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm telling you, the moment you testify, he will find his way back to Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for the warning. You've ruined how many lives? Oh, and I won't make you pay if it means I might lose my boyfriend.",
        "Craig: You didn't see them at our wedding. He couldn't keep his hands off of her.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, and I know in 1 million years you'd never lie, especially not about Paul.",
        "Craig: It's not over between them and you know it.",
        "Rosanna: I'll take that under advisement.",
        "Maid: There's a Mr. Fellows at the door, he says he has an appointment.",
        "Rosanna: Uh, yes, thank you very much. Please send him in.",
        "Fellows: Ms. Cabot?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Fellows: Jim Fellows.",
        "Rosanna: How do you do? Very nice to meet you.",
        "Fellows: So, you need a private investigator. Tell me what you need me to do.",
        "Rosanna: Follow my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Do you want to go lie down?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. It's just a shot. I'm fine.",
        "Will: I'm just making sure that I take good care of you.",
        "Gwen: You already take fantastic care of me. It does not seem fair however, that the shots make Alison nauseous, when you know, she's the one who's doing us a favor.",
        "Will: The whole thing just seems so weird to me.",
        "Gwen: Well, don't say that. I mean, if this is the way we're going to have a baby, I don't want to think it's weird. I want to think that it is -- I want to think that it is perfect.",
        "Will: It's --it's just --",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: I don't know. I think I'm going to be a lot happier about the whole baby thing when it's just you and me. And not you, me and Alison.",
        "Gwen: Come on, you know how much we owe her.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know.",
        "Gwen: Don't be like that. Hey look, pretty soon, I'll be pregnant. And it'll be worth everything that we've had to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You got some mail.",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, the desk clerk gave it to me with invoices. What's up with that?",
        "Sofie: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Aaron: Why are you using the Lakeview as your address? Oh, it's from your doctor.",
        "Sofie: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: Something else you're keeping from Cole.",
        "Sofie: Aaron, just --",
        "Aaron: It's none of my business. I know.",
        "Sofie: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Jack?",
        "Henry: No such luck, it's just us.",
        "Vienna: You look horrible.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Vienna: My heart broke when I saw that there was no do not disturb sign on the door.",
        "Katie: Nothing to disturb.",
        "Henry: Is he still with Carly?",
        "Katie: And the kids. They were going to tell them.",
        "Henry: Ah, Kid.",
        "Katie: I had to leave, knowing what they had to do.",
        "Henry: I know, I know.",
        "Katie: His face. Henry, Jack's face was so sad and scared and there's nothing I can do.",
        "Vienna: That's not true, Darling. Absolutely not true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I went in to say good night to Parker, he was already out.",
        "Carly: Always been his great escape.",
        "Jack: Do you want anything?",
        "Carly: Sit down, okay? I want to explain something. I decided to take whatever treatment they can offer me because I want to have as much time as possible with the kids.",
        "Jack: Thank God you did.",
        "Carly: But I want more than time. I want to be me, you know? Not some --",
        "Jack: Invalid. You were quite clear on that point.",
        "Carly: It's more than that. I want them to -- to remember me as I was.",
        "Jack: As you are.",
        "Carly: Jack, I need your help.",
        "Jack: I'll do anything I can.",
        "Carly: Okay. First thing. Biggest thing. Hardest thing.",
        "Jack: Yeah --",
        "Carly: Going through this? I want you to be honest with me. 100%. If I start to slip, if I'm not myself, I want you to tell me. If I can't get it together, then I want you to get those kids and get them away from me.",
        "Jack: You may be underestimating them, Carly.",
        "Carly: Humor me.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: The way I figure it, right now is the best I'm going to be. So I want you to help me make a video for them. So I can say happy birthday or congratulations graduate --",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: No. Jack, help me. Help me do this.",
        "Jack: You don't ask much, do you?",
        "Carly: I want to fight as hard as I can for as long as I can.",
        "Jack: Now there's a surprise.",
        "Carly: You know what bothers me? I was never a sappy mom, you know, it just doesn't seem fair that I have to end up that way.",
        "Jack: Nothing about this seems fair.",
        "Carly: But I don't think I should dwell on that. So, on to more practical things. Do you remember where that old video camera is?",
        "Jack: It's broken. But the kids gave me a new one for a wedding present.",
        "Carly: Wow. Where'd they get that kind of money? We must spoil them.",
        "Jack: You spoil them.",
        "Carly: Well, that's just the beginning. I don't suppose you have that -- that camera with you?",
        "Jack: No, but I can get it.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, well in that case, Jack, I'm ready for my close-up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: You are his wife now. And so, you don't have to retreat into this dark room wearing a man's shirt.",
        "Katie: It's a hockey jersey -- he gave it to me for our wedding -- look how cute.",
        "Vienna: Okay, well, you're dressed like a boy and this room is depressing. That's not what Jack needs.",
        "Katie: I couldn't let the maids in. I didn't want to cry in front of them.",
        "Vienna: Fine. So you cry in front of us, okay, and then you change while we tidy up this room.",
        "Katie: Doesn't that seem a bit superficial?",
        "Vienna: Well, sometimes superficial things can be very comforting. So tonight, when Jack gets back from a hellish day, he gets to see his beautiful new wife in a beautiful warm room. Because life can be so many things at the same time, Katie. So don't let him forget about all the wonderful ones. You.",
        "Katie: I just don't want it to seem like I don't care.",
        "Henry: Katie, you do care. Everybody knows that, especially Jack. And I know this is hard to accept, but sometimes Vienna is actually right.",
        "Vienna: So Jack, he takes care of Carly. And you take care of Jack and we take care of you. It's the circle of life.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I love you guys. Thank you so much. All of the sudden, I don't feel quite so alone.",
        "Vienna: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Those are mine.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, right. Everybody hides their pre-natal vitamins near the tequila.",
        "Sofie: Sorry.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, this thing about me minding my own business -- it doesn't really work well when you have your mail sent here. You know, hide things from Cole where I work.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, I just -- I didn't know what else to do. I'll find someplace else for them.",
        "Aaron: What's up?",
        "Cole: I don't know, I was about to ask you the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Don't you think it's interesting that both my brother and I like music?",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Gwen: Well, that's what I'm saying. Like maybe -- maybe it's genetic. Except that the baby is going to have Alison's genes and she's more --",
        "Will: Don't go there.",
        "Gwen: I was going to say smart. Like you. Do you think I'm a hypocrite?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Good. Me, too.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: Because Sofie asked me to help my brother out with his music. And I'm the one who's always going, you know, on and on about family, et cetera. But you know, I didn't do it.",
        "Will: Ah.",
        "Gwen: That's what I was thinking about.",
        "Will: Right. And has he ever once acted like you guys were a family?",
        "Gwen: He was raised by Iris, too. Which makes opening up kind of hard.",
        "Will: You've managed.",
        "Gwen: Yes, but I'm a girl. Sofie says that he feels really bad about himself sometimes. I don't know, maybe I could have been more generous.",
        "Will: So, maybe you two could both hold his hand and encourage his music to help his self esteem. Or maybe he could just grow up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, what a surprise, you're going to gloat. So unlike you.",
        "Barbara: Gloat doesn't even come close. I'm glad I'm being Craig's personal Madame DeFarge. I'm going to savor every minute of it for what he has done to me, to my family. My children. My Jennifer.",
        "Meg: Well, what about Paul? Shouldn't he pay for what he did? I mean, he did everything he possibly could to keep Jennifer from finding out the truth about the babies.",
        "Barbara: Paul was wrong, but he was trying to protect his sister. Unlike Craig, he loves other people besides himself. Oh, I am so sorry. That was quite tactless of me to say that to the brand-new Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Meg: I'm sure it slipped out.",
        "Barbara: Why, Meg?",
        "Meg: Why, what?",
        "Barbara: Why do you stay with him? Well, you made mistakes, yes, we all have. But to sell yourself to him?",
        "Meg: Wonderful to see you, Barbara. Always a pleasure.",
        "Barbara: You know, Meg, I hope he goes to prison for lots of reasons. But one of them? So maybe you can save your soul. If you still have one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: And this is my fianc\u00e9e. His name's Paul Ryan. This is the woman he was going to marry. Her name's Meg Snyder, now Montgomery.",
        "Fellows: And you want to know that it's over.",
        "Rosanna: I want to know that it's over.",
        "Fellows: You know where he is now?",
        "Rosanna: I think he went to Old Town. I'm not sure why.",
        "Fellows: Then I'll find out for you. You will know one way or another before the end of the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, please, wait!",
        "Meg: Paul! Paul, just -- wait up. Okay, don't run away from me.",
        "Paul: You and I have nothing to talk about.",
        "Meg: I need to know something and I need to hear it from you. Okay, just one minute, please. One question, that's all I ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Well, Sofie's going to have his child. So that means, he or she will be my niece or nephew.",
        "Will: And you're single-handedly going to him into a great family guy.",
        "Gwen: Come on, Will, we are so lucky. All right, we have everything that we want. It just doesn't seem right if we don't at least attempt to reach out a little bit.",
        "Will: Yeah. Well, I'm glad we had this talk. Because we argue both sides and then you're just going to go and do exactly what you wanted to do in the first place, right?",
        "Gwen: Come on, you don't have to be mad at me about this.",
        "Will: No, I'm not mad. I just hope it goes better than the other times, complete disasters.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, what other times?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I don't have much. It's been kind of been slow tonight.",
        "Cole: I'm just going to Al's. I need to get out of that damn room.",
        "Sofie: Did you get any work done?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I finished a whole symphony this time. Do you really think it helps when you nag like this? What are you looking at?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "Cole: That guy's a jerk. I may be late tonight. Don't wait up, okay?",
        "Sofie: Thanks for not saying anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I wanted to tell you how happy I am about your recovery. And that you and Paul are together again.",
        "Rosanna: Wow, well, a lot can change in two years, can't it?",
        "Barbara: I have changed. I thought I'd lost Paul. And now I have him back. And he's with you and he's happy.",
        "Rosanna: So, you're happy that I'm back because I make Paul happy?",
        "Barbara: Of course.",
        "Rosanna: That's funny. Because I thought it might be because I'm the one person that could put Craig Montgomery back in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This hearing about Craig switching the babies, that's not really the point, is it?",
        "Paul: The judge seems to think so.",
        "Meg: Please, Paul, I need help. Just listen to me. If Craig switched those babies --",
        "Paul: If --",
        "Meg: Is he really that much worse than you and me? It's like you think you can gloss over what we did.",
        "Paul: Is he drugging you?",
        "Meg: Will you listen to me? If Craig did try and drive Rosanna off that road, if he did do it intentionally, he needs to pay for that.",
        "Paul: He can't be tried for the same crime twice.",
        "Meg: If he did try to kill Rosanna, he needs to pay for that and I don't care what the charge is.",
        "Paul: Meg, what do you want from me?",
        "Meg: I have to know, did Rosanna really remember that Craig did drive her off that road? Or did you get her to say that, to get Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm glad you're back.",
        "Jack: You look gorgeous.",
        "Katie: Thank you. Do you want to talk about it or not?",
        "Jack: Katie -- I have to go back.",
        "Katie: You know, if there's anything good in this horror story, it's that those kids have you.",
        "Jack: I am so sorry.",
        "Katie: Don't. We have our deal, remember? You worry about them, not me. I'm fine.",
        "Jack: It's not right, though. It's not fair.",
        "Katie: Jack, I have you. And we have time. It's more than fair. So you do what you need to do, take as much time you need. Don't worry about checking in with me. I want to hear you say it. Katie is fine.",
        "Jack: She's a hell of a lot more than that.",
        "Katie: Anything you need me to do, you just tell me, okay?",
        "Jack: Do you remember where you put the video camera?",
        "Katie: Uh, I think it's on the table over there. Why?",
        "Jack: She wanted to tape video messages for the kids.",
        "Katie: Now? I mean, it's fine, it's great. It's just -- after this day and all the awful things you had to go through --",
        "Jack: I think -- I think that she's afraid to go to sleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Wow, this place looks awesome. Hello, Cole. Do you mind if we sit down?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Then we'll apologize standing up.",
        "Cole: You don't have to apologize for your opinions. You think my music sucks. I think you're arrogant and you're full of --",
        "Will: Okay, we're leaving.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. Listen, okay. Time out. Listen to me, all right? I'm sorry that I wasn't more helpful to you, and I'm going to try to do that right now.",
        "Cole: Oh, you're going to help me now? How?",
        "Gwen: I have a friend, he is a good composer. And I'm going to give him your music to listen to so he can --",
        "Cole: Oh, no, let me guess. So he can tell me what's wrong with it.",
        "Gwen: No, so he can tell you how to make it more commercial.",
        "Cole: Oh, like your string of number-one hits, right?",
        "Will: Gwen, you tried --",
        "Cole: See, my mommy wasn't around to get me a studio.",
        "Will: Well, gee, you're whining. That's new.",
        "Cole: Do you want to go outside? Do you want to take it outside?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. Are you kidding? Sit down. Sit down. Just give me a minute, okay?",
        "Will: I'm not going to leave you alone with him.",
        "Gwen: Please. This is my brother. Just let me try to work this out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: There's one thing that's standing between you and what you want. So, you and Paul can get married, Lucy can bring Johnny home.",
        "Rosanna: And we can all live happily ever after.",
        "Barbara: That's right, Rosanna. It's all up to you. So I'll see you tomorrow. In court. And get some rest, you look a little tired.",
        "Rosanna: So I solve all of your problems and all of Paul's problems. And then what does he do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Every word that Rosanna says about Craig is true.",
        "Meg: She knows what you want to hear, Paul. Have you ever noticed sometimes women do what you want them to do?",
        "Paul: Look, fine, you'll see for yourself tomorrow when Rosanna gets on the stand. You can see for yourself that she's telling the truth. And then maybe you'll figure out what kind of a monster you've married.",
        "Meg: You know why I married him. And you know who I really loved when I married him.",
        "Paul: And I know who you're still living with. And sleeping with.",
        "Meg: Well, you know, sometimes when you know who you want more than anyone in this entire world, and it's made quite clear to you that you can never, ever have him, you sometimes make bad decisions.",
        "Paul: Meg, you know who he is, and you know the things that he's done. Why can't you just walk away?",
        "Meg: If I walk away, what am I walking towards?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's late. I had no right to ask you to do this.",
        "Jack: No, it's all set up. I think you're going to want to do this when the kids are asleep, no?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: Well, thanks.",
        "Jack: No, I mean, if you don't want to, I can do it some other time.",
        "Carly: No, you're right. It's a good time.",
        "Jack: Okay. Have a seat.",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Be honest. Do I look okay?",
        "Jack: You look great.",
        "Carly: So Sage, 16, huh? Happy birthday. And you know I wouldn't be me, if I didn't have some advice for you. Not that I'm very worried about you. It turns out you have lots of women in your life that you can count on. Rosanna and Gwen and -- Lily and Emma, and those Snyder women. Lots of common sense there. And Katie. She's got her head screwed on straight and she's in your corner. Good she's there. Now, about your father. I think the first thing in the world you did was hold up your little finger so he could wrap himself around it. The man has been and will always be crazy about you. And the best advice I can give you, is try to be like him when you can. Watch out for the other guy. Think about what's right and what's wrong. Tell the truth. Do those things that were never second nature to me. 16! Have some fun! Break some hearts. Give your brothers a hard time. Believe me, you have so much to look forward to.",

Since the day Craig came back, you hating him has always been and always will be more important than you loving me. You came back from the dead, not to find me, but to get him.

        "Carly: Jack! Hi. I just had this awful dream. You were in trouble and you needed my help. Which is sort of funny, considering all the times that my help actually messed things up. Anyway, in the dream, it was that -- that thing when you're trying to scream, but you can't make a sound. And you can't move, you're just -- stuck there, watching. Sort of like my life now. So, this diagnosis, it takes my emotions and turns the dial up to ten. I am so scared that everything is going to mean too much, when it was the times that we were together, sort of doing nothing, hanging out, that always made me the happiest. Well, if you're watching this, and I'm gone, there's something that I want you to know. Something that I need you to know. I love you. I love you so much. I'm glad you're with Katie, Jack. I want you to be happy. Be really happy together. Because that's what I want for you, to have a really happy life.",

Now, I suppose a reasonable man might take the plea bargain, but I won't. That could mean jail time. That could mean time away from you. That would delay us starting a family. And I'm not giving that up. Not without a fight.",
