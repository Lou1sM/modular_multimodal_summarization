        "Brad still wrestles with how to handle Liberty's pregnancy. Janet interrupts them to tell them after the fact that her uncle set up Liberty with a couple that wants to adopt her baby. At first, Brad isn't happy, but Katie is able to calm him down. Liberty wants Parker to go with her to the appointment. Jack isn't sure, but they are both able to convince him. Later, Janet and Brad separately both have misgivings about Liberty handling this without them and vow to show up at the meeting. Meanwhile, Paul and Emily are nervous about their meeting with a pregnant mother-to-be; Paul secretly admits to lying on the application, but Emily is more concerned about how this is going to play out with them as potential parents. Paul allays her fears. Craig and Rosanna are in another heated argument after Craig kisses Rosanna, but the argument is interrupted when Craig gets a call that Johnny has been hurt and is at the hospital. When Rosanna sees his reaction, she offers to drive him. Rosanna is able to calm Craig down, as he lashes out at the babysitter and doctors after admitting to worrying Johnny will die like Bryant. Rosanna is touched by this side of Craig and agrees to stay with him after Craig asks. Rosanna and Craig actually are able to enjoy each other's company, as they try to make Johnny feel better, as he gets stitched up. Craig appears vulnerable to Rosanna, as he needs her and Rosanna is moved by this side of him and can't help but be affected. They take Johnny home together. Liberty is overwhelmed when Janet, Jack, Brad and Katie show up at her meeting and everyone is even more shocked when Paul and Emily show up at the adoption meeting. Jack and Brad won't have it and loudly voice their opinions. Liberty can't take all of this and rushes out. Later, Liberty asks Parker about Paul and Emily's past. She decides to talk to them. After she does, Liberty is affected and appreciates Paul and Emily's candor; she goes to tell her mom that she made a decision. Janet is worried she is going to have an abortion because of how they all acted, but she is even more stunned when Liberty announces she wants Paul and Emily to adopt her baby. Meanwhile, Paul and Emily celebrate the possibility of their growing family. Rosanna sings Johnny to sleep, as Craig watches how maternal she is with him. Craig walks in, as Rosanna is changing out of her shirt, which leads to some awkwardness. Later though, after complimenting each other on how they were today, they wind up in an embrace that leads to a kiss."

        "Katie: Brad, the crib and dresser we wanted is on sale this week. Look. Hey, hello? Furniture.",
        "Brad: Yes, yes. I see. Yeah, this week. I hear you. Okay, answer me this. What the heck is that? It looks like the baby's on a bungee cord or something.",
        "Katie: I know, I know. I've seen these. You hang it from the doorway, and the baby uses its legs to bounce around. It's cute.",
        "Brad: It's expensive. All this stuff is so expensive.",
        "Katie: Well, that's okay. You're working now. We can afford it.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but can Liberty? I mean, who knew that babies need all this stuff? I mean, she's gonna need somebody to look after the baby 24/7. It's gonna be bungee jumping. I mean, how is she gonna do that and go to college?",
        "Katie: Hey, hey, if she decides to keep the baby, we will help her.",
        "Brad: I just still think that she should end the pregnancy like she planned. Okay, I'm gonna call her.",
        "Katie: No, I thought you and Janet decided to let Liberty make up her own mind.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, it doesn't mean I can't help her do that.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Brad: Hey, what are you doing here? Did something happen to Liberty?",
        "Janet: Yep. I've got news. Hi, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey, Janet.",
        "Brad: Did she make a decision about the baby?",
        "Janet: Everything is taken care of.",
        "Brad: You let her go through with the abortion?",
        "Janet: Bradley, its good news. We found a couple to adopt the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hi, Dad.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Jack: Liberty, I thought you had your appointment today.",
        "Liberty: I still have a while before I have to meet with the lawyer.",
        "Jack: Oh. So you're okay with the adoption?",
        "Liberty: Getting there. But Parker and I still have to meet with the actual couple who's thinking about adopting the baby.",
        "Jack: Wait, wait. Wait a second. Parker's not gonna go with you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I am.",
        "Jack: No, Parker. You're not the father. This whole adoption thing is none of your business.",
        "Liberty: I need him there, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Liberty: For a second opinion. I mean, these people could be raising the baby. I don't want to mess up or anything.",
        "Jack: Well, I understand that, Liberty, but this is really inappropriate. Don't you see that?",
        "Liberty: Jack, if he's not going, I'm not gonna go, either. I need him there.",
        "Parker: Dad, if you turn her down, you're gonna have one really, really angry wife.",
        "Jack: Liberty, do you mind letting me talk to Parker for a minute?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Okay, but, I meant what I said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: This baby will be very lucky to have you as parents. I'll see you at the meeting.",
        "Paul: Thanks. I'll see you there.",
        "Emily: Thank you. I cannot believe that. I cannot believe our application was accepted. We have been to jail. We've both been to jail.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but, you know, usually not for long.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? It doesn't matter how long. Especially when you're auditioning to be a mother and a father.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, you know, the thing about those applications is that they're kind of open to interpretation.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Did you lie?",
        "Paul: Ahh, basically.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What was that?",
        "Craig: I had to find some way of shutting you up.",
        "Rosanna: That's the way you go about shutting people up?",
        "Craig: When I'm sick of them criticizing me and misjudging me, yes.",
        "Rosanna: So ridiculous! That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I point out how inappropriate it is of you to be cavorting with the likes of Audrey Coleman --",
        "Craig: I wasn't cavorting. I had a couple of drinks.",
        "Rosanna: Did you happen to mention to that woman that you are engaged to my sister?",
        "Craig: As a matter of fact, I did. We spoke at length about Carly.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, of course you did. Typical Craig. Answer for everything. Why don't you tell me this? Convince me, all right, that that kiss was some way of showing loyalty to my sister.",
        "Craig: That kiss had nothing to do with Carly.",
        "Rosanna: You think? That's pretty obvious.",
        "Craig: Oh, all right, all right. Let's just forget it. It never happened, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Great, fine. Sure. No problem. I've had plenty of practice forgetting everything about you, you pig!",
        "Craig: Well, back at you, sister. I can't believe I was stupid enough to ever marry you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can. At least I was smart enough to divorce you. Please go!",
        "Craig: Happily.",
        "Rosanna: What? Why are you still here?",
        "Craig: You have my keys.",
        "Rosanna: I cannot believe that I was so concerned about you that I wouldn't let you drive drunk.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm stone-cold sober now. Boy, you're a buzz kill. You know that?",
        "Rosanna: I was looking out for my sister! Somebody has to, considering you only think about yourself!",
        "Craig: It's been years since we were married, Rosanna!",
        "Rosanna: So what? What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Craig: Why do you keep treating me as if no time has passed? I have evolved. I'm a better person now. Why don't you give me just a little credit?",
        "Rosanna: Really? You're a better person? How about no, I don't think so?",
        "Craig: All right, then give me -- just give me my keys. Please, give me my --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rosanna: You want your keys? Put them here. Put them wherever you want. How about that?",
        "Craig: What? Maggie, you're talking too fast. Is that Johnny crying? You -- what? No! Go straight to the hospital! I'll meet you there!",
        "Rosanna: What happened?",
        "Craig: Johnny. He fell down in the playground. I don't have time for this! Where are my keys? Give me my damn keys!",
        "Rosanna: Craig, they're in your hand. You okay?",
        "Craig: I have to get to the hospital.",
        "Rosanna: You know what? Here. Let me take my keys. I will drive you. Okay? All right. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Give him to me.",
        "Maggie: I am so sorry, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Oh, Johnny.",
        "Maggie: The nurse said to put him in here.",
        "Craig: Okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Daddy's here. I'm gonna make sure that the doctors and the nurses take real good care of you, okay?",
        "Nurse: If you'll all step outside. We need a few minutes alone with --",
        "Craig: Johnny. His name's Johnny.",
        "Nurse: We'll clean Johnny up and assess the damage.",
        "Craig: Why can't I be with him?",
        "Nurse: You can, as soon as the doctor's done with him.",
        "Craig: Okay. Johnny, I'm gonna be right outside, okay? I'm gonna be right here. What the hell did you do to my son?",
        "Maggie: I only looked away for a minute.",
        "Craig: You're not supposed to look away for a second. He's my son. He's my only surviving son. I pay you to watch him. What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Rosanna: Okay, okay, okay. Calm down, all right? I'm sure that Maggie is very, very sorry for what happened. It was just an accident.",
        "Craig: My son Bryant was in an accident. I saw the car right after the accident, and there was hardly any damage. He was talking when they brought him into the hospital! And then he died.",
        "Rosanna: Johnny's not gonna die, okay? We won't let him. You won't let him, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on, everybody lies on their adoption applications.",
        "Emily: Oh, really? And we would know this how?",
        "Paul: Because if nobody lied, they'd never let anybody be parents.",
        "Emily: It's just that one minute, we're thinking about adopting -- just thinking. And the next minute, we're meeting the birth mother? This is just happening too fast.",
        "Paul: Okay. You know, if you're having second thoughts about us adopting --",
        "Emily: I'm not having second thoughts about us, I swear. You -- I think you're an amazing father. You're gonna be an amazing father.",
        "Paul: So then what?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Nothing. I'm just being silly. I'm really nervous about all this. But I am on board. I'm totally on board, I swear. All systems go. Can we just go inside and finish our cup of coffee before we go meet our perfect --",
        "Paul: Sure. Last thing I want to do is rush you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker, if you and Liberty aren't involved, what is the point?",
        "Parker: I know you think that Liberty has a bunch of people helping her right now, but she feels alone, okay? And this adoption thing -- I mean, she's scared half to death that she's gonna give the baby to the wrong people. So I'm trying to make it so that she doesn't have to go through this thing by herself. I mean, didn't you raise me not to turn my back on my friends?",
        "Jack: Oh, that's not fair, throwing my superb parenting in my face.",
        "Parker: Whatever works.",
        "Liberty: So, what's going on? Is it okay for Parker to come with me?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Liberty: Thank you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Listen, don't get crazy about this, all right? Everything's gonna work out.",
        "Liberty: You know, that's exactly what Parker keeps saying. But can we go before I change my mind? Thanks, Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Why am I always the last one to know what's going on with my daughter?",
        "Janet: Hey, I came to tell you as soon as I found out.",
        "Brad: You had to take some time to find a lawyer, and then they had to go out -- the lawyer had to go out and find people that were willing --",
        "Janet: My Uncle Ralph called the lawyer earlier today. Here. You want his card? Here. Take the card.",
        "Brad: How'd he find the couple so fast?",
        "Janet: I don't know. This is what the lawyer does. He probably has a list of names. I'm not keeping you out of the loop on purpose, Bradley.",
        "Katie: I think you owe Janet an apology.",
        "Brad: Sorry.",
        "Janet: You have any other questions?",
        "Brad: Yeah. I want to know why you're so excited about this, why you think it's such a great idea.",
        "Katie: I thought we all talked about this.",
        "Brad: You know, I have tried to look at the upside. I really -- I have. Do you know how this is going to affect -- do you know what this is gonna do to her?",
        "Janet: Liberty is making up her own mind, okay? But I have not kept it a secret that I am very happy about this. I'm very happy that she is meeting with this couple today.",
        "Brad: Today? Why didn't you tell me that it was today?",
        "Janet: I'm telling you now.",
        "Brad: Well, when?",
        "Janet: About an hour.",
        "Brad: Are you gonna be there?",
        "Janet: As much as it pains me, no, I am not going to be there. I'm gonna let Liberty handle this herself.",
        "Katie: Well, thank you so much for coming by and keeping us in the loop.",
        "Janet: You're welcome. Bradley, you're the one who told us that we all have to work together on this. And you were right about that, okay? Just remember that.",
        "Brad: I will. Thank you, Janet.",
        "Katie: You know, if Liberty decides to do this, you have to respect that.",
        "Brad: I just keep thinking of my little girl with a big, pregnant belly on graduation day, and everybody looking at her, and just talking about her.",
        "Katie: I know. But that may be your problem, not Liberty's. Maybe she's made peace with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey. How'd things go at Brad and Katie's?",
        "Janet: To be expected. Bradley is so negative about this adoption thing.",
        "Jack: He'll come around, Honey.",
        "Janet: Well, at least Katie's on our side. Is Liberty upstairs?",
        "Jack: No. She already went to her appointment with Parker.",
        "Janet: Why did Parker go with her?",
        "Jack: Liberty insisted. I tried to talk her out of it, but she was nervous. She really wants him there to give her a second opinion about this couple.",
        "Janet: Huh.",
        "Jack: What? What's wrong?",
        "Janet: Something Bradley said. \"We will be handing over our grandchild to total strangers.\"",
        "Jack: Honey, by the time the baby gets here, they're not gonna be strangers anymore.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but they are today. I totally get why Liberty would want a second opinion. You know, this is a big, huge decision. And it shouldn't be one that Parker is helping her make. It should be me.",
        "Jack: Okay, so are you gonna go to this meeting or something?",
        "Janet: Hell yeah, I'm going.",
        "Jack: Okay, then I'll -- I'll drive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Liberty's not some delicate little girl. She's very strong. She can make up her own mind.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but who are these people? I don't know them. And I hate that Janet only tells me what she wants me to know. Look, I'll call you later, okay?",
        "Katie: Oh, you are not even thinking about going to that meeting, please?",
        "Brad: I've got to. I've got to check out these adoptive parents. I owe it to my daughter.",
        "Katie: Janet warned you, though. Liberty is going to hate that you're butting in.",
        "Brad: So she'll hate me. I can't let her do this alone.",
        "Katie: Is there anything I can say to stop you?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Katie: Then I'm coming, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What do you mean you can't? My son is in pain. He's bleeding. Now do something!",
        "Rosanna: Hello. What's going on here?",
        "Craig: This idiot refuses to do his job.",
        "Resident: I was telling Mr. Montgomery I could stitch Johnny up, but he's better off with a plastic surgeon.",
        "Craig: Then get one in here.",
        "Resident: He's on his way.",
        "Craig: From where? Nova Scotia? Now, my son is in pain. Now, you either do something right now, or I swear --",
        "Rosanna: Craig, will you just calm down for a second? I mean, you're not helping anything, and you're probably upsetting Johnny.",
        "Craig: The doctor says that Johnny might have a concussion, which is why he won't give him any anesthetic now.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, all right. Well then, what can we do?",
        "Resident: Just wait for the plastic surgeon, and page me if you notice any altered behavior.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thank you very much. Craig, it's gonna be okay. Really, I know this is frustrating.",
        "Craig: Frustrating? This is hell. Which is why I wanted to pummel poor Maggie.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't worry about that. I dried her tears and sent her home.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, everything's gonna be okay, Craig. Johnny's gonna be fine, really. So I just came by to let you know that I'm leaving.",
        "Craig: What? Why?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I mean, Johnny's been evaluated and everything, and I just thought I'd get out of your way.",
        "Craig: You're not in the way. No, no, no. Stay. Please, stay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Johnny: My head hurts.",
        "Rosanna: Aww. Oh. You know, sometimes coloring can make my head hurt, too. Why don't we do something else?",
        "Craig: Something else?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Why don't we play a game?",
        "Craig: Hey, okay. You want to play ticktacktoe?",
        "Johnny: I don't feel like it.",
        "Craig: Okay. Go fish? Old maid?",
        "Rosanna: How about charades?",
        "Craig: Isn't that a little advanced?",
        "Rosanna: No, not for a smart kid like Johnny. Do you know how to play charades? Well, guess what? I will teach you.",
        "Craig: I'm not so sure he's up for this.",
        "Rosanna: It will be fun. Relax yourself, will ya? Now here's how it works. You whisper something in my ear, something that you want me to be, like an animal or a person you know or a movie. And I'll act it out, and your daddy is gonna have to guess what it is. Okay? Okay, now whisper in my ear. Come up with something.",
        "[Johnny whispers]",
        "Rosanna: That's a good one. Okay. Ready? Get your guesser going.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Craig: Butterfly?",
        "Rosanna: Yay!",
        "Craig: Hey! I got that right?",
        "Rosanna: Good job. Okay, now it's your turn.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay. Do you have an animal I can do? Okay.",
        "[Johnny whispers]",
        "Craig: Oh. Excellent. All right.",
        "Rosanna: Two words.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Craig growls]",
        "Rosanna: Hmm -- mouse?",
        "[Craig growling]",
        "Rosanna: Mighty mouse? Angry crocodile? Baby chick? Angry chicken? Crazy --",
        "Craig: Have you never seen a grizzly bear before?",
        "Rosanna: Grizzly bear? That was a grizzly bear? That was a pretty wimpy grizzly bear.",
        "[Craig growls]",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Stop! Don't. He's eating me! Help!",
        "Craig: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Well, I didn't exactly think we'd be the first ones here.",
        "Parker: We can go wait in the lobby if you want to.",
        "Liberty: No. I feel my freak-out coming on. I'd rather do it in private.",
        "Parker: Libby, it's gonna be okay.",
        "Liberty: I shouldn't be here. This isn't what I want.",
        "Parker: Okay, then let's go.",
        "Liberty: You're the best, Parker. You're with me with whatever decision I make.",
        "Parker: It's because I know you.",
        "Liberty: Then tell me, what am I doing here?",
        "Parker: Well, you like to think that you're really independent, you don't really care about anybody else, but you do. Like with your mom, I mean. You don't want to hurt her.",
        "Liberty: The baby.",
        "Parker: You don't want to hurt the baby, either.",
        "Liberty: But if I get an abortion --",
        "Parker: If you get an abortion, it's because you have decided that the baby would be better off if it was born to you, just at a different time.",
        "Liberty: It's so hard taking care of someone I've never met and predicting what their life would be like, with me or without me or with these random people who I didn't even know.",
        "Parker: You're gonna do fine. And please, just try to relax. If these people weren't already anxious to have a baby, I mean, they wouldn't even be considering having an adoption.",
        "Liberty: I want them to like me -- in case they're perfect for the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey, you know what? Wait a minute. Why don't we stop and get a burger first? I'm kind of hungry.",
        "Paul: See, now I know you're stalling.",
        "Emily: I am.",
        "Paul: You're that nervous, huh?",
        "Emily: Me, nervous? Multiply that by like a million times. That's what I am.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Emily: Why? Because we're gonna walk into that room, and we're gonna be judged. Some teenager gets to decide if we qualify as parents.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but we get to judge the teenager, too. And if she's not up to our standards, then we find another teenage mom. And the world is full of --",
        "Emily: And we keep looking until we find one? That sounds exhausting, not to mention heartbreaking.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but at the end of the day, that's heaven. That's worth it, right?",
        "Emily: Right.",
        "Paul: You want my opinion? I think the baby would be happy to have us as parents. If this girl has any brains at all, she'll see that right away, right after she gives us demerits for being tardy. Ready?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Let's go get our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Mom, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here.",
        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie. I know you don't think you need me, but you really do, because this is such a big decision. I am here to support you.",
        "Liberty: Okay. What about Jack, huh? Jack, are you here to support me, too?",
        "Jack: I'm just here to keep Parker company while the two of you are in your meeting.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Brad: What are you doing here?",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Sorry, Liberty. I tried to keep him away.",
        "Brad: Yeah, no, it's a good thing. It's just like I thought. You and Jack are trying to run the show.",
        "Janet: Oh --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, this is a disaster.",
        "Jack: We're not trying to run anything. Liberty is Janet's daughter. She felt that she needed to be here for her. That's as simple as that.",
        "Brad: What about you? You told me that you weren't coming to the meeting? What was that about? I mean, what, did you just want to keep me away so you can brainwash our daughter?",
        "Janet: No. This is a very big decision for Liberty. I didn't think she should have a million people watching her while she made it.",
        "Katie: Let's just all calm down a little bit? This couple's gonna be here any minute. We don't want them to walk in and see us yelling like crazy people.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's exactly -- that's a good idea.",
        "[All talking]",
        "Emily: Whoa. Are you -- are you sure you want to go in there?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Sounds like a hockey game.",
        "Janet: No, wait, Sweetheart. Don't.",
        "Liberty: Mom, let me go. I'm serious.",
        "Janet: Just a minute.",
        "Jack: Hey, guys. I know it doesn't sound like it, but we're about to have a meeting in here.",
        "Emily: So are we.",
        "Liberty: Are you the couple that wants to adopt my baby?",
        "Jack: No way in hell.",
        "Lawyer: What's going on in here?",
        "Paul: Not sure.",
        "Jack: No, I'm sure. Nothing's going on, because there's no way that Liberty is gonna give her baby to Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart.",
        "Paul: I don't think you have anything to say about it.",
        "Brad: Well, seeing how I'm Liberty's dad, I have something to say about it. Are you nuts?",
        "Paul: Not anymore.",
        "Janet: Are you two even married?",
        "Emily: Yes. As a matter of fact, we are. And believe me when I tell all of you, we had no idea that Liberty was the girl we were coming to meet. This is not a good idea.",
        "Jack: You better believe it's not. How did you two even make it past the application stage?",
        "Brad: You're the lawyer, right? I mean, did this guy put on his applications how many times he tried to kidnap his own daughter?",
        "Jack: Listen, Emily, didn't you shoot him once?",
        "Paul: Nobody's perfect.",
        "Brad: Do you think this is funny?",
        "Paul: No, you know what? I don't think it's funny. You are insulting me. And you're insulting my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Farber: Let me guess. Giraffe, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yes! See?",
        "Craig: Oh, who knew? I'm Craig Montgomery. You are?",
        "Dr. Farber: Dr. Farber.",
        "Craig: Ah.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, the plastic surgeon. There we go.",
        "Craig: Finally.",
        "Dr. Farber: I apologize for keeping you waiting. You must be Johnny. It's nice to meet you. Can I talk to you outside?",
        "Craig: I'll be right outside, okay? Rosanna, you coming?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Dr. Farber: Johnny's cut is very deep. I can stitch it up, but unfortunately, it's going to be as hard on the two of you as it is on Johnny.",
        "Rosanna: Why is that?",
        "Dr. Farber: Johnny might have a concussion, and because of that, I can't use an anesthetic.",
        "Craig: You want to poke needles in my son's face without giving him anything for the pain?",
        "Dr. Farber: We'll use a local anesthetic for the pain. But he might be scared.",
        "Rosanna: Well, can't you wait until you're sure Johnny doesn't have a concussion until you give him the stitches?",
        "Dr. Farber: We run the risk of infection and scarring. And besides that, I'm due in surgery in a few minutes. I'm gonna be tied up for several hours.",
        "Craig: Johnny's gonna be terrified.",
        "Dr. Farber: That's why I need the two of you to reassure him and to try to keep him still. Can I count on you?",
        "Rosanna: Of course. Yes, we can handle it.",
        "Dr. Farber: Good. Then please join me.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Are you sure you're up for this?",
        "Craig: I'm pretty sure I'm not.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, Craig, listen to me, all right? You're gonna be fine. You love that boy, and he needs you to be a rock right now.",
        "Craig: Rock. Right. Got it.",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Craig: With your help.",
        "Rosanna: Of course, of course.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: I've heard enough. This meeting is over.",
        "Emily: Let's go.",
        "Paul: Wait a minute. Hold on a second. We have heard from everyone but the mother of the child. I for one would like to hear what Liberty has to say.",
        "Brad: You don't have to say anything to these people.",
        "Emily: Just -- is there anything you want to ask us?",
        "Liberty: I don't know if I can do this or if I want to. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Farber: Okay, are you ready?",
        "Craig: All right, buddy. Remember, I said this is gonna hurt. But it's only gonna hurt for a little while, okay? Oh. I know, I know. No. You're being so brave. And I'm very proud of you. I know. That's a big one. Try and sit. Try and stay still. Try and stay still. Daddy's here, and I love you very much, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Boy, wait till I give Uncle Ralph an earful about that lawyer. He totally messed up this adoption.",
        "Paul: He just set the meeting up. It didn't get messed up until you all attacked us.",
        "Brad: You see? This is why I was against adoption. You know, you never know what kind of wackos are gonna show up and try to take your kid.",
        "Emily: This is exactly what I was hoping to avoid. Can we please just go home?",
        "Paul: Yes, in a minute. Aren't you all judgmental? You know, it's too bad the Snyders didn't have to fill up questionnaires before they have children. 'Cause frankly, you're all far from perfect.",
        "Katie: Well, if you wanted to turn Liberty off to the idea of adoption, you did a hell of a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Farber: You can take Johnny home now.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Farber: You are a very brave boy, and your forehead's gonna be as good as new. [Whispering] You did a good job. So did you, Mom and Dad.",
        "Craig: If he only knew. Okay. Let's go home.",
        "Johnny: Can Rosanna come?",
        "Craig: Well, that's up to her.",
        "Rosanna: How can I turn down an invitation from my favorite boy?",
        "Craig: All right. Let's go. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So then, what's the deal with Paul and Emily? Are they really that horrible?",
        "Parker: Paul has done some pretty weird things in the past, like kidnapping Meg's baby. But I mean, Eliza is his baby, too. And he seemed very sorry about it.",
        "Liberty: Didn't you and Paul used to be friends?",
        "Parker: Yeah. We still are.",
        "Liberty: How did that happen?",
        "Parker: Well, you remember when my mom took off with that guy, Simon? It kind of messed with my head a little bit. And I hung out with Paul a lot, and he was really cool.",
        "Liberty: Okay. And then, what about Emily?",
        "Parker: I don't really know that much about her. I think that she helped out my sister Jennifer while Johnny was sick as a baby, but --",
        "Liberty: They don't sound so horrible. Parker, God, I wish everyone would have just shut up so I could hear why they wanted the baby.",
        "Parker: Maybe it's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You're putting her through a lot of heartache, don't you think?",
        "Jack: Back off, Brad.",
        "Brad: Can't you see that? Or wait. Are you just biding your time until it's just too late for her to have any other option?",
        "Katie: Hold on. You guys, just stop arguing. Go find your daughter. You owe her an apology.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Sorry to just drop in, but I told Liberty you guys wouldn't --",
        "Paul: Come on in.",
        "Emily: Can I get you guys something to eat or drink?",
        "Parker: We just ate. Thank you.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Paul: What can we do for you?",
        "Liberty: We never got to hear why you and Emily want to adopt my baby.",
        "Emily: Wait. There's a -- you might actually give us a chance to adopt your baby?",
        "Liberty: Well, I don't want to get your hopes up or anything, 'cause I'm still not sure what I want to do. But if you tell me why --",
        "Paul: It might help with your decision. You first.",
        "Emily: You go first.",
        "Paul: Okay. Here, sit down.",
        "Parker: Maybe you could start by explaining why you kidnapped Eliza. I mean, it was a creepy thing to do.",
        "Paul: Emily and I were involved a few years ago, and we lost our baby.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: And I think it made me very overprotective. And so when I thought that Meg was taking Eliza away from me, I didn't want to put myself through anything like that again, so I did the wrong thing.",
        "Liberty: Well, what if something like that happened again?",
        "Paul: I don't think it will. And Meg doesn't, either. I'm spending more time with Eliza than ever.",
        "Liberty: What changed you?",
        "Paul: A number of things. Look, when I look into my little girl's eyes, I can see that Eliza trusts me, and I don't want to disappoint her. I want to be a good person for her, and for any other child that Emily and I are lucky enough to share.",
        "Emily: Oh, okay. It's my turn. Okay.",
        "Liberty: No, you don't have to tell me anything you don't want, really. I hate when people ask me about my pregnancy and what I'm gonna do.",
        "Emily: I know. It's really tough talking about mistakes, isn't it?",
        "Liberty: It's the worst.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know. The worst mistake I've ever made was having surgery so I wouldn't get pregnant again. Yeah.",
        "Liberty: If you don't want to have kids then --",
        "Emily: No, I didn't want to have kids at that moment. And then I changed my mind, and it was too late. And it was a really, really stupid decision.",
        "Liberty: Well, would you be a good mother?",
        "Emily: I haven't always been. Probably not the answer you wanted.",
        "Liberty: No. I just want to hear the truth.",
        "Emily: Well, the truth is, if you do this for us, if you -- if you let us adopt your child, I will be the best mother I could possibly be.",
        "Liberty: I'm just not sure.",
        "Paul: About us?",
        "Liberty: About carrying a baby for nine months and then giving it away, about all of this.",
        "Emily: Honey, I understand. Believe me, I understand. If you do this for us, if you let us adopt her, or him, we -- people can say whatever they want about me and Paul, but -- we will love this child and honor it and love it with all of our hearts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, you must be pretty tired, huh?",
        "Johnny: Can we play charades again?",
        "Craig: Not tonight, buddy.",
        "Rosanna: How about I sing you a song, okay? Maybe that'll help you feel sleepy.",
        "Craig: That's a great idea. And I'll get you something dry to wear. Your blouse is soaked.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. That submarine game in the bath was pretty entertaining.",
        "Craig: I'll be right back.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Here you go. Why don't you lean on me like this, hmm? Okay.",
        "Craig: I'll just get him into bed. Come on, buddy.",
        "Rosanna: Good night, beautiful boy.",
        "Craig: Okay.",

        "Katie: We should have never gone to that meeting.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. I admit it. I lost it, with a little help from my brother. But I am not sorry that the adoption fell through.",
        "Katie: How can you say that? If you truly loved your daughter, you would want her --",
        "Brad: This is not what Liberty wants. This is all Janet.",
        "Katie: Liberty went to that meeting on her own.",
        "Brad: That is because she's such a sweet kid, she feels like she owes the world to her mom. If I gotta take her to that clinic in Chicago by myself, I will. Because that's what I should have done in the first place, because I know that's exactly what she wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, Sweetie, are you okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine.",
        "Janet: I am so sorry we bombarded you like that. I promise, next time, I will do better.",
        "Liberty: There won't be a next time, Mom.",
        "Janet: Oh, please don't tell me you're thinking about abortion again. Because I really think you should give adoption another chance.",
        "Liberty: I have made my choice, Mom. I've decided to give the baby to Emily and Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, the best thing about adopting so far is that an expecting mother can still get drunk.",
        "Emily: Well, that's definitely reason to celebrate. You really think this is gonna happen?",
        "Paul: Come on. Why not? Liberty strikes me as somebody who will keep her word.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I think she'll try. But as soon as Jack and Janet find out, they're gonna blow a gasket.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no, no. Sweetie, stop. Stop. Will you stop? We are not gonna worry about Jack and Janet, or anybody else in Oakdale that wants to judge us for our mistakes.",
        "Emily: No, we're not.",
        "Paul: No. We are only gonna think about our future and our family together.",
        "Emily: To new beginnings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm sorry. I didn't intend to walk in on you like that.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's okay. My shirt just needs to dry so I can wear it home.",
        "Craig: No, it's all right. Just take mine. I'll send yours to the cleaners tomorrow.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. You know what? It's okay. I got it. I can do that. Thank you very much. Good night.",
        "Craig: Stay?",
        "Rosanna: Seems to be your favorite word tonight.",
        "Craig: Well, if it works --",
        "Rosanna: Last time, you added a please.",
        "Craig: Please stay. Have some more of that cocoa you made.",
        "Rosanna: Well, all right. If you insist. Little too tired to leave anyway.",
        "Craig: I know what you mean. This day feels like it was two years long.",
        "Rosanna: Mm.",
        "Craig: You know, I'm sure something like this happened to me before with Bryant or Lucy when they were small, but I just don't remember.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe you blocked it out.",
        "Craig: Maybe I was just too scared this time, knowing what I have to lose now.",
        "Rosanna: Some things are easier to get over than others. You know, I used to imagine us as parents and, you know, what it would be like if something like this happened. You know, whether we'd work together as a team, helping to take care of our child. But we just never got the chance.",
        "Craig: No, we didn't. You were terrific today.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Really, so were you.",
        "Craig: No, no. It was all you. I couldn't have gotten through this without you. Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Sure.",

        "Rosanna: Why did we do this? What did we get ourselves into?",
        "Jack: Maybe I should go talk to Liberty?",
