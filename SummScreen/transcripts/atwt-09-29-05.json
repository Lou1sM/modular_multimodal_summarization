        "Katie: How did this happen?",
        "Mike: How did what happen?",
        "Katie: Well, not only do we have the cottage to ourselves finally -- no Maddie, no Henry -- but we get to work together.",
        "Mike: I guess we must've done something right in a previous life. Better pretend to at least get to work.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Well, why don't you get out your calculator and figure out how many hours it is until lunch.",
        "P.A.: Can I help you?",
        "Mike: Yeah, as a matter of fact, you can. Actually, I'm gonna be working on some set designs and I need a place to lay out some drawings. And a handful of pencils.",
        "P.A.: Well, you can work over there, and I'll send someone over to bring some pencils.",
        "Katie: Oh, is Kim in her office?",
        "P.A.: No, she's not coming in until this afternoon.",
        "Mike: I thought you had a meeting.",
        "Katie: So did I.",
        "Mike: Maybe she forgot.",
        "Katie: Well, that's not like her to forget.",
        "B.J.: Hey. Mike, how are you? Katie, you're right on time. And no, Kim didn't forget. Your meeting's with me.",
        "Katie: Oh. Oh, okay.",
        "Mike: We'll do lunch.",
        "Katie: We will.",
        "Maddie: Who needed the pencils? No.",
        "Mike: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Barbara: Well, hi! It's been a while. You certainly are chipper.",
        "Paul: Sure. Why not?",
        "Barbara: Why not? Because your sister's in a psychiatric hospital. And the more I think about it, the madder I get.",
        "Paul: Well, then don't think about it.",
        "Barbara: She's locked up in confinement because she's refused to help herself, and I begged her. I begged her, just please pretend, pretend that you're okay. Just tell the doctors what they want to hear.",
        "Paul: Things have changed since you've seen her.",
        "Barbara: Changed? What do you mean, changed?",
        "Paul: Everything's gonna be okay. She knows that her baby is gone. And she knows that the baby that the Snyders are raising is in the right place. She's accepted it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Good morning.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. Hey, any news?",
        "Dusty: Well, I was thinking. If you're right, I mean, if the baby's yours --",
        "Jennifer: I know he's mine.",
        "Dusty: Then that means he was switched at the hospital. And if babies got switched, that means their records got switched, which would explain why Rory's first pediatric visit, his blood work matches the blood work from the neonatal unit.",
        "Jennifer: But it's almost impossible to get into that unit. And the babies are all wired up. You have to be immediate family, and even then, you have to have a nurse with you the entire time.",
        "Dusty: I know, you need serious access.",
        "Jennifer: So, are you thinking it's someone on staff? Why?",
        "Dusty: I'm thinking, who? Let me ask you something. Who was that nurse you saw holding your baby?",
        "Jennifer: No, no, Dusty, I was strung out. I was hallucinating.",
        "Dusty: Your mind put it out there for a reason. You saw a nurse, right? Who was she?",

        "Lily: Sorry. Sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay.",
        "Lily: How long have you been awake?",
        "Holden: A week or two.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you wake me up?",
        "Holden: 'Cause you were exhausted.",
        "Lily: I -- had a bad dream. Luke -- you were at that cantina. Luke was lying on one of the tables --",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: They were cutting him open --",
        "Holden: Come on. Come on, we've got enough going on without you making stuff up.",
        "Lily: You're right.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Holden: We're gonna find him.",
        "Lily: I just wish -- I wish I knew where to look for him.",
        "Ena: Perdon, regreso mastarde.",
        "Holden: Un minuto. She was at the clinic with her father when we were looking for luke.",
        "Lily: She was? Do you speak English?",
        "Ena: A little.",
        "Lily: Oh, um -- this is our son. Do you know him?",
        "Ena: No, sorry.",
        "Holden: Please, we're trying to find him.",
        "Ena: Sorry, I cannot help.",
        "Holden: Can't or won't?",
        "Lily: What is your name?",
        "Ena: Ena.",
        "Lily: My name is Lily Snyder and this is my son. If you know something, please help us find him.",
        "Ena: My father, I promise him I will not say anything.",
        "Holden: Why? What's he so afraid of?",
        "Ena: Blanca.",
        "Holden: Ena, we will do everything we can to protect you.",
        "Lily: Yes. We will help you. We will help your family. We spoke to Blanca. We asked her about the illegal operations, and she denied it. She said she didn't know anything about them.",
        "Ena: She is a liar, a bad person. She -- ella convenes ala gente pobre para que vendan sus organos. Y muchas veces ni les paya. Se mueren y ni le importa.",
        "Lily: Okay, what did she say? What did she say?",
        "Holden: \"What we expected. They exploit anyone desperate enough or poor enough to sell their organs.\"",
        "Lily: Oh, my God!",
        "Holden: Have you seen our son?",
        "Lily: Please.",
        "Ena: Blanca took him.",
        "Holden: Where is he now?",
        "Ena: You know la cantina, where Blanca works?",
        "Lily: I knew she was lying to me. We have to go to the police.",
        "Ena: No --",
        "Lily: Our son is in danger!",
        "Ena: Le jefe de policia, he is the brother of Blanca. He will not help you.",
        "Lily: What are we going to do now?",
        "Holden: We'll do whatever we have to do. Whatever it takes to get him back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You know what, you have crossed a line.",
        "Maddie: Wait a minute --",
        "Mike: No, no, no, listen. I know that you're just a kid and you love your brother, and you think you're helping him out, but you're not. Okay, Katie and Henry are divorced. It's over. Okay, you can't keep following us around. All right, so walk out that door and don't come back. Because I promise you, if I see you one more time, you're gonna be on the next plane out of here.",
        "Maddie: I cannot walk out. I work here.",
        "Mike: Since when?",
        "Maddie: Since I answered an ad in the paper. This is my job. Ask anybody.",
        "Mike: Does Kim know you're Henry's sister?",
        "Maddie: Yes, and it wasn't her most favorite piece of news, but Casey talked to her and --",
        "Mike: Casey?",
        "Maddie: Katie's nephew.",
        "Mike: I know who he is. All right, and I know what you're trying to do and it's not gonna work.",
        "B.J.: Mike? Katie was just telling me about your idea to rig the exercise floor so parts of it can move. Is that possible?",
        "Mike: Sure. Hydraulics. I made a sketch of the lift. I'll show it to you.",
        "B.J.: All right, man.",
        "Mike: Your nephew helped her get a job here.",
        "Maddie: I really didn't know you worked here. I'm just trying to make some extra money so that I can help Henry get a place. He can't stay in that car. What if he gets carbon monoxide poisoning or gout?",
        "Katie: Gout from sleeping in a car?",
        "Maddie: I really, really need this job. Please, don't tell Mrs. Hughes to fire me. This is the only job I can fit in with school.",
        "Katie: Okay, relax. Please. I won't say anything, as long as you promise to give me my space with Mike. I mean it, Maddie, no tricks. Okay? Or you are on the next plane.",
        "Maddie: I know. I got it.",
        "P.A.: This just arrived for you.",
        "Katie: Oh. For me? Yes, for Katie. That would be me. Thank you.",
        "P.A.: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: Probably champagne. From Mike, to celebrate how happy we are. Oh, my God. A brunello di montalcino? 1993? That's the year that I went to Italy with my mom. We visited Montalcino. Oh. No, Maddie, please, you promised me.",
        "Maddie: What did I do?",
        "Katie: This is from Henry. And if you love your brother, you won't let Mike see it. So -- does B.J. think you're a genius or what? 'cause I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Her name was Special Duty Nurse Thompson. I don't know her first name, but she only spoke to me that first night that I was in the hospital.",
        "Dusty: And in your dream, she was holding the baby, right?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, and telling me that he was alive.",
        "Dusty: Okay. I'm gonna talk to Nurse Thompson and find out what I can.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank you so much.",
        "Dusty: Don't thank me yet.",
        "Jennifer: No, thank you for believing me. You know you're the only one.",
        "Dusty: I just want to help you find the truth, and I gotta tell ya, I don't know if your baby's alive or not, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: But you're willing to find out. And that's more than I can say for anybody else.",
        "Dusty: I'll take care of it. This stays between us.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I'm not going to tell anyone. They would -- you know they would try to stop us. And you're the only thing that's keeping me going. You and knowing that Johnny needs a mother who's in one piece.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: Okay, but here's my question -- do we really want to build something that your fans just can't have at home? All right? I mean, maybe we should create something Katie can just move around, like steps or blocks or something like that. Then we can market it, right?",
        "Mike: Katie?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, steps, or the hydraulic thing. I don't know, whatever.",
        "Mike: Don't you have something to do?",
        "Maddie: Katie was going to help me fill out my w-2 forms, but if you guys need time to do this, I could --",
        "Katie: No, no, now's good. Yeah, you guys figure out whatever you want, the steps or whatever. I'm going to help her with her paperwork, and then I'll catch up to you. Thank you so much for not saying anything. I don't want Mike to know about this. It would just make things worse. And Maddie, please don't encourage your brother.",
        "Maddie: I didn't. He didn't sign the card, did he?",
        "Katie: Henry is the only person I've told about this trip. I know I haven't even mentioned it to Mike.",
        "Maddie: Well, when did you take this trip? Maybe it was someone from college or -- or, you know, your first job --",
        "Kat: It was high school. I gotta go talk to your brother.",
        "Maddie: No, no -- no, please --",
        "Katie: This has to stop, Maddie. Just tell Mike I'll be back.",
        "Maddie: Byron. Byron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jen? Hi. Mom's here. I hope that's okay.",
        "Barbara: Hi, honey. How are you feeling?",
        "Jennifer: As good as can be expected.",
        "Barbara: Yeah? Paul tells me that you've -- had a breakthrough. That Dusty was here. That you'd had a talk.",
        "Paul: I don't think there's any need to rehash everything. It's -- we're just glad that you've accepted the situation.",
        "Barbara: Have you accepted the situation, Jen?",
        "Jennifer: I don't have much choice now, do I?",
        "Barbara: Honey, I know how painful this is.",
        "Paul: Did you get a chance to look at those fashion magazines I dropped by?",
        "Jennifer: No.",
        "Paul: Any visitors?",
        "Barbara: I know that will was gonna stop by.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, he's been by quite a bit, actually, but then I fell asleep and I guess the nurses made him leave.",
        "Paul: Great, you got some sleep. That's probably the best thing for you.",
        "Jennifer: It didn't really help. I still feel pretty exhausted.",
        "Barbara: I was really hoping that you'd feel better by now.",
        "Jennifer: Really? Now that you've proved to me that my baby is dead, you thought I would feel better?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Another favor?",
        "Dusty: Another favor, yeah. I want to speak to a nurse who was on duty the night the baby died. Nurse Thompson?",
        "Meg: I never met her.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe she left before you signed in. I'm not hospital personnel, so I don't know.",
        "Meg: Why do you want to talk to her?",
        "Dusty: Because I think it might help.",
        "Meg: You think the baby's still alive.",
        "Dusty: I didn't say that.",
        "Meg: No, but Jen did. Even after the blood results. Doesn't she?",
        "Dusty: Well, like you said -- it's a hard thing to accept.",
        "Meg: Yeah, especially if people keep telling you that there's a chance that she might have buried the wrong boy. Dusty, you're not helping her. She has to accept the reality.",
        "Dusty: She will.",
        "Meg: When?",
        "Dusty: When we narrow down all possibilities.",
        "Meg: Oh, so the facts that the blood types don't match --",
        "Dusty: Let me tell you something. I mean, if someone switches babies, presumably, the paperwork would be switched too, right?",
        "Meg: What's happened to you?",
        "Dusty: I mean, think about it.",
        "Meg: I don't have to think about it. I trust the hospital, I trust the staff. I saw the reports they filed. The baby died.",
        "Dusty: Which one? And how much are you willing to bet? You're asking Jennifer to bet her life on a piece of paper.",
        "Meg: And you're asking her to bet on you.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean by that?",
        "Meg: Her obstetrician, the nurses, her family -- they all know Jennifer's son died -- [Dusty sighs] What, I have to listen to you, you don't want to listen to me? Jen was so hurt with the breakup of her marriage and her baby dying, that she started taking one of the ugliest drugs on the market. She's desperate.",
        "Dusty: That's what I'm saying.",
        "Meg: And if she's that fragile, you could be doing some real damage to her.",
        "Dusty: If her son is still alive and she doesn't find out, that's real damage, isn't it?",
        "Meg: And if he isn't? And you're building up her hopes, and not letting her grieve and move on in her life? She will never trust herself or anyone else again.",
        "Dusty: She trusts herself. She knows something's up. She feels it. I've got respect for that.",
        "Meg: Why? Because you're in love with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Blanca -- just the woman I wanted to see.",
        "Blanca: I told you last night I know nothing about your son.",
        "Lily: I know you did. I came here to apologize. I didn't mean to make a scene last night, but I'm sure you understand. My husband and I are very worried --",
        "Blanca: That has nothing to do with me.",
        "Lily: Why are you being so hostile? I'm trying to apologize.",
        "Blanca: I don't need your apology. I have things to do. You should go.",
        "Lily: No, I'm staying right here, because now you're making me think I was right and you do have my son.",
        "Blanca: Rico. Saquela de aqui.",
        "Lily: Don't you walk away from me. You call off the dogs, or I'm calling the cops!",
        "Blanca: Quite me la de arriba!",
        "Lily: We can solve this very easily!",
        "Blanca: Matela si es necesario.",
        "Lily: Back up! Back up! Don't move!",

        "Henry: Yeah, I may be a fool for love, sweetheart, but I am not stupid.",
        "Meg: I'm not betting my job or anything on you, unless you're willing to do the same thing for me.",

        "Holden: Luke.",
        "Lily: What's going on?",
        "Holden: He's not here.",
        "Blanca: Muchacho no esta.",
        "Holden: So Luke was here. She just admitted it.",
        "Blanca: I did not.",
        "Holden: You just told your boyfriend that Luke was gone.",
        "Blanca: You Americans are all alike. You think you can order tortillas, so that makes you -- that you can speak Spanish. You misunderstood.",
        "Lily: What have you done to our son?!",
        "Blanca: Nothing! I don't know what you're talking about!",
        "Holden: He must've untied himself and got out the window. Move.",
        "Blanca: What do you want with me?",

        "Katie: Henry, we have to talk.",
        "Henry: Bubbles. What a surprise. And you brought your own. How sweet. Although, I don't think they'd like that here. It is a bar.",
        "Katie: You sent this.",
        "Henry: I did? I must have very good taste.",
        "Katie: Henry, it has to stop. I don't know what else to say to you except for that Mike and I are very happy.",
        "Henry: And I'm happy that you're happy. A brunello di montalcino? I can't afford this. What was I thinking?",
        "Katie: Look at the date.",
        "Henry: It's a 1993.",
        "Katie: What are you -- who are you calling? I'm trying to make a point here.",
        "Henry: I'm trying to make a point, too, to my credit card company. Would you mind taking this back for me, please? Because I'm already way over the limit.",
        "Katie: Then why did you get it?",
        "Henry: A coma? A blackout? A crossed wire?",
        "Katie: What are you saying?",
        "Henry: I'm saying, honey, that if I could afford this beautiful bottle of wine, I would shower you in it, but -- check that, I would shower me in it, considering the state of our non-marriedness.",
        "Katie: Okay, you're actually trying to tell me that you didn't me this?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I may be a fool for love, sweetheart, but I am not stupid. Even I know how far to push Mr. Plastic.",
        "Katie: But you're the only person I told about that trip.",
        "Henry: Remind me?",
        "Katie: My mother?",
        "Henry: Your mother? Yeah, and that you -- right, you took a trip.",
        "Katie: She took me to Italy my junior year of high school. We went to all the regular places -- Venice, Rome -- my favorite was Montalcino because it was the most beautiful little town I had ever seen, and I've told you this before, and you're the only person I've told.",
        "Henry: High school? Listen, I know you don't want to believe a word I say ever since the pink sweater, but I swear to you on my gimlet glasses, I did not send you this bottle of wine.",
        "Katie: Then who did?",
        "Henry: That, I can't say. Was there a card with it or anything?",
        "Katie: If there was a card, I would know who sent it, I would know if it was you.",

        "Jennifer: Memories of my son are wonderful. It's what happened later.",
        "Barbara: Yes. Well, we're gonna give this another day or two, for you to get some extra rest, and then I'm gonna talk to your doctors about signing a release.",
        "Paul: Whenever you're ready.",
        "Barbara: Of course, of course, whenever you're ready. I just want you to come home, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I think that I need to stay here for a bit until I'm stronger.",
        "Barbara: We just want you to know that you're not alone.",
        "Jennifer: I know. I know that now.",
        "Barbara: And how loved you are. And how we'd do anything for you.",
        "Jennifer: I know.",
        "Barbara: I hope you do. We just want you better, honey. I want you to be happy. You have so much to look forward to in life.",
        "Jennifer: You know what? I never -- Paul, I never thanked you for these magazines. I appreciate it.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. Sure, Jen. Whatever, you know that.",
        "Jennifer: And what you guys were saying about sleep, I think I am a little tired.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Okay. You get some sleep. And you call me, and we'll be here tomorrow, all right? Paul. I love you, honey.",

        "Meg: You and me? Do you really want to go there?",
        "Dusty: You know what I mean.",
        "Meg: I know what you mean. That I'm jealous. Well, you know what? Maybe I am sometimes. There are times I actually do miss you. But you know what? Right now, you are so mixed up that you are way more trouble than you're worth. But, Dusty, I'm worried about you. And Jennifer, believe it or not. And I don't think you're helping her or yourself by feeding this fantasy.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer has to know that somebody trusts her.",
        "Meg: And of course, that somebody has to be you.",
        "Dusty: Nobody else is listening to her.",
        "Meg: Gee, why do you suppose that is? Is it maybe because she's in a psych hospital -- committed against her will because her behavior was so out there that she was a danger to herself and others? Deerbrook is not a spa.",
        "Dusty: Oh, and you're telling me that?",
        "Meg: Look, I really do feel badly for her. I really do. And what she's going through right now is the worst. But she needs treatment, not sympathy.",
        "Dusty: I'm not walking away from her.",
        "Meg: But you will walk away from me.",
        "Dusty: See what I'm talking about? I thought we weren't going there.",
        "Meg: Unlike you, I don't like living in a dream world.",
        "Dusty: I always told you the truth.",
        "Meg: You said one thing and did another.",
        "Dusty: We both did.",
        "Meg: Okay, fair enough. Maybe I was holding out hopes for more.",
        "Dusty: I never promised more.",
        "Meg: You were very careful never to promise me anything. Look, I'm not 16 years old anymore. I know what that meant. But I just never figured you for a user.",
        "Dusty: I never used you.",
        "Meg: Then what do you call asking me to break regulations? And don't tell me friends do friends favors, 'cause that's not what you counted on. You knew damn well why I would make an exception for you. You counted on it. And you know what? That's fine. That's okay. I had a choice, and I did it, and it's on me. But I'm not doing it again. I'm not betting my job or anything on you. Unless you're willing to do the same thing for me. So are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Well, the good news is, she didn't tell Mike.",
        "Henry: And that would be good news because?",
        "Maddie: Because she's hiding things from him already after one day. I call that progress.",
        "Henry: You think she didn't tell Mike about that very expensive bottle of wine to protect me? When the wine came from some geek -- high school geek that you found through the web. That's progress?",
        "Maddie: He is not a geek. How could you say such a thing? Why? Because he can I.M.? Computer literacy is very sexy. And he is the same age as Katie. They went to school together.",
        "Henry: That's great. That's great. You know what? You can put that on my tombstone when Mike runs over me with a backhoe.",
        "Maddie: But that's just it. Mike doesn't know. Katie didn't tell him. Why?",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Maddie: Because --",
        "Henry: Because he doesn't to spend the next 25 years in jail, that's why.",
        "Maddie: No. Because she still loves you. She does. You are her perfect match. She knows that deep down inside. But, you know, fine, I'm not going to say anything else because I know how it upsets you.",
        "Henry: I thought we said you were gonna put a halt to the e-mails, hmm?",
        "Maddie: I tried. He's very persistent.",
        "Henry: Really? I wonder why, K-k-k-katie.",
        "Maddie: Look, K-k-k-katie wrote him saying that she can't write for a while, but he kept writing her. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Be rude?",
        "Henry: Turn it on.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Henry: Turn it on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm not making a commitment to anybody. Not now.",
        "Meg: Because of Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: I brought Jennifer's kid into the world. I've gotta see it through, or see him through if he's out there. I don't have time for anything else. That's it. That's the way it is.",
        "Meg: Got it.",
        "Dusty: So, where you going? Is that it or what?",
        "Meg: I'm ready for more, Dusty. You're not. What more is there to say? Except I'm a nurse, and I take that seriously. And I was willing to bend the rules to help you because I thought it would help Jennifer face the truth. But I am not gonna help you hurt her.",
        "Dusty: I'm not trying to hurt anybody.",
        "Meg: Well, guess what? You're failing. Can you please just go?",
        "Dusty: Meg --",
        "Meg: Please, go, please.",
        "Nurse Bently: Meg, I'm glad I caught you. How'd you feel about subbing in the Neonatal ICU? Honey, are you okay?",
        "Meg: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Nurse Bently: So, are you willing? Because we really need the help upstairs. One of our best nurses quit and I can't find a permanent replacement.",
        "Meg: Don't tell me. Nurse Thompson?",
        "Nurse Bently: You've met her.",
        "Meg: No, no, I haven't, but i have a feeling I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I only doubted you because I was so worried about Jen. She does seem to be making some progress. I just wish she could do that at home. Deerbrook is so extreme.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, her condition was pretty extreme.",
        "Barbara: But she's stabilized now. She's off the drugs. She's lucid.",
        "Paul: And she says, herself, that she needs to be stronger.",
        "Barbara: I just wish she could do that at home, surrounded by art and music and her favorite foods.",
        "Paul: Too much stimulation.",
        "Barbara: She's depressed. She needs a little stimulation. She needs a little hope, a little color in her life, to feel like that great big world is waiting for her.",
        "Paul: Mother, I know you mean well, but the big world, that's a lot of pressure.",
        "Barbara: We can help her, Paul.",
        "Paul: We tried that. It didn't work. From now on, we're going to do things my way. We're gonna listen to the doctors. Don't -- don't look at me like that. We're gonna listen to the doctors, and you need to trust me. Think you can do that?",

        "Lily: To know that he was in that cantina, so close that we could touch him and now he's gone --",
        "Holden: That's the good news.",
        "Lily: Where can he be? This is a foreign country. He doesn't speak the language. The way he looks, they will spot him a mile away. Blanca and her brother, they run this whole town. And now Keith, he's disappeared. I mean, if he couldn't handle them, what about Luke?",
        "Holden: He was working for them. If they wanted him gone, all they had to do was say the word.",
        "Lily: This is all my fault. This is all my fault. I mean, if I hadn't gotten involved with Keith, and convinced Luke to spend time with him to make it work --",
        "Holden: Lily, you did the right thing.",
        "Lily: You didn't want anything to do with him from the beginning.",
        "Holden: That's because he was taking my place.",
        "Lily: No one could take your place. Luke didn't want to handle any more change. None of them could handle it. They all needed me. And I wasn't there for any of them.",
        "Holden: You know what? We've all made plenty of mistakes, but now's not the time to talk about them. We need to focus on trying to find Luke.",
        "Lily: How are we gonna do that? We can't go to the police. Our one lead was Blanca. I don't even know where to start to look for him.",
        "Holden: Maybe we don't look. The last thing he needs is for us to start stirring up trouble. He knows that we're here, that's why he escaped.",
        "Lily: Then where is he? Why isn't he here?",
        "Holden: Because he's laying low. He knows it's dangerous out there.",
        "Lily: So, what do we do?",
        "Holden: We call the consulate.",
        "Lily: You're right, you're absolutely right. That's exactly what we should do. He's gonna be all right. He's gonna be okay 'cause he's been through so many challenges, that boy. He's a survivor -- he's a survivor like you and like me. And he's going to find his way home. Won't he?",
        "Holden: Yes, he will and we're gonna find him.",

        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey, hi. I'm sorry. I just had to run out real quick. How's everything?",
        "Mike: Good, good. We just had a couple questions for you.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'm all yours, whatever you need.",
        "B.J.: Hey, I have a meeting right now, so can we do this a little later, say 7:00?",
        "Katie: Oh, you mean just me?",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I already talked to Mike. I needed to talk to you.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely.",
        "B.J.: Good, then 7:00 it is.",
        "Katie: Got it.",

        "Katie: You still think there's nothing to worry about with this guy?",
        "Mike: B.J.? He's great. Okay, he seems a little --",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: You know, it's just a little overwhelming. A guy comes into town, offers to give you your own TV show, you know, I can see where you think there might be ulterior motives, but, you know, just remember, this is just as much Kim's idea as it was his.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: If they're both totally committed, I say go for it. Just don't forget me when you're all rich and famous.",
        "Katie: Mike who?",

        "Maddie: \"Dear Byron.\"",
        "Henry: \"I am sorry to have to tell you that our entire correspondence has been a misunderstanding. I am not the Katie you knew in high school. In fact, Katie doesn't know anything about this. She hasn't asked about you, she doesn't care about you.\"",
        "Maddie: That is really harsh.",
        "Henry: \"She has not expressed any interest in renewing a friendship with you.\" Is that better? \"Now, I am sorry for the misunderstanding, and I hope I haven't inconvenienced you too much.\"",
        "Maddie: \"Inconvenienced\"?",
        "Henry: You led him on, Maddie. It wasn't nice.",
        "Maddie: Inconvenienced it is.",
        "Henry: \"I will never talk to you again, and I must insist that you not reach out to Katie again.\" Yep.",
        "Maddie: Whoa, I didn't even get to spell check that.",
        "Henry: I'll buy you a dictionary.",
        "Maddie: Mail sent. You satisfied?",
        "Henry: Very.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: \"I am not really the Katie you knew in high school.\" Well, that's not surprising. I'm not really the Byron that she knew either, but -- so K-k-k- katie, whoever you are -- thank you.",

        "Paul: Crystal meth is addictive. It's very addictive. And the effects when you stop using it are different from other drugs. There's none of the usual cravings, no shaking, you're seemingly normal, until all of a sudden a few weeks go by, and suddenly, you'd sell your soul for it. And I do not want Jennifer home and vulnerable until the doctors say she's ready.",
        "Barbara: And I certainly don't want her back on that drug.",
        "Paul: Think about it. She's grieving, she's dwelling on all her losses.",
        "Barbara: I know, I just -- I just wish she were home. But at least she's accepted that the baby's gone.",
        "Paul: Mother, she's going to recover. She will get her life back, this time without Craig on her doorstep.",
        "Barbara: And thank God for that. Okay. Okay, you win. We'll do it your way. You just keep me informed, all right?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course.",

        "Dusty: You didn't tell them anything, did you?",
        "Jennifer: That you were out investigating? No. Oh, I hate the way they look at me.",

        "Jennifer: Sometimes when I'm sitting here, sometimes I just think my luck has changed permanently, and that from here on out, it's not gonna get any better. No one's gonna believe me. Then my son will grow up without ever knowing me.",

        "Jennifer: Are you sure?",
