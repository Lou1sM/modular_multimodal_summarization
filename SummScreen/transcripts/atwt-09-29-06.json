        "[Loud music playing] ",
        "Carly: Can you turn that down? ",
        "Simon: What? ",
        "Carly: The noise -- ",
        "Simon: The music? ",
        "Carly: Yeah, it's been rattling my brain for an hour. ",
        "[Music stops] ",
        "Simon: So, come on, what do you think? Are we done? ",
        "Carly: I think we're done. ",
        "Simon: What is that incredible smell? ",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm doing a test run of the hors d'oeuvres. I've got enough to \r\nfeed an army, so just hope that an army of brokers comes through that door in a \r\nfew hours. ",
        "Simon: They will. ",
        "Carly: So, what do you think? ",
        "Simon: Are you kidding me? The place looks amazing. We should double our \r\nasking price. And by the way, I noticed these before. I like the homey touches.\r\n",
        "Carly: Yeah, I thought you might. ",
        "Simon: But didn't this go out with the silent movie period? ",
        "Carly: This is a retro building, Simon. ",
        "Simon: Ah -- ",
        "Carly: We want it to exude sophistication and a hint of old-fashioned \r\nromance. ",
        "Simon: Well, I'll settle for a hint of cold, hard cash. ",
        "Carly: Did you say cold? ",
        "Simon: Cold, green, crisp. ",
        "Carly: Simon -- ",
        "Simon: Yep, enough to throw around on something frivolous when we're done.\r\n",
        "Carly: You gotta see this. Simon! Look. ",
        "Simon: An ice storm this time of year? ",
        "Carly: Do you notice anything else? ",
        "Simon: Well, it's pretty dark out there. ",
        "Carly: The only lights are around here. The power must have gone out every \r\nplace else. ",
        "Simon: The roads must be impossible. ",
        "Carly: It's gonna make it pretty difficult for the realtors to get here, \r\ndon't you think? ",
        "Simon: Oh, my God, I do not believe this. ",
        "",
        "Bob: Alert the O.R. take this patient to pre-op. Find Dr. Kellan. Tell him I \r\nwant to bed-to-bed accounting for every patient in this hospital. Go! ",
        "Nurse #2: Okay. Yes, Dr. Hughes. ",
        "Margo: Bob, how's it going here? ",
        "Bob: Oh, B oy, am I glad to see you. ",
        "Jack: We pulled in as many units as we could. ",
        "Bob: That's great. Look, I need your people to help my staff keep things in \r\nan orderly fashion, especially in the ER. ",
        "Jack: You got it. ",
        "Margo: Bob, have you seen Katie or Mike? ",
        "Bob: Why? ",
        "Margo: Well, Mike was in the pile-up on the interstate and Katie was out at \r\nthe scene with me. She saw Mike's car, but Mike wasn't in it, so she went off \r\nlooking for Mike on her own. I was on the scene. ",
        "Bob: I hope not on her own. ",
        "Margo: Yeah, on her own. You know her. And she's not gonna stop until she \r\nfinds him or dies trying. ",

        "Katie: Mike! Mike! Where are you? Mike! ",

        "Luke: Dad, what could've happened to her? ",
        "Holden: Well, the hospital is so overloaded, maybe they're moving patients \r\naround to make more room. ",
        "Luke: Well, do you think she took a turn for the worse. ",
        "Holden: Luke, we were just here. She was stable, her vitals were strong. \r\nShe's okay. You know what? Maybe we should get to the bottom of this. Nurse, my \r\nwife has been in this room for the past few weeks and suddenly she's not here.\r\n",
        "Nurse #1: I just checked on Mrs. Snyder 30 minutes ago. I noted it in her \r\nchart. ",
        "Holden: Did someone move her? ",
        "Nurse #1: Not that I'm aware of. ",
        "Holden: Can I see her chart? ",
        "Nurse #1: Yes, it's in here. It's right over here, by her -- bed. All right, \r\nit's gone, but I'm sure it's at the desk. With all the, you know, problems going \r\non, it's really hard to keep track of everybody. ",
        "Holden: Maybe you should page her neurologist. ",
        "Nurse #1: Dr. Waide isn't here. He's on his way back to the hospital. ",
        "Holden: Nurse, my wife is in a coma. There's no way she just got up and \r\nwalked out of this room. Somebody must have moved her. ",
        "Nurse #1: I'm sorry. I will see what I can find out, but it may take awhile. \r\nThe lines of communication are not working well tonight -- ",
        "Holden: All right, you know what? Forget it. I'll find her myself. ",

        "Lucy: Dusty, thank God you found us. ",
        "Dusty: How is he? ",
        "Lucy: I haven't been able to get his fever down. I was heading to the \r\nhospital, but my car hit an icy patch. ",
        "Dusty: Are you hurt? ",
        "Lucy: No, no, I'm fine. I'm just cold, but fine. ",
        "Dusty: Are you okay to keep going? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Dusty: We gotta get Johnny to the hospital. Let's go! Lucy -- Lucy? ",

        "Nurse #2: No, it's right here. I just filed it. ",
        "Nurse #1: I'll take it from here, kit. Mr. Snyder, I know you're upset, but \r\nI'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for where she is. ",
        "Holden: How reasonable is it for a woman in her condition to go missing and \r\nno one notices? ",
        "Nurse #1: It's possible that she was scheduled to be in radiology for tests.\r\n",
        "Holden: Is she? ",
        "Nurse #1: There's nothing here, but sometimes one of the doctors puts in \r\norder on the computer and then we update the chart later. ",
        "Holden: Can you check the computer? ",
        "Nurse #1: I can\u2019t. The system's down. ",
        "Holden: Okay, where do they do the tests? ",
        "Nurse #1: Radiology, fifth floor. ",

        "Carly: Simon, my entire financial future is buried under an inch and a half \r\nof ice and there is nothing I can do about it. And who do you think that I \r\nticked off in a past life? ",
        "Simon: I don't know, but I'll bet it was a guy. ",

        "Lucy: I can't, Dusty. Johnny has a fever. You need to get him to the ER. ",

        "Simon: So, he would have put them in good, safe hands. ",

        "Carly: Yeah, you're right. You're probably right. ",
        "Simon: They are probably roasting hot dogs on an open fire, playing games by \r\ncandlelight as we speak. Speaking of food, I am famished. ",
        "Carly: How can you think about food right now? ",

        "Carly: Why? Why is this happening? ",

        "Simon: All right, do you know what? If everything was so bad, then we do we \r\nstill have power? Come here, come here, come on. Come over here. Now, we are \r\ngoing to put some music on, ladies' choice. And then we are going to sit here \r\nuntil the storm blows over and we will reschedule the open house in a day or \r\ntwo. Okay? See, now, things could be a hell of a lot worse. ",

        "Paul: All right, how you doing? ",
        "Emily: How does it look like I'm doing, huh? Thanks to your crazy girlfriend, \r\nlocking me in a burning burn. I swear to God, if anything happens to this baby, \r\nPaul, I'm going to kill her. ",

        "Meg: Okay, can we stop pointing finger here? Okay? The thing we need to focus \r\non is keeping you and the baby safe. Paul, Mama keeps camp lanterns underneath \r\nthe sink, okay? And you're going to need matches. They are on top of the \r\ncounter. Careful. ",
        "Paul: Got it. ",
        "Meg: And we need a pot. ",

        "Meg: Okay, well, it doesn't look like we're going to make it, okay? So, what \r\nI need you to do is just breathe and take it easy. All right? Paul, you need to \r\nwash your hands, okay? And get me some juice with a straw for Emily. Are you \r\nokay for a sec? ",

        "Emily: I said epidural, Paul, not juice. ",
        "Paul: Meg, what are we looking at? ",
        "Meg: I tried slowing down the labor, but it's really hard once the water \r\nbreaks. ",
        "Emily: Yeah, thanks to you. Thanks to you, my water broke. Because she locked \r\nme in the barn. ",
        "Meg: For a while, the contractions had stopped, but then the fire started, \r\nand they started back up again. And now, they're just over two minutes apart.\r\n",
        "Paul: Okay, there's still time. There's no straws. Go to the hospital. ",
        "Meg: How? How, Paul? You were out there. You know how bad it is. Look, I know \r\nthis isn't ideal, but it's much better than what we have to deal with out there \r\nin the storm, right? ",
        "Paul: Did you call Jack? ",
        "Meg: Twice. And I couldn't get through. Look, we need to face it, right now, \r\nthis is as good as it gets, okay? ",
