        "Brad tells Janet that he confessed to his role in Leo's accident; Brad finds out Katie didn't come home when he tells Janet that he needs to talk to Katie about what he did. Katie awakens after a drunken and hung over night beside Mike in bed. Bonnie shares her fears with Carly about a missing Derek. Jack learns that Brad confessed, but he is too preoccupied with where Meg is to focus on anything else. Jack gets a \u0091text' from Meg saying she is in Mattamoi. Dusty and Meg continue to search for a place to hide from James \u0096 they find a lighthouse. James finds Paul at the house where Meg was staying. Paul doesn't believe Meg would meet up in secret with a supposedly dead Dusty \u0096 that is until he finds a necklace that belonged to Jennifer. James goads Paul about Meg leaving him for Dusty. Carly agrees to help Bonnie find Derek, but she checks in with Jack first, who tells her about his lead with Meg. Katie panics and tries to come up with a story; Mike suggests the truth because nothing happened. Katie calls into work to tell them she is doing a story in Chicago. Janet tells Brad, who is on the phone calling hospitals, that Katie is in Chicago. Brad thinks she went there alone to think and stayed at the WOAK hotel room they have there. Carly and Bonnie head over to the wine cellar where they find Derek, who tells them what James, is up to. Carly realizes Jack is walking into a trap and heads off to go find him when she can't reach him by phone. James plays on Paul's insecurities saying Dusty plans to take Meg away with his baby. James gives Paul a gun to seek out Dusty and Meg. Brad shows up in Chicago and tells Katie he is sorry and that he confessed; they make up right before Mike walks out dressed only in a towel. Brad is furious because he thinks Katie slept with Mike; they try to explain, but Brad doesn't want to hear it, and stomps off. When Mike sees how much Katie loves Brad, he tells her to go after him. Dusty and Meg finally get the electricity to work at the lighthouse and start to send SOS signals. Jack shows up at the remote place called Mattamoi and asks a stranger to take him out in his boat to search the island. Paul continues to look for Meg and Dusty, sees the lighthouse, and heads for it. Katie goes home and asks Brad for understanding; Brad thinks she has made her choice and isn't listening to her, but Katie finally wins him over wither speech about how much she wants to be with him; their make up session is interrupted when Dallas calls wanting Brad to come down to the station \u0096 as Brad and Katie prepare for the worst. Meg and Dusty agree to disagree when it comes to Paul. Meg convinces Dusty to rest with her so they sit down and Meg lays her head on his shoulder, as they fall asleep, and that is how Paul, with his gun drawn, finds them. When Jack asks the man about an island he can see nearby \u0096 Fire Island \u0096 the man attacks Jack and throws him overboard, just as Carly arrives to see this. Dallas tells Brad there will be no charges brought against him, as Brad and Katie are thrilled and realized Dallas said something to Leo's parents. Dallas also admits to wanting Brad to sweat a little bit because Jack quit the force because of him, and that is why he didn't tell him on the phone. Carly jumps in the water and pulls an unconscious Jack to safety. When the men in the boat circle around, Jack wakes up and wants to protect Carly. Soon, he has fallen unconscious again and a desperate Carly can't rouse him; Carly performs CPR on Jack to try to save him."

        "Janet: Hey! You're up early. Do you want some breakfast?",
        "Brad: Uh, I'd rather have a fifth of scotch, you know, but I probably should be sober when they come to haul me off to the slammer.",
        "[Brad chuckles]",
        "Janet: What did you do now, Bradley?",
        "Brad: I -- I confessed. I went to the police station, and I gave Dallas my full confession and what I did to Leo.",
        "Janet: You told them that you're the one that pushed him in the Reservoir?",
        "Brad: Yeah. You know all the stuff they say about confession being good for the soul? It's bull! [Brad chuckles] I thought they were gonna put me in jail right then -- and there.",
        "Janet: Brad, you're still here, so that's good!",
        "Brad: Yeah. Yeah, just long enough for them to figure out what to charge me with, you know, which will probably be assault. You know, maximum two years.",
        "Janet: Okay, but you told them that -- that you were just trying to scare him, that you weren't trying to kill him, right?",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, right before they told me not to leave town.",
        "Janet: What? He drugged your daughter! He nearly raped her! You know what? Maybe I should go talk to them, right?",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no. Enough. No. No. I mean, the last thing I need is for you to get arrested for obstruction of justice. Just leave it alone.",
        "Janet: I can't believe you're gonna go to prison.",
        "Brad: Had to do it, Janet. I had to do it. You know, I was messing things up between Katie and me, Jack and you. Had to do it.",
        "Janet: You know what? Katie will be very proud of you.",
        "Brad: Yeah. I hope so. Toughest thing I ever had to do. Uh -- I could use some alone time. So --",
        "Janet: Right. Totally cool. I get it. Um, uh, you know she's not here, right?",
        "Brad: She left already?",
        "Janet: I don't know. Uh, she didn't sleep with me in the bed last night. I figured that you two had made up and you both slept on the couch or something.",
        "Brad: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She didn't come home last night? Then where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie wakes up and groans]",
        "Katie: Oh, Brad, I have such a headache. Mike?",
        "Mike: Good morning, Sunshine. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We slept through the night.",
        "Mike: Shh! I need a couple more hours.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no! Get up! Get up! You promised you would wake me up when you were sober enough to drive.",
        "Mike: Obviously, that took all night.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Katie: What am I gonna tell my husband?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, Bonnie. You're here early.",
        "Bonnie: I was hoping that you were Derek. I've been here all night waiting for him.",
        "Carly: Oh, Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie, no, no. Here's a tip -- never wait longer than an hour for a guy. You'll give him the wrong idea.",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no. Carly, I think he's in trouble. He called, he said he was on his way, and then he never showed up.",
        "Carly: Derek -- is this the guy that was working for Stenbeck?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, yes. He gave us all the information on Stenbeck to help us find Meg. But I think something must have happened to him. If he was all right, he would have called me.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, then let's call the cops and let them know that he's missing.",
        "Bonnie: No. I already tried. I went to Dallas, and he was a complete jerk. He said he was too busy and that I was better off without Derek anyway.",
        "Carly: Well, he could be right about that.",
        "Bonnie: Look, Derek never wanted to work for Stenbeck. He was blackmailed. And look, I just need to find him.",
        "Carly: Well, how do you plan on doing that without the cops' help?",
        "Bonnie: Well, I was hoping you could help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. Any news on Stenbeck?",
        "Dallas: Uh, no. Not yet. Um, but your brother was in here earlier.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Dallas: Well, he gave me a statement about what he did to that kid, Leo.",
        "Jack: He went through with it.",
        "Dallas: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Good for him. What now?",
        "Dallas: Nothing. We're just investigating, waiting to contact Leo and his family.",
        "Jack: Mm. I hope they go easy on him.",
        "Dallas: Really? I mean, that's kind of generous.",
        "Jack: Why? Brad's -- listen. Brad's a hothead, but he's not malicious. When's the last time you heard of a perp assaulting a guy, then turning around and helping him.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, but if he had told us the same thing in the first place, then you'd still have your job.",
        "Jack: Yes, and that's why, my friend, hindsight is always a sure bet.",
        "[Dallas scoffs]",
        "Jack: Whereabouts on Meg -- what have we got?",
        "Dallas: Uh, nothing right now. The local cops on Swan Island still haven't come up with anything yet.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Jack: It's Meg.",
        "Dallas: What? She's calling?",
        "Jack: No. She's texting me.",
        "Dallas: Where is -- is she okay?",
        "Jack: Well, maybe the reason you couldn't find the house on Swan Island is because, according to this, she's at a place called Mattamoi.",
        "Dallas: You think this is for real?",
        "Jack: Only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Dusty: How's the baby? Any more pains?",
        "Meg: No. Not since we tried getting into the boat. Is there any more food?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Dusty: Maybe I'll sneak back to the cottage.",
        "Meg: So Stenbeck can throw you back into that cage? Are you nuts?",
        "Dusty: You're already dealing with a risky pregnancy. You got to eat.",
        "Meg: And what if you get yourself killed and then I have to get away from James all on my own? How risky is that?",
        "Dusty: All right. Then I'll look for some berries or something.",
        "Meg: Okay. I'll go with you.",
        "Dusty: No, no. You got to rest.",
        "Meg: Promise me you won't go back to the cottage.",
        "Dusty: Meg --",
        "Meg: Promise me or you've got yourself a shadow -- wherever you go, I go.",
        "Dusty: Fine. Hey, look. What do you think is up there?",
        "Meg: Civilization?",
        "Dusty: There's got to be a way up. Want to give it a shot?",
        "Meg: Yeah. We'll try.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Dusty: What's that?",
        "Meg: Paul's name. I wanted him beside me last night. I know it's silly, but it did make me feel better.",
        "Dusty: It's not good if Stenbeck sees it.",
        "Meg: I'll get rid of it.",
        "Dusty: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul enters the room Meg was in]",
        "Paul: Meg! [Paul groans] Coburn lied.",
        "James: Paul. Looking for someone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hello? Hello? Anybody here? Hey.",
        "Meg: Thanks. I guess nobody's been here a long time.",
        "Dusty: Guess it's abandoned.",
        "Meg: Well, at least we have a dry place to stay until we find out what else to do.",
        "Dusty: It's got a good vantage point. See if anyone's coming up the beach.",
        "Meg: Do you think James knows about this place?",
        "Dusty: If I lie, would it make you feel better?",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: I do better with the truth, no matter how bad it is.",
        "Dusty: He's going to come after us.",
        "Meg: So what are we going to do?",
        "Dusty: Get rescued before he finds us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg was here. I know she was here. You tell me where she is.",
        "James: I don't have the slightest idea where she is.",
        "Paul: Then why are you here?",
        "James: Because I had to follow you. You'd been sedated in the hospital. I had to keep an eye on you. Now, look, where are we? What is this place? Have you ever been here before?",
        "Paul: No, but Meg was here, and she's in danger. I know that. I saw her.",
        "James: Oh, you saw her. And when you saw her, was she with someone? You think she was with me?",
        "Paul: No, she wasn't with you. She was with Dusty.",
        "James: Dusty? Paul, that's impossible. Donavan is dead!",
        "Paul: No, with you, nothing is impossible. I know it. I saw Meg. She's here.",
        "James: So, you think that your pregnant wife came to this room to have a rendezvous with a ghost? I need to get you to a psychiatrist now!",
        "Paul: No, the more you say I'm crazy, the more you know I'm right.",
        "James: Good, fine, do it. You look around. The sooner you can determine that Meg has never been here, the sooner I can get you to a doctor.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "James: Very romantic, but no Meg. What is it?",
        "Paul: It's Meg's perfume.",
        "James: It's just a coincidence, Paul. Come on, let's go. What are you staring at as if it's some sort of talisman?",
        "Paul: This locket belonged to my sister, and the only person who could have put it here is Dusty. They were here together. Meg and Dusty were here together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey! Dusty, hey! I found a hotplate and food. I can cook something.",
        "Dusty: I remember your cooking skills, I'll cook.",
        "Meg: What's that for?",
        "Dusty: To bash in James' head if necessary.",
        "Meg: How long do you think we have before he finds us?",
        "Dusty: He's going to wait until nighttime when we can't see him coming. Let's eat. We'll send an SOS afterward. I already checked that. That doesn't work.",
        "Meg: Try plugging in the hotplate.",
        "Dusty: That works.",
        "Meg: Ok. So we've got electricity. There must be another reason why this light bulb doesn't work. Here, can you hand me that fork?",
        "Dusty: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Meg: You forget. I'm a farm girl. We used to do all our own chores. We had fifteen tractors and did all the wiring.",
        "Dusty: Careful with the wires, all right. You don't want to short anything out, Meg.",
        "Meg: I've got it covered. You just stick with your cooking. I'll handle the heavy machinery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Why don't you call Jack?",
        "Carly: Because he's tied up looking for Meg. And he's not going to take time away from that to look for one of Stenbeck's thugs, ok?",
        "Bonnie: He wouldn't if I asked him, but if you asked him...",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Bonnie, Jack and I are divorced. He's not exactly eager to do me any favors.",
        "Bonnie: You would be doing him a favor. If he picked up a trail on Derek, it would help him find Meg.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Big if.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you never know if you don't try. Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Carly: Hi, Jack. It's me. I'm here with Bonnie, and she's very concerned. Derek has disappeared.",
        "Jack: When?",
        "Carly: Sometime last night. This has got to have something to do with Stenbeck.",
        "Jack: If it's not, I can't -- I can't waste any time. I've got to follow up on this text I got from Meg. She said she's someplace called Mattamoi Island.",
        "Carly: Meg texted you?",
        "Jack: Yeah. It feels off to me, too, like someone's trying to throw us off track.",
        "Carly: Well, what about the local cops there on Mattamoi? Can't they look for her?",
        "Jack: I got to go, Carly. You want to run this Derek thing by Dallas?",
        "Carly: No, no, no. That's okay. Good luck, Jack. I'll pray that you bring Meg home safe.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Well, looks like we're on our own.",
        "Bonnie: \"We\"?",
        "Carly: Let's make some calls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You have to help me figure out what to tell Brad.",
        "Mike: Why don't you tell him the truth? Tell him that you were going to Chicago with me, got drunk, and spent the night.",
        "Katie: You must still be drunk. That sounds awful.",
        "Mike: What, you think lying's better?",
        "Katie: I gave Brad such a hard time about being a responsible adult, and now look what I go do.",
        "Mike: I think it was very responsible not to drink and drive.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna call him at the studio. He's probably at the studio by now. [Katie sighs] Phil, hi. It's Katie. Is Brad there? Not yet. No. No messages. Just ask him if she'll postpone the shoot this morning. I'm in Chicago working on a story, and I'm not gonna be there on time. Thanks.",
        "Mike: What story are you working on?",
        "Katie: The story I'm gonna tell Brad so he doesn't divorce me.",
        "Mike: Aren't you gonna try Brad at home?",
        "Katie: No. I changed my mind. I'm gonna go home. It's easier to make up in person, 'cause you can kiss and things.",
        "Mike: Oh, yeah. I remember those things.",
        "Katie: Would you hurry up and finish your coffee! I got to get home!",
        "Mike: I -- no. I got to get rid of this headache before I can drive anywhere.",
        "Katie: Why are you so hung over? I had just as much to drink as you did, and I'm fine. Oh, God. Mm!",
        "[Mike chuckles]",
        "Mike: Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hi, hi. Yes. Hi. My name is Brad Snyder. My wife is missing, and I was wondering if you had any accident victims that came in last night that haven't been identified. She's a petite, really pretty blonde with a little longer than shoulder-length hair. What was she wearing? Are you -- are you telling me someone that -- that matches that description --",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Brad: Look, I don't know what she was wearing. What does it matter what -- what does it matter what she was wearing? I -- I don't remember.",
        "Janet: Bradley --",
        "Brad: What are you doing?",
        "Janet: She's okay. She called WOAK. She canceled the morning shoot. She's in Chicago. She's fine.",
        "Brad: She's okay?",
        "Janet: Yes.",
        "Brad: She's okay. Oh, oh!",
        "Janet: Oh! Look, its okay.",
        "Brad: Oh, okay. Uh --",
        "Janet: Where are you going?",
        "Brad: Where are my keys? Uh, Chicago.",
        "Janet: No, you can't go. You don't even know where Katie is!",
        "Brad: Oh, well, WOAK keeps a hotel room there, just for, you know, location shoots. Um -- she probably went there to cool off.",
        "Janet: Wait! The police told you not to leave town.",
        "Brad: Okay. If they come looking for me, uh, stall them. I'm not gonna miss my last chance for a conjugal visit with my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I thought that was delicious.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Dusty: Helps when you're starving.",
        "Meg: I can't believe I'm here with you. I went to your funeral.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Meg: So, how did you pull it off? I mean, you had at least two doctors that examined your body. Had a full autopsy.",
        "Dusty: I had help. Like I said, it was the only way to keep Craig off my tail while I was looking for Johnny.",
        "Meg: And then James brought you back here and -- I don't -- I don't get it. What does he want from you? What -- what information do you have?",
        "Dusty: From the time I got jumped in Bangkok to when you found me, I haven't seen or spoken to a soul.",
        "Meg: Until James brought you here and put you in that cage and he put me in the same cottage.",
        "Dusty: And he wants you to sign custody of your baby to him.",
        "Meg: Yeah. What does he want from you?",
        "Dusty: Let the cops ask him that after we get out of here.",
        "Meg: Okay. I'll get back to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Derek wasn't at the Lakeview?",
        "Bonnie: No. Not this morning. But Lisa said she'd check with the night crew.",
        "Carly: What did Derek say on the phone?",
        "Bonnie: He said he was gonna keep a low profile and he just knew that Stenbeck was gonna come after him. He was safer in jail.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no, no. This is Stenbeck we're talking about. If he wanted him hurt, if he wanted him dead, believe me, he'd be dead. And that's why we have to find him just as soon as we can. Has Henry heard from him?",
        "Bonnie: Derek would not find Henry. He locked him up in Fairwinds. So they're not exactly the best of buddies.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well -- well, I suppose that's the last known address you have for Derek then.",
        "Bonnie: The Fairwinds wine cellar?",
        "Carly: Oh, yes. And Stenbeck loves to hide stuff down there. There might be a clue there that -- that he could have left behind. The -- the problem is, how do we get in?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I'll take care of that.",
        "Carly: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Doesn't make any sense. That -- I just -- something's not right. Something is not right! I just -- I need to think!",
        "James: The evidence is right there in your hand.",
        "Paul: Why would Meg do this? Why would Meg come here? Why would she come to this island?",
        "James: To be with Dustin Donovan.",
        "Paul: Why wouldn't she just bring Dusty to her? It doesn't -- she wouldn't do that! She wouldn't hurt our baby like that.",
        "James: She has no problem hurting you.",
        "Paul: I disappointed her.",
        "James: Yes, you did. Look, everyone -- everyone thinks that Donovan is dead, and he wants to keep it that way. So he made arrangements to have Meg brought here.",
        "Paul: Why would Meg do something like that?",
        "James: Because you did disappoint her. And because Dustin Donovan's more of a man than you are, and she saw that --",
        "Paul: You shut up.",
        "James: -- And she went to him. It's as simple as that.",
        "Paul: Shut up! You shut up, or I'll kill you!",
        "James: You don't want me dead. Now find your wife and bring her home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't think I've been this sick since -- ever.",
        "Mike: Oh, I think I can remember a couple of times when we were married. So, while you were busy brushing your teeth for the 20th time, I ordered us some room service.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. I can't eat anything right now.",
        "Katie: Well, except for maybe --",
        "Mike: A roast beef sandwich, a chocolate milk, and a diet soda.",
        "Katie: You remembered that?",
        "Mike: The only cure for a Katie hangover.",
        "[Katie chuckles]",
        "Mike: It will be here soon. So I'm gonna go take a shower. You take your hangover cure, and then we'll get on the road.",
        "Katie: Okay, but get a good quick shower. I'm still very queasy.",
        "Mike: I'll be right back.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Water running]",
        "Katie: Brad?",
        "Brad: I knew you'd be here.",
        "Katie: How did you know I was in Chicago?",
        "Brad: Uh -- hey. Have you been crying all night?",
        "Katie: Okay. Actually, let me tell you about last night.",
        "Brad: Listen, listen, listen. Before you say anything --",
        "Katie: No, really.",
        "Brad: No, please, please, please, let me go first. You were right. I made a mistake. I have to face it. So I went to the police and made a full confession.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: What are they gonna do?",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, they're letting me go until they figure out the charges. But we probably should head back before they start looking for me. But first, I have to do this.",
        "Katie: I love you.",
        "Brad: We can get through this. We can get through anything together.",

        "Bonnie: Derek. Oh, my God. Are you all right?",
        "Derek: I'm so glad you're okay.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. When you didn't show up, I was really, really, really worried.",
        "Derek: How did you find me?",
        "Carly: Lucky guess, actually. Did Stenbeck put you down here?",
        "Derek: Yeah. He locked me up when I wouldn't run one of his errands.",
        "Bonnie: Well, what did he want you to do?",
        "Derek: Guard Meg on Faro Island.",
        "Carly: Far -- no. That's -- that's not right. She's in a place called Mattamoi. She sent Jack a text. He's on his way there now.",
        "Derek: Can you call him, head him off?",
        "Carly: You think the message was a fake?",
        "Bonnie: No, no, no, no, no. This is good. Jack is far away from danger, and Stenbeck won't even hurt Meg. What am I missing here?",
        "Carly: It's a trap, isn't it? Jack's walking into a trap.",
        "Derek: I can't be sure, but if Stenbeck wanted to get Meg out of the country, he'd probably want to create some kind of distraction. And killing a cop --",
        "Bonnie: That's a pretty big distraction.",
        "Carly: He's not answering his phone. Come on, Jack. Pick up!",
        "Bonnie: I'll call Dallas. I'll -- I'll get him to send somebody right over into Mattamoi.",
        "Carly: No. We don't have any proof. Do you think Dallas is gonna believe him?",
        "Bonnie: You said Jack was spooked. Maybe he called for backup --",
        "Carly: He can't. He can't call for backup. He's not a cop anymore. Come on, Jack! Pick up the phone!",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack. It's me. Listen, uh, Meg is not on Mattamoi. We found Derek. It's a trap, Jack. Get out of there.",
        "Bonnie: Look, I'm calling Dallas.",
        "Carly: Do what you can. Do anything you can to get them to send help.",

        "James: Oh, yeah. Good. And while you're thinking, Donovan's probably got your wife and child and leaving the country.",
        "Paul: Meg wouldn't leave. She wouldn't leave me.",
        "James: She's impulsive, and she's in love.",
        "Paul: So where are they?",
        "James: It's a small island. You can find them. Listen, Paul. Donovan hates you. He's lost his wife and his child. He's getting his revenge by stealing Meg and your baby. Don't just stand there. Go and fight for her. And Paul, you might need this.",

        "Brad: And you spent the night with your ex-husband?",
        "Katie: No. We just went out for a couple drinks.",
        "Brad: Right. And then, you know, one thing led to another, and you -- well, you know, all of the sudden, you're falling in bed together. Are you gonna try to tell me that this was an accident?",
        "Katie: No. I'm trying to tell you that nothing happened.",
        "Brad: The guy is in a towel.",
        "Katie: He just got out of the shower!",

        "Mike: Jail?",
        "Brad: You know, you told me to take responsibility for my actions. You know, what about your responsibility, Katie? We're married.",
        "Mike: Okay. I -- I got to say something. Brad, nothing happened -- nothing. We got drunk, and we spent the night. That's it.",
        "Katie: He's right. That's the truth. Nothing happened.",
        "Brad: Stop saying that! You didn't call me. You let me worry. You were upset, and you turned to a guy you used to love. That's not nothing, Katie.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry, Brad.",
        "Brad: You know, if there's nothing you taught me is that just because you say you're sorry doesn't make it all better.",

        "Dusty: Find something to block it out.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Dusty: To send an S.O.S. People will notice if it's blinking a distress signal.",
        "Meg: Well, what about James? Won't he see it?",
        "Dusty: James is inland. We'll point the light towards the water.",
        "Meg: I think he could still see it.",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna take that chance.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, do you have the gun handy?",
        "Dusty: Yes, I do.",
        "Meg: And it has bullets, right?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. It's got a full round.",
        "Meg: What? What's wrong with it?",
        "Dusty: This gun hasn't been fired in a while, so -- I can't clean it properly here. It might not go off when we need it to.",
        "Meg: So we have nothing else to use against James.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry. If he gets near you, I'll kill him, one way or another.",

        "Katie: I'm an awful wife.",
        "Mike: No, you're not.",
        "Katie: Yes, I am!",
        "Mike: No.",

        "Mike: Even me?",
        "Katie: Especially you. I was so angry at him for not acting responsibly, and then -- look at me. I'm no better. I'm the one who can't sustain a relationship. Brad's only been married one other time.",
        "Mike: Whoop-de-do. We should give him a medal.",
        "Katie: Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do. I mean, I know Brad would be better off without me.",

        "Dusty: I can look for boats and signal them all by myself.",
        "[Meg groans]",
        "Meg: But there haven't been any boats. What if we're in the middle of an inlet and no boats can pass through?",

        "Katie: I don't care how much it cost. I just cared about coming home to you.",
        "Brad: Okay. Whatever you got to say, you'd better say it quick, because I don't have much time.",
        "Katie: The police?",
        "Brad: Yeah. They haven't called yet, but, um -- I would just -- I don't know. I would rather wait this out alone.",
