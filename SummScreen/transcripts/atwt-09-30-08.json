        "Emily: Oh, good you're here. Hi.",
        "Susan: You told me to meet you here ten minutes ago. I thought I'd been stood up.",
        "Emily: Are you busy later today, Mom?",
        "Susan: Well, why?",
        "Emily: Um, well, I'm having a procedure done later, and I need somebody to drive me home. Can you do it?",
        "Susan: What kind of procedure? [Susan scoffs] Please, please. It's not an amino, is it? Please tell me you're not pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: 10:15? Okay. I'll make sure she gets the message. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Okay, so I'm heading into town. I have an appointment at the hospital.",
        "Aaron: Dr. Schiller?",
        "Alison: How did you know that?",
        "Aaron: That was them on the phone to confirm your appointment.",
        "Alison: It's at 10:15, right?",
        "Aaron: That's right. So what's up? That's Meg's baby doctor. Is there something you need to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: No, I'm not pregnant.",
        "Susan: Thank God.",
        "Emily: Wow. Tell me how you really feel.",
        "Susan: Look, I like Casey. I do. But if you think Margo has issues with you now, you make her a grandmother, it will never end.",
        "Emily: Ah! For God's sake, eat your bagel.",
        "Susan: Please, don't be mad.",
        "Emily: I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I just -- you have nothing to worry about, okay? I have no intention of having a baby with Casey, or anyone else, for that matter -- not after today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay. Don't get too excited there, Cowboy. I'm not pregnant. It's just a routine checkup.",
        "Aaron: Yeah? Well, everything seems fine to me.",
        "Alison: Well, I will make sure to tell Dr. Schiller that.",
        "Aaron: Okay, well, please do.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Aaron: There's nothing to worry about?",
        "Alison: No. Not at all. It's just, you know, if we're gonna try to get pregnant, I want to make sure that we're good to go.",
        "Aaron: I think we're better than good to go. In fact, why don't we meet here afterwards, and we can prove it?",
        "Alison: Sounds like a plan. I'll see you then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Sharon. I have an appointment today with Dr. Schiller.",

        "Carly: Jack, I'm okay.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: It was a trap, Jack -- all of it. James Stenbeck set you up. Meg's not even on this island. He led you out here to have you killed. When you went off that boat and I couldn't get you to breathe, I thought --",
        "Jack: No. Don't. Please, don't.",

        "Jack: It was a text.",
        "Carly: It was from James.",
        "Jack: Now, you knew what I was walking into. Are you crazy, coming after on your own? Why didn't you go to the police?",
        "Carly: I knew they wouldn't believe me. I had to get you as quickly as I could.",
        "Jack: Pretty good timing on your part. Oh, Man. Look at that.",
        "Carly: It looks bad, Jack. You're gonna need stitches.",
        "Jack: No, later, later. Right now, we've got to find Meg.",
        "[Jack groans]",
        "James: Stenbeck knows I'm here, and he still has Meg. We passed Faro Island on our way over. All we have to do is find another boat.",
        "Carly: Oh. I left mine in my other handbag. And after what that guy did to you on the boat, I'm not about to ask any of the locals for help.",
        "Jack: Who says we're gonna ask? Come on.",

        "Dusty: Well, I'm not. And I'll explain it to you --",
        "Paul: Get your hands off my wife.",
        "Dusty: Okay. See? No problem.",
        "Paul: Why are you doing this Dusty? Is this you? You went through all of this just to try and get Meg back?",
        "Dusty: You're making no sense.",
        "Paul: No?",
        "Meg: Dusty -- Paul. Oh, my God. What are you doing with that?",
        "Paul: What are you doing with him?",
        "Meg: I know. I know, it's a shock, but Dusty helped me. He helped me get away from James.",
        "Paul: stop, stop. No more lies. I want the truth. You left me for Dusty, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You're having your tubes tied?",
        "Emily: Why are you so surprised? I thought you, of all people, would be thrilled.",
        "Susan: Cut the sarcasm, please. This isn't something you decide to do overnight.",
        "Emily: I didn't. I -- I've thought a lot about it, Mother. Believe me.",
        "Susan: Well, uh, why? Just tell me why. To do something this extreme, you need a good reason.",
        "Emily: Mother, I like my life the way it is right now, okay? I -- I like it. I like -- I love being a mother to Daniel. But having another baby, now? It just doesn't fit into my plans.",
        "Susan: I can't believe I'm asking, but what does -- what does Casey think about this?",
        "Emily: What do you mean?! It's not Casey's decision! It's mine, and my mind is made up!",
        "Susan: Okay. What if you and Casey break up?",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Susan: That's right. What if you meet someone -- someone you want to have a baby with?",
        "Emily: You know what? Casey and I -- our relationship is very -- this is why I don't talk to you about things like this.",
        "Susan: No, it isn't. I know you, Emily, and that scenario -- you meeting somebody else -- that's a very real possibility.",
        "Emily: Well --",
        "Susan: And if you haven't considered that, then you're not ready.",
        "Emily: All right, forget it, okay? My mind is made up. I'm doing this. So, if you want to have more grandchildren, you better go talk to Ali.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: So, overall, your health is good?",
        "Alison: As far as I know, except for a little cold. But you're the doctor. You tell me.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, you don't smoke. You don't drink. Any, uh, drug use I should know about?",
        "Alison: Um -- I -- I, um -- I had a problem with crystal meth for a while. But I -- I mean, I've been clean now for over a year.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Oh. Well, that's good. Have you participated in any 12-step program?",
        "Alison: Definitely. Definitely. I -- I couldn't have done it alone.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Still going to meetings?",
        "Alison: When I need to.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Good.",
        "Alison: Yeah. But the reason I am here is that my husband and I were trying to have a baby, so we stopped using protection.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, that's a start.",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Any other problems? Any, fever, discharge, lower-abdominal pain?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Any pain during intercourse?",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Schiller: Okay well, then it sounds like everything is -- is the way that I should be. But since you are trying to get pregnant, I would like to do an ultrasound.",
        "Alison: An ultrasound? Why? Do -- do you think there'd be a problem?",
        "Dr. Schiller: No, no, no. It's just that you haven't been here in a while, and I want to do a more thorough exam, so we don't run into any surprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I got to get going to the hospital.",
        "Susan: Well, you want me to take you?",
        "Emily: No, no. Look, I don't want to make a big production out of this. Can you just pick me up afterwards?",
        "Susan: Of course I will.",
        "Emily: Okay. I'll see you later. Mother, stop. I got to go. Hi, Dani.",
        "Dani: Hi. Hi.",
        "Susan: Hey, Dani.",
        "Dani: You seem a little distracted. Everything okay?",
        "Susan: Oh --",
        "Dani: Did Emily stick you with the bill again?",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Susan: No. She just told me something, and it floored me.",
        "Dani: Is everything all right?",
        "Susan: I don't know. She's on her way to the hospital to have some minor surgery.",
        "Dani: Oh. And you think maybe it's not as minor as she's saying.",
        "Susan: It is and it isn't. I just hope she's not doing something that she's gonna regret. I'm sorry, Sweetie. I -- I got to go.",
        "Dani: Okay. Hey. It's me. Can you meet me at Java?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, I love you. I would never leave you.",
        "Paul: I saw the room.",
        "Meg: What room? What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: At the cottage. Your little love nest.",
        "Dusty: No love nest. Come on.",
        "Paul: Stop it. I know when I'm being lied to.",
        "Meg: James brought me to that cottage because he wanted the baby -- our baby. I -- I had no idea Dusty was even alive. When I was trying to get away, that's when I found him.",
        "Paul: Oh. You two just found each other. Like you found me when I was lying at the bottom of the ravine, everybody thought I was dead? We had our little cottage, too, Meg. You don't remember that?",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Dusty: Meg didn't know I was alive. Nobody did. James was holding me prisoner.",
        "Paul: Really? If that's true, then why did James bring Meg here?",
        "Dusty: Because he wanted her to find me, just like he wants you to find us. It's a setup. Let's not fall into the trap.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This looks just like Paul described it -- the path, the windows, everything.",
        "Jack: It's also the only cottage this damn island.",
        "Carly: Jack, look. This -- this is the sign that Paul saw in his vision. \"Swans Down cottage.\" So the swans -- they had nothing to do with the name of the island, Jack. It's the name of the cottage!",
        "Jack: Stay here.",
        "Carly: No, no. You've got one good hand. You're not going in there alone.",
        "Jack: Fine. Just keep an eye on me, okay?",
        "Jack: Something's off.",
        "[Knocking sound]",
        "Jack: Stay right here.",
        "[Man hits Jack over the head. Jack falls down]",
        "Carly: Jack! Jack!",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "James: Good work. Come on. Get them out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The only one setting traps around here is you, Dusty. And I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not stupid enough to fall for your lies again.",
        "Meg: Paul, nobody's lying to you.",
        "Paul: Really? I saw it, Meg. I saw the house. I saw the cottage. I saw the bed where you two slept together.",
        "Dusty: James is messing with your head.",
        "Paul: No, you're the one who's doing that, Dusty. You're just trying to get at me for what I did to my sister.",
        "Dusty: Let's not bring your sister --",
        "Paul: You've been trying to get revenge for years. You're gonna try and take Meg and my baby away from me?",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Meg: No!",
        "Dusty: What are you gonna do? Kill me?",
        "Paul: Can't kill a dead guy.",
        "[Gun cocks]",
        "Meg: Paul, put the gun down.",
        "Dusty: Meg, get behind me.",
        "Meg: You need to listen to me.",
        "Paul: You're protecting him?",
        "Meg: I am protecting us -- you and me and our baby.",
        "Paul: Dusty's not gonna raise my child.",
        "Meg: No, he is not. You're right. Put the gun down! Listen to me. I'm yours. I want you.",
        "Paul: And Dusty?",
        "Meg: Dusty is a friend. He was helping me find my way back to you. Look, take me home, okay? I just want to go home.",
        "James: Don't listen to her, Paul. She's lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: H -- hold on. Who -- who told you that Emily's having surgery today?",
        "Dani: Susan did. That's why I was surprised that you were in class -- 'cause I thought you'd be taking Emily to the hospital.",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Dani: So, she didn't say a word about anything medical?",
        "Casey: All she said is she's gonna have a really busy day today, and --",
        "Dani: I can't believe you didn't know.",
        "Casey: Obviously, she didn't want me to.",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Casey: It went straight to voicemail.",
        "Dani: Well, that's probably because she is already in the hospital, Casey.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. I got to get out of here. This is so typical of her. She doesn't want me to worry.",
        "Dani: Well, hey, maybe you shouldn't. I mean, Susan said it was only a minor surgery.",
        "Casey: I don't care what it is. I'm not gonna let her go through this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Roth: I just wanted to review what we talked about the other day. Tubal ligation surgery's common, but it can be life-altering, and you need to assume that the results from today will be permanent.",
        "Emily: I understand.",
        "Dr. Roth: You don't seem to have any doubts. But if you do, I strongly recommend postponing the procedure?",
        "Emily: No. No doubts.",
        "Dr. Roth: Good, because even though there are surgeries to reverse the sealing of the fallopian tubes, it's not a guarantee. If you were to decide to have another child, which, at your age, isn't out of the realm of pos --",
        "Emily: Excuse me, Dr. Roth.",
        "Dr. Roth: Yes.",
        "Emily: May I borrow your pen, please?",
        "Dr. Roth: We'll perform the procedure with the laparoscopy. You'll be under a general anesthesia. The whole thing will take about 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "Emily: Well, I've got to hand it to you guys. If anything, you are efficient.",
        "Dr. Roth: We try. Your gown is right there. An orderly will be in to take you down to pre-op.",
        "Emily: Great. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: Alison, I need to talk to you.",
        "Alison: Uh-oh. It's bad news? I mean, you said I didn't have anything to worry about.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, I didn't think that there was anything to worry about. But, something showed up on the ultrasound.",
        "Alison: The ultrasound? I mean, I don't know what would have shown on that. I -- I'm not pregnant, yet.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Alison, you have a condition that could make getting pregnant very difficult, if not impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack. Hey. Hi.",
        "Jack: Oh, my head! Son of a --",
        "Carly: I know. Get up slowly, okay?",
        "[Jack groans]",
        "Carly: James knocked you out.",
        "Jack: James? Where the hell are we?",
        "Carly: We're nowhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: She's lying, Paul. Not one word is true. I know it, and you know it.",
        "Paul: You shut up.",
        "James: You gonna listen to me, or you gonna listen to this whore? You gonna listen to this whore?",
        "Dusty: Watch your mouth, old man.",
        "Meg: You're not even gonna act like you're surprised to see him?",
        "James: No. Paul's the one that's surprised. He's devastated. He's been sick with fear he's gonna lose you, lose his wife. And he comes in, and he finds you with your former lover, your first lover.",
        "Meg: Don't list to him, Paul. He is twisting everything.",
        "James: She can't love you. You're weak. You're pathetic. That's the reason she's here with Donovan -- because he's the man you're not.",
        "Meg: That's not true. Your father always does this to you. He's trying to get to you.",
        "James: I'm not your enemy, Paul. Here's your enemy right here. So get rid of him once and for all.",
        "Dusty: You want to see your enemy, Paul?",
        "Paul: Hold it.",
        "Meg: Dusty, no.",
        "Dusty: He's right here.",

        "Dusty: The devil himself. He's to blame for everything! You say the word, Paul, and I'll do it. It would be a pleasure.",
        "James: I'm proud of you, Paul. Now show me you deserve it. Shoot the man that's been sleeping with your wife. He wouldn't hesitate to shoot you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I mean, it has to be a mistake. Could you do another test, please?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Alison, I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Well, how do I have this -- this pelvic inflammatory disease? I mean, I don't -- I feel fine. And -- and all those questions you asked me -- well, all my answers were no.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Yes, I know that. And that's -- that's one of the problems with P.I.D. -- sometimes there are no symptoms. Which makes diagnosing it very tricky.",
        "Alison: Can you make it go away? Is there a cure?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, you know, with -- with antibiotics, you'll -- you'll be fine. But, Alison, it does cause damage, and sometimes, the damage is -- is the kind that compromises the reproductive system.",
        "Alison: Has it?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, you do have some swelling in the fallopian tubes. And swelling and scar tissue can sometimes trap the egg and keep it from being fertilized and traveling down into the uterus.",
        "Alison: So, I can't get pregnant?",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Alison: How did this happen?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, most commonly, it's caused by a bacterial STD. Of course, people with multiple sexual partners are at greater risk.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Even -- even one partner with gonorrhea or Chlamydia can expose you to infection. I have to ask. Have you engaged in any high-risk sexual activity? Alison --",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Alison: I -- I can't -- I can't talk about this right now. I have to go.",

        "Casey: Well, what are they -- what are they doing to you?",
        "Emily: A tubal ligation. It's exactly what it sounds like. I'm having my tubes tied. Cay, we can talk about this late okay? Right now, you need to --",
        "Casey: No, no. We're not talking about this later, 'cause you're not gonna do this.",

        "Carly: I can't figure out where we are on this stupid map. Maybe if we could see land. Jack -- hey.",
        "Jack: It's okay. I'm here.",
        "Carly: You're pale.",
        "Jack: Why do you think I'm trying to catch some rays?",
        "Carly: You know, your jokes are no funnier than they were before.",
        "Jack: Best I could do on short notice. I'm sorry. So, what do you think, Carly? If Stenbeck s ill has Meg, what do you think his master plan is, huh? Why'd he lure us all out here?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I guess we'll figure that out when we get back on dry land. Oh, God, Jack. Jack, you're losing so much blood.",
        "Jack: I'm fine.",
        "Carly: No, you're not. You're not fine.",
        "Jack: What are you doing?",

        "Emily: Well, this isn't your decision, case. It's my body.",
        "Casey: But -- but I'm someone you're supposed to trust. God, how -- how can you do this without even talking to me?",
        "Emily: What -- we did talk about this. I told you. I didn't want to have any more children.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Emily: What did you think I meant when I said that?",
        "Casey: Oh, because you know what you want and what you don't want. You don't want to be married. You don't want to have kids. When are you gonna decide that you don't want to be with me, huh?",
        "Emily: You're being ridiculous.",

        "Emily: You're not.",
        "Casey: Well -- well, then why right now, huh? We were doing so good with each other. Wha -- why are you here?",

        "Dr. Schiller: You haven't spoken to her?",
        "Aaron: No. Dr. Schiller, is there something I should know about my wife?",

        "Alison: No. I'm not pregnant, and I'm never going to get pregnant.",
        "Chris: Come on. I mean, just because you're not pregnant now doesn't mean you're never gonna be.",
        "Alison: She told me I can't, Chris, okay? And you know why? Because I'm a slut, or I was. I don't really think it makes a difference anymore.",
        "Chris: Hey, of course it does. Hey, look at me. You're not a slut.",
        "Alison: No, you're right. I was paid for it. So I guess that makes me what, an entrepreneur?",
        "Chris: Stop it. That's all over now, Ali. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what you do afterwards. That's what counts.",
        "Alison: But I can't do anything, Chris. This is a mistake that I am gonna have to pay for for the rest of my life. And Aaron, too, because he married me. And -- and if he had known --",
        "Chris: He might have still married you.",
        "Alison: I can't be the wife that he deserves. I can't give him the one thing that he wanted.",
        "Chris: A baby?",
        "[Alison sobs]",
        "Chris: Is that what you want, too -- to have a baby with Aaron?",
        "Alison: Yes. And I -- I didn't even know how much until I suddenly imagined my life without one -- what it would be like to live my life without ever hearing a little voice call \"Mommy\" and knowing that they meant me.",
        "Chris: It will happen. I know it will. You're gonna be out in the playground with all those other soccer moms, because you're total soccer mom material.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Chris: And you're gonna hear a little voice, and it's -- it's gonna call out, \"Mommy, Mommy!\" And you'll look up, and you're gonna watch, because you know that little person belongs to you.",

        "Dr. Schiller: I know this is a lot to take in, but as I told Alison, we can treat the P.I.D. with antibiotics. The downside is that any damage that may have been caused is -- is not reversible.",
        "Aaron: I get that. I get the facts. But what can I do? What can I do for Alison? How can I make this better for her?",
        "Dr. Schiller: My advice -- show her that, uh, this doesn't change the way you feel about her. That's what's most important.",
        "Aaron: Thank you.",
        "Alison: Aaron, what are you doing here?",
        "Aaron: Ali! Well, you -- you didn't come home. I got worried. I just talked to -- to Dr. Schiller.",

        "Dani: Uh, when people say \"Procedure\" the way that you just did -- okay. What the hell? I'm just gonna ask. She's not pregnant, is she?",

        "Carly: All right. Slow down. You feeling better?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I guess I was just a little dehydrated. That's all. So you said you were able to get in touch with Dallas.",
        "Carly: Yeah. There's an abandoned ranger station not too far from here. I found a phone. Dallas is sending the police now.",
        "Jack: Any word on James or Meg?",
        "Carly: Meg's fine. She was found.",
        "Jack: Great. And James?",
        "Carly: He's dead. Apparently, there was an accident at a lighthouse or something, and he fell. Dallas didn't have any more details than that.",
        "Jack: Lighthouse. I remember seeing a lighthouse as we were coming ashore. It's probably what, two miles south from here? We might be able to make it.",
        "Carly: No. You are not going anywhere, Jack. If I saved your life, that means I'm responsible for it now. So this is how it's gonna go -- we are gonna sit here and wait for the police, and then you are gonna go to the hospital, and they're gonna look at your hand. You got me?",
        "Jack: You're kind of bossy. You know that?",

        "[Echoing]",
        "James: To answer your question, Paul, no, you didn't do what I wanted. I told you to kill Dustin. You merely put a bullet in his shoulder. A real Stenbeck would have stopped him cold. And now he's gone off with your wife, again. Don't say I didn't warn you.",
