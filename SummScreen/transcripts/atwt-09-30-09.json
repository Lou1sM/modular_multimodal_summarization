        "Janet: Is she down here?",
        "Jack: Who?",
        "Janet: Liberty. I just checked her room, and she's not there.",
        "Jack: Maybe she got up early.",
        "Janet: Yeah, and made her bed without me yelling at her?",
        "Jack: Okay, check your phone. Maybe she left you a message where she -- she spent the night.",
        "Janet: I did. She didn't call. There were no messages. And the last thing we told her was that Paul and Emily couldn't have her baby.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Janet: And you told me to let her have some space and cool down. And that's what I did, and she didn't come home last night!",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? Calm -- you need to calm down.",
        "Janet: You need to put out an APB for my daughter!",

        "Emily: Liberty, hi.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Paul: Croissant?",
        "Emily: Oh, no. Do you have morning sickness? You okay?",
        "Liberty: No. I'm -- I'm actually really hungry.",
        "Emily: Oh, here.",
        "Paul: Great.",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "Paul: How did you sleep?",
        "Liberty: It was actually one of the best night's sleep I've had in a while.",
        "Emily: Oh, wow. That's great. Sleep -- sleep is really good for you right now.",
        "Liberty: You guys, that bed you have in your guest room is amazing.",
        "Paul: Glad you like it.",
        "Liberty: Don't get me wrong. I'm not dissing the farm or anything, but it has been so tense around there lately. And me not coming home last night is only gonna make it worse.",
        "Paul: Emily was talking to you yesterday about how stress is really bad for the baby, right?",
        "Liberty: Oh, I know. I'm sure she's right. I just have no idea how to change that.",
        "Paul: Well, the best way to avoid stress is to avoid stressful situations.",
        "Emily: That -- that's right. That's right. And listen, if -- if there's tension at home, the best thing you can do is move in with us until you have that baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can't put out an APB on Liberty.",
        "Janet: Yes, you can! Yes, you can. Do you want me to help you? Here, give me the phone. I'll do it for you, okay?",
        "Jack: Honey, why don't you -- why don't you grab the phone and call her? Have you called her? Have you left a message saying you're worried?",
        "Janet: I tried to.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: I'm afraid that if she doesn't answer, that means that she's mad at me, or she's having a -- and I -- and I can't even go there, Jack.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right, listen. But not knowing -- that's making it so much better, isn't it? Call her, at least. If she answers the phone, then you'll know you're worrying for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Liberty: Uh-oh. Hi, Mom.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, where are you?",
        "Liberty: I'm having breakfast.",
        "Janet: You didn't come home last night. Are you okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm still pregnant, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Janet: Where did you spend the night? Why didn't you call me?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I, uh -- I stayed at a friend's and crashed before I got around to calling you. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: Yeah, you better be. Do you know how worried I was?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I do. It's all you seem to be doing these days.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, that's because you're going through a lot right now. And I just want to make sure you're taking care of yourself.",
        "Liberty: I will be home soon, Mom.",
        "Paul: How's your mother?",
        "Liberty: Oh, she's hysterical, as usual. And it's my fault, as usual.",
        "Emily: Well, hang on. You have to at least finish your breakfast before you go.",
        "Liberty: Thank you, but I -- I can't. I can already feel my stomach tying into knots.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? That settles it. For the sake of this baby, you are moving in with us.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I -- I wish, but there's no way my mom would ever let that happen.",
        "Emily: Well, then, Paul and I will go with you and convince her. Let's go.",
        "Paul: Wait. I -- I can't. Eliza's mine this morning. I have to go pick her up.",
        "Emily: No! This has to be done this minute. We cannot wait. She cannot be in this state for another minute. We're gonna go down to the farm and pack your things, okay?",
        "Liberty: Hey, are -- are you sure? You don't know what you're getting into it with my mom.",
        "Emily: Okay, your mother has no idea what she's getting into with me. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Tom: Nothing.",
        "Margo: What are you doing here?",
        "Tom: I thought I'd stop down, and we'd go to the hearing together.",
        "Margo: Oh, oh! Right, yes, okay. Sorry.",
        "Tom: And could you do us both a favor and breathe?",
        "Margo: What about Adam?",
        "Tom: I'm pretty sure he's breathing all by himself.",
        "Margo: No, I mean how is he?",
        "Tom: He's okay. Said he needed a little time to himself, so I told him we'd meet him at the courthouse.",
        "Margo: Good, okay. It's gonna happen, isn't it?",
        "Tom: Thanks to Maddie.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. Thank God she came back to town, huh?",
        "Tom: Well, we're pretty lucky that she's willing to come through for Adam.",
        "Margo: Yeah. It's gonna be okay, 'cause once she gets up on the stand, she tells the truth, then the charges will be dropped, and everything will be back to normal.",
        "Tom: Not everything.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. Casey. But Casey -- he'll be fine. He'll have to deal with it, right? Right? Because once the case is settled, then we can work on getting our family back to where it's supposed to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Whoa. Hey, no, no, no. Uh-uh, no, no. Her money is no good here.",
        "Alison: No, I can't let you do that.",
        "Adam: Are you kidding me? 'Cause it's the least I can do. I owe you so much after -- after you got Maddie to come back here and testify for me.",
        "Alison: Okay, it didn't take much convincing. It seemed to me like she had been wanting to set the record straight for a long time. Oh, so when is the hearing?",
        "Adam: Today, actually.",
        "Alison: Today?",
        "Adam: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Shouldn't you be preparing or meditating or whatever?",
        "Adam: I came to -- to try some herbal tea, actually. I hate it, but they say it's supposed to calm your nerves. And then I -- I saw you, and I figured I'd talk to you instead.",
        "Alison: Wow.",
        "Adam: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: I rank higher than herbal tea? Good to know.",
        "Adam: Yeah, see, you put a smile on my face already. It's not easy, having hope for the first time in a long time. I don't trust it.",
        "Alison: You deserve a chance to restart your life, Adam. Everyone does.",
        "Adam: I just wish it didn't come at your expense.",
        "Alison: 'Cause of Casey?",
        "Adam: Look, Alison, he didn't want you to help me.",
        "Alison: You know, I know that's what he says, but, I mean, you're his brother. I have to believe that deep down, he loves you.",
        "Adam: Well, it must be really deep down.",
        "Alison: You know, it may take some time, but he'll come around.",
        "Adam: I hope so, for both of our sakes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Good morning. I'm still here.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I can see that. The question is, why?",
        "Maddie: I saw your parents leave, and I thought I'd slip in and pay you a little visit.",
        "Casey: But, um -- yeah, you used the --",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I remembered some of our old tricks when I used to live here.",
        "Casey: We did sneak in here a lot, didn't we?",
        "Maddie: We used to do a lot of things. But that is not what I am here to talk about.",
        "Casey: Did you think about what I said?",
        "Maddie: About not testifying for Adam? Yeah, I couldn't think about anything else last night.",
        "Casey: Well, uh, what did -- what did you decide?",
        "Maddie: That there's a name for what you're doing -- emotional blackmail -- and I don't like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Mm! Oh, thank God! Thank God! Don't ever do that to me again!",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Liberty, no matter how mad you are at your mom, can you just text her to let her know where you are so she doesn't worry herself half to death?",
        "Janet: Yeah!",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Janet: Do you want something to eat. Do you want some eggs or something? Can I fix you a plate?",
        "Emily: Oh, you know what? She had croissants and a big glass of O.J.",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Liberty: I, uh -- I had breakfast at Fairwinds with Paul and Emily.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Liberty: That's where I spent the night last night.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Emily: I thought she needed to get away.",
        "Janet: I'm not talking to you. Liberty, what is going on here?",
        "Liberty: I really needed a break, Mom.",
        "Janet: A break?",
        "Emily: Yeah, from all the stress you're putting on here. She's here two minutes, and you're already giving her the third degree?",
        "Janet: My relationship with my daughter is none of your business.",
        "Emily: Actually, actually, it is my business. She made it my business when she chose us to adopt her child. And together, we've decided that Liberty's gonna live with us until she gives birth.",
        "Janet: Over my dead body! There is no way my daughter is moving in with you. You have no claim over her or her baby.",
        "Emily: I'm not sure Liberty feels that way.",
        "Janet: Oh, please. Do not tell me how my daughter feels.",
        "Liberty: Stop, okay? I -- I can't handle this yelling again.",
        "Janet: Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right, which is why Emily is leaving.",
        "Liberty: No, Mom. That -- that's why I'm leaving.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, do you really think moving in with a couple of strangers is gonna help anything? It's not. You need stability. Paul and Emily are the opposite of that.",
        "Emily: Excuse me!",
        "Janet: Hey, if you don't like it, you can leave.",
        "Liberty: And so can I.",
        "Janet: No. Sweetie, please, let's talk about this. Let's work it out.",
        "Liberty: Mom, we have not worked anything out since I got pregnant. You keep telling me that what I want is wrong.",
        "Janet: That's because I want you to make the right decision.",
        "Emily: And who decides what that right decision is, Liberty or you?",
        "Janet: Okay, that's it. For the last time, stop it, all right?! That's enough!",
        "Jack: You know what? No, I'm dragging us out right now. Let's go.",
        "Janet: No! If you think that I'm gonna let her take my daughter and baby- snatch her, you're wrong!",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? I think you're going about this all wrong.",
        "Janet: What?! You think I'm supposed to just let my daughter leave?",
        "Jack: Yeah, let her leave, just for now.",
        "Janet: Never.",
        "Jack: You can't lock her up. Brad tried that. Didn't work.",
        "Janet: I know everything out of my mouth is just driving her further away. I get that. I just don't know what to do, Jack. You got to help me get out of this mess!",
        "Jack: Honey, I will. If you'll let me, I will. But you need to calm down and let me try and help you, okay?",
        "Janet: Okay. Okay, okay. Just hurry. Please, go.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey. I'm gonna go pack my stuff.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, wait. Don't forget to take a jacket. It's getting pretty chilly out there.",
        "Liberty: Okay, I will.",
        "Janet: Where the hell do you get off turning my daughter against me?",
        "Emily: Well, look in the mirror, lady. You did that all by yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You know, I really hate the way that you put me in the middle of you and your brother.",
        "Casey: You kind of put yourself there, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Me testifying for Adam has nothing to do with the way that I feel about you. You know that I care, that I've always cared. You were the one that broke up with me, remember, not the other way around.",
        "Casey: Don't you see? That was Adam's fault, too.",
        "Maddie: You can't be serious.",
        "Casey: Everything in my life went wrong when Adam turned on me and the family.",
        "Maddie: He didn't make you a gambling addict, Casey.",
        "Casey: No, no, but he knew I had a problem, and instead of helping me, he used it against me, just like he's using you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Oh, no. Oh. Hey, it's my hearing.",
        "Alison: Well, good luck, though I really don't think you'll need it.",
        "Adam: Thanks.",
        "Alison: Look, you know, I have the whole day off, so I'm probably just gonna be nursing my coffee for a while. Come back and, let me know how it goes, okay?",
        "Adam: Okay. You know, Casey has no idea how -- how lucky he really is to have you.",
        "Alison: Actually, I really hope he does, and that once all this is over, we can get things back on track.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: He's still a liar and a cheat. He hasn't changed.",
        "Maddie: He seems different to me.",
        "Casey: How? Would an honest guy put his mom through hell because he's afraid to pay for what he did? Would an honest guy turn Alison against me?",
        "Maddie: Is that what this is about -- you and Alison?",
        "Casey: No, no. It's not just that. He -- he's turned my parents against each other.",
        "Maddie: I thought that they were pretty tight.",
        "Casey: Dad didn't want to defend Adam, but Mom put the pressure on him. You know, she didn't give him any other choice.",
        "Maddie: Still, your dad wouldn't have taken the case if he thought Adam wasn't worth defending. Whether you like it or not, I think so, too.",
        "Casey: And who's gonna defend you, Maddie, huh? When your testimony gets you in trouble? I can't stand by and let Adam hurt you, not again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Hey.",
        "Margo: Hey! Adam, hey. Oh! We're in the home stretch. Everything is gonna be okay.",
        "Adam: I'm actually -- I'm actually starting to believe that myself.",
        "Margo: Well, do believe it. It's gonna be a great day.",
        "Adam: What about you, Dad? Any -- any predictions?",
        "Tom: No guarantees, but with Maddie's testimony, I think the odds are pretty good that you'll be spending the night with us at home tonight.",
        "Adam: You think?",
        "Margo: He thinks. I know. We're gonna close this chapter of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I overreacted when I saw Adam trying to kiss Gwen. I was wrong.",
        "Casey: No, you weren't. He -- he tried to force himself on her.",
        "Maddie: But it wasn't rape, Casey. I know that now. He would have let her go if I would have given him the chance, but I didn't. I almost killed him. He didn't deserve that, and he didn't deserve what happened afterwards.",
        "Casey: But if you testify, he's going to walk.",
        "Maddie: If a judge decides that he's not guilty, then that's how it goes.",
        "Casey: Okay, what if the same judge decides you should be punished for trying to bury him alive?",
        "Maddie: It will be all right, Casey. I will be all right.",
        "Casey: The only way to know for sure is for you not to testify.",
        "Maddie: Does it really mean that much to you?",
        "Casey: You mean that much to me. You know, I've been to prison, and I can't stand the thought of you having to deal with that.",
        "Maddie: Thank you. Thank you for caring.",
        "Casey: I'll always care for you. Listen, you -- you have to do what you have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know, it's really not that bad. Fairwinds isn't that far away.",
        "Janet: I don't care if it's right next door. Liberty needs to be with family. You and Paul are not family.",
        "Emily: Liberty doesn't want to raise this child, and we do. It's a win-win for everyone. Why can't you see that?",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm sorry. I just can't see how you being the parents of my grandchild is a win-win.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? You can pass judgment all you like, but Paul and I have the ability and the resources to take care of this child. And I swear to you, we will -- we will love this baby with all our hearts.",
        "Liberty: I'm ready to go now.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, can we please just talk about this?",
        "Liberty: You mean stay and listen to you tell me what I'm doing is wrong? No more, Mom. I'll be outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What's that, Mr. Bunny? You want to hang out with Miss Eliza? Well, it's a good thing, 'cause here she is. Say hi to Mr. Bunny.",
        "[Jack clears throat]",
        "Paul: Mr. Bunny's running from the law.",
        "Jack: The housekeeper let me in. I hope I'm not disturbing you.",
        "Paul: I don't know. Do you think he's disturbing us? Thank you.",
        "Jack: Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I -- I would like it if you and Emily backed off the baby situation.",
        "Paul: The \"Situation\"? Liberty is asking us to adopt her baby. She's fine with it. I -- I didn't realize it was a situation.",
        "Jack: Listen, you already have a gorgeous baby of your own. Why do you need to rush into getting another one?",
        "Paul: Didn't realize there was a limit.",
        "Jack: There isn't.",
        "Paul: Emily would like it if we had a child of our own.",
        "Jack: Listen, there are thousands of babies out there. Choose one of them.",
        "Paul: What's the problem here, Jack? I mean, we didn't twist Liberty's arm into giving up her baby for adoption, and we didn't ask her to choose us.",
        "Jack: Then -- then you un-choose her. Because right now, all you're doing is upsetting Liberty and her mother.",
        "Paul: Oh! Okay, now I get it. This isn't about Liberty at all. You're worried that Janet's gonna go over the deep end.",
        "Jack: No. Liberty is my stepdaughter, and I have every right to look out for her best interests.",
        "Paul: You got to look out for her, Jack. If you'd like, I can write down what the warning signs are.",
        "Jack: There's got to be something we can do here, Paul.",
        "Paul: There's something you can do. You can get Janet to back off her prejudicial attitude towards me and Emily. Because Liberty wants us to be the parents of this child, and there's nothing you can do to stop that from happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, where are you? Are you -- you sure you told her the right time and place?",
        "Tom: No. Of course I did. I even sent her a text confirmation.",
        "Adam: Mom, I'm sure she'll be here.",
        "Clerk: People vs. Munson. The judge is ready for you.",
        "Tom: You coming?",
        "Margo: Yep, yep. Right behind you.",
        "Alison: Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Alison.",
        "Alison: Is the hearing over already? How did it go?",
        "Maddie: I don't know.",
        "Alison: Oh, did you leave before it was over?",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Alison: What's going on? Why aren't you there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Your honor, we'd like to request a brief recess.",
        "Judge: For what purpose?",
        "Tom: We're waiting on a key witness. I'm sure she'll be here soon. Must have been unavoidably detained.",
        "Judge: You have one hour, Counselor.",
        "Tom: Thank you, your honor.",
        "Margo: What happened with Maddie?",
        "Tom: I don't know, but there's still no message.",
        "Margo: This is not like her, Tom.",
        "Adam: No, it's not, but I think I know what happened.",

        "Maddie: I can't go through with this, Alison. Let it go, okay?",

        "Casey: Oh, because you love us so much?",
        "Adam: Believe it or not, I do. I love Mom and Dad. I love you.",
        "Casey: R -- really? Was it love that made you use my gambling addiction to set up Will? That my big brother that I looked up to used me to get to someone else's wife?",

        "Jack: I thought you didn't want to have any more children, because you had spent so many of your glory years raising Liberty by herself.",

        "Tom: Ms. Coleman, the court is aware that this was unintentional. You and the defendant were both victims of a terrible tragedy.",
        "Maddie: That's exactly it. And Adam, I am so sorry.",
        "Tom: So can we assume that if the same thing had happened to you, that you had woken up and found yourself mistakenly buried alive, would it have provoked a radical change in your mental state?",
        "Maddie: Definitely.",
        "Tom: In fact, anyone in that situation would understandably be traumatized.",

        "Tom: I would, your honor. I'd like the court to consider the extreme circumstances here. My client was suffering from a kind of post-traumatic stress that we couldn't even conceive of. Given what he was subjected to, I wonder if we can hold him accountable for his response to any of those things. But beyond that one of the two young women that he allegedly assaulted has come here to testify in his favor, and I think that urges the court toward leniency in this matter. I also have a signed affidavit from Gwen Munson stating that she would not object if the court were not to pursue this case. I respectfully request that all the charges be dropped.",

        "Margo: Well, without the guest of honor, there's no reason to rush Casey. You know, Adam's been under a lot of stress lately, and maybe, you know, it's pushing it to try to have a party. So, would you girls mind if we just did this another time?",
