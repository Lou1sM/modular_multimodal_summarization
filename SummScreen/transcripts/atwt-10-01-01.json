        "\r\nCarly: I already made her gown, Abigail.",
        "\r\nAbigail: I know. But it says -- look, it says that the modern bride should give \r\na nod to tradition whenever she can.",
        "\r\nMolly: We're okay in the tradition department, aren't we, Carly?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yeah. We're just gonna do something old, something new, something \r\nborrowed, something blue.",
        "\r\nMolly: Oh, how many times have I heard that?",
        "\r\nDonna: Finally! Finally! They just kept saying, \"One more, Nana. One more, Nana.",
        "\r\nJake: Nah, that's Bridget. She makes you read everything twice.",

        "\r\nJake: Actually, I'm trying figure out something.",
        "\r\nCarly: Don't you have someplace that you ought to be?",
        "\r\nJake: You know something? Who came up with this? I get kicked out of my own \r\nhouse!",
        "\r\nAbigail: It's tradition! And you can't ruin it, Jake. You're not supposed to see \r\nthe bride until she shows up at the altar.",
        "\r\nJake: Let me tell you something -- the bride's not supposed to live with the \r\ngroom before any of that. But did I say anything?",
        "\r\nCarly: Fine. If you want to put a hex on your own wedding --",
        "\r\nJake: Carly, it's a big place. I can lock myself in the bedroom.",

        "\r\nCarly: Out.",
        "\r\nMolly: Wait a minute, you. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I wanna give you a little \r\nsomething to tide you over. You know how much this means to me? Not just the \r\nwedding but -- everything.",
        "\r\nJake: Almost as much as it means to me. Now let me give you something to tide \r\nyou over.",
        "\r\nCarly: Okay, that's it, you guys. Really. The bride is very busy, Jake.",
        "\r\nJake: I'm just getting started!",

        "\r\nMolly: I'm sure. But --",

        "\r\nBruno: Well, that's what St. Maarten was supposed to be for. Look, if you're \r\ngonna sit there with that face, everybody's gonna wonder why I can't make my \r\nwoman happy. That does bad things for a man's ego. So could you please make an \r\neffort?",
