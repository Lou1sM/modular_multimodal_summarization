        "Carly: We should wait.",
        "Simon: For?",
        "Carly: We're not done.",
        "Simon: With?",
        "Carly: The apartment. This apartment. Simon, we had a deal. No conjugating until it's finished.",
        "Simon: Carly, Carly have you looked around this place? There is nothing left to do.",
        "Carly: We haven't sold it yet.",
        "Simon: But we will, okay? From the looks of that storm, right this very minute, roofs are leaking, basements are flooding. Young urbanites are going to have to flee their dwelling and come running to us with checkbooks in hand.",
        "Carly: But sleeping together, Simon? Here and now, it's just a bad idea.",
        "Simon: Okay, there is no work left to do, no tv to distract us, no one else around. What is stopping us from making the most of this?",
        "Carly: You still have a thing for Katie. I'm still in love with Jack.",
        "Simon: All right, so let's drink to our exes, wherever they are.",
        "Carly: And what's the point of that, exactly?",
        "Simon: The thing is, Carly, you can't exorcise a demon until you admit to them first. So, here's to Katie and Jack. And with the help of great sex, vanishing from our lives forever.",

        "Mike: There you are, my little angel. Kiss me.",
        "Katie: Honey, why are so calm? Why aren't you more surprised to see me? There are search parties out there combing the entire county. I had no idea what happened to you.",
        "Mike: You found me. You always do.",
        "Katie: Are you all right?",
        "Mike: I have a headache. Do we have any aspirin?",
        "Katie: Do you know where you are? Do you remember the accident at all?",
        "Mike: There was a pile-up at the interstate. I hit my head. That's why --",

        "Dusty: No, he's doing great.",
        "Lucy: Proving he probably would have been fine at home until we could get him to his regular doctor. But instead, I take your son, haul him out into the storm, nearly get us killed, as I wreck my car. I mean, Barbara probably called the S.W.A.T. team to arrest me for kidnapping her grandchild --",
        "Dusty: I'll take care of Barbara. You did good. You did real good.",
        "Lucy: Well, kiss Johnny for me. I better go check on my other patients.",

        "Nurse #1: Dr. Montgomery, more accident victims on the way.",
        "Lucy: I'll be right there. I got to go. You better get back to Johnny's room. I mean, somebody might put you to work.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you do that?",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Dusty: Put me to work. I'm not doing anything. I'm here all night.",

        "Meg: Get me a couple of warm towels. She's small and I don't want her temperature to drop.",
        "Emily: Meg, why isn't she crying? Why isn't she crying?",
        "Meg: Just give me a minute, Emily, okay? I need to dry her and keep her warm. We are treating her like a preemie. Just like in the hospital, all right?",
        "Paul: What's going on?",
        "Emily: What's wrong? What's going on? Why won't you let me see her?",
        "Paul: She's cold. She's just really cold like Meg says. You know what? Maybe I should go and -- figure out a way to turn on this heat, right?",

        "Katie: No, don't even worry about it. I don't care anymore. The most important thing is that you're safe. But why didn't you wait for the ambulance, Honey?",
        "Mike: I mean, I wasn't hurt that bad. Not like the other people. That's why I had to get home. Okay, if something had happened, I didn't want your last memory of us being, me being mad at you at the doctor's office. That would have driven me crazy.

        "Bob: Was she upset?",
        "Holden: A little bit, but the fact that she was able to piece things together, that's good, right?",
        "Bob: Well, you've got confusion, memory loss and even hallucinations. After what she's been through, that's not uncommon. You know, we've really got to give her time to recover. We can't push her. We've got to be patient.",
        "Holden: So if she has questions, should we fill in the blanks?",
        "Bob: You've got to warn everybody to be careful what they say to and around Lily -- that it doesn't alarm her. Listen, I'll get an orderly, and we'll take her back to the room.",
        "Holden: You know what, maybe luke and I should do it. I think that would be better.",
        "Bob: Okay, and I'll call the neurologist, and we'll all meet in her room, okay? Congratulations.",

        "Katie: Let's just not worry about getting pregnant.",
        "Mike: What are you saying?",

Talking about it too much and thinking about it too much and obsessing over it and taking the tests and taking the temperatures. I mean, it was all too much. I'm sick of it now, okay?
