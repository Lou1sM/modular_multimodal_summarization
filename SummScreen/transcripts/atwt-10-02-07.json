        "Carly: This diagnosis it kind of takes my emotions and dials them up to ten. I'm scared everything's going to mean too much. When it was the times when not much was happening and we all just kind of hung out that made me the happiest.",
        "Parker: You have to see this!",
        "Carly: What are you doing here? You should be at school.",
        "Parker: No, forget school. Look what I found.",
        "Carly: What? What is it?",
        "Parker: It's a way to save your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh! Dad, I'm sorry I didn't -- I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Holden: What's got you dancing? Good news?",
        "Luke: Ah, yeah. Yeah, definitely.",
        "Holden: Well, that's okay. If you don't want to tell me what it is, that's fine.",
        "Luke: Oh no, I mean right now, I could -- I could sing it from the rooftops! I can't believe it actually, but there's a really good chance that things could actually work out between me and Noah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Thanks. I've really got to thank you again, Dad.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Who else is going to make sure you get three squares a day?",
        "Noah: I didn't mean about buying me lunch. I meant -- I meant about accepting I'm gay.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I won't pretend any of this has been easy, Noah. But family always comes first.",
        "Noah: And you're the only family I've got. I didn't want to lose you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I would not let that happen.",
        "Noah: Still, you did this total 180. I mean, what happened that changed your mind?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You have no idea how far I'm willing to go to do what's right for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Car honking]",
        "Sly: Room service!",
        "Dusty: Why'd you come back?",
        "Sly: I couldn't let you croak out here. And if somebody was going to help you, might as well be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I was up all night surfing the internet. And I Googled brain lesions, like the one you have.",
        "Carly: Parker, I love you for this, I really do, but I want you to sleep at night, okay? I don't want you getting sick.",
        "Parker: I'm fine. You're the one who's sick and you need to get better. That's all I care about. Okay, so, there's this clinic in Berlin with a new kind of treatment --",
        "Carly: Parker, this treatment is experimental and it would take up almost all the time I have left, with no guarantees.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but if there's a chance it could save your life, isn't it worth it?",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, that would be real good, Sweetie. But there are also insurance issues. Going to Germany for unapproved treatments would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe more than that, I don't have that kind of money.",
        "Parker: I do. In the trust fund that Aunt Rosanna gave me.",
        "Carly: That's for you, that's not for me.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but this is for me! You're my mom. And I'd do anything to keep you around.",
        "Carly: You are fantastic, you know that?",
        "Parker: So will you do it? Will you sign up for that treatment?",
        "Carly: Honey, even if I thought this treatment could help me, you can't pay for it. You can't touch that trust fund until you're 21.",
        "Parker: What if it's an emergency? Aunt Rosanna will get us that money, Mom. All we have to do is call her!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Answer my question! Why did you suddenly case of amnesia about what Craig did to you? You lied on the stand.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no, I didn't lie --",
        "Paul: Rosanna come on!",
        "Rosanna: I didn't lie.",
        "Paul: We were so close to getting Craig put away!",
        "Rosanna: It wasn't like that --",
        "Paul: He must have got to you. Did he get to you?",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "Paul: Did he threaten you?",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "Paul: Well, he must have done something, Rosanna. What does he have hanging over your head?",
        "Rosanna: Okay, okay. All right. All right. If you want to know the truth, I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: It was a simple question, Craig. Did you have something to do with Rosanna suddenly losing her memory in court?",
        "Craig: How can you even ask me that?",
        "Meg: Simple. At first, you were sweating bullets about the hearing. You were terrified that Rosanna's testimony would send you back to prison.",
        "Craig: And anyone would be on edge given those circumstances.",
        "Meg: But today, everything changed. You were counting on Rosanna to have a sudden memory loss, weren't you?",
        "Craig: You know how much Rosanna hates me. Do you seriously think I could influence her testimony?",
        "Meg: I'm not stupid, Craig. And neither is Paul. He's going to figure out that's exactly what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Okay, now before I tell you this, I want you to know that I love you so much and that I would never, ever deliberately hurt you, but the truth is -- I have been lying to you ever since the day that you brought me home.",
        "Paul: You've been lying to me?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Ever since you brought me back to Oakdale. Do you remember that first night that we -- we were at the Lakeview and we saw Craig and Meg. And I saw then how much you hated Craig and how much you wanted to see him suffer for what he did to me so, I knew then that the only way that Craig could be punished for his crimes was if I remembered what he did. And so I started telling you what you wanted to hear.",
        "Paul: Yeah, until today, when you're on the stand. All of a sudden -- Rosanna, what happened?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I mean, I put my hand on the bible, I couldn't lie.",
        "Paul: Even if it means that now Craig can come between us?",
        "Rosanna: I couldn't do it. I couldn't lie under oath, Paul. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that this -- that this hurt you. Can you ever forgive me?",
        "Paul: Of course.",
        "Rosanna: Oh God, thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry, it was just this huge, huge, huge mistake and I will never ever, ever do something like this again. Okay? All right? So please just -- can you just tell me that we can just put it past us and get on with our lives and planning our marriage, and planning our lives together.",
        "Paul: You know I'd love nothing more than that, I wish we could, but I'm afraid right now this is impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sly: Ah, I felt lousy leaving you out here.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Sly: I started thinking about you rotting away like one of these rusted-out cars.",
        "Dusty: Cut the crap! Tell me what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'm sure you think that I'm an uptight, old-fashioned geezer who was never young. But I know what it's like being your age. I remember those feelings. Those feelings can make a young man do things he would not normally do.",
        "Noah: If you're saying I being gay is some stage I'll grow out of, I don't think so.",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, I don't mean that. Whether straight or whatever, young men can make mistakes.",
        "Noah: Like I did with Maddie. Because I wasn't being honest with myself, Dad.",
        "Colonel Mayer: She's a fine young woman. I know, I know it's over. I know. I won't push that anymore. Noah, I feel terrible about the way I treated you. I was wrong.",
        "Noah: That's okay, really.",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, it's not. What would you say to spending some time together, you and me, as father and son, so I can make it up to you?",
        "Noah: Seriously? I'd like that.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Good. Because I want to make amends. And not only to you, but to Luke. Can you help me do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Bottom line, we all must've underestimated Noah's dad because Colonel Mayer did a complete turnaround.",
        "Holden: Really?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I mean don't get me wrong, the guy's as conservative as they come. But he must really love his son because when push came to shove, he accepted Noah for who he is.",
        "Holden: That's great. I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and now that Colonel Mayer knows the truth, Noah's not afraid anymore, so --",
        "Holden: So, it means that there might be a chance for you two?",
        "Luke: Well, let's just say that Noah's giving all the right signals.",
        "Holden: Well, I hope it works out.",
        "Luke: Thanks, Dad. That means a lot. Noah, hey, I was just talking about you.",
        "Noah: Really? I was talking about you, too. Are you free this afternoon?",
        "Luke: Ah, yeah, yeah -- yeah, what's going on?",
        "Noah: It's my dad. He wants to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I cannot attest to what's going on in Rosanna's mind. I can't even tell you what happens to someone after two years being in a coma. What happens to their memory? I can only tell you, she did not testify, the result is, I'm free. Now I thought that would be something that we would want to celebrate.",
        "Meg: I never wanted to see you suffer, Craig.",
        "Craig: No, you're just a little disappointed I didn't get hauled out of court in leg irons.",
        "Meg: That is not true.",
        "Craig: Oh really? You're harping on all this honesty thing, okay. How about returning the favor? You demanded to be next to me in court and foolishly I thought it was because you wanted to support me. But you had your own agenda the whole time, didn't you Meg? You were hoping that Rosanna's testimony was going to send me straight to prison. And then you would have the perfect excuse to end our marriage and go back to Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, now you don't you want to be with me anymore?",
        "Paul: No, no, that's not what I said at all.",
        "Rosanna: But you just said that you don't want to go ahead with our wedding.",
        "Paul: What you said was that you didn't feel like you've made a full recovery. Rosanna, I feel like I'm partly responsible for that.",
        "Rosanna: No, how could you be responsible?",
        "Paul: I pushed you so hard to try and remember what Craig had done to you. I really, I should've had more patient.",
        "Rosanna: Look, this is not your fault. Do you understand? I am the one that convinced you that my memory was returning, I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: No, you don't have anything to apologize for. Look, if we are going to get married then we're going to get back to the life that we both want together, then you need to get better. So we'll get you the best doctors, we'll get you the best specialists available, whatever it takes, we'll spare no expense.",
        "Rosanna: But as long as I'm with you, I'm fine.",
        "Paul: Obviously, that's not true, or you would have made a full recovery by now. You getting your memory back, that's all that really matters right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Maybe this is why aunt Rosanna came back, so she can help you.",
        "Carly: Honey, Rosanna is going through a lot of her own stuff right now.",
        "Parker: Whatever. It can't be more important than saving your life. I'm sure she'll let me use my trust fund if we ask her.",
        "Carly: I'll call her, okay?",
        "Parker: Okay, but do it now. There's no time to waste.",
        "Carly: Yes, you're right. Time is precious. But that doesn't mean you get to play hooky. Go to school.",
        "Parker: Mom --",
        "Carly: Parker, I will talk to Rosanna, you go to school. We'll discuss it later, okay?",
        "Parker: Okay, but you've got to do this. I don't want to come home and find you crying again, like last night. Please call Aunt Rosanna right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Why do I get the feeling that you're not being honest with me?",
        "Paul: About what?",
        "Rosanna: You -- you're upset, aren't you?",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Paul: You going to get that? It might be important.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Rosanna: Hello?",
        "Carly: Hey Rosanna, it's me. I hate to give you such short notice, but I really need you to come over.",
        "Rosanna: You mean, right now?",
        "Carly: Yeah, as soon as you can.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: So sorry, that was Carly, she needs me. So, can we talk about this some more tomorrow?",
        "Paul: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, what do you want? You want money?",
        "Sly: Nah, somebody already cleaned you out.",
        "Dusty: Why are you being so gracious?",
        "Sly: Don't want his honor to come gunning for you again.",
        "Dusty: Who?",
        "Sly: You said the mayor was the one who did this.",
        "Dusty: No! No. Mayer is the guy's name. Winston Mayer. Army guy. A colonel.",
        "Sly: The hit man was a G.I.?",
        "Dusty: Listen to me -- if you take me to the hospital, I'll pay you.",
        "Sly: No hospitals. Gunshot victims get too much attention. Cops start asking questions. Can't risk it.",
        "Dusty: Give a message -- give a message to a friend. Tell her where to find me. She'll give you all the money you need, just tell her where to find me.",
        "Sly: You got a rich girlfriend, huh?",
        "Dusty: No -- no girlfriend. A friend.",
        "Sly: What's her name?",
        "Dusty: Lily -- Lily Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Welcome. Come on in.",
        "Noah: Mr. Snyder. You must be Noah's dad.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Colonel Winston Mayer.",
        "Holden: Holden Snyder.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Very nice to meet you. And what a beautiful farm you have here. This is the way people should live -- close to the earth, fresh air, natural bounty. You're very lucky.",
        "Holden: It's been in the family for a lot of years.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Is Mrs. Snyder around? Because she and I got off on the wrong foot. And she really does need to hear what I have to say.",
        "Holden: Actually she's not. She's on a scouting trip with my younger daughter.",
        "Luke: But I'm sure my mom, you know, understands -- why you reacted the way you did when she tried to help with Noah.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Young man, I owe your mother and you an apology. I was harsh with her, and I judged you based on my prejudice. And I was wrong. And I hope you and your mother can forgive me.",
        "Luke: Of course. Yes, thank you.",
        "Holden: Colonel, I'm sure that this hasn't been easy for you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I won't say I've completely come to terms with Noah's -- change in lifestyle. But he's my son, no matter what.",
        "Noah: This really means a lot to me, dad. I just knew that when you met Luke and his family -- I mean, they're great.",
        "Luke: And Noah speaks so highly of you. I mean, I know that he really looks up to you. So I'm very excited to get to know you, too.",
        "Holden: You know what? I have an idea. We're having a family dinner a little bit later -- Luke's two brothers will be here with us. I have some errands to run, but why don't you guys join us? It'll give us all a chance to get to know each other a little better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hey, Sweetie.",
        "Carly: Hey, thanks for coming.",
        "Rosanna: Sure, you sounded so serious on the phone. Has something happened?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Baby, I know that Jack marrying Katie was really awful, but you really have to be strong --",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. If only it were that simple. Why don't we sit down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You don't need to worry about Paul. He hates me now.",
        "Craig: Yeah, and if you got to settle for second best, why not me?",
        "Meg: Don't put words in my mouth, Craig.",
        "Craig: Do you believe me or not?",
        "Meg: I would like to believe you, but --",
        "Craig: There's a catch there, huh?",
        "Meg: After Rosanna basically exonerated you, I should be relieved -- elated, even.",
        "Craig: But you're not?",
        "Meg: I didn't know what to think.",
        "Craig: I have always told you how I felt about you, Meg, and I have been honest on that score. But if you are always going to doubt me. If you are going to believe and listen to whatever Paul or Rosanna or Holden or anybody else says about me, then this marriage is meaningless. It is over. So it is time for you to make a decision. You are either with me, or you're not. And if it is the latter, I would like you to go. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: But there must be something that we can do. I mean -- I'll pay for it, okay? I'll pay whatever it costs, okay? Whatever it takes to find a cure for you.",
        "Carly: I knew you would say that. I -- I've already gotten a dozen second opinions. Parker's even been looking online at some experimental treatment they're doing in Berlin.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, great. We go to Berlin. That's what we'll do. We'll take you there. Okay?",
        "Carly: You know what? If I thought that it would save my life, I'd be on the first plane, and I would not be too proud to let you pay for it. But I read about it, and the truth is, the kind of tumors they're working on, they're not like mine.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, well, that's too bad, but we'll find another treatment. Okay?",
        "Carly: I'm out of options, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Honey, come on. There must be something that I can do for you.",
        "Carly: There is. You are so lucky. You got a second chance at your life, Rosanna. Go for it. Are you engaged? Did Paul propose to you? That's great! That's wonderful! Congratulations! And you know something? I really, really, really, really want to be in your wedding. So do it soon, okay? What is it?",
        "Rosanna: Nothing.",
        "Carly: Hey, what is going on?",
        "Rosanna: Honey, there might not be a wedding. I love Paul so much, but he may not love me.",
        "[Rosanna remembering]",
        "Paul: Meg, you know who he is. And you know the things that he's done. Why can't you just walk away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Why would you say Paul doesn't love you?",
        "Rosanna: You know what? You really don't need to hear this right now.",
        "Carly: Don't do that. Don't treat me differently because I'm sick. I want the people I love to be happy. You're clearly not happy. I'm your sister, I want to help you.",
        "Rosanna: I love Paul. I can't lose him.",
        "Carly: Well, what could make you lose him?",
        "Rosanna: Meg Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You make up your mind, Meg. If you cannot fully commit to me, I want you out of here now.",
        "Meg: If Rosanna wasn't prepared to accuse you, then I have no right to mistrust you anymore.",
        "Craig: Not exactly a ringing endorsement from my wife.",
        "Meg: What do you want from me, Craig?",
        "Craig: I would like you to stop doubting me! I would like you to be a wife to me! In every way. Starting now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: That's really kind of you, Mr. Snyder, but we can't impose.",
        "Holden: It's really not a problem.",
        "Colonel Mayer: We'd be delighted to stay for dinner. Thank you.",
        "Holden: Great. I have a couple of things to take care of. Luke, why don't you show them around the farm?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Holden: I'll see you later.",
        "Luke: So, would you like to see our stables? My dad raises horses.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, if you don't mind, I'll just show myself around. I need the exercise and fresh air. Thank you.",
        "Luke: Wow. I mean, that is -- that's amazing! I guess people really can change their minds and come around.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, I did.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and I'm glad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sly: Lily Snyder? She owns that Lakeview hotel, right? Her mother's the richest woman in town.",
        "Dusty: That's right. Tell her where I am.",
        "Sly: And she'll pay big bucks? No cops?",
        "Dusty: No cops.",
        "Sly: Okay, where do I find her?",
        "Dusty: Farm --",
        "Sly: What farm? Where?",
        "Dusty: There.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You lied under oath?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I was desperate. So, I told the judge that I was confused, and I couldn't remember.",
        "Carly: Because Craig told you that if he went to prison, then Meg would go after Paul.",
        "Rosanna: Well, come on, I mean, I didn't want to believe it. But then I saw the cell phone footage that the P.I. shot. And I just couldn't bear the thought of losing Paul. So I lied, and I let Craig go free.",
        "Carly: Wow -- that doesn't sound like you. But I do understand, probably better than anyone, what it's like to go to any lengths to hold onto the person you love.",
        "Rosanna: Be honest with me, Carly. You think I made a big mistake, don't you?",
        "Carly: I'm in no position to judge.",
        "Rosanna: Come on, tell me the truth. Please, please just don't -- don't spare my feelings.",
        "Carly: Well, I have done my share of lying. What I found out is the more I lied, the more I pushed Jack away. That's how I lost him. I'd hate for you to lose Paul like that.",
        "Rosanna: But if I tell Paul the truth now, I mean, he'll definitely leave me.",
        "Carly: Well, I guess all you can do then is hope that he doesn't find out. But I know you, I'm sure you were careful.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, oh, oh -- Paul?",
        "Paul: Hi. Listen, I've been thinking. I might have misjudged what happened in court today.",
        "Rosanna: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah. And I just think it's time that we're completely honest with each other. So why don't you come home, and we'll talk about it then? Millicent? Hi. I'm sorry -- listen -- last night, early evening, did Ms. Cabot have a guest?",
        "Maid: Yes. There was one. A gentleman I didn't recognize.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Paul sounded better on the phone. Maybe this will all work out after all.",
        "Carly: Well, you should go home and find out.",
        "Rosanna: You still think lying is a mistake? That the truth will come out eventually?",
        "Carly: Well, I think it usually does. But you know, I'm also thinking that even if Paul does learn the truth and forgives you completely, you may still have that problem.",
        "Rosanna: I know -- Meg. Well, that's a problem I'm just going to have to take care of. Right away.",
        "Carly: I'm sure you'll do the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So for all of you saying that you have faith in me, you still can't make up your mind.",
        "Meg: This hasn't been an easy day.",
        "Craig: Really? You're not the one who almost went to prison. So deal with it. Decide, right now. Are you my wife or not? Decide, meg. Now!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Montgomery.",
        "Rosanna: I need to see you, right away.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry, it's going to have to wait.",
        "Rosanna: It can't wait. There's some things that we need to straighten out, now.",
        "Craig: This really isn't a good time.",
        "Rosanna: Let me guess. You're with your darling Meg. Well, get rid of her, and meet me in ten minutes at Al's.",
        "Craig: That may not be --",
        "Rosanna: Be there, or I will come over and have a little chat with Meg myself.",
        "Craig: My lawyer. He needs to see me. We need to discuss strategy. And Rosanna, I'm still taking her to court to unfreeze my assets.",
        "Meg: Of course, money always comes first.",
        "Craig: You should wait for me upstairs. Think about what I said, Meg. I'm planning for my future -- and it's with you, or without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: What do think of the house? It's awesome.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Col. Mayer: It's -- a lot to take in.",
        "Noah: Do you want to come back inside?",
        "Col. Mayer: In a few minutes, yeah.",
        "Noah: Dad, if this is hard for you being around Luke and his family, we don't have to stay for dinner.",
        "Col. Mayer: I've accepted the invitation. And Colonel Winston Mayer never goes back on his word.",
        "Noah: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Col. Mayer: I'm sure. I'm sure. Go on back inside. Don't be rude to your friend. That's an order.",
        "Sly: Yoo-hoo.",
        "Col. Mayer: Who are you?",
        "Sly: Uh, nobody.",
        "Col. Mayer: You don't look like you belong here. Are you aware this is private property?",
        "Sly: We need to talk, colonel, about Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker, what are you doing here? School's not out yet.",
        "Parker: I had a study period. Did you call Aunt Rosanna?",
        "Carly: I did.",
        "Parker: And she'll give you all the money you need to get better, right?",
        "Carly: She would --",
        "Parker: Awesome! Now, we need to tell Jack and J.J. and Sage --",
        "Carly: Hey, hey -- slow down, all right? Sit down. Look, I read about that. We're not going to Berlin. The stuff that they're doing -- it's not going to work on my tumor.",
        "Parker: You don't know that.",
        "Carly: Yes, I do. We have to accept it. I am not getting better. And that's why instead of running off and looking for something that isn't there, we have to stay here, and we have to concentrate on making the most of the time that we have left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You did the right thing in court today.",
        "Rosanna: It was hardly the right thing, and you know it. I lied, and got you a get-out-of-jail-free card, because you managed to convince me that if you were out of the equation, Meg would go after Paul.",
        "Craig: Well, now that won't happen.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it better not. Otherwise, I'm going to throw you back in prison so fast, it'll make your head spin!",
        "Craig: Is that why you demanded this meeting, Rosanna? To threaten me?",
        "Rosanna: You know, we are not out of the woods yet where Meg and Paul are concerned. There's still something very powerful between them. And until it's dead and buried, neither of us are safe.",
        "Craig: So, what do you propose we do?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'd like to get Meg out of the equation. And I'd like you to do it for me.",
        "Craig: If you're suggesting that I kill my wife, that's not going to happen.",
        "Rosanna: What? You tried to kill me when we were married. It didn't seem to bother you then. But no, don't worry, I'm not considering attempted homicide. Your marriage to Meg. It's not in name only, I hope?",
        "Craig: What do you mean?",
        "Rosanna: Do I need to draw you a picture? I'm asking if you and your wife sleep together.",
        "Craig: Of course. But our sex life is none of your business.",
        "Rosanna: Actually, it is. Because if you would like to hold on to Meg, and I would like to stay with Paul, then you and Meg are going to have to have a child together. So get her pregnant, okay? The sooner, the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, what's taking you so long, Craig? I thought you'd be back by now. [Door closes] Hi.",
        "Craig: Thought about what I said?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Craig: Are you ready to be my wife?",
        "Meg: I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So the treatment in Berlin might work for another kind of tumor, but it won't work on mine.",
        "Parker: Maybe the doctors there could still help you. You never know unless you try.",
        "Carly: Parker, I want to be able to enjoy every good day that I have left with you and your brother and your sister.",
        "Parker: But you can't give up!",
        "Carly: Honey -- I know how hard this is for you to accept. It's hard for me, too. But you've got to help me out here. There's nothing we can do to make this better, except be here for each other. Can you do that?",
        "Parker: Of course I can, but --",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Parker: Nothing. I should get to school.",
        "Carly: Hey. Are you okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Mom, I know you're not going to believe me, but I've got this feeling inside. I got a really strong feeling that you're going to be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Can you believe how amazing this day has turned out?",
        "Luke: I still can't wrap my brain around it.",
        "Noah: You know, I don't even care, as long as I get to do this.",
        "Luke: Oh, hey, hey, hey! What if your dad comes back? I mean, I know he's making strides, but I think he'd be totally freaked if he saw us like this.",
        "Noah: He's on one of his power walks. He won't be back for a while. Come on, why are you so uptight?",
        "Luke: I'm not. I just get the feeling that your dad still doesn't like me very much, and I know that he doesn't like the whole idea of -- us.",
        "Noah: I know. But give him time. He can be a little intense. Once he makes up his mind to do something, there's no stopping him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Col. Mayer: I'm afraid you're mistaken. I don't know any Dusty Donovan.",
        "Sly: Well, this should jog your memory. He's the guy you shot and left for dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What -- we don't need that.",
        "Meg: Craig --",
        "Craig: No. I want to make a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Paul, are you here?",
        "Maid: Mr. Ryan went out, but he wanted me to give you this. He said you might want to see it again.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "[Rosanna opens up the box and in it is her cellphone with the video paused on the screen. She hits play]",
        "Paul: Meg you know who he is. And you know the things that he's done. Why can't you just walk away?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Holden: What's going on, here?",
        "Col. Mayer: Donovan. Is he still in that car?",
        "Sly: Where else would he be?",
        "Meg: He made a complete turn around. It's like he accepts the fact that Noah and Luke are now together.",
        "Luke: Your dad wants the three of us to go on a fishing trip together.",
        "Rosanna: You need to understand --",
        "Paul: The only thing I need to do is get the hell out of this house."
