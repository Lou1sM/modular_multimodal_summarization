        "Emily: I was beginning to think I'd never see you again.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry I didn't call.",
        "Emily: I know you were upset.",
        "Casey: Peace offering? I got you your favorite egg-white spinach omelet. Emily, I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: I am so glad you're not still mad at me.",
        "Casey: Hey, no way. Everybody comes up with crazy ideas to fix their life, you know? I had that get rich quick scheme.",
        "Emily: Your gambling?",
        "Casey: Yes, and I thought it was an easy way out. You probably thought the same way about your operation, and I'm just glad you heard me out and you didn't go through with it. 'Cause if you did, it would have been like you closing doors. Never having babies ever again? You'd feel as bad I did.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. I thought you understood.",
        "Casey: What? What?",
        "Emily: I heard you. But I went through with it anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, I know you're worried, Barbara. But if they won't let me in to see Paul, I doubt they're gonna let -- I don't know why. But he is still sedated, and they keep saying how he needs more observation. Look, I've been up all night thinking about him, how he's all alone in that room. How can I not be stressed out? My husband's locked up, and I don't know when or even if he's gonna get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Bad news. I just got off the phone with Mama. She's not gonna be able to make the benefit tonight.",
        "Lily: But she's the reason we're throwing it.",
        "Holden: Please. She feels guilty enough.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Holden: I think she's going to Iva's.",
        "Lily: Why? Is she sick?",
        "Holden: Seems Jason and Iva aren't doing so well these days.",
        "Lily: Why didn't anybody tell me? Does anybody stay together anymore?",
        "Holden: I'm hoping we will.",
        "Lily: Me, too.",
        "Holden: Anyway, she wants us to host the benefit. Are you okay with that?",
        "Lily: Yeah, of course.",
        "Holden: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: Why wouldn't I be? Oh. Because it's at Metro.",
        "Holden: Yeah, when we ran into Carly, you weren't so happy.",
        "Lily: Holden, I promise I won't make a scene. If Carly shows up, I can handle it. Can you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, ho, ho, ho. Don't push yourself there, Buddy.",
        "Jack: I'm a little lagged. Other than that, I'm fine, Janet, really.",
        "Janet: Honey, just a little while ago, you were dead in the water -- literally. You can't be that fine that fast. Here. You need to stay hydrated.",
        "Jack: I lost blood, not water.",
        "Janet: I don't care. Just drink. You feel okay. You still need to relax.",
        "Jack: No, I don't need to relax. I'm not tired.",
        "Janet: Well, I don't care, 'cause you know what? I'm gonna get my little butt upstairs, I'm gonna run you a bath, and I am going to pull the sheets on your bed. And you are gonna stay here, and you're not gonna move!",
        "Jack: Okay, hold on a second. Hold on a second. I am very glad you showed up, even though it didn't seem like it.",
        "Janet: It's okay. I understand. In fact, this probably needs to be changed, so I'm gonna go upstairs and look for some gauze, also, okay? Okay. Easy, easy.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Janet: Zip it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: Come on in.",
        "Carly: I heard you were coming back today. I've been very worried.",
        "Jack: Not that worried, or you wouldn't have left me back on the island.",
        "Carly: I had to.",
        "Jack: You got pretty intense there, all that talk about how it could never work for us again.",
        "Carly: It can't.",
        "Jack: No. That's why you sent Janet in to pinch-hit?",
        "Carly: I didn't want you to be alone, Jack.",
        "Jack: Alone? Or alone with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: How is it that I can leave for just a few days and come back and find James Stenbeck dead again and not one statement to tell me how it happened?",
        "Dallas: You know, I don't really know much myself.",
        "Margo: Well, obviously, Paul Ryan had something to do with it.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, he was trying to rescue his wife.",
        "Margo: Yes, but now that he's in the psych ward, we can't get anything more from him.",
        "Dallas: Well, you could talk to Jack. He was there doing P.I. work for Ryan, trying to find his wife.",
        "Margo: Is Jack the one who rescued Meg?",
        "Dallas: I haven't gotten a chance to ask him yet.",
        "Margo: Why not?",
        "Dallas: Well, Jack actually had a close call himself. See, one of Stenbeck's goons tried to drown him. But from what I hear, he's okay.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, you know what? Just get him on the phone now. Now, okay?",
        "Dallas: Okay. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I really just came by to make sure you were all right. And I see that you are.",
        "Jack: What are you doing, Carly?",
        "Carly: I'm trying to be your friend, Jack.",
        "Jack: Is that what you were on the island? My friend?",
        "Carly: I should go.",
        "Jack: You didn't answer my question.",
        "Carly: I never stopped caring about you, Jack. That's the reason I'm here.",
        "Jack: And the reason you left?",
        "Carly: I saw where we were headed, and I had to do something to stop it.",
        "Jack: There was a time you wanted where we were headed.",
        "Carly: I never said I didn't. But it scares me. I don't want to fall back into the same routine, Jack. It scares me too much.",
        "Jack: I guess I miss you. That's all.",
        "Carly: I miss you, too, Jack. That doesn't mean we should jump into something we know won't last.",
        "Jack: Wow. I can't believe you're telling me this.",
        "Carly: Hey, you're the one who said that you wanted peace. I just don't think I can offer you that. Maybe Janet can.",
        "Jack: Okay, why are you pushing her?",
        "Carly: I want you to be happy.",
        "Jack: You don't even know her that well.",
        "Carly: Oh, I know enough. You should give it a chance, Jack.",
        "Jack: Okay. Yeah, she was pretty remarkable in the hospital. She made friends with all the nurses, made sure I didn't have to eat anything completely grotesque. Right now, she's drawing me a bath and turning down sheets.",
        "Carly: Hmm. Well, don't take that for granted, okay? You should maybe court her a little bit.",
        "Jack: \"Court her\"?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you mean like flowers and candy and that kind of stuff?",
        "Carly: Sure. Maybe even a dinner at someplace other than Al's, Jack. That wouldn't hurt, would it?",
        "Janet: Hey. Hi, Carly. I hope I didn't wait too long to fix that bandage.",
        "Jack: No. Carly was just giving me tips on healing.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, could you help me out? 'Cause I need all the help I can get.",
        "Carly: Jack'll do the honors. Take care of yourself. Try to enjoy your recovery.",
        "Jack: Thank you. What?",
        "Janet: Is there something going you should tell me about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Maybe I should go talk to her. You know, let her know that I'm not gonna go crazy if I come within ten feet of her. Just sit down with her and acknowledge that this is a difficult situation, but we have to figure out a way to get through it.",
        "Holden: You know what? Why don't we just -- let's just leave it alone for now. I need to go see Meg. I want to see her before the benefit. You want to come with me?",
        "Lily: I've got a million things to do before tonight. But please give her a hug for me.",
        "Holden: She's going to need it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, poor thing. It has just been one nightmare after another since she married Paul. Thank God she loves him so much.",
        "Holden: Maybe too much for her own good. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There is. There is something I want to tell you.",
        "Janet: Here we go.",
        "Jack: Yeah. No, no, have a seat.",
        "Janet: Oh, great. I knew it was a bad sign when I saw Carly here.",
        "Jack: No, Carly was here because wanted --",
        "Janet: Because she -- she changed her mind. That's okay. I get it. You guys have history.",
        "Jack: No, that's not it.",
        "Janet: You have chemistry together. And it's okay.",
        "Jack: Janet, no, that's not it at all. Would you shut your mouth please and let me finish?",
        "Janet: Damn! Go ahead.",
        "Jack: There's a benefit at Metro tomorrow night.",
        "Janet: Yeah, and you're taking Carly.",
        "Jack: No --",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: This has nothing to do with Carly.",
        "Janet: It doesn't?",
        "Jack: No. I wanted to ask if maybe you'd like to go.",
        "Janet: Why, are you selling tickets? Because, you know, I already bought one. I figured it was the least I could do for Aunt Emma. I mean, she put me up here, and it was charity and everything.",
        "Jack: That's really nice of you, but no, that's not what I wanted to know. What I wanted to know --",
        "Janet: Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Hold on! Why aren't you taking Carly?",
        "Jack: Because I was hoping to take you.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Janet: Really? Like on a date?",
        "Jack: Exactly like a date.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Jack: I guess I can take that as a yes.",
        "Janet: Yes!",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: You scared me.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Oh!",
        "Janet: Oh, sorry! I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Wow, that was like pulling teeth. Snyder.",
        "Margo: You got any free time this morning?",
        "Jack: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Margo: No. I just want you to come on down to the station to discuss a few things.",
        "Jack: What things?",
        "Margo: I'll tell you when you get here.",
        "Jack: Give me 15 minutes.",
        "Margo: See you then.",
        "Jack: That was Margo. She wants to see me.",
        "Janet: Maybe she wants to give you your job back.",
        "Jack: No, I doubt it. That's not going to happen.",
        "Janet: Well, you can't drive yourself.",
        "Jack: No, I can handle it.",
        "Janet: No, that's why I'm here, so you don't have to.",
        "Jack: Listen, if I have any problems, I'll call you. Okay?",
        "Janet: All right.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Janet: I have a date! Yes! Whoo! I got nothing to wear. Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You really did it. You fixed it so you can never get pregnant again.",
        "Emily: I thought you knew. I thought when you came in here you understood, that's whey you brought me the flowers.",
        "Casey: You knew how I felt, how I was against it.",
        "Emily: I know.",
        "Casey: And you still did it!",
        "Emily: How can you not understand, Casey, that if it's my body, it's my decision.",
        "Casey: Yes, and I have no say in it at all.",
        "Emily: You don't understand. This is better for the both of us. I don't want to have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy, and neither do you.",
        "Casey: I wanted to have kids with you. And you knew that. So don't act like you're doing me a favor here.",
        "Emily: I didn't have my tubes tied for the sole purpose of hurting you, okay?",
        "Casey: You didn't even think about me.",
        "Emily: That's not true.",
        "Casey: Oh, the hell it is. You might think you did the right thing for you, but do you know what it feels like for me? Like a smack in the face. I don't think I can ever forgive you for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Carly: Is everything all right with Jack?",
        "Janet: Oh, he's fine. He's fine. He's actually at the police station. Margo called and wanted to talk to him. Of course, I offered to drive him, but --",
        "Carly: No, I'm sure he insisted on driving himself.",
        "Janet: Exactly.",
        "Carly: Well, if you're looking for Liberty, you know, Parker already left for school.",
        "Janet: I'm actually looking for you.",
        "Carly: Okey-doke. What's up?",
        "Janet: I wanted to know what you and Jack were talking about earlier.",
        "Carly: Why? Did something happen?",
        "Janet: Yes, as a matter of fact, you know the benefit for the project at Emma's farm? He asked me to go with him as his date.",
        "Carly: Hmm! That's great.",
        "Janet: Yeah, I thought so, until I starting thinking about it, and I just wanted to it, and I just wanted to know -- did you tell him to ask me?",
        "Carly: No. Not in so many words. I may have made a casual suggestion that Jack picked up on. But believe me, Jack Snyder does not do anything Jack Snyder does not want to do.",
        "Janet: Wow, you are pushing this like there's no tomorrow.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Janet: You have given me two -- two openings with a guy that I know is the love of your life. And so if this is just a setup to find out if he's more interested in you than he is me, then please don't even bother. You could pretty much snap your fingers and have him back any time you want.",
        "Carly: But I don't want him back.",
        "Janet: Are you sure about that?",
        "Carly: I'm positive. I would like for him to be happy.",
        "Janet: Really?",
        "Carly: Really. And it may have taken me a very long time to get here, but I do finally see that he would never be happy if he were with me.",
        "Janet: So there's nothing for me to worry about?",
        "Carly: Nothing.",
        "Janet: Well, actually, there is.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Janet: I got nothing to wear. And I was wondering if you know of a place where I could find a dress that doesn't cost a lot of money. You know, it's --",
        "Carly: Yes. You know, I know exactly the place. And we don't even have to leave my house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I expected to find you in bed, not surfing the web.",
        "Meg: I'm trying to find out what's wrong with Paul.",
        "Holden: What do the doctors say?",
        "Meg: They're not sure yet.",
        "Holden: You know what? You need to walk away from the computer. You need to take it easy.",
        "Meg: Sitting at a computer isn't exactly hard labor.",
        "Holden: What you're doing is stressful, and that's what you need to avoid.",
        "Meg: Okay, tell me how I should do that, then, when my husband is in a psych ward and they won't let me see him. I just hope he knows that it's not my choice to stay away.",
        "Holden: You know, I can't help but wonder that maybe a little time apart wouldn't be such a bad thing. I mean, you can look at your life, your marriage.",
        "Meg: What are you saying?",
        "Holden: What I'm saying is ever since you said \"I do,\" your life has been total chaos. I know that you love Paul. I know that he loves you in his own way. But there comes a point in your life. You have a baby coming. You don't need to take on someone else's problems, especially problems as big as Paul's.",
        "Meg: Is that why you came here, to talk me into leaving my husband?",
        "Holden: I think if you were really honest with yourself, you would see that the best thing for you and the baby right now would be to get Paul out of your lives for good.",
        "Meg: My husband is too ill to defend himself, and you're telling me to abandon him?",
        "Holden: Fine, you can be angry with me if you want. I'm just worried about you. That's all.",
        "Meg: You think Paul has done nothing but hurt me.",
        "Holden: I don't just think it. I see it. You're pregnant. You're supposed to have that beautiful, serene glow. You look like you've been through a war.",
        "Meg: Well, that's not Paul's fault! That's James Stenbeck's! That's where all the problems started.",
        "Holden: James is dead.",
        "Meg: And Paul needs some time to recover from all the damage he's inflicted. And he will. Once he gets the love and support he needs, you and everybody else will find out exactly what I already know -- that he is nothing like his father. He is a decent and loving man.",
        "Holden: Okay, I can understand why you might want to believe that. But some problems, they don't respond to love and support. Some problems, they last a lifetime, and you don't need to take them on right now.",
        "Meg: You know what? You sound just like Dusty.",
        "Holden: He would know. Wouldn't he? Look what Paul did to him. To Jennifer. That wasn't James Stenbeck. That was Paul. He did that all by himself. Why don't you just come out to the farm? You know what? Better yet, come stay with us. Lily would love it. So would the girls.",
        "Meg: No. I love my husband. He and this baby are my family. They mean everything to me. And no matter what you or Dusty or anyone else says, I will not walk away from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Stop. Would you stop? I don't know why you're so upset. I thought I told you a long time ago that I didn't want to have anymore children. God, I don't know what to say to you. I'm sorry you're hurt.",
        "Casey: Not sorry that you went through with it, though.",
        "Emily: No, I'm not.",
        "Casey: Which proves again you don't give a damn about me.",
        "Emily: That's not true, Casey.",
        "Casey: Emily, not too long ago, we almost died. I knew then that I want to be with you. That I wanted us to be forever. But you know what? I guess it was all just fun and games for you. You know, I'm just a -- I was a boy toy. Well, you know what? Forget it. I'm not playing anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What do you think? And be honest, because if you don't like it, you won't be hurting my feelings. You really won't.",
        "Janet: It's perfect.",
        "Carly: Is it?",
        "Janet: It's amazing. I don't know how to thank you.",
        "Carly: Well, try it on first, then thank me.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh! This is -- I've never worn a designer original before. Wow.",
        "Carly: Don't get crazy, Janet. It's just a dress.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? I can't even sew on a button. Are you sure? I mean, its okay for me to wear this?",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Lily: I need to talk to you.",
        "Carly: Well, I certainly hope it's not about Holden. Because, really, I haven't laid eyes on him since the last time you ripped my head off.",
        "Janet: This is so amazing. When Jack gets a look at me in this dress, I don't think we're gonna make it to --",
        "[Lily chuckles]",
        "Lily: Aren't you two the cozy pair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: The whole thing was pretty intense. You had to be there to believe it.",
        "Margo: So in the process of tracking down Stenbeck and saving Meg, you found yourself on a completely different island with no backup.",
        "Jack: It's not like I could call in a S.W.A.T. team, Margo. I'm not on the force.",
        "Margo: Jack, you're lucky you're on the planet.",
        "Jack: Thanks to Carly.",
        "Margo: Carly? What's she got to do with this?",
        "Jack: Well, she knew that I thought this lead was bogus, and because she thought it was a trap, she followed me out there. Thank God she did, because if she hadn't pulled me out of that water, I wouldn't be standing here right now.",
        "Margo: Well, it's nice to hear you say that Carly did something right for a change.",
        "Jack: She did a lot right.",
        "Margo: Ah. You know, being saved by your ex is an excellent way of finding you way back to each other.",
        "Jack: No, no. No, there's no way back for Carly and me. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I'm gonna get out of this dress before I pop a seam.",
        "[Lily chuckles]",
        "Lily: You're a regular angel these days, aren't you?",
        "Carly: She needed a dress.",
        "Lily: Reminds me of that time at Fashions when you helped me pick out lingerie. Little did I know you were also helping yourself to my husband, too.",
        "Carly: My God, how many times are we going to do this?",
        "Lily: You think if you let Jack's little girlfriend, it'll convince the world you're not a home-wrecker? Ooh, you're maybe trying to trick her into looking the other way while you move back in on Jack?",
        "Carly: You know something, Lily? I don't owe you any explanations or any more apologies. So if you came here looking for a fight, I'll be happy to give you one. Go ahead, come on, and get it out of your system. You couldn't possibly humiliate me any more than you did yesterday. What, shall I call the neighbors? Maybe they want to come over and hear what a slut I am.",

        "Carly: Then what do you want?",
        "Lily: I actually came here to apologize for what I did yesterday at Metro.",
        "Carly: Wow. Well, I have yet to see anything apologetic about this visit.",
        "Lily: I-I'm trying, okay? It's hard -- seeing you, remembering what you did. It's gonna take some time.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Lily: And what makes it worse is that we used to be such good friends, or at least I thought we were.",
        "Carly: We were.",
        "Lily: Then why did you sleep with my husband?",
        "Carly: It was a terrible mistake that I wish that I could undo, but I can't. So, I hope that we can at least be civil to each other. I know I will do my part, okay? I will stay as far away from Holden as I possibly can.",
        "Lily: I'd appreciate that.",
        "Carly: Okay. Is there something else?",
        "Lily: Answer one question.",
        "Carly: Here it comes.",
        "Lily: What are you really doing with Janet? I'm not trying to stir things up. I'm just curious. Is this some way to do penance, encouraging the competition to move in on your territory?",
        "Carly: No. Jack is not my territory.",
        "Lily: Come on.",
        "Carly: All right, I admit that when he first started seeing Janet, my first impulse was to stake my claim. But then I saw how happy he was. And after everything I've put him through, how could I interfere with that?",
        "Lily: I'm glad that you're okay with Jack and Janet.",
        "Carly: I am.",
        "Lily: I should go.",
        "Carly: I hate what I did. And not just because it hurt your marriage, but because it cost me my best friend. I have a lot of regrets, Lily. That's one of my biggest.",

        "Margo: Nothing more you can tell me?",
        "Jack: What? What, you think just 'cause I'm not on the force anymore, I'm holding out on you?",
        "Margo: No, I'm thinking 'cause you were working for Paul Ryan --",
        "Jack: That all of a sudden I'm a liar?",
        "Margo: Jack, this is just so frustrating. Something about Meg's statement does not add up to the evidence. I mean, there's a big chunk missing. Don't you think?",
        "Jack: Are you asking me this as Meg's cousin or as an ex-cop? 'Cause I got to tell you, as Meg's cousin, I haven't even seen her since I've been back, and I doubt she'd want to rehash the whole thing with me.",
        "Margo: Well, I think if you were still a cop, she would talk to you and she would definitely open up to you if you were a family member.",
        "Jack: Yeah. But I don't work here anymore. I wish I could help.",
        "Margo: Me too.",

        "Casey: You really don't get it, do you?",
        "Emily: No, I don't. I don't get it, Case. Nothing's changed between us.",
        "Casey: How can you say that?",
        "Emily: The only thing that's gonna keep us from being together is you. And you know what? The more I think about it, the more I think we're really gonna enjoy knowing there's no surprises to worry about.",
        "Casey: Please speak for yourself.",
        "Emily: Did you really think we were gonna end up having babies together?",
        "Casey: What is so wrong with that?",
        "Emily: It's just naive.",
        "Casey: To want to have a child with the woman I love?",
        "Emily: You're practically a child yourself.",
        "Casey: I am not a child!",

        "Margo: You thought I was Paul?",
        "Meg: I must have been dreaming.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I heard that he was at the hospital.",
        "Meg: Yes. Do you think you could use your badge to get someone to tell me when he's getting out?",
        "Margo: I already tried that. I know how difficult this must be, not having him around with a baby on the way.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it is.",
        "Margo: Well, then, you know, I'll make this as quick as I can. I just want to ask you a few questions about Faro Island -- what led up to that.",
        "Meg: I already gave my statement.",
        "Margo: I know, I know, but I wasn't around, so if you wouldn't mind answering a few more questions?",
        "Meg: Not at all. But I honestly don't know that much.",
        "Margo: Why don't we just -- let's start with James Stenbeck -- his kidnapping you.",
        "Meg: He had threatened Paul's life if I didn't go with him.",
        "Margo: Is this the first contact you'd had with him?",
        "Meg: Yes. But apparently, he was hiding in the wine cellar for weeks.",
        "Margo: Really? Was Paul aware that James was in the house?",
        "Meg: Yes, he was, but James threatened my life if he told anyone, especially the police.",
        "Margo: All right. So, James took you to Faro Island, and where did he hide you?",
        "Meg: He had a cottage on the beach. It was a pretty remote place, no one else around.",
        "Margo: And then how did you get to the lighthouse? Who got you there?",
        "Meg: I just got away on my own.",
        "Margo: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah. What?",
        "Margo: Well, it's just, you know, kind of surprising -- a woman in your condition on a deserted beach covering all that territory.",
        "Meg: If you were being held by a psychopath, I'm sure you would discover resources that you didn't know you had.",
        "Margo: Okay. So, Paul then found you at the lighthouse?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Margo: And then what?",
        "Meg: And then James found us.",
        "Margo: And according to the report, James was armed.",
        "Meg: Yes, he was. And Paul tried to get the gun away from him. There was a struggle, and that's when James fell off the ledge.",
        "Margo: That's all?",
        "Meg: That's all I remember.",
        "Margo: Are you sure?",
        "Meg: Is there something else you want me to say?",
        "Margo: Yes, Meg, there is. Someone was shot at the lighthouse, and I want to know who it was.",
        "Meg: Someone was shot? Are you sure?",
        "Margo: The gun retrieved from the site had been fired. There were casings on the floor.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe when James and Paul were struggling, the gun went off and I didn't hear it.",
        "Margo: It's a pretty distinctive sound. I can't imagine you could've missed it.",
        "Meg: You know what, Margo? You weren't there. Everything felt pretty surreal.",
        "Margo: Meg, you had to have known that someone was shot. According to the crime scene report, there was blood on the floor.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe James was hit and we didn't register it because soon after, he fell off the ledge.",
        "Margo: We ran tests. The blood that was found on the floor was not James Stenbeck's. And since neither you nor Paul had any visible wounds, I have to conclude that someone else was there.",
        "Meg: Well, that's impossible.",
        "Margo: Is it?",
        "Meg: It was a small space, Margo. I think if somebody were shot, I would've noticed. You know what? I was trying to sleep off a migraine that is now back, so if you don't mind, I'd like to try and sleep it off again, so if we're done, you know your way out.",
        "Margo: Yes, I do, but I'm not going.",
        "Meg: I've told you everything I remember.",
        "Margo: I don't think you have, Meg. You're hiding something, and I want to know what it is.",

        "Carly: I don't expect a miracle, Lily. But sometimes, I think that one day we can get past this -- that you can forgive me.",
        "Lily: I really just came to apologize. I got a lot to do before the benefit.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Lily: Listen, I know that Emma really appreciates you hosting it at Metro.",
        "Carly: It's my pleasure. It really is. I look forward to hearing how it went.",

        "Lily: I know that I said keep your distance from Holden, but --",
        "Carly: No, Holden is not the problem. It's your mother. Lucinda made it perfectly clear that I am not welcome.",
        "Lily: But, Carly, it's your club.",
        "Carly: And Worldwide is one of the benefit sponsors.",
        "Lily: Well, so is Luke's foundation, and I'm sure if he knew that I was okay with you being there, he would be, too. Please.",
        "Carly: I'll think about it. And thanks for coming by.",
        "Lily: Bye, Carly.",
        "Janet: Is it safe to come out now?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I was wondering what was taking you so long to get out of that dress.",
        "Janet: Well, I didn't want to interrupt. Things were getting pretty intense.",
        "Carly: Yeah. \"Intense\" is a pretty good word for it.",
        "Janet: Well, I don't know. I mean, by the time she left -- you think you two could be friends again?",
        "Carly: Well, if Lily and I are ever to be friends again, and that's a very big \"If,\" it's gonna take a lot of work. This dress, on the other hand, won't take much work at all. If you have the time, I can put the final touches on it right now and you can take it with you.",
        "Janet: Actually, I don't. I'm running late as it is. I got to go.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I'll work on it quickly, and you'll have it in time for the benefit, then.",
        "Janet: That would be great.",

        "Jack: Right over there.",
        "Holden: Got 'em.",
        "Jack: You should've told me. I would've brought them over to you.",
        "Holden: Nah, you don't look like you're in any shape to leave the house.",
        "Jack: I'm a little weary, but that's what happens when your ex-boss drags you in for grilling.",

        "Holden: What does she think happened?",

        "Holden: Right. Well, see you around.",
        "Jack: Well, wait a second. You -- you were there when it was all over, right? Any theories on what happened?",
        "Holden: No, not really. Stenbeck was already dead, and Meg and Paul -- they didn't really want to discuss details.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but other than the three of you, there was no one else there? Just -- just cops?",
        "Holden: Well, I was kind of focused on Meg. Why?",
        "Jack: No, Margo -- Margo thinks that the evidence suggests there was another person there.",

        "Margo: It wouldn't be the first time. Did you think I forgot about Sofie? Both you and Paul lied to me to protect each other, so, tell me, who are you protecting now?",
        "Meg: I told you everything I know.",
        "Margo: I don't believe you. And if Paul's diagnosis supposedly keeps him --",
        "Meg: Okay, how dare you? Paul's suffering is real -- to both of us.",
        "Margo: But if you can exaggerate his condition, it would keep him from talking to the police.",

        "Casey: What? What, is your just-past-jailbait boyfriend embarrassing you?",
        "Emily: Stop it.",

        "Holden: So you don't regret going.",
        "Lily: We won't be having lunch in Old Town any time soon. But no, I don't regret it. She misses our friendship.",
        "Holden: Well, that's not surprising.",
        "Lily: I am trying, Holden. I'm nowhere near over what happened, but if I see Carly at the benefit, I promise I'll smile and be polite.",
        "Holden: You better dance with your husband.",

        "Holden: You'd better.",
