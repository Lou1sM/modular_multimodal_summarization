        "Lily: Damian?",
        "Damian: Lily. What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: I have no idea. Jack called me and told me he had some information about Holden. What about you?",
        "Damian: The same. I got a message to come to the police station right away.",
        "Lily: About Holden?",
        "Damian: They didn't say.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Lily: Jack, what's going on?",
        "Jack: Have a seat, both of you.",
        "Damian: All this secrecy's making Lily very nervous.",
        "Jack: No secrecy at all, Damian.",
        "Lily: Is there bad news?",
        "Jack: It's about the investigation into Holden's disappearance.",
        "Damian: That's what you're calling it now? A disappearance.",
        "Lily: Damian, please. Let Jack explain.",
        "Jack: I got the report back from our handwriting expert. And it turns out -- the writing on the note to the bank could very well be Holden's.",
        "Lily: I thought your expert said the results were negative?",
        "Jack: That's what he wanted you to think, Lily.",
        "Damian: Am I being accused of something here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, is there news?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yes. And for a change it's good news. I have a source -- the police department --",
        "Meg: A source?",
        "Lucinda: Okay, whatever you want to call it, I've got it. And the documentation that you provided in Damian's room is going to come in very useful.",
        "Meg: Okay, Lucinda, I've been up all night with a teething baby. Could you please just cut to the chase?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, sorry. Jack has summoned Damian to the police station. I think at the very least, he will be charged with obstruction of justice.",
        "Meg: Jack's really going to arrest him?",
        "Lucinda: I certainly hope so. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: No. Way too blond.",
        "Mason: Come on, hair color can be changed. Look at those features.",
        "Noah: Yeah he's perfect -- and boring.",
        "Mason: Yeah, you're right. You, Mister, have got to have a more interesting face if you're going to carry a film.",
        "Noah: Next. Wait, wait, wait. He's cute, don't you think?",
        "Mason: Not as cute as you.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: Oh, Eb, be careful!",
        "Eb: Shut up, Maeve.",
        "Holden: What is this place?",
        "Eb: It's your new home.",
        "Maeve: It stinks.",
        "Eb: Perfect for a little rat like you.",
        "Holden: Just leave her alone, Eb.",
        "Eb: You're in no position to give me any orders.",
        "Holden: Why don't you tell us what's going on. You went to get the ransom money. What happened?",
        "Eb: Things didn't work out the way I planned.",
        "Maeve: They never do with you.",
        "Holden: Last time we saw you, you were dragging an unconscious cop to your truck. You've obviously been in an accident. I'd say you're in trouble, Eb.",
        "Eb: I'll handle it.",
        "Maeve: Where's Grady?",
        "Eb: He stuck his nose in where it didn't belong.",
        "Maeve: God, Eb. You know what they do to cop killers!",
        "Eb: You don't care what happens to me.",
        "Holden: Your back's against the wall, Eb. There's only one way out of this.",
        "Eb: Oh, yeah? What's that?",
        "Holden: Turn yourself in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not accusing you of anything, Damian.",
        "Damian: Should I call my lawyer?",
        "Jack: Is there a reason you need to?",
        "Lily: What's going on? Why are the two of you at each other's throats?",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to figure out why Damian said it was taking forever to get the written report on the handwriting samples, when I managed to do it in a matter of 72 hours.",
        "Lily: Well I'm sure that police work takes priority.",
        "Jack: It would, assuming that he actually sent the samples. But he was still holding onto them.",
        "Damian: These documents were stolen from my hotel room. Where'd you get them?",
        "Jack: They came to me through a concerned citizen.",
        "Damian: Someone with a vendetta against me, no doubt.",
        "Jack: That would leave the field wide open now wouldn't it?",
        "Damian: That's stolen property. You can't use it against me.",
        "Jack: I'm just asking you a few questions, Damian. That's all. Unless you have some objections.",
        "Damian: I have nothing to hide.",
        "Jack: Except these documents, apparently.",
        "Damian: I had copies made and held onto the originals for safekeeping. I didn't want any harm to come to them. Lily was very upset when we discovered they were missing.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I got another theory. I think maybe you were holding onto these documents because you didn't want Lily to know that Holden could actually be alive.",
        "Lily: Holden's alive? Jack, I need you to repeat what you just said. Do you really have a reason to think Holden could be alive?",
        "Jack: Lily, it's a possibility.",
        "Damian: Anything is possible. But unless you have more than a theory, it's beyond cruel to put Lily through this again.",
        "Jack: Excuse me. Our handwriting expert tested both samples, okay -- Damian, that's confidential.",
        "Damian: Yeah, I can see why.",
        "Lily: Well what does it say?",
        "Damian: Nothing. According to Jack's experts, the results are inconclusive.",
        "Lily: So it doesn't confirm anything? Jack, why would you bring me all the way down here just to tell me that?",
        "Damian: Tell her, Detective Snyder. This isn't about her at all. Is it? It's about me.",
        "Jack: Lily, I'm looking for the truth.",
        "Damian: No. You're looking to railroad me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What did your source say, exactly? I mean is Jack going to throw the book at him?",
        "Lucinda: Ah, would you like some? No -- uh, it's going to be a little difficult to do that, considering the manner in which the evidence was collected.",
        "Meg: You mean, because I stole it?",
        "Lucinda: But never mind. That is not breaking and entering. Not when the gentleman gives you key to his room.",
        "Meg: Which I still have.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you do realize he's not coming back to you, don't you. He's moved on.",
        "Meg: Once Lily finds out what Damian has done --",
        "Lucinda: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I'm not talking about Lily. When Damian knows that you stole the documents, he's gonna hate you.",
        "Meg: I don't care. He used me to get to Lily. I'll be damned if I'm going to let him get away with it.",
        "Lucinda: That'a girl. Stick to your guns.",
        "Meg: Don't worry, there's nothing he could do to change my mind. I wouldn't take him back if he came crawling on his knees.",
        "Lucinda: Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: Lighten up. We're talking about the movie.",
        "Noah: We were, until you said --",
        "Mason: I said you're cute. Noah, you are cute. You got a way of making people like you without trying. And this character you've written is your alter ego. We have to like this character enough to watch him for eighty minutes. You cast the wrong guy, and it doesn't matter how amazing your script is, or how wonderful your visuals, your film's gonna be an automatic bomb.",
        "Noah: No pressure.",
        "Mason: It's reality. This isn't a casual decision. And I think you can do better than the guys we've been looking at, that's all.",
        "Noah: No, I get that. It's just when you talk about me instead of the character --",
        "Mason: Oh come on. All I was saying was that the actor has to have the same kind of charisma that you do, that's all. Come one, let's get back at it.",
        "Noah: Mason. I'm not comfortable with --",
        "Mason: I'm sorry. You want to talk about it?",
        "Noah: Not really, but --",
        "Mason: But I guess you've noticed that I am attracted to you.",
        "Noah: You --",
        "Mason: Oh come on, don't please.",
        "Noah: Look, Professor Jarvis --",
        "Mason: Whoa, all of a sudden it's Professor?",
        "Noah: You know, I forgot. I'm meeting Luke, and I'm really late. So, I'm gonna go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: They're going to hunt you down, Eb. If Grady's dead, they'll shoot to kill.",
        "Eb: Not if I get a head start.",
        "Holden: Turn yourself in, I'll help you.",
        "Eb: Why would you do that?",
        "Holden: For Maeve. Look, I'll find you a lawyer. Maybe we can work out a plea bargain for ya.",
        "Maeve: Listen to him. Listen to him. Maybe we can get out of this, we can go back to the way things were.",
        "Eb: No, no. That's over. You killed it when you took up with this one.",
        "Maeve: Holden never touched me.",
        "Eb: In your mind, he did. No, I can't go back now. The only thing for me to do is get my hands on some money real quick, and get the hell away from here.",
        "Maeve: But what about us?",
        "Eb: You're not my problem any more, Buttercup.",
        "Maeve: No, Eb! No please! No, don't leave us here!",
        "Holden: Eb. Eb, don't do this Eb, Eb!",
        "Maeve: No!",
        "Holden: You can't do this to us.",
        "Maeve: Please!",
        "Holden: Eb! Come back!",
        "Maeve: Please don't leave us down here!",
        "Holden: Eb come back! Eb! Eb come back!",
        "Maeve: Please!",
        "Holden: Don't do this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Inconclusive means they don't know. So why are you acting as if Holden is alive.",
        "Lily: He could be.",
        "Damian: No, Lily. It's probably just an excellent forgery, that's all.",
        "Lily: But the expert could see that, right? That would be conclusive.",
        "Damian: Handwriting analysis isn't an exact science. But since the two reports are in agreement --",
        "Jack: Where is this second report, huh? I'd like to see it.",
        "Lily: Forget about the report, Jack. Do you really think that Holden could be alive?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Lily: What does your gut tell you?",
        "Damian: Forget about that, Lily. Let's look at the evidence. Has anyone seen Holden since the accident? You were there, Jack, you were at the scene. Do you really believe somebody could walk away from that crash alive? And if by some miracle, he did, who's lying in the cemetery? Is there any reason to believe it's not Holden?",
        "Jack: No. Nothing definitive.",
        "Lily: In other words, this was just a fishing expedition. You don't approve of my connection with Damian, so you're doing anything you can to destroy it.",
        "Jack: No, I want justice for my cousin.",
        "Lily: There's no justice to be had, Jack. There was a terrible accident, and he died. It was nobody's fault. And now you're trying to accuse me of betraying my husband, because I didn't bury myself with him?",
        "Jack: Of course that's not what I'm trying to do.",
        "Lily: Well what is it that you're after? What display of grief would be acceptable to the Snyder family? Should I -- should I join a convent? Should I just wear black?",
        "Damian: Nothing you do will ever be good enough, Lily.",
        "Lily: And this game of Holden's alive -- no, sorry, he's not -- it's gotta stop.",
        "Jack: Believe me, it's hard on every one of us who misses him.",
        "Lily: I know. But it's killing me.",
        "Jack: Lily, I'm not trying to hurt you.",
        "Lily: I know you're not Jack, but you are, and you've got to stop. I can't afford to fall apart. My children need me. I am all that they have left.",
        "Jack: That's not true at all. They're not alone. You're not alone.",
        "Lily: I might as well be. Because my family is only there for me if I do what they think is right. And right now, nobody approves of the way I'm living my life.",
        "Jack: We're protective. Holden would want that.",
        "Lily: Holden is gone, Jack. And none of you know what it's like to walk in my shoes. I think that I see him sometimes. I still think that I hear him.",
        "Jack: I -- I know.",
        "Lily: Which is why you can't be there for me, Jack. Because you're going through the same thing. And Damian isn't crazy with grief. You know, it infuriates the way you are trying to railroad him when the only thing he's doing is being my friend.",
        "Jack: I think he wants more than that.",
        "Damian: What Lily and I want is no one's business but ours, Jack.",
        "Lily: Just because I'm a widow doesn't mean I can't make my own decisions. And, for the record, Damian is not putting pressure on me.",
        "Jack: I find that hard to believe.",
        "Lily: Damn it, Jack, will you stop treating me like a child!",
        "Jack: My friends are my business.",
        "Lily: Who are you to judge me?",
        "Damian: You know I wonder what the police commissioner would say about you dragging us in here to satisfy a personal grudge.",
        "Jack: I brought you in here to answer questions about handwriting analysis, Damian.",
        "Damian: And I have. Now may I go?",
        "Jack: You've been free to go this entire time.",
        "Damian: Lily?",
        "Lily: He's right. This was never about Holden. You're trying to punish Damian, and you're using the family to get away with it.",
        "Jack: That's not true at all.",
        "Lily: Then why won't you let it go?",
        "Jack: Because Damian is lying to us both, and I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: It's so obvious that you're still carrying a torch for that guy. My dear, you would do well to get over it.",
        "Meg: You don't care how I feel. As long as you get Damian away from Lily, I could throw myself screaming off a cliff and you wouldn't bat an eyelash.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling I wouldn't waste that fine operatic moment. I'd hang on to that. Save that, use that for somebody more deserving.",
        "Meg: But you wouldn't stop me.",
        "Lucinda: I think I would just throw Damian off the cliff after you.",
        "Meg: You know, you're no better than he is. You're both using me to get the same thing. What's good for Lily? What will make Lily happy? How could we save her, how could we get her through this, how could we protect Lily from herself. You know it's really sickening. Why don't you let Lily take care of Lily for once in her life? Maybe then she'll stop making so many mistakes!",
        "Lucinda: Like sleeping with your boyfriend?",
        "Meg: Like bringing a man my brother hated into her bed.",
        "Lucinda: Well we're in agreement. Neither of us want that to happen, again.",
        "Meg: Well just because we agree on one thing doesn't necessarily mean we're friends.",
        "Lucinda: I don't like you, either. Well, now that we've taken care of Damian, we can each go our separate ways. And I did you a favor, I kept you out of it. Now you're on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Boy, am I glad to see you.",
        "Luke: I thought you and Mason were spending the evening casting your movie?",
        "Noah: Yeah, that was the plan originally, but I'm not really in the mood for that. And besides I haven't seen you in it feels like forever. You know, and I thought maybe tonight?",
        "Luke: Really? Cause you were really excited to get to casting.",
        "Noah: What are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Luke: No, no, not at all. But I know you. You do not blow off school, even for me. So what's up?",
        "Noah: Mason.",
        "Luke: What about him?",
        "Noah: My so-called professor I think wants to be a little bit more than that. He totally came onto me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I don't have to answer to you, Detective. Unless of course this is an official interrogation, in which case I will call my lawyer. In the meantime, you have no more information about Holden than I have.",
        "Jack: You told Lily that those handwriting samples were not a match. Why lie about that?",
        "Damian: Because I didn't want to torment her with any more uncertainty. We all know Holden couldn't make it out alive out of that accident. It is not healthy to cling to false hope. So which one of us is really helping here, Detective? The one who wants to help Lily move on with her life, or the one prolonging the agony? Lily are you ready?",
        "Lily: When you told me about that report, there were about two minutes when I thought that there was a possibility that he could be alive, and it was wonderful. But then I realized what you were saying. This has got to stop, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Lily.",
        "Lily: I don't think you are. You are way off base about Damian, and I want you to drop it.",
        "Jack: Yeah I'm sorry about that, too. But I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden grunting]",
        "Maeve: Please, please be careful.",
        "Holden: Help! Help! Is there anyone out there?",
        "Maeve: If you get hurt down here, I can't help you. It's no use, this is Skaggs place. There's not another place around here for miles.",
        "Holden: What no -- no hikers? No climbers?",
        "Maeve: Around here, you kidding me? Skaggs was in prison for years before he got killed. Nobody's dropping by anytime soon. It's so cold in here. All my life I've got it wrong. Bad choices and bad people. I finally find a guy who wants to make it good with me, and we -- we're just gonna end up dying in a hole in the ground.",
        "Holden: You need to stop thinking like that.",
        "Maeve: Holden, we're not getting out of here.",
        "Holden: Well, then I guess you're still getting it wrong. We're not going to die.",
        "Maeve: Look around, Holden. We've got no food, no water. Eb wins, and he doesn't even have to waste a bullet.",
        "Holden: This is a root cellar. There's got to be something in here to eat. I just wish there was more light.",
        "Maeve: Shoot. Oh man, I forgot. Matches!",
        "Holden: Here we go!",
        "Maeve: Good one. Okay. I got it. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay.",
        "Holden: That's much better right.",
        "Maeve: Oh yeah, now we get a real good view of the mud. Look, its flickering. I think, hold on, hold on, it doesn't have a lot of kerosene left.",
        "Holden: With any luck, we won't be here long.",
        "Maeve: Well our luck's been so good so far.",
        "Holden: Hey, we're still alive, right?",
        "Maeve: Yeah. If you call it living.",
        "Holden: Jackpot.",
        "Maeve: But we can light a fire, we'll suffocate.",
        "Holden: Well, we don't need fire, we have imagination. I read about this mountain climber, he was way up high on a mountain overnight, and he got stranded. What he did, was he imagined he was in front of a giant bon fire, he would have died otherwise. In the morning, he was still alive. So, here we go. Make believe it's your favorite meal.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Maeve: Okay.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Maeve: What are you having?",
        "Holden: Um -- it's a burger.",
        "Maeve: Oh come on, you can do better than that.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, that's my favorite.",
        "Maeve: Seriously?",
        "Holden: Yeah, medium rare -- medium rare with grilled onions --",
        "Maeve: And bacon?",
        "Holden: You bet. And some of my mother's homemade ketchup.",
        "Maeve: She makes her own ketchup?",
        "Holden: Yeah, it's the best. It's better than anything in the store. What about you? What's your favorite meal?",
        "Maeve: Chateaubriand. I saw a rich lady ordered it on TV once, I have no idea what it is.",
        "Holden: Well, I'll tell you what it is. It's just fancy roast beef. Lily used to order it at the Black Duck.",
        "Maeve: You can't stop missing her, can you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, Mother, what are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Waiting for you. What's he doing here?",
        "Lily: Mother, it's been a long day, and it's not over yet. So if you came to share your feelings about Damian, you can go.",
        "Lucinda: I wasn't expecting a threesome. I just came by to see how you were, how you are, how you're doing. 'Cause I miss you.",
        "Lily: I haven't gone anywhere.",
        "Lucinda: Pussycat, I'm very glad to hear that.",
        "Damian: Lily needs her rest.",
        "Lucinda: We don't need an interpreter. I'm amazed the police let you go so easily.",
        "Damian: What do you know about it?",
        "Lucinda: I don't know much. But wasn't concealing evidence, obstruction of justice, something like that.",
        "Lily: It was you, wasn't it? You're the one that broke into Damian's room and took those documents and gave them to Jack.",
        "Lucinda: Don't be silly, Lily, I never broke into his room.",
        "Damian: But you know who did it, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So is it done?",
        "Jack: Done?",
        "Meg: Damian, did you arrest him?",
        "Jack: How do you know about that?",
        "Meg: There are lots of people in this town that would love to see Damian in jail.",
        "Jack: You know what, they're going to have to wait awhile, because Grimaldi walked.",
        "Meg: How is that possible? We both know he's a liar.",
        "Jack: That may be so, but I can't prove he broke the law.",
        "Meg: What about the documents?",
        "Jack: You mean the ones he was supposed to have sent to the handwriting expert for analysis?",
        "Meg: Yes, Jack, those.",
        "Jack: Yeah, funny thing about those documents -- you see I can't prove that they came from his room. Which means I can't testify to chain of custody. And since they were obtained without a warrant, that pretty much makes them inadmissible in court.",
        "Meg: Well there has to be a way around it. 'Cause we both know he's guilty, find something else.",
        "Jack: I can't Meg. Not without probable cause.",
        "Meg: Dammit.",
        "Jack: Yeah I agree. You see, Meg, if you had just come to me, instead of breaking into Grimaldi's place and making off with the evidence, we could have figure something out.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry I botched things up.",
        "Jack: No. Truth is, those documents didn't make much of a case. I tried to use them as leverage, but Grimaldi, he's slick. He stuck to his story. He swears that he made copies, he sent them off someplace, and he got the results over the phone --",
        "Meg: Yeah but he didn't say where he sent them, because he didn't. And that proves that he lied to the police. So, come on, Jack, do your job, arrest him.",
        "Jack: And charge him with what? Being a bad boyfriend to my cousin?",
        "Meg: That's not fair.",
        "Jack: I don't like the guy either, Meg. But there's a big difference between thinking someone is hiding something and actually proving it. We hit a dead end. And out of respect for Lily, I'm dropping the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So did Mason actually touched you?",
        "Noah: Yeah, sort of. He, um, put his arm -- and he told me he's attracted to me.",
        "Luke: He's your teacher. That is unacceptable.",
        "Noah: I know. It was weird.",
        "Luke: No, no it's not just weird -- it's wrong. What did you say?",
        "Noah: Nothing. I freaked out and I left.",
        "Luke: Okay, where is he now?",
        "Noah: Why? Luke, what are you going to do?",
        "Luke: I'm gonna go get in his face. He can't just walk around hitting on students. He should lose his job for what he did.",
        "Noah: Whoa, hey, hey Luke. Come on, he's my advisor.",
        "Luke: Advisor? Well, I have some advice for him. Keep your damn hands off my boyfriend.",
        "Noah: Luke, I need him. Oaky, I'm about to start shooting, he knows my whole project. It's going to be a better film because of him.",
        "Luke: So what Noah? You're gonna forget this ever happened?",
        "Noah: It's six days of shooting, and then I never have to see him again.",
        "Luke: A lot can happen in six days.",
        "Noah: It won't, okay. You gotta trust me on this. You know, honestly, I might be blowing this whole thing out of proportion. I'm worried about the film -- and when I worry about that I start worrying about other things too.",
        "Luke: Well, what exactly did he say to you again?",
        "Noah: That I was cute and attractive.",
        "Luke: Noah -- he is your teacher. He is grading your final project, he is writing your recommendations. This is sexual harassment, and you have to tell him he can't get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Who broke into my room, Lucinda? Who are you working with?",
        "Lucinda: Working with -- oh God. That's irrelevant.",
        "Lily: No, it's not. They're accusing Damian of things, when the truth is, he's the only one who has supported me without asking for anything in return.",
        "Lucinda: That's because he hasn't gotten around to asking for it yet. I wouldn't be surprised if he proposed to you already. Oh for heavens sake.",
        "Lily: Now, Mother. He's being a friend. Unlike the rest of you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling we all want to help you. All of us, but you keep pushing us away. You've got this Doberman, guarding the door. He's divisive.",
        "Damian: What do you think you're doing now, Lucinda? You're not helping things.",
        "Lily: Have you forgotten, that Damian took a bullet to save your grandson? If he hadn't, I might be -- burying my son next to my husband.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, sure, Damian's the most selfless person.",
        "Lily: He's been nothing but caring and kind to me, and I will not listen to you say anything against him. Do you understand?",
        "Lucinda: He's done it again. He's got you completely brainwashed.",
        "Lily: That's it. Get out.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I think I'll take my leave now. But, Dear, pay attention to what you're doing. You're cutting yourself off from everyone who loves you. And who cares for you, and who would do anything for you. Anything.",
        "Lily: You can't bring Holden back.",
        "Lucinda: No. Although if I could, I'd move heaven and earth. Can you say the same for that one.",
        "Damian: You don't speak for me, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Having Holden back would be the last thing you would want.",
        "Lily: I can't do this today, Mother. Please go.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, Damian has done this before, you know. He waits until you've very vulnerable, and then he makes his move. He takes advantage of you.",
        "Lily: He's looking out me.",
        "Lucinda: No, Darling, he's looking out for himself. It may feel that he's looking out for you, but only himself. That's all he can ever do, no matter how much he swears he loves you.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mason is in a position of power over you. What he is doing is wrong.",
        "Noah: Mason knows I'm taken. Maybe he just needed to say it out loud to --",
        "Luke: To what?",
        "Noah: I don't know. But being attracted to somebody is not a crime.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well he should have kept it to himself. I mean what did he expect you to do?",
        "Noah: Nothing?",
        "Luke: Noth -- I doubt it. Noah you have to tell him that what he is doing is wrong. Otherwise you're giving him permission to do it again.",
        "Noah: Do you really think that?",
        "Luke: I think that Mason has put you in a really bad position. Its like you said yourself, you need his help to finish your film. He knows that and he's it holding over your head. I know you, Noah. You wouldn't be able to work well if you're uncomfortable with the guy. And that will make your film suffer. It's not fair.",
        "Noah: Okay. Okay, all right, I will talk to him.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well then let's go.",
        "Noah: Well Luke --",
        "Luke: Noah, postponing this isn't gonna make it any easier. Come on. I'll be your backup.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: My family is being so awful. I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to just walk away.",
        "Damian: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Lily: How can you stand it? You saved Luke's life and they still won't cut you any slack.",
        "Damian: They love you, Lily. They're being overprotective, yes, but, in light of our history I can hardly blame them.",
        "Lily: Well, I can. I'm a grown woman, I'm not some young teenager in love with the wrong guy.",
        "Damian: In love?",
        "Lily: It's an expression. I wasn't saying --",
        "Damian: I understand. And your mother, Jack, Faith -- they loved Holden very much. They're not thinking clearly.",
        "Lily: When Jack told us about the handwriting sample today, I was so sure Holden was coming back to me.",
        "Damian: I don't care what your family's doing to me. But it's not fair that they're putting you through this. They should know better. Now come on. You need to some rest.",
        "Lily: I don't think I can.",
        "Damian: Try. For me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Everybody thinks that Lily is going to shatter into a little million pieces, but you know what Jack, she's tough. And she's a survivor, and she's proving that by moving on.",
        "Jack: I think the only thing she's proving is that she's lost and she's confused and she's desperate for something to hold onto. But regardless, there's nothing you can do about it, Meg. You're obsessed. You need to let it go.",
        "Meg: Why? Someone has to pay for what happened to my brother.",
        "Jack: And what makes you think Damian had anything to do with it?",
        "Meg: Because, Jack -- he comes into town, pretending to want to get close to Luke. He pretended to be in love me. And this whole time he was just biding his time. Waiting to get rid of Holden so he could get back together with Lily. And maybe that was his plan all along.",
        "Jack: I don't know, I can't listen to this anymore.",
        "Meg: You know what, Damian leads a charmed life. He gets away with everything. Why not this?",
        "Jack: Because, Meg -- this is crazy! No one could pull something like this off without leaving a shred of evidence.",
        "Meg: Well maybe he did. And maybe you need to take a second look.",
        "Jack: No, Meg. Maybe, you need to get a grip. I'm really starting to worry about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: How long do you think we've been down here?",
        "Holden: Don't think about it. Not until we finish dinner.",
        "Maeve: I don't think I can eat any more.",
        "Holden: Well then take a break -- look around. If we can imagine what we're eating, we can imagine where we're eating it.",
        "Maeve: I think I'd rather be eating at your place.",
        "Holden: My place? Okay, um, my place. We have this huge dining table. Lot of kids -- big family, right. It's actually made out of a slab of wood. There was this enormous tree we used to climb when we were kids. It came down in a storm. My cousin Jack and I, we cut it up, and we took a piece of it and he made a table out of it, and he gave it to Lily and me as a wedding present. It definitely needs a little refinishing. From the kids, and all? But, I kind of like it that way. Kind of reminds me of everything we've been through together.",
        "Maeve: It sounds like you had a wonderful life.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it's definitely had its ups and downs. But there's always been something binding Lily and me. Something unbreakable. We've had a lot of rough times, but I'll tell you this I'll never trade them for anything. Why am I talking like it's over? We're gonna get out of here.",
        "Maeve: One way or another.",
        "Holden: Hey come on, a little faith. How about some dessert?",
        "Maeve: Sure, always. I'll rustle up desert. Maybe something up here from one of these barrels or something. Well -- not sure we can make a meal of it.",
        "Holden: Maybe something better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Try to close your eyes for a few minutes.",
        "Lily: No it's no use. My mind just keeps going around in circles, and when I close my eyes, its worse. I think I'm going to take one of the sleeping pills that Susan gave me.",
        "Damian: Are you sure? The last time you ended up sleepwalking into the pond. I don't want that to happen to you again.",
        "Lily: Then stay with me.",
        "Damian: What about Faith?",
        "Lily: She's at a sleepover, remember? Please stay with me. I just need a little peace, and then I'll feel better I know it. I don't trust myself without you.",
        "Damian: Of course, I'll stay. I won't let anything bad happen to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: Luke and Noah.",
        "Luke: Noah needs to talk to you.",
        "Mason: All right, look, I know what you're going to say. I'm sorry. I was out of line. And it wasn't fair to you.",
        "Noah: Thank you.",
        "Luke: Wait that's it? You're sorry. Let's forget it ever happened?",
        "Mason: Luke, I owe you an apology, as well. I am not a home wrecker.",
        "Luke: Well don't worry that wouldn't happen anyway.",
        "Mason: Of course not. Look guys -- ever since George and I broke up -- it's been weird. I don't do this -- I mean like never. It's been a long time since I was alone. It's harder than I remember. I wish I hadn't said the things that I did. But I did and I can't take them back now. I hope we can just chalk this up to a bad moment, and move on. It won't happen again. I promise.",
        "Noah: Thank you. All right. Satisfied?",
        "Luke: Yeah. But if Mason ever tries anything like that again, I'm going to kick his butt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Not trusting Damian doesn't make me crazy.",
        "Jack: Yeah well, it certainly doesn't help. Meg, you're taking this too far.",
        "Meg: And you're not taking it far enough. But then again if I'm crazy, that means you don't have to do your job.",
        "Jack: What would you have me do?",
        "Meg: Well we both know Damian knows more about Holden's disappearance than he's telling us. So get him to admit it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay. It's not that I don't agree with you. But without probable cause there's nothing legally I can do. So until Damian makes a mistake, or someone comes by with new information --",
        "Meg: Fine. You know what, give up. But I never will. Not until Damian gets what he deserves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: I've never seen so much money in my life.",
        "Holden: This has got to be the money from the bank heist.",
        "Maeve: Oh God. Skaggs hid it right under Eb's nose. I told you he was an idiot. Well, I guess it's too late now.",
        "Holden: Maybe not. When he comes back, we can give it to him. There's got to be at least a hundred grand here. That's more than he was going to get from Lily. Maybe then he'll let us go.",
        "Maeve: Eb's not coming back. I finally find the perfect man and enough money to live on easy street, and what good does it do me? Guess the joke's on me, huh.",
