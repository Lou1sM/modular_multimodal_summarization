Great \r\nadoptive parents, Diana and Mitchell Williams, who love you every bit as much as \r\nwe do. And they hold a special place in your heart, and I'll always respect \r\nthat. I want you to know that I'm going to be the first one in line so that if \r\nyou -- my daughter -- ever needs anything, I'll be there for you. Abigail, \r\nyou're your own person, just like your beautiful mother. And I will always \r\ncherish that.",

And I \r\nrealized that you knew that and that that was okay. I mean this -- I was okay \r\njust like I was. And you are proving that to me over and over again. And I'm \r\nasking you to prove it to me one more time. I want you to step with me into this \r\nroller coaster that I call life, and I promise you that I will give you a ride \r\nthat you will never forget.",
        "\r\nMolly: That's a ride that I wouldn't miss for the entire world, Jake. My life \r\nwas an absolute nightmare. And then you came along, and you woke me up from it. \r\nBefore I met you, I'd lost everything and everyone that meant anything to me in \r\nthe world. And worse than that, I had absolutely no hope that that would ever \r\nchange. I knew -- I knew, Jake, that I would be alone forever. But loving you \r\nhas given me my life back. You know something? When I was a little girl, I used \r\nto daydream all the time that there was this handsome prince that would come \r\nalong and rescue me, but I could never see his face. Until right now.",
