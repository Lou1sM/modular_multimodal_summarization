        "Rosanna: Again. Listen, if you're not going to pick up the phone, could you at least call me back? I need to explain some things.",
        "Paul: I'm right here.",
        "Rosanna: Hi. Listen, about what you saw on the phone -- you need to understand.",
        "Paul: The only thing I need to do is get the hell out of this house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: It'll only take a minute for me to pick up my check. And then we'll head to the farm before it gets too late.",
        "Alison: Are you sure it's okay that you bring me?",
        "Aaron: Sure, I'm sure. My dad invited you. Why?",
        "Alison: Because you said it's a family dinner and I'm not exactly family.",
        "Aaron: Don't worry, we Snyders -- we're loose about that.",
        "Alison: I'm serious, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: What's wrong? What are you worried about?",
        "Alison: That video was sent to everybody Dusty knew. Which means your dad probably saw it. And who knows who else. What will they think?",
        "Aaron: They'll think, \"Hey, there's Aaron with Alison. And everybody knows Alison. And Alison's a nice girl. And Alison's beautiful.\" Give me a second, okay?",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Hi.",
        "Bar manager: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Did the office send up the paychecks yet?",
        "Bar manager: Yeah. I've got them right here. Here. Here you go.",
        "Aaron: Hey, is Sofie around? She told me she might be working the evening shift.",
        "Bar manager: Sofie's been fired.",
        "Aaron: I can't believe it.",
        "Alison: Why would they do that?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. She's like the hardest-working cocktail waitress we have.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe we can check back after dinner and find out what happened.",
        "Aaron: No, that's going to be too late. Sofie's been in a real bad place lately. I better find out right now, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Vienna, Darling, that's what we are -- we are a burger joint. And without the burgers, we have no joint. Without the joint, we have no money.",
        "Vienna: First of all, Henry, that greasy little sandwich is terribly misnamed. There are no ham in a hamburger. I say we put in the smorgasbord, and that way, we will have plenty of healthy alternatives.",
        "Henry: We've already got so many things on the menu that people can't pronounce. Why don't we leave the Swedish at pepparkakor, yeah?",
        "Maddie: Hi, Guys.",
        "Vienna: Oh, hey, Madeline! Why don't ask your sister what she thinks?",
        "Henry: Okay, fine. Vienna and I are having a little disagreement about how much more Swedish to add to the menu.",
        "Vienna: Shh. Something is wrong. You look sad. What is it?",
        "Maddie: It's Noah. He finally came out to his dad.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Honey.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: That must be hard for you.",
        "Maddie: I guess. I don't know. I'm just -- I'm really confused right now.",
        "Henry: It's for the best, though, isn't it?",
        "Maddie: For Noah.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and for you, too. You don't want to be in a relationship with someone who's pretending to be something he isn't.",
        "Maddie: I guess.",
        "Henry: Honey, I know it feels bad right now, but it will get better. And now you can make peace with it.",
        "Maddie: That's the problem. I don't think I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Can you put this on the table?",
        "Noah: Sure.",
        "Luke: I hope your dad's not expecting anything too formal. We're just going to be eating outside.",
        "Noah: He'll be fine with whatever.",
        "Luke: Yeah, because your dad's such a laidback guy.",
        "Noah: What are you so worried about?",
        "Luke: Are you kidding me? You, me, your father, my family, at dinner.",
        "Noah: It's not an audition.",
        "Luke: You sure about that?",
        "Noah: What are you -- it's your family, and I'm not worried.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know, but despite what your dad says, I still can't believe that this 180 on your lifestyle is completely legit.",
        "Noah: At least he's trying. If he's not on board now, he'll get there. So just stop worrying and just try to have some fun.",
        "Holden: I was just checking on dinner.",
        "Luke: Well, the chicken's in the oven. And everything else seems good to go.",
        "Noah: Except Luke. I think he's still kind of nervous about my dad staying for dinner.",
        "Holden: It's going to be pretty casual and laidback.",
        "Noah: If you knew my dad --",
        "Holden: You know what, I'm sure that there's nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: He should have gotten to Lily by now. What's taking so long?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: I think you're mistaken.",
        "Sly: Nah. And you heard me loud and clear. You shot Dusty Donovan and left him for dead. I found him in the trunk of a car and asked him who left him like that. He told me.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You're crazy.",
        "Sly: Let's see how crazy Lily Snyder or the cops think I am.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I don't think you're going to get that chance.",
        "[Colonel Mayer grabs hold of Sly's T-shirt]",
        "Holden: What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You're leaving?",
        "Paul: You're surprised?",
        "Rosanna: Listen, about what you saw on the cell phone, I can explain --",
        "Paul: You don't have to explain. You just need to tell me the truth.",
        "Rosanna: Well, the truth is that I -- I love you.",
        "Paul: I knew that yesterday. Today, Rosanna, I don't know that.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, just please -- please tell me that you haven't lost faith in me.",
        "Paul: If you can lie to me about being spied on, maybe you've been lying to me about everything else.",
        "Rosanna: What else?",
        "Paul: We were supposed to be in this together. We were supposed to take Craig down together. Once we did that, we were supposed to get on with our lives together.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, we can. You know, just listen --",
        "Paul: To what? To more sob stories about how you couldn't lie on the stand? About how you couldn't remember something, or say that you couldn't remember something that -- the story for me here isn't that you couldn't lie on the stand. The story for me here is that you had no problem lying to me.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Paul: You do remember that Craig switched those babies. You remember everything that Craig did to you right before he ran you off the road.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Yeah, I remember what Craig did.",
        "Paul: So, you set him free deliberately?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Paul: You were the person in the world that I trusted. You were the person in the world who I thought saw Craig the same way I did -- the exact same way that I did -- as a monster who needs to be brought to his knees.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and I did see that. I still do.",
        "Paul: Then how could you do this? How could you let him go free like this?",
        "Rosanna: Maybe what I did was stupid -- I was desperate.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Rosanna: Because, come on, Paul, you saw the video. You know why!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: I didn't want to upset you, Holden, but I found this man lurking around the house, and I guess instinct just took over.",
        "Holden: What do you want?",
        "Sly: I wasn't looking to rob anybody, honest.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I talked to him. He's just a little down on his luck.",
        "Sly: I didn't mean any harm. I was just looking for some spare change, that's all.",
        "Holden: Here, take that. You hungry? Can I get you something to eat?",
        "Sly: No, thanks. This is really generous. I appreciate it.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, I should have given that guy a little something myself, Holden. Maybe I'll catch up to him.",
        "Holden: I'll go with you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, no -- [Cell phone rings] Here, you grab that call. I'm sure I can handle this myself.",
        "Holden: Hello?",
        "Aaron: Hey, Dad, it's me. Listen, we're going to be running a little bit late.",
        "Holden: But you're still coming, right? I don't want to hold dinner up for too long.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But don't hold anything on our account. Me and Ali just stopped by the Lakeview to pick up a check and talk to the manager.",
        "Holden: Everything all right?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, everything's fine. We'll see you soon, okay?",
        "Holden: Okay, I'll see you soon.",
        "Alison: Your dad wants us there now, doesn't he?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but this is only going to take a second. Can I talk to you for a minute? Just for one minute?",
        "Alison: We should leave now, or we'll be late.",
        "Aaron: I can't leave until I find out why Sofie got fired.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you can't do anything about it right now anyway.",
        "Aaron: Yes, but at least he might be able to explain something --",
        "Alison: I know, but if I remember right, your dad doesn't like people to be late.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, he can get that way sometimes.",
        "Alison: Then let me make a good impression. Please? Come on, let's go.",
        "Aaron: All right, all right. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sly: Yo, Colonel. Stay where you are or I make a ruckus loud enough to bring the whole house running.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'm listening. What do you want?",
        "Sly: First, I'd like an apology.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I might have overreacted earlier, been a little hasty.",
        "Sly: Pathetic. I could have ratted you out, you know.",
        "Colonel Mayer: And I'm glad you didn't. Not only, we wouldn't want to upset Mr. Snyder, or bring the authorities in on this, would we?",
        "Sly: No, we wouldn't.",
        "Colonel Mayer: So, I'm sure you and I can work something out.",
        "Sly: Oh, you'd better believe you're going to work something out with me, Colonel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: No, Rosanna, I don't know why you did it. I don't know how you could let Craig -- a guy how tried to kill you -- you could just let him go.",
        "Rosanna: You saw that video of you and Meg, and you still don't get it?",
        "Paul: You don't like the fact that I ran into her? Whatever you suspect is ridiculous.",
        "Rosanna: Is it?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you have no reason to be insecure about Meg. There's nothing between us.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sorry, I can't accept that anymore.",
        "Paul: You know, if you paid any real attention to what happened on that video, you could see that I was pushing her away.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I know what I heard. But there was a lot more to it than that.",
        "Paul: Like what?",
        "Rosanna: Like what I saw with my own eyes. You're still in love with her.",
        "Paul: I'm not in love with Meg. What am I supposed to do to prove something like that to you?",
        "Rosanna: There's nothing that you can do. I know what I saw.",
        "Paul: Really? Then you're deluded.",
        "Rosanna: No. No, Paul, I'm not. The looks between you. I walked in here and I saw you and Meg together and I asked you about it and you told me that I was imagining things. Well, I wasn't imagining things in court at the hearing when you couldn't take your eyes off of Meg.",
        "Paul: Of course I was looking at Meg. She's with Craig. The two of them are a united front!",
        "Rosanna: And I'm the one that's a liar?",
        "Paul: I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, you know what? Here. Look at it. You look at this video and tell me that you don't know what I'm talking about.",
        "Paul: The only thing I know is what I said to her. If anything, I was angry with Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. You accuse me of lying -- do me a favor, okay? Look at this and tell me what you see, and maybe you can stop lying to yourself, okay? You owe me that much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What you need, Madeline, is a girl's day out. And when you're feeling your old self again, every single red-blooded heterosexual boy in this town will be fighting for you.",
        "Henry: Vienna, uh -- we still need to trim down the menu.",
        "Vienna: Oh, well, why don't I just leave the two of you alone for some brother-sister time, okay?",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Henry: How are you really, Kiddo?",
        "Maddie: Sometimes I'm fine. I don't know, I totally get that Noah's issues weren't about me. And I know that we're not meant to be, but I don't know, I just get really sad about it.",
        "Henry: Vienna may not understand the finer points of the situation, but she is right about one thing -- the sooner you get Noah off your mind, the better.",
        "Maddie: I don't think it's gonna be that easy, Henry. I mean, above all, we're friends. I really care about him. And I'm worried about him.",
        "Henry: Why? Not because he's gay?",
        "Maddie: No, no, no, no. Because he has the father from hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: Go ahead, put your cards on the table.",
        "Sly: The way I see it, what's done is done. You jacked up that Donovan guy and you must've had your reasons. But hey, I'm not a nosy guy. In fact, I'm thinking I'd like to go down Florida, take up the dog races. But for that, I'm gonna need some scratch, and I ain't got but -- 10 bucks.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, here. Take this. Should be about $1,000 there.",
        "Sly: Nice.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Good. Now get lost.",
        "Sly: Except I bet I could get more from Lily Snyder.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, unfortunately for you, the lady of the house is not in town.",
        "Sly: Like I should believe you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I don't care what you believe, but go ahead, knock on the door. Not only will you not find Lily, but you'll get the third degree from her husband. And if he doesn't like your answers, well, he just might call in his cousin who happens to be a police detective. Isn't that convenient?",
        "Sly: Maybe we understand each other after all.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I thought so.",
        "Sly: Take it easy, Colonel.",
        "Colonel Mayer: One more thing -- Donovan. Is he still in that car?",
        "Sly: Where else would he be? Dead men don't walk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dusty groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: So you're saying Donovan was alive when you found him and now he's dead?",
        "Sly: Why do you think I came to find you instead of Lily Snyder? People aren't that generous with a reward when all they get for it is a dead body. But since he told me you were the one who shot him, I figured you'd have more to lose if anybody found him.",
        "[Car approaching]",
        "Colonel Mayer: Enjoy Florida. Beat it.",
        "Sly: Nice doing business with you, Colonel.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Hi. You must be Holden Snyder's older son, Aaron, is it?",
        "Aaron: That's right. And you?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Win, Win Mayer. Colonel Win Mayer.",
        "Aaron: Wow, Colonel, nice to meet you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Nice to meet you.",
        "Aaron: This is my friend, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi, nice to meet you, Colonel.",
        "Aaron: You a client of my father's?",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, I'm the father of Luke's friend and your father graciously invited us to join the family for dinner.",
        "Aaron: Great. Well, you can always count on that around here. There's always extra room at our table.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I can't help but notice that you're very different from your brother.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but we're still a family. Should we go in?",
        "Colonel Mayer: After you.",
        "Aaron: All right.",
        "Faith: How come we're doing a buffet?",
        "Holden: This is probably going to be the last warm day of fall, I thought we should take advantage of it and eat outside.",
        "Faith: Cool. Don't do that!",
        "Luke: But I love the way you make cole slaw.",
        "Noah: Yeah, and you got it all over you.",
        "Holden: Sweetie, do me a favor. Grab the lemonade?",
        "Faith: Sure.",
        "Luke: I'll help.",
        "Faith: Is Noah your boyfriend?",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Luke: I don't know.",
        "Aaron: Hello, everybody.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Faith: Hey, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Hey. You remember my friend Alison, right?",
        "Faith: Hi.",
        "Alison: Wow, you've grown up so much. And you look absolutely gorgeous.",
        "Faith: I don't know about that.",
        "Luke: Aaron, Alison, this is my friend, Noah. And I guess you met his dad.",
        "Aaron: Nice to meet you.",
        "Noah: Good to meet you, too. I've heard a lot of good things about you. Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey. Hi, Mr. Snyder.",
        "Holden: Hi, Alison. Glad you could make it.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Here, young lady, let me help you with that.",
        "Faith: Oh, thanks. You know, your son seems really nice.",
        "Alison: Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "Holden: I don't think so, Ali.",
        "Alison: You know, I'm a waitress, you know. So I can carry really hot plates.",
        "Holden: I think I've got everything under control.",
        "Alison: All right.",
        "Aaron: How's it going?",
        "Holden: Excuse me.",
        "Alison: Your dad hates me.",
        "Holden: All right, I think we're ready to head outside. Luke, why don't you grab some extra napkins?",
        "Luke: Sure, sure.",
        "Margo: Hello, hello --",
        "Holden: Margo, hi.",
        "Margo: Sorry, looks like I'm interrupting a party here.",
        "Holden: No, no, it's just a family dinner. What can I do for you?",
        "Margo: Well, I have a couple of questions for you. It won't take long.",
        "Holden: Okay, can we do it here?",
        "Margo: Sure, sure, yeah. I was just wondering if you or Lily or any of you as a matter of fact, have heard anything from Dusty Donovan?",
        "Holden: Like I told Dallas, Lily's out of town. She's chaperoning Nat's scout troop.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, he mentioned that.",
        "Holden: Are you here because you think that Dusty skipped bail?",
        "Alison: He didn't. Dusty's not the type of guy to run. Especially when he didn't kill anyone. I'm sure if you look around, you'll find him.",
        "Margo: Well, you're wrong, Alison. Because he's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: And you know the things that he's done.",
        "Rosanna: So, do you see now why I gave Craig his freedom? Because now Meg won't desert him.",
        "Paul: You and I had an agreement. We were committed to making Craig pay for what he had done to you.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, I was committed to you, Paul. And I thought that letting Craig go was a way of keeping you. Now that I have lost you, I think that the least that you can do is give me the truth.",
        "Paul: I've already given you the truth, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Come on. Then you are completely fooling yourself. Maybe I made a mistake in letting Craig go, okay? But I did it because I thought it would give us a chance to have the life that you keep saying that we deserve to have. If I made a mistake, then I will live with it, okay? And I will let you go. But please don't walk out the door without giving me the truth.",
        "Paul: All right. What is it you want to hear?",
        "Rosanna: Tell me, after seeing that tape, that this is all in my head. Tell me that what you and Meg are doing and what I see can be explained some other way. Tell me that you don't love her. See? You can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How can you be so sure Dusty's gone?",
        "Margo: Well, I wouldn't normally reveal this, but since the press is probably going to break the story any minute now, I guess I can tell you that we have confiscated Donovan's computer and he was doing research on other countries.",
        "Alison: So, maybe he was thinking that once the police realized they had the wrong guy, that maybe he'd go on a vacation or something.",
        "Margo: No, I don't think so, because all of the searches were places that don't have an extradition treaty with the U.S.",
        "Alison: That doesn't mean anything.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You may not realize this, young lady, but both myself and my son overheard that man threatening the victim just before she died, and he was furious with her.",
        "Alison: Yeah? Well, so was I. She did a pretty awful thing to us, but that doesn't mean he killed her.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'm sorry. Obviously, you and this -- this man were friends.",
        "Alison: Excuse me. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You're worried about Noah because of his dad? What's he done?",
        "Maddie: You remember how weird you thought it was that he was thrilled that Noah and I were going to be together?",
        "Henry: Yeah, for such a straight arrow, he certainly was invested in you two setting up housekeeping.",
        "Maddie: He bought us a bed, Henry. He was so happy that we were going to live together. He even liked you!",
        "Henry: Is that so hard to believe?",
        "Maddie: No, of course not, but he didn't even think twice about the fact that our sister's in prison for multiple homicides.",
        "Henry: Well, I think he suspected that Noah was gay, and he thought maybe you were the cure.",
        "Maddie: I know that now.",
        "Henry: So what's the problem?",
        "Maddie: The problem is, I think he's doing the same thing to Luke that he did with me.",
        "Henry: What does that mean?",
        "Maddie: Well, okay. He made a complete turnaround. It's like he accepts the fact that Noah and Luke are now together, without a problem.",
        "Henry: That is weird.",
        "Maddie: I know. It's one thing if he's having a really hard time trying to get his head around it. That would make sense to me. But to be so scared that Noah was gay, and then to find out that Noah actually is gay. And it's like, boom, he's totally fine with it. It's just not --",
        "Henry: It's not believable.",
        "Maddie: No. Not at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Aaron: What happened? Why'd you run?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Maybe it's the hormones they're giving me, but I don't feel well and I'm taking everything so personally.",
        "Aaron: Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not like Margo came in asking about a complete stranger.",
        "Alison: Just because I don't think Dusty's a murderer, that doesn't mean I'm in love with him. You know that, right?",
        "Aaron: Of course I do. Come here.",
        "Alison: I just -- I wanted everything to go so well tonight with your dad, and now look.",
        "Aaron: It's not too late. Let's go back inside.",
        "Alison: Oh, I can't. I can't. Can we just go take a walk somewhere or something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, you let me know if you hear anything.",
        "Holden: Of course.",
        "Margo: And you should probably tell Lily all about this since she did, you know, post bail. Sorry she's gonna lose all that money. Pretty hefty bond.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, I can't tell her who to be friends with or how to spend her money.",
        "Margo: But I bet you'd like to. Sorry for the interruption, everyone. Good night.",
        "Faith: Dad, why did Alison just freak out?",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm hungry. Let's eat.",
        "Noah: You don't have to ask me twice.",
        "Luke: Me neither.",
        "Holden: Luke, grab the mustard from the fridge?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You want the truth?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, please.",
        "Paul: The truth is, I hate Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Paul.",
        "Paul: I do. I hate her. I hate Meg for what she's done to me. I hate that she dumped me for Craig. I hate that she's stood by a man who tried to kill you. A guy who, given half a chance, would kill me without even batting an eye.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. And, but, so?",
        "Paul: You're right. That's -- that's not the whole story. I do still have feelings for Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Well, I asked for it.",
        "Paul: I'm not trying to hurt you.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. It's okay. I should have realized I can't make you love me.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I can't make you have feelings for me just because --",
        "Paul: Stop, you don't understand what it is that I'm trying to say. Yes, I have feelings for Meg, but they're -- they're from another time. I'm at a very different place in my life right now. And there isn't any room in my life for Meg. I love you. Rosanna, you are the only woman that I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Your dad doesn't want me anywhere near you, I could tell.",
        "Aaron: Stop saying that.",
        "Alison: And Lily probably feels the same way.",
        "Aaron: Lily wasn't even there.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but when she gets back, your dad's gonna tell her what happened, and then she's gonna hate me even more than she did before she left. And they have every reason to.",
        "Aaron: They don't have a single reason to. You haven't done anything to them. Okay, correction. The stuff that affected them -- it happened a real long time ago.",
        "Alison: And the video online?",
        "Aaron: That's none of their business. Besides, you're my friend, not theirs.",
        "Alison: Just face it, Aaron. My life's been a huge train wreck, and the people who love you most, especially your parents, are probably scared to death that I'm gonna mess up your life, too. I don't want to scare the people who care about you most. I want them to be happy that you're with me.",
        "Aaron: Why do you care what they think? I thought I was the only one that mattered.",
        "Alison: You are.",
        "Aaron: Then stop worrying. Sofie. I heard you got let go. What happened? Where are you going? Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Have you talked to Luke or Noah about this?",
        "Maddie: I can't.",
        "Henry: Why not? They're your friends.",
        "Maddie: Well, of course they are, but Noah dumped me and Luke stole my boyfriend. They would think that I'm pouring cold water on their happy time.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you're afraid that they won't be interested in your take on Noah's dad's behavior.",
        "Maddie: It's just so weird how he completely changed.",
        "Henry: Look, Luke is a smart kid. He will see right through this. People can't hide their true feelings for very long.",
        "Maddie: I hope he sees through him sooner rather than later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: Luke.",
        "[Luke gasps]",
        "Luke: Oh, Colonel Mayer, can I help you with something?",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, I just had a favor I wanted to ask you and it would mean the world to me if you said yes.",
        "Faith: I don't understand. Why was Alison so upset when we were all talking about Dusty? Did they used to go out or something?",
        "Holden: They're just friends, Honey.",
        "Faith: Like he is with Mom?",
        "Holden: No, not exactly.",
        "Faith: Isn't Mom going to be upset when she finds out that Dusty left.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I think she probably will be. Do you think I should call her, let her know before she hears it on the news?",
        "Faith: I think that she'll take it a lot better if she hears it from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You want me?",
        "Paul: Absolutely.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I'm lost.",
        "Paul: Look, I think that I was afraid of my old feelings for Meg, so I just pretended that they weren't there. But I can see that they're just a holdover from another time. You know, a time, in fairness, that I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again. But now that you are back, I don't want Meg, I want you.",
        "Rosanna: I would love to believe that, I want to believe that, but it seems like every time Meg walks into the room, you're drawn to her. I mean, you may not want it to be that way, but it's true. There's something there.",
        "Paul: I think that's just -- you know, that's just a reflex. It's like a habit. It's an old habit and I can see now it was never good for me to begin with. You're really good for me. And I need you.",
        "Rosanna: I want to believe that.",
        "Paul: I'm not perfect, you know? I know that. I get jealous, and I hold onto everything for too long. But I'm a good guy. There's a good part of me. You know, the part of me that went and got you and brought you here when you couldn't find your own way back home. The part of me that took you by your hand and brought us back, both of us. And that part of me, that good part of me -- that part of me just wants you, Rosanna. Only you.",
        "Rosanna: What about what I've done? The lying on the stand and letting Craig go -- can you forgive me?",
        "Paul: I have no right to judge you. I have no right to ask you to love me again, but that is what I'm doing.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you do realize that a minute ago you were walking out the door, right?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Well, I guess I'm a little crazy.",
        "[Rosanna chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, I just -- I need to believe that you can really pull this off. That you can forgive me -- you can forgive me for lying and forget that I let Craig off and not hold it against me.",
        "Paul: I just want to let it all go. All of it. I just want to put it all behind us and forget it ever happened. You know, there's one other thing that I want, too.",
        "Rosanna: What's that?",
        "Paul: Marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Cole knocks all these things off the table, and I guess that was the last straw. I've brought too many personal problems into work. I tried to explain, but the manager still fired me.",
        "Alison: What a creep.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, when I got home, Cole had moved out. He took everything. I mean, just when I thought things couldn't get any worse.",
        "Aaron: So if Cole moved out, why are you dragging all the stuff around?",
        "Sofie: The landlord wouldn't let me stay in the apartment. I guess Cole hadn't been giving him the money I'd been giving him for rent.",
        "Aaron: And you don't know where Cole is right now?",
        "Sofie: No. If I did, I'd find him.",
        "Alison: And do what?",
        "Sofie: Try to work it out. But I have no money to try and track him down.",
        "Aaron: What are you going to do?",
        "Sofie: It's pretty warm out. I could crash here tonight until I figure things out.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no. You're pregnant, you can't sleep on the streets.",
        "Alison: There's a shelter over on Court Street.",
        "Sofie: Oh, you think they might have a bed for me?",
        "Alison: I mean, you can try. It's probably pretty basic, but for one night --",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, no way! You're staying at the farm.",
        "Sofie: What farm?",
        "Aaron: My grandmother's farm. She's not there right now, but I'll give her a call. She'd be happy to have you.",
        "Sofie: She doesn't even know me.",
        "Aaron: Yes, but I do. And I can vouch for you.",
        "Sofie: Aaron, I couldn't.",
        "Aaron: Listen, listen. I'll tell you what, since you're so uncomfortable about it, I'll stay out there with you until you feel okay.",
        "Sofie: I couldn't let you do that.",
        "Aaron: There's no arguments, okay? I'm gonna get you set up at the farm, and that's all there is to it. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, hi. I'm fine. We're actually having a family picnic outside. I have some news. Margo stopped by, and she had a few questions about Dusty. He's missing. Lily, Lily, no, he's not in Oakdale, and the police think that he jumped bail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Lily's not coming. Nobody's coming. You've got to do it yourself. Yeah. [Grunts] Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So what were you two up to?",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Noah: What were you guys talking about for so long?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Why don't you go ahead and tell him?",
        "Luke: Your dad wants the three of us to go on a fishing trip together.",
        "Noah: You're kidding.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I told you he'd say that.",
        "Luke: Why are you so surprised?",
        "Noah: Because -- I mean, this is a first. You've never invited anybody along with us.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, no one has ever been as important to you as Luke is, right?",
        "Noah: Dad, I can't tell you how much this means to me.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Look, I'm not going to lie. It's pretty clear that I struggle with your relationship, but I've tried to put my misgivings behind me, and I think this would be a great way to make a new start.",
        "Noah: It's great, I love it.",
        "Luke: Well, my dad loves fishing, too. Should I ask him if he wants to come with us?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, that's a great idea, next time. This time, let's just make it the three of us. You can understand that, right?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're not saying anything. That's kind of hard for me, you know? A guy who just proposed.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you want to go ahead with our marriage plans?",
        "Paul: We've been hiding from each other because we're afraid to face the truth. But we did that today. Everything's out on the table. I don't see why we would wait anymore.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, an hour ago, you were leaving me.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but you didn't let me, right? You made me stay here and listen to you, and I did, because I love you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I love you, too. Maybe that's not enough.",
        "Paul: Why isn't that enough? Rosanna, I meant what I said. There isn't anyone else. And all I want in this world is you.",
        "Rosanna: I don't -- I don't want to lose you.",
        "Paul: I don't want to lose you, either. So how about you marry me?",
        "Rosanna: Okay, when?",
        "Paul: Yesterday.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Paul: You and I have a wedding date.",
        "Rosanna: When?",
        "Paul: Halloween.",
        "Craig: It always comes back to Paul.",
        "Barbara: Don't tell me you're having trouble with your donor already.",
        "Aaron: But it's not Alison's decision whether or not you stay.",
        "Sofie: It's mine, and I'm going.",
