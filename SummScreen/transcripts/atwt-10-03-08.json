        "Lucinda: Oh, yes. Thank you. Well, before we get this show on the road, I thought we should get ahead of the crowd because I want to toast you. You. Because this idea to rescue Emma's land was all yours.",
        "Brian: It's all for a good cause.",
        "Lucinda: No, you're amazing. Brian Wheatley is amazing because when there's a job to be done, he's the man to do it.",
        "[Champagne pops]",
        "Brian: Well, not exactly. I, for instance, I don't know anything about decontamination.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, so what? So what, Honey? You know how to raise the money to get the company and do it right. Thank you. Here we go. I'm drinking to an unsung hero, Brian Wheatley. And I will sing his praises to anyone who can bother to hear me try to carry a tune.",
        "Brian: You deserve the praises, Lucinda. You inspire me.",
        "Lily: Sorry to break this up.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Darling. What is it?",
        "Lily: I have something to say to you, Mother. Stay the hell out of my life!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Yes, hi, I called yesterday. I'm trying to reach Dusty Donovan. It's an emergency. So you have no idea where he is? No, no, that's okay. If you've already left him a message, and he hasn't responded, there's nothing more I can do at this point. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, God, what crime have I committed now?",
        "Lily: I went to see Carly yesterday. She told me that you told her not to come to the benefit -- even though the party's at her club!",
        "Lucinda: After her heinous behavior and the way she treated you, I think her banishment is entirely appropriate.",
        "Lily: No, Mother, it's inexcusable. I can handle my own marriage.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want to see you hurt again.",
        "Lily: Mother, I am not 15. If I need to deal with Carly, I'll do it myself. Back off!",
        "Brian: All mothers worry about their children no matter how grown-up they are. You have to understand that as a mother yourself.",
        "Lily: I know you love me, but stay out of this. I'll see you both at the party tonight. At Carly's club.",
        "Lucinda: Are we having fun yet?",
        "Brian: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Janet: Who is it?",
        "Jack: It's Jack -- open up.",
        "Janet: I'm not ready!",
        "Jack: I know that because I have your dress.",
        "Janet: Oh! I didn't want you to see me like this.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm sorry. Carly -- Carly dropped this off at the farm by mistake.",
        "Janet: Why? She knows I'm not living there anymore.",
        "Jack: It must have slipped -- it must have slipped her mind or something.",
        "Janet: All right. Well, it's kind of weird how your ex keeps fixing us up, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it takes some getting used to.",
        "Janet: Yeah. Well, okay, I'm gonna go slip this on. And you make yourself comfortable.",
        "Jack: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, not so fast. We still have some time before the party.",
        "Alison: You just got out of the shower.",
        "Aaron: God, you smell good.",
        "Alison: Are you going to make me do my makeup all over again?",
        "Aaron: Mm-hmm. And it'll be worth it. And if we're late to the benefit, um, who cares?",
        "Alison: I do, and it's important to your grandmother.",
        "Aaron: Grandma's not gonna be there. She had to go out of town.",
        "Alison: Well, your parents, then. Okay? We have to make a showing.",
        "Aaron: Today it's the benefit. Yesterday you were just too tired from studying. I mean, it's like you'll make any excuse not to make love. What's up with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Where did I put those earrings? Hey! What are you doing here, Emily?",
        "Emily: Is Casey here?",
        "Margo: He doesn't want to see you.",
        "Emily: I need to talk to him, Margo.",
        "Margo: Emily, it's over. Deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Just sit down. Did something happen with Paul?",
        "Meg: No, not Paul, Margo.",
        "Holden: Margo? What happened?",
        "Meg: She threatened to have me arrested if I don't tell her who was there when James was killed.",
        "Holden: Yeah, Jack said that she was on the warpath, but there's no way she can arrest you. You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Meg: I gave Dusty my word that I wouldn't tell anyone that he was there.",
        "Holden: Look, I know he doesn't want anybody to know that he's alive and that he's still looking for Johnny, but why should you throw yourself under a bus for this guy?",
        "Meg: I was very close to Dusty at one time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, so was Lily and we both almost went to jail because of that. Why do you feel like you need to help this guy cover his tracks?",
        "Meg: Okay, look, he gave me a number for a private investigator in San Francisco. So, I called and asked him if he could contact Dusty to see what I should do.",
        "Holden: So what happened?",
        "Meg: He may or may not have gotten the message, I don't know, but he didn't respond. I am so scared, Holden. I don't want to betray Dusty's confidence, but if I'm arrested, what is that going to do to my baby? What am I going to do?",
        "Holden: I'll tell you what I'm not going to let you do -- lie to Margo. You're going to tell her the truth. And if you don't do it, I will.",
        "Meg: No, you can't! I promised!",
        "Holden: There's no way I'm going to let my pregnant sister go to jail. I will tell Margo myself what happened if I have to.",
        "Lily: What's going on? Holden?",
        "Meg: I was just telling Holden how hard it is for me with Paul being in the hospital, and they won't even allow me to see him.",
        "Lily: I am so sorry, Meg. I can't even imagine how rough that must be for you.",
        "Meg: I guess it could be worse. But I will figure the way to deal with it. Look, I should let you guys get ready for the party. Okay.",
        "Lily: See you. You seem as tense as she is.",
        "Holden: It's just hard not to worry about her when she's so upset about Paul.",
        "Lily: Are you sure that's all there is?",
        "Holden: Isn't that enough? Listen, I should get these brochures to Metro and get everything set up. You should get dressed.",
        "Lily: You go ahead. I'll meet you there.",
        "Holden: And if Carly's around when I get there?",
        "Lily: I'm sure you can handle being alone with her for a few minutes. I'll see you there.",
        "Holden: I'll see you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yes, Casey told me you tied your tubes even though he begged you not to.",
        "Emily: It was my decision. He had no right sharing that with you.",
        "Margo: It's a very selfish decision. Now he sees what a selfish person you are. And as far as he's concerned, the two of you were never meant to be together.",
        "Emily: He said that?",
        "Margo: Yeah, he said that.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm sorry he feels that way. It was the right thing to do, and maybe someday he will understand that.",
        "Margo: Well, he understands that you're no good for him. You're no good for anyone, really, but at least he knows it. He had to learn it the hard way.",
        "Emily: You know what? There -- there is one small upside to not seeing Casey anymore. I won't have to listen to your mouth, so you can take that smug, self-righteous attitude of yours and stick it where the sun don't shine!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: But it's not you, Aaron. It's me.",
        "Aaron: You still freaked out about the diagnosis?",
        "Alison: P.I.D. is serious. It means I may never be able to have a baby.",
        "Aaron: Okay, but there's no pressure. I already told you that.",
        "Alison: It's all my fault. If I hadn't made those stupid decisions in the past like I have.",
        "Aaron: Oh, come on, stop that! Come on. You can't go back. You can only go forward. It sucks we can't have a baby now, but it's not the end of the world. We have options.",
        "Alison: Hormone shots?",
        "Aaron: Yes! In vitro, whatever. It doesn't -- we can even adopt. The point is, is that we just got married. Come on --",
        "Alison: That's not the tune you were singing a couple weeks ago.",
        "Aaron: I know, I know. I got really into being a daddy and all that stuff. But listen, I just realized that we just got married. We should enjoy being newlyweds.",
        "Alison: It's because you want a family, Aaron, and right now you're acting like it's no big deal because you're trying to make me feel better. But it is a big deal, and we both know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're early.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I had to bring these brochures and put them in the bags before the guests get here.",
        "Carly: Okay. I can help you with that. What is it? Do I have lettuce in my teeth?",
        "Holden: No, no, it's just -- you look great.",
        "Carly: Don't start.",
        "Holden: I'm not. I'm just stating a fact.",
        "Carly: All right, just hold off on the compliments. Okay? Last thing I need is another lecture from your wife.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I heard Lily came to see you. I told her to leave it alone, but I guess she couldn't do it.",
        "Carly: Well, I do understand. I known it's difficult for her.",
        "Holden: Yeah. It's not easy for me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What do you think? Too much?",
        "Jack: You look awesome.",
        "Janet: No, no, not me -- the dress. This is the first time I've worn a custom- made anything, and the designer pinned me into it herself. I guess I have Carly to thank for that.",
        "Jack: That makes two of us.",
        "Janet: Kind of weird, huh? Awkward your ex setting us up.",
        "Jack: It's different.",
        "Janet: Too much?",
        "Jack: No, it's fine.",
        "Janet: Well, in case I forgot to tell you -- you look amazing.",
        "Jack: Thanks. Come on, let me go show you off!",
        "Janet: Ooh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I have to admit, getting things back to the way they were before -- it's kind of a struggle.",
        "Carly: I know just what you mean. I feel like every day is a test for me. Like I have to prove myself to Lily and Jack, and everyone in the world.",
        "Holden: I wish I could help.",
        "Carly: Well, no offense, but if I need help I think I'm going to have to ask somebody else. In fact --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Carly: I really probably shouldn't be here. You know, maybe Lucinda was right. I should make myself scarce.",
        "Holden: No, no. It's your place. You should be here.",
        "Lily: Holden's right. It was very generous of you to host this benefit.",
        "Carly: Well, I certainly hope this evening is everything you both want it to be.",
        "Lucinda: Well, look who didn't take my advice.",
        "Lily: Don't start, Mother.",
        "Carly: I'll make sure the staff is ready.",
        "Lucinda: You do that.",
        "Lily: Would you pull in the claws, please?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I want what's best for you and best for the fundraiser. The last thing we need around here is an ugly scene.",
        "Lily: Well, then let's not start one, okay? We all want this party to be a success.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, of course we do. And apropos of that, I have a short announcement to make when enough of the guests have arrived.",
        "Lily: Am I going to like it?",
        "Brian: Don't worry, it's a good thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hello, Meg.",
        "Meg: Margo, I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm off duty, and it's a worthy cause, and if you'd like to make an official statement about what really happened when Stenbeck died --",
        "Meg: I can't tell you what I don't know.",
        "Margo: It's just a general reminder. Possibly the identity of the other person. The one that was shot. And if you'd like to throw in who pulled the trigger that would be greatly appreciated.",
        "Meg: Margo, this event is very important to my family. Can you just let me do what I have to do?",
        "Margo: I understand that. I'll be here all night.",
        "Meg: Are you going to harass me all night?",
        "Margo: Only if you refuse to cooperate.",
        "Emily: Margo's not happy unless she's making somebody miserable. I guess it's your turn. So, what did you do to end up on her hit list?",
        "Margo: I will be on the other side of the room if you want to talk, Meg.",
        "Emily: So come on, what did you do?",
        "Meg: Nothing I can't handle. Can I get you a drink? I'll find a waiter.",
        "Emily: No, no -- hey, are you sure everything's okay?",
        "Meg: What could be wrong? My family is sponsoring a great cause, and all these nice people have shown up to support us.",
        "Emily: I don't know, you just don't seem like you're in a party mood. I mean, I know why. I heard about Paul. I heard he flipped out when he found out his father was killed. I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: You know, I really don't want to talk about that, Emily. They're about to start. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Wow. Good -- we're not too late.",
        "Holden: Good evening, everyone. I want to thank you for coming out and supporting Project Greenup.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Holden: My Mother, Emma Snyder, was supposed to host this event tonight, but she couldn't be here. We had a family emergency. Family is very important to her, and so is the farm -- protecting the land that's given us so much over the years.",
        "Lily: It's Emma's dearest wish to preserve the farmland as protected green space.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me, Lily. Might I interrupt right now? Because I have a short announcement to make, and I think this is the proper junction.",
        "Holden: Ladies and gentlemen, Lucinda Walsh.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Lucinda: Thank you -- and thank you people for being here this evening. And thank you for bringing your checkbooks. It's a very short announcement. I just want you to know that I called a meeting of the board of Worldwide Industries. And today, at my suggestion, they've approved a plan to sell back the land that we're planning to develop to Mrs. Emma Snyder for $1.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Lucinda: Which means that tonight, any of the funds that are raised will go to cleaning up the contaminated land and returning it as a nature preserve and a public park for generations of our Oakdale children.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Lily: That's a wonderful gesture, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, it wasn't me. It was him.",
        "Lily: Well, he is a good influence.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, thank you, that was very generous. Like Lucinda said, I hope you'll all get out your checkbooks and make big donations. I'd like to introduce our musical guest for the evening, Mr. Will Dailey.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Lloyd. Is Aaron around?",
        "Bartender: No, I'm covering his shift tonight. He said he was going to that benefit with you.",
        "Alison: Our signals must have got crossed. I guess I'm supposed to meet him at Metro.",
        "Bartender: Have fun. You guys are still on your honeymoon, right?",
        "Alison: Right. See ya.",
        "Chris: Ali -- hey, hey. Where's the fire?",
        "Alison: Chris, sorry. I'm late. I have to go.",
        "Chris: Whoa, you all right?",
        "Alison: I am fine.",
        "Chris: No, you're not. Can I help?",
        "Alison: No! You always assume that you can make everything better, but you can't, not this time, okay? No one can!",
        "Chris: Hey, you can't keep this all bottled up inside. All right? Tell me what's wrong.",
        "Alison: I have screwed up my whole life. First I fix it so I will never be able to get pregnant, and now my marriage is going down the tubes, which should make you happy.",
        "Chris: I can't be happy when you're miserable. That's not how it works.",
        "Alison: Well, I wish someone would tell me how it does work or how I'm supposed to make it work.",
        "Chris: At this point, I'm not sure you can.",
        "Alison: Thanks a lot.",
        "Chris: Hey, I'm just saying what you already know, Ali. You can't love Aaron because you still have feelings for me.",
        "Alison: Not everything is about you.",
        "Chris: We belong together, Alison. And deep down, I think you know you never should have married Aaron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Need some help?",
        "Carly: Yeah, okay. I thought I'd donate the champagne. Hopefully, people will loosen up and donate some money.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Let's see how it works. Would you like some champagne?",
        "Guest: Thank you.",
        "Lily: Enjoy. Champagne, Sir?",
        "Dusty: Hey, Lily.",
        "[Crash]",
        "Dusty: Sorry to just show up like this. Out of the blue.",
        "Lily: I can't -- how is this possible?",
        "Dusty: Long story.",
        "Holden: What the hell is he doing? He said he'd never show his face here again.",
        "Meg: Well, guess he changed his mind.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Meg: I don't know. Maybe for me.",
        "Lucinda: He's not supposed to be here.",
        "Brian: I'm sorry, what did you say?",
        "Dusty: Sorry to put a damper on your party. I actually here to see Margo. I have some things to explain to the cops.",
        "Margo: Excuse me. That's a good idea. So, start talking.",
        "Dusty: I understand you have some questions about what happened to James Stenbeck.",
        "Margo: You were there?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I was struggling with him when Paul's gun went off.",
        "Margo: So you're the one who was shot?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. But I got lucky. The bullet only grazed me. Merely a flesh wound. What I wanted to tell you -- is that Meg Snyder is totally innocent.",
        "Margo: Not totally. I asked her who else was there, she conveniently neglected to mention you.",
        "Dusty: That's because I didn't want anyone to know I was alive, I swore her to secrecy. If you need to arrest anyone, arrest me.",
        "Margo: That sounds like a good idea. That's exactly what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron and I had a fight. But we can fix it. And we will. Because Aaron doesn't give up. He has patience. And he understands me.",
        "Alison: Chris, please, please, don't --",
        "Chris: If you force yourself to stay married to him, you'll never be happy. Not like you could be happy with me.",
        "Alison: Would you just stop it? This isn't going to do anybody any good.",
        "Chris: Alison, I have something to tell you. I got a job offer today from the global health association. They want me to go back to Africa.",
        "Alison: Africa. Are you going to go?",
        "Chris: They're desperate for doctors and nurses. You could come with me. I'll help you finish your nursing degree. We can help people. We can make a difference.",
        "Alison: No, no, I -- I can't leave Aaron.",
        "Chris: Yes, you can. Just walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, Dusty, we'll take you down to headquarters, get it all on record. We'll start with how you convinced everyone you were dead.",
        "Jack: Dusty. Need some help, Margo?",
        "Margo: No, I've got it covered. Why don't you just stay and enjoy the party.",
        "Janet: You okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm fine. I just forget that I'm not a cop anymore.",
        "Emily: Dusty?",
        "Margo: Emily, this is an official investigation. Would you get a life?",
        "Lily: I have to go with him.",
        "Lucinda: You will do no such thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I can't. It wouldn't work. We both know it wouldn't work.",
        "Chris: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because too much has happened. We would just end up screwing it up like we always do. You have to let it go. You have to let me go. We just -- we can't.",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey, hey. When are you going to get it through your thick skull that Alison just wants you to leave her alone?",
        "Chris: You don't have a clue what Alison wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I thought I made myself clear to you. You do not tell me what to do.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, I'll handle this.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, whatever you will. But she's in shock. Just don't let Lily do something that she'll regret.",
        "Brian: Why don't we get out of here?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, why don't we?",
        "Lily: How could this be happening? How could Dusty be alive?",
        "Holden: I'm sure Margo will get all the answers, and fill us in. But right now, what we need to do is keep this party rolling. Can you help me do that?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",

        "Aaron: How the hell would you know what Alison wants?",
        "Chris: She talks to me. I understand her.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah, right. You know, you're a lot dumber than you look!",
        "Chris: Really? Really? Am I so dumb to think that a woman who slept with another guy the day before her wedding maybe married the wrong man?",
        "Aaron: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: Forget it. It doesn't matter.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no. It does matter, okay? I'm not going to stand here and let you throw rumors around about my wife!",
        "Chris: I am not having this conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I think it's crazy that a good cop like you gets shut out at a time like this.",
        "Jack: Not much I can do about it, Janet.",
        "Janet: Maybe --",
        "Jack: You know what? How about we don't talk about it. In fact -- why don't we just go?",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron, I have been looking all over for you. Where did you go? Please, don't be mad at me. We need to work things out and talk.",
        "Aaron: How do we do that? I'd really like to know how you think you can do that.",
        "Alison: Because I'm can stop obsessing about what we can't have, and concentrate on what we can have. You were right. We should just enjoy being together and stop worrying about the future.",
        "Aaron: You can stop worrying about the future, okay? I'm just getting started.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Aaron: I have a question for you. Is it true that you slept with Chris Hughes the night before our wedding?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Aaron: Is that why you were a no-show at our wedding rehearsal?",
        "Alison: Why would you even ask me that?",
        "Aaron: So, you're not denying it?",
        "Alison: I just -- I can't believe what I'm hearing, that's all. Where is this coming from?",
        "Aaron: You know, I saw you with you ex at the Lakeview. And when you left, I had a conversation with Chris.",
        "Alison: What did he say?",
        "Aaron: He said that you two had sex during our wedding rehearsal. Now either Chris Hughes is lying, and I'm going to have to beat his face in for this, or you've been lying ever since we said I do. So, which is it?",
        "Alison: Chris wasn't lying, Aaron. We slept together before the wedding. Oh God, Aaron. I'm so sorry.",
        "Aaron: It's a little late for that, don't you think?",
        "Alison: Aaron! Aaron, please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I can't even begin to tell you how many laws you've broken. Obstructing several police investigations, perpetrating a fraud, by staging your own death -- I mean you're looking at multiple felonies.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I broke the law, but I had no choice.",
        "Margo: What do you mean, you had no choice? You had a choice. This was premeditated. This was planned. This was perfectly executed. How did you do it? I mean, Dusty, I saw you after you died. I saw the corpse. There was an autopsy.",
        "Dusty: No, no, there was an autopsy report.",
        "Margo: All right, who was it? Who helped you? Somebody helped you. I mean, aside from all the people who were suspected of or even accused of killing you. Evan Walsh confessed to your murder. How did you pull that off?",
        "Dusty: Evan Walsh. He did try to kill me, but I was a step ahead of him. I replaced the lethal injection he was going to give me with a new designer drug.",
        "Margo: What new designer drug?",
        "Dusty: Well, it simulates death -- stops your heart, your muscles go into rigor mortis. I was in a deep coma. And then I was given an antidote.",
        "Margo: Who gave you the antidote, Dusty? Who?",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry. I can't. I can't implicate other people.",
        "Margo: Fine. I'm going to just let you sit here and think about this. I'm going to compile a list of all of your crimes, and I think when you look at the hard time you're going to do, well, you're going to wish you were dead again.",
        "Holden: At least the Margo can't arrest you for keeping Dusty's secret.",
        "Meg: I never dreamed he would just show up.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, it's typical of Dusty say one thing, then do the exact opposite.",
        "Lily: You knew?",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: Dusty was alive, and you didn't tell me?",

        "Margo: I want you to call Memorial, get a copy of the autopsy report of Dusty Donovan. And a list of all personnel who were working on his case.",
        "Dusty: You look good.",
        "Emily: You bastard! I'm the one who found your body. I thought it was my fault. I was a suspect in your murder. And so were Lily and Holden. You make us all think you were dead, and then you just waltz into the party tonight. Sorry, just kidding!",
        "Dusty: I had to do it. I had to do it! I couldn't let Craig know I was out there looking for my son. You understand?",
        "Emily: Was it worth it? Did you find him? Did you find your son?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Emily: No, so you put us all through hell for nothing?",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: You're sorry? You're sorry? You know what? Sorry doesn't cut it! I walked in the room, you weren't breathing. I tried to revive you. I thought you were gone. Oh, God. I thought I was never going to see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Dusty made me promise not to tell anyone that he was alive. And I gave him my word.",
        "Lily: What about you? Since when have you ever cared what Dusty wanted?",
        "Holden: Lily, you're right. I didn't want you to know. With all the problems we've had, I didn't want Dusty to come between us. I didn't want to risk it.",
        "Lily: We promised we would never lie to each other again!",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sorry. I'm not in any position to make any demands at all, will you forgive me?",
        "Lily: I'm don't know if I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How could you?",
        "Chris: I didn't mean for it to come out like that.",
        "Alison: You ruined the one thing I was counting on to turn my life around.",
        "Alison: Your destroyed my marriage. Are you happy?",
        "Chris: I never wanted to hurt you.",
        "Alison: Well, you did. And if I ever, ever had feelings for you, they're gone now. I will hate you for this!",
