        "Mike: The guy's amazing. Remember the idea I had for putting the hydraulics underneath the exercise floor?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: I found out how much it would cost. Outrageous. He doesn't care. Anything for Katie.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but I didn't ask for that.",
        "Mike: I told him that. He doesn't care. He wants your show to succeed.",
        "Katie: But no pressure.",
        "Mike: Katie, he's got money to burn. And if you're happy, he's happy.",
        "Katie: Well, how about you? Are you okay working with him?",
        "Mike: So far, so good.",
        "Katie: Good, that's all that matters. So what're we going to do to celebrate our first day together?",
        "Mike: Well, since we missed lunch --",
        "Katie: We'll have to have double dessert.",
        "B.J.: Katie. You all set? Dinner on me, remember? So what's it gonna be? Chinese, Italian, French -- your pick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Well, looks like Byron got the message. K-k-k-Katie's mailbox is empty.",
        "Henry: Good.",
        "Maddie: I feel bad for the guy. He's a lonely man with very good taste in sweaters who's been pining after his high school sweetheart for almost a decade now. And I just ripped out his heart.",
        "Henry: Yes, you did. So maybe next time you decide to play fast and loose with someone else's love life, you'll think twice, won't you?",
        "Maddie: It's just -- it's unfair. Mike is undeserving.",
        "Henry: Why, Maddie, because he kicked you out? I mean, we were -- we were camped out in the guy's love nest, after all.",
        "Maddie: He accused me of following him. He said that I was invading his workspace. He needs a little bit of competition.",
        "Henry: No. No, the last thing I need is Katie on the warpath. She already tried to brain me -- nearly brained me with a bottle of Montalcino. Which reminds me, I need you to keep an eye out for any more gifts from Mr. Glass, okay? For all we know, he may have put a mink coat in the mail before we gave him the heave-ho.",
        "Maddie: And how do you suppose I do that?",
        "Henry: Well, you're an in-tern. Why don't you check her in-box?",
        "Maddie: No, nope. No, sorry. No can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, what did you do?",
        "Iris: I didn't do anything wrong. It's Carly that did. And it's coming back to bite her.",
        "Gwen: Look, mom, I just got you out of jail. Do you want to go back in? Because that's where you're headed if you pulled something dirty.",
        "Iris: Carly is the one that did something wrong, not me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah and she still has custody of my kid.",
        "Iris: Not for long. I just had a little conversation with your lawyer. And he agrees with me 100%. Remember how I told you you were gonna get your kid back today? I was right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Jack: What the hell's going on?",
        "Carly: We're leaving. You, me and the kids. We're leaving the state before they can take Rory away from us, Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I packed all the pictures, and all we have to do now is stop by the bank and make sure we close our accounts.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no. We are not going anywhere.",
        "Carly: No, you're right. We can do that on the way, can't we? Whatever you want to bring, you better do it now, because Ellen's gonna be back any minute with the kids.",
        "Jack: Honey, listen to me --",
        "Carly: I just gotta put this stuff in the car. We can talk about it on the way.",
        "Jack: No. No, I don't need to talk. We are not leaving our home.",
        "Jack: Nobody is gonna drive us from our home.",
        "Carly: Jack, please. I know it's a lot to ask. But if we stay here, they're gonna take the baby away.",
        "Jack: Honey, we always knew that there was a risk. We're just his guardians.",
        "Carly: Well, Cass Winthrop is gonna go to the judge, he then the judge will take away that guardianship.",
        "Jack: Cass Winthrop?",
        "Carly: He was just here, Jack. Iris got hold of him somehow. She told him what happened when I was a child. Now he's threatening to go to the judge. Jack, they're gonna make me take some kind of psychiatric evaluation. He said that if I don't remember every single thing that happened, that they could claim that I'm unfit and I could lose Rory and I could lose Parker and Sage!",
        "Jack: Okay, whoa, whoa. Calm down, calm down.",
        "Carly: What if the children find out? How can I tell Parker that I killed a baby? He'll hate me.",
        "Jack: No, no, he won't, honey. He won't. And he won't find out.",
        "Carly: That's right, he won't. Not if we leave town, he won't..",
        "Jack: Honey, honey, stop it, stop this, right now. Take a breath, okay?",
        "Carly: I can't. Don't you understand that Ellen's coming back with the kids any minute.",
        "Jack: All right, okay, that's why I don't want them to see you like this. So you have got to calm down.",
        "Carly: What if Iris goes to the judge?",
        "Jack: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be just fine. Come here. All right. Hey, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? Just calm down. We'll figure out a way. We always do.",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Okay?",
        "Carly: 'Cause I have this feeling this time, Jack. And I can't shake it. I had this feeling that this time I may have run out of rope.",
        "Jack: That's why you've got me.",
        "Carly: What if Hannah was right? What if by digging around in my father's past, trying to find out the truth, what if -- what if it means we could lose everything?",
        "Jack: We haven't lost anything yet, all right? And we're not going to.",
        "Carly: What if Iris comes after us?",
        "Jack: We'll fight back. Don't forget, we're not alone. We've got a lot of friends in this town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So you told Cass, but you won't tell me.",
        "Iris: Cass Winthrop is a lawyer. They can't ask him any questions. You see, that's what's called client-attorney privilege.",
        "Gwen: No, I know what it's called.",
        "Iris: That's right, you always had a pretty sharp brain. And a suspicious nature, thanks to me. And in this world we live in, it's a good thing. Because nobody can pull the wool over your eyes.",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm, including you, Mom.",
        "Iris: Look, I told you, honey, I don't want you involved, okay. Because if they ask questions, then you don't know anything.",
        "Gwen: So, basically, what you're doing is illegal.",
        "Iris: Sweetie pie, do you think that your lawyer would be talking to me if what I was doing wasn't legal?",
        "Gwen: How do you know he's not talking to Jack right now, who happens to be a cop, so --?",
        "Iris: Yeah. And you think that makes him honest? I think the sooner you learn that, the better.",
        "Gwen: If I lose my kid because of you --",
        "Iris: Would you just trust me? Just this once?",
        "Gwen: Why should I?",
        "Iris: I just spent the night in jail for you, Gwennie. For you and your son. You know, maybe when you hold him in your arms, you'll be able to just let that past go and we could all have a second chance. Oh, honey. I want you to be so happy. And I want us to be a family. You, me and my grandson.",
        "Gwen: Let's just try to get through the day without getting arrested. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: The only reason why I still have this job is because I promised Katie that I would stay out of her personal life. If they find me digging in her mailbox, I'm history. And then that means that I can't save enough money to get you an apartment, and you will be living in the limo for the rest of your life.",
        "Henry: But -- I don't you worry about me. I will get an apartment.",
        "Maddie: When? With what? You haven't had a fare in two hours.",
        "Henry: You who have not been reading the little sister manual, have you? I'm the one who takes care of you. And if I fail to manage to do that, then you should not remind me.",
        "Maddie: You are the greatest big brother a girl can have.",
        "Henry: Well, yeah. So I've been told.",
        "Maddie: I wouldn't worry about Byron. Now that Katie isn't e-mailing him anymore, I'm sure he called off the wine and roses.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you're probably right. I mean, what kind of guy goes after a woman who's forgotten he even exists? Right. I mean, what kind of guy goes after a woman who's forgotten he even exists?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Dinner? Tonight?",
        "B.J.: To discuss the show.",
        "Katie: Oh! Oh, man, I'm sorry. I totally forgot. And Mike and I have plans. What about tomorrow morning? I'll meet you here first thing, we'll have breakfast.",
        "B.J.: Sure. Sure. I just wanted to get this all figured out faster.",
        "Mike: No, it was my fault. I had planned sort of celebration, this being our first day of work together.",
        "B.J.: All right. Well, that's perfect. Then you share that bottle of Montalcino I gave you. Are you a wine lover, Mike?",
        "Katie: Wait. Wait a second. You sent me that bottle?",
        "Mike: When was this?",
        "Katie: This morning. I didn't have a chance to tell you yet.",
        "Katie: It's an incredibly expensive bottle of wine.",
        "B.J.: An incredible expensive bottle of wine that you deserve.",
        "Mike: You do deserve it. I've gotta catch the electrician before she disappears.",
        "B.J.: So you like the wine.",
        "Katie: Absolutely, it's a lovely gift, but -- I'm wondering, how did you know?",
        "B.J.: Know?",
        "Katie: About the vineyard. The town is an incredibly special place to me.",
        "B.J.: I didn't. I just like the wine. But then I guess there're no accidents. I liked your video, and here we are. I guess we're just destined, Katie.",
        "Katie: Okay, that's it. You and I need to talk.",
        "Katie: Mike and I aren't just casually dating. We're together. We live together. We're in love.",
        "B.J.: Good for you. Oh. You thought that -- Katie, I'm sorry. I mean, you're an incredibly beautiful woman, but all I meant is you and I are going to make a lot of money together, that we're destined in business. That's all. I mean, if we end up being great friends through all this, then that's just icing on the cake. You know? But I am here to make you a success and me another fortune, and that's all.",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, that' good stuff there. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. And I'm really embarrassed.",
        "B.J.: No, no, no. It's okay. It's cute.",
        "Katie: Cute?",
        "B.J.: Yeah. It's cute that you would defend Mike like that, even thought Mike doesn't need it at all. It show what a sweetheart you are.",
        "Katie: Well, you know what it is? I was just in a situation where I sent mixed signals and I really wanted to make absolute sure that I never do that again.",
        "B.J.: So, what happened?",
        "Katie: Oh, it's a long boring story.",
        "B.J.: Oh, Katie, there's nothing boring about you. Okay? So, you think it's gonna maybe make you feel better to talk about it, you know you can talk to me anytime. I'm all ears.",
        "Mike: We can tap off the main line.",
        "Katie: I should get going. I have an errand to run.",
        "Mike: Meet you at home?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'll call you.",
        "B.J.: Wow. So I'd venture to guess you've been in love with her for a long time.",
        "Mike: You blame me?",
        "B.J.: No, I don't.",
        "Mike: We're gonna hook up a temporary circuit, so --",
        "B.J.: So do you guys plan on tying the knot any time soon? I only ask because I'm planning on a shooting schedule, and I can stockpile tape you're planning a honeymoon.",
        "Mike: We'll let you know.",
        "B.J.: But it's somewhere on the horizon, close, yes?",
        "Mike: How about you, B.J.? Anyone special?",
        "B.J.: Oh, yeah. I've been in love with her since high school. And you know what they say, you never really get over your first love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Bye-bye, Byron Glass. It is over. Now Katie is free to be with the man of her dreams.",
        "Maddie: Depends how you look at it.",
        "Henry: It's not me. I'm not the man of her dreams. She can't trust me anymore, and that was always what we had --- she could come to me with anything anytime, it didn't matter what. And now I'm lucky to get a chaperone to visit with snickers.",
        "Maddie: I'm just going to tell her that it was me, that I was e-mailing Byron, pretending to be --",
        "Henry: You're going to lose your job. No.",
        "Maddie: But you're losing your one true love.",
        "Henry: And that's a good thing. I can start over and who knows, you know? Maybe I'll find a best friend that I'm not in love with. Maybe even a girl who thinks I'm the bee's knees.",
        "Maddie: The bee's knees?",
        "Henry: Don't you have work to do?",
        "[Maddie gasps]",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God. I totally forgot. I have to deliver this package to the station and get coffee. Oh, but listen -- you are the bee's knees and the monkey's uncle and you will find her. She is out there. I know it.",
        "Henry: Monkey's uncle. She's out there. She just doesn't give a damn. Excuse me.",
        "Katie: Wait. I apologize. I never should have accused you of sending me that wine, especially since I didn't know for sure. But after the flowers and the sweater, I just thought --",
        "Henry: Apology accepted. Is there anything else you need?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I want us to be friends again. I miss you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So I take it this isn't about raking leaves.",
        "Tom: Ah. Our new houseguest. Now you may have seen her around. She's a pretty brunette with a killer sense of humor. Watch yourself.",
        "Casey: What're you talking about?",
        "Tom: After the incident with Gwen, I think you should just watch yourself.",
        "Casey: I don't believe it. You still think I got her pregnant, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Oh, and I'm gonna stop by the mall, and get some onesies --",
        "Gwen: You know what? Don't stop and get anything until we know for sure.",
        "Iris: You want kid going around in dishtowels, your party.",
        "Gwen: I don't have any dishtowels.",
        "Iris: Which is why I'm here. See, you need someone to organize this stuff.",
        "Gwen: Look, we don't even know if Cass has talked to the judge yet.",
        "Iris: Honey, of course Cass has. You gotta have faith. It's like -- I don't know, bringing tartar sauce to a fishing hole. You know, you gotta believe.",
        "Gwen: I'll believe it when I see it.",
        "Iris: Oh, that's just like you in a nutshell. You know, I couldn't ever promise you anything, you just had to have it right in your hand.",
        "Gwen: Well, I wonder why.",
        "Iris: No. No, no, no, no. You're not gonna rain on my parade, because my grandson's coming home today. Oh, you know what? It reminds me. I've got some baby-proof my house, 'cause first thing tomorrow, you and my grandson are coming for breakfast.",
        "Gwen: Please don't cook.",
        "Iris: Oh, you see, now that's positive thinking.",
        "Gwen: No. No. [Knock on door] Will.",
        "Will: I should have called.",
        "Gwen: No, I was just not expecting you.",
        "Will: I was in the neighborhood, and I figured I'd stop by.",
        "Gwen: Since when are you ever in this neighborhood?",
        "Will: I just wanted to see how you were doing.",
        "Gwen: I didn't get to ask you at Java. How's your sister?",
        "Will: She's better. They released her.",
        "Gwen: Good.",
        "Will: So, what did you ever find out about Carly?",
        "Gwen: What about her?",
        "Will: A little while ago, you were worried that she was headed for Switzerland.",
        "Gwen: Oh. No. I think you're right. She was just yanking my chain. The thing is? I am expecting someone.",
        "Will: Oh. I'll get out of your way.",
        "Gwen: No, Will, it's not like that. I think my baby's coming home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Thanks for coming, Jess.",
        "Carly: You can help us keep the baby, right? They can't just take him away.",
        "Jessica: I'm gonna do what I can, Carly, I have to be honest. If the truth comes out, if the judge learns about your involvement with the Dumbrowski case, there's a very real possibility that he'll revoke guardianship, and transfer custody to the mother.",
        "Carly: Rosanna is the mother.",
        "Jessica: And she's incapacitated.",
        "Jack: Okay, given the fact that Carly was a child, there charges were no charges brought, why is this even an issue now?",
        "Jessica: Times have changed, Jack. These days, children are often charged if there's a death involved. Not that you're in any jeopardy, Carly. But since we raised the question Gwen's fitness as a parent, she's challenging you on the same grounds.",
        "Carly: But it's just Iris's word against mine.",
        "Jack: What about the fact that Iris was blackmailing her?",
        "Carly: And that Cass Winthrop stood in this very room and he threatened me?",
        "Jessica: Cass Winthrop is an aggressive attorney. And at most, he'll be admonished. As for Iris, that's a separate issue. In any event, the police records speak for themselves.",
        "Carly: So you're saying that Cass was right. That even though the records were sealed, the judge can open them if he wants to?",
        "Jessica: In cases involving a child, there's no such thing as a sealed record. I really wish I could make this go away for you, Carly, but in the likelihood that I can't? We have to be prepare to respond to the original complaint.",
        "Carly: The original complaint. Well, Iris accused me of killing her baby. If the judge sees that --",
        "Jack: No, honey, he won't see it.",
        "Carly: What do you mean, he won't see it? You just heard what Jessica said --",
        "Jack: Okay, it's not gonna be a problem.",
        "Jessica: Jack, you put the records back after I gave them to you, right?",
        "Carly: You saw the records, Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I saw the records.",
        "Jessica: Jack, answer my question.",
        "Jack: No, I didn't put the records back.",
        "Jessica: Then I think you should hand them over to me right now.",
        "Jack: I can't do that.",
        "Jessica: Why not?",
        "Carly: It's okay. I'll tell the judge everything. You can put me on the stand, I'll tell him everything that I remember. And as for what I can't remember, I'm sure that Iris will be more than enough to testify --",
        "Jack: Honey, it's gonna be okay. It okay.",
        "Carly: Jack, it isn't. It is not okay.",
        "Jack: Jessica, I destroyed the records.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Henry: Kim Hughes sent you a bottle of Montalcino?",
        "Katie: No, not Kim. Our new partner at the station. His name's B.J. Green.",
        "Henry: You said B.J. Green?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I could lose Parker, Sage, J.J. --",
        "Jack: Jessica, please --",
        "Jessica: Don't look at me. You broke the law.",
        "Jack: Okay, fine, then arrest me. All right? But right now, I need you to help my wife.",
        "Gwen: If she's playing me, or worse, if she's done something illegal and I lose my kid -- I don't know what I'll do. I'll end up alone, just like I was before.",
        "Will: No, you won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You destroyed police records? I'm sorry, Detective, what's the penalty for tampering?",
        "Carly: He just did to protect me --",
        "Jessica: That doesn't matter. He's an officer of the law, sworn by an oath. Jack, I trusted you. When I gave you those records, you promised me you'd put them back.",
        "Jack: I know. I am very sorry.",
        "Jessica: You have made me an accessory. I could lose my license, I could go to jail.",
        "Jack: When I read those records,I couldn't put them back. I had no other choice, Jessica.",
        "Carly: Why? Because you didn't want me to see it? All this time I was hoping that it was a mistake. Or an accident, or that Iris was lying, but you saw the records, Jack. And it's true. I killed that baby.",
        "Jack: Honey, listen, you were just a child, Carly.",
        "Carly: Sometimes children do terrible things. You heard Jessica. These days they're even charged for it.",
        "Jack: Look that is not gonna happen.",
        "Carly: But I could lose Rory. I could lose Parker, sage, J.J.",
        "Jack: Jessica, please --",
        "Jessica: Don't look at me, you broke the law.",
        "Jack: Okay, fine, then arrest me. All right? But right now, I need you to help my wife.",
        "Jessica: We're not having this conversation.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Understood.",
        "Jessica: You're instinct to protect Carly. It would've worked. If there hadn't been other copies.",
        "Carly: What do you mean? What?",

        "Will: You got custody -- that's amazing. I mean, it's great. Congratulations. So who's bringing him over? Jack and Carly? No wonder you're not worried about Switzerland anymore. So I guess your mom really came through for you after all.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we'll see.",
        "Will: When did all this happen?",
        "Gwen: My mom talked to my lawyer earlier today.",
        "Will: And he talked to the judge?",
        "Gwen: I don't really have any of the details. It's just that my mom said she had something on Carly and when she told my lawyer, he thought they'd bring the baby by tonight.",
        "Will: So you don't have to go to court?",
        "Gwen: I told you, I don't have any of the details. What?",

        "Gwen: But you don't think it will.",
        "Will: Gwen, what do I know? Look, you've got a lawyer. It's what he's there for, it's why you're paying him, so I'm sure he'll let you know where you stand.",
        "Gwen: You think my mother's playing me?",
        "Will: All I know is what you've told me about how it was growing up.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but she's not drinking now. At least not in front of me. I don't know.",
        "Will: So, what'd she tell you she had on Carly?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. But she's pretty cocky, so it's gotta be something big. If she's playing me, or worse, if she's done something illegal and I lose my kid, I don't know what I'll do. I'll end up alone, just like I was before.",

        "Tom: Well, she's a pretty girl.",
        "Casey: She's an alien. Half the time she opens her mouth,I don't have a clue what she's saying.",
        "Tom: It wouldn't be because you're staring at her eyes, would it?",
        "Casey: Hell, no. I mean, no. No, it wouldn't. Look, you don't have to worry about me and Maddie. She's not my type.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Casey: And I know that Mom promised Aunt Katie that Maddie could stay with us, but I've gotta be honest with you, I am counting the days till she's gone. Why do you think I've been holed up in my room so long? The only time when I come out is when she's asleep.",
        "Tom: Okay, I'm sorry it's been such a hardship.",
        "Casey: It's even worse at school. She's in, like, half my classes.",
        "Tom: Hey, sorry, she's smart.",
        "Casey: She's too smart. Everything I say, she's got an answer.",
        "Tom: Oh, kind of like Mom.",
        "Casey: No, she's nothing like Mom. She's obnoxious.",
        "Tom: Look, okay, then how about you just try and be polite because she's new in town?",
        "Casey: Now, let me get this straight -- you want me to stay away from her, but I'm supposed to show her around? Make up your mind, Dad.",
        "Tom: Oh, I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.",
        "Casey: Yeah, fine. I'll be polite. All right? And Fad, you don't have to worry. If I get the urge to be with a girl, it won't be with Maddie.",

        "B.J.: Never got over her. Of course, back then she didn't even know I was alive.",
        "Mike: And now?",
        "B.J.: Well, I'm a patient man. Besides, I'm a little busy these days.",
        "Mike: I'd say.",
        "B.J.: Beside, you know, I don't really want to overwhelm her. There're not a lot of guys who can afford to retire before the age of 30. I don't want to come on too strong.",
        "Mike: Well, if she's anything like Katie, that'll bring her right to you.",
        "B.J.: That's good to know. I should get back to the hotel.",
        "Mike: I didn't even think those were out in the stores yet.",
        "B.J.: Oh, they're not. The manufacturer sent it over. You follow technology?",
        "Mike: I mean, I'm always looking for something new. Oh, man, this is amazing.",
        "B.J.: Thanks. I invented it.",
        "Mike: You invented it?",
        "B.J.: Yeah. Well, I hold a couple of patents. It guess it pays to be a geek in high school. I should really get back to the hotel. No, no, no, keep it. Please.",
        "Mike: No, no, no, I can't keep this.",
        "B.J.: Yes, you can. I have box full of them at the hotel, so -- it's fine.",
        "Mike: Thank you. I owe you one.",

        "Katie: Henry, you are my best friend, and I know I've hurt you and confused you and I have no right to ask this, but life's just not the same without you.",
        "Henry: Life is never the same, Katie, it's always changing.",
        "Katie: So, let's be that constant for each other. What do you say -- can we try and be friends?",
        "Henry: You don't trust me anymore. I mean, come on, I'm sure you still think I'm the one that sent you that bottle of --",
        "Katie: No, I really don't. I found out who sent the wine.",
        "Henry: You did?",
        "Katie: Yeah. My boss.",
        "Henry: Kim Hughes sent you a bottle of Montalcino?",
        "Katie: No, not Kim. Her new partner at the station. His name's B.J. Green. He's the reason I'm back at WOAK. He wanted to revive the butt buster.",
        "Henry: You said B.J. Green?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you've probably read about him in the papers. He's this big dot commer. He made, like, a billion dollars before the whole business went bust, but anyway he's investing in me.",
        "Henry: Why would a guy that you just met send you a bottle of Montalcino, circa 1993?",
        "Katie: I don't know, so I asked him that same question, and he just said that he really likes the wine. I guess that's just a coincidence.",
        "Henry: Huh.",
        "Katie: So, anyway, can we be friends again? I mean, your rules. Whatever you need.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Really?",

        "Katie: Great. Well, I just thought, I don't know, a couple of minutes ago, you were ready to write me off.",
        "Henry: Well, maybe I'm just a big bunny at heart. Besides, who could live without k-k-k-Katie, hmm?",
        "Katie: That's what they used to call me in high school. You remember everything. So we'll talk. I gotta go back to work. I'll call you. Thank you for forgiving me.",

        "Tom: It's not a problem, we are happy to have you.",
        "Maddie: But your son hates me. Not that I care. It's just kind of awkward. I mean, every time I come out of my room, he slams the door.",
        "Tom: Well, Casey's been kind of through a rough time lately. So I trust that you will keep this to yourself, but ever since the incident with Gwen, he's been a little gun-shy around pretty girls.",

        "Will: Yeah, well, we were both a little outta control. It's okay. It happens. You know, the important thing is that, you know, we can talk about it.",
        "Gwen: Just know that I like you just the way you are. You know, you don't have to change anything. There's nothing wrong with you that a new haircut wouldn't fix.",

        "Jessica: For the moment.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Jessica: At least I was able to delay proceedings. Both sides will have to submit briefs, appear before the judge. It could take a few days.",
        "Jack: Okay, then what?",
        "Jessica: Then, we keep our fingers crossed. Hey, who knows, I might be able to get something going on this trust issue. That Cass Winthrop's not cheap. And he's not going to want another delay, especially if it's gonna jeopardize his fee.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Jessica: Again, I'm not making any promises. But if I can get the judge to exclude the records, if Cass begins to think that this isn't worth his time, and if nothing else rocks the boat -- you may be able to keep that baby after all.",
