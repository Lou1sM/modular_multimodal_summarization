        "Will: Hey. ",
        "Gwen: Hey. Where were you? ",
        "Will: Started the fire up again. There's still no power. ",
        "Gwen: I smell coffee. You made coffee? ",
        "Will: Well, you've got to know, I'm going to be on my best behavior. ",
        "Gwen: You might want to rethink that. You make terrible coffee. ",
        "Will: You never said that. ",
        "Gwen: Well, things are different now. You know, the cards are on the table. I \r\ndon't want us faking any of this, Will. ",
        "Will: Well, I'm not faking. I'm happy. ",
        "Gwen: That is nice, Will. ",
        "Will: It's so quiet. I woke up, and I could hear the ice melting off the \r\ntrees. I could hear you breathe. ",
        "Gwen: You know, maybe you were right. ",
        "Will: That, you've never said. ",
        "Gwen: Maybe if we decide to be happy, you know maybe it's just as real as \r\nanything else. ",
        "Will: I want to make you believe that. ",
        "",
        "Holden: Do you know how many times I walked into this room, praying to see \r\nwhat I see right now? I have to tell you, your mom, she's been wonderful through \r\nall this, and I'm not just saying that to make you happy. You know what she did? \r\nShe took the kids to breakfast. I guess that gives us a little time alone. Do \r\nyou know how much I missed that smile? Lily? What is it? Are you all right? ",
        "[Lily sees a vision of Rose]",
        "Lily: You said someone was missing? ",
        "Rose: I asked you to take care of somebody, Lily. And you didn't listen. ",

        "Nurse #4: Okay, here we go. Oh, that's a good boy. Okay? ",
        "Lucy: Johnny will be fine, he's in good hands. ",
        "Dusty: We were talking about your father, remember? ",
        "Lucy: I know. And I told you. I didn't know he was out of prison, I didn't \r\nknow anything. But you look like you don't believe me. ",
        "Dusty: No, I believe that. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks for the vote of confidence. ",
        "Dusty: I think you're avoiding the question. What are you going to do now \r\nthat he's back? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I better get this right, huh? Because Dusty Donovan is poised and \r\nready to tell me whether I'm right or wrong. ",
        "Dusty: Well, I do think there's a right or a wrong answer, don't you? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know what I'm going to do, how's that for an answer? I don't \r\nhave a clue. ",
        "Dusty: Okay. Let me know when you find out. ",
        "Lucy: Sure. You know, just don't hold your breath. ",
        "",
        "Paul: Of all the people on the planet that I don't want to see today, of all \r\ndays. ",
        "Craig: I heard what you said just now. ",
        "Paul: What are you doing here? ",
        "Craig: Well, when a tree falls on you, this seems like the place to come. And \r\nI did hear what you said. I am sorry. ",
        "Paul: Look, the place is all yours. ",
        "Craig: I know what it's like to lose a child. I know what you're going \r\nthrough, and I am truly sorry for your loss. ",
        "Paul: You go to hell. ",
        "Craig: Too much, too soon. ",
        "Paul: You know, Craig, when I asked you why you were here, I wasn't talking \r\nabout the hospital chapel. Let me be more specific -- why are you not rotting in \r\njail? ",
        "Craig: I was released. ",
        "Paul: You were released? ",
        "Craig: The state felt that I paid my debt to society -- ",
        "Paul: You paid nothing. ",
        "Craig: Oh, I have, and I still am. ",
        "Paul: You want me to feel sorry for you? ",
        "Craig: No. ",
        "Paul: Because that is never going to happen. You know what I think, Craig? I \r\nthink you killed my sister. ",
        "Craig: What? ",
        "Paul: Because Jennifer's disease, all that weakness inside of her, that all \r\nstarted because of the pain and suffering that you caused. ",
        "Craig: I know that you think that I caused every problem in the world -- ",
        "Paul: You took her child from her. And you have the nerve to sit there and \r\ntell me what feels like to lose a kid, and you deliberately inflicted that pain \r\non my sister! ",
        "Craig: Go ahead. Therapeutic. ",
        "Paul: You know what, Craig? You're not worth it. ",
        "Craig: I heard you say you lost your baby as some kind of punishment -- ",
        "Paul: Okay, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it would be more therapeutic -- ",
        "Craig: I went through that. You're not going to like this much, but I am the \r\nperson in this world who can really understand what you've been through. ",
        "Paul: Why are you saying all this? ",
        "Craig: We've done such terrible things that we think we deserve the terrible \r\nthings that happen to us. Well, that's one way of looking at it. ",
        "Paul: Thank you for your insight. ",
        "Craig: The problem is -- all that grief and atoning -- it's a kind of denial. \r\nI mean, I bet you even think you're being sincere, but you're not. You don't \r\nthink you deserved what happened to you anymore than you think you're just as \r\nresponsible for Jennifer's pain as I was. But you were. ",

        "Margo: Here's a list of missing persons. Check it against your admits. \r\nThanks. Dusty, I heard that Johnny\u2019s going to be fine. That's great news. ",
        "Dusty: It's not going to work. You can't parlay what he did to turn him into \r\nsome kind of hero. ",
        "Margo: What are you talking about --? ",
        "Dusty: Craig's PR people -- ",
        "Margo: Craig, my brother? ",
        "Dusty: Craig, your brother, escaped from jail. He's in Oakdale. ",
        "Margo: No, that's impossible. ",
        "Dusty: See for yourself. He's here in the hospital. ",
        "Margo: He's here? ",
        "Dusty: I found him with my son in his lap. A real bonding moment. ",
        "Margo: Where'd you see him? ",
        "Dusty: I'll show you. It'll be a pleasure. ",
        "Dusty: What a surprise, he's not here. ",
        "Margo: How long ago was this? ",
        "Dusty: Twenty minutes, half hour. He probably just wheeled right out of here.\r\n",
        "Margo: Wheeled? He was in a wheelchair? ",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh, poor baby. Getting a lot of sympathy. Just the way he likes \r\nit. ",
        "Margo: The thing is, if he was on the run, this isn't really the shrewdest \r\nplace to hide out, is it? ",
        "Dusty: Unless he wants to get Lucy's help. ",
        "Margo: Or unless maybe -- and I don't know how, but just maybe he's \r\nlegitimately released from prison. ",
        "Dusty: Without you or Lucy knowing about it. One of those spur-of-the-moment \r\nreleases? ",
        "Margo: You know, really, I know you're upset about this, but can I have a \r\nminute to think. ",
        "Dusty: I'll give you a minute to call Tom. To find out what Craig did to get \r\nout of prison, and what it's going to take to send him back. ",
        "Margo: Hey, Betty, yeah, it's me. I need to talk to Tom. Well, I'm sorry, you \r\nhave to interrupt him. It's urgent. ",

        "Luke: Well, are you okay? Because you know, the roads are open. ",
        "Jade: Yeah, but I can't get in touch with Will. ",
        "Luke: And you can't get home on your own because -- ",

        "Luke: Right. Sorry. I'm glad your baby's all right. ",

        "Lily: I don't know -- I don't know if Bob agrees with you on that. He said I \r\nneed some more tests before I can get out of here. ",
        "Holden: Well, the tests are just to make sure that you're okay. It's just a \r\nformality. ",

        "Margo: The law goes by what he can prove. ",

        "Craig: I was set up, betrayed. And you just watched. And maybe I could let \r\nthat go, hey, what's a little prison time? But you want me to ignore the \r\nundeniable fact that when I was fighting for my child, you did nothing to help \r\nme? You let them slander me, knowing what was at stake. You did nothing to help \r\nme -- I've had a lot of time alone. I've had a lot of time to think. ",

Family. \r\nYou don't think I know what's waiting for me here? Oh, I've already had a very \r\nspecial welcome. But I don't care. I'm here for only one reason, and that is \r\nfamily.
