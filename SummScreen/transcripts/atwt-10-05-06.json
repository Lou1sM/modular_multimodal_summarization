        "Lily: No, no, no. Look, I need to do this, okay? You and I were on the \r\nstairs. We were on the stairs at home. You were angry with me. Why were you so \r\nangry with me? ",

        "Lily: I was reaching out to you, and you -- you pushed me away. That's why I \r\nfell down the stairs. Why? Luke, why? ",

        "Barbara: There's my boy. ",
        "Dusty: What about this boy? ",
        "Barbara: Hello to you, too. Well, he looks pretty good, in spite of being \r\nkidnapped, huh? Hi, honey. ",
        "Dusty: Lucy did not kidnap Johnny. ",
        "Barbara: She took him without my permission. ",
        "Dusty: Johnny had a bad fever. ",
        "Barbara: Well, I know everything worked out okay. But you know what? It could \r\nhave been pretty awful. It was a nasty night last night. What if she'd had a car \r\naccident, where Johnny would have been then? ",
        "Dusty: She did have a car accident. ",
        "Barbara: What? But you're okay? ",

        "Craig: I'll bet that's not a compliment. ",
        "Margo: The only reason you came back here is because you want Johnny. ",
        "Craig: Much as I might want that, it would be very disruptive. He's happy and \r\nhealthy. And obviously, he's bonded with Dusty. ",
        "Margo: And that just burns you, doesn't it? ",
        "Craig: I'm just glad he's being well taken care of. ",
        "Margo: Could you be glad from a distance? ",
        "Craig: I was just making sure that my son was all right. ",
        "Margo: He is not your son! He's another man's son. And you took him out of \r\nhis room without even notifying Dusty. ",
        "Craig: Do you think Dusty would have given me two seconds with my boy? ",
        "Margo: Oh, probably not, after what you did. ",
        "Craig: You know, Margo, you're my sister. Could you at least pretend to care \r\nmore about me than Dusty Donovan? ",
        "Margo: Oh, I care about you -- ",
        "Craig: That boy is my flesh and blood! I haven't seen him or held him since \r\nhe was born -- ",
        "Margo: Everybody knows what you did. You switched babies. You broke the law. \r\nI mean, there's an injunction against you. You're not supposed to be within 30 \r\nfeet of Johnny. ",
        "Craig: Well, then it's a good thing that I took the opportunity when I did. \r\nI'll probably not get another one. ",
        "Margo: Stay away from that baby. ",
        "Craig: Could you? If it was your son, Margo, if you weren't allowed to see or \r\ntalk to Casey for over a year, and you had maybe even a chance for two seconds \r\nto spend with him -- tell me you'd stay away. ",

        "Margo: What you did -- ",
        "Craig: Was wrong. I was wrong. I didn't want to lose my son. ",
        "Margo: How'd that work out for you then? Because you did lose your son. \r\nAnother man is raising him. You went to prison. What did it get you? ",
        "Craig: It taught me. That I don't want to lose you, too. I need you. And \r\nKatie and Lucy, now more than ever. So, can you forget what I've done long \r\nenough to --? ",

        "Jade: You stayed here last night? I thought you and Casey would be cuddled up \r\nin the dorms. ",
        "Gwen: My car went into a ditch just down the road, and Will spotted me and he \r\ntried to get the engine started, but he couldn\u2019t. So, I stayed here. ",
        "Jade: Oh. I guess that's better than sitting out in the cold and freezing to \r\ndeath. Even if you two are having problems. ",
        "Gwen: Yep. ",
        "Will: But it turned out to be a lucky break. Because last night gave Gwen and \r\nme a chance to finally talk and make some decisions. Good decisions. ",
        "Gwen: It's true. We had a chance to figure some things out last night. And \r\none of those things is that we don't have to be at each other's throats all the \r\ntime. Which is good for everybody. Right, Will? ",
        "Will: Well, there's a little more to it than that. ",
        "Gwen: How are the roads? ",
        "Jade: It's getting warmer. The ice is melting. ",
        "Gwen: Great. I have to get Casey\u2019s car to him. Where's my purse? ",
        "Jade: I was so worried about our baby during the storm. The pile-up on the \r\ninterstate was a nightmare, Will. You would not believe how many people had to \r\ngo to the hospital. It took them forever to check me out. I was just trying not \r\nto panic the whole time. Oh -- ",
        "Will: What? ",
        "Jade: My prenatal vitamins. I forgot to take them. I think I left them in the \r\nbedroom. Would you get them for me? ",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. ",
        "Jade: I am so paranoid about taking those vitamins and eating right. The \r\ndoctors keep saying that the first trimester is so important. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah. ",
        "Jade: You know, but there are some women who think they don't need to take \r\ncare of themselves, but then it's the baby who suffers. Gwen, I'm sorry. That \r\njust came out. ",
        "Gwen: You used to be a lot more subtle. Maybe that's why I never saw it. ",
        "Jade: What? ",
        "Gwen: How much you wanted my husband. ",
        "Jade: I want my baby to be healthy. I'm sure you can understand that, Gwen.\r\n",
        "Gwen: Of course. ",
        "Will: Gwen? This was under the bed. ",
        "Gwen: Thank you. Good-bye. ",
        "Jade: Thanks. So, you gave Gwen the bed? I guess you must have sacked out on \r\nthe couch, huh? ",
        "Will: Jade -- ",
        "Jade: You know, the woman -- this woman in the hospital, she said the \r\nfunniest thing to me. She took one look at me and she said, \"You must be having \r\na boy.\" Isn't that amazing? Wouldn't it be amazing if I did? What do you want? \r\nDo you want a boy or a girl? ",
        "Will: I'll be right back. ",
        "Will: You're not gone. ",
        "Gwen: No, I will be. I have to call Casey about the car. ",

        "Gwen: Last night was a dream, Will. And then Jade walked in, and guess what? \r\nI woke up. ",

        "Craig: Casey, if you want to talk about this -- ",
        "Casey: Oh, now you want to talk? Now? What about back when you switched \r\nGwen's baby? Why didn't you say something then? Or why didn't you tell her, \r\nGwen, that her baby was dead? ",
        "Margo: Come on, Casey, keep it down. It's a hospital. ",
        "Casey: I don't care! This guy's a criminal! And they just let him out like -- \r\nlike what he did doesn't even matter. ",

        "Margo: Casey, please. ",
        "Casey: No, Mom. You were there, he wasn\u2019t. You saw how much it hurt Gwen to \r\ngive Johnny back. And she never even got to hold her baby! She's still not over \r\nit, Mom. She never will be. And neither will I. ",

        "Craig: Casey, if you'd just let me explain this -- ",
        "Casey: Save your explanation. I don't have to listen to you anymore. The day \r\nyou switched those babies was the day that you stopped being my uncle. You mean \r\nnothing to me now. Less than that. ",
        "Craig: Margo? I am sorry for what happened to Gwen. ",
        "Margo: You say that like it was an accident. You did it to her, Craig. You \r\nhurt people. You destroyed people. And that doesn't go away just because you \r\nwant things to be better. ",
        "Craig: What's the alternative? You write me off? ",
        "Margo: I want to. I want to. But I won\u2019t. ",
        "Craig: Thanks. ",
        "Margo: Don't thank me. Listen to me. The hurt that you caused can't be wiped \r\naway, no matter what the court says. So, if you want my forgiveness, you don't \r\nmake the same mistake twice. You stay away from Johnny. ",

        "Barbara: She could have called the police and have Craig arrested. ",
