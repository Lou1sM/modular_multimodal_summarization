        "Sofie: You really should've saved your money.",
        "Aaron: One little milkshake's not going to break the bank.",
        "Sofie: It would break my bank.",
        "Aaron: You said you used to work at a diner. You know, I know the people who own this one.",
        "Sofie: You mean, Alison knows them.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I mean, she works here. She knows them, too. But so do I. They might need a waitress.",
        "Sofie: Aaron, I don't think Alison would appreciate you calling in a favor to get me a job. I told you, I'll find one on my own job.",
        "Aaron: You going to take a sip of that?",
        "Sofie: The baby's not starving, believe me.",
        "Aaron: You're still barely showing.",
        "Sofie: I wonder if that made it easier for Cole to leave. Maybe if I actually looked pregnant, he would have stepped up because it would have been more real or something.",
        "Aaron: Are you ever going to stop making excuses for this guy?",
        "Sofie: I can't believe his mother doesn't even know where he is.",
        "Aaron: Are you worried about him?",
        "Sofie: I love him, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Still?",
        "Sofie: After my run in with his lovely mother this morning, I can understand even better now why he is the way he is --",
        "Aaron: Crazy, right?",
        "Sofie: Aaron.",
        "Aaron: I know, okay. He's your baby's father. I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: I am homeless, jobless, and boyfriendless -- it's all because of this baby. Kind of funny, it's the only thing I have left, right?",
        "Aaron: You've got me. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Sofie: Thank you, Aaron, for being such a great friend. But I mean what I said. I don't want to cause any more problems between you and Ali.",
        "Aaron: I know. Which is why you don't have anything to worry about.",
        "Sofie: I got plenty to worry about. Why do you think Cole's mom even came after me like that? Does she really think I want her money?",
        "Aaron: She's paranoid.",
        "Sofie: Well I don't know how she even found out I was staying at the farm. I mean, Gwen didn't tell her. So who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I thought I was going to be good with my Uncle Caleb's old tackle box and fishing gear. And now -- $300 later --",
        "Noah: Yeah well, fishing is serious business in my family.",
        "Luke: Well I thought it was in my family, too.",
        "Noah: A lazy afternoon by the Snyder pond is not my dad's idea of sport.",
        "Luke: What did I get myself into?",
        "Noah: A really good trip. Whenever I was a kid, you know, where ever we were or whatever else was going on, fishing with my dad was the one thing I always knew I could look forward to. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Not as much fun as if it was just the two of us alone together.",
        "Luke: Yeah well, we can always do that later. We've got nothing but time.",
        "Noah: Sounds so good to hear you say that. You and my dad are the two most important people in my life. I still can't believe we're all getting along, going away together --",
        "Luke: I just hope I make a good impression.",
        "Noah: You already have.",
        "Luke: Well, I hope that your dad's okay, you know, with -- wish us being ourselves.",
        "Noah: He's gonna have to be.",
        "Luke: Hi Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Noah: How's it going?",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Noah: Would you believe I forgot to go pick up bait? I'll go do that now.",
        "Luke: Okay. I will be right here.",
        "Maddie: All this for the pond?",
        "Luke: Oh no. No, this is big time. We are going on a fishing trip.",
        "Maddie: Oh, like -- a romantic getaway? Nice.",
        "Luke: Umm -- well -- I guess as romantic as it can be with Colonel Mayer joining us.",
        "Maddie: Noah's father's going with you?",
        "Luke: Yeah, it was his idea. Can you believe that?",
        "Maddie: Don't do it, Luke. Please don't go.",

        "Holden: Hey, how are you?",
        "Lily: Hi!",
        "Holden: I missed you. You, too.",
        "Lily: Honey, why don't you inside and wash up? And I'll make you something that isn't campfire stew.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Lily: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Holden: Thanks for coming back when I called.",
        "Lily: I couldn't wait to get back. It was great, but having 12 little girls as your constant companions can do a number on your eardrums. So what else did I miss? The wedding.",
        "Holden: Yes, the wedding. The wedding was fantastic.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Holden: Um, we took a ton of pictures. Jack and Katie are actually looking for a house right now.",
        "Lily: Ah! So Carly made it through the wedding day? I tried to call her, she didn't pick up.",
        "Holden: A lot's happened, and it's not good.",
        "Lily: What? What? Now you're worrying me.",
        "Holden: You know what? It's Carly's story to tell.",
        "Lily: Okay. Is everything else all right?",
        "Holden: Well, other than that, it's a bit chaotic here. Aaron's friend, Sofie, is staying here at the farm until she can get back on her feet.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. Wow. You go away for a few days, and a lot happens.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, also -- Faith, she got student of the month.",
        "Lily: Yeah, she told me I just spoke to her.",
        "Holden: And Luke and Noah are officially dating.",
        "Lily: What? I thought Noah had a problem with coming out.",
        "Holden: He came out to his father.",
        "Lily: He did?",
        "Holden: He did. And Colonel Mayer took it a lot better than anyone expected. He was here last night for dinner. He even wanted to apologized to you and Luke for the things he said, the way he acted.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Lily: Why are you concerned with Colonel Mayer all of a sudden?",
        "Dusty: Well, he's one of the witnesses the cops spoke to that night I supposedly threatened Cheri. What was his son's name?",
        "Lily: Noah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, what is it? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Noah: Hello?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Noah?",
        "Noah: Dad. Did you just call?",
        "Colonel Mayer: I tried, but I'm having a tough time getting reception out here. Listen, I checked the weather forecast. I think we should get an earlier start than we had planned.",
        "Noah: Okay, well Luke and I just finished getting the last of what we need. We'll head out right now.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Terrific.",
        "Noah: Dad -- I also just want to say again -- I'm really glad we're doing this.",
        "Colonel Mayer: So am I.",
        "Noah: I'll see you soon.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Drive safe.",
        "Noah: I will. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Nothing is wrong. Is Luke around?",
        "Holden: No, he's buying fishing gear.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: I don't know why, we have a whole bunch of it out in the shed. He and Noah are going on a fishing trip with Noah's father. Yeah.",
        "Lily: Are they going out of town?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Just the three of them. Why? Is that a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg? Meg? Hey.",
        "Meg: This isn't a dream.",
        "Paul: I don't think so. What happened?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I don't remember.",
        "Paul: Did you hurt your head?",
        "Meg: Yeah, but -- I'm -- I'm okay. It's all right.",
        "Paul: Hold on, hold on, hold on. You're hurt?",
        "Meg: I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Paul: Okay, I don't think you're fine. I think that you've hurt your head. And I think that you should go lie down.",
        "Meg: I don't want to.",
        "Paul: Better?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Guys.",
        "Sofie: I think I'd better go. Thank you, Aaron. I'll see you later.",
        "Alison: What did I do now?",
        "Aaron: I think you know.",
        "Alison: No, I don't.",
        "Aaron: Come on, Alison. How could you tell Gwen's mother that Sofie was staying at the farm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You've got a lump. Somebody must have hit you from behind.",
        "Meg: Who'd want to do that?",
        "Paul: I don't know, your husband?",
        "Meg: Craig?",
        "Paul: Is Craig still your husband? He's dangerous, Meg.",
        "Meg: You're the one who's made it your life mission to have revenge on me.",
        "Paul: I'd never hurt you.",
        "Meg: Not physically. Why'd you help me, Paul? I mean, if you hate me as much as you say you do, why didn't you just walk right out that door?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Why don't you think I should go with Noah?",
        "Maddie: It's not -- it's not because I'm jealous if that's what you're thinking. Because I'm -- well I am a little bit jealous, but it has nothing to do with you and Noah. I mean, it is because I care about both of you --",
        "Luke: Mads, Mads, Mads. Just spit it out.",
        "Maddie: You're going to think I'm crazy because I have no real reason to think this. But I told you before, it's Noah's dad. I think he's -- is evil too strong of a word?",
        "Luke: What do you think he's going to do?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. But I think he was a little too cool about you and Noah.",
        "Luke: Because you don't think he should be?",
        "Maddie: No! No, because Noah said that he wouldn't be. And at first he really wasn't.",
        "Luke: Well, don't you think that he loves Noah enough to accept him for who he is?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. Maybe I'm just paranoid because the last time I was anywhere near a camping trip, I ended up getting stalked by someone who was my sister.",
        "Luke: Well that might be it.",
        "Maddie: But I don't think it is.",
        "Luke: Look, Maddie -- come on. What are the chances of that happening again? And if that's really what you think --",
        "Noah: Hey, got the bait.",
        "Luke: Great.",
        "Noah: And I just talked to my dad -- he says we should leave a little bit sooner than we planned in case it rains. So ready to take off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Of course I don't have a problem with Noah and Luke. I just hope Noah doesn't have a problem with it.",
        "Holden: Then why did you react that way when I said they were going away together?",
        "Lily: I was thinking about Dusty.",
        "Holden: Dusty?",
        "Lily: I don't think he jumped bail.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. Is it me, or did that just come totally out of nowhere?",
        "Lily: Isn't that why you called me to come back here? Really? I'm supposed to call Margo, right?",
        "Holden: Yeah, she wants to talk to you ASAP.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Lily, you are forfeiting money left and right, aren't you?",
        "Lily: Dusty did not leave town. At least not by his own choice.",
        "Margo: Well, you sound just like Alison Stewart.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Margo: She fairly leapt to Dusty's defense last night out at the farm without knowing any of the facts. Very much like you are right now. So unless there's something you're not telling me --",
        "Lily: Dusty was doing some investigating on his own.",
        "Margo: On his own? Or with your help?",
        "Lily: Don't tell Holden.",
        "Margo: All right.",
        "Lily: I was helping Dusty, at first. Then he asked me to stay out of it.",
        "Margo: Why would he do that?",
        "Lily: For my own good.",
        "Margo: Oh, that Dusty Donovan, always so selfless.",
        "Lily: Margo, he was getting close.",
        "Margo: Yeah? And that's why he disappeared?",
        "Lily: Maybe.",
        "Margo: So the fact that his gun was found next to Cheri's body, that was just a coincidence?",
        "Lily: No, not a coincidence. He was framed.",
        "Margo: And the threats that he made, Lily -- someone set him up for that too?",
        "Lily: There were plenty of witnesses. Whoever did this, I'm sure heard Dusty and knew he was the perfect person to take the fall.",
        "Margo: Who? Who would do that? Give me a name, Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You sure I can't give you some money for the trip?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Oh no. No, don't be silly.",
        "Holden: This means a lot to Luke. And to us.",
        "Colonel Mayer: To me, too. Oh, here they are. Great, I'm glad we can get an early start.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well let me just go get my bag.",
        "Holden: Looks like you guys are all ready to go. Luke, your mom is back with Nat.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah?",
        "Holden: She had to run an errand. She'll be sorry she missed you.",
        "Luke: Oh well, I can see her tomorrow.",
        "Holden: I was just telling the Colonel, I think you guys are going to have a great time.",
        "Noah: We will.",
        "Colonel Mayer: We will. Let's go.",
        "Holden: All right, Guys. Watch your backs. It's hunting season.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, that's true. You can never be too careful.",
        "Noah: I hope the fish are biting.",
        "Luke: And it doesn't rain.",
        "Noah: Hey, we're not gonna let anything spoil this trip.",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, we are certainly not. But there is something I want you boys to see.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Why don't you go up there in the clearing and see for yourselves.",
        "Noah: Okay. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not going to leave you here lying on the floor injured in the middle of nowhere -- with no cell phone service, no car. You don't have a car. Do you really think that I'm that cruel?",
        "Meg: To a stranger, no. To me --",
        "Paul: Okay -- whatever's happened between us, and whatever it is you think about me, I don't ever want anything bad to happen to you.",
        "Meg: Thanks. That's good to know. But I'm okay now. So you can go.",
        "Paul: I don't have a car or I'd give you a lift.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know.",
        "Paul: And I don't want you wandering around out there alone. You're probably -- probably a little shaky on your feet still. And whoever attacked you is probably still out there somewhere.",
        "Meg: Which is why it's probably not a good idea for us to be sitting around here chatting.",
        "Paul: I'm not going to leave you here alone.",
        "Meg: All this concern, Paul -- what is your fianc\u00e9e gonna say? Rosanna told me you guys set a date. Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why do you always want to think the worst of me?",
        "Aaron: I don't want to.",
        "Alison: I didn't tell Gwen's mother where Sofie was staying.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but Iris said that you did.",
        "Alison: You believe Iris over me?",
        "Aaron: No. But why would she lie about something like that?",
        "Alison: Because from what Gwen tells me, she lives to make trouble.",
        "Aaron: Okay. So what happened?",
        "Alison: Barbara told Iris that Sofie was staying at the farm. Because she also lives to make trouble.",
        "Aaron: And why does Barbara even care?",
        "Alison: Because she wants things to go smoothly for Will and Gwen with the egg donation.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Alison: Because Barbara knew that I was upset about Sofie staying at the farm. So she was trying to help in a weird way. Don't worry. I told her that she shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's great. But why didn't you warn us or call us that Iris was showing up at the farm?",
        "Alison: Was it really that big of a deal? What did Iris do to her? Hurt poor Sofie's delicate feelings?",
        "Aaron: You don't have to be sarcastic, Ali.",
        "Alison: And you don't have to step in and try to fix all her problems for her, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Alison: Isn't it? Why does she always have to be your first priority?",
        "Aaron: She isn't.",
        "Alison: Did you even ask me how I was? Especially since I just got reamed out by Barbara.",
        "Aaron: What did Barbara say to you?",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter.",
        "Aaron: Ali, yes it does. Come on.",
        "Alison: I handled it. On my own. While you were over protecting Sofie at the farm.",
        "Aaron: No, that's not the way it worked.",
        "Alison: Oh. Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: Are you really?",
        "Alison: Is this really about Sofie, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: I think the real reason you're mad at me has nothing to do with what happened at the farm. It's about who I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Why do you suddenly -- you don't need to worry about what Rosanna would have to say about me helping you out here, okay? Rosanna knows exactly how I feel about you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, she and I talked about that a lot. How she knew all about what happened between the two of us at Old Town.",
        "Paul: Nothing happened between the two of us at Old Town.",
        "Meg: You know, that's funny because that's not what Rosanna said.",
        "Paul: I am not talking to you about Rosanna!",
        "Meg: Do you think I want to talk about her? I would love it if I never had to hear her name again. Look, I swore to her that I would stay away from you forever. So I think it's time I made good on that promise -- starting right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Margo, I do not have a lot to go on. And if I say something and it's wrong -- a lot of people could get hurt.",
        "Margo: So still, Donovan remains our only viable suspect. Oh, Lily, if you'd only have heard Winston Mayer going on about how Donovan threatened Cheri.",
        "Lily: How did that come up?",
        "Margo: Well, as I told you, Alison Stewart was really going to the mat for Donovan. I'm sure that the Colonel just wanted to speak up.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Margo: Why? He was there. He was listening to this. I'm sure he felt that Alison couldn't be objective.",
        "Lily: Hey Margo --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Margo: I'm sorry. I've got to take this. Hughes.",
        "Lily: There's something I need to talk to you about, Margo.",
        "Margo: Yeah, hold on. This is going to take a minute if you can wait 'til I'm finished? Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.",
        "Lily: I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So you're sure you don't want to spend tonight in your own bed?",
        "Natalie: No, I want to stay up all night with my friends talking.",
        "Holden: Of course you do. Okay, have fun at the party. You have money, right?",
        "Natalie: Yep, I'm going to make Ethan a teddy bear.",
        "Holden: Good. Now I want you to listen to Angie's mom and if you need anything, give me a call.",
        "Natalie: Okay, love you.",
        "Holden: Love you too. Have fun.",
        "Natalie: Okay!",
        "Maddie: Oh, sorry.",
        "Holden: Sorry.",
        "Maddie: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi, Maddie. How are you?",
        "Maddie: I'm okay. I'm okay.",
        "Holden: Listen, everything that happened with Noah, I know that you and Luke were good friends. I hope it doesn't change that.",

        "Holden: Fishing trip.",
        "Maddie: Where exactly?",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Maddie: I'm really worried about them. And I think that you should be, too.",

        "Noah: You always find the best spot. Now the tent might look small, but it's got everything you can think of. It's even got an espresso maker --",
        "Luke: Awesome.",
        "Noah: Thanks for setting it up, Dad.",
        "Luke: Yeah, we would've helped.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Noah knows I like to have everything just so. I got a rock in my boot. Listen, you guys go ahead. Go, explore. There's a lot to see. I'll catch up.",
        "Noah: Okay. See you.",

        "Alison: Maybe I shouldn't expect anything from you. I mean, we're not even officially back together. It's just, when you invited me over for dinner at the farm I -- maybe I just read into things too much.",
        "Aaron: No, you didn't.",
        "Alison: Well, I didn't expect you to be inviting someone else to move in that same night!",
        "Aaron: I didn't invite Sofie to move in. I'm just letting her stay at the farm. Did you want to leave her on the street?",
        "Alison: When I was homeless oh not so long ago, you didn't offer for me to stay at the farm, did you?",
        "Aaron: You wouldn't have said yes.",
        "Alison: Sometimes I just don't get you, Aaron. If I'm a drug addict and a mess of a person, you want to be there for me. But if I'm strong, if I'm okay, if I'm -- just me, you don't want me.",
        "Aaron: That's not true.",
        "Alison: It is. You're obsessed with helping Sofie because she's so -- so sweet, and so innocent, and so helpless -- and so not me.",

        "Maddie: I just keep thinking about when I ran into the Colonel here -- and just some of the things that he said --",
        "Holden: What things?",
        "Maddie: Well, he asked me if Luke was the one that turned his son. And I tried to convince him that he needed to accept Noah for who he is.",
        "Holden: And looks like you got through to him.",
        "Maddie: That's the thing -- I'm almost positive that I didn't.",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Maddie: Well, I was really surprised when Noah said that his father was okay with things. And I was even more surprised when the Colonel asked Luke on a fishing trip. I mean, it's like he made this huge turnaround out of nowhere.",
        "Holden: Well, sometimes that happens.",
        "Maddie: I tried to tell myself that. But then I remembered the last thing that the Colonel said to me.",
        "Holden: What was that?",
        "Maddie: It's not what he said, it's how he said it. He swore that he wasn't going to lose his son.",

        "Aaron: Ali, I jumped to conclusions. I accused you of something you didn't do and I'm really sorry. You probably don't feel like talking right now, but please don't stay away forever like you did last time, okay? Call me back? Sofie! Sofie, what's wrong? What's wrong? Sit down. Sit down. Why are you crying?",

        "Luke: Oh well, I can do that. I can do that. You take a break.",

        "Noah: Okay, well you go that way, I'll go that way, and we'll meet back in the middle.",
        "Luke: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Noah: Dad, I just need to say this one last time. Thank you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: It's just a little fishing trip, Son.",
        "Noah: It's not just a fishing trip. Dad, I know you always wanted something different for me and from me. And I tried so hard to be the son you always wanted.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You are, Noah.",
        "Noah: I felt like you never understood who I was, but it's me who never understood you. Now I understand how your troops in the field looked up to you and trusted you so much. I'm sorry I didn't always.",
        "Colonel Mayer: There's no apologies necessary.",

        "Noah: I always knew that.",
        "Colonel Mayer: You know, in the army you're trained to make life or death decisions in an instant. But to put the greater good first. Now, that doesn't mean it's easy to know what the right thing to do is.",
        "Noah: I understand.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'm glad you do. And I want you to know, I don't have any regrets about any of the decisions I ever made about you.",
        "Noah: I don't either, Dad.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Good. Why don't you go get that tackle box out of the truck, and let's catch us some fish.",

        "Aaron: That's not true.",
        "Sofie: We couldn't even afford the abortion, let alone raising the baby. Iris gave Cole that money, and I didn't give it back because I wanted Cole to think I'd gone through with it. No wonder she thinks I'm a thief. I am.",
        "Aaron: So put the money in an envelope and mail it back if it makes you feel any better.",
        "Sofie: I can't. After I went to the clinic, I stopped and I gave the landlord the back rent that Cole never paid. Aaron, you want to know what's in my purse? $2 and a token for the bus. And I think I can be somebody's mom.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, you can do this, okay? Don't let Cole or Iris or anybody convince you that you can't. I mean look, Alison hit rock bottom a few months ago. You wouldn't know that now, would you? She cleaned herself up, she got a waitressing job, and now she's doing great.",
        "Sofie: Well, she doesn't have a baby to take care of. Aaron, I -- I don't know what I'm going to do.",
