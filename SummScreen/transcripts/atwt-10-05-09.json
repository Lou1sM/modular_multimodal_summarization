        "Rosanna wants Teri to come back and work for her, but she is too busy at Metro. Craig overhears and thinks he knows why she wants this; she can't control herself around him and needs protection. Rosanna is aggravated that he thinks that and stomps off after more bickering. Brad and Janet continue to argue about what is right for Liberty, as Jack wants a break from it. Brad and Janet enlist Teri to take sides. Eb holds Faith hostage while Damian promises to give him any money he wants, as long as he lets her go, but Eb wants to talk with Lily, who unknown to him is upstairs sleeping. Craig goes to see Carly at rehab, but he learns he is not on the list of Carly's approved visitors. He is upset to see Rosanna there and assumes she was there to tell Carly what happened; Rosanna leaves without telling Craig why she was visiting Carly. When a clueless Lily walks into the living room and the \u0091war zone' of Eb holding Faith hostage, she distracts Eb and Damian and he struggle for the gun. Lily yells for Faith to run get Jack. Lily and Damian try to stop Eb; Damian pushes Eb into the fireplace and being stabbed by the poker instantly kills him. Jack is wrestling with the grief for Holden that has been bubbling up; however, he springs into action when a distraught Faith runs in and tells him what happened. Jack arrives after Eb has died and finds his license on him and goes to run it. He learns he is a suspected bank robber; he also finds a connection between him and Maeve, the woman on the bank's surveillance cameras trying to pass off the note supposedly from Holden. Jack goes to tell Lily these two were just scammers and he is sure Holden is really dead. Lily and Jack struggle emotionally when they have to accept this.",
        "Meanwhile, Holden and Maeve bond, as they work together to get out of Skaggs' basement. At a low point Maeve asks Holden to make love to her. He tells her that he can't, but he will always be there for her when they get out of there. They continue to use the ladder to run at the locked cellar door when it finally starts to give. Teri tries to reason with Janet about how it won't be right for Liberty for her to keep her daughter's baby; she fears if she forces this on Liberty, she will not only lose her but maybe Jack as well. Rosanna comes to see a furious Craig to explain herself; Craig has assumed she spilled the beans to Carly to save herself. Rosanna admits that she was not going to tell Carly, but she was only there to remind herself why they can't be together because he was right - she doesn't trust herself with him. However, Carly wouldn't see her. Craig appreciates her honesty, and he admits that he was there to let Carly know they still hate each other to convince himself of that so he wouldn't feel so badly about betraying her. Craig and Rosanna try to convince themselves they can't let what happened between them happen again, but soon they wind up in each other's arms passionately kissing. Holden gets the door lock to break, but the door and surrounding walls collapse down on him soon after. Faith thanks Damian for saving her and her mother; Lily and Damian are shocked when she hugs him tightly. Later, Lily tells Damian how much she needs him. Damian takes this opportunity to ask Lily to marry him now."

        "Teri: All right. Enjoy. Excuse me.",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Teri: Hey. If you're here for dinner, the salmon turned out really good.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you very much. But actually, I've already made my famous soupy vegetables and dry, crusty chicken for myself and the kids.",
        "Teri: No, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, trust me. You should ask Parker and Sage. They are the reason that I'm here, actually.",
        "Teri: Oh, what's up?",
        "Rosanna: Well, um, I, uh, watched them try to force down my dinner and pretend like they liked it for the very last time, and I really realized then I just -- wow, I need help.",
        "Teri: Oh. I don't know anyone offhand.",
        "Rosanna: Well, no, no, no. I don't want just anybody. I need you.",
        "Teri: Okay, Rosanna, you know, I'm always happy to help, but I just --",
        "Rosanna: Good. Okay, great.",
        "Teri: I can't take a second job right now.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Teri, listen. I know that I have not been the easiest on you. But I want to make it up to you, because I'm completely desperate. And Parker and Sage are really self-sufficient. They're in school right now, and they're really not a lot of work. So with your talent, I'm sure that you could do it. And I'll pay you twice your salary.",
        "Teri: Well, that's generous.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, so you'll do it?",
        "Teri: No. I mean, I would if I could, but this job is taking up all my time, and I'm so glad that we're successful. But I'm, like, living in the kitchen.",
        "Rosanna: We'll adjust to your schedule. How about that? Whatever works for you.",
        "Teri: I really am sorry. Actually, well, I'm not really sorry. I'm glad we're doing well. But I -- I can't do it.",
        "Craig: Do what?",
        "Rosanna: Nothing. Nothing, okay? Thank you. Sorry. I'm going to the ladies' room. Excuse me.",
        "Craig: What was that all about?",
        "Teri: You got me. She said she wants me to come back and work for her, looking after the kids.",
        "Craig: Really? That's weird.",
        "Teri: She said she was desperate.",
        "Craig: Well, I haven't heard any complaints from Parker -- aside from the food.",
        "Teri: Well, I told her I was busy. So if you know anyone --",
        "Craig: I'll let her know.",
        "Teri: I'm gonna go back to the kitchen.",
        "Craig: Okay. I think we should have a drink.",
        "Rosanna: I don't think so. No.",
        "Craig: Let's anyway.",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: So I can keep you from making a fool of yourself.",

        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie. I'm back. We got done at the studio a little early today.",
        "Brad: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: What brings you here?",
        "Brad: Look, I don't mean to interrupt your downtime.",
        "Janet: That's okay. It's important.",
        "Brad: Janet just told me that Liberty moved in with Ryan and Emily Stewart.",
        "Jack: Apparently, yes.",
        "Brad: We got to get her out of there.",
        "Jack: Well, kidnapping's illegal.",
        "Brad: We're her parents, damn it.",
        "Jack: If she's old enough to get pregnant --",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: I'm just saying.",
        "Janet: I know, but --",
        "Brad: Well, hold on, okay? I -- I think that the three of us go over there, and we talk to her. We tell her to come home. Don't you think she'll listen to us?",
        "Jack: No, that's not the way to handle this.",
        "Brad: There's no way in hell that I'm letting her be a baby-making machine for those two whack jobs.",
        "Jack: You haven't told me your plan, have you?",
        "Brad: What plan?",
        "Janet: I was waiting to talk to Liberty first.",
        "Brad: What plan? What?",
        "Jack: He can help you convince her.",
        "Brad: What? What did you tell him? Listen, I'm her father, okay? If you got a way of getting her out of there, I want to know about it.",
        "Jack: This isn't just about getting her out of there.",
        "Brad: What's it about?!",
        "Jack: Tell him, Janet.",
        "Janet: Okay. This is about the baby.",
        "Brad: What about it?",
        "Janet: We would like to raise it ourselves.",
        "Brad: You two? That's the plan?",
        "Jack: That's the plan.",
        "Brad: Are you out of your minds?",

        "Holden: Look, look, we're gonna get out of here.",
        "Maeve: This is Skaggs' house. He's dead. No one's coming down to his root cellar!",
        "Holden: Eb knows that we're here.",
        "Maeve: He wants us to die!",
        "Holden: You said that Eb wasn't a killer.",
        "Maeve: He wouldn't care if it happened. We're dying. We're going to die. We've got to face it.",
        "Holden: There's got to be a way out.",
        "Maeve: There's only one way out.",
        "Holden: Let's at least look around.",
        "Holden: Just wish we had some more light.",
        "Maeve: Uh, well -- I can do something positive about that. Oh!",
        "Holden: That's a great idea.",
        "Maeve: I dreamed about this all my life.",
        "Holden: What's that?",
        "Maeve: Having money to burn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Faith, Faith, don't worry. He won't hurt you.",
        "Eb: You sure about that?",
        "Damian: Just let the child go, and I'll do whatever you want. I'll give you whatever you want.",
        "Eb: How am I supposed to believe you?",
        "Damian: You can't believe I want us all to get out of this alive?",
        "Eb: How much did you care about that when you pushed me over that cliff?",
        "Damian: You were pointing a gun at my son.",
        "[Faith screams]",
        "Damian: No.",
        "Eb: Now it's pointed at this little lady. Difference is, this time, you're not getting in my way.",
        "Damian: Listen, if its money you want, I have it, all you want. Just let the child go. She isn't part of this.",
        "Eb: She is now.",
        "Damian: No, this is between you and me.",
        "Eb: And you're gonna shut up and do what I tell you!",
        "Damian: Yes, I will. Just don't hurt her.",
        "Eb: Then go get the kid's mama, now!",
        "Lily: Damian -- Damian?",
        "Damian: Mrs. Snyder's not here. But I have access to unlimited funds.",
        "Eb: Stop yapping and get that woman in here, or her little brat's the first one to die.",
        "[Faith sobs]",
        "Damian: See? Nobody. If you want money, you have to deal with me.",
        "Eb: And trust you, after last time?!",
        "Damian: Last time, I -- I didn't know what you wanted.",
        "Eb: What I want is for you to go get this kid's mama.",
        "Damian: I'm not doing that.",
        "Eb: Then I guess you don't care what happened to her.",
        "[Faith screams]",
        "Eb: Shut up!",
        "Damian: Faith, Faith, please. Do as he says, Honey.",
        "Eb: That's the smartest thing you said so far.",
        "Damian: You're not gonna hurt the child, right?",
        "Eb: I'm calling the shots here. Now, go get me the rich lady.",
        "Damian: How many times do I have to tell you? She's not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: It's good to see you smiling.",
        "Maeve: I guess I got out of practice, all those years with Eb.",
        "Holden: They're over.",
        "Maeve: Well, I'd say so.",
        "Holden: No, that's not what I meant. What's so funny?",
        "Maeve: Sorry. I just --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Maeve: I got this picture of Eb finding out that I found all his money, and I burned it.",
        "Holden: All his dreams, up in smoke.",
        "Maeve: Oh, I wish he could be here to see this.",
        "Holden: Oh, he'd shoot us to death.",
        "Maeve: Uh, probably. But you know, we're gonna die anyway. So at least if he were here, we'd get the last laugh.",
        "Holden: We're not gonna die.",
        "Maeve: I know this isn't the fairy-tale ending you expected with Lily.",
        "Holden: Maeve --",
        "Maeve: But we are gonna die. This is it. We have to be honest with ourselves.",
        "Holden: Okay, listen to me. You said you'd love to see Eb's face if he saw us burning up his money. Think about his face when he sees that we get out of here.",
        "Maeve: That would be a sight.",
        "Holden: Then let's make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You think I don't know why you asked Teri to come back to work for you?",
        "Rosanna: It's no secret, Craig. I told you. I -- I need help.",
        "Craig: No, you don't.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean no, I don't? What, you think you know what I need better than I know?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Rosanna: Well, okay. Well, why don't you tell me, then? Why -- why did I ask Teri?",
        "Craig: For protection.",
        "Rosanna: From what?",
        "Craig: From me. Go ahead and laugh all you want. We both know you're afraid you'll give into your desires.",
        "Rosanna: My desires? My desires? What is this, a Harlequin romance novel? My desires for what, for you?",
        "Craig: That's right.",
        "Rosanna: Don't be so crazy.",
        "Craig: It's not that I blame you. It was pretty amazing.",
        "Rosanna: For you, maybe.",
        "Craig: No, for both of us.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, typical man. Don't flatter yourself.",
        "Craig: Come on, admit it.",
        "Rosanna: All right, Craig. All right. It's hopeless. I -- I, uh -- can't stop thinking about you.",
        "Craig: I knew it.",
        "Rosanna: The reason that I asked Teri for help was so that she could save me from myself. Because if you ever come near me again, I swear to God, I will kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I don't believe this.",
        "Janet: It's not that unusual.",
        "Brad: You're right. It's totally nuts.",
        "Janet: Hey!",
        "Brad: Its nuts.",
        "Janet: Let me explain.",
        "Brad: What is there to explain? Besides wrecking our daughter's life, what, you want to screw with her head?",
        "Jack: Okay, that's a little unfair.",
        "Brad: Wait, you're gonna tell me that you're on board with this?",
        "Jack: I am on Janet's side 100%.",
        "Brad: Nice way not to answer the question.",
        "Jack: Okay, you -- you know what? The two of you should discuss this by yourselves.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, you don't have to leave, okay?",
        "Jack: I was thinking more that you should.",
        "Janet: Wait. You're a part of this plan.",
        "Brad: Whether you like it or not.",
        "Janet: Listen, this happens all of the time.",
        "Brad: Not in my family, Janet!",
        "Janet: Oh, right, like you Snyders have never done anything weird.",
        "Jack: She's got a point there.",
        "Brad: Nothing like this! I mean, have you -- have you thought this through?",
        "Janet: Of course I have.",
        "Brad: Okay, if we go ahead, if -- if you do this, all right, Liberty's kid will be her brother or sister and cousin, and, uh, my grandchild will be my niece or nephew, and my new kid's niece and nephew and cousin. And it hurts my head to even think about it.",
        "Janet: Okay, all right. So it's a little unconventional.",
        "Brad: It's unconventional?! It's Jerry Springer, Janet!",
        "Jack: Time-out, time-out! I know this is important. I do. And I love Liberty, too. I do. But I'm really -- I had a really bad day and a -- a rotten week and a miserable month since Holden died. So if you two just wouldn't mind taking this someplace else, I'd appreciate it.",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: I'm serious. Honey, please. Just go, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: There's no one else in this house and no money. But I can write a check right now for as much as you want.",
        "Eb: A check? Are you kidding me?",
        "Damian: Yeah, I have it right here.",
        "Eb: Hey, hey!",
        "Damian: Look, we can go to the bank and cash it right now.",
        "Eb: It's nighttime. Banks are all closed.",
        "Damian: I'll call my banker.",
        "Eb: No, just shut up! Shut up! I know how you rich folks live. There's cash hidden in this house somewhere, tucked away in a safe or -- or something.",
        "Damian: That's not true.",
        "Eb: Well, I want to hear from her!",
        "Damian: She's not here.",
        "Eb: One more chance. Aah!",
        "[Faith screams]",
        "Eb: Shut up!",

        "Holden: Hey, I found something.",
        "Maeve: Oh, get out of here.",
        "Holden: No, it might be enough for us to break down the door.",
        "Maeve: Seriously?",
        "Holden: Oh, okay, you're right. Let's not even try.",
        "Maeve: Of course we can try.",
        "Holden: Okay, good, good. There's the positive attitude I was talking about. It's pretty heavy. Two of us are gonna need to do this.",
        "Maeve: I can do this. Let's go. Let's just do it. Let's get --",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Maeve: Okay. Oh, gee. No.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Maeve: No. I got it. I'm -- I'm a country girl. I'm used to heavy lifting.",
        "Holden: I like that in a woman.",
        "Maeve: Well, then, you've come to the right place.",
        "Holden: All right, listen. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna ram it against the door, all right?",
        "Maeve: Okay.",
        "Holden: You ready?",
        "Maeve: Uh-huh.",
        "Holden: On three. One, two, three. Again. Again.",

        "Damian: Just put the gun down, and I'll do whatever you want.",
        "Eb: You'll do it anyway.",

        "Lily: Who are you? What do you want?",
        "Damian: He's the man from Kentucky who said he had Holden.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God. Is Holden alive?",
        "Eb: I want you all to shut up!",
        "Lily: Okay, l -- listen to me. Just let her go. Baby, it's gonna be okay. What do you want? Let her go.",

        "Craig: This time I mean it.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you're not gonna just drop by every time you get the urge?",
        "Craig: Trust me, that urge has passed.",

        "Craig: Yes, I do. But what about me?",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean, what about you?",
        "Craig: I mean, how do I know you won't come and try to have your way with me again?",
        "Rosanna: That is so not funny.",
        "Craig: All right, look. We both said that we'd forget about it. I have. In fact, what the hell are we even talking about?",
        "Rosanna: Nothing, apparently.",
        "Craig: Good. Are we done?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. We are so done.",

        "Teri: What was that about?",
        "Craig: What was what about?",
        "Teri: You and Rosanna. You two really hate each other.",
        "Craig: Is that what it looked like?",
        "Teri: Are you kidding? I feel bad for Carly. Her sister and her fianc\u00e9 going at it like rabid dogs all the time --",

        "Janet: Liberty isn't having this baby because of me. She's doing it because it's the right thing.",
        "Brad: Come on.",
        "Janet: Why can't you just accept that?!",
        "Brad: Liberty already told me what her choice was. That was to end the pregnancy. You moved heaven and earth to make sure that she didn't go through with it.",
        "Janet: I just made sure she had all the information she needed.",
        "Brad: From priests. And from what, from Katie, who's older, married, and desperately wants to have a child? Who are you gonna get to ambush her next, huh? A -- a psychic?",
        "Janet: Nobody is ambushing her.",
        "Brad: You dragged her out of that clinic.",
        "Janet: Okay. Obviously, we're never gonna see eye to eye on whether or not she should have the baby.",
        "Brad: No, we won't.",
        "Janet: We should at least be on the same page about Jack and me raising it.",
        "Brad: No, we can't.",
        "Janet: Why are you being so pigheaded?",
        "Brad: Because it is a terrible idea.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Brad: Have you even thought about where Liberty fits in that scenario?",
        "Janet: Oh. Liberty is all I think about. And this was the best solution I could come up with.",
        "Brad: Because you ruled out the better one. I can't accept it. I'm not gonna accept your so-called scenario, okay? It's ridiculous, Janet.",
        "Janet: What?! Where are you going?",
