        "Gwen: Okay, I'm here. What's going on? ",
        "Maddie: That's what I want to find out. ",
        "Gwen: Look, I'm about as interested in Jade as I am in the bird flu epidemic.\r\n",
        "Maddie: I think that's going to change. ",
        "Gwen: Why, is she being launched into orbit? ",
        "Maddie: Better. ",
        "Gwen: Maddie, I really don't know if I want to hear this. ",
        "Maddie: Oh, no? You don't want to hear that Jade's faking this pregnancy just \r\nto keep her hooks into Will? ",
        "",
        "Jade: Special delivery -- ",
        "Will: That was fast. ",
        "Jade: Yeah. I think I got in and out of Java in 30 seconds flat. ",
        "Will: Why? ",
        "Jade: Because I'm so popular in town. ",
        "Will: Is that the Pomegranate tea you were talking about? ",
        "Jade: Um, no. They were all out, so I ordered a latte instead. But don't \r\nworry, its decaf. I'm not taking any chances. Did I show you? I got this book at \r\nthe clinic about health and nutrition during pregnancy. I thought we could both \r\ncheck it out. ",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. ",
        "Jade: I can get you a copy, or we both could do it. ",
        "Will: Okay, do you whatever you want. ",
        "Jade: I was thinking I could start now, with a walk around the lake. It's so \r\nbeautiful out, but there's still some icy spots. So, I could really use an arm \r\nto lean on just in case. ",
        "Will: Not today. You're going to be getting your exercise by moving into your \r\nnew apartment. I got you a place at Oakdale Court. It's got utilities included. \r\nAnd six months rent paid up front. Room for you, and a bathroom, and another \r\nroom for the baby. ",
        "Jade: Wow. You didn't waste any time. ",
        "Will: Well, I meant what I said. You can't stay here. ",
        "",
        "Henry: The woman at the flower shop says yellow means friendship. I hear \r\nthey're ready to spring you. ",
        "Emily: Did my mother send you, Henry? ",
        "Henry: No, no, she's up to her stethoscope in storm victims, Hal\u2019s off on a \r\nspecial assignment. Anyway, I'm your lift. Your lift home. We're going to go to \r\nyour mom's place, and I've got an all-day scrabble tournament set up. Daniel's \r\ngoing to stop by for a quick visit, and then I might even try to make some \r\nhomemade ice cream, if I can figure out the machine. Because I got to warn you, \r\nme and mechanical things -- there's always a severed something -- ",
        "Emily: What's a five letter word for traitor? Could it be H-e-n-r-y? So, no, \r\nHenry. No scrabble, no ice cream, and thanks. I'll find my own way -- I mean it.\r\n",
        "Henry: Emily, don't -- ",
        "Emily: I mean it. I don't want you in my life. Henry, I don't ever want to \r\nsee you again. ",
        "",
        "Meg: Thank you for making the arrangements. ",
        "Chaplain: Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. ",
        "Meg: Well, thank you. I'll let you know after I talk to Paul. ",
        "Chaplain: Of course. ",
        "Craig: Meg, do you got a minute? ",
        "Meg: For you? No. What's with the stick? ",
        "Craig: I've heard some women think that a cane adds a touch of old world \r\nelegance to a man -- ",
        "Meg: Well, luckily I'm not one of those women. ",
        "Craig: I lost my balance earlier. ",
        "Meg: You lost your balance a long time ago. ",
        "Craig: Biting, cutting wit, I knew you were the girl for the job. ",
        "Meg: I'm not a girl and I already have a job. ",
        "Craig: I need your professional help. I want out of this hospital. ",
        "Paul: You stay away from Meg, or you will need that cane permanently. ",
        "",
        "Dusty: She's okay, Chaz. ",
        "Lucy: Who is this guy, secret service? ",
        "Dusty: More like an insurance policy. ",
        "Lucy: You hired a bodyguard to protect Johnny from my father? ",
        "Dusty: Well, as long as I got Chaz around, no one comes within a mile of my \r\nson. ",
        "Lucy: And if he tries, what happens? He ends up with no kneecaps? ",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Who knows. ",
        "Lucy: I don't believe this. ",
        "Dusty: I don't believe that your dad is walking around a free man. Do you \r\nunderstand what he did to my wife? ",
        "Lucy: If you want to talk about criminal records, I have a few questions for \r\nyour friend Chaz over there. ",
        "Dusty: Chaz? He's honest about what he does. ",
        "Lucy: What is that, exactly? ",
        "Dusty: You want to talk about Chaz, I don't know what to say. ",
        "Lucy: If you want to talk about my father, I have a ton of things to say. \r\nHere's something you might not remember about me, Dusty. I don't like being told \r\nwhat I can or can't do, who I can or can't be with -- ",
        "Dusty: If you want to be with your old man -- ",
        "Lucy: Look, I don't know what I want to do about my father. Or how I feel.\r\n",
        "Dusty: I don't want to hear about how he risked his life to save you and \r\nJohnny. Your father's got an agenda. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, getting pinned under a tree is some agenda. ",
        "Dusty: He shows up in the middle of nowhere with a ski mask on. He just \r\nhappens to be there when you got to get my son to the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: How do you turn that into something subversive? ",
        "Dusty: He followed you. He's got his sights on my boy. ",
        "Lucy: Dusty, he's my father. I can't pretend that he doesn't exist. But that \r\ndoesn't mean I think he deserves to be Johnny\u2019s father. ",
        "Dusty: Okay, what does it mean? ",
        "Lucy: You're Johnny\u2019s dad. You're the guy who should raise him. Teach him to \r\nplay fair, and love him for who he is. Do you think I want him growing up the \r\nway I did? Making excuses for his father? I want him to be proud of his dad. I'm \r\nproud of you. But if my father just being here means we can't be friends, have \r\nthe guts to tell me to my face. I don't want to hear it from Chaz. ",
        "Dusty: I do my own talking. ",
        "Lucy: So which is it? Friends or enemies? ",
        "Dusty: You think you can keep some distance from your father? ",
        "Lucy: I can separate who he is to me from what I know he can never be to \r\nJohnny. ",
        "Dusty: You sure? ",
        "Lucy: You want it in blood? Excuse me? I don't think we've been formally \r\nintroduced. I'm Dr. Lucy Montgomery. Johnny's older sister, daughter of public \r\nenemy number one, Craig Montgomery? I'm sure you have his mug shot somewhere on \r\nyour person. ",
        "Chaz: Boss? ",
        "Lucy: For the record, I want Johnny to stay with Mr. Donovan. I don't think \r\nthey should be separated. And in the interest of not having to wear protective \r\ngear the next time I'm in their company, are you giving me access to Johnny and \r\nMr. Donovan or not? ",
        "Dusty: I think she's okay. ",
        "Lucy: Just okay? You make a girl's head spin, Donovan. ",
        "Dusty: I'm glad we got that settled. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I hope we did. ",
        "Dusty: Your father's not going to make it easy. ",
        "Lucy: When has my father made anything easy? ",
        "Dusty: Mr. Yamamoto, good to see you. Welcome back to Oakdale. Listen, I'm \r\nsorry that I wasn't able to make it to New York. ",
        "Mr. Yamamoto: Luckily, my business in Chicago made it possible for us to \r\nreschedule. ",
        "Dusty: I want you to meet my son, Johnny. Mr. Yamamoto, and you remember \r\nLucy? Dr. Lucy Montgomery? ",
        "Mr. Yamamoto: Of course. It's a pleasure to see you again, Doctor. ",
        "Lucy: How's your wife doing, Mr. Yamamoto? Did she take my advice on her \r\ntennis elbow? ",
        "Mr. Yamamoto: Yes, she did and she's much improved. Thank you again. ",
        "Dusty: And how about you, Sir? What can we do for you? ",
        "Mr. Yamamoto: My people are ready to review those licensing agreements as we \r\ndiscussed. ",
        "Dusty: When would you like to meet? ",
        "Mr. Yamamoto: I've taken the liberty of having our attorneys gather in the \r\nconference room across from the lobby. We're ready if you are. ",
        "Dusty: Give me a moment. I'll be there in a sec. ",
        "Dr. Yamamoto: Pleasure, Dr. Montgomery. You too, young man. ",
        "Lucy: Go, go. I'll watch Johnny and Mr. Hairy Knuckles over here, can watch \r\nme watching Johnny. He'll be fine, Dusty. Show a little faith in me. ",

        "Meg: Paul, I can handle Craig. ",
        "Craig: This is strictly a professional request. ",
        "Paul: It's a hospital and there's plenty of nurses. You go find yourself \r\nanother one. ",
        "Meg: Hey, it's okay. ",
        "Craig: Well, look at that, speaking for herself. At least she hasn't \r\nrelinquished that right yet. ",
        "Meg: You're obviously feeling better? ",
        "Craig: Much. ",
        "Meg: What is it you want me to do exactly, Craig? ",
        "Craig: I want you to page whoever it is you need to page and get me out of \r\nhere. ",
        "Meg: You're not my patient and you're not on my floor. So, page whoever you \r\nneed to page yourself. ",
        "Craig: I see that health care really is your calling. Thank you so much for \r\nyour help. ",
        "Meg: I came so close to putting that cane to some good use myself. ",
        "Paul: You weren't the one who told me not to let him get under my skin? ",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, it was good in theory. Are you okay? ",
        "Paul: Not at all. I keep going over and over in my head the last few months. \r\nYou know, did I push Emily too hard? Did I cause her health problems? ",
        "Meg: We all did, Paul. The moment we found out she was pregnant, we knew it \r\nwouldn't be easy for her to carry this baby with all the emotional baggage that \r\ncame with it. ",
        "Paul: I guess I just kind of took it for granted that everything was going to \r\nbe okay. ",
        "Meg: No, you didn\u2019t. You moved mountains to help her. You did everything she \r\nneeded. You did everything right. ",
        "Paul: So, how come everything went all wrong? ",
        "Meg: Because you couldn't make her happy. You couldn't give her the one thing \r\nshe wanted, a life with you. Anything short of that, and there's bound to be \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, poor kid got mixed up in our trouble before she was even born.\r\n",
        "Meg: The hospital chaplain has made arrangements for a small memorial. ",
        "Paul: You talked to him? ",
        "Meg: Yeah, just a little while ago. ",
        "Paul: Thank you. ",
        "Meg: It's the least I could do. ",
        "Paul: What? ",
        "Meg: Paul, if it's okay with you and Emily, I'd like to be at the memorial. I \r\nfeel that I need to find a way to say goodbye to Jennifer too. ",

        "Henry: Emily -- ",
        "Emily: Henry, just go away. ",
        "Henry: You hate me? ",
        "Emily: Yes. ",
        "Henry: You blame me for what happened to the baby? ",
        "Emily: Yes, I blame you. ",
        "Henry: You never want to speak to me again? ",
        "Emily: Not if I can help it. ",
        "Henry: Okay then, don\u2019t. Don't speak. I'll talk. Look, I know I said this \r\nwhole thing in motion by calling Meg. But I would rather you hate me for life, \r\nthen have you go off in a middle of storm and give birth with only Daniel to \r\nhold your hand. I mean, is that a memory that you want for this boy? ",
        "Emily: You don't know I would go into labor! You don't know -- you don't know \r\nanything! ",
        "Henry: My only other option was to do nothing. And I've tried that before. I \r\ntried it with my little sister and what happened? She went to hell and back \r\nbecause I wouldn't interfere. I bought into her fantasy that her life was \r\nperfect. I'm not going to buy into yours, Em -- ",
        "Emily: Everything would have been okay. ",
        "Henry: You don't know that. You don't know that. I'm sorry about the baby. I \r\nwanted to be an Uncle Henry. You have no idea how much I wanted that. So, if you \r\nneed to blame somebody, blame me. Rather than blaming yourself. ",
        "Emily: Blame myself for what? ",
        "Henry: For going off in the middle of an ice storm. It was dumb. It was \r\nreckless. It was dangerous. But you've paid for it. You paid for it more than \r\nanyone should ever have to pay. So, if you need to blame me, blame me. I will be \r\nyour fall-guy. ",

        "Jade: I get that you don't want me around. But no two days are the same for \r\nme. Especially now that I'm pregnant. ",

        "Jade: Why does everything have to be about Gwen! This is my pregnancy. I'm \r\nsorry. You do something nice for me and I'm yelling at you. It's just my moods.\r\n",
        "Will: Sorry, I can't do anything about your mood. ",
        "Jade: I just wish that the baby and I mattered half as much as Gwen. ",
        "Will: The baby does matter. Look, just tell me, do you want the apartment or \r\nnot? ",
        "Jade: Yes, I want the apartment. I'm not ungrateful. I'm sure it's a really \r\ngreat place. So, did you pack my vitamins and the folic acid? ",
        "Will: I couldn't remember where you left them. ",
        "Jade: Kitchen. ",
        "Will: I'll go get them. ",

        "",
        "Gwen: Okay, so Dallas Griffin said that Jade was acting weird about the baby. \r\nSo what? ",
        "Maddie: No, no, not weird, secretive. Okay, she gets in this car accident and \r\nthen she doesn't tell him or anybody else about the baby. Don't you think that \r\nshould have been the first thing out of her mouth? But no. Then, later, she went \r\nto the hospital and she was acting the same way. ",
        "Gwen: Okay, so Jade keeps secrets. That doesn't mean that she's lying about \r\nthe pregnancy. ",
        "Maddie: Hang on a sec -- ",

        "Maddie: You'll see. ",
        "Gwen: Look, I think it's really great that you want to help, but I cannot \r\nmake my entire life about Jade. ",
        "Maddie: I thought you wanted to make your entire life about will. ",
        "Gwen: No, school. My life is about school -- ",
        "Maddie: Okay. There are three. ",
        "Gwen: Three what? ",
        "Maddie: These two seem like the best bet. Those, let's see. ",
        "Gwen: Hey, are you listening to me? ",
        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah, yeah, every word. Today at therapy, my therapist said \r\nthat I need to start thinking about myself and who I am, and who my friends are. \r\nWhat they mean to me. And well, the three of them anyway. And you, and Casey, \r\nand Will showed up for me when I was completely out of my mind. I didn't even \r\nknow what I was doing, so -- ",

        "Gwen: You're not serious. ",

        "Gwen: All right, what if they have caller id? ",
        "Maddie: I'm going through information. There's no trail. Hi, yes, could you \r\ngive me the number for the Women's Free Clinic on -- ",
