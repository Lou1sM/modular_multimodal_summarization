        "Liberty isn't thrilled that Janet wants to adopt her baby and makes it clear that she wants to give the baby to Emily and Paul because she wants to go to college and do the things that she (Janet) was never able to do because she decided to raise her. Liberty tells her mother that if she wants a baby so badly she should have one of her own but she isn't getting her baby. Emily sees that all the pressure is getting to Liberty so she confronts Janet and they both tell each other that they will fight for this child.",
        "Damian pressures Lily to marry him or he will walk out of her life forever because he can't be with her unless they get married. Lily tells Damian she needs him and she will marry him but only if her children approve. Damian goes to the farm to tell Meg about the proposal and is hopeful that he and Meg can be friends because they have a strong connection. Meg tells Damian that Holden's children will not approve of him marrying Lily . Damian tells Meg that he will wait as long as it takes to marry Lily. Meg goes to unload her troubles on Paul and he advises her not to become like his former self because revenge will only hurt her and nobody else. Meg tells Paul that fighting for Damian's love and seeking revenge is better then being lonely besides the kids will never accept Lily marrying Damian so soon after their father's death. Maeve saves Holden after the root cellar collapse on top of him and gets him to the hospital. Maeve then returns to the root cellar and searches the rubble for the money. Maeve returns to the hospital and hides from the cops who are after her. Maeve says a tearful good-bye to Holden and tells him she will be okay because she got the money out of the root cellar. Maeve tells Holden she would stay if she had a chance with him but since she doesn't she is going to use the money to get a fresh start. Maeve doesn't tell Holden where she is going and kisses him on the cheek. Holden dreams of a happy reunion with his family while back in Oakdale the kids approve of Lily and Damian getting married because he has done so much to protect the family. Damian and Lily happily kiss outside the house and then decide that they will get married tomorrow because life is too short to wait any longer to be happy."

        "Liberty: Um, fine. Emily just, uh, took me shopping.",
        "Janet: Well, thank you for dropping her off. Good night.",
        "Emily: Good to see you, too, Janet. Listen, if you need a ride home, you call me, okay?",
        "Liberty: Yes. Thank you so much for everything. You've been so generous.",
        "Emily: Oh, Honey, it was my pleasure. Bye.",
        "Liberty: Bye.",
        "Janet: Can I get you anything?",
        "Liberty: Uh, you know, we ate at the mall, but I'll have a, uh, chocolate milkshake.",
        "Emily: Uh, Liberty, I'm -- I'm sorry. Um, caffeine in the chocolate -- not a good idea.",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Emily: Bye.",
        "Liberty: Bad for the baby. Bye. Vanilla will be fine.",
        "Janet: Okay, a little bit of chocolate syrup ain't gonna keep the kid out of Yale.",
        "Liberty: Whatever, Mom. Will you just tell me why you wanted to see me?",
        "Janet: Who says I need a reason to see my little girl?",
        "Liberty: You don't need a reason, but we both know that there is one.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, I've just missed you so much. You know, things have been so tense lately. I hate it when things get between us.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I hate it, too.",
        "Janet: We've always been so close, ever since you were a baby, even when we've knocked heads. Do you remember that time you were 7? I was just thinking about this. It was Halloween. You wanted to be Madonna, and I wouldn't let you wear the bra out in public.",
        "Liberty: Stop. You know, I love walking down memory lane with you, but can you just please tell me why you wanted to see me?",
        "Janet: Sweetie, you know that you're the most important thing in my life, and we've had a lot of good times together.",
        "Liberty: Mom, if you start singing \"Girls just want to have fun,\" I'm out of here.",
        "Janet: Hey! You used to love it when I'd sing you that at bedtime.",
        "Liberty: In my crib. Mom, seriously. We both know you have something to say, so just spit it out.",

        "Paul: I'm paying you like $500 an hour. You can't get me a copy of an adoption agreement? I -- I can get it from the -- from the kiosk at the copy shop. I want those papers by tonight. You know, when you pay somebody by the hour, it's like you're encouraging them to go slowly. Hi. Wait a minute. What are you -- you're not supposed to be here till tomorrow.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I -- I thought you might want to have Eliza a little early.",
        "Paul: Since when?",
        "Meg: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: You've never wanted to spend five minutes away from her before. I -- what's wrong?",
        "Meg: Nothing. I'm just a little distracted, and I don't feel like giving her all the attention she deserves.",
        "Paul: Distracted by what?",
        "Meg: Just here. Stuff.",
        "Paul: \"Stuff\"? Do you mean Grimaldi stuff?",
        "Meg: He's lying to Lily, to all of us.",
        "Paul: About what?",
        "Meg: Holden.",
        "Paul: Meg, Holden's gone. What's there left to lie about?",
        "Meg: I don't know, but he is. And no one seems to want to find out why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Did you really pick now to propose to me?",
        "Damian: That's right.",
        "Lily: A man just died in this room! He could have killed Faith and you.",
        "Damian: Lily, coming so close to death tonight, it was proof of how important it is not to waste a single minute in life. And I want to spend every minute I have left with you.",
        "Lily: Damian --",
        "Damian: Listen, I understand if you still want to wait. I know what it feels like. You just lost Holden.",
        "Lily: I did.",
        "Damian: I love you. I want to be with you forever. I want to look out for you and the children so that nothing like tonight ever happens again. You need someone. You all do. And I would be honored to be that person. If that's what you want, too, then why should we wait?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: Holden, I'm here! Hold on, hold on! Oh, God. Oh, God. Can you hear me? Answer me! Holden, please! Please don't be dead! Oh! Open your eyes! Please open your eyes! Open your eyes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know Holden is gone.",
        "Damian: Do you? After all the years with Holden, it's only natural to wish that he could somehow come back to you. But it's not possible, Lily. He's gone. And I'm here.",
        "Lily: You saved our lives tonight, Damian. I'm so grateful.",
        "Damian: \"Grateful\"?",
        "Lily: Of course.",
        "Damian: That is all?",
        "Lily: What are you asking me?",
        "Damian: I'm asking if you love me, Lily.",
        "Lily: You know I do.",
        "Damian: I don't mean out of nostalgia or grief or gratitude. I want you to love me as I love you, with passion. I want to be with you every minute. I need to know if you feel the same.",
        "Lily: I -- it's been so difficult.",
        "Damian: I know, I know. And I don't want to put pressure on you. If you want me to wait, I'll wait. I just need to know if those feelings are there somewhere. Because if they're not, Lily, I'm gonna let you go without me.",
        "Lily: I don't want to be without you.",
        "Damian: Well, then, marry me. Marry --",
        "Lily: I do love you. I love you, Damian. I want to be with you. What I want and what I should do are two different things.",
        "Damian: You should do what you feel is right to you, Lily.",
        "Lily: It's not that simple, and you know it. Children -- I have a family. I have my husband's family to consider. Do you know what it would do to them to remarry so soon?",
        "Damian: Lily, what would it do to you to be alone? Is there one chance that I might make you happy?",
        "Lily: Oh, there's more than a chance.",
        "Damian: Then don't you deserve that, huh? Don't you deserve that after all you've been through?",
        "Lily: I can't just think of myself.",
        "Damian: Lily, how can your children get on with their lives if they don't see you getting on with yours?",
        "Lily: I just think it might be too soon.",
        "Damian: What has to change, Lily? When will you know when it's no longer too soon?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I -- I guess it will just feel right.",
        "Damian: Does that feel right?",
        "Lily: Damian --",
        "Damian: Lily, I can't leave things as they are. I can't stand on the sideline and -- and keep a respectable distance when my heart and soul cry out for you. And you know very well I can't be in this house with you unless I'm your husband.",
        "Lily: You can.",
        "Damian: No! It wouldn't be right, Lily. It wouldn't be right.",
        "Luke: Hey, I just found out what happened. Is everything all right?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Luke: How's Faith? Is she okay?",
        "Lily: Fine. She's upstairs resting.",
        "Luke: Jack told me that you saved their lives.",
        "Damian: Yeah. I just hope it's the last time I'll have to.",
        "Luke: I can't believe that maniac came back.",
        "Faith: Luke!",
        "Luke: Oh, Faith. Oh, are you okay?",
        "Faith: Yeah, I'm fine. That guy was so scary. I thought I was gonna die, but he grabbed the gun away from him.",
        "Luke: Well, it's a good thing that Damian was here.",
        "Damian: I promise, I'll be here from now on. Nothing will ever happen to you.",

        "Maeve: Holden, please. Please!",
        "[Holden groans]",
        "[Maeve sobs]",
        "Maeve: Thank God. Thank God.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Maeve: The wall collapsed in on you. But don't you worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm going to get -- Holden? Holden? Stay with me! Oh, damn it. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, is she asleep?",
        "Paul: She's sleeping like a baby. Which is funny, 'cause you know what? She's a baby. Sorry. All right. What's going on with Damian?",
        "Meg: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: He's moving in on my brother's wife before his corpse even has a chance to get cold. He's acting like some sort of surrogate dad, and he's running around like he's lord of the manor and lying to everybody about everything.",
        "Paul: Thought you didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Meg: He is taking full advantage of Holden's death to steal his family, and Lily -- she's just letting him do it.",
        "Paul: Okay. And -- and that's what's upsetting you, not the fact that he stomped on you?",
        "Meg: I don't care about that!",
        "Paul: Of course not.",
        "Meg: I don't! But if he thinks he can stomp all over my brother's memory --",
        "Paul: Then what? What? What are you gonna do?",
        "Meg: I don't know yet.",
        "Paul: Oh, Meg, please, please, take some advice from the, you know, former king of poorly conceived revenge plots. It will never work. You should just walk away from this. Leave it alone.",
        "Meg: You know, I can't do that.",
        "Paul: The only one who will suffer in the end, then, Meg, is you.",
        "Meg: Well, thanks for the advice.",
        "Paul: You should take it.",
        "Meg: Somebody needs to hold them accountable.",
        "Paul: Well, it doesn't need to be you.",
        "Emily: Hi. Meg, what are you doing? I -- I thought you had Eliza until tomorrow.",
        "Paul: Yeah, the plans changed. Where's Liberty? Heh.",
        "Emily: Hi. Hi. She's, uh, at the diner. Mwah! I wanted her to have a chance to talk to her mom.",
        "Meg: I heard you guys are gonna adopt her baby.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Eliza's gonna have a little baby brother or little baby sister. Isn't that amazing?",
        "Meg: Well, you're very lucky. I'm happy for you.",
        "Emily: Do you mind telling me what that was about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You know that our father and I aren't thrilled that you're giving the baby to Paul and Emily.",
        "Liberty: Really? Because I haven't heard you say it like 100 times.",
        "Janet: We're not the only ones. Ask anybody in town.",
        "Liberty: Mom, they're -- so they're not the most popular people in Oakdale. Everyone has flaws.",
        "Janet: \"Flaws\"? Sweetheart, Emily is vicious, and Paul has been locked up in a padded cell.",
        "Liberty: Okay, that was a long time ago. It's different now. And they're really good to me, Mom. And plus, I would much rather give the baby to them than those nerds that Uncle Ralphie brought around. And why are we even talking about this, Mom? It's settled. It's settled.",
        "Janet: I think you should reconsider.",
        "Liberty: I think I should go is what I think.",
        "Janet: Wait. Hold on. Just listen to my idea, okay?",
        "Liberty: Go.",
        "Janet: Okay. But listen with an open mind.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Good night.",
        "Janet: No, please, wait. All right, okay, okay. How would you feel if Jack and I adopted the baby and raised it as our own? I know it's a little unusual.",
        "Liberty: Are you sure that you don't need a padded cell? Because that is the craziest thing that I have ever heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey! What are you guys doing up? It's late.",
        "Faith: They woke up. I told them what happened.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Damian: Hey. There's nothing to worry about, okay? He's gone. No one is going to hurt you.",
        "Lily: Damian -- do you think that you could give us some time alone?",
        "Damian: Of course. Yeah. I'll, uh -- I'll see you all later.",
        "Lily: Come here, buddy. Mm.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: There's something that we all need to talk about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Sweetie, let me explain how this will work.",
        "Liberty: I don't want to hear how it will work.",
        "Janet: Don't you want to make sure that you baby is well taken care of?",
        "Liberty: Mom, it will be.",
        "Janet: Better than I took care of you?",
        "Liberty: That's not fair!",
        "Janet: Sweetie, and this baby will have Jack, too. And you know he's such a good father.",
        "Liberty: What? That's not the point at all!",
        "Janet: I thought you'd want your baby to be in good hands.",
        "Liberty: Not in your hands, Mom. 'Cause I don't want to be involved, and then I would have to be. And I don't want -- I don't want to live in the same house as the baby.",
        "Janet: But, Honey, you'll be going to college in a year.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, if I get in.",
        "Janet: Oh, you will.",
        "Liberty: Not if I mess up the SATs or my final year of high school because I've been forced to just obsess about this baby all the time.",
        "Janet: This is a big decision, Libby.",
        "Liberty: I know. Mom, I made the decision. I'm giving it to Paul and Emily. And I -- I want to go back to my life.",
        "Janet: Honey, this baby will always be a part of your life, just like you'll always be a part of mine.",
        "Liberty: But I don't want to have the same life as you, Mom! I don't! I want to do the things that you weren't able to do. Don't you understand that?",
        "Janet: I understand that your feelings will change once you have this baby.",
        "Liberty: No, they won't, Mom. I want the baby to have a good life, but I don't want to be a part of it. Please try and accept that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, what's next? Uh, Eliza's gonna stay with us while Meg figures out a way to get him back?",
        "Paul: That ship has already sailed. Damian moved right in on Lily before Holden's side of the bed was even cold.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Emily: What's she gonna do now?",
        "Paul: I think she's gonna tear a page from the Emily Stewart guide and try and get revenge for being rejected.",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: Excuse me. I'm not the one who got Dusty and Damian to nearly kill each other to win back my lost love.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know, but I almost pulled that off.",
        "Emily: You did.",
        "Paul: Yes, I did.",
        "Emily: You did. And I was pretty impressed by that, if I must say so myself.",
        "Paul: I impressed myself. Meg --",
        "Emily: What, what?",
        "Paul: -- Is turning into me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you want?",
        "Damian: I needed to talk to you.",
        "Meg: If you want me to forget how you lied about the handwriting analysis --",
        "Damian: That's all over, Meg.",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: You'd like it to be.",
        "Damian: You haven't heard?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Damian: You know that woman who came to the bank with the letter she said was from Holden?",
        "Meg: Yeah. What about her?",
        "Damian: Well, she was married to the man who demanded a ransom for Holden's return.",
        "Meg: How do you know that?",
        "Damian: Because he invaded Lily's house tonight with a gun. He held Faith hostage.",
        "Meg: Oh, my God.",
        "Damian: Everyone's safe. Don't worry. The man's dead.",
        "Meg: I'm glad that no one was hurt.",
        "Damian: So am I. But now we know that he and his wife were both con artists. They never had Holden. They just wanted everyone to believe that he was alive in order to get money from his family.",
        "Meg: Thank you for telling me. But you could have called.",
        "Damian: I wanted to see you in person.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Damian: Because I thought you should hear it from me.",
        "Meg: Hear what?",
        "Damian: I asked Lily to marry me. Now, I know you might think it's sudden.",
        "Meg: Why, because her husband just died?",
        "Damian: That's why she isn't sure she should say yes yet. She wants to talk to the children first.",
        "Meg: Ah. Lily thinking about somebody else but herself. That's news.",
        "Damian: You don't really mean that.",
        "Meg: Does she really think that Holden's kids are gonna accept this?",
        "Damian: She's hoping they will. And so am I.",
        "Meg: Well, I have news for you. There is no way in hell that's gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, Mom, what's going on?",
        "Lily: I know you guys all know how important Damian is to me. He's been so wonderful since your daddy died. And he's been very protective of all of you children.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Damian's been great.",
        "Lily: I know that some of you haven't felt very comfortable with him being around. I know you're wondering what he's doing here, if he were trying to take your daddy's place.",
        "Faith: Isn't he?",
        "Lily: Faith, he saved your life tonight.",
        "Faith: I know. I thanked him. It doesn't mean I want him moving in or anything.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Faithy.",
        "Faith: I'm just being honest.",
        "Lily: I want you to be honest. I want you all to tell me exactly how you feel about Damian.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Lily: Because he asked me to marry him tonight.",
        "Faith: What did you say?",
        "Lily: I said that I couldn't give him an answer until I spoke to all of you.",
        "Faith: So that's what this is about -- whether or not you should marry Damian?",
        "Lily: So what do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: We got trapped in a root cellar. How crazy is that? And no one knew we were still in the house, so we tried to knock the door down, and then -- then the whole thing collapsed on us.",
        "Doctor: You and your husband are very lucky to be here. Mr. Holden, can you hear me? Don't worry. We'll take good care of him.",
        "Maeve: Thank you. Thank you. Renee? Oh, my God! Oh, my God!",
        "Renee: It has been way too long.",
        "Maeve: I'm sorry we lost touch. It was Eb. He didn't want me close to people. I'm so sorry.",
        "Renee: Yeah, he's some piece of work.",
        "Maeve: Renee, please, please, don't tell anyone who I am. If Eb finds out that I'm here, he'll kill me. Please, please, don't -- don't tell them I'm here! Don't tell them. Shh!",
        "Holden: Lily -- Lily, where are you? Lily, I need you.",
        "Maeve: Is he okay?",
        "Cop 1: Have you seen this woman? She goes by the name of Maeve Stone. You were the maid of honor at her wedding.",
        "Renee: I haven't seen her in years.",
        "Cop 2: If you do see her, call 911 right away. She could be dangerous.",
        "Maeve: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Renee: Maeve, what is going on?",
        "Maeve: I don't have time to tell you the whole truth. I -- I got to go. But I will keep in touch. I'll let you know what's going on. Oh, my God. Tell him I'm sorry I couldn't say a proper goodbye. Take good care of him. He saved my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: You're gonna marry Damian?",
        "Lily: Not if you don't want me to.",
        "Luke: She doesn't need our permission.",
        "Lily: I would never do anything to hurt any of you. Nothing is more important to me than the four of you.",
        "Luke: We know that.",
        "Faith: But you want to marry him?",
        "Lily: I think so.",
        "Natalie: Does this mean you don't love Daddy anymore?",
        "Lily: Of course not. I love your daddy so much, and I miss him terribly. But I am grateful that Damian can take care of us in a way that your daddy can't anymore.",

        "Faith: Does he make you happy?",
        "Lily: He makes me feel comfortable and peaceful in a way that I didn't think was possible without your father. Luke, what do you think?",

        "Janet: Nobody's gonna care after the first five minutes.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, they will. I'll know that the kid in the room next door is my baby, and I can't live like that.",

        "Meg: Lily is unfinished business that he has to tie up. And once he does once she says no, he's gonna realize that he's better off without that baggage, and he'll want a simpler, less twisted relationship.",
