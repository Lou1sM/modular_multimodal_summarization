        "Carly calls Hal and they get the sketch distributed within 100 miles of Oakdale. Just when she's about to give up, Parker finds the pen with St. Genevieve Hospital's logo on it in the trash. Julia convinces Jack that she has a job in Louisville and they get ready to move. While Julia is quitting her job and getting her last paycheck, Greta confronts her and threatens to turn her in. Once she leaves, a policeman posts the poster with her and Jack's picture on it. Henry gets too drunk while he's dining with Nikki and Jordan helps bail her out. They go to the pond and Nikki calls Jennifer, leaving a message that she should come out there, which kind of irritates Jordan, but he's glad she did it. Meanwhile, the boiler has exploded at BRO and Mike has helped Jennifer get it fixed enough until a plumber can come out the next day. Noting Mike's ripped pants, Jennifer is inspired and she cuts the rest of his pants, creating the first line for her new label. While she's taking his picture, they get close. Nikki calls and when she hears Mike's voice in the background, she's mad. Dusty's boxer is not very good, but the guy sparring with him is who Dusty wants. When he takes his gear off, it's Aaron. Dominic mistakes Lily for Rose when she is dining with Craig, Craig perpetuating it so Lily can get close to him and find out what's really going on with the boxing."

        "Jennifer: Uh, sure, yeah, call me back. We might have it under control anyway. Thanks. You fixed it?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I rigged it. But I think it'll hold until they can replace a part.",
        "Jennifer: Well, pardon my ignorance, but when something explodes, isn't there usually, like, smoking rubble, flames, stuff like that?",
        "Mike: You got lucky. It was a small explosion.",
        "Jennifer: So we're safe until they can send somebody out?",

        "Mike: You were just looking out for your sister.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I think I might have overdone it. I mean, Nikki's love life is non of my business.",
        "Mike: She's a big girl. She can look after herself.",

        "Craig: Come on, you can't miss her -- she's bearing twins. Hmm?",

        "Jack: But you want to move anyway? I mean, come on -- this is our home, right?",
        "Julia: Right, but it will be home wherever we go, because it's you, and me, and J.J., and that what matters, right?",
        "Jack: No, I get that. I do. What I don't get is why -- why you're acting like we're being chased out of town.",
        "Julia: We're not. Okay. But Greta Williams, the social worker, is going to be breathing down our neck, you know? If that's what you want --",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Jack: No, let the machine get it. It's Frank with my work schedule.",

        "Mike: And I should have to explain myself to her because?",
        "Jennifer: Well, no, no, you don't. It's just that, you know -- I mean, she has a thing for you, you know that.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, it must be hell being Mike Kasnoff -- women constantly throwing themselves at you.",
        "Mike: Nobody's throwing themselves at me, except for maybe a telemarketer or two.",

        "Mike: What are you talking about? They're practically falling off.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but in all the right places.",
        "Mike: Well, a few more trips to the laundry and it will be the Salvation Army for these babies.",
        "Jennifer: You're kidding? No, you're not going throw those away, are you?",
        "Mike: They're ripped. If I keep wearing them, people are gonna start tossing coins into my coffee cup.",
        "Jennifer: You are clueless. There's a huge market for ripped jeans right now. You could make a fortune in the fashion world.",
        "Mike: Selling these? You're nuts.",

        "Nikki: I think we're starting to attract a little attention.",
        "Jordan: Starting? Nikki, the maitre'd is taking bets on who's going to pass out first. Guys --",

        "Rosanna: So, this woman, the woman from the water park, she tracks you down here, and the babysitter tells her to go to Snyder pond --",
        "Carly: Yeah. And that's the last anybody's seen of her. And why didn't she make it to the pond? What if something happened to her?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know, I don't know. I think there is something going on here that we don't fully understand. Look, she tracked you down here, she's gonna come back. You have to believe that.",

        "Babysitter: Oh, no, I'm the sitter. Carly's not here.",
        "Julia: Not a book, no. A magazine. It was a magazine, and the lead story was the \"top ten best places to live in America.\"",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Julia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Well, I tell you what, if St. Genevieve isn't on that list, it should be. 'Cause I think it's pretty great. I think it's a great place.",

        "Dusty: It's not fixed. A little lopsided. What are you so worried about?",
        "Lucy: I just don't want him to blow this for us, you know? We have a lot riding on this.",

        "Jack: Okay, I know we both have crazy exes, but I honestly believe that chapter is over, Julia. You've got to believe it, too.",

        "Jack: Yes, and I meant that.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, that's how I feel all the time -- always. I'm anxious, Jack. I keep thinking that, you know, somebody's gonna come in and turn our lives upside-down.",
        "Jack: Listen, the best thing that could have happened to us, believe it or not, was les walking into our wedding. I believe that, because he's not the husband anymore. He's not calling the shots, because now, I'm the husband.",
        "Julia: What if he finds out that we got married under an assumed name, Jack, or that you used a fake I.D.? He could cause a lot of problems with J.J.",
        "Jack: You are thinking of every possible worst-case scenario. No wonder you're so anxious.",

        "Jack: Listen, if you're worried about Greta Williams, I'm gonna handle Greta Williams.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, she's already suspicious. She's already suspicious, and she's snooping around in our business, and it makes me feel like the walls are closing in on me. I need to get out of here as soon as possible.",
        "Jack: Well, Julia, how -- how soon is soon? You got a son who's on a camping trip.",
        "Julia: We'll pick him up on our way out of town.",

        "Babysitter: I've told you everything. She was looking for Mrs. Snyder, but she thought Jack's wife was named Julia, and she said she had information about Mr. Snyder.",
        "Carly: And you're sure that she didn't give a name?",
        "Babysitter: No, no, I told you, and I forgot to ask. I mean, I figured she was coming down to the pond to look for you, she would tell you everything you needed to know then.",
        "Hal: Well, what about her demeanor? Was she happy, was she sad? Was she nervous?",
        "Babysitter: I don't know. She seemed normal. Look, I really need to be going if we're done here. I have a huge paper due.",

        "Carly: So I'm right back where I started from?",
        "Hal: Not quite. Still, we've got the sketch. We're gonna post it. We'll let it get out there for awhile.",

        "Jack: Sit down, sit down. What is so horrible that is gonna happen that we can't take one more day to think this through?",
        "Julia: I've thought about it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, obviously, and you've worked yourself into a complete panic. Is it because you don't trust that I'm not gonna protect you?",
        "Julia: No, I do, I do.",
        "Jack: I just don't get why you would want to take J.J. out of school after -- he just started, honey. He's totally used to his teacher. I got this job because -- I owe Frank $1,500, darling. We haven't even talked about your job.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, here's the thing that I wanted to tell you about my job. I have this friend that I went to school with. She's a really great girl, and she's a doctor in Louisville, Kentucky, at one of the best hospitals in the state. I asked her to put in a good word for me, and she said that I can start there at the nursing program as soon as we get there. So --",
        "Jack: -- We can start a new life in Louisville, Kentucky. Is it on one of those top-ten lists of places to live? Because if it's not, what's the point?",
        "Julia: It'll probably be great. It will definitely be fine. And you know what? If it's not, we can pick up and go someplace else?",
        "Jack: Turn J.J. into one of those kids that starts a new school every year just 'cause his parents can't find the perfect place to hang their hats?",
        "Julia: Yeah, but Jack, come on! What is the bottom line? The bottom line is if we're happy, then he's gonna be happy. We can have a better life there.",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Julia: Do this for me. Please? Do you know how long it's been since I haven't felt anxious. I hate living like this, constantly looking over my shoulder. I mean, I want -- I want to be calm. I want to be that person again for you and for J.J. Most importantly, honey, for myself. You know, this job, it's waiting for me. It's there, and I don't know if I'm ever gonna have an opportunity like this again.",
        "Jack: All right. Fine, fine. We'll do it, we'll do it. You sold me.",
        "Julia: Thank you for saying yes.",

        "Nikki: You know, she wants to hate you, so she plays the ice queen.",
        "Jordan: Oh, so you mean it's just an act?",
        "Nikki: I've seen the way she looks at you when she thinks you're not looking. She's so not over you.",
        "Jordan: So what should I do? Do I leave her alone until she's over being mad at me, or do I force her to deal with me and risk losing her for good?",
        "Nikki: Let's look at this like a case, okay? What do you know? That she loves you, right?",
        "Jordan: Right, right. But -- but she's too damn mad to give in. Da da da da da da da well, it looks like our party animal is trying to bust loose. Come on, partner. Let's take a little walk here, okay? Come on. Now breathe.",

        "Mike: This is a design?",
        "Jennifer: Come on. You look how every guy secretly wants to look -- a little dangerous, a little street. The urban animal in his natural habitat.",

        "Jordan: So why did you call her?",
        "Nikki: You don't stay mad at somebody you don't care about. On the emotional spectrum, anger is right up there next to passion.",
        "Jordan: Really? They didn't teach us that at our lady of mercy. But I don't suppose you informed Jennifer that I was here when you invited her?",
