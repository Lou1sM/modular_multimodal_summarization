        "Lucinda: Now, you say that you and Lily have to take one step at a time, but there's such a thing as fool-hearted caution, darling. You both know you belong together. You've been back in bed together.",
        "Holden: You know what? As close as we are, talking to you about this stuff is still unnerving.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, then don't waste your time talking to me. Go find her, pull out all the stops. You're good at that.",
        "Luke: Good at what?",
        "Lucinda: Hey.",
        "Holden: At protecting my family. At least I hope I am.",
        "Luke: Well, you found me. And you know, you saved me. So I guess that's proof right there.",
        "Lucinda: Hello, kid. I should smack you before I kiss you, but I'm not going to. I'm glad that you're home safe.",
        "Luke: Yeah, my mom told me you had a bit of a scare down in Mexico yourself.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, well, that wretched Keith. Anyway, he's not going to be around anymore, so --",
        "Luke: Why do you say that? What's wrong with Keith?",
        "Holden: Keith put you both in danger, and he knows it. So he's probably off running in South America somewhere.",
        "Luke: What, wait, hold on, wait -- no, no, what happened to me wasn't Keith's fault. He had no idea I snuck onto the plane.",
        "Lucinda: Well, neither did I. But that doesn't mean that he has to run away now.",
        "Luke: Well, he would only do that if he was in some sort of trouble. Okay, what kind of trouble is he in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Oh, Lily, you're so beautiful. I was so afraid that I was never going to see you again. I mean, you have no idea what I had to go through to get back to you.",
        "Lily: Back to me?",
        "Keith: Yeah. So -- so Luke's okay? You found him and everything?",
        "Lily: How dare you ask about him. How dare you come here.",
        "Keith: What's the matter? What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: I want you to get out! I want you to get out and never come back!",

        "Emily: Did you find out why your flight was delayed?",
        "Paul: Sick pilot.",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Paul: I told them I know how to fly a plane.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, see, I don't think your license applies to jumbo jets.",
        "Paul: A plane's a plane. How hard could it be?",
        "Emily: I'll tell the passengers. You know what? I'm secretly happy your flight's delayed, because I'm not ready to let you go yet.",
        "Paul: Well then, come with me.",
        "Emily: I plan on it.",
        "Paul: No, I mean now, on this trip.",
        "Emily: I -- I can't. I mean, I -- I wish I could, but come on, I've got to stay back here and get things squared away while you're over there finding us a place to live, remember?",
        "Paul: I promise you, I'll find you a beautiful villa you'll fall in love with.",
        "Emily: I don't need much, you know? A comfortable bed, beautiful view. Jennifer's going to be the picky one.",
        "Paul: Naw, nothing's too good for either one of you. This is just what the doctor ordered, though. We're going to have a wonderful time.",
        "Emily: You're right, you're right. This is what Jennifer needs. She needs to be far away from this town and all the memories of her child. But just know that it's going to take her sometime to adjust. Your sister's grieving.",
        "Paul: I know. But if she stays here, there's too big a risk she'll find out her baby's alive.",

        "Dusty: Two for Tampa, Florida. The name's Donovan.",
        "Counter agent: And a Ms. Munson?",

        "Dusty: So far, so good.",
        "Jennifer: I just hope this isn't a dead end.",
        "Dusty: Thank you. You gotta think positive. I mean, Kristin Thompson was working the Neonatal unit the night your baby was born. If she can lead us to concrete proof that Rory is actually your kid --",
        "Jennifer: Then I will come back a very happy woman. And I'll prove to everyone that I'm not crazy, and I will have my son back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You handed my baby over to a complete stranger? What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Nurse #1: She said that she'd been your sitter for several months. She knew your name. She called the baby Rory. They seemed comfortable with each other.",
        "Carly: Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This person, this girl, what did she look like? Was she blonde? Young? Short hair?",
        "Nurse #1: Yeah, yeah, that's her.",
        "Carly: It's Gwen. Of course, of course, it was Gwen!",
        "Nurse #1: So then you do know her.",
        "Carly: She's not my baby-sitter! She is someone who's been fighting me for custody of Rory, and now, thanks to you, she's got him. Jack? Jack, it's me. You gotta get back to the doctor's office right now. Gwen was here. She's got Rory. She's taken him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Shh, okay. Just -- I need a minute, okay? I've got to think. We've got to come up with a plan where we're going to go first. I know you're scared, okay? [ Baby cries ] No, shh. Shh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, little man. Hey, I'm scared, too, okay? We're going to be okay. I'm going to take care of you. [ Police sirens ] Okay, that didn't take a long time. Um, that's okay. We can deal with this. We just -- we just need -- wait, we need some -- we need some help. [ Baby cries ] Shh, everything's going to be okay. We just -- we just need some help. [ Baby cries ] Shh. I know who I should call. There's only one person left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, I got cops all over this building. If she's here, she's not going to get out. And if she left, we got security tapes, honey. It'll tell us exactly when she left and hopefully the direction she headed.",
        "Carly: Jack, she's gone. She's long gone. And I'm telling you, she planned this whole thing. I'm sure it was her who made the phone call. They called, they said that they were from the clinic in Switzerland. I'm sure that's how she got me out of the room.",
        "Jack: Did Gwen give you any indication where she might be going?",
        "Nurse #1: No. She said she was going to wait for Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Carly: She's pretending to be our baby-sitter.",
        "Jack: Did she have a suitcase with her, a backpack?",
        "Nurse #1: No, not that I noticed. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: If Gwen is planning on leaving town, honey, she probably went back to her place to pack up some stuff for the trip.",
        "Carly: We have to stop her. Because if she gets on a bus -- if she gets on a train, you know what it means. It means that we may never see Rory again.",
        "Jack: Okay, come on, that's not going to happen.",
        "Carly: What if it already did, Jack? What are we going to do then?",
        "Jack: Don't panic, all right? We'll find him. I promise you, wherever he is, wherever they go, we'll find them.",

        "Will: What's wrong?",
        "Gwen: Look, you said you'd be there for me, right? That if I ever needed something from you, you'd be there. Did you mean that?",
        "Will: Sure, I meant it. What's going on?",
        "Gwen: Will, I need you. Um, I'm on the roof. Can you please come here? I'll explain everything.",
        "Will: First you gotta tell me what's wrong.",
        "Gwen: Just come, Will, please? And don't let anybody know. But if you don't show up -- just please come, Will.",

        "Luke: If something is wrong with Keith, I wish you'd tell me.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, it's nothing. Nothing that you should concern yourself with. Just be glad he's out of the picture.",
        "Luke: Look, don't treat me like a little kid, okay? I can handle the truth. Now, do you guys even know where he is?",
        "Holden: No, we don't. No one knows where he is.",
        "Luke: Maybe Blanca and that guy got him, you know? Maybe he really needs help.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, from my experience with him on my little jaunt with him, he doesn't want or need our help.",
        "Luke: How do you know that?",
        "Lucinda: Holden, come on, he should know. Everybody else knows.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I don't know what you think happened down in Mexico, but you need to let me explain this.",
        "Lily: I don't want to hear any more of your lies. You put my son's life at risk, and you left him down there to fend for himself.",
        "Keith: What? Lily, I spent the last two weeks down there looking for him.",
        "Lily: I don't believe you. I don't believe anything you say anymore. I want you to stay away from me. I want you to stay away from my family.",
        "Keith: Lily, listen --",
        "Lily: Please, I just --",
        "Keith: I would never, ever, ever leave Luke high and dry.",
        "Lily: Please, just let me go. Let me go.",
        "Keith: You know, I had no idea that he was even gone, that he was on my plane, till after he disappeared.",
        "Lily: You think that lets you off the hook? My son wouldn't have been held hostage in a foreign country if you hadn't taken my mother down to that clinic. You put both of their lives at risk.",
        "Keith: Your mother left me no choice.",
        "Lily: Oh, I heard it. I've heard it all. How she blackmailed you to get you to do what she wants. If you hadn't been breaking the law, she would have nothing to hold over you.",
        "Keith: I know. And I feel like hell about all of that. You know, I would never intentionally leave Luke anywhere. But you know, once I realized that he had stowed away on the plane, I went looking for him. And I tracked him down to the clinic. Next thing I know, somebody clubbed me over the head. Two hours later, I woke up in the desert. It's the truth.",
        "Lily: I don't know what's true anymore.",
        "Keith: Well, Lily, I'm telling you, they left me for dead in the middle of the desert. And I would've been dead hadn't this -- this farmer come by, and he revived me. And then I continued to look for Luke, and the only thing that kept me going was knowing that I had to bring him back to you. You know, 'cause I would never, ever turn my back on him or you. Come on, you gotta believe me. I'm telling you the truth. I swear.",

        "Jennifer: No, no, that's okay. I just want to get going.",
        "Dusty: You're one of the most impatient people I know. You remind me of me.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I don't know how -- I don't know how to tell you how much it means to me that you believe me. That you're here with me. I don't think that I can ever repay you for this.",
        "Dusty: Seeing you get your kid back, that'll be enough for me.",
        "Jennifer: Do you really think it's possible?",
        "Dusty: Are you all of a sudden having doubts?",
        "Jennifer: No. No, it's just -- it's been -- there's just been so many walls, and I'm just afraid that this is going to be another one.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. I'm telling you, I am a cynic, and I'm keeping the faith. So don't lose yours, not now.",
        "Jennifer: I just -- I just want the search to be over.",
        "Dusty: It will be, hopefully, soon.",
        "Jennifer: But what if -- what if Nurse Thompson doesn't even want to talk?",
        "Dusty: You're a mother searching for her baby. I'm sure you're going to convince her to tell you anything you need. Let's go get some trashy magazines.",

        "Holden: Now is not the right time.",
        "Luke: No, dad. You can't just drop something on me like that and not explain it. What has happened to Keith?",
        "Lucinda: All right, darling. Keith was using his plane, the one that you were learning to fly in, to transport human organs across the border for sale in the black market.",
        "Luke: No way.",
        "Holden: He was working with Blanca, the woman who kidnapped you.",
        "Luke: Are you sure?",
        "Lucinda: It's true. Unfortunately, it's true.",
        "Luke: It's just so hard to believe, you know? We had our differences, he wasn't perfect, but I -- I can't imagine him doing something like that. Maybe he didn't know that he was a part of it all.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, he absolutely knew he was a part of it. That's why he flew me to Mexico.",
        "Holden: When you stowed away on the plane.",
        "Lucinda: He agreed to take me to the clinic in Mexico, wait for me while I had my cancer treatments, and in return, I was not going to tell your mother what he was up to.",
        "Luke: Why would Keith do something like that?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm sure he was very well paid.",
        "Holden: Luke, he admitted his part in it.",
        "Luke: So where is he now?",
        "Lucinda: He's disappeared. When there's trouble, off he goes. That's the kind of man he is.",
        "Luke: I don't think so. I think he disappeared because something happened to him.",

        "Keith: Lily, you've gotta believe me. What do I gotta do, show you my scars?",
        "Lily: What about Luke's scars? Or my mother's? Or those poor people who had to sell their organs to support their families? How about them?",
        "Keith: I had no idea that they were live donors.",
        "Lily: You didn't know because you didn't care enough to ask.",
        "Keith: I thought I was saving lives. They would hand me a cooler, and I'd take it to a clinic where I thought somebody was getting a second chance in life. I had no idea that people were being used and being hurt. And I would never put Luke in harm's way. You know, the whole thing was a big mistake. It all got out of hand. If I could go back in time and correct it, I would. But I can't. The only thing I can do is try and get you to forgive me. Will you?",

        "Carly: Did she have a baby with her?",
        "Mechanic: She was carrying something, but I wasn't close enough to see what it was.",
        "Jack: When did she leave about?",
        "Mechanic: I don't know. Half an hour. Maybe a little less.",
        "Jack: Okay, did you talk to her? Did she give you any indication where she might be going?",
        "Mechanic: Nope. But she did look scared. Has she done something wrong?",

        "Jack: No, that's not going to happen. We're watching every route out of this city. She can't get on a bus, she can't get on a train, she can't get on a plane. She doesn't have a car.",
        "Carly: But she could steal one, Jack! I don't know, she's a stupid kid! She doesn't know what she's doing! She could have an accident, and anything could happen!",
        "Jack: No, she's going to be careful. She's going to make sure that nothing happens to that little boy.",
        "Carly: How do you know that?",
        "Jack: Because, Carly, Gwen's his mother.",

        "Gwen: I took him, Will. I had to.",
        "Will: You stole the baby?",
        "Gwen: No, it's not stealing if he's mine. And he is. He's my son.",
        "Will: This is so wrong! You have to take him back right now! Gwen, you're going to ruin all your chances. You're going to mess up everything.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, what about his chances? I have to keep him safe, don't I? And he's not safe with her.",
        "Will: With who?",
        "Gwen: Carly. I found out from my mom she killed her own little brother when she was a little kid, Will.",
        "Will: That's crazy.",
        "Gwen: No, Will, she's crazy. I can't let him stay with her after finding out something like that.",
        "Will: You don't just steal a baby, Gwen! The cops are going to be looking for you! My dad already got the call! Don't you understand? When they catch you, you're going to go to jail.",
        "Gwen: Well, then, they just can't catch me.",
        "Will: I don't believe this.",
        "Gwen: Look, Will, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drag you into this. I really didn't.",
        "Will: What do you expect me to do?",
        "Gwen: Look, just take me to the closest out-of-town bus station. I'm sure the cops are already all over the city. I just need to get on a bus and get as far away as I can.",
        "Will: That's an insane idea! They're going to be looking for you everywhere. And once you cross state lines, the feds get involved, and you don't have a chance!",
        "Gwen: Don't say that.",
        "Will: You're going to go to jail, Gwen.",

        "Will: Gwen, listen to me. If you want to get out of this, you have to go to the police right now.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm not turning myself in.",
        "Will: It's better than running.",
        "Gwen: Look, Jack Snyder is the police, Will.",
        "Will: Then we'll go straight to my dad.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, he just is one of Jack Snyder's best friends. Never mind. I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'll figure it out on my own. It's my problem, not yours.",

        "Dusty: We thought we'd check it out.",
        "Emily: Oh, sort of spur of the moment, no?",
        "Dusty: Well, with Jen leaving to Europe and everything, we've gotta find someone local to generate designs.",
        "Emily: Right, right. Are you sure you're okay to travel, you know?",
        "Jennifer: You sound like Paul.",
        "Emily: Well, honey, you just got out of the hospital. Don't they say you're supposed to take it easy? Does your brother know that you're diving back into work like this?",
        "Jennifer: Emily, it's just a fashion show. I'll be sitting in the audience, it's nothing strenuous. And like we said, we would have called Paul, but Dusty, you know, just got the call a little while ago, so we didn't have time before he left.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? I bet you your brother is still at the gate, and he would want to know what you're up to. I think we should give him a call.",
        "Dusty: I don't know if it's a good time to call him. I mean, you know how he is. He'll worry. He'll get off the plane, probably. For what?",
        "Jennifer: Absolutely. Right, we don't want to mess up Paul's plans.",
        "Emily: Look, he's going to be upset if we don't tell him, okay? He's going to be upset that we're keeping this from him.",
        "Jennifer: Look, Emily, I appreciate Paul's protectiveness and your concern, but I am an adult, and I really don't need to consult you about everything that I do, unless you want me to feel like an invalid for the rest of my life.",
        "Emily: You're right, I apologize. Besides, I think your brother had his phone shut off.",

        "Emily: So, where are you going?",
        "Jennifer: Philadelphia.",

        "Emily: Huh. So, you'll be gone for a couple days?",
        "Dusty: Two, three days, tops.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. And, you know, probably be back before Paul is, and hopefully have good news to share with him about this woman.",

        "Holden: The authorities, yes, they are looking for him. And they're going to want to speak to you as soon as you feel up to it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I mean, I'll tell them everything I know, but it's not a lot.",

        "Holden: You know what, I'm not going to jump the gun here on anything.",

        "Lily: I can't deal with this right now. I have to focus on my family. I have to focus on my mother. I have to focus on Luke. They need me.",
        "Keith: Luke's okay? He wasn't hurt, though, huh?",
        "Lily: He's very weak. But with some good food and some rest, we're expecting him to get better.",

        "Gwen: Look, I played that game when I got a lawyer and I went to court and I tried to get my kid back, and what did I get? Nothing. This is my last option, Will. My mom let me down, all right? Just like you said she would.",
        "Will: What did she do?",
        "Gwen: She just wanted the money from my kid's trust fund.",

        "Will: Gwen, just stop and think this through for one minute. You've never even taken care of a baby before.",

        "Lucinda: Yeah, I do, hope so.",
        "Luke: Oh, man, I gotta tell you, if that's what came out of this whole thing down in Mexico, it was worth it.",
        "Lucinda: It would just be great if your mom would just come to her senses and know that he's the only man for her, and vice versa. Good to see you. We were worried about you. You scared us.",
        "Luke: I've got nobody to blame but myself. Getting drunk and getting on that plane, it was just so stupid.",
        "Lucinda: It was.",
        "Luke: But what I want to know is why you wanted Keith to take you to that clinic.",
        "Lucinda: I did something stupid, too.",
        "Luke: Did you really think that they were going to help you down there?",
        "Lucinda: Well, honey, alternative medicine is a big subject and very interesting, a lot of pluses, and we can talk about it another time, right? But that place, that place -- learn and move on. And I just would like you to be in the loop because you're old enough to know. I'm going into the hospital for more surgery tomorrow morning.",
        "Luke: Surgery? I thought the cancer was getting better.",

        "Keith: What's that supposed to mean? Am I missing something?",
        "Lily: I think you should just go.",
        "Keith: No. No, not until you answer me. Are you two back together again? I see. Listen, I'll give you some time to think about it, and I'm going to come back, because we're not done, Lily. We can't be.",

        "Jack: Cool down, Carly, cool down. You aren't doing any help by attacking her.",
        "Iris: You're damn right. I'm going to sue the cops for harassment, and I'm going to sue your wife for assault!",
        "Jack: You're not going to sue anybody for anything. What you're going to do is you're going to sit down and you're going to tell us what you know about Gwen's activities in the last eight hours, or I'll throw your butt in jail for impeding a police investigation.",
        "Iris: I'm not going to sit down because I'm not staying long, okay? I told you, I don't know anything!",
        "Carly: Stop lying, Iris. I know the two of you are in this together. What is this, is this your payback for what happened to your baby?",
        "Iris: If I was going to steal your baby for payback, honey, I would've done it a long time ago.",

        "Iris: Nothing. I haven't seen her all day.",

        "Iris: Yeah, okay. I told ya, I don't know anything, and I certainly didn't know that she was planning on taking your baby, otherwise I would've told her that she was shooting herself in the foot big time, all right? So -- so, you satisfied? Can I go now?",
        "Jack: No, not yet. Where do you think she went?",
        "Iris: I don't know. You seem to think that she and I are bosom buddies or something. I hardly even know her.",
        "Jack: Take a guess, then! Tell me where you think she went!",
        "Hal: Wherever that is, I think Will's with her, and maybe helping her out.",

        "Gwen: I can't let you do that. You run away with me, you've officially ruined your life.",
        "Will: That's my life to ruin. I'm not going to let you leave on some insane trip without at least seeing you get settled and make sure you're okay.",
        "Gwen: No, Will, it's like you said -- what I'm doing is illegal. If you help me, that makes you a criminal.",
        "Will: Well, I'll take my chances.",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Will: Yes, you do. You wanted options? There's only one that makes sense. Two of us can take care of him better than one.",

        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: You hear that, little guy? Will's taking us to New York.",
        "Will: Do you have a friend there, or family, someone that can help you get settled, to help you find a place?",
