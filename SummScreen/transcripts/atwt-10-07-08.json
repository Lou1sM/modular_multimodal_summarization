        "[Paul imagining a dead James speaking to him]",
        "Paul: Get off my bed. You're not real. I know that. I know you're dead.",
        "James: Well, maybe to the rest of the world I'm dead, Paul, but in your mind, I'm alive and well for as long as you need me.",
        "Paul: Well, then you can go, 'cause I don't need you. I never did.",
        "James: Mm-hmm. You and I both know that's not true. You're weak, Paul. You've been coddled by women all of your life way too much. First your mother. Now Meg. You want to spend your life like this, shackled up, popping pills? You want your child to grow up --",
        "Paul: You stay away from my child!",
        "James: Well, then you get it together, take control of yourself once.",
        "Paul: I am in control of myself! Stop laughing at me!",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Nurse: How are you feeling, Mr. Ryan?",
        "Paul: I'm fine. Just -- I got a little frustrated. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.",
        "Nurse: I can give him a sedative.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no. I don't want a sedative. I just -- I want you near me, please.",
        "Meg: You sure that's what you want?",
        "Paul: Yes. Come on, Meg, I've been praying for you to be close to me for so long, and here you are, so please, I don't want you to leave the room again.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? I will let you know if there's a problem, but I really don't think there will be any problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm the one who found you. After that, everything changed so fast. There was so much I needed to say to you.",
        "Dusty: You can tell me now. I'm right here.",
        "Emily: It's too late. I went to your memorial service, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry. I know it's not a lot, but that's all I got.",
        "Emily: You knew you were gonna disappear. You knew it! You knew what I was gonna think! That you died thinking I hated you!",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I regret that.",
        "Emily: It was torture, Dusty!",
        "Dusty: Hey, you knew how I felt about you the whole time. I was in love with you.",
        "Emily: Then how could you just walk away from me?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause it was my last resort. You know, a piece of me was gone. I had to disappear to get it back.",
        "Emily: To find Johnny.",
        "Dusty: If I can get my son back, you know, I can start pulling my life back together.",
        "Emily: If you had found him, would you have come home?",
        "Dusty: Home? Home? Half this town wanted to see me dead.",
        "Emily: That's not true.",
        "Dusty: Including yourself. Including yourself.",
        "Emily: I blamed you for so many things.",
        "Dusty: You had your reasons.",
        "Emily: It all seems so insignificant now. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: It's already forgiven. And forgotten. Can you forgive me?",
        "Emily: I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was grumpy.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on, now. I only opened my mouth to change feet.",
        "Jack: I'm just a little sensitive lately. It's got nothing to do with you.",
        "Janet: You miss your job.",
        "Jack: I'm all right.",
        "Janet: No, you're not. I'm worried about you.",
        "Jack: Don't be. It's the last thing I want.",
        "Janet: Hey, you know what I was thinking? Maybe I could talk to Vienna. If I take a double shift tomorrow --",
        "Jack: I'm gonna get out of your hair. I'm gonna get out of your hair. I'll see you later.",
        "Janet: I'm off at 5:00!",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Janet: He's killing me. Ever since he lost his job, he's like -- he doesn't know what to do. He's looking at me with these puppy dog eyes. It's killing me.",
        "Vienna: Wow, you have it bad for him, don't you?",
        "Janet: You kidding me? I haven't scribbled a guy's name on a pad since 7th grade. I know. What am I gonna do?",
        "Vienna: Well, how far are you willing to take it?",
        "Janet: Come on. Look who you're talking to.",
        "Vienna: Well, then you'll do whatever it takes to make him happy.",
        "Janet: That's the problem. I haven't figured that out yet.",

        "Carly: Sit down, please. I thought you liked Janet.",
        "Sage: Do you like her?",
        "Carly: You know what? I do. And you know what else? So does your father.",
        "Sage: But she's not you.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, we talked about this. I thought you understood. Your father and I cannot be together the way you want us to be.",
        "Sage: I know. But sometimes it's weird seeing him with someone else. What if he starts to love her more than you?",
        "Carly: Sage, there are all kinds of love in this world. And your father and I, we share the most special kind, because it gave us you. And nobody will ever be able to change that.",
        "Sage: Not even Janet?",
        "Carly: No, not even Janet. And, you know what? I think that your father deserves to have someone as nice as Janet in his life. So what do you say we give her a chance, huh?",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. That's my girl. That's my pretty girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, I got your order, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: Thanks.",
        "Janet: Got you a turkey sandwich, hold the mayo, some chips, and a diet soda.",
        "Margo: I don't do diet so -- I didn't order lunch.",
        "Janet: No, you didn't. But I really need to talk to you. And this lunch is not a bribe, I swear.",
        "Margo: Good to know. Listen, I'm in the middle of a very messy investigation here, so I don't have time for chitchat.",
        "Janet: I know. That's sort of why I'm here.",
        "Margo: What, you know something about Dusty Donovan?",
        "Janet: The dead guy who's now alive? No, no, what I meant was if you are in the middle of a very difficult investigation, the man for you is Jack Snyder. If he were on this case --",
        "Margo: Jack Snyder does not work here anymore.",
        "Janet: I know that, which is why you need to give him his job back.",
        "Margo: I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, and nobody wants Jack back on the force more than I do --",
        "Janet: Except Jack.",
        "Margo: Except Jack. Yes. But he really left us no choice.",
        "Janet: Well, maybe if you knew the real reason why he left.",
        "Margo: No, I can't have this conversation with you.",
        "Janet: Please, he has taken the blame for something he didn't do.",
        "Margo: What does that mean? What do you mean?",
        "Janet: Am I still talking to you as Jack's friend?",
        "Margo: Um, for now, yes.",
        "Janet: All right. I know he told you the reason he resigned. He destroyed the evidence in the Leo Morrissey case.",
        "Margo: Keep talking. I'll stop you when I need to.",
        "Janet: Jack wasn't the one who destroyed the evidence. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Be careful.",
        "Jack: Oh, no daughter of mine uses a ladder to pick apples. There you go. You got it?",
        "Sage: Daddy, what are you doing here? Mommy said you would be with Janet.",
        "Jack: Janet had to work today.",
        "Sage: So does that mean you can stay with us, or do you have to work, too?",
        "Jack: How about this? How about I give the bad guys a break, and I hang out with you today?",
        "Sage: Okay, but only for today.",
        "Jack: Deal. Deal. Hey, listen, you know what? Aunt Emma says that that tree over there produces the biggest, juiciest apples in the whole orchard.",
        "Sage: Awesome!",
        "Jack: Go for it!",
        "Carly: So, when do you plan on telling her that you're not on the force anymore, Jack? She's gonna find out sooner or later. The boys already know.",
        "Jack: I will tell her, Carly. Just not today, okay? Right now, I just want to pick apples.",
        "Carly: Why, because it takes your mind off not having a job to go to?",
        "Jack: No, 'cause I want to spend some time with my daughter. Have you got a problem with that?",
        "Carly: No, not at all. You get the ladder.",
        "Jack: All right. You know, I'm starting to realize that I should be enjoying this time off, take a step back from everything, figure out what I -- what I really want.",
        "Carly: You were born to be a detective, Jack. What is there to figure out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right, so Jack gave you the evidence, and then what?",
        "Janet: And then the guilt crept in. It started eating him alive. He was so miserable, I was afraid he was gonna ask me for the evidence back, and I couldn't let that happen, because then Brad would be arrested, Liberty would blame me, and so there was -- I had to get rid of it.",
        "Margo: Janet, you realize that destroying evidence in an ongoing police investigation is a criminal action.",
        "Janet: Are you gonna arrest me?",
        "Margo: Well, I don't know --",
        "Janet: What about Jack? Come on, he is in hell here. Can't you give him the tiniest, tiniest bit of a break?",
        "Margo: I wish I could! Jack resigned. There's nothing I can do about that. There's nothing I can do to change why he chose to do so. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: So am I. Am I free to go?",
        "Margo: Please.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Janet: You said you were his friend.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, truth be told, I hate not working.",
        "Carly: I figured as much.",
        "Jack: I wake up in the morning. I make coffee. I read the paper. And then I just -- I sat around all day.",
        "Carly: You were never very good with change.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] I'm even worse when nothing changes. Every time I don't go into that station, I feel like I'm becoming less and less of the person I thought I was.",
        "Carly: Jack, why don't you go to Margo? Talk to her. Explain the situation. Try to get your job back.",
        "Jack: She has no reason to cut me a break. I broke the law. Even if she could overlook that, I don't know if I can.",
        "Carly: Well, what's the alternative?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I don't know. We don't have to talk about it. Let's not talk about it anymore. It's a beautiful day. We're hanging out with Sage. Let's just enjoy ourselves.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: Okay?",
        "Carly: Bite?",
        "Jack: There any snakes around here I should know about?",
        "Carly: Relax. Sometimes temptation is a good thing.",

        "Paul: So, what did they do with James' body?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I didn't ask.",
        "Paul: And Dusty, how's he?",
        "Meg: He's fine now.",
        "Paul: Is he here in the hospital?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Do you know where he is?",
        "Meg: I don't know where he is right now.",
        "Paul: They going to arrest me for shooting him?",
        "Meg: No, they're not. Dusty made sure that won't happen.",
        "Paul: Does that make him a hero? I need to get out of here.",
        "Meg: You'll be out of here soon enough.",
        "Paul: You are a nurse. Isn't there something you can do to kind of speed it up?",
        "Meg: Let me talk to Bob. If it's a matter of just regulating your medication, I can do that at home. Okay, I'll see what he says.",
        "Paul: Okay. That would be great.",
        "James: Very nicely done! Now, there may be hope for you yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Please.",
        "Emily: For the longest time, I was so numb. I never thought I'd get over it. Or you.",
        "Dusty: Did you?",
        "Emily: I found a way to cope. You know, I threw myself back into work.",
        "Dusty: Just work?",
        "Emily: Uh, there was a relationship with Casey Hughes.",
        "Dusty: Is he even old enough?",
        "Emily: You died. You don't get to be judgmental.",
        "Dusty: That's fair enough.",
        "Emily: So, did you ever get over what you felt for me?",
        "Dusty: I don't feel too much anymore. I don't know why.",
        "Emily: How could we hurt each other so much?",
        "Dusty: I missed you.",
        "Emily: I missed you.",

        "Courier: You're welcome.",
        "Emily: What is it?",
        "Dusty: Nobody knows I'm here.",
        "Emily: Well, maybe it's from one of your contacts who's looking for Johnny.",
        "Emily: Wow. It's beautiful. What is it? What's it say?",
        "Dusty: \"Stenbeck.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I know you're anxious to bring Paul home.",
        "Meg: I can handle it. I -- I really can.",
        "Bob: You're taking on a great responsibility.",
        "Meg: Paul is my husband, and I'm a nurse. Who is better qualified to take care of him?",
        "Bob: What if he has another episode?",
        "Meg: He won't. And even if he does, if I see any sign of trouble, I will bring him back here. You have my word.",
        "Bob: I don't know.",
        "Meg: Bob, Paul was fine before his father came back. James tortured him emotionally and physically. But James is gone now.",
        "Bob: Yeah, with the damage he did, he's anything but. Paul didn't just snap. He had a psychotic break. And his behavior's been erratic. Violent, even.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, I'll make sure he takes his medication and any therapy that he needs. But I know my husband. And I know he's gonna be better off at home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You've gotten yourself in quite a mess, Paul. Do you think Dusty would fall apart over a woman like this?",
        "Paul: If you are so obsessed with Dusty, why don't you go haunt him?",
        "James: Dustin's his own man. He doesn't need my help.",
        "Paul: What is it gonna take to get you to just leave me alone?",
        "Meg: Hey. Guess what. You are going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: It's not even English.",
        "Emily: But there's names and dates. Seems like some sort of family bible or something. Wait a minute. Didn't the Stenbecks originate in Sweden or something like that?",
        "Dusty: Who cares?",
        "Emily: I care. \"Who cares?\" What are the chances there's a decoder ring in this thing? It's a letter. Okay. Well, didn't Paul tell me something once about James and your father?",
        "Dusty: Gunnar St. Clair?",
        "Emily: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Something about them being switched at birth or something?",
        "Dusty: Gunnar St. Clair was not my father. I was raised by Burke Donovan and John Dixon.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but Gunnar is biologically your father, right? And the mother, James' mother switched the boys at birth so James could be raised a Stenbeck, but Gunnar was their real son. Technically, you're -- you're like an heir. You're Swedish royalty, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Emily, listen to me. James looted all the family money a long time ago. And this book means nothing to me.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, maybe not to you, but, I mean, if you have no interest in it, what's the harm in having me look through it?",
        "Dusty: Whatever turns you on. Just leave me out of it. I can't even remember the last time I slept.",
        "Emily: All right. I'll go. I'll get out of your hair.",
        "Dusty: No, I don't want to rush you.",
        "Emily: No, that's okay. I understand.",
        "Dusty: Hey. I don't know how long I'm gonna be in Oakdale, you know, if I get another lead on Johnny.",
        "Emily: You got to go find him. I understand.",
        "Dusty: While I'm here, I could use a friend. I think you could, too.",
        "Emily: Is that what we are, Dusty, friends?",
        "Dusty: Always.",

        "Emily: I got to, um -- I got to go.",
        "Jack: Okay, we got room for one more. Let me have the apple. You got it behind your back. Give me that.",

        "Jack: Thanks for today. You managed to take my mind off things for a while. I appreciate it.",

        "Janet: Uh, well -- oh, thanks. Al's got a little slow, so Vienna took pity on me. Wow, looks like you guys did some apple picking.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Janet: That looks like fun, huh?",
        "Sage: Dad made it so much fun.",
        "Carly: He did. Okay, I'm just gonna wash my hands, Sweetheart, and then we're gonna get going.",

        "Carly: We had a nice afternoon together, that's all.",
        "Janet: A nice afternoon? Really, that's all? Carly, I got to ask you for the umpteenth millionth time, are you sure that you're ready to let him go? Because I can't stand to get my heart broken again.",
        "Carly: Janet, I am not after Jack. I told you. I want the two of you to get together.",
        "Janet: Better not be because you like a challenge.",
        "Carly: I think I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.",
        "Janet: Well, I did. I said it. You keep saying that you want Jack and I to work things out, but then I see you two together. He's got his arm around you, and I'm starting to think that maybe that's not 100% true.",
        "Carly: Did you happen to notice the little girl who was standing next to us? All that happened today was that her father and I showed her that we can spend time together without it turning into an all-out brawl. And the last thing that I'm gonna do is worry about how that makes you feel.",
        "Jack: Everything okay in here?",
        "Carly: Fine. I'm leaving. Bye.",

        "Jack: Sure. Yeah, I'll be right over. That was Margo.",
        "Janet: Really? What did she want?",
        "Jack: She wants me to come by the station. She wants to ask me some questions, probably about an old case.",

        "Vienna: It says that this book and the letter were sent to Dusty Donovan for a very special reason and that he must contact a man by the name of Mr. Bergman in Stockholm, Sweden, and he'll explain everything to him. He's a lawyer. And there's a number here. You should call him right away.",
        "Emily: I will. I will, first thing tomorrow.",
        "Vienna: No. No, you should call him right now.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Vienna: You don't mess around with Swedish royalty.",

        "Dusty: I thought they had you strapped to a bed somewhere.",
        "Paul: Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Make it easier for you to move in on my wife.",
        "Dusty: I'm not after your wife.",
        "Paul: I knew you'd show up here for her eventually. You're never gonna get your hands on her.",
        "Dusty: Keep acting like this, they're gonna send you back to the nuthouse.",
        "Paul: Leave right now, or I will kill you, Dusty, with my bare hands.",
        "Dusty: Bare hands?",
        "Meg: Paul? Hey, what are you doing? Put that down.",
        "Paul: What is he doing here?",
        "Meg: Paul, what are you thinking?",
        "Paul: Why is here here? Why is he in my house?!",
        "Dusty: Maybe they released him too soon.",
        "Meg: Dusty, stop.",
        "Paul: Oh, wait. You're not surprised to see him? You knew he was in town?",
        "Meg: Yes, because I called him.",
        "Paul: You called him?",
        "Meg: Look, I didn't have a choice. Margo knew there had been a shooting in the lighthouse, and she was all over me. She saw that I was covering something up, and she threatened to send me to jail.",
        "Paul: All right, so you called Dusty, and he comes running to your rescue.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I wanted to keep your wife from going to jail. You should be nice to her. She's been through a lot.",
        "Paul: Don't you tell me how to treat my wife. I want you out of here. Get out of here.",
        "Meg: Dusty, please go.",
        "Dusty: You gonna be okay?",
        "Paul: Get out!",

        "Margo: I want you back on the force.",
        "Jack: You know I can't do that.",
        "Margo: Sure you can. Why not? I have new information about the situation, and if I'm willing to look the other way, why can't you?",
        "Jack: What information are you talking about?",
        "Margo: I know that you didn't destroy the evidence in the Leo Morrissey case.",
        "Jack: Who told you that?",
        "Margo: That doesn't matter.",
        "Jack: It matters to me.",
        "Margo: It was someone who decided to step up to the plate and to tell the truth at their own expense, and she makes a mean turkey on rye.",
        "Jack: Why did Janet do that?",
        "Margo: I don't know, Jack. Maybe she cares about you. Maybe she's tired of watching you mope around the house and beat yourself up for something that wasn't your fault.",
        "Jack: No, it's not as simple as that, Margo. I stole evidence, and I handed it over to a civilian. The only reason I'm not in jail right now is because of you.",
        "Margo: Well, it's not like you're coming back without, you know, penalty. You'll be on probation. I'll be very mean to you. Come on, Jack. I need you. Please, think about it.",
        "Jack: I have. I have. I have thought about it. I thought about it long before I even walked in this room. I'm sorry.",

        "Janet: You're apologizing to me?",
        "Carly: Yes. You'd think by now that I'd be good at it, but I'm not, so -- there. Its cinnamon mixed with something or other. I don't know. They said at the store that it's good for baking. I'm really sorry that I snapped at you like that. I mean, I stand by what I said, of course, but I could have been a little nicer about it.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, too.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Janet: How's your arm? Can you peel?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure.",
        "Janet: Let me put you work. Here. You know, I hate the fact that I overreacted when I saw you and Jack earlier. I feel like such an insecure, stupid, blubbering idiot. But you know what? I'm telling you, after today, maybe he'll realize just how much I care about him.",
        "Carly: What do you mean? Why after today?",
        "Jack: You want to tell me what you were thinking when you went to Margo like that?",
        "Janet: Well, I wanted --",
        "Jack: No, I know what you wanted to do, what you were trying to do. But you had no right to go behind my back.",
        "Janet: Jack, look, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. I was just trying to make things better for you.",
        "Jack: This isn't for you to fix.",
        "Janet: Yes, it is. This is my responsibility. And I told Margo that. I told her that if it wasn't your fault, that you should be allowed to have your job back.",
        "Jack: You -- you asked her for my job back?",
        "Janet: You know you never should have quit in the first place.",
        "Jack: My career is not your little project, Janet.",
        "Janet: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're taking this all wrong.",
        "Jack: I don't think I am. Why didn't you come to me and tell me what you were planning to do?",
        "Janet: Because I know you.",
        "Jack: And?",
        "Janet: And you would have said no.",
        "Jack: Exactly.",
        "Janet: Jack, that's just your pride talking.",
        "Jack: No, no. It's not. This is me. I'm talking. And if you think that this is remotely what I wanted, you're wrong.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",

        "Margo: Ugh! Voice mail. Um, Jack, hi. It's Margo. Um, listen, I'm just gonna say this as a friend, all right? Flat-out, just -- if I can get beyond what happened, so can you. So don't be an idiot. Just get back to work now. That's an order.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Where's Janet?",
        "Carly: She left. Can you blame her? You laid into her pretty hard.",
        "Jack: Excuse me? How is any of this your business?",
        "Carly: It isn't. But I happened to be standing just over there. Hard not to overhear.",
        "Jack: Are you having fun, Carly?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Yeah, are you enjoying yourself, playing matchmaker with me and Janet? You're baking pies, fixing dresses, like you guys are new best friends.",
        "Carly: I thought that she could make you happy.",
        "Jack: Yeah? Do I look happy to you?",
        "Carly: No, you don't. She went to Margo because she cares about you. She knows that you'll be happy again if you start working. We all know that.",
        "Jack: And what did I do -- what did I do to give you all the impression that I can't think for myself?",
        "Carly: That's not what this is.",

        "Paul: This has got nothing to do with James.",
        "Meg: Yes, it does. For whatever reason, he pitted you and Dusty against each other. He called him your enemy, and he's not. Please don't let James win. Look, I just want to focus on us and the baby. Can we do that, please?",
        "Paul: You and this baby mean everything to me. You're my whole world. And I love you.",
        "Meg: I love you, too. Get some rest. I promised Bob, okay? And I'm gonna call Barbara and tell her you're home.",
        "James: I told you she wasn't over Donovan.",
        "Paul: You go away.",
        "James: You better face reality, Paul. Your wife invites Dustin into your home, she asked him for help, and you allow it. You should have killed that man when you had the chance.",

        "Emily: I showed Vienna this. I was right. It's like a family bible or something. It proves the Stenbecks really are Swedish royalty.",
        "Dusty: I always knew Paul was a prince.",
        "Emily: And the letter -- the letter is from a lawyer, a Mr. Bergman from Stockholm. I called him, and he's --",

        "Emily: Hello? Dusty, have we met? Anyway, this Mr. Bergman, he's gonna contact you regarding the Stenbeck estate.",
        "Dusty: You're gonna contact Mr. Bergman, and you're gonna give him Paul's number. That way, if James has any leftovers, he knows who to call.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. You don't mean that.",
        "Dusty: Oh yeah, I do.",
        "Emily: No, you -- listen to me. James -- you cannot do everything James has done over the years without a ton of money behind you.",
        "Dusty: A lot of blood money.",
        "Emily: No, your family's money. James is dead, Dusty. And if there's a Stenbeck fortune out there, it could belong to you. All of it.",
