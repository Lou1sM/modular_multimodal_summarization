        "\r\nJake: I hope your feet never touch the ground, Mrs. McKinnon.",
        "\r\nMolly: Can I at least unpack first and put on something a little more tasty and \r\n--",
        "\r\nJake: Come on, this joint is a five-star hotel. They take care of it for you. I \r\nthink all you need to worry about is being tasty.",
        "\r\nMolly: Subtle. That's really subtle.",
        "\r\nJake: You didn't marry me for my subtlety.",
        "\r\nMolly: Mm.",
        "\r\n[Phone ringing] work is following us here, Jake. I didn't wanna see a fax for \r\ntwo weeks, but there's a pile of them on the desk.",

        "\r\nMolly: Did this hit the stands yet?",
        "\r\nJake: No, I wanted you to get the first look. Just another benefit of being \r\nmarried to the editor of a newspaper.",

        "\r\nCraig: Eh, a twinge of something.",
        "\r\nMargo: Well, the hospital said you didn't even check in. You know what? You \r\nmight have cracked a rib after that tumble you took with Carly. Pardon the \r\nexpression.",

But instead of \r\nsitting on that couch talking about how we're gonna make our plans come true and \r\nour dreams come true -- why did you ask me to stay, Jack?",
        "\r\nJack: I've spent a lot of sleepless nights wishing you were here with me. And \r\nnow that you are, I don't know if we should sit down to a polite cup of coffee \r\nor -- maybe I should follow my instincts.",

        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah, Craig saved Carly's life. We got it all on video.",
        "\r\nAdam: Yep. Let me take that for you. Yeah, it's probably a bit shaky, 'cause \r\nwhen Jack shot that guy, I jumped, you know? But I kept on going.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah, no one came to the wedding expecting someone to get shot.",
        "\r\nAdam: Yeah. I gave the tape to my mom, too, so she can probably close out the \r\ncase.",

        "\r\nMargo: Okay, thanks. That was my contact on the East coast. Seems this Portolano \r\nhas been known to have mob ties in New Jersey.",

        "\r\nSimon: So you're saying you know something that I don't? Because if you do, \r\nCraig, you'd better come clean. 'Cause I'm kind of in the mood to beat it out of \r\nyou.",

But me, all I can think about is right \r\nnow, how the moon and the candles light your face at this very moment. If I \r\ndidn't know you were real, this would just be the ultimate fantasy.",
