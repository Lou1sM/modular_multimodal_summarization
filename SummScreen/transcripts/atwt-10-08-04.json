        "Aaron: Thanks a lot.",
        "Tony: Lucky punch. How about we go a couple more rounds?",
        "Aaron: All right. Bring it on, baby. Come on.",
        "Dusty: I think we saw enough. Tony, good luck to you.",
        "Aaron: Dus, what about me?",
        "Dusty: I think you got chops. Take a shower, we'll talk.",
        "Bud: Hey. Tell Vinny to give you a rubdown on the house, huh? Now that's the kid I was telling you about.",
        "Dusty: I know him. He works for me at my club. I can't believe it.",
        "Bud: Oh, small world.",
        "Lucy: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Yes, baby?",
        "Lucy: I forgot to mention. Aaron is off limits. Don't even think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't know you. Do I?",
        "Dominic: I never pegged Rose D'Angelo for a poser. The Rosie I knew would never turn her back on a friend.",
        "Rose: You don't understand. I'm not --",
        "Craig: She's not used to running into people she knows here in Oakdale. Are you, Rosie?",
        "Dominic: How do you two know each other?",
        "Craig: Oh, here and there. This and that. Dominic wants to be a partner at Metro. He's buying out Dusty Donovan.",
        "Dominic: Nothing's written in stone. What I want to know is why you treatin' your old pals like they're poison? I hope it's not 'cause of what happened the last time we went out.",
        "Rosie: What?",
        "Dominic: I'm sorry, Rosie, my hands getting a little busy at Bally's, but can you blame me? I mean, you were hotter than hell that night, right?",
        "Craig: Why don't I leave you two alone to --?",
        "Lily: No! Yes -- I recognize you. Just that, I don't want to butt in on your curvaceous date over there. And she better be careful, if she sits too close to that candle, those things are gonna melt.",
        "Dominic: Oh, she's all right. You got plans tonight?",
        "Lily: You got any ideas?",
        "Dominic: Like you wouldn't believe. Let me see if I can tie up a few loose ends and we'll see what develops.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Dominic: You don't mind?",
        "Craig: Not at all.",
        "Dominic: I shall return.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Lily. I've been trying for weeks to figure out what this guy has got going with Dusty. And now in just a couple of drinks, you're gonna find out everything --",
        "Lily: No way, Craig.",
        "Craig: It's the only way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: If Nikki finds these, she's gonna kill me. Look at me. Why am I acting like the other woman expecting the jealous wife to rush through the door? It's not like we did anything wrong.",
        "Mike: Not a thing.",
        "Jennifer: So why do I feel so terrible about her finding us?",
        "Mike: I don't know. Why?",
        "Jennifer: I was hoping you would know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Hey. Are you sure there's nothing I can say to stop you from doing this?",
        "Nikki: Hey, you want to find out what's going on between Mike and Jennifer as much as I do. Look, if you don't want to go through with this, go wait in the car. A good cop does not give up until she gets her man. Nobody's making a fool out of me.",
        "Jordan: Well, then stop acting like one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do we have everything?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I think so. I'm just so glad the sitter can stay overnight. If we leave now, we might be able to find Jack by morning.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Carly, it's so great to see you hopeful again.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I feel like I've been one step behind the last couple of weeks. Like the universe has been conspiring against us. But when that sketch practically flew into my arms today at the pond.",
        "Rosanna: That was a sign. That was a sign. And that woman from the water park showing up here and leaving that pen?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: That was more than a sign. That was a road map.",
        "Carly: St. Genevieve hospital. That's where we start our search. And, you know, this might take a little bit longer than we think, so if you want to back out, you can. I won't mind. I can't do it alone.",
        "Rosanna: What?! No. Never. Wherever this adventure takes us, we'll go there together.",
        "Carly: Good. We're going to bring Jack home, Rosanna. We're not coming back without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nadine: Julia? I heard a nasty rumor about you, young lady.",
        "Julia: What? What? What do you mean?",
        "Nadine: You thought I wouldn't find out?",
        "Julia: What?",
        "Nadine: You're leaving St. Genevieve without even telling me.",
        "Julia: Oh, Nadine, I'm so sorry, you know? It was just -- it was really sudden. I got a wonderful offer from a hospital in Nashville. It was just too good --",
        "Nadine: Nashville? Really?",
        "Julia: Yeah. It's, um, a good place to raise kids. They have a lot of opportunities. You know, they have museums and sports and things like that.",
        "Nadine: Between the two of us, I've been thinking about getting out of this place myself. Which hospital? Julia? Hey, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nadine: Julia?",
        "Julia: Uh.",
        "Nadine: You were telling me the name of that hospital in Nashville?",
        "Julia: Ye, excuse me for just a minute. Hey, Greta, I just -- listen, okay? I'm sorry, if I sounded defensive at all before, I apologize. I want to make something very clear to you, as soon as Jack and I get settled, the first priority is going to be to find a therapist and resolve any remaining, residual, you know, issues.",
        "Greta: Well, I hope you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Where the -- oh. It's so cold. This isn't my coat. This is a woman's coat. Why am I wearing -- that's all I'm wearing is a -- ahhh, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki -- we finally -- oh, no, the pond. You idiot. The pond -- my clothes were stolen. I'm gonna free -- freeze. I need some heat here. Jordan was there, you moron. Where is he? Where is -- where is everybody? Hey! Hey, somebody! Where is everybody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm staying, all right. I'm the one who led here on, I should stay and explain things.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no. You'll make things worse. Just -- here, go home.",
        "Mike: What about her hearing me?",
        "Jennifer: I'll handle everything, okay. She's a cop, she's suspicious. The last thing that Nikki needs is to see the two of us together.",
        "Nikki: Really? Why's that, sis?",
        "Jennifer: What, you send for back-up?",
        "Nikki: No need to explain. We're all adults here, right? Missed a button. I've seen enough. Let's go.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no, no.",
        "Nikki: Don't put your hands on a cop!",
        "Jennifer: I didn't. I put my hands on my sister! And either we need to hash this out here, or you might as well arrest me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I cannot pretend to be Rose.",
        "Craig: Just have a conversation with the guy, that's all. A drink at the bar.",
        "Lily: Are you -- what's the matter with you? Everybody knows me here. Someone will tell Holden and he'll ship me off to the funny farm.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you do have a point there.",
        "Lily: Thank you, for understanding.",
        "Craig: You're gonna have to take him back to the guest house.",
        "Lily: Are you out of your mind? Really?",
        "Craig: I'll be outside the entire time, all right? No harm is gonna come to you. Oh, come on, Lily. I'm worried sick about Lucy. All right, she refused to see what kind of a deviant Dusty is and if I can find out what kind of scheme he's got going this time, maybe she'll come to her senses. Okay? She will realize she's thrown her future away, she'll regret having postponed her education. Oh, who am I fooling? She's under his thumb. It's probably too late to get to her anyway. I've lost her for good this time.",
        "Dominic: Turns out I'm free all night.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Dominic: Care to share a drink? Talk about old times? At least give me a chance to make up for the night at Bally's when you had to slug me in the jaw.",
        "Lily: Hmm.",
        "Dominic: I'll show you what a gentleman I can be.",
        "Lily: Don't be too much of a gentleman, I wouldn't recognize you.",
        "Dominic: You don't mind if I borrow your date?",
        "Craig: Oh, no, no. Far be it from me to come between two old friends.",
        "Dominic: Come on, let's grab a table, have a drink.",
        "Lily: Or we could go back to my place.",
        "Dominic: Yeah?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Let me just get out of these uptight clothes and get into something more comfortable.",
        "Dominic: You know, I was wondering about the get-up.",
        "Lily: Yes, this is -- I have a job. It's called business attire.",
        "Craig: She's a hostess at Metro. Not full-time, just part-time.",
        "Dominic: Whatever. No matter what you wear, you look like a million bucks before taxes, baby.",
        "Lily: Awww, you always said the sweetest things.",
        "Dominic: Shall we?",
        "Lily: Let me -- I'm gonna go and change my clothes, straighten up a bit, and I'll meet you there.",
        "Dominic: Where?",
        "Lily: Craig will give you directions.",
        "Dominic: All right, I'll see you soon.",
        "Lily: I'll be waiting.",
        "Dominic: I hope you weren't expecting a silent partner at Metro, Montgomery. 'Cause I'm gonna be around a lot.",

        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Julia: I missed you, so much.",

        "Julia: You got a driver's license?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you're looking at Jack Jackson of Louisville, Kentucky.",
        "Julia: That is terrific.",
        "Jack: Now we don't have to worry about the running into the cops on the way to our new life.",
        "Julia: Oh, that's great, babe. That's so great. Listen, what can I do to help you out here? To get us moving?",
        "Jack: I was just out the door to the grocery store to get boxes.",
        "Julia: Ahh, no. No, no, no. Don't do that. We don't have that much room in the car anyway. Why don't you just stay here with me, okay? Help me pack.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Julia: Promise?",
        "Jack: You're the boss. Yeah. I wouldn't think about going anywhere without you. And that is a promise.",

And soft. Oh, that is great. Great. Come on, now. No. [Alarm sounds] Hey! Oh, that's fine! Just what I needed. Thank you, so much!",
        "Cop: Step away from the car and freeze!",
        "Henry: Too late -- already frozen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: So, you saw the boiler room, interrogated the witnesses. Do we need affidavits to prove there actually was an explosion down there?",
        "Nikki: I get it. Mike saved the day.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, see. There -- there's no big conspiracy.",
        "Jordan: I told you there was a logical explanation.",
        "Jennifer: Nikki, can I talk to you, just the two of us?",
        "Mike: If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Nikki first. I need to explain some things.",
        "Nikki: No, you don't need to --",
        "Mike: No, I want to.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, you know what, use my office.",

        "Dusty: We got to talk about Aaron.",
        "Lucy: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Dusty: Did you see what he did to that kid?",
        "Lucy: Dusty, it's Aaron. He's my friend. I don't want to see him get hurt.",
        "Dusty: Neither do I, all right? This might be a good opportunity for him to make a lot of money.",
        "Lucy: He's not a professional.",
        "Dusty: But he'll get some. He'll get experience, exposure. I'm telling you, there's good money.",
        "Lucy: We don't know what Dominic's guy looks like or punches like. Let somebody else make Rafael look good. Anybody but Aaron.",
        "Dusty: All right, maybe you're right. Might get complicated. I'll see you later. I'll meet you at the Lakeview. Okay? I won't be long. Hey.",
        "Aaron: Well? What'd you think?",
        "Dusty: I think you're good. But I gotta pass.",
        "Aaron: Do I get to know why?",
        "Dusty: It's not the right time.",
        "Aaron: Dusty, I boxed for years in Seattle. I know my way around the ring. I'll -- just give me a coach. Give me a chance and I'll show you that --",
        "Dusty: Come on, Aaron. It's not gonna happen. Let it go, all right?",
        "Aaron: It's because of Lucy and me. Right?",

        "Julia: What we want, what we love, what we can't replace. That's it.",
        "Jack: I understand that, but J.J.'s gonna freak out if we don't bring some of these video games. And the checker board set. I don't know what he's gonna do if he can't school me everyday.",
        "Julia: Okay, good, thank you.",
        "Jack: Hey. When you went to pick up your check did you run into Les or something?",
        "Julia: No. I would've told you. I'm just overwhelmed, babe. You know? Change -- is scary.",
        "Jack: Unless you wake up one morning with a new life and no memory of the past.",

        "Julia: You better knock it off or we are never gonna finish packing.",
        "Jack: I'm going. I'm gone. I go.",
        "Julia: I hope this woman Carly can understand that Jack really does have a new life now. With people who love and care about him more than she could ever know. It's not wrong. It's not wrong to move on. She did it. I can promise her one thing -- I'm gonna keep that man happy for the rest of my life. [Knock at the door] Hey, Frank. What brings you by?",
        "Frank: This brings me by. You've got some explaining to do, my friend.",

        "Nurse: Security!",
        "Carly: Don't you get it? Doesn't any of this sound a little familiar to you? The woman's name is Julia. She has a son whose name is J.J.",
        "Rosanna: It can't be.",
        "Carly: Why not? I don't know if she's had plastic surgery, or if this woman is working for Julia, or with her -- but Julia Lindsey has something to do with Jack being gone.",

        "Carly: It's just a coincidence?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, possibly.",

        "Frank: You know, sweetheart, a cop brought this by my place for me today, not your ex.",
        "Julia: Right. Because ever since Les found out I was leaving town he has the police trying to help him find out where I'm going.",
        "Frank: The guy knows you remarried.",
        "Julia: And ever since, he's been trying to take J.J. away from me. I am not gonna let him do to -- I'm not gonna let him do to my son what he did to me. Did I ever tell you about my ex-husband, Frank? Huh? Did I ever tell you what he did to me? You want to hear, or do you just want to see the scars? Hmm?",
        "Frank: So why don't you just tell Jack. Why don't you let him help you?",
        "Julia: Because Jack will go crazy. He'll go after Les. And I don't -- I don't want him to get into a fight. I don't want anybody to get hurt, Frank. I just want to leave. I want to pick up and go someplace else and I want to be happy and I want to be free. Okay? Is that so much to ask?",

        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",

        "Aaron: Then what's the problem?",
        "Dusty: It's not personal. You understand me? This fight's gotta go down without a hitch. And I would feel more comfortable if I was putting my energy behind someone more experienced.",

        "Lily: Good. Could you do the honors? I'm all thumbs.",
        "Dominic: Anything for you kid.",

        "Dominic: Yeah, an old friend of mine, Dusty Donovan.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Dominic: He might be selling me his share. If things work out, you know?",

        "Lily: Oh? How could I forget that?",
        "Dominic: Oh, man. I'll tell ya, they caught me palming those cards I coulda spent the night in the pokey. It's a good thing that pit boss -- I fenced some stuff for him the week before.",

        "Lily: Not bad. With those guns you should be in the ring.",
        "Dominic: Flattery's going to get you everywhere, young lady.",
        "Lily: Speaking of which -- something about this -- boxing thing you got going on with Donovan, too?",
        "Dominic: Yeah, it's a showcase for this hot, young fighter that I manage.",
        "Lily: Hmm? Fighting? It's kind of a iffy business, isn't it?",
        "Dominic: Yeah, I've found a way to -- limit my liability.",
        "Lily: Is it legal?",
        "Dominic: Let's just say I got it covered.",
        "Lily: What's in it for you?",
        "Dominic: One-way ticket to easy street.",
        "Lily: Oh, yeah? The guy must be pretty good if you're so confident.",
        "Dominic: He's the best. He's gonna drop his opponent in the first few rounds and I'll be sitting pretty.",
        "Lily: Really? What are you, Kreskin? You can't call who's gonna win a fight.",
        "Dominic: I can. Donovan's guy's gonna go down like a ton of bricks and I'm gonna walk away with big bank. Can you keep a secret?",
        "Lily: You know me.",
        "Dominic: It's all in the bag, baby. Bet on Rafael Ortega. The kid's a winner.",
        "Lily: Who's he fighting?",
        "Dominic: A loser to be determined at a later date.",
        "Lily: You haven't changed have you? You always got an angle.",
        "Dominic: There's nothing wrong with a guy who knows what he wants, is there?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Dominic: I don't like to lose, Rosie. And I don't like to take no for an answer.",

        "Lily: You better answer that. It might be important.",
        "Dominic: Don't move.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Dominic: Where'd I put this thing? Yeah.",
        "Bud: Hey, it's Bud. Down at the gym.",
        "Dominic: I'm kind of in the middle of something here, pal.",
        "Bud: Yeah, well so am I. And if you're smart you're gonna haul it down here now.",
        "Dominic: What's going on?",
        "Bud: I got the perfect -- the perfect pigeon to fight Rafael. He's here right now. He's got a nasty right cross. He's quick on his feet. He's got fast hands and he's got some power.",
        "Dominic: Make sure Donovan sees him.",
        "Bud: Yeah, he did. But he's walking away. I just told him, you know, he's passin' up a great opportunity.",
        "Dominic: Is Donovan still there?",
        "Bud: Yeah, the fighter is too.",
        "Dominic: All right, make sure he doesn't leave until I talk to 'em. I'm on my way.",
        "Lily: You're leaving already?",
        "Dominic: Yeah, you know how it is. Duty calls.",
        "Lily: You want to stick around, get reacquainted?",
        "Dominic: I'll be back, toots. You can count on that.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "Craig: So, what'd he say?",
        "Lily: I was -- it was amazing. I was brilliant! I was on fire!",
        "Craig: He bought you as Rose?",
        "Lily: I bought me hook, line and sinker. He said I hadn't changed a bit. It was incredible. It was exhilarating. It was -- it was -- fun.",
        "Craig: So, what did he say?",
        "Lily: What didn't he say? All I had to do was flash a little, you know -- and he was singing like a canary. It was so much fun. When can we do it again?",

        "Police officer: Too bad for you, this is a cop's car.",
        "Henry: I know that. It's Nikki Munson's car. She was my date. All right? She's an old friend of the family. Why don't you just call her, she'll verify everything.",

        "Jordan: Well, when once she gets an idea in her head, there's no convincing her otherwise. Family trait?",
        "Jennifer: If you're referring to my reaction to your affair with Rosanna.",
        "Jordan: No, actually, I was referring to you starting your own company. Congratulations again, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks. Question? Why are you here?",
        "Jordan: I drove over here with Nikki.",
        "Jennifer: No, I mean in Oakdale. Why did you decide to stay?",
        "Jordan: Well, like I told you at the Lakeview, I accepted a position at Worldwide.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, that's right. I forgot. I guess I'm just surprised that Lucinda hired you. How'd you swing that?",
        "Jordan: Hard work and determination, same way most people get their jobs. Tell Nikki I went out to get some fresh air.",

        "Jennifer: Hey, sorry. Sorry. I just -- I need to get a few things, and then the office is yours.",

        "Lily: More like weighted, as I can see. They're stacking the odds in their favor. Apparently a lot of people are gonna win a lot of money.",

        "Julia: And that and, you know, maybe running into Greta Williams at the hospital today. I'm afraid that -- I'm afraid that she's gonna call the police if we don't give her answers the she's looking for.",
        "Jack: I meant what I said. No one's gonna come between us, I'll make sure of it. Including the authorities. And, hey, you're running with a rebel now. I got my fake I.D. and everything.",

        "Jack: Hey, I can joke because there's nothing in this world -- there's nothing this world can throw at us that we can't handle as long as we're together. Forget about Greta Williams, forget about Les swooping in trying to take J.J. It's not gonna happen.",

        "Jack: Because I would die for you and J.J. That's how.",

        "Julia: Listen to me, okay? If I'm ever really selfish, you know, or greedy -- I want you to understand something. It's just because I love you so much. It's only because of that, Jack.",
