        "Carly: All right. Here's some ground rules, okay? If my hand shakes, or I drop something, we don't call Dad, okay?",
        "J.J.: Oh okay.",
        "Carly: I'm fine you know? It doesn't hurt. It's just frustrating, that's all.",
        "J.J.: So it's going to keep on happening, isn't it?",
        "Carly: I guess so. But it's not your job to take care of me.",
        "J.J.: That's a stupid thing to say.",
        "Carly: You've been talking to Parker, haven't you?",
        "J.J.: Well I'm a kid, and you're sick. And if I'm alone with you -- I should take care of you, right? What happens if -- what happens if it happens again? What am I supposed to do?",
        "Carly: Well, if it goes on for too long, or if I can't talk to you, then you call for help. But look what just happened now. It hit and it goes away and we can carry on with what we were doing, right?",
        "J.J.: Well maybe you should just lie down, take a rest.",
        "Carly: No. I'm going to help with the diorama. It's what I live for.",
        "J.J.: It's not important.",
        "Carly: J.J., it's everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: And so Carly wants to stay strong, especially in front of the kids. She wants to be super mom, so she asked that I watch out for her. Let her know if she's slipping. Let her know she's not being herself, and I said I would. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. You do what you have to do. Don't worry about me.",
        "Jack: But it's not fair.",
        "Katie: Who the hell knows what is any more? Certainly not Carly.",
        "Jack: No, not Carly.",
        "Katie: Listen, I think we made a little mistake.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Katie: I mean, I know we both meant well. I know I meant well. I thought that my job here was to keep going, you know? Get mortgages, buy furniture.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's what I want.",
        "Katie: That's what I wanted too, but it's not right. It just feels like a lie. I think right now my job is just to be your backup. Make it easier, for you to make things easier, for her. Like today, I have the rest of the day off, I could pick up the kids from practice or take them wherever you want just so you don't have to leave her. Let me help you handle this the way Carly wants to handle it.",
        "Jack: Thank you very much.",
        "Katie: Oh hey, I dimly remember that. It's Jack smiling.",
        "Jack: Ah, well actually, I was remembering how I found you and the boys practicing hockey out in front of the house.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I remember that. I also remember how good it felt when you put your arms around me. Don't think I've forgotten that I'm the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, I think that you and I are on our way to a very nearly perfect diorama.",
        "J.J.: You just love saying that word, don't you?",
        "Carly: Which word? Diorama? I do, actually. Would you do me a favor and get me a glass of water?",
        "J.J.: Sure. Do you want anything else while I'm there?",
        "Carly: Nope, I'm good.",
        "J.J.: Okay. Um -- here you go.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "J.J.: I'm going to go get something to eat, okay?",
        "Carly: Sure. There's fruit in the crisper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're being nice.",
        "Margo: Uh -- yeah.",
        "Jack: Katie told you, didn't she?",
        "Margo: Yeah, she did. I'm really sorry.",
        "Jack: No, it's good. It's good that she talked to you. She's been going through a lot. She needs a shoulder.",
        "Margo: Yeah, what about you?",
        "Jack: One foot in front of the other.",
        "Margo: How did your feet lead you here?",
        "Jack: I'm working.",
        "Margo: Why? Jack, we've got you covered. You're still technically on your honeymoon and you've got like 8,000 personal days.",
        "Jack: It's only been a great escape, Margo. I mean, what could be better than working out your frustrations on a bunch of bad guys?",
        "Margo: Yeah, but you're not doing that. You're just shuffling around papers here.",
        "Jack: Okay, which reminds me how sad it's really gotten because there was a time that I loved --?",
        "Margo: Jack? Jack -- Jack -- when we know for sure that we're losing someone, it just kind of makes us feel like traitors knowing that we've got tomorrow and they don't.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Katie says she understands, and she's been really -- she's been really great. Putting her life on hold and everything. But I just told her that I promised Carly that I'd stay close 24/7 in case -- that's what she wanted.",
        "Margo: You think that Katie doesn't understand that?",
        "Jack: No, I told you, she's been great. She said, do whatever you need to do.",
        "Margo: But?",
        "Jack: I didn't give her a choice. I told her my decision without talking to her about it. And I think -- no, I know -- it was a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: And you're all right with all this?",
        "Katie: Of course I am. Jack wouldn't be Jack if he wasn't doing the right thing.",
        "Brad: But he could have talked to you about it first.",
        "Katie: We're all dealing with a lot right now. And I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.",
        "Brad: Okay, all right.",
        "Katie: Stop. Well, if Carly wants to make things as easy and happy for the kids as possible, I want to help.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I thought I'd take J.J. today so maybe she could rest or spend time with Parker and Sage.",
        "Brad: Why are you so nervous?",
        "Katie: I'm not.",
        "Brad: Yeah you are.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not. I'm not nervous, I just think it'll be easier for everyone involved. It'll be a lot easier to digest if you and I do it together.",
        "Brad: You're scared to see Carly alone, aren't you?",
        "Katie: No. I'm terrified.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Somehow Mayer got into my room, drugged my scotch -- next thing I know, I was waking up in the trunk of a car.",
        "Police officer: Then how do you know it was him?",
        "Dusty: Because I got a good look at him when he shot me.",
        "Police officer: Why did he have it in for you?",
        "Dusty: Because I know the truth. Colonel Mayer murdered his ex-wife, Charlene Wilson, A.K.A. Cheri Love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke? Why isn't he answering us?",
        "Holden: He's probably too far away to hear us.",
        "Lily: All of his stuff is here. They can't be that far away.",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm going to try his cell again.",
        "Lily: Luke!",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Holden: Damn it.",
        "Lily: I'm scared.",
        "Holden: Yeah, because our son's out camping with a murderer. Apparently you were scared enough to tell me the whole story.",
        "Lily: Please, Holden!",
        "Holden: You know what? They're on a fishing trip, so they're probably at the lake already. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You know, Mayer, this is very serious business. This is camping.",
        "Noah: What do you know from camping?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. I'm an expert camper. That's why I got the hard task, I'm gathering the wood.",
        "Noah: Hmm, you were just supposed to run an errand. Pretty full of yourself, aren't you?",
        "Luke: Oh, well that's because I am one with nature. In fact, you know what? When we go fishing, I'm not even gonna use a pole, I'm gonna use my bare hands.",
        "Noah: Well I guess you won't be needing your lucky fishing cap, will you?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. That's my cap and I look so good in it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Colonel Mayer has his gun aimed at Luke]",
        "Colonel Mayer: That's the last time you're ever going to touch my son.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Damn it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: All right. What do you think we should do next?",
        "J.J.: Well, this is getting kind of boring. Maybe we should finish it up later.",
        "Carly: You're lying.",
        "J.J.: So are you. Mom, it's okay. We don't -- I like spending time with you, but I mean, we could --we don't have to do all of this.",
        "Carly: I like that too.",
        "J.J.: Remember that time when I was sick last year, and even though I was throwing up all the place, you were being really nice to me?",
        "Carly: It was my pleasure.",
        "J.J.: Well I don't think I can ever be nice to someone who's barfing.",
        "Carly: Wait 'til you have kids. It changes things.",
        "J.J.: Well, you always told me that I was going to get better, but I can't really say the same for you because -- I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Don't apologize for telling the truth.",
        "J.J.: I don't really like the truth right now.",
        "Carly: Me neither. [Doorbell rings] All right, now be sweet while you get rid of whoever that is, huh.",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "Brad: J.J.!",
        "Katie: Hey, how's it going?",
        "J.J.: What are you guys doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know, I think that you are thinking too much.",
        "Jack: I don't feel like I'm thinking at all.",
        "Margo: What? Katie? She knows what you're up against.",
        "Jack: Margo, since the moment Carly came into town, Katie's bent over backwards dealing with this entire Carly situation because of what she knows it means to the kids.",
        "Margo: Good. Good, she needs a dose of reality and Carly's quite a reality.",
        "Jack: No, let me finish though. I gotta be honest with you. The entire Carly topic has -- has been open game. I mean, we've always got it out on the table. We've discussed it, we talked about it. We dealt with it.",
        "Margo: All right, so what? You're not talking now?",
        "Jack: No. Not really. No. I told her my decision, basically. There was no discussion, there was no talk. I basically brought her up to speed.",
        "Margo: Oh. So you're telling me that you're not perfect.",
        "Jack: This isn't funny.",
        "Margo: I know this isn't funny. I don't find it funny, I find it sad. I find it very, very sad, Jack. We've talked a lot about Katie, we talked a little bit about Carly, but nothing about you.",
        "Jack: What's there to talk about?",
        "Margo: Well, you're going through this incredible thing. You're doing this incredibly hard, sad, sad, thing.",
        "Jack: Yeah. What choice do I have? I need to be there for the kids.",
        "Margo: And you're also doing it for Carly, but you don't want Katie to know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: J.J., you don't talk to people like that. Come on in, Guys.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "J.J.: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. There's nothing to be sorry for. It was a good question, actually. First of all, we came to see how your mom's doing.",
        "Carly: Fine. I'm okay. I'm just working on this diorama here which is always a thrill.",
        "Brad: Oh, I'll never forget my first diorama.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Katie: And J.J., the other reason we're here is 'cause we have a surprise for you.",
        "J.J.: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Yeah. But it's at the studio. So, do you have a second to take a ride with us?",
        "J.J.: What, now?",
        "Brad: Trust me, Bud. It's really, really cool.",
        "J.J.: No, I'm, I'm not going now! I'm staying with my mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You were about to explode, Jack. You need to talk to somebody, and I'm right here.",
        "Jack: Carly is -- she's amazing. I can't believe how she's dealing with this. She truly is an amazing person.",
        "Margo: And?",
        "Jack: There have been so many times in our lives when she's manipulated things to get what she wants. This is so different from any of those times. But --",
        "Margo: What? What, you resent that. Of course you resent that. You want to spend time with Katie. You don't want this in your life right now.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and I hate myself for that. I really, really do.",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah. Stop. There's so many good things to hate yourself about. Don't -- please, I'm really not one to giving advice because I've messed up my life in, oh, so many ways. But I really believe this, Jack. It's not about how you feel. It's about what you do. And you have made a promise to Carly, and you're going to keep it. And you're gonna try to see things from Katie's point of view. Why waste time beating yourself up simply because you wish that you were off on some deserted island with you brand new bride.",
        "Jack: Well, this morning, I found myself wishing it was over. And then I realized what it was I was wishing for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Are you sure this is the right way?",
        "Holden: They're not at the lake, Lily. Your guess is as good as mine.",
        "Lily: Luke!",
        "Holden: Luke!",
        "Lily: Luke!",

        "Noah: Dad, what are you doing?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Get out of here!",
        "Noah: Luke!",
        "Colonel Mayer: I told you to get out of here, Noah!",
        "Lily: Where is he? Where is he? Where's Luke?",
        "Holden: What have you done to my son?",
        "Noah: Down there.",

        "[Colonel Winston shoots Luke]",
        "Lily: Luke, oh, Luke! Oh, oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right. Here comes the unsolicited advice that could ruin our friendship.",
        "Jack: We're friends?",
        "Margo: Yeah, for now. Um, stick to your promise. And you take care of Carly, but plan some time alone with Katie. And believe me you're gonna have to plan it because it's not gonna come about spontaneously. And then stick to your plan.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you're right. Katie deserves it.",
        "Margo: No, Jack. You deserve that. I mean, you gotta have time to recharge your batteries. You can't, you can't spend 24/7 taking care of Carly and the kids. Jack, you need someone to take care of you.",
        "Jack: You know, you're starting to work my last nerve, looking out for me and everything?",
        "Margo: Good. So, get mad at me. Get out of here. You're in my way anyway.",
        "Jack: Just so you know, the evidence list to the miller case is missing. You're gonna need it if you go to trial.",
        "Margo: Thanks, Jack. Never would have thought of that.",
        "Police officer: Lieutenant?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Police officer: Line three.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Margo: Hughes. Oh, they found Donavan. He was shot? Winston Mayer did it? All right, great. Thanks. Thanks for keeping me up to date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How long were you planning this?",
        "Noah: Planning what?",
        "Lily: Holden!",
        "Noah: What did you do?",
        "Colonel Mayer: What I've always done, looked out for you.",
        "Noah: And Luke?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Don't you see what he is, what he's trying to make you?",
        "Noah: What I am?",
        "Colonel Mayer: No, not my son!",
        "Noah: Yes, your son!",
        "Colonel Mayer: You think about what I've done for you, and you'll grow up!",
        "Noah: Where are you going? Dad, Dad, what did you do?",
        "Lily: Oh, my baby. He's bleeding. He's bleeding, and he won't open his eyes. And he's not moving. Luke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't know. Hopefully we'll be there soon. Anything you can do to stall him?",
        "Brad: Hey, J.J.! Come on. Go after him. Talk him into going.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not gonna make him do something he doesn't want to do.",
        "Brad: And why is he so sure he doesn't want to go?",
        "Carly: You have to ask him. I don't know.",
        "Brad: Oh, the hell you don't. Number one is because he doesn't want to leave you alone, and number two is because he doesn't want you to see him going off with Katie. Because he knows you don't want to see him going off with Katie.",
        "Carly: Do you think that I run that kid by, like by, remote control. He does have mind of his own.",
        "Brad: Okay, do you want me to cave-in because you're sick or be honest and tell you what I think.",
        "Carly: Brad, I've never wanted to know what you think.",
        "Brad: This would be better for J.J., don't you think? I mean, let life go on just a little bit, Carly. Let Katie be a part of it.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Oh, I see that vulture circling. Well, could she at least wait till I'm dead before she takes my son from me?",

        "Holden: My name's Holden Snyder. There's an emergency in Douglas forest. My son, he's hurt. He has a gash on his forehead. He's bleeding pretty badly. I think we're at the northwest entrance. We'll have somebody meet an ambulance there. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Apparently facing death hasn't mellowed me.",
        "Brad: Well, I always liked how mean and snarly you were.",
        "Carly: Are.",
        "Brad: Are, are. Sorry. Sorry. I know you hate that she's Jack's wife. I know this all stinks, but --",
        "Carly: This -- this surprise that she's got for J.J., is it good?",
        "Brad: It's good. It's good. She's gonna meet --",
        "Katie: Carly?",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Katie: No, wait. Let me go first. I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking showing up here without calling first. And I'm sorry that I upset J.J. it's just that we have someone coming to the studio that I know he'd really like to meet.",
        "Brad: It's Phil Simms.",
        "Carly: Oh, J.J. loves him.",
        "Katie: I know --",
        "Carly: Katie that's really thoughtful. Thank you. Hey, J.J. come on, Buddy. This afternoon, you are going to have the time of your life.",

        "Dusty: He said he didn't want his son to know that she was alive. Well, she was.",
        "Margo: Or what she did for a living?",
        "Dusty: Right.",
        "Margo: And all this while you were out on your own doing this sleuthing, did it ever once occur to you to call me and tell me what you found?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Margo: Because I would have been really interested to know that Colonel Mayer was the victim's ex-husband.",
        "Dusty: Well, once you charged me for murder, I figured you didn't trust me.",
        "Margo: And if I had known that, then maybe you wouldn't have been shot. Maybe you wouldn't have been stuffed into the trunk of a car. But hey, you proved us all wrong. And that was really the point, wasn't it?",
        "Dusty: Come on. You made up your mind. Case was closed.",
        "Margo: Yes, well now that we know the truth. But we don't have the perp. We don't have any idea where he is, but Dusty Donavan saved the day.",
        "Dusty: Why do you have an attitude with me?",
        "Margo: Because you decided that you knew best.",
        "Dusty: Kind of looks like I did.",
        "Margo: And you decided that I was out to get you which was not true, even though I had more than enough to make an arrest. The case was ongoing. We were still working on it.",
        "Dusty: Didn't look like it.",
        "Margo: Well, you know, I'm sorry. Sometimes we don't keep our suspects in the loop. Just slipped my mind. But you know what hasn't slipped my mind, Dusty? That it wasn't that long ago that you fired a gun into my brother's chest point blank. So if your feelings are hurt because I didn't trust you, tough.",
