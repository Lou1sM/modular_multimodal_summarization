        "Brian drops by the farm to give Luke and Noah some brochures for the foundation. Brian expresses his concern that if Luke's gay film festival is the place they need to hand out brochures to find investors. Luke tells Noah that he is Lucinda's grandson and he's going to do it anyway. Dusty doesn't like the fact that James is trying to buy the last word and warns Emily to just let this go. But he does invite her to go with him to the reading of James' will. Paul refuses to take more medication. He doesn't like what it does to him. He continues to see and hear ghost James. Meg doesn't want James' money in her house. But Paul insists he needs to be paid back for his losses. Lucinda tries to make amends with Lily but is promptly shown the door. She tells Holden for once she'd like Lucinda to face the consequences of her actions. Lucinda speaks with Luke and asks that he speak with Lily on her behalf. Lily tells Luke he has no obligation to speak for Lucinda and she is sorry to put him through that. Lily feels if she gives in to Lucinda then there is no telling what she might do.",
        "Paul has a problem with Dusty being at the will reading, but is told James wanted him there. The lawyer presents a video, and James declares he is really dead. He just wants to make sure the Steinbeck fortune goes to the proper heir. Paul is livid that Dusty is included in this and warns Dusty to leave Meg alone. He grabs the urn and leaves. Meg takes a phone call from the accountant who tells her they are about to lose everything. Ghost James tells Paul that he is a loser and will lose Meg. Dusty is less than enthusiastic to be the heir and beneficiary of a small fortune. Brian is a sympatric ear for Lucinda. Lily interrupts and tells Lily that she means it, she does not want Lucinda in her life anymore and not to come near her children either. Meg seeks out Dusty to beg him to help as Paul was depending on the inheritance to bail him out. Emily oversees as Meg thanks Dusty with an embrace. She tells Dusty this is cozy, but Paul will never accept Dusty's help so going through his wife is even worse."

        "Luke: Hey!",
        "Brian: Hi! Oh, good, you're both here.",
        "Luke: What's that?",
        "Brian: Something hot off the presses I want to show you. Here.",
        "Noah: Oh, are these the new brochures?",
        "Brian: Uh-huh.",
        "Luke: \"Get up, get involved, Project Greenup. The new eco-friendly project from the Luke Snyder foundation.\"",
        "Brian: So what do you think?",
        "Luke: Are you kidding? These are fantastic. All these will be perfect for the booth at the film festival.",
        "Noah: Totally.",
        "Brian: Film festival? What film festival?",
        "Noah: Oh. I'm just curating this, you know, on-campus festival.",
        "Luke: It's totally student-run, and next year, you can bet they're going to be screening one of his movies. And I am predicting top honors.",
        "Noah: Yeah, right. Anyway, opening night, we've got tons of booths, food, and lots of press for the young filmmakers.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and we were able to reserve a booth for the foundation. Maybe get our message out a little bit, potentially get some new donors.",
        "Brian: Well, I am totally impressed with the initiative I'm seeing here. I'm a bit of a film buff myself. What kind of festival is it? Sci-fi? Independent?",
        "Luke: Actually it's a -- it's a gay film festival. So it's probably a little bit of everything. Oakdale U's gay-straight alliance is a co-sponsor.",
        "Brian: Oh, really?",
        "Luke: What's wrong?",
        "Brian: Well I'm just trying to figure out if it's the right place for our brochures.",
        "Luke: Well, why wouldn't it be?",
        "Brian: Well I just don't know if the festival targets the kind of investors we're after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Honey, your mailbox is absolutely over-flowing.",
        "Lily: Excuse me. I didn't hear the doorbell ring.",
        "Lucinda: No, I didn't ring it.",
        "Lily: No, you just barreled on in, like always.",
        "Lucinda: It's a bad time, I'm sorry. I just came by because I was going to pick up the girls.",
        "Lily: No, no, I'm sorry, but you're not going anywhere with my girls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Let's put this away, all right?",
        "Emily: How could you not be interested in that? And like it or not, you are a part of the Stenbeck family.",
        "Dusty: Enough.",
        "Emily: Dusty, your father, Gunnar, was the Stenbecks' real son. Not James. Which means --",
        "Dusty: I know what you think it means.",
        "Emily: Yeah. The entire Stenbeck fortune could be waiting for you.",
        "Dusty: Give it up, all right? I mean, what am I supposed to do, wait around for this lawyer, what's his name?",
        "Emily: Mr. Bergman.",
        "Dusty: He's going to call me, and what? Offer me what James didn't steal? Give me a break.",
        "Emily: Hey, there could be a lot more left than you think. And why shouldn't it go to you?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause this is James trying to buy the last word. Let it go.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Emily: It's Mr. Bergman. You can't ignore this, Dusty. This call could change your entire life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Paul: What do you want now? Look, I don't know. You're my accountant, why don't you deal with it? Because that's what I pay you to do. Don't call me again.",
        "James: Paul, ignoring the problem is not going to make it go away.",
        "Paul: I'm willing to give it a try.",
        "James: You're in trouble Paul. Now, I know how Dustin would handle this if he were in this situation. And I'm a little curious to see how you planned it.",
        "Meg: I just can't get him to see that Dusty's not a threat. No, no, James convinced him of this, and now he just can't let go of that idea.",
        "Paul: Meg?!",
        "Meg: Barbara, let me call you back later.",
        "Paul: Who were you talking to?",
        "Meg: Your mom. Why aren't you resting?",
        "Paul: You know I don't like to lie down without you. Come on.",
        "Meg: No, no, it's almost time for your medication. That'll help you sleep.",
        "Paul: I don't want the pills. I just want you to come lay down with me.",
        "Meg: I promised, Paul, that you would stick to your regimen.",
        "Paul: No, I don't like those pills. I don't like the way they make me feel. I don't -- I don't -- I can't think straight when I'm on them.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, all right, I'll adjust the dosage.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: But you can't just stop them cold. I don't want you back in the hospital.",
        "Paul: Hello? This is Paul Ryan, who's this? I don't know anybody named Bergman. What do you want? Really? Where? When? I'll see you there.",
        "Meg: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?",
        "Paul: Where we're going. Go put on a pretty dress, we've been invited to the party of the year.",
        "Meg: Whoa, what are you talking about?",
        "Paul: The reading of the last will and testament of James Stenbeck.",
        "Meg: Paul, you can't be serious. You're not really planning on going.",
        "Paul: I'm serious. I've been waiting my whole life for this day.",
        "Meg: Why would you even want any part of his sick legacy?",
        "Paul: After everything that he's done to me, I want -- I deserve some money.",
        "Meg: To you? To you? How about me? I was almost killed this time, and I would have taken our baby with me. I don't want his money in our house.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, that hole in the ground was bleeding me dry.",
        "Meg: I don't understand.",
        "Paul: I just kept pouring more and more money into his pockets, while he had me spinning around looking for some treasure that didn't even exist. He's not going to get away with that. Not to mention the money that he took from my mom. I'm getting it all back, Meg.",
        "Meg: Okay, so your mind's pretty mind made up, then, isn't it?",
        "Paul: Yes, what is left of my mind is completely made up. Please, Meg, I would really like it if you would be there with me.",
        "Meg: Okay. But you have to do something for me first. Here, take one of these, and I'm going to go change.",
        "Paul: Okay, you're the nurse.",
        "Meg: No, I'm the boss, and don't you forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Is that the address Mr. Bergman gave you?",
        "Dusty: I can't believe I'm considering going to this.",
        "Emily: Your presence was requested for a reason.",
        "Dusty: There's no reason for me to be at the reading of James' will. It's a joke.",
        "Emily: Yeah, with a possible multi-million dollar punch line.",
        "Dusty: You're starting to sound like the reporter you are, but don't write the story before you know the headline, or versa.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? Even if there's not a ton of money, isn't it something you'd want to see? I know I would. The unveiling of James' last wishes? People have been waiting for this for years, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Then why don't you come with me?",
        "Emily: What, seriously?",
        "Dusty: You'd save me the effort of having to tell you about it later. And it might be nice to have a friend along.",
        "Emily: Yeah, so that's what we are anymore, we're still friends?",
        "Dusty: If it's all right with you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it's more than all right.",
        "Dusty: Then let's get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Wow, you know, I really thought we were past all this.",
        "Brian: Um, all what? What did I say?",
        "Luke: You know what you said. Don't pretend you don't.",
        "Brian: Um, no, I don't.",
        "Noah: I don't think this is worth picking a fight over.",
        "Luke: Why? He doesn't want us to promote the foundation at the film festival.",
        "Brian: Now hold on --",
        "Luke: Because, it's a gay festival. We can't have that.",
        "Brian: That's not what I said.",
        "Luke: Well, you seemed to be really into it until you found out who was going to be there.",
        "Brian: What I'm concerned about, Luke -- my only concern -- is how the foundation is viewed by the public. We're in the very early stages here. And we need to make sure that it doesn't come off as, um, uh --",
        "Luke: As um, uh, gay?",
        "Brian: That it doesn't come off as political.",
        "Luke: It's a film festival, Brian.",
        "Brian: Aimed at a very specific demographic. And what we want is for the foundation to reach as wide a spectrum of people as possible.",
        "Luke: Of straight people, you mean.",
        "Brian: You know, I would have thought that Lucinda Walsh's grandson would be smarter than this.",
        "Luke: What did you just say?",
        "Noah: Luke --",
        "Brian: You know, I know there is more to you than the fact that he is the person that you love.",
        "Luke: Why can't you just say gay, Brian? What's so hard about that? Why do you always have to bend over backwards to try to find another way to describe it?",
        "Brian: You are so determined to define yourself by this one thing. I mean, you know, you take -- you take any little thing that draws attention away from it as a personal affront.",
        "Luke: I do not!",
        "Brian: You think you have it so tough? Let me tell you something, Luke. If being gay is the biggest hardship you have to face in life, well then, hell, kid, you have it a lot easier than the rest of us. Now, we have a conference call in a half an hour with the Oakdale conservation society. I'm going back to the office. Do you want a ride?",
        "Luke: I will take my own car. Thank you.",
        "Brian: Noah, I'm sorry about this. I'll see you back at the office.",
        "Noah: You okay? I don't know why you let him get under your skin like that.",
        "Luke: Because he's wrong. It is not a crime to hand out those pamphlets at the film festival.",
        "Noah: That's not what he was saying.",
        "Luke: Well, then, what is he saying? That I'm some self-absorbed, spoiled brat?",
        "Noah: No. He's saying that there's more to you than just being gay. Besides that, you're a writer, you're a big brother. You're an athlete. You're a college student. Hey, I love you, and that has very little to do with the fact that you're gay.",
        "Luke: Well, I think it helps.",
        "Noah: Maybe a little.",
        "Luke: Well, you know what else I am?",
        "Noah: Really, really cute?",
        "Luke: Ohh. I'm Lucinda Walsh's grandson.",
        "Noah: What does that mean?",
        "Luke: That means that I'm going to hand out these pamphlets whether he likes it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You can just show yourself out. You're not going anywhere with the girls.",
        "Lucinda: Wait, now. Wait, just one moment please, Honey. I feel it. I feel it. I feel your pain. I feel your hurt. And I -- ohh, I'm so sorry. I'm truly sorry.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm moved. I'm moved, okay, now leave.",
        "Lucinda: But wait a moment. If you don't listen to me, how can I ever explain anything?",
        "Lily: What's there to explain? You did what you did. You let everybody believe Dusty was dead.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I did that. I did that. I helped Dusty leave town when he came to me with that plan. So that nobody would ever know, ever. I did it, and I had a reason. I wasn't going to let you throw your life down the tubes, not with that man. I wasn't going to let that happen. I had to do something, and I did do something about it.",
        "Lily: Oh, I should be grateful to you, then, for all your lies. Look at all the miracles they've accomplished! You saved my marriage, I never went to Iva's, Holden never turned to Carly - -",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, you're angry, Dear, and maybe in time that will --",
        "Lily: No, no, time is not going to cover it. We've been here before, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: I suppose we have.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and I always forgive you because you're always sorry. Is that what you're counting on?",
        "Lucinda: Well, actually, yes, I am.",
        "Lily: Well, you know what? It's not going to cut it this time. I want you to leave!",
        "Lucinda: Lily.",
        "Lily: I said, go!",
        "Holden: I think you should leave.",
        "Lucinda: Come on, Holden, give me a break here. Will you talk to her? Will you make her see what this was all about?",
        "Holden: No, I can't do that because I don't know what it was myself.",
        "Lucinda: Lily! Lily. I was an accomplice with Dusty. I did it, and I did it because I love you.",
        "Lily: Am I being unreasonable? Am I not justified in being angry with her?",
        "Holden: No, no, no. I understand why you're upset.",
        "Lily: But --",
        "Holden: What I don't understand is why this time is so unforgivable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Strindberg: Paul Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm Paul. This is my wife, Meg.",
        "Strindberg: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Walter Strindberg, a colleague of Mr. Bergman's from Stockholm. You spoke with him earlier?",
        "Paul: Yes. He said you were handling the reading of my father's will?",
        "Strindberg: It's a relatively simple matter. It shouldn't take long.",
        "Paul: Excuse me. That looks very familiar. This was -- this was on the cards that my grandmother use to send to me when I was little.",
        "Strindberg: That would make sense. It's your family's crest.",
        "Meg: That urn is --",
        "Paul: Yeah. Wow. Hey, Pops. Must be dark in there.",
        "Meg: What is that for?",
        "Strindberg: I'll explain everything once the other party arrives.",
        "Paul: Other party? Who else would care if James were dead?",
        "Meg: Maybe it's your mother?",
        "Paul: No, she would've called.",
        "Strindberg: Ah -- here they are now.",
        "Paul: No, what -- what's he doing here. He's got nothing to do with my father's will.",
        "Dusty: I was invited. If you got a problem with that take it up with your old man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I have a right to feel the way I feel about this, Holden. And maybe I need that in order to move forward.",
        "Holden: How do you figure that?",
        "Lily: My mother has always been this bulldozing force in my life! In both our lives. And I've always forgiven her. But not this time.",
        "Holden: So, this is it? You're done with your mother?",
        "Lily: I'm just saying that for once, I'd like to see the great Lucinda Walsh face the consequences of her actions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hi. I need to be put to work.",
        "Brian: What are you doing here? I thought you had plans this afternoon.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I did. I was going to take the girls out for a spin, but their mother had a different idea.",
        "Luke: You went to the house?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Yeah, I think that was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone if I had known I was persona non grata.",
        "Luke: Well, what happened? Or should I not even ask.",
        "Lucinda: Luke, Darling, I'm afraid your mom is really, very angry with me.",
        "Luke: No, I know. She told me about Dusty.",
        "Lucinda: Well, she doesn't seem to recall any of the things that she was going through with her life -- ah, I suppose you think I'm a terrible person too.",
        "Luke: No. No, I don't think you really thought about what you were doing, but I don't think you were being malicious.",
        "Lucinda: Not malicious -- oh, you're so cute. No, not malicious. I love you. I love you. Could you do something for me?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Lucinda: A little favor. Would you talk to Mom? Please?",
        "Luke: Grandmother, I --",
        "Lucinda: You don't have to negotiate or ask forgiveness or anything like that, Honey. It's just the girls -- the girls -- she can't cut me out of their lives. I'm their mad grandmother -- they -- they need me!",
        "Luke: And they love you. Like I do. So -- so, of course I will go and talk to her. Brian, can we reschedule that conference call, please?",
        "Brian: I'll cancel that right now.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. Thank you very much. Love you. Thank you. Okay, Honey? Ah -- ah, does nobody drink around here since I'm not here?",
        "Brian: Sounds like you've had a rough day. Do you want to talk about it?",
        "Lucinda: No! No, if I were to give you all the gory details, then you would condemn and hate me too.",
        "Brian: Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't you start talking, and if it gets anywhere near hatred, I'll put a stop to it before there's any permanent damage.",
        "Lucinda: Where were you earlier this year? You would really do that for me?",
        "Brian: In a heartbeat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, hold on a second. You didn't answer my question. What is he doing here?",
        "Strindberg: It's what your father wanted. I'm simply following his instructions.",
        "Dusty: Let's get it over with. I don't want to be here.",
        "Paul: Well, there's the door.",
        "Dusty: Looks like the old man still gets a rise out of you.",
        "Meg: Can we get started? Let's sit down.",
        "Strindberg: Absolutely. If you'll all take your seats. Now, as per the instructions of the deceased, James Stenbeck, I present the following --",
        "James: Hello. This is James Stenbeck. And this is my last will and testament. Welcome. I trust all are in fine spirits, and I know that I'm going to be sorely missed.",
        "Emily: Well, that's the understatement of the year.",
        "James: And have no doubt if you're watching this, that I am indeed dead. No parachute. No tricks up my sleeve. But I do hope to go out with some of the old Stenbeck panache. You see, I was poisoned in Thailand, but my doctors assure me that I have time enough to put my house in order.",
        "Paul: What is he saying? He was sick the whole time?",
        "James: Paul, settle down. We got a lot to go through. And Dustin, if you're there get the smirk off your face. It's rude. My fate is sealed. And my actions since I've been back in Oakdale have been precise and deliberate. I needed to feel assured the Stenbeck fortune would be left to the proper heir. For centuries, the Stenbecks are warriors. One winner, one loser. In this case, it's absolute. Winner takes all.",
        "Dusty: I'm out of here. I'm not watching this garbage --",
        "Emily: No, no, no, just stay. It's almost finished.",
        "James: To determine who would be worthy to carry on the Stenbeck legacy was not an easy task. And ultimately I realized that I could not do it myself. All that I could do was to set the stage for the final battle.",
        "Meg: Oh my God --",
        "James: Between my son, Paul Ryan, and Dustin Donovan, the true Stenbeck heir. My sincere hope that Paul would have proved himself to be worthy to claim the legacy that I have left behind. Also, it would be poetic justice if Dustin were to win, given his hereditary rights. So, who wins? Who loses? Easy. Dustin, if you're sitting there, that means you're alive. You won. Congratulations. What's mine is now yours, yet once again. Paul, farewell.",
        "Emily: I don't believe it.",
        "Paul: What the hell is going on here? That money is mine! That money is not Dusty's!",
        "Strindberg: I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan, but you heard your father. His wishes were very clear --",
        "Paul: I don't care what he wished for. He's dead now, and that money is mine!",
        "Meg: Paul, it's okay.",
        "Paul: It's not okay! He's stealing from me!",
        "Dusty: Your father was a thief, Paul.",
        "Paul: Okay, you shut up! The only reason you're still alive is because I didn't bother to kill you on that stupid island!",
        "Meg: And you're better off for it.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not. That psychopath has been torturing me my whole life. That money was a way for me to put all of it behind me!",
        "Dusty: The only way to put it behind you is to see a shrink. Seriously.",
        "Paul: Okay --",
        "Meg: Paul! Hey, hey! Stop! Stop, stop it! There's nothing you can do about it now, okay? It's done. Let's go home.",
        "Dusty: You need help?",
        "Paul: Oh, no, you stay away from her! You stay away from her! You leave us alone.",
        "Meg: Let's go. Please.",
        "Paul: I'm taking this. Every day I can see it and I can celebrate that the son of a bitch is dead.",
        "Emily: I don't think I've ever seen Paul like this.",
        "Dusty: You're worried about him?",
        "Emily: Yeah, actually I am.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, me too.",
        "Strindberg: I didn't mean for things to get so out of hand. I need to check in with Mr. Bergman. I'll be in touch about the transfer of the estate.",
        "Emily: Thank you. Okay, so -- what am I supposed to call you now? Prince Dustin von Stenbeck?",
        "Dusty: Dusty Donovan. Now, let's get the hell out of here. I need a drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Dusty wasn't supposed to come back! Ever! Ever -- never. It was finished. He was dead. You haven't interrupted me. You haven't said a word. Is it because you're appalled by what I'm telling you?",
        "Brian: No, I'm just -- just trying to digest everything.",
        "Lucinda: It's very hard to process it. Let me tell ya. Oh my God --",
        "Brian: But I have to say -- I hope you don't take offense --",
        "Lucinda: Uh oh.",
        "Brian: But you are one controlling bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, Sweetie, I thought you had a meeting with Brian?",
        "Luke: I did. It got postponed.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Luke: Uh, Grandmother came over.",
        "Lily: She told you we had a fight.",
        "Luke: And she wants me to talk to you.",
        "Lily: Ah, she had no right to do that. Sweetie, you're under no obligation to be put in the middle of this.",
        "Luke: I know. I know. But I started thinking on the drive over here about -- about everything. About how Grandmother helped somebody fake their death. About how -- how bad that must have felt for you, losing Dusty, about how I could have lost both of you.",
        "Holden: Your grandmother took a pretty big risk.",
        "Luke: Yeah. But the thing is, I think the point is, is that I understand where she's coming from. She was really scared for you back then, Mom. We all were.",
        "Lily: I am so sorry to have put you through that. If I could go back and undo it --",
        "Luke: No, I know. I know. But that's what led Grandma to do something so, so extreme. She was terrified for you, Mom. She loves you more than anybody else in the world.",
        "Lily: Thank you so much for doing this, Sweetie. I love you so much. I really do.",
        "Luke: So, does that mean that you're going to talk to her?",
        "Lily: I don't know if I can --",
        "Holden: He makes a pretty good argument.",
        "Lily: If I give in to her this time, there is no telling how far she'll go.",
        "Holden: Okay. Whatever you want to do, whatever you decide, I'm behind you 100%.",
        "Luke: Me too.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Luke: Well, I guess that's -- that's all I needed to say.",
        "Lily: Luke, why don't you spend some time with your dad. I've got something I need to do. I won't be long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I suppose this round's on you. Hey, what's the matter?",
        "Dusty: Guess I'm not in the mood to celebrate.",
        "Emily: Dusty, you just inherited a royal fortune. Literally. A smile wouldn't ruin your reputation, you know?",
        "Dusty: I guess I could use the money to find my son.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and then some.",
        "Dusty: I'm worried about Paul's next move. The guy's been on the edge for years, but it's different now. He's beyond going back. And Meg's right in the line of fire.",
        "Emily: Well, if you're that concerned, you could always give the money back to Paul.",
        "Dusty: Not if I can use it to find my son, wise guy. But am I concerned.",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm -- for Meg? You haven't changed a bit, have you?",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: You. You always have -- you have to have some woman to save. Right? Jennifer, Alison, Lily, me --",
        "Dusty: Oh, is that so?",
        "Emily: Uh-huh. Now you want to save Meg. Did you ever think that maybe Meg doesn't need to be saved?",
        "Dusty: She's married to Paul Ryan. If that's not a cry for help, I don't know what is.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you know what? She loves him. And from what I've seen, he loves her.",
        "Dusty: Whatever.",
        "Emily: Whatever. Whatever -- she's fine, Dusty. Meg is a big girl. So, find some other woman to save, you know? Not that it's going to fill that big, fat void inside of you.",
        "Dusty: Thanks, Doc. Can I get off the couch now?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Can the royal treasury afford another round?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: We'll sue. We'll hire a lawyer. We'll sue -- we'll sue Dusty to within an inch of his miserable life, and get that money back!",
        "Meg: I don't want to sue Dusty.",
        "Paul: That money is my money! It's our money! Dusty has no right to that money!",
        "Meg: I don't want James' blood money, Paul!",
        "Paul: Why is James doing this to me?",
        "Meg: You're doing this to yourself. And it's killing me to see you like this.",
        "Paul: Make it right.",
        "Meg: First, you need to calm down. Let me have that.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Meg: Paul, you're exhausted. That urn is not going to help you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't know. Sleeping doesn't seem to help either.",
        "Meg: Paul -- Paul --",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Hello?",
        "Accountant: Mrs. Ryan, this is Charlie Raines, your husband's accountant.",
        "Meg: Hi, you know, right now is not really a good time. I'll have Paul call you back when he can.",
        "Accountant: It's urgent, Mrs. Ryan. You and your husband are in serious trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: What are you going to do? Sprinkle me around the garden like you did the Duran girl?",
        "Paul: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "James: Paul, you brought all this on yourself. You had the chance to get rid of Donovan, and you didn't go through with it.",
        "Paul: You know I needed that money. You cheated me out of it.",
        "James: Really?",
        "Paul: First you tricked me out of it getting me to spill it into some stupid hole, chasing after some dumb treasure that didn't even exist.",
        "James: Look, face it. You did that to impress your wife and the lovely mother Snyder.",
        "Paul: What is so funny?",
        "James: Buried treasure! Come on, I really got a kick out of that, you know? Like out of a children's book. A fairy tale. Do you think Dustin would've been that stupid?",
        "Paul: You shut up.",
        "James: How long do you think it's going to take your wife to realize she's married to a loser and leave you for good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Could you repeat that?",
        "Accountant: To cover personal debts, Paul borrowed from Worldwide illegally. As a result, you're about to lose everything.",
        "Meg: Uh -- I'll have him call you back. Oh my God, Paul, what did you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You don't know what you're talking about. Meg loves me! And nothing you say, alive or dead, is ever going to change that!",
        "Meg: Paul? Who are you talking to?",
        "Paul: Just kinda talking to myself. You know --",
        "Meg: I thought I heard you say my name --",
        "Paul: I don't remember saying your name.",
        "Meg: You know, I knew you shouldn't have left the house today. It's a little too much for you.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. I'm glad I went. If nothing else, it proves that you were right. I need to get over James.",
        "Meg: Good. You look tired, Paul --",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm a little tired. I think I'm going to lie down for a little while, you know? Get some rest. Are you okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm fine. Um, I was going to run a couple of errands. So, if you need anything --",
        "Paul: No, I don't need anything. I'll be right here lying down when you get back, okay? I promise.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Paul: Hey, Meg? I really love you.",
        "Meg: I love you too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brian: Now I don't -- I don't know Lily all that well. I'll be the first to admit that, but I have seen the two of you together and I have no doubt she loves you very much.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, I hope so.",
        "Brian: -- And in time, she will forgive you. Perhaps sooner than you think.",
        "Lucinda: Ohh.",
        "Lily: Brian, would you excuse us for a minute, please?",
        "Brian: Sure.",
        "Lily: How could you send Luke to clean up your mistakes?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I think that Luke is as upset about all of this and concerned as I am about what's happening here.",
        "Lily: You expect me to forgive you because that's what you want. You expect me to pretend like all of this is okay. Well, that's not going to happen. I'm done.",
        "Lucinda: What does that mean? I mean, what do you mean when you say you're done?",
        "Lily: Exactly what you think it means. I don't want to see you anymore. And I don't want you anywhere near my children.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm sorry but Luke is working here with me.",
        "Lily: Luke is an adult. He can make up his own mind. I'm talking about Faith and Natalie and Ethan.",
        "Lucinda: I love them. I love them the way I loved you. As best I can.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, Mother, but I just don't know any other way to stop you.",
        "Lucinda: From loving? Honey, ohh --",
        "Lily: From deliberately keeping things from me that I had a right to know! And it's going to end now. I'm sorry, Mother, but this is the way it has to be.",
        "Brian: Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm going to go powder my nose. Will you order me another round?",
        "Dusty: Maybe, if you stop telling me I have the savior complex.",
        "Emily: It depends on what you're going to order me.",
        "Meg: Dusty, I need to talk to you.",
        "Dusty: Hey. You all right? You've been crying. What did Paul do?",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.",
        "Dusty: Did he hurt you?",
        "Meg: No, I didn't know where else to go --",
        "Dusty: It's okay. Talk to me.",
        "Meg: Before the reading of James' will today, Paul said something to me, and I didn't understand it at first. He said James was bleeding him dry financially, and he was bound and determined to get that money back.",
        "Dusty: What money are you talking about?",
        "Meg: Remember I told you about the loan shark and that supposed treasure James sent Paul to dig for?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Well, Paul got in over his head, and he started using Worldwide funds to guarantee his personal loans --",
        "Dusty: That's embezzlement.",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's the same word the accountant used when I talked to him earlier. We're going to lose everything, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Did you tell Paul?",
        "Meg: No, I can't bring myself to tell him right now. But he does have to know what he did was wrong. Look, this is why he reacted so badly when he found out James left you everything. He was counting on some of that inheritance to pay off that money.",
        "Dusty: I didn't have anything to do with that --.",
        "Meg: No, I know that. I know that. Well you're the only one that could help us right now. Dusty, I am begging you. I know how you feel about Paul and I feel terrible putting you in this position. But we both know how much James has abused Paul his entire life. Look, I am going to swallow every ounce of pride I have if I can just get you to understand how much I need this.",
        "Dusty: I understand. It's all right. I'll take care of you.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: So listen. I want you to call me with the name and number of Paul's accountant. Can you do that without Paul finding out?",
        "Meg: Yes. Yeah, what are you going to do?",
        "Dusty: Me? I'm going to get my money.",
        "Meg: Dusty, thank you.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to thank me. I want you to do something for me.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Dusty: I want you to take care of yourself. And take care of your baby. You don't have to worry about anything else.",
        "Meg: I won't. I believe in you.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Meg: I'll call you soon.",
        "Emily: That looked cozy.",
        "Dusty: What did?",
        "Emily: You and Meg. Dusty, listen to me. Whatever it is you think you're doing -- don't. It's could be a big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I told Luke that he's old enough to make up his mind about my mother, but as far as the other kids are concerned, I don't want her anywhere near them.",
        "Holden: You do realize that you're taking a pretty tough line with your mother, right?",
        "Lily: You think I'm being unreasonable?",
        "Holden: No, I told you. I support you. Whatever you want to do, I'm behind you.",
        "Lily: Even if you don't agree with me?",
        "Holden: Well, it's kinda a lot going on here. If you're this because you want to free yourself from your mother's interference, that's one thing.",
        "Lily: Well, what else would it be?",
        "Holden: If you're doing it because your mother took Dusty away from you and there are unresolved feelings -- well, that's something entirely different. So, which is it?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Holden: Then you better figure it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Dusty, after James, you're the absolute last person Paul wants to bail him out of trouble.",
        "Dusty: I'm not doing it for him.",
        "Emily: No, you're doing it for his wife, which makes -- which makes it that much worse. Don't you understand? If you go through with this, the whole thing is going to backfire.",
        "Dusty: I'll take my chances.",
        "Emily: I thought the point was to keep Meg out of the crossfire? On a good day, Paul's unpredictable. Today, he was out of his mind.",
        "Dusty: That's right, and Meg's pregnant. She needs protection.",
        "Emily: And it has to be you?",
        "Dusty: Didn't anyone tell you? I have a savior complex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know I screwed up today. I'm sorry. It's just, sitting in that lawyer's office watching Dusty take all that money -- and that money was the one thing that my father could actually have given me that might have actually helped --",
        "Meg: Okay, forget the money. It doesn't matter. You do. Your recovery is all I care about.",
        "Paul: Really? I'm not sure why.",
        "Meg: Because I love you. Dusty can keep everything. I just want to put James Stenbeck and all the misery he's caused us behind us.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's all I want too.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Margo: Well, I just want to get your side of the story.",
        "Lucinda: What story is that?",
        "Margo: How Dusty Donovan faked his own death?",
        "Paul: Could you just find out who it was?",
        "Emily: Ask your wife.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry. There's no way they'll ever trace it back to me. Or you."
