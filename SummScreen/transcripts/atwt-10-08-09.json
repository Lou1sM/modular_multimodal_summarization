        "Noah: Okay, that's it. I'm gonna start heading back now.",
        "Mason: Bad idea.",
        "Noah: I've got to get back to Luke. If I find a garage, I'll send someone back for you.",
        "[Thunder crashes]",
        "Mason: Whoa! I take back what I said. Looks like there's a second storm coming up behind that first one.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, I'm still gonna change it.",
        "Mason: And chance being hit by lightning? Noah, it's warm, it's dry, it's safe in the car. Just --",
        "Noah: I'll be fine.",
        "Mason: You're miles from Oakdale. It's gonna take you hours to walk there.",
        "Noah: I'm just gonna walk until I find a house or a busier intersection and try to hitch back.",
        "Mason: What are you worried about, huh? You afraid that if I stay in this car, I'm gonna make a pass at you? It won't happen, I promise you.",
        "Noah: Mason, the only thing I'm worried about is disappointing Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden groans]",
        "Holden: I'm sorry to do that, kids. I -- I didn't mean to pass out like that.",
        "Luke: Are you seriously apologizing? You're back. This is a dream come true.",
        "Holden: I know. I know I am. I can hardly believe it myself.",
        "Lily: Are -- are you sick? A -- are you okay? When they found your truck, it was --",
        "Holden: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just happy to be back here. I've been waiting for this day for so long.",
        "Lily: Oh, so have I.",
        "Holden: I've been waiting to do that for months.",
        "Lily: So have I, Holden.",
        "Faith: Dad, what about -- what about the accident? Are you really okay?",
        "Holden: I'm okay. Come here, come here. Look at you girls. You're even more beautiful than I remember. And you -- you look like you've grown a foot.",
        "[Holden laughs]",
        "Damian: Thank you, Judge.",
        "Luke: Dad, what happened? Where were you?",
        "Holden: You know, it's a very long story, and -- and I'll get into it another time.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. Let -- let's get you to a hospital right now.",
        "Holden: No. I don't want to do that. I just want to stay here with my family.",
        "Lucinda: It's a pity that you couldn't have materialized an hour ago.",
        "[Thunder crashes]",
        "Holden: What is it? What did I walk in on?",
        "[Thunder crashes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Meg: Watch where you step. I picked up the big pieces, but I still need to sweep up.",
        "Jack: How the hell did that happen?",
        "Meg: Obviously I dropped a plate, Jack.",
        "Jack: Wow. Rough day?",
        "Meg: You could say that.",
        "Jack: What's going on? Let me make another brilliant deduction. Grimaldi?",
        "Meg: He did it, Jack. He married Lily, and they're at her house, celebrating.",
        "Jack: Well, how do you know that for sure, Honey?",
        "Meg: I'm sure, okay? Just take my word for it.",
        "Jack: So you went over there, did you?",
        "Meg: I had to, Jack! I had to talk to Damian.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and say what to him, Honey? What? To -- to not go through with the wedding? Did you think he'd listen to you?",
        "Meg: He told me that he loved me, a -- and I believed him! And the minute Holden was gone, he went straight to Lily, and that's not right!",
        "Jack: Yeah, I -- I agree they rushed into this. But what's done is done. They're married, and nothing's gonna change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, uh, what -- what did I interrupt? A -- a party or something?",
        "Lily: You know what? You -- you're tired. We should talk about this later.",
        "Holden: No, no, Lily. I -- I'm okay. Just -- just talk to me. Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Lily: We all thought you were dead. Uh, there were tests done. Even Jack -- Holden, why didn't you call me? Why didn't you tell me where you were?",
        "Holden: Lily, I -- I would. I would have if I -- if I could. Thanks, baby. But, uh, I -- I was being held against my will.",
        "Luke: Where?",
        "Holden: In Kentucky by a man named, um, Eb Stone.",
        "Lily: He was here. He -- he came here looking for money. But we -- we thought he was a scam artist. We had no idea.",
        "Holden: It's okay. I'm -- I'm home now.",
        "Lily: I'm so happy to see you.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Lily: Holden -- when they told me that there -- there was no way you could have survived, I was lost. We all were. We could barely function. Damian -- he held us together. Not just me, the kids. Otherwise, I never could have --",
        "Damian: Lily and I thought it best for everyone.",
        "Holden: Oh. It's a wedding, right? This is a wedding.",
        "Lily: You don't understand.",
        "Holden: No, you're doing this for my -- for my sister and -- and for Damian. Where is the bride to be? Where is my little sis?",
        "Lily: She's not -- it's not her.",
        "[Thunder crashes]",
        "Holden: Oh, my God.",
        "Lily: Holden, please. I didn't know.",
        "Holden: You married him?",
        "Lily: Faith -- Holden, everyone investigating the accident -- they said there was no way anyone could have survived.",
        "Ethan: Mommy said you wouldn't come back, but you did!",
        "Holden: I -- I had to, Buddy. The whole time I was away, I was missing all of you.",
        "Natalie: I missed you, too, Daddy. But they said not to cry in front of Mommy.",
        "Holden: I would have come home sooner. You know that. I -- I would.",
        "Luke: We know that, Dad.",
        "Faith: I wish we could have found you and helped you out.",
        "Holden: Well, you did help me. The whole time I was away, I just kept thinking about you guys, and that's what helped me -- keep fighting.",
        "Lily: You know what? We -- we need to get you to a doctor to make sure that you're all right.",
        "Holden: Not until we talk.",
        "Lily: There's plenty of time to talk. Right now, we need to --",
        "Holden: No. I -- I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Lily: Well, can we at least get you to bed, where you can rest?",
        "Holden: Someone needs to call my mother and the rest of my family.",
        "Luke: I'll do that, Dad. I'll make sure everybody knows the good news.",
        "Holden: Thanks, Luke.",
        "Luke: I love you, Dad, so much.",
        "Holden: I love you, too. Where's Noah?",
        "Luke: Uh, well, he'll be here soon. Uh, you can see him tomorrow, after you get some rest. Dad, everyone's gonna be so happy.",
        "Faith: Come on. We'll -- we'll help you to your room.",
        "Holden: Okay, all right. Let's go.",
        "Lily: I'll be right there.",
        "Lucinda: What do you think, Damian? Doesn't this feel like the right moment for you to leave?",
        "Lily: This is my house, Mother, not yours. Damian is staying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Damian's not right for you, Meg. You've got to let it go.",
        "Meg: I can't, Jack. My brother is dead, and it's just a little all too convenient.",
        "Jack: Oh, boy. You're still on this whole \"Damian orchestrated this accident\" thing?",
        "Meg: Why not? Why not? If Damian and Lily wanted to get back together again --",
        "Jack: Okay, wait a minute! Make up your mind. Is Damian the guy you love or the guy who's capable of plotting to kill your brother?",
        "Meg: Damian loses his mind when it comes to Lily. So if she asked him to help her find a way to get rid of Holden --",
        "Jack: Stop, stop! Stop it right there! You know that's absurd and completely untrue.",
        "Meg: I don't know what to think anymore.",
        "Jack: Okay. I've got questions about the accident, too, Meg -- questions about Damian. Did he have anything to do with Holden's death? But there's no real evidence against him, and there's certainly none against Lily. And sure, we don't like the fact that they're married right now, but we can't turn it into a crime.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Jack: Luke, what's wrong?",
        "Luke: Nothing, nothing. Everything is finally all right. My dad's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Will you take the children overnight so I can sort things out?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, sort things out with Holden?",
        "Lily: Of course. Of course, that's what I mean. Mother, please.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. All right. Darling, he's the love of your life, okay? And he's come back to you. Okay? Make him glad he did, Honey. Okay. Hey, kids -- uh, Faith, get the little ones. We're coming to my house. Come on. Off we go.",
        "Faith: What's going on?",
        "Lucinda: We're going to spend the night at my house, all of you, okay? All right?",
        "Natalie: Can we get ice cream?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, we can have ice cream. I don't know about the cake. We'll get ice cream. Oh, it's gonna be wonderful!",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: We're gonna celebrate. It is a celebration, isn't it, Honey?",
        "Lily: Yes, it is.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Off we go. Come on. You don't need anything. You don't need anything. Now go, go!",
        "Faith: Mom, why are you sending us to Grandmother's?",
        "Lily: Sweetie, you know your father will never rest with Natalie and Ethan clamoring for his attention. He'll -- he'll be stronger in the morning.",
        "Faith: Why is Damian still here?",
        "Lily: He's just waiting to say good-bye to me. Go. Have fun.",
        "Faith: Mom --",
        "Lily: Everything will be all right, Faith. Your grandmother's waiting. I have to be with him now. You know that.",
        "Damian: Of course I do -- for the time being. But then once you and Holden talk --",
        "Lily: He's my husband, Damian.",
        "Damian: Then why does it still feel as though you belong to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Where -- where was he being held, and by who?",
        "Luke: Well, I don't have all of the details. Dad was pretty weak, so he didn't get into it. But I just felt that I should tell the family that he's alive.",
        "Jack: Right, right, right.",
        "Meg: Where is Damian?",
        "Luke: Uh, well, he was back at the house when I left. I'm not sure he's still there.",
        "Meg: How is he doing?",
        "Luke: Um, he's -- fine. I mean, the -- the ceremony happened.",
        "Meg: But everything has changed now.",
        "Luke: Yeah. That's putting it mildly.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Meg: Oh, Luke, I am so happy! I am gonna go freshen up and go see my brother.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm heading over there, too. I'll wait.",
        "Luke: Well, actually, if you guys could maybe wait for just one day. I mean, my dad is really weak. He collapsed. My mom wanted to take him to a hospital, but he had none of it. He looked so tired, like he could sleep for a week.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: I don't know if I can wait till tomorrow to put my arms around him.",
        "Luke: Well, the important thing is that he's alive.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Luke: And that he's gonna be okay.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Luke: And all the other questions can wait till later.",
        "Meg: You're right. You're right. Uh, we'll wait. Uh, but I need to call Mama.",
        "Luke: Where is she?",
        "Meg: She's probably still on the road. She went on -- on a retreat with her church, and she doesn't pick up her cell when she's driving, so I'll just leave her a message.",
        "Luke: Oh, do you know where her -- uh, her little address book is with all the family numbers?",
        "Meg: Yeah. It's, uh, in the bedroom. I'll get it, and I'll help you make all the calls.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Jack: Luke, your mom was so sure that Holden was -- was alive, and I just -- I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: The important thing is that he is alive, and he's okay, and that's all that matters.",
        "Jack: Finding out who did this to him and why -- that matters, too. Especially to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I forgot about those.",
        "Holden: Who put them there? You or Damian?",
        "Lily: Does it matter? I sent the kids to spend the night with my mother so that we could talk? I, uh -- I moved some of your stuff over to Emma's after the accident. I, uh -- seeing your shirts in the closet -- it was too painful. But I -- I left some of your things here. I -- I must have them somewhere.",
        "Holden: How could you?",
        "Lily: I was heartbroken. I'd lost you.",
        "Holden: You didn't waste any time replacing me, did you?",
        "Lily: Please, Holden, you know me better than that. We've spent most of our lives together.",
        "Holden: Lily, I was a prisoner. I was chained up. I -- I almost got killed when I was trying to escape. When I make it home, I find you wearing a wedding ring that I've never seen before.",
        "Lily: But how could I have known? How could I have had any idea?",
        "Holden: And rose petals all over the bed.",
        "Lily: I went to your funeral, Holden!",
        "Holden: Yeah, and how long ago was that? A couple of months. Is that all it took?",
        "Lily: Do you have any idea what those months were like for me? Night after night, I just laid in that bed, missing you, mourning you. My God, Holden, there were nights when I just wanted to end it permanently, to go wherever you were.",
        "Holden: What about the children?",
        "Lily: That's why I didn't give in to those thoughts. But, Holden, I was only half there, because without you, I didn't know how to be.",
        "Holden: If that's supposed to make me understand, it doesn't even come close.",
        "Lily: I hoped and I prayed that it was all just a lie, that you would come back to me, but everybody said I was delusional and that I just needed to move on with my life.",
        "Holden: Is that what Damian was saying the whole time he was moving in on you?",
        "Lily: None of this was Damian's --",
        "Holden: Don't defend him. I went through hell to come back to you, and the minute I get back, I find you married to another man. Is this his doing or yours?",
        "Lily: What are you asking me?",
        "Holden: Lily, one of two things happened here. Either he pushed you into this, or the minute I was gone, you went running to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Luke --",
        "Luke: Hey. Where were you? Are you okay? I was worried about you.",
        "Noah: I'm fine. I'm just so sorry. I know -- I wanted to be here so much and share this with you.",
        "Luke: It's okay.",
        "Noah: I just got caught in the thunderstorm on the way back from a location scout. I -- I hoped to be here in time for the reception. But -- where is everybody?",
        "Luke: Um, there was no reception.",
        "Noah: What's going on?",
        "Luke: Things got a little crazy after the wedding.",
        "Noah: Crazy how?",
        "Luke: My dad came home. He's alive, Noah. And -- and he came home. He walked in like he had never, ever left.",
        "Noah: Holden -- Holden's here?",
        "Luke: Yeah! He's upstairs with my mom!",
        "Noah: Oh, my God! That's fantastic! Wait. You said he came back after the wedding.",
        "Luke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Noah: How's Damian taking this?",
        "Luke: Well, he must be devastated. He's held a torch for my mom for such a long time. He finally got her back, and now he's lost her for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Keep them coming.",
        "Meg: Hey! I thought I might find you here.",
        "Damian: You heard?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Luke came by at the farm. He told us what happened. I don't know what to do with myself, I'm so happy. It's amazing. Isn't it?",
        "Damian: Yeah. Amazing.",
        "Meg: You know I'm gonna say something that you might not want to hear.",
        "Damian: What's that?",
        "Meg: I'm overjoyed that my brother is alive, but I am sorry this happened to you, Damian. I really am. I know you probably thought you and Lily had a long life together, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.",
        "Damian: Exactly what is it you want from me, Meg?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I unpacked the things I put away. We can get the rest of the stuff from your mother's in the morning. You must be hungry. I'll get you something to eat.",
        "Holden: I don't want food. I want you to answer my question.",
        "Lily: Do you really want answers, or do you just want to make me feel worse than I already do?",
        "Holden: Who started it, Lily? You or Damian?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I -- I really don't know how it happened. But I do know that when I lost you, I was devastated, and when I needed someone, Damian was there.",
        "Holden: There were a lot of other people, too -- my mother, my sister, Jack.",
        "Lily: I couldn't open up to them the way that I could with Damian.",
        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because they reminded me of you, Holden. When I spoke to anyone who loved you, I -- I feel their loss, their loneliness, and I couldn't take it, because I -- I had enough pain of my own.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I -- I should have known. I should have known.",
        "Lily: That's okay. You're here. You're safe. You're home.",
        "Holden: No, Damian -- he saw that you were vulnerable. He saw an opportunity, and he preyed on it.",
        "Lily: I -- I wasn't a victim.",
        "Holden: Oh, yes, you were. Don't you remember when I was telling you that I was suspicious of Damian, that I thought that he still had a thing for you?",
        "Lily: No. He was with Meg.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. He pretended to be. But -- but he wanted you. He wanted you all along.",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Holden: Lily, the minute I was gone, Meg was forgotten, and he moved in on you.",
        "Lily: That's not the way it happened. He didn't pursue me. He -- he supported me. He held me together. He made me strong for the kids. I wouldn't have survived without him, Holden.",
        "Holden: Okay. So -- so what are you telling me here? You love this guy?",
        "Lily: I love you.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm glad to hear it. But answer my question. Do you love Damian?",
        "Lily: I don't love Damian the way I love you.",
        "Holden: But you do love him.",
        "Lily: In some ways, yes.",
        "Holden: Well, that about says it all.",
        "Lily: Holden, he held the family together when I wasn't strong enough to do it myself. When I was falling apart, he took care of me. He's a good man.",
        "Holden: And you've just discovered this? Or maybe you remember that from when you were married to him before.",
        "Lily: I don't understand what you're saying.",
        "Holden: Lily, normally -- normally, you don't rush into things. But today, I come back here, a -- and you're not dating him. You're not just living with him.",
        "[Holden laughs]",
        "Holden: You're married to him. And if you decided to do this that quickly, then you must have had feelings for him before.",
        "Lily: Why are we even talking about this? It doesn't matter. You're home.",
        "Holden: Lily, if you were falling for him before I went to Kentucky, it matters to me. I need to know.",
        "Lily: It didn't happen like that.",
        "Holden: I need to get a shower.",
        "Lily: Holden, you're still weak. Let me -- let me help you. Let me take care of you. I don't want you to hurt yourself.",
        "Holden: It's not necessary.",
        "Lily: Okay. If you want to be alone.",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "[Lily sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: I thought you wanted us to be friends.",
        "Damian: And this is friendship? Making light of a marriage I thought would last for the rest of my life?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. But you'll bounce back. You always do.",
        "Damian: How do you know?",
        "Meg: Well, let's just say I know your feelings to be fleeting.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry I hurt you, Meg.",
        "Meg: And I'm sorry Lily hurt you. But you're not the first person to think that you could come between Lily and Holden. No one ever succeeds. And now it looks like death can't even keep them apart.",
        "Damian: I hope that's not supposed to be funny.",
        "Meg: Remember what you told me? You said that I should move on from our relationship, because it wasn't going anywhere.",
        "Damian: Sounds familiar.",
        "Meg: Well, I'm giving you the same advice. Let it go.",
        "Damian: Easily said. Is it easily done?",
        "Meg: Not so much. But if there is anything I can do to help, all you have to do is ask.",
        "Damian: Very generous offer. You're a remarkable woman.",
        "Meg: Hey, where are you going?",
        "Damian: I'm going up to my room. Thank you for your understanding. You're a better friend than I deserve. And if I didn't say it before, I am happy for you. I am happy for your whole family that Holden's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Wait! Don't go! Jack?",
        "Jack: You expecting someone else?",
        "Lily: Of course not. What are you doing, lurking around out here?",
        "Jack: Guess I was just having a little conversation with myself.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Luke came by to tell us that Holden was back. He also said that it probably wouldn't be good to visit tonight.",
        "Lily: But you came anyway.",
        "Jack: Ran into him again. He's with Noah at Java, by the way.",
        "Lily: That's good.",
        "Jack: Maybe he was right. Maybe it's -- I should give Holden a night to get his bearings back. It's just that I have so many questions. How is he?",
        "Lily: Exhausted. That much I can see for myself. But beyond that, I don't know.",
        "Jack: Well, what happened, Lily? And how did he get out of there?",
        "Lily: I -- I didn't get a chance. I mean, there w -- there was so much going on. I --",
        "Jack: How are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm still in shock. I'm -- I'm so grateful that he's alive.",
        "Jack: You think maybe I could talk to him? I mean, if you don't think it's a good idea, then I can -- I can always ask him these questions.",
        "Lily: See for yourself. Maybe he'll talk to you, 'cause God knows he doesn't want to talk to me right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I guess my mom and Damian are gonna get the marriage annulled.",
        "Noah: So what happens next? I mean, your mom and Holden just pick up where they left off?",
        "Luke: I hope so. But he w -- walked in on her marrying another guy. I mean, that's pretty hard to get over.",
        "Noah: She did think he was dead.",
        "Luke: Note -- if I die, you are not allowed to meet anyone until like 30 years after I'm in the ground.",
        "[Noah laughs]",
        "Noah: Same goes.",
        "Mason: Oh. I'm so glad you made it home okay. I am very sorry I got Noah home late. Turns out it was just a bad battery. It was a quick fix.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm -- I'm glad everything worked out. But, um, we're actually in the middle of something now, Mason.",
        "Mason: Oh. I'm -- I'm sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. But I thought you'd want to know that I got the final confirmation on your location, so your shoot is on.",
        "Noah: Thanks.",
        "Mason: Sure. Apologies.",
        "Luke: I didn't know you were with Mason. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh! My cousin, the miracle man. Oh, my God. I cannot believe that you're alive. I cannot believe it.",
        "Holden: Ah, well -- there were moments when I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm sure. Well, petals. Somebody's glad you're back.",
        "Holden: Those, uh -- those were for --",
        "Jack: Try to -- try to take it easy on Lily. She was a wreck after we got the news about you. We all were.",
        "Holden: You know, well, that's what I want to talk to you about. There's someone that I -- I want you to find.",
        "Jack: Find? I'm on it. Okay. Just start at the beginning, okay? How did your truck crash and burn? And where have you been all this time?",
        "Holden: You know what? I -- I'll get into all the details. I'll do that later. But right now, what you need to know is that I was kidnapped.",
        "Jack: I know that. Luke told me. So where -- where were you held?",
        "Holden: In a cabin in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Jack: You think you could find the place again?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, sure. It was a guy named, uh, Eb Stone. He's armed, he's dangerous, and I think he's gonna come looking for me. So you need to find him before he hurts anyone.",
        "Jack: Lily didn't tell you? Eb's dead.",
        "Holden: Dead? How do you know?",
        "Jack: It happened in your living room. Damian killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Damian groans]",
        "Damian: Oh, man --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Damian: Thank God you're here. I was going crazy, not knowing what was happening with you.",
        "Lily: I can only stay for a few minutes.",
        "Damian: I'll take whatever I can get. You look so upset, Cara. Let me fix you something to drink.",
        "Lily: No, Damian, there's no time. I just -- I need to explain things. I need -- I need to make sure that you understand.",
        "Damian: I understand loyalty, Lily.",
        "Lily: Then you realize that Holden's back, it changes everything.",
        "Damian: For now.",
        "Lily: No, forever.",
        "Damian: Lily -- you don't even have to think about the future right now. Just take this thing a step at a time.",
        "Lily: I can't do that. My relationship with Holden isn't temporary. I can't have you waiting and hoping for something that's never gonna happen.",
        "Damian: Sweetheart, Holden has been gone for a long time. You both have gone through changes. It's only fair to give yourself a chance to see how those changes play out.",
        "Lily: No, Damian. There's no wait and see. I made a commitment to Holden a long time ago. I should have never moved on with my life so quickly. That was a mistake, one that I need to rectify.",
        "Damian: Lily, you did nothing wrong. As far as you knew, Holden was dead.",
        "Lily: No, no. I -- I could feel him. I -- he was calling to me. He was trying to lead me somewhere, but I chose to ignore it.",
        "Damian: You had no way of knowing he was still alive, Lily.",
        "Lily: I knew it. I knew it in my soul. But I left my -- my fear and my emotion cloud my thinking.",
        "Damian: You were thinking clearly when you married me, Lily. What you feel for him is no more real or important than what you feel for me. It's just more familiar.",
        "Lily: I've been with Holden for so long.",
        "Damian: That's why you feel committed to him! But the truth is, you never would have married me if you didn't want to be with me. And that connection does not go away just because Holden suddenly reappears.",
        "Lily: I can't listen to this.",
        "Damian: Lily, listen to me. I am just glad as you are that Holden's alive. But the truth is that you and I belong together, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Um --",
        "Meg: Lucinda. I am so glad to see you. Come here. W -- were you there when Holden came home?",
        "Lucinda: Of course I was there. Quite a historic moment.",
        "Meg: How is he?",
        "Lucinda: He's tired. Oh, he's so tired. He could barely stand. Well, who could expect anything else after the awful ordeal?",
        "Meg: Well, I can't wait to see him, and I don't think I can wait till tomorrow.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I -- I would imagine that you would have had other plans for this evening.",
        "Meg: Oh, like consoling Damian?",
        "Lucinda: The thought crossed my mind.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, what's the point? He can't stop thinking about Lily.",
        "Lucinda: We know. We know, you and I, Holden and Lily are gonna work this thing out.",
        "Meg: Do you really think so?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. Absolutely. I was there. I could see the way they looked at each other's eyes. On top of which, Lily had me take the children home to my house so that she could be alone with Holden.",
        "Meg: Oh. No wonder Damian was throwing back scotches.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Really? Pretty soon, he's gonna be really officially out in the cold. You know, he'll probably need a nice, warm shoulder to cry on. Do you think you're up for the task?",
        "Meg: You bet I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Okay, so where was Lily when all of this was happening? You said that Eb threatened Lily and Faith.",
        "Jack: She was up here.",
        "Holden: With Damian? Oh, well, that explains it. That's why he was available to play hero.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. Time-out. Lily and Faith could have died, Holden. We still have an APB out on Eb Stone's wife. We think she may be an accomplice.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, not Maeve. She was as much a victim in all this as I was.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: Listen, are you heading over to the farm?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Holden: I'll go with you. I need to see my mother. I need to get some coffee first.",
        "Jack: No. What you need -- what you need is to get some rest. And your mom's not even home yet.",
        "Holden: Where is she?",
        "Jack: At a church retreat. Meg called her. She's gonna get home as quickly as she can. She's gonna want to see you when she -- the minute she gets back.",
        "Holden: It's gonna be good to see her.",
        "Jack: Yeah. In the meantime, why don't you go to bed and -- sleep until next week, okay? You can fill in the blanks for me later.",
        "Holden: All right. Thanks for coming by.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I missed you more than you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: He gave me a ride. That's it. But it just -- it seemed like some \"B\" movie I saw in high school, being stuck in a car with a guy who says he's attracted to me.",
        "Luke: Well, I guess coming from someone else, that would sound kind of bogus. But not you. I trust you.",
        "Noah: I didn't want to upset you.",
        "Luke: Well, leaving out important details does upset me.",
        "Noah: Well, it won't happen again.",
        "Luke: Better not.",
        "Noah: So, what do I have to do to get you to forgive me?",
        "Luke: Good loving.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Noah: I think I can handle that. You ready to go home?",
        "Luke: Well, actually, I feel kind of worried about Damian. He must feel so alone right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Don't even try to deny that you love me. I know you do.",
        "Lily: I'm not denying it. But I'm staying with my husband.",
        "Damian: Lily --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, Faith. I thought you were sleeping at your grandmother's.",
        "Faith: Yeah. Natalie and Ethan stayed, but I couldn't sleep. I had to come home, find out what's gonna happen next.",
        "Holden: With me and your mom? We are going to work it out.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Holden: I don't know yet. But that's not your problem. But I promise you this -- I'm here to stay.",
        "Faith: I love you, Dad. The whole time you were gone, I was thinking about all the times I didn't tell you that.",
        "Holden: I never doubted that you loved me.",
        "Faith: Really?",
        "Holden: Not for a minute.",
        "Faith: It must have been so awful. That man was really scary.",
        "Holden: I know, I know, and I'm sorry that I wasn't here to protect you. Does Lucinda know that you came home?",
        "Faith: Yeah. She had her driver drop me off. Where's Mom?",
        "Holden: I'm not sure. I'm sure she'll be home soon, though. Listen, why don't you get some sleep, okay? I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Faith: Yeah, you will.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Holden: Hello?",
        "Renee: Holden, its Renee, Maeve's friend from the hospital.",
        "Holden: Oh, hi. Listen, thanks for letting me borrow your car. I will get it back to you as soon as I can.",
        "Renee: Don't worry about that. Um, I'm calling because Maeve's in trouble.",
        "Holden: What kind of trouble?",
        "Renee: She'd hate that I'm bothering you, but she needs you, Holden.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, you look nice. Where have you been?",
        "Meg: I went out for a minute to take care of something.",
        "Jack: Hmm.",
        "Meg: Where were you?",
        "Jack: I went to see Holden.",
        "Meg: After Luke told us not to?",
        "Jack: Couldn't help myself.",
        "Meg: How is he?",
        "Jack: He's been through hell. But he's okay. He'll see everybody tomorrow.",
        "Meg: What exactly happened to him?",
        "Jack: I didn't get all the details. But what's really getting to me is the shoddy police that was done after the accident.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I don't blame you. How could they have positively identified that body as Holden's when it obviously wasn't?",
        "Jack: They had me convinced there was no hope. Otherwise, I would have stayed on the case. Maybe he wouldn't have had to go through what he went through. But you can be damn sure I'm gonna find out who was responsible for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mason: Hmm. Seems like every time I try to set things right, I make it even worse. Did I get you into even more trouble with Luke?",
        "Noah: No. No, everything's fine.",
        "Mason: But he's gone.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but that's not why he left. But it might be a good idea from now on you and I kept our conversations work-related, at least while Luke's around.",
        "Mason: That's what I thought I was doing. I'm sorry. I didn't think that my broken-down car was personal.",
        "Noah: Why don't we just drop it, okay?",
        "Mason: Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Just one question. I mean, why didn't you tell Luke that you were with me? Did you think he'd get upset?",
        "Noah: He wasn't upset. So none of this matters, Mason.",
        "Mason: Seems like he wants it both ways, you know?",
        "Noah: What are you talking about?",
        "Mason: Well, he's all like, \"Sure, babe. Yeah, go spend time with your adviser.\" But then whenever you do, he gets suspicious. Maybe I'm not the one he doesn't trust. Maybe it's you.",
        "Noah: Maybe you should stop psychoanalyzing my boyfriend, because you don't know the first thing about him.",
        "Mason: But I am getting to know you, and it's becoming pretty clear that you don't trust him, either.",
        "[Noah scoffs]",
        "Noah: You are so off.",
        "Mason: So why didn't you tell him we were together?",
        "Noah: Luke and I are none of your business. From now on, if you have any advice for me, it better be about my film.",

        "Luke: Not me. I think it's still sinking in for me.",
        "Damian: I know what you mean.",
        "Luke: Look, Damian, I'm really sorry that everything fell apart for you. That must be very hard.",
        "Damian: Its back to \"Damian,\" is it? You're not calling me \"Father\" anymore.",
        "Luke: It doesn't mean I don't still care about you.",
        "Damian: I know, I know. You're a good son. And as happy as I am that Holden's alive, I feel sad for myself that I'm not going to get to be a part of the family after all.",
