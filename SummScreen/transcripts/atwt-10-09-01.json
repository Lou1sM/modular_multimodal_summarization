        "\r\nAbigail: Hi. As you know, Jake and Molly are on their honeymoon. But I'm here, \r\nso leave me a message. ",
        "\r\n[Machine beeps]",
        "\r\nNick: Hi. Just wanted to check in and make sure everything was cool after what \r\nhappened at the wedding. Look, I've been working on something. And I could use \r\nanother set of eyes. So I want to get your opinion on it as soon as I can. I'm \r\ngonna head back to the studio now, so I'll catch up with you later. Oh, in case \r\nyou didn't guess, it's Nick.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Wait! Nick -- Nick -- Nick? Nick. Damn it.",
        "",
        "\r\nNick: Thanks again, Isaac. See you later.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Anytime, man.",
        "\r\nBonnie: So -- I hear all wasn't so dull in dullsville yesterday.",
        "\r\nIsaac: You're late.",
        "\r\nBonnie: And you're alive. Which is more than I can say for that gatecrasher at \r\nthe McKinnon wedding.",
        "\r\nBryant: That guy was a psycho.",
        "\r\nBonnie: I hear he was with the Maltese aristocracy.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Which goes to show you money can't buy you class. Besides, Jake was the \r\nreal prince of the night. And Molly -- ooh.",
        "\r\nBryant: Incredible.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Did they see the shootout?",
        "\r\nIsaac: Luckily, no. They'd already left.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Well, don't clam up. I want details. The most exciting thing I've been \r\nto around here was the opening of the new pharmacy down on Market Street.",
        "\r\nIsaac: The lady wants details. I'll give you the details. You are working tables \r\n8 through 12. This is a list of tonight's special. Memorize that, okay? And the \r\nnext time you're late, I expect a call.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Why does everyone have to take the fun out of things around here? Forget \r\nI even asked!",
        "\r\nBryant: You want me to fill you in on everything I saw?",
        "\r\nBonnie: Everything.",
        "\r\nBryant: No problem. Jen wore this beautiful dress. It made her eyes completely \r\ndance, and the way she smiled --",
        "\r\nBonnie: Okay! Okay, don't even start. Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen. If she's so perfect, \r\nwhy does she want you slumming with the working class instead of being at home, \r\ncounting your millions?",
        "\r\nBryant: You'd have to know her.",
        "\r\nBonnie: I don't think we'd have much in common.",
        "\r\nBryant: Bonnie, Bonnie, you're too caught up on the money thing. The way I see \r\nit is having Jen in my life makes me the wealthiest guy in the world. Believe \r\nme, she's everything.",
        "",
        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, please let it be Billy. Please let it be Billy.",
        "\r\nKim: Hi, sweetheart. May I come in?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. Sure.",
        "\r\nKim: Thank you very much. I was gonna call, but then I realized I had a few \r\nminutes before I'm due at the station, so -- I'd been thinking about you and \r\ndecided to stop. Well, I have to say I was so grateful that you left that \r\nwedding before that wild man started up.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. I heard that he tried to kill Rose and Luke. But Jack shot him?",
        "\r\nKim: He did. It was awful. Does Will know about it?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. Dad's talked to him.",
        "\r\nKim: Oh, good. He's been through so much since your mom's accident. Well, you \r\nboth have.",
        "\r\nJennifer: We're okay, aunt Kim. We're still a family.",
        "\r\nKim: I came to talk about you. You've been so much keeping things together here.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah, you mean before I went off on my living-with-Bryant phase.",
        "\r\nKim: I take it that phase is over?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, well, Bryant and I are fine. Really. It's just -- we just realized \r\nwe weren't ready for that big of a step yet. And dad was really great about it, \r\nyou know? He let me come home, no questions, no hassles.",
        "\r\nKim: So, have you talked to your mom?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah, I tried to call her a couple times.",
        "\r\nKim: Did you go out to see her?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Once. That was enough, though. It was a big mistake.",
        "\r\nKim: Why? What happened?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Well, at first she was really angry at me, and then she started \r\ncrying. And I really thought that we would be all right.- And then she just I'm \r\nnot so happy with the way this is all starting out.",
        "",
        "\r\nPaul: Well, I promise you you'll be happy when it's through, okay? Just go.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Paul -- I heard voices. Who were you talking to?",
        "",
        "\r\nKim: Really?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. I've got dad and my friends. Even Will isn't that annoying all \r\nthe time. Don't tell him I said that, please.",
        "\r\n[Kim laughs]",
        "\r\nKim: I wouldn't dream of it. My lips are sealed.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Thanks.",
        "\r\nKim: And so, what about Bryant?",
        "\r\nJennifer: He's great. I mean -- things get a little complicated sometimes but, \r\nyou know, besides that, great.",
        "\r\nKim: Well, I certainly can't replace your mother, but if there comes a point \r\nwhere you need to talk to somebody, and you need a shoulder to lean on or \r\nwhatever, you can call me.",
        "\r\nJennifer: I will dial 1-800-aunt-Kim.",
        "\r\n[Kim laughs]",
        "\r\nKim: Okay. The lines are always open.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Thanks.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Oh. Ah, sorry. I didn't know you had company.",
        "\r\nKim: Hey! I'm not company.",
        "\r\nAbigail: How are you doing, Mrs. Hughes?",
        "\r\nKim: Hi, darling. How are you?",
        "\r\nAbigail: I'm great.",
        "\r\nKim: Any word from the newlyweds?",
        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah, they landed once they were in Hawaii, and everything's -- great. \r\nYou know, I think Jake planned the perfect honeymoon.",
        "\r\nKim: Oh, I'm sure he did. I'm very happy for both of them.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah, me, too. Um, look; if I walked in on something, I can come back \r\nlater.",
        "\r\nKim: No, no, no. No, not at all. Actually, I'm due at the station. And I'm on my \r\nway out. You just remember what I said, okay? I'm a phone call away.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Of course. Thank you.",
        "\r\nKim: I love you.",
        "\r\nJennifer: I love you, too, aunt Kim.",
        "\r\nKim: Okay. Take care, darling.",
        "\r\nAbigail: You, too.",
        "\r\nKim: Bye-bye.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Bye.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Looks like I walked in on something pretty big.",
        "\r\nJennifer: No. No, we were just talking. She's worried about my mom, but I really \r\ndon't feel like talking about her. So what's up with you?",
        "\r\nAbigail: So I nearly broke my ankle and still missed the call.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Well, I'm sure he'll call back. He said he wants your opinion, right?",
        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah, but on what? Nick's mentoring me and Adam on our video project, \r\nbut -- maybe it's gotta be about that.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Well, you are doing a documentary, right?",
        "\r\nAbigail: Yeah. Why?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, I don't know. I thought I could be your next subject. You know, \r\n\"when best friends lose their minds.\"",
        "\r\n[Abigail laughs]",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah, I'm not kidding, though. I am so completely crazed about so many \r\nthings right now.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Well, who isn't?",
        "\r\nJennifer: You know, at least you have Molly to check in with, you know? She'd \r\nclear her schedule for the next ten years to find out what's going on with you.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Well, your mom will again, too. One day.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Even if she does, how am I supposed to tell her what's been going on \r\nwith me?",
        "\r\nAbigail: With Bryant or Billy?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Well, I can't exactly imagine saying to my mom, \"hey, mom, there's -- \r\nthere's this guy, this guy who's so hot that I don't even feel like I know what \r\nI'm doing!\" Yeah. Yeah, it feels weird telling you.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Telling me what?",
        "\r\nJennifer: At the wedding, I ran into Billy in the house, and --",
        "\r\nAbigail: What?",
        "\r\nJennifer: One thing kinda led to another, and --",
        "\r\nAbigail: No! Jen, no, you didn't!",
        "\r\nJennifer: No, no, I didn't. We almost did. It's always like that with Billy. He \r\ntouches me, and I lose my mind, and -- and Bryant almost caught us.",
        "\r\nAbigail: No -- no way.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. I don't think he suspects anything. But you know what's really \r\ncrazy? I'm not upset that we almost made love. I'm upset that we had to stop.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Wow.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Tell me about it.",
        "\r\nAbigail: But the place was jammed with people.",
        "\r\nJennifer: It didn't matter.",
        "\r\nAbigail: What was Billy even doing there?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, he was there with Bryant. I ended up alone in Lucinda's living \r\nroom. And he came up to say good-bye because he's leaving to go to California \r\nsoon. And I thought, \"okay.\" Right? \"I can deal with this.\" And then, two \r\nseconds after we said good-bye, we were practically tearing each other's clothes \r\noff.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Well, is Billy serious about leaving?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah, there's -- there's no future for us. I don't even know why I \r\nstopped him. I should've just let him walk out the door.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Why didn't you?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Because we were alone. And he said my name, and I forgot where I was \r\nor who I am. What should I do?",
        "\r\nAbigail: Ah, Jen, I just don't want you to get hurt.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Please, Abi. I'm drowning here. Help me.",
        "\r\nAbigail: Okay. Well, the way that I see it, there's only one thing you can do to \r\nmake yourself feel better. You have to tell Bryant the truth about Billy. You \r\nhave to tell him everything.",
        "",
        "\r\nBonnie: This Jen is a fool. You guys could do anything, go anywhere -- live! But \r\ninstead, you're here pouring swill for the desperately middle class.",
        "\r\nBryant: Jennifer Munson has more integrity than any other woman I've ever known \r\nin my life.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Munson?",
        "\r\nBryant: Yeah.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Jennie Munson?",
        "\r\nBryant: Yeah.",
        "\r\nBonnie: That's your Jen? My gosh, she and I grew up together.",
        "\r\nBryant: Ha, ha, is that a joke?",
        "\r\nBonnie: No! No! Her mom and my mom were friends. Oh, this is way too small \r\nworld, even for Oakdale. No, Jennie's incredible. Well, she was so funny, and we \r\nhad a blast together.",
        "\r\nBryant: Have you seen her since you've been back in town?",
        "\r\nBonnie: No, but I heard her mom was in some awful explosion. And I also heard \r\nher husband didn't do it. But the guy still sounds like a nightmare.",
        "\r\nBryant: That nightmare is my father. You see? Not all the interesting people \r\nlive in Europe on grand estates. We have our share of adulterers and thieves.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Bryant, I'm sorry. I should have put it together, though. The name. It \r\nwas my mom's big case.",
        "\r\nBryant: No problem.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Why is Jen so stuck on you being a bartender?",
        "\r\nBryant: 'Cause she's madly in love with me and doesn't care about the money.",
        "\r\nIsaac: I'm so sorry to interrupt this little chat, but you have a customer -- \r\ntable ten?",
        "\r\nBonnie: Oh, well, I was just giving Bryant here some desperately needed advice.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Bryant is a bartender. He gives you advice. You're a waitress. You \r\ndeliver drinks.",
        "\r\nBonnie: With more flair than this place deserves.",
        "\r\nIsaac: If I were you, I wouldn't take anything that girl says to heart.",
        "\r\nBryant: She was just trying to help out.",
        "\r\nIsaac: That's what I'm afraid of.",
        "\r\nBen: Hey, little brother.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Ah, Benjamin.",
        "\r\nBen: Today is your lucky day. How do you feel about blind dates?",
        "\r\nIsaac: If I were you, I would take any date you could get.",
        "\r\nBen: Ooh, ah. No, I'm talking about hooking you up.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Oh, no, no, no, no.",
        "\r\nBen: There is this volunteer at the hospital. She is beautiful and smart. Her \r\nbrother's one of the residents on my rotation.",
        "\r\nIsaac: If she's so hot, why isn't she out having fun instead of volunteering?",
        "\r\nBen: That's what I love about you. You always look at the big picture. Come on, \r\nman. What do you got to lose?",
        "\r\nIsaac: My dignity. I don't do blind dates. Besides, this girl, she probably \r\nisn't even my type.",
        "\r\nBen: She's not your type? Since when is young, smart and sexy not your type? \r\nCheck this out. I even wrote her phone number on a matchbook. Pick her up at \r\n7:00?",
        "\r\nIsaac: No. No! Hey, no, no, I'm not -- no, you go. I'm not going.",
        "\r\nBen: No, come on, man, don't be like that. This is the perfect set-up.",

        "\r\nBonnie: Trust me, I'll know. So, does Jen ever pop in here ever? I would love to \r\nsee her.",
        "\r\nBryant: Yeah, once in a while.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened to her mom, but I'm extra \r\nsorry about what I said about your father. Hey, it's not like you can pick your \r\nfamily.",
        "\r\nBryant: At least Barbara's almost free of him. The divorce is almost final.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Divorce? From what I hear, divorce is way too good for him. Guys like \r\nthat make you wish you'd brought back the guillotine.",

She pulls the same plug, only this time \r\nshe throws in a little mental breakdown to boot, because her sweet son lied to \r\nher. Or because that greedy little opportunist, Carly Tenney, took advantage of \r\na poor, broken woman to get ahead. Well, no, thank you. I have been there.
