        "Emily: Hi!",
        "Susan: Hi, what are you doing here?",
        "Emily: Nothing, just a follow-up with my surgeon. Just wants to make sure everything's healing properly.",
        "Susan: I'm sure it is. I spoke with your doctor, and your surgery went very well.",
        "Emily: I hope so.",
        "Susan: Let know before you leave.",
        "Emily: Yeah, if I can ever find you.",
        "Susan: Page me.",
        "Emily: I'll text you.",
        "Susan: Emily?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: I know you saw him. You did, didn't you?",
        "Emily: Who? Dusty?",
        "Susan: How could you even spend one second with that guy after what he's done to you?",
        "Emily: I needed some answers.",
        "Susan: Did you ask him he could be so cruel and unfeeling to let everybody he supposedly loves think he's dead?",
        "Emily: Among other things.",
        "Susan: And?",
        "Emily: And he had his reasons.",
        "Susan: And that's all?",
        "Emily: No, that's all I'm discussing with you.",
        "Susan: Well, I'm so happy that you had all your questions answered. I'd like to know if you're done with this guy.",
        "Emily: We're friends, Mom.",
        "Susan: Wow is that possible?",
        "Emi: I don't know, it just is. I mean, I know it wouldn't be for you.",
        "Susan: No, it wouldn't be. I think you're asking for trouble.",
        "Emily: Don't I always? I gotta go.",
        "Susan: Don't forget to text me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: You have a fever, which may indicate an infection. The doctor will tell you for sure. He should be here soon.",
        "Meg: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: It's me. How are you?",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Dusty: Worldwide's been notified. The transfer has been made. Paul's debts are gone.",
        "Meg: I know you didn't have to do this for us, Dusty. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: I did it for you.",
        "Meg: Well, I can't tell you how much this means to me.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to. Is Paul behaving himself?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah he's doing a lot better. I don't know why, but suddenly, he's not as angry anymore. I'm just relieved.",
        "Dusty: You're not alone with him, are you? I mean, you got some housekeepers or gardeners around or something?",
        "Meg: Yes, usually. But you don't have to worry. I'm fine, and so is he. Actually, he was feeling so much better, he went out by himself.",
        "Dusty: Really? Where did he go?",
        "Meg: I don't know. But he was in a really good mood.",
        "Dusty: He won't be if he finds out you came to me for help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's board day, right?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hello.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Thought you were in the hospital?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm out.",
        "Lucinda: I heard that you'd had a breakdown.",
        "Paul: What, are you a doctor now?",
        "Lucinda: Pardon me. I'm just showing my concern.",
        "Paul: For me or the townsfolk?",
        "Lucinda: On second thought, I understand why the hospital would want you out.",
        "Paul: Look, maybe this isn't the best way to ask for a favor.",
        "Lucinda: Is that what you're here for?",
        "Paul: Yes, I need your help.",
        "Lucinda: You know, this isn't a good way to ask for a favor.",
        "Paul: You're right. I did have a breakdown. But I'm doing much better now, and I'm trying to make amends, especially with people here at Worldwide.",
        "Lucinda: That's a good idea.",
        "Paul: Yeah, it was wrong of me to use company assets as collateral for the Snyder farm loans.",
        "Lucinda: Well, considering that you kept the whole project outside of the company.",
        "Paul: Look, I did you a favor. The whole thing was a total disaster, and you know it.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, and it almost cost my little grandson, Ethan, his life.",
        "Paul: Yes, I know.",
        "Lucinda: On the other hand, you we the guy that jumped in the hole and got him out.",
        "Paul: I'm just glad he's okay.",
        "Lucinda: So maybe I owe you. I owe you something, I mean, if you don't take it too far.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, I was hoping that you could talk to the board at Worldwide and let them know that I'll pay them back the funds that I owe them, plus interest at prime, but I'm gonna need a little bit of time.",
        "Lucinda: Why are you asking me that?",
        "Paul: Because you carry lot of weight with the board. I was hoping you could plead my case.",
        "Lucinda: That's not what I mean. The funds were transferred this morning.",
        "Paul: What funds?",
        "Lucinda: The money that you cost this company. You don't owe anything.",

        "Holden: She slept with him during the wedding rehearsal?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, remember, we were waiting for her to show up, and she didn't.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Aaron: No, not really.",
        "Holden: It's always the people that we love most that hurt us the worst.",
        "Aaron: Sounds like personal experience.",
        "Holden: Unfortunately, yes. So what are you going to do about it?",
        "Aaron: I don't know.",
        "Holden: The last thing you probably want to do is forgive her, right?",
        "Aaron: Pretty much.",
        "Holden: At some point you gotta figure out whether or not you still want her in your life.",
        "Aaron: I can't make that kind of decision right now.",
        "Holden: It's gonna take time. It's gonna take a lot of time.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, is that more personal experience?",
        "Holden: Pretty much.",
        "Aaron: So does that mean you're still not over Lily being with Dusty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey! Ohh!",
        "Alison: I can't believe it. You're really alive!",
        "Dusty: You keep that squeeze going, and I'm going to be dead.",
        "Alison: Oh, you have no idea how happy I am to see you.",
        "Dusty: You're the only one who feels that way.",
        "Alison: Well, I guess I'm the only one who knows how amazing you are.",
        "Dusty: I guess that would be true.",
        "Alison: Oh, God, I can't believe it! I have thought about you so much! I mean, the money you left me, it turned my life around. I wouldn't be in nursing school without it.",
        "Dusty: I want to see grades.",
        "Alison: No, you don't, but they're getting better. And I promise, I'm going to pay you back every penny you gave me.",
        "Dusty: No, that's okay, I don't want it.",
        "Alison: Of course I have to give you it back. Now that you're not six feet under, I mean, I can't really call it an inheritance anymore.",
        "Dusty: No, no, I mean it.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Dusty: I don't want it back. Because the last thing I need right now is more money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What are you talking about? I didn't pay anybody back.",
        "Lucinda: Here it is. A notice to the CFO of an electronic transference of funds.",
        "Paul: Where is it from?",
        "Lucinda: The grand Cayman Islands.",
        "Paul: But who paid it?",
        "Lucinda: You did.",
        "Paul: I did not!",
        "Lucinda: Well, it says you did.",
        "Paul: But I didn't pay it.",
        "Lucinda: Barbara, maybe?",
        "Paul: No, if my mom had this kind of money, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.",
        "Lucinda: You're a real lucky guy. You got a fairy godmother out there. Where are you going, Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm gonna find out who paid my tab. Nobody rides to my rescue and gets away with it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: If things are going to work for our family, I have to trust her. Nothing else matters.",
        "Aaron: You think she feels the same way?",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, so do I. She loves you. Don't ask me why.",
        "[Holden chuckles]",
        "Holden: I know, go figure. So what are you going to do?",
        "Aaron: I love her, you know? I love Alison. I always have -- but I'm not sure how she feels about me right now.",
        "Holden: There's only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You know, it was totally all my fault.",
        "Dusty: I don't believe that.",
        "Alison: Trust me.",
        "Dusty: No, you got to convince me.",
        "Alison: I missed my wedding rehearsal because I was in bed with somebody else.",
        "Dusty: All right, now I'm starting to buy it.",
        "Alison: I did everything wrong. And the thing is, I knew it. It was like I was on this runaway train, and there was no way to stop it, and nowhere to get off.",
        "Dusty: Just a brick wall ahead. I got you.",
        "Alison: I sure could've used your advice.",
        "Dusty: Well, listen -- if two people are in love, they can make it through anything. If not, you know, eventually, it's going to go south.",
        "Alison: I don't know if Aaron cares one way or another, after this.",
        "Dusty: He loves you. He always has. The question is how do you feel?",
        "Doctor #1: Sorry to keep you waiting.",
        "Alison: Sorry.",
        "Doctor #1: I understand your gunshot wound may be infected?",
        "Dusty: Well, stuff's been oozing out of it. Doctor #1 let me take a look.",
        "Alison: Wa -- wait a minute! Gunshot wound?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Ali Cat, you're not the only one having a bad week.",
        "Alison: My God, Dusty. Who shot you?",
        "Dusty: My buddy, Paul Ryan. Who else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, I just spoke with my mom, and she didn't pay off Worldwide.",
        "Meg: Well, it could be anyone.",
        "Paul: Anyone with a tanker-size boat full of liquid assets.",
        "Meg: Maybe it was your father.",
        "Paul: He's dead.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe he set it up before he died. You know how much trouble he was getting you into with the project.",
        "Paul: Whoever did this is alive, and I'm going to find them.",
        "Meg: You know, Paul why does it really matter? I mean, can't you just accept it, as a stroke of luck? You deserve it.",
        "Paul: No. Somebody did this for a reason. They're setting a trap. I need to figure out who it is before they spring it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor #1: I'm going to prescribe an oral antibiotic as well as an ointment you'll need to apply directly to the wound.",
        "Alison: I will get it filled for you at the hospital pharmacy and then meet me outside, okay?",
        "Dusty: Okay.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Doctor #1: I also want you to get plenty of rest. Come back to see me next week.",
        "Dusty: Sure thing.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hello?",
        "Meg: Hey, I just talked to Paul. He knows someone paid off his debts to Worldwide, and now he wants to find out who.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry, there's no way he'll ever trace it back to me. Or you.",
        "Meg: I hope not.",
        "Dusty: Hello, Susan.",
        "Susan: How in the hell can you be alive?",
        "Dusty: Oh, it's nice to see you, too.",
        "Susan: I saw your corpse. I read the autopsy report. I consoled my poor daughter when she was devastated by your death.",
        "Dusty: Well, like I told your daughter -- I wish there was another way.",
        "Susan: Oh right, right. \"You're so sorry, but you had no choice",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't. I mean really, it was definitely -- it was a matter of life and death.",
        "Susan: Listen, I want you to stay away from Emily. You've already caused her enough pain to last two lifetimes.",
        "Dusty: It wasn't intentional.",
        "Susan: In fact, if you ever even come this close to upsetting her again, I will come after you myself. And this time, you definitely will be dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: The worst part was, after everything we went through, everything we meant to each other, she did not want my input on a decision that was going to affect both of our lives.",
        "Margo: Women her age sometimes don't want to have another child. And it is her body.",
        "Casey: But it was our future. Together.",
        "Margo: Well, that's her way of maybe telling you she didn't think you had a future together.",
        "Casey: You realize that makes everything worse.",
        "Margo: Yep, sorry.",
        "Casey: That's okay. You're right. I would've preferred the I-told-you-sos.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Oh, you're finished already?",
        "Emily: Hi, yeah. All checked out. Everything good.",
        "Susan: Good.",
        "Emily: All right, I'm going to head back to work. I'll see you around.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: Post-surgery checkup.",
        "Alison: Are you okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, great.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Emily: Who are you looking for?",
        "Alison: Dusty.",
        "Emily: He's -- he's here?",
        "Alison: Yeah, his gunshot wound is infected. And did you know he was shot? By Paul Ryan?",
        "Susan: Unfortunately, he missed.",
        "Emily: Mother, please.",
        "Alison: I have his medication. He was supposed to wait here for me.",
        "Emily: Well, I haven't seen him.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't know why he would leave without getting his prescriptions. I hope he's okay.",
        "Susan: I can't believe this! He's already hooked both of you, like a couple of sardines!",
        "Alison: What is she talking about?",
        "Emily: Our inability to resist Dusty's charms.",
        "Alison: What charms?",
        "[Both laughs]",
        "Susan: This isn't funny! In fact, I told him --",
        "Emily: You saw him?",
        "Alison: When?",
        "Susan: Uh, yes. Just before.",
        "Emily: What did you say?",
        "Susan: Um, I told him how I felt.",
        "Alison: Mother, you probably scared him away!",
        "Susan: What if I did?",
        "Alison: He needs these antibiotics!",
        "Emily: Give them to me. I will drop them off on my way to work. And you --",
        "Susan: What is there about that guy? Nobody can see him for who he really is?",
        "Alison: He has always been there for me, Mom. He is paying for nursing school.",
        "Susan: But what does he want in return, now that he's no longer a corpse?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "Susan: Trust me, he wants something. And you won't like it -- very much.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Susan: Is that him?",
        "Alison: No. It's Aaron. Hey.",
        "Aaron: Hi, it's me. You busy?",
        "Alison: I'm at work.",
        "Aaron: You think you can take a break and meet me?",
        "Alison: I'm not really sure what there is to say.",
        "Aaron: I don't know. But if I don't at least try to talk to you about this, I'm going to regret it. Let's just bite the bullet and do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Hey. You want to sit down? You want something to t?",
        "Alison: I'm good.",
        "Aaron: So, I've been thinking, a lot. And I'm not ready to lose you. I love you.",
        "Alison: Aaron --",
        "Aaron: All right, listen -- I know we've hurt each other, but we can get through it. I don't want to lose you.",
        "Alison: First of all, we haven't hurt each other. I've hurt you. Over and over.",
        "Aaron: I don't care.",
        "Alison: You should.",
        "Aaron: It doesn't matter, Ali. What matters is that we love each other, and we can overcome anything.",
        "Alison: What we keep having to overcome are things I do to you, and I hate it. I hate it that I keep hurting you, and I hate it even more that you keep taking me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I know why you're here, and it's not going to work. I am not going to talk to Lily for you.",
        "Lucinda: She isn't answering my phone calls.",
        "Holden: That's because she doesn't want to talk to you.",
        "Lucinda: She would, if you asked her.",
        "Holden: Luke already tried. Didn't work.",
        "Lucinda: Why is she doing this to her family?",
        "Holden: She's not doing it to her family. She's doing it to you.",
        "Lucinda: You know why I did it. I did it for you and for her, and for your marriage. Dusty was breaking it up, and I put a stop to that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, and it almost killed her in the process.",
        "Lucinda: Don't tell me that you stand there and say that you weren't relieved when you heard that he was dead.",
        "Holden: He wasn't dead. It was a lie!",
        "Lucinda: Well, it got the two of you and back together again.",
        "Holden: Yeah, maybe it did.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Then you tell her I lied for her!",
        "Holden: No, I won't do it. She doesn't want you interfering in her life.",
        "Lucinda: She doesn't want me saving her life?",
        "Holden: Look, this is not my problem. It's your problem. You deal with it.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you want to know what I think? I'll tell you what I think. This is what I think. I don't think she's so much angry at me -- I think she's angry at Dus -- deeply angry, sexually angry, and it's too threatening for her, so she takes it all out on me! And let tell you something, Darling Holden -- that is your problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're my accountant! Shouldn't you know who's paying off all of my debts? I got to go, I'll call you later.",
        "Emily: Oh --",
        "Paul: I've been looking everywhere for you.",
        "Emily: Why is that?",
        "Paul: I need a favor.",
        "Emily: From me?",
        "Paul: Yes, from you.",
        "Emily: And you actually think I'm going to say yes?",
        "Paul: Well, couldn't you, at least, find out what it is before you say no?",
        "Emily: Why? Does it matter?",
        "Paul: To me, yeah. Who paid off all of my debts to Worldwide?",
        "Emily: Uh -- your mother, right?",
        "Paul: No, I just talked to her.",
        "Emily: Well, who else would it be?",
        "Paul: That's what I want to find out.",
        "Emily: I have no idea.",
        "Paul: Well, c'mon. Emily, you're a reporter, at Worldwide. Don't you know what's going on there?",
        "Emily: You know what, it's funny. People don't sit around talking about you and your problems.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: C'mon, really -- you got to tell me who this was.",
        "Emily: How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Paul: You're a big-time journalist. C'mon, an anonymous source penetrates the firewall of a multinational corporation and funnels money to exactly where it needs to go, as if by magic. Don't you find that interesting? Don't you find that worthy of investigating?",
        "Emily: No, actually, it sounds like accounting's problem, not mine.",
        "Paul: Maybe it's like, you know, industrial espionage?",
        "Emily: You know what, you need to do yourself a favor and chalk it up as a stroke of richly undeserved good luck.",
        "Paul: That is exactly what Meg said. Only she said I deserve it.",
        "Emily: Well, she was half right, anyway.",
        "Paul: Could you just find out who it was?",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, I cannot help you.",
        "Paul: I thought you liked your job.",
        "Emily: Did you just threaten me?",
        "Paul: You need to help me.",
        "Emily: Ask your wife!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: If she wants to leave, I can't force her to stay.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you're such a fool!",
        "Holden: Yeah? And you know what, you can't figure out why your daughter wants nothing to do with you.",
        "Lucinda: You're a fool! I'm trying to save your marriage.",
        "Holden: Well, don't!",
        "Lucinda: Okay, fine. Fine! Do nothing. Just hang around this retro farm on its contaminated land, and let yourself go down the retro -- sink!",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "Holden: Hi, Margo.",
        "Margo: Hello. Hello. That sounded serious.",
        "Holden: What is this? Visiting day?",
        "Margo: Well, Holden -- I need your help.",
        "Holden: About what?",
        "Margo: Well, what did she need?",
        "Holden: Nothing. Don't worry about it.",
        "Margo: Well, I want to talk about Dusty Donovan. I want to make him pay for what's he done.",

        "Emily: Hey Dusty, are you in there?",
        "Dusty: The door's open.",
        "Emily: Hey. Ali said you left the hospital without your prescriptions.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I didn't think it was a good idea to hang around.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I heard. My mother. Sorry about that. Listen, Alison said you're supposed to start on these antibiotics right away.",
        "Dusty: This is awfully nice of you.",
        "Emily: It's no problem.",
        "Dusty: I feel better already.",
        "Emily: It takes a little longer than that.",
        "Dusty: You really can't, sometimes.",
        "Emily: There's also some this -- ointment.",
        "Dusty: Mmm. Sounds sexy.",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "Emily: I don't think that's what it's for.",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "Emily: But I'll give it a shot if you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You need and deserve someone who knows what they want, who isn't constantly second-guessing themselves. Who'd rather die, than ever do anything to hurt you. And, by now, it's obvious, that that isn't me.",
        "Aaron: So it's over.",
        "Alison: It has to be, Aaron. For your sake, and mine.",
        "Aaron: I just wanted to hear it from you.",
        "Casey: Aaron -- that didn't look like that was fun.",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Besides all the people he hurt from faking his own death, he committed some pretty serious crimes. He defrauded the hospital, he misled the police. He's at the center of a criminal conspiracy.",
        "Holden: What conspiracy?",
        "Margo: Well, you don't think he pulled off a major fraud like that on his own. He had accomplices. At the hospital, at the funeral home, who knows where else.",
        "Holden: You think this has something to do with me?",
        "Margo: Well, you were right in the middle of it, weren't you? In fact, there was a time when you wanted Donovan dead yourself.",
        "Holden: You think I was part of it?",
        "Margo: No, but I'm guessing you might know who was.",
        "Holden: I had nothing to do with it.",
        "Margo: And then when he reappeared, you were right in the middle of that, too.",
        "Holden: I was looking for my sister.",
        "Margo: But you found her. And she was fine. But you didn't tell anybody he was still alive.",
        "Holden: Margo, are you accusing me of a crime, or not?",
        "Margo: I'm just wondering why you'd go out of your way to help this guy after everything he's done to you.",
        "Holden: He saved my sister's life.",
        "Margo: He also ruined your marriage, and almost cost Lily her life. Is that who you're protecting? Lily?",
        "Holden: Lily would never help Dusty fake his death. It almost destroyed her.",
        "Margo: Come on, Holden. If it's not Lily, who are you protecting?",

        "Meg: You're back. How are you? You must be tired.",
        "Paul: You sound like me.",
        "Meg: Maybe you should sit down.",
        "Paul: No. I have something to ask you. I want you to be honest with me.",
        "Meg: Okay, what?",
        "Paul: Who paid off my debts to Worldwide?",
        "Meg: Why would you think I know?",
        "Paul: Because every time I ask you, you do something like that, and avoid me. It was Dusty, wasn't it? Why would do something like that?",
        "Meg: Because I asked him to. Paul, you were out of control. And, we couldn't talk about your problem, because you wouldn't admit you had one. And I was frightened to death. I didn't know what you would do.",
        "Paul: You asked him to save me?",
        "Meg: Yeah, and he agreed.",
        "Paul: And he agreed.",
        "Meg: Look, I'm sorry. I knew you wouldn't want him doing anything for you, but you were sick. And they were going to send you to jail. I had no choice. And I asked him to help, and he did. Go ahead, tear my head off.",
        "Paul: That's the single last thing I would ever do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It was just a mistake from the beginning. I guess I thought getting married would solve all my problems. Btu I should've known it would only make things worse. And end up hurting Aaron, as usual.",
        "Casey: Poor dude.",
        "Alison: You'd think he would've learned by now. I mean, he was just in here, asking me to give it another try.",
        "Casey: And you said no?",
        "Alison: I can't just keep doing this to him.",
        "Casey: Well, if you're sure you can't stop, you're doing him a favor.",
        "Alison: Is that how you feel about Emily?",
        "Casey: Not yet. What is it about you Stewart women that keeps us coming back?",
        "Alison: We're jerks?",
        "Casey: Irresistible jerks.",
        "Alison: Oh, that makes me feel so much better.",
        "[Both laughs]",
        "Casey: So, you going to tell Chris what just happened?",
        "Alison: No, that's over. I mean, it was really just a way out of my marriage to Aaron.",
        "Casey: I thought Aaron was a way out of your problems with Chris.",
        "Alison: See what it's like to deal with being me?",
        "Casey: No, it's not just you. Relationships suck.",
        "Alison: Yeah. They do.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: And they hurt. And there's really nothing you can do about the pain.",
        "Casey: Actually, there is. Come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, well, well, Lucinda. You and Holden certainly had a knock-down drag-out, didn't you?",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Are you following me, Margo?",
        "Margo: No, of course not. Why would I do that?",
        "Lucinda: You tell me.",
        "Margo: Well, I just want to get your side of the story.",
        "Lucinda: What story is that?",
        "Margo: How Dusty Donovan faked his own death.",
        "Lucinda: Why would you think that I had any input in that subject?",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Did Holden say something to you?",
        "Margo: We talked about who might have helped Donovan do the impossible.",
        "Lucinda: And Holden said it was me?",
        "Margo: Well, was it?",
        "Lucinda: Holden's in such a state these days.",
        "Margo: Oh yes, I know. Well, who wouldn't be?",
        "Lucinda: You can't give much credence to anything he says.",
        "Margo: Actually, I thought what he said made a lot of sense.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, about what?",
        "Margo: About how Donovan pulled it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Are you okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm fine. Why?",
        "Meg: You're not tearing the house apart. And me with it.",
        "Paul: Look, I'm not thrilled that you went to Dusty, but I understand it. I was acting pretty sick. I'm surprised he bothered to help me. It was very generous of him.",
        "Meg: Paul, he's not as bad as you think.",
        "Paul: Dusty and I have a lot of history.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and he doesn't want your father's will to cause any more.",
        "Paul: Great, so he's going to give me the rest of the money?",
        "Meg: The only reason he wants the money is so he can keep looking for Johnny and Lucy. That's the only thing he cares about. He hired this expensive private investigator in San Francisco to head up this global search.",
        "Paul: To lose a wife and a child -- that would be awful. No one should have to go through that.",
        "Meg: You're being very understanding.",
        "Paul: Am I? You know, that's me, Mr. Sensitive.",
        "Meg: Yeah, the funny thing is, that is you. You know, I'm going to lie down, get some rest. Why don't you join me?",
        "Paul: If I join you, then neither one of us will get any rest.",
        "Meg: Mmm, sounds good.",
        "Paul: Yeah. That sounds great. I'll be up in a little bit.",
        "Meg: Oh, don't forget these. I really do think they're working. Here you go.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Maybe they are.",

        "Emily: How's that feel?",
        "Dusty: Great. Feels good. Good hands.",
        "Emily: I meant the ointment.",
        "Dusty: That feels good, too.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hello?",
        "Meg: I am so sorry to keep bothering you.",
        "Dusty: No you're not, Meg.",
        "Meg: Paul knows.",
        "Dusty: Who told him?",
        "Meg: I think he just figured it out.",
        "Dusty: Did he freak out?",
        "Meg: No. He just accepted it.",
        "Dusty: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I was a little surprised, myself. I guess he's getting he's getting some perspective.",
        "Dusty: Paul?",
        "Meg: He was just very grateful that you were able to help, and that you did it.",
        "Dusty: All right, call me if you need anything.",
        "Meg: I will. But I think it's okay.",
        "Emily: Maybe you should have Meg come over and put this on?",
        "Dusty: What is that, jealousy?",
        "Emily: No. Meg's a nurse, remember?",
        "Dusty: Well, you're good at it. It's obviously in your genes.",
        "Emily: Well, taking care of people is not a part of my DNA. Unless -- it's someone I care about.",
        "Dusty: Oh, is that a come on, because my doctor told me to avoid any physical exertion.",
        "Emily: That's funny, I'm the one doing all the hard work.",
        "Dusty: You remember that night we spent together, before I died?",
        "Emily: I've tried not to.",
        "Dusty: Me too, but I think about it all the time. What do you think would've happened?",
        "Emily: I don't know",
        "Dusty: Do you ever wonder? I mean, if we'd had the time to get it right?",
        "Emily: It doesn't matter. We didn't have the time.",
        "Dusty: We do now.",
        "Emily: We're not the same people, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You look familiar.",
        "Emily: So do you. My mother warned me about this.",
        "Dusty: You always do what your mother tells you?",
        "Emily: Uh -- pretty much never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Meg wants Dustin not you. And Dustin wants Meg. Otherwise, why is he playing the white knight for you?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter why he did it. Meg isn't interested in Dusty.",
        "James: You really believe that?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "James: How can you be sure?",
        "Paul: I'm just sure.",
        "James: Then you have to get rid of him once and for all.",
        "Paul: Get rid of -- this is ins -- that's kind of funny, don't you think? Hmm? It is, it's funny. Me, asking the dead guy if he's insane. You are the one that I need to get rid of. Let's just see if they finally invented a cure for you.",
        "[Paul starts popping his pills]",
        "James: Don't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Is this really your idea of a cure for heartbreak?",
        "Casey: That's right.",
        "Alison: So, when do I start to feel better?",
        "Casey: I don't know.",
        "Alison: Then I guess I'll have to keep playing!",
        "Casey: Rrr!",

        "Lucinda: I have a board meeting shortly.",
        "Margo: You know what I was thinking?",
        "Lucinda: I'm sure you're going to tell me.",
        "Margo: I'm sure I am, too. I was thinking that whoever his accomplice was, they had motive, of course, they have to means, and the opportunity to help him out. How many people do you think could do that?",
        "Lucinda: I have no idea.",
        "Margo: Just, just -- you know. A rough number, ball park, how many?",
        "Lucinda: Is this how you run your investigations now? You ask people to guess?",
        "Margo: Sometimes.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Lucinda: I'd never make detective.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. No, you wouldn't.",
        "Lucinda: If you'll excuse me?",
        "Margo: Sure, yeah. Well, if you're not lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I'm still here. Maybe these pills aren't what Meg says they are.",
        "Paul: Meg's not poisoning me.",
        "James: No, not poison at all. Much, much too obvious. But, you know Paul, your behavior still is -- bizarre. You don't seem like you're really recovering. You could slide into breakdown.",
        "Paul: Meg loves me.",
        "James: You know, your faith in Meg is touching, especially considering all the evidence to the contrary.",
        "Paul: What evidence?",
        "James: Well, listen. Take me, for example. You said yourself, that were talking to a dead man. Maybe you're not healing quite as fast as you think you are.",
        "Paul: I'm not listening to this.",
        "James: Oh, no, no. If Meg wants to be with Dusty then she has to get rid of you. And murder -- well that's messy. Meg is very elegant -- elegant. But, she is a nurse. And you have had a breakdown.",
        "Paul: Oh, this is -- this is insane.",
        "James: Exactly, right. And it wouldn't be that difficult. Meg knows how tenacious you are, to the point of obsession. All she'd have to do is give you a nudge.",
        "Paul: No, she wouldn't do that.",
        "James: You sure?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "James: There's a way to find out.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not going through her bag!",
        "James: Afraid of what you may might find?",
        "Paul: No.",

        "Emily: So what now?",
        "Dusty: Well, at least I know there's someone out there I can trust. I've been loaded down, you know, with so many secrets, I was afraid to trust anyone.",
        "Emily: I know the feeling.",
        "Dusty: I trust you, you hear me?",
        "Emily: I trust you, too.",
        "Dusty: And right now, that means more to me than anything.",

        "Meg: Hey, I thought you were coming upstairs.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I was just waiting for the drugs kick in.",
        "Meg: I think they have. I forgot this.",
        "Paul: Oh, right where you left it. I got a call, though, and I got to go out of town tonight, on some business.",
        "Meg: Wait -- I don't know about, Paul. I mean, you're still recovering.",
        "Paul: Well, yeah, but it's just one night. I think it'll be good for me, you know, help me clear my head.",
        "Meg: You know, you were just released from the hospital under my care.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: And I'm really supposed to be with you.",
        "Paul: So, why don't you write down everything that it is that I have to do, and I'll do it. I'll be fine.",
        "Meg: Promise you'll call?",
        "Paul: Of course. I always call.",
