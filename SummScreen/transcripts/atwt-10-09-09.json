        "Holden: Don't defend him. I went through hell to come back to you, and the minute I get back, I find you married to another man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Maybe you're at the farm. Please answer. Please answer. Please answer! You can't leave me again. Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: I told you people, I don't want a lawyer.",
        "Holden: Good, because I don't think I could bargain your way out of a parking ticket.",
        "Maeve: Holden. What are you -- I -- I never thought -- oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, good thing the doctor said there was nothing to worry about. I just hope I didn't pull you away from anything too important.",
        "Vienna: Oh, no, no, no, no. Not at all. Henry and I -- we've been way too wrapped up in ourselves lately. It was actually quite nice to think about someone else for a change.",
        "Katie: So things are good with you, too?",
        "Vienna: Well, if you don't count his mother's constant interference, yes, absolutely. But Audrey -- she's been all over Henry ever since he decided to give away his inheritance to charity.",
        "Katie: Whoa. Wait. Back up a second. Henry voluntarily gave away money?",
        "Vienna: Yes, every single penny.",
        "Katie: Wow. And who's holding the gun to his head?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Audrey: Hey, we really need to talk.",
        "Henry: Hey, you really need to come back tomorrow. I'm in the middle of something right now, okay?",
        "Audrey: Oh, yeah, yeah. You -- we all are. We have a big, fat problem.",
        "Henry: Now what?",
        "Audrey: Has -- has Lloyd called you?",
        "Henry: Lloyd?",
        "Audrey: Lloyd. Laundry basket Lloyd, James' attorney?",
        "Henry: No, no. That Lloyd -- no, no, no. Why?",
        "Audrey: Because Barbara has filed an injunction against the will. She's cut off all future payments until she gets her 50%.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. She can't do that. She can't do that.",
        "Audrey: Yeah, she has. And besides the fact we are behind schedule with Ralph already because Vienna took that check!",
        "Henry: I know, I know.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Well, you know Ralph isn't gonna be very happy about this.",
        "Henry: Right, right. So, um, what I will do -- what I will do is I will call Lloyd, and we will find a way to work around this, okay?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Audrey: Good.",
        "Henry: That's got to be the, uh, flower delivery guy. I got some -- now, would you -- would you mind taking care of that, please?",
        "Audrey: Uh, yeah, sure. Absolutely. Oh, thank you. Henry --",
        "Henry: In a minute.",
        "Audrey: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Get off that phone now!",
        "Henry: What, what? Wait, what is that? I didn't order that. I ordered roses.",
        "Audrey: I know. They're not to Vienna. They're to you.",
        "Henry: \"Roses are red. Violets are blue. I'd pay my debts if I were you.\" Oh, my God.",
        "Audrey: \"Oh, my God\" is right. I told you, Ralph isn't gonna be happy. What are we gonna do?",
        "Henry: Um, we are going to panic and get rid of the flowers, and we're gonna do that simultaneously.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Go!",
        "Henry: Barb --",
        "Barbara: Henry. Have you talked to your lawyer today?",
        "Henry: If you are referring to the injunction, yes. I'm aware of what you've done.",
        "Barbara: I had no other choice. I had to protect my interests.",
        "Henry: I wish there was some way I could convince you to change your mind.",
        "Barbara: Is that what these are for? Oh. You shouldn't have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Speaking of the devil, and he appears. I'm so sorry. And, you know, I was so busy at that blasted board meeting. It lasted forever, and I didn't want to miss your wedding.",
        "Damian: Yeah, about that.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, yeah, about that. What are you doing here by yourself? You should be out there in the -- in the beautiful honeymoon suite with your beautiful bride.",
        "Damian: I wish I were, but Lily's not with me.",
        "Lisa: Where -- I don't understand. Where is she?",
        "Damian: With her husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden?",
        "Meg: Where is he? I want to see him. Holden!",
        "Lily: Meg, wait. You can't.",
        "Meg: He's my brother, Lily, and he's alive, and you're not gonna keep me from him. Holden!",
        "Lily: He's not here.",
        "Meg: What do you mean he's not here?",
        "Lily: He's gone.",
        "Meg: I don't understand. Luke came over to the farm. He said that Holden was here.",
        "Lily: He was.",
        "Meg: So are you saying he left? Where did he go?",
        "Lily: I don't know. When I left him, he was in the bedroom, and when I got back --",
        "Meg: Okay, so he just disappeared without -- where the hell were you?",
        "Lily: I was with Damian.",
        "Meg: Holden is alive, and you went to be with Damian?",
        "Lily: I am not going to stand here and explain myself to you.",
        "Meg: Because you can't. Everyone told you that you were rushing into this, that you were being completely disrespectful to Holden's memory.",
        "Lily: I thought he was dead, Meg! My God, when he walked through that door, my heart stopped!",
        "Meg: Oh, I bet it did.",
        "Lily: I just -- I wanted to hold him and -- and tell him that he was safe and that he was home and everything was gonna be all right.",
        "Meg: That's what you wanted to do? But somehow, you took a wrong turn and ended up at Damian's?",
        "Lily: What is wrong with you? How can you be so vicious?",
        "Meg: No, no, you know what, Lily? I feel for you. I really do. It must be tough trying to decide which husband to share your bed with tonight.",
        "Lily: That's enough!",
        "Meg: But I guess Holden already made that choice for you, didn't he? He realized that you never really loved him, so he just walked out on you.",
        "[Lily smacks Meg]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, what's going on here? This is about the money?",
        "Maeve: And Eb. I swear, even from the grave, that man is ruining my life.",
        "Holden: You know he's dead.",
        "Maeve: Yeah. I heard it happened in Oakdale.",
        "Holden: It happened in my house.",
        "Maeve: What? Is everyone all right? Tell me the kids are all right.",
        "Holden: They're fine.",
        "Maeve: Thank God.",
        "Holden: How are you?",
        "Maeve: I know I should be upset. I mean, the man was my husband. But I figure, you know what? I cried enough tears over that man, and all he left me with was painful memories.",
        "Holden: He left you a little more than that.",
        "Maeve: You mean the money.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Where is it? What happened to it?",
        "Maeve: I'm not telling.",
        "Holden: Maeve --",
        "Maeve: Hmm-mm.",
        "Holden: The cops -- they know. They know Eb and Skaggs stole that 100 grand. They're not gonna stop until they find it.",
        "Maeve: Well, let them look, because they're never gonna find it.",
        "Holden: Can't you see that you're just making this worse for yourself?",
        "Maeve: I'll take my chances. Look, Holden, I need that money. Eb left me with nothing -- no way to take care of myself. I need it.",
        "Holden: I will help you out. You just need to tell them where the money is.",
        "Maeve: No. I can't. Please.",
        "Detective: Visiting hours are over.",
        "Holden: I don't care. I'm not going anywhere until I get some answers.",
        "Maeve: No, Holden, please don't.",
        "Holden: Why haven't you let Mrs. Stone go?",
        "Detective: Because her husband stole a boatload of money, and we're dead set on finding it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know how much I adore Henry. I do. It's just that we both know he likes his cake and the platter it came on.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but you also know how much love can change a man for the better. I mean, look at Brad. He used to have quite a reputation before you. Now he's a devoted husband and a proud papa to be.",
        "Katie: Yes, you're right. He has changed a lot since we first met.",
        "Vienna: And so has my Henry.",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. More power to you.",
        "Vienna: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Just out of sheer curiosity, though, what's the name of the charity?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why, Henry, I have to admit that you have wonderful taste in fashion, as well as flowers.",
        "Henry: You like them?",
        "Barbara: Exotics are my favorite.",
        "Henry: Well, uh, that's why I chose them.",
        "Barbara: It wasn't just a random choice?",
        "Henry: No, no, no. In fact, I -- I've, uh, made it a point to learn everything about you.",
        "Barbara: So these really are for me?",
        "Henry: Well, who else would be more deserving?",
        "Barbara: You mean who else are you trying to court favor with.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. Do you really think that's what I'm up to here?",
        "Barbara: Now, Henry, you had to know that the minute I put that injunction in place, I knew that you would do everything you can to get me to change my mind.",
        "Henry: Is it working?",
        "Barbara: Now, a smart man would know that it would take more than a simple bouquet to get Barbara Ryan to change her mind.",
        "Henry: What would be enough?",
        "Barbara: Why don't you think about it? Thank you for the flowers. They'll look lovely in my suite.",
        "Audrey: What are you doing?! Go after her!",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Audrey: Yes. That woman reeks desperation. She'll be putty in your hands. Go, go, go, go.",
        "Henry: I'm not going to sleep with Barbara Ryan, okay? There is another way out of this whole Ralph mess, and I will figure it out.",
        "Audrey: Or die trying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: I know how much this meant to you. And well, let's see. If Holden is alive, then that means he's still Lily's husband. And so that really changes things, doesn't it?",
        "Damian: Not really.",
        "Lisa: Sure it does.",
        "Damian: What if I don't want it to change?",
        "Lisa: Well -- I don't think you have any say in this.",
        "Damian: Why not?",
        "Lisa: Because -- Damian, it's called destiny. Oh, you have so much to give the right woman. And don't waste all of your time just -- just trying to fight a losing battle.",
        "Damian: You really think that's what I'm doing?",
        "Lisa: Well, don't you?",
        "Damian: No, I'm not. I'm sorry, Lisa, but some things are worth fighting for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Feel better now?",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: You know what, Lily? Save your apologies. All things considered, a slap in the face is nothing compared to what you've done to Holden.",
        "Lily: It was never my intention to hurt Holden. I -- I prayed every night that he would come home to us.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Do you mean, um, every night you didn't spend with Damian, trying to forget him?",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Meg: Whatever you say. In this case, actions speak louder than words.",
        "Lily: You know what? I don't need to listen to this. Holden isn't here, and I want you to leave.",
        "Meg: All of this could have been avoided if you had really loved my brother.",
        "Lily: I love Holden with my entire heart. How dare you question that!",
        "Meg: How could I not question it, Lily, when it's been only a matter of months before you took another man as your husband?! Oh, I -- I'm sorry. Is this where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? Because you're not the victim here! Holden is!",
        "Lily: I know that.",
        "Meg: You know, when I think about how hard he fought to come back to you, to this family, and for what? The life here that he had doesn't exist anymore.",
        "Lily: I'm still here. Our children are still here.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah. Just one big, happy family. Except -- oh, whose ring is that? Husband number one, or husband number two?",
        "Lily: Get out.",
        "Meg: You know, you had this coming, Lily. You're gonna get exactly what you deserve, and you're not gonna have Holden or Damian to cling to anymore.",
        "Lily: I said get out!",
        "Damian: What the hell's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maeve: I don't know anything about the robbery money. I swear, Eb never shared anything with me, unless you want to count the back of his hand.",
        "Holden: She's telling the truth, Detective. I can vouch for that. She is as much a victim in all this as I am. When her husband held me captive, I saw the way he treated her. He abused her emotionally, physically. I can tell you this -- if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here right now. She saved my life. She's incredible.",
        "Detective: Unfortunately, Eb Stone is dead. He can't defend himself.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know he's dead. He died in my living room. And Skaggs -- he was killed in the same accident that -- that I nearly lost my life in. So I guess it's pretty safe to say that the money went up in flames with my truck. And you can call the police in Kentucky. They'll tell you the same thing. You're holding an innocent woman on charges that probably won't stick. Don't you think she's been through enough? Or do you need to see the bruises that he left her with?",
        "Detective: We'll look into that. In the meantime, you're free to go.",
        "Maeve: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! The way you just stood up for me -- nobody's ever done anything like that before for me before, ever.",
        "Holden: Well, you need to do something for me.",
        "Maeve: Anything. Anything. You just name it.",
        "Holden: You need to forget about that money. You need to let it go. You do not need this following you around the rest of your life.",
        "Maeve: I only have the rest of my life because of you and that money.",
        "Holden: Maeve, I'm serious.",
        "Maeve: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Maeve: Why did you come back here? You were finally home with your family? Why? Why would you come back? It's all you talked about -- getting back to them.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Maeve: So why aren't you with them now?",
        "Holden: Um -- let's just say my timing was off.",
        "Maeve: What does that mean?",
        "Holden: I, uh -- I walked in on something.",
        "Maeve: What?",
        "Holden: It was a wedding. Everyone was there. And, um, I guess I was just too late.",
        "Maeve: Who was getting married?",
        "Holden: Lily was.",
        "Maeve: To whom?",
        "Holden: A man named Damian Grimaldi.",
        "Maeve: The fancy suit I saw her with at the bank.",
        "Holden: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maeve: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: The detective said you could go. So I guess this is good-bye.",
        "Maeve: Please don't say that. Good-byes aren't for us, not -- not after everything we've been through. Please.",
        "Holden: All right, all right. Then I'll say, uh, take care of yourself.",
        "Maeve: You, too. Holden -- be happy.",
        "Holden: You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hello, Ralph.",
        "Ralph: Hey, Henry. Oh, I see you received my little token of appreciation.",
        "Henry: Don't you mean your threat? And no disrespect, Sir.",
        "Ralph: Oh, now, that hurts. I mean, why on earth would I threaten you when you're holding up your end of the arrangement?",
        "Henry: Well, I am a little behind on a couple of the payments.",
        "Ralph: I'm sure it's not gonna happen again.",
        "Henry: I'm glad you're sure, because I'm not entirely sure.",
        "Ralph: Why is that?",
        "Henry: Um, I just -- I need, uh -- I need a little more time, uh, to get the rest of the money.",
        "Ralph: Oh.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Ralph: Time -- you know, she's a fickle thing, isn't she?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Ralph: I mean, sometimes, she can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It just depends where you stand in the circle of life.",
        "Henry: Hey, I am as big a fan of show tunes as the next guy.",
        "Ralph: Henry, zip it. When you give me money for my charity, I pass it on to my people who need it. They give it back to me, I give it back to you, and we filter it through your nightclub. That's how the system keeps working. That's how it flows, in and out. Hence --",
        "Henry: The circle of life, right. Yeah, I understand.",
        "Ralph: But you know, if the circle breaks down, bad things can happen. So, Henry, don't break the circle.",
        "Henry: No, no. Absolutely not. I completely understand. Um, you know, I'm -- I'm gonna do something uncharacteristic for me. I'm -- I'm gonna be honest for a minute.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Henry: I've, uh -- I've got this half brother. His name is Paul.",
        "Ralph: Oh, yeah. Your mother told me about him.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Well, his mother believes that he should get a portion of the estate. Now -- now, Paul is willing to give me the whole thing.",
        "Ralph: Well, Paul sounds like a very generous man.",
        "Henry: Yes. But his mother is not, and she has filed an injunction to freeze the estate until another arrangement can be made.",
        "Ralph: Well, that doesn't sound too good.",
        "Henry: No, but here's the thing. Here's the main point. She is perfectly willing to do a 50/50 split.",
        "Ralph: Just stop right there, Henry. 50% has nothing to do with our agreement.",
        "Henry: I -- I know. I realize that. And what I was hoping is that we could amend the agreement.",
        "Ralph: No.",
        "Henry: Don't you want to think about it?",
        "Ralph: No. Our arrangement was for 100% on every single dollar, and that's what we're gonna stick to.",
        "Henry: You scare me out here.",
        "Ralph: Henry, you're a very nice man. Why don't you go home to your girlfriend? She has a really pretty face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: No, I'll be there soon. Bye. That was the diner. Janet was supposed to work tonight, but she's still on location.",
        "Katie: Aw. That means Brad is, too. You have to cover her shift?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. And Henry had this special evening planned for us.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Vienna: Okay, well, do you want me to drop you off anywhere?",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. That's okay. Thank you.",
        "Vienna: Okay. And you don't worry. Just focus on yourself. And, uh, I'll tell you all about the charity another day.",
        "Katie: All right. Thank you. I'll see you soon.",
        "Vienna: Okay. Bye.",
        "Katie: Sorry, Vienna, but some things just can't wait.",

        "Henry: What?",
        "Audrey: Where are you?",
        "Henry: I just left Ralph.",
        "Audrey: Mm, mm. Good, good. How did it go?",
        "Henry: I told him the truth.",
        "Audrey: What?! Are you crazy?! You never tell a man like that the truth. You're an idiot.",
        "Henry: Look, I think he appreciated it, okay? At least he did until he threatened Vienna.",
        "Audrey: Are you serious?",
        "Henry: All right, I -- I don't like this, okay? I mean, coming after me or you -- that's one thing.",
        "Audrey: Hey!",
        "Henry: But Vienna -- Vienna's totally different, all right? She has nothing to do with this. And I'm not gonna allow her to get hurt just because of us!",
        "Audrey: Fine. Then you have to do what Ralph wants you to do and get him the money. Henry, at this point, you don't have any choice.",

        "Lisa: Look at you. Come here. Oh, you look like you bought out the store.",
        "Barbara: Guilty as charged.",

        "Lisa: Oh, Sweetie --",
        "Barbara: Yeah. And I don't know. He kind of revived something in myself that I -- I thought was maybe dead. And yet, here I am, feeling the way I'm -- I'm feeling.",

        "Lily: I don't know.",

        "Lily: I didn't mean to.",
        "Damian: It's not like you to lose control like that.",
        "Lily: I know, but she -- she kept attacking me. She was accusing me of all these horrible things.",
        "Damian: Like what?",
        "Lily: She said I never loved Holden.",
        "Damian: That's ridiculous.",
        "Lily: But look at what I've done. I married you only months after I thought I lost Holden. I gave up on him too soon. How could I do that?!",
        "Damian: Listen, Lily, you didn't do anything wrong. You just fell in love with a man who has been in love with you all along, who's always been in love with you and always will be.",

        "Henry: Oh, my God. Enough of this, Mother. Please.",
        "Audrey: Come here. Listen to me. Henry Alexander Coleman, you just listen. You have got to get Barbara to lift that injunction, 'cause you're not only gonna be up a creek, you are gonna be six feet under, and I'll be six feet under, and Vienna will be six feet under. Is that what you want?",
        "Henry: You know -- you know that's not what I want. Of course not.",
        "Audrey: Okay. I know that all you need to do is do whatever it takes to get Barbara to change her mind.",

        "Audrey: Oh. Oh, shoot! Well, you did. You just missed him. He's got, um, this very important meeting about his inheritance right now.",
        "Katie: I thought that was all settled. Isn't he giving it away to charity? That's what Vienna said.",
        "Audrey: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's exactly what he's doing. But, you know, when you're dealing with that huge amount of money, sometimes it's a little bit tricky. So I will be sure and tell him that you were looking for him, you came by.",

        "Audrey: Henry --",
        "Henry: What if Vienna finds out about this? Do you know what it will do to her if I go through with this?",
        "Audrey: Do you know what Ralph will do to her if you don't? You have got to get your hands on that money. And if that means putting your hands on Barbara Ryan, that's exactly what you have to do. Now, Henry, man up and make your mama proud.",
        "Henry: Hello, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: You sound just like your father when you say that.",
