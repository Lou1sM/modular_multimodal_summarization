        "Lily: I can tell I'm through the front door even with my eyes closed. Can I open them now?",
        "Holden: No, not yet.",
        "Luke: We kind of want to ease you into the homecoming experience.",
        "Lily: Oh, no. Does that mean there are newspapers and empty pizza boxes on the sink?",
        "Holden: Guess we're busted, huh Luke?",
        "Luke: Never could pull one over on you, Mom.",
        "Lily: Do I hear little munchkins?",
        "Lucinda: On the count of three. And a one and a two and a three --",
        "[Inaudible cheers]",
        "Lily: I need hugs. Come over here, please.",
        "Faith: Welcome home, Mommy.",
        "Lily: How are my beautiful girls?",
        "Faith: We're so happy you're home.",
        "Lily: There's no place I'd rather be, believe me.",
        "Emma: Someone else has been waiting very patiently to say hello. Hello, Darling.",
        "Lily: Look at you my little boy. He's really right on track, isn't he? Look at him, he's gotten so big.",
        "Holden: He's been great. He just needed his momma.",
        "Luke: That's what we all needed.",
        "Lily: All of you -- that's all I need to get better.",
        "Holden: And you're all we need.",
        "Faith: We have a surprise for you, Mommy.",
        "Emma: Okay now, Mommy's a little tired. She just got home. I know we're happy to see her, but we have to let her rest a little bit --",
        "Lily: Oh, I've had enough rest to last me a lifetime. What I need is family around me -- the more the merrier. Hey, guess what? Rose's daughter's gonna be joining us soon. [Lily sees the ghost of Rose] You know something about Theresa? Something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: All right, listen. You sign on to do this job, I will tack on a 50% bonus at the end. How's that sound? That sounds pretty good to me.",
        "Contractor: Yeah, 50% of nothing is nothing. I need cash up front.",
        "Simon: You'll get your money. My funds are just temporarily tied up right now.",
        "Contractor: You better untie them, okay? Because you can't fix this mess without very deep pockets.",
        "Carly: Simon?",
        "Simon: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. Wasn't that the new contractor? Isn't he supposed to start today?",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah, he's just running a bit behind schedule. You know, he's got to go get his crew and requisition supplies -- that sort of thing.",
        "Carly: Well, now that Lucinda's coming through with the money, we can actually pay them. Let's just hope that things get moving, because neither of us can really wait for this project much longer, right?",
        "Simon: Take a breath, everything's under control. We will be up and running again in no time flat.",
        "Carly: You know, I believe you. In spite of Katie's warnings and my own doubts, you haven't let me down yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: We should hustle, or we're gonna be late for your check-up.",
        "Jade: You know, you really don't have to go. You're gonna be one guy in a room full of pregnant women.",
        "Will: I can handle that.",
        "Jade: Well, you didn't want to go before until I mentioned it. I really have no problem going alone.",
        "Will: I know, but I feel like I owe it to you.",
        "Jade: For what?",
        "Will: Well, I did start wondering if the pregnancy was fake.",
        "Jade: You mean a trap.",
        "Will: Right, but it's not. And the test came back positive, so -- I want to show up for you both, all right? The car's running. Let's go.",
        "Paul: I need to talk to you.",
        "Will: Well, we're on our way out.",
        "Paul: This won't wait.",
        "Will: It's gonna have to.",
        "Jade: Will, no. It's fine. You can stay here and talk to your brother, and I can keep my appointment.",
        "Will: No, Jade, I'm going with you I said. I want to.",
        "Jade: No, no it's fine. Okay, I will call you if there are any problems, and there definitely will not be. Okay?",
        "Will: Jade, listen. Wait, Jade --",
        "Paul: Craig Montgomery is back in town.",
        "Will: Craig -- what the hell? He's supposed to be in jail.",
        "Paul: Well, he's not. He's free. He's walking around, and he's ready to pick up right where he left off.",
        "Will: Gwen. Oh man, with everything that's happened to her, Craig's the last person that she needs back in her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, my life is kind of just about my job and classes right now, so could you make sure that your grandma knows that I will take all the weekend hours that she can give me.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I don't see her right now, but I can check at the office.",
        "Gwen: Okay, take your time. I'm going to chow down on some Dante's Inferno.",
        "Casey: Oh, I hear it's a real page turner. What circle of hell are you up to now?",
        "Gwen: What day is it today?",
        "Casey: I'll be right back.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Through me the way into the suffering city. Through me the way to eternal pain.",
        "Craig: Hello, Gwen. I knew eventually our paths would cross.",
        "Gwen: Why aren't you in jail? Nevermind.",
        "Craig: Dante's Inferno. Yellow highlighter. Notes in the margin. You made it to college, didn't you? Congratulations.",
        "Gwen: Give it back. Forget it, I'll get another copy.",
        "Craig: Gwen, please, wait. Just give me a minute. I know I left some hard feelings behind, but who hasn't made some mistakes?",
        "Gwen: You call what you did to me a mistake?",
        "Craig: We all start off with good intentions, it's just that sometimes they spin out of control, and I'm sorry that Roseanna's tragic accident prevented us from honoring our commitment to adopt your baby.",
        "Gwen: That's your take on what you did to Rosanna? And me? And to Jennifer? You switched our babies, so you could adopt your own son.",
        "Craig: It's not as cut and dry as you think it is. I mean, at least that's what an appellate court decided.",
        "Gwen: Then you must've paid off the judge. Thanks to you, I suffered the loss of two children. First, the son that I gave birth to who died and the one that I had to give back to his mother.",
        "Craig: I know you've had some rough times, and I'm sorry. Please, please accept my condolences for the loss of your son.",
        "Gwen: I don't want anything from you.",
        "Craig: But I heard your life is looking up now -- you married Will Munson? That's great. You and Will can have lots of beautiful children together.",
        "[Gwen smack Craig]",
        "Gwen: Please tell your grandmother we'll have to do this another time.",
        "Casey: Gwen, wait! What is wrong with you? That girl's going through hell, and you just made it worse.",
        "Craig: What? What did I say? I was just trying to wish her well. Fresh starts come at a damn high premium in this town.",
        "Casey: Could you fresh start somewhere else?",
        "Craig: Please, lace into me when I have more time, okay Casey? I'm expecting someone.",
        "Casey: All right, I'll stay out of your way. Just be sure you stay out of Gwen's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: All right, look. I just wanted to give you and Gwen a heads-up about Craig. I'm sorry if I was out of line.",
        "Will: Paul, wait. Gwen left me again.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. Wouldn't have anything to do with the lovely Jade, would it?",
        "Will: Everything. She's pregnant. And it's mine.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Will: Yeah, I messed up. And I'd like to be there for Gwen, you know, to keep her from freaking out about Craig, but I know she won't let me.",
        "Paul: Well, Will, Jade is pregnant.",
        "Will: Gwen and I almost got back together during the ice storm, but then Jade showed up, and everything fell apart.",
        "Paul: Are you sure, I mean, are you sure that she's really pregnant?",
        "Will: Yeah, I mean she took a pregnancy test. So now, a woman that I don't love is having my kid, and I'm scared as hell that I've blown it with Gwen. So, tell me -- I mean, you kind of have the same thing going on with Emily and Meg, right? Tell me there's a way out of this where everyone gets what they want.",
        "Paul: I would love to tell you that, Will. But I'd be lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What, is it about Theresa? Is there a problem finding her?",
        "Holden: No, not a problem. Lucinda had her lawyers look into it.",
        "Lily: And?",
        "Lucinda: Well Darling, we've got to get a court order, you know, to even contact Theresa.",
        "Lily: Well, good. Let's go. Get the ball rolling.",
        "Holden: We have, but it's kind of an involved process. It may take up to six months.",
        "Lily: Six months? That's too long.",
        "Lucinda: Dear, it is not an eternity.",
        "Lily: No, that's not right. What am I supposed to tell Rose when I see her?",
        "Lucinda: Rose, darling?",
        "Lily: Rose is dead, I know, i know she's dead. But, she came to me. I saw her in the hospital.",
        "Lucinda: Quite possibly dear, you were dreaming.",
        "Lily: No, it wasn't a dream. It was real. Rose came to me and told me to find her daughter, find Theresa. Why would she do that unless it was urgent? What if she's in trouble, what if she's in danger?",
        "Lucinda: Holden, maybe we should get Bob on the line.",
        "Holden: What for?",
        "Lucinda: Well, if Lily is seeing and hearing things --",
        "Lily: Please don't talk about me like I'm not here.",
        "Holden: The neurologist said that it's not uncommon for somebody who has just come out of a coma to experience what Lily is going through.",
        "Lily: I'm not going through anything.",
        "Luke: I read about this online -- how mom's brain activity is firing back up, but sometimes it's like, there's signals that get crossed.",
        "Holden: So, it's just a normal part of the recovery process.",
        "Lucinda: Fine, I'll take the internet's word for it.",
        "Lily: Can you just call your attorneys and tell them that the search for theresa is urgent -- please.",
        "Holden: You know what, you need to just, kind of focus on your family right now -- you've got a lot of people here who love you, so let's just do that.",
        "Lily: Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. So, what's my surprise?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No one's worked harder than you.",
        "Simon: Except you.",
        "Carly: Because you inspire me.",
        "Simon: Me?",
        "Carly: Yeah, and so many people warned me about you and I'm so glad that I ignored them.",
        "Simon: Enough- last chance. There's the door.",
        "Carly: Not going. I'm not going anywhere. You've given me faith in this project, you've given me faith that we can succeed. Getting Lucinda to invest was brilliant. Simon, you made me feel that life can work out.",
        "Simon: Unless there's another disaster --",
        "Carly: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Simon: What makes you so sure about that?",
        "Carly: You know, I just have a feeling. When you came along, I wasn't exactly the queen of self-esteem, was I? Jack was gone, I had bills to pay, my life was nowhere, when I finally discovered a way to reinvent myself, the bank shot me down. But you -- gave me a job, you had faith in me. No one's ever done that for me before.",
        "Simon: All right, with or without me, you would have landed on your feet, okay?",
        "Carly: I'd like that to be true. But this project certainly gave me a head start. And I owe you for that. Actually, you owe me. Now that Lucinda's given some money, do you think I could get paid?",
        "Simon: Oh, paid.",
        "Carly: It's been a while.",
        "Simon: I know, of course. Not a problem. The only thing is, I think I've left my checkbook back at the hotel. How much would it take to tide you over?",
        "Carly: A couple hundred.",
        "Simon: Here we go. Here --",
        "Carly: Am I cleaning you out?",
        "Simon: You kidding? Plenty more where that came from. And listen, trust me -- I am gonna pay you back plus interest, okay?",
        "Carly: I do trust you, and now that I have some money, I am going to go and get some flowers for Lily.",
        "Simon: How is she doing?",
        "Carly: Pretty well. She went home from the hospital today -- it's amazing.",
        "Simon: That's great news. Please, can you please wish her my very best?",
        "Carly: Of course. All right, well I'm off then.",
        "Simon: Okay.",
        "Carly: Simon --",
        "Simon: Yeah?",
        "Carly: Thank you for being a better man than I ever thought possible.",
        "Simon: That's quite the hole you've dug yourself in, Frasier. All right, it is time to dig yourself back out.",
        "[Simon picks up his address book and starts calling people]",
        "Simon: Okay, we are talking prime, absolute primo real estate, okay? Once construction's finished. I can promise you a hefty, a hefty return on your investment, my friend, absolutely. I just need the money today. Thirty days and you can name your interest rate. Lucinda Walsh? The timing just wasn't right. Insurance risk? Oh come on, where did you hear that? Thank you, Lucinda, for one last kick in the teeth. You didn't waste time spreading the word, did you? Oh, no. Desperate times. Yeah, hey, it's Simon Frasier. Remember me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you mate? Hey, listen -- I've found myself in a bit of a pickle, and you seem to be my last resort.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Carly.",
        "Carly: Good morning. These are for Lily.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, how lovely.",
        "Carly: So, how is she?",
        "Lucinda: She's good. A few bumps on the road, but she's home. Come on in. Please, come in. Give them to her yourself.",
        "Carly: Oh, that'd be great, but first Lucinda, I want to tell you that I heard about your meeting with Simon.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, he told you?",
        "Carly: Yes. Well, we are partners, you know? And Simon believes in full disclosure.",
        "Lucinda: Of course he does.",
        "Carly: I don't know if you realize how difficult it was for him to approach you.",
        "Lucinda: I think I know where this is going, so let's just get there. Simon asked me for money, and I did what I thought was financially prudent.",
        "Carly: Yes, yes. And that's what makes you such an amazing businesswoman.",
        "Lucinda: What on earth has possessed you -- besides Simon Frasier --?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well, the thing about Meg and Emily is, I never really did figure out how to deal with it. It kind of got figured out for me.",
        "Will: How?",
        "Paul: Emily lost the baby.",
        "Will: Oh my God, I --I didn't -- I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: It was horrible.",
        "Will: Yeah, I can't even imagine --",
        "Paul: So, all those things that, you know, I spent months worrying about -- if my daughter were here -- I guess what I'm saying is I would have found a way to make it work. Custody, visitation.",
        "Will: You think I can make it work without losing Gwen?",
        "Paul: I don't know. But, Will, you have to do whatever you have to do to get her back.",
        "Will: I don't know if I know how to do that if Jade and the baby are in the picture.",
        "Jade: Will, I have something amazing to show you. It's our baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Emily -- please excuse me if I don't get up. I fell prey to the ice storm.",
        "Emily: Save it. You're not the only one.",
        "Craig: I heard about your baby when I was in the hospital. I'm very sorry.",
        "Emily: Craig, really. I'm not gonna share my grief. Especially since all the bad things that have happened in my life over the past twelve months can be traced directly to you.",
        "Craig: Yet you agreed to meet with me.",
        "Emily: You said you wanted to talk about the paper.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. I want to know what prompted Paul Ryan to try to buy the intruder.",
        "Emily: Paul thought that if he gave me something that I wanted, he could soften me up, make it easier for him and Meg to take away my baby after she was born, but that is all over now.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry for the way it happened, but you've got to know that its better that Paul is not in your life.",
        "Emily: No, its better that you're not in my life, too. Now back to the paper. You've shown absolutely no interest in it, Craig, so turn it over to me. Let me find a way to buy it from you, and you get to walk away a free man. Like you always do.",
        "Craig: I have no intention of walking away -- from the paper or you. I want you both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Spirro: I'll call you when I have the cash.",
        "Will: Your doctor's at the free clinic? Then why is the sonogram from Memorial Hospital?",
        "Craig: What if I made you my partner? That means, not only will you work for the paper, you'll own it. With me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Nothing personal. Although you're as lovely as ever.",
        "Emily: Oh come on, Craig. What do you want?",
        "Craig: We've always worked so well together. I just thought we'd pick up where we left off.",
        "Emily: That's impossible.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Emily: Why? Because there's too much history between us -- most of it rotten.",
        "Craig: But we have such a fantastic record running the paper.",
        "Emily: Too much has happened. Horrible things.",
        "Craig: I certainly can understand the impulse to want to shoot Paul Ryan or chain up Dusty Donovan.",
        "Emily: Your sensitivity is overwhelming.",
        "Craig: You noticed that my paper kept you out of the headlines.",
        "Emily: So that was your personal touch?",
        "Craig: I had my contacts, even in prison.",
        "Emily: You know what, this is all old news. I want to put it all behind me, I want to reestablish myself as a professional. Get back in the game.",
        "Craig: That's what I want. So, why not jump back in together?",
        "Emily: Are you crazy?",
        "Craig: You haven't even heard my offer yet.",
        "Emily: I don't have to hear your offer. Whatever it is, it's a surefire way to ruin my life all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, just seeing that creep got my day off to a bad start.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry I didn't tell you Craig was back.",
        "Gwen: Doesn't matter. I mean, this is a small town. I would have run into him one way or another.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you could have been prepared.",
        "Gwen: Not in this lifetime.",
        "Casey: Yeah, the guy's pretty much a walking nightmare. I mean, how much do I hate it that he's my uncle?",
        "Gwen: It's not your fault. And how funny was it that he made a direct hit without even knowing it. You know, that stuff he said about Will and I having kids one day --",
        "Casey: Yeah. That was rough.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he said it without even having a clue that it could never happen. And now some woman is giving my husband the one thing that I can't.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know -- about that? Are you sure, like a hundred percent sure?",
        "Gwen: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: Well, I was talking to Maddie last night, and she said that you guys think that Jade's faking it.",
        "Gwen: It's done. It's over. She came back to our home -- I mean, to Will's house. And she had one of those home pregnancy kits and basically offered us a free show, so I just left.",
        "Casey: So you still don't know for sure?",
        "Gwen: It's Will's business. It's not mine. It makes me feel like I'm on the outside. And I don't really want to be there.",
        "Casey: So what's the plan?",
        "Gwen: Focus. You know, on school. On my double major. You know, this has been my dream, and I'm not gonna change that for anybody. It's just all this baby talk's kinda got me down.",
        "Casey: Then the discussion is closed. And I've got just the thing to pick you up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to barge in, but come to think of it -- you are the baby's uncle, so -- maybe you'd like to see this, too?",
        "Will: No, I don't think --",
        "Paul: No, it's fine. The moment when it all seems suddenly real. Good luck to both of you. You need to call me.",
        "Jade: It's so amazing. That's our baby.",
        "Will: So, is everything okay?",
        "Jade: The doctor said everything's fine. There was no harm from the accident. I was so relieved, I almost burst into tears.",
        "Will: Could they tell if it was a boy or a girl?",
        "Jade: The angle was off, so we're just gonna have to wait and be surprised. But I think that's more fun. You know, I know even though this pregnancy wasn't planned, it makes you think that nothing happens by accident. I mean, there's a person there. We made a life.",
        "Will: Paul's right. Looking at this -- it makes it seem a lot more real.",
        "Jade: Yeah, it's felt real for me for a long time. I'm going to go out later and buy a baby book, and I'm gonna paste the sonogram in it. Can't get enough, huh?",
        "Will: Jade, I want to ask you something. If your doctor's at the free clinic, then why is this sonogram from Memorial Hospital?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Simon hasn't possessed me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, sorry.",
        "Carly: But our project has.",
        "Lucinda: And so you have no problem about my decision about the funding of the reconstruction?",
        "Carly: Are you kidding? I think it's the smartest decision you've ever made.",
        "Lily: Carly, is that you? Come in, come in. Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi. Welcome home. I've missed you.",
        "Lily: I've missed you, too. Same here. Thank you. Oh, those are beautiful. Those flowers -- they're gorgeous. Thank you so much.",
        "Carly: No, thank you. Thank you for coming back to us.",
        "Lily: So, where's Jack? Is he working?",
