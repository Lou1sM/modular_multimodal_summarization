Lily confronts Holden about the way he is acting towards her. Carly asks for sign, as her telephone rings.

        "Bob: Let's give them a chance to get Luke settled in, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay. Will he be all right?",
        "Bob: Well, there's a lot of swelling that's putting pressure on the spine. But the important thing is that he is stable, and he came through the surgery with no complications.",
        "Lily: Can we sit with him?",
        "Bob: You know, I'd rather keep him quiet for a while, let him awaken on his own. Then we'll know a lot more.",
        "Lily: Okay, thank you. Holden.",
        "Holden: I'm gonna go call Aaron and Faith, let them know that Luke's out of surgery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: [Carly calls her kids to say good night] Sleep tight, and don't forget to say your prayers. Bye. [Carly hangs up the phone. She kneels to pray] Hi. You probably don't remember me. I don't check in very often, but I wanted to thank you for a really great day. It wasn't all great. Most of it, I felt weaker than I ever have. And a couple of times, the pain in my head was so bad, I just wanted to say, \"Take me now.\" There were some beautiful things, too. I got to play referee at dinner with my boys. And my little girl blew me a kiss over the phone. And Jack -- a couple moments with him -- one last kiss. Thank you for that. Oh. You know what? What am I doing here? The hell with that! Excuse the expression, but I mean it. It took me a lot of effort to get on these knees, so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna ask you for what I really want. Time. The long, healthy lifetime that I once thought I had with my children -- and with Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What about me, Jack?",
        "Jack: Nothing's changed. We're married. I love you.",
        "Katie: Did you think about that when you were kissing Carly? Did you think about me at all?",
        "Jack: I didn't tell you this to hurt you, Katie.",
        "Katie: Then just say you didn't mean it. Say -- take it back. Say that you don't have feelings for her anymore.",
        "Jack: I'm always going to have feelings for Carly.",
        "Katie: Because you have kids together.",
        "Jack: Exactly, yes.",
        "Katie: But this kiss had nothing to do with the kids, right, unless they were there to see it.",
        "Jack: You know they weren't.",
        "Katie: So tell me why you did it. Make me understand.",
        "Jack: She's dying, Katie.",
        "Katie: I know! And I wish to God that she wasn't. I pray every day that he will create a miracle and save her because I can't stand seeing you in this pain. I can't stand seeing the kids in this pain. And I hate feeling guilty and selfish because I want to spend time with you. I hate it almost as much knowing that a part of you will always love her.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. I am going to spend the rest of my life with you. One kiss isn't gonna change that. It's not gonna change us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: In the pamphlet, they call this stage bargaining. Unfortunately, I don't have many bargaining chips. I'd say save me because I'm a good person, but I think you and I both know that I'm not always very good. I could promise to change, and I probably would for a while. But more likely than not, it wouldn't take, you know what I mean? So maybe you could save me for my kids? They're good. And they need me. And Jack. You made us for each other. For no one else but each other. He would spend the rest of his life missing me. You know he would. So if you can't save me for me, save me for Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I make you happy?",
        "Jack: Yes. Don't you know that?",
        "Katie: Well, that's something.",
        "Jack: No, that's everything.",
        "Katie: But still, if Carly calls, you're gonna go to her.",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Katie: And whatever Carly wants, you're gonna give her.",
        "Jack: If I can.",
        "Katie: And when she's gone, you're gonna be the guy who lost the love of his life, and I'm gonna be the girl who's trying to make you forget how miserable you are.",

        "Noah: My father's a decorated soldier, an honorable man. He wouldn't do this if his mind was right. He just wouldn't.",
        "Margo: Do you recognize this woman?",
        "Noah: Why are you asking me about her?",
        "Margo: Do you know who she is?",
        "Noah: She's the woman who was killed, right? She ran the prostitution ring.",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Noah: Why are you asking me about her?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Margo: What is it?",
        "Cop: You got a call, Lieutenant.",
        "Margo: All right, I'm sorry. I gotta take this.",
        "Noah: Wait! Can I leave?",
        "Margo: Soon, soon.",

        "Lily: I'm gonna go out for a few minutes. Do you have my cell phone number?",
        "Nurse: We'll call if there's any change.",
        "Lily: Thanks. It's all gonna be okay, Baby. I promise.",
        "[Lily leaves and Colonel Mayer walks in and takes out a bottle of medicine he's about to put it in Luke's IV and the nurse walks in]",
        "Nurse: Sir, are you family?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Practically.",
        "Nurse: No one but family is allowed.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, I'll wait for Lily and Holden to get back, then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Did Luke wake up?",
        "Lily: Let me introduce myself. My name is Lily Snyder. I live at one mile high road, Luther's Corners, Illinois --",
        "Holden: Lily, what are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm just trying to remind you of who I am. My phone number is 555-51 --",
        "Holden: I remember our phone number.",
        "Lily: Oh, I thought maybe you'd forgotten. Along with the vow that you made to love, honor and cherish me.",
        "Holden: Likewise.",
        "Lily: I know one thing you've forgotten. I am Luke's mother. I carried him inside of me. Felt his first kick, saw his heart beat before he was even here.",
        "Holden: Lily, Lily, stop.",
        "Lily: You know that I would never, never intentionally hurt him.",
        "Holden: You should've told me.",
        "Lily: Please, please just tell me that you know that I would never, ever intentionally hurt our son.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Lily: My baby. My poor baby.",
        "[Lily cries and Holden almost touches her hand but changes his mind]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I've got the bible in my hand. I'm going to open it up, I'm going to read a verse, and I want you to show me a sign, okay? So if I'm going to live, I'll open to a happy verse about living. And if I'm -- you get the idea. Okay. \"Upon my bed at night I sought him whom my soul loves.\" You're talking about Jack. \"I sought him, but found him not.\" Oh, no, no, no, no. No, that's not -- that's not the sign, because Jack and I belong together. You know it. He knows it. I know it, so enough with this vague stuff. I need for you to show me a sign, an actual, physical sign. Please.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, what do I have to do to prove that I love you?",
        "Katie: I never doubted that you loved me. I mean, maybe a little bit when we first found out that Carly that sick.",
        "Jack: Okay, Katie --",
        "Katie: But we got past that.",
        "Jack: Katie --",
        "Katie: And our new house? That was worth waiting for.",
        "Jack: I wish I knew what to say to you. I really do.",
        "Katie: You always do. You always know what to say. You always say the right thing. You're kind and considerate, and you always put me first. But what you're telling me now is I'm not first!",
        "Jack: This isn't a contest. Katie, you're my wife.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and what does that get me? Your attention? No, Carly gets that. Your loyalty? No, Carly needs a kiss, by God, she's gonna get a kiss.",
        "Jack: That is never gonna happen again.",
        "Katie: I wish that made me feel better.",
        "Jack: Okay. I promise that I will do everything I can to make this easier for you, okay? I can't change how I feel for Carly.",
        "Katie: I guess it would just be easier if maybe I had a little more time with you. Maybe I could handle it a little bit better. We could get Carly a live-in nurse so that we could make sure that she's taken care of so you don't have to feel guilty if you're not there every second of the day. We could get her a cook or a driver, whatever she needs.",
        "Jack: She needs me! Katie, she needs me. She is gonna be gone soon. Gone forever. I can't pull away from her now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Yes, I will hold for Dr. Evers. This is what I get for being pushy, huh? Just please, no more bad news.",
        "Dr. Evers: Carly? Charles Evers here.",
        "Carly: Hi. Isn't it a little bit late for you to be calling?",
        "Dr. Evers: It is, but something's come up. Listen, would it be possible for you to come to my office?",
        "Carly: Tomorrow?",
        "Dr. Evers: I was hoping to see you tonight. It's important.",
        "Carly: What's wrong?",
        "Dr. Evers: When can you get here?",
        "Carly: Well, you know, I don't think that I can make it tonight. To tell you the truth, I'm not feeling very well. Whatever it is, could you just tell me?",
        "Dr. Evers: Look, I'd rather not get into this on the phone. But if you can't come to me -- listen, I know this is unusual, but I'd like to stop by. Some things are better handled in person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Also in the top ten reasons why I married you? Number two, you love me.",
        "Jack: And reason number one?",
        "Katie: You're a good person. You have a beautiful heart. And if you turned your back on Carly right now, it just would be so out of character for you that I would have to divorce you immediately.",
        "Jack: So what are you saying?",
        "Katie: You need to be with Carly right now. I understand.",
        "Jack: I really appreciate that. It's beyond generous of you.",
        "Katie: No, it's not.",
        "Jack: It is.",
        "Katie: I just don't want you to have any regrets. I want to have a life with you, and I'm not gonna have that if I make you choose between Carly and me right now.",
        "Jack: No, we're gonna have -- you're gonna have that life. Count on it.",
        "Katie: I need something first.",
        "Jack: What is it?",
        "Katie: I know you have to do what you have to do. I understand that. But I can't sit around and watch you do it. I can't pretend to like seeing you leave me every night. I can't do it, Jack, and I won't.",
        "Jack: Okay, and since you can't?",
        "Katie: I want you to move out.",

        "Lily: We should go. Luke will be waking up soon.",
        "Holden: You know what? I need to pay my check.",
        "Lily: I'll wait for you.",
        "Holden: I'll meet you back at the hospital. Go ahead.",
        "Lily: Fine.",
        "Holden: Lily. With Luke, we need to be a united front, for his sake.",

        "Margo: I'm sorry for the interruption. Just have a seat, Noah.",
        "Noah: I already made my statement. Why can't I leave?",
        "Margo: Because I have more questions.",
        "Noah: About this woman? Cheri Love? I told you, I don't know anything about her other than what I read in the papers. Can I go?",
        "Margo: Noah, the name of the woman in this picture is Charlene Wilson.",
        "Noah: That's my mother's name.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Noah: That's impossible.",
        "Margo: There's no mistake.",
        "Noah: Then it's a coincidence! Okay, the name's a coincidence. I told you before, my mom died a long time ago.",
        "Margo: That's what your father led you to believe. But no, he was lying to you.",
        "Noah: So what you're saying, this woman's my mother? That she's dead?",
        "Margo: I'm sorry.",
        "Noah: Dusty Donovan?",
        "Margo: No, Donovan was set up to take the fall, but he didn't kill her.",

        "Margo: Yes, we do. He confessed to killing Charlene.",
        "Noah: He confessed to you?",
        "Margo: No, to Donovan, and then he shot him.",
        "Noah: There's no way he did that! No way! Why are you saying these things about my father?",
        "Margo: Because, Noah, it's all true, and I need you to help me to find him to stop him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Get away from him! I won't let you hurt him again!",

        "Carly: Well, then calm me down. Tell me what's going on.",
        "Dr. Evers: I reviewed your records, and something caught my eye.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Dr. Evers: Look, I went over all your old test results, and I re-evaluated your case. At this point, I don't think you have a lesion after all.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Dr. Evers: I think you have an abscess.",
        "Carly: What is that? What does that mean, then?",
        "Dr. Evers: Well, what it means right now, Carly, is that you're not dying.",

        "Katie: Just understand. Please try to understand that I would do anything for you and your kids. That's why I know that you need to be together right now, but I can't keep putting myself through this. I have a vivid imagination, and every time you leave to be with Carly -- if you're not living with me, I don't know how long you're spending with her, and that will be easier for me.",
        "Jack: How?",
        "Katie: I don't want to hurt you. But I can't stand here, counting the minutes, night after night, wondering if you're gonna call and tell me that you can't be home tonight. I need to back away and leave you alone to deal with this with Carly, okay?",
        "Jack: No, no, please. Please don't do this. Please, please don't do this. Don't do this.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Evers: I found the anomaly when I compared the CT scans. If you had a tumor, it would have grown significantly by now, given that you haven't started the chemotherapy.",
        "Carly: Why am I so sick? I mean, I've been blacking out. And then when I come to, I can't even stand.",
        "Dr. Evers: I suspect those are side effects from the medication prescribed to combat the tumor.",
        "Carly: The tumor I don't have. So the headaches and the dizziness is caused by an abscess, right, and not a tumor?",
        "Dr. Evers: Carly, I don't blame you for being confused and upset. But I would like you to come to the hospital tomorrow. We can run a few more tests just to make sure. But informally, I am certain you were misdiagnosed.",
        "Carly: What -- what do I do now, then? What is the treatment?",
        "Dr. Evers: Its antibiotics. In a couple of weeks, you're gonna be just fine. Good night, Carly.",

        "Dusty: Is this how you clean the world, Colonel? Huh? By letting your son grow up without a mother, then taking her life?",
        "Colonel Mayer: I did what I had to do, and I'm not done yet. You won't stop me!",
        "Dusty: You should have brought your gun.",
        "Cop: Don't move!",
        "Lily: That's the man. Him. He's the one who tried to kill my son and he attacked me. That's him.",

        "Lily: He was going to put it in Luke's I.V.",
        "Dusty: What is it?",
        "Bob: It's a very powerful sedative. It could have suppressed his breathing. Dusty, get this to the police. I want to examine Luke.",

        "Dusty: I'm going to leave you to your family. I'll see you later.",
        "Holden: I'm glad you're both safe.",
        "Bob: He's a little disoriented, but he is awake, and he's asked to see both of you.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Hey.",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Holden: How do you feel?",
        "Luke: Out of it. Was Colonel Mayer here, or was I dreaming?",
        "Holden: He was here. But he's gone now.",
        "Luke: Why am I in a hospital?",
        "Lily: What do you remember?",
        "Luke: I went on a fishing trip. It was me and Colonel Mayer and Noah. Is Noah okay? Is he hurt?",
        "Lily: No, Noah's fine.",
        "Holden: No one was hurt but you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Malone, you start the paperwork. We'll be booking Colonel Mayer on several counts, but let's start with murder in the first degree of his ex- wife, Charlene Wilson.",
        "Cop: You got it, Lieutenant.",
        "Noah: Is it true? Was she my mother?",
        "Colonel Mayer: She didn't deserve you!",
        "Noah: You told me she was dead.",
        "Colonel Mayer: It was the kindest thing I ever did!",
        "Noah: You lied to me. How could you do that? You lied to me my whole life.",
        "Colonel Mayer: We'll discuss this later, Noah.",
        "Noah: And then you came here, and -- and you killed her?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Trust me, Son. Trust me, it was better that way. It was better that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I don't understand. Colonel Mayer knew who Noah was and accepted it. He knew how -- how we felt about each other, and he said, \"That's okay.\" Why would he say that? Why would -- why would he want me to go on that trip?",
        "Holden: So he could get you alone someplace so that there wouldn't be any witnesses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colonel Mayer: She was my wife, and she cheated on me. She had no love for me or for you. How could she do that? How could she love us and do something like that?",
        "Margo: So you kicked her out?",
        "Colonel Mayer: My son needed stability. So I made sure. I made sure Charlene disappeared. I warned her never to come back.",
        "Dusty: Or you'd kill her?",
        "Noah: Why?",
        "Colonel Mayer: I found out that she was living in this town, and she was working as a whore, and I couldn't let -- I couldn't take the chance that you would find that out, too. I couldn't take that chance, Noah. So I had to. I couldn't --",
        "Noah: So you killed her. And then you went after Luke. Why? What did he ever do than except care for me?",
        "Colonel Mayer: The way that boy cares for you is wrong! It's immoral!",
        "Noah: I don't think people who commit murder get to decide what's immoral!",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, I would sacrifice myself -- anything to make sure that you grew up into a strong, decent man.",
        "Noah: Strong and decent?",
        "Colonel Mayer: Yeah.",
        "Noah: Like you?",
        "Colonel Mayer: No. No, no. No.",
        "Margo: Book him.",
        "Dusty: You lost your son. There's no worse punishment than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So his mom was here all along? Poor Noah, I have to -- I have to go find him. How long have I got to be here for?",
        "Holden: Luke, you need to rest. You just came out of surgery. The anesthesia probably hasn't even worn off yet.",
        "Luke: Yeah. That's probably why I feel kind of numb. I can't even, like, really feel my legs.",
        "Lily: I'm going to get Bob. I'll be right back. Excuse me, can you get Dr. Hughes? Quickly, please. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey. Hey, I was just about to teach Vienna some of the finer points of poker. If you'd like to join us, I promise we'll keep our clothes on.",
        "Katie: No, thanks. I have plans.",
        "Henry: Ooh, hot date with the new hubby, huh? You and Jack have fun.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Henry: Tears? Oh, Lord, what's going on here? You want a martini?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Henry: You want a tissue? Do you want Jack?",
        "Katie: Yeah, but I can't have him.",
        "Henry: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because I sent him away. I told him that I can't just hang around and watch him fall in love with Carly again while he helps her exit this world.",
        "Henry: Newsflash, Sweetheart. Jack loves you, Katie, Katie, married lady.",
        "Katie: That's what he said, but I feel like I'm on perpetual hold. Do you know how awful it is to be waiting for someone to die to start your life? I'm basically waiting for Carly to die so I can have my husband back. How sick is that?",
        "Henry: Isn't Jack worth waiting for?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he would be if he wasn't in love with another woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I never meant for my illness to come between you and Katie.",
        "Jack: That's not what caused the problems.",
        "Carly: Then what did?",
        "Jack: What I discovered since you got sick. Or rediscovered. I couldn't lie to Katie about that. And it wasn't about the kiss, Carly. It was about what the kiss meant.",
        "Carly: What exactly did you tell her?",
        "Jack: How important you are to me and always will be.",
        "Carly: I want you to be happy, Jack. I mean that. I want you to be really happy.",
        "Jack: And I don't want you to die. But can we not talk about this anymore tonight, please?",
        "Carly: Sure. What do you want to talk about?",
        "Jack: You were saying something before about divine intervention. And you seemed so happy about it when I came in. Tell me about that.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I will. Later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: If you want to yell at me for what my father did to you, go ahead.",
        "Dusty: I'm not blaming you.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm still sorry. I didn't know. If I could have stopped him, I would have.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. I survived. The D.A.'s dropping the charges against me. It's all good for me.",
        "Noah: I'm glad.",
        "Dusty: And Noah? You're not responsible for anything your dad did. Not even close. You got someplace to go? Somebody you can talk to?",
        "Noah: I don't have anyone. Not anymore. And I don't want to talk to anyone.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe there's someone who needs to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Luke, will you try to move your toes for me? Try again.",
        "Luke: I am trying. Aren't they moving? What's wrong with them? Why can't I move my legs? What's wrong with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know, there's no need to pine away in your lonely room when there's a perfectly good poker game just down the hall.",
        "Katie: I don't think I'd be much fun tonight.",
        "Henry: No worries. Vienna and I will fill any fun deficit. We'll even let you win the first few hands if you want.",
        "Katie: What I want is for things to be the way they were before Carly got sick.",
        "Henry: He's going to be all yours very soon. Just give it some time, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah. You gotta be tired.",
        "Carly: I'm not sleepy yet. Don't go.",
        "Jack: Not sleepy? Oh, I can help you. Here, yeah. Sit up just a little bit. There you go. How's that?",
        "Carly: It's been a long time since you've done that. That's nice.",
        "Jack: I want to help you through this in any way I can, Carly. All you have to do is ask.",
        "Carly: Don't go.",
        "Jack: I can stick around. There's no place else I have to be tonight.",

        "Sofie: You don't have to take care of me.",
        "Alison: Yeah, she has Aaron for that.",
        "Barbara: It's very clear that Alison is not who you want to be your donor.",
        "Aaron: Trying to make a run for it, huh?",
        "Bob: It's possible he might never walk again.",
        "Luke: Have you heard from Noah?",
        "Lily: You think Luke can't walk because of me?"
