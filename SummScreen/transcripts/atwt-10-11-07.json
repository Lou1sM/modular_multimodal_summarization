        "Luke is devastated when he learns that he might be permanently paralyzed. Noah doesn't want to go see him because he blames himself for Luke's accident. Noah drowns his sorrows in alcohol and kisses Maddie. Alison is positive she is a terrible person and breaks up with Aaron because she thinks he belongs with someone like Sofie. Luke's crisis tears Holden and Lily apart instead of bringing them together when Holden tells Lily he doesn't trust her anymore. Dusty tells Holden he shouldn't take his anger out on Lily but instead take it out on him. Holden takes Dusty's advice and punches Dusty in the face."

        "Gwen: Hey, Kate.",
        "Desk clerk: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Is Lisa in yet?",
        "Desk clerk: She is. She's on another call. I'll let you know when she's free.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I'm just gonna wait right over here.",
        "Alison: Hey, there you are! I've been looking all over for you!",
        "Gwen: Is everything okay?",
        "Alison: Okay? It's better than okay. To quote the doctor, your eggs are mature and ready for harvesting.",
        "Gwen: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I was so excited, I had to come find you.",
        "Gwen: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Alison: You know what we have to do now?",
        "Gwen: Get some non-alcoholic champagne?",
        "Alison: No. Tell Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, what's up? What's going on, Man, I heard about Luke. Is everything okay?",
        "Aaron: I just left the hospital. They're still waiting for some test results.",
        "Will: Test results?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. Last night, Luke couldn't move his legs. So they're trying to find out if it's permanent.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, it's been a really terrific day. Listen, I'm looking for Alison. Is she inside?",
        "Will: No. Is something wrong?",
        "Aaron: What could be wrong between Alison and me? It's all screwed up. You know, like always.",
        "Will: Is this because she's helping us out?",
        "Aaron: No. It's because I actually screwed it all up. Again. Like always.",
        "Will: What did you say?",
        "Aaron: It's what I didn't say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I'd love to go tell Will, but I can't for a while. I set up a meeting with Lisa.",
        "Alison: Why do you have to have a meeting with Lisa? \"Lisa, hi. I'm going to have a baby. Bye.\"",
        "Gwen: No, it's not for me. It's for Sofie.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Gwen: I just wanted to see if Lisa would give her her old job back.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and of course, she couldn't come and ask for it by herself. You should probably get Aaron in on it, he loves helping Sofie.",
        "Gwen: Ooh, come on, Alison.",
        "Alison: I want to go tell Will that everything's ready for the two of you to have a baby. But you can't because you have to hold that girl's hand one more time --",
        "Sofie: You really don't have to worry about me. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Did he wake up?",
        "Lily: No. He's sleeping, and he looks -- perfect.",
        "Holden: I just got a call from Bob. He's on his way down with the test results.",
        "Lily: How did he sound?",
        "Holden: Not real happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Noah --",
        "Noah: I was looking right at her.",
        "Dusty: What's that?",
        "Noah: I was standing right over there, looking at my own mom. You were fighting with her, so my dad took us out of here. I made jokes about it. About her.",
        "Dusty: Noah, you wanted to talk to me?",
        "Noah: I didn't think you'd come after what my dad did to t-you.",
        "Dusty: That's him, that's not you. None of this is your fault.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Why don't you ask Luke how he feels about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Bob's just being cautious. Just because he won't tell us the test results over the telephone doesn't mean its bad news. I thought we were going to get through this together. For Luke's sake.",
        "Holden: Yeah. That's what we're going to do.",
        "Lily: You keep walking away from me.",
        "Bob: Lily, Holden.",
        "Holden: Just how bad is it?",
        "Lily: I was reading online that surgery near the spinal cord, the swelling can cause some side effects, but they can be temporary.",
        "Bob: I wish I could promise you that. Holden, I want you to listen to me. We have a lot to talk about.",
        "Holden: He's paralyzed.",
        "Bob: Yes. Right now, the degree of his paralysis is affecting his lower extremities.",
        "Lily: Right now. So that means it can go away.",
        "Bob: That's right. We have to start an aggressive course of physical therapy. We have a very good department here. I've already sent his results down to them.",
        "Lily: Oh, good. You know Luke, he's so strong.",
        "Bob: That's good. And it's very important that everybody be positive. He's going to need a lot of support.",
        "Lily: He has support. He has us. He has his grandmothers. He has his sisters and his brothers.",
        "Holden: Lily, would you listen? Did you hear what he said?",
        "Lily: Yes, I did. It's gonna take some time, but Luke is gonna be all right. He said that.",
        "Holden: No, no, that's not what he said. So, Bob. He does the physical therapy. He has a positive outlook, we all have a positive outlook. And that guarantees that he recovers, right? Right?",
        "Bob: No. It's possible he might never walk again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm going to the hospital right now. You want to join me?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Dusty: Look, I don't know what Luke said to you --",
        "Noah: Nothing, I left. I thought maybe he'd rather not talk to the guy who --",
        "Dusty: You didn't do anything wrong, and he knows it.",
        "Noah: Nothing wrong? \"Hey, Luke, how about coming on a camping trip with me and my homophobic psycho dad?\"",
        "Dusty: Noah, I'm not really good at this, but Lily would know what to say.",
        "Noah: I'm not looking for you to make me feel better. I just need some -- I need some information.",
        "Dusty: Like what?",
        "Noah: The night you were yelling at my mother.",
        "Dusty: That's not important.",
        "Noah: It's kind of important to me. I know you didn't kill her, but you wanted to, right?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Noah: But you wanted to hurt her, then. Make her pay.",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Noah: I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Holden, I'm not telling you how to react. What I am telling you is we're going to ask a hell of a lot of this kid. And he's got to believe that he has a chance. And he has to see that you believe it too.",
        "Holden: He will.",
        "Bob: I'm being completely honest with you. Things could get worse before they get better.",
        "Lily: Oh my God.",
        "Bob: Don't give up hope.",
        "Holden: Right, right.",
        "Bob: Now do you want me to talk to him, or do you want to tell him?",
        "Holden: No, I think that we should talk to him.",
        "Bob: Okay, I'm going to talk to the head of physical therapy. We have to start right away.",
        "Lily: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Bob: I am being completely honest with you. If I didn't think he had a chance, I would tell you so. So don't give up hope. It's not fair to Luke.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Oh, Holden --",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm gonna do everything that Luke needs me to do.",
        "Lily: I know, but you've been so --",
        "[Crash]",
        "[Luke is lying on the floor]",
        "Lily: Oh, Luke! Luke!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Okay, this is awkward now.",
        "Sofie: No, no, no, it's not. So you set up the meeting with Lisa? She didn't -- she didn't say that on the phone.",
        "Gwen: Well, yeah. I just wanted to talk to her about you.",
        "Sofie: You didn't have to do that, Gwen. I'm serious. You don't have to take care of me.",
        "Alison: Yeah, she has Aaron for that.",
        "Sofie: Yes, yes, I have to be more self-sufficient and independent. Like you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, do you want to go get us a table at Al's?",
        "Sofie: Gwen, no. I can handle this myself.",
        "Alison: Do you hear yourself? Like, one of the biggest things in your life is about to happen, and you're worried about her fabulous career as a cocktail waitress.",
        "Gwen: Alison! Would you back off, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What were you trying to do?",
        "Luke: Move.",
        "Nurse: Here, now you won't have to go through that again.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Nurse: I'll get you a new tray.",
        "Luke: I'm not hungry. Did you get the test results back?",
        "Lily: We just spoke to Bob, and temporary paralysis is very normal, but you're going to start physical therapy, and there's no reason to get alarmed right now.",
        "Luke: What did he say, Dad?",
        "Lily: Luke, I just told you what he said.",
        "Holden: Lily, he wants the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, you just need to calm down, okay? I'm the one who wanted to help Sofie. She didn't ask me to do it.",
        "Alison: She never does. No, she never has to. She just plays the innocent victim, and everyone comes rushing to her rescue.",
        "Sofie: Everyone? Or Aaron?",
        "Alison: Yeah, you started with him. Oh, can you help me make a Mai Tai? And while you're at it can you fix my life for me?",
        "Sofie: The fact that we were friends just drove you crazy.",
        "Alison: It wasn't the friendship, it was the way you were using it.",
        "Sofie: Well, I can see why you saw it that way after all the things you've gotten yourself mixed up in. It's no wonder you think the worst of everyone.",
        "Alison: Its fun putting me down, isn't it? It's fun being better than me. At least I don't use people. See you around.",
        "Sofie: Its okay, go after her.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not. Her behavior's not okay. Please, understand she's on all these hormone shots.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, and they make her tell the truth? She's right, Gwen. This job is my problem.",
        "Gwen: Don't listen to anything Alison said.",
        "Sofie: She's got a point. Even I can see that. So I'm going to ask you to back off, Gwen. I don't want your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, there aren't any guarantees. But there is a shot, and we just have to make the best of it. That is, you have to make the best of it.",
        "Luke: Thanks.",
        "Holden: Bob's talking to the physical therapy department right now. You're going to start that right away.",
        "Luke: All right. Look, could you guys just leave me alone right now?",
        "Lily: Honey, I don't know if it's a good idea.",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure, sure. We'll be right outside. Call us if you need us.",
        "Luke: That's all I can do. Mom?",
        "Lily: Yeah?",
        "Luke: Have you heard from Noah?",
        "Lily: Do you want me to call him?",
        "Luke: No. He knows where I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I thought everyone knew why I was angry at your mother.",
        "Noah: 'Cause you were one of her --",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Noah: But you hated her, right?",
        "Dusty: To get back at me, your mother tried to destroy a person who never did anything to harm her.",
        "Noah: Last night at the police station, I finally found out who my dad really was. Now I know about my mom. I feel a lot better. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Noah has a lot to deal with right now.",
        "Luke: Right.",
        "Lily: He's probably afraid to see you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, right. Look, I'm kind of tired, okay?",
        "Lily: I'll call him.",
        "Luke: Okay, Mom, just let it go. It's okay, okay?",
        "Holden: Lily, let's go. Give him some time.",
        "Lily: Honey, it's gonna start getting better. You'll have your physical therapy, and you'll be getting better from that point on.",
        "Holden: Lily?",
        "Lily: So what, I can't even talk to my son now? Is that what it is?",
        "Holden: Hey, Sweetie.",
        "Lily: Hey, Honey.",
        "Holden: What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: These are beautiful.",
        "Faith: Aunt Meg said I could give these to Luke.",
        "Lily: Luke's gonna love them. He's gonna be so happy to see you.",
        "Faith: Is he okay?",
        "Lily: He's going to be fine.",
        "Faith: Good.",
        "Holden: You know what? He's kind of in a bad mood, but don't let that bother you, okay?",
        "Faith: I think that's allowed. Hey, Luke.",
        "Luke: Hey, Kiddo.",
        "Faith: Aunt Meg said I could give these to you. But I wanted to bring you this. You feel really bad, don't you?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I kinda do.",
        "Holden: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: Calling Noah.",
        "Holden: The hell you are!",
        "Lily: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: Stopping you.",
        "Lily: I thought we were going to work through this together.",
        "Holden: You know what that is? You doing whatever you want and me keeping my mouth shut. He doesn't want you to call Noah.",
        "Lily: You might not want to see this, but Luke really cares about Noah.",
        "Holden: Okay, here we go. You making one of your decisions, all on your own.",
        "Lily: I am trying to help Luke.",
        "Holden: He doesn't want you to call Noah, and he doesn't want you to pretend that everything's going to be okay when there's a chance that it won't be.",
        "Lily: I'm just trying to balance out your negativity.",
        "Holden: No, you're trying to control everything. After the year that you've had, I don't think you should be making any decisions at all.",
        "Lily: Luke is in there, scared out of his mind. Do you think any of this is helping?",
        "Holden: You know what? You don't have to remind me that my son is paralyzed. Do you think that I forgot that my other son almost died in this very same hospital?",
        "Lily: You still blame me for that.",
        "Holden: You know what I blame you for? Taking everything into your own hands again and again. It has to stop. And if I have to be the one to stop you, I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: You heard.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Noah: I guess I should have known it was too good to be true. That my dad would suddenly be okay with something he's always had a problem with. I just wanted to believe so badly. I never wanted to see what I always knew what was inside him because if he hated Luke for who he was, that could only mean one thing. That he hated me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Does it hurt?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Faith: Do you want me to stop talking?",
        "Luke: No. I like it when you talk.",
        "Faith: But not Mom and Dad?",
        "Luke: Not Mom and Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Thank you. Thank you for throwing that in my face at a time like this.",
        "Holden: I'm just trying to get you to wake up.",
        "Lily: Everything is my fault, right?",
        "Holden: No, I think Craig and Dusty deserve a lot of the credit.",
        "Lily: Why are you doing this?",
        "Holden: Because I'm really scared. And I thought that maybe you had gotten over the pills.",
        "Lily: Maybe? You know that I have!",
        "Holden: I thought maybe you had gotten over keeping me in the dark. But you make all these decisions without me. You're checking in with Craig and Dusty, but not me.",
        "Lily: What is this? Jealousy?",
        "Holden: No. No, it's you! It's you. I thought that maybe we could get through all this together. But I --",
        "Lily: What? What is it?! Just, my God, just say it!",
        "Holden: I just don't think I can trust you anymore!",
        "[Faith comes out of Luke's room]",
        "Faith: He knows you're fighting. It's making him really sad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: So, we still have things in common. Old movies. Family members who want us dead.",
        "Noah: Getting people hurt just because they know us.",
        "Maddie: You know, it wasn't easy for me to go see Casey in the hospital, but I'm really glad that I did.",
        "Noah: I am not going to see Luke.",
        "Maddie: Why not?",
        "Noah: Because I think I've hurt him enough already.",
        "Maddie: Hmm, and staying away isn't going to hurt him?",
        "Noah: Well, it wouldn't be the first time. Come on, Maddie, you don't have to stay here. We both know you don't owe me anything.",
        "Maddie: You know, when I found out about my sister, I never felt so alone. But I wasn't. I had Henry. And Margo. And Tom. And Gwen -- and this whole long list.",
        "Noah: My list? Not so long.",
        "Maddie: Well, there is one name on that list. Whether you like it or not, you have a friend. A friend who is not going to let you sit here alone. So you are either going to the hospital to see Luke, or you're coming with me. Those are your only options.",
        "Noah: You're very bossy.",
        "Maddie: You're right. I kind of like it. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Wait, I don't even -- I don't understand why you won't at least talk to Lisa.",
        "Sofie: Because you set it up, not me.",
        "Gwen: That doesn't even make any sense.",
        "Sofie: It does. It does, to me. Because every time you try to help me, something bad happens.",
        "Gwen: I understand that you're upset about what happened with Cole, and I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: Gwen. Gwen, no. No, no. I'm not blaming you, okay? That's not it. I just think that we are not a good combination. I think we should steer clear of one another. Permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Gwen's with that girl, and it's going to be a while. Too.",
        "Barbara: No, no, what I meant was that we've got time to talk, and we have to.",
        "Will: Gwen is with --",
        "Barbara: It doesn't matter. That's not important. What's important was that Alison was there, and she went ballistic on this girl in public.",
        "Will: Sofie --",
        "Barbara: Will. Do you understand what I'm saying? Gwen was very, very upset with Alison.",
        "Will: This matters to you because?",
        "Barbara: No, this matters to you. Because you and Gwen have to tell Alison that she cannot be your donor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Trying to make a run for it, huh?",
        "Alison: I'm just late.",
        "Aaron: Why don't you just say it? You're still ticked at me, and you don't want to talk to me. But I need to --",
        "Alison: Aaron, do we really need to do this? It never gets us anywhere.",
        "Aaron: Well maybe if you would stop walking away and let me say what I have to say --",
        "Alison: Aaron, I know what you're gonna say.",
        "Aaron: For example, yesterday? If you hadn't run off, what I would have said is what I've said before, that I don't care about your past.",
        "Alison: Well, you should",
        "Aaron: We need to start talking about the present.",
        "Alison: It won't change anything. Because I haven't changed. Just now, I just flipped out on Sofie. And you know why? No reason. Oh, wait, there is a reason. I don't like her. She's nice and she has problems and you help her and I don't like that. Someone's in trouble, and I love to kick them when they're down.",
        "Aaron: So, here we go, just another installment of why Alison Stewart is such a --",
        "Alison: Aaron, you don't need to be nice to me. There's no point. None at all.",
        "Aaron: That's your decision. And I have nothing to say about it.",
        "Alison: We do better apart. We should just keep it that way.",
        "Aaron: Thanks for listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You don't trust me.",
        "Holden: It seems to be mutual. There are a lot of things that you don't trust me to handle.",
        "Lily: That's because every time --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just tired of defending myself. And maybe you're right. Maybe I have done things that are indefensible.",
        "Holden: Lily, you have stopped telling me what's really on your mind.",
        "Lily: Okay. My mind? My son is in there, and he may be in love with a guy whose presence here might help Luke in his recovery.",
        "Holden: And you just know best.",
        "Lily: I think you blame Noah for what has happened, and you can't accept the fact that Luke might need him.",
        "Holden: Did it ever occur to you that if and when Noah shows up, it should be Luke's idea and not yours?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: Well, if you had talked to me, I would have told you that. But you don't talk. You just act.",
        "Lily: Oh, oh, I see. I know what you think now. You think Luke can't walk because of me. So maybe we found something we both agree on. You don't think I spent all last night thinking about that man, meeting him, knowing how much he hated Luke, knowing he could snap at any minute? I thought I could do something. I thought I could get him to accept. I was stupid and arrogant. We both agree on that.",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: Now our son won't be able to walk, possibly, and I'll be fine. But Luke, he may never -- never walk.",
        "Holden: Lily?",
        "Nurse: Dr. Hughes sent over some exercises to go over with Luke.",
        "Lily: Yes. Yes, yes, yes, he said that we should start that right away.",
        "Nurse: I thought I'd show them to him right now.",
        "Lily: Okay, I'll come with you so I can help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: It's not that I'm against the in vitro process.",
        "Will: That's good to know.",
        "Barbara: It's just that after that little scene this morning, it's very clear that Alison is not who you want to be your donor.",
        "Will: Not who you want to be the donor.",
        "Barbara: Don't you remember biology class? Remember genetics? If you use Alison's egg, her genes will be your baby's genes, and God knows what shape her genes are in after what she's done to and with that body of hers.",
        "Will: Okay, all right, that's it, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I'm not being judgmental here. I'm just being reasonable. I'm being practical, Will!",
        "Will: So this is about genetics. It's not that you don't like Alison. It's how this could affect the baby.",
        "Barbara: Right.",
        "Will: Well, in that case, then I probably shouldn't be the father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, there you are.",
        "Alison: Yeah. So where should we start? What a jerk I am or how sweet Sofie is? Or a combination of both?",
        "Gwen: You're not a jerk, but I am worried about you. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: Look, you can just say it.",
        "Gwen: Say what?",
        "Alison: Gwen, you're being really nice, but you just saw me freak out for no reason. So if you don't want me to be the donor anymore, I understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie, what happened? What's wrong?",
        "Sofie: No, no, don't! Just -- just leave me alone, okay?",
        "Aaron: You know what? Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Okay, could you maybe slow down to just 90 miles an hour? Of course Will and I still want you to be the donor.",
        "Alison: How can you say that? You just saw me act like a complete lunatic. You have every right to help whoever you want to help, and it's none of my business.",
        "Gwen: Actually, it is your business. I was helping Sofie for you.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Gwen: If you would have let me talk for five seconds, I would have explained. My thought being that if Sofie had a job, Aaron wouldn't worry about her so much, and then she wouldn't get in the way of you two.",
        "Alison: That's really nice, Gwen. It's too bad that Aaron and I -- are totally over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, I didn't mean -- it's just, I don't think you should always be taking care of me.",
        "Aaron: Alison told you that, didn't she?",
        "Sofie: No.",
        "Aaron: I just talked to her. I know she did.",
        "Sofie: Okay, maybe she said that, but it's what I think, too.",
        "Aaron: Since when?",
        "Sofie: Did you and Alison have another fight about me?",
        "Aaron: No, and we never will again. It is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So then, yesterday, I left him there, and then I realized how stupid that was, so then I went back, but Sofie was there and he had his arms around her.",
        "Gwen: And that made you mad. I get it.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what made me even more mad is that she's just so much nicer than I am.",
        "Gwen: Okay, all right, now at this point, you're actually getting on my nerves.",
        "Alison: Gwen, do you think I flipped out on Sofie this morning just because you were helping her?",
        "Gwen: Then why did you?",
        "Alison: Because I'm scared that Aaron really will be happier with someone like her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Whatever happens, you can't let me come between you and Ali.",
        "Aaron: We don't need your help, Sofie. We can self-destruct all on our own.",
        "Sofie: But you're so upset about it, you obviously want to work it out.",
        "Aaron: You know what I want? Someone who isn't so wrapped up in themselves that --",
        "Sofie: What? Aaron, what is it?",
        "Aaron: I talked to Alison. I talked to her about you. I talked to her about her past. But what we didn't talk about -- my brother --",
        "Sofie: Your brother what?",
        "Aaron: Nothing. Let's just say the story of Alison and Aaron is not my first priority this morning, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I make Aaron miserable, Gwen. I don't even try, I just do. And Aaron, being Aaron, is whatever's wrong. But what's wrong is me, and I do not fix that easily.",
        "Gwen: I know. I know you're right. You're a really horrible person. Just helping Will and me have a baby is terrible.",
        "Alison: Gwen, can you just do me a favor?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Can we just start this day over, and let's just pretend I just gave you really good news.",
        "Gwen: You did.",
        "Alison: Okay, and then we can delete the part where I had a complete meltdown, and we can just skip to the part where you get to tell Will the good news.",
        "Gwen: Okay, let's go.",
        "Alison: No. No, just you and Will. No third wheel.",
        "Gwen: Alison, you're not.",
        "Alison: No. Let me do this one thing right. Just this one thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You have proven my point.",
        "Will: I did?",
        "Barbara: Genetics. You are exactly like your father. You have taken something that's very, very painful to me and made a joke out of it.",
        "Will: Mom, all I'm saying is that if having a bad past means you shouldn't have children, then I wouldn't be in the running, either.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you are not Alison! You are nothing like Alison, and Alison is half Emily, let's not forget that. The paragon of mental health.",
        "Will: Okay, that's it. Mom, I know you worry about me, and I know you want what's best for me, but honestly, after everything Gwen's been through this year, I'm not gonna hand her another disappointment. Do you understand that? Do you?",
        "Barbara: Would it matter or not if I did?",
        "Will: No, that's right. And another thing. This baby is going to be one fourth you. And I have a feeling your genes are going to kick Alison's genes' butts.",
        "Barbara: Don't make fun of me, Will.",
        "Will: This isn't a sad thing. This is a really happy thing. All right? And you know what, the first time you hold this kid, you're gonna forget that we even had this conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why don't you wait downstairs? Lily's inside with Luke.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to talk to Lily. I'd like to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: She seems very nice. Faith says that you know that your dad and I have been fighting. And I have to tell you something, this is very, very important. I have fought with your dad in the past, and something tells me I might fight with him in the future, but it doesn't change the fact that we're here for you. Your brothers and your sisters, you have so much family, more family than you even want. You are not alone.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Lily: So, do you want to talk about Noah?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Lily: Okay. Then why don't you listen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Okay, life really bites, we have two options. We have \"Comfort: The Best Years of our Lives,\" and \"Diversion,\" which is the court \u0096 [Noah kisses Maddie] what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So not only is Noah processing a lot, but he might think that you don't want to see him. I could call him and talk to him.",
        "Luke: Mom. It just doesn't matter, okay? It doesn't matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why don't you wait downstairs? I'll tell Lily that you're here.",
        "Dusty: Look, Lily did not know that Colonel Mayer was so dangerous. She was trying to get through to him.",
        "Holden: Wow. Wow. I am so lucky to have you here to explain my wife to me.",
        "Dusty: She didn't want to tell you she was trying to help me.",
        "Holden: You know what? This is between me and my wife. And I know how much you respect that.",
        "Dusty: I do. So you don't want to know what happened or why. You just want to blame it on Lily. That's a little high and mighty of you, don't you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You are a wonderful man.",
        "Will: You're not always wrong.",
        "Barbara: And you have a wonderful attitude about this. But --",
        "Will: No, no buts.",
        "Barbara: Okay, talk to Gwen. I'm not making this up. She was very upset about Alison this morning.",
        "Gwen: Hey! Hey, Barbara. Guess what?",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: I have the most incredible news. The doctors gave Alison the green light.",
        "Will: The green light? What's that?",
        "Gwen: It means that if my cycle is in sync with hers, it's time to make a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Good morning. Or is it a bad morning?",
        "Alison: No. Just thinking.",
        "Bob: You know it's funny, seeing you, I just flashed back to the morning after you were born. Your mother, I've never seen her happier.",
        "Alison: Yeah, she didn't know what was coming.",
        "Bob: And now you're helping Gwen be just as happy.",
        "Alison: That's me. I spread sunshine wherever I go.",
        "Bob: Hey, come on now.",
        "Alison: Look, I really, really hope Will and Gwen end up with a perfect baby and end up perfectly happy, but --",
        "Bob: But?",
        "Alison: But that's not why I did it. Like everything else I do, I did it just for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hey Dad, it's me. I got my cell on. So if Luke needs anything, or if you just want to talk, give me a call. I hope you got good news. Bye.",
        "Sofie: Hey, you want me to make you some lunch?",
        "Aaron: No. It's okay.",
        "Sofie: You want to tell me what's wrong?",
        "Aaron: I think you have enough to deal with without hearing my problems.",
        "Sofie: You know what? That just tells me that I'm doing the right thing.",
        "Aaron: And that is --",
        "Sofie: Leaving.",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Sofie: It's like Alison said. You have done so much for me. If you don't think I can handle you telling me your problems, that's not right.",
        "Aaron: Sofie --",
        "Sofie: You know, there are things that I don't tell you, either. Like I want Cole to come back, but I know you think that that's stupid or weak or something, so I don't tell you. But it's the truth.",
        "Aaron: It doesn't matter what I think. I don't have any answers.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well, I have one, finally. I have to start taking care of myself. So I have to get out of here. I have to get away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Right. You're going through hormone hell so that someone else can have a baby. How selfish is that.",
        "Alison: It is. Because I'm only doing it so Aaron thinks I'm not -- like I am.",
        "Bob: I'm sorry if this upsets you, Alison, but I think you're a nice person.",
        "Alison: You're easy to fool.",
        "Bob: Right. So anybody that likes you is a fool. You're just like your mother.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Here's looking at you, Kid.",
        "Maddie: Noah, put it down. Drinking isn't going to fix anything.",
        "Noah: Nothing's going to fix anything. Maddie, I've made a mess of everything.",
        "Maddie: I know, Noah. I felt that way, too. But you just need time. You need time to see that.",
        "Noah: I need you. I need what we had together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You get some rest, and I will find out what happened to that breakfast tray. You can have something to eat, and we'll start the exercises, okay? It's going to be all right. I know it.",
        "Holden: I don't just blame her.",
        "Dusty: It seems that way.",
        "Holden: No, I remember how it all started. You slipped her a murder weapon. You turned to her to save your own skin.",
        "Dusty: I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you didn't stop there, did you? You used her every step of the way. You didn't care about her or what happened to her, let alone her family.",
        "Dusty: That's not true, but okay, fine. Just don't take it out on her. Take it out on me.",
        "Holden: Done.",
        "[Holden punches Dusty. Lily walks out of Luke's room and sees Holden punch Dusty]",

        "Lily: Our son is going through the most difficult time of his life, and you and I are barely speaking. What are we gonna do about that?",
        "Luke: What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: I need your help.",
        "Jack: Dr. Evers, hi.",
        "Carly: Jack, let me talk to him.",
        "Jack: Just sit.",
