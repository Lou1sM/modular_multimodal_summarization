        "Dominic: The kid looks a little edgy. Is he ready to rumble or what?",
        "Dusty: Aaron's not a professional. I told you I could do better.",
        "Dominic: We got no time to do better. My guy's on a plane to Oakdale. Now, I've got sponsors, promoters, endorsements. Sign this Snyder kid, Donovan. Now, or the deal's off, man. No fight, no Metro buyout, I walk.",
        "Dusty: Aaron, you got a second?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: And don't forget to \"Rock the Vote.\" Hi, welcome to Al's. Can I start you off with something to drink? I'm sorry, but we're closing.",
        "Emily: I thought you were open 24 hours.",
        "Alison: Not for back-stabbing sisters we're not. I'm sorry, I know that I promised service with a smile for every customer, but I can't wait on that woman over there. It's kind of personal.",
        "Manager: I \"kind of\" don't care.",
        "Alison: Can you please just take her order, just this one time?",
        "Manager: I'm the manager. You are the server. Wait on her or you're fired.",
        "Alison: So, first you take Chris, and now you want to take my job away from me, too?",
        "Emily: Honey, we need to talk.",
        "Alison: Okay, fine. The specials are the American burger and the turkey hash. And that comes with a side of --",
        "Emily: Honey, please. Will you just listen to me?",
        "Alison: No, I don't have to listen. So, what do you want?",
        "Emily: I'll have the all-American hamburger, please. And some fries and an iced tea.",
        "Alison: And how do you want your burger?",
        "Emily: Ali, you know how I want my burger.",
        "Alison: I don't know anything about you, Emily. I thought I did once, but I was wrong.",
        "Emily: Okay. I'll have my hamburger well done. Thank you. Waitress? Excuse me, young lady, I'd love a glass of water, and can you be a doll and bring me a sliced lemon, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You're right, he's gone.",
        "Barbara: I think I have a cramp.",
        "Rick: I'll rub it.",
        "Barbara: Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's all right, its fine. We did it. We did it. Let me see.",
        "Rick: Dear lady, the keys to our freedom.",
        "Barbara: As soon as we have these made into keys, I am free.",
        "Rick: We're free.",
        "Barbara: We're free. We're free, silly.",
        "Rick: Barbara, I haven't felt this kind of a rush since -- well, let's not go there. Barbara, you have given me my life back again. I feel -- you make me feel alive. You make me feel like a man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Now, if I'm on the run, I take the road less traveled. It's harder to track.",
        "Rosanna: And probably not even on this map.",
        "Carly: But we're so close, Rosanna. I can feel it. Jack could be home with me and the kids, maybe even by tonight.",
        "Rosanna: Not unless we narrow the search. We can't stop at every small town on route 64. We need the kind of help that the police can give us.",
        "Carly: Oh, please, don't start about Hal again. Okay?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on, Carly, the odds of being wrong are too high. Are you looking at this map?",
        "Carly: Rosanna, you look at it and you see roadblocks. I look at it and I see Jack waiting out there for me to find him. I know the odds, but that's never stopped me before. I'll be damned if it'll stop me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: Nothing.",
        "Hal: No notes? No map? Nothing, huh?",
        "Nikki: Nothing. I searched everywhere. They're obviously running.",
        "Hal: Yeah, but why would he run from Carly and his kids? I mean, he's crazy about his family.",
        "Nikki: I don't know. What about this other wife?",
        "Hal: I don't know. When I put the pieces together, it just doesn't add up to the jack I know.",
        "Chief: Meet Denny Blackmoor, lieutenant. If your man has a fake I.D., chances are this is where he got it.",
        "Blackmoor: You've got nothing on me. I'm clean.",
        "Hal: Danny Blackmoor, let me ask you a question. Do you know this guy? Hmm, you know him? That's Jack Snyder. Now, if you know him, or saw him on the street, said \"hi\" to him at a bar, I want to know that. And I want to know that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Is he asleep?",
        "Jack: Out cold as soon as he hit the sheets.",
        "Julia: That's always good.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Julia: I got you some protein bars.",
        "Jack: Oh, you spoil me.",
        "Julia: So, how far is it to Louisville?",
        "Jack: 80, 90 miles tops. Depending on which route we take.",
        "Julia: I still feel like we should have kept going. You know, I should have taken over the driving.",
        "Jack: I know, you're exhausted as I am. It's only one night. No one's going to find us.",
        "Julia: I know, but if Greta Williams calls the police --",
        "Jack: She's one social worker with a whole hospital of patients to manage. She doesn't have time to obsess over a perfectly healthy patient whose memory is on the fritz.",
        "Julia: It's not just her, Jack.",
        "Jack: Okay, if you're worried about les resurfacing to hassle you about J.J., don't be. Honestly, I don't think the bum has it in him to make the effort. We're fine. This is our new life. We should be celebrating. Come on.",
        "Julia: What? Here?",
        "Jack: I know it's not five star, but its home, at least for tonight.",
        "Julia: Oh.",
        "Jack: Let's make a toast.",
        "Julia: With milk?",
        "Jack: It's not just any milk, its whole milk. Nothing but the best for my family. Look at that.",
        "Julia: We really are a family, though, huh?",
        "Jack: Oh, you bet we are. And nobody's gonna change that. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm -- I'm sorry. I -- I couldn't control myself. You are so beautiful. Let's go back to my room.",
        "Barbara: Uh, we can't. We can't do that. You know why? Because if they catch us, they'll separate us. We need to think about our dream. We need to be patient.",
        "Rick: I know. But to be this close to you is --",
        "Barbara: I know. It's difficult, isn't it? Not to be able to express our innermost desires? But think about this, once we have our freedom, we won't have guards and nurses shadowing our every move.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, you're right again, as usual, my love.",
        "Barbara: The keys. We have to have the keys made for that freedom. Do you have someone to help us?",
        "Rick: Do you know Alfonso? In building maintenance?",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Rick: Well, we've done favors for each other on occasion.",
        "Barbara: Favors? What kind of \"favors\"?",
        "Rick: Well, he was in need of certain medicines and I had a few prescription pads. In exchange, he would bring me some delicacies from the outside.",
        "Barbara: Lovely. Find him.",
        "Rick: Well, wait, I'm not sure this time. I don't think that a few black market medicines are going to be enough.",
        "Barbara: How about a few thousand \"dead presidents?\" Small denominations. Completely undetectable.",
        "Rick: You are the little vixen, aren't you?",
        "Barbara: You have no idea. And the sooner we get those keys, the sooner we can start our life together. Shall we?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",

        "Alison: Your food should be coming up.",

        "Alison: Let go of me.",
        "Emily: Honey, we need to talk.",
        "Alison: No, we don't. I don't want to hear any more or your lame excuses.",
        "Emily: I'm not making any excuses. One of the hardest parts of growing up is taking responsibility for every single choice you make in life. And I made a terrible mistake. I was wrong and I hurt you and I am so sorry.",
        "Alison: You keep saying that. I'll go check on your order.",
        "Emily: I've called you childish and irresponsible, but I was the one who acted like a kid. Honey, I don't want to run away from our problems, and I don't think you do, either. So, just five minutes. That's all I'm asking. And after that, if you don't want to see me, if you don't want to talk to me again, I'll hate it, but I'll accept it.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but I have to cover this whole section. I'll be back with your burger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dominic: Hey, gorgeous. You know, you make the place classier just by walking through that door?",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Dominic: Hey. I want to apologize if I've been, I don't know, rough on you? You and Donovan, that combo just takes a little getting used to, you know? Guys in the fight game don't normally pair up with your kind.",
        "Lucy: My kind?",
        "Dominic: Yeah, you know, maybe I'm old-school, but every time I see you down at the gym, I think to myself, \"what's a classy chick like that doin' in a hole like this?\"",
        "Dusty: So, the fight's yours, if you want it.",
        "Aaron: Are you serious?",
        "Dusty: If you're serious about working your tail off.",
        "Aaron: Look, I'll beat whoever your friend Dominic throws at me.",
        "Dusty: You think so? His fighter's a pro, he's done the circuit. The guys you've been sparring with? Nothing. Nothing compared to this guy.",
        "Aaron: All I need is a chance.",
        "Dusty: You'll get a chance. Just stay in bed for two days. This guy has a rough card coming up, believe me.",
        "Aaron: You expect me to fall, fine. Okay, but I need to do more with my life than hustle drinks and clean that damn bar.",
        "Dusty: Well, it looks like you're my contender.",
        "Aaron: Looks like you got a contender.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Lucy: Please tell me I did not just hear that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: We don't have time for games. I can drop you into the system on four counts right now. Get him out of here.",
        "Blackmoor: Wait, wait, wait. If that guy is a cop, we're talking entrapment.",
        "Nikki: Yeah, you said you'd never saw Jack before in your life. How can a guy you never met \"trap\" you, Blackmoor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Going 100 miles in the wrong direction beats doing nothing.",
        "Rosanna: No, it doesn't. Come on. Can you just at least check in with Hal?",
        "Carly: Why? So he can tell me I'm going on a wild goose chase?",
        "Rosanna: Look, he has got the entire police force, he's got a communication teams.",
        "Carly: And I've got a head start. This is my husband, Rosanna. The cops, they answer to Hal or to whoever else is calling the shots. I answer to my kids. Don't you get it? I can never look them in the eye again unless I do everything in my power to bring their father home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What? What are you up to, Mrs. Jackson?",
        "Julia: I -- I just love holding you.",
        "Jack: Likewise. I checked out the map again. We should be in Louisville by mid-morning, if we make it an enough early start.",
        "Julia: I can't wait. You think it's gonna feel like home there?",
        "Jack: Baby, it doesn't matter if it's Louisville or Louisiana, as long as I'm with you. Let me go brush up. I'll be right back.",
        "Julia: He loves us, its okay. It's -- it's gonna be okay. It has to be. Keeping a relationship alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Enjoy your meal. Come again.",
        "Emily: Thank you. I'd love some ketchup. Thank you. And it looks like I'm out of napkins. Actually, I could use a little water, as well, and, come to think of it, I think I'm gonna have some dessert after the burger.",
        "Alison: Okay, five minutes. That's all. Make it quick.",
        "Emily: Honey, we both know that the women in our family are hard-wired to self destruct. It's the Stewart curse, remember? We've talked about it. I'm beginning to think it's real. I mean, maybe its part of our DNA. Maybe we learned it in the womb.",
        "Alison: We learned to sell each other out?",
        "Emily: To be restless. To always want what everybody else has. To think it's exciting to be wanted by somebody who's already wanted by somebody else.",
        "Alison: I have no clue what you're talking about.",
        "Emily: Yes, you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Mom made that mistake with Bob Hughes.",
        "Alison: That was 100 years ago.",
        "Emily: And I made it with Tom, and you made it with Aaron when he was dating Lucy. This isn't about love, Ali. It's about something that's missing inside us.",
        "Alison: You're my sister. And that's what kills me. Rule or no rule, curse or no curse, that should have stopped you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So the fight's all set, huh?",
        "Dusty: It's Aaron's call.",
        "Aaron: My record in Seattle is nine to one. Come on, Luce, smile. This is good for me. I'm going somewhere.",
        "Lucy: Well, if that's what you want, then I'm happy for you.",
        "Dusty: Take the night off. Rest up.",
        "Aaron: I'm going to the gym.",
        "Dusty: Don't burn yourself out before we get going.",
        "Aaron: Dusty, thank you so much. I'm never gonna forget this. You guys have a good day.",
        "Lucy: You told me that you were gonna find a real fighter.",
        "Dusty: Aaron's a real fighter. You see him clock that guy yesterday?",
        "Lucy: Dominic's boxer's so much more experienced --",
        "Dusty: Aaron thinks he's ready. Let's give him a chance to prove himself. And can we have some fun tonight? Ryan Cabrera's performing. What are you worried about? Aaron's a big boy. He can handle himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Let me do the talking. I'm used to our little negotiations.",
        "Barbara: But I can be very persuasive.",
        "Alfonso: Hey, Doc, what are you doin' still up? Who's your friend?",
        "Rick: Alfonso, this is Barbara Ryan.",
        "Barbara: How do you do?",
        "Rick: Barbara knows that you and I are friends. And that friends help each other when they can.",
        "Alfonso: You talked?",
        "Rick: It's all right. We're very close. She won't tell a soul.",
        "Barbara: Alfonso, Rick and I have a dream. And we think a man like you, a man who understands that sometimes you need to break the rules before they break you, can help us realize that dream.",
        "Alfonso: What's she talkin' about?",
        "Rick: We need a favor.",
        "Barbara: And we're prepared to pay handsomely.",
        "Alfonso: How much?",
        "Barbara: 10,000, cash.",
        "Alfonso: Must be a big favor.",
        "Barbara: We need some keys made.",
        "Rick: From impressions.",
        "Alfonso: How many?",
        "Barbara: Four of them.",
        "Alfonso: You need four keys to open the main security locks. You two aren't planning to break out?",
        "Barbara: No, Rick and I are planning to move on with our lives.",
        "Alfonso: I've got two months to retirement. I got a wife, a pension and an RV we're trailing south this winter. Sorry, but I'd rather spend my time on the sunny beaches of Florida than in Statesville prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Sir, I just got back from the search at Blackmoor's apartment. I think you can use this.",
        "Hal: Hoo, yeah, I think so. Thank you.",
        "Blackmoor: Look, you don't have a case. I'm not making one for you. Now if you're done here, I'm gonna --",
        "Hal: Whoa, whoa there. We just got started. Must be hard to sleep with this tucked away in your mattress.",
        "Nikki: Joseph Miller, Michael Morrison, Patrick Fitzsimmons --",
        "Hal: Wow, how many -- how many IDs you think you got, Denny? Look, you're staring down three years, hard time. That's if I decide to be real nice. Now, I want you to look at this picture again, and I want you to tell me everything you know about Jack Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Trucker #1: I told you. They seemed like nice people, but they didn't tell me where they were headed. I'm sorry. I wish I could be of more help, but we didn't speak for about a minute.",
        "Carly: And you didn't happen to hear them talking to each other about a different route number or a destination or anything?",
        "Trucker #2: Nope.",
        "Rosanna: You didn't happen to notice if they filled up their car?",
        "Trucker #2: I think so.",
        "Carly: So that would give them, what? 200, 300 miles before they have to stop again?",
        "Trucker #1: With that car? 300.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, just a sec.",
        "Trucker #2: Lady, I have a rig to haul and delivery to meet here, I'm sorry.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you so much. It's okay.",
        "Carly: Guess who? Hi, Hal.",
        "Hal: Carly, where are you?",
        "Carly: I'm at a rest stop.",
        "Hal: Which rest stop?",
        "Carly: It's on route 64. Hal, Jack was here. I just met a couple truckers who saw him and the woman and the little boy that he's traveling with. Apparently, he just hopped back on 64 less than an hour ago.",
        "Hal: I'll call highway patrol. Which direction?",
        "Carly: They didn't know. But definitely not to Nashville. What's going on there?",
        "Hal: Well, we found out that Jack is going by Jack Jackson. And he's using a fake Kentucky license.",
        "Carly: Why would he use another name?",
        "Hal: I have no idea.",
        "Carly: But it's Kentucky? You're sure it's Kentucky?",
        "Hal: Carly, don't get any ideas. Now look, I checked out Julia Larrabee. She is definitely not Julia Lindsey.",
        "Carly: You're positive?",
        "Hal: Absolutely. Now, I've got an APB out on Julia and the car. I've alerted the Kentucky state police. We've pulled her credit cards. If she uses one, we'll get a location on her. So now, I want you to come back to St. Genevieve. And if we -- get anything solid -- Carly? Carly?",
        "Rosanna: So Jack's here in Kentucky?",
        "Carly: Nashville was just a cover. He's got a fake Kentucky I.D. In the name of Jack Jackson.",
        "Rosanna: Wow. Okay, this is still a huge state, Carly.",
        "Carly: We keep looking, Rosanna! We will keep looking and we won't stop.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm not talking about stopping, but isn't it obvious by now that Hal's people have the best resources?",
        "Carly: Okay, that's great, but what does it hurt if I keep looking myself?",
        "Rosanna: It doesn't hurt, but think about it this way -- what if Hal found Jack, and you weren't there? How would you feel?",
        "Carly: Awful.",
        "Rosanna: Of course. Look, I just think that we should go back to St. Genevieve and let Hal lead us to Jack. Come on. It's the right thing to do.",
        "Carly: Okay. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Will you come with me?",
        "Rosanna: Of course I'll come with you.",
        "Carly: Okay. Good. I'm just gonna use the ladies room and I'll meet you at the car.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. You made the right choice.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I think I did.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",

        "Emily: Alison, listen to me, honey, I know I can't take back what I did, but I also know that all the old boyfriends and ex-fianc\u00e9s and ex-husbands in the world are not worth us losing each other. I love you, honey.",
        "Alison: Don't!",
        "Emily: And I cannot imagine my life without you. Alison, we're all we've got. I miss you, honey, and I hope -- God, I hope someday, you'll miss me, too. Even if it's just a little bit.",

        "Barbara: What kind of luck is this? We find ourselves a janitor who has a conscience and fully-funded pension plan? What's this?",
        "Rick: Oh, it's the weekly ceramics class. I tried it. They said I had too much anger at the wheel, though.",
        "Barbara: Ceramics means a kiln. A kiln produces high heat --",
        "Rick: Yeah, speaking of which, you're not running a fever, are you?",
        "Barbara: Listen, to me, will you? I have jewelry stashed all over my room. I have bracelets, necklaces -- I could melt them down in the kiln and use them to make the keys. Don't you think we should give it a try?",
        "Rick: That is brilliant. I'll go with you.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no. You stay here, much too conspicuous. Besides, I'm gonna need your big, strong arms around me console me if this doesn't work. I'll hurry, love.",

        "Jack: Well, I don't know how. It's not like I've had a lot of experience. Darling, I know what you're thinking.",
        "Julia: What? You do?",
        "Jack: No, you're fixating on les again. Yes. Don't worry, everyone thinks we went to Nashville, right? Your ex is never gonna us. He'll never threaten J.J. again.",
        "Julia: Thank you. I feel better, Jack, I do.",
        "Jack: The way I see it, you leveled the playing field.",
        "Julia: How?",
        "Jack: With the move. Starting over. There's no memory of a house, a home, town, friends. Nobody's going to be asking you who I am or where I'm from. I'm not the stranger in town, a guy with no memory. I'm J.J.'s dad, I'm your husband. People will take that at face value, no questions asked. Believe me.",
        "Julia: It's still overwhelming.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. Tonight, of course, but that will change. You gotta trust me.",

        "Hal: What happened?",
        "Rosanna: She said she had to use the ladies room before we hit the road. So I waited and I waited she didn't show up. And then some waitress comes along and says that she's seen Carly getting into a truck.",
        "Hal: A truck? What kind of truck?",
        "Rosanna: A semi.",
        "Hal: Oh, for -- what's the name of the hauler?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. And the waitress wasn't even sure what color it was. I'm so sorry, Hal. I never should have left her alone for a second.",
        "Hal: It's all right. I know what she's like when she gets something in her head.",
        "Rosanna: I just can't believe she's taken off with a complete stranger. I mean, even if she does find Jack, she has no idea what she's getting into.",

        "Trucker #1: Didn't your mama warn you 'bout gettin' in cars with strangers?",

        "Trucker #1: What do you want from these people you're trying to find?",
        "Carly: Just my life back. Do you think you could call your friends and tell them to keep their eye out for that silver sedan?",
        "Trucker #1: Lady, I'm not a cop.",
        "Carly: I know I sound like a lunatic, but I'm desperate here. I have no real leads, I'm just chasing thin air and I have to find them. It's the most important thing in the world to me.",

        "Lucy: No. He'll get angry.",
        "Dusty: Of course he will. No man likes to be told what to do. Hey, you think I'd let Aaron get to this if he couldn't hold his own in the ring? Come here.",

        "Alison: Didn't you ever hear of decaf, rocky?",
        "Aaron: Why are you here, Alison? Did you get fired?",
        "Alison: No, I kinda came close, though. Emily came into the diner and fixed it so I had to wait on her.",
        "Aaron: Oh, how did that go?",
        "Alison: It was awful at first, but then she kinda got me thinking about things.",
        "Aaron: Well, good. Good, because you can't hate people forever, Ali.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Aaron: Because pretty soon you just end up hating yourself.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry that I tracked you down here. It's just that, when things get weird, I'm so used to talking to you.",
        "Aaron: Ali, it's cool. It's totally cool. I told you, I'm your friend. All right? You're the reason I'm back in the gym.",
        "Alison: I am?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, all that talk about getting your life together. You know, it really got to me, Ali. I was in a rut, working at metro, hanging out late. I wasn't focused on anything.",
        "Alison: And sweating and pounding things helps get your life together?",
        "Aaron: I'm boxing again. I mean, like, I'm boxing for real now, you know? I used to fight back in Seattle, when I was, like, 12 years old. I was local champion in my weight class.",

        "Aaron: Mm-hmm. And I'm already on a local card right now.",
        "Alison: A what?",
        "Aaron: It's a local card, it's -- dusty set it up. You know, he thinks I'm a long shot, but I'm gonna prove him wrong. Anybody they bring in that ring, I'm gonna wear him down. I'm gonna float like a butterfly. And he's gonna say, \"what happened? What happen?\" And I'm just gonna swing right out, and oh -- and then, good night, baby.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what if he lands one on you? No offense, but this sounds a lot more dangerous than being in a rut.",
