        "Henry: Keep an eye on the bags over there, please?",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "B.J.: You know my new executive assistant?",
        "Mike: Henry's working for you now?",
        "Henry: And doing a phenomenal job, I might add.",
        "B.J.: Yes he is. Henry, I need a minute with Mike.",
        "Henry: And I need to check on my investments. Right over there.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Henry.",
        "Henry: Hey. Whoa --",
        "Maddie: Don't you look chic?",
        "Henry: New wardrobe for the new job.",
        "Maddie: What are you doing over there with B.J. and Mike?",
        "Henry: Working.",
        "Maddie: You're working for Byron Glass? No. Henry, no, no, no.",
        "Henry: Shh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: So, where is Katie this morning?",
        "Mike: She left for L.A. she wanted to take some master classes to get ready for the show.",
        "B.J.: She didn't tell me. I just mean, you know, I need her input while we're workin' on the studio, putting it all together. How is she going to test anything out if she's in L.A.?",
        "Mike: You sure that's all that's bothering you?",
        "B.J.: Why?",
        "Mike: Katie thinks you might have more than a professional interest in her. I'm starting to wonder myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Not a word.",
        "Dusty: We'll still have the meeting. We're just going to be an hour late.",
        "Jennifer: Why would Nurse Thompson have to delay this? She's just stalling.",
        "Dusty: No, she has no reason to. She doesn't even know about your baby. Didn't Brinks' secretary tell you anything?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. Just that Nurse Thompson would be late.",
        "Dusty: Why are you shaking? You're shaking.",
        "Jennifer: She helped steal my baby. I want her to look me in the eye and tell me why -- how she could do that.",
        "Dusty: It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. Let me call Brinks and see what's going on.",
        "Jennifer: No, you don't have to do that.",
        "Dusty: I want to. It's going to put my mind at rest. Look at this, the battery's dead. All right, I'm going to go to the pay phone. Stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Take a nap while you can.",
        "Carly: I can't. I'm too anxious. I just want to get there and catch Gwen red- handed with Rory. Iris?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: I'm still trying to figure out why she would go all the way to New York just to find Gwen and the baby.",
        "Jack: It's gotta be money. She thinks she can make a buck off of Gwen. She isn't gonna let that go.",
        "Carly: You know, Iris has to know that Gwen is gonna lose Rory now, after what she's done. Any sane person would just let it go. There's gotta be something else. You know, I know that the two of them -- they say they just met. But, there is something going on between them Jack. There's gotta be some connection. What?",
        "Jack: The connection's obvious, Carly. It's staring you right in the face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: C'mon lady, we're wasting time. My daughter's hiding and you know where she is.",
        "Ms. Clemens: Why are you so sure?",
        "Iris: Because, you're the only reason why she came to New York. She kept your postcards. She kept 'em. You're the only one she could go to now.",
        "Ms. Clemens: Then I hope she will.",
        "Iris: You wanna get mixed up in a kidnapping?",
        "Ms. Clemens: What?",
        "Iris: Yeah, you heard me. My Gwennie -- she's done a terrible thing. I'm just want to make it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: No, please don't go.",
        "Will: What is it?",
        "Gwen: Everything. Here I am, in another crummy room. Cops are probably out looking for me. They catch me, they'll take my baby. I'll probably never get him back. Your life is trashed because you came along. Everything is a total mess. And I'm so happy.",
        "Will: Me, too.",
        "Gwen: You look at me like you're glad I'm here. Nobody's ever done that before.",
        "Will: Get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Clemens: Gwen is involved in a kidnapping?",
        "Iris: Yeah. The baby that she had with her belonged to somebody else. She took that baby from the legal parents and then she ran off.",
        "Ms. Clemens: Why would she do something like that?",
        "Iris: She had a baby and then she gave it up. And then she decided that was a huge mistake. But it was too late. So, she started doing stupid things and these parents -- boy they're gonna press some charges on her. Believe it or not, I'm just trying to help.",
        "Ms. Clemens: That would be a first.",
        "Iris: You got no use for me. I remember that. But you used to pretend to care for Gwen. And if you still do, you'll tell me where she is.",
        "Ms. Clemens: If I see her, I'll tell her what you've said.",
        "Iris: If?",
        "Ms. Clemens: I have to go.",
        "Iris: You know where she is?",
        "Ms. Clemens: I have classes to teach.",
        "Iris: Wait, you can't lie. Isn't that right? It's like a Quaker thing? That's why you won't say that you haven't seen Gwen. You know where she is but you can't admit it because you'd commit some sin or something.",
        "Ms. Clemens: Mrs. Dumbrowski, I watched you treat your daughter worse than a stray dog for years. So I have no trouble telling you this -- if I knew where Gwen was, I would never tell you.",
        "Iris: Hey! You're going straight to hell 'cause you lied to my face! Gwen's here, all right. I'm gonna find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby fussing]",
        "Will: You get him and I'll check the door.",
        "Gwen: Hey, little man. Hey, don't cry. You want us to get found out? Anything?",
        "Will: No. There's nobody down here. I heard the recess bell a little while ago. [Baby fussing] So I think they're all in class.",
        "Gwen: Look, he's teething again. We need some of that for his gums.",
        "Will: You sure he isn't just hungry?",
        "Gwen: I don't get it. How do people know? They just look at their kid and magically know why he's crying?",
        "Will: Well, it's gotta be like a year before he says his first word, and then it'll be something helpful like Mama, or Dada. Scissors.",
        "Gwen: Scissors?",
        "Will: My mother says it was the first word I said. She was doing a lot of designing when I was little. She said I wanted to help.",
        "Gwen: I say you wanted to be armed.",
        "Will: With her? Oh yeah.",
        "Gwen: Even then, you knew. He's quieter.",
        "Will: It's not magic, Gwen. Everybody has to guess. It's trial and error.",
        "Gwen: You think?",
        "Will: Yeah. You feed him and change his diaper.",
        "Gwen: I love how you keep getting out of that.",
        "Will: I'm gonna go find some goo for his gums, just in case.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Munson. Don't take too long.",
        "Will: I'll hurry. If he starts crying again, just --",
        "Gwen: I can handle him. I'm happier when you're around.",
        "Will: Me, too.",
        "Gwen: That's it -- you feel better? You just don't want us to get busted. You know, don't you? You know, if you're quiet we can all stay together. Huh? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Gwen and Iris bonded so quickly, honey because they had a mutual enemy -- one that came after them with both barrels.",
        "Carly: You saying that Iris flew to New York because she hates me?",
        "Jack: And she knows you hate her. You have it in for both of them.",
        "Carly: That's not true. I don't hate Gwen. Well, I didn't hate her at first. When Rosanna first told me about her, I felt really bad for her. She sounded like a messed up kid. Then she shows up and demands Rory back when she couldn't take care of a kitten, much less a baby.",
        "Jack: And that's when feeling sorry for her became something not so pretty.",
        "Carly: I just want her to go away. I want to get Rory back. I want to bring him home where he's safe. Is she going to go to jail?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: Gwen. Is she going to go to jail for the kidnapping?",
        "Jack: No, she shouldn't have to honey. If we don't want to press it. If we ask for leniency -- you want her to go to jail?",
        "Carly: She earned it, didn't she? Come on Jack, we don't want to worry every day that she's going to show up and kidnap him again. Maybe some time in lockup is just what she needs so she can think about what she's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: No, Dusty. Dusty, wait. I don't want you to bug the investigator.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Jennifer: Because we have an hour -- now it's less -- and then maybe I just need the time.",
        "Dusty: All right, you don't have to do it now. But we've only got one shot at surprising this nurse, you know that.",
        "Jennifer: No, I know, I know, and I want to be calm, but I just can't imagine how a nurse, someone who has spent her life helping people -- I mean, she works in neo-natal with some of the most helpless, fragile babies. She's seen those babies die. She's seen what it's done to mothers. How could she let me think that my baby was dead? What kind of monster is that?",
        "Dusty: That's how you ask her. Just like that.",
        "Jennifer: And I'm sure Craig paid her a lot of money, but that doesn't -- that's not a reason, is it?",
        "Dusty: No. Let's go upstairs. We'll get a drink, we'll go upstairs and wait, all right?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, okay, but we -- I don't -- we can't miss her.",
        "Dusty: I'm not gonna let you miss this shot. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Craig sent me because he knew they were on to you. Listen, you need to go to Miami. You need to get on a -- don't stop at your house, because Dusty's P.I. probably has it staked out. You just get -- Kristin! Ms. Thompson, listen to me. Drive to Miami and get on the next plane out of the country.",
        "Nurse Thompson: Did you hear her?",
        "Emily: Yes, I heard her. She's upset.",
        "Nurse Thompson: She called me a monster.",
        "Emily: I know.",
        "Nurse Thompson: And she's right.",
        "Emily: We have to move fast.",
        "Nurse Thompson: I'm staying. I need to tell that poor woman the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: So, I was talking about computer connections. You know, like a network. Of course, the woman I was interviewing heard something else altogether, and I just, you know, didn't get it. Anyway, I guess I'm still learning how to interface with humans. So I'm sorry if anything I've said to Katie came out wrong in any way.",
        "Mike: No offense.",
        "B.J.: None taken. Katie's a beautiful woman, I guess she gets hit on day and night.",
        "Mike: Not if I can help it.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I'm sure not. So, what's the deal? You still want to work for me?",
        "Mike: Sure.",
        "B.J.: Are you? Sure, I mean. Because I wanna run another project by you. It's huge. And it's a hell of a lot more fun than putting up dry wall in the studio.",
        "Mike: All right, what is it?",
        "B.J.: Come on, I'll show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: He's dangerous, Henry. B.J. --",
        "Henry: -- Is here. Hey, you remember my little sister Maddie?",
        "B.J.: Yes, of course. I don't think of her as your sister, though, I think of her as an amazing, new intern who's an incredible addition to our staff.",
        "Henry: Huh.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "B.J.: Henry, I'm going to take Mike over to the new project.",
        "Henry: Right, just let me know when you're done, I'll get the rest of day wired.",
        "Mike: Later.",
        "Maddie: Bye.",
        "Henry: I got a million things to do.",
        "Maddie: To wire, you mean?",
        "Henry: Exactly.",
        "Maddie: Henry, what's a mainframe server?",
        "Henry: A burly waiter?",
        "Maddie: An isp?",
        "Henry: A lisp without an L.",
        "Maddie: What are you doing in this job? You are no way qualified to be Mr. dot com's assistant.",
        "Henry: It's a perfect fit, Madeline. He needs help getting organized, and I need an outrageous salary.",
        "Maddie: He needs you to keep things quiet for him, okay? He doesn't want the world knowing that B.J. Green used to be some poor schlub named Byron Glass.",
        "Henry: So what? So what?",
        "Maddie: It's creepy, that's what. For all we know, he has some shrine locked away.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: Poster-sized pictures of Katie, prom pictures where Byron glued his head over Katie's date's head so it looks like he was her date, and candles, and a tissue from when she wiped her lipstick off with ten years ago that he took out of the trash after she walked away. And he has a list of, you know, all the times that Katie talked to him, and what she said and what he said.",
        "Henry: That's it, that's it. Big breath. Take a big breath for me, will you? [Maddie sighs] There you go. You've been watching too many victim of the week movies, you have.",
        "Maddie: Oh, come on, you don't see that he has \"stalker\" written all over him?",
        "Henry: No, I see a successful businessman who's gonna make a big change in your life and in mine.",
        "Maddie: How?",
        "Henry: Well, see, you skipped over the part about the outrageous salary, huh? Did you notice?",
        "Maddie: That's like two months' donut-slinging, right there.",
        "Henry: That's two days' salary.",
        "Maddie: He pays you each day?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maddie: So he doesn't have a trail behind? So he can disappear at any minute with Katie as his unwilling love slave.",
        "Henry: Oh, love slave -- oh, honey, come on. Give -- would you look at this, all right. This is our ticket out. This will get us a place of our own. So you won't have to stay with tom and Margo anymore. Yeah, I thought that would appeal. So lay off of my new boss, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Honey, listen to me, nobody wants to see Jennifer in pain. I don't. But she will get better, okay?",
        "Nurse Thompson: How? She needs her baby.",
        "Emily: She does not need to be connected to Craig Montgomery. Her marriage ended because of the baby. Jennifer needs a fresh start, Kristin.",
        "Nurse Thompson: It sounds like you know her very well.",
        "Emily: I do know her, that's why I'm trying to --",
        "Nurse Thompson: How can you look her in the eye?",
        "Emily: It's not easy, okay? Some days, it's really hard.",
        "Nurse Thompson: Then why don't you tell her?",
        "Emily: Tell her? The truth? I can't. I mean, it's not black and white.",
        "Nurse Thompson: How can you work for Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Emily: The same way you can.",
        "Nurse Thompson: Not anymore.",
        "Emily: Listen to me, you'll go to jail. What you did was a crime. You'll get convicted of kidnapping at the very least. You say one word, you'll be throwing away the rest of your life.",
        "Nurse Thompson: What will my life be worth if I don't tell that poor woman the truth. I owe it to her.",

        "Carly: Well, hi, my gorgeous boy. Was he here all along?",
        "Flight Attendent: He's here. You have a beautiful baby boy.",
        "Carly: Yes, yes I --",
        "Iris: What have you done to my boy? You killed my boy. You don't deserve another chance, little girl. You killed my son.",
        "Jack: Hey, bad dream?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: It's all right, its okay. Try -- try to go back to sleep. We've got a little while longer.",
        "Carly: I am so scared, Jack.",
        "Jack: I know. So am I.",
        "Carly: I'm afraid we're not gonna get Rory back.",

        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Gwen: Coming. How did you get here?",
        "Iris: I know you, baby doll. A mother always knows without being told.",
        "Gwen: Get the hell out.",
        "Iris: You need me, Gwennie.",
        "Gwen: Oh, please.",
        "Iris: I'm your only hope.",
        "Gwen: How? Why?",
        "Iris: A normal life with your son? You see, I figured out a way that you'll be able to keep that sweet baby and nobody'll ever be able to take him away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "B.J.: You wanna know if I plan to stay in Oakdale for good.",
        "Iris: I've never seen him before in my life.",
        "Will: I've met your mom before, Gwen. She's Carly's spy.",
        "Emily: You listen to me. You get on the next plane back to Oakdale. This is about to blow sky high.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, right. So you're saying you can fix it so I can have my baby. Make up your mind, Mom. You're the one who said if I took him now, I'd lose him.",
        "Iris: Well, you would, normally. I mean, it was a dumb idea.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. There's the door.",
        "Iris: Oh, come on, Gwennie, its common sense. I mean, look at the trouble you're in now.",
        "Gwen: So what, I was supposed to leave him with that baby killer instead? No.",
        "Iris: You jumped the gun, Gwennie. Your lawyer and I went to court this morning. We told the judge about Carly's history, I testified, Cass brought the police records. The judge was shocked. He issued an order right there that the baby be taken away from Carly immediately.",
        "Gwen: Are you serious?",
        "Iris: Uh-huh. Done deal. He said it right there in court, that the baby should be with his natural mother.",
        "Gwen: So, he's mine now, legally?",
        "Iris: Well, that was the plan, but --",
        "Gwen: But he found out I ran away, so I really blew it.",
        "Iris: Yeah, well, no, no, no, no, no. See, we fixed it, your lawyer and me.",
        "Gwen: How?",
        "Iris: We went back to court and we explained the circumstances that you were scared about the baby's safety. So if you come home, you won't be charged with a crime.",
        "Gwen: Oh, please, Mom.",
        "Iris: He is your son. The judge understood that your motherly instinct thing kind of kicked in.",
        "Gwen: There's no way that that judge would give me custody now.",
        "Iris: Well, I mean, I'd be like a trial period. But you should've seen your lawyer and I work that judge over. And he agreed that if you and the baby come live with me that he would give you a, what do ya call it, provisional custody.",
        "Gwen: Live with you?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I guess he figured that a more stable environment for the baby would be --",
        "Gwen: Stable? Has he seen your court record?",
        "Iris: You want to insult me, or do you want your baby?",
        "Gwen: I have my baby.",
        "Iris: Yeah, yeah, you've got your baby. On the run. What kind of life is that, Gwen? But if you and that baby live with me, then you're home free and clear.",
        "Gwen: Where are the papers?",
        "Iris: The what?",
        "Gwen: You said it was a court order. Where is it?",
        "Iris: Cass Winthrop has them. And he's flying to New York right now. So if, you know, you don't trust me, you can talk him and he'll explain it to you.",
        "Gwen: Cass is coming here?",
        "Iris: Yeah. He's on a plane right now, and you know, if you just hang tight for a few of minutes then, you know, you can ask him all the questions you want. Oh. Hello, pumpkin. Ah, so sweet when they're sleeping.",
        "Gwen: You know, so let me get this straight. I can come back to Oakdale, no charges, and keep my baby if I live with you?",
        "Iris: That's right. Now, Cass will explain. Aw, look at him.",
        "Gwen: Mom --",
        "Iris: Honey, I'm not here to hound you, okay? I made you an offer. If you want it, you take it. If you don't, you don't.",
        "Gwen: Then what?",
        "Iris: Then you just keep going the way you are and I'll cover for you. And I'll wish you luck.",
        "Gwen: And that's it?",
        "Iris: I just want you to be happy. You have a beautiful baby boy. And I hope that you can give him the life that you didn't get. Because you both deserve it. Okay, you have my number.",
        "Will: Hey, hey, check it out. I found the carriage Ms. Clemens was talking about.",
        "Gwen: Will, this is my mom, Iris Dumbrowski.",
        "Will: This is your mother?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I'm here to help Gwen.",
        "Will: The last time I saw you, you were helping someone else.",

        "Carly: A shrink? You think I'm crazy.",
        "Jack: No, I think -- no, honey, I just think the guilt is eating you alive, that's all. And no one should live like that. I want you back, Carly. Promise me you're gonna get help, honey.",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Jack: I'll be right there with you.",
        "Carly: I know. But first, we gotta get Rory back, all right? We have to find Gwen.",

        "Maddie: Okay, getting away from Casey Hughes so totally appeals to me that I am losing my judgment.",
        "Henry: No, you're not. You're losing your wild imagination.",
        "Maddie: Bryon is still creepy.",
        "Henry: I know some real creeps, and this guy at best is an amateur.",
        "Maddie: Oh, come on. Byron shows up here, with this --",
        "Henry: Because you opened the door, remember?",
        "Maddie: Okay, yeah, I got him thinking about Katie again. But he knows now that Katie's not the one that's e-mailing him. And why is he even here, anyway? He uses a fake name and then make's a beeline right to Katie?",
        "Henry: B.J. Green is his legal name.",
        "Maddie: And he's involved with Mike and Katie's life, and he's not owning up to who he really is. It's bizarre, at best. But really, it's just creepy. Mega creepy.",
        "Henry: All right, yeah, it's a little creepy.",
        "Maddie: Ha, see? You're worried, too. You're afraid that he has some weird agenda planned for Katie.",
        "Henry: Actually, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: So, what do you think?",

        "B.J.: Oh. That's pre-Katie.",
        "Mike: Yeah. It feels weird to be in here.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I know what you mean. It feels a little strange. I want to chase the ghosts out.",
        "Mike: Good luck. A lot of people have tried.",
        "B.J.: Yes, yes, a lot of people have tried, but I will succeed with your help. Right? I mean, you know what I need? More than anything, I need a new electrical system to handle all of the equipment I have. Oh, and the realtor was telling me about this great old gazebo out back, and all spifed up? That's gonna be amazing. And the hallway. Did you see the hall? All the paneling out there?",
        "Mike: Yeah?",
        "B.J.: It's just a facade. You know what's under it? It's all deco -- inlaid wood pattern.",
        "Mike: That whole hallway?",
        "B.J.: Yes, the whole hallway. It's probably a little messed up, but you could restore it.",
        "Mike: I could.",
        "B.J.: See what I mean? This is not your average job. I mean, I want to completely renovate this place. Inside and out. You know, bring back to the original, but maybe open it up a little with some windows, bring some light in, but without messing up the original structure. In other words, think big. I want a showplace.",
        "Mike: It could be done. But this is a lot of work.",
        "B.J.: Well, is it the time? Or all the time away from Katie?",
        "Mike: No, it doesn't have anything to do with Katie. I guess I'm just wondering what's up with this?",
        "B.J.: What?",
        "Mike: Well, I mean, I thought you were just coming into town to start up a business, and then move on. This is a major investment.",
        "B.J.: You want to know if I plan to stay in Oakdale for good.",

        "Nurse Thompson: My brother --",
        "Emily: Your brother? The one who needed the money? Please don't worry about him, okay? Don't worry about anyone. We will take care of both of you. Here, this is were you can reach me. Okay? Okay. Oh, Kristin? When you get to where you're going, forget Oakdale. Forget all of us. And now, please God, let me forget you.",

        "Gwen: What did you hear?",
        "Will: Nothing.",
        "Iris: Nothing. Because there was nothing to hear. Okay, all right, yeah, I was with Carly. That's because I was trying to help you with information I had on Carly.",
        "Will: And what was that?",
        "Iris: I got nothing to say to you.",
        "Gwen: No, I tell Will everything. He's the one person I can trust.",
        "Iris: Oh, you think, huh? Well, you helped my Gwennie make a terrible mistake. One that her lawyer and I could barely fix. So if you care about her and you care about that baby, then you make sure she's smart this time. You sit tight, okay? You can talk to Cass as soon as he lands.",
        "Will: What was that?",
        "Gwen: She says they went to the judge and told him about Carly, and he agreed to cut a deal. I can come back to Oakdale, no kidnapping charges, and keep my baby. As long as I live with her. I know, I know, why did I listen for even a minute?",
        "Will: Because there's a one in a million chance it's true.",
        "Gwen: And if it's not? Then she's setting me up. Do you really think she's Carly's spy?",
        "Will: I can't swear to it, they didn't look like best buddies.",
        "Gwen: But you saw them together.",
        "Will: Yeah.",

        "Mike: But you'd take on this house?",
        "B.J.: That's what I do. You read architectural magazines?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "B.J.: You know the Travers house in Big Sur? That's mine.",
        "Mike: You're kidding.",
        "B.J.: Yes. No, I'm not kidding. It's mine. It's one of my proudest moments. As a matter of fact, it was my first magazine cover that had nothing to do with computer chips. I told you, Mike, I love doing this. Do you have any idea what it feels like to find some great, old house and just completeley renovate it, restore it. And do you know that this house will be my -- one, two, three, four, five -- sixth -- sixth major project. And let me tell you something, even if I do leave here in a month, I want this house finished.",
        "Mike: And then you'd flip it?",
        "B.J.: Or maybe I'd keep it. [Mike chuckles] What?",
        "Mike: It must be nice. All that cash.",
        "B.J.: Well, you know, it buys a lot of toys, a lot of freedom. And I enjoy it.",
        "Mike: More power to you.",
        "B.J.: So, you'll take the job?",
        "Mike: B.J., I would love this job.",
        "B.J.: Great, great, that is incredible news. 'Cause I gotta tell you, coming to a new town, the hardest thing is to find a contractor you can trust.",
        "Mike: You've got him.",
        "B.J.: All right, good. I gotta go. You stick around here, though, take a walk around, get a feel for the whole place. And, you know, we'll talk specifics later.",
        "Mike: Great.",
        "B.J.: The realtor said something very important. We have to check out the ceiling. There's something strange going on there. I don't know.",
        "Mike: I'll check it out.",
        "B.J.: Okay. And if you need me, call me on my cell, all right? Or, ah -- better yet, call Henry. He'll put you through to me.",
        "Mike: He'll be a good assistant.",
        "B.J.: Do you think? Do you think he'll really take care of me? Seriously, I want your opinion.",
        "Mike: I wouldn't let him choose your investments.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I know he likes the ponies and five card draw.",
        "Mike: Yeah, but he's smart, and he needs the work and at the end of the day, he is a good guy. Very loyal.",
        "B.J.: Yes, good. That's exactly what I was thinking. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: So what if B.J. is still interested in Katie? So what if he is making a play for her? It's not gonna hurt her or Mike.",
        "Maddie: What if he does mess things up between them? He's a smart guy. Maybe he could do it.",
        "Henry: Katie is a grown woman, she will be fine.",
        "Maddie: You know, I just -- i wish that you said that you took this job so you could keep an eye on him. Protect Katie if she really needed it.",
        "Henry: How do you know that's not what I'm doing, hmm? Anyway, it doesn't matter, because Katie won't ask for help.",
        "Maddie: Unless there really is a shrine in this guy's basement.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. What -- wait, where did this come from? You were the one that wanted to break up the happy couple. Now, are you telling me that you're now a Mike Kasnoff fan?",
        "Maddie: Oh, bite your tongue. I only tried to break them up so you can get back with Katie.",
        "Henry: I know, and it was a sweet gesture, even if it was misguided.",
        "Maddie: And now it's all backfired.",
        "Henry: It hasn't backfired. Anyways, the thought that counts.",
        "Maddie: Mmm.",
        "Henry: Unless -- unless it's an incredibly expensive, incredibly hip new outfit.",
        "Maddie: You didn't.",
        "Henry: Only for you, kitten.",
        "Maddie: Is this a designer outfit?",

        "Maddie: You are the greatest.",
        "Henry: I know, I am, aren't I? But just so that we understand each other. Keep B.J.s secret to ourselves. His identity stays between you and me. Only.",

        "Jennifer: At the beach.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I guess we are.",
        "Jennifer: You know, the very first vacation my mom took us on was to the beach. I don't know why, though, because we couldn't make a move without her warning us about the sun or the undertow or the strangers on the beach. But it's no wonder that will had asthma as a kid. We couldn't breathe. And I swore I would never be like that. But I am. I can feel it. Especially now. You think that's just part of the love?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. [Dusty sighs] Not always. I mean, my father, my real father, the one who raised me, he never crowded me. Because he knew I was wild, he gave me something wilder to tame. He had me training horses.",
        "Jennifer: Keep you out of trouble?",
        "Dusty: I loved it. He did so much for me. Then when he died, John Dixon took me in, and he tried to, you know, make me what he wanted his son to be. But my father, Burke, Burke Donovan, never crowded me, always let me breathe. And he never let me know what it cost him. That's love.",
        "Jennifer: You had a real father who truly loved you.",
        "Dusty: For a while.",
        "Jennifer: That explains a lot. Why you are the way you are. Why someday you'll be -- you just take care of things -- of people. And that's the kind of person that I want to be. The kind of mom.",

Oh, I headed it off, barely. But Jennifer is still convinced that the baby is alive, and Dusty is right there with her. He's even hired a private investigator, Paul. Okay, I'm on my way back to Oakdale to figure out how they got this far -- oh, no. Oh, God. You listen to me. You get on the next plane back to Oakdale. This is about to blow sky high.",
