        "Holden: If either one of you had gone to the police and told them what you suspected --",
        "Lily: We had no evidence, Holden.",
        "Holden: If you had told them, they might've known to look for some.",
        "Lily: Do you think Dusty wanted to get hurt? Winston Mayer almost killed him. If it helps you to be angry at somebody, be angry at the psychopath who wanted to hurt our son just because he's gay.",

        "Holden: Our son is lying in a hospital bed paralyzed. Don't you have anything better to do than stand around and defend Dusty?",
        "Lily: Don't you have anything better to do than to beat him up? How is this helping Luke?",
        "Dusty: I shouldn't have come.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to cause any more trouble. It's the last thing your family needs. If you need anything, you let me know.",
        "Holden: Why don't you just leave us all alone?",
        "Lily: Thank you, thank you. Us, us, us? Is there any us right now, Holden? Our son is going through the most difficult time of his life and you and I are barely speaking. What are we going to do about that?",

        "Katie: I'm ready, but the job is long gone. So you're stuck with me a little while longer.",
        "Brad: You know what? You know, I have thought you were a lot of things, but never a quitter.",

        "Jack: Yeah, I fed them before they left.",
        "Carly: Thank you. I suppose that's why I was dreaming about roast beef. And apple pie?",

        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Acting so damn brave, like you have all the time in the -- I'm sorry. I should let you play this the way you want to play it. It's just that I have a hard time forgetting what's really happening.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack -- things aren't always as tragic as they seem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not quitting anything. Jack and I are just taking a little break for a while. That's all.",
        "Brad: A break? Wait, wait. You guys haven't even been married, what? Not even two weeks?",
        "Katie: I just -- I'm doing what's best for everyone involved, okay?",
        "Brad: Do you think it would be better if I was unemployed?",
        "Katie: Is everything about you?",

        "Dr. Evers: Listen, you sound a little unconvinced about all this. And I don't blame you.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Dr. Evers: If five doctors told me I was dying, I'd have a hard time accepting my word too. Which is why I'd like you to come in for a few more tests.",
        "Carly: More tests? What more could there be to do to me?",
        "Dr. Evers: I want to get some more pictures of the abscess, confirm it's not growing, and see if we can't pinpoint the source of the infection.",
        "Carly: Okay --",
        "Dr. Evers: How you been feeling?",
        "Carly: Better. Better now that I'm not taking medication I don't need.",
        "Dr. Evers: I wish we could've spared you from that discomfort.",
        "Carly: Well -- there are some silver linings, believe it or not.",

        "Dusty: Hey, I pay my taxes and I was here first.",
        "Lucinda: Now wait a minute, I had it first. I just got up for a seventh inning stretch, okay?",
        "Dusty: Well, you don't leave a sign, so you're out of luck. Okay, I'll share. Come on.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll share.",
        "Dusty: What do you got there?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but you can't have a lick of my cone. I need this.",
        "Dusty: It's dripping.",
        "Lucinda: I need it, you know? I need the icy perfection.",
        "Dusty: You just come from the hospital?",
        "Lucinda: No. No, I'm on my way. I just -- I feel so bad. Poor kid -- I mean Luke. He's so young and so many awful things have happened to him.",
        "Dusty: I'm more worried about his mother.",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Dusty: Ask Lily. She needs all the support she can get right now. And she's not getting it from her husband.",
        "Lucinda: Did something happen?",
        "Dusty: Well, why don't you go down to the hospital? Talk to her. She'll tell you everything you need to know. I gotta go. I'll see ya.",

        "Dusty: Whatever.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah? Wait a minute. Holden popped you? Takes a lot to rile Holden.",

        "Katie: Do you want me to have to redo my make-up?",
        "Brad: No, no. I'm sorry. I know you don't want to talk about it. I just want to -- I just want to help you.",
        "Katie: I know. Thanks. Actually, you can do something to help me.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Katie: I didn't do my homework last night. So I was wondering if you could fill me in on the guest today.",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, our first guest is a writer with a best-seller. I didn't read it either.",
        "Katie: Great.",
        "Brad: How could I, its chick lit. And I didn't take this job to stay up all night reading about -- it's a waste of time.",
        "Katie: What's it about?",
        "Brad: How to get back together with your lost love.",

        "Jack: Are you not taking your medicine? Carly, I thought you were going to fight for every possible minute you could get with us.",
        "Carly: Of course I am.",
        "Jack: Listen, I know these pills have some pretty nasty side effects.",
        "Carly: They sure do.",
        "Jack: So what? Have you decided that it's not worth it?",
        "Carly: No. No, I didn't even throw the pills away. The bottle must've fallen off the desk.",
        "Jack: Are you sure?",
        "Carly: Yeah. But now that you've reminded me, I suppose I should be a good patient and take my medicine, right?",
        "Jack: Let me help you. Let me help you, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't want to fight with you. But I don't know how to stop history from repeating itself.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Holden: How many times have we found ourselves sitting at a bedside? Ethan was sick. Faith was sick. You were sick. And I know you think that what I'm saying is that this is all your fault, but that's not what I'm saying.",
        "Lily: What are you saying?",
        "Holden: I just -- I don't want to keep going over the same ground. I'm going to go see Luke.",
        "Lucinda: Darling?",
        "Lily: Oh, Mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: What happened with me and Luke -- it was a mistake. I never should've gone there.",
        "Maddie: It's who you are.",
        "Noah: Well, it's not who I want to be. Look at all the trouble I've caused.",
        "Maddie: It's not your fault. The mistake would've been to deny who you really are.",
        "Noah: I should've just stayed with you. I was happy. You were happy. You were, weren't you?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. But I couldn't be now.",
        "Noah: I should've just joined the army like my dad wanted me to. Then none of this would've happened. Luke would still be okay. And don't tell me that's not true, because you know it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You sure I can't get you something to eat?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Holden: You know, you've got a lot of hard work ahead of you, and you're going to need to keep up your strength.",
        "Luke: Does anybody even think that those exercises are gonna work? The physical therapist didn't even bother to come down here and show me how to do them.",
        "Holden: No, he was here earlier, but you were asleep.",
        "Luke: Look, Dad -- I'm just really tired of getting my hopes up and then having things just turn out like this. I can't do it anymore.",
        "Holden: Luke -- come on, you don't -- you got better before --",
        "Luke: Can you just -- can you just leave me alone, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I could fly in a specialist.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. That won't be necessary. The people here are very good. I think so. Maybe Holden would disagree with me.",
        "Lucinda: Maybe? Maybe? What do you mean? He hasn't expressed an opinion whether or not the care is adequate?",
        "Lily: No, he hasn't. He's too busy blaming me for what happened.",
        "Lucinda: That's ridiculous.",
        "Lily: Uh no, maybe he's right. Maybe I should have come forward sooner about Noah's father.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me, what were you going to say? You don't have any proof.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Lucinda: I mean, you were being a kind, imaginative mother, Darling. You didn't want to rock the boy's boat, you know? Until you had a real reason to. You're a good, good mother.",
        "Lily: Holden doesn't think so. And it wasn't just that. I was trying to prove Dusty's innocence.",
        "Lucinda: Well why not? He is innocent, he was innocent.",
        "Lily: I know, but Holden's just very critical of me about everything these days, and he wonders why I can't tell him the truth.",
        "Lucinda: He's a Snyder, Dear. They're always holier-than-thou. However, he's the man you married, he's the man you love. Right?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes. I just feel like we're caught in this vicious cycle. And Luke is in the middle. And the truth is -- Holden and I both failed Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So why is the doctor calling you?",
        "Carly: He just wants to run some more tests.",
        "Jack: What kind of tests?",
        "Carly: Just scans, I think. Just to be sure to give me the right kind of medicine.",
        "Jack: They haven't figured that out yet?",
        "Carly: What do I -- what do I know, Jack? He wants to run more tests, I'm gonna have more tests.",
        "Jack: Well it's a good thing I stayed then. I'll drive you.",
        "Carly: No!",

        "Guest: Well thank you.",
        "Katie: I really loved it.",
        "Guest: Thank you, Katie. Everyone's had at least one great love, right?",
        "Katie: I think in Brad's case, he's had more than one. What are you, in the triple digits now?",
        "Guest: What about you, Katie?",
        "Brad: Actually, Katie just got married. So anyway, these stories of yours, do you think they could really happen?",
        "Guest: I think you could definitely fall in love with your best friend. You just start talking and laughing together. Sharing the good times and the bad. And it could just happen. You fall in love. And once you give your heart to your best friend, you never get it back.",
        "Katie: Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You can't drive yourself.",
        "Carly: I can take a cab.",
        "Jack: Why would you do that when I'm right here?",
        "Carly: Jack, you need to talk to Katie. You need to go home.",
        "Jack: Carly, I told you -- Katie wants some time apart while this is going on.",
        "Carly: You mean while I'm alive.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen. This is where I need to be right now. More importantly, it's where I want to be. So why don't we go see the doctor and find out what's going on.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Carly: I just need a minute to get dressed.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm really sorry to turn your life upside down like this.",
        "Jack: You have nothing to apologize for. And the last person you should be worried about is me.",
        "Carly: But I am. Just be a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Well I'd like to thank Emily Giffin for being here with us.",
        "Guest: Well thanks so much Brad. It's been a pleasure.",
        "Brad: Absolutely. And please go pick up her book, \"Something Borrowed\" and the sequel \"Something Blue\" and her new best seller \"Baby Proof.\" You'll be glad you did.",

        "Brad: Yeah, well I just thought it would be easier for everyone. You're not mad, are you?",
        "Katie: No. Grateful. Thank you. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Jack: I was just checking on how you were doing.",
        "Katie: I am in the middle of an interview right now. Sorry, I can't talk.",
        "Brad: You're in the middle of an interview?",
        "Katie: Jack and I have said everything we need to say at this point. He kissed her, Brad.",
        "Brad: Jack kissed Carly?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He still has feelings for her. I know -- big surprise. You tried to tell me at least a million times.",
        "Brad: I had ulterior motives.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you were right. If I was honest with myself, I would've seen it all along.",
        "Brad: Jack loves you, Katie.",
        "Katie: Yes. But Carly is the one true love of his life. And even after she's gone, she's still going to have his heart. It'll never really be mine.",

        "Lily: Oh, my mom just went downstairs to get us some.",
        "Holden: You know what, I -- I just need to get out of here, okay?",
        "Burt: One thing we don't want you to do is push yourself too hard, especially not right away.",
        "Luke: Well, seeing that I can't move, I don't really think we have to worry about that.",
        "Burt: It's important to be consistent with your therapy, even if you don't feel you're making much progress at first.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm not going to make any progress. You know that, I know that. Besides, I can't even start right now. I'm still too tired from the surgery.",
        "Burt: Okay, I'll let you get a few hours rest. But I'll be back.",
        "Lily: That was fast.",

        "Noah: It's too late.",
        "Maddie: No, it's not. Don't you think he wants to see you?",
        "Noah: Why would he? My dad's the reason he's lying in a hospital bed right now.",
        "Maddie: Okay, so you think that you're being punished is that it?",
        "Noah: Maybe.",
        "Maddie: You think Luke's being punished?",
        "Noah: No! No, of course not.",
        "Maddie: Pretending that you're straight isn't going to make Luke feel better. It's not going to make you feel better. Or me.",

        "Luke: Yeah, look how that turned out. Look Mom, I know you made so many sacrifices for me, and I thank you. But there's nothing you can do for me right now. There's nothing anyone can do for me right now.",
        "Lily: There is something that you can do.",
        "Luke: That physical therapy is not going to work.",
        "Lily: How do you know that?",
        "Luke: Because -- I mean, I knew -- I knew that things with me and Noah weren't going to work. I tried to keep convincing myself -- it's just so stupid.",

        "Holden: She knew that Colonel Mayer might have murdered his wife. And for some reason, she didn't tell me about it. When she was at the police station, she didn't tell Margo about it. Why, Lucinda? You're a smart woman. Does that make any sense to you? Prayers at night, you'd bless everyone. The bees, the trees, the guy who ran the vegetable stand. But never yourself. I hope you can forgive me. Because I'm having a very, very hard time forgiving myself for what's happened to you.",
        "Lucinda: You absolutely right. The whole thing is senseless, what happened to Luke. But surely, Lily has tried to explain the choices that she made. Why can't you try to put yourself in her shoes?",
