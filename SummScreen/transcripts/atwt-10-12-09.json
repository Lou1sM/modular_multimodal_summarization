        "Katie and Brad save Vienna from a fire at Al's while Henry is bedding Barbara to get the James inheritance. Ralph makes a cryptic reference about Henry to Audrey. Dusty is very unhappy to see Ralph in town and makes sure he says his peace about their past dealings and what is to come, which infuriates Teri, who races to her uncle's defense. Rosanna and Craig fight their attraction while working with Parker on his ad campaign. However, when Johnny makes a comment about having another sleep over with Rosanna and Craig, they are tripping over one another to downplay and explain it away, but Parker is left wondering what is going on. Katie finally reaches Henry to tell him what happened to Vienna and Henry races from Barbara's side to Vienna's. Barbara is quite pleased with herself for falling into bed with a younger man. Henry is overwhelmed with guilt and worry, but he faces Katie's questions and accusations when she tells him that she knows where he was. Henry tells her the whole story and Katie, who is in shock at first, recovers and then wonders what plan he has up his sleeve. Dusty, who is waiting for Bonnie so they can leave on a short vacation, has another run in with Teri, who again tells Dusty how much she dislikes him. Bonnie knows Teri, which surprises Dusty. Later, Bonnie tells Dusty she assumes her is going to tell her what is going on. Dusty asks her to be put on retainer and alludes to it being regarding a businessman from Chicago. Audrey assures Ralph that Henry will get him the money that he is owed; he doesn't need to hurt anyone. Henry wants to unburden his guilt by letting Vienna in on what is going on, but Audrey reminds him what he has to lose. Barbara comes looking for Henry right after he comes home with Vienna; she plays coy and reminds him that he knows where to find him. Parker interrupts a passionate moment between Rosanna and Craig and is furious. He gives them both a piece of his mind about what they are doing to his mom and Craig tries to talk with him to remind him that going to his mom about this would only hurt her recovery. Parker agrees to not say anything if Craig stays away from Rosanna. Rosanna and Craig admit how much they can't stop thinking about each other, but Craig explains that he agreed to stay away from her so Parker wouldn't talk with Carly. They share an emotional goodbye. Henry goes to see Barbara and tells her the truth about why he had sex with her and how much danger he and Vienna are in; he pleads with her to give him the money, and it looks like Barbara is empathetic before she closes the door in his face."

        "Audrey: No. I just thought maybe you'd be freaking out about Henry and those payments because, well, he isn't dragging his feet, Ralph. I swear. Henry's -- Ralph.",
        "Ralph: Audrey, listen to me. Your son is young and easily distracted, but as soon as somebody lights a fire under him, he's really gonna hop to it and get his priorities straight.",
        "Teri: Oh, whoa. Excuse me.",
        "Ralph: Whoa. Whoa. Is that what I think it is?",

        "Parker: It is, isn't it? Can you use that?",
        "Craig: You know what? I think we can. Tell you what, I'm gonna get another pizza. At this rate, if we pull an all-nighter, we'll have all these ideas worked out by morning.",

        "Henry: I'm sorry?",
        "Katie: There's been a fire. Vienna's hurt. There was so much smoke. I tried. I really tried, but we have to go to the hospital.",
        "Henry: Wait, Katie. Katie, what happened to Vienna? Katie? Katie? Katie?",
        "Barbara: This is not the way I usually close a negotiation, Henry.",

        "Barbara: Would you like to tell me what's going on here or shall I guess?",
        "Henry: Look, Katie is not an alarmist, okay? I've heard Vienna's hurt, hospital, fire. How much more explanation do you need?",
        "Barbara: You know, I wasn't born yesterday.",
        "Henry: Whatever it is you're thinking, Barbara, I don't have time for it.",
        "Barbara: Tell me, Henry, how long did you tell Katie to take before she called you with an emergency?",
        "Henry: Barbara, this isn't about you, okay? This isn't about you, this isn't about this, this isn't about me and the money. This is about Vienna, and if anything happened to her while I was here with you --",

        "Paramedic: Hey, Doc. We've had her on high flow o2, and she's awake and alert. No visible burns. B.P.'S 136 over 70, and her respirations are stable.",
        "Doctor: Take her to two and check C.O. levels for me.",

        "Brad: I want you checked out.",
        "Katie: But I'm okay.",
        "Brad: Will you -- please just don't argue with me? I mean, obviously you can tell that she's pregnant. I just want to make sure that she's okay.",

        "Brad: Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for yelling at you.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry that you're worried about me.",
        "Brad: I still am.",
        "Katie: I know, and I love you for that. The EMT said that Vienna was alert. That's good, right?",

        "Ralph: Something wrong?",
        "Audrey: No, not at all. Nothing's wrong. But, you know, if I were you, I would probably ask myself that question.",
        "Ralph: Why is that?",
        "Audrey: Guy at the bar. If looks could kill, Ralph, you'd be dead.",
        "Teri: Hey, do you know him, Uncle Ralph?",
        "Ralph: Never seen him before in my life.",
        "Teri: Whoa. He's coming over here. Uncle Ralph.",
        "Dusty: Looks good.",
        "Teri: Whoa, hey. Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Dusty: Relax. It's okay. Sharing his dessert is the least the old man can do for me.",
        "Teri: Who the hell are you?",
        "Dusty: We used to be in business together, right, Ralph? You've gotten better at sharing. You and your buddies weren't so good about that back in Chicago, were you?",

        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Parker: Johnny, that was very good. What were you saying about a sleepover earlier?",
        "Craig: Oh. Oh, that. That was the other night when he fell and hit his head.",
        "Rosanna: He had a concussion.",
        "Craig: Yeah. So, we made a game out of the whole thing.",
        "Rosanna: And we stayed up all night. It was an all-nighter!",
        "Craig: An all-nighter, right. Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: You know what? Johnny, this is so great. You worked so hard. We're so proud of you. You deserve a reward. How about some ice cream?",
        "Johnny: Rainbow sprinkles!",
        "Craig: You know what? Double. Hey, Parker, would you take him?",

        "Rosanna: No, he knows. \"Another sleepover,\" Craig?",
        "Craig: It was Johnny rambling. Johnny's a kid. Kids ramble. It went right over Parker's head.",
        "Rosanna: No, it didn't! He asked! He asked for further clarification!",
        "Craig: But he didn't get any. Now, please, just calm down, okay?",
        "Rosanna: No. Unh-unh. No. Okay, look, I'm not doing this. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Why'd you call that night a sleepover, Johnny, if nobody actually went to sleep?",
        "Johnny: Is there really a man in the moon, Parker?",
        "Parker: No. No, there isn't, Johnny. It's all in your head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Excuse me. Vienna Hyatt, she was hurt in a fire?",
        "Doctor: Are you family?",
        "Henry: Yeah. No, I'm not. She's my girl, okay? Please, please. Oh, my God. Is she gonna be okay?",
        "Doctor: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. She means the world to me. She really does. Um -- my friend called me, Katie. Katie Snyder.",
        "Doctor: Yeah, she's right across the hall. We're just checking her out.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Brad: She inhaled a lot of smoke.",
        "Katie: Brad.",
        "Brad: The doctor said that people are gonna get a fetal heart monitor in here to make sure that the baby was okay. Today would be nice.",
        "Katie: Brad. I'm sorry. He's just very nervous.",
        "Nurse: I'll get a doctor in here, but you're fine, and lucky to have him.",
        "Katie: I am lucky to have you, but you're a wreck. I need you to calm down, please.",
        "Brad: I'm just really glad that you called for help.",
        "Katie: Me too. I just hope it got there in time. `",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I can't believe they don't know what started the fire. I mean, accidents happen, sure, but this is -- this is different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: The lakeshore redevelopment project. I raised the money. Your people signed on to build it. Very ambitious project. People looked forward to it. Then this crazy thing happened. All the money I raised just suddenly disappeared.",
        "Ralph: Well, that's a shame. I'll bet you took a lot of heat for that.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah. Mostly from your people.",
        "Ralph: My people.",
        "Dusty: The ones who are supposed to make sure people like me don't make trouble. Anyway, by the time I got my cast off -- well, let's just say nobody could ever find the fake stationery you guys used to make it look legit.",
        "Ralph: Listen, buddy, I'm sorry that the redevelopment project didn't work out for you, but that kind of thing, it happens all the time.",
        "Dusty: When there's money and muscle, right?",
        "Teri: Hey, that's enough.",
        "Dusty: I understand. You're sticking up for family. I don't know you, Theresa, but your uncle's got one thing right. You sure can cook.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Oh, you can give these to Ms. Hyatt yourself.",
        "Henry: Excuse me?",
        "Nurse: I assumed they were from you.",
        "Henry: \"The circle of life is a beautiful thing. Don't break it.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Come on. We didn't plan this.",
        "Rosanna: I know we didn't plan it, but we did it and we're doing it.",
        "Craig: You know, this isn't a game for me.",
        "Rosanna: Carly is in rehab, okay, and we're --",
        "Craig: And we're figuring it out.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, we're figuring it out by sleeping together?",
        "Craig: I thought we were okay with this.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not okay with this. I'm sleeping with my sister's fianc\u00e9.",
        "Craig: All right. You know, you got really spooked out there before with the kid.",
        "Rosanna: Spooked?! I felt like the whore of Babylon in front of a teenager and a kid!",
        "Craig: Again, they don't know anything. Rosanna, it's your guilt talking to you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it is. It's my guilt. I'm guilty. Sue me. What does your guilt say?",
        "Craig: Oh, you don't want to know.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I want to know. Trust me.",
        "Craig: It says I'm the man that everyone thinks I am. A conniver, a liar, a cheater. And then I remember the smell of your hair. And even after everything that's happened, all I can think about is being with you. And I know what that says about me.",
        "Rosanna: It says the same thing about me.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, if you don't want this to ever happen again, you're gonna have to tell me right now. Is that what you want?",
        "Parker: Oh, okay. I see how it's gonna go.",
        "Craig: Where's Johnny?",
        "Parker: He's upstairs eating his ice cream. Good thing, huh?",
        "Rosanna: Parker, I can explain.",
        "Parker: Explain? Really? You know, I knew it. The second that Johnny said that thing about you guys having a sleepover, I knew it, but I told myself that there's no way. It's not possible. Not my mom's sister. Not even you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Okay. Parker, we're gonna calm down. We're gonna sit down, and we're gonna talk this out.",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah. Like that's gonna happen.",
        "Craig: Parker, you need to understand.",
        "Parker: Understand how you two sent my mom away so that you could hook up?",
        "Rosanna: No, no! That didn't happen. You know that's not true.",
        "Parker: Have you guys been doing it the entire time that she's been at that clinic?",
        "Craig: No, no!",
        "Parker: Oh, great! So this is really hot and new for you guys right now? That's great!",
        "Craig: Parker, Parker. I know you're upset, but you will not disrespect your aunt.",
        "Parker: I stood up for you to my dad!",
        "Craig: I know you did, and I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: Good, now get the hell out of my house!",
        "Rosanna: Parker, this is not just Craig's fault, okay? He's not the only one to blame.",
        "Parker: Oh, I know. Believe me.",
        "Rosanna: So what are you gonna do? You gonna throw me out, too?",
        "Parker: I probably should. Who would do this to their own sister?",
        "Rosanna: I'm so sorry, Parker.",
        "Parker: And who would do this to someone that's killing themselves to get better for them? What are you guys gonna do about my mom? I guess I knew that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audrey: Oh, Henry. I am just beside myself. You know, I talked to Ralph, and he seemed deadly calm, which made me very nervous. So, then I decided I needed to take a walk, so I walked by Al's and I saw the fire trucks, and then I heard that Vienna was taken away in a gurney, and then I saw Katie and I saw Brad and I didn't know what to do, so I -- I brought chocolates. Will that help? Son, please speak to me. Henry? Oh, no. Oh. I -- I thought you and Ralph sort of had an understanding.",
        "Henry: What I understand is that all of this is your fault.",
        "Audrey: Okay. Okay, look. I know that you need to place blame, and that's okay. I get that. But, hey, at least nobody was seriously hurt. Come on. Mmm. Have a chocolate, but don't eat the truffles.",
        "Henry: I don't want a chocolate. I want your little friend Ralph out of my life, okay?",
        "Audrey: Yeah, but it's a little late to the fair on that one, cookie. So, how's it going with Barbara?",
        "Henry: I was with Barbara when the fire started, and that is why Vienna is in the E.R. right now with an oxygen mask on her face and two charred lungs to boot. I can't -- I can't -- I can't do this.",
        "Audrey: Wait, wait, wait! Can't do what? Can't do what?",
        "Henry: I can't keep on lying to a woman that means more to me than my own life.",
        "Audrey: Oh, no, no, no, no. You're saying you have a case of the guilts?",
        "Henry: Yeah, Mother, that's what I'm saying. Yes.",
        "Audrey: What? So it's gonna make it all better if you just confess?",
        "Henry: No, but lying and playing like some kind of male escort is not really that fun, okay?",
        "Audrey: Okay. So what are you gonna do, just waltz in to Vienna's hospital room and tell her everything?",
        "Henry: Yes!",
        "Audrey: Oh, boy. That is just beautiful. Classic male idiocy.",
        "Henry: You're the one who told me to do this in the first place!",
        "Audrey: Yeah, but you're the one who did! You actually did it! So, now you're feeling so terrible about it and you have guilt and you want to unburden your soul? Oh, classic. It's also stupid, and you have no idea. It never, ever, ever works. So, what are you gonna do? You're gonna tell her so you feel better, right? And then Vienna will hate you for the rest of your life while you feel better for ten seconds.",
        "Henry: Crap!",
        "Audrey: Yeah, and then some. And don't forget, you know what, this little thing of telling Vienna the truth may hurt her a lot more than just a broken heart.",
        "Henry: Meaning?",
        "Audrey: Meaning, Ralph -- if Ralph knows that someone else is knowing who he is, then -- you get my drift?",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Audrey: Look. You know, son, I'm just saying, that's all.",

        "Teri: What kitchen runs out of fennel in the middle of a dinner rush?",
        "Ralph: You had a run on fennel? Really?",
        "Teri: No. Just means really poor planning. Now I have to go to the green market before they close.",
        "Ralph: No, no, you don't. Now just stop it, and stop blaming your mood on a fennel shortage. That's so silly. You know very well that that Donovan character, he's the one that got you madder than he got me.",
        "Teri: He is awful. It's just that, like, machismo, macho strut, those slurs. That's what that was, Uncle Ralph.",
        "Ralph: Water off my back. Here's a guy that's walking around with so much anger that he's jealous of everything that he sees that he doesn't have. He's jealous of my success. He's jealous of my beautiful niece. He's jealous of absolutely everything, and the best he can throw at me is that I'm a crook?",
        "Teri: He's so wrong.",
        "Ralph: But it's meaningless. You really need to believe that, Teri. What isn't meaningless is you and me and Janet and Liberty. A la famiglia.",
        "Teri: A la famiglia. But I don't care what that creep says. You're still the best man that I know.",

        "Bonnie: What are you doing here? I was just on my way to Metro to meet you. What? Are you mad at me because I'm late?",
        "Dusty: No, no. No. I'm sorry. It's not you. I just needed some air.",
        "Bonnie: Should I ask?",
        "Dusty: Here.",
        "Bonnie: You're sending me out to buy a pack of gum?",
        "Dusty: Consider that your retainer.",
        "Bonnie: You're hiring me. Dusty, what happened tonight? Did you get in to some sort of fight or something?",
        "Dusty: Did you ever hear the name Ralph Manzo?",
        "Bonnie: I think so. Why?",
        "Dusty: What did you hear about him?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. He's, um, in construction in Chicago or something.",
        "Dusty: He's a big-time crook.",
        "Bonnie: Okay.",
        "Dusty: I want to nail him.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you're gonna need a cop, not a lawyer.",
        "Dusty: No, I don't think so.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. What aren't you telling me, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Let's just say I have unfinished business with the guy. I never said I was a saint.",
        "Bonnie: I never said I wanted one. Listen, I've got an idea.",
        "Dusty: I like your ideas.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. I think that you need more than dinner. You need more than that. I'm thinking that you need a long vacation away from here for a while. So, do you think you can put this Manzo thing away for a few days?",
        "Dusty: How fast can you pack?",

        "Katie: No, thanks to Brad. He's the one that carried her out.",
        "Henry: Okay. Well, I'll thank him later. Are you -- are you okay? Is the baby okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, fine.",
        "Henry: Thank God.",
        "Katie: It was scary as hell, though, Henry.",
        "Henry: I can't imagine. I'm so sorry, Katie. I'm sure this fire was an accident, but if it's not, I want to get to the bottom of it. I promise you that. I'm really relieved that you and the baby are okay.",
        "Katie: Oh, give me a break, Henry. Get back here. I know where you were tonight. Have you gone mad?",
        "Katie: \"The circle of life\"?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. That's Ralph's colorful euphemism for \"Money laundering.\"",
        "Katie: Translate, please.",
        "Henry: \"The circle.\" I give him money for his \"Charity,\" and then he distributes that money to his people, all illegal, of course.",
        "Katie: Naturally.",
        "Henry: Then he makes a profit, and he funnels the money back to me through Metro. I think in Ralph's book it's called \"Symmetry.\"",
        "Katie: No. In his book it's called \"Dollar signs.\" So, Barbara's involvement in all of this?",
        "Henry: There's a whole mess with the estate. She's frozen the cash flow from it.",
        "Katie: So your solution was to unfreeze Barbara?",
        "Henry: No, no. No. I never would have come up with that idea.",
        "Katie: Who did?",
        "Henry: My mother.",
        "Katie: Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew!",
        "Henry: You don't know the half of it.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: It's the biggest disaster ever, okay? First of all, I did something that I never in my life would have thought dictated by my completely out-of- control mother, whose is who thing is I don't even know if Barbara's gonna release the money so I can pay Ralph and get him to stop following us.",
        "Katie: This is ridiculous.",
        "Henry: It's true!",
        "Katie: No. I mean this whole \"Woe is me\" act you're pulling here. So you made a couple bad choices that led to something really bad almost happening, but listen, you're still here. Vienna's okay. Where's your plan \"B\"? You're smarter than this.",
        "Henry: I'm having sex with someone so that I can get my evil father's money. Is there a lower floor?",
        "Brad: Hey, Henry. How's Vienna?",
        "Henry: I think she's gonna be fine, and I heard what you did, and I really owe you one, buddy.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, okay. I'm just glad everybody's okay. I saw the doctor, okay. He showed me the test results. He said to get you home to bed.",
        "Katie: Good. I want to go. Oh, Henry, listen, please tell Vienna that I love her and I'll call her tomorrow.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm just glad you and the baby are okay.",
        "Brad: We all got lucky today.",

        "Dusty: Are you stalking me? Nice cover, by the way.",
        "Teri: Cover?",

        "Teri: You are so miserable, it's actually amazing.",
        "Dusty: What do you do with all that fennel? It's kind of a weird herb to be stocking up on, isn't it?",
        "Teri: What are you doing loitering outside of a woman's of dress shop, Mr. Donovan?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm outside the dress shop -- I prefer Dusty, by the way. Because my new girlfriend's there buying a new dress for our weekend out of town.",
        "Teri: That's great. You're going away? That's a really great idea.",
        "Dusty: I can tell that you really love your uncle.",
        "Teri: And I can tell that you are a real jackass.",
        "Dusty: Well, my approach may be a little out there, but the facts are real.",
        "Teri: You want facts, Mr. Donovan? My uncle is like a surrogate father to me. He has always taken care of me, and he's never ask for anything in return.",
        "Dusty: Yet.",
        "Teri: No. See, you're wrong again. I'm a chef because of him, because he told me I could be whatever I wanted. He's the rock that I lean on. And, you know, I don't take too well to people who accuse him of things that he would never, ever do, especially when those people look like their picture's in the dictionary under \"Con artist.\"",
        "Dusty: Theresa.",
        "Teri: Whoa, don't. Don't call me that. Actually, don't call me anything, and don't call my restaurant again and make a reservation. Is that clear?",

        "Parker: Bite me.",
        "Craig: Okay. I want to talk to you like an adult about this, Parker, but that's not a very good start.",
        "Parker: And I want you to get out of here.",
        "Craig: Will it change anything?",
        "Parker: Yeah, it'll change the chances of me walking in to my kitchen to find you making out with my aunt!",
        "Craig: But you did see it, and now we have to deal with it.",
        "Parker: Tell me something, Craig. What was this? Was it love? Lust? A supposed accident? I mean, were you not looking for it, it just happened?",
        "Craig: Look, I'm not gonna talk to you about it if all you're gonna do is jump to conclusions.",
        "Parker: Do you love Rosanna?",
        "Craig: I have no idea what this is, and neither does she, but she's worried. She's worried you're gonna make the biggest mistake by pulling your mother into this.",
        "Parker: Of course she is!",
        "Craig: No. It's not about being found out. It's about Carly's recovery. Now, you may not want to believe it, Parker, but it's the truth. The worst thing you could do would be to call her right now or go over there first thing in the morning and dump this on her. It wouldn't do anything to help her. For the record, you're right. We didn't go looking for this. It did just happen, and neither one of us are feeling lighthearted about it right now.",
        "Parker: Well, what am I supposed to do now that I know about this?",
        "Craig: I'm sorry you know n about it, and I'm sorry about the way you saw it. And now that you do know, I'm gonna ask you to back off and let us figure out the next step.",
        "Parker: This affects me and J.J., Sage, and Johnny.",
        "Craig: I know. But the next step, the next thing to do, that is completely between me and Rosanna.",
        "Parker: I'll back off.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Parker. Thank you.",
        "Parker: If you do, too.",
        "Craig: Excuse me?",

        "Katie: Oh, that feels good. Ah, yeah. I guess I'll have to remember to bend my knees the next time I'm trying to pull an unconscious woman from a burning building. Oh, it's too close. I'm sorry. You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: I just can't shake it. I will. I just haven't yet. I wonder, how'd it start?",
        "Katie: I bet it was a grease fire. That's why there was so much smoke.",
        "Brad: Well, whatever it was, I want the fire marshal to deal with it.",
        "Katie: I'm sure he will.",
        "Brad: You know, Henry needs to be more on top of things. I don't want something like this to ever happen again.",

        "Henry: Are you hungry? Do you want me to order in or go out and get you something?",
        "Vienna: You know, I'm really fine, Henry. I mean it. Yes, it was scary at first, but its over, and I'm okay.",
        "Henry: It could have been a lot worse.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but it wasn't. So, please, let's not dwell on this. I mean, in the big scheme of things, it wasn't so terrible.",
        "Henry: It was a lot worse than you think it was. Anyway, if Brad and Katie hadn't been there to help you, I don't -- I don't want to think about it.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on. Please stop feeling guilty that you weren't there, okay?",
        "Henry: Vienna, you know that I love you, right?",
        "Vienna: I'm pretty clear about that, and I love you, too. So much. Okay?",

        "Barbara: No reason for snark, Henry.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry. It's just its a little noisy up here right now, okay?",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's all right. Now, you tend to your patient, and then we have one more thing we have to deal with.",
        "Henry: Just one?",

        "Dusty: You got to be kidding me.",
        "Teri: Gross. Um, we met at Metro, and he was a total jerk.",
        "Bonnie: It's been known to happen, but you know what? He happens to be my jerk, so maybe we should get out of here?",

        "Henry: Yeah, I do. That's what I'm trying to say, okay? I'm madly in love with Vienna, madly in love. In fact, we have incredibly satisfying sex, as well. Vienna, she's -- she's everything to me.",

Please give me access to the inheritance or our lives are over. We are done, dead, literally.",

        "Henry: And I know it's not the normal way for people, at least not me, to go about making new friends, but I am begging you, Barbara. Please, I am begging you. No please, please let me have that inheritance. Please let me have it so I can get out of this incredibly dangerous mess that I got myself into.",
