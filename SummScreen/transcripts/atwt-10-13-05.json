        "Maddie: Wow. So this is the place that B.J., A.K.A. Byron, A.K.A. Geek man, just bought, huh?",
        "Henry: You are in the presence of immense wealth. Show some respect, hmm?",
        "Maddie: Bet I could fit my room at the Hughes' right in one of those closets over there. So when does he move in?",
        "Henry: When the renovations are done.",
        "Maddie: What renovations?",
        "Henry: I don't know, maybe he wants to put big wall-screen tvs everywhere so he can watch Katie busting butts from every place in the house.",
        "Maddie: You were the one that told me that he's not obsessed with her anymore.",
        "Henry: I'm just giving the man the benefit of the doubt. So, why don't you pick out a room?",
        "Maddie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean a room that you would like. I'm serious. I'm in B.J.'s good graces for the moment. He seems to like me. So I play my cards right, maybe we can wangle a wing for the help, I.E. you and me.",
        "Maddie: Money is getting to your head, bro.",
        "Henry: Eh.",
        "Maddie: You know what? I like it, I do. Oof! Henry! Henry, come quick!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I can't believe it. Nobody has seen anything, not the bartender, not the waiters.",
        "Dusty: Everybody's in their own world around here. Must be the heat.",
        "Jennifer: So, what are we supposed to do?",
        "Dusty: I guess we gotta trust that this P.I. is gonna find Nurse Thompson.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but what if he can't because if she's scared, she's not gonna make this easy.",
        "Dusty: If she's scared, it means she's got something to hide. That's why she quit her job in the middle of the night and came to Tampa. Something weird is going on.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, like switching a baby. Which means that we --",
        "Dusty: It means that the odds that Rory is your son just went up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey, Paul, it's me. We just landed in Oakdale. They're about to let us off the plane. I just wanted to let you to know that I was able to stall things in Tampa. I think I kept our favorite nurse from saying anything to Jennifer and Dusty, at least for now. But I'm telling you, they are determined to get answers, so I guess it's safe to say your sister lied to us about coming to terms with the death of the baby. She's looking, and Dusty is right there with her, so my next stop is Meg Snyder. I gotta find out how much she knows. And I'll try my hardest to keep her at bay, but I'm telling you, I don't know how much longer I can keep Dusty and Jennifer from getting to the truth. Where are you, Paul? Come home, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Eli? Hi.",
        "Eli: Oh, hey, Meg. I wish you'd called. I'm rushing off to a meeting.",
        "Meg: Well, I won't keep you. I was wondering if you were able to run that DNA test on the hair strands I gave you.",
        "Eli: Yes, I did it this morning.",
        "Meg: So? Am I right? Does it belong to the mother of the baby who survived that night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Okay, I think we've got everything. You ready?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. You're the one who keeps saying that we have a plan, and we don't have one.",
        "Will: We'll find a new place to stay. We can even stay in the park if we have to.",
        "Gwen: Great. Now we really are homeless. Aren't you glad you came along?",
        "Will: Yeah, I am. Absolutely.",
        "Gwen: Me, too.",
        "Will: So let's get out of here before your mom comes back.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe I ever trusted her.",
        "Will: Let it go, all right. You're not going to make that mistake again.",
        "Gwen: For sure. All right, let's go. Come one. [Baby crying] Great, hey. Come on, Billy. It's okay. Don't cry, man.",
        "Will: Think maybe he's hungry?",
        "Gwen: No, I just fed him.",
        "Will: Well, I guess he's not too happy about the idea of sleeping in the park.",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Gwen: Yeah, who would be?",
        "Will: Maybe he'll calm down after we get going.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I think so, but what if he doesn't? There's nothing like a crying baby to draw attention to yourself as you walk down the street. What are we going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If you think that I'm going to fall for any more of your blackmail, you can forget it.",
        "Iris: Hey, what's fair is fair, Carly. You want me to show you where Gwen and the baby are? Then you gotta make it worth my while.",
        "Jack: What do you want, Iris?",
        "Iris: I want half that kid's trust fund. You promise me that, I'll take you right to him.",
        "Jack: So, basically you're telling us that you'll sell us back our baby?",
        "Iris: And who are you to suddenly go moral on me? You're a little fast and loose with the legalities yourself, Detective, 'cause you were trying to protect little blondie here.",
        "Jack: You really think it's a good idea to push me right now, lady?",
        "Iris: Oh, yeah, like you didn't pressure that vendor to change his story? He knew damn well that Carly put something in Gwen's water bottle, but he talks to you, and suddenly he's got amnesia.",
        "Carly: Nobody can prove that ever happened.",
        "Iris: Oh, yeah, and you're a little angel who's never done anything bad, right? Except for that one little thing --",
        "Jack: We're not talking about ancient history. We're talking about right now. We're talking about Rory. Tell us where they are, or I'll throw you in jail.",
        "Iris: Oh, no you won't, because you know you'll never see your kid again, right? And I'm right about that. I'm your only hope. And time is running out, so let's make a deal, or I'm history and so is your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "Gwen: He doesn't need his diaper changed. Maybe he is still hungry. Could you hand me the bottle in that bag?",
        "Will: Do you want me to warm it up?",
        "Gwen: No, that'll take too long. I don't want to be here any longer than we have to be. My mom could be on her way back. I can't believe I let her suck me in.",
        "Will: I can't believe she's your mother. No wonder you wanted to get away from her. You don't think she could end up here with the cops, do you?",
        "Gwen: No, not unless there's something in it for her, and I can't see anything in handing us in.",
        "Will: Reward money, maybe?",
        "Gwen: I never thought about that. Let's get out of here.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I think we would move faster if we split up.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: No, you go take the carriage that's loaded with all the stuff. It will be less obvious if we travel separately.",
        "Will: I don't feel right about leaving you alone.",
        "Gwen: Look, Will, it makes more sense. You go find someplace in the park for us to hang out, then come back and get us.",
        "Will: I don't know, Gwen. I think we should stick together.",
        "Gwen: Look, Will, it's only for a little while. I gotta feed him. I'm not gonna run, if that's what you think. You're all I have left. Go.",
        "Will: Okay, all right, if you're sure.",
        "Gwen: See you in 20 minutes. We're almost out of this, little guy. I'm taking care of it, see? I'll handle it. We're gonna be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I -- I don't have your answer yet, Meg. I'm sorry. I ran the test on the hair, but I still have to compare it with the DNA of the child.",
        "Meg: Well, can't you get your hands on the baby's paternity test results? I mean, I could probably get them if it's a problem.",
        "Eli: It's not that. You told me this was supposed to be on the qt, and I can only run the test when there's no one in the lab.",
        "Meg: Well, I appreciate your discretion.",
        "Eli: The thing is, it's been crazy busy down there this week. But I'll get to it tonight, I promise.",
        "Meg: Look, I don't mean to put you on the spot, Eli. I know you're doing me a hell of a favor here. Just take care of it as soon as you feel you can, okay?",
        "Eli: I'll call you the minute I know something.",
        "Meg: Thank you. This means a lot to me.",
        "Eli: Yeah, I can tell.",
        "Emily: Hey, what a coincidence. Do you got a minute?",
        "Meg: Uh, actually, no. I have to get back to work. We're short staffed today.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. It will only take a minute, I promise.",
        "Meg: I really need to get back to work.",
        "Emily: Meg, Meg, I just -- I need to ask you one question, about Jennifer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Um, I'll just have a sparkling water.",
        "Dusty: Same for me.",
        "Jennifer: You don't want a drink?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm fine.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not.",
        "Dusty: We just hit a snag, that's all. It's frustrating as hell, I know. Nurse Thompson's hiding something. We just got to find some proof.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but how are we gonna do that?",
        "Dusty: I'm working on it, Jenny. In the meantime, we've got to cheer you up.",
        "Jennifer: Good luck.",
        "Dusty: I've got something in mind. You'll love it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Mike? Hey, Mike, can you hear me? It's me, Henry. Hey, hey, come on, big guy. Come on, come on, come on, open your eyes. Let me know you're all right. Come on.",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God, he's dead!",
        "Henry: He wouldn't be breathing if he was dead, Maddie. [Mike groans] He wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be moaning either. Or opening his eyes! That's it! Oh, be careful! Oh, that's it, big guy!",
        "Mike: What happened?",
        "Henry: That's what we'd like to know. Maddie came in here, found you laid out on the ground. What's going on?",
        "Mike: Did you just slap me?",
        "Henry: Yeah -- I was trying to save your life though.",
        "Mike: Oh, thanks.",
        "Maddie: I don't think you should move. You could have internal injuries.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, the only thing that hurts is my head, and my face.",
        "Maddie: I wouldn't be too sure. I had a first aid class last summer, and they said --",
        "Mike: Maddie, I'm okay.",
        "Maddie: Fine. Excuse me for caring.",
        "Henry: Listen, do you think you could stand up? Easily?",
        "Mike: Think so.",
        "Henry: There. Oh! That's it.",
        "Mike: I'm all right.",
        "Henry: Yeah? What happened?",
        "Mike: I guess that beam decided it didn't like me.",
        "Henry: Oh, maybe it's because you're trespassing.",
        "Mike: No, I'm not, but aren't you?",
        "Henry: No, B.J. bought the place.",
        "Mike: I know.",
        "Henry: He wanted me to come around here and check up on the renovations -- what do you mean you know?",
        "Mike: I'm the guy doing the renovations.",
        "Maddie: Why would he ask you to do --?",
        "Henry: Why don't you can it, Sherlock, all right? Hey, that's great. This guy is hiring you left and right.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I think he's just doing it to impress Katie, but you know, I'm not gonna turn down a monster paycheck.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. Who would?",
        "Maddie: So what, the beam just fell and knocked you out or --?",
        "Mike: It looked kind of funky, so I went to check it out, and it just fell and hit me.",
        "Henry: Wow, you are -- you are lucky, my man. I tell you, three inches to the left and you would have been --",
        "Maddie: -- Dead.",
        "Mike: No, it's gonna take a lot more than a beam falling on me to get me out of the picture. All right, you know what? I'm just gonna go clean up a little bit.",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure. You want -- you want any help there?",
        "Mike: No, I'm okay. I'm all right. Oh, man. Henry?",
        "Henry: Yeah, Mike, yeah?",
        "Mike: Everything's black. I --",
        "Maddie: Really?",
        "Mike: No. [Mike laughs] Seriously, I'm okay, man. Thank you guys for showing up when you did.",
        "Maddie: See?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: B.J. is crazy. I knew it.",
        "Henry: What are you talking about?",
        "Maddie: It's obvious. He just tried to murder your old pal Mike.",
        "Henry: You cannot be serious.",
        "Maddie: I am as serious as a heart attack. Come on, it makes sense. B.J. wants Mike out of the picture so he can just zoom in on Katie without any competition. That's why he hired the guy to renovate his house. You know, he loosens a few things here, jiggles things over here -- boom. Contractor bites the dust. Mike got lucky. This time.",
        "Henry: Stop, stop, stop it, stop it. The guy -- B.J. is a computer nerd, okay? He is a nobody who found a way to buy himself an interesting personality. He is not a killer, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: How do you know? You've had five whole conversations with the guy.",
        "Henry: And he seemed perfectly normal in every single one of them.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, Ted Bundy was the guy next door. But you know what, something is weird here.",
        "Henry: Not as weird as you think it is. I'm not gonna talk about this any more, okay? It is just ridiculous.",
        "B.J.: What's ridiculous?",
        "Henry: B.J.. hello.",
        "Maddie: Hi.",
        "Henry: You been there long?",
        "B.J.: Just walked in.",
        "Henry: Maddie was just telling me that we should tell Mike to redo the whole place in a sort of 80s black and white, you know, maybe with a chrome motif. And I told her that is -- that's just ridiculous.",
        "Maddie: Henry has no vision. No vision.",
        "B.J.: I can't quite envision that, either. What happened here?",
        "Mike: Bad news, B.J. rotting beams in the structural woodwork.",
        "B.J.: Aw, you're kidding. Termites, you think?",
        "Mike: Could be. I'd call an exterminator in here to get him to check it out. You should've done that before you bought the house.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I know, I know. I tend to be a little impatient sometimes.",
        "Henry: It wasn't just a beam falling. It fell down and hit Mike and knocked him out cold.",
        "B.J.: What? Are you okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "B.J.: You sure? Let me take you to the ER.",
        "Mike: No, no, no, it's not necessary.",
        "Maddie: Do you know how many people die of undiagnosed concussions?",
        "Mike: No. Do you?",
        "Maddie: No. But I'm betting it's a lot.",
        "B.J.: You know what, just make an appointment with a doctor, okay? Just to be safe. I can't afford to lose my star contractor right now. I got too much riding on you.",
        "Mike: All right, I'll do it right now. I gotta check my messages, anyway.",
        "Maddie: I'm gonna keep looking around, okay?",
        "Henry: Stay out of trouble.",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: It's a terrible accident, huh?",
        "B.J.: Yeah. I can't believe the wood's rotting.",
        "Henry: Were you here earlier today, by any chance?",
        "B.J.: Yeah, Mike and I toured the place, then I left him here to take some notes. Why?",
        "Henry: No reason. This is the first you're hearing of any killer beams, is it?",
        "B.J.: I'm not quite sure I like where you're going with this, Henry.",
        "Henry: I'm not going anywhere, B.J.",
        "B.J.: Well, good. Because, if you're going to accuse me of something, I hope you have the guts to just come right out and say it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Has something happened to Jennifer?",
        "Emily: No, no, nothing like that. We're just a little worried about her, me and Paul.",
        "Meg: Why? You think she might go back on the drugs?",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, it's not that, really. It's -- actually, it's Dusty.",
        "Meg: Dusty? What has he done?",
        "Emily: Nothing, per se. He's been spending a lot of time with her, you know. And after everything that's happened, she really needs to lay low. You know, and Paul and I both know that Dusty cares very much what you think, so --",
        "Meg: So, what are you saying, Emily? That I should tell Dusty not to hang around Jen so much?",
        "Emily: Well, she did just get out of the hospital, Meg. She's very vulnerable.",
        "Meg: From what I see, all Dusty's interested in is helping Jen get better.",
        "Emily: I hope so.",
        "Meg: But?",
        "Emily: But Paul and I think that he's, you know, encouraging her to believe that the baby is still alive. I think he's even helping her look into it. Look, I am just trying to protect Jennifer, okay? But you and I both know that this is the worst possible thing for Jennifer. It could cause her to have another breakdown for all we know.",
        "Meg: Why do you think Dusty would lead her in that direction?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Give her hope. But it's misguided, not to mention dangerous.",
        "Meg: You know, I find it hard to believe that Dusty would purposefully give Jennifer false hope. Maybe he thinks her baby's still alive.",
        "Emily: Well, that's ridiculous. You and I both know that it can't possibly be true. I need to protect Jennifer. And if it is true, if Dusty is encouraging her to believe something that cannot possibly be true, don't you think we need to do everything we can to keep him away from her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: This is a big deal for me. I'm going out on a limb here. So, you gotta be kind.",
        "Jennifer: What are you about to do?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna sing for you.",
        "Jennifer: Sing?",
        "Dusty: Yes, sing. I only know one song. And I'm warning you, this is going to be as painful for you as it is for me.",
        "Jennifer: So, don't do it.",
        "Dusty: Oh, but I have to. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: They're in here. We have a deal?",
        "Jack: Okay, whatever you say. Just get the hell out of the way.",
        "Iris: I'm serious. You better not welsh on me this time, okay, because I've got enough on the two of you to take your perfect life and just blow it out of the water. So you better tell me that I'm gonna get half of that kid's trust fund. Or I'm gonna scream for Gwen and Will to run like hell.",
        "Carly: All right, Iris, you're gonna get your money. I promise.",
        "Iris: Gwennie, baby doll, it's me. Listen, I just talked to Cass. You're gonna love what I have to say. Kid? Come on, open up at the door. I gotta tell you something. Gwen? Will? Is anybody in there?",
        "Jack: Get out of the way. Get the hell out of the way.",
        "Iris: You don't think they spotted you, okay, and then they took off.",
        "Carly: Or maybe you played us again, and this was all just to give them time to escape.",
        "Iris: No, they were supposed to wait here.",
        "Jack: Gwen? Will? It's Jack Snyder. I'm coming in. Back up.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Maddie: You should be the one that's worried.",
        "Mike: Whatever it is, I'm just not interested.",
        "Maddie: There's something you need to know about B.J.",
        "Emily: Dammit, Meg, you figured it out, haven't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Gwen? Will?",
        "Carly: They're not here.",
        "Iris: They were here. Why would I lie? Look. See?",
        "Jack: Leads to a street, and then on to the park. Perfect escape route.",
        "Iris: They had a baby carriage. It was right here. What would they do with that?",
        "Jack: Well, maybe they split up. One of them took the baby carriage before we even got here. And then when they heard you knocking, one of them scurried out the window.",
        "Ms. Clemens: What is all the noise in here? This is school property. You're trespassing.",
        "Jack: I'm Detective Jack Snyder. I'm from a police department in Oakdale, Illinois.",
        "Ms. Clemens: That's where Gwen was from. What happened to her?",
        "Jack: She ran out of her with a baby that she abducted from our home. We were told that she and a young man by the name of Will Munson were hiding out here with the baby.",
        "Ms. Clemens: I didn't want to believe it. She told me the boy was her son.",
        "Iris: He is.",
        "Jack: Not according to the law.",
        "Ms. Clemens: I don't understand.",
        "Carly: There's no time to explain it. Just please, tell us where they are.",
        "Ms. Clemens: I have no idea.",
        "Jack: Okay, we don't have a lot of time here. Did you talk to her at all? Did she tell where she might be headed?",
        "Ms. Clemens: I'm not sure she even knew. I took her in, I told her and her friend they could stay here until they figured out a plan.",
        "Iris: You know what, if you want to not trust somebody, don't trust her. Because she already lied to me once.",
        "Jack: Shut up, Iris.",
        "Ms. Clemens: I assure you, Detective, I would tell you if I knew where she was going. I don't want Gwen to get into any more trouble than she's already in.",
        "Carly: Jack, Jack, we have to get out there. We have to start looking for them.",
