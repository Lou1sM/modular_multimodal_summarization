        "Jade: Luke, I mean it. I am not going to the hospital!",
        "Luke: Jade, look at you. You can't even stand up. You have a fever!",
        "Jade: I'm all right.",
        "Luke: You need a doctor.",
        "Jade: I just need some water.",
        "Luke: Well, aren't you worried about the baby?",
        "Jade: This has nothing to do with the baby. I know. Just please, no doctors.",

        "[Will remembering]",
        "Gwen: Please, please if you love as much as you say you do, you have to leave me alone. I cannot be this unhappy anymore. I just can't do it.",
        "Waitress: Can I get you something?",
        "Will: What? I'm sorry.",
        "Waitress: Can I get you something to drink?",
        "Will: No, thanks. Is Gwen on tonight?",
        "Waitress: I think she's off, I could check her schedule for you.",
        "Will: No, that's fine. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gil: Right, we're gonna play what? Cola pong.",
        "Elwood: Why not?",
        "Gil: Not the same, el. I wish I would've let Kevin's brother get me that fake I.D.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that'll work when you look 12.",
        "Gil: That's cold, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I'm very sorry -- 13. Hey, if you're nice to me, I'll hook you up with something on the house.",
        "Gil: Maybe something cold with a head?",
        "Gwen: Oh, yes, I'll have the bartender amp up the carbonation on the soda.",
        "Elwood: Well, actually, Gwen, that can be kind of risky --",
        "Gwen: Actually, el -- I'm teasing.",
        "Gil: Does it ever freak you out how much Elwood looks like Alex?",
        "Gwen: Yes, definitely. The first time that I met him. And I guess that even though they were cousins, they weren't even close, that's why Elwood wasn't at Alex's funeral.",
        "Gil: Sure is a dead ringer. Bad choice of words.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: I'm so glad you agreed to come out and celebrate our new partnership.",
        "Emily: I haven't had much to celebrate these days.",
        "Craig: I know. I'm so sorry about your baby.",
        "Emily: Everybody's sorry. It doesn't change the fact that I miss her so much.",
        "Craig: Well, you're taking the right steps. Getting back into work. Making plans for the future.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I always thought she'd be part of that future. You know? Sometimes I think how is she strong enough to save another baby's life, but she wasn't strong enough to save her own. You don't know, do you?",
        "Craig: Know what?",
        "Emily: Craig, my daughter saved Johnny's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: My father, Johnny, nothing I do is right. And I don't have to take it. I don't deserve it. So if you called me up here to continue --",
        "Dusty: You wanna shut up! So that I can say I'm sorry?",
        "Lucy: You apologize?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I was wrong? I found out you had your father bounced out of here.",
        "Lucy: So I earned it?",
        "Dusty: That's not what I mean. When you said that you were on my side --",
        "Lucy: You didn't believe me until I turned my father into the cops.",
        "Dusty: I was afraid to believe you. But I'll be more relaxed now. Now that I know your father's out of this hotel.",
        "Lucy: I'm happy you'll be more relaxed and that I passed my latest loyalty test. Thanks, Dusty, for the apology. See you around.",
        "Dusty: All right listen. So, I've been all over the place.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, one second you put Johnny in my arms and the next you act like I'm going to take him out of the country.",
        "Dusty: I know --",
        "Lucy: You've treated me like the enemy.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry. But the rules kind of changed when your father showed up in town.",
        "Lucy: But I didn't change. I know right from wrong, Dusty. I know what's important to Johnny and his future.",
        "Dusty: I believe that.",
        "Lucy: Do you? Because trust cuts both ways. And when you say you believe me, it just sounds like words. Maybe this time around I don't trust you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Thanks --",
        "Luke: How's your nausea?",
        "Jade: Better.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, your fever is still really, really high.",
        "Jade: I know, but I can't take anything.",
        "Luke: Well, that's why you need to see a doctor. Okay, well at least let me call Will.",
        "Jade: No! Don't, Luke, please.",
        "Luke: Look, Jade, you're sick.",
        "Jade: I don't care. He's gonna be mad.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't care. Okay that's it. I'm calling Will.",
        "Jade: No, Luke, please don't. He's going to think I want attention.",
        "Luke: Jade, all right, here's the deal. I'm gonna call Will or we're gonna go to the hospital. Which is it gonna be?",
        "Jade: Okay, okay, I promise that I'll go. Just promise that you're not going to call Will. Promise and I'll go.",
        "Luke: Okay. Okay fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gil: Well, what do we have here? Raven Lake two -- the sequel.",
        "Gwen: Knock it off, Gil.",
        "Gil: I'm joking.",
        "Gwen: It's not funny. I'm sorry. You obviously heard?",
        "Maddie: It's okay. I always wanted to star in my own movie -- just not a horror film.",
        "Gwen: You know what, people make lame jokes when they don't know what to say. They don't know you. Once they do, it'll get better.",
        "Maddie: Maybe this is a bad idea. Let's do this another night.",
        "Gwen: Whoa! Where are you going? I called you. I invited you to hang out. So if you leave, I leave.",
        "Maddie: I'm not even in college.",
        "Gwen: Who cares?",
        "Maddie: Maybe if Casey were here --",
        "Gwen: Okay, stop. When did we become the kind of girls that needed guys around to have a good time? You don't need Casey and I don't need Will. So we stay. Okay?",
        "Elwood: So can I dance with the prettiest girl in the club?",
        "Gwen: Okay, Ellie. I'm talking here.",
        "Elwood: I prefer Elwood.",
        "Gwen: All right, I'm sorry, Elwood. Maybe later, okay?",
        "Elwood: I'd like that, Gwen. I'd like that very much.",
        "Maddie: The sad part is I don't think that's an act.",
        "Gwen: I know. I've seen his leisure suit.",
        "Maddie: Maybe he's a good dancer.",
        "Gwen: Will was a good dancer. Maybe it just felt that way when he held me.",
        "Maddie: What happened to making our own fun?",
        "Gwen: You're right. No you're right. From now on, my life cannot be about Will.",
        "Maddie: You keep telling yourself that.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I should've invited some of the kids from my music class. You'd really like them. There's this one guy, Steven, he's like the most incredible keyboard player that I've ever heard.",
        "Maddie: Is he cute?",
        "Gwen: He's definitely very easy on the eyes.",
        "Maddie: And is he seeing anybody?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Maybe I will find out.",
        "Maddie: Really?",
        "Gwen: Why not? I'm single. You know, starting my life over this -- for real without the drama.",
        "Maddie: I thought this wasn't going to be about Will.",
        "Gwen: It's not. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Waiter: My pleasure.",
        "Jack: It looks like Simon doesn't know what he's missing?",
        "Carly: I'll tell him that you stopped by, Jack.",
        "Jack: Your boyfriend is keeping interesting company these days. And I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about Spirro.",
        "Carly: Spirro again!",
        "Jack: He and Simon had their heads together down in the dining room. I'll bet the conversation wasn't about football.",
        "Carly: I'm sure that Simon was just telling him to kiss off -- again. Jack, Spirro approached Simon about doing some business. Simon didn't know about his rap sheet. When I told him about it, that was it. He told him that there'd be no deal. But I guess Spirro was still trying. Trying to get Simon to change his mind.",
        "Jack: Carly, guys like Spirro don't go chasing their marks. It's bad for business. They like their clients hungry.",
        "Carly: Simon isn't hungry to do business with Spirro or anybody like him. Lucinda is backing our project. She met with Simon and she's behind him 100%.",
        "Jack: Carly, come on, Lucinda owns a multi-national corporation. Why would she suddenly have an interest in a local real estate venture?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know Jack. Why don't you call her and ask her on your way home.",
        "Jack: I just don't want you to get dragged into one of Simon's --",
        "Carly: Stop it! Right there. It is not your job to look after me or tell me what to do, Jack! Never again!",
        "Jack: Just hear me out for second. You know that I testified against Spirro in a federal case just last year.",
        "Carly: Yes, I know. I know that he got off.",
        "Jack: On a technicality. This hits a little too close to home. I'm not about to risk the safety of our kids --",
        "Carly: Oh, this is rich. Mister my new friend Eve is a serial killer, is gonna lecture me on the company I keep?",
        "Jack: She was never around the kids.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe she was a little too preoccupied with hacking up other people's kids!",
        "Jack: I know how this goes. You get so wrapped up into whatever it is you're out to prove that you don't think about the consequences, Carly.",
        "Carly: Wow, things must be dull. Pretty slow at the station. You're making up crimes now!",
        "Jack: Am I? Tell me are you and Simon celebrating his new deal with this loan shark, or the fact that you're the one who put him in touch with that creep in the first place?",
        "Carly: Get out of here, Jack. I'm not gonna stand here and listen to you insult me.",
        "Jack: All I'm saying is you have a tendency to want to fix problems. Carly, you want whoever you're with to be a success. So much so, that if they get in a jam, you think they're the only one who can get 'em out.",
        "Carly: Oh, you're gonna bring up what happened at the Galaxy club again, huh?",
        "Jack: Please, please, tell me this is different.",
        "Carly: This project is legitimate. Spirro is not involved.",
        "Jack: You're sure?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: Then you won't mind if I do more digging.",
        "Carly: No, I don't mind. Dig. Dig away, Jack. Dig to your heart's content. Just dig your way out of my life!",
        "Jack: I am out of your life. When it comes to the safety of my kids, I'm not taking any chances.",
        "Carly: You expect me to believe this is about the kids? Come on, Jack. The truth is, it's about this -- all of this. You walking in here and finding me waiting for another man.",
        "Jack: What you do with Simon is your business. But when he's involved with a known crook --",
        "Carly: He's not involved with that crook, or any crook, for that matter!",
        "Simon: What's goin' on here? Could hear you guys all the way down the hall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So when you say you trust me now, you mean it?",
        "Dusty: I'll prove it.",
        "Lucy: How?",
        "Dusty: Take you to dinner.",
        "Lucy: Dinner proves you trust me?",
        "Dusty: It's a start.",
        "Lucy: What about when my father shows up unexpectedly, and I'm the closest target you've got?",
        "Dusty: You won't ever be a target again, I promise. I'm hungry, and I hate eating alone.",
        "Lucy: There's always Barbara.",
        "Dusty: Come on, now! You love making me work for this, don't you?",
        "Lucy: Yes. Yes, I do. But I also hate to see a grown man beg. Dinner sounds great.",
        "Dusty: I'll grab my keys. Johnny's still asleep?",
        "Barbara: Peaceful as can be.",
        "Dusty: You okay to stay with him?",
        "Barbara: Of course I am.",
        "Dusty: I won't be gone long. An hour, tops.",
        "Barbara: What's happening?",
        "Dusty: Just dinner. Call my cell if you need me. You ready?",
        "Lucy: Ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I mean, it was a risk. It was a huge risk. But I'd hurt Jennifer so badly. And helping Johnny recover was the only way I could say I was truly sorry for everything I did. Even though I know -- I knew it would never make up for all the pain I caused her.",
        "Craig: Well, it paid huge dividends with Dusty.",
        "Emily: That's not why I did it.",
        "Craig: But he did drop the charges.",
        "Emily: Yes, but that's not what it was about.",
        "Craig: Emily, I owe you so much more than my thanks. What you did was truly selfless.",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: I wonder how many other children would need these therapies -- the ones that helped Johnny.",
        "Emily: I have no idea, but it sounds like a terrific idea for the paper.",
        "Craig: As long as we cover the personal angle.",
        "Emily: Well, if it's not personal, it's not going in \"The Intruder,\" Craig.",
        "Craig: Right. How 'bout this for a new headline -- \"Local pariah saves children's lives.\"",
        "Emily: I love it, but what pariah are you talking about, me or you?",
        "Craig: You know, the law says that I can't get within so many feet of my own son, but it doesn't say anything about honoring his recovery.",
        "Emily: Where are you going with this, Craig?",
        "Craig: Well, you'll see. And as luck would have it, here are the perfect, upright citizens I need to turn my talk into action.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Oh, my God. They're playing our song.",
        "Gwen: What song?",
        "Elwood: You know, any song that says, \"Yeah, me and Elwood. You know, we're gonna make it happen out there.\"",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Actually, I'm sorry, I promised this song to Gil. Didn't I, Gil?",
        "Gil: Did you what?",
        "Gwen: Promise you this dance.",
        "Gil: You did?",
        "Gwen: Uh-huh.",
        "Gil: You did! She did. Let's go.",
        "Elwood: Well, yeah, I'll get you another soda.",
        "Gwen: No, it's -- it's okay, Elwood. All right, you're off the hook. We don't have to dance.",
        "Gil: I want to.",
        "Gwen: But Maddie and I were actually --",
        "Maddie: Just talking about having fun. Go dance. I will keep an eye on Elwood when he gets back.",
        "Gil: You might just grow on me yet.",
        "Maddie: I really hope not.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Will, its Luke. Jade didn't want me to call you, but I thought you should know that I just took her to the hospital. She's got a fever, and we don't know what's wrong. So I'm gonna wait with her here until you show up. Hey, you okay?",
        "Jade: I'm sick of waiting for the doctor.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, it's pretty busy out there. Do you want me to find someone?",
        "Dr. Morris: Jade.",
        "Jade: Dr. Morris --",
        "Dr. Morris: Hi.",
        "Jade: Um -- uh, Luke, uh, this is my Ob/Gyn, Dr. Morris. Uh, this is Luke Snyder.",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Dr. Morris: Hi. I'm surprised to see you here. You seemed fine when I saw you this morning.",
        "Jade: Did somebody call you?",
        "Dr. Morris: No, no. I was down admitting a patient for a delivery and saw your chart at the desk.",
        "Luke: Well, she's actually pretty sick, Doctor.",
        "Jade: He's making it sound worse than it is.",
        "Luke: No, she's dizzy. Uh, she had a fever. She even almost passed out earlier.",
        "Jade: I'm sure it's nothing.",
        "Dr. Morris: Well, there is a virus that's been going around. We've been seeing a lot of it since the ice storm. Have you been having any nausea?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but she just thinks that's kind of normal for her condition.",
        "Jade: Luke --",
        "Dr. Morris: Well, the virus should run its course in a day or so, but I'll defer that to the ER attending doctor. He may give you something for any secondary infections that could crop up while your immune system is fighting the virus.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but isn't that dangerous?",
        "Dr. Morris: No, no, not at all.",
        "Jade: Um, thank you. I'm sure you're very busy. I don't want to keep you.",
        "Dr. Morris: All right. Well, feel better. I'll send the attending in.",
        "Jade: See? It's nothing.",
        "Luke: It is so weird that he didn't want to check on the baby.",
        "Jade: He already did this morning.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you weren't sick this morning.",
        "Jade: Yes, but if there was something wrong, he would have seen it in the sonogram.",
        "Luke: Yeah, okay, I guess.",
        "Jade: Crisis over. Um, now, I am dying of thirst. Would you get me a soda?",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, there's a vending machine out in the waiting area. But you really should give that junk up. It is --",
        "Jade/Luke: -- Bad for the baby.",
        "Jade: I know. One vice at a time, okay?",
        "Luke: Okay. I'll be right back. Hey, Dr. Morris?",
        "Dr. Morris: Yeah?",
        "Luke: Um, about that medicine that you were talking about for secondary infections, is that safe?",
        "Dr. Morris: Yeah. No, of course. Yeah, Jade should be fine.",
        "Luke: Oh, no, I didn't mean for Jade. I meant for her baby. My mom didn't take any medicine when she was pregnant.",
        "Dr. Morris: Yeah, but Jade isn't pregnant.",

        "Carly: I told him that I warned you about the guy.",
        "Simon: She did.",
        "Jack: So what's going on?",
        "Carly: He doesn't owe you an explanation.",
        "Jack: Yes, but he owes you an explanation, Carly, and my kids!",
        "Simon: Jack, why don't you just calm down for a second?",
        "Jack: I want to know what the hell's going on with Spirro?",

        "Jack: Will I find one if I look hard enough?",
        "Simon: No, Jack. We exchanged a few words, which amounted to nothing.",
        "Jack: But no money was exchanged?",
        "Simon: No. Carly warned me about the guy, I backed off. That's it.",
        "Jack: Keep your eyes open.",
        "Carly: Oh, they're open, Jack. Finally.",
        "Jack: So are mine. Remember that, both of you.",
        "Simon: Sorry he came running to you like that.",

        "Simon: Yeah. I was getting to that part.",
        "Carly: Simon, tell me Jack is wrong. Tell me you would never have anything to do with that man.",
        "Simon: Yeah, Jack is wrong. Look, I told Spirro I didn't want him anywhere near our project. His is the kind that sinks reputations, and we don't need any of that right now. Carly -- Carly -- come here.",

        "Dr. Morris: Yeah, yeah, for a routine exam. Trust me, if Jade were pregnant, I'd have noticed it. [Pager beeps] Excuse me, I have to answer this.",

        "Gwen: Don't listen to that girl. I barely even know her.",
        "Will: But she's right. I don't belong here. I couldn't stop.",
        "Gwen: Stop what?",
        "Will: Looking at you.",
        "Gwen: You have a message.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. It's probably my mom. She called me like four times today.",
        "Gwen: Could be important.",
        "Will: The only thing that's important to me right now in my life is you. And everything else is a distant second.",
        "Gwen: More than your child?",
        "Will: How am I supposed to answer that without sounding like a total jerk? Things are different for you. You have a new life now. I'm just getting in the way. I got to go.",
        "Gwen: Good night, Will.",
        "Will: The last good night I had was with you, during that storm.",
        "Maddie: You okay?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gil: Hey, our dance got cut short.",
        "Gwen: Um, not right now.",
        "Gil: Don't tease me, Gwennie. I'm just a lonely freshman out for a good time.",
        "Maddie: Dance with him.",
        "Gwen: Okay. All right, let's go.",
        "Gil: Off to you.",

        "Lucy: I'm not known for my powers of observation, but this is definitely not the Lakeview dining room.",
        "Dusty: I like the privacy. Nobody shouting at you at the next table.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, why did you sneak me out the back way?",
        "Dusty: It's faster.",
        "Lucy: Faster than the lobby?",
        "Dusty: Twice as fast.",
        "Lucy: And less of a chance of Barbara chasing us to the service elevators.",
        "Dusty: You saw how she was throwing daggers at you.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, how could you miss it?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna add Barbara to the list of things I don't want to talk about.",
        "Lucy: What do you want to talk about?",
        "Dusty: I don't want to talk. I just want to enjoy your company, and eat.",
        "Lucy: That sounds good to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I really appreciate you having a drink with us. And I want to thank you, Bob, for approving the procedure that saved my son's life.",
        "Kim: He's Dusty's son, too, you know.",
        "Emily: Kim, I told Craig all about the stem cell transplant.",
        "Kim: Emily, I was really sorry to hear about the baby.",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: And from what Emily told me, there's a lot more work to be done. More children in need of help, more therapies to be researched.",
        "Bob: Well, that's true. That's why private funding is important now more than ever.",
        "Craig: Well, that's what I want to talk to you about. These kids don't have any time to wait. Now, I don't know anything about the science of it, but I know that it saved my son's life. So I want to fund a research program here at Memorial, to help other kids like Johnny. And not just in this area, wherever it's needed.",
        "Bob: Well, that's a very ambitious plan.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm nothing if I'm not ambitious. Now, I understand that the hospital is planning a benefit soon, so I'd like to announce the foundation in conjunction with the benefit, if I can.",
        "Bob: Well, there's not much time. You have to form the proposal and submit it to the board for review.",
        "Craig: Fine. And I want to move on it right away. In fact, I've already picked out a name. The Jennifer Donovan Research Foundation, in honor of Johnny's mother.",
        "[Kim scoffs]",
        "Kim: Craig, you must be out of your mind if you think Jennifer's family would allow you to use her name on anything connected to you, or your money.",
        "Craig: I don't see what the problem is, Kim.",
        "Kim: Well, you want to donate money to help children, that's great. But it's up to Jennifer's family whether they want anything named for her. That's not your call.",
        "Bob: Look, I'm not one to turn down donations, but if the donation is tied to a name, it could make it very difficult.",
        "Craig: Wouldn't that be up to the board of directors?",
        "Bob: They don't like to play games any more than I do.",
        "Emily: At least consider this before you decide.",
        "Bob: Okay. Submit the proposal to the board.",
        "Craig: Consider it done. And uh, will you put me in touch with the medical people that will help me flesh out the scientific data?",
        "Bob: Of course.",
        "Craig: Ah, and Kim, I'm only trying to keep Jennifer's memory alive for Johnny.",
        "Kim: Mm. That's up to Barbara and Dusty. Honey, I think our table's ready.",
        "Bob: Let me know when you put things together.",
        "Craig: I Will. And I appreciate your honesty, Kim.",
        "Kim: Uh-huh.",
        "Emily: Well, you did it. Talk about the perfect olive branch.",
        "Craig: You think so?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Come on. Aunt Fergie can't refuse. You think that Bob would announce to the world he's not interested in saving sick kids? I don't think so.",
        "Craig: Emily, all I'm trying to do is leave something behind that my son can be proud of -- something good, something built by his dad.",
        "Emily: And if it gets under Dusty, Paul and Barbara's skin?",
        "Craig: Look, they have to decide whether an old grudge is more important than advancing medical science.",
        "Emily: That is the perfect rat trap. Wow, a girl could learn a lot from you.",

        "Dusty: No room for dessert?",
        "Lucy: Oh, I don't think my arteries could take it.",

        "Lucy: Or this is somebody's dad talking.",
        "Dusty: I certainly don't want Johnny to grow up afraid of taking risks. A boy's gotta know what he can do.",
        "Lucy: Like devour a ten-ounce burger?",
        "Dusty: Right, like have an appetite for life.",
        "Lucy: It's good to hear you talk this way again.",
        "Dusty: After my wife died, I was just kind of circling the wagons for a while. And then, just when I was about to break out of the circle --",
        "Lucy: My father shows up.",
        "Dusty: Right. And I go crazy. You'd think that the sight of a beautiful woman carrying my son through an ice storm would make it perfectly clear that I couldn't have a better friend than you.",

        "Gwen: Come on, Gil.",

        "Gwen: Let me think about it, okay?",
        "Maddie: So, how was it?",
        "Gwen: It was okay.",
        "Maddie: Well, I have had about enough sugar to last me a month. And no, Will hasn't come back in.",
        "Gwen: I just wonder where he went.",
        "Maddie: You're doing a really good job moving on.",
        "Gwen: He looked very sad.",
        "Maddie: Of course he's sad. He settled with Jade.",

        "Luke: Jade, stop it! There is no baby! You're lying to Will, and you're lying to everybody.",

        "Carly: Why do I let him get to me?",
        "Simon: Carly, Jack doesn't care about Spirro. He found you in my room, bottle of champagne. By the time he was through, he didn't know what he was talking about.",
        "Carly: He accused me of introducing you to Spirro so that you would be a success. Boy, did I love telling him how Lucinda's backing the project.",
        "Simon: So that's all we're celebrating here -- our new backer?",
        "Carly: I don't even know what we're celebrating anymore. Nothing -- nothing's gone the way I'd planned.",

        "Carly: I feel silly, dressed like this, sneaking in here. Jack showing up, you hearing us fight like that.",
        "Simon: All right, don't worry about that. Forget about Jack. You sneaking in my room -- now, that's a lot more interesting. What was that all about? Explain that.",
        "Carly: You know how, when I came by before, you had someone in your room?",
        "Simon: Carly --",
        "Carly: Just let me finish, okay? I wasn't mad. You had a right to be with whoever you want to be with. It just surprised me that it bothered me so much.",
        "Simon: It bothered you?",
        "Carly: Simon, I don't -- I don't think I want you to be with anybody but me.",
        "Simon: Well, Carly, I swear to you, I did not have sexual relations with that person in my room. In fact, the mere thought of it is really quite grotesque.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Simon: Really. No one is more attractive to me than you. And you have been driving me crazy since I first laid eyes on you.",
        "[Banging sound]",

        "Craig: Suspecting the worst in people must be something you picked up from Paul.",
        "Emily: Paul will never let you name the foundation after his sister, Craig. He's gonna see right through you.",
        "Craig: What makes you so sure that I'm doing this out of spite?",
        "Emily: Because if you really wanted to honor the person who saved your son's life, you would name your foundation the Jennifer Stewart Ryan foundation, after my daughter, not Dusty's late wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: So, what are the pros and cons of Craig's offer?",
        "Barbara: There are no pros.",
        "Kim: Well, it might help a lot of children who are as sick as Johnny is.",
        "Barbara: Craig does not care about sick children. If he did, he would have made an anonymous donation, not one with conditions on it.",
        "Kim: I warned him that the name was gonna be a problem.",
        "Bob: And if he insists on it without the family's permission, he'll lose support.",
        "Barbara: I will not allow Craig Montgomery to use my daughter's memory to redeem himself. I won't have it. I won't, Bob. I will fight him with my last breath.",

        "Lucy: Too soon.",
        "Dusty: Maybe. Yeah, maybe. But, uh --",
        "Lucy: I've got a better idea. Let's have dessert. Didn't I show you that coconut cream pie on the menu?",
        "Dusty: What about your arteries?",
        "Lucy: My arteries can take a backseat when it comes to coconut cream pie. Split it with me?",

        "Simon: She wanted to pay me in cash. It was some sort of accounting thing. I --",
        "Carly: I am not so hot for you, Simon, that my brain has turned to mush. Jack was right about you, you are a conman, and you are a liar. And you have brought Spirro into my life, and you'd better find a way to get him the hell out of it!",
