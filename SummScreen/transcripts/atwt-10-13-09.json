        "Emily: Wait a minute. Parker, what are you doing here so early?",
        "Parker: I'm here to pick Liberty up.",
        "Emily: Really? Because I know for a fact there's no school today. That's why I'm letting Liberty sleep in.",
        "Parker: She's still asleep?",
        "Emily: Yeah. She needs her rest. She's pregnant.",
        "Parker: Oh, no, no, no, no. She needs to wake up right now.",
        "Emily: Why? Why?",
        "Parker: Because she has SATs today. That's why there's no school.",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Parker: No, she's got -- I've got to wake her up right now.",
        "Emily: Oh, no.",
        "Parker: Liberty, wake up!",
        "Emily: Oh, no.",
        "Parker: Liberty, get up.",
        "Liberty: Parker, what?",
        "Parker: Come on. Wake up. You're late.",
        "Liberty: Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",

        "[Rosanna clears throat]",
        "Rosanna: Hello.",
        "Craig: It's me.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know.",
        "Craig: I catch you at a bad time?",
        "Rosanna: No. I'm just making lunch for Sage.",
        "Craig: Oh, wow. Skipping breakfast. Is that something new?",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: The middle school is going on a field trip 'cause of the SATs.",
        "Craig: Really? Does that mean you'll be free this morning?",
        "Rosanna: Maybe. Why?",
        "Craig: Marketing wants a meeting. They want to discuss some new ideas about the launch. I was hoping that you could come over here, and we could brainstorm.",
        "Rosanna: I don't think so.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Craig: Why not? You have something against brainstorming?",
        "Rosanna: No. I just don't think it's a good idea for us to be, you know, alone right now, especially not in your hotel room.",
        "Craig: You're afraid to be alone with me?",
        "Rosanna: You made a promise to Parker, remember?",
        "Craig: Yeah, but that had nothing to do with this.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, it does. You told Parker that if we stay away from each other that, you know, he wouldn't tell Carly about -- I don't know what to call it.",
        "Craig: The bargain was about us keeping our distance personally, not professionally. This is business.",
        "Rosanna: Right.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Okay. I will meet you, but not in your hotel room. You just pick someplace public, and I'll meet you there.",
        "Craig: Okay. How about Metro? It's public. People will see us. We'll remove any trace of temptation.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Metro it is. I'll see you there.",
        "Craig: I'll be waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mama, could you stop, please?",
        "Emma: Oh, I just can't. I can't. If I do, I'm afraid I might do something very foolish.",
        "Meg: Like what?",
        "Emma: Like run into town and track Holden down myself. Oh, I just want to take him in my arms and never let him go.",
        "Meg: I know you're anxious to see him. So am I.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Emma: I just want to make everything perfect here, the way it was just before we thought we lost him.",
        "Meg: Yeah, Mama, you do know how much has changed since he's been gone.",
        "Emma: Now, I don't want to talk about that, not today.",
        "Meg: All I'm saying is that he probably doesn't want another big reunion. He is probably still in shock.",
        "Emma: I hope that's not true.",
        "Meg: Well, think about it. I mean, he survived this horrible accident. He's been away from us for months. And he finally makes his way back home to see Lily marrying Damian? I mean, he probably needs some breathing room right now.",
        "Holden: I have to say, I think that whole breathing thing is highly overrated.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Emma: Holden. Oh, my boy! My boy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad? Dad, are you upstairs?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Holden Snyder had been declared dead. Lily accepted it. The whole family accepted it. We got married with the best of intentions. But now that Holden's alive, Lily's convinced that our marriage isn't valid.",
        "Peter: But you believe otherwise?",
        "Damian: Yes, I do. And I need you to tell me that I'm right, because Lily's my wife now, and I have no intention of losing her again.",
        "Peter: I marked a case for you. Chesley vs. Chesley. They set a precedent a few years back.",
        "Damian: Am I going to like it? Is this for real?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you guys would be up by now.",
        "Lily: Don't apologize. I've been up for a while.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I couldn't sleep either.",
        "Luke: I was running around, screaming, \"My dad's alive! My dad's alive!\" Really drove Noah crazy. So, is he still sleeping?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Luke: Where is he? Is he not here? Is he at the farm?",
        "Lily: The Lakeview, I think. At least that's where he said he was going last night.",
        "Luke: Wait. He didn't spend the night here?",
        "Lily: I wanted him to, Luke, but it was his choice. He said he couldn't.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because he's hurt and confused, and he's incredibly angry at me right now.",
        "Luke: Because you married Damian.",
        "Lily: My marriage to Damian isn't legal. I am married to your father.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but still, it couldn't have been easy for him to see that.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: I know. He's under the assumption that I am torn between him and Damian.",
        "Luke: Well, are you?",
        "Lily: Luke, there's no simple answer to that question.",
        "Luke: Yes, there is. Which one of them do you want to be with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: No, no. I cannot believe I overslept. I swear I set my alarm.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you did. It's just I heard your alarm buzzing up there, and I went in to check on you, and you were sound asleep, so I figured I'd let you keep sleeping.",
        "Liberty: What? You turned it off and didn't wake me? I had it set for a reason, Emily! What? You know how important the SATs are to me.",
        "Emily: I know, but you're also pregnant, and your body knows what you need more than you do right now.",
        "Liberty: I know what I need, and I need to not be late! Can we go now, please?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Car's out front.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, if it isn't my favorite little man. Hi.",
        "Craig: Hey, buddy. She's talking to you. Can't you say good morning?",
        "Johnny: Good morning.",
        "Rosanna: Good morning to you.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: I thought this was going to be a business meeting.",
        "Craig: It is. But I thought you might be more comfortable with a chaperone.",
        "Johnny: What's a chaperone?",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: It's somebody who gets to play with all of his crayons. How about that?",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Craig: So, shall we get started?",
        "Rosanna: Absolutely.",
        "Craig: Okay. Their first concern is about the scope of the marketing launch campaign. They want something very modern, but expansive.",
        "Rosanna: Right. I've been thinking about that. I think we should launch the whole thing on social-media platforms.",
        "Craig: Social-media platforms?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. The launch of the campaign.",
        "Craig: Yeah. That's very impressive. Good idea.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, good.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: Excuse me. Hello. It's Mrs. Miller.",
        "Johnny: Is that Brendan's mom?",
        "Craig: Yes, it is. Yeah, I'm with Johnny. You're at the park? A sleepover?",
        "Johnny: Can I go?",
        "Craig: How can I say no to that? Sure. Yeah, you can pick him up at Metro.",
        "Johnny: Yay!",
        "Craig: Well, I guess it looks like it's gonna be you and me after all.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mama, you're gonna squeeze the life out of him.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Emma: I just might. I just might. I just might. Oh! Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat -- some breakfast?",
        "Holden: No, no.",
        "Emma: Ooh, I have some fresh eggs, some lovely berries.",
        "Holden: I had room service this morning.",
        "Emma: Room service?",
        "Holden: Yeah. With the way things are, I took a room at the Lakeview. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. Say it, Mama. I need to fight for Lily no matter what. Go ahead.",
        "Emma: No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know anymore. You know, I think what Lily did was wrong, marrying Damian so quickly. I told her so, but she wouldn't listen to me. I can really understand if you don't want to be in the house. I mean, you don't have to explain it to me.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Mama, come on. Be fair.",
        "Emma: I am being fair.",
        "Meg: Holden, look, I'll admit, while you were gone, I was rather hard on Lily.",
        "Holden: Yeah. And I can understand that.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: But you also have to cut her some slack. I mean, she was destroyed when they told us that you died. We all were.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Meg: And she didn't choose to leave you. I mean, she was lost and confused, and --",
        "Holden: She turned to Damian.",
        "Meg: Yeah, she did. But she never, ever stopped loving you. She told me that. And I know you. You never stopped loving her.",
        "Holden: Listen, I understand what you're saying. But right now, I just need a little time.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I know. But there's a reason you came back. Just remember that.",
        "Emma: Listen, Holden, don't stay at the Lakeview. Come home here. Let us take care of you.",
        "Holden: Mama, I appreciate the offer, but right now, I just need to be on neutral ground. It's best to think things through when you're alone.",
        "Meg: Well, you're not exactly alone. You have that friend of yours staying there at the Lakeview.",
        "Holden: Who?",
        "Meg: Yeah. I didn't get her name, but she came by here last night, looking for you.",
        "Holden: She?",
        "Meg: Yeah, this woman. Blonde, very sweet. She asked me where she could stay, and I suggested the Lakeview.",
        "Holden: I got to go.",
        "Emma: No, no, no. No, no, no, no. You just got here. You just got here. You can't go.",
        "Holden: Mama, Mama, I promise you, I'm coming back.",
        "Emma: Okay.",
        "Holden: Okay. I love you.",
        "Emma: And I love you. I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Holden: Mwah! See you later. Love you, too. Bye-bye.",
        "Meg: What was that about?",
        "Emma: I was just about to ask you the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: There's no choice to be made, Luke. I am married to your father.",
        "Luke: Which father?",
        "Lily: The warm, loving man who raised you.",
        "Luke: So you want to be with Dad?",
        "[Lily gasps]",
        "Lily: He's my husband. We were happy together.",
        "Luke: I know. But there were some times when you were confused.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Luke: All that stuff that Faith was mad about, like when you and Damian kissed before Dad went on his trip.",
        "Lily: Luke, I told you, that was a mistake. I spent weeks thinking that your father's accident was my fault. I blame myself for what had happened, and there was no way to make it up to him.",
        "Luke: And now you feel like you have a second chance?",
        "Lily: When he walked through those doors, it was like seeing him for the first time. All those feelings, they came rushing back to me.",
        "Luke: Well, what about Damian?",
        "Lily: Damian understands.",
        "Luke: Are you sure, Mom? Because you are wearing his ring.",
        "Lily: This ring -- it doesn't mean anything. I can prove it to you. Come on. No, I'll get it. I'll get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Parker, stop. Oh, my God. I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick. Oh.",
        "[Liberty coughs]",
        "Liberty: Sorry.",
        "Parker: No, it's okay. That happens.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, except when most kids puke before their SATs, it's because they're nervous, not because they have morning sickness.",
        "Parker: That's okay. Maybe you should have had something to eat, like Emily said. That way --",
        "Liberty: Maybe I would have been able to if she would have woken me up when she was supposed to.",
        "Parker: Well, we're here now, so come on. Let's just go. Maybe there's still some time.",
        "Liberty: No, no.",
        "Administrator: Sorry. You can't go in.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm Liberty Ciccone. I'm supposed to be in there. I'm taking the SAT. this morning.",
        "Administrator: Well, you're too late. Test already started.",
        "Liberty: Please? If you just let me in, I'll catch up, I promise.",
        "Parker: You don't understand. She woke up this morning. She was very sick, and we got here as fast as we could.",
        "Administrator: Once the exam starts, nobody's allowed in.",
        "Liberty: Please?",
        "Administrator: I'm sorry. Those are the rules.",
        "Liberty: You don't understand. I have to take this test today.",
        "Administrator: You'll have another chance to take it in the spring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hi. Can you tell me if Maeve Stone checked in last night?",
        "Maeve: It's McBride now.",
        "Holden: Maeve.",
        "Maeve: I decided to use my maiden name. Kind of my way of shedding the past.",
        "Holden: So it was you at the farm last night?",
        "Maeve: Yes. Your sister told you?",
        "Holden: Why didn't you give her your name?",
        "Maeve: Well, you weren't there, and things sounded kind of complicated, so I didn't want to make things worse for you.",
        "Holden: I don't think you can do that.",
        "[Maeve laughs]",
        "Holden: Look at you.",
        "Maeve: Oh, thanks. I decided to take a little trip to the hotel spa this morning, and I don't know, do something different. So what do you think? Do you like it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Emily, leave me alone. Oh, my God.",
        "Parker: Look, I know you're really upset right now, but you can still take the SATs.",
        "Liberty: Parker, in the spring? How is that a good thing? My applications are due. I haven't even started my essays, and they don't have any SAT scores.",
        "Parker: You need to calm down. You're freaking out.",
        "Liberty: Of course I'm freaking out, because my life is over!",
        "Parker: No, it isn't. We're gonna figure something out, okay?",
        "[Liberty groans]",
        "Mackenzie: Liberty, hey. Come join us.",
        "Liberty: Great. That's exactly what I need right now.",
        "Parker: You know what? Maybe it is. Why don't you go hang out with them?",
        "Liberty: What? No. No, no. Where are you going?",
        "Parker: Well, I'm gonna go do something that will help you out.",
        "Liberty: No, Parker, leaving me with them right now, that's not helping.",
        "Parker: Liberty, come on. They're your friends.",
        "Liberty: I take back every nice thing I ever said about you.",
        "Parker: No, you don't.",
        "Liberty: I -- I -- okay.",
        "Mackenzie: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Girl: Was that test insane or what?",

        "Rosanna: Oops.",
        "Craig: I got it. I got --",
        "Rosanna: No, I got -- yeah.",
        "Craig: You got it.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I got this. Sorry.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: Oh, you know what I need? The research thing. Consumer-product research.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I know where that is. That's somewhere in that pile over there.",
        "Craig: Right. Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, sorry.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: Damn!",
        "Rosanna: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Let me do it. Let me do it. Let me get it. I got it.",
        "Craig: No, I can do it. I can do it. It's okay. I got it.",
        "Rosanna: Sorry.",
        "Craig: It's all right. It's all right.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, boy, oh, boy. Do you know what I can't find? The mock-up of our initial ads.",
        "Craig: Mock-ups?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, the initial --",
        "Craig: Mock-ups! Mock-ups, yeah. Well, Carly did those. And I know we have them, because we never submitted them.",
        "Rosanna: Right.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: So where are they?",
        "Craig: The mock-ups.",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Craig: They're not here. So if they're not here, then -- the house. They're somewhere at the house.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, right. Well, I think we probably just, you know, to be prepared, we should have them for the meeting this afternoon, okay? So I'll be back.",
        "Craig: Where are you going?",
        "Rosanna: Well, to the house to find the ads.",
        "Craig: Oh!",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: The mock-ups, yeah.",
        "Rosanna: I'll call you when I find them.",
        "Craig: Okay. All right. Thanks.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I just remembered. The ads -- Carly has sketches all over the house. I just don't remember which ones were the final ones, you know?",
        "Craig: You want me to help you find them?",
        "Rosanna: Please. I could use your help.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Of course, yeah. Let's go.",

        "Emma: You want Holden and Lily back together so you're free to chase Damian.",
        "Meg: You would think that.",
        "Emma: You tell me I'm wrong.",
        "Meg: You know Damian and I belong together just as much as Lily and Holden do.",
        "Emma: Why do you insist on chasing after a man who does not want you?",
        "Meg: You don't know what Damian wants!",
        "Emma: He wants Lily! He's made that very clear! And this obsession that you have with him is just plain unhealthy!",
        "Meg: I am not obsessed!",
        "Emma: You let Damian and Lily and Holden work things out for themselves, you hear me?",
        "Meg: Right, right. We wouldn't want to upset Lily. God, when are you gonna stop feeling sorry for her?",
        "Emma: I don't feel sorry for Lily. I am very upset with her right now.",
        "Meg: All I'm trying to do is set things right.",

        "Maeve: Okay, okay. I was all set to start my new life. I was. I even made it all the way down to the ticket counter at the airport. I just -- they asked me where to, and I didn't know what to say.",
        "Holden: So you came here?",
        "Maeve: Yeah. When I went to Oakdale to bring your letter to the bank, I saw that it was nice and safe. And I knew you were here. I'm not expecting anything from you, honest. I'm not.",
        "Holden: Hey, come on. You're the new kid in town. The least I can do is be a friend, right?",
        "Maeve: Friends. Okay. Does that mean you like my new look?",
        "Holden: I liked the old one.",
        "Maeve: Thank you.",
        "[Maeve laughs]",
        "Holden: You look like a million bucks.",
        "Maeve: Hardly. It's just a, you know, haircut.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. New earrings. A necklace, purse. Is this the first thing you've done with all the money that Skaggs and Eb stole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Damian. What are you doing here?",
        "Damian: I wanted to give you these.",

        "Damian: I just wanted you to know how much I missed being with you last night.",

        "Damian: Lily, listen to me.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Damian: You don't have to torture yourself like this anymore. It's over.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Damian: I mean there's no reason for us to spend another night apart from each other ever again.",

        "Craig: Yes, they are indeed. Well done. You have the magic touch.",

        "Craig: Like I said, the magic touch.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, you promised.",
        "Craig: I've made a lot of promises I haven't kept.",
        "Rosanna: Well, yeah, I think we both have. Which is why we should probably work on that.",
        "Craig: You mean like together?",
        "Rosanna: That would be counterproductive, wouldn't it?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rosanna: We should probably get back downstairs.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's all right. It's not entirely your fault, really. Seriously, I kissed you back.",
        "Craig: Yeah, don't remind me. I made a promise to Parker.",
        "Rosanna: I know.",
        "Craig: I'll wait for you downstairs.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I'll find you.",
        "Parker: Oh, wow. I should have known. You two are just a couple of liars.",
        "Craig: Parker, this isn't what you think it is.",
        "Parker: I'm not stupid, Craig. It's exactly what I think it is.",
        "Rosanna: Parker, just take a minute and listen for a second before you decide what it is or it isn't. We're not gonna lie to you, I promise.",
        "Parker: You promise? Really? 'Cause you promised that this wouldn't happen. What happened? You forgot?",
        "Craig: No. We were looking for sketches.",
        "Rosanna: It doesn't matter that we were looking for sketches. We shouldn't have been in here in the first place.",
        "Parker: I was actually gonna ask you for help. How stupid am I?",
        "Craig: You need my help? For what?",
        "Parker: No, no. I don't care anymore, all right?",
        "Craig: No, Parker, tell me. It's important.",
        "Parker: Liberty missed her SATs. she woke up late and she had morning sickness. I figured with your connections, you might be able to help her.",
        "Craig: Well, yeah, maybe I can. Why don't we sit down, and we'll talk about it?",
        "Parker: Forget it.",
        "Craig: Parker, if you need my help, I'll --",
        "Parker: If you want to help, you can get out of my mom's house!",
        "Craig: Parker, listen to me.",
        "Parker: No, I am dead serious, Craig! Get out!",
        "Rosanna: Craig, maybe you should just go. Don't make it any worse, okay? Parker, I'm so sorry.",

        "Liberty: I don't know. It's hard to say.",
        "Mackenzie: I looked for you before the exam started.",
        "Liberty: I was running a little late. I just slipped in the back. But you -- I don't think you should worry about getting a 2,100, 'cause colleges really don't care about SATs anymore.",
        "[Girl laughs]",
        "Girl: Tell that to my parents.",

        "Meg: Aren't those a little young for you?",
        "Emily: They're not for me. They're maternity clothes. They're for Liberty.",
        "Meg: Right. I heard she was staying with you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, for good reason. We're adopting her baby.",
        "Meg: You know it's not that easy, right? I mean, to be happy, to be a family?",
        "Emily: So far, it has been.",
        "Meg: So, do you just put it all behind you? Is that the trick?",
        "Emily: Put what behind me?",
        "Meg: Every horrible thing you and Paul did to each other, to other people.",
        "Emily: Why do you have to go there now?",
        "Meg: I just want to know how you did it. I mean, you have it all now -- instant family, instant marriage, instant respectability.",
        "Emily: Paul said you were going through a rough time --",
        "Meg: I don't care what Paul said!",

        "Lily: How is that possible? How could I be married to the both of you?",
        "Damian: You're not, Lily. Your marriage to Holden was nullified when he was declared legally dead. I am your husband now, in every way that counts.",

        "Damian: Lily, you're missing the point. It already is over. There's nothing keeping us apart now. We can spend the rest of our lives together as husband and wife, just like we planned.",

        "Meg: Well, you don't do nice.",
        "Emily: You're right. With you, it is an absolute waste of time. Hey! Liberty, how are you?",
        "Liberty: What's up?",
        "Emily: What's up? Everything? I just bought you lots of maternity clothes at Fashions.",

        "Liberty: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Emily: No, no. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about what happened this morning and the alarm and you being late. I really want to make it up to you.",
        "Liberty: You don't have to do that, Emily.",
        "Emily: No, I do. I want to do it. I want to take you out to dinner. And I thought maybe me, you and Paul could have dinner. And then maybe you could, you know, give us a little fashion show with your new --",
        "Liberty: No, yeah.",
        "Emily: Yeah, no. Okay, so then just dinner?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, just dinner.",
        "Emily: Okay. And then don't worry about these, 'cause you're not showing so much now, but you will. And there's a great tailor I have in case they don't fit.",
        "Liberty: Oh! Yeah, you really just thought of everything there, haven't you?",
        "Emily: I'm trying, Liberty. I'm really trying.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Okay. So I'll see you at home later? Okay, bye.",
        "Liberty: Bye.",

        "Craig: Good. Then you can just listen.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Craig: Parker, I think you're mature and experienced enough now to understand just how powerful a force attraction can be.",
        "Parker: No, no, see, that's not a good excuse.",
        "Craig: And I think based on your experience with Liberty, you understand that just because you promised to keep your distance from someone, it's not always that easy.",
        "Parker: You know what would make it a lot easier? Staying out of my mom's bedroom with your girlfriend.",
        "Craig: I can do that.",
        "Parker: Yeah, so you say.",
        "Craig: But what I can't do is turn off my feelings for Rosanna just because you don't like them.",
        "Parker: You know what? I don't think my mom's gonna be too thrilled about them, either.",
        "Craig: You know, Parker, you've become quite a young man. You're strong. You're self-reliant. You're independent. You've demonstrated you can show good judgment.",
        "Parker: Am I supposed to be flattered?",
        "Craig: No. You're too mature for that. But you have impressed me. Wonder if it's time I can be a little less restrictive when it comes to your trust fund.",
        "Parker: Is that a bribe?",
        "Craig: How can it be a bribe when it's already your money?",
        "Parker: Because you don't want me to tell my mom about you and Aunt Rosanna.",
        "Craig: Parker, if you're mature enough to understand the complexities of an adult relationship, then you're mature enough to handle your trust fund. Think about it. It's a lot of money.",
        "Parker: Get your hand off of me and go to hell.",

        "Maeve: Oh. Al's diner. There you go.",
        "[Maeve laughs]",
        "Holden: Hey, you know, we try to keep up.",
        "Maeve: So, in the root cellar, when you told me the burger was your favorite thing to eat, was it from that place?",
        "Holden: You remember that?",
        "Maeve: My memory's kind of funny that way.",
        "Holden: You're lucky. I'd take you in there to sample one yourself, but it looks like they're closed. I think they had a fire yesterday. So, anything else you want to see?",
        "Maeve: Actually, the view is very interesting from here right as it is. That's him, isn't it?",
        "Holden: That's him all right.",
        "Maeve: I recognize him from the bank.",
        "Holden: Guess he's got one of those faces.",
        "Maeve: He's got nothing compared to you.",
        "Holden: That's not exactly true.",
        "Damian: I'd like to be there.",
        "Lily: Why? I can speak to Mr. Cartwright by myself.",
        "Damian: I know you can. You're gonna be talking about our future. I'd like to be there.",
        "Lily: You went to see him without me.",
        "Damian: All right. Lily, look, I don't want to fight with you over this.",
        "Lily: I don't either, Damian. This is hard enough as it is for me. Please let me do this my way.",
        "Damian: All right, all right. Anything to make my beautiful wife happy.",
        "Holden: Ready to continue on the tour?",
        "Maeve: Sounds great. And I know where we should go next.",
        "Holden: Where's that?",
        "Maeve: The nearest bar. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, and I went to Fashions. I got her so many clothes. No, I didn't go overboard. Well, maybe a little. But you know what? You can't even tell these are maternity clothes. Oh, Paul, Liberty is gonna love this stuff.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Parker: Liberty, are you okay? What is this?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. It smelled fruity, though.",
        "Parker: Is there alcohol in here?",
        "Liberty: Oh, do not be mad at me, please.",
        "Parker: You're pregnant. You know you're not supposed to be drinking while you're pregnant.",
        "Liberty: I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: Why are you doing this?",
        "Liberty: I am so mad at myself. I'm just trying to fit in and be normal, like everybody else!",
        "Parker: You are normal.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm drunk -- pregnant.",
        "Parker: It will be okay.",
        "Liberty: No, it's not. You're just saying that, but it's never gonna be okay again. You hear that? Everybody staring at me now.",
        "Parker: Just forget about them, okay? Let's get out of here. Get your bag. Let's go.",

        "Rosanna: Oh, God. How could we be so stupid?",
        "Craig: Things happen, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Things don't just happen, Craig. We're adults. We're supposed to be capable of restraint. He's gonna tell Carly, isn't he?",
        "Craig: I don't know. We're just gonna have to see what he does. But I have to believe that he wouldn't want to hurt Carly any more than we would want to.",
        "Rosanna: If Carly is gonna find out the truth, then she should hear it from us. Maybe we can explain this to her in a way that will make sense?",
        "Craig: If that's possible.",
        "Rosanna: It just simply has to be. Let's just postpone the meeting, okay? And we'll go to the clinic, and we'll talk to Carly.",
        "Craig: Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Craig: Let's just wait and see what Parker does. I have a feeling that once he calms down, he'll come around.",
        "Rosanna: And what if he doesn't? Oh, God. Mr. Swanson's here.",
        "Craig: He's early.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. How are we gonna get through this?",

        "Damian: Excuse me?",
        "Meg: It was a lie, and there have been enough of those.",
        "Damian: I don't follow.",

        "Peter: Till a judge says otherwise, you are Mrs. Damian Grimaldi.",

        "Holden: Aw, come on. It's not that bad.",
        "Maeve: Please. The drinks were so watered down.",

        "Emily: No, don't.",
        "Damian: That's why I don't mind giving her the space she needs, because I know she'll always come back to me.",
