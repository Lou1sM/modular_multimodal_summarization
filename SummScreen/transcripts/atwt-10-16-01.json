        "\r\nBryant: You got something for me, Isaac?",
        "\r\nIsaac: There's a bar rag right there if you want to clean up some of those \r\nglasses. Oh, you want this, huh? A paycheck.",
        "\r\nBryant: Thank you. If I deposit it within an hour, there might be a slim chance \r\nmy rent check will not bounce.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Running short already, huh? That didn't take long.",
        "\r\nBryant: No. I bought Jennifer something this week. It's a silver locket.",
        "\r\nIsaac: You've got to watch every penny you spend, Bryant, now that you're a \r\nworking man.",
        "\r\nBonnie: Brilliant, isn't he? I don't know why you don't have a seat on the stock \r\nexchange.",
        "\r\nIsaac: Why have one seat when I have all of these?",
        "\r\nBonnie: My check, including the massive amount of overtime I put in simply to \r\nsurvive.",
        "\r\nIsaac: And next week, I'm gonna deduct from all the customers you drove away.",
        "\r\nBonnie: I don't drive anyone away, nor do I pander to ingrates who --",
        "\r\nIsaac: Oh, my dear, sweet, aunt Josephine --",
        "\r\nBryant: Beautiful woman. It looks like Ben is dating again.",
        "\r\nIsaac: That's not Ben's date. It's mine.",
        "\r\nBryant: Well, you win. You took the blind date.",
        "\r\nBonnie: It was too easy.",
        "\r\nBryant: Think they'll hit it off?",
        "\r\nBonnie: Well, from the looks of her hair and makeup, she's highly superficial \r\nand has no taste. Which means they could make a perfect match.",
        "\r\nBryant: Are you always this hard on other women?",
        "\r\nBonnie: Not if they don't deserve it. Take Jennifer, for instance. Despite her \r\nabsurd notion towards money, she's the essence of grace and beauty.",
        "\r\nBryant: I can't argue with that.",

        "\r\nJennifer: Will, come eat your sandwich.",

        "\r\nWill: I'll come in right after this next show, okay?",
        "\r\nJennifer: No. Will, come on. You've hardly eaten a thing all day, and I know I \r\ntold you to disappear, but this isn't how I wanted you to do it, so eat.",
        "\r\nWill: But my stomach feels queasy. If I eat that sandwich --",
        "\r\nJennifer: Okay, okay. I'll make you something else.",

        "\r\nJennifer: My mom finally asked to see us, Will and me.",
        "\r\nGot scared at the way she looks, and she went completely nuts.",
        "\r\nEmily: Nuts, how?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Well, first she made Will feel really guilty, and then -- then she \r\ntold me she couldn't wait for me to give up on her. And Will's pretending that \r\nhe's okay, but I know that he's really hurting.",
        "\r\nEmily: All right, Jennifer, you listen to me. Your brother has a very strong \r\nfather, a loving sister, lots of friends to support him. He's going to get \r\nthrough this. He will.",
        "\r\nJennifer: I hope so.",
        "\r\nEmily: He will, sweetheart. Is your dad there? We had a little disagreement. I \r\nwant to smooth things over with him.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Sorry. No, he's at work. But if you want to come by later, I wouldn't \r\nmind having someone to talk to.",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, I'd like that, too. But you know what? There's someone I have to go \r\nsee first, so I'll check in with you later. Bye.",

        "\r\nJennifer: Hey. This is a surprise.",
        "\r\nBilly: What, am I not supposed to be here? Look, I can't help it. I mean, I \r\nwaited for you back at the cottage, but you never showed. I couldn't wait any \r\nlonger, so I had to come and see you.",

        "\r\nPaul: This is the first time I've seen you relax in months.",

        "\r\nPaul: Uh, yeah. Every -- everyone's thrilled.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Wonderful. Now if I can just stop thinking about other things, as well. \r\nI keep thinking about Will and Jennifer and how everything got so out of \r\ncontrol.",
        "\r\nPaul: You know, Mom, it was the first time Will had seen you. You know? And at \r\nleast now, he's seen how badly you've been injured, and next time, it'll be \r\nbetter.",
        "\r\nBarbara: You always know just what to say to me, don't you?",
        "\r\nPaul: You get some rest, okay? Gotta go. Got a date.",

        "\r\nPaul: That won't happen with Rose.",
        "\r\nBarbara: She's taking orders from Lucinda. She wants access to my Worldwide \r\nstock, and she's using you to get it. ",
        "\r\nPaul: You don't think maybe she might find me just a little bit attractive?",
        "\r\nBarbara: This isn't funny, Paul. She will bring you nothing but unhappiness.",
        "\r\nPaul: Okay, Mom, I don't want to hear it. Okay? I know you think that everybody \r\nin the world's against you..",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, not me. Not the rest of the world, either.",
        "\r\nBarbara: All right, I've had my say. I don't want you angry with me.",

        "\r\nRose: You gotta help me quick! I got a big decision to make.",
        "\r\nLily: What is it?",
        "\r\nRose: I've got 14 pairs of earrings, and I've only two ears. And these are the \r\nones that I picked, so of course they must be wrong.",
        "\r\nLily: Oh. Calm down. First of all, tell me where did you get the dress?",
        "\r\nRose: Not from no catalog, I'll tell you that! You like it?",
        "\r\nLily: I think Paul will absolutely adore it.",
        "\r\nRose: I hope so. I mean, not that I'm counting on anything, but -- we're sorta \r\ngetting to that point.",
        "\r\nLily: What point? A serious point?",
        "\r\nRose: I gotta tell you -- it's taking everything in me not to jump on his bones. \r\nIt's not just me, is it? I mean, he is, like, bootylicious.",
        "\r\nLily: He's very attractive, yes.",
        "\r\nRose: That's what I said. So what about the earrings? Come on. Oh, and thank you \r\nfor letting him pick me up here. Because I want your mother to know nothing \r\nabout my personal life, thank you.",
        "\r\nLily: These are perfect.",
        "\r\nRose: The ones I picked? Come on, are you sure?",

        "\r\nLily: What's wrong?",
        "\r\nLucinda: I'll tell you what's wrong. Craig has called an emergency meeting of \r\nWorldwide, all the major stockholders, tonight. That swine -- he thinks he's \r\ngoing to unseat me as CEO, and he's gotta be stopped!",
        "\r\nLily: Rose has an appointment, so I will brainstorm with you as long as you \r\nneed.",

        "\r\nRose: No, I'm sorry, Ms. Walsh. I can't do that.",
        "\r\nLucinda: That's not a simple request. That's an order.",
        "\r\nRose: Now, look, I'm sorry, Ms. Walsh. You know, I'm not some pooch you can yank \r\non a leash and pull her to your heel anytime you need her.",
        "\r\nLily: Let's look at this calmly. Craig does not have enough votes to unseat you.",
        "\r\nLucinda: That's what I thought, darling. That's what I thought. But he's been \r\nvery busy! He's been working the phones, and he's put together a coalition. For \r\nexample, this meeting was called this evening without my approval. That's not a \r\ngood sign.",
        "\r\nRose: Craig needs Barbara's vote to get the shares. It's not gonna happen. \r\nWithout her, he's sunk.",
        "\r\nLucinda: Barbara Ryan is hardly reliable. Rose, I need you to use your influence \r\nwith Mother so she votes for me.",
        "\r\nRose: No! I told you last time -- that's it. I'm not doing this.",
        "\r\nLucinda: Come on. He's very interested in you. It's time to call in your \r\nmarkers.",

        "\r\nBilly: Actually, that's not bad. But what else? Come on, go on!",
        "\r\nJennifer: Magical. Exhilarating. Try inspirational. You see, none of them quite \r\nfit. You know, they just don't do it.",

        "\r\nJennifer: \"Lucky.\" Hmm. Yeah. That's perfect.",
        "\r\nBilly: So, you wanna go",
        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, I would, but my little brother's inside, and I don't wanna leave \r\nhim alone. He's still pretty freaked out about what happened at my mom's last \r\nnight.",
        "\r\nBilly: Yeah, but he can come with us.",
        "\r\nJennifer: I don't think that would be such a good idea.",
        "\r\nBilly: Oh, right. Right. 'Cause he may say something random to Bryant. And then \r\nhe'll wanna know why I was here, and I'll have to say, you know, \"I was just in \r\nthe neighborhood,\" some random excuse like that, huh?",

I think I'm the only one in this town who can see \r\nthat you're not the martyr you're pretending to be. So I'm telling you, get over \r\nyourself, lady! And stop using that veil as a license to hurt people.",

        "\r\nBonnie: Do you see that slob over there? You know, the one whose pants are \r\nflared at both ends? He just ran up a $100 bar tab and left me a $2 tip.",
