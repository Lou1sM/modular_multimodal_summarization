        "Katie is hurt when Brad doesn't believe her when she tells him that Spencer is trying to kill her in order to steal her husband and job. Henry arrives to visit Katie and tells her that she is feeling guilty for doing the same thing to Molly Conlin years ago. Henry advises Katie to stop being paranoid about Spencer and enjoy her life now with Brad. Vienna also suspects that Spencer is hiding something so she and Henry break into Spencer's room at the Lakeview and find a locked box but before they can open it Spencer arrives in her room. Henry and Vienna pretend to be making love in the wrong room and leave quickly. Brad assures Katie that no other woman can replace her in his heart so she agrees to give Spencer another chance. Spencer later tells Brad and Katie that Henry and Vienna broke into her room. Jack tells Janet that he almost slept with Carly and she tells him to give her a call when he has chosen either her or Carly. Parker advises Jack to stop stringing Janet and Carly along and leave them both alone until he can decide which woman he wants in his life. Jack and Carly briefly consider getting back together but decide against it because they can't be sure that their relationship would work this time."

        "Katie: No, no, I'll be fine. It will take you like an hour, right, to prep for tomorrow and then you'll be home.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, but you don't feel fine. Who's going to take care of you?",
        "Katie: Getting everything set for tomorrow is taking care of me. Besides, the studio will be so nice and quiet. No one around --",
        "Brad: Like Spencer?",
        "Katie: Don't start. I don't want to get sick again.",

        "Janet: Okay, now are you sure this is going to be enough food?",
        "Carly: Yes, yeah -- Sage and J.J. are both on sleepovers, so it's just Parker and me.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, in that case, I'll grab some chocolate chip cookies. I know they're his favorite.",
        "Carly: You don't have to do that.",
        "Janet: Uh, I owe you for letting me whine about Jack. Come on, you're good people, Carly.",
        "Carly: Not so much.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? If my ex's new girlfriend popped over and started acting all loony --",
        "Carly: You weren't -- you weren't loony, no.",
        "Janet: I accused you of hiding Jack in your bedroom. I was so wrong and you were so cool. And you were so right.",
        "Carly: You and Jack?",
        "Janet: Well, we're taking it slow, but I do think that we are on the road to getting back together.",

        "Spencer: Are you guys okay in there?",
        "Brad: Katie, she's baring gifts, okay? Why can't we just thank her and send her on her way?",
        "Katie: Uh, because I'm sick as a dog and it's her fault.",
        "Brad: You know what? I have to work with her. I'm going to open the door. If you don't want to see her, then hide.",
        "Brad: Hi.",
        "Spencer: Hi -- I have a knack for finding the worst possible moment. I'm so sorry.",
        "Brad: No, no, that's okay. I just -- I just brought Katie home, I was just getting her settled.",
        "Spencer: Oh, well, can I peek my head in and say hello?",
        "Brad: No, you'll just see her tomorrow. You know, I'm sure she'll feel better by then.",
        "Spencer: Oh, of course. Well, um, can you give her these? The guys who does the flowers on the show said they were her favorites.",
        "Brad: Oh, they are. Oh, they are -- Spencer, that's so sweet. That's really, really sweet. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll see you tomorrow.",

        "Brad: She wants me to give you a hug.",
        "Katie: Oh, God, that was such an act. Dropping by -- bringing flowers, being so sweet. I am not buying it.",
        "Brad: Katie, she got you your favorite flowers, she got you chocolates and a card. You can't honestly believe that she tried to poison you.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, I believe it. And I'll prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Sorry it took me so long, but I decided to throw in some Italian wedding cookies --",
        "Jack: I love those cookies.",
        "Janet: Why do you think I bake them?",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Janet: Welcome --",
        "Carly: I'm going to go. You have fun.",
        "Janet: Finally, she's gone. Now we can kiss and talk about her behind her back.",
        "Jack: Did Carly do something?",
        "Janet: Kiss first.",
        "Jack: Okay, you were -- you were saying about Carly?",
        "Janet: She has been really great -- really great. The other day, I was at her house --",
        "Jack: You know what? Those cookies smell fantastic. Could I get some, and maybe a cup of coffee?",
        "Janet: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but wait, let me tell you the story first --",
        "Jack: You don't have to if you don't want to --",
        "Janet: No, it's funny. It will make you laugh. Okay, check out. So, I go over to her house and she's in a robe. We started talking and all of a sudden, I get this feeling that she's entertaining someone. You know, like a man.",
        "Jack: Oh --",
        "Janet: Yeah, yeah -- so, guess what I do? I accuse her of hiding you in her bedroom. Can you believe I did that? Let me get you some coffee. I mean, thank God she didn't get mad or anything. She was so cool about it. She just let it slide. Oh, my goodness. I mean, thank God I was wrong. Can you manage how awkward it would have been --?",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: You weren't wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: And so when Liberty searched that trash can --",
        "Brad: Liberty? You got my daughter to go dumpster diving?",
        "Katie: She just checked out one little trashcan, Brad. But don't you see? That proves that Spencer doctored the food.",
        "Brad: The food was gone. The only thing that proves is that studio's got good janitors.",
        "Katie: The janitors would have gotten rid of all the trash. The only thing that was missing was the food.",
        "Brad: So your proof is that there is no proof?",
        "Katie: Exactly.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, the doctor said that you got pretty dehydrated. Maybe it parched your brain.",
        "Katie: I'm not dehydrated, Brad. I'm right.",
        "Brad: Spencer wouldn't do something like that.",
        "Katie: You've known her for like five minutes. I'm your wife. Who do you believe?",
        "Brad: I think you're just tired.",
        "Katie: Her or me, Brad? Choose!",
        "Brad: I've got to go. I've got to go. I've got to figure out how to set up this cooking segment tomorrow.",
        "Katie: Why are you taking her side?",
        "Brad: I am on your side and only yours. I don't want you freaking out about this, all right? I want you to stay here and get some rest.",
        "Katie: I would rest better if you would believe me about Spencer.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: It's her again.",
        "Brad: It's not -- it's not her. Henry!",
        "Henry: I brought you soup.",
        "Brad: Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Look, I've got to run to the studio. Can you please do me a favor? Can you stay here with Katie, keep her company. If she starts talking about someone trying to kill her, calm her down.",
        "Katie: Hello! I'm right here.",
        "Brad: I love you. Oh, I love you. I love you, I love you, you're crazy. All right, I'll see you later.",
        "Henry: What's that -- what's --",
        "Katie: You've got to take me to the studio right now --",
        "Henry: Hold on -- whoa, what? Why?",
        "Katie: I have to get the evidence before it's too late.",
        "Henry: No -- just sit down before you fall over, huh?",
        "Katie: I don't have time to be sick. I have to get to the studio before she gets rid of everything.",
        "Henry: I need a simple, declarative sentence. What is going on?",
        "Katie: I think the new girl is trying to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I want to be honest with you. If we're going to be together, I won't lie -- ever.",
        "Janet: Okay. Now, back to Carly --",
        "Jack: I was at her house when you came over.",
        "Janet: Well, were you there to see the kids? Why didn't you just pop out and say hey?",
        "Jack: The kids weren't there. She wanted to talk.",
        "Janet: What about?",
        "Jack: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: And so stupid me eats the Chinese food that she brought. And the next thing that I know I'm being driven home from the studio, and Brad has to do Oakdale Now, live and alone.",
        "Henry: But he wasn't alone.",
        "Katie: I got here, I turn on the TV and that little miss sweet and innocent was doing my show with my husband! So that just proves that she doctored the Chinese food.",
        "Henry: I can see how you would think that.",
        "Katie: Thank you. I knew you would understand.",
        "Henry: Considering we did the exact same thing to Molly Conlon.",
        "Katie: That's totally different.",
        "Henry: True. There were two of us. I spiked her sandwich, and then you went on air in her place and on to fame and glory. No, that's not the same thing at all.",
        "Katie: Okay, fine, so it's karma. I'm getting paid back for every backstabbing thing I ever did.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, it's not karma. Its guilt, its guilt with a little paranoia laced with superstition.",
        "Katie: What do I have to feel guilty about?",
        "Henry: What do you -- look around you. You've got a great job, you've got this great guy who loves you. And it's perfectly reasonable to think that all that's just going disappear. The sins of the past are going to come up and bite you in the behind.",
        "Katie: You feel that way, too? I wake up every morning next to Vienna and I'm going whose life am I living here. Sometimes, you've just got to trust fates and enjoy.",
        "Katie: I was enjoying until Spencer showed up and tried to kill me.",
        "Henry: Okay, maybe you're feeling feverish. I should check your temperature.",
        "Katie: No, you need to take me to the studio.",
        "Henry: Absolutely not.",
        "Katie: Henry, if I'm wrong about Spencer trying to kill me or be after me or whatever, then I need to find out for myself. But I can't do that sitting here. So either loan me your car or drive me.",
        "Henry: Are you sure you're well enough for this?",
        "Katie: Give me the keys or I'm calling Vienna.",
        "Henry: All right, all right, all right. All right, all right. But if Brad tears me limb from limb, you're paying my medical bills.",
        "Katie: Just shut up and drive.",
        "Henry: Yes, Ma'am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker!",
        "Parker: Hey, Mom. The coach called. He wanted to know if you did the design for the t-shirts.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I finished it last night. You know what? Just because it's just the two of us doesn't mean we can act like animals. I'll get some forks and plates, okay?",
        "Parker: I'll get the design. Where is it?",
        "Carly: In my bedroom nightstand. Top drawer. Italian wedding cookies. Hey, just put it on the desk, I'll be sure it's ready for school tomorrow, okay? What is it?",
        "Parker: I found this on the table beside your bed. It's Dad's, isn't it?",
        "Carly: Yes, it is. He must have left it here at some point.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I was in your room yesterday morning, and it wasn't there. Did Dad come over in the afternoon?",
        "Carly: I suppose he did. Sit down. This lasagna looks really good.",
        "Parker: Mom, if Dad was in your bedroom -- does that mean that you guys are -- hooking up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So what did Carly say about me?",
        "Jack: Only good things.",
        "Janet: Good. So when I showed up, you had to run and hide in the bedroom?",
        "Jack: I was already in the bedroom. And it was pretty awkward. So I pretty much just stayed up there.",
        "Janet: Oh. You were already in the bedroom. And Carly was in her robe in the middle of the afternoon. I see.",
        "Jack: Janet, it wasn't anything planned.",
        "Janet: Okay. That's supposed to make me feel better? Just because you didn't plan on having sex with Carly? It just happened?",
        "Jack: No, no, nothing happened. We started, but we stopped.",
        "Janet: Why? Because you had second thoughts? Oh my God. I rang the doorbell. That's why you stopped. Gee, I'm sorry. That must have been really frustrating.",
        "Jack: It wasn't like that.",
        "Janet: Carly was already in her robe. That must have meant you got far enough.",
        "Jack: We stopped. Carly could have ignored the door. But she didn't. Maybe because deep down inside we both knew that it was a mistake.",
        "Janet: What happened after I left?",
        "Jack: Nothing. Janet, nothing happened.",
        "Janet: If I hadn't shown up, would you have --",
        "Jack: You did show up. And it was like a sign. A big fat sign that said, \"Don't do this.\" And we didn't.",
        "Janet: You've been really good about telling the truth to me. And that's exactly what I want right now, Jack. If I hadn't shown up, would you have slept with Carly?",
        "Jack: After you get off work, can we just go somewhere and talk?",
        "Janet: Don't make me wait, Jack. I want to know, if I hadn't shown up, would you have slept with her?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I don't know. You wanted the truth. That is the truth, okay?",
        "Janet: You wanted to.",
        "Jack: Janet, that's nothing new. Since day one, Carly and I -- we've had this chemical thing between us, okay? It's never changed and it looks like it never will.",
        "Janet: Then why are you even with me?",
        "Jack: Because happiness isn't just than having great sex with someone. All right? You make me very happy.",
        "Janet: I make you happy in bed and out?",
        "Jack: Yes, of course.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Jack: Do I have to spell it out for you?",
        "Janet: You just told me that I make you happy. And I want to know why.",
        "Jack: Because I don't have to wonder what you're hiding from me. I don't have to worry if you're really telling me the truth, okay? I can relax with you. I know that what I see with you is who you really are. And I'll never have that with Carly.",
        "Janet: But you wanted to sleep with her. Why?",
        "Jack: Because I miss who I was. I miss being a cop. I miss the house and the life I had there. And for a moment, for a moment, I thought I could go back there. But when that moment passed, I was looking for you.",
        "Janet: I feel like such an idiot.",
        "Jack: Don't, please.",
        "Janet: No, no, no. I spilled my guts to her and you were upstairs the whole time. I thought that she wanted us to be together.",
        "Jack: She does. Janet, she does. Listen, when she followed me out to that island and ended up saving my life -- it was like we went back in time. Back when we meant everything to each other. But it wasn't real. And Carly knew that, that's why she called you. That's why she wanted you to be in that hospital with me instead of her.",
        "Janet: So what am I? Just some convenient wedge that you stick between the two of you when things get too hot?",
        "Jack: Of course not. Are you kidding me? You're more than that. You are so much more than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: There is nothing going on between Jack and me.",
        "Parker: Then why did Dad leave his watch in your bedroom?",
        "Carly: Because, Parker, we know we don't belong together. But sometimes we forget. We forget how miserable we make each other.",
        "Parker: For how long this time? A couple of days? A few of weeks?",
        "Carly: No, this time we stopped it before it even started. Maybe we're getting smarter.",
        "Parker: So?",
        "Carly: So, he's your father, I'm your mother. We're divorced. And it's going to stay that way.",
        "Parker: When I saw this, I started thinking about how great it would be --",
        "Carly: It's not going to happen. I don't want you kids getting your hopes up.",
        "Parker: I'm not as hungry as I thought I was. I'm going to go for a walk.",
        "Carly: No more than an hour, okay? And Parker? Don't be sad about this.",
        "Parker: You either.",

        "Spencer: Katie? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: And you left Katie at the station? You should have gone in with her.",
        "Henry: She told me to leave so she could snoop in private. All right? I don't know why she's doing this to herself. Why she's getting herself all worked up -- what?",
        "Vienna: You're making fun of Katie's womanly instincts.",
        "Henry: Because her womanly instincts are off.",
        "Vienna: No, I don't trust this Spencer person either. Is my instincts off?",
        "Henry: Well -- come here, come here, come here. Where are you going?",
        "Vienna: I am going to prove that Katie and I are right.",
        "Henry: Come here. How are you going to do that?",
        "Vienna: Oh. You and I -- we can have an adventure!",
        "Henry: Oh, an adventure? Oh, okay. Nice costumes? Maybe some special equipment?",
        "Vienna: Equipment! Why didn't I think about that? You're brilliant.",
        "Henry: I am? What'd I say?",
        "Vienna: We have work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I know you want me to trust what you're saying, but there's one little question that keeps popping up into my head. If you and Carly have this chemical connection, how long's it going to be before you give in?",
        "Jack: That's why I have to take it slow, Janet. Because Carly and I -- we meant so much to each other that it's going to take a while to get over it.",
        "Janet: Call me when you do.",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no. It's not your fault that you have feelings for your ex. But I don't want you to want me so that you don't want her.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Janet: Al's diner.",
        "Vienna: Hello, Janet.",
        "Henry: This is a bad idea. We should forget this.",
        "Vienna: Shhh! I'm talking to Janet. Janet, I really want to have an adventure.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Vienna: But Henry says we can't because we have to handle the cash receipts at the diner.",
        "Janet: You want me to do that for you?",
        "Vienna: Would you?",
        "Janet: Sure. Have fun.",
        "Jack: Your shift is over now, right? Let me take you to the lake. We'll talk this through.",
        "Janet: I can't. I've have to run some errands for my boss.",
        "Jack: I'll go with you.",
        "Janet: What's the point?",
        "Jack: Janet, I want to be with you.",

        "Katie: I dropped my pen in the trash. I was just looking for it.",

        "Spencer: Oh, no, I got it.",

        "Brad: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: I felt badly that you were hear prepping on your own. So I thought I could help.",
        "Brad: By digging in the trash?",
        "Spencer: Katie lost her pen. What did it look like, Katie?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter.",
        "Brad: Uh, Maggie wanted me to ask you if you could bring your shoes to the fitting.",
        "Spencer: I'll do that.",
        "Brad: You were supposed to stay home and rest.",
        "Katie: I tried, but I couldn't.",
        "Brad: So, what were you hoping to find? Poisoned egg rolls with Spencer's fingerprints on them?",
        "Katie: Why do you keep sticking up for her?",
        "Brad: Look, you were in the hospital. Do you know how worried I was about you? I mean, how it would kill me if anything happened to you?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I know.",
        "Spencer: Oh, I'm sorry. If you guys need more time, I'll let them know in wardrobe.",

        "Carly: I played you? --",
        "Janet: And don't act innocent. Jack told me he was in your bedroom the whole time.",
        "Carly: Why would he tell you that?",
        "Janet: Because he's honest and you're not.",
        "Carly: Well, gee whiz, the secret's out. Anything else?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I want to know why you did it. Why did you pretend to be my friend?",
        "Carly: I never pretended to be your friend --",
        "Janet: You said, \"Janet, Jack's worth it. Hang in there. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" All the while, you were lying to me about what was really going on.",
        "Carly: There is nothing really going on.",
        "Janet: Oh, really, then why did you get this close to sleeping with him? What would make you want to hurt me the way you did?",
        "Carly: First of all, I'm not the one you're dating. If you want explanations or reasons for anything, you should be talking to Jack.",
        "Janet: You lied to me.",
        "Carly: I didn't tell you he was upstairs. So shoot me. I was just trying to spare your feelings.",
        "Janet: Oh, bull! You were just going to pat me on the head and send me on my merry way and then finish what you started.",
        "Carly: What is the matter with you? You have him. You have Jack in your life, in your bed. That's not enough for you? You need my permission, my approval? Or you just like rubbing my face in it?",
        "Janet: I didn't lie to you.",
        "Carly: I didn't sleep with Jack, so back the hell off!",
        "Janet: But you wanted to! And I would be okay with that. But he wants you too! And I want him! Damn it!",
        "Carly: Do you want a cookie?",
        "Janet: I want to get Jack out of my system.",
        "Carly: Well, if you figure out how to do that, let me know.",
        "Janet: You should have told me he was here.",
        "Carly: It surprised me. Feeling those feelings again. I thought we were done. I'd see him and all I'd feel was relief.",
        "Janet: Relief?",
        "Carly: That it was gone. My need for him. And it felt really good to not hurt so much anymore. And then, I saw him and -- feelings came flooding back. Surprise.",
        "Janet: You want to get back with him?",
        "Carly: I'm not good for him. You are. I really believe that. I want him to be happy. I think you could make him happy. That's why I've been trying to get the two of you together.",
        "Janet: Do you realize how twisted you sound?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I can do this. You don't need to be here.",
        "Henry: I can't let you break and enter on your own, okay? What if you get caught?",
        "Vienna: I won't. Because I have your special equipment.",
        "Henry: This is a waste of time. All right? It was food poisoning. It happens all the time. It doesn't mean Spencer's involved in some kind of illegal activity.",
        "Vienna: It's not working!",
        "Henry: Move aside.",
        "Vienna: You are so talented.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker --",
        "Parker: Hey, I need to talk to you.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Parker: Um, I found this on the table beside Mom's bed.",
        "Jack: Don't read into this, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah. That's exactly what Mom said.",
        "Jack: Well, thanks for bringing it back.",
        "Parker: Listen, Dad, I've got to ask you. What are you doing?",
        "Jack: About?",
        "Parker: Well, you gave me this whole talk about being straight with girls and respecting what they want.",
        "Jack: Yeah, is there a problem with that?",
        "Parker: No, but it kind of seems like you have a problem with it.",
        "Jack: If this is about your mom and me --",
        "Parker: Look, I thought you were together with Janet. And from what Liberty tells me, that is a huge deal for her mom.",
        "Jack: It is for me, too. Believe me.",
        "Parker: Then why are you hanging around the house again? Especially if it's like you and Mom say it is -- and it's nothing? I mean, what are you doing?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Parker: Yeah, maybe you shouldn't do anything until you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Listen, I take some of the responsibility for this. I mean, dropping in on you like we were a couple of pals.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Why did you do that?",
        "Janet: 'Cause I've never had a guy like Jack before. And I didn't want to blow it with him. And since you know him better than anybody --",
        "Carly: Since I've loved him and lost him, you figured I was the expert on how not to do that.",
        "Janet: Sounds kind of stupid when you say it out loud, but yeah. Yeah. And I was grateful for the advice. I was so grateful I missed the obvious.",
        "Carly: You didn't need it.",
        "Janet: No. That you weren't really looking out for me, you were looking out for yourself. 'Cause see, you don't know if you want Jack or not, so you just kind of threw me up against the wall and see if I'd stick. Kind of like spaghetti.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I guess that's part of it.",
        "Janet: What's the rest?",
        "Carly: Jack was married to Katie. And he had a chance to have a really happy life. I ruined it. So I suppose I saw you as sort of second chance for him. And for me to make it up to him.",
        "Janet: I don't think I want you and Jack to use me like that.",
        "Carly: Janet. No matter -- no matter how I feel about Jack, I really do think that you could be good for him.",
        "Janet: So do I. But I'm a big girl. And from now on, I'm going to handle my own relationships. And if I decide to go there with him, it'll be on my terms, not yours.",
        "Carly: Just don't let what happened yesterday affect you guys, okay?",
        "Janet: Hey, you know what? You gotta forget about me, okay? Concentrate on you, and if you want to go after Jack, go for it. But just stay out of my business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You're jealous, aren't you? Do you think Spencer can steal me away from you?",
        "Katie: No -- I just remember what it was like when we first started working together. And I was falling in love with you, but I didn't know it. We spent so much time together, that I couldn't help but see all the wonderful things about you.",
        "Brad: The way you and I fell in love, it's not like a recipe. Where if you don't have buttermilk, you can use sour cream and it tastes like the same thing. There is no one else for me but you.",
        "Katie: I'm your buttermilk?",
        "Brad: My one and only. So can you, please, ease up on Spencer?",
        "Katie: You like her.",
        "Brad: I like this show. I think it could be a hit. Help a lot of people. But if Spencer starts wigging out because she thinks you hate her --",
        "Katie: Then it won't work.",
        "Brad: So can you try to be nice so I can keep bringing home two paychecks?",
        "Katie: I don't know. What's in it for me?",
        "Brad: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: There is nothing here.",
        "Vienna: Oh, yes there is. It's heavy. Open it. Let's see what's inside.",
        "Henry: This is a serious lock. I can't just jimmy that.",
        "Spencer: What are you doing?",
        "Vienna: Kissing. What are you doing here, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: This is my room!",
        "Henry: This is your room? Oh, that's so embarrassing. Oh, I'm so sorry.",
        "Vienna: What a terrible mistake.",

        "Parker: No, no, no. I'm good. I've got my bike.",
        "Carly: He's growing up too fast.",
        "Jack: That's partially our fault. My fault. I'm sorry I left this where he would see it.",
        "Carly: He asked me about us. I thought he understood. I didn't realize that he would come to you.",
        "Jack: He said it wasn't fair that I was seeing you while I was seeing Janet.",
        "Carly: But you're not seeing me.",
        "Jack: We almost had sex, Carly.",
        "Carly: But we didn't.",
        "Jack: But we would have.",
        "Carly: Janet paid me a little visit today. You know, if you were going to tell her what happened, Jack, you could have warned me.",
        "Jack: I couldn't lie to her, Carly.",
        "Carly: She's important to you. You should let her be.",
        "Jack: You think so?",
        "Carly: I think being alone is hard. Especially after --",
        "Jack: After you've had a such good marriage. And you know what you're missing.",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Carly: What are we doing?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Well, we should stop, you know? Before someone gets hurt.",

        "Brad: Why would she show up here now?",
        "Katie: I don't know. She always seems to find a reason.",
        "Brad: Hi.",
        "Spencer: I'm sorry. I keep barging in on you guys. And I didn't want to, but I really needed someone to talk to. I don't understand what's happening to me.",
        "Brad: Come on in.",
        "Katie: What's the problem now?",
        "Spencer: Somebody broke into my room.",
        "Brad: Again?",
        "Katie: Did you call the police?",
        "Spencer: Well, I didn't think you'd want me to.",
        "Brad: Why --",
        "Spencer: Because the people who broke into my room were your friends.",
        "Brad: Henry and Vienna?",
        "Spencer: Did you send them to spy on me?",
        "Brad: No, I mean, I didn't. Katie?",
        "Katie: No! I didn't. I swear. I don't know. It must have been a misunderstanding.",
        "Spencer: I thought you were mad at me, so -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever I did.",
        "Katie: Spencer, come here. No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm not mad at you. And I'm sorry, whatever Vienna and Henry did, it won't happen again.",
