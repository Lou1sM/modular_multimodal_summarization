        "Simon: Go home, Carly. Look, I let you down, okay? I lied to you about where I got the money. And I betrayed your trust. But hell, I'd probably do it all over again just to put that smile back on your face. Now it was wrong, and you deserve better. But you have every right to walk out on me and this partnership.",
        "Carly: You're right about that, I do.",
        "Simon: You know, I just thought that if anyone could pull this off, get that building up and running, the units sold, the loan paid back, it was us. But if this is as far as you think you can go, I totally understand.",

        "Katie: Michael Kasnoff --",
        "Mike: No, no, no, it's not too late to call. They're all in? You're sure? Well, thank you. I really appreciate it.",
        "Katie: Who was that?",
        "Mike: Doctor's office.",
        "Katie: At this hour?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I did the lab tech a favor when I was building that new wing. Anyway, she said she'd stay late and have someone from the office to call me.",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Mike: The results of our fertility tests. They're in.",

        "Lily: Rose was so good to our children.",
        "Holden: That's 'cause she loved them.",
        "Lily: And her daughter, Theresa, is out there somewhere, and we can't find her. I know something is wrong, I can just feel it.",
        "Holden: Well, we have a private investigator looking into it. He's doing the best he can.",
        "Lily: Has he called?",
        "Holden: No. But you've got to give him some time. It's a big country out there.",
        "Lily: Yeah. We should hire a team of investigators. [Doorbell rings] Maybe that's him. Who knows?",
        "Theresa: Mrs. Snyder?",

        "Casey: It's quiet.",
        "Maddie: It's closed.",
        "Casey: How do you know? Did you check the hours?",
        "Maddie: Well, even if it's open, Jade was fired from there. She's not exactly welcome.",
        "Casey: So maybe she's meeting her on the steps.",
        "Maddie: For what? Jade had Gwen on the phone. She could've told her what she needed to tell her. Why insist that she meets her? It's not like they're friends.",
        "Casey: Maybe she had to give her something.",
        "Maddie: Like what?",
        "Casey: I don't know --",
        "Maddie: I think we should call Will.",
        "Casey: No, don't call Will. Gwen said she didn't want him involved.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but if something happens -- what if something happens? Then you're going to feel terrible.",
        "Casey: What's going to happen? They're meeting at a library.",
        "Maddie: This is Jade we're talking about. Anything can happen. I think we should call Will.",

        "Will: Jade was supposed to wait for me. I was picking up her meds. And now she's gone, and you won't tell me where or why.",
        "Luke: Look, Will, why don't you just call Jade?",
        "Will: Why don't you stop blowing me off and tell me what's going on? I know you know. Where is she, and why did she leave?",
        "[Luke remembering]",
        "Luke: This proves that you're not pregnant? I'm gonna go make a copy of it.",
        "Jade: Well, the hospital said --",
        "Luke: And I am gonna keep it. And if you don't tell Will, I will show him this.",

        "Luke: This? Nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Where were you? I was calling you, and you didn't answer. Plus, the library is closed -- we probably shouldn't even be here. Is there anyone else here?",
        "Jade: No. We're all alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Theresa?",
        "Theresa: Mrs. Snyder --",
        "Lily: Oh, no, please -- call me Lily. You can call me your Aunt Lily, because I'm your mother's sister. I've been trying to find you.",
        "Holden: Theresa, come in.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm sorry please, come in. I'm so sorry. Please sit down. I'm just so astonished to see you -- to see you at our doorstep -- to see your face. My gosh. I'm so happy to meet you. How did you find us?",
        "Theresa: I spoke to the private investigator you hired.",
        "Lily: Where?",
        "Theresa: I've been living in Chicago -- going to the university? He told me you were looking for me, which is why I'm here. I thought -- given the circumstances that it would be better for me to come in person.",
        "Holden: What circumstances?",
        "Lily: Well, remember, Theresa wasn't sure she wanted to meet her birth mother's family. Sister Elizabeth told me that you were a little unsure, you had some misgivings. I'm so glad you changed your mind and came to talk to us. I'm so happy to see your face. You must have been so disappointed to find out that your mother had passed away.",
        "Theresa: Yes, it was -- very disappointing. And at the time, I was applying to college, I had so many decisions to make. It just seemed to make more sense to move on. So, I put the records away.",
        "Lily: I can understand that completely.",
        "Theresa: Only they turned out to be stolen. Apparently, this girl I met at the orphanage, who was really very kind to me. She was there when I found out that your sister had died and she was very sympathetic. But then I found out that she stole my records and came here and pretended to be me.",
        "Lily: You mean Jade.",
        "Theresa: Yes.",
        "Holden: So you knew about that?",
        "Theresa: Not at first. Sister Elizabeth wrote to me and told me what had happened. I think she was trying to get me to contact you, but the letter went to my old address, and it was months before it reached me at school. So that's why I didn't call you, and I should have. I'm really -- I'm very sorry.",
        "Lily: Its okay, I'm just happy that you're here now.",
        "Theresa: Yeah, about that. The thing is, the reason I didn't call you or come here is because -- I found her. I found my birth mother.",
        "Lily: You've seen Rose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Luke, those are Jade's medical records.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and they're private. And she asked me to hold onto this copy for her.",
        "Will: She's carrying my child. If something's wrong, then I have a right to know --",
        "Luke: Will -- Will, I already told you, there's nothing about a baby in here, it's something completely different, she just has the flu.",
        "Will: Which is why you called me and told me to come down here?",
        "Luke: I know, I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Okay?",
        "Will: You know what, I thought we were friends.",
        "Luke: We are, it's just -- look, why don't you just -- just talk to Jade.",
        "Will: I'd love to, but she's not here!",
        "Doctor: You boys want to keep it down?",
        "Lucy: Luke, is there a problem?",
        "Luke: No, everything's fine.",
        "Will: A friend of mine just checked herself out and I need to -- Luke!",
        "Lucy: You better keep it down, or they're gonna kick you out of here, okay? What's going on?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Will, hey, it's Casey. Gwen asked me not to call you, but Maddie and I think that something's a little off.",
        "Will: What happened?",
        "Casey: Well, Jade called Gwen and asked her to meet her at the library a little while ago.",
        "Maddie: Which is closed. We called and got the hours off the machine.",
        "Casey: So, anyway, Jade made it sound kind of urgent. And I thought you should know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I think we need to get a few things straight.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Jade: Like I'm pregnant, and there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "Gwen: I'm not trying to do anything about it.",
        "Jade: You called the clinic. You tried to get my medical records. You told Will that I was faking this pregnancy, that I was lying to him.",
        "Gwen: I didn't tell anybody anything. I had some questions, Will and I both did.",
        "Jade: Well, it's none of your business.",
        "Gwen: He's my husband --",
        "Jade: Not anymore. And it's not my fault. He would've done anything for you. He stepped up when you were pregnant with a kid you didn't even want -- with a kid you gave away.",
        "Gwen: This conversation is over.",
        "Jade: Because it is different between me and Will. Family is important to us. And we are gonna make sure that our child is surrounded by all kinds of family. By brothers and sisters.",
        "Gwen: Brothers and sisters? What are you talking about?",
        "Jade: What? You think Will is just gonna walk away from me when I put this child in his arms? He's gonna marry me, Gwen. And we're gonna have the kind of life that I've always wanted -- with a big house and a big yard and lots of kids.",
        "Gwen: I don't think so, Jade. He doesn't even love you.",
        "Jade: I know, he loves you. But look where that got him -- nowhere. Because you've always had one foot out the door since day one. Because you don't know what it's like to love somebody. You were in it for you -- to make yourself feel better. \"Look, somebody loves me. I guess I'm not the troll I thought I was.\"",
        "Gwen: You're sick.",
        "Jade: There she goes! There goes Gwen, as soon as it's hard. Well, guess what? I'm not going anywhere. Because I love Will, and I will do anything to keep him. Anything!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gwen: It's Will.",
        "Jade: Don't answer it.",

        "Jade: Because I'm not finished.",

        "Katie: No, you know what? There's this procedure that I've been reading about online that they're doing in Sweden. And they do something to your eggs, or -- I don't remember exactly. Anyway, they have incredible results. And if that doesn't work, then we'll adopt. There are so many kids all around the world who don't have parents, and --",
        "Mike: Katie --",
        "Katie: No, it's fine. It doesn't matter where our baby comes from, because it will be our baby. We love each other, and we want a family and that's what's important.",
        "Mike: Okay, and we're gonna have one the old fashioned way.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Mike: Everything came back fine. All the tests were negative. We just have to let nature take its course.",
        "Katie: We can have a baby?",
        "Mike: Mm-hmm, we can half a dozen.",
        "Katie: I'm so happy! Hey!",
        "Mike: Hey! What was that for?",
        "Katie: You let me think that something was wrong!",
        "Mike: You took yourself there.",
        "Katie: And you let me go.",
        "Mike: I know. It's just kind of sweet how you were trying to keep me from being disappointed. You know? Even though you want this baby as much as I do.",
        "Katie: You want this baby, really? Well, because I feel like I've been pressuring you so much.",
        "Mike: No, you've been trying to force me to do things your way. It doesn't mean that I don't want a family. I love kids. All right? And I love you.",
        "Katie: I love you.",
        "Mike: Let's go home.",
        "Katie: Okay. Carly, hey.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Carly: I'm looking for Gwen. Have you seen her?",
        "Mike: Oh, she left just a little while ago.",
        "Katie: Is everything okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah -- well, it will be. Now that I'm finished with Simon Frazier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: I need to see you. Never mind what it's about. I need to talk to you about something -- now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You think we should call Gwen and tell her that we talked to Will?",
        "Casey: No. He's her husband. He'll handle it.",
        "Maddie: Okay, I guess we did what we could. So, how's your roommate?",
        "Casey: Elwood? He's good -- full of surprises. You met him, right? At the party?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I did.",
        "Casey: So, how are things here? You settling in all right? My parents behaving themselves?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah, it's been great -- they're very supportive, especial your mom. She took me shopping the other day. We had a girl's day, and she's been really great. And I've always loved this room.",
        "Casey: Yeah, the room -- it looks great.",
        "Maddie: Yep, it's -- great, it's all -- great.",
        "Casey: Okay, I should probably --",
        "Maddie: Please don't. Don't go. I know its excruciating being here with me. But I'm doing the best I can.",
        "Casey: It's not excruciating --",
        "Maddie: Are you kidding me? We're talking to each other like we're just meeting for the first time. It's painful.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's a little awkward.",
        "Maddie: I know, I feel like I have -- like, no skin or I smell. Do I smell?",
        "Casey: You smell like applesauce.",
        "Maddie: Applesauce?",
        "Casey: Yeah. I thought it was your shampoo. And then when you moved out, I bought some --",
        "Maddie: You bought my shampoo?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I liked the smell. But that wasn't it. It was just you -- just the way you smell -- you smell like applesauce. And vanilla milkshakes. And ginger snaps --",
        "Maddie: You're just hungry.",
        "Casey: Maybe. But, I like all those things. And I like the way you smell. And I like the way you look. And I like the things you say. And I know that doesn't help. That you're still not recovered 100%, but you're getting there.",
        "Maddie: You think?",
        "Casey: It's like, a solid 85.",
        "Maddie: I get a \"B\"?",
        "Casey: Last week, you would have had to retake the course, so just --",
        "Maddie: Like somebody has to retake Calculus?",
        "Casey: Oh, who's a jokester.",
        "Maddie: You really think I'm getting better?",
        "Casey: Without a doubt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Rose? You've seen Rose?",
        "Theresa: I'm sorry -- I thought. I thought Rose D'Angelo had died --",
        "Holden: Which is why my wife is so surprised.",
        "Theresa: I'm so sorry -- I didn't mean to confuse you. No, no. I haven't seen your sister, Rose. Let me explain. About a year ago, I'd just started school. And this woman showed up at my dorm. My roommate answered the door. She'd never met my parents, and she turned around and told me my mom was there. This woman -- she just looked so much like me. Anyway, she said she was my birth mother -- that she'd seen my picture online --",
        "Lily: Wait, wait. Wait a minute --",
        "Theresa: I know, it sounds impossible --",
        "Lily: It's impossible, because Rose is your mother.",
        "Theresa: And that's what I told Marianne. That's her name. Anyway, then she told me her story. That she'd gotten pregnant out of wedlock -- that's what they called it. She was just 15. Can you imagine? And her parents were very religious and more than a little racist. They didn't want her marrying a black man. And so, they sent her to the orphanage of the Little Flower in Hoboken where she had me. She knew your sister. They were friends.",
        "Lily: What about the documents -- the birth records?",
        "Theresa: I showed those to Marianne. And then she showed me what the nuns had given her and then her own medical records. And it didn't make sense. The blood types -- it was impossible. And she was just so like me, like we're both math freaks. She's got a degree in engineering -- that's my major. And so, that's when we decided to do a blood test, or a DNA test. Mrs. Snyder, I'm so sorry to disappoint you. But Marianne is my mother.",
        "Lily: I don't understand --",
        "Theresa: I'm not your niece. But I think I know who is.",

        "Gwen: If you broke my phone -- whoa, whoa, whoa -- get your hands off me.",
        "Jade: Not until you get it through your thick head that you and Will are through. You walked out on him, and there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "Gwen: Go to hell!",
        "Jade: Gwen!",

        "Theresa: I think Jade is your niece.",
        "Lily: It's not possible.",
        "Theresa: I know it's a lot to take in. I didn't believe it at first, either. But the DNA test was conclusive.",
        "Lily: Theresa, I think that's great. If you have evidence that Marianne is your mother, I think she's a very lucky woman. But if you're not Rose's daughter, that doesn't mean that Jade is.",
        "Holden: What makes you think that Jade is Rose's daughter?",
        "Theresa: Well, for one thing, Jade and I were born within a few days of each other. We were the only babies of mixed race at the orphanage. And it isn't the first time that paperwork has gotten mixed up. The office is staffed by volunteers. I'm really very sorry I didn't contact you sooner, but when Marianne came into my life, I realized that if I wasn't Rose D'Angelo's daughter, it had to be Jade. And I assumed that you would have done a DNA test, and Jade would be surprised and happy to find out that she really was Rose's daughter after all. But then your private investigator called me, and I -- I knew I had to come talk to you.",
        "Holden: Well, we haven't done a test, and until we do, we won't know for sure.",
        "Lily: Luke?",
        "Luke: Sorry, I didn't mean to slam the door. And didn't mean to interrupt, either.",
        "Holden: No, no, it's all right. This is --",
        "Lily: Do you know -- do you know where Jade is?",
        "Luke: No. I mean, I was with her earlier. She wasn't feeling well, so I took her to the hospital.",
        "Lily: The hospital? Is she all right?",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, she's fine. It was just, uh, the flu.",
        "Lily: What is that?",
        "Luke: Um, this is Jade's medical record. And I know I probably shouldn't have made a copy of it, but I just \u0096",

        "Will: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Hello? Yeah, my name is Will Munson. There's been an accident at the Oakdale library. We need an ambulance immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I think you're right. I think I am better -- than I was. Talking to a therapist really helps. I want to say that she's accepting, but that's not really the right word. All I know is, I tell her these things, and she doesn't even flinch.",
        "Casey: I think that you were always scared of how people would react, you know? That's why you got so freaked out when memories came back. You were afraid to talk to anyone.",
        "Maddie: He threatened to kill me if I told.",
        "Casey: You don't have to worry about that anymore.",
        "Maddie: Yeah. At first, I thought that that would fix everything, that since Louis was dead, I had nothing to be scared of anymore. But I was still scared.",
        "Casey: But talking about it helps?",
        "Maddie: Every time I sit, and I say the words to the therapist, and I know she hears them, it seems like it gets a little bit easier to admit what happened.",
        "Casey: It's because you're not alone with it anymore.",
        "Maddie: Maybe you're right. Casey -- and you can say no, I think maybe I need to tell you what happened.",
        "Casey: Okay. I mean, you don't have to. It's fine if you never want to tell me.",
        "Maddie: I know. But I think you need to know. And I really want to be close to you. And I think that you need to know what happened, in case things are difficult for me.",

        "Katie: Well, don't be. What did he do, lie to you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, he lied. This whole project has been a lie. After all the investors backed out, and after the natural disaster, Simon went to Lucinda, who, of course, turned him down.",
        "Mike: That's my fault. Lucinda came to me asking questions about the building, and I told her that Simon wasn't up to code. I should have told you about it.",
        "Carly: But Simon didn't tell me that Lucinda passed down the project. He went to a loan shark, and he had a suitcase full of money, and then he told me that that money came from Lucinda.",
        "Mike: Ow.",
        "Carly: Yes. I feel like such an idiot.",
        "Katie: Don't. Simon is a conman, and he's a good one. Everybody wants to believe him.",
        "Mike: Still, I should have told you about Lucinda. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: You know what? It wouldn't have made a difference. It's done, over.",
        "Katie: Good, because Simon can only bring you down. He cannot be trusted.",
        "Carly: I know. I know that now. And you tried to warn me, and I didn't listen?",
        "Katie: Oh, please. Look who you're talking to. I followed the man halfway across the world.",
        "Carly: I just feel so stupid. Oh, and the things that I said to Jack. I defended Simon left and right, and Jack was just trying to help me.",
        "Mike: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I think he might be a little thrilled that you quit.",
        "Mike: What's Simon gonna do? What's gonna happen to the building?",

        "Simon: No. But hey, listen, thanks for your consideration.",
        "Spirro: He doesn't want the loan. You already took the loan, Bozo.",

        "Spirro: He's reconsidered. Okay. You don't want the money?",
        "Simon: Yeah. No, Spirro. For the cheap seats here, you're right, I don't want the money.",
        "Spirro: Fine. Just give me back the principal, plus interest, and I'll call it a day.",
        "Simon: Interest? I had the money for, like, five minutes.",
        "Spirro: Which is why I'm only charging you 40 grand.",
        "Simon: 40 -- 40 grand? Are you -- are you really with this guy? You're crazy!",
        "Spirro: Going rate.",
        "Simon: You know what, Spirro? The only thing going here right now is you, all right? We're done. Get out.",
        "Spirro: You got two options, Simon. Boys? You either pay me what you owe me now, or we're back where we started -- principal, plus 100 grand in 30 days. What's it gonna be?",

        "Katie: Well, at least you know where you stand.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'll be standing in the unemployment line. I'm jobless. And I just spent months working for a man who owes me money that he'll never pay me.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. He owes you? Forget it.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, he was gonna pay me after he sold the units. I'm a sucker, right?",

        "Carly: But nobody knows who I am anymore, Katie?",
        "Mike: Yeah, but they will. You've been very successful in your field. You've got a good family, friends, kids.",
        "Katie: Yeah, your kids are so great. You're so lucky. They're sweet and healthy and beautiful.",
        "Carly: Yeah. That's true. I do have great kids. You know something? I'm gonna go home now, and I'm gonna kiss their beautiful, sticky little faces.",

        "Simon: I'm not gonna pay your interest, Spirro. Now, you can take your money and the two ladies here and get out.",
        "Spirro: What do I look like, a bank? What's mine is mine. You borrow it, you pay. Those are the terms.",
        "Simon: Which is why I am not taking the money.",
        "Spirro: You want to explain this situation to my friend here? [They beat up Simon] [Simon groans] Pick him up. I want to make sure Mr. Frasier understands his situation. Hey, Outback, you with us?",
        "Simon: Is violence really the answer, Spirro?",
        "Spirro: Just the kind of guy I am. Now, pay attention. I'm gonna assume you're sticking with plan \"A.\" I get repaid in full, plus interest, in 30 days. We good? I'm gonna take that as a yes. Oh, and here's your money.",

        "Maddie: I really loved my bedroom at Eve's house. It wasn't quite as big as this one, but it was my own. I had to share a room always with one of my sisters when I was growing up, so I was happy that I got my own room at Eve's. I hung posters --",
        "Casey: Of old movies?",
        "Maddie: Are there any other kind? And I -- I found these great Chinese lanterns at a discount store, and I put silk scarves and peacock feathers all over it. It was very dramatic.",
        "Casey: What a shock.",
        "Maddie: Nobody ever really bothered me, except -- Louis would stop by, stand in the doorway, um, ask me a question, or you know -- and then, as time went on, he would start coming in, and he would sit on my desk chair. We'd talk about old movies. And he liked the war ones. Then one night, he came in, and he closed the door, and he locked it. And before I could even ask him why he was locking us in, he gave me this really weird look, which stopped me cold. And then he said, \"It'll be fun.\" And I was, \"what would be fun?\" And then he -- he pushed me onto the bed, which shocked me. And he got on top of me. And I tried to push him off, but I -- I couldn't. I tried to hit him, but that just made him mad. He -- he slapped me and tore my shirt and put his hands everywhere. I screamed, but he put his hand over my mouth. And I had a knife from dinner on my nightstand, and I reached for it, but it fell. I just -- I stared at the ceiling the whole time, so I didn't have to look at his face. I had -- I had this poster from my favorite movie, \"Picnic in the Park,\" on my wall, and I just kept staring at it. And just kind of went away. Afterwards, Louis told me not to tell anyone, or I would regret it. I was -- he left, and I was bleeding, which really scared me. So I went to the hospital, but they kept asking me all kinds of questions, so I left.",
        "Casey: Where'd you go?",
        "Maddie: Home. Well, back to Eve's house. But the next morning, I called Henry, and I asked him if I could come here. And he tried to talk me out of it, but I begged him, because I couldn't stay there. I knew that he would be watching me, and she would figure it out, and I couldn't do that to her. So I thought I could come here and forget everything, and it would be okay. That's why I lied to you about being a virgin, 'cause I -- I didn't want to admit that things had changed.",
        "Casey: Maddie, you didn't lie to me. And I'm not saying that nothing changed, 'cause of course it did. But what happened to you was rape. Maddie, you're still a virgin.",
