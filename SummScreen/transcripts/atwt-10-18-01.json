        "\r\nJennifer: The Old Mill. It's the oldest building in Oakdale. Sometimes in the \r\nsummer, you can still smell the oats.",

        "\r\nBilly: Well, it's much better here than at the Diner, you know. Everybody \r\nstaring at you over their BLTs. Especially when saying \"good-bye\" is the last \r\nthing you want to say to each other.",

        "\r\nLucinda: Yes, I'm panicking a little bit. Wouldn't you? If I don't have Barbara \r\nRyan's vote, I -- I -- I'm a dead duck. You can serve me up with orange slices \r\nto Craig Montgomery. Oh, I hate him, I hate him.",

        "\r\nCraig: My handicap? Well, gentleman, it ain't my driver; I'll tell you that. \r\nI'll see you --",

        "\r\nCraig: -- Inside.",
        "\r\nLucinda: I knew you could come through for me. You always do. Thank you, \r\ndarling. I'm going to have to call you back. Well, golf? Isn't it a little \r\nchilly for golf?",
        "\r\nCraig: Not in Hilton head. But it might get a little chilly in there, hmm? You \r\nknow, getting what you want may not be so easy after tonight, Lucinda? Sorry \r\nabout that.",
        "\r\nLucinda: Why don't you stuff it, your solicitude, all right? Just stuff it. I \r\nknow my people. My people are loyal to me. And they should be, all the money \r\nthey made, because -- I mean, anyway, darling, they wouldn't want a wildcard \r\nlike you.",

        "\r\nLucinda: Darling, the bigger mistake is me walking in there in that boardroom to \r\nbe humiliated because I don't have your mother's vote! It was a deal. You \r\npromised.",

        "\r\nRose: You gotta be kidding me.",
