        "\r\nHal: What's in there?",
        "\r\nEmily: Well, I know you've been a little preoccupied, you know? But it's like \r\nthe depression in here, Hal.",
        "\r\nHal: Slim pickings, huh?",
        "\r\nEmily: Well, you tell me. What can we possibly do with two slices of moldy \r\ncheese and half a lemon?",
        "\r\nHal: A-ha! Tell me there's not a jar of jelly in that door?",
        "\r\nEmily: There better be, 'cause if you want to keep me hanging around here, you \r\ngotta be better than this, buddy.",
        "\r\nHal: Oh, yeah?",
        "\r\nEmily: Yeah, especially if we're gonna keep working up an appetite.",
        "\r\nHal: Well, then, I better get to the supermarket, 'cause you ain't seen nothing \r\nyet.",
        "\r\nEmily: Oh, yeah?",
        "\r\nHal: Yeah.",

        "\r\nBarbara: Look at you, not even ashamed. You lied? You promised me a quid pro quo \r\nwhen you had no intention whatsoever of staying away from my son!",
        "\r\nRose: Oh, come on, Ms. Ryan. You're a businesswoman. You know what this is \r\ncalled. What is that word? I can't remember. Oh, \"corporate culture.\"",
        "\r\nBarbara: This is reversible. I will change my vote.",
        "\r\nRose: Go ahead. You know what? I don't care. If you think that Craig Montgomery \r\ncan handle this company, that's fine. But I will not be blackmailed by you to \r\nstay away from your son. I like Paul. I like him, and I'm not gonna stop seeing \r\nhim for you or anybody else.",
        "\r\nBarbara: You lousy, lowlife, Jersey gutter --",
        "\r\nRose: Yeah, you got that right. I'm Jersey. I'm Jersey through and through. And \r\nI'm proud of it. You want to talk about class? You got about as much class as a \r\nbroad with five inches of slip hanging below her skirt. Your son has taken such \r\ngood care of you since your accident. He's so sad. He's like given up his whole \r\nlife for you. And what do you do? How do you repay him? You try to take away the \r\nlittle bit of life he's carved out for himself. How is he gonna feel when he \r\nfinds out that you tried to take away all his choices right out from underneath \r\nhim?",
        "\r\nPaul: What's going on? Everything okay?",
        "\r\nRose: Should you tell your son what we were talking about, Ms. Ryan, or should \r\nI?",

        "\r\nCarly: Just back this up a second, okay, Jack? You're not even 100% sure that \r\nJames Steinbeck is around, and yet, you want me to start living my life like the \r\nguy is out to get me?",
        "\r\nJack: I trust my instincts, Carly. I've been sensing danger around you for \r\nweeks, and then, I saw him.",
        "\r\nCarly: You saw him? Where?",
        "\r\nJack: Jake and Molly's wedding, after I took out that guy who was after Luke. It \r\nwas just for a second. In a lightning flash, I saw him.",
        "\r\nCarly: In a split second flash of lightning?",
        "\r\nJack: I know how it sounds, but then Hal told me that he'd cut a deal with the \r\nfeds. All the charges against him were dropped, Carly. He's free now to go \r\nanywhere, do anything.",
        "\r\nCarly: Jack, there are plenty of other places he could go to stir up trouble.",
        "\r\nJack: Look. Just smoked Havana, one of Steinbeck's calling cards. I found it \r\nhere on the very grounds he used to own!",
        "\r\nCarly: Okay. Okay, Jack. Let's just say, for the sake of argument that James \r\nSteinbeck is back. What on earth would he want with me, huh? David is the one \r\nwho threw me into that trunk, remember? Not James.",
        "\r\nJack: I realize that, but things have changed.",
        "\r\nCarly: Like what?",
        "\r\nJack: You're involved with Barbara now and James' son, Paul.",
        "\r\nCarly: So what?",
        "\r\nJack: So maybe Steinbeck doesn't want that. Look, Carly, I'm not saying all this \r\nto scare you.",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, you are scaring me, Jack.",
        "\r\nJack: I'm looking for answers so I can protect you. I'm trying to figure this \r\nout so you don't have to be scared.",
        "\r\nCarly: It's not me I'm afraid for. It's you. I hate to say this. I think you're \r\nlosing it.",

        "\r\nJennifer: What happened here?",
        "\r\nBryant: That's not fair. I asked you first. If you've got something to say, \r\nspill it.",
        "\r\nBilly: Do you want me to tell him?",
        "\r\nBryant: \"Him\" is right here. \"Him\" wants an answer to the question.",
        "\r\nJennifer: You're right, Bry. Something happened. Billy and I do need to tell you \r\nsomething, and there really is no easy way to say it, so -- I think you already \r\nknow how much I care about you.",
        "\r\nBryant: Save the pretty speeches, Jen. Cut to the chase.",
        "\r\nJennifer: I think maybe you should go outside. This is between Bryant and me.",
        "\r\nBryant: It was between us. It shoulda stayed that way. See, that -- that is the \r\nproblem. Because now, Billy is involved, too. Right? I saw you guys tonight. I \r\nsaw you at the Old Mill.",

        "\r\nBryant: Come one step closer, and you will regret it. ",
        "\r\nBryant: This is how you treat me? Your cousin, your best friend? I gave you a \r\nplace to stay. I gave you a job when you were just bumming around doing nothing. \r\nAnd this is how you pay me back?",
        "\r\nBilly: It isn't that --",
        "\r\nBryant: You ate my food. You drank my beer. You listened to me yammer about my \r\ngirlfriend problems. I even asked you once if she was seeing somebody else!",
        "\r\nBilly: Look, I didn't mean --",
        "\r\nBryant: I guess we know the answer to that one, don't we?",
        "\r\nBilly: Bryant, I didn't mean it to happen like this, okay? You know, I can only \r\nimagine how you feel --",

        "\r\nBryant: Yeah, well here's your big chance to do it.",
        "\r\nJennifer: It's -- it's no good. You deserve more than I could ever give. I just \r\nwish I'd realized that before -- before I had to hurt you like this. And I am so \r\nsorry, because the last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.",
        "\r\nBryant: You think you're hurting me? No, you're not! You're killing me! You're \r\ndestroying me!",

        "\r\nJack: You sure don't pull any punches, do you? So you think I'm losing my touch \r\nwith reality?",
        "\r\nCarly: I don't think you're crazy, Jack. But I saw you the night of the wedding \r\n-- the night you say you saw James Steinbeck. And you were exhausted, Jack You \r\nhad just been to hell and back with Barbara and Julia. You'd quit your job. For \r\nheaven's sake, Jack, you had just killed a man. It's perfectly understandable \r\nthat you wouldn't be yourself.",
        "\r\nJack: So I had, what, hallucinations because of stress?",
        "\r\nCarly: I don't know. But this sense of danger that you're talking about, this \r\npremonition that something horrible is gonna happen to me, it's not like you, \r\nJack. And now, look at you. You're sneaking around Barbara's garden with a cigar \r\nbutt in a baggie, Jack. Doesn't that seem a little obsessive to you?",
        "\r\nJack: Okay, I know. I can hardly wrap my mind around it myself. But the fact is, \r\nCarly, somebody went to all the trouble of taking all these pictures of you and \r\nPaul and leaving them here. If not Steinbeck, who?",
        "\r\nCarly: I know that it's creepy, but how can you be so sure that it's Steinbeck?",
        "\r\nJack: I was working undercover for Steinbeck's operation for years. I know how \r\nthe man thinks, how he operates.",
        "\r\nCarly: But why now? Why me?",
        "\r\nJack: I told you my theories, Carly. Maybe he's trying to force a confrontation \r\nbetween you and Barbara. Maybe he's trying to expose the fact that you're \r\nfilling in for Barbara's shoes at B.R.O. Either way, if Steinbeck's involved, \r\nit's deadly.",

        "\r\nJack: Get out of this rat's nest ASAP.",
        "\r\nCarly: No, there is no rat's nest! Paul and I made a clear agreement -- well, as \r\nclear as it could be at the time. I intend to honor that, Jack.",

        "\r\nCarly: You don't know that! You don't even really know that James Steinbeck is \r\nback. But here's what I know. I know I have a job, Jack -- a real job and a real \r\npaycheck, and I know I need that.",
        "\r\nJack: Jobs come and go, Carly.",
        "\r\nCarly: Not like this one.",
        "\r\nJack: Tell Paul that you had second thoughts, and you quit.",
        "\r\nCarly: No. I'm not giving it up, Jack, period. I don't care how many phantoms \r\nyou see in flashes of lightning or how strong your gut feeling is. I won't do \r\nit. It isn't fair. And you know I love you. And what you think of me means the \r\nworld to me, but just because you have a claim on my heart doesn't mean you get \r\nto tell me how to live my life!",
