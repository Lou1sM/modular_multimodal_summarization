As Jack takes down the perpetrator, the perp's gun goes off. Lucy accidentally spills the beans to Rafi, Rafi furious when Dom tells him to chill out and let him take care of the business end of things. Rafi talks with Aaron and offers to train him so he'll have a decent fight, Aaron reluctantly agreeing. Dom threatens Dusty again, but instead of being angry with Lucy, Dusty kisses her and tells her that he wants her there, by his side. Jennifer tries to make up with Nikki, so that Mike will consider being the model for her new jeans line. When that falls flat, she still convinces Mike to become the face of Street Jeans.

        "Lucinda: Well, now that your contract with Worldwide is signed, sealed and delivered, you should think about where it is you want to start.",
        "Jordan: Well, there are several divisions that look pretty interesting, but I want a real challenge.",
        "Lucinda: And you shall have it. But I do suggest -- I suggest that you pick an area where you have some experience. Mr. Sinclair, an area of the business where you have some experience?",

        "Mike: You didn't have to go to this much trouble. If you want a favor, just ask.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's -- it's not exactly a favor. It's -- more of a business proposition. This brunch will be on my new company.",
        "Mike: There's a company?",
        "Jennifer: Paul loved the idea. So street jeans is a go. Of course, as soon as we can take apart the old company. But that's just paperwork. I am on the end of designing and marketing. And that's you.",
        "Mike: What's me?",
        "Jennifer: I need a real man for these ads, Mike. Not just some pretty boy model.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Margo: Did Jack remember Parker?",
        "Carly: Well, his name was stuck in his head. But, honestly, I don't think Jack would be able to pick him out of a lineup. We're strangers, as far as he's concerned.",

        "Jack: I don't want to show up empty-handed for my first visit.",
        "Carly: Well, when Parker did well at school, you would take him to Al's diner and get him a piece of chocolate cake. Just a guy thing, no moms allowed.",
        "Jack: Al's -- yeah, I remember seeing that last night on the way in. Okay, I'll stop by now, and I'll be over.",
        "Carly: Good. You have the address?",

        "Jordan: And would you tell me if you did?",
        "Mike: If you got questions, ask the right person.",

        "Rafi: Smart guy.",
        "Lucy: He is. No, I know the two of us, it's -- surprising. But it surprised us, too. He's really great. He makes me happy. Even when he's driving me crazy, there's no place I'd rather be.",

        "Rosanna: Well, I don't know. Where's her home? We stopped by that place in Missouri. She'd already moved.",
        "Carly: Great. So she's not just a waif, she's a homeless waif, hanging around Jack's neck.",
        "Rosanna: Come on, he's just being responsible. He's just being Jack. That's all it means.",
        "Carly: It felt different.",
        "Rosanna: How did he sound on the phone?",
        "Carly: Polite. That man who used to know my heart, know my body like it was his own. 'Cause it was. It is. He was talking to me like he was asking for directions on the street.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Carly --",
        "Carly: For him -- it's gone. For him -- it never was. He doesn't remember the big things -- our wedding. What I feel like. He came back to this town where we live, where our children live. And he went to sleep with that woman. He wrapped his arms around that woman, here --",
        "Rosanna: Carly, don't.",
        "Carly: Not two miles from our own bed. But I won't cry. I can't -- I can't let her have that. If I have to fight, I will fight. I will fight until Jack is back home with me and his babies, where he belongs.",

        "Nikki: You don't need to apologize, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Well, there is something else. I asked Mike to be our signature model for street jeans.",
        "Nikki: Why are you telling me this?",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's business, and I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.",
        "Nikki: Hey, if you two want to work together, I don't have a problem with that, okay? You do whatever you want.",

        "Lucinda: Yeah, I have some experience with Barbara, and at the moment, she's pretty wobbly.",
        "Jordan: Which is why Paul and Jennifer want to branch out. They have some very good commercial ideas.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, I got some experience with the kids, too. You would be the kids' boss.",
        "Jordan: And you would get to stick it to Barbara.",
        "Lucinda: Of course. And it wouldn't be personal. You say -- Mr. Sinclair, you say the fundamentals are good? 'Cause I wouldn't want Worldwide to buy any hidden liabilities, like asbestos.",

        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I'll go get Parker's cake.",
        "Jack: Alison, just a second. You know Carly, right?",
        "Alison: Of course. Yeah. Why?",
        "Jack: This may sound weird, but what were we like? As a couple.",
        "Alison: You and Carly? You guys are like a legend.",
        "Jack: A legend. In a good way?",
        "Alison: In a bawl-your-eyes-out-in-a-movie kind of way. You guys had, like, every bad thing in the world happen to you, and you never gave up. You guys -- these past few years, it's like you guys really made it. And you always looked so happy. And when I was out and I would see you guys, I always knew that that's it. That's what comes after, when \"they lived happily ever after.\" [Bell rings] I hear you. I gotta go get that food. But I'll be right back. Please don't leave, okay?",

        "Margo: Oh, no.",
        "Carly: She won't go quietly. She knows a good thing when she sees it. And she's got Jack so completely turned around. We're going to have to pull out all the stops.",
        "Tom: Okay, what do you mean?",
        "Carly: Well, when I asked you all to come over, I thought we'd treat it like a party. You know, Jack would come in. He would see you, and it would trigger some memories. But we're going to have to do more than that.",
        "Hal: Carly, what do want us to do?",
        "Carly: Talk to him. Tell him stories. Holden, talk to him about the farm. Tell him things that you did when you were teenagers.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Carly: And, Hal and Margo, talk to him about his job. Tell him how much he loves being a cop.",

        "Julia: Yeah, yeah. Except the thing is, um, she's more than just Jack's friend. She's -- she's his wife. And they have a little boy, and they have a beautiful little girl. The ones that we met at the Water Park. Do you remember?",
        "J.J.: No way! Jack married you! You're his wife, and I'm his son, Jack said. He's ours.",
