        "Katie: I can't keep this a secret any longer, Mike. It was me. ",
        "Mike: It was you, what? ",
        "Katie: The hit and run driver. I'm the one that ran you down. I \r\ndidn't realize it at first, Mike, and when I did realize it, I wanted to \r\ntell you, but I just couldn't, and -- I can't live like this anymore and \r\nyou deserve to know the truth, so -- ",
        "Mike: Get out. ",
        "Katie: What? ",
        "Mike: I know why you did it. You wanted me hurt because you thought \r\nthat I should have saved Simon\u2019s life. ",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no! Mike that is not it. I was on that medication \r\nand it made me all weird! ",
        "Mike: Oh, shut up. Shut -- shut up! I don't ever want to see your \r\nface again. Get out! ",
        "Mike: Katie? ",
        "Katie: Mike, shh. Just go back to sleep. I didn't mean to disturb \r\nyou. ",
        "Mike: Oh, it's okay. What are you doing here? ",
        "Katie: I was just gonna tell you something, but you know what? It's \r\nlate. You go back to sleep. We can talk about it later. ",
        "Mike: No, go ahead. What's on your mind? ",
        "",
        "Barbara: Will! Will, honey, wait! Wait. Will! Will -- ",
        "Will: No! ",
        "Barbara: Listen to me! Okay? You didn't say a word the whole way home \r\nin the car. I want to talk to you. I want to know that you're okay. ",
        "Will: I'm fine, Mom. You can go back to your place. ",
        "Barbara: I'm not doing that. Your dad's not home. Emily's not here. \r\nI'm not leaving you alone. ",
        "Will: But that's what I want. Why doesn't anybody do what I want! ",
        "Jennifer: Will? Woah, woah, woah -- what's happening? What's going \r\non? ",
        "Barbara: What are you doing here? ",
        "Jennifer: I came by to see dad and Will. Answer my question. What's \r\ngoing on? ",
        "Barbara: Will snuck out of my suite and went over to his brother's \r\nhouse and so I followed him to make sure -- ",
        "Jennifer: Will, are you all right? What happened? ",
        "Will: Mom was right all along. Rose is stealing Paul away from us, \r\nand there's nothing we can do to stop her. ",
        "",
        "Rose: All right, let's get a few things straight. Barbara comes in \r\nhere, busting my chops, and I get all defensive and it just -- slips \r\nout. About us leaving the country. I never meant to hurt Will. I swear. \r\nI am so sorry. ",
        "Paul: And that's it? That's your apology? ",
        "Rose: Yeah. ",
        "Paul: Well, it's not accepted. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I want to hear it from you. Where were you tonight when you \r\nshould have been with me at the homecoming dance? ",
        "Aaron: Did you win? ",
        "Lucy: We're not talking about that. ",
        "Aaron: I just want to know. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Aaron: Lucy, that's great. ",
        "Lucy: You got arrested for bookmaking. How did you get involved with \r\nillegal gambling? Is that where you've been getting the money for limos \r\nand hotel rooms? ",
        "Aaron: I wasn't gambling, Lucy. All I did was make a delivery. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Aaron, how stupid do you think I am? ",
        "Aaron: Please don't say that, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Why not? ",
        "Aaron: You're the most important thing in the world to me. ",
        "Lucy: Then why did you do it? Why did you ruin everything? ",
        "",
        "Lily: So what's it going to be, Dusty? You gonna take responsibility \r\nfor Aaron getting arrested tonight? Or you gonna hide behind him and, \r\nand let him suffer because of you? ",
        "Dusty: A decent guy would take the rap. Is that your point? ",
        "Lily: I'm done making points. So are you going to stand up, or aren't \r\nyou? ",
        "Dusty: Let me talk to Aaron. ",
        "Holden: Forget it. I meant what I said. I don't want you anywhere \r\nnear my son. ",
        "",
        "Will: You said it wouldn't happen, Jen, but you were wrong. Now Paul \r\nand Rose are going to Paris, and he doesn't care about any of us \r\nanymore. ",
        "Jennifer: Will, that's not true. ",
        "Barbara: Honey, your brother loves you, it's just that his judgment \r\nhas been affected by other people. ",
        "Will: You mean Rose? ",
        "Barbara: I know this is hard to understand, but sometimes there are \r\ncertain people that are just not good for each other. ",
        "Will: Paul isn't leaving Oakdale because of Rose. He's leaving \r\nbecause of you. ",
        "Barbara: Look, I know you heard a lot of very upsetting things \r\ntonight. You just have to understand that -- ",
        "Will: You made Rose hate you. And now she's taking Paul to Paris so \r\nshe never has to see you again. It's always the same thing, Mom. It's \r\nall messed up. And you tell me that it's okay. And you just expect me to \r\nbelieve you? Well, I don't, Mom. I don't believe you! ",
        "Barbara: Will! ",
        "Jennifer: Hey, you know, I think that you should leave. ",
        "Barbara: You know, will you get out of my way? I've done nothing \r\nwrong here. ",
        "[Jennifer scoffs] ",
        "Jennifer: It's always the same with you! You've played the victim for \r\nso long that you can't see it any other way. ",
        "Barbara: Are you telling me that you approve of these upcoming \r\nnuptials? ",
        "Jennifer: No, I don't! I agree with you that Paul is making a \r\nmistake. Marrying a woman that ran off with his best friend? It doesn't \r\nmake sense. I agree. But that's Paul\u2019s decision. And all that we can do \r\nis get out of the way. ",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe that's the difference between being a sister and \r\na mother. You can just stand by and watch this D\u2019Angelo woman destroy \r\nyour brother's life. You can watch while she destroys your little \r\nbrother's life. And you'll do nothing to lift a finger to help him. But \r\nI can't do that. I'm a mother. And as long as I have a breath in my \r\nbody, I will do whatever it takes to protect my children. And God help \r\nwhoever stands in my way.",
        "",
        "Paul: I know that I told you that I don't want to be a slave to my \r\nfamily, but I love Will and I love Jennifer, and just because you\u00a0 --- \r\nand just because you and I are moving to Paris doesn't mean I'm gonna \r\nturn my back on them. ",
        "Rose: I -- did I ever ask you to do that? ",
        "Paul: No. ",
        "Rose: Do you think I ever will? ",
        "Paul: I don't know! Look, it's pretty clear to me that you and Jen \r\nare never gonna be pals. ",
        "Rose: I got a sister myself. And I love Lily, don't get me wrong, but \r\nI do see her for who she really is. ",
        "Paul: Oh, and you don't think that I can do the same thing with \r\nJennifer? ",
        "Rose: No, I don't think you can. ",
        "Paul: You're wrong. I think I have a pretty realistic view of who she \r\nis. I think she's got terrible judgment. I think she has learned to be \r\nmanipulative from Barbara. And I think that she never does anything \r\nwithout thinking of herself first and everybody else later. ",
        "Rose: Hmm, there you go. Big brother's paying attention. ",
        "Paul: But, and this is a very -- well, this is important, she's my \r\nblood. And I understand her, and right or wrong, I'm always gonna be on \r\nher side. ",
        "Rose: All right, all right, I get it. ",
        "Paul: And that goes double for Will. Poor kid, Rose. Half the time he \r\ndoesn't know what's going on. ",
        "Rose: I know. He's been through hell and my big mouth -- made me say \r\nthat. But, Paul, I mean, eventually, he's gonna have to realize that \r\nwe're gonna be leaving. Accept it. ",
        "Paul: I know. I had really hoped that I could soften the blow for \r\nhim. You know, that I could tell him in my own way, in my own time. ",
        "Rose: Sorry. I said that I'm sorry and I mean it. Is there anything \r\nthat I can do to make it right? ",
        "Paul: Well, you know what? There might be. ",
        "Rose: Really? ",
        "Paul: Yeah. Maybe we can go over there together, we can explain to \r\nhim why we're going to Paris. I don't think I got through to him about \r\nall that stuff -- that he could come visit, and all. Maybe if we explain \r\neverything to him, he wouldn't feel like everybody was just kinda \r\ndumping on him. ",
        "Rose: Okay. Great. When? ",
        "Paul: Tonight. ",
        "Rose: Good. I can do that. Here I am now, thinking like a \r\n13-year-old, he's gonna think we're just trying to make nice. You know?\r\n",
        "Paul: Yeah. But I think I just thought of a way that we can get \r\nthrough to him. ",

        "Aaron: Lucy, you're making it sound like I got arrested on purpose. \r\nYou think I wanted this? ",
        "Lucy: You broke the law, Aaron. No one made you do it. ",
        "Aaron: I was just trying to make some extra cash, Luce. For you. When \r\nyou love someone, you want to give them things. I could never afford to \r\nget you anything really special. I finally had the chance to do that.\r\n",
        "Lucy: All I wanted from you was yourself. But tonight, when Mr. \r\nStauffer announced that I was the homecoming queen, the only thing I \r\nwanted to do was look in your eyes and share it with you, but you \r\nweren't there. ",
        "Aaron: Stop. Lucy, I'll make it up to you. I swear. I promise. \r\nSomehow, someday, I'll make it up to you. ",
        "Lucy: You can\u2019t. You're gonna have to live with this, Aaron. You're \r\ngonna have to do without me. ",

        "Dusty: You want to come after me? Go ahead. It's not gonna help your \r\nkid. ",
        "Jack: No one's coming after anybody. We're here to do what's best for \r\nAaron. Am I right? ",
        "Holden: Jack -- ",
        "Jack: And right now, I think that means letting Dusty talk to him. He \r\nwill just talk Aaron into taking the wrap for everything. ",
        "Craig: Well, I don't think that's going to happen, right, Dusty? Hmm?\r\n",
        "Dusty: Craig? ",
        "Craig: Huh? ",
        "Dusty: Shut up. ",
        "Lily: Dusty? ",
        "Holden: Lily, don't waste your breath. ",
        "Lily: Just give me a minute, okay? So, is Holden right? Aaron looks \r\nup to you. You wouldn't take advantage of that, now would you? ",
        "Dusty: I can see why your husband works with horses. His people \r\nskills aren't too good. ",
        "Lily: That's nice. Don't -- don't take it out on Holden because \r\nyou're angry. ",
        "Dusty: What would I know about it anyway? ",
        "Lily: What are you talking about? ",
        "Dusty: I got no wife -- no kids. What would I know about caring for \r\nsomeone as much as Holden cares about Aaron, for example? ",
        "Lily: What happened to you? Really, what happened to you? You used to \r\nbe such a sweet guy. ",
        "Dusty: What happened to me? Changes, Lil. Look at you. You used to \r\nthink that everybody, everybody had a good heart. And you didn't give up \r\non 'em so easily. ",

        "Bob: Mike, this is going to take hard work and it's gonna take \r\npatience. I know that Dr. Harris has recommended that you hire somebody \r\nfull-time when you leave this place. I second that. ",

        "Mike: I could keep score if I could get down there. ",
        "Bob: Well, Mike's recovery is on track. All he needs now is the \r\nsupport of his friends. ",
        "Katie: I should probably get going, too. Leave you guys to talk. ",
        "Ben: No, you don't have to leave Katie. ",
        "Katie: Actually, I do. I have a lot to get done at home. ",
        "Mike: You said you were going to tell me something. You never told me \r\nwhat it was. ",

        "Jennifer: That's okay. I can handle it. ",
        "Will: You know, why is it that nobody sticks around in this family? I \r\nmean, first, Mom ran off to marry Craig Montgomery, then you went to \r\nEurope and hardly ever called. Now Paul\u2019s leaving because he wants to be \r\nwith Rose. Why is it like that, Jen? I mean, isn't a family supposed to \r\nstick together? ",

        "Aaron: Look, I know I messed up, Lucy. But please -- we can make it \r\nthrough this. Because no matter what, I still love you. ",
        "Lucy: I love you, too. I never thought I'd say this to you, but love \r\nisn't enough. ",
        "Aaron: Yes, it is. Look at everything we've just been through. The \r\nfire, running away -- your accident, your dad trying to keep us apart -- \r\nthe only reason we made it through all that stuff is because we love \r\neach other so much. ",
        "Lucy: You lied to me. You broke the law. Love doesn't fix that. \r\nNothing can. ",
        "Aaron: Lucy, look, I was looking at it all wrong. Okay? But I made a \r\nmistake, and I see it now. And it won't happen again. ",

        "Holden: How am I supposed to fix that, Lily? ",
        "Lily: Maybe none of us can, but at least let Dusty talk to him. Do \r\nyou think that there is a way that you can get Aaron out of this? ",
        "Jack: No. Aaron's only shot out of this comes if he gives us \r\ninformation. ",
        "Lily: All right. ",
        "Holden: Exactly. Tell me why Dusty is gonna convince Aaron to talk to \r\nthe police, when it's Dusty\u2019s butt that winds up in a sling? ",
        "Lily: Because he knows that Aaron is a good kid and he has a good \r\nheart and his whole life ahead of him. Maybe somewhere deep in that \r\nheart of yours, Dusty remembers what that was like. And he knows what it \r\nwould mean for Aaron to get a second chance right now. ",

        "Ben: What'd she say? ",
        "Mike: She said she wished I was dead instead of Simon. ",

        "Mike: She backed off it afterwards. But I have a feeling she meant \r\nit. ",
        "Ben: No, no, no, man. She was talking out of her pain. She didn't \r\nmean it. ",
        "Mike: I told her I wouldn't bother her again. I think it's best if we \r\njust don't see each other at all. Then I get whacked by this hit and run \r\ndriver and she keeps showing up at the hospital. ",
        "Ben: Well, maybe you should reconsider? Maybe she really did regret \r\nwhat she said and is trying to make it up to you, man. ",
        "Mike: I don't want her to do it out of guilt. You know, so she feels \r\nbad about what she said. So what? That is not love and it never will be. \r\nAnd being around her, knowing that -- it just hurts too much, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Katie: How am I ever gonna tell him? How are you feeling? You want to \r\ntake another lap? ",

        "Katie: Oh, c'mon, all I did was give you a little encouragement. ",
        "Mike: You have been with me night and day. You know, when I fell \r\ndown, you picked me up. When I got discouraged, you lifted my spirits.\r\n",
        "Katie: And I'm not done. We're not done until you're 100%. ",
        "Mike: You are amazing. I do not have the words to describe how much \r\nyou have meant to me. So I guess I'll just say thank you -- ",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no. ",
        "Mike: From the bottom of my heart. ",
        "Katie: No, Mike. I should be the one thanking you. ",
        "Mike: Why is that? ",
        "Katie: Well, because when I finally told you the truth, that I was \r\nthe one driving the car that hit you. You were so incredibly \r\nunderstanding. ",
        "Mike: I know you, you know. I could tell right away how sorry you \r\nwere. All right? And hey, everything you've done since then has shown me \r\nexactly how much you care about me. So, let's start over, and just \r\nforget about all that. Give ourselves a chance to make the most of this.\r\n",
