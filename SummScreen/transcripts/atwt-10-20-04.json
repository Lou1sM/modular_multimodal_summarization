    "Transcript": [
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. Hi. Okay. The good news --",
        "Paul: Oh, sorry.",
        "Jennifer: The good news is that Mike Kasnoff agreed to be the face of street jeans.",
        "Paul: Oh, the \"face\" of street jeans. That's great. Assuming we can get out from underneath B.R.O.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I don't think we'll have any problem getting investors. Because you won't believe what Jordan Sinclair just told me.",
        "Paul: What? He's dating the brunette?",
        "Jennifer: No, that's Nikki.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Jennifer: Anyway, you know that Jordan's over at Worldwide.",
        "Paul: Yeah, what's he doing there? I mean, aside from putting up with Lucinda?",
        "Jennifer: Well, apparently, he's convinced her that Worldwide should buy B.R.O. Can you believe that?",
        "Paul: That's not such a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: So I don't know what offended Jennifer more, the fact that somebody might buy her company --",
        "Nikki: Or the fact that that person is you.",
        "Jordan: This is business, Nikki. Okay? She needs the help. That's why her mother hired me in the first place.",
        "Nikki: And your sudden interest doesn't have anything to do with Mike suddenly getting involved in Jennifer's new business venture?",
        "Jordan: Well, I mean, I'm not just gonna let her ride off into the sunset with some construction dude-slash-blue jeans model, am I? I mean, I have to --",
        "Nikki: You know what you need to do, Jordan? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Carly told you she was going to go look for Jack?",
        "Rosanna: No, not exactly. I just know that's what she did. She doesn't trust that woman, and frankly, I don't blame her.",
        "Hal: I don't know who this woman is, and I'm sure she's a terrific human being, and God bless her for taking care of Jack, but there's no way on earth this woman is going to take Jack away from Carly.",
        "Margo: But that is exactly what she did. I mean, how long has it been? It's been a couple months now, and most of that time he was in the hospital with this woman. And then he marries her, and he started a whole new life.",
        "Rosanna: That's because he didn't remember who he was. But now he has all the facts. And he's home, and he's gonna get treatment, and he'll remember us, and he'll embrace Carly and his family because that's -- that's just the way it has to be. When you love someone, and you get a second chance like that, you just -- I'm just saying, I don't think they'll squander it. I'm sure they'll get back together. I just know it.",
        "Tom: Look, I don't want to sound too cynical here, but it may not be that simple. If Jack has made any commitments, legal or otherwise, and if that woman presses her case, I mean, emotionally, financially --",
        "Rosanna: Then Carly will fight for her family.",
        "Margo: Well, she better choose her battles carefully, then. Because if she doesn't, she's gonna make things so much worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What have you done with my husband?",
        "Julia: What are you talking about? He left here an hour ago.",
        "Carly: If he'd left an hour ago, he'd be at my house by now. Where is he? Is he upstairs? You sedate him?",
        "Julia: What kind of person is it that you think I am, Carly?",
        "Carly: A nurse, with access to drugs. What's your room number?",
        "Julia: That's none of your business.",
        "Carly: My husband paid for that room with our credit card. Now, tell me the number, or I'm gonna call the cops. And in this town, that puts you at a distinct disadvantage.",
        "Julia: Fine. 507. But he's not there. You know, maybe he got lost.",
        "Carly: I gave him directions.",
        "Julia: Well, he doesn't remember this place.",
        "Carly: \"This place\" is his home. He fell in love here, married, started a family. His life is here.",
        "Julia: Are you sure he feels that way? Because I don't think Jack feels that way anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Put the gun down on the floor, nice and slow. That's it.",
        "[Gunshot and screams]",
        "Diner manager: Call the cops!",
        "Jack: It's okay.",
        "Jack: It's okay. Everything's okay. It's over. Get up. Get up!",
        "Alison: Who got shot?",
        "Jack: Our friend here. But it's just a flesh wound. Nothing serious. Why don't you call 911, report a 719, suspect in custody. Request immediate back-up, and maybe an ambulance?",
        "Diner manager: I'll get that.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Thanks. All right. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Tell everybody to relax. The cops will be here any minute.",
        "Alison: You are the cops. Look what you just did. Thank you so much, detective.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Hey, buddy.",
        "Parker: Where's Jack?",
        "Hal: He'll be here pretty soon.",
        "Parker: Is he with Mommy?",
        "Rosanna: Mommy had to run an errand, okay? She'll be back soon.",
        "Hal: Poor kid. He knows something's wrong.",
        "Holden: What happens when Jack gets here, and Parker comes running down those steps, and Jack doesn't know him?",
        "Hal: I wouldn't assume that he won't know him.",
        "Margo: What? He didn't know Carly.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Hal: Munson. What? You're sure? Well, take his report, and meet me at the scene.",
        "Margo: What was that?",
        "Hal: That was Officer Rodriguez, at the scene of an attempted robbery, where Detective Jack Snyder apparently interrupted in progress. Our boy is back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #1: Welcome back.",
        "Jack: Yeah, in all the confusion, I seem to have lost my pieces of cake. May I get some more, please?",
        "Diner manager: Right away.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Alison: So you still don't remember anything?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Alison: Well then, how did you do that? How did you grab that guy?",
        "Jack: I don't know. Something just kicked in. I just knew what to do.",
        "Alison: Well, you must be healing, if you're remembering things.",
        "Jack: I'm not remembering things. It -- not in the sense that I have memory, I just am reacting in a certain way. Look, an hour ago I could have told you that I worked as a cop, because I've got a badge and an I.D. That says I do. Now, I am a cop. I feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's no wonder Jack doesn't remember us. You've made him feel so guilty.",
        "Julia: I don't make him feel anything.",
        "Carly: Look, I'm willing to believe that when this whole thing started, you were just doing the right thing. You were being kind to someone who needed help. But Jack is a married man -- a father. The fact that he doesn't remember us yet isn't the point. Obviously, he needs the support and love of his family and friends, and probably some serious medical help. And if he were just an average person, you would see that. But because he's so loving and so handsome, you got a little carried away, didn't you?",
        "Julia: No. You know what, Carly, things happen. People's lives change. I see it all the time. People get sick, they get hurt. Their priorities change. They realize that life is very short, and you need to grab on to what you want. Jack grabbed onto me, and to J.J. and that's real. He loves us.",
        "Carly: You've only known the man for a couple of months.",
        "Julia: That doesn't change how we feel.",
        "Carly: You don't have a right to feel anything! Look, you know what? It doesn't even matter. Because when Jack recovers, and he will recover, now that he's home. When he recovers, it's gonna be very difficult for you. Because this couple of months that you've had with him, it's a detour. It doesn't count.",
        "Julia: Right. Yeah.",
        "Carly: Jack and I go back so far, we've been through so much, that nothing can shake us. Not you, and not your son. There's not a chance in hell you'll wind up with anything but heartache. So why don't you do yourself a favor and start over. Somewhere, anywhere, just not here!",
        "Julia: I know that'd be easier for you, Carly. It'd probably be easier for me, and for J.J., but you know what? Jack loves us. And as long as he wants us --",
        "Carly: He doesn't know what he wants!",
        "J.J.: Stop yelling at my mom!",
        "Carly: J.J. Hi. I didn't know you were here.",
        "J.J.: Liar!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I am not creating a new line so that somebody else can take it over.",
        "Paul: By somebody, you mean Jordan.",
        "Jennifer: And Lucinda. Is that what you want? We get out from under Mom, just to become indentured servants to Lucinda Walsh? One diva per lifetime, please.",
        "Paul: I can handle Lucinda. The question is, can you handle Jordan?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I don't want to see Jordan, let alone take orders from him. And why you would want anything to do with him after the way he treated you and Rosanna -- what are you not telling me?",
        "Paul: I've been thinking about things.",
        "Jennifer: Things? What things? Jordan slept with Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Yeah. But I understand why.",
        "Jennifer: Because they're selfish? Greedy? Irresponsible? Cruel? Hey, stop me before I depress myself.",
        "Paul: You know, I felt the same thing for weeks. I hated them both. Well, that's not entirely accurate. I mean, I hated him. I was angry at her. But mostly, I just felt bad for letting her down.",
        "Jennifer: Letting her down? Paul, you saved her life.",
        "Paul: She lost her child. And once I began to allow myself to understand what that might mean, I could see what kind of agony she was in. And, well, that she would turn to Jordan, that kind of makes sense. I mean, she had to turn to somebody, and I wasn't there. And Jordan's a decent guy. She trusted him. He was Cabot's father.",
        "Jennifer: So you've forgiven them both?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Jen, I'm not suggesting that what you're feeling is in any way inappropriate.",
        "Jennifer: You know what, Paul? He could have just held her, he could have rocked her to sleep, talked to her till his voice ran out. He didn't have to make love to her.",
        "Paul: It was sex. It was one night, and it's over. Anyway, getting back to this company that you want to create, Worldwide, or somebody else, we might need help.",
        "Jennifer: I thought your lawyers were going to declare Mom non compos mentis?",
        "Paul: The problem is, the courts have already intervened and committed her to observation. And until the hospital weighs in, and the courts decide her culpability, we're stuck. But, the good news is, if she's not crazy, she goes on trial for murdering Cabot.",
        "Jennifer: This is not cheering me up.",
        "Paul: Either way, there's a locked room in her future.",
        "Jennifer: How long is all of this going to take?",
        "Paul: I have no idea. There's no way to tell. So, maybe, a knight in shining armor --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, please. Jordan is no savior.",
        "Paul: You never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nikki: You need to congratulate her on her new business, and tell her you love the choice she has for the spokes-model.",
        "Jordan: And that's supposed to bring her around?",
        "Nikki: Jen still loves you. She's just hurt. All right? Just exercise a little patience, and she'll come fighting for you.",
        "Jordan: Hmm. Patience, huh? What about my interest in Worldwide acquiring B.R.O.? Am I supposed to be patient about that, too?",
        "Nikki: Well, she needs a backer. Jen wants this new line so badly she can taste it. You've planted the seed. Now just sit back. Relax. She'll come to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, what happened?",
        "Hal: Well, Jack was at the diner. A guy tried to knock over the register. Jack jumped in, just like old times, took him to the ground, disarmed him and told an onlooker to call in a 719.",
        "Margo: He remembered the code!",
        "Hal: And when the boys showed up, they said he didn't miss a step.",
        "Holden: Sounds like his instincts kicked in.",
        "Hal: I told you. You know, you bring him home, and things like this will happen time after time, and he'll remember even more.",
        "Rosanna: I'm gonna call Carly. I'm going to let her know.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Hal: That must be him. Rodriguez said he left the scene ten minutes ago. Hey, there he is! The man of the hour!",
        "Margo: Jack, it is so good to see you! This is a miracle!",
        "Holden: Man, have I missed you. Mama's away. She couldn't be here. But when she gets back, she's just dying to give you a big hug.",
        "Hal: Back in town less than an hour, and the crime rate's already dropped.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I don't -- I'm sure I do know you. Obviously, you all know me. I just -- I don't remember any of you. Where's Carly?",
        "Rosanna: She -- she'll be right back. I was just about to call her. I'm Rosanna, I'm Carly's sister. It's so nice to have you back. We were just heartbroken when we thought you were lost. And this is truly a wonderful and happy day for all of us.",
        "Margo: Jack, I'm Margo. We're cops together. We have been for years. And this -- this is my husband, Tom. You work with him as well. He's not a cop, he's the D.A.",
        "Tom: Hey, you were sorely missed.",
        "Margo: And this --",
        "Hal: Hal Munson, Jack. You were my best friend for more years than I care to remember. And you're a pretty good cop, too. I always said, I wish I had 100 detectives just like Jack Snyder in my squad room. But right now, Jack, you've got a bigger job -- that of a father and a husband.",
        "Holden: That's true.",
        "Jack: Who are you?",
        "Holden: I'm your cousin, Holden. I'd love to wrestle Hal for the role of your best friend, because that's practically what we were growing up as kids.",
        "Jack: We grew up together?",
        "Holden: Well, you grew up in Chicago, but you spent a lot of time on my mother's farm. We got into a lot of trouble together as kids. I've got a couple of pictures I could show you. There was this one camping trip that we went on --",
        "Jack: Maybe a little later. Sure. It's pretty lousy standing here, disappointing all of you. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay.",
        "Margo: No, we understand.",
        "Hal: You know, we heard about what happened at Al's, and we just thought --",
        "Jack: Oh, you thought that I remembered.",
        "Hal: Yeah. But you will. Just give it time.",
        "Margo: Yeah, Jack, you know, you will. Why don't you, you know, come over, and we'll talk and we'll look at pictures.",
        "Jack: Yeah, sometime.",
        "Margo: Stop by the station.",
        "Jack: Sure. Okay.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: I should call Carly, let her know you're here.",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Jack: Is that Sage?",
        "Holden: Yes. That's your daughter.",
        "Jack: Hey. Oh. My daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: J.J., you don't talk to grownups like that.",
        "J.J.: I know why you're here! You're trying to take Jack away!",
        "Carly: J.J., I am very sorry.",
        "J.J.: Why don't you just go? Leave us alone! We were so happy before you got here!",
        "Julia: J.J., that's enough.",
        "Carly: You see what you've done? [Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Rosanna: Honey, he's home.",
        "Carly: Jack's home?",
        "Rosanna: He just got here. Apparently, the delay was because of some incident at Al's. He had to arrest somebody, but he's fine. And he's home. And I think we're all kind of freaking him out.",
        "Carly: I'll be right there.",
        "Julia: Stay here. I'll be right back. Excuse me, Carly. Did you say that Jack was at your place?",
        "Carly: He's home, yes. And while, apparently, it is not your fault that he's late, quite frankly, I don't feel like apologizing to you after what you've done to my family. And if I were you, I would take a nice hard look at what you're doing to your son. Because he is gonna lose Jack. You might as well start preparing him now. For Pete's sake, Lisa, would you watch where you're going!",
        "Lisa: You ran into me, honey. Which is just as well, because I've been wanting to speak to you.",
        "Carly: I don't have time for this right now. Okay? I'll talk to you later.",
        "Lisa: You know that green satin coat? Drama queen. Oh.",
        "Julia: I think this is yours?",
        "Lisa: Thank you. That woman is impossible sometimes.",
        "Julia: Is she really? I don't know her very well, we only just met. And we're kind of in an awkward situation. But I was under the impression that everybody around here thought that she was pretty great.",
        "Lisa: Well, I don't know who you've been talking to, but you can trust me, not everybody loves Carly Snyder. Thank you, darling. You have a nice day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're a beautiful little girl, Sage.",
        "Holden: I brought a bunch of pictures of you and Sage, if you want to take a look at them.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: I reached Carly. She's coming right over.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Parker: Jack! You're finally here!",
        "Jack: Parker. Oh!",
        "Parker: You remember me?",
        "Jack: How could I not? Oh, you're my main man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Something's happening here. You haven't been this optimistic in ages.",
        "Paul: I am optimistic.",
        "Jennifer: Well, is it -- is it Rosanna? I mean, are the two of you --",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Jennifer: But you're hopeful.",
        "Paul: I'll let you know more when I know more. Just think about what I said.",
        "Jennifer: She forgave you, you forgive her, I should forgive Jordan.",
        "Paul: No, you should just focus on launching street jeans, and you should let me do whatever I can do to make all of your dreams come true.",
        "Jennifer: This is supposed to be fun.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe it will be fun, if you give it a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Your mom thought you might like this.",
        "Parker: Chocolate cake from Al's diner! You remember.",
        "Jack: Well, I asked your mom if there was something I could pick up.",
        "Parker: But you remember the first time we had it, right?",
        "Jack: No, buddy, not really.",
        "Parker: But you remember me.",
        "Jack: I know you, but I don't remember you. And I know that doesn't make much sense. But as soon as I saw you, I knew you, and it wasn't because anybody showed me a picture, or that you were the only boy in the room. I would have known you anywhere. I just don't remember why, or any of the things we've done. Somehow, I just know you.",
        "Parker: That was like that with me, too.",
        "Rosanna: If I could have a word with all of you?",
        "Parker: It's okay if you don't remember everything. I'm just glad you're home.",
        "Rosanna: I think we should give them a little time alone. I mean, Parker seems to be the only one that he recognizes, and with all this hovering around, I feel like we're making him a little tense.",
        "Holden: You're right. We should all go.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I'm gonna stay just for a little while, though, until Carly goes back, and then I'll leave, too, okay?",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Parker: You sure you don't want a bite?",
        "Jack: No. No, thanks. You have a go at it. Listen, what you were saying about knowing how I felt, and that it was like that for you, too -- what did you mean by that?",
        "Parker: When you fell off the bridge, and everybody thought you were dead --",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Parker: I knew that you were still alive. I knew it, and that you were trying to get back to us.",
        "Jack: But how could you have known that, when I didn't even know it myself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: I promise I'll be careful! I'll go straight to the room, and I won't talk to any strangers!",
        "Julia: Okay, I want 20 pages from one of the books your teacher said you should read before you start the new school, okay? What floor do you press on the elevator?",
        "J.J.: Five?",
        "Julia: Ah. Hey, excuse me.",
        "Lisa: What can I do for you, honey?",
        "Julia: We were chatting earlier when you dropped your stuff. Do you remember?",
        "Lisa: Oh! You mean, when Carly Snyder practically ran me down.",
        "Julia: Yes.",
        "Lisa: Lisa Grimaldi.",
        "Julia: Julia. Nice to meet you. So actually, what I wanted to talk to you about was before, when you said that not everybody loved Carly, I was wondering what you meant by that.",
        "Lisa: Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I'm just like the cat that's got its fur rubbed the wrong way. Carly is a wonderful -- designer.",
        "Julia: Well, I was really more interested in what kind of person she is.",
        "Lisa: Why is that?",
        "Julia: The truth is that we are in sort of an insane situation. I'm a nurse, and I used to work in this hospital in Missouri a couple months ago. This man was brought in with multiple injuries, and a severe case of amnesia. That man was -- actually, he is Carly's husband.",
        "Lisa: Jack?",
        "Julia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lisa: Jack Snyder?",
        "Julia: Yes.",
        "Lisa: You're telling me -- are you telling me he's alive?",

        "Lisa: Oh, darling, you have just made my day. This town has been hanging its head since that man disappeared. He is the sweetest, handsomest, funniest man I know, and I just adore him.",
        "Julia: Well, that makes two of us. I was Jack's nurse. So the two of us got pretty close.",
        "Lisa: No wonder Carly was in such a good mood.",
        "Julia: I don't blame her. He doesn't remember her at all. And that's kind of strange under the circumstances, because the way she tells it, they had this mythic love.",
        "Lisa: It was mythic, all right.",
        "Julia: I understand they were married twice, and they were raising her son from a previous marriage, and they have a little girl together?",
        "Lisa: Jack got lucky.",
        "Julia: How do you mean?",
        "Lisa: Well, until they had the paternity test, everybody thought Mike Kasnoff was the daddy.",

        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah. But he's -- he's fragile, okay? It's -- it's fragile.",

        "Jack: Hey, Parker, this was -- this was good, you know, hanging out with you, talking about old times. Thanks for never giving up on me. It's because of you I'm here. Come here. We'll keep at it, okay?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry that I wasn't here when you got here. How did it go?",
        "Jack: It didn't go. It -- it was tough. All those people standing there with their hopes up, and then --",
        "Carly: So you didn't remember anyone? It must have been hard.",
        "Jack: I -- I had this thing at the diner. I responded to a situation like a cop, almost automatically.",
        "Carly: That's terrific.",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's not that I remembered being a cop. I guess I just -- I just am one.",
        "Carly: You're a lot of wonderful things. I -- I know how hard this must be for you. I know how much you must wish it would just snap back to normal.",
        "Jack: I don't even know what that is anymore.",
        "Carly: You recognized Parker.",
        "Jack: No, I knew him. Like I said, I don't have any actual memories of our time together. And I can see that hurt him.",
        "Carly: Honey, we're all just so grateful you're alive. Whatever it takes to help you heal, that's what we'll do.",

        "Jack: No, it's fine. 'Cause luckily, Julia just happened by. She recognized me from the hospital, let me crash on her couch. Why, I still don't know. She gave me food, clothes, even helped me get a job. I started over. I didn't have a choice.",
        "Carly: Go on.",
        "Jack: So I started over. And it's okay. I mean -- you know what, it's better than okay. Because you know, Julia, she's a wonderful woman, and J.J., he's an awesome kid. It's not like anybody else can tell me anything about my past. So I let go, move on. I get married. And then Julia starts finding out more and more about you, and everything goes topsy-turvy. I'm married to you, only I don't remember you. And I know that's not what you want to hear, but it's the truth.",
        "Carly: I'm not trying to take anything away from you.",

        "Jack: No, I knew him.",
        "Carly: Well, that's good. Because he loves you so much, Jack. From the moment you went over that bridge, he's had one goal -- to save you, to bring you home, because you mean so much to him. I know this is scary, to try to jump back into a whole other life when you've worked so hard to build this new one, but you can trust it. We love you so much. And you love us. And someday, you will remember that.",
        "Jack: There are no guarantees.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. You'll remember me, 'cause you love me. And not just for a couple of weeks or because you need me. Our love is tested. We've let each other down, we've worked our way back. We've survived all kinds of bad luck, and we have still stayed strong. Because we belong together. We're more than lovers, Jack. We're family. And now that I have found you, I am going to help you remember, because you deserve that life that we built together. And because you are my husband. And I made an oath to stick by you no matter what, 'cause I love you. You need to stay here, honey, with me and with Sage and with Parker. You need to be safe and let your mind and your body heal, and you will remember us, Jack. Please, please say you'll stay here with us. Please.",

        "Lisa: Mike Kasnoff. Her sister's old flame, and it wasn't the first time. She and Mike just can't seem to keep their hands off each other. Although, Jack was always a favorite. I must admit, there was something special between those two. But when you want it all -- a marriage, career, children -- something's gotta give, and in Carly's case, it was always the people around her. But why she's taking her temper out on you, when you nursed her husband back to health --",
