        "\r\nChris: There are no rules. ",
        "\r\nAlison: Of course there are. So just tell me what I should and shouldn't do, and \r\neverything will be cool again. ",
        "\r\nChris: You know, you couldn't follow the rules if you tried. It's not your M.O.\r\n",
        "\r\nAlison: Well, I can be good. I can be really, really good. Remember? So tell me \r\nwhat to do. ",
        "\r\nChris: Stop. Everything. ",
        "\r\nAlison: Stop avoiding you? Stop ignoring your calls? Sorry, Doctor, it's not as \r\neasy as you thought it was going to be, and if I'm supposed to make it easier on \r\nyou -- ",
        "\r\nChris: We have to stop doing this, Alison. ",
        "\r\nAlison: Stop doing what? I'm -- I'm not doing anything. ",
        "\r\nChris: You know, we need to talk -- about everything. ",
        "\r\nAlison: See me tonight? ",
        "\r\nChris: No, we shouldn\u2019t. ",
        "\r\nAlison: But you want to. And so do I. So I'll see you tonight. It's a date! ",

        "\r\nMolly: Wow. Bad news travels fast. ",

        "\r\nPaul: I always liked you, Molly. Always figured you for one of the smart ones, \r\nbut-- not when it comes to Dusty. He's a thug. And I don't know why you don't do \r\nwhat Rose did and just dump the guy and cut your losses and don't ever look \r\nback. ",

        "\r\nRose: Hey. Hey, remember what you just said to her? \"Change is good.\" ",
        "\r\nMitzi: Yeah. You just got to make sure you know what you're giving up. 'Cause \r\nsometimes, you don't get a second chance. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Ready to have that chat we talked about? ",

        "\r\nMargo: Look, I know that you've -- you've had to go over this about 100 times, \r\nbut I've got to ask you once again. Is there anything more about the accident \r\nthat you recall, huh? ",
        "\r\nMike: I told you everything I remember. I stopped to help this lady -- she ran \r\nout of gas, car broke down. I ran across the street to help her out. ",
        "\r\nMargo: Well, what about -- how much more of the car did you see that hit you?\r\n",
        "\r\nMike: Nothing but headlights. ",
        "\r\nMargo: Anything that you recall? The -- the driver, the face, the hair? Was it a \r\nman, a woman -- ? ",

        "\r\nHenry: Katie, until they figure out that his memory is gone, and then they'll \r\njust leave him alone. All right? ",
        "\r\nKatie: Well, you know what they say -- after a trauma, people think that they \r\ndon't remember anything at first, and then days go by, or weeks, and then all of \r\na sudden they start piecing things together. What if Mike does that, and he \r\nrealizes that I'm the one who hit him? ",
        "\r\nHenry: He won't! He won't, okay? And even if, by some miracle, he gets some kind \r\nof total recall, he will lie through his teeth to keep you from doing time. ",
        "\r\nKatie: I don't care what happens to me! ",
        "\r\nHenry: Katie -- ",
        "\r\nKatie: I just want Mike to get better. And if Margo\u2019s gonna find out that I'm \r\nthe one who was driving that car that hit him, her car -- I want her to find out \r\nfrom me. ",

        "\r\nMargo: He's fine. He still doesn't recall anything about the accident. ",
        "\r\nHenry: Doggone it. That's got to be tough. ",
        "\r\nMargo: We've got other evidence. In fact, Jack is meeting me here. Their \r\nforensics report just came in. ",
        "\r\nKatie: What -- what kind of evidence? ",
        "\r\nMargo: I don't know yet. I'll let you know later. Keep your fingers crossed. ",

        "\r\nHenry: No, listen -- hey, don't -- don't worry about it. ",
        "\r\nKatie: This is just what I was afraid of. Margo's going to find out the truth. \r\nShe's going to hate me forever. And Mike is never going to forgive me! ",
        "\r\nHenry: Just calm down, okay? We're going to come up with a plan. ",
        "\r\nKatie: I already did. You're going to follow Margo and find out what she knows.\r\n",
        "\r\nKatie: I can't do this. I can't do this anymore. I can't lie like this! ",
        "\r\nHenry: There is nothing for you to do. ",
        "\r\nKatie: I have to tell Margo. What if somebody gets blamed, Henry? I already \r\ntalked to Dr. Bob. He says that I'm not qualified enough to help Mike, so there \r\ngoes that plan. ",
        "\r\nHenry: Oh, please. Dr. Bob, come on, he's just a doctor. He doesn't know \r\nanything. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Oh, fine. I'll plead insanity. At least, that way, I can be in a \r\nhospital, because I won't last one night in prison. ",
        "\r\nHenry: All right. All right, all right, all right, okay. I'll find out what they \r\nknow. Man -- you -- you have got to promise me that you'll get your cute little \r\nbuns into Mike's room and convince him that he needs you for a full physical and \r\nspiritual recovery. ",
        "\r\nKatie: I will try. ",
        "\r\nHenry: All right now. Good. Now do something with your lips. Put a little \r\nmascara on, all right? And you need a little bit more blush. And, uh, do that \r\nthing with your hair. You know, make him want it. ",

        "\r\nMargo: Great. Anything that's going to help us I.D. the car? ",
        "\r\nJack: Nah, it doesn't look good. The tires were practically new, and they're the \r\nmost popular size and tread available. ",
        "\r\nMargo: Oh, great. Needle in a haystack. ",
        "\r\nJack: Yeah. One thing we know for sure is that the woman that Mike was trying to \r\nhelp that night said the car that hit him was navy blue. So we're looking for a \r\nnavy blue car with new treads. ",
        "\r\nMargo: How new? ",
        "\r\nJack: The report says less than 500 miles. ",
        "\r\nMargo: Okay. How long does it take to put 500 miles on new tires? ",
        "\r\nJack: Depends on the driver. Some -- takes a month, others can do it in a day.\r\n",
        "\r\nMargo: Great. So we're looking at a month's worth of new tire receipts? ",

        "\r\nMike: I thought we'd been through this. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Don't worry. I got overruled. So I'm not going to be able to get you back \r\non your feet therapeutically or medically speaking, but -- I can do the fun \r\nstuff. I know how much you like my cooking, so I'll cook for you. I can run \r\nerrands. I will rent movies, tell jokes, whatever you want. ",

        "\r\nMike: Now, what do I have to do to get a nurse? ",
        "\r\nBen: Ah, well, funny you should ask. I have found the best orthopedic nurse in \r\nOakdale. She cross-trained as both a nurse and a physical therapist. Glenda, \r\nthis is the patient. ",

        "\r\nGlenda: Oh, and he follows orders, too. I think we'll get along just fine. ",

        "\r\nRose: All right. I was mad. I was mad at myself for allowing that creep to get \r\nto me. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: I saw you, Rose. He broke your heart. Don't you think that Paul \r\ndeserves to be a little bit more than a rebound guy? ",

        "\r\nJennifer: Well, may I remind you that you then dumped Paul for his best friend? \r\nHe was so devastated, Rose, that he had to leave town. You drove him away from \r\nhis home, from his family -- and now you're doing it again. You're taking him to \r\nParis, away from all of us. ",
        "\r\nRose: Hold on a second. He left town the first time because of your mother, not \r\nme. And he went looking for an apartment in Paris because of your mother, not \r\nme. We want to have a life together without her hovering around, trying to ruin \r\nit for us. It was Paul\u2019s idea to go to Paris. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Paul's idea? ",
        "\r\nRose: Yeah. And I'm thinking maybe that wasn't far enough -- Paris. I love him. \r\nI'm engaged to him. He's the most incredible man in the world. The best gift I \r\ncan give him is getting him away from that psycho father, the crazy mother and \r\nthis witchy little sister of his. ",
        "\r\nJennifer: Okay, Rose. Then what about Will? Hmm? His little brother, Will, who \r\nadores him? Who can't do anything without him? Who's never hurt anyone in his \r\nentire life? Don't you see how much he needs Paul? Or don't you care that you \r\nmight be hurting an innocent kid? ",

        "\r\nPaul: No. I'm not afraid of Dusty Donovan. ",
