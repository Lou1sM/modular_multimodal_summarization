        "[Sorry, the names of who said what were not recorded on this transcript.] I got him. All right. Come on. You should have stayed at the hospital.",
        "Jennifer: For like the kadrillionth time, I'm fine. Then why do you keep holding your stomach and making that face? You could have internal injury.",
        "Jennifer: They would have found it at the hospital. But you didn't even stay for your MRI.",
        "Jennifer: I'm fine. Really. I took a header off a bunch of steps. I wasn't sore, I would be spider man. How long? An hour. Let's go. I don't want to be late. That's it. I'm taking you back to the hospital.",
        "Jennifer: No! I'm not missing the custody hearing. The judge isn't going to hand over custody to somebody who's about to pass out.",
        "Jennifer: So I won't pass out until after I get custody of my baby. Let Cass handle it. He's your lawyer. That's why you're paying him. And now that Carly's been arrested for drugging you -- No judge in his right mind would let the baby stay with Carly. Just like no judge in his right mind would hand a baby over to a kidnapper, even if it was my own kid that I took.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You took the baby because you were afraid Carly would hurt him. You thought you were saving his life.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but I should have listened when you said it would come back to bite me. I have to make the judge understand why I took off.",
        "Will: Oh, you'll win, all right. And you'll have your mama to thank for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Had he. Hey.",
        "Jack: You look like the perfect mom to me.",
        "Carly: Even if I did spend the night in jail? How are the kids?",
        "Jack: Excited that you'll be home tonight.",
        "Carly: Thanks for bailing me out, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey, I do that for all my wives.",
        "Carly: And thanks for bringing me these clothes.",
        "Jack: I just followed instructions. That's one of the first things they teach us in detective school.",
        "Carly: Are you still going to get to be detective when all of this is over?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack, you can be honest with me. How much trouble are you in because of what I did?",
        "Jack: Let's not worry about that yet.",
        "Carly: Good idea. Because we have other things to worry about. The judge knows about me being arrested?",
        "Jack: Correction. The new judge knows that you were arrested.",
        "Carly: There's a different judge on this case?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Cass Winthrop has obviously been busy.",
        "Carly: How can he do that?",
        "Jessica: I just wish we weren't starting from square one. But the crime you and Jack committed.",
        "Carly: No, wait a minute. Jack was just trying to protect me.",
        "Jessica: By suppressing evidence to protect you, he committed a crime. If he hadn't done that, I could have pitched Jack as primary guardian. But now --",
        "Carly: What are our chances, Jess?",
        "Jessica: Honestly, not very good.",
        "Carly: Oh, wait. But Gwen kidnapped Rory! That's even worse than what I did! The judge can't take him away from me and give him to her.",
        "Jessica: He could do precisely that. Or worse.",
        "Carly: What do you mean worse?",
        "Jessica: It's possible that neither you nor Gwen would end up with the child.",
        "Carly: What? Then who would get him?",

        "Paul: Dusty can't just walk into the hospital and demand that a baby that belongs to someone else --",
        "Jennifer: It's my baby, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah well, Gwen Norbeck gave birth to the baby. And he's living with Carly. I'm betting a court would put you in last place in terms of rights.",
        "Jennifer: Do you want to help me with this or not?",
        "Paul: I'm trying to help, Jen. But if you're going to get proof that this is your kid, I don't want you to miss your shot because Dusty botched it.",
        "Jennifer: He won't.",
        "Paul: It's not like he's been real successful so far.",
        "Jennifer: That's completely unfair. Dusty's done more to help me than anybody, including my family.",
        "Paul: Okay. You will need access to that kid all right? But Carly's not going to be inclined to let you anywhere near him. So how is he planning to get by her?",
        "Jennifer: I'm not sure.",
        "Paul: Jen, if you're not willing to tell me everything --",
        "Jennifer: We haven't worked that part out, yet. Dusty was more concerned about finding somebody we could trust to help us get the tests done.",
        "Paul: Who's going to do that? Bob? Susan?",
        "Jennifer: Meg. I hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Problem? No. Meg and I were just having a little talk. I wasn't talking to you. Is there a problem? Of course not! Meg? I'm okay. Thanks. I told you. See? No problem. Let's talk over there. What was that about? Nothing to worry about. When did you get back in town? Last night. Oh. Sorry. I've been out of touch. I just checked my messages. What did you need to talk to me about? Sounds important. Yeah. It is.",

        "What took you so long? It just seems long. I want to go in there. No, no. It's better if we're not looking over Susan's shoulder. The test. Did you hear how many tests she ordered? Yeah. That's because they don't know what is wrong with Luke. Exactly what happened with Rose. They didn't know what was wrong with her. By the time they figured it out, she was dead. This is not Rose. Luke will be okay. Oh, how is he? He's running a high fever. We're giving him fluids, keeping him comfortable. Can I see him now? In a little bit. Right now, we're taking him down for more tests. More tests? What are we dealing with here? I'm not sure yet. Tell us what you know. Anything. Any details. Well, so far, we know that he's terribly anemic and has an infection. Which I gather from you two, he developed in Mexico. An infection. Well, it could be E. Coli. That's really serious. I'm not sure if he has that yet. You said it's just an infection? What is dangerous about this infection is it's spreading faster than Luke's body can fight it. His condition is serious. But he'll be all right? We'll know more after these tests. Oh. He wanted to hang out with his friends. He had been couped up in the house for days. But he was pale. But after Mexico, I thought it would be good for him to go out and have some fun.",

        "Dusty: Okay.",
        "Emily: How is Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: What's with you, Emily? We're talking here.",
        "Emily: Paul is very worried about his sister, Dusty, and so am I. After I saw the two of you in the airport together, how was your trip, by the way?",
        "Dusty: What are you really after?",
        "Emily: I just told you. Paul and I are concerned. Can't you just tell me if Jennifer's okay?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's fine and Paul knows that. She's with him right now.",
        "Emily: So you just saw her? When did you two get back?",
        "Dusty: Last night -- If you're so worried why don't you call Paul and ask how she's doing?",
        "Emily: That's a great idea. That's a great idea. Do you want to talk to her?",
        "Dusty: Emily, go away. Would you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "I'm sorry about before. But at least I told you the truth. The truth? What was that about? Oh -- just that she can't stand me and I can't stand her. You still haven't forgiven her for sleeping with your ex-husband? Oh, I forgave her for that a long time ago. It's the backstabbing thing that I just can't get to deal with. So, why did you need to talk to me? Forget it. After the drama? I don't think so. I was just - some stuff came up. I needed a pal. So I called. Several times. Sorry. I know how you hate that. I'm here for you. You know that, right? Really? Yeah. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you called. So how was your trip with Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Not great. In Florida, trying to get proof that Gwen's baby and Jennifer's baby got switched while they were in the Neonatal unit. Any luck?",
        "Dusty: Not yet. But I think I'm about to change that. And that's why you're really here. Aren't you? To get me to help you help Jennifer. Again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How is Meg going to help you?",
        "Jennifer: She and Dusty are close.",
        "Paul: So he's going to capitalize on manipulating her?",
        "Jennifer: It's not like that. She's helped us before.",
        "Paul: It's probably against the law.",
        "Jennifer: It's the only way I can prove the baby is really mine.",
        "Paul: So the hell with Meg and her nursing career? If she gets thrown in prison, so what? And Dusty's supposed to care about her? I hope he cares a helluva lot more about you.",
        "Jennifer: If you don't like the plan, you don't have to be part of it. But if you try to stop me, Paul",
        "Paul: Yeah? Hello?",
        "Emily: Dusty is here sweet-talking Meg. I think she's going to tell him the truth about the baby, Paul. I tried to stop it, but I don't' think it worked.",
        "Paul: Hang tight. I'm on my way.",
        "Jennifer: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: To see Meg.",
        "Jennifer: But you promised!",
        "Paul: I said I would help you find out the truth about your baby, and I will. I won't mess things up for you, Jen, but I want to make sure Donovan doesn't either.",
        "Jennifer: I'll go with you.",

        "Barbara: I've been looking all over for you two. You have to help me with Will!",
        "Paul: Tell Jen all about it. I've got to go.",
        "Barbara: Paul! Wait!",
        "Paul: I think the less you know about this part, the better. Don't you think?",
        "Jennifer: I'm coming with you.",
        "Barbara: What is he talking about?",
        "Jennifer: What happened with Will?",
        "Barbara: He got hauled in by the police.",
        "Jennifer: He was arrested?",
        "Barbara: Detained. But he still could be in serious trouble if we don't keep him away from that awful Gwen Norbeck.",
        "Jennifer: Gwen? What has she got to do with this?",
        "Barbara: She pulled this stunt with her baby. And Will was involved.",
        "Jennifer: Is the baby all right?",
        "Barbara: If you had bothered to return my calls, you would know all this.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, just tell me! What happened to the baby?",
        "Barbara: Gwen kidnapped him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "You two would be in such big trouble if I hadn't saved your butts. Will, honey, could you get me one of these? Will's not your servant. If you want something, get it yourself. This will do me. What are you doing here, mom? Calm you down, honey. She's fried, isn't she? But I have a good feeling about this. You will get your little boy back. I feel that in my heart.",
        "Gwen: What heart? Very funny! She always gets sarcastic when she's nervous. She gets that from me. You don't have to thank me for taking care of you. That's just what a mother does.",
        "Gwen: Thank you? I never want to see you again. What are you talking about after all I've done for you these past few days? If it wasn't for me.",
        "Gwen: If it wasn't for you, we never would have been caught in New York. Oh, yeah, right. Two kids running with a baby? What were you thinking? Me getting Carly arrested, and getting a new judge to reopen the custody case -- that's what counts. I spent all last night with Cass.",
        "Gwen: But why did you do it? I did it for you, Gwennie, and for my grandbaby. Why else? For the money? For the baby's trust fund? What a mouth you've got, talking to an adult like that. He's right. I have been looking out for you!",
        "Gwen: You lied to me my whole life. About who my father was. Who my sister is. You know what? You were better off not knowing those people. Carly's been on my case for months! Didn't you think it might have helped if I knew she was my sister? Your father was a terrible, horrible man. And Carly grew up to be just like him, just like I always knew she would. And you're so much better? I have to go to the custody case. Let's go. He has to go to the custody case. He will take one look at him and think both of you should be in reform corner. The judge is going to take one look at him and see you both as a couple of kids who should be in reform school. But if I'm in your corner -- I'm a responsible adult.",
        "Gwen: Responsible? You don't have a clue what that is. Let's go. But I need to be there to support you! I'm trying to do right by you. For once in my life. Please, let me.",
        "Gwen: We can talk later. Don't come to the hearing. I don't want you there. I've got to do what's best for you, honey. And while I'm at it, what's best for me. The judge could decide what is best for the baby to be some kind of foster care.",
        "Carly: No! We love him, he can't be Carly, how much you love this child is no longer relevant. You drugged Gwen so that she'd appear to be an unfit mother.",
        "Carly: I was desperate. I did that on my own. The point is that the judge will see you both as bad risks when it comes to raising this child. Excuse me. Jessica Griffin.",
        "Carly: This is my fault. My sister trusted me to take care of her son and I blew it. I lost him. If we lose, we'll appeal. Or we'll arrange for some kind of joint custody thing with Gwen. I can't do that. I won't do that. Carly, be reasonable. If Gwen gets custody, she'll disappear. Only this time, we may never find her. This is wrong. Iris and Gwen should be facing charges, not me! Don't go there.",
        "Carly: It's true! Every stupid move I've made with this baby I've made because of the lies Iris told me. Making me think I had killed my baby brother when I never had a baby brother! Instead, I've got a half-sister who is scheming little demon just like her mother. And you think it's a good idea to hand Rory over to those people? That's it. What? We have to turn this around. Turn around. Literally. You can't do that. It could work, Jack! Or it could backfire.",
        "Carly: And if I don't try, I'll lose Rory for sure. This is the only way.",
        "Jack: No, Carly. There is another way.",

        "Lily: Thanks for coming.",
        "Keith: Is he okay?",
        "Lily: I want to apologize for not listening when you were trying to tell us.",
        "Keith: I just want to be okay. Is he?",
        "Lily: We don't know yet. I want to apologize for accusing you of using Luke to get to me. Sorry.",
        "Keith: That's okay, Lilly. I know with where you're coming from. I should have never taken your mother to Mexico.",
        "Lily: Mother! My mother! If she finds out about this, she is going to be--",
        "Keith: Is your mother here?",
        "Lily: Yes, treated in the oncology unit. We'll make sure no one says anything.",
        "Keith: Is she okay?",
        "Lily: If she had gotten proper care, she would of been fine. I think maybe you should leave now.",
        "Keith: Lily, do you want me to go? Lily Holden, I have news. Come with me. How is Luke? We're moving him back up here to prep him. For operation? No, transport. He needs to be moved to the cling. Why not be treated here? They have better resources and he needs the very, very best. What are you saying if he doesn't get to this other hospital that he'll die? Yes, that's what I'm saying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I want you to listen carefully, because this idea's kind of out there.",
        "Carly: I'll try anything.",
        "Jack: Why don't you talk to Gwen before the hearing starts?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: If you two could compromise.",
        "Carly: There's no compromising with her!",
        "Jack: You two have just discovered you're sisters. The judge has to see how huge that is for the both of you. So if you make a plea together, promising to work with each other to put Rory's interests first, the judge might --",
        "Carly: I can't share custody with Gwen.",
        "Jack: She is his mother!",
        "Carly: She gave birth to him.",
        "Jack: Why can't you just try to talk to her?",
        "Carly: She won't believe what I have to say. She'll think I'm trying to trick her.",
        "Jack: I don't know where she came up with that idea. We've all made mistakes in this. But face it. If it comes down to making a deal with Gwen or having the baby go into foster care --",
        "Carly: I can make this work, Jack. I can win this. I can't trust her. I know what I have to do.",
        "Jack: What do you have to do, Carly? What are you planning?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oh, no! Hi, Gwennie. I know you're upset, but please keep your voice down.",
        "Gwen: Why is she here? Because I asked her to be. If the judge sees that you have extended family that can help with the raising of your son, it can do a world of good for your case. Believe me, we need the help.",
        "Gwen: But -- Do you want the kid or not?",
        "Gwen: I want him. Then relax and be glad that your mother is here. All rise. I've reviewed the briefs and the Police reports in connection with this case and I am ready to make my ruling regarding the custody of the minor child. Therefore, it is my order that the child -",
        "Carly: Your honor! What are you doing? Your honor, we apologize.",
        "Carly: There's something I have to say. You're out of order, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Carly: I know I am. And I don't want to be. I do respect you and the court. But what I have to say could change things. Your honor, my client is distraught. Mrs. Snyder, you are in contempt.",
        "Carly: I'm fighting for my son, my baby here. Please, just give me a minute. One minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "You're telling me that Gwen ran away to New York -- With your brother. And she was planning to disappear with the baby forever? Apparently Paul. And your brother could be charged with aiding and abetting. Where's the baby now? Back at Carly's I suppose. Jennifer, we have to do something about Will. I have tried to talk sense into him, tried to convince him to keep his distance from Gwen - but he won't listen. And I'm scared what is going to happen next. Me, too -- that poor baby. I'm talking about your brother. We need to go down to that hearing. We need to sit him down and listen because he will listen to you. I can't. I've got to go. What about your brother? What if they charge him with kidnapping? Then you'll fight for him, the way you always fight for your kids. I never understood that before. Go to the hearing, okay? I promise I'll talk to Will later. But right now, I have an emergency that can't wait! What could be more important than Will? We're talking about family! So am I.",

        "Meg: Oh, is that what's important?",
        "Dusty: You don't like the idea, huh?",
        "Meg: What's not to like? You bring a baby in here probably without the guardian's per in addition and take a little blood. And I draw Jennifer's blood. And while I'm at it, I could get myself fired, since I'd totally be breaking the rules. And I can get myself arrested, because I'm breaking the law.",

        "Meg: And you've been asking a lot. Where do you get off, Dusty? We're not even dating anymore. We're just friends. And you know what? And you have other friends at this hospital. Why don't you ask your friend, Ben Harris, you know, maybe he could take some time off from neurosurgery to do you a favor? Another favor?",
        "Dusty: I'm not asking someone else, I'm asking you.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because I'm counting on you to be who you are. You always go with your heart. Will you break some rules? Yeah. But if this really is Jennifer's baby, it's all justified. You can make things right.",

        "Meg: Why should I do this? What's in it for me? What? You don't have a comeback for this one?",

        "Meg: Why? Why does it mean so much to you?",
        "Dusty: Because. I don't want to see that baby dead. That's why I delivered him, remember? I don't want Jennifer killing herself over something stupid like grief. Do it for me. Meg, Dusty. Why are you and your girlfriend interrupting my conversation? Private? I have serious concerns. Do you know someone named Dusty Donovan? That's Meg. She calls for me. I can take it. Finding out what happened to Jen's baby, that's for me, too. I don't need your help. Look. We don't have a lot of time. It's a fake call? Emily. We need to get things sorted out before Dusty gets back. You don't want me to do the test. Yeah, I already got that message from your girlfriend. And I'll tell you just what I told her -- Do the blood test, Meg. Do it today. I have come to my decision. We have a deal? You know, the next time you two think you have me all figured out, think again.",

The closest is the doctor at the clinic. When do we leave? Immediately. As soon as possible. You know, I could have him there in two hours. I'll fly. You almost got my son killed next. Do you think I'll give you another shot to finish the job? You stay away from Luke! You understand? You stay away from Luke and you stay away from us!",

        "Jennifer didn't call! Thanks. Hi. Thank you. No problem. I had Emily make the call. I needed to speak to Meg without you interfering. What did he say to you? I had to make sure that if we go ahead with this plan, there is no mistakes. There is no room for error. Now you're suddenly ready to believe the baby is alive? I want what's best for Jennifer. And if this test is the only way for her to get closure, I'm all for it. I don't believe you. But something's happened. We need to get this done right away! Why? What's happened? The people who are supposed to be taking care of my baby have made a huge mess of everything. They've put him in danger and I've got to stop them before it's too late!",
        "Carly: I have made terrible mistakes your honor. If I could take them back. I would. But there was so much I didn't know. So many lies that I was told. Lies that woman planted in my mind years ago. She made me think I had hurt a child, a baby. But it wasn't true. I never hurt anybody. I just discovered that my sister is alive and she's seated at that table. I don't see how this matters to this case.",
        "Carly: Please don't take my baby away, your honor. I would never have been so frantic to hold on to that if I had not known the truth about my past. I've heard enough. Please sit down. Your declarations are of no consequence, Mrs. Snyder. I don't believe in excusing adult behavior on the basis of issues deep in childhood.",
        "Carly: I was only trying to say -- You were making excuses. And there is no excuse for what you did. You put the child you claim to love in danger by drugging his mother.",
        "Carly: I certainly did not set out-- Quite! Quiet! This is not a criminal court so it is not for me to determine what punishment will result from your misdeeds. But your actions have repercussions here. I'm ordering the child be removed from the care of Carly Snyder today.",

        "I thought I was going to pass out. What's wrong? I thought I was going to cry. I don't want Luke to see tears in my eyes, not today. He wouldn't hold it against you. You've had to be strong for so long. I'm not strong. If I was strong, I wouldn't be thinking things that I'm thinking. What are you thinking? Why did I make her say it? Because you want the truth. I thought that's what I wanted. But then she said our son might die. It's not going to happen. Because we're not going to let it happen. We're going to get him to the clinic and get him all of the help he needs. I was about to call you. It's about Luke. How did you know? I'm not sure. I was out doing some errands and suddenly, it was as if the truck had a mind of its own. Finally, I suddenly found myself in the parking lot. What is going on? Luke is being transferred to another hospital. That doesn't sound good. He's not, his kidneys are shutting down. He needs a specialist. He's a very sick boy. It's too much. First your mom, now Luke. God never gives you tich. I hope God will forgive me sometimes that sounds like so much. I don't know. I just don't know how I would cope with all you're dealing with right now. What can I do? You can pick up Faith. Of course. What about Natalie? She's home with a sitter. I will be by to pick her up, too. Nothing more than I love than spending the night with my little girls. So how is Luke? He's not too frightened? He's sleeping. Sleeping a lot. Actually, a good thing. He has no idea how serious this is. Can I see him? No. They're preparing him to be air-lifted. Air-lifted? They'll tag him to the airport by helicopter. Oh, my word! I'm -- I'm sorry. It just sounds so-- We haven't even decided which one of us is going to go with him. You both should go. I mean, don't worry about the kids. I'll keep them for as long as you need. Okay? Thank you. It's just a terrible time. To leave the kids right now, Natalie is so young and Faith is worried about her brother. Don't worry. Just go. Just go. He needs both of you, both of you right now, okay? All right. Thank you. How can I make this up to you? You can just, you can just bring him home to me. Just bring him back home, well. We will, mom, I promise. Okay.",

        "There is still the matter of what would now be in the best interest of this child. I have read the Police reports concerning the kidnapping. Ms. Norbeck, what you did speaks of your immaturity. You took your child out of the state against this court's order, without adequate means of caring for him. This was irresponsible and criminal. Moreover, I am aware of the juvenile record of your friend, Mr. Munson. Young man, given your past, how could you so cavalierly put your future at risk? And this infant's future?",
        "Gwen: It wasn't his fault, your honor. Again, I am not interested in excuses. What I do need to know, Ms. Norbeck is that you and your friend understand the enormity of your acts. Tell him.",
        "Gwen: Yes, your honor. I do. From the minute I took my baby, I was so scared. Was he sleeping enough? Getting enough to eat? Was he warm enough? Was he breathing? And when they found us, and he slipped away -- I will never do anything like that again, your honor. I'm glad to hear that. It is not up to me to decide if criminal charges should be filed in this case. However, I will write the D.A. a letter and suggest that no further action be taken. While kidnapping is never a preferable course of action, it is still understandable why Norbeck felt compelled to take possession of her child. She had been viciously framed by Mrs. Snyder and she was operating on a sincere belief, however mistaken, that Mrs. Snyder had killed another child. Ms. Norbeck's actions can be understandable, although not excusable. Keeping that in mind, I have come to my decision. So this girl is totally irresponsible! And Carly's completely out of control. Jennifer! The judge won't let the baby stay in an unsafe environment. But don't you understand? If the judge decides he's not safe with Carly or Gwen, my baby could end up with total strangers! We have to get him back now! Meg, you have to help me. Please! Jenny, we're working on that. But you need to give Meg a minute.",
        "Jennifer: There's no time! You have to calm down or she'll say no, all right? Trust me, all right? Okay. Do we have a deal? Next time you two think you have me all figured out? Think again. You don't tell me what to do. Ever. Just look at my sister. Will you look at her? Look how vulnerable Jennifer is right now. You won't be helping her by seeing that she gets her baby back. You'll be setting her up for years of torment from Craig Montgomery. And you'll lose Dusty in the process. You need to think about this. Stop it! I know what I have to do! My new grandson should always feel safe in my hands, You have to get better. Okay? I'm right here. I can't lose you. Lucinda's plane is ready to go. Good. The med evac helicopter is standing by to take us to the airport. Let's move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Your honor, on behalf of Ms. Norbeck, I'd like to petition the court for a formal ruling for the baby to be assigned to her custody.",
        "Gwen: Your honor, I'm sorry for interrupting. But I just have to say thanks. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity. And I although prove -- You're out of order, Ms. Norbeck and under a misapprehension. But, I thought from the way you said earlier, that I am getting full custody of my son, right? Actually, no, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "What's going on? What did you do to her? Paul seems to think he can read my mind. You're supposed to be helping. It's okay, Jennifer. I know what I'm doing. Which is what? I need to help Jennifer find the truth. I'll do it. I'll perform the test. Thank you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next week on \"As the World Turns.\" The results of the lab? Why don't we go someplace where we can talk. Decorations right this time? Oh, my God! You're Byron Glass!",
        "Gwen: I'm taking you to court, Carly. When they march you off to jail, I'll be the girl with the smile on her face!"
