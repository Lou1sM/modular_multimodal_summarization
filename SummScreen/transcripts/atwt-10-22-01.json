        "\r\nBarbara: Rose D'Angelo has been dancing in nightclubs most of her life and God \r\nknows where else. She's got to have something that she doesn't want revealed. \r\nGet me the information, James. It doesn't matter what I'm going to do with it. \r\nDon't you dare refer to Paul as \"our son.\" He is mine! You said you were going \r\nto help me. I'm really giving you the opportunity to prove that you can.",
        "\r\n[Door opens] ",
        "\r\nBarbara: Yes! I'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
        "\r\nPaul: Who was that?",
        "\r\nBarbara: Kim. Why?",
        "\r\nPaul: Just curious.",
        "\r\nBarbara: What did you find outside?",
        "\r\nPaul: Jack Snyder. I thought I saw someone out there, and sure enough, there he \r\nwas.",
        "\r\nBarbara: That poor man, still trying to protect me, trying to make up for what \r\nhappened at the boathouse.",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, well, he told me something that I don't want to believe, 'cause if \r\nit's true, God help us.",
        "\r\nBarbara: What's that?",
        "\r\nPaul: He seems to think we had an unwanted visitor here tonight.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Who, Craig? Do I need to get a restraining order now?",
        "\r\nPaul: No. According to Jack, James Steinbeck is back around.",
        "",
        "\r\nBilly: So that's the locket Bryant gave you?",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah. You know, there was a moment there, right before Bryant gave \r\nthis to me, I was so set to tell him everything and -- but he was so sweet, I \r\njust couldn't do it.",
        "\r\nBilly: Hey, you know, I was gonna tell him, too. You know, about 100 times a \r\nday, but I figured that was the best thing. You know, I was thinking, \"why look \r\nbackwards?\" You know?",
        "\r\nJennifer: I don't think it's a good idea for him to be alone tonight. I think we \r\nshould send someone over to the cottage.",
        "\r\nBilly: No, I don't think he's at the cottage.",
        "\r\nJennifer: You think he went somewhere?",
        "\r\nBilly: No. When Bryant gets upset, he gets in the car and drives. You know, he's \r\nprobably already on the road.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Where do you think he'll go?",
        "\r\nBilly: Family and friends, you know, somewhere he can get it out and hopefully \r\nfeel better.",

        "\r\nBryant: What, you knew that Billy and Jennifer were hooking up?!",
        "\r\nAdam: Keep it down, all right? There's people sleeping upstairs.",
        "\r\nBryant: Give me an answer.",
        "\r\nAdam: Yeah, I knew.",
        "\r\nBryant: How?",
        "\r\nAdam: I overheard Jen talking to Abigail, and then I asked Jen about it, and she \r\ncame clean.",
        "\r\nBryant: Abigail was in on this, too?",
        "\r\nAdam: No, no! It's not like there was anything to be in on, Bry. We just --",
        "\r\nBryant: What?! Did you feel sorry for me?",
        "\r\nAdam: We didn't want to see you get hurt, okay?",
        "\r\nBryant: No, it's not okay! I don't want sympathy, and I don't want to be the \r\ntopic of conversation.",
        "\r\nAdam: It's not like we were getting off on this. Nobody thought this was cool, \r\nBry.",
        "\r\nBryant: Does anybody else know about this?",

        "\r\nAdam: No, what --",
        "\r\nBryant: Tell me right now! Does my father know about this?",
        "\r\nAdam: No! Will you cut this out?! All right, no! We didn't tell them, and you \r\nknow we wouldn't.",
        "\r\nBryant: Yeah, and our cousin and my girlfriend wouldn't sleep together, right? \r\nNo, I don't know anything! The world stopped making sense to me tonight.",

        "\r\nCraig: Carly, why did you do that?",
        "\r\nCarly: Don't you even try to play innocent with me. I'm not buying it.",
        "\r\nCraig: Am I bleeding?",
        "\r\nCarly: No, but you will be if you don't leave right this minute.",
        "\r\nCraig: Hey, if you want a fight, I'll call a promoter. We could make some money \r\nout of it. In the meantime, you could tell me what's got you so riled up.",
        "\r\nCarly: These, Craig! These pictures. You had somebody take these so Barbara \r\nwould come after me, didn't you?",
        "\r\nCraig: Pictures of you and Paul talking? Now, why would Barbara be concerned \r\nwith these? Of course, they might signal a little business deal Paul's made with \r\nyou? Say, for example, just off the top of my head, you might be designing for \r\nB.R.O.?",
        "\r\nCarly: Those photos don't prove anything.",
        "\r\nCraig: I hope you had somebody look at your contract.",
        "\r\nCarly: I'm not admitting anything to you.",
        "\r\nCraig: Okay, fine, don't. Labor on in obscurity if that's what turns you on.",
        "\r\nCarly: If you want to go fishing, Craig? There's a great, big lake less than 100 \r\nmiles from here.",
        "\r\nCraig: I had nothing to do with those photos.",
        "\r\nCarly: Why should I believe you?",
        "\r\nCraig: Because if I'd had, I'd probably take them to Barbara first.",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh no, you wouldn't. You would use them to torture me first.",
        "\r\nCraig: Well, torture isn't really what I had in mind for us, but --",
        "\r\nCarly: I do not want to play these games anymore.",
        "\r\nCraig: Neither do I, Carly. So let's have a whole new game, and the winner is \r\nyou.",
        "\r\nCarly: Every time I chase one of your golden carrots, I end up crashing into a \r\nwall. I'm not doing it anymore, so whatever you're offering, take it someplace \r\nelse.",
        "\r\nCraig: Geez. Leave me some space here. All of this concern is causing my back to \r\nspasm.",
        "\r\nCarly: Good.",
        "\r\nCraig: I suppose another massage is out of the question, huh?",
        "\r\nCarly: I could do some acupressure. Why don't you lay down and relax? I'll get \r\nmy hammer.",
        "\r\nCraig: Did anyone ever tell you that when you get mad, your eyes darken? It's \r\nreally, like, startling.",
        "\r\nCarly: Will you cut it out? That is not gonna work. Now, get out of here before \r\nI start swinging again.",
        "\r\nCraig: Well now, do you think that I would stoop to this kind of cheesy \r\nsubterfuge?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yes.",
        "\r\nCraig: And there is no one who comes to mind? Nobody else could have taken these \r\nphotos? No other suspect?",
        "\r\nCarly: No, no one.",
        "\r\nCraig: All right. Well then, how about this? Every time you've nailed me in the \r\npast, haven't I come clean? True?",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, you know, I can't really remember. It's happened so many times, \r\nI've lost track.",
        "\r\nCraig: Well, it is true. So what would be different this time?",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, maybe you've become a better liar than you were before. All right. \r\nMaybe, maybe there is the slightest chance that it could be possible that you \r\ndidn't do it.",
        "\r\nCraig: Thank you. So now, in return, how about a little truth for truth?",
        "\r\nCarly: Meaning what?",
        "\r\nCraig: Meaning I've asked you several times if you're designing for B.R.O., and \r\nyou continued to deny it.",
        "\r\nCarly: Why are you so sure I am?",
        "\r\nCraig: Well, because Barbara's dysfunctional, so Paul needs a designer. You need \r\na job, but you're buying expensive wine, toys for Parker.",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh, all right already. So what? So yes, I'm designing for B.R.O. and if \r\nyou mess it up for me, I will rip up your heart and shove it down your throat!",
        "\r\nCraig: You're doing the spring line?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yes.",
        "\r\nCraig: But you're not gonna get any credit, are you? All that glory goes to \r\nBarbara. That must hurt.",
        "\r\nCarly: It does.",
        "\r\nCraig: Well, that's why I'm here, Carly -- to make all that hurt go away. And it \r\nstarts the minute you resign from B.R.O.",

        "\r\nBarbara: James Steinbeck is a wanted man. He would never risk a return to this \r\nstate, let alone this house.",
        "\r\nPaul: Well, according to Jack, he's cut a deal with the authorities.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Even so, he would never risk coming here, and I will not resurrect his \r\nmemory even though Jack Snyder needs someone to chase.",
        "\r\nPaul: Mom, this is just hypothetical here. Let's say you did see dad. What would \r\nyou do?",
        "\r\nBarbara: Run, call the police. I can't believe you're asking me that question.",

        "\r\nBarbara: Maybe it was your choice of dinner companions.",
        "\r\nPaul: It wasn't. You know, mom, I have a problem. Maybe you can help me out with \r\nthis one.",
        "\r\nBarbara: If I can.",
        "\r\nPaul: You know, I begged you to go to that stockholder's meeting tonight, and \r\nyou shut me down flat. But yet, as much as you dislike Rose, she was somehow \r\nable to convince you to go.",
        "\r\nBarbara: I can't believe that you're still hammering away at this. I did not go \r\nto that meeting because of Rose D'Angelo! I went because it was the right thing \r\nto do!",
        "\r\nPaul: Mom, you knew that before I left. She must have done something to change \r\nyour mind. What was it? It's a simple question.",

        "\r\nJennifer: I felt alone for so long. With my family, my friends, even with \r\nBryant, something just was missing. Then I met you, and like night and day, \r\neverything changed. Hey. I finally feel connected to someone, but not by blood \r\nor by having a good time together, just deep inside in my heart and soul. I \r\nnever knew what these words meant before; Billy, but I love you, too.",

But \r\nhe's become one of my best friends, and I know how much he wanted it to work out \r\nwith Jennifer. Don't you wish people could be like videotape?
