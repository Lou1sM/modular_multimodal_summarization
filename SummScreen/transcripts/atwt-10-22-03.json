        "Henry: Hey. Hey. You wanna get rid of the \r\nnurse? That lithesome creature with legs that go all the way up? ",
        "Katie: Just think of something, Henry. Be \r\ncreative, be charming. ",
        "Henry: Oh, sure, okay. Oh, my heart. My \r\nheart, my heart. I'm just abuzz with ideas of how I could distract the lovely \r\nMiss Glenda. ",
        "Katie: Just make sure she stays one sponge \r\nbath short of coming anywhere near Mike. ",
        "Henry: Oh, see, darling, that's what I love \r\nabout you. You never underestimate my ability to get a job done. ",
        "Katie: So we have a plan? ",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah. Don't you worry your pretty \r\nlittle head about it. The angel of mercy is about to meet the master of \r\ndeception. ",
        "Glenda: Well, I've got some errands to run. \r\nI'll meet you at your place later? ",
        "Mike: Yeah. You have the directions? \r\n",
        "Glenda: I take route 23; get off at the Old \r\nPost Road -- ",
        "Mike: And come up on the east side of the \r\nlake. ",
        "Glenda: I have your number if I get lost.\r\n",
        "Mike: All right. See you later. ",
        "Henry: Lucky fool. Why does he get a \r\nplaymate of the month to be his nursemaid? Hmm? ",
        "Katie: Hurry it up over there. The playmate \r\nis leaving. ",
        "Henry: All right. All right, all right, all \r\nright. I got it under control. Don't worry about it. Miss Glenda? It's Glenda, \r\nright? ",
        "Glenda: Yeah. ",
        "Henry: It's a beautiful name for a beautiful \r\nwoman. You know, you might not believe this, but this could be the luckiest day \r\nof your life. ",
        "",
        "Rose: Well, that works for me. You'll get \r\nback to me when we get what we need? ",
        "Supplier: Okay. ",
        "Rose: I'll be in touch. Ciao. Whoa.\r\n",
        "Mitzi: That a buyer? ",
        "Rose: A supplier. ",
        "Mitzi: 'Cause anyone in their right mind \r\nwould snatch this place right up. ",
        "Rose: Mitzi -- ",
        "Mitzi: Rose, you know I have a head for \r\nbusiness. Okay? I saved us a bundle on inventory. A girl's gotta think about her \r\nfuture. ",
        "Rose: Yeah. Tell me about it. ",
        "Mitzi: And the clients like me. I got my own \r\nbook. Who else can do Mrs. Pinter's pin curls? ",
        "Rose: All right, we've been over this 1,000 \r\ntimes. There is no way I can sell you the ` 9oller palace. It's not an option. ",
        "Mitzi: I can get the money, all right? My \r\nUncle Pete\u2019s always lookin' for a hot investment. ",
        "Rose: Uncle Pete? I can't wait for Uncle \r\nPete to cash in his communion money. ",
        "Mitzi: What, you gotta sell in five minutes?\r\n",
        "Rose: Sooner. ",
        "Mitzi: So let me get this straight. I haul \r\nmy Jersey-self all the way out to Oakdale,\r\nIllinois, to help my best bud build her \r\ndream shop. And now she's blowing me off for a better deal? ",
        "Rose: I'm getting married. ",
        "Mitzi: You know what? Get married. Just \r\ndon't ditch your best friend. ",
        "Rose: You should be happy for me. Mitzi, \r\nyou've always been my number one cheerleader. ",
        "Mitzi: Maybe I want to cheer for myself for \r\na change. Maybe I'm tired of sittin' around just bein' happy for you all the \r\ntime. ",
        "Rose: All right, all right, okay. I \r\nunderstand. But putting a couple 1,000 miles between Paul and his wacky family \r\nis priority number one. If you don't get that, then maybe I need a new best \r\nfriend. ",
        "",
        "Rosanna: Hi. ",
        "Paul: Hi. What, you found a new tenant \r\nalready? ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, no. This one has his own \r\nplace. Cabot Montgomery, I would very much like you to meet the young Paul Ryan.\r\n",
        "Paul: Well, come on in. Cabot, huh? Is he -- \r\nhe, right? ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yeah, it's my son. Yes. \r\n",
        "Paul: Well, he's beautiful. ",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. ",
        "Paul: I'm glad to see that -- that Craig \r\nchanged his mind. ",
        "Rosanna: Yes, well, he was the one that made \r\nit all happen. He's been terrific with the baby. ",
        "Paul: Very happy for you. ",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm sorry about how abrupt this \r\nhas all been. You know, with me breaking the lease, it's -- Rose and I are \r\ngetting married. ",
        "Rosanna: Wow. Congratulations. ",
        "Paul: Yeah. And we're moving to Paris. I \r\nmean, as soon as she can get rid of her shop and we can kinda pull everything \r\ntogether. ",
        "Rosanna: Wow. Are you -- are you gonna get \r\nmarried here, then -- in Oakdale? ",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. ",
        "Rosanna: Uh-huh. Have you set a date? \r\n",
        "Paul: No. Not -- not yet. But, you know, \r\nwe've talked about things being, you know, small and informal. So, I'm sure \r\nthere won't be a lot of planning. ",
        "Rosanna: Uh-huh. Interesting. When are you \r\ngoing to Paris? ",
        "Paul: Not soon enough. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, how about that? How 'bout \r\nthat? You know, Paul, I don't mean to be nosey, but for a man who's about to \r\nturn his whole world upside down, there's an awful lot of things you're not sure \r\nabout. ",
        "",
        "Dusty: So you want to operate as a team, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Jennifer: We have a common goal -- to break \r\nPaul and Rose apart. ",
        "Dusty: The last time I recall, you were \r\ncalling me a pig. ",
        "Jennifer: My opinion hasn't changed. It is \r\nexactly your lack of moral fiber that's convinced me you're the man for the job.\r\n",
        "Dusty: I thought hurting Paul wasn't an \r\noption for you. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, things have changed. \r\n",
        "Dusty: What things? ",
        "Jennifer: I can't believe I'm about to say \r\nthis, but my -- my mother was right. Rose is a scheming, heartless witch. And \r\nthe sooner I get Paul away from her, the better -- for all of us. ",

        "Marshall: This place looks great. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Well, Sarah was the genius behind \r\nall the decorations. ",
        "Sarah: Well, yeah, Bonnie helped. \r\n",
        "Troy: And all the kids got into the spirit.\r\n",
        "Sarah: I love Halloween. ",
        "Marshall: She gets it from her old man.\r\n",
        "Troy: We appreciate you providing everything \r\nfor the party, Mr. Travers. ",
        "Marshall: Marshall, \r\nplease. ",
        "Troy: Well, we don't have a lot of room in \r\nthe budget for celebrations. It means a lot to these kids. ",
        "Marshall: I'm glad to do it. ",
        "Bonnie: Well, most of the kids made their \r\nown costumes. ",
        "Sarah: Yeah, except for us. Bonnie found \r\nthese. We're dressed for carnival. ",
        "Bonnie: Sarah wanted to match. ",
        "Marshall: What's not to like? ",
        "Sarah: Since we're studying Brazil in \r\nschool, I thought maybe we could take some pictures later? I see Melanie over \r\nthere. I'll be right back. ",
        "Troy: Well, it sounds like Sarah\u2019s doing \r\ngreat. ",
        "Bonnie: Well, she loves Oakdale High, and \r\nshe's met a lot of new friends. ",
        "Marshall: She's even talking about joining \r\nthe girls' lacrosse team. ",
        "Troy: Well, I've never seen her so confident \r\nand happy. Sounds like things are going great. ",
        "Marshall: Well, Bonnie should take all the \r\ncredit. She's the real reason why Sarah\u2019s doing as beautifully as she is. \r\n",

        "Ben: Can I come in? ",
        "Jessica: Sure, of course. ",
        "Ben: Your office told me to try the station \r\nor the courthouse. The station was closer. ",
        "Jessica: Sorry, the battery on my cell phone \r\ndied on the way over here. I have a meeting with tom. ",
        "Ben: Are you okay? ",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Overwhelmed, you know? The \r\ncase load is out of control. ",
        "Ben: I miss you. ",
        "Jessica: I miss you, too. ",
        "Ben: But not enough to return my phone \r\ncalls? ",
        "Jessica: I did return your phone calls.\r\n",
        "Ben: No, you called my service, and you \r\ncalled my machine at home when you knew I was at work. ",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. That was childish.\r\n",
        "Ben: You still angry? ",
        "Jessica: I guess a little. ",
        "Ben: We still getting married? ",
        "Jessica: Are we? ",
        "Ben: Look, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you \r\nabout Bonnie and Marshall. But you said you wanted Bonnie to be in the wedding \r\nand I just -- I wanted to make that happen. Right motive, wrong move. \r\n",
        "Jessica: I know. And I was wrong. Our \r\nwedding is not a condition of anything. Baby, you know I love you. But when I \r\nget scared -- ",
        "Ben: I know, you shut down. I know that. But \r\nthis being apart, it's just no good -- ",
        "Jessica: I know, but I just can't -- I just \r\ncan't close my eyes and pretend that Bonnie isn't making decisions that I know \r\nare going to hurt her. ",
        "Ben: Look, I don't want to see Bonnie hurt \r\neither, but -- look, we gotta set some ground rules, or we're just going to keep \r\ngoing in circles on this. ",
        "Jessica: What kind of ground rules? \r\n",
        "Ben: Look, Bonnie is living on her own now, \r\nso you have to let her make her own choices. She has chosen to help Sarah. That \r\nmeans that Marshall Travers is going to be a part of the mix, and apparently, \r\nBonnie can live with that. So rule number one -- from here on out, you let \r\nBonnie live her own life. ",

        "Carly: I'm sorry, that stinks. ",
        "Katie: It's all right. Ever since we got \r\nback from Australia, I've been treating him like a disease. So now whenever I \r\nwant to do or say something, he thinks that I just feel sorry for him. \r\n",
        "Carly: Do you? ",
        "Katie: No. ",

        "Katie: No. I haven't found the right time, \r\nstill. ",
        "Carly: Oh. So you thought that you'd be his \r\nnurse and that would help you find the right time? ",
        "Katie: Well, yeah, that was the plan. But \r\nMike seems to want some stranger to help, so -- I guess I'll just have to live \r\nwith that. ",
        "Carly: You'd give up just like that? That's \r\nfunny, you don't seem that upset about it. ",

        "Henry: The concept's very simple. We set you \r\nup in your own private physical therapy center -- in a penthouse in Manhattan, a \r\nbeach house in Venice, something like that. We haven't worked out all the \r\ndetails. But your clients, your patients, well, they're well-to-do, but not \r\nstuffy guys, who need the help of a very hot personal duty nurse/physical \r\ntherapist.

We had something else in \r\ndevelopment, a sorta similar concept -- \"who wants to baby-sit a millionaire?\" I \r\nthink it's gonna be gold. Listen, Carly, you know what? I'm in the middle of a \r\ntalk right now. Can I have my people call you? All right? Is that all right? Is \r\nthat all right, baby? Good. Great.
