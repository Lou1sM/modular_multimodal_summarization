        " Mitzi: Ooh. Oh, oh, no!",
        " Rose: Don't pick that up. Don't, stop it. Don't lift a finger in\r\nthis place. I'm not lifting a finger, you're not lifting a finger. Nothing.",
        " Mitzi: Wow. You're really steamed.",
        " Rose: No, I\u2019m cool. I'm so cool.",
        " Mitzi: Yeah, as cool as Joe \"bag of doughnuts\" back in\r\nAtlantic City.",
        " Rose: You know, I put myself on the line for that broad, Lucinda\r\nWalsh. I saved her company at any risk, right? Win at any costs. Win, win, win.",
        " Mitzi: And you did.",
        " Rose: No. Hello? She did. She won.",
        " Mitzi: Look, I'm sure Ms. Walsh is upstairs right now dreaming up\r\nthe greatest job in the world for you.",
        " Rose: Oh, no, honey. No, I'm like a stooge at the circus cleaning up\r\nbehind the elephants. I got no glory. No cheer in the center ring for that one.",
        " Mitzi: I'm sorry, Rose. Hey, you got me! And take these chewy\r\ncharms.",
        "[Phone rings] oh, God.",
        " Rose: What are you so jumpy for?",
        " Mitzi: Who calls at this hour? Bad news. Bet so.",
        " Rose: Oh, just stop with that. Oh, Cruella De Vil checking in.",
        " Mitzi: Isn't she upstairs?",
        " Rose: No, she's probably out with the suits celebrating. Rose the\r\nchump. You say, \"jump,\" I say, \"how high?\"",
        " Lucinda: Rose, I'm just calling to -- good grief. What on earth is\r\n-- ? What are you doing here?",
        " Rose: You need something?",
        " Mitzi: Oh. Ms. Walsh, I had nothing to do with this mess, okay? It\r\nwas all rose's idea. But if you ask me, you didn't do what you said you were\r\ngonna do.",
        " Rose: Can it. Just can it. Can it. What's the matter with you? You\r\ndon't look so good. Ran into an old husband?",
        " Lucinda: It's Bryant, Rose.",

        " Billy: Hey, I put my stuff in Katie\u2019s old room. Adam, look, I'm\r\nsorry that you got pulled into this.",
        " Adam: Hey, no problem. You just completely trashed Bryant\u2019s life,\r\nand now, he thinks that Abigail and I were in on it.",
        " Billy: I'm gonna track Bryant down tomorrow and explain.",
        " Adam: No, forget it, okay? I don't want you talking for me.",
        " Margo: Hey, look, it's a family reunion. Billy's here.",
        " Billy: Do you guys mind if I crash here tonight?",
        " Margo: No, no, that's fine. Things getting crowded over at Bry's.",
        " Tom: Bryant and Jen are young and in love. Three's definitely a\r\ncrowd.",

        " Margo: You know what? I'll get that. It's probably the station.\r\nHello?",
        " John: Hello, Margo. It's John. I've got to get a hold of Craig.\r\nBryant's been in an accident, an automobile accident.",
        " Margo: Is he okay?",
        " John: He's in surgery at the moment.",
        " Margo: Okay, well, I'm on my way. I'll get a hold of Craig, and I'll\r\nmeet you at the hospital. John, Bryant will be all right, won't he?",

        " Craig: Well, Bryant must have his cell phone turned off.",
        " Carly: Well, that's too bad. Easy come, easy go.",
        " Craig: Carly, the money's as good as mine.",
        " Carly: Listen, behind door number one is Paul Ryan -- an honest,\r\nreputable business man offering me my own clothing line and a truckload of money\r\nto boot. Behind door number two -- well, there's you with yet another one of\r\nyour get-poor-quick schemes. What shall I do? All or nothing? I think I'll take\r\nall.",
        " Craig: Oh, come on, Carly. Paul is momma's boy. Barbara's the\r\ncheese. He can't give you the freedom you could have working for yourself. What,\r\nyou're gonna do all the work, Barbara gets all the credit? You'll hate yourself.",
        " Carly: If and when your son comes to me and tells me he's handing\r\nyou $1 million to bankroll me, then I will think about it.",
        " Craig: I will track him down and deliver him to you personally.",
        " Carly: Good. Fair enough. And if you have that money -- and that is\r\na huge if -- then I will tell Paul that I'm out, and he will have to get himself\r\nanother designer.",
        " Craig: This is gonna be the greatest adventure of your life, Carly.\r\nYou will be the princess of 7th Avenue, and with me as your trusted adviser;\r\nyou'll be able to command any price you want. The press is gonna run out of\r\nwords to describe your genius, and the profits will come rolling in like the\r\nmighty Mississippi.",
        "[Phone rings] oh, wait. It's probably Bryant now. It's gonna happen, Carly. I\r\ntell you, I can feel it. Bryant, your timing is perfect.",
        " Margo: Craig, it's me. I just got a call from John at the hospital.\r\nBryant's been in a car accident.",
        " Craig: Is he all right?",
        " Margo: John said that he's in surgery. I can't give you any other\r\ndetails.",

        " Adam: Where are you going?",
        " Billy: Look, I've got to go find Jennifer.",
        " Adam: You and Jen are the people who put Bryant in that hospital. Is\r\nit a coincidence that he had a wreck tonight? No. It's because he was too\r\nfreaked out to be behind the wheel, and whose fault is that, bill, huh? Whose?",
        " Margo: Okay. Are you guys ready to go?",
        " Adam: Actually, I\u2019m gonna go in my car. I'm gonna drive around and\r\nfind Abigail and tell her everything that's going on.",
        " Margo: Okay. I'll call you when I get to the hospital.",
        " Tom: Okay, drive carefully.",
        " Margo: Yeah, yeah. Billy, you want a ride with me?",
        " Billy: No. I don't do too well in hospitals. I'm just gonna wait\r\nhere with Tom until we hear more stuff.",
        " Tom: All right. I'm gonna walk you to the car.",
        " Margo: All right.",
        " Adam: Congratulations. You finally thought about somebody else\r\nbesides yourself for once.",
        " Billy: Look, Adam, you've gotta promise me that if you get to that\r\nhospital and it's bad, then you've got to call Jen. Okay, no matter what has\r\nhappened, she cares about Bryant, okay? Adam, come on. Do that for your sister,\r\nokay? Give her that chance.",

        " Jennifer: Oh, you're up.",
        " Hal: We have to talk.",
        " Jennifer: Why?",
        " Hal: Bryant had a car accident on Route 23. He's in the hospital.",
        " Jennifer: Oh, my God.",
        " Hal: I talked to the officers on the scene. The paramedics got there\r\nvery quickly. He was conscious when they arrived.",
        " Jennifer: That's good, right? That means that he'll be okay, dad?",
        " Hal: It's a very good sign. They rushed him to memorial.",
        " Jennifer: I have to go. I have to go see him. Will you take me,\r\nplease?",

        " Emily: I'm sorry. You didn't think who would be back so soon?",
        " Carly: Get lost, Emily. I'm out of the headline-making business.\r\nYou'll want to sift through some garbage, though, because I heard a guy across\r\nthe courtyard is having an affair with our congresswoman.",
        " Emily: Are you kidding me?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        " Carly: You are pathetic.",
        " Emily: Very funny, Carly. I'm actually looking for Craig.",
        " Carly: He isn't here.",
        " Emily: \"Isn't here\" as in \"not here\" or\r\n\"not here, hiding in another room\" not here?",
        " Carly: Well, come in. Look for yourself. Snoop around. I know you\r\nwant to look in the bedroom. It's that way.",
        " Emily: So he's really not here? Because I heard on the police band\r\nthat Bryant\u2019s been in a car accident.",
        " Carly: He knows. Margo called him. He's on his way to the hospital\r\nnow. Do you happen to know if it's serious?",
        " Emily: A source of mine at the hospital said there was some internal\r\nbleeding. That's why he's in the O.R.",
        " Carly: Do Hal and Jennifer know?",
        " Emily: No, not yet.",
        " Carly: Hal should know. I think he should know.",
        " Emily: Wow. I'm really impressed.",
        " Carly: I'm getting the machine, of course.",
        " Emily: And the way you just turn on the compassion like that, it's\r\njust amazing.",
        " Carly: Oh, stuff it! No, not you, Hal. Listen, it's Carly. Would you\r\n-- would you call me as soon as you get in? It's really important, okay? Thanks.",
        " Emily: I could have done that, you know.",
        " Carly: Well, Emily, I think he's much more likely to call back the\r\nmother of his son than his -- well, what exactly are you?",
        " Emily: Friend, Carly. I'm a friend.",
        " Carly: You're a friend? Okay., Then why don't you do us all a favor\r\nand act like a friend and just lay off Craig and his family tonight, all right?",
        " Emily: All this from the candy striper who went after Julia Snyder\r\nin a psych ward? You know, it's really too bad your little fashion column didn't\r\nwork out at \"The Intruder.\" A girl like you could go far in my biz.",
        " Carly: I do have my standards, Emily.",
        " Emily: Yeah, well, I've made a killing on your standards, Carly.",
        " Carly: Okay, well, we could stay here. Or we could -- we could\r\nexchange insults all night if we wanted to. Or you could just have a cup of\r\ncoffee.",
        " Emily: Is that a joke or an invitation?",
        " Carly: It's gonna be a very long night, I think, and you did work\r\novertime to save Craig\u2019s butt during the trial, so --",
        " Emily: Yeah. Yeah, coffee sounds nice.",
        " Carly: Good. Well, it's only half a cup. Hope that's okay, but I'll\r\nmake some more.",
        " Emily: Thanks.",
        " Carly: So -- I take it that you and Hal have been spending quite a\r\nbit of time together, yeah?",
        " Emily: And this is your business because?",
        " Carly: Because underneath that bulldog scowl of his lies a heart of\r\ngold. And if everybody else in the world was gonna steamroll you, he'd be the\r\nfirst person to put out his hand and pull you to safety.",
        " Emily: Yeah. I've noticed.",
        " Carly: Just don't hurt him, okay?",
        " Emily: You mean like you did?",
        " Carly: He deserves some happiness.",
        " Emily: Well, at last. Finally something we both agree on. {Carly\r\nmoans]",
        " Carly: Okay, I'm gonna make that pot of coffee. And if, when I come\r\nback, any of my pillows are out of place, I can tell you've been snooping\r\naround. You're gonna be wearing the entire pot.",

        " Craig: Where's my son?",
        " John: Oh. Listen, I'm glad Margo found you. Your son is in surgery,\r\nbut everything has been textbook so far.",
        " Craig: What does that mean? And why didn't you call me?",
        " John: I did. I called the penthouse.",
        " Lucinda: You don't have to defend yourself to him, darling.",
        " John: Unfortunately, I don't have your cell phone number.",
        " Craig: Well, what's his condition?",
        " John: His condition is serious but stable, all right? I just spoke\r\nwith the O.R. they've got the bleeding under control, and they should be closing\r\nsoon.",
        " Rose: Oh, happy days.",
        " Lucinda: This is when you say \"thank you,\" Craig. Thank\r\nyou, because John has been supervising Bryant ever since he came into the E.R.",
        " John: He's not out of the woods yet. With the kind of injuries he\r\nhas, there's always a possibility of complications.",
        " Rose: Well, you don't expect any, though, right? I mean, they sew\r\nhim up, and everything's gonna be okay.",
        " Craig: What kind of complications?",
        " John: There's infection, for one, and there's paralysis. But let's\r\nnot invite trouble, all right? Come on. He's -- everything looks to be -- well,\r\nit's headed towards a good recovery. You've just got to give his body time to\r\nheal, and he should be fine.",
        " Craig: Well, what do you know about the accident? Were there other\r\nvictims?",
        " John: As far as I know, it was a single-car accident. Bryant lost\r\ncontrol. He went into a tree. But I don't have all the details.",
        " Lucinda: Darling, when can we see him?",
        " John: As soon as he's in recovery, I will come, and I will get the\r\nfamily. All right?",
        " Craig: All right.",
        " Lucinda: Hey, you can't use that thing.",
        " Craig: I have to call Sierra.",
        " Lucinda: She's on her way.",
        " Craig: Did you call her?",
        " Lucinda: As soon as I found out.",
        " Craig: What did you tell her?",
        " Lucinda: I told her the truth. I told her what happened. I mean, the\r\ntruth is a foreign concept to you.",
        " Craig: She's 2,000 miles away. She's gotta be terrified. I don't\r\nwant her traveling.",
        " Lucinda: This is his mother! She has a right to know.",
        " Craig: Do you belong here?",
        " Lucinda: Do I belong here? I think I do, because I'm his\r\ngrandmother, all right? And I care about him. What, you want to have me hustled\r\nout of here, get me out of everything? Is that what you want?",
        " Craig: All right, just -- just stay out of the way.",
        " Lucinda: There will be some internal injuries around here if you go\r\non like that.",
        " Rose: People --",
        " Lucinda: I've had enough of this.",
        " Margo: Where is Bryant? Where is Bryant?",
        " Rose: John said he's doing better. He's in surgery right now.",
        " Margo: Oh, good. Thank God.",
        " Rose: You got here just in time, because these two were gonna --",
        " Margo: Oh, the two of you, please! Will you knock it off for\r\nBryant\u2019s sake if nothing else?",
        " Craig: Come here. I want to know everything the police have.",
        " Margo: Well, I called the station on the way down. There were no\r\nother cars involved from the tire tracks. Apparently, he was traveling at a high\r\nrate of speed.",
        " Craig: Was he drinking?",
        " Margo: No, no. There's no alcohol, but Craig, he wasn't wearing his\r\nseat belt.",
        " Craig: No, no, no. That's impossible. He always wore his seat belt.\r\nI drilled it into him from the moment he first got behind the wheel, and he was\r\nalways -- and he was extra-cautious ever since the accident with parker.",
        " Margo: I understand that, but I'm just telling you what they found\r\nat the scene. Look, I'm gonna call the state police and see what else they have.",
        " Craig: Well, please do it fast, Margo, because something is very\r\nwrong here. I saw him just earlier tonight at the cabin, and the place was a\r\nmess. He wasn't himself. He was disconnected.",
        " Margo: Well, did you talk to him?",
        " Craig: Well, no. He didn't want to talk, and I was preoccupied with\r\na business deal.",
        " Margo: Oh, Craig --",
        " Craig: Well, I had a proposition for him! I thought he was gonna be\r\nall over me about it, but he was resigned. He was just resigned to let me go. I\r\nshouldn't have left him like that. I should have made him talk to me at least.",
        " Margo: That usually doesn't work too well.",
        " Craig: I should have made him talk to me.",
        " Margo: You know what? They're gonna let you see him soon, Craig, and\r\nI\u2019m sure as soon as he's feeling better, he'll tell you what's bothering him.",
        " Craig: Well, whatever it is, Margo, it has to be bad, 'cause why\r\nelse would he be driving alone, speeding on a two-lane road without a seat belt?\r\nWhat could be so bad it would make Bryant not even care whether he lived or\r\ndied?",
        "",
        " Nick: Look, Abigail, I know it's been a tough night, but I\u2019m sure\r\nthings are gonna work out, and your friends are gonna get through this.",
        " Abigail: You don't know Bryant. Things have always fallen his way.\r\nHe is rich, and he's charming, and he's handsome. You know, guys like him,\r\nthey're not used to losing. They're the heartbreakers, not the other way around.",
        " Nick: Well then, this is gonna be a good experience for him. You\r\nknow, the tough ones usually are.",
        " Abigail: Do you really think it's gonna be okay?",
        " Nick: Abigail, I've seen a lot worse situations work out. Bryant and\r\nJen, they're gonna get through this, and they may even end up friends again. Who\r\nknows?",
        " Abigail: I hope so.",
        " Adam: Hi.",
        " Abigail: Oh, hi. I'm so glad you're here. Everything's a mess.\r\nBryant found Jen and Billy together.",
        " Adam: Yeah, yeah, I know. Bryant was at the house earlier, and he\r\ntotally blew up on me, and he knew that we found out about Billy and Jen and we\r\nkept it from him.",
        " Abigail: He must feel awful.",
        " Adam: Abigail, something happened.",
        " Abigail: What? What could be worse than this? What?",
        " Adam: Bryant's car hit a tree. He's at memorial.",
        " Abigail: Oh, my God. Is he okay?",
        " Adam: Yeah, yeah. He's in surgery now, so it doesn't look that good.\r\nI'm on my way right now.",
        " Abigail: Adam, I'm coming with you.",
        " Adam: All right. You want some help packing your stuff?",
        " Abigail: I'll get it later.",
        " Nick: Look, I\u2019m sorry. I hope your friend's gonna be all right.",
        " Abigail: Thanks, Nick.",
        " Margo: The state police confirmed what we know so far. He was\r\nspeeding. They found his cell phone.",
        " Craig: The seat belt?",
        " Margo: They confirmed that he was not wearing his seat belt.",
        " Lucinda: But that doesn't seem right. After the accident, he swore\r\n-- he would always wear his seat belt.",
        " Rose: What about the air bag, did it work?",
        " Margo: The air bag deployed on impact, but the air bag alone is not\r\nas effective without seat belts. Now, the good news is, he was conscious at the\r\nscene. He was able to tell them that his name is Bryant Montgomery. But he\r\npassed out while the paramedics were working on him. My guess is that he swerved\r\nback into the lane, and he lost control. It happens, more often than you think,\r\nit does, especially with kids that age. I'm going to follow up on it tomorrow.\r\nThe state police will fax me their final report.",

        " Rose: I'm no state cop, but that does not sound like Bryant.",

        " Lily: Mother, how is he?",
        " Lucinda: Sweetheart, I told you you didn't have to come.",
        " Lily: I had to come. Of course I had to be here. How's Bryant?",
        " Lucinda: Well, he's in surgery still.",
        " Rose: But Dr. Dixon thinks he's gonna be okay.",
        " Lily: Thank goodness. Did you call Sierra?",
        " Lucinda: She's on her way.",
        " Lily: All right, good. Hopefully, we'll have some good news before\r\nshe gets here.",

        " Craig: How's Bryant? Can I see him?",
        " John: No, I\u2019m sorry.",
        " Craig: I'm his father. I think I have the right to see him! Who is\r\nhis surgeon? Let me talk to him then.",
        " John: Craig, you got to hear this. Something completely unexpected\r\nhappened, as Dr. Sherman was getting ready to close. For reasons we don't\r\nunderstand, Bryant\u2019s heart stopped.",
        "[Lucinda gasps]",
        " Lucinda: Oh, no.",
        " John: We tried to revive him. We worked for almost a half an hour.\r\nBut I'm sorry, he died on the table.",
        " Lucinda: No! How? How? He's young! He's young and he's strong! How\r\ncould his heart stop?!",
        " John: He obviously experienced severe trauma during the crash, much\r\nmore than we first thought. It was just too much. His heart couldn't take it,\r\neven though he was a young man.",

        " Jennifer: Oh, Bryant, no! No, Bryant! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\r\nDon't! I'm sorry.",
        " Adam: Mom. Mom, how is he?",
        " Margo: Uh -- he's gone, Adam. I'm sorry. He died on the operating\r\ntable",
        " Abigail: No! No!",
        " Adam: No, no, no!",
        " Jennifer: No! I don't want anything -- I don't want to calm down!\r\nJust leave me alone!",
        " Hal: Something mild, sweetheart.",
        " Jennifer: Why, daddy? So I don't feel it? So I don't really believe\r\nthat he's gone?",
        " Hal: How about John prescribes something for later.",
        " John: I think it might be a good idea, Jen.",
        " Jennifer: Fine, I just don't care! Just let me be by myself for a\r\nfew minutes, please.",
        " John: I'll leave something outside.",
