        "Mike: \r\nGlenda? Glenda, what happened? ",
        "Glenda: Oh! \r\nI'm gonna be a star. ",
        "[Glenda \r\nlaughing] ",
        "Katie: \r\nWeird, isn't it? She seemed like super nurse at the hospital. ",
        "Glenda: Oh, \r\nthat nice producer said that -- ",
        "Katie: Oh, \r\nyou need to go home now, okay? ",
        "Glenda: -- \r\nLive together. ",
        "Katie: No, \r\nyou need to go home. ",
        "Mike: What \r\nnice producer? ",
        "Katie: She \r\ndoesn't know what she's talking about. She's drunk, Mike. ",
        "Glenda: No, \r\nthe one that's gonna make a reality show starring me and some mysterious \r\nmillionaire. His name's Harvey or Harry. ",
        "Katie: No, \r\nyou're tanked and -- you're tanked and you need to go home! ",
        "Glenda: Oh, \r\nlet nursie-nursie check your bandages. ",
        "Katie: No. \r\nNo checking! You're fired! All right? Go! ",
        "Glenda: You \r\ncan't fire me. Your girlfriend can't fire me. ",
        "Mike: She's \r\nnot my girlfriend. ",
        "Glenda: So \r\nI'm not fired. ",
        "Mike: I'm \r\nsorry. I'm sorry, but you are. I've got enough problems. I don't need a nurse \r\nwith a drinking problem. ",
        "Glenda: Oh, \r\ngreat. Just ruin my television career. ",
        "Katie: I'll \r\ncall nursie-nursie a cab. It looks like you're gonna need someone else to take \r\ncare of you now. ",
        "Mike: Yeah, \r\nbut you're not that someone. ",
        "",
        "Bonnie: So \r\nwhat's the answer? Who is the real Marshall Travers? The man who raped my mother \r\nor the man who threw this wonderful party for his daughter? ",
        "Marshall: \r\nYou know, I never meant to hurt Jessica. I was obsessed, half in love. And I \r\ncrossed a line, Bonnie, that, I swear, at the time I didn't even know was there.\r\n",
        "Bonnie: That \r\ndoesn't explain why you made things worse for her. After you were charged, you \r\ncontinued to humiliate her. You ran a smear campaign. You tried to ruin her \r\nreputation. ",
        "Marshall: I \r\nwas wrong. Bonnie, when you go to law school, when you compete for partnerships, \r\nit's easy to forget that some things matter more than winning. ",
        "Bonnie: I've \r\nmet your father, Marshall. I know for a fact he didn't forget to teach you the \r\ndifference between right and wrong. ",
        "Marshall: \r\nWell, lately, I've been thinking a lot about something else he taught me. How to \r\nbe a good dad. And a good friend. And I realized -- ",
        "Bonnie: Yes?\r\n",
        "Marshall: I \r\nrealized that that's the kind of man I want to be. I don't want to make the \r\nmistakes like the mistakes I made with your mother. I want to pay attention to \r\nSarah\u2019s feelings. And yours. ",
        "Sarah: Come \r\non, we're going to play the mummy game. And you guys are going to make an \r\nexcellent pair. Come on. ",
        "",
        "Ben: Forcing \r\nTravers' own daughter testify against him? Don't you think the child has been \r\nthrough enough? ",
        "Jessica: The \r\nman raped me, Ben. He does not get to set up house with my daughter. ",
        "Tom: Jess, \r\nJess, even testimony from Sarah doesn't guarantee us a conviction. ",
        "Ben: What do \r\nyou think Travers is going to do when he finds out that you intend to put Sarah \r\non the stand? ",
        "Jessica: In \r\na perfect world? He'll pack up his bags, and he'll get out of Oakdale, and there \r\nwon't even be a trial. ",
        "Ben: What if \r\nhe decides to stay and fight? ",
        "Jessica: \r\nThen Sarah takes the stand. Look, it's Marshall\u2019s \r\ncall. If he doesn't want to subject his child to shame and humiliation, then he \r\nhas to leave my child alone. ",
        "",
        "Jennifer: \r\nYou want me to move out? Paul, you can't be serious. ",
        "Rose: I \r\nthink you got ten minutes to get out of here. It doesn't get more serious than \r\nthat. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nPaul, please. ",
        "Paul: This \r\ndiscussion is over. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nWhat happened when I was gone? What did Rose say to you? ",
        "Paul: Rose \r\ndidn't say a word. You did all the talking. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nCome on, give me a number. How much will it take this time just to break them \r\napart for good? ",
        "Dusty: Hey, \r\nJennifer, I don't want your money. If Rose wants your brother, that's up to her.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: \r\nNo, she wants to hurt him. ",
        "Dusty: \r\nEverybody gets hurt. You understand? Families get broken up. Life goes on. You \r\ndo what you got to do. Watch the crossfire. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nFine. I'll get Rose away from Paul with or without your help. I don't know where \r\nthat tape came from. ",
        "Paul: It \r\ndoesn't matter where it came from. I think it spells out pretty clearly what you \r\nand Dusty were doing! Jennifer, why? Why would you do this to me? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nNo, Paul, because -- because I love you. Because I will not stand by and watch \r\nthis lying piece of trash hurt you again! ",
        "Rose: Hey, \r\nhey, who you're calling names? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nListen, Paul, you're my brother. You're my brother. I was there before you put \r\nthe armor on. I know -- I know you inside. You still can get hurt, and I can't \r\nstand to watch that again. ",
        "Paul: Did \r\nBarbara coach you? Because you're the spitting image of her right now. \r\n",
        "Jennifer: \r\nPaul, don't do that. ",
        "Paul: I \r\ntried, but she won. Congratulations. You're like a little, miniature Barbara.\r\n",
        "",
        "Holden: \r\nThese are yours. ",
        "Dusty: Your \r\nson needs those to open up tomorrow. ",
        "Holden: \r\nAaron is not going to be opening or closing this place. So take him off the \r\nschedule. He is done working for you. ",
        "Dusty: Well, \r\nhe better tell me that himself. ",
        "Holden: \r\nMaybe you didn't hear what I said. My kid -- ",
        "Dusty: Your \r\nkid's a man! Or at least he's trying to be. ",
        "Holden: By \r\nhelping you run a bookie joint? By making drops for you and getting busted for \r\nit? My kid isn't becoming a man. He's becoming you. ",
        "Molly: He \r\ncould do a lot worse. ",
        "",
        "Jennifer: \r\nNo, Paul, do not compare me to Mom. That is not fair. ",
        "Rose: Why \r\nnot? 'Cause your mom puts us through hell, and you are obviously taking over her \r\njob, judging by that tape. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nOh, how do they say it in Jersey, Rose? Hmm? Oh, yeah. Butt out! This argument \r\nis between my brother and me. ",
        "Rose: Well, \r\nmaybe you're not hearing your brother when he says the \"Donnie and Marie\" show \r\nhas been canceled. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nOh, you would love that, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? Rose is trying to cut you \r\noff from everyone who loves you, Paul. You -- you hate our family, and you're \r\nnot going to be satisfied until Paul hates the rest of us! ",
        "Paul: Jen, \r\nyou need to stop it. You're way out of line. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nReally? Oh, well, unfortunately, I don't have a tape recorder. But your fianc\u00e9e \r\nhere was telling me that taking you away from this crazy family would be the \r\nbest wedding present that she could give you. ",
        "Rose: I \r\nwanted to get him away from the back stabbing, the manipulation, this. \r\n",
        "Jennifer: \r\nWell, what about Will, Rose? Hmm? Come on. You shouldn't have secrets between \r\ncouples. Did you or did you not say that you do not care about our brother?\r\n",
        "Rose: Oh, I \r\n-- I love Will, you know that. What I meant -- you're twisting everything \r\naround, clearly -- that you don't have to be responsible for the rest of the \r\nworld, that you should get what you want -- take care of yourself for a change.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: \r\nRight, so when I was talking about you guys moving to Paris \r\nand how much it is going to hurt Will, you did not say -- and I quote -- \"would \r\nyou shut up about Will? I don't care about Will!\" ",
        "Paul: You \r\nsaid that? ",
        "Rose: She's \r\nleaving out a very, very important part. That Will can come visit us any time he \r\nwants to. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nShe's just trying to appease you, Paul. I'm the one who understands how much \r\nWill means to you. I'm the one who knows how much you hurt when you break a \r\npromise to your brother. So why am I a threat? Why am I the one you want to \r\nthrow out? ",
        "Paul: \r\nBecause, Jennifer, you are the one who tried to set me up! ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nPaul, I am -- I am so -- I am so sorry. ",
        "Paul: Oh.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: I \r\nshould've never gone to Dusty. I know that, but I didn't know what else to do. I \r\ndon't know how to get through to you! ",
        "Paul: Well, \r\nthen, by all means, set me up. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nYou know, that would've never been an option if Dusty and Rose didn't still have \r\na thing for each other. ",
        "Rose: I \r\ndon't know what Dusty's been telling you, but let me make this very clear to you \r\n-- what I had with Dusty is over! ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nRight. Right. So over that you went and got engaged to my brother just to get \r\nback at Dusty for having a quickie with Molly! ",
        "Rose: I got \r\nengaged to your brother because I love him! ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nJust like you loved Dusty. Watch out, Paul. You're marrying a woman here who \r\ncould be ga-ga over a guy one day and then be ordering a wedding cake with his \r\nworst enemy the next. ",
        "Paul: Stop, \r\nJennifer, stop it. You have no idea what you're talking about. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nLet me just give you one piece of advice. I'd watch out for the future Mrs. Paul \r\nRyan when she's alone in Paris. 'Cause I wouldn't want you to come home to your \r\napartment and find her in bed with a waiter from the corner bistro! ",
        "Paul: Hold \r\nit. Don't you dare lay a hand on my sister. ",
        "",
        "Marshall: \r\nHey, those kids over there are going to beat us! ",
        "Troy: Five, \r\nfour, three, two, one! And the winners are -- Mattie and Derek! ",
        "Bonnie: Oh, \r\nthat's okay. That's okay. Next year, baby, next year we are going to win this! \r\nDoes anyone else want some punch? ",
        "Marshall: \r\nYeah, sure. Sarah? ",
        "Sarah: Yeah, \r\nI'll have some. ",
        "Bonnie: \r\nOkay, be right back. ",
        "Sarah: You \r\nlook like a giant marshmallow. ",
        "Troy: \r\nCongratulations, Bonnie. ",
        "Bonnie: Oh, \r\nfor what? 'Cause we just lost. ",
        "Troy: The \r\ngame, maybe, but you and Marshall are looking pretty good as co-parents. It \r\nwasn't so long ago you were willing to risk jail rather than allow Marshall to \r\nbe a father to Sarah. ",
        "Bonnie: \r\nWell, I decided to put my feelings for Marshall \r\naside, for Sarah\u2019s sake. I'm glad that I did. Otherwise, I may have never seen \r\nwhat kind of father he could really be. ",
        "Troy: I'm \r\nglad things worked out this way. ",
        "Bonnie: Me, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Troy: We're \r\na little short on happy endings around here. ",
        "Sarah: \r\nBonnie, come on. ",
        "Bonnie: I \r\nthought I was supposed to be getting punch. ",
        "Marshall: \r\nWell, now it's time to bob for apples. ",
        "Bonnie: Oh, \r\nno. ",
        "Marshall: \r\nAnd don't even try to tell me you're worried about messing up your hair. \r\n",
        "Bonnie: Are \r\nyou kidding me? You don't know how long I've waited to go tell you go soak your \r\nhead. ",
        "",
        "Jessica: So, \r\nwhat did the judge say? ",
        "Tom: Well, \r\nhe can't advise directly, but he had some good advice for me -- stay away from \r\nthis case. ",
        "Jessica: So \r\nyou're not going to prosecute? ",
        "Tom: A new \r\ntrial is going to be risky and expensive, and I can't waste taxpayers' money \r\ntrying to settle something personal. ",
        "Jessica: I \r\nsee. I never thought you'd let me down, Tom. ",
        "Tom: Well, \r\nhow about a compromise? How about I don't take the case to trial but I green \r\nlight an arrest? That way, Marshall will be arrested for the crime of rape, and \r\nsince he doesn't have to know I won't be taking the case forward -- ",
        "Jessica: \r\nThen I can use the prospect of putting Sarah on the stand as leverage? \r\n",
        "Tom: You can \r\ndo anything you want. You can paste his picture all over the front of \"The City \r\nTimes.\" You can tell him his daughter's going to testify that he admitted raping \r\nyou. You can use all the pressure you want. There just won't be a trial. \r\nBesides, I don't think you want to put a troubled 15-year-old through that kind \r\nof trauma. ",
        "Jessica: No, \r\nno, of course, I don\u2019t. ",
        "Tom: Do I \r\nissue an arrest warrant? ",
        "Jessica: Can \r\nyou live with what's about to happen? ",
        "Ben: I don't \r\nlike it. ",
        "Jessica: \r\nWell, I don't like it either, Ben. I mean, no one likes it. ",
        "Ben: \r\nMarshall Travers isn't the only one who's going to have his face plastered all \r\nover the front page of \"The City Times.\" Now, you remember the first trial. They \r\ncouldn't decide who was telling the truth and who wasn\u2019t. I don't want to open \r\nthe door to that kind of pain again, Jess. ",
        "Jessica: But \r\nthat door is open for me. And now that Bonnie's involved, it's the only thing I \r\ncan think of. I mean, I honestly believe this is the only way that we can get \r\nMarshall out of our lives for good. Ben, can you stand by me while I fight this \r\nfight? ",
        "Ben: Yeah. \r\nNothing else I can do. ",
        "Jessica: \r\nLet's do it. Have Marshall arrested and charged. ",
        "Tom: Once \r\nyou start this, there is no turning back. You're sure this is what you want?\r\n",
        "Jessica: \r\nYeah, I'm sure. ",
        "",
        "Katie: Well, \r\nI got nurse Glenda into a cab. Oh, she smells like a frat house at 4:00 a.m.",
        "Mike: I just \r\ndon't get it. I mean, she had incredible references. I never would've pegged her \r\nas the type to show up drunk to work -- especially on the first day. ",
        "Katie: Do I \r\nneed a shower? ",
        "Mike: No, \r\nyou're fine. You know, and so am I. So get out of here. ",
        "Katie: It's \r\ngoing to be ages before you're even close to being fine. ",
        "Mike: It's \r\nnot your problem, all right? You didn't do this to me. ",
        "Katie: Well, \r\nyou know what? You still need help, so just get used to the fact that I'm \r\nsticking around. ",
        "Mike: Hey, \r\nall I needed was to be home and out of the hospital, and I am. So go. \r\n",

        "Sarah: \r\nDaddy? ",
        "Cop #4: You \r\nhave the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be held against you in a \r\ncourt of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an \r\nattorney, one will be provided for you. ",

        "Molly: \r\nHolden, Dusty's done a lot for Aaron. I don't know, I think you should be \r\ngrateful. ",
        "Holden: \r\nYou're right. Lily and I owe you a big thanks. If you hadn't been around, Aaron \r\nnever would have been arrested. ",
        "Molly: Aaron \r\nknew exactly what he was getting into. He knew the possible consequences, and he \r\ntook the risk anyway. And if it weren't for Dusty, Aaron would be in jail.\r\n",
        "Dusty: It's \r\nokay. I can defend myself. ",
        "Molly: I'm \r\nnot defending you or anybody else. I just want the facts to be kept on the \r\ntable. And the facts are, Dusty is facing criminal charges. Aaron is not. \r\n",
        "Holden: \r\nAaron had no idea what he was getting involved with. You had him running errands \r\nlike he was going to the store for milk and forgot to tell him that he might end \r\nup get busted. ",
        "Dusty: \r\nMaking the kind of money your son was making, believe me when I say he knew that \r\nhe wasn't making a milk run. ",
        "Holden: You \r\nknow, I tried to tell him that you were going to get him into trouble, but he \r\njust wouldn't listen. ",
        "Dusty: Well, \r\nyou know, maybe 'cause your cousin's a top cop he thought he had some kind of \r\nprotection. ",
        "Holden: No, \r\nmy family doesn't work that way. That's why when Jack told me what was going \r\ndown I let Aaron suffer the consequences. ",

        "Paul: What \r\nshe's trying to do is protect me from the people in my family who were trying to \r\nhurt me. And that used to be like a very small club -- it was James and Barbara. \r\nNow, for some reason, you've decided that you want to join the club. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nNo, just because I happen to agree with Mom on one thing, does not mean that I \r\nam suddenly joining her team. I would never turn on you, Paul. You're my \r\nbrother. Do you have any idea how much I love you? ",

        "Paul: Oh, \r\nstop it. No, you're just saying that because you want to think that. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nNo, I do not want to think that! I wish to God that she loved you the way that \r\nyou deserve to be loved. But she doesn't, and I know it. Paul, that is the \r\nreason why she wants me kicked out, because she knows I am not fooled by her.\r\n",
