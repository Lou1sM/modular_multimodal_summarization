        "Jack: If I stay like this much longer, I'm going to need a knee replacement.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry. -- I wasn't expecting --",
        "Jack: No, I know it's kind of out of the blue, but it felt so right, Janet. So what do you say? Will you?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here.",
        "Jack: You got that right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why is it that every time Mama goes away this fridge is bare and empty?",
        "Meg: You are so sweet to be looking at after me, but it's really not necessary. And in a way, I'm kind of glad Mama wasn't here to see me come home with my tail between my legs.",
        "Holden: Well, you did what you needed to do.",
        "Meg: It's just that everybody warned me, Holden, and I wouldn't listen. I was just so sure Paul had changed. I thought that having this baby would make him a better person.",
        "Holden: Paul will always be Paul.",
        "Meg: I still love him, Holden.",
        "Holden: I know you do.",
        "Meg: He's just not stable right now. He needs to get help.",
        "Holden: Well, you're doing the right thing.",
        "Meg: Then why do I feel like I let Paul down? That I'm just making things worse?",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Paul: Meg? Come on, Meg, I know you're in there. Open up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what, there is a real upside to you taking over Paul's company. I get to spend all this time with you.",
        "Dusty: I've got a plane to catch.",
        "Emily: Really? Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: New York City. I got to convince these Wall Street types that Worldwide is still in good hands.",
        "Emily: Oh. How long are you going to be gone?",
        "Dusty: The rest of the week.",
        "Emily: The rest of the week? All those nights in a hotel room -- aren't you going to get lonely?",
        "Dusty: Well I've got work to do.",
        "Emily: Well, lucky for you, I know my way around the big apple.",
        "Dusty: Are you inviting yourself on my business trip?",
        "Emily: As a matter of fact, I am. Do you got a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where is she?",
        "Holden: She doesn't want to see you.",
        "Paul: I want to see her --",
        "Holden: No, no, no, you can't go there --",
        "Paul: Holden, she's still my wife. I have rights.",
        "Holden: Yeah, and so does Meg. It was her choice for this separation.",
        "Paul: Please, please just let me talk to her.",
        "Holden: You really don't want her to see you like this. You need to get it together. Otherwise, she's never going to take you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I've got work to do in New York. And you've got a paper to run.",
        "Emily: Hey, no worries. That's why I have an assistant managing editor. She can step up for a few days.",
        "Dusty: We wouldn't have time, anyway. I've got meetings day and night.",
        "Emily: Dusty, you're going to New York. You have to make time to play. And lucky for you, you have someone to play with.",
        "Dusty: I don't want you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry. Honestly, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Jack: Then why didn't you just walk away?",
        "Carly: Well, I should have, I guess. I was just -- shocked.",
        "Janet: Me, too.",
        "Jack: This wasn't planned. It was kind of spur of the moment --",
        "Carly: You do not need to explain anything to me, Jack. You have every right.",
        "Jack: No, I know -- I know that. I do. Just -- I didn't mean it to be uncomfortable -- for anyone.",
        "Carly: I understand.",
        "Jack: I hope.",
        "Carly: I do. I do.",
        "Janet: I'm still here.",
        "Carly: Right. Right. Okay, I'm going to go. Good luck.",
        "Jack: That's not exactly how I wanted it to, you know.",
        "Janet: Yeah, you think?",
        "Jack: So -- what do we do now? Do we pick up where we left off -- some --?",
        "Janet: Jack, Jack -- I am -- I need to think about this, okay?",
        "Jack: Can we just talk about this, please?",
        "Janet: Later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Janet -- that was priceless, Carly. Did you plan that or what?",
        "Carly: How could I have shown up intentionally, Jack, when I had no idea that you would be there? It was most clearly an accident.",
        "Jack: You could've turned around or walked away. But you didn't. Nothing accidental about that, Carly.",
        "Carly: You're right. I should've left before either of you saw me. I suppose I was froze, shocked.",
        "Jack: What was there to be shocked about? You knew that Janet and I were getting closer. Hell, you practically gave us your blessing, for God's sake!",
        "Carly: I know. I did. Did she say yes?",
        "Jack: No. No, she didn't. Because when you showed up, it was kind of a mood killer.",
        "Carly: Well, truth be told, Jack, you hadn't exactly set any particular mood to begin with --",
        "Jack: What are you -- I was down on one knee.",
        "Carly: Yes, in broad daylight, on a crowded street. Not exactly champagne and roses.",
        "Jack: I told you, it wasn't planned.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Did you get a ring?",
        "Jack: No. I thought we would pick it out together.",
        "Carly: Good Lord --",
        "Jack: What --",
        "Carly: Jack, honestly, with all of your marriages and engagements, you ought to know something about romance. About what a woman wants.",
        "Jack: I know what Janet wants, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't think you do. So, you're going to have to do it again. And this time, you're going to have to do it right. With champagne and a ring, and a nice dinner someplace. Someplace really romantic.",
        "Jack: What, no marching band?",
        "Carly: Well, that's not a bad idea. As long as they play something very romantic. Should I talk to Lily? Maybe she can get you a private dining room at the Lakeview --",
        "Jack: Okay, stop it -- stop it, Carly.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: You know what. And I know what. And I see right through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom, can you help me with my nail polish? I keep messing up this right hand.",
        "Janet: Yeah, sure, whatever.",
        "Liberty: Whoa, you look like you got hit by a truck. What's up?",
        "Janet: I don't know what you said to Jack when you went over there, but whatever it was, sure had an effect on him.",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God, why? What happened?",
        "Janet: He proposed to me.",
        "Liberty: Shut up.",
        "Janet: No, I kid you not. Jack asked me to marry him.",
        "Liberty: Oh my God! This is so great!",
        "Janet: Wait --",
        "Liberty: I am so happy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg and our baby are the most important thing in my life.",
        "Holden: Really? Then why would you jeopardize all that by trying to set up Dusty? Meg told me what you did. You were going to hire somebody to plant drugs on him. That's insane.",
        "Paul: Is it? Dusty's after my wife. You, of all people, should know what he's capable of.",
        "Holden: Look, I'm not thrilled that he's back here. But I'm not paranoid.",
        "Paul: Yeah, right.",
        "Holden: Dusty's here. There's nothing we can do about it. Meg has no intention of getting involved with him. They're just friends. You have nothing to worry about --",
        "Paul: Oh, okay -- is that want you told yourself when Dusty had an affair with your wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry if it sounds harsh.",
        "Emily: No, no, it's okay. You don't want me to go with you. It's no big deal.",
        "Dusty: You've been such a good friend. More than a friend.",
        "Emily: What -- what are you trying to say to me?",
        "Dusty: I'm saying it's been great. I wouldn't trade it. But it's not fair to let you think that it's going anywhere.",
        "Emily: Are you giving up on us?",
        "Dusty: I'm saying there is no us. And it's my fault. It's not yours.",
        "Emily: And that's supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Dusty: I keep getting myself into relationships that aren't going anywhere so I won't have to think about the one I lost. The one I can't get back.",
        "Emily: Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, when she died, it -- I can't get over it --",
        "Emily: I never thought I was going to be the next one --",
        "Dusty: I thought I could, but --",
        "Emily: You know, the next love of your life. I really never believed that --",
        "Dusty: But you probably thought with time at --",
        "Emily: I, um -- I honestly don't know what I thought.",
        "Dusty: I just don't want you to think it's going to turn in anything else.",
        "Emily: No, it's cool. I'm okay. It's okay. I get it. It's -- you know what, I couldn't go on the trip anyway. I've got so much -- I've got so much work here, that I couldn't get away. So, you just go and have a safe trip, okay?",
        "Dusty: Take care of yourself.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: It's time for you to go, Paul.",
        "Paul: You know, if Dusty can't get his hands on Meg, he's just going to go after Lily again.",
        "Holden: That's not going to happen.",
        "Paul: Really? Why not?",
        "Holden: The only way Dusty is going to be a threat is if I let him. And I'm not going to do that. You shouldn't do that, either.",
        "Paul: You are so naive sometimes, it's sick.",
        "Holden: You know what? You're the one who's sick. And if you don't get help, Meg is never going to take you back.",
        "Paul: Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you about Dusty.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Meg: I heard everything you said. Thanks for trying.",
        "Holden: Not that it did much good.",
        "Meg: Well, I just pray that something will get through to him.",
        "Holden: Well, you know what Mama always says. God hears our prayers. But sometimes he has a funny way of answering them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I thought we were going to stay out of each other's personal live , remember?",
        "Carly: Then why are you having coffee with me?",
        "Jack: To straighten this out. This insanity where you're constantly giving me pointers on how to be the man of Janet's dreams -- it's got to stop.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry. It's just painfully obvious to me that you were in dire need of some feminine advice.",
        "Jack: Not -- not every woman needs the big hearts and flowers things, okay? Janet's not like that.",
        "Carly: Jack, just because she'll settle for less, doesn't mean she wouldn't appreciate more. And don't underestimate yourself. You do know what woman want. I know that from personal experience. But that's not what this is about, is it? Really, I'm terribly sorry that I spoiled your moment. So, better luck next time, no matter how you choose to pop the question.",
        "Jack: Don't worry about it, okay?",
        "Carly: I won't.",
        "Jack: I got to get to work. See ya around.",
        "Carly: Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: When's the wedding, Mom? Do I get to be a bridesmaid or a maid of honor? Or can I walk you down the aisle --",
        "Janet: I can't talk about this right now --",
        "Liberty: No, come on, it's never too early to start planning. What is your color scheme? Are you going to wear white, off-white -- you can't really wear white because there's been a lot of guys --",
        "Janet: Liberty!",
        "Liberty: No offense or anything. But please, just promise me right now that you'll not make me wear a barfy bridesmaid dress that --",
        "Janet: All right, all right, you're getting ahead of yourself here.",
        "Liberty: You're right. I'm acting crazy. We have to do the flowers and then we'll figure out the dress --",
        "Janet: Will you slow down?",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Janet: Because there is no color scheme. Because there is no wedding.",
        "Liberty: Mom, are you guys eloping -- come on --",
        "Janet: Honey, hey, you're not listening to me. Yes, Jack proposed. But I didn't say yes.",
        "Liberty: Are you out of your mind? Why -- why would you not say yes?",
        "Janet: Because Carly showed up, right when he was making his pitch. As far as I'm concerned, that's a really, really bad sign.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Holden: Lily told me that you gave her a lift home after that flat tire.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, I happened to be there. I wasn't going to leave her stranded on the side of the road.",
        "Holden: I know she appreciated it.",
        "Carly: Did she say that?",
        "Holden: Well, she said that you guys had a chance to talk a little bit when you went into the house.",
        "Carly: We did.",
        "Holden: I'm glad.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not like we're going to be hosting any book clubs any time soon, but it's nice to be back on speaking terms.",
        "Holden: I'm sure it is.",
        "Carly: I've really missed the old days.",
        "Holden: Well, who knows? Maybe we can all get back to what we had before all the craziness.",
        "Carly: I don't think so.",
        "Holden: Well, you never know. The more Lily and I get settled, the more things get back to normal --",
        "Carly: Well, for you and Lily, maybe.",
        "Holden: You know, I'm sure it might seem like kind of a stretch right now, but maybe things can work out for you and Jack.",
        "Carly: No, no, that's not going to happen. Um, Jack proposed to Janet. So I suppose I'm the odd woman out.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Holden: Well, Jack -- Jack and Janet heading to the altar? I didn't think he was ready for that.",
        "Carly: I suppose he changed his mind.",
        "Holden: How do you feel about that?",
        "Carly: You know, honestly, I'm not even sure how I feel exactly. I'm -- I'm still pretty shell-shocked.",
        "Holden: Well, you look pretty calm.",
        "Carly: It's all an act.",
        "Holden: Well, if you need any help --",
        "Carly: No -- thank you. It does feel good to talk about it though.",
        "Holden: Well, that's one thing that we can always do. We can talk about anything, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, that was a good thing.",
        "Holden: So when is this wedding?",
        "Carly: You know, I don't know. Janet never actually said yes. I sort of interrupted them and rained on their parade. But Jack will ask again and Janet will say I do, I do, I do.",
        "Holden: Are you sure about that?",
        "Carly: I'm positive. All you have to do is look at her. You can tell how nuts she is about him.",
        "Holden: Funny. I'm thinking the same thing looking at you. You never completely got him out of your system. And I don't think you ever will.",
        "Carly: The problem is, Jack doesn't feel the same way.",
        "Holden: Come on, Carly. You and I both know, if you put your mind to it, you can change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where have you been?",
        "Emily: I got your voice mail like two minutes after you left. It sounded like Armageddon.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it might be, if Dusty gets his way.",
        "Emily: Is there paranoia in the water in this place? Really, how does Meg stand it?",
        "Paul: She doesn't stand it. Not anymore. She moved back to the Snyder farm. All because of Dusty.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. No, no, Dusty is not responsible for all the bad things that happen in your life --",
        "Paul: He's after Meg, okay -- and she's going to fall right into his lap unless you tell me what it is that he's planning to do next so that I can --",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, no, we are not playing that game again. Trust me. Dusty is not up to anything. In fact, he just left for the airport as we speak.",
        "Paul: Really? Where is he going?",
        "Emily: New York on a business trip for Worldwide.",
        "Paul: Without you?",
        "Emily: Without me.",
        "Paul: Did he dump you?",
        "Emily: Yes, he dumped me for another woman. Not Meg.",
        "Paul: Who?",
        "Emily: Jennifer.",
        "Paul: That's not funny. You know, my sister's dead.",
        "Emily: Not to Dusty, she's not. He says he'll never get over her.",
        "Paul: Oh, he'll get over her as soon as he gets Meg to give him a second look.",
        "Emily: Okay, you need to stop this. You need to get --",
        "Paul: He's already getting to her. I went by the Snyder farm to talk to Meg today. She wouldn't even talk to me --",
        "Emily: Oh my God! You think Meg wouldn't see you because Dusty told her not to? --",
        "Emily: Oh --",
        "Paul: Why else would she say that I need help?",
        "Emily: I don't know -- I don't know. Maybe because you are crazy and you do need help!",
        "Paul: I'm not going to let them lock me up again --",
        "Emily: Do you hear yourself? You sound like you're begging for a --",
        "Paul: That way, Dusty wins --",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? I am sorry. That's for your own good.",
        "Paul: Wow.",
        "Emily: Stop -- breathe, okay? The way you're acting right now, you're scaring me. You got to stop making up these stories in your head. You're starting to sound like your father for --",
        "Paul: Don't you ever, ever say that to me again!",
        "Emily: Then stop acting like a freakin' psychopath! The old Paul I know, he would be smart enough to know when his game plan wasn't working and he would come up with a new one.",
        "Paul: Okay. What do I do?",
        "Emily: It's simple. Just do exactly what Meg wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Dusty: No, it's the lone ranger.",
        "Meg: Hey, I wasn't expecting company. Come on in.",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: Well, I was on my way to the airport. I just wanted to stop by and see if you were okay.",
        "Meg: Well, that was very thoughtful. Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: New York. Unless you need me to stick around.",
        "Meg: No. No, no, I'm fine. Holden has been checking up on me. Do you want some coffee? I made some fresh. Decaf.",
        "Dusty: That's perfect.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Dusty: So, things a little calmer here at your mom's house?",
        "Meg: Yeah, a little. Paul has been trying to see me. He came by earlier and Holden chased him off.",
        "Dusty: You're doing the right thing.",
        "Meg: Yeah, Holden said the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Is everything all right? You looked like you're a million miles away.",
        "Jack: I've got a question for you. If you were head over heels in love with a guy, would it matter how he proposed?",
        "Margo: Well, I happen to be an expert in that department. But first things first, why are you asking?",
        "Jack: I asked Janet to marry me. And it was kind of in the middle of the street. There wasn't flowers or violins involved.",
        "Margo: And what did Janet say?",
        "Jack: She didn't say yes, but I have a feeling she was going to.",
        "Margo: What stopped her?",
        "Jack: Carly showed up.",
        "Margo: That'll do it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it kind of put a damper on the whole deal.",
        "Margo: I can imagine. Can we back up ten big paces here?",
        "Jack: Why? What do you mean?",
        "Margo: Well, Carly aside, because we'll get back to that. Can we just deal with Janet?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Margo: When you asked her to marry you, were you absolutely, positively sure that's what you wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Everything happens for a reason. Katie fell in love with Jack and married him. But that marriage didn't work out. Why? Because Carly is like some super magnet. She shows up and Jack gets pulled right back to her. And then the next thing you know, Carly and Jack, boom! Back together again. Katie and Jack's marriage, over. He broke Katie's heart. I don't want that to happen to me.",
        "Liberty: Mom, it does not have to, okay? You're the one that is always telling me not to be negative. So just please take your own advice here.",
        "Janet: Hey, listen. What about your advice? You're the one who is always telling me that I need to be more careful with men.",

        "Janet: That's crazy!",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it's totally crazy because ever since I was old enough to listen, you said, you're like, waiting for the guy to come that loves you and wants to marry you and spend the rest of his life with you. And now it's happening. It's happening to you and -- and you're finding some way to not go through with it. Okay, so, stop sabotaging yourself, Mom.",
