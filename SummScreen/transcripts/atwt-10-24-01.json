You'd know what to do if it was I. You'd say all\r\nthe right things. Why were you riding so fast without your seat belt, Bryant?\r\nNo. Was it my fault? Was it something I said or didn't say? I mean, I know you\r\nwere upset about something, but -- but I asked you, and you didn't answer me.\r\nWhat, was it the money? No, it wasn't the money, because you were upset when I\r\ngot there. I should have made you tell me. I should have made you tell me.\u00a0\r\n[Craig cries] Would you have told me? Did you trust me? I remember the first\r\ntime I held you.

I haven't been much of a mother to you lately.\r\nI haven't had anything to give you. I'm not sure I have much now, but when I\r\nheard about Bryant, I knew you'd be in pain, and I thought maybe you needed me.\r\nIf it's of no hope, it's all I can give you right now, and I don't want your\r\nfeelings about me or about Bryant to make you so unhappy that you stop living,\r\nJen.

Something happened, didn't it, darling?\r\nSomething happened on the road, didn't it? Well, I'm going to find out what\r\nhappened. I can do that for you. I always talk too much and I\u2019m sorry.

        " Jennifer: Bry? I don't know if you can hear me, but -- [Jennifer sighs] I'm so sorry this happened to you. When I said I wanted to\r\nbreak up, the last thing I ever wanted was for you to get hurt. I always thought\r\nthat we'd know each other the rest of our lives. My parents say that this isn't\r\nmy fault. And I guess that they're right. But, I don't know, everything just\r\nfeels so wrong now. Remember when you always used to say, we shouldn't turn into\r\nour parents? We should be happy and live our own lives? Well, I think that's\r\nwhat you would have wanted for me, because you loved me so much. And I loved\r\nyou! And so did Billy! You got to believe that! So I\u2019m gonna try to be strong\r\nand live my own life like you would have wanted me to. Only, I need to know that\r\nyou're okay with this. So if you could, I don't know, send me some kind of a\r\nsign -- please. So I know that you've forgiven me.",
