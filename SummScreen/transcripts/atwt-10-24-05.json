        "Katie is freaked out by BJ's cheerleading outfit gift. It is an exact replica of her one from high school. Is he a stalker or is he just really oddly generous? He explains that he was just trying to make her laugh. Katie finally is convinced of the harmlessness of the gift, or so she thinks? She later shows up at Java wearing the outfit under her coat. Meg continues to be tortured as to whether she should tell Dusty and Jen the truth about her baby. She agrees to personally do the blood work on Rory. Paul and Emily continue to work on Meg using her desire for Dusty. Jen is anxiously awaiting the results from Dusty and Meg visiting her baby for blood, and Paul has pangs of guilt and thinks the truth is about to come out, and so he prepares to tell her. Carly loses custody of Rory and Gwen gains custody on one condition \u0096 she move back in with Iris. Gwen comes home with her baby, and Dusty and Meg show up for supposed routine blood work, but Iris won't let them see the baby without the right papers, which obviously they don't have.

        "B.J.: Wait until you see this. It's the perfect costume for the Halloween party.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's see it.",
        "B.J.: You like it?",
        "Katie: You're cross dressing. That's a way to go.",
        "B.J.: No, it's for you. It's vintage. Try it on.",
        "Katie: I don't have to, it's my size.",
        "B.J.: I guessed right?",
        "Katie: My size, my colors, our uniforms. This could actually be my uniform.",
        "B.J.: You're kidding? That's incredible. How lucky is that?",
        "Katie: I want you to leave, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry. That probably freaked you out. But I'm just so grateful.",
        "Meg: No, it's okay.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, Meg. It's not just okay, it's huge. I know the kind of risk that you're taking here. Believe me. I never would have dreamed of asking you this. It's just -- this blood sample is the only way that I will get my son back.",
        "Meg: Jen, you deserve to know. And I'll make sure you find out the truth.",
        "Dusty: You're the best. I knew I could count on you.",
        "Meg: You can. But first, I have to finish my shift. Excuse me.",
        "Jennifer: You're the best, too.",
        "Dusty: It's not over yet.",
        "Jennifer: But it will be. As soon as that court hearing is over. I can't believe it. I'm really going to get my son back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I don't understand, you just said you weren't going to give my son to Carly.",
        "Judge: That's right. Now --",
        "Gwen: Where else is he going to go? I mean, I'm his mother.",
        "Judge: Who kidnapped him from the custodial parents.",
        "Gwen: But you said that you understood why I did that.",
        "Cass: Down, Gwen.",
        "Judge: I got it! That doesn't make it okay, Ms. Norbeck.",
        "Gwen: Look, I was just looking out for my son.",
        "Judge: Counselor?",
        "Cass: Yes, your honor. Not another word.",
        "Judge: Now, while I understand the impulse to get the baby in question out of danger, Ms. Norbeck's actions showed poor impulse control and a lack of judgment as to real danger. In short, everything you would expect to see in an adolescent. But not in a responsible mother. Between the two of you and your reckless, not to mention criminal, behavior you leave me with only one option. I am remanding the infant in question to children's services until such time as a suitable home can be found --",
        "Gwen: No, you can't!",
        "Cass: He can. That's enough. Your honor, if I may be heard before you rule.",
        "Judge: If only because it would be a refreshing change to hear from someone who's actually supposed to speak up in these proceedings. Go.",
        "Cass: I understand the dilemma you face, but we all know that children's services and a foster home are last-resort alternatives. This baby needs a stable, dependable home where we can be sure he'll be loved and cared for. And I have the perfect solution.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I want to get down to the courthouse and wait.",
        "Dusty: Jen, hold on.",
        "Jennifer: We can get a blood sample as soon as the court hearing's done.",
        "Dusty: You can't just march up to whoever's got the baby and say \"give us a blood sample.\"",
        "Emily: You know what? Why don't I go? The two of you can hang out and wait for Meg, and I'll drop back here as soon as I get the answer.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to come back here. Just call us.",
        "Emily: No, really I don't mind, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Its better Meg doesn't have people hanging around her at work. You know, I don't want her to get in trouble. You understand?",
        "Emily: Fine. I'll call.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks, Em.",
        "Emily: Sure.",
        "Jennifer: What was that?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. She was -- she was on Meg when I got here. I don't know.",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Dusty: Who knows, and who cares? I don't want anybody in Meg's face. She's got too much on her mind right now.",
        "Paul: I thought you had to finish your shift.",
        "Meg: I do.",
        "Paul: No, it's okay. You can take a minute, you know, really think about what it is that you're going to do.",
        "Meg: I told you, I'm running the blood test.",
        "Paul: How's it going to turn out?",
        "Meg: Be ready, Paul.",
        "Paul: Oh, I am ready. Are you? You want Dusty. And in his heart, you are what Dusty wants. Anybody that's ever seen you two together can tell that right away. And here you are, about to risk your job, about to risk everything -- everything for him to give him something that he wants. You'll be his angel of mercy. You'll have him in the palm of your hand. You don't want to blow an opportunity like that.",
        "Meg: Let me by, Paul.",
        "Paul: Sure.",
        "Emily: What happened? What's she going to do?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Emily: I'm going to the courthouse. I promised to let them know what happens to the baby. I'm going to call you first, though, to get a head start.",
        "Paul: \"Be ready.\" That's what she said when I asked her what she was going to do. Meg said, \"Be ready.\"",
        "Emily: Listen to me. I've known Meg Snyder a long time, and she always puts herself first. Which means she's gonna -- she's gonna keep our secret. Listen, let's just pray Jack and Carly get the baby. It's our best chance of heading off this whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: Your honor, you're right that my client acted impulsively in a desire to protect her baby. Right instinct, wrong action. And she deeply regrets the trouble she caused by running away.",
        "Judge: Her regret doesn't pay the police overtime spent looking for them.",
        "Cass: No, sir, it doesn't. The only possible payment would be to have better judgment, to have more help in her genuine desire to be a better mother. The kind of guidance an older, more experienced mentor could provide.",
        "Carly: Where is he going with this?",
        "Jessica: We're about to find out.",
        "Cass: Someone who's been in Ms. Norbeck's very position, someone who can understand and help Ms. Norbeck make good choices for her child. Someone who has a vested interest in the well being of both Ms. Norbeck and the child --",
        "Judge: They call them briefs for a reason, counselor. Wrap it up.",
        "Cass: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I have cited relevant precedents on page two of the moving papers. It is well established that a minor birth mother may be granted provisional custody so long as she remains under the supervision of a custodial parent. I propose that Ms. Norbeck be granted custody of her baby so long as she remains in the custody of her mother, the baby's grandmother, Ms. Iris Dumbrowski.",
        "Carly: What? Are you crazy?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: I thought you'd be happy I found this.",
        "Katie: You found it? You would have to comb through every second-hand store in the entire Midwest.",
        "B.J.: No. No, no, no. I have an assistant in Chicago, and I told her about the party. And as soon as I did, she started looking around.",
        "Katie: Oh, please, that makes it even worse.",
        "B.J.: Why? I don't get it. I mean, it's a theme party, right? You told me you'd been a cheerleader, and then my assistant comes across this costume and",
        "Katie: Well, there is no way in the world that this is a coincidence. That is my old high school uniform, and you know it!",
        "B.J.: How would I know that?",
        "Katie: Why are you making this so difficult, B.J.? I'm sorry, I am trying to be polite, but you are really creeping me out. And the way you keep denying it --",
        "B.J.: Okay, okay, okay. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry, okay? You got me.",
        "Katie: B.J., what is going on here? Just give it to me straight.",
        "B.J.: Well, look, it's really not that big a deal. But now I've made it one. But, look, it's just you told me you'd been a cheerleader, and I thought, \"it's great, I can surprise her for the Halloween party, and I had my assistant do some research, and we found out what school you went to, and then we came across this costume in a secondhand shop, and I just, you know, thought you'd get a kick out of it.",
        "Katie: So why not tell me that from the beginning?",
        "B.J.: Because Mike told me that you were uncomfortable with the all gifts and stuff, all the attention, so I thought if it look better if it just looked like it was a coincidence, like I hadn't gone to any trouble --",
        "Katie: When you really had.",
        "B.J.: No, no. No, no, no. See, that's just the thing. It really wasn't any trouble at all. It took all of about a half hour for us to do all the research and then find the costume and -- it's no big a deal.",
        "Katie: Okay. It's not about the time you took, it's that you thought of it in the first place. Why?",
        "B.J.: Because I'm a stalker who harbors a deep obsession with you. Right?",
        "Katie: No, I didn't say that.",
        "B.J.: But that's what you're thinking.",
        "Katie: No. Not exactly.",
        "B.J.: But -- kind of, right? And you know what? You're right. I'm sorry. But it's not the way you think.",
        "Katie: Okay. Tell me how it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Is the grandmother present?",
        "Cass: She is, your honor. As you'll see in our moving papers, Ms. Dumbrowski resides here in Oakdale, is retired from her job at Memorial Hospital, and therefore will devote all of her time to the welfare of her daughter, and her grandson.",
        "Judge: Okay. Let's hear from Iris Dumbrowski. Ms. Dumbrowski? Does she speak?",
        "Iris: Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't point to me. I didn't wanna break any rules.",
        "Judge: Well, that's something I don't hear everyday. Since you are such a responsible citizen, why don't you explain to me why a court found you so unfit as a mother so as to grant your daughter emancipated minor status?",
        "Iris: Your honor, with respect to the court, it wasn't like that. See, Gwennie and I both agreed that she could live on her own. We both signed the petition. She was always very independent. Even as a little girl, it was, \"oh, let me, Mommy. I can do it.\" So, if I could let her, you know, if it were safe, then I would. Because, you know, it was good. You know, she would grow up to be strong. So when she asked me if she could live on her own, I agreed with her. But your honor, believe me, I kept checking up on her, make sure that she was okay, but not that she would know, because I didn't want her to think that I didn't trust her. Because I did. When I heard that Gwennie was pregnant, you know, I know that most mothers would be upset you know, teen mom, what a shame, all that stuff. But I was happy. See, I was a young mom, too, so I knew, yeah, it's a lotta work, and it's hard. But look at what a prize my precious little baby turned out to be. And I knew that it would be a good thing for Gwen, too. So I started fixing up the guest room, turn it in to a nursery, because I kept hoping that she would come home. I mean, it's one thing to be independent, but I think that you really need your family sometimes.",
        "Judge: Ms. Norbeck, is this true?",
        "Gwen: Your honor?",
        "Judge: Please stand. Your mother says you both agreed to the emancipated minor status.",
        "Gwen: That's true. It was settled before we even went to court.",
        "Judge: And how about the rest of it? Going back -- how do you feel about living with your mom?",
        "Gwen: You honor, there is nothing that I would love more than to walk out of here with my baby, and go home. I can be a good parent.",
        "Judge: Thank you. Have a seat. Yes, counselor?",
        "Jessica: Your honor, there is evidence as to Ms. Dumbrowski's history as an unfit parent in those court records. And there's the matter that my client referred to earlier --",
        "Judge: Are you talking about the blackmail she was yelling about?",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Judge: We have been through this. Without charges, with no evidence, I don't see a crime. So don't bring that in here again.",
        "Jessica: Well, there's more to it, your honor. The real crime was 18 years ago when Ms. Dumbrowski -",
        "Judge: Was there a murder?",
        "Jessica: No, your honor.",
        "Judge: Then the statute of limitations has run out. Counselor, file a motion. It's time we settle this thing now. I hereby grant provisional custody of the infant known as Rory Cabot to his biological mother, Gwen Norbeck, under the condition that her own emancipation be suspended and that she return to the custody of her mother, Iris Dumbrowski. This arrangement will last no more than three months. Children's services will make periodic evaluations, and then in 90 days we will reconvene, we will reevaluate and make whatever adjustments are in the best interest of the child. Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, I order you to turn the child over to Ms. Norbeck effective immediately. Is the child here with you today?",
        "Carly: He's at home. He's in his room.",
        "Judge: I will direct an officer of the court to accompany you and oversee the transfer. We are adjourned.",
        "[Carly sobbing]",
        "Carly: We can't do it, Jack. We cannot hand Rory over to that woman.",
        "Iris: Well, ya gotta have to hand him over to somebody. Because sooner or later, he's going home with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Gwen got the baby.",
        "Paul: Damn. So they can get the blood.",
        "Emily: I'm afraid so. I cannot believe I actually sat in a courtroom and prayed that a baby would go to foster care in another state, but God help me, I did.",
        "Paul: It wouldn't have changed anything. Dusty would've found him.",
        "Emily: Gwen and the baby have been ordered to move in with her mother. The woman's name is Iris Dumbrowski, if you can believe it. I looked up the address. Do you want it?",
        "Paul: Not really.",
        "Emily: Well, we could give Jen and Dusty the wrong address. I don't know, blame it on me?",
        "Paul: Come on, what'd that get us? Like, a day? Half a day? Dusty will figure it out. He'll find the kid.",
        "Emily: Anyway, its 425 Sunshine Way. Paul, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for how this is all turning out, but you know, whatever happens, I'm with you.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I better go give Jen the news.",
        "Barbara: What kind of mess have you gotten my son into?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I better go give Jen the news.",
        "Barbara: What kind of mess have you gotten my son into?",
        "Jennifer: So it's Gwen and her mother? Well, then come on, we have to get Meg and get over there right away.",
        "Dusty: Hold on, we've got to get our story straight.",
        "Paul: Hold on a second here. Have you even thought about Gwen in all of this?",
        "Jennifer: What about Gwen?",
        "Paul: Well, she just got custody of her child for the first time.",
        "Jennifer: No, she thinks it's her child.",
        "Paul: Right. But if it turns out that it's your baby, then that means she has to begin to face the reality of what happened to hers.",
        "Jennifer: That's right.",
        "Paul: And she's been fighting for months, and you want to tell her now, the first day that she brings the kid home that really her baby is dead?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. That's exactly what we're gonna do. You want her to bond with this baby? That'll make things tougher, don't you think?",
        "Jennifer: That's true, that's true. We have get this blood test done as soon as possible. Really. Meg, great. We're a go, if you are.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I'm ready. Do you know where the baby is?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Gwen Norbeck's mother's house. And she doesn't know who we are, so it should be easy. You got the address?",
        "Paul: Yeah, let's go.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm going with you.",
        "Meg: The hell you are.",
        "Jennifer: Meg, what's wrong? Paul is just trying to help.",
        "Meg: No, your brother can't be anywhere near the test if you want it to come out right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns --",
        "Paul: Meg would do anything for Dusty.",
        "Jennifer: You think that, too?",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm counting on it.",
        "Dusty: You're a good friend.",
        "Meg: I'm not. Okay, you're wrong. I'm not that person at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Honey, are you thrilled? We get the baby.",
        "Gwen: I get my baby.",
        "Iris: Oh, and by the way, \"thanks, Mom, for making it happen.\"",
        "Gwen: You're not going to get one dime of that trust fund.",
        "Iris: Do you want the kid to go to foster care?",
        "Gwen: Is that a threat? Hand over the money or I get kicked out?",
        "Iris: No, I'm just saying. You know, I did this because I wanted you to have what you want. That's all.",
        "Gwen: Can you believe that?",
        "Will: Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I mean, didn't you just want to, like, puke when she said that speech?",
        "Will: Gwen, your baby's coming home today -- with you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, Billy's coming home with me. I get to take him home -- to Iris' house. I don't want to have to live with her again.",
        "Will: Maybe you don't have to.",
        "Carly: Of course it matters, Jess. You said in family court that it's all relevant.",
        "Jessica: I'll put it in the motion, Carly, but you heard what the judge said. It's too long ago. I think I'll do better with Iris's current lifestyle, I'm sure. Did you smell the liquor under the breath freshener? Let me see what I can dig up.",
        "Jack: Thanks, Jess.",
        "Bailiff: Detective, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Jack: Oh, thanks, Mac.",
        "Carly: He's coming with us?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: So it's real. We have to give up the baby.",
        "Jack: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I haven't gotten Paul into anything. We're fine.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I could tell that from your half of the conversation. What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: I'm here for Will.",
        "Barbara: Shopping for an even younger Ryan?",
        "Emily: That is disgusting.",
        "Barbara: And so very you.",
        "Emily: Look, I know how much Will cares about Gwen and the baby. We just wanted to make sure he wasn't in any trouble, we wanted to make sure, you know, if he needs something --",
        "Barbara: Did we? It's all unraveling, isn't it, Emily?",
        "Emily: I don't have time for you, okay?",
        "Barbara: No, I'm sure you don't. Because when Paul says jump, you say how high just so you can hold onto him.",
        "Emily: See, I already have Paul.",
        "Barbara: Until you don't, until he realizes that he doesn't really need you. And then where will you go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What's the matter, honey?",
        "Meg: I want this over with, Dusty. No offense, Jen, but your brother can be a hot head. He can sink us all.",
        "Dusty: Well, you got a point there. We got one shot, or we pay the price.",
        "Jennifer: Meg, you are the one taking the risk here, so however you want to do this, that's how we'll do it.",
        "Meg: Well, let me go see this woman.",
        "Jennifer: Alone?",
        "Paul: No, why don't you take Dusty with you?",
        "Dusty: I'll get us in, you take the blood, and we're good.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but thank you again, so much. I will never forget what you're doing for me.",
        "Paul: Jen, why don't we let Meg go do her thing, huh?",
        "Meg: We won't be long.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, you be careful.",
        "Dusty: We're getting there.",
        "Jennifer: I know. I know you wanted Dusty out of my life, but look at all he's done. Nobody else could convinced Meg to take a risk like this.",
        "Paul: Meg would do anything for Dusty.",
        "Jennifer: You think that, too?",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm counting on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: Well, I guess my main problem is that I have lot to live down. All those years of wearing a pocket protector.",
        "Katie: You didn't.",
        "B.J.: Oh, yeah. I mean, well, I had one. We all did. You know, the tech heads, the geeks. Don't you remember?",
        "Katie: Why would I?",
        "B.J.: I just -- well, maybe they didn't have them in your school. But in my crowd, it was a point of pride. You know the retro nerds, the geekier the better. We were all going to be bill gates and rule the world, and to hell with everyone else. We held our heads high.",
        "Katie: So that's good, isn't it? I mean, you were proud nerds, that's cool.",
        "B.J.: Ah, no. That's what we told ourselves. But that's not how it felt. I mean, don't get me wrong, we were riding the wave. I had no idea how rich I'd actually get, but -- that didn't come out right.",
        "Katie: No, I'm sure it's accurate.",
        "B.J.: I just mean, everything went a lot better than we ever could have expected. But you know what? Now, I want more. I want to branch out. I want to be a part of a world that I never even knew existed before, I never could be a part of before. I guess mostly, what I want is to be able to rub elbows with all of the people that wouldn't have even given me the time of day before.",
        "Katie: Don't you get it? Everybody in the world wants to be you.",
        "B.J.: You think?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "B.J.: Well, that's a lot different than wanting to be with me.",
        "Katie: That's just in your head.",
