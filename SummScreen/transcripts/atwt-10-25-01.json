You ought to -- you ought to get some rest. I'm very glad that you were \r\nhere, somebody that I could trust. Well, I gotta get going.",

We've lost a piece of our heart. And there's no room for vanity.\" \r\nVanity, see, that's -- that's what was keeping your ma away from everybody. But \r\nshe got past that. Obviously. So maybe it's my turn.",

You see, I've been thinking -- lot of thinking -- what I've \r\nbeen going through since we lost Bryant, you know, dealing with Lucinda, and \r\nreading your ma the riot act. And yeah, it was for your ma, Bryant, Jennifer. \r\nAnd I was thinking, you know, the big chunk of the reason why I did it was for \r\n-- for us.",
