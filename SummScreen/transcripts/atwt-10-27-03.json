        "\r\nLucy: I can't -- I'm sorry. Aaron, just take the jacket. ",
        "\r\nAaron: Lucy, I don't care about the jacket. I care about you. I love you. Lucy \r\n-- Lucy, you have to forgive me. Say you'll forgive me. ",

        "\r\nChris: I wish I could. ",
        "\r\nAlison: And -- and I've never been treated the way that the people here are \r\ntreating me. And everyone is just so polite, and -- can you believe that they're \r\ncalling me Ms. Stewart? I guess that people are starting to see me as older than \r\nI am. And that's probably because of you. ",
        "\r\nChris: Because of me? ",
        "\r\nAlison: I feel like a woman now, and it shows. And so I should thank you, \r\nshouldn't I? ",
        "\r\nChris: No. No, you shouldn\u2019t. You should let me say what I came to say. ",

        "\r\nChris: Alison, please don't change anything. You can't look any better than you \r\ndo now. You're beautiful. ",

        "\r\nPaul: No. The only murder I plot on a regular basis is yours. ",
        "\r\nJames: You know something, Paul? The only thing I really regret about being \r\nincarcerated here is that I don't get to giggle at those folks in Oakdale if \r\nthey buy your innocent act. Don't waste it on me. You and I don't really need to \r\nplay mind games with each other. ",
        "\r\nPaul: You're deluded. ",
        "\r\nJames: And you are a shark, just like your old man. You play your cards close to \r\nthe vest. Good, good. They'll never guess. But one day, Paul, you're gonna want \r\nto give yourself a little treat, a gift. ",
        "\r\nPaul: And what would that be, father? ",
        "\r\nJames: You're gonna want to watch the fireworks as you unleash your vengeance. \r\nEverybody likes a good show. Don't deny it, Paul. I can see the wheels of \r\nretribution turning now. The plotting has begun. ",
        "\r\nPaul: You want to see a good show? I'll show you a good show. One month from \r\ntoday. Stay tuned. ",
        "\r\nJames: Oh, good, good, good. Now we've got something to look forward to. A show. \r\nBut listen, don't leave your old man out, right? You know, I want details. I \r\nwant time, place, victims. ",
        "\r\nPaul: No, you're just gonna have to wait, just like everybody else. But trust me \r\n-- you'll be amused. ",
        "\r\nJames: No, Paul, wait. Wait, listen. Don't let these bars fool you. I could be \r\nyour help, even from in here. Just tell me what you're going to do. ",

        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, I'm fine. ",
        "\r\nRose: Well, good. 'Cause I've been thinking about you. ",

        "\r\nRose: I can't help it. And you want to know the real reason why I'm not home? I \r\ncouldn't sleep. Kept thinking about you yelling at the walls at people that \r\nweren't there. It scared me. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yeah, I know I frightened you. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. ",
        "\r\nRose: It's just -- I just want you to be able to talk to me, and it just didn't \r\nseem like you wanted to. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Well, I felt a little silly, because, you know, you caught me yelling at \r\nthe furniture. But I don't mean -- I didn't mean to dismiss your concern. ",
        "\r\nRose: Where are you? ",
        "\r\nPaul: I took a drive. Needed to clear my head. ",

        "\r\nRose: Yeah? Are you sure? 'Cause you -- I just thought maybe you need some rest.\r\n",

        "\r\nLucy: I gave you a chance, Aaron. I gave you a chance to prove to me that I \r\nactually mean something to you, but instead you blew me off to help Dusty with \r\nhis illegal gambling. ",
        "\r\nAaron: Luce, I didn't blow you off. Look, Dusty made it sound like I could get \r\neverything finished that he needed me to do and I could still make it to the \r\ndance. And it was working out well, and then it just got crazy. But even then, \r\nLucy, even then I still -- I still thought I was gonna make it there. ",
        "\r\nLucy: It's not only that you didn't come back, Aaron. You got arrested. ",
        "\r\nAaron: Lucy -- Lucy, making that delivery, okay, and talking to those bookies \r\nwas messed up, but I told you why I did it. Luce, I wanted to do more for you.\r\n",
        "\r\nLucy: Why? When did I become a girl who cared about a fancy job and gifts? I \r\ndon't care about that kind of stuff. ",
        "\r\nAaron: You're gonna be going off to college real soon. All right, you're gonna \r\nbe with a bunch of guys that are gonna be CEOs and big hot shots. How do you \r\nthink I feel knowing that you're gonna be wrapped up in that lifestyle? And \r\ngoing home to some kind of grease monkey that fixes cars? I wanted to be more \r\nfor you. ",
        "\r\nLucy: I never asked you to be more. I just wanted you to be who you were. That's \r\nthe guy I fell in love with. ",

        "\r\nChris: I mean that I've been to college and med school, and now I'm working as a \r\ndoctor, and you're barely 18. Okay, me dating you is like you going out with \r\nsome kid from middle school. ",
        "\r\nAlison: No, no, it is so not the same. A person in middle school is, like, 12. I \r\nam more than 12, Chris. And besides, it's okay for a girl to date an older guy. \r\nLook at Emily and Hal. ",
        "\r\nChris: Look, I shouldn't have gotten off on the age thing. That's not even the \r\npoint. ",
