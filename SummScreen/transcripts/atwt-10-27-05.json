        "Mike: No, no, no. The fittings and drain have to be perfect. Thanks. Go by the specs. All right, you know what? If you can't do it right, just wait till I get there. Stop, stop, stop. No, no, I'm not talking to you. I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Katie: Still want me to stop?",
        "Mike: Worksite problems.",
        "Katie: I love it when you talk plumbing.",
        "Mike: This job's got aggravation written all over it.",
        "Katie: Mike, I thought you were excited about renovating Fairwinds.",
        "Mike: B.J.'s deadlines aren't very forgiving.",
        "Katie: Honey, it's a Halloween party, not a state dinner.",
        "Mike: Make it perfect -- that's his mantra. I'll give him perfect.",
        "Katie: Whoa, somebody is a little grumpy this morning.",
        "Mike: I'm not grumpy, I'm just busy. I'm surprised he hasn't had me build a dance floor, now that he's getting private lessons.",
        "Katie: Oh. Okay, so that's what this is. I knew it. I knew you were jealous of B.J. Green.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Double espresso. You better drink it while it's hot.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks, but I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: You're fine? Do I get to vote on that? What's this?",
        "Jennifer: What's left of my son.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer --",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, don't be sorry. Please, don't be sorry.",
        "Dusty: Your mother was right. I shouldn't have pushed so hard. We went too far. I thought for sure the blood test would prove that you were his mother.",
        "Jennifer: So did I.",
        "Dusty: I didn't realize what I was setting you up for.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, stop, no. You didn't help me with anything that I wouldn't have done on my own. Ever since the baby was born, you -- you were the one person who was fighting the same battle that I was. But together, it was like -- it was like we willed him to be alive, and that doesn't really work, does it?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jennifer: So your tour of duty's over.",
        "Dusty: My what?",
        "Jennifer: The late-night vigils, the takeouts, phone calls, always keeping an eye on me. Just -- you need to get back to your life, and I need to get back to mine.",
        "Dusty: Well, that doesn't mean we've got to do it alone. If you've got something to say, go ahead and say it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I think it's finally over.",
        "Paul: It's not over for Jennifer.",
        "Emily: Jennifer has closure now. She can start to heal. And she's safe from Craig, Paul. I mean, that's what we wanted, right? Your sister's a young girl, and she'll find a way to get through this.",
        "Paul: Craig knows the truth, and he's sitting in prison with nothing better to do than think of a dozen ways to get back what is his.",
        "Emily: Well, we won't let him. And thanks to Meg, the courts won't let him, because we have proof, remember? We have the blood tests. What's Craig have? Nothing.",
        "Paul: You're right. Let's hope we can finally stop worrying about this baby. Or maybe not.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Will: Gwen wasn't feeling so great, so I said I'd take him for a walk. I saw your car outside.",
        "Will: No, it's really okay. It can wait.",
        "Emily: No, please, stay, okay? Sit. I'll see you later.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "Emily: Don't be such a stranger, okay? I miss you, too.",
        "[Baby babbles]",
        "Paul: You know, Will, she really means that.",
        "Will: I don't want to talk about Emily. I need your help, and I don't know who else to ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Doctor said not to lift anything.",
        "Gwen: It's not that heavy.",
        "Iris: No, give it to me. It's funny, the littlest one has the most stuff, huh? So speakin' of squirt, where is he?",
        "Gwen: Will took him for a walk.",
        "Iris: What are you, nuts? You left the baby alone with him?",
        "Gwen: Will is my friend, and I trust him with the baby. Anyways, it's not your decision, so stay out of it.",
        "Iris: You and the baby are here for one reason and one reason only -- me. So don't start getting high and mighty about what you can and cannot do under my roof. The judge picked me. Remember that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I will for three months, and we're out of here.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Iris: Get lost! What, you think it's so easy here, raising a kid? You've got to make sure there's food on the table.",
        "Gwen: How would you know?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Iris: I said to get lost! Oh.",
        "Carly: I don't think so, lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Me, jealous of B.J.? Multimillionaire's got a crush on my girl. He can buy her the world, or at least a small corner of it. Most guys would be threatened by that, but not me.",
        "Katie: Honey, the only corner of the world I want to be in is yours, okay? But as for B.J.'s crush, wasn't there a time when you said that I was imagining it, that all those gifts meant nothing?",
        "Mike: That's before I walked in on that little dance lesson.",
        "Katie: Honey, it was a mission of mercy. The poor guy is rhythmically challenged. But you were right, he's not interested in me.",
        "Mike: Really?",
        "Katie: Really. He's a classic case of arrested development, a big kid.",
        "Mike: Big kids have crushes, too. If it turns out that one of us is right and he has an agenda, I'm walking off this job.",
        "Katie: Well, he's gonna walk away from us if we don't get everything for this party ready.",
        "Mike: Seriously, Katie, nothing is worth losing you again.",
        "Katie: B.J. is harmless.",
        "Mike: He better stay that way. Dancing's fine, but don't get any ideas about teaching him anything else, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: What I think is that if you just -- you need a vacation from me, because you know, I -- I haven't really been a barrel of laughs to be around.",
        "Dusty: If I wanted laughs, I'd go to a comedy club.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful, because I know I wouldn't be standing without you.",
        "Dusty: You'd stand.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe, but I'll never be sure unless I do it on my own. And now it's your turn to just say it.",
        "Dusty: I think you need people around you right now. And remember what the doctor said, with meth, you can have a delayed withdrawal.",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I'm not worried about getting back into the drugs again, Dusty. I -- I would just ruin any chance I had of living again. I mean, I don't want to forget. I don't want to lose the memories in some drug haze. It wouldn't be fair to anybody -- a baby or me.",
        "Dusty: Well, I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you for understanding.",
        "Dusty: That's what friends do, right?",
        "Jennifer: The good ones. I just wish that knowing the truth would change how I feel.",
        "Dusty: You still believe he's alive, don't you?",
        "Jennifer: I can't bear to think otherwise.",
        "Dusty: Well, then you don't have to. I want you to take as much time off as you need, and believe what you believe until you don't anymore. Want me to come by later and take you to dinner?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying. I -- I have to get through this without a crutch.",
        "Dusty: Is that what I've been, a crutch?",
        "Jennifer: No, but it's what you've become.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom's really on my case about Gwen.",
        "Paul: Right. Well, just ignore her.",
        "Will: How? If she ships me back to a psychiatric hospital?",
        "Paul: She's not going to ship you anywhere, Will, but mother is not what you need to worry about. You need to worry about the law. You and Gwen could be facing some very serious charges.",
        "Will: Even if the kidnapping thing is a joke? How do you kidnap your own kid?",
        "Paul: I don't know, ask Gwen. She managed to get arrested.",
        "Will: All right, fine, forget it.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not going to forget it, Will. I'm not very happy with what you've done.",
        "Will: I was wrong, I understand that. But if the judge decides that we need to serve time --",
        "Paul: I don't think it's going to come to that.",
        "Will: Okay, we need to think of the kid, though. All Gwen has is her mom, and she'd go crazy if she had to leave him with her.",
        "Paul: Well, she may not have another choice.",
        "Will: I want to give her one. That's the help I need. You're his godfather, Paul, so if we have to go to jail, will you take care of the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Let me in, Iris.",
        "Iris: Over my dead body.",
        "Carly: You have no idea how much I wish that could be arranged.",
        "Iris: Nice talk comin' from a cop's wife, or is he an ex-cop by now?",
        "Carly: I don't want any trouble with you.",
        "[Iris laughs]",
        "Iris: For once, right?",
        "Gwen: Let her in.",
        "Iris: What are you, nuts?",
        "Gwen: Just do it. I mean it, Mom.",
        "Iris: Okay. We're out of formula. I'll go to the store. Don't be here when I get back.",
        "Carly: Thanks for letting me in.",
        "Gwen: Just don't lecture me on the place not being good enough for the baby. I can't handle it.",
        "Carly: No, no, I'm -- I'm not here to lecture you, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Then just tell me why you're here so we can get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come on!",
        "B.J.: Leave it right over there.",
        "Henry: Gee, thanks.",
        "B.J.: And when you're done, make sure you get the rest of the tombstones.",
        "Henry: Yeah, anyone's in particular? Yours, mine?",
        "Mike: Wow. Look at this place.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, wait till you see my haunted house.",
        "Katie: You didn't tell me you were going to do a haunted house.",
        "B.J.: Oh, yeah, down in the basement. Some of this stuff's going to go there.",
        "Henry: Good. Mike's here just in time for the heavy lifting.",
        "B.J.: Actually, I'd rather he focus on the plumbing. The water's already gone out twice, maybe three times already today.",
        "Mike: I'll take care of it. Everything else is on schedule.",
        "B.J.: All right, I'm counting on it. And maybe you can help me set up downstairs?",
        "Katie: Sure. Uh, where do we start?",
        "Henry: Well, we were on tombstones.",
        "B.J.: Henry's taking care of most of the props.",
        "Henry: Why don't I take my little friend here and meet you downstairs?",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Maddie: Hi -- Henry? Hi, I'm sorry. They said you'd be here.",
        "B.J.: Maddie, come on in.",
        "Henry: Why are you here? Why aren't you at the station impressing Kim Hughes with your brilliance?",
        "B.J.: Come on. Don't interrogate the poor girl the second she walks in the door. Come on, let me have a second to talk to my favorite intern. Katie, do you want to give Henry a hand?",
        "Henry: Literally?",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Henry: Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio!",
        "Maddie: Can I ask you a question? If I'm your favorite intern, why did you fire me?",
        "B.J.: Maddie, I don't mean to punish you, but if there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that actions have consequences.",
        "Maddie: Fine, I learned my lesson.",
        "B.J.: Well, good. I hope so. Because if there is a next time, someone else might have to pay those consequences.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So I'm part of the problem now?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I didn't say that.",
        "Dusty: Sounds like it.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, look, I know that you -- I know that you would give your life to hand me my baby. But he's gone, and nothing can change that. And I say he's gone because if I say he's dead, then I don't think I could catch my next breath.",
        "Dusty: I get it.",
        "Jennifer: No. When you're here, when I see you, I know that you want it to be true, and it's like this real, living thing between us, but it's tied up in false hope.",
        "Dusty: So you want to shut me out of your life?",
        "Jennifer: I'm afraid I have to. Because I've become the one thing in the world that I hate the most, and that's a victim. And I watched my mother in that role for years, and it swallows you --",
        "Dusty: You're not your mother.",
        "Jennifer: But I could turn into her if I don't end this cycle!",
        "Dusty: What am I supposed to do, disappear? Do you want me to disappear?",
        "Jennifer: Get on with your life. Let me get on with mine. Because the only thing that could make this nightmare worse is if I took you down with me.",
        "Dusty: Like it or not, if I see you going down, I'm going after you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby babbles]",
        "Paul: Will, this baby isn't going anywhere. And if the judge was really worried about the criminal courts being hard on you and Gwen, then he wouldn't have given her the baby.",
        "Will: He didn't give her the baby, he gave him to her mother.",
        "Paul: Well, even so -- look, I'm not saying that you and Gwen aren't going to be penalized, but I don't think that prison time is part of the deal. And if it comes to that, if it looks like that's going to happen, then we'll hire a team of lawyers, and we'll take care of it.",
        "Will: I hope you're right.",
        "Paul: Did you eat this morning?",
        "Will: No, not yet.",
        "Paul: I'm going to order something.",
        "Will: I think somebody else is hungry, too. Come here, fella. Here, why don't you hold him for a second. I'm going to go see if they can warm up his bottle.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, look, I'll do the bottle thing.",
        "Will: Oh, come on, he's not going to bite.",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Jennifer: And if you won't help me, then I will find someone who will. Hell, maybe I'll even call Craig.",
        "Paul: That's insane! And look, I realize that that's a very sensitive word to use in a place like this, but the idea of involving Craig? Jennifer, the whole point of all of this was to try and get you and your baby away from Craig! Craig is lethal! Do you have any idea what this man will do to you?",
        "Jennifer: It couldn't be worse than this. I would gladly take anything that Craig would throw at me if it meant that I could have my baby.",
        "Will: I forgot my wallet. Paul, you -- you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You are still angry. Well, if I put myself in your shoes, I can certainly understand why. I was determined to keep that baby, to win at all costs.",
        "Gwen: But you didn't.",
        "Carly: Gwen, I'm not here to fight over him.",
        "Gwen: Well, if you're here to see him, he's out.",
        "Carly: I just wanted to let you know that I won't cooperate with the cops on the kidnapping charge.",
        "Gwen: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because I love that child, and I know now that you love him, too.",
        "Gwen: But if they send me away, you have a chance, so --",
        "Carly: Well, I have my own troubles with the law. And I'm just afraid that he'll be thrown into foster care or that he'll end up here with iris for a very long time. And I just want what's best for -- Billy. I want what's best for Billy.",
        "Gwen: So suddenly I'm what's best for Billy, or just better than Iris?",
        "Carly: I just don't want you to worry about the kidnapping charge, Gwen, that's all.",
        "Gwen: You're a real piece of work, you know that? You come in here, and you play nice, and you expect me to what, smile, let you visit, play Aunt Carly? Forget it. There's got to be something more in it for you. So stop wasting my time and tell me what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Mike: Who's this joker? Friend of yours?",
        "Paul: Jennifer's little boy, he's living across town, and my sister is mourning him, and it's just -- it ends now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'd like to show you something. They -- they took this picture the first time that Rosanna got to hold her brand-new baby boy. They sent it to me a few weeks after.",
        "Gwen: She was a nice lady. I liked her.",
        "Carly: I like her, too.",
        "Gwen: What does that have to do with me?",
        "Carly: Well, I started out this baby's aunt, and it looks like I'm destined to remain his aunt.",
        "Gwen: Well, you can't fight biology.",
        "Carly: You know, I thought you'd be an awful mother.",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Carly: But I was wrong. I can see now how much you love him.",
        "Gwen: Who asked for your approval?",
        "Carly: Gwen, I miss my sister. And by some crazy twist of fate, I have found another. Maybe --",
        "Gwen: Maybe what?",
        "Carly: Maybe we should stop hating each other so much, you know? And then, maybe everything else would follow. That's what's in it for me.",
        "Gwen: You know what? You flash me this picture of Rosanna, and you expect me to get all mushy and forget that you tried to take my kid?",
        "Carly: No, no, that's not what I'm trying to do.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm taking you to court, Carly. I'm going to tell the judge what you did. And when they march you off to jail, look my way. Because I'll be the girl with the smile on her face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You look like you've never held a baby before.",
        "[Baby babbles]",
        "Paul: It's been awhile. It's been since the christening.",
        "Will: Yeah, so?",
        "Paul: I -- here. I'll tell you what, I'll order you some food on the way out, okay?",
        "Will: You're leaving already?",
        "Paul: Don't worry about the whole legal thing, all right? I'm sure that it's not going to be a problem.",
        "Will: What's your -- what's your rush?",
        "Paul: I've got to -- I've got to make a phone call.",
        "Will: Paul, I get it. I look at him, and I think of Jen, too.",
        "Paul: Yeah, this whole thing's been really hard on everybody. I guess I'm just dealing with my own guilt.",
        "Will: You, why?",
        "Paul: I should take care of you, and I should take care of Jennifer. And I've been lying to myself, saying that what I'm doing is protecting Jen. Um, I've got to go, man. I'll call you.",
        "Will: Okay, sure.",
        "Paul: Do you want a muffin or something?",
        "Will: Yeah, and a coffee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: Come here. Come on. I don't mean to make you unhappy, Maddie. Really, I'm just trying to teach you a life lesson, that's all. Something you need to learn.",
        "Maddie: I've learned that you can hurt me and Henry.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, well, I was really hoping that you would see the importance of making smart choices, be careful what you say and do.",
        "Maddie: And not tell Henry you canned me?",
        "B.J.: Well, you can tell him if you want. That's your choice. Your brother, he loves you a lot. He's very protective.",
        "Maddie: So I take it you haven't mentioned it to him?",
        "B.J.: Well, if I did, he would quit, and go back to living in his car. And see, that's what I'm talking about -- actions, consequences, the power of the mind. It's all in your hands, Maddie. It is. One thing leading to another, the good and the bad. I'm sorry. I know you really enjoyed it at the TV station.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, while it lasted.",
        "B.J.: Well, you know what? Now that we understand each other, I see no reason why you can't go back to work. Hello. Kim Hughes, please. Kim, hi, it's B.J. Listen, I may have acted a bit rash when I told you to get rid of Maddie. Yeah. So this is what I'm thinking? Maybe we could bring her back, have her start fresh? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Great! That's great. No, no, no. I'll give her the news myself. Thank you. I like to reward loyalty.",
        "Delivery man: Excuse me, are you B.J. Green?",
        "B.J.: Yes, I am. And who let you in?",
        "Delivery man: A pretty blonde lady.",
        "Katie: Oh, good, you found him.",
        "Delivery man: There she is.",
        "B.J.: Okay.",
        "Delivery man: Thanks.",
        "B.J.: There you go.",
        "Katie: More props?",
        "B.J.: See for yourself.",
        "Katie: Ooh, a disco ball!",
        "Maddie: For a Halloween party?",
        "Katie: We used to have one of these at all our dances.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, uh, you know what? I ordered a black light and a strobe. They obviously got the order mixed up. Uh, I'm gonna have to send it back.",
        "Katie: No, I can do it.",
        "B.J.: No, no, no, no. You've got your hands full in the basement. No problem, I'll take care of it.",
        "Katie: Actually, we're almost done down there. You want to check it out?",
        "B.J.: I will be down soon.",
        "Katie: Okay, um -- oh! And Henry reminded me that we have some wigs from last Halloween. I'm going to run by and get them real quick.",
        "B.J.: Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to run all the way out there.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's fine.",
        "B.J.: Okay, well, at least let me drive you then.",
        "Katie: Okay. Let me make sure with Henry, see if we need anything else, and I'll be right back.",
        "B.J.: Great. Will you take this upstairs to my bedroom?",
        "Maddie: But I thought that you said that you're going to return it?",
        "B.J.: Upstairs. Please?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: If you want, I can go try and catch the delivery guy.",
        "B.J.: Put it upstairs. I'll take care of it later.",
        "Maddie: Why? If he's still here, why make it harder for yourself? You could just --",
        "B.J.: Is everything a negotiation with you?",
        "Maddie: No, I -- I just thought that it was --",
        "B.J.: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's your problem, okay? Do me a favor, don't think, just do.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",

        "B.J.: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Henry: Mike? Has everybody lost their minds?",
        "Katie: Michael, I wouldn't mind a bit of pate.",
        "Henry: No, stop. Mike, stop! All right, that's it. Come on, Katie, we're going!",
        "B.J.: Nowhere!",

        "Jennifer: Dusty, please don't -- don't take it personal.",
        "Dusty: That's funny, because it feels just about as personal as it could be.",
        "Jennifer: Please don't make this any harder.",
        "Dusty: Life's hard, you know? If you're gonna toss me out of your life, be hard about it.",
        "Jennifer: Being with you used to make me feel like everything I wanted -- my baby, the future -- was right there where I could grab it. That's why, when I see you now, it just makes me so sad.",
        "Dusty: So you want me to get lost. For how long?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know.",
        "Dusty: A month, forever? If I can't give you what you want, I guess I'll give you what you need. Bye, Jenny.",

        "Carly: My sister taught me how important family is -- extended family. And I want that for Billy. I want him to have an aunt and an uncle and cousins -- people who love him. People he can turn to when he can't turn to you.",
        "Gwen: No, he'll always be able to turn to me.",
        "Carly: Gwen, sometimes, no matter how much you love your kids, it's not enough. You're young. You think you can do it all on your own. I thought that, too, when I was your age, but I was wrong.",
        "Gwen: Okay, so I'm wrong.",
        "Carly: No, that's not what I'm trying to say. What I said before, it still stands. I won't help the cops with the charges against you. You do whatever you want. I won't change my mind about that.",
        "Will: I think it's time for his nap.",
        "Carly: Oh -- oh, hi!",

        "Paul: I held him. And he's got Jennifer's eyes. And he looked at me, and I felt this connection, you know? And he was looking right through me. I mean, it was like he could see right through all of my lies.",
        "Emily: I'm so sorry.",
        "Paul: I should never have dragged you into this.",
        "Emily: No, no, you didn't drag me into anything.",
        "Paul: Well, it's not like it's gonna end anytime soon. You saw Will, he's wheeling him around town.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, right now, maybe. But he's a kid himself. He's going to college next year.",
        "Paul: No, Will, he seems all caught up in this thing with Gwen and the baby, and he doesn't do things half-hearted. Hell, I know that more than anybody.",
        "Emily: Okay, so we run into them every once in a while. That doesn't make the baby a permanent part of our lives.",
        "Paul: My nephew, Jennifer's little boy, is living across town, and my sister is mourning him. And it's just -- it ends now!",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: I'm calling Jennifer, and if she's home, we're going over there, and we're going to tell her the truth.",

        "Katie: They're right upstairs. I'll be right back down.",
        "B.J.: Uh, Katie, before you go up there, I want to give you something.",
        "Katie: B.J., I told you, these presents, it's too much.",
        "B.J.: This isn't just for you. I thought this would make a great party favor for all the female guests. Open it.",
        "Katie: A charm bracelet? Oh, my God, this looks just like the one I got in high school. I got it for my sweet 16. I wore it every day.",
        "B.J.: I remember. All them girls at my high school had the same thing. So you think it's a winner? It's not too dated?",
        "Katie: No, no. It's timeless, perfect. Definitely a winner.",
        "B.J.: Great. I value your opinion. I'm not so good at this kind of stuff.",
        "Katie: Oh, please. You could have fooled me. I'm just going to get the stuff, and we'll be out.",

        "Gwen: Yeah, I think so. I hope so.",
        "Carly: I won't keep you. Gwen, I know I've got a lot of nerve asking, but would you -- never mind. If you need anything, you know you can call.",
        "Gwen: Don't wait by the phone.",
        "Will: What was that about?",
        "Gwen: I think she wants me to tell him about her.",
        "Will: How do you know?",
        "Gwen: 'Cause if I'd lost him, I'd want the same thing. She keeps saying that we're sisters, we're family. Those are just words. I mean, yeah, we do have one thing in common. We both love the baby. That doesn't make us family.",
        "Will: No, but it's a pretty good start.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How can you defend this?",
        "Emily: Because we did this for the right reasons.",
        "Paul: My reasons.",
        "Emily: You did not make Craig a monster.",
        "Paul: You know, the more I try and avoid being like my father, the more I wind up behaving like him.",
        "Emily: No, no, you did this for Jen.",
        "Paul: No, Jennifer? Jennifer, she's falling apart.",
        "Emily: So she'll pull herself back together. We'll help her.",
        "Paul: This baby has a family, such as it is.",
        "Emily: We are not his family.",
        "Paul: Yes, we are!",
        "Emily: Well, then Craig is his family, too. And if you want to go there, then everything you put on the line was for nothing. You think Jennifer is going to forgive you? I mean, I wouldn't! And Hal, and Will and everyone, they're going to judge you far worse than you're judging yourself. Do you remember what Craig did? I mean, maybe you need to jump on a plane and go see Rosanna for yourself, what's left of her.",
        "Paul: Leave Rosanna out of it.",
        "Emily: I can't! We can't! Paul, we are in way too deep here! I mean maybe, before the blood tests, we could have explained something, but now -- I mean, even if Jennifer understood, the cops won't understand. And Hal, he's been itching for a reason to punish us.",
        "Paul: Punish me.",
        "Emily: Now listen, I feel bad. I feel really bad for Jen, I do, but I'm a mother, too. And I will be damned if I'm going to be locked away from my son! I'm selfish, okay? I'm looking out for me, and I'm looking out for you. Baby, listen to me. You cave, they win. Everybody who says we don't belong together, my mother, your mother, Hal. You make that call, we lose each other. We lose everything. I'm not willing to pay that price. Not for Jennifer, not for anyone.",
