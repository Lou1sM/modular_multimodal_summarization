        "Henry: If you're here to make trouble, we can take it outside --",
        "Spencer: I'm here to have breakfast. What a charming place. May I see a menu?",
        "Henry: You know, there are a lot of greasy spoons around here, why did you choose this one?",
        "Spencer: Henry, is it? I'm guessing since you and Katie are so close, that you're a really nice guy. But somehow we've gotten off on the wrong foot.",
        "Henry: Why do you care?",
        "Spencer: Honestly? I care about my job. I want to be good at it. Katie's been a wonderful mentor to me so far. I'd like to keep it that way.",
        "Henry: I see. I see, so you're from the keep your enemies close school.",
        "Spencer: Oh, I don't consider you an enemy. Although, you have been pretty rotten to me. Was just hoping that we can get to know each other and maybe even be friends.",
        "Henry: I don't make any promises, but I'll think about it.",
        "Spencer: While you're thinking about it, could I have an egg over easy, on whole wheat toast? Oh, and one of those pepparkakor cookies you guys are famous for?",
        "Henry: Sure. Do you want coffee, juice?",
        "Spencer: Both. I'll be right back.",
        "Thug: I told you you'll get it, and you'll get it.",
        "Spencer: What is taking so long? She's been dead nearly a month.",
        "Thug: You'll have it today. Guaranteed.",
        "Henry: Hey, just in time.",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Janet: Did you change your mind?",
        "Jack: Not a chance. No, hey, you -- you agreed to marry me and I'm going to hold you to it.",
        "Janet: All right.",
        "Jack: I just wanted to see how my fianc\u00e9e was doing this morning.",
        "Janet: Oh, nobody's ever called me that before. Say it again, say it again, say it again.",
        "Jack: Oh, well -- fianc\u00e9e, I was driving by my fianc\u00e9e's place of residence and I had the sudden urge to -- you read my mind. And your hives are all gone.",
        "Janet: Yes, thanks to you.",
        "Jack: Look how beautiful you are. So, are you ready to celebrate?",
        "Janet: I am. Can I show off my ring?",
        "Jack: To everybody at the Lakeview. We'll go for lunch and champagne and I'll kiss you in public. And we'll make complete spectacles of ourselves.",
        "Janet: Oh, it's a date.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right, lunch, Lakeview.",
        "Janet: Okay, bye.",
        "Jack: Bye.",
        "Janet: Katie, hey, I have some news.",
        "Katie: Oh, what is it?",
        "Janet: Well, first of all, I wanted to thank you for your advice. You and Brad are such a great example of a loving couple --",
        "Brad: Morning, Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing home?",
        "Meg: Funny thing about hospitals -- if you're not sick, they kick you out.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I was going to pick you up.",
        "Meg: Well, I got my brother to do it. I thought I would save you a trip. You've been spending too much time worrying about me. You have a business to run.",
        "Dusty: You're a priority.",
        "Meg: I'm fine, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Well, what did the doctor say? How's the baby?",
        "Meg: Well, he or she is hanging in there. But you know how they keep telling me to avoid stress? It just seems to be getting harder and harder lately.",
        "Dusty: So stay away from your husband.",
        "Meg: I will. Well, thanks for coming by.",
        "Dusty: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Meg: I'm just a little tired.",
        "Dusty: So, I heard Paul came by the hospital after I left.",
        "Meg: Where did you hear that?",
        "Dusty: You should have called me.",
        "Meg: So I could watch the two of you go at it again? Talk about stress. Look, you know, I really don't think you should be coming by here anymore.",
        "Dusty: Why's that?",
        "Meg: When I left Paul, I thought that would force him to get some help. But I think it's just made him worse.",
        "Dusty: What did he do to you?",
        "Meg: Nothing. It's what he's going to do to you. You need to stay away from me, Dusty. Or Paul will find a way to hurt you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You didn't call me.",
        "Paul: No, I was supposed to call you?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I wanted to hear how things went with Meg.",
        "Paul: Oh, well, you know that really terrific idea I had about breaking into her hospital room? It turns out, not such a great idea. Why? How did everything go with Dusty?",
        "Emily: Badly. Worse than badly. I yelled at him. Not the best way to make him care about me more than he cares about Meg.",
        "Paul: No, he doesn't like women with a backbone.",
        "Emily: No, no, he likes them helpless and vulnerable. And right now, that's not me.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and even if she's not pregnant, Meg is a very vulnerable and sensitive woman. Which is why Dusty won't leave her alone. But I think I have a way to make all of that stop. I think I've hit on something that will finally just make all of that kind of go away.",
        "Emily: Really? What's that? Shoot -- shooting Dusty? That's your solution?",
        "Paul: Uh-huh.",
        "Emily: Oh my God, you have really crossed the line to Looneyville, haven't you?",
        "Paul: Look, if there was another way, I would do that. But there isn't.",
        "Emily: Wait -- wait a minute. You shoot Dusty, where does that leave me?",
        "Paul: What are you talking about? Oh, you already lost Dusty, right? If he's alive, all he's going to do is chase Meg. I may as well kill him.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. No, listen to me. You need to think this through. This is -- this is not the answer. I mean, you -- you shoot Dusty, you hurt him. Meg's going to hate you. And you -- you're going to end up prison or worse.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, you don't think I can get away with this?",
        "Emily: I do. I do, I think you could kill him and I think you could get away with it.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Emily: But if you end up losing Meg and your child in the process, is it worth it?",
        "Paul: No, the only thing I'm going to lose is like a 10,000 weight off my shoulders when Dusty's finally where he deserves to be -- in the ground.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul is dangerous. He already tried to --",
        "Dusty: Did he threaten you? Tell me.",
        "Meg: He tried to cause trouble for you. He tried to hire Derek Coburn to plant drugs on you.",
        "Dusty: Drugs? That is so amateur, Meg, it wouldn't even work.",
        "Meg: Well, we don't know because Derek wouldn't go through with it. Which means Paul is even more desperate.",
        "Dusty: Derek's the guy who's working with James, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, but he's not a bad guy. He has a conscience. He came to me. He told me the truth.",
        "Dusty: You confronted Paul. Why didn't you come to me? Why?",
        "Meg: Because apparently, I care more about your life than you do. Look -- look, Paul is on the edge and I don't want to give him any excuses to do something awful. Look, you need to back off, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: All right, take it easy. You're scaring the baby. Why don't you have a seat?",
        "Meg: You know, if you just stay away from me --",
        "Dusty: I'm not staying away from you. So, how's that?",
        "Meg: I love Paul, Dusty. And I want him to get better. And if something awful happens before -- look, just be careful.",
        "Dusty: I made a promise to Jennifer before she died that I would raise her son like he's my own. So I've got to live at least that long to keep that promise, okay? I can take care of myself, Meg. I'm worried about you.",
        "Meg: Paul loves me. He would never hurt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What's the matter? Did you and Brad have a fight?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, it will be okay. Just give it some time.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't think time is going to do it, Janet. We've been fighting like crazy. He fought in the middle of one of our segments for \"Oakdale Now.\" We were carving pumpkins.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on now. How bad can it be?",
        "Katie: So bad that Kim put \"Oakdale Now\" on hiatus indefinitely.",
        "Janet: What? But you and Brad are so good together.",
        "Katie: Well, now, it's going to be Brad and Spencer. Isn't that great? They're still on-air.",
        "Janet: Oh --",
        "Katie: And the worst part is he's --",
        "Janet: Honey, wait, wait, wait, wait -- don't cry now. Come on, you can't leave me hanging. What's the worst part?",
        "Katie: The worst part is Brad has never been this mad at me. And I don't know how to fix it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey.",
        "Spencer: Oh, wait until you see what I've got. Oh, no.",
        "Brad: Spencer, you're just -- I'm fine, okay? You can stop worrying about me.",
        "Spencer: Oh no, tell me you and Katie are not still fighting because of me.",
        "Brad: No, we're not fighting because we're not talking.",
        "Spencer: Oh, Brad. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, let's talk about something else.",
        "Spencer: How about we munch on something else?",
        "Brad: Candy?",
        "Spencer: Yeah --",
        "Brad: Oh!",
        "Spencer: For our segment on Halloween safety. We've got to look through all the different varieties and choose which ones we want to use on the segment.",
        "Brad: I love these. They set off these tiny little explosions in your mouth.",
        "Spencer: Oh, these are the kind that my grandmother used to buy.",
        "Brad: Mmm, oh, do you have any those -- um, what do you call --",
        "Spencer: Whatever they are, I've got them here. I've got everything you can possibly want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brad just won't talk to me. What if he doesn't hear me? What if he moves out?",
        "Janet: Oh, come on now. That is not going to happen. He loves you way too much.",
        "Katie: You really think so?",
        "Janet: Absolutely. Look, there was a time when I never would have said this, but there is nobody better for Bradley than you.",
        "Janet: I know, I know, considering we have a kid together. But I am completely and totally over him. I want you and Bradley to be as happy as Jack and I.",
        "Katie: So things worked out with Jack?",
        "Janet: Ta-da!",
        "Katie: Janet, that's wonderful --",
        "Janet: We're engaged!",
        "Katie: Oh, my God! Ignore the tears, ignore the tears -- that's wonderful. Oh, I'm so happy for you! Okay, really, yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Paul. Paul, you're scaring me. Killing Dusty is not the answer. Don't you see how crazy this is?",
        "Paul: I'm not crazy. I'm not -- don't you call me crazy. I want her back. I want Meg in my house. I want her in my bed. I want to raise our child together. That's not crazy, is it?",
        "Emily: No. I know you want to be a father. I know how much you want that. You almost had that chance with our baby -- with Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. I know, I think about that all the time.",
        "Emily: I do, too. I mean, I know you and I weren't -- quite right together. But I always knew you'd make a great dad.",
        "Paul: Thanks. Why are you saying all this?",
        "Emily: Partly because of James, I guess.",
        "Paul: I guess I never did have a role model.",
        "Emily: No, but you always managed to stand up to him, be your own man. You turned out to be the kind of man James could never have been. You'll teach your children. You will love them. You will protect them. But you'll never bully them. You know that's the easy way out.",
        "Paul: I'm not looking for the easy way out. You think it's easy to kill Dusty? It's not. It's just something that is necessary.",
        "Emily: No, but is it more necessary than Meg? If you kill Dusty, where does that leave Meg? Where does that leave -- where does that leave your baby?",
        "Paul: Look, every time that Dusty's around, Meg doesn't even look at me. Everything that Dusty does makes me look weak. I just -- I don't ever want her to see me like that.",
        "Emily: Well, then, be strong. I know it's the hardest thing imaginable right now, but just be strong. Be there for your child. Be there to raise your child. Regardless of what happens with Dusty, whether he stays or goes, you need to be the one to raise your child.",
        "Paul: You're right.",
        "Emily: Listen to me. Listen to me, we will find another way.",
        "[Emily leaves]",
        "James: What kind of man are you? You actually let that woman stop you from doing what you have to do.",
        "Paul: You're not real. You're only in my head.",
        "James: What's more real than being in your head?",
        "Paul: Oh, stop it, will you? Will you just stop? You're making me crazy.",
        "James: You don't need my help for that. You're doing a fine job all on your own. I'm just trying to help you become your own man. But you're always hiding behind some woman's skirt.",
        "Paul: What do you expect from me?",
        "James: I expect for you to take responsibility for your life. You want to keep your wife? You want to keep Meg? Then just get rid of the competition. Take that gun and use it on Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Do you want to order in and work through lunch?",
        "Brad: Sure. This candy's making me hungry.",
        "Janet: Brad, hi. Oh, Spencer, right?",
        "Spencer: Oh yeah, that's right, ms. --",
        "Janet: Janet, just call me Janet. Do you have a second please?",
        "Brad: Sure. Yeah, I'll order and I'll come get you.",
        "Spencer: Perfect. Oh.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Brad: Is it Liberty? Is she okay?",
        "Janet: No, no, no. Liberty is fine. She's fine. I just, I have some news, and I you to be the first person to hear it. Jack and I are engaged.",
        "Brad: Wow.",
        "Janet: Yeah, I know, I know and I want your blessing because I know it's a little bit awkward, since he's your brother and stuff, but you know -- but at the same time, it's no stranger then Katie being Jack's ex, so -- anyway, I'm really, really happy, and I want you to be happy for me.",
        "Brad: Congratulations.",
        "Janet: Yes, oh, thank you, thank you so much! And you know what? Nothing's really gonna change with liberty, you know? I mean, she's old enough to figure out who's house she wants to be at, for how long. You know, that's all going to be good, so -- I really think Jack and I could make it.",
        "Brad: Hey, that'd be great if somebody can. So, is that it? Because you know, I've got this work thing.",
        "Janet: No, wait, that's not it. Listen, I wasn't going to say anything because it's none of my business, but you look just as miserable as Katie did.",
        "Brad: What, Katie looks miserable?",
        "Janet: Yes, and I'm very happy today. It's a happy day. I don't want anyone else to be sad so I've got one thing to say to you, Bradley. You are a complete and total idiot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, Jack. Is Margo around?",
        "Jack: Margo's working a case. Can I help?",
        "Katie: I don't even know if Margo can help. Oh, God. Sorry, why do I keep crying?",
        "Jack: Um, come on, come on in here. Come on. Want some water or something?",
        "Katie: No, you know what? I'm just going to go home. Will you please have her call me as soon as she gets here?",
        "Jack: It could be late, Katie. Listen if it helps, Margo filled me in on this alleged break-in of Spencer's room.",
        "Katie: Great, did she tell the whole world?",
        "Jack: It's an active case, Katie.",
        "Katie: One mistake and it will not go away.",
        "Jack: So, am I to assume this mistake is the reason why you and Brad are having problems?",
        "Katie: Why do you think Brad and I are having problems?",
        "Jack: Because you're here looking for your sister instead of crying on your husband's shoulder. What's going on?",
        "Katie: Brad doesn't love me anymore.",
        "Jack: Oh, Katie, if you believe that, you're just being an idiot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Jack and I are having a celebratory lunch at the Lakeview. You're coming along.",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Janet: Because I'm going to invite Katie to come, too, and then you two will be caught up in the romance of the celebration and the love and the champagne glasses clinking and while we are doing that, you can take your hand and you can put it under the table and gently squeeze her leg --",
        "Brad: Okay, okay.",
        "Janet: And then you can whisper sweet nothings into her ear --",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay. I know how to seduce my wife.",
        "Janet: Okay, good! Seduce for lunch, and then the follow through after dinner. Okay, what do you say? What do you say? Do you love Katie or not?",
        "Brad: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Janet: Good.",
        "Brad: Yes, Janet. I will see you at the Lakeview.",
        "Janet: Good.",
        "Brad: Hey, Spencer I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that lunch. Something came up.",
        "Spencer: Oh, okay, sure. I totally understand.",
        "Brad: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Let me ask you something. Do you still want to be married to my brother?",
        "Katie: Of course, I don't want to divorce Brad. I love him. I'll love him forever and, if he wants to get rid of me, he can move to a different universe.",
        "Jack: And he feels the same way about you?",
        "Katie: He doe I know he does.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right, then what does it matter why Spencer has a bunch of fake money in a suitcase under her bed? It has nothing to do with you, Katie. It's none of your business and it's got nothing to do with your marriage.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Jack: All right, so drop it. Make sure Henry drops it, too.",
        "Katie: Oh, I will. Now if I can only get Brad to ever talk to me again --",
        "Jack: I have an idea. I'm supposed to meet Janet at the Lakeview for lunch --",
        "Katie: To celebrate your engagement! Oh, Jack, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I've been so messed up in my own stuff. Congratulations.",
        "Jack: Well, thank you, thank you. Listen, why don't you come and help us celebrate. I'll call Brad and have him meet us there, too.",
        "Katie: He might not want to come.",
        "Jack: Oh, he'll be there. He'll be there. And we'll sic Janet on him. She's so over the moon, it's contagious. And I guarantee that you and Brad will jump on the bandwagon.",
        "Katie: You really love her, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, I really do.",
        "Katie: She's a good person. And she just might deserve you. Okay, see you at lunch.",
        "Jack: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Will that cover it?",
        "Derek: Yeah, more then enough. Let's just say I've been eating light these days.",
        "Dusty: If you had taken that job with Paul Ryan, I'd be up against drug charges right now.",
        "Derek: Meg told you?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Why didn't you take the money and run?",
        "Derek: You don't know me. There are a lot of things I won't do for money.",
        "Dusty: Hold on a second. The least I can do is pay you for not doing it.",
        "Derek: I don't want a handout. I'm looking for a job.",
        "Dusty: What kind of job?",
        "Derek: Well, I got a record so -- I'd be lucky to find a job digging ditches.",
        "Dusty: Manual labor doesn't pay.",
        "Derek: Well, a man's got to do what he's got to do to survive.",
        "Dusty: What'd you see?",
        "Derek: Guy that just came in, leather jacket, baseball cap. Poked his head in before, and then took off again. Are you being followed?",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't notice. How would I notice?",
        "Derek: Guy's probably just lost but I'd watch your back if I were you. Paul Ryan wants to follow in his father's footsteps, but he's only half as good at it.",
        "Dusty: You're right about that.",
        "Derek: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: If you want a job, I've got one for you.",

        "Psychic: I'm sorry to disturb you.",
        "Paul: Do I know you?",
        "Psychic: I have to tell you something. Whatever you are planning to do, don't do it.",
        "Paul: All right, so I've been thinking about it and maybe you're right. You know, maybe putting Dusty out of everybody's misery isn't such a great idea.",
        "Emily: I thought we'd already decided that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but after you left, you know, I kind of changed my mind a little bit.",
        "Emily: Oh God, Paul, you need help.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, to make sure that nothing like that doesn't happen again, you know, to avoid temptation, I need for you to hold on to my gun -- and no, that's not code for anything.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, I'll be very happy to stop by your place and pick it up after work -- what is that? What are you doing? You were walking around with that? You can't do this!",
        "Paul: Well, I know, that's why I'm giving it to you. That way I won't be walking around with it anymore.",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Paul: Emily, there's really no point in me giving you the gun to hide if you show me where the key is.",
        "Emily: Good point.",
        "Paul: All right, listen, I know I've been talking crazy lately, I got a lot of really weird thoughts floating around in my head. But I think it's going to pass.",
        "Emily: Really? How long is this window of sanity gonna last? Because I'm telling you right now, you're not going to better unless you get professional help, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Em, you think I'm crazy?",
        "Emily: Not right this second.",
        "Paul: Okay. I guess I don't need to worry then.",
        "Dusty: You guys are spending a lot of time together these days. Anything going on I should know about?",
        "Paul: Actually, yeah, there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Derek. Hey, is something wrong? Did Paul contact you again?",
        "Derek: No, no, everything's fine as far as I know. May I come in?",
        "Meg: Yeah, please.",
        "Derek: So, I just had a conversation with Dusty Donovan.",
        "Meg: Did he thank you for saving him from Paul?",
        "Derek: I think he did. The guy kind of talks between the lines.",
        "Meg: Yeah, tell me about it. Well, I will gladly thank you for saving both Paul and Dusty.",
        "Derek: So, you think you and Paul will get back together again?",
        "Meg: I don't know. I just know I don't want him to do anything to hurt himself. Or hurt anybody else. I just worry about him.",
        "Derek: You say that, but are you willing to do something about it?",
        "Meg: Of course I am. Whatever Paul needs, I will help him --",
        "Derek: Well, then you wouldn't mind if I stay around for a little while to make sure that nothing bad happens?",
        "Meg: Dusty hired you as my bodyguard? That guy is beyond stubborn. You know, I told him I did not need any protection --",
        "Derek: And -- and you're probably right, but if you could just put up with it for a little while, you'd really -- you'd do me a favor. I need the work.",
        "Meg: Well, how could I say no to that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not here to see Emily.",
        "Dusty: You're standing in her office.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I'm here to see you. Dusty, I owe you an apology. After my father died, I kind of spiraled out of control. And I don't know, I think I kind of lost touch with reality for a little while.",
        "Dusty: No kidding.",
        "Paul: It was completely irrational of me to accuse you of trying to steal my inheritance.",
        "Dusty: And stealing your wife.",
        "Emily: Will you -- Dusty, give him a chance. Hear him out --",
        "Paul: Emily's right -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hope you can accept my apology.",
        "Dusty: What do you hope to gain with your apology?",
        "Paul: I miss Meg. I want my wife back, and she's not coming back if I keep attacking you. I'm calling a truce.",
        "Dusty: If you say so.",
        "Paul: I'm not just saying it. I mean it, Dusty. I'm sorry. I hope you both have a great day.",
        "Emily: So what did you think?",
        "Dusty: What a joke.",

        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey! I thought we were going to meet at the Lakeview.",
        "Janet: We were, we were. Wait a minute. Give me a minute. I need to bask.",
        "[Janet exclaims]",
        "Jack: Bask?",
        "Janet: Yes, I'm basking. Here I am at the Oakdale Pd visiting my brand-new fianc\u00e9, showing my brand-new, beautiful ring. Look at that. How cool is that, huh?",
        "Jack: It's very -- it's very cool. And you are very cute, fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Janet: Oh, thanks. Hold that thought -- the cute one. Because when I ask you what I'm about to ask you, I want you to still think I'm cute and not annoying.",
        "Jack: Lay it on me. What did you do?",
        "Janet: Okay, I know we're supposed to celebrate by ourselves at the Lakeview for lunch today. But Brad and Katie are in a really big fight and they're miserable -- so why are you laughing? Because they're miserable?",
        "Jack: I am laughing because I think it's funny that you invited them to lunch when I already did.",
        "Janet: You did?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I did.",
        "Janet: When?",
        "Jack: Katie just left and I was about to call Brad when you walked in.",
        "Janet: Well, don't bother because I already asked him.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Janet: How funny is that? We're already starting to think alike.",
        "Jack: Oh, boy.",
        "Janet: See? Just proves that we belong together.",
        "Jack: Was there ever any doubt, hmm?",
        "Janet: Well, I didn't think so, but I thought you might have a doubt.",
        "Jack: No, well, actually, I do. I doubt that there will ever be a day that you don't make me smile. Or when I don't realize how damn lucky I am that you love me.",

        "Henry: Hey, hey, Katie, don't you answer your phone anymore?",
        "Katie: I got your message. But as soon as I heard you mention Spencer's name, I deleted it. Because I don't want to know!",
        "Henry: Yeah, but you got to hear what I saw her do this morning.",
        "Katie: Do not say one more word to me about Spencer ever again. I'm in enough trouble as it is with Brad already. I want to make up with him, not make it worse. Please.",
        "Henry: Katie, Katie -- hold that thought.",
        "Katie: Who's that guy? He looks kind of scuzzy.",
        "Henry: I would tell you, but then I'd have to mention you-know-who.",
        "Katie: Don't say her name. Dot even think it!",
        "Clerk: May I help you, Sir?",
        "Thug: I need to leave this package with one of your guests, Spencer McKay.",
        "Clerk: I'll see that she gets it.",
        "Henry: That's the guy she was talking to this morning.",
        "Katie: Why would she be -- I don't want to know.",
        "Henry: She was waiting to get something after someone died.",
        "Katie: Henry, stop -- stop -- I said stop it!",
        "Henry: Did you see that guy? He looks like a hit man or something. Katie, come on --",
        "Katie: I'm not listening. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la. I'm not listening -- oh, shut up. Hi. How are you?",
        "Brad: I'm good. I'm good. You?",
        "Katie: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Brad: Me too. I didn't know if you were going to be here, but I'm glad you are.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: No, you know what? I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry. Listen, clean slate? Can you believe that Jack and Janet are engaged?",
        "Katie: They're both so happy though. And why shouldn't they be? This is such an amazing time.",
        "Brad: What, getting engaged?",
        "Katie: No, the moment you realize you're with the person that you want to be with for the rest of your life.",
        "Brad: I still feel that way.",
        "Katie: Me too. So, why are we sweating the small stuff?",
        "Brad: I don't know. I don't know but I want it to stop.",
        "Katie: Me too.",
        "Henry: A music box? There's got to be more to it than that. Oh, damn it!",
        "Spencer: You stole it!",
        "Henry: No, no. No, no, no -- I can explain this. I can explain this.",
        "Spencer: That's my grandmother's music box. How did you get it if you didn't steal it? I should have known that you would have something to do with this. Why do you keep doing this to me?",
        "Katie: I didn't. Brad, I didn't.",
        "Brad: Henry, what the hell are you doing here?",
        "Henry: I saw Spencer with some tough-looking guy this morning. And they were talking about someone dying.",
        "Spencer: You eavesdropped on my conversation?",
        "Henry: Then the same guy delivered a package for her and I had to investigate.",
        "Spencer: That guy was my brother.",
        "Henry: Come on, he doesn't look anything like you.",
        "Spencer: He was a brother and the person who died was my grandmother. And this is the only thing that I had left from her and you have destroyed it!",
        "Henry: Your grandmother?",
        "Brad: Shut up, Henry. You know, just take it easy. We'll find a way to fix it.",
        "Henry: I'm -- I'm so sorry. I didn't -- I obviously misread this whole thing. I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: I cannot believe you.",
        "Katie: I didn't do anything.",
        "Brad: Were you pretending to make up with me so Henry would have a chance to steal that from Spencer?",
        "Katie: No, that is not what happened --",
        "Henry: No, Katie -- Katie had nothing to do with it. In fact, she asked me not to do it, Brad.",
        "Brad: Oh, so you did talk to him? You promised me you would get him to back off.",
        "Katie: That's what we talked about. I told him to back off and never mention Spencer's name to me again.",
        "Brad: Why should I believe that?",
        "Katie: Because I'm your wife and I said so.",

        "Emily: I want to apologize for what I said to you at the hospital.",
        "Dusty: Forget about it.",
        "Emily: I don't want to forget about it. I don't want us to just to be co- workers here. We mean more to each other than that.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to lead you on.",
        "Emily: You haven't. I shouldn't have gone off on you.",
        "Dusty: Meg is my friend who happens to be married to a lunatic.",
        "Emily: I understand that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have questioned you about that. You haven't made me any promises, and I don't expect any. I just -- I wish you would forgive me for what I said. I'm sorry, Dusty. Please just know that you can count on me as your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Derek: Nice flowers. But you can't see her, Paul.",
        "Dusty: I don't know if we can be friends, you know. After some of the things you said.",
        "Emily: I know -- about Jennifer and Johnny. I'm sorry. I was angry.",
        "Dusty: You were honest.",
        "Emily: Meg's pregnant and vulnerable, just like Jen. She makes you feel needed.",
        "Dusty: So what? She doesn't replace my wife. Nobody does. You don't either.",
        "Emily: I know that.",
        "Dusty: What are you -- are you waiting for me to wake up one day and decide that you're it for me?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Dusty: I wish it could be you. And I wish I can forget about Jennifer. But do you understand that I can't?",
        "Emily: I need you to understand something. I don't have many friends, Dusty. When they get to know me, they find out they don't want to know me.",
        "Dusty: That's their loss.",
        "Emily: You want your space, I'll give it to you. If you want me to back off, I will. I just -- we're good together, me and you. And friends if nothing more. Please, I hope you'll consider that.",
        "Dusty: I got to make sure that you don't want something that I can't give.",

        "Paul: That would be great. Thank you. If you see her, could you tell her something for me? Could you tell her that I love her? And that I'm going to do what she asked and go get some help so I could be okay. Not just for her, but for the baby. Could you tell her that for me, please?",

        "Dusty: Oh, don't waste your time. I don't really believe in that stuff.",
        "Psychic: No, a lot of people are skeptical. But that doesn't affect what is clear to me. You're on a journey, and you're going about it all wrong.",
        "Dusty: No offense, but I don't need advice from a stranger.",
        "Psychic: You need to know this much at least. The one you should be focusing on is your wife.",
