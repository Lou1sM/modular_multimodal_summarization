        "\r\nChris: She didn't tell you what happened? ",
        "\r\nEmily: No. I haven't spoken to her, neither has my mom. She didn't come home \r\nlast night, so we assumed she was with you. ",

        "\r\nBonnie: Yeah, yeah, well, I will remind exactly who I am, and they'll bring it \r\nstraight up, okay? ",
        "\r\nSarah: Do you know why I have to stay home from school today? ",
        "\r\nBonnie: It's not that you have to stay home; it's just that your father feels \r\nlike it would be better if you did some work from home for a couple of days, \r\nthat's all. ",
        "\r\nSarah: Well, is it 'cause he was arrested? ",

        "\r\nTom: That is correct. The last time this office pressed charges against Mr. \r\nTravers, the case ended in a mistrial. However -- ",
        "\r\nReporter #1: Then why are you pressing charges against him again? ",
        "\r\nSarah: I thought all this was over. ",
        "\r\nJessica: Tom, if I may? A mistrial is not the same thing as a \"not guilty\" \r\nverdict. It simply means that mistakes were made, procedural mistakes. It is not \r\na comment on the charges, the strength of the case or the innocence or guilt of \r\nthe defendant. ",
        "\r\nReporter #2: Why now, Mr. Hughes? What happened to prompt -- ",
        "\r\nSarah: So what happened? ",
        "\r\nReporter #2: -- You to re-prosecute at this time? ",
        "\r\nTom: Well, let me say first that the District Attorney has discretion in these \r\nmatters. This office has waited months, sometimes years, before retrying a case \r\nthat ended in mistrial. ",
        "\r\nReporter #2: So there've been new developments? ",
        "\r\nTom: There are new developments all the time. In fact, that's a new haircut, \r\nisn't it, Larry? ",

        "\r\nTom: No, I should tell you that I wouldn't be pursuing this matter unless I were \r\nvery confident about our case. ",
        "\r\nJessica: This time, justice will be served. ",
        "\r\nSarah: So this is your mother. She's the one who's doing all this to us. ",
        "\r\nReporter #1: Is it really justice you're after, Ms. Griffin? Or is it more \r\npersonal than that? ",
        "\r\nJessica: There is nothing more personal than justice. Rape is violence. It \r\ndegrades not only the person attacked but the entire community if the \r\nperpetrator is not held accountable. ",
        "\r\nReporter #2: You're employed by the District Attorney's office. Doesn't that \r\nsuggest a conflict of interest? ",

        "\r\nJessica: Excuse me, Tom. The D.A. and I agreed that this case is too important \r\nto allow these kinds of distractions. Therefore, I've resigned from my position \r\nin the District Attorney's office as of this morning. ",

        "\r\nMolly: So, you knew about this? ",
        "\r\nMarshall: They cuffed me in front of my kid. Hauled me out of a Halloween party \r\nand dragged me down to the station. Obviously, they're trying to punish me in \r\nthe flashiest way possible. This is nothing but a charade. ",
        "\r\nMolly: You've been accused of rape. ",
        "\r\nMarshall: Accused. And innocent until proven guilty, which will never happen. \r\nNow, listen -- they have no case. Okay? This is personal. Jessica Griffin is \r\nmerely using her influence with the District Attorney's office to pressure me \r\nbecause our daughters are spending time together. That's all this is about. ",
        "\r\nMolly: The District Attorney's motivation doesn't concern me. But your \r\nreputation does. Now, rightly or wrongly, you've been hung out to dry publicly. \r\nAnd that has an effect. You admitted it yourself when you made that remark about \r\n\"tainted jury.\" So if you go in there to defend Dusty, the jury's gonna know \r\nexactly who you are, and they're gonna have no sympathy, for you or for him. And \r\nwe can't take that risk. We can\u2019t. Listen, we've come too far. We have invested \r\nway too much to lose it just because of one guy. There are other attorneys, \r\nDusty. This one's got to go. ",
        "\r\nMarshall: Listen, you're overreacting. ",

        "\r\nChris: Look, this wasn't my idea, okay? The hotel, the not answering the phone. \r\nI went over there knowing I was being set up. ",
        "\r\nEmily: \"Set up\"? ",
        "\r\nChris: Yes. Set up. I told Alison that we needed to slow things down. Okay? And \r\nshe goes out and rents a hotel room. ",

        "\r\nTom: No, she's allied herself with Sarah. ",
        "\r\nJessica: Same thing! She's in his orbit. She sees him every day. They're \r\nplanning Sarah\u2019s future together. Or at least that's what he'd like her to \r\nthink, that he's accepted her being a part of Sarah\u2019s life. ",
        "\r\nTom: And maybe he has. ",
        "\r\nJessica: No, no. See, Tom, you say that because that's what you would do, and \r\nthat's what I would do. But Marshall -- he's incapable of empathy. He's \r\ncompletely out of tune with other people -- their wants, whether they're upset, \r\nwhether they're happy. Marshall wants what Marshall wants. And God help anybody \r\nwho gets in his way. I mean, why do you think Sarah\u2019s clinging to Bonnie in the \r\nfirst place? ",

        "\r\nJessica: Well, then everybody wins. And Sarah is free of him. ",
        "\r\nTom: Giving Bonnie what she always wanted, which will bring her back to you. \r\nIt's a gamble, Jess. ",
