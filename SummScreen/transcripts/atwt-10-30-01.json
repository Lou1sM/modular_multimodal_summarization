        "Molly: So what's this about Bryant not having his trust fund anymore?",
        "\r\nCarly: Well, I just -- I think he wanted to make it on his own. It had something \r\nto do with Jennifer and maybe his sense of his own self, you know?",
        "\r\nMolly: But nobody tried to take it away from him, like Craig or Lucinda?",
        "\r\nCarly: Oh, no, no, no. He still had the money. In fact, Craig had just tried to \r\nborrow some to bankroll me. I said no, of course, but you know Craig.",
        "\nMolly: Not as well as you do, apparently. Did something happen while I was gone?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yeah, sort of, in a different place.",

        "\r\nCarly: I tried to seduce him.",

        "\r\nCraig: Just something about Bryant in your own words, maybe that time we all \r\nwent fly fishing?",
        "\r\nSierra: I think I still have pictures of it.",
        "\r\nBilly: No! Look, I can't. It just wouldn't be right. Nobody even knows me here.",
        "\r\nSierra: What are you talking about? Everybody knows you. You are Bryant's \r\ncousin, his best friend.",
        "\r\nCraig: You've spent more time recently with him than I have.",
        "\r\nSierra: And listen, you won't be alone. I'm going to ask Jennifer to speak.",

        "\r\nJennifer: Was he asking about Bryant?",
        "\r\nHal: Some. I answered his questions. He goes back to what he's doing. Ten \r\nminutes later, we do it all again. How are you?",
        "\r\nJennifer: The same.",
        "\r\nHal: I'm sorry Adam's having such a tough time with this thing.",
        "\r\nJennifer: Yeah, well, you know that Bryant and I broke up, so I guess that makes \r\neverything seem worse.",
        "\r\nHal: He'll get over it. Jennifer, you didn't cause that accident.",

        "\r\nHal: Okay.",
        "\r\nJennifer: And maybe I'll just -- well, Bryant's mom and dad asked to see Billy. \r\nMaybe -- maybe I should be there, too.",

        "\r\nJack: It had to be him. He told Carly to meet him in the gazebo at Fairwinds. \r\nOnly I got there first, and I found a whole slew of surveillance photographs of \r\nher in private meetings with Paul Ryan.",
        "\r\nHal: Are you sure this isn't another one of Craig Montgomery's little tricks, or \r\nmaybe Paul Ryan's?",
        "\r\nJack: Carly is working with Paul, and neither one of them want Barbara to know. \r\nAs far as Montgomery goes, he's trying to make a play on Carly. The last thing \r\nhe's gonna do is screw it up with something like this. It has to be Steinbeck.",

        "\r\nBarbara: I don't think so. Someone smashed his windshield. Why don't you look \r\nthis over while he's cleaning up the glass, turning off the car alarm and \r\ncalling the manager?",
        "\r\nRose: No, thank you. I have plans tonight. Do yourself a favor. Get out!",
        "\r\nBarbara: I'm doing you a favor. I'm giving you the opportunity to stop this \r\nbefore it reaches my son. Oh, come on. Where's that Jersey pluck? You're not \r\nscared, are you? It's amazing how cooperative the Atlantic City Police were. \r\nThat is your rap sheet, isn't it? The one that states you're a convicted \r\nprostitute?",
        "\r\nRose: How did you get this? You don't even leave the house?",
        "\r\nBarbara: I had help.",
        "\r\nRose: You hired somebody to do a background check on me?",
        "\r\nBarbara: Ooh, what a good idea. If it was this easy to uncover that you served \r\n30 days for prostitution, imagine what a P.I. could dig up.",
        "\r\nRose: You know what? Go ahead. I don't care. Knock your socks off. Spend all \r\nyour money. The only thing you're gonna come up with is the fact that it was a \r\nscared kid who made a mistake. I did my time, and now, it's over!",
        "\r\nBarbara: And look at you, an inspiration. I think I'll pass along a copy of that \r\nto Emily Stewart. Her readers would thrill to the story, from scared kid to \r\nwhore, from whore to showgirl, from showgirl to Lucinda Walsh's gopher.",
        "\r\nRose: I'm not a gopher. I'm vice-president of Worldwide now.",
        "\r\nBarbara: Of course you are, dear. From vice-president back to whore. Emily's got \r\nconnections, Rose. You might end up with your own movie of the week.",
        "\r\nRose: Who would play Paul, Barbara? You're right. It's a good story -- good \r\nstory, but I see, like, miniseries, you know? Maybe they'll put you in it, play \r\nthe mother of the boyfriend. Every good story always has to have somebody to \r\nhate. Don't bother with your threats. It doesn't matter. I'll tell Paul. He's a \r\nbig boy. He'll understand. But you? He's gonna want to dropkick you, and honey, \r\nyou deserve it. You had a bum rap here, a bad deal. I understand that. What do \r\nyou do? You pick yourself up, move on with your life? No! You've got to put it \r\naround Paul's neck like a leash. \"Paul, do this for me, honey, would you? Paul, \r\ndo that for me, honey, would you?\" You know what? He's a grown man. He's got a \r\nmind of his own, and he can do what he wants. When he finds out what you've done \r\nhere today -- ",
        "\nBarbara: The bond between a mother and her child no more than I can imagine what \r\n$10 -- exactly. What does a customer get for $10?",

        "\r\nJack: Carly and I decided to take a break for awhile.",
        "\r\nHal: And that would hurt, if you had time to think about it, but you're too busy \r\nchasing after a guy who might not even be there.",
        "\r\nJack okay? He was there. I saw the guy.",
        "\r\nHal: In a flash of lightning on a day when the woman you loved was almost \r\nkilled. You used to be a cop, Jack. You tell me. Are you a reliable witness?",

        "\r\nCarly: And rule number two, don't help me, which -- well, he's been a little \r\nbetter. At least he asked me before he went to Bryant to borrow that money, and \r\nI wasn't going to change any of my plans, and he knows that.",
        "\r\nMolly: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What plans?",
        "\r\nCarly: I can't really talk about it, but it's good. I sold a few designs.",

        "\r\nMolly: And Craig had absolutely nothing to do with this?",
        "\r\nCarly: No, nothing to do with it. He didn't even know about it at first, and \r\nthen, he found out, and you know Craig. He's Craig. He doesn't always like to \r\nbegin at the beginning. He wants me to have my own show in Paris or whatever. \r\nBut we've been talking, and seeing each other occasionally. ",

        "\r\nCarly: It's terrible, isn't it? The man is completely wrong for me. He nearly \r\ndestroyed my entire life. I'm not supposed to like it, but I did. I liked it.",
        "\r\nMolly: Okay.",
        "\r\nCarly: Okay? You don't hate me? Because I think you could probably understand, \r\nand I'm not saying that it's going anywhere, because it's not.",

        "\r\nCarly: He turned me down.",
        "\r\nMolly: Wow.",
        "\r\nCarly: It's true. I guess the gist of it is that when he thinks about the two of \r\nus together, we're happy. That's how he wants it to be.",
        "\r\nMolly: You could almost like the guy. So what about you and Jack?",
        "\r\nCarly: Jack? I don't know. You'd have to ask him. We keep having these \r\nencounters, and he keeps saying that we both need time. I think he's probably \r\nright. I don't know.",

        "\r\nCarly: I don't know, but if I am supposed to be waiting for him, I think \r\nsomebody should tell me quickly. You know, I have to go. Parker's with his \r\nsecond favorite sitter, so I have some time to sketch.",
