        "Lucy: Aaron, I've been \r\nthinking a lot about us. We need to talk. Could you meet me at Java?\r\n",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah, \r\nsure. Sure, I'm on the way. On the way. Lucy wants to see me. Maybe \r\nshe's changed her mind about forgiving me. I don't know. That would be \r\nso amazing. ",
        "Alison: That's great.\r\n",
        "Aaron: Alison -- \r\nAlison, I'm sorry. ",
        "Alison: What are you \r\nsorry for? This probably means that Lucy wants to get back together. \r\nThat's fantastic. ",
        "Aaron: I just wish the \r\nsame thing was happening for you and Chris. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I \r\nguess that's just the way that life goes. But at least one of us can \r\nhave a happy ending, right? ",

        "Emily: So you're over \r\nAlison? End of story? ",
        "Chris: We were never \r\nright together. ",
        "Emily: Well, for not \r\nbeing right, you both made some pretty serious moves, don't you think?\r\n",
        "Chris: Wrong moves.\r\n",
        "Emily: Oh, I get it. \r\nYou tried to talk to Alison. She pushed you away. She probably threw you \r\nout the front door and told you to get a life, right? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, something \r\nlike that. ",
        "Emily: Come on. That's \r\nclassic Alison. When she feels rejected, she pushes away the one person \r\nshe wants the most, Chris. ",
        "Chris: No, the person \r\nthat she wants most was the guy grabbing a shower in her hotel room. I \r\nmean, here I was worried about breaking Alison\u2019s heart, and she's \r\nalready moved on to bachelor number two. ",

        "Henry: Yeah, see, the \r\nthing is we've got this thing out at the cottage. ",
        "Katie: What thing?\r\n",
        "Henry: Oh, a thing -- \r\na messy thing. Yeah, and I think we might need, like, an exterminator or \r\nsomething like that, 'cause it's under the porch. It's in the garbage. \r\nIt's -- ah, what am I doing here? I'm bothering you with the tales of \r\nthe varmints out at the old homestead. Why don't you and I step outside \r\nand talk about it, and we can leave this poor guy in peace, huh? \r\n",
        "Katie: Sure, yeah. \r\nI'll see you in a minute. ",

        "Henry: Come on, come \r\non. Give it to me, give it to me. There it is. I love it, I love it. \r\nYou're out of the woods, peaches. The cops have someone else on the hook \r\nfor Mike's hit-and-run. ",
        "Katie: What? Who?\r\n",
        "Henry: Oh, it's just \r\nsomeone that we all know and love and whose name you will never guess in \r\na million years. ",

        "Ben: How did it go?\r\n",
        "Jessica: He was \r\nfurious, but he knows when he's cornered. But then Bonnie showed up a \r\nlittle while later, and she demanded to know what I said to him. And \r\nwhen I told her I wasn't gonna back down, she was furious. And she ran \r\nout of here looking for Sarah. ",
        "Ben: Calm down. Calm \r\ndown. I'm sure that she's all right. Look, why don't I meet you at Al's?\r\n",

        "Marshall: Yes. Please \r\nhave my bill prepared. If there are any outstanding charges, just bill \r\nthem to my credit card. No, I'm leaving tonight. ",
        "Sarah: You know, I \r\nwish you would just tell me why we have to leave. ",
        "Marshall: Sarah, baby, \r\nI told you I will explain on the way. Are you finished packing? \r\n",

        "Hal: Just because you \r\ndon't get the answer that you want doesn't mean that the people who love \r\nyou aren't listening, Will. ",
        "Paul: That's right. \r\nHal's right. ",
        "Hal: You know, we all \r\nget angry. It's just how we handle it that matters. And, you know, \r\nsometimes we need a little help. And that's why I think maybe it's a \r\ngood idea if you, your mom and me went to see Dr. Michaels. ",

        "Hal: Look, Will, we \r\ncan see her at her office. ",
        "Barbara: Hal, Hal, Hal \r\n-- I really don't think a psychiatrist is necessary if Will knows that \r\nhe has the love and support of his family. ",

        "Jennifer: Yes, Dad. \r\nAnd from all of us this time. It's worth a try. ",
        "Will: Please, Dad?\r\n",
        "Paul: Hey, you know, \r\nthis whole no more video game thing? It could be a good thing, give us \r\nsome more time to go out together. We could play some ball, maybe go \r\nbike riding. And, Will, listen, if I ever tick you off again, you need \r\nto tell me right to my face so that we could work it out. ",
        "Will: So I don't have \r\nto go see the doctor? ",
        "Hal: Well, we'll see \r\nhow it goes, Will. But no promises, okay? ",
        "Will: Can I go to my \r\nroom, Mom? ",
        "Barbara: Yeah, sure, \r\nhoney. How dare you make those kind of promises to him? How are you \r\ngonna be spending time and hanging out with him when you're with Rose in \r\nParis? ",
        "Hal: Back off, \r\nBarbara. Just back off. ",
        "Barbara: He's setting \r\nhim up for disappointment again, Hal! ",
        "Paul: I am not gonna \r\ndisappoint Will. As of right now, all of my plans are changing. \r\n",
        "Barbara: What kinds of \r\nplan have changed, Paul -- wedding plans, moving plans? Does Rose know \r\nabout these changes? ",
        "Hal: Give the guy a \r\nchance to answer, Barbara. ",
        "Paul: Rose and I have \r\ntalked about this. And we both want what is best for Will. ",
        "Barbara: She does? The \r\nwoman who attacked me in front of your little brother? The woman who \r\nsaid vile things about me in front of your brother? She wants what's \r\nbest for him? No, no, no, no, no. She's just saying all that to keep in \r\nyour good graces, Paul. ",

        "Hal: Do you have to go \r\non the attack? ",
        "Rose: No, that's okay. \r\nI'm used to it by now. You know, I read in one of these magazines that \r\nthe mother of the groom is supposed to sit in the corner and wear beige. \r\nCould you work on that, please? I cannot wait for you all to be there at \r\nthe wedding. ",
        "Jennifer: How fun.\r\n",

        "Rose: So what kind of \r\nchanges? The wedding's not canceled, is it? ",

        "Rose: Why not? \r\n",
        "Paul: You know, I just \r\n-- I feel right now that Will really needs me. ",
        "Rose: Will has Hal, \r\nand he has Miss Thing over there, and -- crazy horse over there. Why do \r\nwe have to turn our lives upside-down? That's what she wants. You know \r\nthat. ",
        "Paul: I haven't been \r\nliving up to my end of the bargain. And I just want a little bit of time \r\nso that we can show Will that he has a home with us no matter where we \r\nare. ",
        "Rose: I don't want \r\nWill hurting because of us. Believe me. But I got a little -- a little \r\nproblem. Jennifer gets what she wants. Barbara gets what she wants. Will \r\ngets what he wants. What about us? I mean, how long before you and me \r\nget to have a life together? ",
