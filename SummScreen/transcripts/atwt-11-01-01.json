See? It wasn't just us on Bryant's mind. He had a lot of \r\nstuff on his mind, and he should have known that he shouldn't have gotten behind \r\nthe wheel of a car and gone speeding around at night. That's how accidents end \r\nup happening, you know? Look, people will gossip. Okay? And they'll blame us. \r\nBut we knew the first time we touched that we were taking a risk.
