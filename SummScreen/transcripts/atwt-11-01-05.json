        "Mike: Do you know where Katie is?",
        "Henry: She's probably playing that crazy assassins game, like everyone else.",
        "Maddie: She's with B.J.",
        "Henry: And they're probably talking about abs and pecks and how to beef up business.",
        "Maddie: I think she's in trouble, Mike. B.J. is not who he says he is.",
        "Henry: He's a nerd! You saw the pocket protector. Big bucks is a dweeb from high school. And now that he's rich, he's trying to make everyone's life a little bit nicer.",
        "Maddie: His name is Byron Glass and he went to high school with Katie.",
        "Mike: She knows him?",
        "Maddie: No, that's just it. He's totally changed. She didn't recognize him. And now he's stalking her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Stop it! I'm not kissing you.",
        "B.J.: Katie, its okay.",
        "Katie: No, it's not okay. I don't care what you have in your fantasy. You can't just force yourself.",
        "B.J.: I love you. I've always loved you. And if you would just give me a chance, you would see what it is I've always known -- you and me, we belong together.",
        "Katie: Help! Help! Somebody out there, help me!",
        "B.J.: Hey! It's okay. It's okay. Look at me. You were never afraid of Byron, right? Well it's still me. I'm right here, inside here. So there's nothing to be afraid of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I love seeing those boys as cops.",
        "Carly: They're proud of you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and Sage? In that carrot costume? Are you kidding me?",
        "Carly: You know, I had a little pea pod costume for Rory. They were going to be peas and carrots. It's cute. It was J.J.'s idea. Parker was going to take the picture. You know they don't call him Rory anymore? Gwen calls him Billy. Look what I found in my bag. Every day I come across something else.",
        "Jack: I remember when we bought this for him.",
        "Carly: I have never seen a baby stop crying so fast. As soon as you put it in the carriage. He got so he couldn't even fall asleep without it, remember? Jack, he needs it. Look, the baby needs this. We have to get it to Gwen right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Is this --",
        "Will: Is this what?",
        "Gwen: I'm just wondering if you're --",
        "Will: Okay with this?",
        "Gwen: I can't even talk, I'm so --",
        "Will: Yeah, I know.",
        "Gwen: Happy.",
        "Will: That would be the word for it. But don't worry, I'm sure I'll find a way to mess things up.",
        "Gwen: No, that's my job. Or my Mom's.",
        "Will: Or mine.",
        "Gwen: Hell with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm sorry Jennifer. I am so sorry.",
        "Jennifer: For what? Were you expecting someone? The door was open.",
        "Paul: No. I hope not.",
        "Jennifer: Is somebody here? Because I heard you talking.",
        "Paul: He's gone.",
        "Jennifer: Who? Craig? I heard you say his name.",
        "Paul: I saw Craig.",
        "Jennifer: You saw Craig?",
        "Paul: He was in the mirror. Just now. He was laughing at me.",
        "Jennifer: You were asleep, okay. It was just a dream.",
        "Paul: No, I woke up. And then I saw him. And he was laughing at me. Because he won.",
        "Jennifer: He won? What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: Well, he hurt you. And then they locked him up. So, I hurt you. So you can see? We're the same -- Craig and I. No, I'm worse. I'm worse than Craig.",
        "Jennifer: Why don't you come back and lie down, okay?",
        "Paul: I couldn't live with myself if he hurt you, you know? I love you so much and I just wouldn't be able to live with myself. I could never forgive myself if he hurt you. So, I had to stop him.",
        "Jennifer: I am fine, okay? Really, you don't need to worry.",
        "Paul: No, you're not fine. And you're not going to be okay until I fix everything.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, Paul, you're not making any sense.",
        "Paul: That's because you don't understand. But how could you, really? You trust me.",
        "Jennifer: Of course I trust you. You're my brother. I love you. And today, at the cemetery, you were wonderful to me -- just gentle and loving. I have to move on. I have to grieve my son and move on.",
        "Paul: No, you see, that's it. That's it. That's just the thing. Jennifer, you don't need to grieve anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So is this an actual date?",
        "Will: Well I came over, and we went to a party and now we're standing on your mother's porch hoping she doesn't come out outside. Yeah, I think it sounds like a date.",
        "Gwen: It's so normal.",
        "Will: I wouldn't know.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm the girl who divorced her mother and had a kid before she graduated from high school. I have no idea how to do things the right way.",
        "Will: Well this feels pretty right.",
        "Gwen: Which means it's doomed.",
        "Will: We can say that. But, we keep finding our way back to each other.",
        "Gwen: Why is that?",
        "Will: Well, we started out as friends. We still are friends. It's just that it's better.",
        "Gwen: But what if -- I mean, I've gotten kind of used to counting on you.",
        "Will: Good.",
        "Gwen: But what if we get in a fight or something happens?",
        "Will: Gwen, I'm not going anywhere. How many times do you have to hear that?",
        "Iris: What the hell is going on out here?",
        "Gwen: Nothing.",
        "Iris: I thought you two were just friends.",
        "Gwen: Mom, go back inside.",
        "Iris: And leave you out here with a murderer? This boy killed his brother's fianc\u00e9e for crying out loud! I mean, why is everybody forgetting that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Gwen wasn't too happy to see you the last time you stopped by. In fact, she even accused you of trying to soften her up so she wouldn't press charges.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you're right. I just miss him.",
        "Jack: Honey. As far as the charges go, I think it's a safe bet that she's not going to let up.",
        "Carly: And I'll be prosecuted.",
        "Jack: We have Jessica on our side.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I spoke with her yesterday, trying to come up with some kind of defense. And I know there's no defending what I did to you.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, I knew the risks.",
        "Carly: But to lose your badge, Jack.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? Honey, I strong-armed a witness. I broke the rules.",
        "Carly: If you lose your job and I go to jail, they could take the kids.",
        "Jack: No, we are nowhere near that yet. Besides, I have a line on a job.",
        "Carly: Do you really think the bureau's going to take you back? You're under investigation.",
        "Jack: I don't know. We'll see. I'm meeting my guy tonight.",
        "Carly: And if he says no?",
        "Jack: Listen to me. We are going to get through this, okay? Like we get through everything else. But I can't let you go off half-cocked because you're scared. That only makes matters worse. And I'm not blaming you.",
        "Carly: No, you're right. You're right, I do. I get scared and then I try to fix it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and then I gotta fix what you tried to fix. And it's just a big mess. Honey, we're gonna try things differently this time. We're going to stay calm and let it play out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: B.J. has Katie in his bedroom?",
        "Maddie: I'm not sure but yeah, I think so. He made me put the disco ball up there.",
        "Mike: The disco ball?",
        "Maddie: From their high school prom. I know, it's nauseating. But I went up there and I knocked. The door was locked but I heard music coming --",
        "Henry: Wait, wait, Mike.",
        "Mike: Not this time. Not this time, Henry.",
        "Henry: You're gonna need the key.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Look, I'm glad I was important to you in high school. And that you worked so hard to change your life and build up your confidence, and you did. I mean, look at you. You're rich and thin and beautiful. You did it. And you know, that's my point -- you don't need me anymore, because I was just the inspiration. You're ready to go out there and take on the world.",
        "B.J: Here's the thing. None of that means anything without you by my side.",
        "Katie: Byron, you don't even know me.",
        "B.J: Yes, yes, yes I do. I know everything about you. I know what kind of shampoo you use. I know the name of your rabbit. I know every book you've checked out of the library since high school. You are everything I've ever wanted. Everything I deserve after all this time.",
        "Katie: You know what, though? There is a girl out there who's going to want to know every thing about you. I'm just not that girl. I'm sorry.",
        "B.J: Just give me a chance, okay? Just give me a chance. Katie, I'm sorry.",
        "[Grunting]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I know it's around here somewhere.",
        "Mike: Henry, give me the key!",
        "Henry: Here we go. Here it is.",
        "Maddie: Admit it. You feel better.",
        "Henry: Really, Maddie? Because I'm homeless now? Because I'm out of a job?",
        "Maddie: Hey, Katie -- the woman who you supposedly love -- is up there, trapped in B.J.'s bedroom.",
        "Henry: Why do you have to make it sound so sinister? All he wants is a little bit of time alone with her so he can explain to her who he really is.",
        "Maddie: That is not all he wanted. Trust me.",
        "Henry: Maddie, so what? So what, he had a terminal crush on her in the tenth grade. Is there a harm in that? She says no to him because she always says no. And then he cries his eyes out and then thud, we're back to reality. But you know what? You want to take that moment away from him. You just want to squash him.",
        "Maddie: You know, I read about this. Half a semester of psych in health class last year.",
        "Henry: Oh, wow.",
        "Maddie: You identify with him!",
        "Henry: Oh, whoa! I am nothing like Byron Glass.",
        "Maddie: Except for the fact that you both fell in love with Katie.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and she left me.",
        "Maddie: And that is why you feel for Byron.",
        "Henry: I don't -- no, I don't feel for Byron. Okay, all right, am I a little happy that he put a little bit of a scare into a certain local carpenter? Yeah, right, I'm human. But I would never hurt Katie on purpose. You know that. This has really messed you up. Do you understand? Me, I can go back and live in the limo from now until Shrove Tuesday. You -- B.J. was going to put you through college.",
        "Maddie: College? Once Mike flags B.J.'s little trip down memory lane, you can say goodbye to your little sister, because B.J. Green is going to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: No, please.",
        "B.J.: Just once. Then you'll know how I feel.",
        "Katie: I know how you feel. Heavy. I can't breathe.",
        "B.J.: Okay, sorry. Wait -- Katie --",
        "[Katie screams]",
        "Katie: Mike! Let's just get out of here!",
        "B.J.: Katie, wait!",
        "Mike: What the hell is going on?",
        "B.J.: I just wanted to --",
        "Mike: I know what you wanted. And, if you touch her again, I will kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You are so out of line.",
        "Iris: Tell it to the judge, cupcake, when he decides that -- well, it just might not be a good idea for the baby if you're playing kissy-face with someone who is fresh out of the state hospital for the criminally insane.",
        "Gwen: Will is not a threat to my kid.",
        "Will: Listen -- if this is a problem --",
        "Gwen: No, it's not a problem. All right? The doctors decided that a long time ago -- when they released him. You are welcome here any time.",
        "Iris: You are too smart for your own good, missy.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.",
        "Will: I'm not.",
        "Gwen: Then don't volunteer to leave, okay? If anyone's going anywhere, it's her.",
        "Will: Okay. I got it.",
        "Gwen: I just -- I'm sorry. I don't like people saying stuff about you.",
        "Will: Ditto.",
        "Gwen: I should go. I need to talk to my mom.",
        "Will: Okay. I guess I'll call you later?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.",
        "Iris: Baby's asleep. As if you cared.",
        "Gwen: I wouldn't be putting up with you if I didn't care about him.",
        "Iris: You know, I wouldn't be saying those things to me if I were you.",
        "Gwen: And why's that?",
        "Iris: Well, the only reason that baby is here is because of me. And remember, in ninety days? I have to stand before the judge, raise my right hand and swear that you deserve to keep that baby.",
        "Gwen: If you say one word about me, I'll tell him what you did to Carly.",
        "Iris: I would never jeopardize my grandchild.",
        "Gwen: Then lay off Will.",
        "Iris: Sweetie, do you really think it's the best time in your life to start a relationship?",
        "Gwen: As if you know a lot about relationships.",
        "Iris: Well -- I know that I wouldn't get hooked up with someone who was crazy -- no matter what the doctors said. I mean, once a wacko -- whoo! Always a wacko.",
        "Gwen: I guess there's no hope for you then.",
        "Iris: You know, I'm not the one taking the wrong road here. I guess it's in your blood.",
        "Gwen: What do you mean by that?",
        "Iris: Nothing.",
        "Gwen: No, you're talking about my father.",
        "Iris: When have I ever spoken about your father?",
        "Gwen: Exactly. So why bring him up now?",
        "Iris: I guess just -- having a baby around reminds me.",
        "Gwen: I asked you about him at the court hearing -- you wouldn't tell me.",
        "Iris: Yeah, well, I didn't think it was smart bringing up your father's name in a court of law -- if you get my drift.",
        "Gwen: Wait, he was a criminal?",
        "Iris: Well, they couldn't really pin anything on him, as far as I knew. But -- didn't change what he was.",
        "Gwen: I'm listening.",
        "Iris: Do we have to do this now?",
        "Gwen: Yes. I want to know about my father. It's time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can't let you keep thinking that your life is over.",
        "Jennifer: No, but it's not over. I know that now. I mean, there -- I know that there has to be a reason for this. And maybe it's that I'm not supposed to have children.",
        "Paul: No. Jennifer, that's not it.",
        "Jennifer: All I'm saying is that there has to be some reason.",
        "Paul: There is. I'm the reason. I'm the reason that you lost your son.",
        "Emily: Paul!",
        "Paul: It's okay. It's -- really, it's okay. I have to tell her.",
        "Emily: I thought you would -- I thought you'd be asleep. I gave him a sleeping pill a little while ago.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, well, that explains it. I walked in here and he was talking to the mirror. He said he saw Craig's face.",
        "Paul: He was laughing -- because he won.",
        "Emily: You are not Craig. You are not Craig! You're a kind, loving man. You're just exhausted, honey.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah and I was trying to get him to go back to sleep.",
        "Paul: I can't do this anymore, you know? I can't. I had this terrible dream. Jennifer found out and she hated me.",
        "Jennifer: Hey -- no -- I could never hate you. I love you. Okay? Today at the cemetery -- I came over to thank you for being so good to me there. And also, to talk to you about maybe going back to work together. But, we can discuss that later, okay?",
        "Emily: Do you hear your sister? Listen to her, she's doing great. She's talking about going back to work. You need to go back to sleep, okay?",
        "Paul: No, I -- I'm just going to tell her.",
        "Emily: No, no. Jennifer, can you do me a favor and just go to the kitchen and get me a glass of water for him?",
        "Jennifer: Do you think maybe we should call a doctor?",
        "Emily: No, no, he's fine -- just the water, Jennifer, thank you. Sit. You need to listen to me. Listen to me. You cannot do this.",
        "Paul: I have to tell her.",
        "Emily: Not now. Not like this. Not when you're so upset.",
        "Paul: She thinks that her son is dead.",
        "Emily: It's okay. I mean, she's -- she's learning to live with it. Look at her -- she doing great. She's talking about going back to work, which means she's moving forward.",
        "Paul: No. This is wrong. He's her son.",
        "Emily: He's Craig's son. He did this.",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter anymore. I'm completely losing my mind.",
        "Emily: Listen, listen -- which is why you have to listen to me. You're okay -- you're exhausted, you're having a bad reaction to a sleeping pill, that's all. Please, just lay down. Try to lay down and get some sleep, okay?",
        "Jennifer: How's he doing?",
        "Emily: Much better, I think. Aren't you, Paul?",

        "Henry: What else did that sicko do to her?",
        "B.J.: Well, he's standing right here. Why don't you ask him yourself?",
        "Mike: We're going to go to the police. No way he gets away with this.",

        "Henry: Katie?",
        "Mike: She's fine. She doesn't need anything from you. I will deal with you tomorrow.",
        "Maddie: She wasn't wearing that when she got here. She was wearing that cheerleader's outfit.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know. Maddie.",
        "Maddie: He must've made her change. Oh! That is so out there.",
        "Henry: Her dress was all loose. She was crying. How could this happen?",
        "Maddie: Because we let it happen. You and me. We did this to her.",
        "Henry: No we didn't. This wasn't us. This was B.J. Green. What else did that sicko do to her?",

        "Paul: Jennifer, I'm really sorry. When you came in here, I was half-asleep. Can you imagine looking in the mirror and seeing Craig look back at you. Wow, it's just not right.",
        "Jennifer: And I didn't realize how much this was affecting you. You know, he was your nephew. It's all just so sad.",
        "Emily: You see, that's why we need to focus on the positive. All of us, we have each other. We have tomorrow. A fresh start, tomorrow.",

        "Iris: Ray, okay. His name was Ray Tenney. You satisfied?",
        "Gwen: Ray.",
        "Iris: Hey look. Don't get all soft and syrupy here, okay? He was as mean as they come. Especially when he was drinking.",
        "Gwen: I guess you guys had that in common then.",
        "Iris: You know what? I don't have to take this.",
        "Gwen: Look, I want to know about my father. What did he do for a living?",
        "Iris: What did he do for a living? You mean when he wasn't stealing out of my wallet? Why do you think I told Carly that she killed my baby boy? Do you think I enjoyed that? Walkin' around the woods the same day that I gave birth? By myself on a dirty, disgusting floor? I did it because I loved you. And I wanted better for you than that Ray Tenney and his little brat. So don't go thinking that there's some pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. Your father's a wrong turn that I took a long time ago. And I don't intend to do it again.",
        "Gwen: Where are you going?",
        "Iris: Out. Look, I fed the baby. He's gonna sleep for a couple hours. So, I'll be back by then.",
        "Gwen: I can take care of him.",

        "Gwen: Hey. Hey, what's the matter little guy? Oh, no, no, no. Come here. Come here. Don't cry. You just got fed. What's going on? You need a burp? Shh. It's okay, little guy. Come on.",

        "Emily: Paul, we destroyed evidence, hindered an investigation -- I mean, Hal would personally crucify us. And, at the very least, I would lose custody of my son, and you would lose Jennifer and Will -- and me. We would not survive the fallout. I cannot lose you. Not after everything we've been through.

        "Gwen: What was he like?",

        "Henry: So, hey man, you rent it for the weekend. You're a guy on the rebound, you know? Once the ladies find out that you're taking numbers, you're gonna be swamped. I tell you, I give you two weeks with Oakdale's lovelies and you're gonna be like, \"Katie who?\" You won't even notice that she's not around.",
