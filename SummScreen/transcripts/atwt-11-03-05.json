        "Paul: You sure you want to do this?",
        "Jennifer: Yep. I just need to get some materials, and we'll go back to your place and work. And I've already got ideas for the new line.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Jennifer: Really. Look I know I -- I'm sorry I scared you at the cemetery. I need to grieve, I need to remember, but that's not all there is. And it's time that I get back to what's left of my life.",
        "Paul: Well, that's good, I guess.",
        "Jennifer: You know, frankly, I was really more worried about you that night.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I probably shouldn't have taken Emily's sleeping pills.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I'm sorry that you felt like you had to.",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter. I'm great, you're great. Hey, we're incorporated.",
        "Jennifer: We are?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you said you wanted to start a new business, so I set it up.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that was fast.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I want to get out of here fast. You don't need these memories, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Well, they're not all bad. But it is time to go. So, what's our name gonna be?",
        "Paul: I don't know, I thought you'd come up with it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, we'll just figure it out later.",
        "Paul: Right. So, what are you here for? What do you want to get?",
        "Jennifer: There's not much. I have my sketchpads. And then, oh, I think there's a bag of swatches downstairs.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: There's some fabrics for spring.",
        "Paul: Well, I'll get it.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. I didn't think you would be here today.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, me neither. I haven't been here in a while.",
        "Jennifer: So you wouldn't run into me?",
        "Dusty: So I wouldn't miss you so much. I want to see you sometime. I think that this keeping a distance thing is a mistake.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I think we should be together.",

        "Will: It's the truth, right? You took money from my brother?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Will?",
        "Will: I'm an idiot.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: That's what you thought, right?",
        "Gwen: Don't.",
        "Will: You played me.",
        "Gwen: No, I was desperate. I needed the money, Paul offered.",
        "Will: So why couldn't you tell me? You showed me the money and I asked you, point blank, like I'm asking you now. And you just backed me off.",
        "Gwen: I didn't want to lie.",
        "Will: So why couldn't you tell me it was Paul?",
        "Gwen: Because I couldn't!",
        "Will: That's not good enough. What's the big secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Is Jessica coming from the courthouse or her office?",
        "Carly: Courthouse. I could've met her there, but I really hate that building right now.",
        "Jack: Hasn't been very good to us lately.",
        "Carly: And it's my fault. It's completely my fault.",
        "Jack: No, okay, don't start that again.",
        "Carly: Well, it's true, Jack. I didn't think about consequences. I just -- I wanted to keep the baby, I thought that Gwen would be a disaster for him, so I did whatever I could to get rid of her.",
        "Jack: Promise me that won't be your defense.",
        "Carly: Well, let's hope that Jessica can come up with a better way to say it.",
        "Jack: Yes, let's hope.",
        "Carly: I spoke with a real estate agent in Montana today, Jack. I think I can get fair market for the cabin and for the land --",
        "Jack: No, no, absolutely not.",
        "Carly: Jack, this is going to be very expensive, whether or not I end up going to trial.",
        "Jack: I don't want you worrying about the money.",
        "Carly: I'm just being realistic. Neither one of us has a paycheck coming in right now.",
        "Jack: No, not yet. My FBI contact thinks he's got a line on a job for me.",
        "Carly: All right, so then that'll just cover the monthly expenses.",
        "Jack: I don't want you worrying about that end of it. You just concentrate on your case, honey. On how you're going to beat the charges.",
        "Carly: Well, how am I gonna do it? How am I gonna erase what I did? And what'll we do if I can't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, my name is Lily Snyder. And I'm one of the owners of WOAK. I'm not here to talk to you as a businesswoman, today. I'm here to talk to you as a mother. My son is dying, and I need your help.",
        "Lily: My son, Luke, is 15 years old. And if he doesn't get a kidney, he will die. All of our immediate family have been tested and there is not one match. We are on the national registry. As many others, we hope and wait and pray. But unlike some of the people on that list, we don't have any time. This illness came on very quickly and if -- we need a donor. We are in desperate need of a donor. So please, I'm praying that there's someone, some wonderful person out there who is willing to help save someone's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We've got to take this step by step. Jess, she's got a good rapport with everyone in the court system, the D.A.'S office --",
        "Carly: You think I can get a deal?",
        "Jack: We can hope.",
        "Carly: Because I'll do whatever they want me to do. I'll do anything during the day, any kind of service, as long as I can go home to you and the kids at night.",
        "Jack: Honey, if you have to go away for a while -- listen, I don't want you to worry about us. We'll deal.",
        "Carly: Jack, of course I'll worry about you. Whatever happens to me, I deserve it. But not our children. Not you.",
        "Jack: We'll be okay. We're fine, honey. The kids, they're happy and healthy. We'll handle it.",
        "Carly: Have you seen Luke today?",
        "Jack: No, no, I was going to go over and get tested to see if I'm a possible match. I should probably head over now.",
        "Carly: All right, well, I'll meet you over there when I'm done with Jessica.",
        "Jack: Okay. See, it just goes to show you. There are worse problems in the world than ours.",
        "Carly: You're right about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Just a few weeks ago, Luke was a normal teenage boy. Playing ball, breaking curfew, groaning when you'd ask him to watch his little sisters -- and he can be that boy again. But we need your help. If you would even consider being a donor, please, go to Memorial Hospital and see if you're a match. Or call the number on your screen. Thank you.",
        "Floor manager: And we're out.",
        "Holden: Hey, you did great.",
        "Lily: I didn't want to cry. It just looks terrible, like some cheap ploy.",
        "Holden: No, no, it was good.",
        "Kim: Oh, you did a wonderful job, Lily.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Kim: Wonderful job.",
        "Lily: So much.",
        "Holden: I'll be right back. I'm going to call the hospital.",
        "Lily: Okay. Oh, I'm still shaking.",
        "Kim: Well, it didn't show at all. And he just tells me we're already getting calls.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's great news. I guess it pays to own a television station.",
        "Kim: Oh, now, don't start that again.",
        "Lily: I can't help it. I mean, I just want to help Luke so much, but there's other people out there that want to help their children, and they couldn't just call you up the way I did, so --",
        "Kim: Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute. How many fundraisers have you done for memorial just this year alone? You have spent your time and your money, helping people who needed help. And now you're the one who needs a leg up. So don't give it a second thought, okay?",
        "Lily: Thank you, thank you so much. Any word?",
        "Holden: Luke is still sleeping. Dr. Swan said that they're gonna set up a special line to take all calls that come in.",
        "Lily: Okay, we should get back to the hospital. Thank you again, so much.",
        "Kim: You're welcome, you're welcome. I'll call you as soon as we get any word about a match.",
        "Lily: Okay, thank you.",
        "Kim: And I'll pray.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You shoved the money in my face, and when I asked you about it, you told me that it was none of my business. You practically pushed me out the door.",
        "Gwen: Look, I didn't want you to ask again, because I didn't want to lie. And I figured that being mean was the only thing that would make you go.",
        "Will: Is that what you wanted?",
        "Gwen: Look, I wanted my baby, Will. And I needed a lawyer, and I needed money for that, and I would've promised anything. Look, all I was thinking about was my baby, and how I was going to go to court and convince that judge that I could be a good mother even --",
        "Will: You promised? So, what did you promise? This is Paul, right? You made a promise to Paul?",
        "Gwen: Look, can't we just pretend like it didn't happen and move on?",
        "Will: Wow, must be really bad.",
        "Gwen: He made me promise that I wouldn't tell you that he gave me the money.",
        "Will: And? There's definitely more.",
        "Gwen: I promised that after I won the case, I would take the baby and I would leave town. Without you.",
        "Will: You were going to leave and not tell me?",
        "Gwen: Look, I would've said anything to get the money.",
        "Will: Is this the money that Cass Winthrop is working off right now?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess. But I'm sure he's gonna want more from the baby's trust fund. But yes, that's why he took me back.",
        "Will: Paul's money.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: So this is still going on?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Will: You guess? Did it ever occur to you to tell Paul to take his deal and shove it?",
        "Gwen: Look, I didn't know things were going to work out this way. That stuff with Paul feels like forever ago. That was before that we --",
        "Will: Before we went to New York. And before you ended up here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: But after I stood up to my family, after I stood up and I said that I'd be the father. That wasn't enough for you?",
        "Gwen: No, it wasn't like that.",
        "Will: So what now, Gwen? What now? Are you just gonna string me along until the custody's final, and then you're gonna take the baby and leave and I'm never gonna see you again?",
        "Gwen: No, I would never do something like that.",
        "Will: Never, or just not right now? What am I supposed to believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, please.",
        "Dusty: Please what? Please don't tell the truth? Are you doing okay?",
        "Jennifer: I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Dusty: Why are you talking to me like I'm a stranger?",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to talk to you at all.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you turn around and say that?",
        "Jennifer: Look, I just came by to get some materials. Nothing from Street Jeans, just some personal things. My sketches.",
        "Dusty: You sure this is what you want? I mean, we built a great thing here. I mean, why not keep it? Why not just let it be about business.",
        "Jennifer: Because it isn't.",
        "Dusty: It can be. We'll start slow.",
        "Jennifer: Just as long as we start?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, why not?",
        "Jennifer: I'll be out of here in a minute. Do you have any idea how hard this is?",
        "Dusty: Seeing me? Or pretending you want me gone? Don't make everything between us about the baby.",
        "Jennifer: That's what it was.",
        "Dusty: It's more. And I'm not the only one who knows it.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, don't. Don't tell me what I know or what I feel.",
        "Dusty: It's more. It could be.",
        "Jennifer: Please, let me go. Just --",
        "Dusty: If you let it happen, it could.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, please, let me go.",
        "Paul: Get your hands off my sister.",
        "Dusty: This is between me and Jennifer.",
        "Paul: The hell it is.",
        "Jennifer: Paul --",
        "Dusty: It's not the day.",
        "Paul: My sister said, \"Let me go.\" Which one of those three words do you not understand?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, stop it, both of you, please. I don't want a fight.",
        "Dusty: There won't be.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I just -- I need to get my things and get out of here.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: I have to be out of here in ten minutes or I'll be late for my appointment with the counselor.",
        "Paul: Fine, why don't you go ahead? I'll bring your stuff home.",
        "Jennifer: No, I will wait for you. Just hurry up, okay?",
        "Dusty: You can obviously leave without any interference from me. I'm not gonna beat up your brother or anything. I don't want you to miss your appointment with your counselor, so go ahead.",
        "Paul: Why don't you go, I'm right behind you, I promise.",
        "Jennifer: I'll see you at home.",
        "Paul: Wow. That was beautiful. \"I'm not gonna beat him to a pulp, Jennifer, the way we both know I can, Jennifer, because I care about you, Jennifer.\"",
        "Dusty: That's right. Go to hell.",
        "Paul: She doesn't need you, Dusty. And she doesn't want you, either. Get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I know that sometimes it's hard to see the way that I feel, okay? But I'm -- I'm here. I'm with you. How could you even think that I would do something like that now?",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Gwen: Because we're --",
        "Will: We're what?",
        "Gwen: I thought you knew.",
        "Will: Gwen, as of right now, I don't know anything. There's a lot that you could do that would surprise me. You already have. So don't think -- why couldn't I believe that you wouldn't dump me and leave town?",
        "Gwen: Because I'm telling you right now.",
        "Will: Was that part of the deal? Dump Will, but don't tell him? How was that supposed to work?",
        "Gwen: No, not dump you, just leave.",
        "Will: But you wouldn't have done it?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: You're lying. Right now.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Don't even try it. I can tell you're lying. I can smell it on you.",
        "Gwen: Look, I wish I would've thrown the money in his face.",
        "Will: No, you don't, because it got you what you needed. And that's okay, I understand that. But don't tell me you wouldn't have dumped me. That's what showing me the money was all about in the first place. It was just a warm-up. You would've gotten the money, left town, and then, never seen me again.",
        "Gwen: Look, maybe, before. Okay, yeah, fine. I would've gone. I would've left and I would've never seen you again. But I did it because it was what was best for you, Will.",
        "Will: Best for me? You did this for my own good?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: Bet you didn't come up with that all on your own.",
        "Gwen: Paul said -- look, he was worried about you, Will. Look, who can blame him? Here I am, with a kid that's not even yours, bills I can't pay, even more problems. Any parent or brother in their right mind would want to split us up.",
        "Will: But why would you think it was for my own good? I was here, Gwen. Why wasn't that enough?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but in the long run, who can handle that kind of burden?",
        "Will: Let me guess, also not your words.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, maybe. Maybe that was Paul. But he was wrong, okay, about all of it.",
        "Will: What else?",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: All of it? What else did he say?",
        "Gwen: He just didn't want you to be stressed.",
        "Will: Yeah, because God forbid little Will cracks again. Well, here we are.",
        "Gwen: Where?",
        "Will: Where my family always ends up. Good bye.",
        "Gwen: No, Will, wait. Where are you going?",
        "Will: That's not your problem.",
        "Gwen: Look, you can blame me for lying, but you can't blame me for what your brother thinks.",
        "Will: You trusted him. You trusted him more than me.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Gwen, I took your side. When my best friend called you a liar, I believed you. When a hospital lab backed him up, I trusted you. Not what other people said. You.",
        "Gwen: No, I can do that.",
        "Will: When it counted, Gwen. When it was hard to believe.",
        "Gwen: No, listen, please. I can do that. >From now on, I promise. Will, please!",

        "Holden: Look at these. And five of them a-negative, so that means they could go all the way.",
        "Lily: You think they'll all come in? It's one thing to make a phone call, but to actually show up and be tested?",
        "Holden: If they don't, I will track them down.",
        "Jack: Hey. How'd things go at the station?",
        "Lily: Oh, I was a wreck, but we're getting phone calls.",

        "Dusty: Now you're gonna act like her brother? When she really needs you, you were nowhere to be seen.",
        "Paul: Oh, and you think you helped? Dusty, all you did was contribute to a delusion. You have no idea how much damage you've done. Now just let her heal.",

        "Carly: You don't need to apologize to me.",
        "Jennifer: No, but I do. Because it's important to me that you know. I realize how much I put you and Jack through when I took the baby.",
        "Carly: Well, I was pretty frightened there. But I understood. And I'm glad that you got the help that you need.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, well, that's still in the process. That's why I'm here today. But Carly, just so you know, it wasn't the drugs -- just the drugs that did it. I honestly believed that baby was mine.",
        "Carly: I know you did. And trust me, I am in no position to judge. I've done some pretty outrageous things myself, thinking that's what that baby needed, so -- and I know what it's like to lose a child.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I just hope Gwen takes care of him. And at least you know that he's alive.",
        "Carly: Yeah. He isn't the baby that I lost. Her name was Nora. She would've been nine last may. 15th of May.",
        "Jennifer: It never really goes away, does it?",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No. But it does get lighter. Bit by bit, it lifts so at least you can breathe again. And then one day, it becomes this feeling that's so familiar, you would miss it if it wasn't there. She's still a part of my life. She always will be. Mine is not the life that ended, even though for a while there, I thought that it did. And now, May 15th is a day that I mark, and there are other days similar. Parker's birthday, and Sage's, J.J.'s, and my husband's. And I'm lucky and grateful. And you will be, too. You have to believe that.",

        "Lily: He needs a transplant. He needs it now. That's what they said.",

        "Lily: So we just sit around, hope for a slow news day?",
        "Holden: No, we keep pushing. And we pray that somebody who's the perfect match comes into this hospital. What?",

Yeah, kind of like paying some guy to break you up with your fianc\u00e9e. Yeah, I know what Mom did to you. I'm not a kid anymore. So how could you go and do the same damn thing to me?",
