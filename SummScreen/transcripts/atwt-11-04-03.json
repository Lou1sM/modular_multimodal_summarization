        "Jack: But there was nothing to tell, Carly. We were just -- we -- we're\r\n\r\nfriends.\r\n",
        "Carly: Friends. Then how friendly are you Jack? As friendly as we are?\r\n\r\nAs friendly as, let's say, you and Nancy Hughes?\r\n",
        "Jack: I can honestly say that Nancy Hughes and I are better friends \r\nthan \r\nMitzi --\r\n",
        "Carly: Apparently Mitzi knows you well enough to have dropped by here\r\n\r\nbefore. Did she come with Rose or were the two of you alone?\r\n",
        "Jack: Nothing happened, okay? Nothing. You believe me, right? \r\nYou're -- no -- you're not jealous. You're just jerking my chain, isn't that it?\r\n",
