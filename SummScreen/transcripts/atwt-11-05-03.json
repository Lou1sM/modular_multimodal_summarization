        "Hal: As of today, your visitation rights with Will are suspended. ",
        "\r\nBarbara: You can't do that. You have to have a court order. ",
        "\r\nHal: You're right. It's a restraining order. Read it over, Barbara. You come \r\nwithin 100 feet of Will and you're going to jail. ",
        "\r\nBarbara: I'm not gonna let you do this, Hal. He is my son. ",
        "\r\nHal: And that's a privilege that you've abused once too often. Having Will lie \r\nabout spray painting Paul\u2019s apartment -- that was one of the worst things you've \r\never done and you've got a hell of a record to beat, Barbara. ",
        "\r\nBarbara: I thought that maybe it would knock some sense into Paul. I know it was \r\nwrong, I -- honey? Did you get your bike all packed up? ",
        "\r\nWill: Uh, what's going on? ",
        "\r\nHal: Why don't you just go wait in the car, son? Everything's fine. ",
        "\r\nBarbara: Tell him, Hal. You put such a premium on honesty. Why don't you be \r\nhonest with your son? ",
        "\r\nHal: I've decided that from now on, we'd all be better off -- ",
        "\r\nBarbara: He's trying to keep me away from you, Will. ",
        "\r\nWill: Dad, you can't do that. ",
        "\r\nHal: That is hardly the whole story. ",
        "\r\nWill: It doesn't matter. Mom needs me and I need her. And nothing you can do can \r\nchange that. ",

        "\r\nJohn: Where's Rosanna? I wanted to talk to her, too. ",
        "\r\nCraig: She's busy. Now, is something wrong? You said everything was fine with \r\nCabot. ",
        "\r\nJohn: Listen. Cabot's health is just fine. Hello, Cabot. Are they treating you \r\nwell out there at Fairwinds? ",
        "\r\nCraig: Yeah, John -- ",
        "\r\nJohn: I had serious concerns about Cabot\u2019s health records that you gave me. And \r\nI couldn't let it rest, you see, so -- oh, I'm sorry. I'm due in O.R. ",
        "\r\nCraig: John? John, what have you done? ",
        "\r\nJohn: Don't run off. I want to discuss this with you when I get back. But I want \r\nto talk to Rosanna as well, see if you can -- ",
        "\r\nCraig: John, what is going on? ",
        "\r\nJohn: All I can tell you is that Cabot\u2019s adoption may be at risk. ",

        "\r\nPaul: Candles. Flowers. No place like a church to -- okay, what's wrong? ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Nothing is wrong. I am -- I am waiting for a moment of creative \r\ninspiration. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Oh. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Yes. ",
        "\r\nPaul: How long's that gonna take? 'Cause I don't want my flowers to wilt. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Well, you can't rush these things. You want to prove to Rose that \r\nyou're committed to her, yes? ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yes. Absolutely. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: All right, well, then, these things have to be done right. ",
        "\r\nPaul: You don't like my idea? ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Well, decorating a church with roses and candles is very romantic, but \r\nit's the execution. Ah, yes, I think -- now, you see, you take the roses, you \r\nput them up the aisle. And then you put the candles at the altar in a shape of a \r\nheart. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Oh, that's very good. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Classy but kitschy but cute, she'll like it. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Yes. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Hearts and flowers is not very original, but I think it works. ",
        "\r\nPaul: If there's a God, it will work. Pray Rose still wants to marry me. ",

        "\r\nJennifer: Oh, good. Uh, could you tell him to call me? ",
        "\r\nMolly: You see, that's the problem. When Dusty and I get together, we don't talk \r\nabout other people. In fact, we don't do much talking at all. ",

        "\r\nDusty: Hey, there. I've been thinking about you. ",

        "\r\nDusty: No, I just meant I\u2019ve been -- ",
        "\r\nRose: Yeah, I don't care what you meant. Any thinking you should be doing right \r\nnow is about my wedding present. ",

        "\r\nRose: I just -- I was reading the paper about this woman, and it was a really \r\nsad story. ",

        "",
        "\r\nHal: Okay. Okay, here is what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna make a scene. \r\nWe're not gonna raise our voices. We're not gonna make ugly accusations about \r\neach other or anybody else. Is that understood? ",
        "\r\nBarbara: Did you get a court order for that, too, Hal? ",
        "\r\nWill: What court order? Something against mom? ",
        "\r\nHal: Yes, son. It's called a restraining order. ",

        "\r\nRosanna: No, you spoke in haste. That happens to everyone -- ",
        "\r\nPaul: I didn't just speak in haste, you know? When Rose uncovered what Barbara \r\nhad done to drive the two of us apart, I went off on Rose like -- like she had \r\ndone it and not Barbara. Rose was just trying to stand up for me and I totally \r\nattacked her. And I don't know why I did that, I mean, Rose is the one person in \r\nthis whole world who can fix everything that's wrong with my life. ",

        "\r\nHal: It's okay. Keeping your mother honest isn't your job. Or mine, either. But \r\nsomething had to be done, Will. That's why I -- I took out that restraining \r\norder. ",
