        "\r\nAlison: And, Mike? If there's anything -- anything I can ever do for you -- ",
        "\r\nMike: Thanks, Alison. ",
        "\r\nAlison: No, but it was totally my fault. If I hadn't tricked you into staying \r\nwith Katie that night, you wouldn't have even been on the road at all. And that \r\nmaniac wouldn't have mowed you down and left you for dead. ",
        "\r\nKatie: It's not your fault, Alison. ",
        "\r\nAlison: No, but it was! I wanted to be with Chris that night, and I just wasn't \r\nthinking. And I put you guys in danger, and I'll never forgive myself. ",
        "\r\nMike: Did you and Chris at least have a good time that night? ",
        "\r\nAlison: Yeah, yeah. It was great, but -- ",
        "\r\nMike: Alison, look, accidents happen. All right? As far as I'm concerned, the \r\nless said about that night, the better. ",
        "\r\nAlison: Thank you, Mike. You're the best. ",
        "\r\nNurse: Look who's early for his appointment. ",

        "\r\nKatie: And now that it's coming off, we should celebrate. ",
        "\r\nMike: And I know exactly how we're gonna do it. Nerf basketball. A little \r\none-on-one, you know? And I'm telling you, I\u2019m not gonna be nice to you any \r\nmore. I'm through with that. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Oh, so bring it on. ",
        "\r\nMike: Listen to you, you little trash talker. ",
        "\r\nKatie: You're gonna choke, buddy. Oh, and you know what? While you're at it, you \r\nshould ask that doctor to give you a better hook shot. What? ",
        "\r\nAlison: So? So what's going on with you two? ",
        "\r\nKatie: Well, we're finally friends again. ",
        "\r\nAlison: I wish I could have a do-over for that night. Because I would be smart, \r\nyou know? I'd have some self-control, some, I don't know -- some maturity. But \r\nthe way that things are going now, I -- ",
        "\r\nKatie: Oh, Alison, that's okay. Hey, Chris. ",
        "\r\nChris: Hey, Katie. How you doing? ",
        "\r\nKatie: I'm actually doing really well. What's going on? ",
        "\r\nChris: I've actually got a meeting with John Dixon. Not exactly someone you want \r\nto keep waiting. ",
        "\r\nKatie: No. ",

        "\r\nBonnie: Did you get a chance to talk to Sarah last night? ",
        "\r\nJessica: Yeah, I did. But we'll talk about that later. Tom, I want to get this \r\nover with as soon as possible so Bonnie doesn't have to spend another second in \r\nthat holding cell. Can you tell me why she hasn't been arraigned yet? ",
        "\r\nTom: Yes, I didn't want to move forward without first discussing Bonnie\u2019s plea \r\nwith you. ",
        "\r\nJessica: Plea? What plea? She's not pleading to anything. ",
        "\r\nBonnie: I'm pleading guilty, Mom. To manslaughter. ",
        "\r\nJessica: The hell you are! ",
        "\r\nBonnie: Look, Mom, I killed a man. And I have to take responsibility for that. \r\nAnd there is nothing you can do to stop me. ",

        "\r\nDusty: Rose! Rose -- you gotta listen to me, now. If you marry him, if you go \r\nthrough with this, your life -- it's gonna be over. You hear me? Rose -- wait -- \r\nwhoa, whoa, whoa -- wait! Rose, come back! ",

        "\r\nPaul: Anyone I know? ",
        "\r\nRose: I might have a buyer for the Roller Palace! ",
        "\r\nPaul: Oh, that's great. That's just great. ",
        "\r\nRose: Isn't that great? I can sell the place and we can just get started on our \r\nlife together. I gotta go. I gotta, like, clean the shop. And you can meet with \r\nyour financial analyst. And maybe we'll both be really rich by the end of the \r\nday. Love you. Hey, here -- look at the flowers. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Oh, come on -- ",
        "\r\nRose: Pick out something nice, would you? Something nice. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Sure, I\u2019ll try. ",
        "\r\nRose: Nice, colorful. ",
        "\r\nMolly: I've been a lot of things, but never a financial analyst. ",
        "\r\nPaul: What do you need, Molly? Why -- why all the secrecy? ",
        "\r\nMolly: It's about Rose. Every time I think I\u2019m getting somewhere with Dusty, \r\nyour fianc\u00e9e gets in the way. And I don't know if you've seen the two of them in \r\na room together, alone -- but it's like nobody else exists. ",
        "\r\nPaul: All right, look, I don't have a lot of time. You got something to say, say \r\nit. ",
        "\r\nMolly: I saw them together, Paul. And it's not over between them. No matter what \r\nthey keep telling themselves or us. ",
        "\r\nMolly: Dusty and I were planning to have this great afternoon rendezvous and \r\neverything, but while he was waiting for me, he suddenly comes up with this \r\nridiculous reason for me to be at the club longer. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Right, so what? ",
        "\r\nMolly: So what? In his spare time, he turned on the charm with your fianc\u00e9e. And \r\nthen by the time I got there -- ",
        "\r\nPaul: What? Could you hear what they were saying? ",
        "\r\nMolly: No. Not exactly. I mean, I wasn't close enough to hear exactly what they \r\nwere saying, but it didn't matter because the look was on their faces. I mean, \r\nshe is definitely still under his skin, Paul. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Did you talk to Dusty about any of this? ",
        "\r\nMolly: No, he would've just denied it. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Why are you bringing this to me? ",
        "\r\nMolly: Because I think you should know that while you're busy sending out \r\ninvitations, Rose is busy reconnecting with Dusty behind your back. It's not \r\nover. She's always gonna be a part of him. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Molly, I'm really sorry that whatever it is you have with Dusty is going \r\ndown the drain, again. But Rose is committed to me. ",
        "\r\nMolly: Fine. Whatever. Okay, I don't know Rose, Paul. And I'm not speaking for \r\nRose. But I do know Dusty. And I do know that if you don't do something about \r\nhim, something definitive, he's always gonna be a threat. See, I don't know what \r\nkind of ceremony you're planning, but I sure hope your deposits are refundable.\r\n",

        "\r\nMitzi: He's a great guy. ",

        "\r\nChris: And as for you -- I shouldn't have lost it like that. And now that I\u2019ve \r\nrecovered from my temporary insanity, I wanted to apologize for jumping to \r\nconclusions. I know that you would never be with Alison. So we cool? ",
