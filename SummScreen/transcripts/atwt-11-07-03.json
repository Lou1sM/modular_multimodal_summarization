        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: Mr. Snyder? ",
        "\r\nHolden: Hi. Thanks for agreeing to meet my son. ",
        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: Mm-hmm. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Aaron, this is Mr. Kottcamp, the golf manager at the Country Club. ",
        "\r\nAaron: How are you? ",
        "\r\nHolden: Coffee? ",
        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: No, thanks, I\u2019m a little busy. Let me tell you what I need. I'm \r\nlooking for someone who's ambitious, must learn every facet of the job from \r\nmanaging the greens to massaging the egos. You wouldn't believe how upset some \r\nof these CEOs get when they're over par. So, does that sound like something \r\nyou'd be interested in? ",
        "\r\nAaron: How much does the job pay? ",
        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: Well, you'll start out at minimum wage. But if you work hard, you \r\ncan aim for executive assistant. It might take a few years, but it pays between \r\n$50,000 and $60,000 as long as you're willing to work your tail off. ",
        "\r\nAaron: Look, Mr. Kottcamp, I have to be honest. I was looking for something that \r\npays a little bit higher. But thank you very much for the offer. ",

        "\r\nKatie: -- Is ringing. ",
        "\r\nMike: I'll get it. ",
        "\r\nKatie: No, no. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'll get it. Hello? Rosanna, hi. Cabot's \r\ngetting christened today? Now? No, no, don't feel the need to apologize for my \r\nbrother. Craig is always too busy to call me. Luckily I have an amazing \r\nsister-in-law. Absolutely. Cabot, my nephew -- ",
        "\r\nMike: Is getting christened, I heard. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Oh, man. And I don't even have time to buy him anything. I guess I should \r\njust get going. ",
        "\r\nMike: All right, help me up. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Ow, this arm. ",
        "\r\nMike: All right. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Are you sure you'll be all right by yourself? ",
        "\r\nMike: Don't I look all right? ",
        "\r\nKatie: You look -- great. ",
        "\r\nMike: I feel great. Better than I have in a long time. Go. ",
        "\r\nKatie: Okay, here -- okay. On the other hand, you could probably use some \r\npractice with those crutches. You want to meet my new nephew? ",

        "\r\nStranger: Do you know why I\u2019m here? ",
        "\r\nBarbara: Because I asked James to help me. He said he would send someone. ",
        "\r\nStranger: Who do you need help with? ",
        "\r\nBarbara: Someone who has been causing my family a great deal of pain. ",

        "\r\nRose: Ah, it's not what you think. ",
        "\r\nDusty: How did you get in here? I don't recall giving you a key. ",
        "\r\nPaul: I used to live here, Dusty. I did manage to make a few friends. Someone \r\ndid me a favor. ",
        "\r\nDusty: To do what? Ambush your girlfriend? ",
        "\r\nRose: See, Dusty knows that Molly told you about us. We were just trying to \r\nfigure out how to deal with this -- it's not coming out right at all. ",
        "\r\nPaul: Rose, listen -- ",
        "\r\nRose: We were out in the hallway talking about it. We didn't think it was right. \r\nWe came in here. All we were going to do is talk. There is nothing else -- ",
        "\r\nPaul: No, there's a lot going on here! But you know what? It stops now! Let's \r\njust bury the hatchet. ",
        "\r\nDusty: What are you talking about, Paul? ",
        "\r\nPaul: I'm talking about the three of us being friends again. ",

        "\r\nRosanna: Oh, sorry. Can you believe this? When I came back to town, I -- I \r\ndidn't have a love life or any family to speak of. ",
        "\r\nCarly: Not that you were speaking to, anyway. ",
        "\r\n[Rosanna laughs] ",
        "\r\nRosanna: And look at me now. I ripped my hem, my sister's rushing to my rescue.\r\n",
        "\r\nCarly: Right. Well, let that be a lesson to you. Always carry a needle and \r\nthread in your purse. All set, good as new. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Thank you so much. ",
        "\r\nCarly: You're welcome. ",
        "\r\nCraig: And thanks to you, too, Jack. You know, a lesser man might have held a \r\ngrudge. But, Jack, you can't even spell \"grudge.\" ",
        "\r\n[Laughter] thank you for agreeing to be Cabot\u2019s godfather. And, Carly, I want to \r\nthank you for being godmother, too. It's just -- it's just a wonderful day, huh?\r\n",
        "\r\nRosanna: Yeah. I can't wait to go home and make a big bowl of popcorn and watch \r\nevery minute of it. You brought the video camera, didn't you? ",
        "\r\nCraig: It's in the car. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Oh, honey, the minister's gonna start any second. You have to go get \r\nit. ",
        "\r\nCraig: Okay, all right. ",
        "\r\nJack: Here, I\u2019ll take him. ",

        "\r\nCraig: I'll be right back. ",
        "\r\nRosanna: Okay, thank you. ",
        "\r\nCarly: For a guy who said he didn't want to be a father again -- ",
        "\r\nRosanna: I know, can you believe it? The minute he held Cabot, all that talk \r\nabout being too old or too tired or whatever just completely disappeared. How \r\ncan I be this happy? Sometimes I worry that it's all a dream. ",
        "\r\nCarly: No, it isn't. It's very real. Those Montgomery boys are here to stay -- \r\nfather and son both. ",

        "\r\nCraig: Miss Fettle? ",

        "\r\nCraig: I don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "\r\nAnnabelle: The hell you don't, pop. You better help me duck the long arm of the \r\nlaw or get ready to say good-bye to your precious son. ",
        "",
        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: Minimum wage is standard for an entry-level job here. If you're \r\nnot willing to work your way up, I can find someone who is. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Aaron, it's just until you prove yourself, okay? Mr. Kottcamp is giving \r\nyou a wonderful opportunity here. Don't throw it away. ",
        "\r\nAaron: Look, I really appreciate the offer, but I just can't wait years to make \r\nreal money. ",
        "\r\nHolden: Why not? Look, you don't have a mortgage, all right? You can still live \r\nwith Lily and me -- ",
        "\r\nAaron: Yeah, and lose Lucy. Because that's what working at the Country Club and \r\nliving -- living with you guys, that's what it's gonna mean. She's running off \r\nto college and I'm gonna be running off after golf balls. Come on, I\u2019m sorry, I \r\njust don't want that. ",
        "\r\nMr. Kottcamp: Well, in that case, good luck to you, son. No hard feelings. ",
        "\r\nHolden: I appreciate it. Did I just hear right? You're basing your future on \r\nwhat Lucy is going to do? ",
        "\r\nAaron: Yeah. What's the problem? ",
        "\r\nHolden: The problem is your life can't revolve around one girl. You have your \r\nfuture that you have to think about here. ",
        "\r\nAaron: I am. Look, you wanted me to meet Mr. Kottcamp, and I did. He offered me \r\nminimum wage, and I'm not interested. End of story. ",

        "\r\nMike: Well, I want to go with you, too, but Craig and I don't exactly get along.\r\n",
        "\r\nKatie: Oh, please. If the guest list included only people Craig got along with, \r\nhe and Cabot would be the only ones there. He drives everyone crazy, including \r\nRosanna. ",

        "\r\nKatie: What do you mean you don't know? Are you kidding? She was your first \r\nmajor major. And even after all the heartache, you guys are good friends now, \r\nright? It's a good ending. ",
