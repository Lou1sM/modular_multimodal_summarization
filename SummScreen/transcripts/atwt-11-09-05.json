        "Gwen goes to see Carly to thank her for giving her a heads up on what Iris did to Will. However, when Gwen asks her why she did such horrible things to her \u0096 such as switching the paternity results, Carly doesn't know what she is talking about. Gwen is unsure, but is angered when Carly puts everyone on the spot when Margo and Casey come by, to prove no one in his family would do such a thing. Will later listens to Gwen's story about what Carly did. Will surprisingly tells Gwen that maybe Carly was trying to help. Why would she do something that would only infuriate Gwen further? Gwen wonders if she should give Carly a break? She is even more amazed when Will gives her a hefty amount of money for a deposit on an apartment, as Iris listens in. Will meets up with Barbara and tells her he is putting his college search on hold. Barbara is incensed, and even more so when she finds out it is because he wants to help out Gwen. Barbara throws out some insults, threats and promises of getting access to his trust fund again if he sees things her way. Nothing will deter Will from being with Gwen and Billy. Jack asks Henry to spy on BJ to find out his daily routine; Henry's interests are piqued when he hears it is undercover FBI work. Henry is unsure, but Jack eggs him on \u0096 do it for Katie. However, Henry turns a surprised Jack down. Later Henry is at WOAK and he hears BJ's voice and hides, and overhears a shocking proposal BJ makes regarding disposing of someone, to a scruffy mysterious stranger. Maddie tries to subtly warn Mike about BJ whom she sees as a psycho. Henry is only working for BJ to help put her through college. Mike is frustrated with both of them, and tells her that Henry is on his own after the danger he put Katie in. Dusty runs into Jen as he is wheeling the breakfast tray out, obviously set for two. They share awkward conversation. Later, Jen bumps into Meg, who has an overnight bag, on her way to see Dusty. She tells a guilt ridden Meg thanks for all her help. Dusty goes looking for Jen right after this and tells her that Meg will be staying with him from time to time. Jen guessed that, but why is he telling her this?"

        "Barbara: Hey! Thanks for meeting me. Oh, boy, is it good to see you.",
        "Will: So, what did you want to see me about?",
        "Barbara: I bet you haven't eaten yet. Let's go in and have some breakfast, all right?",
        "Will: I don't really have much time. You said this was important.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. A little bird told me that you and Jennifer are going off college shopping.",
        "Will: Yeah. Mom, about that --",
        "Barbara: I know, I know, I should be very hurt that you didn't invite me along. And actually, I may be a little bit hurt, but it's all right because I forgive you. I think it's really important that you and your sister spend some time together. You both have been through so much these last months. This trip will do you wonders.",
        "Will: Mom, I --",
        "Barbara: And so, I have some bulletins. I have some things I want you to look at. Some really, really great schools that are here. Excellent choices. I know you have some ideas of your own, but I want you to keep an open mind. Not everybody has to go to Harvard, you know.",
        "Will: Mom, I'm not going to Harvard. I'm not even going on the trip. I changed my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Gwen? Hi. What -- what are you doing here? Is something wrong?",
        "Gwen: No. And don't worry, it's a peaceful visit. I just -- I came to thank you.",
        "Carly: For what?",
        "Gwen: For telling me what my mom did to Will.",
        "Carly: Ah. You're welcome. Did it help?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. We talked about it. We're back together.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. That's good. I'm glad.",
        "Gwen: Can I ask you something?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure. Would you like to come in?",
        "Gwen: Why'd you do it?",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, because I think that iris has messed up our lives enough, don't you?",
        "Gwen: And that's it?",
        "Carly: Yeah. What -- what are you getting at?",
        "Gwen: If you're feeling like maybe I owe you one now or --",
        "Carly: Oh. No, Gwen, I didn't do it thinking you would drop the charges against me. Not that I don't hope that you change your mind about that. But I didn't do anything trying to win points with you.",
        "Gwen: Because it wouldn't be that easy.",
        "Carly: Right. Right, of course. So I guess this means that you're going to go ahead and press those charges then.",
        "Gwen: Look, I can't just forget what you did to me, Carly. You made up those horrible things to make me look bad to that judge. You drugged me, for crying out loud.",
        "Carly: I know. I know and I'm sorry. All I can say in my defense is that I was in a complete panic. I couldn't think clearly at all.",
        "Gwen: And you even switched the paternity test results so it looked like I was lying.",
        "Carly: Wait, what? What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: Don't act like you don't know what I mean. You changed the results so Casey wouldn't show up as the baby's father.",
        "Carly: No I didn't.",
        "Gwen: What, you're going to start denying everything now?",
        "Carly: No, not everything. But that one thing, yeah. I didn't change any test results. I swear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Listen, you want to take a ride with me before you hit your books?",
        "Casey: Where to?",
        "Margo: Just over to Carly and Jack's. I picked up some stuff for them and the kids, and I really need somebody to help me unload it, okay?",
        "Casey: Carly's got you doing her shopping now?",
        "Margo: I'm just trying to be nice. Remember what nice is? I just picked up some stuff from the bakery, and some toys for the kids. And, I don't know, they're going through a really rough time. Jack just lost his job, and I'm sure that Carly's upset about, you know --",
        "Casey: Gwen getting the baby back. Yeah, I bet she is.",
        "Margo: Yes. So we're going to be neighborly and do the nice thing, help out. What's wrong with that?",
        "Casey: Nothing, Mom. You're a saint.",
        "Margo: Actually, I haven't been canonized yet, so are you going to help me out with this?",
        "Casey: Do I have a choice?",
        "Margo: No, you don't. Let's go.",
        "Casey: Okay.",

        "Jack: Hey, Coleman. How you doing?",
        "Henry: Hey! Hey, Jack!",
        "Jack: Whoa, take it easy. It's just me.",
        "Henry: You snuck up on me there.",
        "Jack: Yeah. What's got you all panicky?",
        "Henry: Oh. I'm not panicky. No, I'm cool as -- cool as November there. Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, can I have a double mocha latte with a shot of espresso and some cayenne pepper, please?",
        "Jack: You sure you don't want to make that a decaf? [Henry laughs] Can I have a regular coffee? So, how are you doing, Henry?",
        "Henry: I'm great. I'm doing good. I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Jack: It's just an innocent question.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, Jack. I'm a little edgy. I haven't been sleeping well.",
        "Jack: Oh, bad dreams?",
        "Henry: No, no. I don't have time for dreams, actually. My job is pretty much 24/7. But I -- I -- I'm not complaining. The pay is amazing.",
        "Jack: Yes, I see. So, would that mean that you wouldn't have time for extra work?",
        "Henry: Uh, extra work? What do you mean extra -- like law enforcement kind of work?",
        "Jack: Not -- not exactly.",
        "Henry: When you say \"not exactly,\" what do you mean exactly?",
        "Jack: It's a little more covert than your straight-up police work.",
        "Henry: FBI?",
        "Jack: Let's just say that I would be doing a friend of mine a lot of help in Washington. So would you.",
        "Henry: Well, if you're talking about some James Bond sort of thing, I am totally listening.",
        "Jack: I need you to get some information about your boss, B.J. Green.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Maddie, get to the point. What is it you think I need to know to protect Katie? Is it something to do with B.J.?",
        "Maddie: There's a lot about the guy that you don't know, all right? Katie caught a glimpse of it the other night. And Henry -- well, Henry just sometimes sees what he wants to see. You know what I mean?",
        "Mike: Yeah. What does that have to do with B.J.?",
        "Maddie: Look, I know that you don't really like me. Frankly, I'm not really that crazy about you. And I'm still on the fence with Katie. But anyway, Henry is my brother and I love him. And the only reason that he is working for B.J. is to get me through college and to get us a place to live. And that's cool. But I'm just worried that he's going to get caught up in something that's really bad.",
        "Mike: Okay, why would you think that might happen?",
        "Maddie: Because B.J.'s not only a creep, he is a mean creep. And he's dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: I don't care! All right? I don't care if the whole team has to pull an all-nighter. I want the main titles the way I want them, or another company's going to get the job. Are we clear?",
        "Maddie: Great. I got to go. I don't want him seeing me with you.",
        "Mike: No, no, Maddie. Maddie, wait.",
        "B.J.: And I want the music cleared by this afternoon. I don't care what it costs. And get me an update on Katie's publicity tour an hour ago. I need that, thank you.",
        "Mike: What part of \"Katie's off limits\" don't you get?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Even the decadent ones. I have to get in gear. I have a busy day.",
        "Dusty: Does it have to be an early day?",
        "Meg: Unfortunately, yes. I want to stop by and check in on Luke before I start work.",
        "Dusty: How's he doing after his surgery?",
        "Meg: So far, so good.",
        "Dusty: Talk about last minute luck, huh?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. It was a miracle that kidney come through when it did.",
        "Dusty: I stopped believing in miracles lately. Glad there are a few out there.",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know, I have to drop by the farm and change my clothes first. I don't want to go by work with yesterday's clothes on. People will talk.",
        "Dusty: Scared of a little gossip? Can I see you later?",
        "Meg: Well, I was counting on it.",
        "Dusty: Come back later and bring a toothbrush.",
        "Meg: Oh, like a sleepover?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Pack a bag.",
        "Meg: Are you feeling okay?",
        "Dusty: I'm feeling great. The best I have in awhile.",
        "Meg: Yeah, me too. Okay, I have to get going.",
        "Dusty: I'll see you later.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'll put on a shirt. You want to come in?",
        "Jennifer: No. No, thanks.",
        "Dusty: I'll be right back. How are you?",
        "Jennifer: I'm all right. One day at a time, you know?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Jennifer: I went to the cemetery this morning, early. I just sat by his grave for a little while.",
        "Dusty: How'd that go?",
        "Jennifer: It was peaceful, actually. Saying good-bye.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's good to be able to do that.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. And letting things go.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you keep saying that.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, is it just me, or is this just unbearably awkward?",
        "Dusty: Well, we both live here. So I guess we gotta get used to the fact that we're probably going to run into each other.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, probably.",
        "Dusty: Unless you want me to relocate.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that would be a little extreme, don't you think?",
        "Dusty: I was hoping you'd say that. Well, I'll see you.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: You're really overreacting. I promise you, I plan to stick to my word that I'm going to keep things professional as far as Katie's concerned. You, on the other hand, seem to want to make everything personal.",
        "Mike: I love Katie. It doesn't get any more personal than that.",
        "B.J.: Well, I'd hate to think that the only reason you stayed on this job was to keep an eye on me.",
        "Mike: I couldn't care less what you think.",
        "B.J.: Look, I made a mistake. Okay? I took things a little too far on Halloween. I've admitted to that. I have apologized for that! Now, can we move on? Hmm? Thank you.",
        "Maddie: See what I mean? He's Jekyll and Hyde.",
        "Mike: He is a coward with a lot of money, that's all.",
        "Maddie: No, you're wrong. I think his bark is as bad as his bite. Listen, you don't know what I saw him do the other night. It was right after you --",
        "Mike: I know everything I need to know about B.J. Green, okay? He is not going to mess with me. And I can assure you he's not going to hurt Katie.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, okay, but what about Henry? Who's going to protect him?",
        "Mike: He's a grown man. He can take care of himself.",
        "Maddie: Can he? I think he's in way over his head this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All you have to do is find out information about his daily routine. That's it. Who he meets with, who he talks to, where he travels to, organizations that he has regular contact with. That kind of stuff.",
        "Henry: In other words, you want me to spy on my boss.",
        "Jack: That's a problem for you?",
        "Henry: Well, golly, Jack, a little bit. You know, he's the guy that signs my paychecks.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Henry. Tell me you haven't felt a little suspicious of the guy ever since you started working for him.",
        "Henry: Well --",
        "Jack: Tell me you haven't wondered if he was on the up and up. Now's your chance to find out, once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: It's not like I'm not going to college. I'm just postponing the search for a little while. It's no big deal.",
        "Barbara: Why? What happened? Did you have a fight with your sister?",
        "Will: No, of course, nothing like that. Mom, please, let it go.",
        "Barbara: Have you even told her about this?",
        "Will: Yes, actually I just called her. She's going to understand.",
        "Barbara: Okay, here's what I understand -- this is more than about changing your mind. Something has happened to make you want to stay here.",
        "Will: Okay, fine! It's Gwen.",
        "Barbara: Gwen?",
        "Will: That's why I'm staying.",
        "Barbara: Gwen? I thought that was over. How has she roped you back in?",
        "Will: She hasn't roped me back in, Mom. I'm just giving her a hand. Her mother's useless and she needs someone to help her take care of the baby.",
        "Barbara: And why does that someone have to be you?",
        "Will: Because I want it to be. I want to help her out. I care.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Will. For Pete's sake, open your eyes, would you? She's using you. Can't you see that?",
        "Will: See? This is why I didn't want to tell you in the first place. Because you'll never understand.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I understand. I understand completely. I know you. And I know what a good person you are. And I know how caring you are. Too caring. And she is using that to her advantage to get herself out of a jam.",
        "Will: Yes, she's in jam. Okay? And I'm her friend. And that's what friends do, they help each other out.",
        "Barbara: So, you're going to throw your life away? Throw your future away on this little tramp?",
        "Will: Stop right there.",
        "Barbara: You know what? She should be having the father of her baby help her out with this.",
        "Will: The father is a jerk.",
        "Barbara: A jerk? A jerk. Okay, fine. But that's who she should be going to about this. Let him start being a man, so you can stop being a fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Gwen, why do you think someone messed with the paternity test results?",
        "Gwen: Because Casey Hughes is the father of my kid.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. What do you want to accomplish singing that old song?",
        "Gwen: Nothing. I've got my baby back, so why would I need to lie about it? Look, I have only slept with one guy, and that was Casey Hughes. So, unless there are three wise men on their way to Oakdale with a bunch of gifts, then Casey is my kid's father.",
        "Carly: Well, the tests proved that he isn't.",
        "Gwen: Well that's why I know somebody messed with it. And you had every reason to do it.",
        "Carly: But I didn't.",
        "Gwen: Okay, then who switched them?",
        "Carly: How should I know that, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Okay, maybe Casey got his parents do it. Or his grandfather.",
        "Carly: Bob Hughes switched the results? That's highly unlikely.",
        "Gwen: You swear to me it wasn't you?",
        "Carly: I swear to you it wasn't me.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Margo: Hey, hi.",
        "Carly: Hi, Margo. Hi, Casey.",
        "Margo: I got some stuff for you and the kids. Is this a bad time?",
        "Carly: Um, I'm just sort of in the middle of something.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm sorry. You know, I should've called. You know, I'm going to dump this off in the room and I'll get out of your hair.",
        "Gwen: Hello, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Casey: Oh, great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: So -- so, what? Are you just gonna let him hang out, twisting in the wind? Thanks a lot.",
        "Mike: Hey, you both knew what B.J. was trying to do to Katie, all right? But you didn't say anything about it so Henry could keep his nice, cushy, little job.",
        "Maddie: We didn't say anything because the psycho threatened me.",
        "Mike: Well, take your suspicions to the cops, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Don't you even care that Henry could be in real trouble? You're supposed to be your friend, Mike.",
        "Mike: Yeah, that's what I thought, until he let B.J. Put his hands all over Katie. I'm done with him. Okay? He's on his own. So are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Jack, I'll admit, B.J. is a little eccentric, but so was Howard Hughes.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Look how that worked out for him.",
        "Henry: Right, bad example.",
        "Jack: Stop covering for the guy, Henry, just because he's your boss. You and I both know he's trouble.",
        "Henry: You know, I'm a little murky on the definition of trouble, per se.",
        "Jack: Trouble is what Katie got into at B.J.'s Halloween party.",
        "Henry: You know about that?",
        "Jack: Give me some credit, please.",
        "Henry: That was -- that was a bad, bad mistake. And B.J. feels terrible about it.",
        "Jack: Well, it sounds to me like he would have raped her.",
        "Henry: No, no. Come -- he wouldn't have done something like that. He was -- he was -- taking a trip down memory lane. He wanted to talk about high school --",
        "Jack: How long are you going to keep lying to yourself about what this guy is capable of, Henry?",
        "Henry: Until he fires me. And then he's fair game.",
        "Jack: Even you're not that greedy.",
        "Henry: Oh, really? Why don't you drive a limo for a few weeks and then you come back and talk to me, okay?",
        "Jack: Do you want to give this guy another chance to hurt Katie?",
        "Henry: He wouldn't do that!",
        "Jack: How do you know that? How do you know? We can kill two birds with one stone. The feds get the info that they want and you get to protect Katie. Do it for her. Do it for Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I was actually kind of excited about this college trip for you. In fact, I was even thinking of giving you access to your trust fund again.",
        "Will: Do you really think that's going to work? You think I'm going to turn my back on Gwen for access to my money again?",
        "Barbara: Well, it must be kind of hard on you, almost college-bound and you need to come to your mother for a new computer. A new pair of shoes, for that matter.",
        "Will: I'm not like you, Mom. Money doesn't rule my life.",
        "Barbara: This is not about money, this is about your life and about your future. And you know what? I can't believe you want to throw it away on some needy --",
        "Will: Stop right there. You don't want to make me choose between Gwen and you because I promise you, you will not like the outcome.",
        "Barbara: I don't care if you hate me. I love you. I will always love you. And I will always protect you. And I am telling you this, Will, Gwen Norbeck is going to drag you down. I am sure of that.",
        "Will: You know what? I don't give a damn what you think, any of you, okay? I've had it, with you, with Paul. You're not my family, you're my nightmare!",
        "Barbara: Will! Will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Meg, hi.",
        "Meg: Hey, hi, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I'm glad I ran into you. I was going to look for you later at the hospital.",
        "Meg: Why, is something wrong?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I -- I just wanted to thank you again for everything you did for me. Really, you could've gotten into a lot of trouble for getting those blood samples and having them tested. You went out on a limb and I'm very grateful.",
        "Meg: Well, you're welcome.",
        "Jennifer: I think that it really brought me down to earth. I guess I just needed that clinical proof to accept my baby's death. Once I realized that there was no compatibility between Gwen's baby's blood and mine, it finally opened my eyes. And Dusty's, too.",
        "Meg: I did what I had to do, Jen. For you and for Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, yeah. Well, this is bad timing. So, sorry. Let's go, Casey.",
        "Carly: No, please, just give me a chance to thank you for bringing this stuff. It's just so nice of you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, least we could do. You know, you and Jack have been on our minds a lot lately. I know it was difficult having the baby taken away.",
        "Gwen: Listen, Carly, I've got to go. So --",
        "Carly: No, wait. Please. Just everybody just wait a minute. I think this give us a really good opportunity to clear something up.",
        "Margo: What? Clear what up?",
        "Carly: This situation between Gwen and Casey. I think we should talk about what really happened.",

I don't think that he's a danger to Katie. And if he is -- if he is, I'm working with him, so I can keep an eye on things. Without losing my meal ticket because he thinks I'm spying on him for the FBI.
