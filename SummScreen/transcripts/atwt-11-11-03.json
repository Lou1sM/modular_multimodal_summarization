        "\r\nBob: I don't know. But I have a feeling that it's good news. You know, last week \r\nJohn said to me that he thought Chris had come a long way and that he was \r\nshaping up to be a fine addition to the staff.",
        "\r\nKim: Oh, that's good. I've been afraid that he's gonna come here and tell us \r\nthat he and Alison are back together and they're engaged.",

        "\r\nRosanna: Yes, well tell me, please. I'd like to hear the story, 'cause I'm kinda \r\ngoing out of my mind.",
        "\r\nCarly: It all started with Halloween. I had this idea that Sage and Parker and \r\nJack and I would dress up as \"hairy\" potters. Get it? Like, wizards with a lot \r\nof hair.",
        "\r\nRosanna: Really?",
        "\r\nCarly: Yes. So I got the wigs and the accessories and everything, but Jack \r\ndidn't think it was a very good idea, so I had to bring everything back. But the \r\nstore wouldn't take these because Parker cut the tags off them.",
        "\r\nRosanna: So that's when you ran into Craig, on your way back from the store?",
        "\r\nCarly: Right. I was on my way back from the store, and my car started making \r\nthis little sound and it wouldn't stop, so I stopped off at the Lakeview because \r\nthe Lakeview has a car rental desk. And I thought that I would have to rent a \r\ncar to get the rest of the way home, but then I saw your husband. And he offered \r\nme a lift.",

        "\r\nCarly: No, no. I thought you were a little stressed out. Is everything okay now?",
        "\r\nRosanna: Yeah, yeah, everything's okay. I just jumped to the wrong conclusion, \r\nthat's all.",
        "\r\nCarly: Right. Well, that's perfectly understandable. Craig is one of the most \r\ndevious, irresponsible, self-centered jackasses I've ever known, but he does \r\nlove you.",
        "\r\nRosanna: Thank you. Come here. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. You're just \r\nthe best sister and godmother to my child. And just thank you so much for being \r\na good friend.",
