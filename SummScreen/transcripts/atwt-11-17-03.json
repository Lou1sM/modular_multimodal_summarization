        "Lucy: Hi, Mrs. Hughes. ",
        "Kim: Aaron, hi. ",
        "Aaron: Hi, Mrs. Hughes. . How are you? \r\n",
        "Kim: Fine, thanks. How are you guys? \r\n",
        "Lucy: Good. Um, are you meeting Chris and his \r\ndad here for some lunch? It is a popular spot with the hospital crowd. \r\n",
        "Kim: Well, you're half right. Actually, I -- \r\nI am meeting Bob, but he\u2019s \r\nbeen\u00a0... and as for Chris, I guess you haven't heard. He's moved. ",
        "Aaron: Where? ",
        "Kim: To Philadelphia. He's taken a position \r\nat Children's Hospital there. Actually, Bob and I think it was a really snap \r\njudgment on his part. We're very concerned about him. We have a feeling that his \r\nleaving has something to do with Alison. ",
        "Lucy: Didn't he tell you? ",
        "Kim: Well, other than the fact that he was \r\nterribly upset. Why, did -- do you have some kind of insight into what happened \r\nbetween the two of them? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't really know why Chris and \r\nAlison broke up, but I think there was another guy involved. ",
        "",
        "[Alison remembering] ",
        "Chris: Okay, okay, okay. I'll go get them.\r\n",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no! Chris, please \r\ndon't leave me. ",
        "Chris: Hey, you can come with me. ",
        "Alison: No, we can\u2019t. Everything is so \r\nperfect. If we leave now, something absolutely terrible is gonna happen. \r\n",
        "Chris: Terrible like what? ",
        "Alison: I don't know. You'll run into some \r\nintern, and you'll have to go back to the hospital for some terrible emergency. \r\nPlease, Chris. ",
        "Chris: That's not gonna happen. ",
        "Alison: Well, it always happens, please. \r\nChris, let's not even take that chance, okay? ",
        "Susan: Oh! The line at that supermarket was \r\ninsane. How are you feeling? You feeling any better, sweetie? ",
        "Alison: Yes. ",
        "Susan: I got you some apple juice. You have \r\nto drink plenty of fluids. ",
        "Alison: Ah, maybe later. ",
        "Susan: Okay, you and I have to have a talk.\r\n",
        "Alison: Mom, I'm fine. ",
        "Susan: No, you're not fine. You've been on \r\nthat sofa for days; you practically cringe at the sight of food. Honey, I'm a \r\ndoctor. You can't fool me. It's painfully obvious what's wrong with you. \r\n",
        "",
        "Rose: I just hope when I marry Paul, I'm as \r\nhappy as you guys are. ",
        "Emily: Happy, Rose, is a work in progress.\r\n",
        "Carly: Yeah. Have you ever been to any of my \r\nweddings, Rose? ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "Rose: Yeah, but you made it, you and Jack. \r\nAnd so have you and Hal. ",
        "Emily: Yeah, but believe me, we still have \r\nour, you know, problems. ",
        "Carly: Yes, of course you do. Who doesn't?\r\n",
        "Rose: If I could only ship Barbara off to \r\nMars -- ",
        "Emily: Oh, I'd pay the freight. ",
        "Rose: Then my life would be perfect. \r\n",
        "Emily: Mine, too. ",
        "Carly: All right, well, here's to life on \r\nMars. ",
        "Emily: Ching, ching. ",
        "Rosanna: Excuse me, ladies, but I have to go. \r\nMy attorney just called. I have to sign off on an acquisition. ",
        "Rose: You leaving already? ",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I apologize. Um, I'll try to \r\ndouble back. I shouldn't be long. ",
        "Carly: Well, we'll save some champagne for \r\nyou. ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "Rosanna: All right, do. Thank you. See you in \r\na bit. Excuse me. I said excuse me. ",
        "Rose: Don't mind Mount Crater. ",
        "Rosanna: Who is this person? ",
        "Rose: Um, he's my bodyguard. I don't make a \r\nmove without him. ",
        "Rosanna: Ah. ",
        "Carly: Okay, Rose, I think it's about time \r\nyou told all of us why exactly you need a bodyguard. ",
        "Rose: I got a nasty phone call. ",
        "Rosanna: What, you were threatened? Are the \r\npolice involved? ",
        "Rose: Oh, please. I mean, come on, let's be \r\nreal. I don't need the cops to tell me there's of people in this town who'd \r\nrather see me dead than married to Paul, right? ",

        "Molly: Hey, it's Molly McKinnon. Leave a \r\nmessage, and I'll get back to you. ",
        "[Beep] ",
        "Dusty: It's me. Call my cell. Oh, back so \r\nsoon? ",
        "Barbara: That call I overheard was about Paul \r\nand Rose, wasn't it? Something big is happening, isn't it, Dusty? Tell me what \r\nit is. Maybe I can help. ",
        "",
        "Paul: You need to get out of here, Molly, or \r\nI'm gonna call the police. ",
        "Molly: Not until I see Rose. ",
        "Paul: You -- you think that that gizmo is \r\nmine and that I used it to call Rose and threaten her? Why -- why would I do \r\nthat? ",
        "Molly: You tell me. ",
        "Paul: I bought that for Will. ",
        "Molly: For Will? ",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Molly: Yeah. ",
        "Paul: Kid having a hard time lately. He's \r\ninto gadgets. I thought he'd get a kick out of it. What are you doing here \r\nanyway, Molly? Shouldn't you be at Metro before Dusty sells your part of the \r\nplace away to someone else? ",
        "Molly: I think you called Rose, used this \r\nthing to scare her deliberately. I know that, you know that. As soon as I'm \r\nfinished with Rose, she'll know it, too. ",
        "",
        "Ben: Jessica. ",
        "Jessica: I thought you had a consult. \r\n",
        "Ben: I rescheduled. ",
        "Jessica: Are you still angry? ",
        "Ben: No. ",
        "Jessica: I understand why you didn't want to \r\ncome with me. ",
        "Ben: Still trying to understand why you feel \r\nyou had to. ",
        "Jessica: I don't know if I can answer that. \r\nIt's so empty. ",
        "Ben: What did you expect? ",
        "Jessica: I don't know. Bonnie's in prison, a \r\nman is dead, and no one cares enough to even come and say good-bye. ",
        "Ben: So how was Bonnie when you talked to \r\nher? ",
        "Jessica: Well, it's her first day at the \r\nwomen's prison. You know, she's shell-shocked. From the moment Marshall came to \r\nOakdale that changed everything about my life. ",
        "Ben: He can't hurt you anymore, Jess. \r\n",
        "Jessica: I wanted him gone, I wanted him out \r\nof my life, but I didn't want this. ",
        "Ben: I know. Let's -- let's go say a prayer \r\nand go home. ",
        "Jessica: What do we pray for? ",
        "Ben: Pray for a new beginning, for Sarah, for \r\nBonnie and for you, without Marshall Travers. ",

        "Rosanna: Are you sure this man is qualified \r\nto protect you? ",
        "R rose: Come on. Paul would only hire the \r\nbest. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sure that's true, but if \r\nsomeone out there is intent on stopping your wedding -- ",
        "Rose: I can handle 'em. I can handle \r\neverybody from big momma down now that I got Crater riding shotgun. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm -- I'm glad Paul is taking \r\ncare of things. ",
        "Rose: You know, he's the only one in my life \r\nthat's ever looked out for me, other than my pop. I can't believe it. I don't \r\nknow what I would do without him. ",
        "Rosanna: If you need anything, if there's \r\nanything I can do -- ",
        "Rose: Oh, thank you. That's nice. Yeah, I'll \r\nlet you know. ",
        "Rosanna: All right. I'm not sure how long my \r\nmeeting's gonna take, but if I don't get back, I'll call you later, all right?\r\n",
        "Rose: Okay. ",
        "Rosanna: Okay. ",

        "Rosanna: You bet. ",
        "Lily: Mitzi? Everything okay? ",
        "Mitzi: Yeah. I was in la-la land. ",
        "Lily: Something wrong? ",
        "Mitzi: No, no. Why -- why would anything be \r\nwrong? ",
        "Lily: You've just been very quiet. \r\n",
        "Mitzi: Well, it's Rose's day. ",
        "Lily: Yes, it is, and you've barely said two \r\nwords to her. ",
        "Mitzi: I know. There's not much left to say.\r\n",
        "Lily: You're still upset about her selling \r\nthe shop? ",
        "Mitzi: Well, she's got to do what she's got \r\nto do. ",
        "Lily: Rose, she said that she was gonna help \r\nyou start your own. ",
        "Mitzi: You know, I may be broke, Lil, but \r\nI've got my pride. ",
        "Lily: What difference does it make if you \r\nopen your own shop or run the Roller Palace? ",
        "Mitzi: It's a big difference, okay? I helped \r\nbuild the Roller Palace. It wouldn't have been just a handout. ",
        "Lily: Okay. Well, maybe you should talk to \r\nRose. Maybe you could still work something out. ",
        "Mitzi: Thanks, Lil, but it's too late. So \r\nwhat's going on with the shop? Buyout a done deal? ",
        "Lily: Well, they want to close as soon as \r\nthey audit the books. ",
        "Mitzi: Oh, yeah, right. Rose told me about \r\nthat audit thing. Why did they have to do that again? ",
        "Lily: Just to make sure that the expenses \r\ndon't outweigh the revenues. And they're using my accountant. He's excellent.\r\n",
        "Mitzi: Nothing but the best for Rose. Um, \r\nit's been nice chatting, but I've got to go. ",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no. You \r\ncan't leave yet. We haven't even cut the cake. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have \r\nbrought up the shop. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. ",
        "Mitzi: No, no. Why would the shop upset me? \r\nUm, why are we standing around here? You know, I need more punch. You want some?\r\n",

        "Barbara: Come on, we can't talk out here, \r\nokay? ",
        "Dusty: You got two minutes. ",
        "Barbara: Why the rush? ",
        "Dusty: None of your business. ",
        "Barbara: Okay, what did Molly find out about \r\nPaul and Rose? ",
        "Dusty: What's wrong with you? You were \r\nlistening outside? ",
        "Barbara: Of course I was listening. And I \r\ndon't care what it is that she found out, so long as it keeps Paul from marrying \r\nRose. I me, come on, it's us against them. ",
        "Dusty: I'm not against Rose. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, right. You're protecting her, \r\nyou're rescuing her. Whatever it's called I don't care, so long as they don't \r\nend up together. ",
        "Dusty: Barbara -- Barbara, you and I are not \r\na team. Now go home, would you? ",
        "Barbara: To what? ",
        "Dusty: To that little redhead called your \r\nkid. You know the one that can still be around you for more than five minutes.\r\n",
        "Barbara: I'm not allowed to see Will anymore.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Why? What happened? ",
        "Barbara: I've lost visitation. I've lost just \r\nabout everything. ",
        "Dusty: What'd you do? ",
        "Barbara: Nothing to deserve losing my son.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Well, then go fix it. I mean, stop \r\nmessing around with Rose and put your focus on being a real mother to this kid.\r\n",
        "Barbara: I can\u2019t. Hal's taken out a \r\nrestraining order. And do you know how that's killing me, knowing my son is \r\nacross town wanting to see his mother, needing his mother? ",
        "Dusty: I -- I didn't know about that. \r\n",
        "Barbara: I feel like I'm losing both of my \r\nsons. ",
        "Dusty: Barbara -- just stay out of my way, \r\nall right, and then maybe this whole wedding thing won't come off. ",
        "Barbara: Hi, Jen, it's Mom. Uh, yeah, I was \r\nhoping that maybe we could see each other for a moment, maybe meet at Al's. \r\nWell, I don't really want to talk about it on the phone, and I need a favor from \r\nyou. I can't do this without you. ",
        "",
        "Paul: That -- that doesn't make any sense. I \r\nmean, even if I did, for whatever reason, do something like that, why would I be \r\nso stupid as to leave the evidence lying around? You found it. Rose lives here. \r\nShe could just as easily have found it. ",
        "Molly: I think you wanted to convince Rose \r\nthat she needed a bodyguard so you could see what she's doing and who she was \r\ndoing it all hours of the day. ",
        "Paul: If I wanted to spy on Rose, why would I \r\nbe so obvious as to hire a guy the size of Mt. Everest? ",
        "Molly: The bigger, the better? To show her \r\nhow much you love her, Paul, hmm? ",
        "Paul: You've been spending so much time with \r\nDusty, you're starting to sound like him. It's a toy, Molly! It's just a toy!\r\n",
        "Molly: Let's see how Rose likes your taste in \r\ntoys, Paul. ",
        "Paul: I don't get it. What's in it for you? \r\nWhat's your angle? ",
        "Molly: My angle is the truth, the chance -- a \r\nchance to prove I'm right. ",
        "Paul: You need to be right about a voice \r\nchanger? ",
        "Molly: No, not about this, about you. You \r\nknow, there's a few things that women know. They just know. Like that three-inch \r\nheels hurt like hell by the end of a long night, and that guys who hire a \r\nbodyguard have something to hide. ",
        "Paul: I love Rose. I'm in love with Rose. I \r\nwould never hide anything from her. ",
        "Molly: But this toy gives you a credibility \r\nproblem, Paul. ",
        "Paul: I have a credibility problem? Molly, \r\ndon't you think it's a little pathetic for you to help the man that you love go \r\nbe with another woman? ",

        "Susan: I know you don't want to talk about \r\nit, and I know why. But I can't let this go on. ",
        "Alison: Mom, I wanted to tell you, I just -- \r\nI just didn't know how. ",
        "Susan: I know. It's not easy to tell somebody \r\nhow much it hurts to lose the guy you love. When I found out about Rick, I just \r\nwanted to give up on life, too. I wanted to lock all the doors, never leave the \r\nhouse. It was torture going back to work. I was sure everybody was talking about \r\nme behind my back about what a pathetic mess I'd made of my life. So do you know \r\nwhat I did? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Susan: I tried to focus on all the good \r\nthings left in my life, like you and Emily and Daniel and my work. It just takes \r\ntime. I know you don't believe that, but one of these days, you'll wake up, and \r\neverything will seem so much better. ",

        "Lucy: No, but Chris did show up at my \r\nHalloween party trying to find out. ",
        "[Aaron remembering] ",
        "Alison: It would've been great if Chris was \r\nangry because he still wanted me. ",

        "Alison: Really? ",
        "Aaron: Absolutely. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe I should've told him it \r\nwas you. And then every time he saw ",
        "you, it would tear his heart out. ",
        "Lucy: Right, Aaron? ",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry, what? ",
        "Lucy: I was just telling Ms. Hughes that \r\nChris was really angry when he came to my party. He was sure Alison had someone \r\nelse, but she denied it. ",
        "Kim: So do you believe her? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. You can't really be too \r\nsure with Alison. ",
        "Kim: Well, I guess Alison meant a lot more to \r\nChris than Bob and I realized, and I suppose with everything so unresolved when \r\nhe left, that does explain why he was so terribly upset. ",
        "Lucy: I wouldn't be surprised. ",
        "Kim: That will make it very hard for him to \r\nget started again in Philadelphia. All right, I'm gonna let you two go back to \r\nyour date. I'm gonna run an errand before Bob comes. ",

        "Aaron: Okay. ",
        "Kim: Bye-bye. ",
        "Aaron: You know, Chris would be really upset \r\nif he knew his mom was getting involved in his love life. You know, guys don't \r\nlike that very much. ",
        "Lucy: She's just worried. ",
        "Aaron: If Chris wanted her to know, Lucy, he \r\nwould have told her. ",
        "Lucy: Chris saw a wristwatch in the hotel. He \r\nwouldn't have made something like that up ",
        "Aaron: The guy was crazy at the Halloween \r\nparty. He barely knew what he was saying. You know, it's -- it's none of our \r\nbusiness anyway. ",
        "Lucy: But aren't you curious? Okay, I mean, \r\nAlison loves Chris, right? ",
        "Aaron: Right. ",
        "Lucy: And he obviously cares about her, or he \r\nwouldn't have gotten so upset. I just don't understand why Alison didn't come \r\nclean about whatever it is she did, and then they could've worked it out. \r\n",
        "Aaron: I don't know. ",
        "Lucy: Something about Alison\u2019s story just \r\ndoesn't make sense. ",

And I don't know what it \r\nis. Is it just that you're just so lonely for a man's attention that you're \r\nwilling to throw away a shot at maybe having the real thing? Instead, you're \r\ngonna settle for whatever it is that Dusty Donovan -- ",
