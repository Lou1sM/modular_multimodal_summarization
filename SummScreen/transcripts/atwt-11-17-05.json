        "Emily: Let's -- let's get married?",
        "Paul: Yeah, sure, why not?",
        "Emily: Like, let's have mushrooms on our pizza?",
        "Paul: No, I hate mushrooms.",
        "Emily: I'm serious.",
        "Paul: So am I. They're all squishy.",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "Paul: Hey, look, if this is going to help Daniel, and if Tom's giving you a hard time about you and me --",
        "Emily: We run to the justice of the peace and eliminate the problem?",
        "Paul: Exactly.",
        "Emily: Thanks. But don't do me any favors.",

        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey!",
        "Carly: Hi!",
        "Jack: I got cola and orange soda.",
        "Carly: Did you get the root beer?",
        "Jack: Honey, nobody drinks root beer.",
        "Carly: Well, Gwen might. All right, I have tuna salad and chicken salad, and then all the stuff from the deli, and I have whole wheat bread and I have rye bread --",
        "Jack: Relax.",
        "Carly: And pumpernickel, so --",
        "Jack: Would you relax? The important thing is, is that she's coming. It's a good sign.",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't know.",
        "Jack: Well, how did she sound when you asked her?",
        "Carly: She was a little defensive at first. But then we started talking about baby stuff and she warmed up a little. But that was just for a few minutes, you know, it wasn't an entire afternoon.",
        "Jack: Let's stay positive. You've got the kids, pumpernickel bread and me, the ever-entertaining Jack Snyder. What more do you need?",
        "Carly: So, what is the entertaining Jack Snyder going to do about all that stuff that we can't discuss, but that's just there just sort of bubbling under the surface?",
        "Jack: He's going to make sure that it stays under the surface. Today is about having lunch with your sister and her baby. Don't expect the worst.",
        "Carly: Well, with Gwen, that's what I usually get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Change of clothes. Do you need another bottle?",
        "Gwen: Nope, just my head examined.",
        "Will: Join the club.",
        "Gwen: Why are we doing this again?",
        "Will: Because Carly is your sister.",
        "Gwen: That's just a word.",
        "Will: And it's going to stay just a word unless you give it a try. Come on, all you have to do today is smile and eat.",
        "Gwen: The last time I consumed something that Carly gave me, I passed out and woke up without my son.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, this is a little different.",
        "Iris: Oh, you going somewhere?",
        "Will: Lunch.",
        "Iris: What, is he answering for you now?",
        "Gwen: Don't start, Mom.",
        "Iris: Fine. Just bring me a grilled cheese, huh?",
        "Gwen: We're not going to a restaurant.",
        "Will: We're going to Carly's.",
        "Iris: Are you nuts?",
        "Will: It's going to be good for Gwen and Billy.",
        "Iris: It's good for nobody but Carly. Honey, you have got family. You don't need her. She's just using you! You know that, right?",
        "Will: We should get going. Let's get out of here.",
        "Gwen: I'll get Billy and I'll meet you in the car.",
        "Will: I'll go warm it up. Lay off her, she's trying.",
        "Iris: Don't say I didn't warn you.",

        "Holden: Lily, you're not serious. What's going on here?",
        "Keith: She told you what's going on.",
        "Holden: Lily, talk to me. Don't look at him. Look at me. You don't love this guy.",
        "Keith: You know what? Just leave her alone.",
        "Holden: Is that what you want? Do you want me to leave you alone? Do you want me to walk away? You love me. We were on our way back to each other. What is going on here?",
        "Keith: Lily is with me now. So just accept it.",
        "Holden: No, I won't accept it! Not now, not tomorrow, not ever!",
        "Lily: Please, just go, Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily -- when did this happen?",
        "Lily: I never stopped caring about Keith.",
        "Keith: So now, you need to accept that, Holden.",
        "Holden: You're the reason that Luke almost died.",
        "Keith: I had nothing to do with him stowing away in the plane, or the fact that he got sick.",
        "Lily: Holden, we both know that Keith had no idea that Luke was on that plane.",
        "Holden: Lily, why are you defending him?",
        "Lily: I'm not trying to hurt you, Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily, you said that you loved me. You said that you wanted to be a family again. That we were going to be together again.",
        "Keith: You know what? Maybe that's just what you wanted to hear.",
        "Holden: He preys on people's pain and suffering for a few lousy bucks. I can't believe that this is the guy that you're telling me that you're falling in love with.",
        "Keith: Well, of course she's in love with me. Why -- why do you think she's marrying me?",

        "Lucinda: Hey, good afternoon, good looking.",
        "Luke: It's afternoon?",
        "Lucinda: Almost.",
        "Luke: Where's Dad?",
        "Lucinda: He's with your mom.",
        "Luke: Cool.",
        "Lucinda: Very cool.",
        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, yeah. Just a little tired, a little cranky.",
        "Luke: That's nothing new.",
        "Lucinda: Watch it, kid.",
        "Luke: I like you cranky. So what are the doctors saying?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, they say I'm too mean to die.",
        "Luke: Good.",
        "Lucinda: Do you need anything at all?",
        "Luke: No. You know, I'm doing much better, Grandma. The doctor said I can go home pretty soon.",
        "Lucinda: I guess you'll be expecting a party.",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah. And the perfect present from my grandma.",
        "Lucinda: I'll make sure Emma bakes you something special.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I was thinking something more along the lines of something with four wheels, metallic red, lots of horsepower.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'll see what I can do about that. But strictly entre nous.",
        "Luke: And you have to keep your end of the bargain, too.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not going to miss one treatment. I'm not going to duck out on one appointment.",
        "Luke: Okay, good. I don't need a present or a party, either. You know, having Mom and Dad back together is the best homecoming present I could have.",
        "Lucinda: Better than a sports car?",
        "Luke: Yeah, much better.",
        "Lucinda: You're a good kid. Do you mind if I leave you on your own just a minute?",
        "Luke: No. Why?",
        "Lucinda: I just -- I want to make sure that nothing keeps your wish from coming true.",

        "Carly: Do you think I got enough stuff?",
        "Jack: Oh, you got plenty of stuff.",
        "Carly: Because there's nothing worse than running out.",
        "Jack: Honey, this is not about food.",
        "Carly: I wish it were.",
        "Jack: You've told Gwen you want peace. No strings.",
        "Carly: But there are strings. You know there are strings, and Gwen knows there are strings, and I really, really, really don't want her to testify against me.",
        "Jack: A little ham sandwich really isn't that much of a bribe.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: I just thought if she got it, you know -- family and what it does for you and how it changes you --",
        "Jack: Yes, honey, you can't want those things for her, though. She's got to want them for herself.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: I'm proud of you. That you finally realized that you want her to be a part of your life.",
        "Carly: Because she has such a charming personality.",
        "Jack: No. But because Gwen is a part of you. And I know how much you miss Rosanna.",
        "Carly: I do. I do miss her. I miss the phone calls and sneaking away to the Lakeview for lunch. I miss her dropping by here to spoil the kids.",
        "Jack: Me, too. Me, too.",
        "Carly: Gwen and Rosanna are like night and day, though, Jack. Rosanna is everything that every woman wants to be. She's beautiful, dignified. She walks into a room and every head turns.",
        "Jack: You turn my head.",
        "Carly: Come on. You know what I'm saying here. I'm saying that Gwen could never take her place.",
        "Jack: She's not trying to.",
        "Carly: She's really not trying at all.",
        "Jack: Maybe today will change all that.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I hope so.",

        "Parker: It's Rory!",
        "Carly: No, sweetheart. Remember, don't call him that, okay?",
        "Parker: Okay. Go away.",
        "Carly: Parker Joe Munson.",
        "Parker: But you hate her, Mom.",
        "Gwen: No, the kid's right. Let's go.",
        "Carly: No! Gwen -- Gwen, please. Please don't go.",

        "Susan: You look grim. Crime statistics?",
        "Hal: Close. My divorce decree.",
        "Susan: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Hal: Have a seat.",
        "Susan: It's final?",
        "Hal: Yep.",
        "Susan: Wow.",
        "Hal: And I've got the legal seal to prove it.",
        "Susan: I can't believe it's over.",
        "Hal: Oh, it's over. I knew this day was coming, Susan. She's young and beautiful. What the hell did she ever see in me in the first place?",
        "Susan: Oh, I don't know -- character? Honesty? Stability? Love?",
        "Hal: Well, now she's seeing all those things in Paul.",
        "Susan: So you're giving up?",
        "Hal: Hey, I'm the guy that went down with the ship.",
        "Susan: Oh, come on. She still needs you.",
        "Hal: Emily stopped needing me a long, long time ago, Susan. But I'll be damned if I'm going to sell my last piece of pride to protect her anymore. From now on, Emily's on her own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're mad.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm mad.",
        "Paul: Because I want to get married?",
        "Emily: No, because you just asked me to fix a problem.",
        "Paul: Isn't that what people who love each other do?",
        "Emily: And you love me?",
        "Paul: Do I really need to answer that question?",
        "Emily: Yeah, in your own way",
        "Paul: What did I do?",
        "Emily: You don't know? You honestly don't know?",
        "Paul: Okay, look, if -- if you want me to get down on one knee, I'll get down on one knee. Or better yet, we'll go to the jeweler's. We'll pick you out the biggest rock in the world. You'll blind people when you walk down the street.",
        "Emily: Paul, I'm serious.",
        "Paul: So am I. I'm not going to be the reason that you lose Daniel.",
        "Emily: And I don't want Daniel to be the reason you ask me to marry you.",
        "Paul: Why? I think it's a terrific reason. What do you want me to do? Emily, tell me what it is that you want me to do, and I'll do that. Look, you want to make it legal? We'll get a ceremony. It's just a ceremony. We'll have a piece of paper.",
        "Emily: That's what marriage is to you? A -- just a piece of paper?",
        "Paul: I don't need a legal document to tell me how lucky I am to have you.",
        "Emily: Oh, really? And why are you lucky, Paul?",
        "Paul: Uh, okay. You're beautiful. You're loving. You're sexy. You make my very small, twisted mind better. Did I say you're sexy?",
        "Emily: You forgot loyal. Nobody keeps a secret like me, hmm?",
        "Paul: We are more than just keeping a secret.",
        "Emily: Are we?",
        "Paul: You know we are.",
        "Emily: Okay, so if we were to go on like this, you know, for the rest of our lives, you'd be okay with that?",
        "Paul: Probably. I'm just being honest here, okay? Emily, you're the one who walked out on a marriage only a few months ago.",
        "Emily: A marriage I thought would last forever.",
        "Paul: Yeah, exactly. That's my point. We're looking at a failure rate of 50% here. We're -- you and me -- we're both living proof.",
        "Emily: Stop! Okay, don't say anything else.",
        "Paul: I don't mean to sound cynical.",
        "Emily: Those vows meant something to me. I mean, I tried with everything I had to make it work. And just because it didn't work out with Hal, doesn't mean I'm going to give up on finding forever.",
        "Paul: That's what you want? Emily, you want me to promise you forever?",
        "Emily: I want you to promise to love me more than anybody, more than anything in your whole life. I want to be your greatest passion. I want to be the first person you think of when you wake up in the morning, and the last thought you have in your mind when you fall off asleep. I want to come first every single moment of every single day. Forever. Is that what you're offering me? Because I won't settle for less.",
        "Paul: Emily, I don't want you to settle for anything less than you think you deserve. All right? We have respect. We have honesty. We have trust. I don't feel the need to get married. But if you do, if it's going to make you happy, if it's going to make Daniel happy, then I want it every bit as much as you do.",
        "Emily: Do you not understand? Do you not understand what I'm saying? You don't want to understand?",
        "Paul: No, I understand. I've had that drive-yourself-crazy, all-consuming kind of love, Emily, and it almost broke me. If you hadn't walked through that door, I'd be one of the living dead right now. I'd be staring at the ceiling 24 hours a day.",
        "Emily: Why do I suddenly feel like somebody else is in this room?",
        "Paul: Look, when Rosanna left me, I learned an important lesson. Okay? I learned to stop pretending, stop tricking myself into thinking that there was such a thing as a perfect partner, as a perfect relationship. True love is two people protecting each other from the rest of the world. And I love you, Emily. I do. And I hope that you love me, for one thing, for standing here and not pretending to give you something that I don't even have to give. Life changed me, thank god. Now I can appreciate you for the woman that you are, instead of trying to worship you or some other kind of ideal woman that doesn't even exist. And I hope that you appreciate me for being the moody, intense -- sometimes playful guy that I am. Because that is what forevers are made of. And you and I, Emily, we have everything that a woman and a man could possibly need to be happy. That's enough.",
        "Emily: I'm not so sure it is anymore.",

        "Stan: Where were you? You had me worried.",
        "Iris: Ah, honey, I didn't know you cared. You want one?",
        "Stan: No. You okay?",
        "Iris: You know, I'm feeling fine. It's really weird. You sure you got the right stuff here?",
        "Stan: I can read, Iris. See? Methanol. This is the poison Will used on that d'angelo woman.",
        "Iris: Maybe it just hasn't hit yet.",
        "Stan: Maybe you haven't used enough. Here.",
        "Iris: No, no, no. Now, this is the good stuff. I'm using this as the chaser. I put the other stuff in the papaya drink. It made me gag anyway.",
        "Stan: All right, let me spike it with a few drops.",
        "Iris: No, no, no, no! Don't touch it! I got Will's fingerprints on there. If yours go on, then we're really going to be sunk. All right? Just give it to me. How many drops?",
        "Stan: A couple more. And one for good luck.",
        "Iris: I'm trying to get sick, not make the undertaker rich.",
        "Stan: Wait. Maybe you should drink it straight.",
        "Iris: I don't think so. Whew! That should give it a little punch there.",
        "Stan: You're one hell of a woman, Iris.",
        "Iris: To my million dollar baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker, why don't you go get the other kids?",
        "Parker: But, Dad --",
        "Jack: Do it.",

        "Gwen: Kids are honest.",
        "Will: Let's -- let's just go.",
        "Jack: No. No, Will, the last thing Parker remembers is the baby leaving.",
        "Carly: Right. And he was very upset. We all were. But he and the other kids just have to get used to the idea that they have a new little cousin. And a new aunt.",
        "Gwen: It's a fantasy.",
        "Jack: Maybe, Gwen. But, the least you could do is come in and see how it goes, right?",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Hi.",
        "Parker: See? I told you Rory was home.",
        "Carly: Remember, kids, I told you that the baby's name is Billy.",
        "Jack: Yeah, buddy, we talked about that.",
        "Carly: Well, sit down, please. Be comfortable.",
        "Parker: Is he staying?",
        "Jack: No, he's just visiting.",
        "Will: He lives with Gwen, now. Buddy, it's like you and me -- we're family, right? But we don't live together.",
        "Carly: Remember? I explained to you that Gwen is the baby's mommy. And Gwen is my sister. So, so he's your cousin. I know that it's complicated.",
        "J.J.: So, she's like our aunt?",
        "Jack: Exactly. Gwen is your aunt.",
        "Parker: But Aunt Rosanna is our aunt.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, it turns out that I have two sisters. Aunt Rosanna and Aunt Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Your mom and I are just kind of figuring this out ourselves, too. So --",
        "Carly: But we've got plenty of time to get to know each other. I hope.",
        "Jack: Your mom's right. So listen, it's a good thing we're all together because the holidays are coming up, and I think we should talk about getting your new cousin here some really cool stuff. Huh?",
        "J.J.: What about a light saber?",
        "Will: I think he's got to grow into a light saber, pal.",
        "J.J.: Well, I can teach him magic cards.",
        "Jack: I want you to teach me first.",
        "Carly: Why don't we just save those magic cards, for now, okay? I hope you're hungry.",
        "Parker: I am!",
        "Jack: Well, that's good, because your mom made enough sandwiches for the whole block.",
        "Gwen: I can help.",
        "Carly: No. Come on, you just relax. Jack and I'll take care of it.",
        "Will: So far, so good, huh? What do you think?",

        "Lily: I need to talk to Holden. Alone. Please.",
        "Keith: I understand this is really rough. We're doing the right thing, Lily. We are. You know? Come on. I love you.",
        "Holden: This does not add up.",
        "Lily: Why? I mean, Keith and I were very close before all the trouble in Mexico.",
        "Holden: Were you close when we spent the night together? When we promised that we'd be a family again?",
        "Lily: We were scared, out of our minds, for Luke. We needed each other.",
        "Holden: And now you need Keith?",
        "Lily: He explained everything. He got caught up in a situation that he didn't really understand.",
        "Holden: Trust me, he understood plenty.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter. It doesn't change what's going to happen between you and me. It's over. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: No, it is not over. I know that you love me. And whatever you're feeding me here right now, I'm not buying it. When we were down in Mexico, you saw Keith for what he really was. You know he's responsible for getting Luke sick.",
        "Lily: He tried to make up for that. I mean, he has. He has helped Luke as much as anybody.",
        "Holden: How? I want to know. How did he come to the rescue?",
        "Lily: You know, our marriage broke up because we were having problems. Those problems didn't just go away because Luke got sick! And they're not going to go away because he's better now!",
        "Holden: Lily, we were going to work our way through those problems. I don't know how to stop loving you, and I don't think you know how to stop loving me either.",
