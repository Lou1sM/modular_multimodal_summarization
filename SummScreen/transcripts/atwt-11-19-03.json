        "Aaron: Luce, I know you're hurt and angry. \r\nAnd I don't blame you. I'd feel real lousy if you'd -- ",
        "Lucy: Slept with someone else? Five minutes \r\nafter we broke up? ",
        "Aaron: Well, that's the thing. Lucy, we were \r\nbroken up. And I'm not making excuses here. Luce, I just -- I thought there was \r\nno hope for you and me. I mean, that's -- why would I ever think you'd care \r\nabout what I did? Ever again. So to hold this against me -- I don't understand.\r\n",
        "Lucy: It doesn't feel good, Aaron. Maybe you \r\nthink you had every right in the world to do whatever you wanted, but it doesn't \r\nfeel good. ",
        "Aaron: And it's gonna feel better if we break \r\nup? What's the point of that, Lucy? What's the point? You're gonna be miserable. \r\nI'm gonna be miserable. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm sure Alison can comfort you. \r\nWhy don't you just go to her? ",

        "Susan: Honey -- ",
        "Alison: Mom, I'm not up to it right now, \r\nplease? ",
        "Susan: I want to apologize for yelling at \r\nyou. I just wasn't expecting this. ",
        "Alison: So that's it? No lecture? ",
        "Susan: Well, I am concerned about you. The \r\nbreakup with Chris is one thing, but to -- to mess up your relationship with \r\nyour -- your closest friends -- ",
        "Alison: Closest friends? They're not my \r\nclosest friends. ",
        "Susan: They used to be. I thought you'd \r\nstraightened all that out. Lucy and Aaron were a couple and you were all getting \r\nalong so nicely. ",
        "Alison: Mom, Lucy and Aaron are the least of \r\nmy problems, okay? You have no clue -- no idea of what I'm dealing with. \r\n",

        "Craig: You had a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Paul Ryan \r\nand you wonder why I'm curious? ",
        "Rosanna: I did not have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, with \r\nPaul Ryan -- unless, of course, it makes you jealous, which does offer me some \r\ncomfort. ",
        "Craig: Jealous? He bugged my bar -- \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Ooh, well, if you'd like to search \r\nme, go ahead. ",

        "Molly: What can I get for you? ",
        "Crater: Bourbon. Double. ",
        "Rosanna: That's Rose's bodyguard. I hope he's \r\nnot drinking on the job. ",
        "Craig: What does Rose D'Angelo need a \r\nbodyguard for? ",
        "Rosanna: Paul hired him. But that's a long \r\nstory, and I\u2019d rather not indulge in long stories when I can do this. \r\n",
        "Molly: Rough day? ",
        "Crater: Like you wouldn't believe. \r\n",

        "Dusty: No, no, no, no, no -- ",
        "Rose: Hey, it's my car, all right? \r\n",
        "Dusty: Hey, don't go over here; they may have \r\nwired it to blow. ",
        "Rose: Who's \"they\"? Tell me who \"they\" is. \r\nCome on. ",
        "Dusty: Whoever did this? Look at this. \"Die, \r\nRose, die.\" That's a pretty nasty threat. ",
        "Rose: You think? ",
        "Dusty: Who you calling? ",
        "Rose: I'm calling the cops so they can arrest \r\nyou for trashing my car. ",
        "Rose: Hey! Gimme my phone. Give it -- \r\n",
        "Dusty: Why would I trash your car? \r\n",
        "Rose: I don't know. Because you're crazy. \r\nBecause you're working for Barbara. How the hell should I know? ",
        "Dusty: So you're just gonna call the cops and \r\npoint the finger at me? ",
        "Rose: I want it to stop. First the phone \r\ncall, now trashing my car. I'm getting married and you're not happy about it. \r\nJust grow up and get over it. It's over. ",
        "Dusty: I know it's over! ",
        "Rose: Good. All right. ",
        "Dusty: Doesn't mean -- doesn't mean I want to \r\nsee you get hurt, all right? ",
        "Rose: All right, all right. So somebody with \r\nan ax to grind with me took it out on my car. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that somebody is your fianc\u00e9.\r\n",
        "Rose: Oh, my God! What? ",
        "Dusty: You take one look at your car and \r\nimmediately, you blame me. Who'd be happy about that? Paul? Maybe? ",
        "Rose: He hired a bodyguard for me. \r\n",
        "Dusty: Yeah, so he can keep a leash on you.\r\n",
        "Rose: But I got away from the bodyguard. He \r\ndoesn't know where I am right now. So you're gonna tell me the phone call -- \r\nthat was him, too? ",
        "Dusty: As a matter of fact, I got to tell you \r\n-- Molly McKinnon found a voice alternator in Paul\u2019s pocket. ",
        "Rose: Excuse me? ",
        "Dusty: Go ahead. Go ahead and ask her. \r\n",
        "Rose: Yeah, I'm gonna believe Molly McKinnon.\r\n",
        "Dusty: You know what? You don't have believe \r\nanything but your gut. You know something's wrong. Paul Ryan has got you running \r\nscared. Because he wants to keep you under lock and key, far away from the \r\npeople who care about you. Is that the kind of life you want? ",
        "Paul: You better listen to him, Rose. I'm a \r\nreal head case. You never know what I'm gonna do next. ",

        "Hal: I'll call you. We'll talk more about \r\nthis later, Will. Okay? ",
        "Will: It's not fair. ",
        "Emily: You're right, it's not fair. But the \r\nbest thing we can do for your mom right now is follow the rules, will. No \r\ncontact until the judge says so. ",
        "",
        "Susan: Look, I know how much Chris hurt you. \r\nAnd I know that when you're in pain like that, sometimes it feels like nothing \r\nelse matters. The hell with everybody. But that's short-sighted. What you and \r\nAaron did was wrong. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Susan: Well, then, maybe you owe it to \r\nyourself to make amends to Lucy and Aaron -- own up to your part in all this.\r\n",
        "Alison: It's not like I did this myself. \r\nAaron was there, too. ",
        "Susan: Then he'll have to clean up his side \r\nof the street. But I'm concerned about you. We all make mistakes. It's how we \r\ncome back from the mistakes that really matters. Facing up to what you've done \r\nand learning from it. It's gonna be okay, honey. ",

Not \r\njust because he was a handsome young man, but because he was kind and sensitive. \r\nAnd he worked hard to prove himself, to get his diploma, to prove himself to \r\nyour dad. There were lots of good reasons for you to be with him. He did have \r\nhis faults though, too. He took some shortcuts, and maybe, when he was \r\nconfronted with Alison and her needs -- you know, the two of them just weren't \r\nthinking.
