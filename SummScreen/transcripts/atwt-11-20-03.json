        "Alison: [To her unborn child] Just do me a favor, kid. Just lay low until I can figure out how to tell everybody that you're coming. I've wrecked enough lives already.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Susan: Hi, it's Mom. Your supervisor is looking for you. You should have been at work a half an hour ago.",
        "Alison: I know. I overslept.",
        "Susan: I'm not surprised. You were up half the night after that visit from Aaron and Lucy.",
        "Alison: I'm okay.",
        "Susan: I know you feel guilty about breaking them up. But, you know, Aaron played a role in that, too.",
        "Alison: Mom, do we really have to talk about this right now?",
        "Susan: All I'm saying is that when you're emotionally drained, you're susceptible to all kinds of bugs. In fact, why don't you stay home from work today? I'll schedule a physical for you instead.",
        "Alison: No, I don't need a physical.",
        "Susan: I think you do. I've been very worried about how rundown you've been lately.",
        "Alison: Don't be. I'm okay. I'm on my way. Just tell Nurse Ratchet to keep her shirt on. Okay? [Doorbell rings] I'm on my way. I've got to go.",
        "Lucy: I didn't sleep all night.",
        "Alison: Join the club.",
        "Lucy: I have a few things to say to you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I get that you're hurt, but I really have to get to work. I'm late, so --",
        "Lucy: Well, then call the hospital and tell them you'll be a while longer. This is an emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Margo: You look at you, all up and out and stuff.",
        "Mike: I'm still hobbling.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. Give yourself a little credit. This is the second time this week Mike's been here.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you hear for the pancakes, hobble?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Katie's the pancake hound in this operation. I'm just her cover.",
        "Katie: Oh, nice. Where's Tom?",
        "Margo: He should be here any minute. I guess I should call him. But I left my phone on the desk. Can I borrow your cell phone?",
        "Katie: I left my purse in the car. I'll go get it, though. I shouldn't have my purse in the car. I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: Good, we have a minute alone. All right, I need your help. I need you to convince Katie to have a memorial service for Simon.",
        "Margo: A memorial service after all this time?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Why me?",
        "Mike: It sounds better coming from her sister than from her -- well, from me. You know, Katie needs to grieve for Simon in a formal way. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Margo: Mike Kasnoff, you amaze me. I do believe there isn't anything you wouldn't do for my little sister.",
        "Mike: Not that I can think of.",
        "Margo: You don't have a selfish bone in your body, do you?",
        "Mike: Believe me, Margo, my motives are entirely selfish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, no school this morning, huh?",
        "Will: No, it's staff improvement, or whatever they call it.",
        "Emily: So you have any plans?",
        "Will: Um -- uh, no, not really.",
        "Hal: Really? 'Cause the way you keep looking at your watch, I could swear you've got an appointment or something.",
        "[Will remembering]",
        "Barbara: Meet me tomorrow morning at the courtyard. And remember, it's our secret. Love, Mom.",
        "Will: No, I just wanted to know what time it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Nothing's gonna keep me from seeing you, Will -- not some restraining order or a hurricane or World War III -- or even Rose D'Angelo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Is this gonna take long?",
        "Jack: Well, that depends on you. Just got to ask you a few questions about Rose D'Angelo's car.",
        "Dusty: Well, somebody trashed her car, but not me. So why are you wasting my time?",
        "Jack: My wife is a bridesmaid at Rose's wedding. I just want to make sure there's a wedding for her to go to. So I'm gonna ask you again. You got any idea how Rose's car ended up being scrawled with death threats?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jack: You were there, Dusty. You had the opportunity.",
        "Dusty: Opportunity? What are you talking about? I saw the car at the same time she did. Besides, what are you -- why would I threaten Rose?",
        "Jack: You tell me.",
        "Dusty: Now you're insulting me. If you want to find somebody who threatened Rose, you talk to somebody who wants to harm her. You talk to Paul Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Paul?",
        "Rose: Hey.",
        "Crater: Good morning.",
        "Rose: Hey. Ooh. Um, have you seen Mr. Ryan this morning?",
        "Crater: He left out early, said he had some errands to run.",
        "Rose: Hmm, I didn't even hear him leave.",
        "Crater: Well, he didn't want to disturb you 'cause you had such a rough night.",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah. Thank you.",
        "Crater: Sure.",
        "Rose: That's not Mitzi's. Paul?",
        "[Rose sees a duffle bag on the floor]",
        "[Rose remembering]",
        "Paul: Whoever did this committed a felony.",
        "Dusty: Don't forget to ask him about the voice alternator that Molly found --",
        "Paul: Dusty, that's enough!",
        "Dusty: -- In his pocket!",
        "Rose: Nah, Rose, just cut it out.",
        "Paul: Hey, leave that alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Paul Ryan. Let's leave Paul Ryan out of this for now.",
        "Dusty: How you gonna leave him out of this when he's walking around with weird devices in his pocket? You know, the kind that keep you from getting busted when you want to play phone games.",
        "Jack: What -- what are you talking about, Dusty.",
        "Molly: Jack, I found a voice alternator in Paul's pocket.",
        "Jack: When?",
        "Molly: Just after Rose got that threatening call. And I told Dusty about it.",
        "Dusty: That's when I went to see Rose to tell her what a nut she was about to marry. And that's when we both discovered her trashed car at the same time.",
        "Jack: Okay, where is this voice alternator now?",
        "Molly: Paul has it. I guess. I don't know. I waved it in front of his face, told him what I thought he did with it, and he said that he bought it as a gift for Will or something.",
        "Dusty: Paul's been intentionally scaring Rose, so much so, that she has permitted him to hire a bodyguard to watch her every move.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause he's pathologically jealous. That's why.",
        "Jack: Frankly, Dusty, the idea that Paul would terrorize his fianc\u00e9e to keep her from stepping out on him is a bit of a stretch.",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Jack: Don't you think?",
        "Dusty: So is pretending you're dead so you can spy on your grieving family and friends. You know what your problem is? You still think Paul Ryan is the nice guy he used to be -- the guy everyone knows and loves. But we're dealing with a different guy, now. The guy who wants to punish everyone who ever did him wrong. The guy's a Stenbeck!",
        "Molly: Jack, what if he really is out to hurt Rose -- you know, to get her back for dumping him?",
        "Dusty: Believe me when I say, it's worth checking out.",
        "Molly: You have to, if for no other reason then because Rose is friends with Carly. And you said yourself, Carly wants this wedding to happen. So you got to make sure that nothing gets in the way.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, do it for your wife. And please, do it for Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: That doesn't belong to you.",
        "Rose: No, it doesn't. Are you hiding something from me?",
        "Paul: What are you looking for?",
        "Rose: Well, I thought it was Mitzi -- I'm not breaking a law here. I'm just, you know --",
        "Paul: It's just some stuff that I brought over from my house this morning.",
        "Rose: Oh.",
        "Paul: 'Cause I was hoping that you would ask me to spend the night again. What's wrong with you? You look rattled.",
        "Rose: Death threats will do that to you. I guess sleeping next to me was no joy. I mean, jumpin' around like a little jumping bean all night.",
        "Paul: It didn't help that Dusty accused me of making the phone calls and wrecking your car.",
        "Rose: No. But the thing that kept me up all night over and over in my head, he was talking about this voice alternator thing the Molly McKinnon found in your pocket. Why would he make up that up?",
        "Paul: Sour grapes. He can't have you, so he wants to make me out to be some kind of a monster.",
        "Rose: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. Is that what you were looking for? Some kind of voice changing thing?",
        "Rose: No, no. I just wanted to see whose bag it was. Just curious.",
        "Paul: You know, all right, I had really hoped to do this later tonight, but I know how your mind works, and I can hear you thinking about it from here. You're going to obsess all day about what was in my bag.",
        "Rose: You gonna help me out there, aren't you? Okay.",
        "Paul: Now I saw this in Paris and -- go ahead. I ordered it, and it just arrived today.",
        "Rose: Oh, what is it? It's beautiful. Oh, I know what it is. [Rose gasps] it's gorgeous. Thank you.",
        "Paul: I was hoping we could put our wedding pictures in it.",
        "Rose: Oh. Oh.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Rose: I just -- I just hope our wedding pictures are as beautiful as this album. Thank you. You didn't have to get me anything.",
        "Paul: I'll give you everything. All my love for the rest of our lives.",
        "Rose: You know, you keep treating me like this, I'm just gonna explode. And I think about this. I see this on a coffee table with all of our wedding pictures in it right there in Paris. And I think about that, and I forget about the car business like it never happened.",
        "Paul: Well, that's how it's supposed to be. Smooth sailing from now on.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Paul: Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi. I hope this is an okay time to do a fitting for the wedding dress.",
        "Rose: My wedding dress is in that bag?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh.",
        "Rose: My wedding dress is in that bag. [Phone rings] could you get the phone?",
        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Jack: Hey, it's Jack Snyder.",
        "Paul: Oh, hey, Jack. Carly just walked in with this huge garment bag over her shoulder. Hold on, I'll put her on.",
        "Jack: Actually, I want to talk to you.",
        "Paul: Oh, okay. When?",
        "Jack: How's now? Stay where you are, I'll be right over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So what's going on with Will?",
        "Hal: I don't know. I had this nagging feeling yesterday, but I let it go. Emily, when you were at Al's last night with Will, were you with him the whole time?",
        "Emily: Yeah. I mean, except when I took Daniel to the ladies' room. Why?",
        "Hal: \"Will -- meet me tomorrow morning at the courtyard. And remember, it's our secret. Love, Mom.\"",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. She delivered that while I was in the ladies' room? I didn't see anyone.",
        "Hal: Who knows, Emily. Maybe she had somebody else deliver it for her. But at least it explains why the kid's on pins and needles this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Yes, something came up. Something urgent. But I'll get there as soon as I can. So, do you want some coffee or something?",
        "Lucy: No, I don't want some coffee. I just want an answer from you. How did you end up in bed with Aaron?",
        "Alison: Well, it's not really something that I can -- it just happened.",
        "Lucy: You know, my mom used to say \"things don't just happen all by themselves. People make choices and follow through on them.\" Whose choice was it?",
        "Alison: You know, please, Lucy, don't put me in this position.",
        "Lucy: You put yourself in this position, Alison. God knows you waited long enough for your big chance. Who started it? You or Aaron?",
        "Alison: It is none of your damn business!",
        "Alison: Maybe every move that you make is planned, Lucy. But the rest of us? We just put one foot in front of the other and things happen. And the thing that happened? It is between me and Aaron.",
        "Lucy: I loved Aaron. And he lied to me. Do you have any idea what that feels like? I trusted him, and I fought for him.",
        "Alison: And I'm sorry, honest. In fact, right now, I wish I'd never even met either one of you.",
        "Lucy: Why can't you just give me an answer?",
        "Alison: I can't make it okay that Aaron and I slept together. So what am I supposed to say? That I was so upset about breaking up with Chris that I lured Aaron into my room and I strapped him on the bed and made him to do it with me? If that'll make you feel better, then that's what happened.",
        "Lucy: Is that your answer? To make fun of all of this? Is this a joke to you?",
        "Alison: Believe me, nothing is a joke to me. Life is just about as serious as it gets. But you wouldn't understand that. And I really have to go, so just leave. I have to get to work, okay?",
        "Lucy: We're not finished!",
        "Alison: Yes, we are! Ow!",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: I can't -- I can't -- if anything happens, this is all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: How can you say that you feel that you're being selfish by wanting Katie to have a memorial for Simon? I mean, most guys would be afraid that it would bring up a lot of old feeling for her.",
        "Mike: I'm a little scared, too, all right? But if Simon's death stays open- ended for her, she won't be free to even think about me.",
        "Margo: Usually, I would be the first person to say that Katie's got to do this ritual good-bye thing because it puts closure on everything. But I don't know. Maybe -- maybe she hasn't had a service for Simon because she wants to deal with his death on her own privately.",
        "Mike: If that were true, I'd honor it. All right? But I think the reason that she hasn't had a service is because she's been so caught up with me. You know, we came back and then, boom, the accident. You know, and taking care of me has been such a big job, she hasn't had a chance to mourn.",
        "Margo: Do you think that she feels like she's still married?",
        "Mike: Yeah. And short of encouraging her to have an official good-bye, I don't know what will ever change that.",
        "Katie: Tom, hey.",
        "Tom: Hey. I thought I was going to be late.",
        "Katie: No, no, Margo's inside. I just had to get my purse. But can I ask you a question before we go inside?",
        "Tom: Sure.",
        "Katie: This is going to sound a little weird, but what do I do about my marriage to Simon? I mean, are we still married legally? Or do I have to do something to officially become a widow?",
        "Tom: Well, your tax status has changed. There may be some insurance issues. But as far as some legal procedure to make you officially single, well, you already are. I mean, you're totally free.",
        "Katie: If only it were that simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Will?",
        "Hal: You know, I didn't think it was possible that you could make things any worse for yourself, Barbara. But you found a way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack is on his way over here? What is he doing? Following me around?",
        "Paul: Well, I think he just wants to ask some questions about what happened to Rose's car.",
        "Carly: Oh. Yeah. I'm -- he told me about that. I'm sorry, I was so excited about the dress, I forgot to ask. How are you doing? Are you okay?",
        "Rose: I'm great. Are you kidding me? I grew up with graffiti, you know that.",
        "Carly: Jack said that it was more than just spray paint, Rose.",
        "Paul: You know Rose, she doesn't want anyone to know she's scared.",
        "Carly: I hope Jack gets to the bottom of it.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm gonna wait outside for him; leave you girls to do your do wedding dress thing.",
        "Carly: Rose?",
        "Rose: Yeah?",
        "Rose: I'm okay.",
        "Carly: -- It's a lot to handle.",
        "Rose: I know, I've got, you know, Crater the bodyguard watching over me. I got Paul watching my every single move. There's nothing to worry about. I don't want to talk about it. I want to talk about a wedding dress. That's what I want to do. Let me see.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right.",
        "Rose: Oh. It's -- it's unbelievable. It's -- like belongs in a bridal magazine. It's absolutely perfect. It's even better than we talked about that. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Carly: Do you like it? I'm so glad that you like it.",
        "Rose: I just want to try it on. I can't believe it. Can you believe it? The two of us happy? You're married to Jack. I'm marrying the greatest guy in the world that -- I never, ever thought -- me marrying a guy like that? Not me, not my luck, right? I gotta show you the presents that Paul got for me for our wedding pictures.",
        "Carly: Wow.",
        "Rose: Huh? Isn't that gorgeous?",
        "Carly: Oh, Rose, that is so pretty.",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Where'd he get this? I've never seen anything like it.",
        "Rose: That's my Paul. He's got great taste.",
        "Carly: Well, yes, he does. That's why he's marrying you. No, don't. I didn't mean to make you cry, Rose.",
        "Rose: It's just that everything's coming together. You know, it's like my dream is finally gonna come true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, Crater, I want you to do me a little favor.",
        "Crater: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Yeah, when the cops ask, and they will ask, where I was, I want you to tell them that I was with you when Rose's car was vandalized.",
        "Crater: I don't get it.",
        "Paul: Well, you know, I was -- I had my car all alone. It's not just much of an alibi.",
        "Crater: You asking me to lie for you, Mr. Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yes, I am. I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As The World Turns\" --",
        "Hal: But you actually did it, didn't ya?",
        "Barbara: Did what?",
        "Hal: You're the one who threatened Rose's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Your mother and I agreed that we have to have that knee x-rayed.",
        "Katie: You can't x-ray her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: There. See, you're okay. Nothing's broken. What hurts?",
        "Alison: No, it's my knee. I can't put any weight on it.",
        "Lucy: Is that what you meant when you said if something bad happens, it's all my fault? You want to send me your knee surgery bill?",
        "Alison: Nothing, just forget it. Ow!",
        "Susan: Alison? What is going on? Your supervisor told me you had an emergency. What happened?",
        "Alison: Not much just attempted murder.",
        "Susan: Uh-oh.",
        "Lucy: Alison fell and hurt her knee.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "Alison: Oh, fell? Right.",
        "Susan: I'm taking you to the hospital right now. We need to get this looked at.",
        "Alison: Ow.",
        "Susan: Just stay off it. Stay off it. Okay. Okay. Take your time. Oh, Alison. Alison.",

        "Dusty: Look, I'm sorry, whatever I did to lead Aaron astray. Shut the door on your way out. Have a good day.",
        "Aaron: Dusty, look, wait --",
        "Dusty: No, buddy, I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind.",
        "Holden: Dusty, Aaron would like to have his old job back. And I'm here to tell you that it's okay with me.",
        "Dusty: Kid, you want your job back?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you thought I was a pretty good worker, right?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course, I did. But I don't need your old man looking over my shoulder, you know?",
        "Holden: Hey, as long as you keep him out of anything illegal, I'll stay out of your business.",
        "Aaron: That's not gonna be a problem, right, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: No, no problem. I do have some boxes that need to be unpacked.",
        "Aaron: Great. Look, give me as many hours as you can possibly give me.",
        "Dusty: Mm-hmm. What about your girlfriend?",
        "Aaron: Lucy? Um -- a non-issue.",
        "Dusty: Good. Start on those boxes tomorrow.",
        "Aaron: Thanks a lot. You're not gonna regret this, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Molly: Hey, is that Holden here with Aaron?",
        "Dusty: Yep. It's a regular Snyder reunion here today. And unless I've been smokin' something, Holden just gave me his blessings for his kid to work here again.",
        "Molly: You're kidding me? That's great. That's like a really good sign.",
        "Dusty: I don't trust signs.",
        "Molly: No, no, no, think about it. If Holden's willing to give you and this place a second chance, then maybe Jack will back off.",
        "Dusty: Because I'm not worried about Jack. My alibi's solid. I am worried about Rose.",
