        "[Rosanna yawns]",
        "Rosanna: I'm exhausted.",
        "Craig: Yeah? Well, I hope Lucy appreciates it.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I know. I know buying prezzies doesn't exactly mend a broken heart, but it's we can really do for her right now. Excuse me, sweetheart. I mean, she's just devastated over breaking up with Aaron.",
        "Craig: Oh, it'll only hurt for a little while. After a month or so, she'll forget he even existed.",
        "Rosanna: Stop.",
        "Craig: What? Six months?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Craig: A year?",
        "Rosanna: Dream on. Dream on.",
        "Craig: Ah, Emily, running away from home? Huh?",
        "Emily: No, no, no. This is Will and Hal's tuxedos for Rose's wedding.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, lovely, is everything still on schedule?",
        "Emily: Yeah, actually, I think so. Which at this point is a minor miracle.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, why's that?",
        "Emily: You haven't heard? Someone smashed Rose's car and left a death threat on the hood.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, do they know who it was?",
        "Emily: No, but the police are on it. And you know that Paul hired that bodyguard for Rose? Anyway, I'm gonna go grab a seat at the counter. Hal's going to be here.",
        "Craig: You think Bar-bar's doing body work?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, certainly sounds like it.",
        "Paul: Molly's right. I'm the one who called Rose to threaten her.",
        "Craig: What are you doing?",
        "Rosanna: Calling Paul Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: This is from the electrician. He actually charged us to put -- why aren't you listening to me?",
        "Dusty: Rose is gonna marry Paul in two days. That means somehow, between now and then, I gotta prove to her that he's dangerous.",
        "Molly: Would you stop worrying? We have offered Rose's bodyguard a huge bonus to find proof that Paul is the one terrorizing her. If it's out there, he'll find it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Dress? Check. Rings? Check. Minister? Check. A ride back to your place? Check. And after the rehearsal tomorrow -- oh, everything after that is just --",
        "Mitzi: Rose, I just saw your car outside. What happened?",
        "Rose: I guess I'm not as popular as I used to be. What happened to you last night? You get abducted by aliens again?",
        "Mitzi: No, I spent the night at the Roller Palace. I just needed some time alone.",
        "Rose: To do what?",
        "Mitzi: Personal stuff. Ya mind?",
        "Paul: A little. You could've called. Rose was really worried.",
        "Mitzi: What are you both ganging up on me now?",
        "Paul: Mm-mm. Just asking you a few questions, that's all.",
        "Mitzi: You two think I had something to do with trashing that car out there? Well, go ahead. Why don't you just say it?",
        "Rose: I would never, ever, ever think that, Mitzi. Ever. You know something about it, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I can't believe it. You're pregnant, aren't you?",
        "Susan: Alison? Are you really pregnant?",
        "Alison: Just go away. All of you. Just leave me alone.",
        "Susan: Honey -- I -- I just want to help you. Please tell me what's going on.",
        "Alison: It's true. I'm pregnant. I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean for this to happen.",
        "Susan: Its okay, baby. It's okay. Its okay, I'm glad it came out. You shouldn't be going through this alone.",
        "Bob: Look, I know this is a difficult time, but I have to ask. Does Chris know that you're pregnant?",
        "Susan: Bob, this is no time to be grilling her.",
        "Bob: Well, I'm not exactly grilling her, Susan. But if Chris is going to be a father, he has a right to know.",
        "Susan: Have you said anything to Chris about this?",
        "Bob: Well, then it's about time. Look, if this child is his responsibility, he's gonna want to help any way he can.",
        "[Remembering]",
        "Chris: It wasn't anything you've done.",
        "Alison: It has to be. Otherwise, you wouldn't be dumping me.",
        "Chris: No, Alison, it's not. I just -- we're not right together.",
        "Alison: The baby's not his.",
        "Bob: Are you sure?",
        "Lucy: Then whose is it?",
        "Alison: Aaron's.",
        "Aaron: What's going on?",
        "Lucy: How could you do this to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hi, sweetie, it's Mom. Listen, I've just been out buying a few presents for my favorite guy, and I can't remember the name of that computer game you want.",
        "Hal: Who're you talking to?",
        "Will: Mom. She wants to get me a video game.",
        "Hal: The restraining order was very specific. You're not to contact Will without permission.",
        "Barbara: I just want to buy a few presents for my son. Would you deny me that pleasure, Hal?",
        "Hal: Fine. You drop them off at the station. I will see that he gets them. But no more calls unless we schedule them first.",
        "Barbara: You know, I really can't understand how you can do this to me. After everything that we have been through together, everything we've meant to each other.",
        "Hal: Good-bye, Barbara. Who is it?",
        "Kim: It's Kim.",
        "Hal: Hi.",
        "Kim: Hi! Hi, I'm sorry. Am I intruding?",
        "Hal: Never.",
        "Kim: Oh, good. Well, I was in the neighborhood and thought I could -- hi, darling -- stop by and see the kids. So, where's Daniel?",
        "Hal: Oh, he's at the playground with his babysitter. They should be back any minute if you want to wait.",
        "Kim: Oh. Okay, why not. Give me a chance to visit with Will. Kiddo, I haven't seen you for such a long time. Well --",
        "Hal: Hey. What are you doing?",
        "Will: I don't feel like visiting.",

        "Craig: I thought we were having lunch.",
        "Rosanna: We are, sweetheart. I just need to get in touch with Paul.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: You heard what Emily said. I just want to make sure that he's all right.",
        "Craig: The threats were for Rose, not Paul.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Paul is my friend. And when friends are in trouble, the appropriate thing to do is to reach out to them.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. You want to know what I think.",
        "Rosanna: Not particularly.",
        "Craig: Oh. Rosanna have a thing for Paul?",
        "Rosanna: I am not having this conversation again.",
        "Craig: What? Where are you going?",
        "Rosanna: I'm going to make my little phone call in private.",
        "[Craig groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: The first I knew about that car getting trashed was two minutes ago when I came in here. And if you don't believe that, Rose, then we have a serious problem.",
        "Rose: Hey, well, okay. I hate to tell you, but we got a serious problem already. I don't even know you anymore, Mitzi.",
        "Mitzi: Funny, I feel the same about you.",
        "Rose: Okay, I'm sorry. I truly am sorry. I never should have suggested that maybe you knew something about what happened to the car. I apologize.",
        "Mitzi: Thank you.",
        "Rose: But you gotta admit, I mean, this is not coming out of nowhere. All right? For a little while now, you look like -- look at you in the face. Like you did something bad.",
        "Mitzi: Well, I can think of one bad thing I did. Coming back here to talk to you.",
        "Rose: Oh, that's not --",
        "Paul: Hold on a second, everybody just relax. I think we're just all a little on edge.",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, why don't you talk to your fianc\u00e9e about that, okay? I'm gonna go to my room and pretend this conversation never happened.",
        "Rose: She's hiding something. I know it. I can feel it. I know it.",
        "Paul: Give me your hands. You and I are getting married in two days. All right? So whatever's going on between you and Mitzi, you need to just let it go.",
        "Rose: Okay. [Phone rings] let that go.",
        "Paul: I gotta get it. Hello.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, it's Rosanna. Hello. Do you think you could meet me in the Lakeview lounge? Say in half an hour?",
        "Paul: Yeah, everything all right?",
        "Rosanna: Um, I need to talk to you.",
        "Paul: I'll be right there.",
        "Rosanna: Thanks. Sweetheart, I have to go.",
        "Craig: Where?",
        "Rosanna: I have to meet Paul for a quick drink.",
        "Craig: Oh, I like to drink. Mind if I come?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I do. You'll only goad him into an argument.",
        "Craig: About what? Cold cream?",
        "Rosanna: Ha, ha, very funny. Look, I'll only be a little while. Why don't you wait for me here? I'll meet you.",
        "Craig: Oh, what does it really matter where I am? You have Paul now. I can just retire to the shadows, weep my sad soul empty and --",
        "Rosanna: I don't take you seriously anymore. I thought you knew that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Oh, I've cleaned up the coffee cups. It's time for us to go for a little walk. You know? A little walk? A little stroll?",
        "Paul: I would love to. But I got some errands I gotta run before the wedding.",
        "Rose: Oh, the wedding. Okay. All right. I guess we can go for our walks in Paris. Oh, I can't wait till then.",
        "Paul: You got it.",
        "Rose: Errands.",
        "Paul: I'll make sure Crater's right outside that door.",
        "Rose: Okay. All right. Where are you going?",
        "Mitzi: It's time for me to get out of here, Rose.",
        "Rose: Where to?",
        "Mitzi: Back to A.C. After that, who knows?",
        "Rose: What about my wedding? I always expected you to be there.",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, me too.",
        "Rose: I want you to tell me what's going on. Because I've been trying to figure it out and nothing is making sense to me.",

        "[Crater finds gloves and baseball bat in Paul's car trunk and hides them in the bushes]",
        "Paul: Crater, where are you?",
        "Crater: Over here, Mr. Ryan.",
        "Paul: What are you doing out here?",
        "Crater: Oh, I thought I heard somebody sniffing around. Turned out it was just a couple of deer.",
        "Paul: I'm going out for awhile. You do not leave the front door.",
        "Crater: Yes, sir. Mr. Ryan, if you need me to lie to the cops again, just say the word.",
        "Paul: That won't be necessary. I don't lie to the police on a regular basis.",
        "Crater: Just wanted you to know.",

        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Dusty: I'm telling you, the referee was definitely in on it. The tight end steps out of bounds in front of 70,000 fans; he's the only one who doesn't see it? Huh?",
        "Molly: Metro. Yeah, just a minute. Dusty, it's important.",
        "Dusty: More important than -- who is it?",
        "Molly: Crater.",
        "Dusty: What have you got?",
        "Crater: I found the bat that was used to trash Rose's car.",
        "Dusty: Where did you find it?",
        "Crater: In the trunk of Paul Ryan's car.",
        "Dusty: Stay there. I want to see it myself. You were right. Crater found proof that it was Paul that smashed up Rose's car. I got him. I got him. And this time, I'm putting him away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Lucy, what's the matter? What did I do?",
        "Alison: Just leave him alone! He doesn't know.",
        "Aaron: Doesn't know what?",
        "Alison: That I'm pregnant, and the baby is yours. I just found out a few days ago, and I was going to tell you. I just didn't have a good time.",
        "Bob: Look, I've got stuff to do. You want me to stick around?",
        "Susan: No, that's okay.",
        "Bob: Alison, I'm sure that sharing this in front of an audience is not exactly what you had in mind. But your mother knows now, and you know that you can rely on her. Now, both of you are going to need the support of your families right now.",
        "Aaron: Lucy, I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: Is that all you can say?",
        "Aaron: What do you want me to say?",
        "Lucy: Nothing.",
        "Katie: This was a mistake, Lucy. They didn't mean for this to happen.",
        "Lucy: You knew Alison was pregnant? I'm your niece, Katie. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Katie: Well, because Alison has only known for just a short time, and I didn't want to bother her while she was trying to figure out what to do. And besides, she never mentioned that Aaron was the father.",
        "Lucy: Well, I hope that your baby is born healthy and has a great life. But I never want to see either of you again.",
        "Aaron: Luce -- Lucy, wait. I can't just let her walk away like that. Listen, I'm gonna be back real soon, okay?",
        "Susan: No, you wait a second. You're going to be a father. That's serious business. Playtime is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, I saw Will again this morning. He looked miserable.",
        "Hal: Well, he loves his mother, Emily. It's all he can think about.",
        "Emily: And what? That's your fault?",
        "Hal: Hey, I took out the restraining order.",
        "Emily: You had no choice. Barbara's the guilty one, not you.",
        "Hal: Well, I doubt that's how Will sees it. But I'm not gonna try to change his mind. All I can do is assure him that his mother is okay and surround him with people who love him. That's all I can do.",
        "Emily: Well, if you ask me, I think you're handling it brilliantly. Now, the only question is whether or not she's gonna try to arrange another secret meeting with him.",
        "Hal: Oh, no, no. No, that's not gonna happen.",
        "Emily: How do you know?",
        "Hal: Because Barbara has a new man in her life, and he's very devoted.",
        "Barbara: Where's Dusty?",
        "Molly: He just left. Are you all right?",
        "Barbara: There's a man following me in a black coat, and -- that's him. Right there. Would you please call Dusty? 'Cause he'll know what to do.",
        "Molly: So do I. Excuse me. This woman says that you've been following her. Is she right?",
        "Bennet: Yes ma'am.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God. The assassin said that someone had to die. It's me, isn't it? Is that why you're here?",
        "Molly: Barbara, what are you talking about?",
        "Bennet: Maybe I should explain. I'm Officer Bennet of the OPD. Lieutenant Munson ordered me to keep an eye on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Show me what you got.",
        "Crater: I found these in the trunk of Ryan's car. Look at the paint. Same color as Rose's car.",
        "Dusty: Why are we touching this stuff?",
        "Crater: Doesn't matter, he was wearing these. Look at them. They're full of glass. He must have had 'em on when he was busting up the windows.",
        "Dusty: All right, put 'em back in Paul's trunk.",
        "Crater: What?",
        "Dusty: Don't let him see you.",
        "Crater: I thought you wanted to bust him?",
        "Dusty: When I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: The last time we spoke, you told me that you had made a threatening phone call to Rose in the hopes that you could better protect her.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Rosanna: Did you ever tell her it was you?",
        "Paul: Well, that is what I said I would do, isn't it? Why?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I just heard about the death threat written on Rose's car. And don't hate me for this, but I figured if you were desperate enough to scare her once --",
        "Paul: Then I might be willing to do something like that again.",
        "Rosanna: I hope I'm wrong. Because if you are that out of control, I'm going to have to insist that you get help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As The World Turns\" --",
        "Rosanna: I know you're spying on me.",

        "Chris: Why do I get the feeling you have something to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Do you think Alison's telling the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm not concerned with making Rose feel bad. I want her to tell me that she's finished with Paul.",
        "Aaron: Alison how did this happen? We only did it once.",
        "Alison: Guess that's all it takes.",
        "Aaron: I'm not ready to be a father, Ali. What are we going to do?",
        "Susan: Honey, I have to get a leg brace from the supply room, and then we'll go home. It's gonna be okay. I'm not sure how, but we'll do it.",
        "Alison: Thank you. I'm not gonna force you into anything. This is my fault; I'll take care of it.",
        "Katie: I don't think you need to have this discussion now, okay? Aaron, why don't you go and call Holden and Lily and tell them what's going on.",
        "Aaron: Oh, man --",
        "Katie: I know, but the longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be, believe me.",
        "Aaron: Um, listen -- look, we're gonna get through this, okay? I am not gonna bail on you.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Katie: You told me it was Chris.",
        "Alison: I was wrong.",
        "Katie: You never even mentioned that it could be Aaron.",
        "Alison: Well, he's so in love with Lucy. I didn't want to get him involved.",
        "Katie: Okay, Alison. I understand that you're scared right now, but if you just tell me the truth, maybe I can help.",

        "Kim: Hi. Is everything all right? You sounded so urgent on the phone.",
        "Bob: Oh, I didn't mean to worry you, but something came up today, and I thought we should discuss it in person.",
        "Kim: It's nothing about your health, is it?",
        "Bob: No, no. Alison Stewart is pregnant.",
        "Kim: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, is Chris the father?",
        "Bob: No. Aaron Snyder.",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Bob: According to Alison, Chris doesn't know anything about it.",
        "Kim: Oh, oh, thank God. For a minute I thought maybe that's why he left Oakdale.",
        "Bob: Well, hopefully, he wouldn't do that. But I got to tell you, I was really relieved when Alison said it wasn't his child.",
        "Kim: Yeah, yeah. Me, too. Oh, my gosh. But this could still be a mess. I mean, Chris still cares for Alison. He's gonna find out. When he does, it's gonna suck him in even deeper. And if there's any question, any doubt in his mind as to whether that's his child, you know Chris, he'll never let it go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why are you having me followed?",
        "Hal: Because given your history, you're a prime suspect in the death threats against Rose D'Angelo. Now, I discussed the matter with Tom Hughes, and he agreed that you should have surveillance.",
        "Barbara: That is a lie. The only reason you're having me watched is to make sure that I don't see Will.",
        "Hal: But that would be in defiance of your restraining order, Barbara. And I know you'd never do that. .",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: I can't get into the details, Rose. All I can tell you is I can't keep living under your roof.",
        "Rose: No, no, no, there's something else. Something is wrong here, and I'm not gonna let you leave until you tell me what it is.",
        "Mitzi: Please just don't make this harder than it already is, all right? Let's just say good-bye, and -- I gotta get outta here.",
        "Rose: Come on, Mitzi!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: And an iced tea for the lady.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Waiter: Anything else?",
        "Paul: No, you know what; I think we're done here. Thanks. I am not out of control, and I did not write a death threat on Rose's car. Thank you for thinking of me, though. Here's to you.",
        "Rosanna: You're angry at me now, aren't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well -- look, I know where you're coming from is a -- it's a good place, but that phone call I made was a one time thing. I'll never do anything like that again.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. That's all I needed to hear, okay? Come on, how are plans for the wedding?",
        "Paul: Oh, they're great. Yeah. No, everything's right on track.",
        "Rosanna: Excellent.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rosanna: Has your mother stopped harassing you?",
        "Paul: Mm, I don't know. I'm not listening anymore.",
        "Rosanna: Good for you. That sounds healthy.",
        "Paul: No, it's great. I'm not listening to Dusty or Barbara or Jennifer or anybody else who doesn't whole-heartedly support me getting married.",
        "Rosanna: Good. How about your father?",
        "Paul: Oh, you remember.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, well, you did tell me that you were hearing voices. That's not the kind of information someone forgets.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, Ii still hear the old man whispering every now and then. Telling me I should be wanting revenge against Dusty and Rose. But I'm strong now. I can just kind of push it out of my head.",
        "Rosanna: Good. If you and Rose can rise above all the things that you've had coming against you, then you'll be great. You know, you'll really belong together.",
        "Paul: Thank you. But we should go. Rose is waiting.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Paul: See you later.",

        "Craig: Bob, what a pleasant surprise.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I saw you sitting there. I know you're spying on me.",
        "Craig: Actually I'm just wrapping up a meeting here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really, about what?",
        "Craig: Oh, a little bar business, liquidity, you know.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, very quick, very quick, yes. Sweetheart, if you're going to play the jealous husband, you can at least be honest about it.",

        "Barbara: You'll regret this, Hal. I will tell Will that you're having me trailed like a common criminal, and he will hate you for the rest of his life.",
        "Hal: You know what; I have more confidence in him than that, Barbara. Maybe if you did, too, we wouldn't be at war.",
        "Barbara: You think we're at war now? Wait.",
        "Emily: Listen to me. Listen, Will could never hate you, no matter what she says to him.",
        "Hal: Emily, I don't know how we got to this point. I mean, I love my son. All I want for him is to be happy and feel secure in his life, and yet I can't make that happen. Everything I try keeps blowing up in my face.",
        "Emily: I know. Rosanna. Back so soon?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. I have a weakness for the chocolate chip cookies. My whole family does. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?",
        "Lucy: Dad said the two of you would be here.",
        "Rosanna: What's going on? What's the matter?",

        "Katie: So, you're not sure whose it is?",
        "Alison: You wanted the truth. That's it.",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. Then why tell Aaron and not Chris?",
        "Alison: Because I don't want to be \"the slut who ruined the doctor's life.\"",
        "Katie: No one would call you that.",
        "Alison: But that's what I would be. If Chris had to give up his dream job because I got pregnant, everyone would hate me.",
        "Katie: Okay, I understand that you want to be fair to Chris. But what about Aaron? You just told him he's gonna be a father and he may not even be the father of this baby.",
        "Alison: I'll take care of it, okay?",
        "Katie: How? Why don't you just tell them both the whole story?",

        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Susan: I'm with you, kid. Don't you ever forget that.",

        "Rose: Hey, what? Oh, come on, how can you say that?",
        "Paul: Rose, you guys have been fighting for months. I don't think you need the aggravation.",
        "Rose: I got to tell ya, when she just left, we weren't fighting. She was like sad. I think she's in trouble.",
        "Paul: Why do you say that?",
        "Rose: I don't know. It's like she wanted to tell me something, like she was -- like she did somethin' that she's ashamed of.",

        "Aaron: Of course, I believe Alison. What kind of question is that?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, she's been dating Chris for a while, doesn't that give you, I don't know, some doubts?",
        "Aaron: Katie, we didn't use any protection. I mean, Chris is a doctor. He would not make a stupid mistake like this.",
