        "Katie: Okay, Maddie, where is that shoe? This is definitely Henry's shoe.",
        "Mike: Something told me I'd find you here.",
        "Katie: Mike, you scared me. I was just turning in these purchase requisitions for the new exercise mats I need for the show.",
        "Mike: Purchase requisitions?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Hasn't it gotten ridiculously bureaucratic around here?",
        "Mike: I wouldn't know any more about how it works around here than you would know about requisitions.",
        "Katie: I know what they are. I shop.",
        "Mike: But do you do paperwork? Be honest. You think Maddie was right. You think B.J. did something to Henry. And even though I asked you not to get involved, you were here looking for clues.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: B.J. did the same thing to Mike to get him out of the way.",
        "Casey: I'm lost. Topic sentence? Theme?",
        "Maddie: The wine cellar at Fairwinds. B.J. had Henry lock Mike in there when he wanted to get him out of the way at the Halloween party.",
        "Casey: So you think that's where your brother is?",
        "Maddie: Well, it makes sense, doesn't it? The way Henry was telling me to stop \"whining.\" Like I was -- I wasn't even whining!",
        "Casey: Why wouldn't he just say it, \"Maddie, I'm in the wine cellar at Fairwinds.\"",
        "Maddie: How was he supposed to do that if B.J. is standing over him?",
        "Casey: That's a stretch.",
        "Maddie: Yeah?",
        "Casey: Whoa! Where are you're going?",
        "Maddie: Duh. The wine cellar, where else?",
        "Casey: You're not going anywhere near that place, not if I have anything to say about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: So, Maddie really believes I'm okay?",
        "B.J.: She took the bait like a hungry fish.",
        "Henry: What proof did you send her?",
        "B.J.: An irresistible little gift from her big brother. You couldn't have convinced her any better in person.",
        "Henry: That's a good idea, B.J. I should convince her in person. I could just tell her that I came back from Palo Alto as if nothing had ever happened. It's not too late.",
        "B.J.: Right. And you wouldn't open your mouth to Maddie about where you've been?",
        "Henry: No, why would I upset her like that? You know, with the exception of having my spine realigned by the amazing Amazon, really, how have I suffered?",
        "B.J.: And what about Katie, hmm? I've seen you turn to jelly around her. You would just blurt out the truth.",
        "Henry: Yes, I would just blurt out the truth. I'd tell her that I have been staying in B.J.'s mansion. That's the truth, isn't it? I wouldn't have to go any further than that. Unless you've hurt Mike, and you say you didn't? He really is okay?",
        "B.J.: Why do you care?",
        "Henry: Because Katie loves him.",
        "B.J.: How could she love what doesn't exist?",
        "Henry: Oh. No, you didn't -- no, you couldn't, B.J. --",
        "B.J.: Given enough provocation? You'd be surprised what a person could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You're telling me somebody tried to poison my mom?",
        "Bob: From what the lab technician said, she ingested a chemical not typically seen in a poison case.",
        "Gwen: Does she know?",
        "Bob: No, no, I haven't said anything to her, because she was obviously in pretty bad shape when you brought her in. But I thought you should know.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm glad you told me, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: It appears that Rose ingested a chemical poison called methanol. Apparently, Will put it in her mouthwash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I just don't understand. Why would somebody do something like that?",
        "Bob: I don't know. But, when we get the report from toxicology, it should tell us what the substance is, and hopefully that will give us some clues.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. My head is kind of spinning right now. Is there something that I should do?",
        "Bob: Well, I think it would be advisable for you to do some blood work, make sure that you haven't been exposed to something harmful yourself.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Do I do that at the hospital?",
        "Bob: Yeah. You come by later, I'll set it up with the lab. Listen, I'm really sorry, Gwen, to give you this unfortunate news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: Iris, if you have a feeling that your illness isn't an accident --",
        "Iris: I've got a feeling, all right. It's in the pit of my stomach.",
        "Cass: You're saying you think somebody intentionally tried to hurt you?",
        "Iris: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Cass: But who? And what's their motive?",
        "Iris: I don't know, but I got a few ideas.",
        "Cass: If you want to follow up on these accusations, I need a name.",
        "Will: Go on. Tell him who you think is capable of trying to kill you. I dare you.",
        "Iris: What are you buttin' in on my business for?",
        "Will: Tell him, Iris. Tell Cass who you think's capable of trying to poison you.",
        "Cass: Well?",
        "Will: She's embarrassed. I mean, who wants to admit that the person trying to do you in is the guy you share a bottle with? Right, Iris?",
        "Cass: Is this true?",
        "Iris: Not in a million years! Stan would never doing anything to hurt me. And you shut your mouth about Stan!",
        "Will: The guy's bad news, Iris.",
        "Iris: Oh, you're such a good judge of character, are you?",
        "Will: All I know is that if he put you in danger, then he could put Gwen and the baby in danger, too.",
        "Iris: Oh, yeah, I get it. You're trying to find another thing to use against me and that social worker.",
        "Will: This isn't about you. This is about Gwen and Billy and making sure they're safe.",
        "Iris: Oh, they are plenty safe. And Stan would never do anything that he's accusing him of.",
        "Cass: Well, if it isn't your boyfriend --",
        "Iris: He's not my boyfriend!",
        "Cass: If it isn't your friend, then who are you saying did this to you?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you think you can meet me at Java?",
        "Will: Sure, when?",
        "Gwen: Now?",
        "Will: You okay?",
        "Gwen: I will be, when you get here.",
        "Will: Well, I'm on my way. Here's the insurance policy you wanted.",
        "Iris: Was that my Gwennie? Is she okay?",
        "Will: If you care about your daughter so much, Iris, ditch the loser.",
        "Iris: Yeah, I plan on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You can tell I made up the requisition form thing?",
        "Mike: When I first met you, you were a better liar. Why don't you tell me what's going on?",
        "Katie: Okay, you were right. I was worried about Henry. I think something terrible might have happened to him, so I came here to figure out what it was.",
        "Mike: So what did you find?",
        "Katie: His shoe. Just where Maddie said it would be.",
        "Mike: So you turned yourself into a private eye, even though we agreed that we weren't going to get involved in this?",
        "Katie: But if something happened to Henry --",
        "Mike: Okay, that's just the thing, Katie -- \"if.\" We don't know for sure that he was taken away against his own will. For all we know, he could be wine- tasting at the California coast.",
        "Katie: I don't believe that any more than Maddie does. Especially now that I found this.",
        "Mike: How does finding Henry's shoe prove anything?",
        "Katie: I don't know yet. But it means something. I mean, who loses a shoe and doesn't ever come back to get it?",
        "Mike: A guy who works for a billionaire? Henry's got money now. Maybe he doesn't need that shoe.",
        "Katie: All right, well, anyway, what kind of friend would I be if I didn't at least check it out?",
        "Mike: There's nothing to check out. It's a shoe. Case closed.",
        "Katie: Not if I take it to Margo.",
        "Mike: What's Margo going to do?",
        "Mike: Okay, okay, that could mean B.J. found the shoe and put it in the filing cabinet until Henry could come claim it.",
        "Katie: Or that he dragged Henry out of here kicking and screaming.",
        "Mike: Why would he do that?",
        "Katie: Because maybe Henry found out about his underworld activities.",
        "Mike: Okay, it's \"alleged\" activities.",
        "Katie: And B.J. had to make sure that Henry wouldn't talk.",
        "Mike: Jack said the FBI wasn't even sure that B.J. had done anything dicey. Only that his father had. Don't turn a lost shoe into a criminal conspiracy.",
        "Katie: What if it is a conspiracy?",
        "Mike: Then I don't want you anywhere near it.",
        "Katie: Even if it means saving Henry's life?",
        "Mike: Oh, how many years have you been saving Henry's life? Let it go.",
        "Katie: I cannot believe you just said that. I thought Henry was supposed to be your friend?",
        "Mike: Was.",
        "Katie: You still haven't forgiven him?",
        "Mike: It's not whether or not I can forgive Henry or not.",
        "Katie: Honey, I understand that you're mad that he locked you in that wine cellar on Halloween. I get that. But it's like you want him to pay now. That's why you don't me to find out what happened to him.",
        "Mike: That's not it.",
        "Katie: Then why can't you forgive him?",
        "Mike: It's not Henry I can't forgive, Katie, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Listen to me. Katie loves Mike and she will never forgive you if you hurt him.",
        "B.J.: I haven't hurt him yet, so please save the grief.",
        "Henry: Why don't you save the arrogance? All right? Even if you got rid of Mike, do you think that Katie would turn to you?",
        "B.J.: Yes, she'll need consoling.",
        "Henry: From whom? From the guy who made her pretend it was her high school prom again? I don't think so. I think what she's going to want to do, for the rest of her life, is dress in black and mourn her one true love.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, you may be right. But, you know what, after a brief period of time, she'll wake up one day and she'll realize how much better she would be and how much happier she would be with me. And all the money in the world to distract her from her pain.",
        "Henry: Okay, B.J., are you saying that A, you're going to get rid of Mike, and then B, you're going to snag Katie, and that C, no one will care if I just disappear into thin air?",
        "B.J.: Well -- well, yes. I mean, no one is going to care. Has anyone noticed yet? Hmm? I mean, where are all the throngs clamoring to save you, Henry? I don't see anybody. Not even Mike and Katie, and they're supposed to be your best friends.",
        "Henry: Blood is thicker than friendship, B.J. Maddie cares about me.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, well, pretty soon all your little sister is going to care about is the steady stream of gifts and clothes you'll be sending her from your various business trips. Given a few weeks, I'm pretty sure she won't give a damn if you ever come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You are so out of line right now. Where do you get off telling me I can't find my own brother?",
        "Casey: I'm just trying to be your friend, okay?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, friends don't let friends desert loved ones.",
        "Casey: Have you ever had a friend before? It works like this -- I try to keep you from getting hurt.",
        "Maddie: What if Henry is the one that's hurt? I cannot turn my back on him. Talk about a friend -- he is my best friend. I have to find him.",
        "Casey: How are you even going to get into Fairwinds? All right? It's like ft. Knox.",
        "Maddie: Unless you have a key.",
        "Casey: But you don't, so forget it.",
        "Maddie: But I so do. Henry made me a copy when we thought we were moving in.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine, so you've got a key. What happens when you let yourself in and run smack dab into B.J.?",
        "Maddie: I won't. I won't. He just was on his way to the station for a meeting.",
        "Casey: That doesn't mean he's gonna stay there.",
        "Maddie: His precious Katie is there, okay? There's nothing that will tear him away from that.",
        "Casey: Didn't I hear my grandma saying something about him having to stay away from my Aunt Katie?",
        "Maddie: Even if he has to drool over her from the control booth, he'll be there. Believe me, he's obsessed.",
        "Casey: You're not going to let me talk you out of this, are you?",
        "Maddie: Nope. Not when my brother's life is at stake.",
        "Casey: Hold on. I thought that your brother was, like, B.J.'s right hand man. What makes you think that B.J. turned on him?",
        "Maddie: Because, last time I talked to Henry, I blasted him for being such a wimp and not standing up to the guy.",
        "Casey: And you think that Henry suddenly grew a backbone?",
        "Maddie: Well, yeah, it could happen. He might decide to make me proud by telling off his creepy boss. He's just that kind of brother. And now he went from executive assistant to resident grape-stomper.",
        "Casey: You'd better hope that's the only thing getting stomped down there.",
        "Maddie: If you want to be in this with me, could you at least try to be a little bit more positive?",
        "Casey: You know what? You're the one who's always moaning about B.J. -- nevermind.",
        "Maddie: Look, you don't have to help me, okay? It's cool. You don't owe me anything.",
        "Casey: That's for sure.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Casey: Hold on. But, you're sure gonna owe me when this is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What do you mean you can't forgive yourself?",
        "Mike: I never should have left you alone Halloween night.",
        "Katie: You cannot blame yourself for what B.J. did to me. We all signed on for that stupid assassins game.",
        "Mike: But I had a feeling when we drew names he was using it as a ploy to get you alone.",
        "Katie: You had no idea what he was gonna do.",
        "Mike: I knew he had a thing for you. I didn't trust my instincts. I didn't protect you.",
        "Katie: We all have crushes, honey. You didn't know what B.J. was gonna do with his.",
        "Mike: It's just when I think about what could have happened if I hadn't gotten there in time --",
        "Katie: But you did, okay? Stop beating yourself up. I'm fine, especially now that Kim's making sure that B.J. keeps his distance.",
        "Mike: You need to keep your distance, too. I don't want you in another situation you can't escape.",
        "Katie: And what about Henry? What if he's in some situation that he can't escape?",
        "Mike: I guess it'd be hard to hop away on one shoe.",
        "Katie: Damn it, Mike, I am serious about this! What if he's in trouble, and this shoe is a clue that will lead us to him.",
        "P.A.: You found it!",
        "Katie: Sorry?",
        "P.A.: That's Henry Coleman's shoe, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "P.A.: He asked for it, plus the one in repair.",
        "Katie: Hold on. You talked to him?",
        "P.A.: Not me personally, but Mr. Green said to overnight it.",
        "Katie: He can't have it.",
        "P.A.: It -- its Henry Coleman's, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, it definitely is. It's just that --",
        "Mike: You still think Henry's trapped in some anti-government conspiracy.",
        "Katie: She didn't talk to him personally.",
        "Mike: Katie, what is it gonna take for you to stay out of this? Do you really think B.J. Green's gonna go through that much trouble over a shoe.",
        "Katie: It wouldn't be the first time he went to a lot of trouble to cover up a lie.",
        "Mike: B.J. had a serious fixation on you. This is Henry we're talking about. He doesn't exactly stir up the same kind of passion in people.",
        "Katie: You're right.",
        "Mike: You know I'm right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "B.J.: Oh, I'll need your other shoe.",
        "Henry: My shoe? What for?",
        "B.J.: I'm sending it to Palo Alto this afternoon, along with the one you left in the office.",
        "Henry: Why go through all that trouble? Why don't you just give me back that other shoe? It does get rather chilly down here.",
        "B.J.: You know, just in case your sister needs some extra convincing, I want to put her suspicions to rest for good. Its okay, you'll get another pair. Yes, you'll need one to go with your dark suit when I finally put you to rest for good.",
        "Henry: No, that's it, that's it, that's it. I am sick to death -- that's a horrible choice of words. I am totally, completely over being intimidated by you. You think you can just get rid of me and pretend I never existed?",
        "B.J.: Yes, yes. And let's think about that for a minute, okay? What would the world be like if Henry Coleman never existed? Let's see. Have you made any contributions to society, invented anything in your lifetime, done anything for anyone other than yourself, hmm? Can you answer that? Well, I can. The answer's no, no and no. See, from where I'm standing, the world would pretty much spin the same way with or without you, Henry Coleman. Face it, Henry -- [In announcer's voice] \"This is your life!\" You're a loser. No hard feelings though, really. I mean, I was there once myself so -- Olga? Can you keep an eye on Henry here and keep him company? I have a feeling he's gonna need it.",
        "Henry: Maybe he's right. Maybe know one would notice if i ceased to exist. Maybe that's why nobody's come for me. Think about it, Olga. You could be the only person in the world who could care whether I live or die. Let's drink to that, huh? To a world without Henry. Well, you have the corkscrew, so you're gonna have to do the honors. Oh! Oh, gosh! Oh! My back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: See? No B.J.",
        "Casey: This isn't exactly a one-bedroom apartment. I mean, he could be lurking anywhere in this tomb.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, we can't let that stop us. We have to find the wine cellar. Come on.",
        "B.J.: Aren't you two a bit young to be drinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So it turns out it wasn't something that she ate after all. Dr. Bob actually thinks that somebody tried to poison my mom on purpose.",
        "Will: I believe it.",
        "Gwen: You do? Why?",
        "Will: Because I have a pretty good idea who did it -- your mom's drinking buddy.",
        "Gwen: Stan? No way. He's too lazy. Why do you think he would do it?",
        "Will: Because he's been acting really suspicious lately, looking at me funny, like he knows something I don't know. And when I went to the house to get the insurance policy, he was there.",
        "Gwen: In the house?",
        "Will: Yep, poking around. I told him he wasn't supposed to be there and he pulls out a key.",
        "Gwen: Did you tell him what happened to mom?",
        "Will: Yeah, I told him. He acted surprised, but I didn't buy it.",
        "Gwen: Look, I just don't get it. What reason would he have to do something like that?",
        "Will: Maybe Iris got cocky and told him that she had her hands on a big, fat trust fund before it even happened.",
        "Gwen: So you think he's trying to get her out of the way to get to her money? That doesn't make sense. I mean, even if she were -- he still couldn't get near Billy's trust fund.",
        "Will: We don't know what kind of relationship those two have, or what they've talked about. Whatever it is, he's using her, and I told her that she needs to cut him loose.",
        "Gwen: What did she say to that?",
        "Will: That I was way off-base. But you know, I could see something in her eyes. It was like she knew who did it, even if she was too ashamed to admit it.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe I'm about to say this after everything that she's done, but I kind of feel sorry for her.",
        "Will: Well, you're a better person than I am.",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about? You're amazing. Look at everything that you've done for me.",
        "Will: I'm sorry, but I just can't muster up any sympathy for Iris.",
        "Gwen: Well, neither can I most of the time, but this is different. It's not like she poisoned herself.",
        "Will: Still, if she's gonna not own up to the fact that her boyfriend is trouble, then she's willing to put you and the baby in danger, and I'm not okay with that.",
        "Gwen: Look, Will, it's her home and her life, and there isn't a lot I can do to change how she decides to live. So I'm kind of stuck there for right now.",
        "Will: Maybe not.",
        "Gwen: What are you saying?",
        "Will: I think it's time we moved out -- tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: Iris, if Will is right, and your friend Stan has it in for you --",
        "Iris: Oh, no, no, no, no. The kid got it all wrong. See, Stan Mitchum may be a lot of things, he ain't no murderer.",
        "Cass: How well do you really know this guy?",
        "Iris: Well, I -- I know him well enough that he wouldn't hurt a flea.",
        "Cass: Because I can do a background check.",
        "Iris: No, no, no, no, no. Why waste that money, you know? I mean, I'm not even sure if anyone tried to do anything to me. We haven't even gotten the lab reports back. As far as I know, they might say something like I shouldn't have eaten that two- week-old chicken that was in the refridge that Gwen said I should have ditched, or I got a bug or something.",
        "Cass: 20 minutes ago, you were convinced that somebody was trying to hurt you.",
        "Iris: Yeah, well, 20 minutes ago, I felt like I swallowed razor blades. And now, I'm feeling better, and the world looks a little different now.",

        "Gwen: I'm scared. That judge already hates me.",
        "Will: No judge in his right mind is gonna hold it against you if you move out of your house because your mother got poisoned. It's gonna make you look more responsible as a mother. You took him out of a dangerous environment.",

        "Will: You can't. She's in the hospital.",
        "Gwen: What if it was just an accident?",
        "Will: People don't get poisoned by accident. Your mom is the kind of person that makes enemies. So if it wasn't Stan, then there's somebody else out there who's out to get her. You and the baby aren't safe until we know what really happened.",

        "Maddie: I hate them almost as much as I hate lime green. But you wouldn't know that because you're not my brother. I know Henry didn't send me that package that mysteriously showed up, and I know he's not in Palo Alto.",
