    "Recap": [
        "Katie and Mike bow out of Thanksgiving at Margo's to celebrate alone \u0096 in bed. Maddie shows up and convinces Katie to move forward with their plan to trap BJ and find out what happened to Henry that very day. Katie takes off and Maddie covers with Mike. Katie shows up at WOAK, where BJ is working alone and pretends that she is furious with Mike. Lily celebrates Thanksgiving with Keith, as Lucinda pleads with her to change her mind, and when she can't, she heads over to the farm with the rest of the clan. Meg and Dusty arrive as Meg worries about her mother's reaction to Dusty being there. Emma overhears Lucinda asking when they are moving into her guestroom, and takes it surprisingly well. Holden interrogates Dusty regarding his intentions. Emma asks Dusty to help cut the Hubbard squash \u0096 a big step for her. Holden is forced to tell Luke that Lily won't be there with them to celebrate Thanksgiving because she is marrying Keith. Jack and Carly discuss her impending trial and force themselves to stay positive. Holden figures out why Lily is staying with Keith after something Nancy says. He, Lucinda and Jack decide to keep quiet about it until they get proof. Gwen goes to see Will at the police station and is not allowed to bring Billy in, so Jen offers to watch him. Paul walks in as Jen is coddling Billy. This, to say the least, disturbs him but things get more hectic when Hal finds a charge for methanol on his credit card and the messenger ID's Will as the one who signed for the package. Will puts the pieces together and figures out that Iris is setting him up. Gwen is unsure Iris would go that far. Jen and Paul visit with Will and he is agitated thinking they think he is guilty too. Blinded by anger and frustration, he accuses Paul of planting the evidence against him to control him and keep him away from Gwen. He goes one step farther; maybe Paul never forgave him for Rose. Jen staunchly defends Paul (little does he know how far he would go to control a situation). Gwen shows up at the farm desperately in need of Carly's help."

        "Luke: What's going on?",
        "Holden: I didn't want to say anything in the car, because -- your mom, she's not coming.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Holden: She's with Keith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Lily, I thought you were going to put on some music.",
        "Lily: I got distracted by my ring.",
        "Keith: Yeah, it is pretty nice, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Dinner smells good. I wish you hadn't gone to all that trouble.",
        "Keith: What trouble? You mean going to the supermarket at midnight and getting up this morning and cooking it all? No trouble. You see, I'm not sleeping that well in the guest room.",
        "Lily: I need some time.",
        "Keith: I know. And I'm patient.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Lucinda: Its Thanksgiving, and we have to talk.",
        "Keith: Hello. Shall I set another place at the table?",

        "Emma: Why?",
        "J.J.: Because that means it's almost Christmas!",

        "Jack: Hey, hey -- I thought we weren't going to talk about that today.",
        "Carly: I know. I know, but I can't help it. This could be the last thanksgiving I have with you and the kids for a very long time.",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #3: Regulations, ma'am. You can't take a baby down to lock up.",
        "Gwen: No, but I have to see Will.",
        "Jennifer: I'll watch him for you.",
        "Gwen: No, that's okay. I'll come back later.",
        "Jennifer: Gwen, Will might not be here later.",
        "Gwen: Where's he going?",
        "Jennifer: Well, after they arraign him, they might take him back to the hospital.",
        "Gwen: Why? He's not sick.",
        "Jennifer: Look, Gwen, I really think you should see him while you have the chance. I'll watch Billy for you. Please, please. I've got my head on straight. You really don't need to worry. Besides, I'm in a room full of cops. Listen, everybody! I am not allowed to leave with this baby, okay? Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You're late.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: For Thanksgiving dinner. You can have mine, though. It's pretty ugly and it probably tastes like slime, but it's all I've got.",
        "Gwen: Will, are you okay?",
        "Will: No. Gwen, they really believe I poisoned your mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Billy cries]",
        "Jennifer: It's okay, Billy. Your mommy'll be back soon. Oh, here. Don't worry. Here's your teddy. Okay, okay. Do you want a hug? Is that what you want? Well, then, you got it, buddy. You got it. You are such a good boy. I know your mommy loves you. Yes, she does.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, what are you doing?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: Isn't he adorable? Oh, now, before you accuse me of anything, Gwen wanted to see Will, so I said that I would watch Billy. Isn't he precious?",
        "Paul: Yeah, he's precious. Can I hold him now?",
        "Jennifer: I don't think so. Not with that grumpy face. You would not want to be held with that grumpy face, would you? Would you? No, you like me. Oh, it was like magic, Paul. He was crying before, and as soon as I picked him up, he just stopped.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't think this is such a great idea.",
        "Jennifer: Would you relax, please? I'm not going to break down. I know he's not mine.",
        "Hal: Who's this?",
        "Jennifer: This is Gwen's little boy. She's down seeing Will.",
        "Paul: When can we get Will out of here?",
        "Hal: I'm working on that. And when I figure it out, I'll handle it. You can go.",
        "Paul: You shouldn't have arrested him. Will would never hurt anybody.",
        "Jennifer: Dad knows that. Right?",
        "Hal: I want Will out of here as much as both of you. But all the evidence we have points to him.",
        "Paul: Well, there must be some mistake.",
        "Hal: And I'll find it.",
        "Cop #3: Lieutenant, here's that report you were waiting for.",
        "Jennifer: Dad, what is it?",
        "Hal: There's a charge for methanol on Will's credit card.",
        "Jennifer: Methanol?",
        "Hal: It's the chemical that was used to poison Iris Dumbrowski.",
        "Jennifer: That doesn't mean anything. I mean, Will could have bought it for any number of reasons.",
        "Paul: Jen. Methanol is what Will used on Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, I would never lie to you. So, here's the deal. When I was younger, I used poison on someone, and they died.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Will: I know, but I just need to say this. Her name was Rose d'angelo. And she was engaged to my brother. They were going to move to Paris after the wedding. And I was so afraid of losing him, so I decided to give her something that would make her sick. I thought if she was sick, then they wouldn't go. But it killed her. And it was my fault. And they put me away in the state psychiatric hospital. And they were right to. Because, what I did -- it was -- well, I didn't mean to. But, Gwen, what's happening with your mother right now is not some repeat performance. I didn't poison Iris. Not by accident, not on purpose, not in some psychotic haze. I just didn't do it. I swear to you, that is the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you for understanding. Bye. Oh, man, I just flat out lied to my sister for you.",
        "Mike: You told the absolute truth. Everything you said was right.",
        "Katie: Oh, really?",
        "Mike: Mm-hmm. Nurse Katie, you need to heal me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How come you never get upset about me having to go to jail? Do you have some little cutie stashed someplace? Are you going to replace me the minute they lock the cell door? I'm just kidding. Jack?",
        "Jack: I can't see it. Life without you -- I just can't see it. And I've tried. I've tried to prepare myself, but -- whenever I think about our future, I see kids and carpools and homework, bedtime stories. And you. There. Always.",
        "Carly: You put that out of your mind. Because you're right. Today, we are not going to think about anything bad today. I want to be here. Really here. This is the place where I fell in love with you, two or three times.",
        "Jack: And you broke up with me here about twenty or thirty times.",
        "Carly: Only thirty?",
        "Jack: Hey!",
        "Carly: I want to be holding your hand when Emma says grace. And believe it or not, I would like to help clean up.",
        "Carly: Just to make it all last a little bit longer. And then, when the kids are asleep, I would like to be with you.",
        "Jack: It's a date.",
        "Carly: I wonder what Gwen is doing today.",
        "Jack: Well, why don't you invite her to join us? Ask Emma, I'm sure she won't mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I don't get it. Its Thanksgiving, and she's out with Keith.",
        "Holden: Not just for today. Luke -- she's going to be marrying Keith.",
        "Luke: No. No, no. No way. You guys were getting back together.",
        "Holden: It's not going to work out.",
        "Luke: Is this because I got sick?",
        "Holden: No, no, of course not. Luke, your mom and I, the one thing that we have in common is that we love you and your sisters so much. You guys, you mean the world to us.",
        "Luke: Well, then why isn't she here right now?",
        "Holden: Because we thought it would be too confusing.",
        "Luke: It is confusing! You guys were together down in Mexico, while I was in the hospital. I saw how close you guys were getting. How does that just fall apart like that?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lucinda: I couldn't break bread with you. Not if it was the last slice from the last loaf from the last wheat berry in the universe.",
        "Keith: Well, if you change your mind, I'll be here for the next 50 years. Lily, show your mother the ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lucinda cringes]",
        "Lucinda: The arrogance!",
        "Lily: Okay, if you've come here to lecture me, please don't.",
        "Lucinda: Somebody has to. Somebody has to! It's thanksgiving! We have so much to be thankful for this year. Luke survived. Me too, me too, I'm surviving.",
        "Lily: I know, I am thankful -- for you and for Luke.",
        "Lucinda: All the more reason, darling, for you to be at Emma's table. Oh, listen to me, I'm begging you to be at Emma's table, where you belong, with your husband and your children.",
        "Lily: I can't leave Keith.",
        "Lucinda: Can't he feed himself? This is Luke's first day home from the hospital. His first day. Why would you choose to be here with him instead of with them?",
        "Lily: I -- Mom, Holden and I thought it was best for Luke not to see us together, because -- it's not going to happen!",
        "Lucinda: Why? Why can't it happen?",
        "Lily: Just try to understand. I did what I needed to do for my family, now I'm doing what I need to do for myself.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, this doesn't make any sense. I mean, it makes no sense, whatsoever. After all the things that this man did?",
        "Lily: He's done some wonderful -- things, as well. I know you don't agree with my decision. But I know I made the right one.",
        "Keith: So, are you sure you don't want to change your mind? We have plenty.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, if you change your mind, there's always room for one more at Emma's. Excuse me.",
        "Keith: Dinner is served.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Why can't I just order pizza? What do I gotta go all the way over to Mabel's for?",
        "Katie: Well, it's your fault that I'm not having turkey and stuffing. And, it's also your fault that i worked up such an appetite.",
        "Mike: Oh, yeah. Why don't you give me my shirt back?",
        "Katie: Why don't you come get it, and then you can have it?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Mike: You did order pizza!",
        "[Mike winces]",
        "Maddie: I thought you were sick? Chest cold?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm headed to the drug store.",
        "Maddie: When you didn't come to -- [Maddie sighs] When you didn't come to Margo's, I thought you had kept your promise, and that you were looking for Henry.",
        "Katie: I did try to call him today. But what can I do today? It's Thanksgiving.",
        "Maddie: What do you think he's doing? If he's even alive.",
        "Katie: Oh, Maddie, come here. He's fine. You know Henry, he can survive anything.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know. But, for how long?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, I need to know what you're thinking. Do you believe me?",
        "Hal: Will, are you certain you had nothing to do with this poisoning?",
        "Will: I didn't do it, Dad.",
        "Hal: Sir, would you come in here, please?",
        "Will: Dad, I can explain.",
        "Gwen: Who is this guy?",
        "Hal: Is this the young man that signed for the delivery?",
        "Messenger: Yeah, that's him.",
        "Will: Dad, if you had asked me about this before, I would have told you. I ran into this guy on Iris's porch. I signed for a package he had, but I had no idea what was in it. And Iris told me it was something for the baby.",
        "Gwen: Iris never gave me anything for Billy.",
        "Will: Well, that proves Iris is lying!",
        "Messenger: Can I go now?",
        "Hal: I'll walk you out. We'll talk, Will.",
        "Will: You don't believe me.",
        "Gwen: Hey. Hey, I'm sorry.",
        "Will: I didn't do it. If I could --",
        "Gwen: What is it?",
        "Will: Gwen, do you remember when we went to Java and my credit card wasn't in my wallet?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you went back to the house to get it.",
        "Will: Right. And that's when I ran into the guy on the porch, the messenger. And Iris -- and Stan was there. And she was so freaked out that I had the package. She grabbed it from me, and then she handed me back my credit card. Gwen, that's it! That's why all the evidence points to me. Your mom is setting me up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What is it?",
        "Meg: I'm scared Mama won't ask you to help cut the Hubbard squash. Okay, there, I said it, okay?",
        "Dusty: Wait a second. What?",
        "Meg: She's overprotective of me. And since it took you a little while to realize you couldn't resist me --",
        "Dusty: Are you scared to your mother is going to offend me?",
        "Meg: I don't want her to hurt your feelings.",
        "Dusty: She's not. I mean, she's -- she'll get used to me. Once we move in together.",
        "Meg: Okay -- ay, you can't tell her about the guest house, all right? Not until, you know, I find a chance to ease mama into it.",
        "Dusty: Why not? What is she going to do? Excommunicate me from the Snyder family, hmm? I've been here before for Thanksgiving, you don't have to worry. All the guys cut the Hubbard squash.",
        "Meg: Yeah, all the guys do it because Mama asked them to. And for that, she has to like you.",
        "Emma: Meg? [Door opening] I thought I saw you out there.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Emma: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hi. These are for you.",
        "Emma: Oh, beautiful, beautiful. Come in, come in. Dusty. Thank you. Sweetheart.",
        "Meg: Hello?",
        "Jack: Hey, Meg.",
        "Holden: Hey!",
        "J.J.: Hey, Luke, Parker says you can get to level 15 on Sky Raiders?",
        "Luke: I used to be able to do it, I don't know --",
        "Parker: Can you show us? Please?",
        "J.J.: Yeah, come on, Luke, come on.",
        "Jack: I bet I could beat you.",
        "Luke: You're on.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",

        "Emma: Lucinda! Hello, hello. Oh, you look beautiful. Let me take your coat.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, thank you. Oh, you look so lovely.",
        "Carly: Can I get you something? Would you like something to drink?",
        "Lucinda: Umm, oh, no. I think I'll just have a tea, plain tea.",
        "Meg: Dusty and I got some tea.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it's cold out. Green tea, I bet.",
        "Meg: Um, yes.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, darling.",
        "Holden: Hello.",
        "Lucinda: Give me a hug. Okay. Well, Sierra and Lucy send regrets from Massachusetts. They wish that they could be here, but they send greetings. I'm glad that you, Meg and Dusty are here, because I've got the keys to the guest house for both of you. Have you decided when you're going to move in yet?",
        "Dusty: Not yet.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, just let me know. Where are the kids? Where's the fun?",
        "Emma: Oh, in there.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Honey!",
        "Meg: Mama, I was going to tell you.",
        "Emma: Oh, sweetheart. If it's what you want, well, then I'm very happy -- for both of you.",
        "Dusty: See that? She's already happy.",
        "Meg: She was being polite. When they pull out the saw to cut the squash, don't stand so close.",
        "Holden: Outside. What are your intentions with my sister?",
        "Dusty: You're kidding, right?",
        "Holden: No, I'm not. Meg and I, we're almost living",
        "Dusty: Meg and I, we're almost living together.",
        "Holden: You know, my sister, she cares a lot about you.",
        "Dusty: I hope so. I care about her. And your mom already gave me the third degree.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, now you're getting it from me. That's probably because you don't have such a great track record.",
        "Dusty: Well, you don't have a great track record either. I don't see Lily around whipping up any potatoes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: So, do you like it?",
        "Lily: Oh -- um, it's absolutely delicious. It's great.",
        "Keith: Really? Because you've only had like, exactly three bites.",
        "Lily: Well, this isn't what I pictured for my Thanksgiving dinner.",
        "Keith: Holden, he was wrong to keep the kids away from you.",
        "Lily: No. No, they belong at the farm. I don't think they should be here until we -- get used to our situation.",
        "Keith: Okay, well, let's look at the bright side. We'll enjoy the privacy. You know, Lily, the family will come around. And you and I, and the kids will have lots of holidays together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Time to cut the Hubbard squash!",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Jack: I'll meet you out back.",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Dusty: Would you like me to help with that?",
        "Emma: Well --",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Emma: Oh, who could that be? Oh, Nancy, come in! Oh, it's so good to see you.",
        "Nancy: Hello, everyone!",
        "Emma: I hope you'd like to stay for dinner.",
        "Nancy: Oh, I'd love to, but I can't. I'm on my way to Tom and Margo's, thank you. But I did want to stop by with this sweet potato pie, and to wish you all happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Emma: Oh, happy Thanksgiving to you. Oh, that's beautiful, thank you.",
        "Nancy: Oh, Luke, it's so good to see you, and looking so well and out of the hospital.",
        "Luke: I'm feeling much better, thank you very much, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Nancy: Wasn't that a miracle that that kidney arrived for you just in time? I know what everyone here in this house is going to be thankful for this celebration. You take good care of yourself.",
        "Luke: You, too.",
        "Nancy: I'd better run or I'm going to be late.",
        "Emma: Okay, well, thank you so much. Holden, maybe you want to --",
        "Holden: Mama, Lucinda and I will walk Nancy out.",
        "Lucinda: Um, of course. Okay. All right.",
        "Emma: Thank you, Nancy.",
        "Meg: Mama, you know, Dusty is a good guy.",
