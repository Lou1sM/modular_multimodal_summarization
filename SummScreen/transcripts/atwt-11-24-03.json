        "Alison: Why did we even come",
        "Alison: Why did we even come here? I could have stayed at the hospital and at least gotten paid for a shift.",
        "Susan: Ali, sit down. Take the weight off that knee.",
        "Emily: Hey. I'm sorry. I got here as soon as I could.",
        "Alison: Oh, I get it. This is some sort of intervention, right? Okay, go ahead, tell me I'm a sex addict, scream \"I told you so.\" Just get it over with!",
        "Emily: Alison, we're not here to lecture you, okay? What good would that do now? Mom and I both feel the best thing right now is just to decide what we're gonna do about this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So this is what you meant when you said that Lucy was a non-issue.",
        "Aaron: No. I love Lucy. I do.",
        "Holden: Alison Stewart is pregnant and you are the father --",
        "Lily: What?! You cheated on Lucy with Alison Stewart?",
        "Aaron: No, no, I didn't.",
        "Lily: Aaron --",
        "Aaron: I didn't cheat on Lucy. I would never do that. Look, she and I had a really big fight and she said she didn't want to see me anymore. I thought my life was over.",
        "Lily: What about Alison? What's her excuse?",
        "Aaron: It's not an excuse. She -- she pretty much felt the same way I did. We were both a mess, Chris just dumped her and it -- it just happened, okay?",
        "Holden: No, Aaron. It's not okay! It's not okay at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I know it seems like you'll never get past this, but you will.",
        "Lucy: I feel so dead. I don't feel sad or even angry. I just feel -- blank.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Luce.",
        "Lucy: There's this one moment I keep playing over and over in my head. Everyone was standing there, finding out that Alison was pregnant and that Aaron was the father. I wanted to disappear, but I couldn't. I had to stand there and listen to it. I just can't get that out of my mind. But that's the truth, isn't it? Aaron and Alison are gonna have a baby. And there's no place to hide. And there's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Rosanna: It sounds like you've made a decision --",
        "Lucy: I have. Aaron is out of my life for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Canadian agent: Craig Montgomery?",
        "Craig: Yes. And you are?",
        "Canadian agent: Special investigator Filloux with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
        "Craig: Long way from home and without a horse, huh?",
        "Canadian agent: I have some questions for you about Annabelle Fettle.",
        "Craig: Who? Name doesn't ring a bell.",
        "Canadian agent: It should. Your name, address and phone number were highlighted in her rolodex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hal? Hey, I was hoping I'd get you in person. This is Molly. Listen, there's something really important that I need to talk to you about. I'm at Metro and I'll be here all night, so whenever you show up, if you can come over, that would be great. Thanks. Hey.",
        "Dusty: You got something going on tonight?",
        "Molly: Yeah. I was supposed to hook up with Carly later.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? You guys made up? That's nice.",
        "Molly: Well, we're working on it.",
        "Dusty: I've got some things to do. I'll be back in a few.",
        "Molly: If you go, then I'm gonna be the only one that's here.",
        "Dusty: No, you won't. Craig's here.",
        "Molly: You're going to see Rose. So why are you pretending you're not? [Molly sighs] come on, Hal. Get back to me \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Oh, my God.",
        "Paul: Rose?",
        "Rose: Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",
        "Paul: You should leave that stuff alone.",
        "Rose: I've been going over this over and over again and -- the auditors were right. There's -- there's all this money missing. Tons of money -- missing. Thousands.",
        "Paul: What do you mean, missing?",
        "Rose: Mitzi stole thousands and thousands of dollars from me! I cannot believe she did this! I cannot let her get away with this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: Come on -- how long is this gonna take? I got to get outta here. Jack? What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Looking for you. I know what you did, Mitzi. Get your things together. We're going downtown. (woman) be out in a minute. Take your time.",
        "Mitzi: You're gonna arrest me?",
        "Jack: I gotcha, didn't I? Come on, Mitzi, did you really think the hotel wasn't gonna call the bank to verify the check?",
        "Mitzi: That's what this is about? The check they're cashing for me at the front desk?",
        "Jack: Yeah. You wrote it against an account you closed yesterday.",
        "Mitzi: I didn't realize.",
        "Jack: Mitzi. Maybe it occurs more often than it used to, but passing bad checks is still a crime. You're just lucky it was me that answered the call and not some uniform or you really would be heading down to the station.",
        "Mitzi: I'm so sorry, Jack. I knew it was wrong. And I was gonna make good on it. I swear.",
        "Jack: Why'd you do it?",
        "Mitzi: I was desperate. I didn't have the cash for a plane ticket to A.C. I asked everybody. You never called me back.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. You're going back to Atlantic City? Why? You in trouble?",
        "Mitzi: No. Well, I mean yes -- I mean sorta.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute -- does this have anything to do with that friend you told me that hit a run-in with the law?",
        "Mitzi: No, Jack! I was really asking those questions for a friend, I swear.",
        "Jack: Okay, then why the rush to get out of town? My gut says you're runnin' away.",
        "Mitzi: I am. I'm runnin' away from Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Crater: Where's your car?",
        "Dusty: It's on the highway. Did you put the bat and gloves back in Paul's trunk?",
        "Crater: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Good. Is Paul inside with Rose?",
        "Crater: Yeah. They're in for the night.",
        "Dusty: He didn't tell you to leave yet?",
        "Crater: Not yet.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Crater: How's that gonna help you get a chance to talk to Rose?",
        "Dusty: You're gonna distract him.",
        "Crater: Okay. Any ideas?",
        "Dusty: Go knock on the door and tell him you saw Barbara Ryan snooping around. That'll get him out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There's just got to be some other explanation for where this money went.",
        "Rose: It's Mitzi. It's Mitzi. I got the proof, right here. My best friend -- my best friend was changing the deposit totals. That's why she was avoiding me. That's why she was so mad about the Roller Palace being sold. She was afraid the new owners were gonna find out that she'd taken all the profits. That's why she wanted to get the heck outta dodge! She was robbing me.",
        "Paul: Don't worry about it. We've got plenty of money.",
        "Rose: It's not about the money! This is about my best friend. My very best friend. I mean, if she needed money, why didn't she just say something to me. I gave her a million opportunities to tell me what was going on. What does she's do? She stabs me in the back. That was money I was gonna use to pay back Lily. I cannot believe she would do this. I would forgive her. Doesn't she know that? It's the close ones to you got to watch out for.",
        "Paul: Stop, stop, stop. Come on. Come on. It's gonna be okay. It is. It is. We'll get through this, okay? Together.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Crater: Hate to bother you, boss.",
        "Paul: What is it?",
        "Crater: We got trouble. There was a woman by the car. I didn't get a good look, but I think it was your mother.",
        "Paul: Barbara is sneaking around out there?",
        "Crater: Like I said, I'm not 100% sure.",
        "Paul: Hold on. You just stay here. I'll be right back. I'll check it out.",
        "Rose: Be careful. Oh! Barbara! Give it up, Barbara!",
        "Dusty: Barbara's not out there. I needed to see you alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come on, Rose is your best friend. She's gettin' married in a couple of days. Stick around so you can throw some rice, tie some tin cans to her car, come on.",
        "Mitzi: Rose and I had a fight. Big time. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm happy for her. I really am. She finally found somebody who loves her like she deserves. It's just -- I can't stay. And I don't have any money to leave! And I don't have any way to get any, and I don't have any friends in sight, so -- you might as well arrest me because at least then I'd have someplace to sleep tonight.",
        "Jack: All right, calm down, calm down. I'll take care of it, okay?",
        "Mitzi: How?",
        "Jack: I'll take care of this check thing with the hotel. Just don't do anything like this again.",
        "Mitzi: I won't. I promise. What I wouldn't give for a place to crash for the night.",
        "Jack: Listen, I'll call the airport, and I'll get you a ticket for the first flight to Atlantic City. And I'll arrange it so you can crash here for the night. How's that?",
        "Mitzi: You'd do that for me?",
        "Jack: Consider it payback. I seem to remember a time when you found me all tied up and you got a conk on the head as a result.",
        "Mitzi: Thank you, Jack. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Okay, all right. You're welcome. You're welcome.",
        "Mitzi: You're the best. And I swear, I am gonna pay you back, okay? Every cent. As soon as I get on my feet, I'm sending you a check. A money order. I'll send a money order.",
        "Jack: You're not coming back, are ya?",
        "Mitzi: Nope. My life in Oakdale is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: We just want to talk. Nobody's ganging up on you.",
        "Emily: We just want what's best for you Ali.",
        "Susan: A woman has a lot more options these days than when I was growing up.",
        "Alison: Oh, just wait a minute, you two. I'm not having an abortion, if that's what you're getting at. You can't make me.",
        "Emily: No one's trying to make you do anything. We're just -- we want you to know that there are choices. And you have the right to choose what happens to your body.",
        "Alison: I know that. And I believe a woman should have the right to choose. And I choose not to get rid of this baby. I mean, think of everything you two went through to have me.",
        "Susan: Okay. We're not trying to push you in any particular direction.",
        "Emily: No. We want to discuss other options. Adoption, for example. Right?",
        "Alison: You want me to give this baby away?",
        "Emily: No. No, but I want you to know that there are other alternatives. We just want what's best for you, Ali.",
        "Alison: No, I'm keeping this baby, and I'm raising it myself.",
        "Susan: Ali, do you understand what you'd be getting yourself into?",
        "Alison: No, I said I'm keeping it.",
        "Emily: Ali, listen to me. All right, I was a single mom. And it's hard. And, you know, I could support myself. I was more established than you are right now.",
        "Alison: I'm not you, Emily. And maybe I'm not settled. And maybe I never will be. But I'm keeping this baby.",
        "Susan: So, you've talked to Aaron, and he agrees?",
        "Alison: Not really -- not yet.",
        "Emily: Alison, he's got to be included in these decisions. Every choice you make from this point on has the possibility of turning his whole world upside down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How much more irresponsible can you be?",
        "Aaron: It's not like Alison and I planned for this to happen. All right, but you guys don't have to worry. I've got everything under control.",
        "Lily: Okay, you have everything under control. When is she due?",
        "Aaron: I didn't -- I didn't ask.",
        "Lily: You don't know. Has she been to the doctor?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. I didn't --",
        "Lily: Is she planning on having this child and raising the child? Do you know?",
        "Aaron: Yes, of course she's planning --",
        "Holden: Has she told you how she plans on making that work, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: No. No, I just --",
        "Lily: And what about health insurance? Does she have health insurance? And what about you? What's going to be your involvement in all this? You gonna raise the child with her? You gonna get married? You gonna live together?",
        "Aaron: All right already! Guys, I got the point. This is a lot of things I haven't figured out yet.",
        "Lily: But you have everything under control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know, you don't have to make a big decision about anything right now.",
        "Lucy: I do, though. I have wasted too many tears and too much time on Aaron Snyder.",
        "Carly: Hi! Delivery! Phyllis let me in. I brought your dress for Rose and Paul's wedding -- well, I've interrupted something, haven't I?",
        "Lucy: Oh, not much. Just that Alison Stewart's pregnant and Aaron's the father.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's Cabot. I'm sorry. I have to --",
        "Carly: Oh! All right, go. I'll stay.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Lucy: Can you believe Aaron's having a baby with the girl who put me in a wheelchair?",
        "Carly: Well, you know, this is gonna be very difficult for everybody involved. But really, there is something to that old saying \"what doesn't kill you will make you stronger.\"",
        "Lucy: But this is killing me.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm sure you feel like that today. But, believe it or not, tomorrow will be better, and then the day after that will be better still.",
        "Lucy: I just don't see how. I can't forget, and I'm never gonna understand.",
        "Carly: Yeah. That's the trick, isn't it?",
        "Lucy: What is?",
        "Carly: You can't spend time thinking about how this happened or why. That just keeps all that pain alive. But you can decide how it's going to affect you. You have your whole future.",
        "Lucy: Then that's what I'll focus on -- my future. One without Aaron Snyder. Alison can have him for all I care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So my name was in a rolodex, huh? I haven't seen one of those in a while.",
        "Canadian agent: Are you saying you don't know Annabelle Fettle?",
        "Craig: Mr. Fy -- feel -- Filo?",
        "Canadian agent: Filo.",
        "Craig: I have, and have had, business interests all around the world. For a long time, people have my number. Doesn't mean I know each one of them personally. Now, is that is or --",
        "Canadian agent: Just one more question, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Canadian agent: You recently adopted a child, didn't you? It will be easy enough to confirm.",
        "Craig: Yes, yes, no, no. My wife and I did recently adopt a child. I talked to an awful lot of people? Fetter, you said?",
        "Canadian agent: That's Fettle.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah -- she had a voice like ten miles of bad road. I had a conversation with her when I was exploring the options. But I went in another direction -- toots sweet. Something about her didn't smell right. And I don't do lunch with bad cheese, if you know what I mean. So what exactly did this puddle woman do?",
        "Canadian agent: Well, I'm not at liberty to discuss an ongoing case. But a warrant has been issued for her arrest. She fled Canada for parts unknown, either taking her records with her or destroying them.",
        "Craig: Oh, so she got away, huh?",
        "Canadian agent: Far from it. We will find her. And when we do, we'll get to the bottom of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hey, Hal.",
        "Hal: This better be good.",
        "Molly: Rose's damaged car good enough?",
        "Hal: Depends. Give it to me.",
        "Molly: Well, I can't tell you how I know this, but there's something in the trunk of Paul's car that may be connected to the damage done to Rose's car.",
        "Hal: And what exactly is this thing, and who found it?",
        "Molly: That I can't tell you.",
        "Hal: This is a waste of time.",
        "Molly: No, no, no, wait. Wait, wait. Hal, just listen to me, okay? Rose's bodyguard found it. His name's Crater. And don't you think it's worth a trip over to Rose's just to see if this guy's on the level?",
        "Hal: Well, the damage to Rose's car was pretty severe --",
        "Molly: Yeah. I'll say. I mean, whoever wrote \"die Rose\" on the hood of her car -- I hate to think what this person is capable of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Did you look around the yard next door?",
        "Crater: Yeah, no sign of her. You?",
        "Paul: Nothing. You okay?",
        "Crater: Yeah, why?",
        "Paul: I dunno, it just seems like you got something on your mind.",
        "Crater: Well, hey, I just want to do a solid job, Mr. Ryan. I know I messed up already. How about if we check around the -- walk around the perimeter one more time?",
        "Paul: No, no time, she's not here. Do me a favor, Crater. If you think you see Barbara again, call the police.",
        "Rose: Get out of here before Paul bashes your face in. Go!",
        "Dusty: Listen to me, Paul's hiding stuff from you. And I'd never forgive myself if something happened to you.",
        "Rose: How many times are we gonna have to go through this? How many times do I have to tell you what you can do with your stupid accusations?",
        "Dusty: No accusations. I got proof now that it was your own fianc\u00e9 that bashed up your car with a baseball bat and left you death threats all over it. Now, nobody is out to get you except your loser fianc\u00e9. You give me two minutes and I'll prove it to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As The World Turns\" --",
        "Alison: Chris has nothing to do with this baby. This baby is Aaron's.",
        "Susan: But how can you be sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I woke up a judge to get a warrant to search your car.",
        "Paul: You did what?",
        "Hal: He wasn't any happier about it than you are, Paul. I just want to get this over with.",
        "Paul: Fine. Let's do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Aaron, you just don't make a couple of decisions, the baby comes and then that's it, it's over.",
        "Holden: This is going to affect the rest of your life.",
        "Aaron: Oh. How much did I affect your life? Okay, if I can remember correctly, I'm not exactly the result of a serious, committed relationship either. But at least Alison's not my brother's girlfriend. Look, okay, I'm sorry. Dad, I'm sorry I said that. Mistake.",
        "Holden: No, it's all right. You know, I should've done a better job of protecting you from making the same mistakes that I made.",
        "Aaron: So you think of me as a mistake. That's nice.",
        "Holden: That's not what I meant.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, maybe not. But you know what? It's true. I am a mistake. Look, do you know how I found out about this? I found out at the hospital in front of Lucy and in front of a bunch of people.",
        "Lily: Lucy found out about the -- this -- that way.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I stabbed her in the heart. Okay, I never in my life thought I could hurt somebody like this, especially Lucy. But I did. Okay, now I've lost her forever because of one stupid night.",
        "Holden: Aaron, I'm sorry. Okay, but --",
        "Aaron: Don't be sorry, dad. It's my fault. It's my fault, okay? Would I take it all back if I could? Hell yeah! But I can't. So you don't need to rub it in anymore, okay?",
        "Holden: Where are you going?",
        "Aaron: To find Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay. Well, now that we've got the big decision's out of the way, I suppose we should talk about prenatal care for her.",
        "Susan: First thing tomorrow morning, we'll see Dr. Schiller, have a sonogram and figure out your due date.",
        "Alison: No!",
        "Susan: Ali, we have to start this pregnancy right. You can avoid a lot of problems if you catch them in the first trimester.",
        "Alison: Yes, and I know that, Dr. Mom. But I just want to pick my own OB, okay? And I already know my due date, because I know exactly when I got pregnant.",
        "Chris: Where are the condoms?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Chris: The condoms.",
        "Alison: I forgot.",
        "Emily: Honey, how can you possibly know exactly when you got pregnant?",
        "Alison: Well, I was there, wasn't I?",
        "Emily: What about you and Chris?",
        "Alison: Chris has nothing to do with this baby. This baby is Aaron's.",
        "Susan: But how can you be sure?",
        "Alison: Well, I did the math, okay? I mean, Aaron and I were together that one night, and we didn't use protection. I really just don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "Emily: Honey, we're just trying to support you, that's all.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, if that's true, then let me handle this my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Did you get Cabot back down?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. He just needed to know that Mommy was nearby.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Look, I'm gonna go. Okay? You're gonna be all right, sweetheart. Let me know if anything on the dress needs refixed or changed or anything like that, okay?",
        "Rosanna: I will.",
        "Carly: And I'll call you later.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much.",
        "Carly: Sure.",
        "Rosanna: Carly's right, you know?",
        "Lucy: She means well, but she doesn't know what I'm going through.",
        "Rosanna: She knows exactly what you're going through. We both do, more than you realize. Look, things can turn around. I've been where you're at. And look at me now. I have a beautiful baby. I have a beautiful stepdaughter that I just adore. And a husband I love very much. I am living proof you can go through the worst pain and be happy again.",
        "Lucy: I just loved Aaron so much.",
        "Rosanna: I know. I know. But you're gonna feel that way again. You're gonna love somebody more than you ever thought possible. It's just the way I love your dad.",
        "Craig: So what exactly will happen if you catch this -- this woman?",
        "Canadian agent: Happen? In what way?",
        "Craig: Well, I mean, are there any children in danger of being taken away -- I mean, you know, adoptions not being upheld?",
        "Canadian agent: As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss the specifics of the case. And since, as you say, your own adoption was not facilitated by Ms. Fettle, there's really nothing for you to worry about. Is there?",
        "Craig: No, of course not. Of course not.",
        "Canadian agent: I'll be in town for a few more days. I'm staying at a motel called the Lonely Pine. [Craig chuckles] you call me if you think of anything that might be relevant to the investigation.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",

        "Hal: Molly, I can't go storming over to Rose and Paul's with nothing but hearsay.",

        "Rose: I know how you are. I know what you -- you come in here, you think you're just gonna stop the wedding. You think you're just gonna barge in here and I'm gonna want you again? I don't want you anymore! You got it?!",
        "Dusty: I'm not in love with you either. You hear me? But I don't want to see you get hurt. You are in so much trouble here, and you don't even know it. I've got to talk to you before the wedding.",
        "Rose: Just get out. Go.",

        "Paul: Are you okay? What's wrong? Why are you shaking?",
        "Rose: When your best friend is stealing from you, it really throws you. [Knocking at door] oh. Oh.",
        "Paul: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey. Sorry for barging in so late. But I know it's probably none of my business, I just need to ask Rose about Mitzi.",
        "Rose: What do you know about Mitzi?",
        "Jack: Well, I just left her at the Lakeview.",
        "Rose: What, she's here in town still? She's still here?",
        "Jack: 'Til morning, yeah. Look, it sounds like you two had some pretty harsh words. Like I said before, it's probably none of my business, but I like Mitzi.",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Jack: And with you and Paul getting married and leaving town, you might not want to leave things the way they are.",
        "Rose: No, things can't stay the way they are.",
        "Jack: Good. Do you want to go to her and see if you can find something to say that might thaw the ice a little?",
        "Rose: That's a wonderful idea. I'm gonna see you tomorrow at the rehearsal dinner, right?",
        "Jack: Sure thing.",
        "Rose: You checked off the chicken, right? That's what you want? That's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. All right, see ya. Bye-bye.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?",
        "Rose: Gonna pay a visit to my ex-friend.",
        "Paul: Okay, great. Let's get going.",
        "Rose: No, no, no, no, no. I got to do this alone. I'm the one that she cheated.",

        "Rose: Yes. Yes. Yes.",

        "Holden: First he gets himself arrested and now this? It's always the same excuse. \"It just happened. I made a mistake.\"",

        "Holden: You think she got pregnant on purpose?",
        "Lily: I'm sure there's more to the story than we know. I'm sure Aaron didn't mean for this to happen.",
        "Holden: And you think Alison did?",
        "Lily: She finally broke up Aaron and Lucy. [Doorbell rings] wasn't that what she wanted for months? Emily?",

        "Lily: Oh, that's fine. Aaron just left to look for Alison.",
        "Emily: You know what? I think its better this way. My mom and I felt it would be better if the four of us adults talked first.",

        "Hal: Yeah, but you won't, see? Because I woke up a judge to get a warrant to search your car.",

So I booked for us a fabulous trip to the islands for Thanksgiving. And we leave first thing in the morning. Can't you hear the ocean breeze calling?",
