        "Emily: You cannot honestly believe that Alison deliberately got herself pregnant just to trap your son?",
        "Holden: She's already proven that she'll go to any lengths to get Aaron.",
        "Emily: Look, I'm not saying that she hasn't made mistakes --",
        "Lily: She burnt down a barn and let Aaron take the blame.",
        "Emily: Okay, fine! She's turned her life around since then, Lily. You know, she's got a great job, she's earned the respect of the people that she works for, she would never throw all that away by deliberately getting herself pregnant.",
        "Holden: And you're sure about that?",
        "Emily: Yes, I'm sure. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Holden: 'Cause kids learn from the adults around them.",
        "Emily: What are you accusing me of?",
        "Holden: She was at a pretty impressionable age when you went after Tom Hughes and getting pregnant was part of that equation, wasn't it? Not to mention what you did with me.",
        "Emily: And Aaron was born into this world because you hooked up with your brother's wife, Holden! So before you start comparing Alison to me, maybe you ought to take a little closer look at home, huh? 'Cause I got a feeling a lot of people are gonna say that Aaron's following in his father's footsteps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: We'll find a way to deal with everything, okay? I won't let you down.",
        "Alison: I keep messing up your life.",
        "Aaron: Ali, come on. What'd I tell you? It takes two to make a baby.",
        "Alison: But that doesn't mean that you and I have to pretend to be in love or anything. Tell Lucy that I am so behind you guys getting back together and I would never be jealous, I swear.",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna have a baby to take care of. There's no way Lucy's gonna be able to handle me being a dad.",
        "Alison: Unless you aren't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What is this? I drop a tropical vacation in your laps and my two princesses turn their noses up at this? Of course, we're going! I bought the tickets.",
        "Rosanna: Well, uh, what's the rush?",
        "Lucy: Daddy, it's just so sudden.",
        "Craig: Well, it's sudden because it's a surprise!",
        "Rosanna: And nobody's excited -- oh! Honey, I'm so happy that you did something so thoughtful and spontaneous.",
        "Craig: Well, good! Then pack your bags. And, Lucy, pack a mask and fins 'cause we're going snorkeling.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, I can't. I'm serious.",
        "Craig: Well, what's gotten into you?",
        "Lucy: I can't leave Oakdale right now. It'll look like I'm running away and I'm too embarrassed to show my face.",
        "Craig: Well, all right. We'll call that dragon you call grandmother and have her put a little blurb in the society page. \"Lucy Montgomery is spending the holidays in the islands, thankful that she is no longer tied to her lowlife shampoo-addicted boyfriend.\"",
        "Rosanna: Craig -- Craig?",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lucy: I knew you would be able to resist saying, \"I told you so.\"",
        "Craig: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: I'll get Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: It's incredibly thoughtful of you, darling, but timing -- timing --",
        "Craig: What?! What? The timing is perfect. Okay, Lucy can stay, but you and I and Cabot have to go.",
        "Rosanna: No, honey, it's impossible.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Rosanna: I can't leave. I can't miss Paul Ryan's wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So you can leave now.",
        "Bartender: Molly promised me two hours overtime if I came in.",
        "Dusty: What is that? Like 40 bucks?",
        "Bartender: With tips.",
        "Dusty: With tips let's make it 200 bucks.",
        "Bartender: Oh, thanks.",
        "Dusty: Anytime.",
        "Bartender: Good night.",
        "[Molly clears her throat]",
        "Molly: Didn't expect you back so soon.",
        "Dusty: I like to surprise you. You know that.",
        "Molly: And here I thought it was because Rose wasn't buying what you were selling. But what's up with you? The bartender told me you called her in because you had an emergency.",
        "Molly: Yeah. She's right.",
        "Dusty: Everything okay?",
        "Molly: I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: You look fine. So why don't you pull up a chair and tell me the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Showtime.",
        "Barbara: Hi. I've wanted to talk to you so much --",
        "Paul: Who's that?",
        "Barbara: Hal ordered an officer to follow me.",
        "Bennett: Is everything okay, sir?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. Believe it or not, this creature is my mother and I invited her here. Come on in.",
        "Barbara: Can you believe the outrageous lengths that Hal has gone to keep Will from me? I know that you can help me convince him that Will needs to see his mother.",
        "Paul: No, I don't want you going anywhere near Will.",
        "Barbara: But when you called, you said that you wanted to know what was going on between Hal and me.",
        "Paul: I know, I do. I want to know what you put in the trunk of my car that made Hal show up on my doorstep with a search warrant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: What are these?",
        "Rose: Those are all the records of the cash that went in and out of my shop. Interestingly enough, they don't add up!",
        "Mitzi: Maybe your math is off.",
        "Rose: Oh, or maybe my best friend was stealing from me. You're a thief, Mitzi! You're a lying thief. And as soon as I walk out that door, the whole town is gonna know exactly what you are.",
        "Mitzi: Then, I'm sorry. Rose, but you're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I can't believe we waited this long for you to move in. This is so nice. So -- peaceful.",
        "Ben: No, huh-uh -- we're not gonna have a peaceful life.",
        "Jessica: Oh, we're not?",
        "Ben: No. We can do peaceful Monday through Friday, but on weekends and special times like this, we're gonna do exciting.",
        "Jessica: Well, what exactly did you have in mind, Dr. Harris?",
        "Ben: I say we hop a plane to the islands and get married by midnight.",
        "Jessica: We haven't even unpacked your stuff yet.",
        "Ben: I don't care.",
        "Jessica: Ben!",
        "Ben: Come on, Jess, how much time have we wasted already?",
        "Jessica: Okay, compromise -- uh, first we'll unpack everything, then we'll call the airlines and get on the first thing smoking. Deal?",
        "Ben: I like that. Deal.",
        "Jessica: All right.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Ben: I'll get it.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Ben: Curtis!",
        "Curtis: Decided to come home for the holidays after all. Surprise!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out where all the moral high ground is here. And Molly was younger than Alison when you got her pregnant, Holden.",
        "Holden: A mistake on both our parts.",
        "Emily: A mistake? Well, you know what? It's a mistake for Alison and Aaron, too. Only you seem to want Alison to take full responsibility for this child.",
        "Lily: No, we didn't say that.",
        "Emily: That's what he's saying.",
        "Holden: That's not what I'm saying. Aaron will not walk away from this child.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Emily: That's probably my mother. She's upset enough as it is, okay? So could you just please not attack her, too.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "Susan: It feels a little tense in here.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, Lily and Holden are blaming Alison for being pregnant. They think that she tricked Aaron to trap him.",
        "Susan: Aaron has been sexually active with Lucy Montgomery for a long time and she's not pregnant. It's safe to assume that Aaron knows about birth control.",
        "Holden: Of course he does. And he should have been more careful.",
        "Susan: And so should Alison. But because they weren't, a baby is gonna be born to parents who are barely out of childhood themselves. So we have a choice. We can fight and blame each other. Or we can be adults and take care of this little family until they can take care of themselves.",
        "Lily: That pretty much clears it up. Doesn't it?",
        "Emily: You're right, mom.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: Me, too.",
        "Susan: Okay, we've got a lot to talk about. So, Lily, why don't you and I make some coffee?",
        "Lily: Sure.",
        "Susan: Find some paper and some pens. Let's make lists.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: What ifs are kind of beside the point right now, Ali. I'm gonna be a dad. It's a little late to be dreaming about how much better it would be if I weren't.",
        "Alison: It's just -- if I were pregnant by someone else, then you and Lucy could still be together.",
        "Aaron: But you're not pregnant by somebody else. I mean, you told me for sure that you were positive it wasn't Chris.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: 'Cause if it was Chris, this would make things a lot easier. You know, since you two do love each other.",
        "Alison: No, he doesn't love me and that's the whole problem. But, Aaron, I wish that he did. I -- I wish that he did so much, and I wish I wasn't pregnant -- and I wish that you and Lucy were still together and --",
        "Aaron: Hey! Ali, don't worry about me and Lucy. Look, we have a baby coming that we gotta take care of. There's nothing more important than that.",
        "Alison: Don't you get it, Aaron? You should dump me, walk away, because if you don't, I'm gonna ruin your life!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Hi. Lieutenant Munson, Oakdale police. Are you Rose D'Angelo's bodyguard?",
        "Crater: That's right.",
        "Hal: I got a couple of questions for you.",
        "Crater: Okay.",
        "Hal: Did you see in Paul's Ryan's trunk a baseball bat that could have been used to deface Rose D'Angelo's car? And was this baseball bat accompanied by a pair of gloves?",
        "Crater: How did you know?",
        "Hal: I'll take that as a yes. Describe the gloves, please.",
        "Crater: They were cloth. Had bits of glass stuck on them. Who told you?",
        "Hal: I'm asking the questions here. Where are these items now?",
        "Crater: In the trunk of Ryan's car.",
        "Hal: Not anymore. Paul said you saw Barbara Ryan at Rose's place tonight. Can you confirm that?",
        "Crater: Yeah, that's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: You're not going anywhere until you hear why I did it.",
        "Rose: I don't care why you did it, Mitzi. You did it!",
        "Mitzi: I'm sorry, Rose.",
        "Rose: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you used our friendship and you treated it like garbage.",
        "Mitzi: It wasn't my fault, okay?! It was yours!",
        "Rose: Oh! It was my fault? I can't wait to hear this! It was my fault! You committed a crime. Let me hear it!",
        "Mitzi: I begged you! I begged you to let me have the shop, okay, 'cause it's not like you're ever gonna need a paycheck ever again. But you said you were gonna sell it. So I figured if I could make some quick cash, I could buy it.",
        "Rose: Did you go to -- a loan shark?",
        "Mitzi: No, a bookie. This guy, Waldo, he gave me a tip on a horse --",
        "Rose: How long did you work in Atlantic City, Mitzi?",
        "Mitzi: It was a sure thing, Rose. Okay? And the horse paid out. Waldo gave me a few more tips and every time, the horse won. Then he gives me a tip on a long shot, guaranteed to come in. I figured if I could place a big enough bet, even you wouldn't be able to turn me down.",
        "Rose: Hmm.",
        "Mitzi: So I placed the bet.",
        "Rose: Let me guess -- the horse didn't win.",
        "Mitzi: Didn't even place.",
        "Rose: And then Waldo wants his cash and you're dippin' into my cash.",
        "Mitzi: It was only supposed to be short-term, all right?",
        "Rose: Uh-huh.",
        "Mitzi: Until I got back on my winning streak, but I didn't. And I kept owing more and more money.",
        "Rose: Of course. Of course.",
        "Mitzi: So I skimmed the deposit bags before I took 'em to the bank.",
        "Rose: And this is my fault?",
        "Mitzi: You were so selfish about the shop.",
        "Rose: \"Selfish\" -- you keep using that word \"selfish.\" It's selfish for me to want to marry the man that I love?!",
        "Mitzi: Look, I'm sorry, Rose. I am, but listen, you're not gonna go to the cops over this? After all we've been through, okay? It's just money.",
        "Rose: Don't you dare stand there and say that this is about money. This is about us and how much you hate me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Fine. You want to know the truth? The truth is the thought of Rose weeping in your arms made me sick. So I drove around for a couple of hours to clear my head. Satisfied?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I am. 'Cause last time, you were givin' me a real hard time about what we should do with the stuff that Crater found in the back of Paul's trunk. I don't want to have to remind you that we're doing things my way.",
        "Molly: I got that. Is there anything else or may I please be excused?",
        "Dusty: No, you can go. Hey, by the way, when you were out on your little drive, did you happen to stop by the police station and tell them that the bat used on Rose's car was sitting in Paul's trunk?",
        "Molly: Go to hell, Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about? I didn't have anything to do with those threats against Rose.",
        "Paul: I'm not talking about the phone calls. You -- you took a baseball bat, you beat up on Rose's car with it and then you planted the baseball bat in the trunk of my car?",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about? I really have lost you, haven't I?",
        "Paul: You just figured that out?",
        "Barbara: You know, I thought that I was coming here tonight so you could help me convince Hal that I -- I need to see Will.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Barbara: I can't lose him. He's my baby. Don't you have some compassion left, son?",
        "Paul: You need to go.",
        "Barbara: No. No! Help me! Help me keep Will! Don't break my heart again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: I thought you wanted to spend thanksgiving in Chicago with your friend Zeke.",
        "Curtis: I was going to, but then I started thinking about your sweet potato pie. Next thing I knew, I was at the bus station.",
        "Jessica: Well, we're just happy you're here. The only thing is, um, since we weren't expecting you to be here and Bonnie's not here, we weren't planning a big Thanksgiving dinner.",
        "Ben: You know things have been pretty chaotic around here.",
        "Curtis: Yeah. Dad told me about Bonnie. I'm really sorry, Jessica. I was glad to hear it didn't change things between you two. You're still gettin' married, right?",
        "Jessica: The way your father has stood by me, there's no way I'm letting this man get away.",
        "Ben: In fact, even though the big wedding isn't happening, we were planning on hopping a plane to the islands and eloping.",
        "Curtis: Tonight?",
        "Ben: Mm-hmm.",
        "Curtis: That's great! Wait a minute, that means I ruined everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: And why do you have to go to Paul's wedding?",
        "Rosanna: Because I've practically planned the entire thing. And besides, he is my friend.",
        "Craig: Well, you're my wife. All right? What is more important? Watching our son wiggle his toes in the warm sand for the very first time or the wedding of a narcissistic beautician that most people could care less about anyways.",
        "Rosanna: Wait a minute, how dare you make me sound like I'm a bad mother when I'm simply trying to keep a commitment to a friend?",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: And all I want is some blissful, uninterrupted time with my gorgeous wife and my lovely son. Far away from everyday distractions.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Far away from any threats to your happy home. I'm not an idiot, Craig. I know what this rush to get us out of town is all about.",
        "Craig: You do?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. You are jealous of Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I can't walk away, Ali. I'm just as responsible for this baby as you are. What's wrong? What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Just the morning sickness -- and afternoon and evening.",
        "Aaron: Maybe you should quit your job. Look, I'm making good money now. I can take care of you.",
        "Alison: No, I can't quit. At least not yet. Babies are expensive. How am I supposed to take care of someone? I can't even take care of myself. I can't even afford my own place.",
        "Aaron: So? We'll just -- we'll keep living at home.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and what about diapers and stuff? Have you ever seen how much those things cost?",
        "Aaron: We can join one of those clubs. You know those big warehouses where you can get discounts if you buy things by bulk. Ali, maybe we start treating this baby as a chance, you know? To show the world that we can handle it. That we can grow up.",
        "Alison: Yeah, right. Everyone freaked out when I told them I was pregnant. No one thinks that I would even make a good mom.",
        "Aaron: I do.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, really. I think we can be some real cool parents. [Phone rings] hold on. Hello?",
        "Holden: Aaron. Lily and I need you to come home and talk. Is now a good time?",
        "Aaron: Alison's with me.",
        "Holden: Even better. Emily and Susan are here and we would all love to sit down and talk to the both of you.",
        "Aaron: Okay. We'll be there -- we'll be there soon. We've been summoned. Lily, my dad, your sister and your mom are at my house. They want to talk to us.",
        "Alison: What are we supposed to tell them that they don't already know?",
        "Aaron: The big news. That you and I have everything under control. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: This is the woman you saw outside Rose D'Angelo's place?",
        "Crater: Barbara Ryan -- yeah.",
        "Hal: Right. Was anyone with her? A man, maybe?",
        "Crater: No. She was alone -- solo.",
        "Hal: Really.",
        "Crater: Yeah.",
        "Hal: Well, now, that's very funny, because I have one of my best cops tailing her, and in his report, he didn't say anything about losing her.",
        "Crater: Yeah, well, like you said, he was tailing her. So maybe he was so far behind her that I didn't really notice.",
        "Hal: You'd better be telling me the truth or I'm going to make you very unhappy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: I don't hate you, Rose, I swear. I just wanted a piece of the dream that you wouldn't share.",
        "Rose: Stop blaming me for what happened!",
        "Mitzi: You owed me.",
        "Rose: I owe you nothing -- nothing but loyalty and friendship. And I always gave you both. I gave you a place to live, I gave you a job, my friends were your friends -- what do you do? You spit in my face. You think I didn't give you enough? Wait till you see your world without me in it!",
        "Mitzi: What, are you sayin' you're never gonna forgive me? After all the people who have forgiven you? I mean, you slept with Dusty and Paul's still gonna marry you.",
        "Rose: Oh, thanks for bringing up.",
        "Mitzi: Why don't you just be a little generous here?",
        "Rose: I'll be a little generous. I'm gonna wait until after the wedding to tell Tom Hughes exactly what you did.",
        "Mitzi: You can't go to the district attorney and tell him, or I'm dead, okay? They're gonna lock me up and throw away the key!",
        "Rose: Ohh, well, then I hope you really stole a lot of money from me to get a really good attorney.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Mitzi: I can't go to jail, Rose! I won't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You have to talk to Hal. You have make him listen. You have to make him understand that Will needs his mother.",
        "Paul: No. No, it's bad for Will to be around you. Hal finally figured out that you, as a rule, do more harm than good. That's why he got a restraining order.",
        "Barbara: I admit that I've made some very poor choices and that I should've shielded your little brother from them. But don't you understand? I was reacting to trauma. I am different now.",
        "Paul: Uh-huh. You planted evidence in the trunk of my car!",
        "Barbara: No, I didn't! I haven't been anywhere near here!",
        "Paul: Don't lie to me! Rose's bodyguard saw you poking around here tonight.",
        "Barbara: I have not been here! The guy's lying, Paul!",
        "Paul: Why would he do that?",
        "Barbara: I have no idea! I don't know why, but I know what -- you know what? I can prove it. I can prove it. Officer, please, please --",
        "Bennett: Everything okay?",
        "Barbara: Have you been following me all right long? Yes. Have I been anywhere near here tonight? Please tell my son.",
        "Bennett: That's correct. I've been with Ms. Ryan the whole time.",
        "Barbara: You see? I'm innocent!",
        "Barbara: And whoever is threatening her, I hope they succeed. Because your little bride deserves to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: My mother can be very clever. If she gave you the slip tonight, you shouldn't feel bad. She's very slippery. You wouldn't be the first.",
        "Bennett: She hasn't been out of my sight the whole evening.",
        "Paul: Right. Thank you.",
        "Bennett: I'll be outside.",
        "Barbara: I'm not the monster you think I am.",
        "Paul: I am not letting you get anywhere near Will.",
        "Barbara: Paul, please --",
        "Paul: And whatever ideas you may or may not have about giving Officer Bennett the slip again on my wedding day, you need to put them out of your head. Because if you come within 500 feet of Rose, I will tell Will every horrible thing you've ever done. And he will hate you until the day you finally just die.",
        "Barbara: How can you be so heartless?",
        "Paul: You should ask yourself. It all began the day that you kidnapped Rose. That you paid Dusty to seduce Rose.",
        "Barbara: Rose. Rose. It's always all about Rose, isn't it? You know what? She has destroyed you. She has killed everything good in you. And whoever is threatening her, I hope they succeed. Because your little bride deserves to die.",

        "Rosanna: Why else are you so desperate to get me out of town, hmm? You squire me off for a few days, and by the time we return, Paul and Rose will have conveniently left for Paris.",
        "Craig: Listen, listen, listen, your girlfriend Paul is not the reason I want to get you out of Oakdale.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, it's not Paul. Then what?",
        "Craig: Okay, you got me. There's a little piece of beachfront property that's coming up for auction at the end of the month. And I wanted to see it before the bidding starts. But I don't want to do it without, you know, you and the kids.",

        "Jessica: No, you did not. Stop saying that. Look, tomorrow, we'll have a lovely Thanksgiving dinner, and then the next day, your father and I will get on a plane to the islands and then we will jump that broom.",
        "Curtis: Well, why wait till the next day? Why not catch a flight right after the sweet potato pie? When you leave, I leave. I'll go right back to Zeke's.",
        "Ben: I like the way that man thinks. Look, I'm gonna run to the store and grab a turkey, pick up some cornbread stuffing and some sweet potatoes.",

        "Craig: Just what?",
        "Rosanna: I've spent the last few Thanksgivings at Emma's, and it's always been a little bittersweet. Nothing makes you more aware of not having a family than the holidays. I was just -- hoping --",
        "Craig: That this year you'd like to show up with a family of your own? I suppose we -- we could do it. Be hard on Lucy, though, wouldn't it? Seeing Aaron?",

        "Craig: Hey, hey, hey, hey, you don't need fantasies. Come here. Come here. Aw, hey, we're gonna have dozens of family dinners. Cabot'll be in his high chair. Lucy will finally meet somebody decent. Then Cabot will marry a nice girl and Lucy and Cabot will bring their families over for Thanksgiving and we can raise a glass and feel profoundly grateful.

        "Rosanna: On one condition.",
        "Craig: Why does everything with you have to come with a caveat, by the way?",
        "Rosanna: Because it does. Lucy has to stay here with Lucinda. And you have to refrain from any and all snide remarks about Aaron, all right? No telling her that she was wrong and you were right.",
        "Craig: That's three conditions.",
        "Rosanna: Well, take it or leave it.",

        "Dusty: Then look me in the eye -- look me in the eye and tell me you're with me -- or against me. Hey, where does this go?",
        "Ben: And Harris scores! You are looking at the last butterball in the store, perhaps the last in Oakdale. Yes, sir, spied it from three aisles away, cut through produce, duped down the aisle, raced to the checkout line -- go long, Curtis.",

        "Ben: I was just kidding. I was kidding, really. Really. Put this in the fridge?",

        "Lily: Aaron, we're very aware of your financial situation.",
        "Susan: Ali, I know what you earn to a penny. So you're gonna be on my insurance plan until the baby is born, and then I'll split the cost of the insurance and the pediatrician with Lily and Holden.",
        "Aaron: We can pay for what the baby needs.",
        "Emily: Oh, Aaron, you have no idea. But that's okay -- you know what? I've got Daniel's crib in the garage, along with his stroller and the bassinet and toys and clothes. I have so many clothes for you.",

        "Alison: I know that they want to help, but the way that they're treating us -- like they're so sure that we're gonna fail. And maybe they're right -- maybe I can't handle having a baby!",
