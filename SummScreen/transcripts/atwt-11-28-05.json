        "Maddie: You don't want to call Margo's.",
        "Mike: Sure I do.",
        "Maddie: Katie's not there.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Maddie: She's out.",
        "Mike: Out?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: Okay, why is this like pulling teeth with you?",
        "Maddie: 'Cause I promised I wouldn't say anything. Katie is on a mission of mercy for a friend, okay? Isn't that enough?",
        "Mike: Well, you have exactly one minute to tell me what's going on. Tell me.",
        "Maddie: You know I am worried about Henry. Well, Katie is, too.",
        "Mike: She wasn't a few hours ago.",
        "Maddie: She is now. I know B.J. did something to Henry, and so does Katie.",
        "Mike: No, no, no. Tell me you did not wind up Katie and point her in B.J.'s direction.",
        "Maddie: No, she wanted to do this.",
        "Mike: Look, if the man's so dangerous he would hurt Henry, what do you think he'd do to Katie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.",
        "B.J.: It's okay. You want to tell me what's wrong?",
        "Katie: I can't.",
        "B.J.: You said you were having a problem with Mike?",
        "Katie: Yeah, and you're the last person who needs to hear -- you know what, just forget it. Forget him.",
        "B.J.: Wow, must have been some fight.",
        "Katie: We've had worse. Can I just -- I don't know, I'll just do e-mails or something that I can do alone. I'll be okay.",
        "B.J.: Okay. [Katie sobs] Katie \u0096",

        "Meg: Bet you're sorry you gave Mama the night off.",
        "Dusty: Sorry? No, Mama needs a break. All cooks need a break.",
        "Meg: I wouldn't know.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's why I'm telling you.",
        "Meg: You know, I never claimed to be great in the kitchen.",
        "Dusty: So the kitchen's not the room for you. We'll have other rooms in the house for you.",
        "Meg: We will?",
        "Dusty: We better.",
        "Meg: You mean at our new place?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, at our new place. Where else?",
        "Meg: Are you sure?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I'm sure. Let's do it. The sooner, the better.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Dusty: Let's do it. Let's move in tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Will, you have to believe that Paul just wants to help you.",
        "Will: Why? Because no one in our family could ever have their own agenda.",
        "Jennifer: Not Paul. He knows what we have to face with --",
        "Will: Speak of the devil. Don't forget, Paul's her son.",
        "Jennifer: Mom. I'm guessing you brought good news.",
        "Barbara: Well, a plan anyway. Okay, I have a call in to Dr. Kitridge, and our lawyers have already spoken to him. And they have a motion in action here.",
        "Will: I don't need Dr. Kitridge.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you do. Our lawyers can use his word to mitigate your -- to mitigate the charges.",
        "Will: So in other words, he's gonna explain to the world that I'm still crazy.",
        "Barbara: Honey --",
        "Will: Is that what you mean?",
        "Barbara: The first rule about being a defendant --",
        "Will: Oh, and who would know better than you?",
        "Barbara: The first rule about being a defendant, as any good lawyer will tell you, is not to admit to anything.",
        "Will: I'm not a defendant. I didn't do it. Jen --",
        "Jennifer: Mom's just trying to help you get out.",
        "Will: But both of you know, right? Both of you know I didn't poison Iris, that I would never do anything like that ever again. Tell me you believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Oh, man, it's so good to be home. That hospital food stunk.",
        "Stan: Iris, honey, you got to get off your feet.",
        "Iris: I've been flat on my back for days.",
        "Stan: Well, that works for me, baby.",
        "Iris: I don't feel so good, Stan. [Stan groans] Hello, I was just poisoned.",
        "Stan: Well, that was your choice, baby.",
        "Iris: No, no, no. That was Will Munson's choice. Personally, I would have gone for the staged fall or something like that. But you know, we wanted to point the finger at the right person, so poison it was. Now, all we have to do is wait for the wheels of justice to turn.",
        "[Stan laughs]",
        "Stan: More like the wheels of fortune. But it's all yours. It's your grandson's trust fund. You took all the risk.",
        "Iris: Oh, Stannie, you aided and abetted, and I just won't ever forget that. I mean, that is a commitment you never forget. So thanks to my daughter, you and me are set for life. No, no, no.",

        "Carly: I called you because I wanted to invite you here. I want you here.",
        "Gwen: Even if I need your help?",
        "Carly: Especially then. What do you need?",
        "Gwen: It's Will. He's in trouble. They say he poisoned Iris. He's been arrested.",
        "Carly: Wow. What would you like me to do?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I thought that since Jack was a cop, that --",
        "Carly: Well, he's not. He's not anymore.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. Never mind.",
        "Carly: No, Gwen, please. I want to help you. Just give me a chance. Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs",
        "Carly: I just need a little history here. How did Will end up getting arrested?",
        "Gwen: Iris got so sick that they took her to the hospital. They found methanol in her system, and I guess that's what killed that other woman, Rose d'angelo.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: There was a receipt with Will's signature on it, and my mom said that he threatened her, and his entire family believes it.",
        "Carly: And you don't?",
        "Gwen: No. They think he's relapsed. They're still treating him like he's some sick little kid.",
        "Carly: It doesn't even make any sense. Even if Will wanted to do something like that, why would he use the same poison and sign a receipt?",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Carly: It'd be like pointing a big arrow at himself. No, this has got to be a setup.",
        "Gwen: Why do you get in five minutes what nobody else seems to understand?",
        "Carly: Because I've seen your mother at work.",
        "Gwen: She's doing it to get rid of him, right?",
        "Carly: I told you, she wants to get rid of anybody that's close to you.",
        "Gwen: So what should I do?",
        "Carly: Just go and see Will, and try to keep him calm, okay?",
        "Gwen: I did. But I had this -- I had to leave. They wouldn't let me take the baby in.",
        "Carly: Oh, I -- bring the baby to my house. The sitter is there watching sage. She can watch Billy, too. And then you go and see Will and spend as much time with him as you need to. Just leave the rest to me, all right?",
        "Gwen: What are you gonna do?",
        "Carly: Gwen, the less you know, the better.",
        "Gwen: What does that mean?",
        "Carly: If you want my help, you're just gonna have to trust me. Can you do that?",
        "Gwen: I'll try. Thanks, Carly.",
        "Carly: You did the right thing coming to me. What on earth am I gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You got plans after cleanup besides getting lucky?",
        "Meg: If only you had a little bit more confidence in yourself, honey.",
        "Dusty: What happened? Did you change your mind?",
        "Meg: Well, I -- I don't see any reason to rush into this, you know? I mean, I can move in, you could stay over. You don't need to make a big declaration.",
        "Dusty: All I need is a drawer. Maybe half a closet.",
        "Meg: Medicine cabinet's all mine.",
        "Dusty: I don't need it. Deal?",
        "Meg: Deal. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Dusty: That's my favorite word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I don't believe this. How could you think I would poison someone, anyone?",
        "Jennifer: Nobody thinks that.",
        "Will: You do!",
        "Barbara: Honey, it doesn't matter what anybody thinks or says, except the judge.",
        "Will: It matters, Mom, to me.",
        "Barbara: Honey, the judge is the only one who can keep you in here, and all he cares about is the evidence.",
        "Will: Do you really think I'm that stupid?",
        "Barbara: Look, I need for you to focus here -- focus. There's a lot of evidence that we have to shoot down, because the way it stands right now --",
        "Will: No, we're done.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Will: We're done talking!",
        "Barbara: Like hell we are. Now you listen to me, Will Munson. With this amount of evidence and your history, we're gonna have to do some pretty fancy footwork to get your out of here! So you will listen and cooperate to the lawyers and the shrinks and whoever else it takes. Because I'll tell you something, the way it stands right now, they won't be sending you back to the hospital. You'll be going to prison.",

        "Mike: Katie's not answering her cell phone.",
        "Maddie: She must not want to talk.",
        "Mike: Or maybe she can't. Did she say where she was going?",
        "Maddie: No, just to sit tight.",
        "Mike: Oh, I can't do that.",
        "Maddie: You really think that B.J.'s gonna hurt her? Okay, I know he was really scary at the Halloween party. But he thinks he's in love with her. He's only gonna go so far.",
        "Mike: Do you have my cell number?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: You stay here in case Katie comes back. If she does, you call me.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie sobs]",
        "B.J.: Sorry.",
        "Katie: Are you?",
        "B.J.: Mm-hmm, yeah. It's just, you can't expect me to just stand here and watch you cry.",
        "Katie: I shouldn't have come here. I should go. This was a total mistake.",
        "B.J.: No, no. You don't have to be the one to leave.",
        "Katie: No, you were here first.",
        "B.J.: We're not 12 years old. I mean, you need the distraction, and I can work anywhere.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I think I was kidding myself thinking I can get anything done anyway. I'll just go somewhere. Uh, I don't have any more tissues. Can get anything done anyway. I'll just go somewhere. Uh, I don't have any more tissues.",
        "B.J.: One for the road? You know, I really don't think you should be driving.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'll just pull over if I get really cloudy. Oh, this is ridiculous! I should be mad at Mike, and I am! I am furious with him! I wouldn't be standing here with no one to talk to if he hadn't cut me off from everyone else that I care about. Well, that was enough of that.",
        "B.J.: Are you really sure? 'Cause Katie, seriously, if you need a drink or a shoulder to cry on, I'm right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: But this is wrong.",
        "B.J.: Okay.",
        "Katie: I mean, I did come here to be alone.",
        "B.J.: Understood.",
        "Katie: I don't know why, though. It's a TV station. They run 24/7, right?",
        "B.J.: Yeah, there's always people here. So if you want to work, you'll definitely have company.",
        "Katie: I don't think I'm fit company for anyone.",
        "B.J.: Oh, hell, Katie, I beg to differ. I mean, if this is you at your worst, then you don't have any problems at all. You're not a burden to anyone.",
        "Katie: Well, that's sweet of you to say.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, I'm just a sweet guy, I guess, who would love to take you away from here and away from all the embarrassing questions. In fact, you know what, I'll even come up with a good story to tell the waitress in case you start crying in your drink. Yeah, I can do that. Or better yet, you know, you could come with me back to Fairwinds. You know, you wouldn't have to answer to anyone.",
        "Katie: Well, except for Henry and half your staff.",
        "B.J.: Well, they have off. It's a holiday.",
        "Katie: They do?",
        "B.J.: Yeah, it would just be you and me.",
        "Katie: I don't know.",
        "B.J.: Right. I bet that's just, you know, 'cause Halloween. I can imagine what that sounds like. But at least let me call you a car service, 'cause I -- I just -- I can't see you driving.",
        "Katie: No, wait, wait. Don't leave yet. Uh, I guess I'm just a little more wobbly than I thought I was. Actually, being alone and not staring at my own four walls sounds kind of good.",
        "B.J.: Okay, you got it.",
        "Katie: But you're sure Henry won't be there. I mean, the last thing I need is him pumping me for details.",
        "B.J.: I won't let him do that.",
        "Katie: Are you sure? 'Cause you know, he doesn't usually stop once he gets going.",
        "[B.J. laughs]",
        "B.J.: That's true. But he's on a business trip.",
        "Katie: You're sure?",
        "B.J.: Absolutely positive. So, are you ready to go?",
        "Katie: Sure, yeah.",
        "Mike: Where the hell do you think you're going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That's the last time I do dishes, okay? I cook from now on. What is that?",
        "Meg: I told Mama I was leaving today. And she said I wasn't allowed to move out again without taking this.",
        "Dusty: Dead body?",
        "Meg: Sort of.",
        "Dusty: What's this, 21 questions?",
        "Meg: It's a hope chest.",
        "Dusty: That sounds very sweet.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop it, okay? I was a kid. I thought it was stupid and old- fashioned. It wasn't even my idea.",
        "Dusty: Let's have a look.",
        "Meg: No, absolutely not.",
        "Dusty: Okay. All right. We'll find a closet for it.",
        "Meg: Sure.",
        "Dusty: But let's have a look anyway.",
        "Meg: No, come on. Dusty, please.",
        "Dusty: Why are you so embarrassed?",
        "Meg: Come on, it's old, and it's musty and it's --",
        "Dusty: This is your childhood we're talking about. Who cares? [Meg laughs] A-ha, let me guess. You and your mother picked this one out together on a shopping trip.",
        "Meg: You know, it was the usual drag-out, knockdown.",
        "Dusty: Well, it looks like you won.",
        "Meg: No, the one I wanted was red.",
        "Dusty: This one works.",

        "Will: Like it was ever true.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, boy.",
        "Barbara: It's not enough.",
        "Will: Given my medical history, you mean?",
        "Barbara: You threatened Iris Dumbrowski in a public place. There were eyewitnesses.",
        "Will: Okay, let me ask you something, Mom. Because you obviously think that I'm so unbalanced and a homicidal guy, deranged enough to try and kill my girlfriend's mother.",
        "Barbara: No, no, I didn't say that!",
        "Jennifer: Settle down.",
        "Will: Let's just start there. How stupid do you think I am?",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Jennifer: What she is trying to say is that it doesn't matter what we think.",

        "Gwen: They're not here.",
        "Barbara: Yes, we all want Will out of here, and I'm working to make that happen. He is getting help from his family, so if you'd please give us a little privacy --",
        "Will: They think I'm guilty.",
        "Barbara: I didn't say that, Will.",
        "Gwen: Are you nuts?",
        "Barbara: I will overlook your limited and very unhelpful vocabulary.",
        "Gwen: Will would never hurt anybody. He's your son. Don't you know that about him?",
        "Barbara: Don't you tell me about my son.",
        "Gwen: Yeah? Then you better learn quick. Will, I talked to somebody who knows you're innocent. We'll get you out, okay? I'm here.",

        "Iris: You talking about the food or the drink?",
        "Stan: Well, I'm a better bartender than -- hey, what happened to all the booze?",
        "Iris: The cops took it to test it.",
        "Stan: Oh, no. All the liquor stores are closed today.",
        "Iris: Yes, Stan. Today is the day you're supposed to stay home and be thankful.",
        "Stan: We could be just as thankful over at Yo's.",
        "Iris: Stannie, come here, sweetie. Now, listen real carefully, okay? I just got home from the hospital. I feel like dirt!",
        "Stan: But you'd feel a lot better after a gin and tonic.",
        "Iris: Yeah, maybe, but you know what? I got this prescription here, and I think I'm gonna do this instead.",
        "Stan: Oh, who's gonna tell?",
        "Iris: My liver, my kidneys at my next doctor appointment? I am going to do this straight by the book. Could you go the pharmacy and drop this off for me?",
        "Stan: Yeah, I'll stop by on my way home.",
        "Iris: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. From Yo's? Right. You know what, why don't you just drop me at the pharmacy? I'll take a cab home. They water their drinks down, you know that, don't you?",
        "Stan: Well then, no doggie glass for you, young lady.",

        "Jack: Well, I was at the house when Gwen stopped by looking for the sitter. She told me what was going on, and I knew you'd come straight over here. So I sent Holden off with the kids, and I dropped by to keep you from jail.",

        "Mike: Am I supposed to know what you're talking about?",
        "Katie: See? See? That's what I'm talking about right there. You're not understanding me that this is real. I'm a grown woman who can make decisions in her life. I don't need you second-guessing me every second.",

        "Will: The being in jail part, yeah. Not the rest of it. You're forgetting why I was so easy to set up, Gwen. I did something really bad a long time ago -- something I can't blame anyone else for. And after that, I didn't think anything good would ever happen to me again. Then I met you.",
