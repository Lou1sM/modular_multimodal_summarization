        "Alison: You're -- you're back in Oakdale for good?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Alison: But what about Philadelphia? I mean the famous children's hospital? And pediatrics is your thing; I thought you were going to love working there.",
        "Chris: I did. But not as much as much as I -- let's just say that things didn't pan out the way that I expected.",
        "Alison: Why? What happened out there?",
        "Chris: Well, it's more of what happened here. Alison, I need to ask you something. I -- [Beeper sounds] I'd better take this. Don't go anywhere.",
        "Alison: I won't.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: He's supposed to be gone. He's supposed to be out of my life.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, keep dreaming, Alison. He's back, and I think he's on to you. Or at least he will be in the next few minutes.",
        "Alison: You don't think that he -- ?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, I do. Chris is figuring out that the baby you're carrying is his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You want me to call Mom?",
        "Hal: If you call Barbara's cell, she'll see your number come up. She'll want to talk to you. And then you can just ask her to meet you somewhere.",
        "Will: But I'm not supposed to see her. You're the one who made the order. Why are you changing your mind?",
        "Hal: Yeah, yeah. Do you remember when we talked about how sometimes Barbara's emotions can get the best of her and then she does things -- things that she can't seem to help? Will, you know that she's really, really upset about Paul marrying Rose, don't you?",
        "Will: Yeah. 'Cause Rose messed everything up.",
        "Hal: Well, maybe, maybe not. But if you call your mom and you get her to meet you, then maybe we can stop her from doing something that's gonna mess up this wedding. Something that we might all regret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Everything I need for this particular wedding. The perfect outfit -- and the perfect accessory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Are you going to answer me or not? Why are you here in Rose's house alone?",
        "Molly: The door was unlocked.",
        "Emily: That's not what I asked you, Molly. What possible reason do you have to be here when Rose isn't?",
        "Molly: I came to have it out with her, okay, Emily?",
        "Emily: You know what? Whatever you've got going on with Rose, can you let it go, all right? At least for today. She's getting married for Pete's sake.",
        "Molly: That's a crock. That little tramp's not gettin' married today.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Molly: I'm talking about the fact that Rose spent last night right here in the arms of Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I saw Rose this morning, and she finally saw the light. She's saying good-bye to that loser Paul Ryan for good this time.",
        "Lily: Hmm, that's interesting. Because I saw Rose less than an hour ago, and she decided to give Paul a second chance.",
        "Dusty: I wonder why? Some last-minute pitch from you?",
        "Lily: I know my sister. I know she wants this wedding to happen.",
        "Dusty: Are you out of your mind? You sent your sister back to that lunatic? He's a dangerous guy, and your sister isn't safe anywhere near him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I told you that I needed some time to think and that I would call you when I was ready to talk to you.",
        "Paul: I know. But I wanted -- I needed to talk to you. And I had a feeling I would find you here.",
        "Rose: You know when I was a little girl, my mom used to grab me by the hand and take me to church, because that's what you did when all those big things in your life would happen. You come to church when the world's upside-down. You don't have answers to your questions, you come here. So what did you do this morning, Paul?",
        "Paul: I needed answers, too. So I went to the one place where I thought I could find them.",
        "Rose: Well, did you?",
        "Paul: All my answers lie with you, Rose.",
        "Rose: Are you okay?",
        "Paul: Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. It doesn't matter now.",
        "Rose: Of course it matters.",
        "Paul: No, no. It doesn't matter, Rose. The only thing that matters is the truth. All of it. Because without the truth, nothing can save us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Rose and Paul are getting married today, Molly. You are crazy.",
        "Molly: No, Rose is crazy if she thinks she can still play two men against each other while the rest of the town thinks she is Atlantic City's version of a saint. Because I'm telling you, it's gonna end now!",
        "Emily: You need to leave, Molly, now.",
        "Molly: Gee, Emily, I used to think you were really smart when it came to people. That is until you became Rose D'Angelo's pet guard dog.",
        "Carly: Hello? Oh, I can't wait for everybody to see this dress. I think it's my best creation yet.",
        "Molly: So I guess that's what you tell all the brides?",
        "Carly: Hey, Mol. I didn't expect that you'd be here. Why are you here?",
        "Molly: We don't confide in each other anymore, remember? Hey, you guys have a really swell time with your slut friend, okay? Oh, by the way, don't expect a big turnout for your bridal masterpiece.",
        "Carly: What was that?",
        "Emily: I have no idea. But your cousin completely lost it.",
        "Carly: But why? Why would she be so convinced that Rose isn't getting married?",
        "Emily: Carly? Remember the rehearsal? Rose's pearl necklace broke. What if it really was a bad omen? What if Molly's right and this wedding isn't going to happen?",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, Emily. Because my cousin has gone bonkers and a pearl necklace was badly strung?",
        "Emily: No. Because of Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You don't fully understand what happened.",
        "Lily: Oh, I know everything that happened. Rose told me about the voice- changing thing, that Paul apparently used it to make --",
        "Dusty: No, not apparently, not apparently. He did it. And he wasn't phoning in a shopping list. He threatened your sister's life. Doesn't that mean anything to you?",
        "Lily: He's trying to protect her from you. Yeah, you're obsessed with Rose. Yeah, she didn't want you in any part of her life. You didn't like that. So now you've even used me to make the guy look bad. No wonder he feels desperate.",
        "Dusty: Desperate?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Who are you? The guy's spin doctor? He broke the law. He trashed her car, and he threatened her life.",
        "Lily: You don't know that. No, no, you don't know.",
        "Dusty: I'd bet my life on it. You don't have to be a scientist to see a pattern of behavior here. He bugs my place. He fakes a lease in Paris. He trashes her car. He threatened her life. He's escalating. Let me ask you -- what's he gonna do once they're married and he drags her off to Paris?",
        "Lily: He's going to love her for the rest of her life.",
        "Dusty: Which might be brief in her case.",
        "Lily: Okay, I really can't -- I can't listen to you anymore.",
        "Dusty: Lily? This is important, too important for you to screw up. Tell me where your sister is.",
        "Lily: No. Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Only the truth can save us? What are you --? What are you talkin' about?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me, huh? We're supposed to get married tonight, Rose. Do you still want to do that?",
        "Rose: You don't -- look, why don't you sit down?",
        "Paul: No, I don't want to sit down, Rose. I want us to talk. We got to talk. I'm facing up to what I did. All right?",
        "Rose: Okay.",
        "Paul: I made a mistake. I made a really stupid mistake. But I did what I did because I love you, Rose. I love you more than anything.",
        "Rose: You made a threatening phone call to me. You used a voice changer to do it, and you're telling me you did it because you love me?",
        "Paul: I did that. I bought the voice thingy, I made the phone call.",
        "Rose: Why? Why, Paul?",
        "Paul: To protect you.",
        "Rose: That's nuts. That is absolutely crazy.",
        "Paul: I know it sounds crazy -- now. I mean, at the time, it seemed like a really good idea, Rose. I was scared. I was -- I was terrified.",
        "Rose: Of what?",
        "Paul: Of losing you. Think about it. We were gonna go to Paris. We were gonna get married. We were gonna have this beautiful life. Then that thing happened with Barbara and Will, and then the next thing I know, Dusty is saying whatever he needs to say and doing whatever he needs to do to talk you out of getting married to me. And I just felt like wherever I turned there was somebody, there was something threatening us.",
        "Rose: But you told me to hang in. I mean, you held me in your arms and you told me, yet you're the one that was scaring me.",
        "Paul: That was wrong. I'm standing here, and I'm telling you the truth. And I'm hoping that if we both do that, if we both tell each other the truth, then maybe we can find a way past this.",
        "Rose: You just said that we had this beautiful dream, beautiful dream, now it's all in pieces.",
        "Paul: Find a way to put the pieces back together. If that's what you want, Rose. I mean, am I wrong to think that I can come here and we can both tell each other the truth and put that beautiful dream back together?",
        "Rose: Do you remember the dream? I mean, you still -- you still got that? You still have it in you?",
        "Paul: You tell me. I think you and I are special, Rose.",
        "Rose: Yeah. We used to be.",
        "Paul: No, we still are. You know, from the moment that I saw you, my guardian angel in the airport, up to the time I saw you in the chair and I took you down, took the rope off your neck, we've always looked out for each other. Am I a fool to still believe in all that?",
        "Rose: You are not a fool. You are the farthest thing from it.",
        "Paul: So what are you thinking?",
        "Rose: I think -- that a life with you would be the best thing that could ever happen to me.",
        "Paul: And?",
        "Rose: And I think that we should get married -- tonight. Oh, my God, I love you. Thank you. Thank you for telling me the truth about everything.",
        "Paul: Yeah, no, no. I need for you to do the same thing. Now I need you to tell me about everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Chris can't think he's this baby's father.",
        "Katie: But Chris is the baby's father. At least, that's what you told me before you made this abrupt detour into Aaron world.",
        "Alison: I know, I know.",
        "Katie: Then he has a right to know.",
        "Alison: No, if Chris loved me that would be one thing. But he doesn't. And I'm not gonna use a baby to rope him into being with me. I can't handle that.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, after a while, I think your feelings may change.",
        "Alison: I will always love Chris. I know that, and I can't help that. And just thinking about having to see him all the time because he's the baby's father, but him not loving me back, that just kills me.",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, think about what you're doing to Aaron, then. You're lying to him that he's a father of a baby. I mean, you're turning his whole world upside down. That not right, is it?",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no. And I will tell Aaron the truth.",
        "Katie: When?",
        "Alison: When I have everything with Chris figured out, okay?",
        "Katie: What's to figure out? The baby belongs to him. He's gonna figure it out sooner than later.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Katie: The baby's not just gonna be a mini you. What if it looks exactly like Chris? But even before that, he can figure it out just by doing a little math. He's gonna know you're lying, Alison. Just come clean. I'm telling you.",
        "Alison: Please, Katie. Please just -- just let me think about all this. I'll work it out. But just in the meantime, I just have stay out of Chris's way. Everything was so much easier when he was gone.",
        "Katie: Okay. Um -- okay. Are you going to Paul and Rose's wedding?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Katie: All right. I'll see you there.",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "[Alison screams]",
        "Chris: Alison, we have to talk.",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry. I've got some stuff to do.",
        "Chris: No, no. It'll have to wait, because this can't. It's about us, Alison. You, me and the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I've gotten Mom in trouble before. I don't want to do it again.",
        "Hal: Hey. You did not get her in trouble. She broke the rules. She went against the court order.",
        "Will: So why do you want me to go against it?",
        "Hal: Will, it's not that simple.",
        "Will: Why can't it be that simple? Why can't she just be happy? Why can't this whole family just be happy?",
        "Hal: I don't know the answer to all those questions. But I do know that it's not your job to make everything better. It's not your responsibility for how other people feel or what they do.",
        "Will: If it's not my responsibility, why do you want me to call Mom?",
        "Hal: You know what? Forget the whole thing. I never should have involved you in this. Forget it. I'll find a way to deal with --",
        "Will: Wait, no, Dad. I'm sorry. I really want to help. 'Cause I don't want Mom to do anything that'll hurt her. And if I'm the only person that can do that, I will.",
        "Hal: You're sure?",
        "Will: Yeah. Just tell me what to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hmm. [Phone ringing] Will? Honey, is that you?",
        "Will: Hi, Mom. Where are you? 'Cause I'd -- I'd like to see you, like, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I just need for you to be honest with me, Rose.",
        "Rose: I was very honest with you. I just told you that I wanted to marry you. What else do you want me to say?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I just wanna know what you did. I mean, what you were thinking when you found out I made that call?",
        "Rose: What difference does it make now?",
        "Paul: It makes a big difference to me.",
        "Rose: All right. I was -- I had a million emotions goin' on in my head. I wanted to hit you. Kiss you. Pretend it didn't happen. But it did happen. And it left me with a lot of doubts, a lot of questions.",
        "Paul: I just hate it, you know, the idea. When I picture you in a panic running to my place, and then -- and I hate the idea of you going through all of that freak out by yourself.",
        "Rose: Yeah, I was a little freaked out.",
        "Paul: So what'd you do?",
        "Rose: I went home.",
        "Paul: You went home?",
        "Rose: Yeah. I didn't want to be around that place. It was so loud, and I just needed a place to hide.",
        "Paul: To hide from -- from me?",
        "Rose: No. I just needed some quiet. I wanted to be alone.",
        "Paul: Well, did you think, even for a minute, that I didn't love you?",
        "Rose: I didn't know what to think. I was very confused.",
        "Dusty: I'm still crazy about you.",
        "Rose: But I'm not confused anymore. Because I know you love me. And I love you. And that's all that matters. I don't love anybody more than I love you.",
        "Paul: See, that's what bothers me. I mean, I -- it bugs me you had to go through all that, you know, going home all alone.",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Let me stay here tonight. I'll hold you till morning. Okay?",
        "Rose: I'd like that. Yep, I hate being alone.",
        "Paul: But you managed. You made it through that long night all by yourself.",
        "Rose: Yeah. Yeah. All alone in my house, by myself, all night.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you had to go through all that without someone to hold you, make you feel safe.",
        "Rose: Its water under the bridge.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. Water under the bridge.",
        "Rose: Oh, look at the time. I gotta -- I gotta go. I gotta go. The girls are probably waiting for me to get beautiful.",
        "Paul: You've always been the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.",
        "Rose: Just wait till you see me at the altar.",
        "Paul: Well, I'll see you there. Liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: You tell your little twin this -- her fun is over. Because I'm gonna make sure there's hell to pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: And you think you're being smart and protecting your sister? You have no idea you're puttin' her right into the hands of a madman.",
        "Lily: Oh, no. No, no. I'm keeping her as far away from you as possible.",
        "Dusty: Whatever. I convinced her to drop that loser before, and I can do it again.",
        "Lily: Well, it's too late.",
        "Molly: What's going on?",
        "Dusty: Too late?",
        "Lily: Yep.",
        "Dusty: We'll see. Help me find Rose.",
        "Molly: Is this about the wedding? Does this mean that Paul and Rose are getting married after all?",
        "Lily: What do you care? Oh, I'm sorry. That answer to that question just left here trying to convince my sister to give him second chance --",
        "Molly: Shut your mouth. You don't know me. Though you may think you do.",
        "Lily: I know everything about you. And I know Dusty. And obviously you want more from him than he's willing to give you. So I'm gonna tell you something that I told my sister. He is a loser.",
        "Molly: You know, your sister, Lily, is the problem here. Do you not get that? She doesn't care what she does or who she hurts along the way, and that's gonna stop. It's gonna stop right now, 'cause I'm gonna put an end to it -- personally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Now, just because Molly said that Rose slept with Dusty, doesn't mean that it really happened.",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay, you're right. So, it could be a lie. But, then again, it could be true, Carly. I mean, didn't Rose leave Paul for Dusty once before? See, so maybe things aren't resolved between the two of them as she would like everybody to believe.",
        "Carly: Maybe not. Where is she? Rose should be back by now.",
        "Emily: I don't know. I mean, she gave me the key, because she said she had to run some last-minute errands. That was a long time ago.",
        "Carly: Well, she'd better get here soon. This is her wedding day.",
        "Emily: Unless it isn't. Rose.",
        "Carly: Hey, Rose. Where have you been?",
        "Rose: I'm all right. I've had a hell of a day.",
        "Carly: Well, is there anything that you would like to tell your dear, trustworthy friends?",
        "Rose: About what?",
        "Emily: Oh, I don't know -- the wedding, anything.",
        "Rose: Actually, there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You call off this wedding and everybody will want to comfort Rose. You and I know where she's going to find the most comfort -- right in Dustin's bed. You know the truth, Paul. You've seen it for yourself. Now, do what you have to do. And calling off the wedding isn't it.",
        "Dusty: Paul is such a fool.",
        "Rose: How could he think that I could love him? I could never love Paul after I've had you.",
        "Paul: No!",
        "Dusty: Paul is such a fool.",
        "Rose: I could never love Paul.",
        "James: If she lies to you about Dustin, you know what you have to do.",
        "Dusty: Paul is such a fool.",
        "Rose: I could never love Paul.",
        "James: If she lies to you about Dustin, you know what you have to do.",
        "Dusty: Paul Ryan is such a fool.",
        "[Voices merge and blur]",
        "Paul: Damnit!",
        "Jennifer: Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Chris, but I don't have time to talk right now. I have, like, a million things to do before Rose and Paul's wedding.",
        "Chris: No, Alison, wait. All right, I need to know if you are absolutely positive that this baby isn't mine.",
        "Alison: I told you before it wasn't. There's nothing else to talk about.",
        "Chris: I'm not asking you this because I'm trying to get back into your life, okay? I'm asking you, because the truth is, we both know that we weren't careful 100% of the time. And I know what you said about the timing, but we were together pretty close to the time that you and Aaron were.",
        "Alison: Well, don't you think I can pay attention to what's going on inside my body?",
        "Chris: Yes.",
        "Alison: I can count, Chris. This baby is Aaron's.",
        "Chris: I know you can count, but you could have made a mistake.",
        "Alison: No, I know when I got pregnant. I did not make a mistake.",
        "Chris: Okay, fine, fine. Then you won't have any problem getting a sonogram to confirm that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Please, Mom. I know this can work.",
        "Barbara: Well, honey, you know that there's nothing more in the world that I would love than to see you. You know that, don't you?",
        "Will: Uh, you know the woods near Hallow Lane? Um, if we meet by the gate, you know, nobody would see us, so I was figuring we can meet, because I really wanna talk to you. I miss you so much, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I miss you, too, Will, but -- you know, maybe we can meet a little bit later. I have something I need to attend to.",
        "Will: Later? I can't later. I'm going to Paul's wedding. The only reason I can get away now is 'cause everybody's getting ready. Please, Mom, I really wanna see you.",
        "Barbara: Okay, but, um, I think I can think of a better spot. You know the hill on Valley Road where we had a picnic last summer? I think that's a good spot, because that way, if someone comes along, we can see them before they see us.",
        "Will: The hill overlooking Valley Road? Uh, yeah, sure. Perfect, the hill.",
        "Barbara: Will? You seem a little hesitant. Is something the matter?",
        "Will: No, I was just trying to picture where that is.",
        "Barbara: I see. You know how proud I am of you, don't you?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: And if I thought that you were trying to trick me, I don't think that I could take it.",
        "Will: No, Mom. I would never do that. I wouldn't.",
        "Barbara: No, I'm sure you didn't want to. But I have a feeling that your father is listening in to this conversation. Please, Will. If he is, would you just say yes?",
        "Will: Yes.",
        "Barbara: Well, you are -- you are a wonderful, wonderful son. And I love you so much, and I am so proud of you. And now would you put your father on the phone, please?",
        "Will: She wants to talk to you, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: You see the thing about the wedding -- I was a bundle of nerves at the rehearsal dinner, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, you were. You were a basket case.",
        "Rose: It was because of Mitzi.",
        "Emily: What? Mitzi? What happened? What'd she do?",
        "Rose: Well, let's just say she's not going to be in the wedding. Or at the wedding. We had a big fight.",
        "Emily: Oh, Rose --",
        "Carly: Why didn't you tell us about this yesterday?",
        "Rose: I was hoping it was gonna get better. So, needless to say, everything we're doing at the wedding -- her being a bridesmaid, where she goes, where she stands, all that -- we're gonna have to just play it by ear.",
        "Carly: Um, so that's it? We just have to change the choreography a little bit, but everything else -- everything else is okay?",
        "Rose: Yeah, I hate being alone.",
        "Paul: But you managed. You made it through that long night all by yourself.",
        "Rose: Yeah, all alone in my house, by myself, all night. I hope I did the right thing. I just couldn't hurt him one more time.",
        "Carly: Hurt -- hurt who? Paul?",
        "Emily: Rosie, what are you talking about?",
        "Rose: I got the wedding butterflies. Aren't they great? If I'm gonna be a bride, you better start picking up around here. I got all the stuff to bring to the church. We gotta shake our tail feathers. [Knock on door] oh, that's Lily, I'm sure. Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I -- I didn't know you were here.",
        "Jennifer: Obviously not. Um, is everything okay? That's your -- that's your tux for the wedding, right?",
        "Paul: No. No, the dry cleaner, they sent over the wrong suit, and I don't know now if I got enough time to make it right. And I guess I had a little meltdown.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, that's what it looked like.",
        "Paul: But I'll make some calls, and I'll make everything right. You just let yourself in?",
        "Jennifer: No, I knocked first. I -- guess you didn't hear. I came by to give you this. I decided to come to the wedding, Paul. Unless, of course, that is, you don't want me there, which, in that case, I just wanted to tell you that I love you and that I wish you every happiness.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Jennifer: For today and for the rest of your life. Also, I wanted to tell you that I know I have been very, very hard on Rose, and -- I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: You know, Jennifer, you were only ever honest about your feelings. So I'm not upset at you. The only thing in this world that ticks me off is when people lie to me.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm glad you feel that way, although, looking back on it now, I realize that I never had the right to fight you."
