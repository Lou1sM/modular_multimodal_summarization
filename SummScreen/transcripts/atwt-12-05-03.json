        "Katie: Mike, you ready?",
        "Mike: That depends.",
        "Katie: On what? Oh, I forgot how much fun it is to dress up. It's been so long since I've been dressed up. Did you get your tux?",
        "Mike: Sort of.",
        "Katie: What do you mean? It doesn't fit?",
        "Mike: No, no, it -- it fits.",
        "Katie: So let me see.",
        "Katie: Oh, no.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, how'd it go with Will? Did he reach Barbara?",
        "Hal: Well, you were right. She picked up when she saw his number come up.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's great. Did you figure out where she is?",
        "Hal: No. But she figured out that I was listening in, and she blew sky high, Jack.",
        "Jack: What do you mean by \"sky high\"?",
        "Hal: Well, imagine Barbara at her worst, square it, multiple it times ten -- sky high.",
        "Jack: So we have no idea where she is.",
        "Hal: I know where she's headed.",
        "Jack: The church.",
        "Hal: To do whatever it takes to keep Rose from marrying her son.",
        "Jack: Whatever it takes?",
        "Hal: The way she sounded? I swear, Jack, she'll kill Rose if she has to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Not if I have anything to say about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: Is this what you had in mind, sir?",
        "Paul: Yes, perfect.",
        "[Jennifer remembering]",
        "Jennifer: Paul - I don't know how to say this. Is something - you don't -- you don't seem happy. Did something happen that I don't know about?",
        "Paul: Like what?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Something with Rose. Is she -- is she okay?",
        "Paul: Oh, Rose is great.",
        "Jennifer: So, and the wedding is gonna be okay?",
        "Paul: Oh, not just okay. The wedding is going to be everything that Rose deserves.",
        "Jennifer: He's upset about something -- something to do with Rose. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You can't be serious.",
        "Rose: Yep. I'm marrying Paul. We're moving to Paris right after the reception. So I guess this is good-bye.",
        "Dusty: The guy threatened your life.",
        "Rose: He admitted that. He made a huge mistake.",
        "Dusty: A mistake?!",
        "Rose: It doesn't matter. It doesn't.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, bashing up your car, leaving death threats doesn't matter?",
        "Rose: Paul had nothing to do with that.",
        "Dusty: Just like he had nothing to do with that phone call, which you already admitted that he made? Listen to yourself. Rose -- this is a dangerous guy.",
        "Rose: That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. Now if you'll excuse me, I really need to get ready.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Rose: Please, don't make this any harder than it already is. I can't see you anymore. You're just gonna have to accept that.",
        "Dusty: What if I say no?",
        "Rose: It won't change anything.",
        "Dusty: You sure about that? 'Cause I don't think Paul would appreciate finding out that his fianc\u00e9e spent the night with another man.",
        "Rose: You wouldn't.",
        "Dusty: Watch me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Jennifer: So where did you go?",
        "Paul: I told you -- my tuxedo.",
        "Jennifer: Right, well, this -- this is your tuxedo.",
        "Paul: Which I realized as soon as I got to the dry-cleaners, so I did a little shopping.",
        "Jennifer: You went shopping on your wedding day?",
        "Paul: Jen, I'm the groom. Really, what do I need to do, shower, shave?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, so, what'd you buy?",
        "Paul: Well, something for my bride. Speaking of prep time -- shouldn't you be getting ready?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, Paul, I don't mean to pry. I really don't. But you were kind of upset earlier, and --",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's nerves, that's all. It's nerves. I mean, come on, you women, you get to occupy your minds with -- through waxing and buffing and everything, and us boys -- what am I gonna do? I go to war with my wardrobe. Really, no pair of shoes is ever truly safe.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Yeah, well, the thing about your sense of humor is that it tends to come out when you are avoiding what's really going on. Paul, I know you're angry about something. Paul? Hey, what -- what just happened?",
        "Paul: My worst nightmare came true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Nothing happened last night.",
        "Dusty: I don't think Paul would agree.",
        "Rose: We fell asleep. That's it.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I held you in my arms all night. We talked.",
        "Rose: Yeah, we talked, because I needed somebody to listen to me. Oh, so it is a competition. I was talking about that last night.",
        "Dusty: What are you -- are you quoting Lily now? If you are, at least get it right.",
        "Rose: You just pretended to care about me, because you -- 'cause I -- I'm confused.",
        "Dusty: Confused? You're planning to marry a guy who threatened to kill you.",
        "Rose: Paul had nothing to do with what happened with my car.",
        "Dusty: You sure about that? Maybe you're just confused.",
        "Rose: What's going on here? Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause I don't want you to marry a freak who's gonna drag you off to France, of all places, where you have no family. You got no friends there. You got no one to protect you. I'm not gonna let it happen. You understand? I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What's he saying to her?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I can't hear anything right now.",
        "Carly: What if they're kissing?",
        "Emily: No. No kissing. They're standing really close, though.",
        "Carly: Oh, this is the last thing that Rose needs. You know, we should be there right now, at the church, putting that veil on her head.",
        "Emily: Would you be quiet? There's nothing we can do about it. If she wants to talk to him, she's gonna talk to him.",
        "Carly: I don't think she does want to talk to him. I think she's just afraid that he's gonna do something to wreck the wedding.",
        "Emily: What are you doing? Carly, who are you calling?",
        "Carly: I'm calling the cavalry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you really think that Barbara's at the point where she would actually kill Rose?",
        "Hal: It's a definite possibility.",
        "Jack: Well, what are we gonna do?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Hal: I don't know.",
        "Jack: It's Carly. Hey, babe.",
        "Carly: Jack, I need you to get over here.",
        "Jack: I know, we're running a little bit late. We should really be at the church.",
        "Hal: 15, 20 minutes tops.",
        "Carly: We're still at Rose's.",
        "Jack: You're not at the church?",
        "Carly: Dusty showed up. He's got Rose out on the porch. It's a mess.",
        "Jack: I'll be right over there. Dusty's over at Rose's causing trouble.",
        "Hal: This wedding is cursed.",
        "Jack: I gotta go put Donovan on a leash. What do you want to do about Barbara?",
        "Hal: Oh, I'll handle Barbara, Jack.",
        "Jack: Keep me posted.",
        "Hal: Talk to you later. Lieutenant Munson. Did you search the church?",
        "Cop #1: Yeah, we checked the perimeter. We're gonna go into the church.",
        "Hal: I want a thorough search. Do you understand what I'm saying? From the basement to the bell tower. I don't want my ex-wife anywhere in the vicinity. Is that understood? And no mistakes.",
        "Cop #2: If I had a wife like that --",
        "Cop #1: Ex-wife.",
        "Cop #2: Worse. Who's there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: So if you can't have me, nobody can?",
        "Dusty: Come on, it's not about that.",
        "Rose: That's exactly what it sounds like.",
        "Dusty: Do I wish things were different between us? You know I do. I'm not doing this because I'm angry or jealous. I'm afraid for you. This guy, he's out of control. You know this.",
        "Rose: You don't know him the way that I do. He's a very complicated guy. I mean, look at those parents. He grew up not trusting anybody.",
        "Dusty: He trusts you, right?",
        "Rose: Now, yeah, he does.",
        "Dusty: So you told him about last night? About how I stayed here with you on the couch all night?",
        "Rose: No, I didn't tell him about that.",
        "Dusty: Doesn't that tell you something?",
        "Rose: I didn't want to shake things up, you know, stirring the pot. I'll tell him when I get to Paris.",
        "Dusty: What if he goes nuts on you over in Paris? Who you gonna turn to? You don't even speak the language. This is not a good move. You hear me? I'm gonna go talk to Paul now.",
        "Rose: You're not gonna -- even if you tell him about last night, it doesn't matter. He's still gonna marry me, just to get me away from you.",
        "Dusty: Oh, and that's okay with you?",
        "Rose: Or even if you do tell him, it doesn't matter, you know? Because I know that man, and I know how wonderful he is. And I know he will forgive me. So that means we'll either get married today or the next day or next week. Don't you get it? It's over. It's done.",
        "Dusty: Why are you doing this? Why? Why are doing this? Why would you take such a big risk? You're smarter than this. I know you are.",
        "Rose: You gotta stop -- you gotta stop doing this.",
        "Dusty: I'm not going to. You know why? Because I love you, and that's not gonna change. I love you. And I care about you.",
        "Lily: Hey, get your hands off my sister.",
        "Dusty: Lily, please, not now.",
        "Emily: Dusty, you need to leave right now.",
        "Carly: Rose has to get ready.",
        "Dusty: We're not done yet.",
        "Emily: Rose, say good-bye to the man.",
        "Rose: I been trying to do that. He won't take no for an answer.",
        "Lily: There's a name for people like that.",
        "Dusty: Yeah? You got a name for a woman who has no idea what's going on right now?",
        "Rose: Don't you talk to my sister like that.",
        "Carly: Don't make things worse, okay?",
        "Dusty: Listen, do me a favor. You gotta stay out of this, would ya?",
        "Rose: Don't touch her like that.",
        "Dusty: Don't you understand? I'm the only one protecting you here. It is you and me.",
        "Rose: No, no, there is no you and me. Don't you see that?",
        "Dusty: No? Prove it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I am so glad I wasn't alive when this was in style. Who would wear this? Look at all of these ruffles. It's disgusting.",
        "Mike: It's for some '70s revival someplace.",
        "Katie: I hope. So what? The rental place --",
        "Mike: Put the wrong tux in the wrong bag. I should've checked that before I left the store.",
        "Katie: Well, why don't you just call them?",
        "Mike: I did. They got a call in to the guy who's got my tux, they just haven't heard from him yet.",
        "Katie: Do you blame him? Well, we have time. We'll just go by the rental place and get you a new tux.",
        "Mike: I tried that. They don't have anything in my size.",
        "Katie: What about a different store? The one on Spring Street?",
        "Mike: I've tried every shop in town. I even called Bay City. There's not a tux anywhere. There's some winter carnival at the university and they got a hospital benefit over in Bay City. You know, and every guy -- you know, our wedding where every guy there's gonna be in a tux.",
        "Katie: What about the hospital benefit? You were wearing, like, a really nice black suit. You could wear that.",
        "Mike: It's at the cleaners. All I've got left are these slacks and a sport coat. Katie, I'm really sorry.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. Don't be sorry. It doesn't matter what you wear.",
        "Mike: Says the woman in the classiest gown I ever saw. You look so beautiful.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Mike: I'm gonna grab a tie. It's probably in my sport coat or something.",
        "Katie: Oh, you know what? I just remembered that I forgot to feed Snickers. I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: We'll stop at your place on the way.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. You just look for your tie. I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: Katie. Katie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Now, go on. Get outta here.",
        "Jack: Is there a problem?",
        "Carly: Dusty was just leaving.",
        "Jack: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Not today. I don't need an escort.",
        "Jack: You okay, Rose?",
        "Rose: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'm gonna make sure he gets to his car. I don't want him to double back. I will see you ladies at the church.",
        "Carly: We'll be there.",
        "Emily: Oh, honey, you're shaking like a leaf.",
        "Rose: He just makes me so mad. I mean, what gives him the right? I chose to marry Paul, and that's it. It's over.",
        "Lily: If you're okay, Rose, can I meet you at the church?",
        "Rose: If you're gonna go after Dusty, just don't bother.",
        "Carly: Jack'll take care of him.",
        "Lily: Jack has enough to worry about. I just wanna talk to him.",
        "Rose: Would you ladies excuse me for a minute? I need to talk to my sister alone. All right, but not too long.",
        "Emily: We've gotta be at the church, you know -- okay.",
        "Rose: If you're gonna talk to Dusty, there's something that you need to know.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Rose: He's threatening to go to Paul and tell him about what happened last night.",
        "Lily: Nothing happened last night.",
        "Rose: Oh, I know nothing happened. But you know Paul. I mean, in the long run, it's not gonna matter to him. But what if in the short run he freaks out?",
        "Lily: Don't worry. I won't let Dusty ruin this for you. Go on. Go get ready.",
        "Rose: I guess I should try to do something with this face.",
        "Lily: Hey. That's the same face you're talking about, here. Now go on. Don't forget, this is supposed to be fun.",
        "Rose: Fun.",
        "Emily: Hey, honey, did Paul re-string those pearls of yours?",
        "Rose: Oh, no. He didn't have time. I gotta try the dress on one more time, right?",
        "Carly: No, sweetie, the dress is perfect. You're gonna be perfect. What you need to do is take a deep breath and center yourself.",
        "Emily: Or how about a nice glass of wine? You know, keep your feet up for ten minutes?",
        "Rose: Oh, I would love to do that, but if I do that, I'm gonna be late for my own wedding. And I'm telling you right now, nobody, not even Dusty Donovan, is gonna stop me from marrying Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #1: Who's there?",
        "Cop #2: Sorry, sister. We didn't mean to disturb you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here comes the bride. All dressed in --",
        "Barbara: Too bad she died.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. You're stalling. Tell me what's going on with you and rose.",
        "Paul: It isn't Rose.",
        "Jennifer: Then what is it?",
        "Paul: Okay, if I tell you, you have to swear to me that you're not gonna mention it to anyone.",
        "Jennifer: Which, that means Mom. Okay, fine, I won't.",
        "Paul: No, that means anyone.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, you're scaring me. Okay, yes, fine, I won't tell anyone what you still haven't told me.",
        "Paul: I went to see James.",
        "Jennifer: In prison? Why?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. I guess because I know I'm leaving after the wedding, I wanted to make some kind of peace with the guy.",
        "Jennifer: Well, James Steinbeck is not the kind of man that anyone makes peace with.",
        "Paul: I know that, believe me. I've spent my whole life -- all I've ever wanted was peace. You know, all I've ever really wanted was to be happy and normal, successful.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, but you have that now.",
        "Paul: I don't know. Jennifer, I haven't worked in months. You know, I live off of money I made a long time ago. I spend most of my time trying to avoid my family.",
        "Jennifer: But you're getting married and moving to Paris.",
        "Paul: Which is a successful ending to a story that began in failure. I wanted to gloat. But James has this way of making everything that I do seem somehow wrong.",
        "Jennifer: You can't listen to him.",
        "Paul: But he's always there. The guy's always in my head. That's why I went to see him in person. 'Cause I wanted to shove it in his face, you know, my beautiful new life. And he made me feel worthless.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, hey.",
        "Paul: What would I do without you?",
        "Jennifer: Well, you're never gonna have to find that out. But there's something else. There's something wrong. You said something about the wedding. Paul, what you said about Rose getting the wedding she deserves -- what's that mean? I can understand you being angry at James, but why are you angry at Rose?",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "James: You call off this wedding and everybody will want to comfort Rose. And you and I know where she's going to find the most comfort -- right in Dustin's bed. You know the truth, Paul. You've seen it for yourself. Now, do what you have to do. And calling off the wedding isn't it.",
        "Paul: James, for whatever reason, has decided to team up against Barbara. And they want revenge against Rose, for whatever crimes she may have committed.",
        "Jennifer: Being a cocktail waitress and owning a beauty parlor?",
        "Paul: She was the vice-president of Worldwide, but that's not what matters. The reason they're really upset is because I'm living my life the way I really want to -- with no regrets. And I will, I'm gonna move to Paris and start all over again.",
        "Jennifer: You and Rose.",
        "Paul: You know what they say. Living well is the best revenge. And I will have lots of revenge.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I know I haven't been exceptionally supportive of this wedding, but if it makes you happy --",
        "Paul: Oh, I am happy. I am. And I'm running a little late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Would you look at this church? Those flowers are gorgeous. The wedding's gonna be perfect. Yeah.",
        "Carly: So you're feeling a little better?",
        "Rose: Ha! I'm getting married today, honey, I feel great.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, can you feel great and get dressed at the same time? Because otherwise, you're gonna be getting married in that.",
        "Rose: I'm the bride. Can't start without me. Let's go.",
        "Carly: Here comes the bride. All dressed in --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Too bad she died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: There's a bathroom down the hallway.",
        "Lucinda: A bathroom with minimal amenities.",
        "Rose: Oh, ms. Walsh. What're you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: My darling, I'm waiting. Waiting, waiting for you. I was beginning to think that this wedding wasn't going to happen.",
        "Rose: Oh, bite your tongue. This wedding is going off without a hitch. Right, ladies?",
        "Carly: Yeah, oh sure. Whatever the bride says.",
        "Rose: I'm glad you're here, because I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Lucinda: I came early.",
        "Rose: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: So, we have only two attendants?",
        "Rose: Three. Lily is the matron of honor.",
        "Lucinda: Then it's true that Mitzi is out of the wedding.",
        "Rose: I don't know where you got your information, but Mitzi is out. Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, well, I got it from Mitzi herself.",
        "Rose: What?",
        "Lucinda: I mean, she tracked me down yesterday. She got 500 smackers off of me so she could go to Atlantic City to see a sick friend.",
        "Rose: What?",
        "Lucinda: I gave her the money 'cause she said it was all right with you. I'm sorry. She seemed rather upset.",
        "Rose: Yeah. Yeah, I'll bet she was. Yeah, it's a long story. Let's just say she's not the person I thought she was.",
        "Lucinda: Ooh, well, then I'm sorry I gave her the money.",
        "Rose: No, give her the money. Good riddance to her. That means she won't be here to wreck my wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: Rose? Now's my chance to stop you from sending me to prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, where are you? I couldn't find a tie, but I look halfway presentable. So call me, we're gonna be late.",
        "Katie: No, we aren't.",
        "Mike: What happened?",
        "Katie: You think I'm gonna let you be the only one who's comfortable? Forget that.",
        "Mike: But you looked so good. Not that you don't look good now. You do. You know you do.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, you'll just have to owe me. Sometime in the not too distant future, you'll rent a tux, I'll wear my gown, we'll go somewhere really fancy.",
        "Mike: But you talked about how much you loved dressing up. And that you would go home and change just for me? So I wouldn't look like such an idiot.",
        "Katie: You don't look like an idiot --",
        "Mike: I would've felt pretty stupid having all those people staring at me.",

        "Mike: I wasn't gonna spoil your evening.",
        "Katie: Exactly. 'Cause you -- Mr. Coat and no tie -- are a gentleman. Besides, if a lamb can show up at the church in nothing but her woollies, then we're fine.",
        "Mike: About that lamb --",
        "Katie: I know. Can you believe it? I asked for a sign and I actually got it. It just made me feel like everything was gonna be okay. That I could love Simon and still say good-bye to him. And hello to -- whatever life has in store.",
        "Mike: That's great. I just don't -- I don't want you to feel rushed or under any obligation.",
        "Katie: What I feel is good. For the first time since Simon left -- I actually feel like I'm ready for the rest of my life now. And, although I don't know for sure what's gonna happen with us, at the very least, we're best friends. And if I can't dress down for my best friend, then why would you wanna be with me anyway?",
        "Mike: Still one problem.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: Even without your hair all done up and that beautiful dress, there is no way I'm gonna be able to take my eyes off you.",
        "Katie: Better not let the bride hear you say that.",

        "Dusty: For what? Warning her about her psycho fianc\u00e9 who threatened her life? What're you doing about that, by the way? 'Cause the last I checked, it's illegal to threaten a girl's life. Am I right?",
