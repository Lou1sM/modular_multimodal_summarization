        "Emily: Carly --",
        "Carly: Would you come here for a minute?",
        "Emily: What's the matter?",
        "Carly: Were those papers all over the floor when we left here?",
        "Emily: Oh, no. Not like I -- I don't remember that.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Was the -- was the back window in the bedroom open?",
        "Carly: No. No, not in this weather. Of course not.",

        "Holden: You know, I'm glad that you changed your mind and decided to come. It's gonna mean a lot to Rose.",
        "Aaron: Well, I mostly did it for Lucy. I ran into her at Al's today. God, Holden, I miss her so much. And call me crazy, but I think she misses me, too. And I'm starting to believe that we can probably get back together.",
        "Holden: What about Alison and the baby?",
        "Aaron: Look, I told you, I'm not running away from that.",
        "Holden: Have you managed to save any money?",
        "Aaron: Not much.",
        "Holden: Well, if you need any, if you need to borrow any, you just let me know.",
        "Aaron: Thank you. But Alison and I -- we've got everything covered.",
        "Holden: You know, you have no idea what it's like to have a baby. You cannot prepare for this. This is gonna completely change your whole life.",
        "Aaron: Are you trying to scare me, Holden?",
        "Holden: No, I just want you to be realistic. And if you're not gonna take any money from me, then maybe you should think about asking Dusty for some overtime work at Metro.",
        "Aaron: Look, I know you're trying to help. Okay, but just for tonight, wait till I ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You're gonna freeze in this dress. I don't know why you never listen to me.",
        "Alison: Because I'm 18 and not 8.",
        "Susan: Fine. But catching a cold while you're pregnant is not going to be fun.",
        "Aaron: How are you feeling? Is everything okay?",
        "Alison: Not too bad, except my mother is driving me crazy.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah, I know that feeling. My dad's doing the same thing.",

        "[Dusty remembering]",
        "Lily: You show up at that church, I will personally escort you out.",
        "Dusty: You try and stop me, and I'm gonna make such a great scene in front of the entire congregation that nobody's gonna go home happy.",
        "Lily: You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't dare.",
        "Dusty: You know me better.",
        "Dusty: What, did you come by to show me what I'm missing?",
        "Molly: I'm going to Paul's wedding. I just thought I'd check in here first.",
        "Dusty: I know why I'm gonna be there. What's your excuse?",
        "Molly: Well, it's not to catch the bouquet. That much I can tell you.",
        "Dusty: Then why?",
        "Molly: Because tonight, everything comes to an end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imaginary James: It's a pity I can't be with you tonight, Paul.",
        "Paul: No, it's good. I don't need you confusing me.",
        "Imaginary James: No, no, look, look. Perhaps -- perhaps I can help. You tell me what you've got planned for Rose, and I'll give you odds whether or not it will succeed.",
        "Paul: I'm marrying her.",
        "Imaginary James: No. Come on, no games with me. I know you. You're not gonna allow this white-trash showgirl to make a fool of you again. Now, let's pool our resources and make sure that this gets done right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: It's gonna be okay. Yeah. You're gonna marry Paul. You're gonna move to Paris. And you're gonna have a brand-new life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You're going to commit murder now? In a church? What in the name of God have you become, Barbara",
        "Barbara: Leave me alone, all right? I have not committed any crime.",
        "Hal: You were about to shoot Rose D'Angelo.",
        "Barbara: Do you actually think I could kill another human being, Hal?",
        "Hal: You were in disguise, Barbara, and you had a pistol in your hand.",
        "Barbara: I wore that because --",
        "Hal: Can I hear another explanation?",
        "Barbara: -- I was trying to get into the building. I did not receive an invitation to this wedding, if you remember.",
        "Hal: And the gun?",
        "Barbara: I was trying to scare her into canceling the wedding. I thought maybe that and a little money might do the trick.",
        "Hal: What if it had gone off accidentally, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: It's not loaded.",
        "Hal: Do you think that makes a difference?",
        "Barbara: I am trying to help my son.",
        "Hal: Why don't you try accepting his choice of a wife, even thought she's not your favorite person?",
        "Barbara: I can't do that. She's beneath him in every way.",
        "Hal: You know, I could throw you in jail for what you've done tonight.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Go right ahead! Go right ahead, Hal! I've nothing left to lose! My children despise me. My friends have all abandoned me. I make one desperate mistake after another. You know what? Lock me, okay, Hal?",
        "Hal: Come with me. I want you out of here before anybody else sees you.",
        "Barbara: And where do you think you're taking me?",
        "Hal: It's been awhile, Barbara. But I think it's about time that you and I had a little heart to heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: It's all gonna come to an end? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Molly: Once Paul and Rose get married, they're moving to Paris. So it'll mark the end of their time in Oakdale. And I for one want to see that.",
        "Dusty: Well, how do you know she's gonna marry him?",
        "Molly: Do you have some reason why they wouldn't get married?",
        "Dusty: Well, I might.",
        "Molly: Like that maybe because you spent the night at Rose's place last night?",
        "Dusty: How'd you know that?",
        "Molly: I do the news. I can smell out a good story.",
        "Dusty: Well, I guess you're gonna love this one then. Because tonight, before they tie the knot, I'm gonna stand up in church and I'm gonna tell Paul that Rose was with me last night. And he's gonna call off the wedding like that.",
        "Molly: It won't work.",
        "Dusty: No? Why not?",
        "Molly: Because, Dusty, they're not gonna let you in the door. And even if you do get in the door, they're gonna drag you out of there before you can open your mouth.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Well, I gotta try. It's my last shot.",
        "Molly: Fine. Do whatever you want. Rose and Paul will find a way back to each other because that's what they do. Till death do them part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Hi. What happened? Did you find Dusty?",
        "Lily: He was at Metro. I asked him not to tell Paul that he spent the night with you. But he insisted that he's gonna do it.",
        "Rose: How could I have been so stupid?",
        "Lily: Don't you dare blame yourself. You had no idea that Dusty would react this way.",
        "Rose: I can't let this happen. I mean, not when I'm so close to getting everything that I wanted.",
        "Lily: What are you looking for?",
        "Rose: I'm gonna -- I'm gonna call Dusty myself and tell him to back off.",
        "Lily: No, that's not a good idea.",
        "Rose: Why?",
        "Lily: He'll say nasty things to you. It's just -- believe me, it's not good for anybody.",
        "Rose: My pop's got a friend in Jersey. I could make sure -- I make a little phone call, make sure Dusty forgets everything he knows.",
        "Lily: Rose, stop. Okay, this is your day. I will not let you spend it this way.",
        "Rose: If I don't do something quick, it's not gonna be my day much longer.",
        "Lily: That's not true. You and Paul are gonna get married, move to Paris and have a beautiful, beautiful life together. And nothing's gonna get in the way of that. I won't let it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imaginary James: Did Rose tell you that she spent the night with Dusty?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Imaginary James: No?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Imaginary James: Oh, she lied? Little Rose lied about hopping into bed with your most hated enemy?",
        "Paul: Shut up. Imaginary James: And you were so sure that she was going to be totally honest with you. And you gave her every opportunity, right?",
        "Paul: Yes!",
        "Imaginary James: Good. Well, you've been betrayed by your betrothed and she must be punished. You let Rose get away with this, and you can say good-bye to your self-respect forever. Now she hurt you. You hurt her back and worse. Then you can call yourself a man, okay? Don't let me down, Paul. You've got one opportunity to get this right. Now do it.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Paul: Hey!",
        "Jack: Hey, buddy boy. Nice suit.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Jack: Are you ready to walk the plank?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Hello. Oh, isn't this wonderful? It's so beautiful. I couldn't be happier for Rose and Paul.",
        "Aaron: Oh, me neither. You two, you look good.",
        "Luke: Do you know how long this is going to take?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. What did they say? 20 hours, I think.",
        "Luke: Real funny.",
        "Aaron: Come on.",
        "Alison: First time being a flower girl? Well, you could've fooled me. You look like you've been doing it your whole life.",
        "Emma: Is Lucy here yet?",
        "Aaron: No, not yet.",
        "Emma: Well, let me know if there are any developments, okay?",
        "Aaron: Of course.",
        "Emma: All right. Okay. You two, let's go be sociable. Here we go.",
        "Alison: Developments? What does that mean?",
        "Aaron: Oh, I told my grandma that I might still have a shot with Lucy. She's just wishing me some luck.",
        "Alison: Emma knows best. Isn't that the town motto?",
        "Aaron: Hey, you have nothing to worry about, okay? 'Cause even if Lucy and I, you know, were to get back together, I'm still taking care of our baby.",
        "Alison: I'm sure Lucy will love that.",
        "Aaron: She's gonna have to accept that. All right? Being a father means a lot to me, Ali. And I don't know if it's because I didn't grow up with Holden or, you know, whatever it may be, but this child is mine. And I'm gonna give it all I got.",
        "Kim: Well, hello. Hello, you two.",
        "Bob: Ready for the big event?",
        "Aaron: Oh, can't wait.",
        "Alison: Me, neither. Hello, Chris. You look nice.",
        "Chris: Same here.",
        "Nancy: Aaron, I understand from Emma that your little sister is going to be one of the flower girls. That I'd like to see a preview.",
        "Aaron: She's right inside.",
        "Bob: Come on, Mom, we'll get you a good seat right on the aisle.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'll be there in just a minute. I'm gonna go see if my sister needs anything. I think she's helping Rose get ready.",
        "Chris: Alison -- I wanted to tell you I scheduled a sonogram for 10:00 tomorrow morning.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sorry, but I can't make it.",
        "Chris: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because what's going on inside my body is none of your business.",
        "Chris: It is if the child is mine.",
        "Alison: I already told you, Chris.",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, I know what you already told me. Okay, you told me that the baby was Aaron's. But maybe the sonogram can help us be more specific about the date of conception.",
        "Alison: I thought you wanted me completely out of your life.",
        "Chris: This isn't about us anymore. I'll see you tomorrow morning, 10:00. Don't be late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I don't know why you've dragged me all the way over here. We could've had this conversation at the church, Hal.",
        "Hal: Because this is my turf. And I want to make a deal with you. I think it'll help us both and, in the long run, our extended family.",
        "Barbara: Really?",
        "Hal: Mm-hmm.",
        "Barbara: And what is this deal?",
        "Hal: I'm thinking about lifting the restraining order and allowing you to see Will.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God. Are you serious?",
        "Hal: Providing you check yourself into a psychiatric hospital for 30 days and have yourself evaluated.",
        "Barbara: That is the most ridiculous and insulting suggestion I have ever heard.",
        "Hal: And if you want to see Will, you'll do exactly as I say. Not negotiable. Take it or leave it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Does it look like anything's missing? Look around.",
        "Carly: I don't know if anything's missing. I mean, it doesn't look like anything's missing. Unless something was taken from the desk.",
        "Emily: Molly. All right, I know she's your cousin. But maybe I interrupted Molly the first time, and she came back to finish the job. I don't know. Smell. Do you smell that perfume in here? It's here, and it's in that -- by that back window. It's not Rose's perfume.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't. But that doesn't mean that it's Molly's perfume either.",
        "Emily: Well, we both know that molly's very angry with rose. Okay. Maybe she came back to -- oh, I don't know. And we can't talk about this now. We gotta get to the church or Rose is gonna be getting married in her stocking feet.",
        "Carly: Hey?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Carly: Do you think that we should tell Rose about the break-in?",
        "Emily: After the wedding, right? Because if somebody really is after Rose, nothing's gonna happen until after the wedding. Right? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just talked to Rose. She is scared to death that Dusty is going to do something at this wedding.",
        "Holden: Are you sure that Dusty's coming?",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. I talked to him. He's determined to show up.",
        "Holden: Well, if he shows up, I'll just have jack toss him out.",
        "Lily: Jack went to get Paul. What if Dusty shows up first?",
        "Holden: Well, he just did.",
        "Lily: I --",
        "Holden: Hey, Dusty. How are you doing? Can I talk to you outside?",
        "Dusty: I'm here early because I want to get a good seat.",
        "Holden: Listen, it's about Aaron. He's a little confused about his job. And I just want to talk to you about it.",
        "Dusty: Make it quick.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Lily: Molly, I don't know what you're doing here, but I hope it's not to cause trouble.",
        "Molly: It's nice to see you, too, Lily. I do love the dress.",
        "Lily: Where are you going?",
        "Molly: Ah, I'm going to the ladies' room. I didn't know I needed your permission.",

        "[Jennifer clears her throat]",
        "Jennifer: Will? Hey, buddy, I know you're sad because Paul is moving away. And you have every right to feel sad. I'm gonna miss him myself. But if you think about it, there's a lot of good things happening, too.",
        "Will: Like what?",
        "Jennifer: Well, someone you love has found the person that he wants to live with for the rest of his life. And that's a pretty big deal in this world, Will. And it would be nice to be happy for him.",
        "Will: I guess.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. I will not bug you about it anymore. Hey, where's your cummerbund thingy?",
        "Will: I left it at home by mistake.",
        "Jennifer: Do you want me to go get it for you?",
        "Will: Would you?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, if you promise to smile at least once during this wedding. That does not count. Hey, you still owe me one, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Okay. I don't want you to be surprised, so I'm just going to tell you now that Molly and Dusty are here.",
        "Rose: What am I gonna do?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Holden is watching them. Jack will be here soon. Nothing is going to interfere with this wedding. Trust me. Just put that thought right out of your head.",
        "Rose: I've been trying. But I have this awful feeling that everything is just gonna come crashing down.",
        "Lily: No, no, you're wrong. Okay, this wedding is gonna happen because it's meant to happen.",
        "Rose: I used to think that.",
        "Lily: Until last night.",
        "Rose: The man that I love disguised his voice and made a threatening phone call to me. What if Dusty's right and I should just run? Run while you've got the chance?",
        "Lily: Rose, we've been over this already a number of times. Paul admitted that he made a mistake. He loves you. And that love is gonna last.",
        "Rose: Then why am I so scared? About Dusty and Paul -- this isn't like me. You know that. I mean, I just can't stop shaking.",
        "Lily: Remember when we were trapped in that well? You kept telling me to have faith? A few hours ago, you decided to go through with this wedding for two reasons -- you love Paul and he loves you. Just keep the faith, Rose. Don't second guess yourself.",
        "Paul: You like champagne, Jack?",
        "Jack: Anything with a cork in it is usually fine by me. This something special?",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. But then, again, an occasion like tonight calls for something extraordinary.",
        "Jack: Whatever turns you on. You ready to go?",
        "Paul: Yeah, Jack. I have never been more ready for anything in my entire life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Is Rose gonna go through with this? And my money says no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Does anyone here know of any reason why this couple should not be married at this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: All right. I will commit myself for 30 days. But I will only do it so I can see Will.",
        "Hal: Listen, it's going to be okay.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, I thought you were at the church.",
        "Hal: Your mother and I had some things we needed to work out. And you?",
        "Jennifer: Will left his cummerbund. I came by to get it.",
        "Barbara: Oh, it's right here. I wish I could see him. He must look so handsome in his tux.",
        "Jennifer: He does. He does. I'll see you back there.",
        "Barbara: Honey, could you just stay for a minute? I've got a question I want to ask you.",
        "Hal: I'll get out of your way. I don't want you anywhere near that wedding today, Barbara. Is that understood?",
        "Barbara: You've made yourself perfectly clear, Hal.",
        "Jennifer: Let's make this quick, Mom. Will's in the wedding party, and I have to get back to him.",
        "Barbara: I know, I know. I just -- I'm just so curious about Paul. Is he at peace with all of this? Is he happy?",
        "Jennifer: Well, he's a little nervous, I think, but he's fine. I was even talking to him earlier, and he was showing me these gifts he got for the bridesmaids and for Rose.",
        "Barbara: Gifts? Really? What kind of gifts?",
        "Jennifer: Some expensive champagne and a fancy goblet for Rose. Why?",
        "Barbara: Your brother is merely going through the motions, Jen. Because I know deep down in his heart, when it comes down to the wire, he will refuse to marry that woman.",
        "Jennifer: Mother, Paul is marrying Rose today. You can be happy for him or not, that's up to you. But they're getting married. And there is nothing that you can do about it.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you're wrong, Jennifer. There's always something.",

        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Rose: Hi.",
        "Carly: Shoe delivery! I believe you ordered the size sevens?",
        "Rose: Thank you. Thank you so much. You didn't forget. What took you guys so long?",
        "Emily: Well, there was an accident on route nine and everything was backed up. But everything's okay now.",
        "Rose: Okay. All I need is the ring.",
        "Carly: We forgot about that.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Rose: Oh, that's okay. It doesn't matter.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Rose: It's fine.",
        "Emily: Of course it matter. It most certainly matters. Something old, something new is an important part of getting married. And we're not gonna leave it out. Right?",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Rose: You don't got the stuff.",
        "Lily: Then we'll improvise. Something old.",
        "Rose: Oh.",
        "Lily: Here.",
        "Rose: I know this bracelet. It's -- it's one of your favorites.",
        "Lily: I hope it'll be one of your favorites now.",
        "Emily: Okay. I got it. Hang on. Something new. I just bought yesterday. Here you go.",
        "Rose: Parsley? It's green? Oh, they'll love me in Paris.",

        "Emily: You carry a lucky -- you carry around a lucky penny, Carly?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yeah, my son gave it to me. I promised him I'd keep it.",
        "Rose: You can't let this go.",
        "Carly: Well, you can give it back to me after the wedding. Right now, I want you to have all the luck.",

        "Aaron: Yeah. Well, I was just wondering -- maybe we can sit together?",
        "Lucy: Actually, I have a date. Things are different now, Aaron. I think we should just accept that. You remember Clark, right? You met at the Halloween party.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Clark: The mechanic, right? How you doing? Should we get a seat?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'll see you later.",

        "Dusty: Well, I'll give him a raise when he deserves one. Can I go inside now?",
        "Holden: How about some overtime? You know, he could -- he could really use it. Hey, look who's here. It's the groom and his police escort.",

        "Dusty: Oh, okay. Next time I'll let your kid go to jail! Boy, some people -- some people don't know how to be grateful around here! Anyway --",

        "Lily: To Paul.",
        "Carly: Mm. Yeah. While we're toasting that groom -- here's to Paul's fantastic taste in champagne.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'll drink to that, sister.",

        "Hal: Yeah, well, Barbara showed up, too. I barely got her out of here before she did something really stupid.",
        "Jack: Where is she now?",
        "Hal: She's at my place with Jennifer. She gave me her word she wouldn't come back here, which is why I brought Wilson. Under no circumstances is Ms. Ryan to go back into that church. Do I have to say that again?",

        "Katie: Well, is this about Aaron? Are you trying to hold on to him or something?",
        "Alison: No, Aaron still wants Lucy. He thinks that there's still a chance they could get back together.",
        "Katie: So you need to let him go. What you're doing is not fair to anyone.",
        "Alison: Yes, I know. I'm a terrible person. But I don't want Chris to be with me just because of the baby.",
        "Katie: Well, for all you know, he might feel the same way. But you're gonna find out the truth unless you tell him.",
        "Alison: You know, I can't deal with this right now. Nothing seems right.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I guess if I was Lucy's friend, I'd tell her she'd be better off without me. I mean, I got busted by the cops, slept with somebody else. Now I'm gonna be a dad. I mean, why should she stick with me?",
        "Alison: Because she still loves you?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, even if that's true, it's not enough. I mean, one way or another, I kept letting her down. You know? She -- she doesn't feel like she can trust me anymore. Nobody does.",
        "Alison: I do. You've been amazing about the baby.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, tell that to my dad. You know, I keep telling him that I'm gonna be right by my kid's side. He's just waiting for me to flake.",
        "Alison: Well, it's the same with me. My mom keeps treating me like I'm 12.",
        "Aaron: Alison, something's got to be done about this. I mean, I can't have everybody on our backs for the next eight months.",

        "Barbara: Yes, yes, of course, I understand. Officer, do you have children?",
        "Cop: A little girl, 4 1/2.",
        "Barbara: Oh. I bet she looks just like her daddy. Do you mind if I give you a little advice? Treasure every moment. Because one day, you'll wake up, and she'll be gone. And then no matter how hard you try, she'll never listen to you again.",
        "Cop: I'll try to remember that, ma'am.",
        "Barbara: Good. Good night. You know, it's my son who's getting married tonight. And I wouldn't ask you to let me sit with everyone else. I was just wondering if I might be able to stand inside and watch. Really -- really, I promise I won't go in. You won't be disobeying your orders. My youngest son is the best man. I just want to get a glimpse of him in his tux.",
        "Cop: I -- I guess it's okay.",

        "Lucinda: I do.",
        "Minister: We are gathered here together today to join this couple in holy matrimony. As we all know, marriage is a sacred and joyous union and one that is not to be taken lightly. So before we begin, does anyone here know of any reason why this couple should not be married at this time?",
