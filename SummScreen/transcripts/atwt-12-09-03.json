        "Lucinda: Do you think that this is some sort of allergic reaction to something?",
        "Walker: If it isn't, the strongest possibly is that Rose may have ingested some kind of poison.",
        "Paul: Where's Rose?",
        "Dusty: Where is she? You don't know what happened, don't you?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Dusty: No? You poisoned her, you son of a bitch. Say it.",
        "Lily: Rose -- Rose, rose -- can you hear me? Rose -- I don't know. I can't tell if she's breathing or not.",
        "Bob: Give her some room.",
        "Lucinda: Bob?",
        "Chris: Pulse is thready.",
        "Bob: Call an ambulance. Get my bag out of the car. All right, Rose. All right.",
        "Lily: What's wrong with her?",
        "Bob: We'll know more when we get her to the emergency room.",
        "Lily: Rose? Come on, come on, open your eyes. Come on, Rose -- Rose, open your eyes. Just say something, please. Rose? Oh, there you go. Rose --",
        "Rose: I'm scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, my -- look at this room. It's beautiful.",
        "Ben: Nowhere near as beautiful as the woman that's about to become my wife.",
        "Jessica: Where did all this come from? Lately you've been questioning if I still see you the same way 'cause through these trying years we gonna both physically change now don't you know you'll always be the most beautiful woman I know that so let me reassure you darling that my feelings are truly unconditional I'll love you when your hair turns gray girl I still want you if you gain a little weight yeah the way I feel for you will always be the same just as long as your love don't change no I love you.",
        "Minister: At this time in the ceremony, I like to ask the bride and groom if they anything they would like to say to each other.",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Ben: Yes. Ladies first.",
        "Jessica: I knew you would say that.",
        "Ben: You did?",
        "Jessica: You are an old-fashioned guy, Ben Harris. I think the word is gallant. You have a deep, deep kindness in you. You have a -- a kind of patience that doesn't seem to exist in this world anymore. And I should know. Because you have been so incredibly patient with me. When lesser men would have run, you stayed. When lesser men would have guarded their wounded pride, you tended to my wounds instead. When I shut down and pushed you away -- you knew I didn't mean it. Because you -- you see me. You see my soul. You know that the person, the face that I show to the world isn't the person inside. And you take care of that inside person. You -- you nurture her, and you soothe her doubts, kiss away her fears. You heal her. And tonight, I want to thank you for that. And I want to promise that if you should ever need it, I will do the same for you. Because I love you, and I will treasure you for the rest of my days.",
        "Ben: I've never felt more grateful to God and filled with his grace than I do right at this moment. You talked about my healing powers. Never underestimate yours. You came upon a drowning man, Jessica, and you breathed life into me. I had resigned myself to an existence where my passion was my work. And you changed that. You -- you changed everything. And I promise you I will never take you for granted. And I promise that you have my whole heart, now and always.",

        "Lily: How is she?",
        "Bob: We're still trying to stabilize her.",
        "Walker: Do you know of any allergies your sister may have had?",
        "Lily: Allergies? I don't know. Any allergies that Rose -- that you know of?",
        "Lucinda: No, I don't know. Do you think that this is some sort of allergic reaction to something?",
        "Walker: That's what we're hoping.",
        "Holden: And what if it isn't?",
        "Walker: If it isn't, the strongest possibility is that Rose may have ingested some kind of poison.",
        "Dusty: Poison?",
        "Bob: We're screening her blood for toxins. Once we get the results, we'll know a lot more. Jack, is Hal still around?",
        "Jack: He had to take Will home. Sounds like you're expecting to work with the department on this.",
        "Bob: It's beginning to look like it.",
        "Jack: I'll give him a call.",
        "Carly: How could Rose have been poisoned?",
        "Emily: When would it have happened?",
        "Dusty: Doesn't matter. You -- I mean, you'll be able to take care of it by pumping her stomach or whatever, right?",
        "Walker: Well, until we know what we're dealing with, we can't do much of anything. That's the problem. We're gonna move her to the ICI.",
        "Lily: Can I just see her, please?",
        "Bob: Not for long, Lily.",
        "Lily: I won't be. I understand.",
        "Dusty: I'd like to see her, too.",
        "Lily: No!",
        "Walker: One visitor, that's all.",
        "Dusty: I don't know why she didn't listen to me. It's exactly what I said he'd do.",
        "Holden: What are you saying?",
        "Dusty: What do you think I'm saying?",
        "Holden: You think Paul poisoned her?",
        "Dusty: Who else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Tell me something. How do you feel?",
        "Emily: Probably the same way you do, like I'm in the middle of a horror movie.",
        "Carly: No, no, Emily, I mean, physically, how do you feel?",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Carly: Rose said she didn't eat anything today. That means all she had was that champagne at the church.",
        "Emily: And we had the same champagne. So if it was poisoned, why aren't we sick?",
        "Carly: Exactly. We all drank from the same bottle.",
        "Emily: We all had separate glasses, remember? Rose, she had her own goblet remember the goblet?",
        "Carly: Of course. I gotta find Jack.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I'm afraid this is going to be a rather long night. Would you be so kind, Clark, as to take Lucy home?",
        "Clark: Sure, whatever she wants.",
        "Lucy: How can I leave? Rose is family.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, sometimes there can just be too much family at a time of crisis. I mean, I'll call you at home as soon as we know anything.",
        "Lucy: Promise?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely.",
        "Lucy: I wonder if someone's gonna call Aaron.",
        "Lucinda: Aaron? Aaron needs to be called?",
        "Lucy: Well, he wasn't at the church when it happened. He went somewhere for some reason. Holden and Lily have enough things to worry about. I'm just wondering if I should call and tell him what happened.",
        "Lucinda: That's not your job, darling. I'll take care of it. I'll find the time. Oh, you look so pale. Clark, you take this girl and get her some food before you take her home. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Emily, hi. How's Rose? They were saying that she might have had a panic attack or something?",
        "Emily: No, Jennifer. It wasn't a panic attack. Rose is critical. They think she might have been poisoned.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, my God. Well, does Paul know?",
        "Emily: I have no idea.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, its Jen. Thank God I found you.",
        "Paul: Jen, I don't really feel like talking very much right now.",
        "Jennifer: No, Paul, I'm at the hospital. You have to come here now. It's an emergency.",
        "Paul: Is everything all right? You okay? Is will all right?",
        "Jennifer: No. It's -- it's Rose. She collapsed at the church, and they -- they rushed her to Memorial in an ambulance. And now they're saying that she's in critical condition. And it's bad, Paul. She might not make it. Paul? Paul, did you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I can't believe it. I don't know anyone more full of life than Rose. I'm sure it doesn't seem like it, but Rose and Paul really loved each other.",
        "Clark: What happened?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. How can you be so in love one day, and then the next it all changes? Someone you thought you knew does something that you never imagined they could? Something you can't even begin to understand, and the next thing you know, this wonderful person that you thought would be in your life forever, just isn't anymore.",
        "Clark: Guess that proves my theory. Fairy tales don't work out that great in real life.",
        "Lucy: Maybe you're right.",
        "Clark: That came out all wrong. I don't mean that nobody's allowed to live happily ever after. It's just -- it's finding the right person who does. That doesn't happen all the time.",
        "Lucy: No, but it does happen sometimes.",
        "Clark: Well, if it does -- I guess you're supposed to grab on to them and never let go. I'm gonna grab a shake. I'll be right back.",
        "Lucy: Aaron should know. Aaron should know about Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Whoa. Where is everybody?",
        "Alison: How can the ceremony be over?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, you'd think there'd be a couple people hanging out or, you know, a photographer or something.",
        "Alison: This is just way too creepy. Aaron, look. This is the bride's bouquet. Why would she leave it here? She's supposed to throw it at the reception.",
        "Aaron: It looks like -- looks like everybody was in a hurry to get out of here.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe they wanted to get to the party and have champagne and relax.",
        "Aaron: Well, maybe we should head there ourselves. Tell everybody the big news.",
        "Alison: About that -- I'm kind of having second thoughts.",
        "Aaron: What, about getting married?",
        "Alison: No, no, not that. Just maybe right now isn't the best time to break the news to everyone. I mean, your folks are in the wedding party, and they're probably making toasts and taking pictures. And I can just picture my mom, just throwing a fit in front of half the town.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, maybe you're right.",
        "Alison: And after they finally do calm down, they'll probably just try to take over and make this all about themselves.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, and this way, we have -- we have more time, you know, a chance to plan our wedding.",
        "Alison: Exactly.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. So -- how do you plan a wedding?",
        "Alison: Not a clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We did it.",
        "Ben: Mm-hmm. We did. I want to propose a toast.",
        "Jessica: Okay, is there anymore champagne left?",
        "Ben: I think I can come up with enough bubbles here.",
        "Jessica: All right.",
        "Ben: To my wife. My passion for life.",
        "Jessica: I'd like to propose a toast, too. To my baby girl, Bonnie. I wish she was here to see how happy you have made her mother.",
        "Jessica: You have enough bubbles for now?",
        "Ben: I think we should dance some more.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Okay.",
        "Ben: Dance until we run out of music.",
        "Jessica: Oh, we don't need music. We have the waves and the wind in the trees. We have everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Rose? Can you -- can you hear me? Come on, Rose. Come on, Rose, you're a fighter. You got to fight this. Because I need you here. Okay? You got to stay tough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where is she? Where's Rose? Where is she?",
        "Dusty: You don't know what happened, don't you?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Dusty: No? You poisoned her, you son of a bitch. Say it. Didn't you?!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lucy: Rose collapsed, and they had to rush her to the hospital.",
        "Rosanna: Is she all right?",
        "Lucy: From what they've been saying, it looks pretty serious.",
        "Paul: I got to go see her.",
        "Hal: Paul, Dusty --",
        "Dusty: Come here. Where are you going? I don't think you're going in there to see her. You already tried to kill her once, you don't get a second chance."
