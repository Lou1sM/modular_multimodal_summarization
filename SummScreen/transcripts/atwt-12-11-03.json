I mean, \r\nwhat I'm trying to say is -- you guys have gotten past so many things. Her \r\nfather, that girl from Seattle, the fire. ",
        "Aaron: We're \r\npregnant, Ali. ",
        "Alison: But \r\npregnant and married are two different things. I know this was my idea, but if \r\nyou change your mind, if -- if you think that you and Lucy can still have a \r\nchance, then -- then we shouldn't get married. ",
