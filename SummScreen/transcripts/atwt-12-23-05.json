        "Lily: Hi.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: Oh, \r\nGod. Holden's got the girls out. They're doing some serious sledding. They'll be \r\nback shortly. ",
        "Lily: Okay. Is \r\nLuke here? ",
        "Lucinda: Uh, \r\nno, not at the moment. ",
        "Lily: There's \r\nsomething I need to discuss with you. It's about tomorrow. ",
        "Lucinda: Oh --\r\n",
        "Lily: No, I --\r\n",
        "Lucinda: Oh.\r\n",
        "Keith: Hey. \r\nMerry Christmas, everyone. ",
        "Holden: What \r\nare you talking about? I didn't hear any sleigh bells. ",
        "Faith: They're \r\nfrom Santa\u2019s sleigh, Daddy. ",
        "Holden: Oh, \r\nwell, then we'd better hang our stockings. ",
        "Faith: I told \r\nyou I heard Santa. ",
        "Dusty: Ho, ho, \r\nho, ho. ",
        "Lucinda: Yes.\r\n",
        "Keith: Merry \r\nChristmas, Holden. I hope you don't mind me dropping by, but Lily insisted. And \r\nin the future, after we're married, feel free to drop by our family occasions, \r\n'cause we're gonna have a lot to celebrate. ",
        "",
        "Emily: I went \r\nto Tom\u2019s. And I went to see Daniel, and they wouldn't let me see him -- I mean, \r\nthey let me see him for five minutes. Five minutes, Mother, and Margo was \r\nstanding there looking at the clock the entire time. And poor Daniel, he looked \r\nso confused, you know? He thought I was working out of town or something. \r\n",
        "Susan: Well, \r\nthey've got to tell him something. They can't tell him you were in jail. \r\n",
        "Emily: I'm not \r\nin jail anymore. Mother, I'm his mother. It's Christmas. ",
        "Susan: I know, \r\nI know. I'm sorry. ",
        "Emily: This is \r\nawful. I mean, you've got to help me fight this. If they don't let me see my own \r\nson, what am I gonna do? ",
        "Susan: What did \r\nTom say exactly? ",
        "Emily: Tom \r\nwasn't even there. He had Margo doing his dirty work, and she acted like she was \r\ndoing me some kind of favor letting me see my own son. ",
        "Susan: Maybe -- \r\nmaybe she didn't know how to handle the situation. ",
        "Emily: Mother, \r\nwhat is the situation? I am his mother, and it is Christmas! ",
        "Susan: You're \r\nright! You're right. And you're free and clear, and Tom has no legal grounds to \r\nwithhold custody or visitation or anything. And if he tries, we'll go after him.\r\n",
        "Emily: You're \r\ngonna help me? ",
        "Susan: Of \r\ncourse I'll help you. I'm your mother. ",
        "Emily: Thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Susan: Sweetie.\r\n",
        "Emily: Thank \r\nyou. Oh, okay, so now on top of everything else, Hal\u2019s decided to play hardball \r\nand won't let me see Paul. But I know Paul would agree with you, you know? If \r\nTom's gonna deny visitation, then I got to take him to family court, right?\r\n",
        "Susan: Oh, \r\nwell, it's nice to know Paul would agree with me. ",
        "Emily: Paul \r\nwants us to be a family, and as soon as I get my son back, we will. The three of \r\nus, we'll be a family. ",
        "Susan: Emily, \r\nyou can't be serious. ",
        "Emily: Serious \r\nabout what? ",
        "Susan: I don't \r\nknow where to start. What makes you think Paul will be released after what he's \r\ndone, or that you two will be together? It's never gonna happen. You have to let \r\nhim go. ",
        "",
        "Paul: Is that \r\nthe ghost of Christmas past, come to tell me where I've gone wrong? If you're \r\nlooking for someone to blame, mother, you can look in the mirror. ",
        "Barbara: So I'm \r\nto blame for this? ",
        "Paul: No. Well, \r\nyou did marry Craig, so yeah, in that sense, you did bring him into the fold. \r\nBut no, this is all me. ",
        "Barbara: You \r\nalmost sound proud of yourself. ",
        "Paul: Proud of \r\nmyself? No. I have failed completely. I'm in jail. Jennifer is raising Craig\u2019s \r\nson. ",
        "Barbara: \r\nJennifer is raising her son. ",
        "Paul: Her son \r\nwould have been happy. And so would she have been, if she had just been willing \r\nto move on, to just start over. ",
        "Barbara: It's \r\nnot so easy to start over after losing a child. I know that. I was able \r\neventually to start over when I lost the baby. But your sister? She's a tender \r\ncreature. ",
        "Paul: That's \r\nwhy I tried to protect her from Craig. ",
        "Barbara: I \r\nbelieve that. And I believe I understand your motivation better than you do.\r\n",
        "Paul: If you're \r\nhere to give me forgiveness, don't bother. I -- I don't need it. ",
        "Barbara: No, \r\nPaul. I'm here to say good-bye. ",
        "",
        "Gwen: Uh, I \r\nguess it wasn't such a good idea for me to come after all. I'm sorry, I have to \r\nget out of here. ",
        "Jennifer: Wait, \r\nwait. Gwen, you can't run away from this anymore than I could. No, I think that \r\nwe should talk about this, for the baby's sake. ",
        "",
        "Meg: So girls, \r\nis there anything you want to ask Santa? I know you sent him a letter. \r\n",
        "[Dusty in a \r\ndeep voice] ",
        "Dusty: Wait a \r\nminute. Before Santa hands out any gifts this year, he needs to know if you \r\ngirls have been good. ",
        "Lucinda: Faith, \r\nhoney, Santa asked you a question. ",
        "Faith: I was \r\nwrong. That's not Santa. That's Dusty. ",
        "Dusty: All \r\nright! ",
        "Lucinda: That's \r\nmy girl! That's my girl! ",
        "Dusty: All \r\nright, you caught me, so I'm not Santa. But I am one of Santa\u2019s closest friends. \r\nIn fact, you might even call me his spy. ",
        "Meg: That would \r\nbe elf. ",
        "Dusty: Do I \r\nlook like an elf? Do I look like an elf? ",
        "Girls together: \r\nNo. ",
        "Dusty: No, I'm \r\na spy. I'm here to make sure you hang the stockings correctly and make sure you \r\nput out a plate of cookies, so when the man comes down the chimney, he's got \r\nsomething to eat. ",
        "Keith: Well, \r\nlet's hear it for the guy in the red suit, huh? ",
        "Lucinda: Okay, \r\nwell, why don't we just girls let's go into Grandma Emma\u2019s parlor and hang up \r\nthose stockings. And Santa\u2019s spy, can you help us? I'm just so helpless. I need \r\nhelp. ",
        "Dusty: Let's do \r\nit. Let's do it. Let's help out. ",
        "Lucinda: Come \r\non, come on. I need help, help, help. Wonderful, wonderful. ",
        "Keith: So, do \r\nyou want to go help? That's what you want to do? ",
        "Lily: Sure. \r\nSure, why not? ",
        "Meg: What the \r\nhell's going on here? ",
        "Holden: I wish \r\nI knew. ",
        "Meg: How could \r\nshe bring him here? ",
        "Holden: You \r\nknow what? Now is not the time. Let's not get into it. ",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, \r\nbut that's wrong. ",
        "Holden: I want \r\nthe kids to have a good Christmas, and that won't happen if I start in with \r\nKeith. ",
        "Meg: I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Holden: Let's \r\njust -- let's try and stay positive. So Dusty seems right at home. ",
        "Meg: Yeah, he \r\nwas a real sport putting on that Santa suit. ",
        "Holden: Yeah, \r\nbetter him than me. So did you guys move into your place? ",
        "Meg: Yeah, and \r\nit's great. I've never been as happy, I don't think. ",
        "Holden: It \r\nshows. ",
        "Meg: And he's \r\nhappy. So -- ",
        "Holden: So that \r\nmeans that I guess I was wrong about the guy. ",
        "Meg: You and \r\nMama. I understand you're protective, but he really is a good guy. ",
        "Holden: Word is \r\nthat he's responsible for reuniting Jennifer Munson and her baby. How could Paul \r\npossibly keep them apart, and how did Emily get involved? What could Paul have \r\npossibly said to convince Emily to keep Jennifer from her child? ",
        "Meg: I'm \r\nsurprised Emily was part of any of this. But you know, Paul can be pretty \r\nconvincing when he sets his mind to it. Okay, look, I'm not saying that what she \r\ndid was right. But you know, Emily, she loves the guy. ",
        "Holden: That's \r\nno excuse. ",
        "Meg: No, it \r\nisn't, and now she has to live with it. ",
        "",
        "Emily: I'm not \r\nlistening. ",
        "Susan: Honey! \r\nYou've been given a second chance. Jennifer has dropped the charges. ",
        "Emily: Yeah, \r\nbecause Hal begged her to. I think he thinks he can get me back or something.\r\n",
        "Susan: He knows \r\nthat's not gonna happen. ",
        "Emily: No, it's \r\nnot gonna happen, because I am in love with Paul. And I'm not going to abandon \r\nhim because it's inconvenient to you or Hal or anybody else, for that matter.\r\n",
        "Susan: Well, I \r\nwonder if he would do the same for you. I just wonder, because I think he's \r\npretending to be all concerned about Jennifer. I think this is all about \r\nRosanna, and why you would let him use you -- ",
        "Emily: He's not \r\nusing me. He loves me. He loves me, and I don't care what you think. We're \r\ngetting married. That was his idea. Now if you don't believe that, I can't talk \r\nto you. ",
        "Susan: Emily, \r\nis having Paul worth losing your son? ",
        "Emily: I will \r\nnot lose Paul, not to please you or anyone. ",
        "",
        "Paul: You're \r\nhere to say good-bye? Be still my heart. ",
        "Barbara: \r\nJennifer has told me that if I wish to stay in her life and help her raise this \r\nbaby, that I have to cut off all ties to you. And I've accepted her terms.\r\n",
        "Paul: You \r\nreally are something. I gotta give it to you, Mom. You have managed to -- to \r\nturn this whole thing around and use it somehow to your advantage. ",
        "Barbara: You \r\nthink this is funny, Paul? ",
        "Paul: You know \r\nwhat I think? I think that when Jennifer had that baby, you and Jennifer, you \r\nwere barely on speaking terms. And then when she becomes the grieving mother, \r\nall the sudden, you have an opening. All the sudden, you have something in \r\ncommon. You have something that you can use. Look at what I did for you, Mother. \r\nI have put you right in the bosom of your family, right exactly where you have \r\nalways wanted to be. ",
        "Barbara: Not \r\nlike this, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Beggars \r\ncan't be choosers. ",
        "Barbara: You \r\nknow what? I love all of my children. All of you -- you and Jennifer and Will.\r\n",
        "Paul: Right.\r\n",
        "Barbara: You \r\nmean everything to me. ",
        "Paul: And yet, \r\nyou have accepted her terms. ",
        "Barbara: She's \r\nalone with a baby. ",
        "Paul: Don't \r\nworry about Paul. He'll be fine. He'll be tucked in with the general prison \r\npopulation. I'll be just fine. Three squares a day, plenty of sports, plenty of \r\nrecreational activity. I can't wait to see the convicts when they realize that \r\nthere's a fashion executive on the cell block. ",
        "Barbara: Is \r\nCass Winthrop representing you? Uh, because if he's not, I can make some phone \r\ncalls. ",
        "Paul: Would you \r\nnow? That's very generous of you. ",
        "Barbara: That's \r\nnot fair, Paul. This is your doing. ",
        "Paul: This is \r\nnot my doing. Craig did this. You, of all people, I thought would understand \r\nthat. You, of all people, I thought you'd be able to get through to Jennifer.\r\n",
        "Barbara: I \r\ncould have, but you took this too far. ",
        "Paul: You mean \r\nI almost succeeded. ",
        "Barbara: Don't \r\nyou see what you did to her, how far gone she was? You should have stopped all \r\nthis when she got involved with the drugs! ",
        "Paul: So it's a \r\nmatter of degree? ",
        "Barbara: And \r\ncommon sense, and compassion. You were fixated on Craig! ",
        "Paul: Well, \r\nlook who's talking. ",
        "Barbara: Okay, \r\nokay, I've made mistakes, yes. But I have never been cruel, Paul. ",
        "Paul: That's a \r\nmatter of opinion. And it is also completely beside the point. The point is \r\nthat you have chosen Jennifer, and Jennifer has chosen her son. And poor little \r\nold Paul, well, he can just go pack it in. ",
        "Barbara: I'm \r\nsure that your attorneys can explain the mitigating circumstances -- ",
        "Paul: I do not \r\nneed your legal advice, thank you. ",
        "Barbara: No, \r\nyou don\u2019t. What you need is your sister's forgiveness. And I don't think you're \r\never going to get it. ",
        "",
        "Jennifer: Gwen, \r\nI'm really glad that you came out. I've been wanting to talk to you. Um, I know \r\nthat you came by my mom's house. ",
        "Gwen: I just \r\nwanted to say good-bye to him. You can ask Will. ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nno, I know. And I'm -- I'm really glad that you had a chance to see him. \r\n",
        "Kim: Will, why \r\ndon't we give them some privacy. ",
        "Will: Yeah, \r\nI'll be right over there, okay? ",
        "Gwen: I know \r\nyou probably don't want me around him. ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nGwen. No, I do. Because I know what you're going through, and I owe you so much. \r\nYou really took care of him. He's -- he's healthy, he's happy. And this is not \r\nyour fault. My brother Paul did this to you. ",
        "Gwen: Craig did \r\nthis. ",
        "Jennifer: Yes, \r\nbut Paul made it so much worse, and I'm really sorry for that. ",
        "Gwen: It's not \r\nyour fault. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, \r\nI mean, if there's anything that I can do, anything at all -- do you want to \r\nhold him? ",
        "Gwen: You'd let \r\nme? ",
        "Jennifer: Of \r\ncourse. ",
        "Gwen: No, I \r\ncan\u2019t. I'm sorry. [Baby cries] ",
        "Will: You okay?\r\n",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm \r\nsorry. ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\ndidn't mean to upset you. ",
        "Gwen: No, I \r\nappreciate the offer. It's just -- if I hold him, I don't know if I'll be able \r\nto let him go. ",

        "Jennifer: I \r\nunderstand. ",

        "[Baby fusses]\r\n",
        "Jennifer: You \r\nknow what? I think he's -- he's getting a little restless. I think I'm gonna \r\ntake him home. Can you tell Aunt Kim that I'm not staying for the service?\r\n",
        "Will: Thanks, \r\nJen. Gwen could really use a little peace of mind. ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\nknow. ",
        "Will: Listen, \r\nI'm sorry I haven't called you. ",
        "Jennifer: Hey, \r\nyou've got -- you've got enough on your plate, okay? And I know that you were \r\ngoing to be helping raise him, but he's still your nephew. And I would really \r\nlike it if you were part of his life. And Gwen, too, whenever she's had enough \r\ntime. ",
        "Will: Well, I \r\ncan't speak for Gwen, but I'd be happy to be a part of his life. ",

        "Gwen: No, you \r\ndid nothing wrong. ",
        "Jennifer: It's \r\nalmost Christmas, Johnny. Let's make a wish. I wish -- well, that would be \r\nselfish now, wouldn't it? 'Cause we already have so much. Thanks to Dusty. He \r\nbrought you home to me. Merry Christmas, Dusty, and thank you. ",
