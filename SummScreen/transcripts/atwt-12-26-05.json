        "Holden continues to press Lily to leave Keith and come back to her family; she does admit she will always love him though. Keith finds them in the barn and wonders what kind of message she is sending him and her kids by running off to see Holden? He also tells Lily maybe there won't be some cosmic justice for her going back on her word to him, but he says it in a way that reminds her of her fear. Holden finds Luke and wonders if he is drinking? Luke denies it, but his breath is overwhelmingly minty fresh. Luke figures out why his mom is with Keith; Holden tries to rationalize it, but Luke feels guilty and wishes he never woke up. Lily overhears this and angrily reprimands Luke, but then is forced to leave with Keith. Mike worries about Katie promising to stay away from BJ so Maddie goes looking for her, and finds her and BJ kissing. Katie takes her aside and explains she is keeping up appearances until the telethon when BJ promised to have Henry there. She has to avoid Mike so he doesn't play hero. She pleads with Maddie to go along with her. Maddie does when she hears about Henry's promised return and tells Mike that Katie is swamped with work. She tells him that Katie set BJ straight. Meanwhile, BJ's revenge wheels are spinning as he tells Katie which dress to wear tomorrow and how she will be in charge of a machine with an a strong electrical charge. His plan is coming together in his mind for a night Katie will never forget. Carly confronts Jack about him pretending to still be working with the FBI. Jack admits he is also helping Mike with the BJ situation. Gwen desperately wants to have another baby with Will, but Will thinks they should slow down. Gwen wonders if his feelings for her have changed because Billy is gone? Will just doesn't want them to replace the void they feel for losing Billy with another baby. Gwen takes off. Will later bumps into Carly and they have a heart to heart as Carly mentions losing Nora. Their talk leads to Will going to find Gwen to tell her that he wants to have a baby with her. Dusty finds evidence that Meg was in Tampa when he and Jen were, but doesn't know how to ask her about it especially when Meg shows him a picture she has kept over the years of them that Caleb took when they were teenagers that she wanted to give to him for a housewarming gift. When Emma overhears Dusty talking to himself about just \"needing to ask Meg something\" she worries that he is going to ask her to marry him. As they are leaving though, Emma thanks Dusty for putting a smile on her daughter's face."

        "Holden: The only thing that you owe anybody is the truth. Now tell me -- how do you feel about me?",
        "Lily: I love you. I will always love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Katie, call me as soon as you get this. [Knocking on door] Come in. Oh.",
        "Maddie: Aw, I thought you liked Al's.",
        "Mike: No, I do, I do. Thank you. I was just hoping it was Katie. I've been calling her all day. She's not calling me back.",
        "Maddie: Well, it looks like she's been here, unless you have a serious elf infestation.",
        "Mike: No, she's been here. She left a candy cane on my pillow.",
        "Maddie: Aw.",
        "Mike: I don't understand why she's not returning my calls.",
        "Maddie: Maybe she's at work. What?",
        "Mike: Oh, maybe she's going after B.J. like she promised she wouldn't.",
        "Maddie: No, what are you doing? You cannot get up. Nurse!",
        "Mike: I can't let her be in danger.",
        "Maddie: She wouldn't do that, Mike.",
        "Mike: Yes she would, and you know she would.",
        "Maddie: I need a nurse, please. Nurse!",
        "Mike: That's why she's not calling me back.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Mike: Because she's going against everything that she promised. She thinks she can con B.J. into finding out where Henry is. She's wrong. It's just suicide, okay? I can't let her do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: And can you get me the names of the local celebrities that are going to be manning the phones? I think the mayor, maybe some of the city council members will be here. I just want to make sure that I pronounce their names when I announce them during the telethon.",
        "B.J.: There's my girl.",
        "Katie: B.J., hi. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "B.J.: Do you mind if I borrow Katie for a second? I want to show you something. Come here.",
        "Katie: Oh, I've been wanting to see this.",
        "B.J.: It's a pledge machine for the telethon.",
        "Katie: Wow!",
        "B.J.: Yeah, it's just our little way of showing the audience how much they've pledged. See, as the temperature rises.",
        "[Bells ringing]",
        "Katie: Somebody's making a big pledge. That is great. Henry'll love it. He will be here by then, right? Because, you know, once I have my talk with him, there'll be no more unfinished business in my life. You and I can start talking about our future. What? You think closure's one of those trendy words that I don't really mean?",
        "B.J.: No. You'll have closure, Katie. I promise you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: Hey, honey.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Jenny Leebo has the kids at the rink. I just came by for a hot cocoa run, and then I'm going to take her stuff and ours to the clothing drive. What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Just came by to get a cup of coffee.",
        "Carly: I made you a pot of coffee before I left.",
        "Jack: I know. And it was great, it was. Listen, I gotta run. I wanted to go by WOAK and see about volunteering for the telethon. And I promised Mike that I'd keep an eye on B.J.",
        "Carly: Won't that interfere with your work with the bureau?",
        "Jack: It shouldn't, no. I'll be okay. All right, I'll see you later.",
        "Carly: Night watchman? Oh, Jack.",
        "Jack: Honey, it's going to be okay.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Jack: The bureau decided that they were going to back off B.J. Green. They don't need me anymore.",
        "Carly: And you were planning on telling me this, when?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You want a baby?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, what do you think?",
        "Will: I think -- you mean some day? I just -- I assume you mean with me.",
        "Gwen: Of course with you. Who else?",
        "Will: No, I just --",
        "Gwen: And not some day. Now. I want us to have a baby now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Meg was in Tampa when Jen and I were there. Why didn't she say anything?",
        "Meg: Hey. Did you see that picture Faith drew for me?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I did.",
        "Meg: She's such a sweetheart. What's that?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "Dusty: Everything fell out of the folder. It was in the drawer. The one with the picture that Faith gave you.",
        "Meg: This is just some stuff I left here when we moved in together. Actually, I was looking for this earlier, and I couldn't find it.",
        "Dusty: But it's yours, right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, just some receipts, paperwork. I'll go through it later. I am glad we are alone, though, because I have a surprise for you. Okay, just a little housewarming, moving in together sort of thing for both of us.",
        "Dusty: From you?",
        "Meg: Yeah, go ahead, open it.",
        "Dusty: This is you and me.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I was maybe 15, and you were an older distinguished man of 16 or older. And we were standing right over here.",
        "Dusty: I see, I see.",
        "Meg: Uh-huh. And Caleb took the picture, and he had just got the camera that day, remember?",
        "Dusty: Mm-hmm. Where'd you find this?",
        "Meg: I had it. I kept it. It got buried for a little while when I was married, but I knew where it was.",
        "Dusty: That's such a long time ago.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and yet, here we are, back in Mama's kitchen. Although now, kind of more than just friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: They just told me yesterday.",
        "Carly: Yesterday? You should've told me the minute it happened, Jack.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Carly. Like you tell me everything the second it happens.",
        "Carly: We're not talking about me. We're talking about you, aren't we? And you don't keep secrets.",
        "Jack: Okay, honey, I wasn't trying to keep this job thing from you. Believe it or not, I was trying to spare you. I know what you've been through the last couple of months. Rosanna's accident, Iris, losing the baby. I was just trying to buy you a couple of days to settle down. That's all. It's going to be fine. I'll find something.",
        "Carly: This is my fault.",
        "Jack: No, honey, it's not your fault. What? You're not the reason the FBI backed off B.J. Green.",
        "Carly: I'm the reason that Hal kicked you off the force.",
        "Jack: Honey, everything's over. It's over. Gwen forgave you. You got a suspended sentence.",
        "Carly: Well, yeah. If I got off, then why can't you? And what I did was much worse than what you did, and it's been weeks, right? You've learned your lesson, haven't you? You've been punished. I'm sure that Hal would take you back.",
        "Jack: It's not only up to Hal.",
        "Carly: Well, have you talked to him about it lately?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Jack: That's not the way it works, honey.",
        "Carly: I'll talk to him.",
        "Jack: No, absolutely not!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen. Gwen, we can't get pregnant now.",
        "Gwen: Why not?",
        "Will: I know how much you loved Billy. You still love him. It was killing you to see him with Jen.",
        "Gwen: Jen was great.",
        "Will: I know she was, but it doesn't change the way it made you feel to see him in her arms. And then there's your son, the baby that died in the hospital, and you never even got a chance to hold him. And now you're supposed to somehow mourn him, and I don't know how you do that, except you have to. You have to say good-bye.",
        "Gwen: That's just it, I have. If Craig hadn't switched the babies, I would've known that my son had died right away, right? But then I never would've realized how much I loved him. I never would've let myself. I fell in love with your sister's kid. And now I know what it feels like to be a mom.",
        "Will: And you were a great mother.",
        "Gwen: Then what's changed? You're still you. I'm still me. Remember how we used to talk about having the kind of family that we never had growing up? The kind that talked to each other and took care of each other. Where it was safe and it felt good.",
        "Will: And I still want all of that with you.",
        "Gwen: Then what's the problem?",
        "Will: The problem? There's no problem. It's a fine idea. A couple of hours ago, you never wanted to see me again. And now you want to have a baby?",
        "Gwen: You're right, it's a bad idea, never mind.",
        "Will: No, Gwen, don't do that.",
        "Gwen: Look, fine. You don't want to have a baby. It's no big deal.",
        "Will: It is a big deal. You can't just say that you're going to have a kid. You need to plan for it. You can't just jump in.",
        "Gwen: We jumped in with Billy.",
        "Will: We didn't have a choice with Billy. And now we do. We need to go back to school. We need to get our lives together. What? What did I say?",
        "Gwen: You're glad that the baby wasn't mine. You're relieved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I can't -- I can't do this.",
        "Holden: Yes, you can. Just tell Keith the truth. Tell him that you love me and that you want to come home to your family.",
        "Keith: Lily! Well, there you are. I was worried about you. You said you were going to go out and call Sierra.",
        "Lily: I tried to call her and the reception was bad in the house and then I came out here.",
        "Keith: Really? That's funny, because every time I make a call, I always get out. Here, try mine.",
        "Lily: Okay, I will. I'll be right back.",
        "Keith: You know, if I was you, Holden, I'd stop chasing after my ex-wife and I'd start paying attention to my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I do not want you talking to Hal.",
        "Carly: Why? Because he blames me for what you did?",
        "Jack: No, he doesn't blame you, honey. And why should he? Nobody forced me to get that park vendor to change his statement.",
        "Carly: You did it for me.",
        "Jack: No, honey, I did it -- it doesn't matter why I did it. I did it. It was a mistake, and it made matters worse, which is why they have rules in the first place. And good cops, they don't break the rules.",
        "Carly: You are a good cop. You're a wonderful cop.",
        "Jack: Honey, I don't regret protecting you or the kids. I'm going to get through this.",
        "Carly: I know I could go back to work.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: I don't mind at all. And now that Jen has Johnny to take care of, she can probably use a hand at Street Jeans.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I doubt that Jen is going to want you to be that person. Why would you do that to yourself?",
        "Carly: Because I want to help.",
        "Jack: You do help. Talking to you helps. Knowing that when I come home from a long day, that you're there, that helps, honey. That's what it's all about. I gotta get to WOAK. I promised Mike.",
        "Carly: Okay. If this B.J. guy is dangerous if this B.J. guy is dangerous at all, I expect you to have some kind of back up.",
        "Jack: If I need re-enforcements, all I have to do is call Hal, okay? Kiss the kids.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What about Katie? If she's still going after B.J. --",
        "Maddie: Poor Katie.",
        "Mike: What, you care?",
        "Maddie: Of course I care. I was mad at you. Then you saved my life, so now you're forgiven. Very forgiven. After all, even though you did steal Henry's girl, you are still his best friend, even if he -- well, if he's okay.",
        "Mike: Maddie, I'm sure he's okay. B.J. might be a creep, but he's not a killer.",
        "Maddie: So then why are you so worried about Katie?",
        "Mike: Because B.J. has been obsessed with her for years. Obsession's a very unpredictable thing.",
        "Maddie: My point exactly. This is a guy who lost 200 pounds and earned a million dollars before he was 30. Why? So he could date your girlfriend. That's super-drive. He'll stop at nothing. And if Henry gets in his way, what, you're telling me that he's not going to do whatever it takes? And it's all my fault. I was the one that told Henry to stand up to the guy, and look what happened. He disappeared.",
        "Mike: Maybe that's what happened to Katie. Maybe she's not playing him at all. Maybe she's doing exactly what I told her to do, and B.J. flipped. Maybe that's why she's not calling me back, because he's done something to her. I can't even do anything about it.",
        "Maddie: Okay, but I can. I have to go over to the station and drop off some stuff.",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Maddie: Yes, I have to go over there anyway to drop off stuff for the telethon. I'll just take a look around.",
        "Mike: Maddie, it's too dangerous. I already talked to Jack, and he's going to be looking out for B.J. while he's out, I'll have him find Katie.",
        "Maddie: I'll be there and back by the time you reach Jack, okay?",
        "Mike: Maddie, wait.",
        "Maddie: Tell him to look for Henry. I will concentrate on Katie.",
        "Mike: Maddie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You were showing me the thing about the lever.",
        "B.J.: Right. Now see, what you gotta do, when a really big donation comes in, just let her rip.",
        "Katie: I don't know. I'm not feeling the Vanna White thing. I think maybe I'd like to be more of the Pat Sajak.",
        "B.J.: This is what you have to understand. That's the beauty of it. You're both. See, you call the shots, and you make it happen. And that reminds me -- just hold on.",
        "Katie: What is this?",
        "B.J.: It's a dress I want you to wear for the telethon.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank you, but I actually already picked out something anyway.",
        "B.J.: Stop! Stop undermining me. You're going to wear that dress, and that's final.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Dusty: Nothing, it's just a long day.",
        "Meg: I was kind of hoping we could stretch out a little bit longer. I have a surprise for you back home. Let me go get Faith's picture, and then we're out of here.",
        "[Door closing]",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: Well, if you got a question, just ask her.",
        "Emma: Ask her what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What about my son?",
        "Keith: Well, I just spoke to him a little while ago. He seemed a little off.",
        "Holden: A little off?",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Holden: What are you saying? That he's been drinking?",
        "Keith: Why would he do something stupid like that and put his brand new kidney at risk?",
        "Holden: If you've got something to say, say it.",
        "Keith: He's your son. He's just a little confused, that's all. Hell, why wouldn't he be? His parents, they keep saying that they're going to get divorced, then they go back on their word.",
        "Holden: Luke doesn't want his parents to get divorced. Nobody seems to want this divorce except you. Tell my wife that I'm going up to check on our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: That's not fair. I loved Billy. You know that. And I hated losing him. It's like he was stolen. And I keep looking around like he's still there and he needs me. I've got all this affection built up and no place to put it, and it just becomes this knot in my chest.",
        "Gwen: So let's do something. Let's fix it. We can have our own baby and give him all the love that we were going to give Billy. Maybe now that you don't have to, you don't want to.",
        "Will: No, it's not that. I want children.",
        "Gwen: Just not with me?",
        "Will: Gwen, I was willing to raise Billy with you when he wasn't even mine. I did that for you, not for him.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Will: Because I love you.",
        "Gwen: But now that he's gone, you don't anymore.",
        "Will: No, of course I still love you.",
        "Gwen: Then what's the problem?",
        "Will: The problem is that we're not the same as we were before. We had Billy and now we don't, and it hurts. But I'm not going to use another baby to make everything okay again, because I know it won't be.",
        "Gwen: I thought that everything was okay -- at least with us, otherwise I never would have suggested having another child.",
        "Will: We will have one, some day.",
        "Gwen: You know what? You're right. You're right, we're not ready.",
        "Will: Gwen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Luke!",
        "Luke: I guess Keith found you and Mom. Are you in trouble?",
        "Holden: Keith seems to think that you're the one who's in trouble. Is he right? Have you been drinking?",
        "[Luke exhales]",
        "Luke: Does it smell like I've been drinking?",
        "Holden: It smells like you're hoping that mint might cover something up.",
        "Luke: Fine. Fine, just believe what you want. But after what you and Mom went through to get me this kidney, it'd be kind of stupid for me to drink, now wouldn't it?",
        "Holden: Listen, I know that things have been crazy since we got back from Mexico. Your mom and I --",
        "Luke: Are not as over as you'd like everyone to think. Now my question to you is, what are you trying to prove?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Where's Holden? What did you say to him?",
        "Keith: I told him that Luke was at home and he might want to have a word with him.",
        "Lily: Why? Has something happened?",
        "Keith: Holden's handling it.",
        "Lily: Handling what? Look, if Luke is in some sort of trouble, I have the right to know.",
        "Keith: Well, maybe if you're son's in trouble, it's because his mother is not keeping her promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You have something you want to ask my daughter?",
        "Dusty: Not necessarily, no.",
        "Emma: You're not thinking of asking her to marry you, are you?",
        "Dusty: Of course not.",
        "Emma: It's too soon.",
        "Dusty: Absolutely. I mean, she's everything a man would want.",
        "Emma: It's just been a few weeks, that's all.",
        "Dusty: That's right.",
        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Anyway, you know, Meg and I have known each other almost our whole lives.",
        "Emma: Well, I think it's just been a few weeks that she's beginning to trust you.",
        "Dusty: I care a lot about her.",
        "Emma: Yeah, she says you do.",
        "Dusty: I do.",
        "Emma: I was beginning to have my doubts, but -- she's so happy that it's hard to argue with her. Just don't make me sorry that I didn't chase you away when you came back again.",
        "Dusty: I won't. And I don't blame you for doubting me. Especially after all that stuff I've been through with Jennifer. Especially that trip we took to Tampa. Meg found out about that. She wasn't very happy.",
        "Emma: She never mentioned Tampa. It's just -- well, I know that she was very insecure around Jennifer. But she rose above it. Especially when she found out -- what was that? It was something about -- she stumbled across something that she thought could help Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: What was that?",
        "Emma: What does it matter? It was just a couple of months ago, before the two of you became serious.",
        "Meg: You're not telling him all my secrets, are you?",
        "Emma: You caught me, I'm telling him all of them. All of them.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: So, how was supper? How was the shelter?",
        "Emma: Well, it was really, really very good. A lot of people showed up to help. But I am exhausted.",
        "Meg: Well, go get some rest. We're out of here. Thank you for an amazing holiday.",
        "Emma: You're welcome. Thank you, Dusty. Thank you for putting that beautiful, beautiful smile on my daughter's face.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for a great evening. Merry Christmas.",
        "Meg: Goodnight.",
        "Meg: And here's to many, many more.",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, yes. Goodnight you two. And Merry Christmas. And listen, leave the lights on for Holden, okay?",
        "Meg: Yep.",
        "Emma: Night night.",
        "Meg: Merry Christmas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Forget it, forget it. You don't have to answer my question.",
        "Holden: I just want to know where all of this is coming from.",
        "Luke: It's obvious. Besides, I already figured it out on my own. Hey, Aunt Meg. Dusty.",
        "Meg: Hey, honey. We were just leaving.",
        "Dusty: Merry Christmas.",
        "Holden: Yeah -- yeah, Merry Christmas. Luke, you may think you know what's going on, but you don't.",
        "Luke: So Mom didn't make a deal with Keith to save my life? Just like I thought. Now we can do this two ways -- you can end it, or I can. It's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Is there something wrong with Luke's kidney?",
        "Keith: No, there's something wrong with his life. He's upset and he's confused. And so am I. You know, you bring me out here to your family house and then you sneak off with Holden to the barn. What kind of a message is that sending to your kids and to me?",
        "Lily: You're forcing me to marry you.",
        "Keith: But yet, we're not married, are we? I love you, Lily, I do. I'm sick and tired, though, of being the heavy here. I'm not a bad guy.",
        "Lily: I never said you were a bad guy.",
        "Keith: Look, I just want us to be happy. If that's not what you want, if you want to break your promise to me, maybe nothing will happen.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Keith: Well, maybe there's no such thing as cosmic justice. You break a promise you made on your son's life, maybe he'll go on and live a long, healthy and happy life. Or maybe not. That's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, I know that B.J. had a problem with me working here, but that was because he didn't want some former cop nosing around his business, and I understand that. But this is different. This isn't about B.J. at all. This is about a citizen wanting to volunteer for the telethon.",
        "Kim: Honey, you know, I would in a heartbeat take you on, but it's B.J. I mean, he's a partner. There's no way I can guarantee that he's not going to make it difficult.",
        "Jack: Okay, let me handle B.J.",
        "Kim: Wait a minute. You know what? What's the matter with me? I've got the perfect job for you. And there's no way that B.J. can say a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I had no idea that what I chose to wear was so important to you.",
        "B.J.: It's not the dress, okay? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to bark at you like that. I really didn't. It's just -- I'm so used to working alone and controlling every aspect of every project I do, and this telethon is just so, so, so important to me. And the dress, I've pictured you in it at least 100 times.",
        "Katie: Well, then, I guess I'll wear it.",
        "B.J.: Really? Good. It'll make me so happy. I just don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep tonight, thinking about what tomorrow might bring.",
        "Katie: It's going to be great.",
        "B.J.: Yeah, it's going to be great. There's one more thing I have to do.",
        "Katie: Decide on shoes?",
        "B.J.: Shoes? [B.J. laughs] No, I'll let you take care of that. It's the electrician. I just want to make sure that this pledge machine back here is in perfect working order.",
        "Maddie: What is wrong with you? Are you trying to get yourself killed? You promised Mike you'd stay away.",
        "Katie: Shhh! Maddie, shut up. You've got to be careful. I don't want him hearing you.",
        "Maddie: Oh, why's that? Because you're lying to him and Mike? You promised Mike that you'd tell B.J. to back off. And, what, now he's kissing your cheek?",
        "Katie: Oh, you think I want him kissing my cheek?",
        "Maddie: This is the guy who tried to run me over. And he put Mike in the hospital. What do you think Mike's going to do when he finds out?",
        "Katie: He's not going to find out, because you're not going to tell him.",
        "Maddie: I promised him, Katie. It was the only way I could get him back in bed. He has broken ribs. If he keeps moving around, he'll puncture a lung. Do you even care?",
        "Katie: Of course I care. I talked to the staff about it when I was there decorating his room. I know that the best thing is for Mike to stay quiet right now, which is why I'm not answering his calls. I don't want to lie to him anymore, and I don't want him to worry about me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, but that's not really working.",
        "Katie: Listen, the telethon is tomorrow. B.J. promised me that Henry will be here.",
        "Maddie: Henry, here, tomorrow?",
        "Katie: Yes, that's why I'm still playing along. As soon as I see Henry and see that he's okay, I'm telling B.J. it's over.",
        "Maddie: Okay, but what if he tries to pull something? He did take you to that deserted island.",
        "Katie: B.J. wants a future with me. I told him that we'd discuss it after I see Henry tomorrow. And it's going to work, unless Mike comes barging in here trying to play hero. If B.J. sees that, he'll know something's up, and we can basically kiss Henry good-bye.",
        "Maddie: No, no.",
        "Katie: So then, shut up, Maddie, for Henry's sake. We only have to keep B.J. in the dark one more day.",

        "Will: I don't know.",
        "Carly: What do you mean you don't know? What happened?",
        "Will: Carly, after everything we've just been through, I think I made it so much worse.",
        "Carly: Well, will, you know that sometimes when somebody's feeling really bad, they can take it out on the person they care about most.",
        "Will: No, that's not what happened.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sure that whatever did happen, Gwen will get over it.",
        "Will: You weren't there.",
        "Carly: No, but I know she loves you.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, she's just trying to get past everything. She had this idea, and I completely blew it out of the water.",
        "Carly: Couples disagree. That doesn't mean they don't love each other. Jack and I fight all the time. Well, not all the time, but you know what I mean. You're tired, you're overworked, you're going through a tough time. You take it out on each other. Just stick it out, you know? I mean, if that's what you want to do.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's what she wants, and I want that, too. I guess, you know, you're right. We don't always agree.",
        "Carly: That's what keeps things interesting. And sometimes you have to give your partner a little extra slack. Gwen is in a lot of pain.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Carly: So she's going to be hard to handle. She's going to need some time. It is very hard to accept that something you want so much is gone, and there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "Will: That's just it. I keep wishing there was something I could do.",
        "Carly: I came across something today. It was Nora's. Or, it would have been, if she lived.",
        "Will: Who's Nora?",
        "Carly: The girl I lost.",
        "Will: I'm sorry, Carly, I didn't know you lost a little girl.",
        "Carly: Miscarriage. You know, you never get over it -- losing a child. No matter how it happens, it sticks with you until you can -- I don't know, find a way to live your life. A new goal.",
        "Will: You seem fine.",
        "Carly: I am, I guess.",
        "Will: So what happened for you?",
        "Carly: Parker, I suppose. I had Parker and then Sage, and now thinking about Nora doesn't hurt quite so much.",

        "Holden: Where are you getting your information?",
        "Luke: It wasn't hard to figure out. That was me in Mexico, after all, watching Uncle Keith and the gang pack up body parts. And where else would you get a spare kidney? But for Mom to trade everything away, just to keep me alive?",
        "Holden: She felt like she had no choice.",
        "Luke: And big bad Keith was more than happy to oblige. How could you stand by and let that happen?",
        "Holden: I didn't let anything happen. You were dying. The doctors found you a kidney. I didn't know where it came from. I was just thankful that it did.",
        "Luke: And you let Mom thank Keith.",
        "Holden: No, you listen here --",
        "Luke: To what? To what, some lame excuse about why you're letting her go? She's miserable. Can't you see that?",
        "Holden: Yes, I can. And I told her that whatever obligation she thinks she has, no decent human being would hold her to it.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Luke: Oh, you told her. Well, that makes a world of difference. Listen, Dad, when I thought I was dying, the only thing that made it bearable was seeing you and Mom together. And then I woke up, and they told me that the operation was a success. It was like a dream come true to think that my whole family would be happy once again. And then Mom tells me that she's divorcing you and marrying Keith. You know what? I wish I had never woken up.",
        "Lily: Don't ever say that again.",
        "Lily: I know how upset you've been about your father and me, and I am so sorry.",

        "Mike: You found her?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm. She was at work. She's swamped, though. They have her running around for the telethon. You know, hair, makeup, costumes. It's this whole extravaganza.",
        "Mike: Well, what did she say?",
        "Maddie: Well, we only talked for a minute, but -- she's sorry, by the way, that she hasn't gotten a chance to talk to you. She called the hospital, but the nurses said that you were sleeping, so she didn't want to disturb you.",
        "Mike: Was B.J. there? Was he giving her a hard time?",
        "Maddie: As far as B.J. goes, not to worry. She has set him straight.",

        "Jerry: No problem.",
        "B.J.: Are you sure? You know, because you and I, we're probably stronger than she is. And if we get a big donation, I really need the temperature to rise.",
        "Jerry: It's plenty loose, boss. She's going to be able to pull it right to the floor.",
        "B.J.: Good. Good, that's real good. It's good to know I can always count on you, Jerry. Even for electrical work.",
