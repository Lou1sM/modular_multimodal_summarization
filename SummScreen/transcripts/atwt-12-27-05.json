Hal continues to issue \"reminders\" to Paul about how quickly he will be back behind bars, and to Emily about how much she is ruining her life. After hey leave the Police Station, Paul and Emily decide to get married that very day. Emily later sees Susan who announces she won't be at her wedding, and Emily tells her she no longer cares. Susan turns to Hal to stop Emily, but he has washed his hands of her. The minister tells Emily and Paul they can get married in 2 hours. Jack admits he has been roped into singing at the telethon as a cover to stay close to BJ; Carly wants to be there, but Jack doesn't want her there because she is a distraction in a good way, or is he just worried about her being there if something goes down? Carly pretends she is going home but then makes plans to go watch Jack, but she ends up with a flat tire instead. A stranger helps her, but he playfully insults her and she tells him to get lost. Later, Carly watches Jack on TV but also spots the man who helped her on the side of the road at the telethon as well. Maddie tries to keep Mike from turning on the TV to see Katie hosting the telethon with BJ, but he figures it out, and takes off for WOAK. Jack runs into Katie at the telethon and wants to know why she is there since Mike told him she was keeping her distance? She explains that she has gotten BJ to bring Henry there today. Familiar faces of Oakdale perform at the telethon. BJ and his \"electrician\" plant the bomb to detonate when the donation goal is met and Katie pulls the lever. BJ goes to see Henry and orders Olga to kill him but also implies he is going to kill Katie today as well. Henry tricks Olga and is able to escape. The goal is met and Katie goes to pull the lever; BJ finds Mike and Jack standing over the bomb!"

        "Hal: All right, all right you guys. Knock it off. I'm going to the telethon, so it's for a good cause, which is the only reason I wear this thing. If anybody needs me, I'll be on my cell or you can reach me through Kim Hughes at WOAK.",
        "Emily: Good, you're still here.",
        "Hal: All right, you can just leave, because I'm not in the mood to hear anymore speeches about freeing Paul Ryan. Go to a judge.",

        "Carly: Oh, right, the telethon's today. Which explains the tea.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: It's for your throat. They roped you into singing, didn't they? Come on, why didn't tell me? I'm going to call Ellen, she's going to watch the kids for a little bit longer, and I'm going to --",

        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah, I just got here. Everything okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, fine. We're about to start. Just whatever you do, make sure that Mike doesn't get anywhere near a television set. He cannot know that I'm doing this telethon with B.J.",
        "Maddie: Relax. I have it covered, okay? Is Henry there yet?",

        "Katie: Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the annual telethon for the Oakdale Police charities. We are coming to you live from WOAK. As many of you know, the Oakdale Police Department supports many charities throughout the year, but not without the help of you at home, and your generous donations. This year, we hope to raise our red marker straight to the top, and we have a very generous donation to start out with from Worldwide Industries to the tune of $150,000. [Scattered applause] Thank you very much Worldwide Industries. So, drum roll please --",
        "[Drum roll]",
        "[Machine beeps]",
        "Jerry: See there, it's all wired with explosives. Once the marker hits the golden point, it'll send a signal to the detonator, and then, good-bye telethon.",
        "Katie: And call in and make a huge donation, because you will be helping many people in need. It doesn't take a lot.",
        "B.J.: And good-bye, Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Honey, come on, the singing's just a cover. It's a way to get me in the door. I'm really there to keep an eye on B.J.",
        "Carly: You are the worst liar ever. This sounds to me like a classic case of stage fright. You don't have to worry, sweetheart. You're going to be great. You're always great. You're my great, great, sweet, singing cop.",
        "Jack: Yes, and you're my best audience, you are. But I'd feel better if you weren't there. You're too much of a distraction.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, I will take that as a compliment.",
        "Jack: It was intended to be one.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, how about this? How about I'll go home, and I watch you on the TV, okay? Will that make you happy?",
        "Jack: Yes, it will. Thank you. I'll see you at home.",
        "Carly: Okay. Bye, chicken. [Jack chuckles] Hey, hi Ellen. It's me. Will you do me a favor and just watch the kids for a couple more hours? I have to give my sweet husband some moral support.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What is the big deal about me watching TV?",
        "Maddie: Because it's rude if you have visitors. Do you wanna play chess? I think they have a chess set in the nurse's station.",
        "Mike: I don't want to play chess. I want to watch football.",
        "Maddie: Well, you can't. It got cancelled. Snow, I don't know, something. Mm- hmm.",
        "Mike: Maddie, what's the deal? What's really going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh. Wow. Will you look at this? $50,000 from Fashions! We have Fashions' own Lisa Grimaldi right here. Thank you so much, that is very generous. So let's take this up a little a bit further. [Machine beeps] All right, let's keep those phones ringing. We are doing very well, so far. But we still have a ways to go to get to our goal. In the meantime, we want to thank you so much for your contributions so far, so we have a little treat for you. Everybody put your hands together for the talented Ms. Barbara Ryan.",

        "Katie: You know, it's so great that you got Barbara to perform.",
        "Kim: Of course, if I can't talk my own niece into performing, what good am I? And speaking of performing, you are a natural, Toots. I mean, we're really going to have our goal in no time. Katie, are you okay?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, sorry. You haven't seen B.J. around, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, it's about time! I have been down here without food or water all night. It is not like you to leave me alone for so long, especially after -- B.J. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. What brings you down here to Henry's happy hole?",
        "B.J.: I've come to say good-bye.",
        "Henry: You're leaving?",
        "B.J.: No, you are.",
        "Henry: As in, you're letting me go?",
        "B.J.: As in, I'm setting you free.",
        "Henry: What's the difference?",
        "B.J.: Well, there's one of cosmic proportion.",
        "Henry: I'm not following you. I think this damp dark dungeon has dulled my senses.",
        "B.J.: Well, not to worry. I'm pretty sure you won't be needing senses where you're going.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: Honey, you want to tell me what he's talking about here, Buttercup?",
        "B.J.: You're history, Henry. Tomorrow's obituary. Got the picture?",

        "Cop: What did you need, Lieutenant?",
        "Hal: Bring up Paul Ryan. He made bail.",
        "Cop: Yes, sir.",
        "Emily: Sorry to ruin your day.",
        "Hal: Oh, he'll be back soon enough for a nice long stretch.",
        "Cass: Not if I have anything to do with it. You call me if you need anything else.",
        "Emily: Thank you. Thank you. Paul and I both are so grateful to you. Thank you.",
        "Cass: Well, he's not out of the woods yet, but at least he's out of that cell. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Cass: Good-bye, Hal.",
        "Hal: You must be very proud of yourself.",
        "Emily: No. Just relieved actually.",
        "Hal: I'm sure Jennifer doesn't share that sentiment.",
        "Emily: Jennifer has a new baby in her life. I imagine Paul's the last person on her mind.",
        "Hal: And I plan to keep it that way. If he goes anywhere near her, I'll make him sorry damn he ever made bail.",
        "Emily: You were just itching to find a reason, aren't you, Hal?",
        "Hal: You know, I thought when I convinced Jennifer not to press charges against you, it might serve as some sort of a wake-up call. But here you go, running down the same stupid path. Remember this -- when the floor crumbles underneath you again, and trust me, it will, I won't be there to catch you, Emily. You're on your own.",
        "Paul: No, she's not.",
        "Emily: Oh, hi.",
        "Hal: Enjoy each other while you can.",
        "Paul: When they told me downstairs I made bail, I couldn't believe it.",
        "Emily: I told you I wasn't giving up. Cass convinced the judge to overturn your bail ruling. I get to take you home. Oh, as soon as they sign you out.",
        "Emily: Now that you're out, let's get married. Let's do it today. Let's do it this morning. What?",
        "Paul: You sure? Look, bail is not free. I'm probably still going to have to serve time.",
        "Emily: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.",
        "Paul: I'm just saying that if you've changed your mind, I understand.",
        "Emily: If I haven't changed my mind, I never will. I want to be Mrs. Paul Ryan, and I'd like to do it when we still got a wedding night, thank you very much.",
        "Hal: Here are your things, Ryan. As far as I'm concerned, you might as well leave 'em here, because you're gonna be back.",
        "Paul: Oh, well, thanks for your hospitality, Hal. I appreciate it. I really, really do.",
        "Hal: There's a lot more where that came from. Oh, and by the way, I've got a call in to the judge, asking him to reconsider, so you better not get too comfortable.",
        "Emily: Would you give it rest all ready?",
        "Paul: Oh, stop, the man's just doing his job. Come on, Emily, let's go. We have a wedding to plan.",
        "Cop: Excuse me, sir. Aren't you going to be late for the telethon?",
        "Hal: Suddenly, I'm not in the mood.",
        "Paul: Hey, stop. Don't let him get to you. He can't touch us. At least not today, right?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Can we please go home? 'Cause -- hold this for a second.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I could really use a hot shower.",
        "Emily: You know what? Go on ahead. I'll catch up later. I've got something I need to take care of. No, it's okay, don't worry. Everything's fine. I will see you at home.",

        "Nick: Need some help?",
        "Carly: No. No, thanks.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but it looks like you've got a flat tire.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Carly: That's observant. Really, it's fine. I can handle it.",
        "Nick: I mean, are you sure? I'd be happy to give you a hand.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Okay. Fine. I mean, yes, thank you. I could use a hand.",
        "Nick: You got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I'm worried about Henry, and I'm worried that homicidal Amazon is still out there, looking to mow me down. So, okay, yeah, I'm a little jittery, I admit it.",
        "Mike: Hey, your jitters are making me jittery. And you know what calms me down when I'm really tense?",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Mike: Football. So please, hand me that remote --",
        "Nurse: Time to check on those ribs, Mr. Kasnoff. Sorry, you'll have to leave.",
        "Maddie: But I --",
        "Mike: Oh, you heard the lady.",
        "[Maddie groans]",
        "Nurse: So, how are we feeling this morning?",
        "Mike: Oh, better than yesterday. Oh, will you do me a favor and hand me that remote? It's underneath those magazines.",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Maddie: Come on, Katie, answer your phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Katie: Give it for Barbara Ryan. Thank you so much. That was fantastic. Oh, we have got another donation. A major donation, everyone. $150,000 from Arrowquest Corporation. Let's add that to the numbers. [Machine beeps] All right. Come on, viewers, I know we can do even better. It takes only 90 seconds of your time to call in and make a donation, so what are you waiting for?",
        "Tom: So how do you feel?",
        "Lisa: Does the word \"nervous\" cover everything?",
        "[Tom laughs]",
        "Tom: You know what? You better forget about that. We have to do this whether we like it or not now.",
        "Margo: \"Whether you like it or not?\" You two shovel it in with spoons, you hams!",
        "Tom: Wow. You look kind of impressive. Will you be wearing this at home, tonight?",
        "Margo: Maybe, part of it. It's zero hour.",
        "Tom: We're up next?",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. You know what? I asked Kim if she would make an extra copy of the tape, because Adam wants to see it in California, okay?",
        "Tom: Gee, thanks. Why do I always agree to this stuff?",
        "Margo: I don't know, because closing arguments before a jury and singing before a crowd are two of your ideas of heaven.",
        "Tom: Oh, I object.",
        "Margo: You're overruled.",
        "Tom: My wife, she knows me so well.",
        "Lisa: Oh, yes, that she does.",
        "Katie: Our next act is one of my favorites, because it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that talent runs in the family. Please give it up for my brother- in-law, Tom Hughes, and his mom Lisa!",
        "[Applause]",
        "Tom: Time to make history. Come on. Let's go. Two lost souls on the highway of life it ain't even marked a sister, a brother and ain't it just grand ain't it just grand we got each other two lost ships on the stormy sea one with no sail and one with no rudder and ain't it just grand",

        "Henry: You're not a killer, B.J. You're not. You don't have it in you.",
        "B.J.: Probably not. That's why I'm having Olga take care of it.",

        "Henry: What do you mean, last?",
        "B.J.: Henry, don't look so glum. The two of you might meet up in the afterlife.",
        "B.J.: You'll what? What? I'm really curious, what will you do? You come back and haunt me? Your ghost will have to find me first.",
        "Henry: Well, somebody will find you, you know that? They may not miss me after I'm gone, but they will miss Katie. And they will hunt you down, B.J. -- Mike, and jack, and tom and Margo, and every police officer, every agent from here to Tuscaloosa.",
        "B.J.: Well, then, I'll be sure to avoid Tuscaloosa. Adios amigo.",
        "Henry: Hey, it's just a bluff, right? You're not going to kill me just because he ordered you to. Are you?",
        "Olga: Sorry, Henry. I will give as little pain as possible.",

        "Emily: Yeah, everything's great, actually. Paul's been released on bail.",
        "Susan: What? I thought --",
        "Emily: My lawyer managed to reverse the judge's decision so he's free and clear for now, and we're getting married later this afternoon.",
        "Susan: Congratulations. I won't be attending the wedding.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I figured as much. You know, God forbid you be happy for me once in your life.",
        "Susan: Emily, there's only one thing would make me happy for you, and you know what that is.",
        "Emily: Well, I will never stop loving him.",
        "Susan: Well, then don't. Just get out of here, go do what you have to do.",

        "Henry: Oh, come on, would you stop it? You sound like a World War II movie.",
        "Olga: Oh, Henry. Is sad day for me, too. Now, be a good boy and put out hands so we can finish this.",
        "Henry: Now, that's just the point. See, I don't want to finish this. Why do you have to handcuff me, anyway?",
        "Olga: Olga is not doing job here in wine cellar. It's too messy.",
        "Henry: How about Olga not doing the job at all, huh? How about that? Don't you remember our recent night of passion?",
        "Olga: It was night of ecstasy.",

        "Olga: Is surprise.",
        "Henry: Oh, I hate surprises. Over there, over there, over there. Listen, I know, I realize that I cannot talk you out of this thing, but don't you think that I at least deserve a last request?",
        "Olga: You are wanting a cigarette or a nice beef goulash, maybe?",
        "Henry: No, Olga, no, no. I want ecstasy. Like we had the other night. You can have your way with me. Right here, right now. And then you can drag me off and you can kill me, because fair is fair.",
        "Olga: Oh, Henry. I don't think so.",

        "Katie: Oh, wait. Let me guess. Kim got you to sing. That's great!",

        "Katie: I am. Do you see him anywhere near me? Besides, there's, like, 30 cops in the building. He would be totally insane to try something today. Wait, how do you even know that I'm supposed to be keep my distance from B.J.?",
        "Jack: Mike said that you promised you weren't gonna be anywhere near B.J., and here you are, doing his telethon?",
        "Katie: It's not his telethon, it's the station's telethon. So, Mike sent you here to spy on me, huh?",
        "Jack: I'm here to make sure that B.J. doesn't do anything he shouldn't be doing. Mike is worried about you, of course he is.",

        "Jack: How'd you do that?",
        "Katie: Well, I told B.J. that he and I could be together if he brought back Henry so I could get closure with him, so Henry's on his way here right now.",
        "Jack: You sure about that?",
        "Katie: Yes! I'm playing him and its working. So just go back to Mike and tell him everything's fine.",

        "B.J.: And who would that be?",

        "B.J.: Running errands. Why?",
        "Katie: Well, you're missing everything. It's going great.",
        "B.J.: Excellent. That's great. You still didn't answer my question. Who's trouble?",
        "Jack: This guy I'm doing surveillance on. A real menace to society. But I was just telling Katie here that, luckily, I'm close to nailing him.",
        "B.J.: I thought you weren't a cop anymore.",
        "Jack: Private gig.",
        "B.J.: Right. Well, good luck with it. I hope you catch your man.",
