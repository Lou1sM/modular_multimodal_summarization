        "Katie: Hers?\r\n",
        "Henry: Yes, of \r\ncourse, it's hers. She was very blonde, and this worked for her in a kind of \r\nprison warden/kitten in chains kind of way. That and the stilettos. ",
        "Katie: You \r\nsound almost happy about it. ",
        "Henry: I'm not, \r\nno. Bubbles, it was hell. ",

        "Will: Truth? \r\nNever did. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, me \r\nneither. I don't get it. And what's up with this holiday anyways? People say New \r\nYear\u2019s, but it's really just this one day. Like one day really makes a \r\ndifference. ",
        "Will: Sometimes \r\nit can. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I \r\nguess. Like one day, I had a baby, and then I didn\u2019t. ",
        "Will: Like one \r\nday we were alone, and then we were together. ",
        "Gwen: I like \r\nyour one a lot better than mine. ",
        "Will: We'll \r\nmake this year all good days, okay? ",

        "Dusty: About \r\nwhat? ",
        "Meg: My \r\nsurprise. I know how much you hate surprises, and I thought for sure you would \r\ntry and get it out of me before the end of the night. Our first toast. To you.\r\n",
        "Dusty: No.\r\n",
        "Meg: To me? \r\nBecause I'm the greatest? This is where you're supposed to say \"yeah, you are.\"\r\n",

        "Susan: They're \r\nnot coming. ",
        "Hal: What?\r\n",
        "Susan: She \r\ncalled me from the car and told me. ",
        "Hal: Well, \r\nthank God she's come to her senses. ",
        "Susan: Oh, I \r\ndidn't say that. ",
        "Hal: Well, as \r\nlong as she's not marrying Paul, it's a good first step. ",
        "Susan: She's \r\nmarrying him okay. It's just the location that's changed. ",
        "Hal: Why?\r\n",
        "Susan: She told \r\nme what happened when you went to see her today. You scared her. ",
        "Hal: Oh, yeah. \r\nWell, I scared myself. ",
        "Susan: What \r\nwere you thinking? ",
        "Hal: Thinking \r\nhad very little to do with it. ",
        "Susan: So you \r\nstarted breaking things? ",
        "Hal: As I said, \r\nSusan, I owe Emily an apology. I really do. ",
        "Susan: That'll \r\nhave to wait. ",
        "Hal: Where is \r\nshe, Susan? ",
        "Susan: She \r\nwouldn't say. Only that it's someplace secluded and romantic where we'll never \r\nfind them, so don't even try, because they're going to get married no matter \r\nwhat we say. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They're going to be together for all \r\neternity. ",
        "Hal: Yep. Emily \r\nis definitely the star of her own personal movie right now. ",
        "",
        "Emily: You \r\nfound it. ",
        "Paul: Of course \r\nI did. ",
        "Emily: I wasn't \r\nsure you would, because, you know, there's snow up here, and I wasn't sure I'd \r\nfind it myself. So I decided to come up a little early. Why's the minister still \r\nin t he car? ",
        "Paul: He's not \r\nin the car. ",
        "Emily: What? I \r\ntold you to go pick him up. He's never going to be able to find us up here.\r\n",
        "Paul: He's not \r\ncoming. Emily, we're not getting married. ",
        "Emily: So, \r\nwe're not going to get married here? ",

        "Emily: Do what?\r\n",
        "Paul: I can't \r\ntake you down. Emily, I'm going to prison. ",

        "Paul: It could \r\nbe for a really long time. ",
        "Emily: You're \r\nnot going to jail. I won't let them send you to jail. We'll fight the charges.\r\n",
        "Paul: What if \r\nwe lose? ",
        "Emily: Well, \r\nthen we'll appeal. ",
        "Paul: For \r\nyears? ",
        "Emily: Stop it, \r\nokay? I'm not going to let you do this. Sweetheart, it's our wedding day, \r\nplease. ",
        "Paul: I won't \r\nsign you up for a life like that. ",
        "Emily: You \r\ndidn\u2019t. I did. The only life I want is with you, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Emily --\r\n",
        "Emily: Period. \r\nWhatever that means. ",
        "Paul: If I'm in \r\nprison, we don't have a life. You have your life on one side of the bars, and I \r\nhave my life on the other side of the bars, and I can't do that to you. \r\n",
        "Emily: Then \r\nlet's go. Let's go. ",

        "Paul: I --\r\n",
        "Emily: Why not? \r\nListen to me, who needs a life full of people judging us? It's okay, we'll just \r\n-- we'll go away. A fresh start. A new place. ",
        "Paul: You would \r\ndo that? ",
        "Emily: Yes, of \r\ncourse I would. We were going to do it before for Jennifer. ",
        "Paul: Danny. \r\nEmily, you would never see your son again. ",
        "Emily: I'd find \r\na way to get him back. No. I mean, it may take a while, but I would find a way \r\nto get him back. Please, it's okay. We can't think about all these things. We \r\nneed to focus on one thing at a time. ",
        "Paul: No. We're \r\ngoing to do what's right for you. For once, we are going to do what's right for \r\nyou. ",
        "Emily: Then \r\nmarry me. Please. Oh, God, I love that you want to take care of me and protect \r\nme, but I am a big girl. And I went into this with my eyes wide open and I am \r\nnot blinking. I want you. Whatever comes with you, I want it, all of it. So just \r\nmarry me. That's what I want. That's all I want. ",

        "Will: It's \r\ngonna be great. Fireworks at midnight. ",
        "Gwen: You want \r\nto wait until then? Oh, you mean those fireworks. ",
        "Will: You know, \r\nyou're good for my ego. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I \r\ncould say the same thing. So, we'll make this our tradition? ",
        "Will: Yeah. \r\nFrom now on, fireworks on our roof. ",
        "Gwen: Our roof. \r\nYeah, I guess it is, isn't it? ",
        "Will: Well, we \r\ncame to some pretty important decisions up here, you and me. Sometimes I forget \r\nthat I used to come up here to be alone. ",
        "Gwen: Would you \r\never still want to? ",
        "Will: Be alone? \r\nNot when I have you. ",

        "Meg: My turn. \r\nTo you, for giving me everything I ever wanted. To us. ",
        "Dusty: Let's go \r\nback to mine. You did find out about Jen's baby. ",
        "Meg: Dusty, I \r\ndon't want to be thanked for that. ",
        "Dusty: Why not?\r\n",
        "Meg: It wasn't \r\nsome big noble act. I just, you know, saw some things, and I got lucky. I mean, \r\nyou did the real work. You got Jen's baby, and I'm so happy for her. ",
        "Dusty: Come on. \r\nIt was a big deal. I mean, it was noble. ",
        "Meg: No, it \r\nwasn\u2019t. ",
        "Dusty: No? Why \r\nnot? ",
        "Meg: Because, \r\nyou know, it wasn\u2019t. You know, I ran into some charts, they were right there, \r\nand I had Jen and the baby on my mind because of you. And I just happened to \r\nglance. ",
        "Dusty: And \r\nthat's all it ",
        "Dusty: And \r\nthat's all it took. After months and months of me trying to prove that that baby \r\nbelonged to Jennifer, suddenly it's all over. ",
        "Meg: Well, I \r\nknow you must have felt relieved. ",
        "Dusty: Did you?\r\n",
        "Meg: What?\r\n",
        "Dusty: Feel \r\nrelief. I mean, you saw Jen that day, falling apart. ",
        "Meg: Yeah, it \r\nwas hard to see her in so much pain. I'm just glad I was a small part of making \r\nit stop. ",
        "Dusty: Oh, come \r\non, now you're being modest. You made it happen. You made it stop. It was all in \r\nyour hands. ",
        "Meg: Yeah, that \r\nwould be me. You know what? Let's focus on dazzling you, okay? There is a limo \r\nwaiting for us. ",
        "Dusty: We're \r\ntaking a limo to this surprise? ",
        "Meg: Yes, we \r\nare. And I don't want to ruin the whole thing, but we do have very \r\nimpossible-to-get dinner reservations and a penthouse suite 80 floors up, so come on, let's go. ",
        "Dusty: Sounds \r\nlike the perfect, perfect night. It's all perfect to you. ",
        "Meg: You know, \r\nDusty, if you don't like my idea, we can go somewhere else. ",
        "Dusty: How \r\nabout Tampa? ",
        "Meg: What?\r\n",
        "Dusty: Tampa. \r\nFlorida. I went there in October with Jennifer. So did you. The same day. \r\n",

        "Gwen: Are you \r\nsure that you don't want to be alone ever? ",
        "Will: I'm sure.\r\n",
        "Gwen: That \r\ncan't be true. You can tell me, Will. You have to, you have to be honest. \r\nOtherwise, it'll get weird. ",
        "Will: Okay. You \r\nknow what, right now, I don't want you to move one inch. But yeah, sometimes, \r\nonce in a while. Everybody needs their space. Don't you? ",
        "Gwen: Yeah.\r\n",
        "Will: That's \r\nwhat you were worried about? ",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I \r\ndon't know what's normal and what's not. ",
        "Will: And \r\nyou're using me to figure it out? You're in trouble. ",
        "Gwen: How can I \r\nbe freezing my butt off and still be this happy? ",
        "Will: 'Cause \r\nyou're hanging out with the right crowd. ",
        "Gwen: Oh, that \r\nalone time we were talking about? We're going to have to take turns once there's \r\na baby. ",
        "Will: We'll \r\nmanage, like we did before. ",
        "Gwen: Are you \r\nsure? ",
