        "Taylor: Brooke, this is \r\nnot what it looks like. ",
        "Brooke: No, I think it is.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Wait! Don't go!\r\n",

        "[Banging on table]\r\n",
        "Hope: Hit me! ",
        "Nick: Now, I told you \r\nbefore, that adds up to 18, you know. ",
        "Hope: Hit me! ",
        "Nick: If you get a card \r\nover a three, you bust. Don't say I didn't warn you. How do you continue to do \r\nthis? ",
        "Hope: Read 'em and weep.\r\n",
        "Jackie: Happy New Year!\r\n",
        "[Nick hushes Jackie]\r\n",
        "Nick: Bridget's sleeping. \r\nDo you happen to have a roll of pennies? ",
        "[Jackie giggles] \n",
        "Jackie: All out of rolls \r\nof pennies, I'm afraid. Hello, sweetie. ",
        "Hope: Hi. ",
        "Nick: Mother, please, it's \r\nmy hit. I'm going to be a six in a row loser unless I pull this. Again! Again!\r\n",
        "Jackie: Nicky, gambling \r\nwith a child? ",
        "Nick: She's got to learn \r\nsometime. What do you got in the bag there? ",
        "Jackie: Breakfast things. \r\nI know Bridget needs to be off her feet. ",
        "Nick: Oh, thanks. You look \r\nawfully pretty. How have you been doing this evening? ",
        "Jackie: I'm very well, \r\nthank you. I had dinner with Eric and we just decided to call it an early night.\r\n",
        "Nick: I see. Bridget tried \r\nto make it to midnight, but she's sort of conked out. So I guess the real \r\nquestion is, do we let her in the game? ",
        "Hope: How's her credit?\r\n",
        "Nick: She was supposed to \r\nbuy me a pony when I was a little boy and I never got it. ",
        "\r\n******************************************************************",
        "Thorne: Well I'm glad he \r\nreports to you, because he doesn't to me. Happy New Year to you too, dad. \n",
        "Darla: Happy New Year, \r\nEric. ",
        "Thorne: From Darla as \r\nwell. Okay, 'night. ",
        "Darla: So who isn't \r\nreporting to you? As if I couldn't guess. ",
        "Thorne: What must the \r\nParis office think withRridge over there negotiating God knows what in my name?\r\n",
        "Darla: That the president \r\nof Forrester Creations is spending the holidays with his family and sent his \r\nlackey instead. ",
        "Thorne: Yeah, let's try \r\ncalling him my lackey and see where that gets us, honey. ",
        "Darla: It's no worse than \r\n\"dingbat.\" You want to call over there? Demand an explanation? ",
        "Thorne: It's what, nine \r\nhours later there? ",
        "Darla: No, no, no, he's \r\nhome. ",
        "Thorne: No he's not. He's \r\nin Paris. He just called dad. ",
        "Darla: You're kidding me? \r\nPoor Taylor. What is she supposed to do? ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************************",
        "Taylor: Hector stopped by \r\nto wish me a happy new year. ",
        "Brooke: In your bedroom?\r\n",
        "Taylor: He thought Ridge \r\nwas here. We all did. And then I got a phone call from Ridge stating otherwise. \r\nI was upset about that. Understandably, I think. And then I came upstairs and \r\nhector was being a friend. ",
        "Brooke: In your bedroom.\r\n",
        "Taylor: It is not what \r\nyou're thinking. ",
        "Hector: Taylor, you may as \r\nwell tell the truth. ",
        "Taylor: About what? I am. \r\nYou're not helping very much. ",
        "Brooke: So he was hiding \r\nin the bathroom? ",
        "Taylor: Look, obviously we \r\nrealized whatever was going on in here could be misinterpreted. ",
        "Brooke: And your clothes, \r\nwhat, they fell off by accident? ",
        "Taylor: No, no! I was \r\nundressing when he came up. ",
        "Hector: Look, Brooke is \r\nright. Okay, I don't want to hide what's going on here and it makes no sense to \r\ntry. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************************",
        "Nick: Hit me. Easy. \n",
        "[Nick gasps] ",
        "Jackie: Shouldn't you be \r\nin bed? ",
        "Nick: She's had two naps \r\ntoday. Her mother said she could stay up past midnight. ",
        "Jackie: Okay, hit me. I \r\nthink. ",
        "Jackie: Oh! Bust? Does \r\nthat mean that I lose? How do I pay? ",
        "Nick: How do you pay?\r\n",
        "Hope: If you don't got the \r\ndime, don't do the crime. ",
        "[Nick laughs] \n",
        "Jackie: What are you \r\nteaching this child? ",
        "Nick: Whatever it is, I \r\nthink it's sinking in. Come in, come in. Bridget's sleeping. Plus, I was also at \r\nthe bottom of my piggy bank. ",
        "Catherine: All right, \r\nHope, it's time to go. ",
        "Nick: Come here sweetie. \r\nThere you go. How was your party? ",
        "Catherine: It kind of was \r\nover a little early on there. But it was still really nice to be able to go, so \r\nthanks for watching her. ",
        "Nick: Anytime. And I do \r\nmean anytime. There you go, sweetheart. Let's not forget the loot here. Never \r\nleave without the cash. Put your hand out. Hold onto them really tight, okay? Do \r\nyou want to play cards again sometime? You want to? Okay, I promise you those \r\ncards won't move until you get back. Deal? ",
        "Hope: Happy New Year, \r\nUncle Nick. ",
        "Nick: Happy New Year, \r\nsweetie. See you soon, okay? Here, don't forget this. Cutie! ",
        "Catherine: Okay, come on. \r\nBye. Happy New Year. ",
        "Nick: Bye. ",
        "Jackie: Happy New Year. \r\nThat child adores you. ",
        "Nick: I feel like I've let \r\nher down, mother. If you tell an adult \"I love you,\" they can pretty much \r\nsurmise you're either going to get a Christmas card from that person or maybe we \r\nshould shop for houses together. But when you tell a child \"I love you,\" and \r\nthen you're not around them for a while, they think you've changed your mind.\r\n",
        "Jackie: I love the life \r\nthat you're making here with Bridget. And soon you're going to have little \r\nDominick and then your own little daughter. It's everything I've ever wanted for \r\nyou, Nicky. ",
        "Nick: Me too. ",
        "Jackie: You know what, \r\nthough? When I see you with Hope, I can't help thinking that you could have had \r\na really good life with Brooke, too. Is that wrong of me to say? Do you ever \r\nthink of it anymore? ",
        "Nick: I think of it.\r\n",
        "\r\n**********************************************************",
        "Thorne: I can't believe \r\nI'm going to have to call Paris to fish around and find out what my own damn \r\nbrother's doing. ",
        "Darla: You don't think \r\nhe's cheating on Taylor, do you? ",
        "Thorne: What? No. I don't \r\nthink he has any agenda except trying to making me look foolish and replacing me \r\nas company president. ",
        "Darla: I almost wish he \r\nwas. ",
        "Thorne: Well, that's cold.\r\n",
        "Darla: No, no, honey. I \r\nmean, cheating on Taylor. ",
        "Thorne: This is, what, \r\nadvance planning for next New Year\u2019s Eve? ",
        "Darla: She has an admirer, \r\nyou know. ",
        "Thorne: Taylor? \n",
        "Darla: And I like him a \r\nheck of a lot better than your brother, Ridge. So shoot me. ",
        "Thorne: Well, I can but \r\nyou that she doesn't. If she even knows who it is. ",
        "Darla: Oh, she knows who \r\nit is, all right. I think they have a lot more in common than she does with \r\nRidge, too, if you think about it. ",
        "Thorne: Who? ",
        "Darla: Hector and Taylor.\r\n",
        "[Thorne gawks] \n",
        "Thorne: Honey, he's a \r\nfirefighter and she's a glamorous -- ",
        "Darla: Psychiatrist, which \r\nis what she is, not just Ridge Forrester's wife. You know, they both help \r\npeople. ",
        "Thorne: Yeah, he rescues \r\nthem from burning buildings and she prescribes something to calm them down.\r\n",
        "Darla: You don't seem too \r\nshocked, though. ",
        "Thorne: Well, he has been \r\nhanging around her a little bit. I just didn't think anybody else noticed.\r\n",
        "Darla: He's crazy about \r\nher. ",
        "Thorne: He told you that?\r\n",
        "Darla: Uh-huh. \nI think all he needed was \r\njust a little encouragement. ",
        "Thorne: I think it'll be a \r\nlong time before he gets any of that from Taylor. ",
        "Darla: Well, that's what I \r\nthought. That's why I gave him a little encouragement on my own. You think that \r\nwas a mistake? ",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Hector: Ridge is not there \r\nfor you, now or in any of the important ways. If he cared about you the way I do \r\n-- ",
        "Taylor: This is not the \r\ntime, Hector. ",
        "Brooke: So this has been \r\ngoing on for a while? ",
        "Taylor: No! ",
        "Hector: Has Taylor been \r\ntaken for granted before? Time and again. ",
        "Taylor: You are not going \r\nto have this discussion with Brooke. ",
        "Hector: I'm just stating \r\nthe facts. If it's important to you, Ridge isn't there. The press conference, \r\nChristmas. ",
        "Brooke: You think he likes \r\nbeing locked up in a hotel room for the holidays? ",
        "Taylor: You know what, I'm \r\nnot going to stand here and hold a critique about my marriage with the two of \r\nyou. You are misreading the whole situation, Brooke. ",
        "Brooke: When I think of \r\nthe hoops that ridge jumped through for you. He even agreed to go into \r\ncounseling, which I never thought he would do willingly. ",
        "Hector: Look, I am not \r\nashamed of my feelings for you. ",
        "Taylor: Hector, stop this!\r\n",
        "Brooke: Oh my God, you \r\nstand there half-naked with a man other than your husband, who is obviously very \r\nmuch in love with you. ",
        "Hector: I would say the \r\nsame thing to Ridge. ",
        "Taylor: This is a \r\nmisunderstanding, that is all, Brooke! ",
        "Brooke: Well, tell that to \r\nHector. Because my son is waiting downstairs and his father isn't home. And I \r\ncan't believe that you're doing this to Ridge. ",
        "Taylor: Brooke! Brooke!\r\n",
        "\r\n********************************************************************",
        "Thorne: This is my \r\nbrother's marriage we're talking about -- his wife. His kids. ",
        "Darla: Honey, all I said \r\nto Hector was -- well, I guess it was pretty bad. ",
        "Thorne: Darla -- \n",
        "Darla: Honey, I don't want \r\nto ruin our new year's, all right? ",
        "Thorne: If I have work to \r\nlate, or God forbid I have to fly to Paris to undo the damage Ridge is doing -- \r\nwhat, that gives you permission to have an affair? ",
        "Darla: You don't treat me \r\nlike he treats Taylor. ",
        "Thorne: Honey, it is for \r\nTaylor to decide what she's going to put up with and what she's not going to put \r\nup with. ",
        "Darla: Ridge is awful.\r\n",
        "Thorne: To us, yes he is. \r\nHe's obnoxious. He's a jackass. But he loves Taylor, dearly. ",
        "Darla: I'm going to call \r\nHector. ",
        "Thorne: No. ",
        "Darla: No, no, no. I'll \r\njust tell him I took too many allergy pills or something and I wasn't myself.\r\n",
        "Thorne: No, no, no. I \r\nwould just hope that it doesn't get back to Ridge. I mean, Hector seems to be a \r\nnice enough guy, but I do not see Taylor giving him a shot, whatever he does.\r\n",
        "Darla: You know, sometimes \r\nI really hate myself. ",
        "Thorne: Why? ",
        "Darla: You have all this \r\nfaith in Taylor and you probably have nothing left for me. You think that some \r\ntall, dark and handsome guy is going to come around and all we have to do is \r\nhave a disagreement and there you go. ",
        "Thorne: I don't feel that \r\nway, okay? ",
        "Darla: Just because I \r\ndon't think ridge's marriage is sacred, doesn't mean I don't think ours is. We \r\ndidn't get married in intensive care, for one thing. ",
        "Thorne: I should've gotten \r\nyou that chastity belt for Christmas. ",
        "Darla: Stop it. \n",
        "Thorne: No, because sally \r\nwould have helped you pick the lock. ",
        "Darla: I would never, \r\never. There is nobody better than you, Thorne. And even if there is, he wouldn't \r\ndo like you do. You make me a better person, baby. Although, I guess there's \r\nsome room for improvement, huh? ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************************",
        "Hector: You're angry.\r\n",
        "Taylor: This is not the \r\nbest time to discuss this. ",
        "Hector: Is it because of \r\nwhat I said or because I said it to Brooke? ",
        "Taylor: You know the \r\nperson I'm most upset with is myself. I let this whole situation develop. I knew \r\nwhere it was headed. ",
        "Hector: But you did \r\nnothing wrong. ",
        "Taylor: Yes, I may have \r\nsaid all of the right things, but I didn't say them as though I meant them, or \r\nyou wouldn't be here. Hector, you're a wonderful man. You're attractive. You're \r\nexciting. But I am married to a man I love very much. And we have a family.\r\n",
        "Hector: Do you think \r\nBrooke will tell Ridge? ",
        "Taylor: Oh, she's Brooke. \r\nThere's no telling what she'll do. ",
        "Hector: Would it be so \r\nterrible? ",
        "Taylor: Yes, yes, it \r\nwould. Show yourself out. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************",
        "Nick: This is my family \r\nnow, Mother. It's what Bridget and I have hoped for, for a long time. And I love \r\nit. I love feeling the things you're supposed to feel as a father and a husband. \r\nShe's a fantastic girl, you know that. She's witty, sophisticated. She has \r\nbrass. I'm lucky. I'm a very lucky man. ",
        "Jackie: Well, I think so, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Nick: But I know in my \r\nheart that I've been here before. I was here with Brooke and Hope, R.J. and me. \r\nAnd even though we didn't call it a family, I know that that's what it felt like \r\nto hope and I know that's what she feels. She feels the loss of that. That \r\nlittle girl. Sometimes I do, too. I'm not saying -- ",
        "Jackie: No, I know. I \r\nknow, you wouldn't have it any other way. We only get one life. And most of us \r\n-- we don't mourn the lives that we missed, because we never got a taste of \r\nthem. But you did. ",
        "Nick: Was that a blessing \r\nor a curse? For a long time I really didn't know and I just turned my back on \r\nit. But I don't have to do that anymore, because it makes me happy -- to \r\nremember being happy with them. And no one has to know but me. ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************",
        "Taylor: May I come in?\r\n",
        "Brooke: It's late. Did you \r\nthink of something more convincing after I left? ",
        "Taylor: I told you the \r\ntruth. ",
        "Brooke: No, Taylor, you \r\ndidn't. You stood there in your room talking to me while a man was hiding in \r\nyour bathroom and you said words to me that weren't technically untrue, but you \r\nwere lying. You are a liar. Now I'm sure that's a big blow to your ego. Live \r\nwith it. ",
        "Taylor: What do you want \r\nto know? ",
        "Brooke: Nothing. I guess \r\nthe question would be, \"What do you want to know?\" ",
        "Taylor: So you came home \r\nand put R.J. to bed, and then? ",
        "Brooke: Did I call Paris? \r\nNo. But it is morning there and I'm sure Ridge is in the Forrester office. We \r\ncould call now. ",
        "Jackie: I'll just take \r\nthese into the kitchen. Oh, did Hope forget something? ",
        "Taylor: You are not \r\ncalling Ridge. ",
        "Brooke: I'm not? \n",
        "Taylor: No, no, you're not \r\neven going to discuss it. ",
        "Brooke: That would work \r\nout best for you, I'm sure. ",
        "Taylor: You think you have \r\nsomething on me, but you don't. ",
        "Brooke: Then why are you \r\nhere doing damage control? ",
        "Taylor: You think you can \r\nmake something out of this, don't you? That's all that interests you. \n",
        "Brooke: You're going to \r\nlie to Ridge the same way you lied to me. Were you even going to mention it to \r\nhim if I hadn't caught you? ",
        "Taylor: You let me be the \r\none to look after my marriage. ",
        "Brooke: No, it was my \r\nmarriage, Taylor. Until you started looking after it. And you got it back with \r\none lie. Stephanie's fake heart attack. And you're holding onto it with how many \r\nothers? ",
        "Taylor: You really don't \r\nhave any concept, do you, of the bond that Ridge and I really share, do you? You \r\nhave no idea! ",
        "Brooke: No, no. Does \r\nRidge? You seem to be spending most of your time trying to make him more \r\nsuitable for you. But then, of course, you don't have any faults to correct.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Ridge loves me and \r\nhe trusts me, and that trust has not been misplaced. Okay? Ridge and I will be \r\nfine, or not, but you will keep your distance and you will keep what you think \r\nyou know to yourself. "
