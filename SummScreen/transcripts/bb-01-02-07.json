        "Ridge is beyond shocked when Stephanie tells him that Jackie was a prostitute and turned tricks when Nick was small and now he's devastated that Taylor helped him remember this. This is too good to be true. Nick blackmailed them to get the company and now they are in position to do the same. Stephanie hedges; she wants to do this but she doesn't want Taylor to lose her license over it. Nick kisses Taylor and then both proceed to try to minimize the situation as just a transference in patient/doctor type of thing over intimate matters. She states it is nothing romantic or sexual, but not sure Nick believes that. Stephanie calls Taylor just as she reaches home. Taylor tells her that Nick needs more time; he's not quite there yet with selling them back the company. She barely hangs up and is on her way upstairs to Thorne when Jackie barges in railing at her for her ruined relationship with her son, for what Taylor was able to get out of him. Taylor is sympathetic and vows that he is angry and mad now, but he will deal with it in time as he does love her. Jackie states that she has to believe that; he is her whole world.",
        "Stephanie also has a late night visit \u0096 with Nick. She says Taylor has held up her end of the bargain and she is hoping he will too. Slyly he grins when she holds up the sale's contract. He tears it up and throws it in the fireplace and tells \"Toots\" that it ain't gonna happen. It will be one cold day in Hell before he gives her anything. She warns him that was a mistake and he will remember this moment when his world comes crashing down around him, both he and his mother. One parting word, \"nobody gets the better of me, Nick, nobody!\""

        "Stephanie: Are you still here?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Brooke's rounding up the kids. I just wanted to thank you and dad again for having us over.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you're welcome, honey. He's gone to bed.",
        "Ridge: Already?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. He doesn't seem to think he has anything to celebrate.",
        "Ridge: Oh, man. This depression of his is really bad, isn't it?",
        "Stephanie: Well, he's low. What he's concerned about is that he doesn't have any real enthusiasm about starting up a new company. Which is why I hope he won't have to.",
        "Ridge: You said Taylor made some big psychological breakthrough with Nick. It doesn't mean he's going to sell us back the company.",
        "Stephanie: You're too skeptical.",
        "Ridge: I just know the guy can't be trusted.",
        "Stephanie: Well, then trust me. I'm determined we're going to get the company back.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you said that the other day. You place a lot of faith in Taylor's ability to have sessions, you know?",
        "Stephanie: Listen, honey, it's not a fait accompli.",
        "Ridge: Mother, you think there's a better chance of this happening more than the other day, don't you?",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: Why? Something's going on. You know something we don't. What is it?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. Uh -- Jackie was a whore.",
        "[Ridge laughs]",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Stephanie: No, no. No, this is true.",
        "Ridge: Look, I know you don't like the woman.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not saying this to make an insult. It's true. When he was a little boy, she turned tricks. She was a prostitute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Go ahead and slap me if you want. You are engaged.",
        "Taylor: I'm not going to slap you.",
        "Nick: Really?",
        "Taylor: Well, don't get ahead at yourself. Nick, I've been acting as your therapist. This is something called transference. I've been helping you reach some very intimate and very meaningful realizations, and you're feeling grateful. And sometimes, gratitude can feel like an attraction.",
        "Nick: Easy here, Doc. I don't know how much of this I can take.",
        "Taylor: No, I know that I've touched you in a very personal way.",
        "Nick: Well, that's -- that's a little better.",
        "Taylor: But I don't want you to misread my helping you as something romantic, or sexual in any way.",
        "Nick: I think the doctor's protesting too much.",
        "Taylor: No. I -- I don't want you to feel embarrassed or awkward.",
        "Nick: Well, I think you're the one who's feeling awkward.",
        "Taylor: Like I said, this can happen in the course of a therapeutic relationship.",
        "Nick: It's happened before, and there was nothing therapeutic about it. You do remember being on my boat, and you do remember touching me in a very personal way, don't you?",
        "Taylor: That night's a little fuzzy.",
        "Nick: You weren't drunk when I was holding you in my arms and you said when I do that, all your pain goes away. Or is that all fuzzy, too?",
        "Taylor: No, I remember. I remember that very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Jackie is no paragon of virtue, but a prostitute?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. Apparently, Nick remembered all of this during the sessions and I guess he's devastated by the memory.",
        "Ridge: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I know Taylor wants to help us get our company back, but I can't believe that she would breach that doctor/patient confidentiality to tell you something like that.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, no, she didn't. Oh, she didn't. It was -- this was just by accident. I -- I overheard her recording her session notes, and she was talking about, you know, sea captains and some fella named Kramer. That Jackie serviced this man and his friends.",
        "Ridge: Oh, my God!",
        "Stephanie: I know. It's pretty stunning, isn't it?",
        "Ridge: It -- this is beyond stunning, Mother. This is -- this is beautiful. Nick blackmails us to get our company out from under us. And now, we have enough information to get it back.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I -- I admit, I did think about that.",
        "Ridge: You didn't talk about this with dad, did you?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, no. No, and don't -- don't ever let Taylor know that I told you.",
        "Ridge: I won't, I won't. But we are going to use this information.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it's a dilemma. I mean, the patient/doctor confidentiality thing -- I mean, I wouldn't want to place Taylor in a position where she could lose her license. And honey, she's been so good and helped me with my mother. I mean, I don't want to place her in jeopardy. I think the only way to proceed right now is just to believe that he -- he's made the agreement with Taylor and that he's going to honor that agreement, and we're going to get the company back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I won't deny that -- that was a very significant moment for me that night on the boat.",
        "Nick: Significant's good.",
        "Taylor: We were both feeling vulnerable and betrayed. You thought Brooke was being unfaithful with Ridge.",
        "Nick: Not my finest hour.",
        "Taylor: No. Not mine, either. But you're right that -- that night was very special. Something did happen. That was when I realized I had a drinking problem. And if I had paid attention to the fact that I had a problem, then this year might have turned out very differently.",
        "Nick: You don't know that.",
        "Taylor: No, but if I've learned anything from that night, it's that life is full of moments where you can make a good decision, and it can change the entire course of your life. The key is just recognizing when you're in one of them.",
        "Nick: Are we in one of those moments now?",
        "Taylor: You know, Nick, when we first started doing this, I -- I think you promised that if I helped you that you would be willing to give Forrester creations back. And I know you're a man of your word.",
        "Nick: I'm also a businessman. And I used Marone assets to purchase Forrester Creations. Now, if I sell that company back in a few months without showing a profit, the board's going to have a problem with that.",
        "Taylor: I -- I just don't understand why you're going back on our deal.",
        "Nick: It's your deal, not mine. I'm supposed to find peace, and I don't think I'm quite there yet.",
        "Taylor: I know, we have a lot of work to do.",
        "Nick: I think we do.",
        "Taylor: But I'm pretty sure it's after midnight, and Thorne's waiting for me.",
        "Nick: Well, then our time's up.",
        "Taylor: I'll be talking to you soon.",
        "Nick: Wait a minute. Your gift.",
        "Taylor: Thank you. Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: \"Wake me up when you get home. We'll celebrate the new year.\" [Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? Are you at Nick's?",
        "Taylor: No, I'm home.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, how did it go? Did he agree to sell the company?",
        "Taylor: Not yet.",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Stephanie: He said no.",
        "Ridge: I told you the bastard couldn't be trusted.",
        "Stephanie: Um, I don't understand, Taylor. You've kept your part of the agreement.",
        "Taylor: No, Stephanie, what I told him was I'd help him find peace, and then he would realize he wouldn't want Forrester anymore. That's what I told him. And he's not there yet.",
        "Stephanie: Do you think he's stalling?",
        "Taylor: He needs time, just like you needed when you confronted your mother, all right? He's a man of integrity. He's going to keep his word. Now, listen, I just got home. It's new year's, and Thorne is waiting for me upstairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I think he's playing a cat and mouse game with her.",
        "Ridge: What you got there?",
        "Stephanie: Transfer papers. You know, she was so confident that I just went ahead and had them drawn up.",
        "Ridge: Good idea.",
        "Stephanie: I'm going to go over and see him. I know it's -- I know it's very late, but he's got to hold up his end of the deal.",
        "Ridge: Mother, be careful how you, um -- just be careful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Jackie: Who do you think you are?! How dare you?! Didn't you take an oath, \"do no harm\"?!",
        "Taylor: Happy New Year. Jackie, I understand you're very upset.",
        "Jackie: Yes, I am upset! You said you were going to help my son!",
        "Taylor: I am helping him.",
        "Jackie: Oh! By opening old wounds, ripping open his heart?",
        "Taylor: Therapy usually leads to places that need to heal.",
        "Jackie: You said he'd be happy. You said he'd find peace!",
        "Taylor: He'll find peace when he's dealt with those issues.",
        "Jackie: He was fine!",
        "Taylor: He wasn't.",
        "Jackie: We were fine! We had a wonderful relationship -- the only relationship that he could ever count on. And now -- now, he can't even look at me.",
        "Taylor: I'm so sorry. I know this must be very painful, for both of you.",
        "Jackie: I'm his mother, Taylor. Everything I've ever done was for him. And now, because of you, he's never going to see me the same way again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Stephanie: Happy New Year, Nick. I thought we might talk.",
        "Nick: About what?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, the New Year, new beginnings.",
        "Nick: Oh, yes. I heard about your reconciliation with your mother. It surprised me. I always thought you were from a pack of wolves.",
        "Stephanie: I was. She adopted me. But let me get to the point. It's my understanding that you made an agreement with Taylor, that she would help you, psychologically, and in return, help you to also understand that taking the company from us was a mistake, you'd sell it back to us. I understand that she's held her part of the bargain up. I'm hoping you will, too.",
        "Nick: She's told you about our sessions?",
        "Stephanie: No, of course she hasn't. She's a professional. She's a woman of integrity -- as you are a man of integrity. At least, I've always believed that you were honest, like your father. I hope you don't take after your mother in that regard.",
        "Nick: Leave my mother out of this.",
        "Stephanie: I would. Actually, I'd like to. But I believe you are the one that dragged her into this debacle, using her accident to take the company away from us.",
        "Nick: It might be a debacle for your family, but it worked out pretty nicely for mine.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, has it?",
        "Nick: Haven't you seen the trades? We're putting out our first line soon.",
        "Stephanie: You know, actually, I'm hoping that a lot of people won't get to see that first line.",
        "Nick: Well, why wouldn't they?",
        "Stephanie: Because I'm hoping that when the sun rises in the east in the morning, the company will be ours again. This is a sales contract. I'd like you to sign it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: I warned him. I said dredging up the past won't make you happy.",
        "Taylor: Jackie, are you okay? Do you want something for your head?",
        "Jackie: I'm all right. It's Nicky that's not all right. It's our relationship that's not all right.",
        "Taylor: But now you can -- you can rebuild your relationship on honesty.",
        "Jackie: You don't understand! He hates me!",
        "Taylor: He doesn't.",
        "Jackie: I make him sick!",
        "Taylor: What you did disturbs him, and in time, maybe --",
        "Jackie: Maybe?",
        "Taylor: Look, I know that he loves you. If he didn't, this wouldn't have upset him so much. All his life, he's revered you.",
        "Jackie: He couldn't wait to get away from me. I am the reason that he went off to sea.",
        "Taylor: And he always comes back. And he will this time. You just have to give him a little bit of time to deal with this.",
        "Jackie: Well, how am I supposed to deal with it, Taylor? You know, I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with it. I was the one person that he could always count on. Now, he's lost Brooke, he's lost his children, he's lost his mother. My little boy is alone.",
        "Taylor: He isn't a little boy anymore.",
        "Jackie: He is to me, and he always will be. Everything I did -- everything was to protect him, to make sure that everything was okay. I mean, there was no work, there was no money. I just wanted him to be all right, not to worry. Oh, God, I didn't want him to know.",
        "Taylor: You did what you felt you had to. Look, we've all made mistakes. We've made choices that we wish we could go back and change, especially the ones that -- that affect our children. But you've got to take it from me firsthand. You know, even the worst cases, they're forgivable.",
        "Jackie: I don't know what I'd do if I didn't believe that. He's my whole world, Taylor. He's all I have left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Have you got some attorney locked in your attic that you just feed a little gruel to, and he whips up these contracts for you?",
        "Stephanie: I wish I did. Here's my proposal. We'll buy back the company for the price that you paid for it, plus any monies that you've spent. And that way, you won't lose a dime.",
        "[Nick laughs]",
        "Nick: Well, I won't make one, either.",
        "Stephanie: No, but you were never going to, Nick. You don't know anything about the fashion industry.",
        "Nick: I'm learning.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, come on! Sign the papers. Save yourself -- your whole family a lot of humiliation. You made a deal.",
        "Nick: Not with you I didn't.",
        "Stephanie: No, but you're a Marone. Your word's your bond.",
        "Nick: This deal, was it by any chance your idea?",
        "Stephanie: No. No, it wasn't. Actually, I was rather appalled when Taylor first mentioned it. Because of what you did to my family, I didn't want her anywhere near you. But she's her own woman. She thought she could help you. She felt obligated to do that. And she has, hasn't she?",
        "Nick: So she has mentioned me to you?",
        "Stephanie: No. She's just led me to believe that she's fulfilled her end of the deal.",
        "Nick: Well, obviously, she said I didn't fulfill mine. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.",
        "Stephanie: But you've had your epiphany, haven't you?",
        "Nick: But I haven't found the peace I was promised, because my mother's in pain every day and takes pills for it and may never be the same.",
        "Stephanie: Perhaps your mother was never the woman you thought she was.",
        "Nick: Don't bring her into this, and don't insult her.",
        "Stephanie: Sign it, and I won't ever again.",
        "Nick: Look at you. You're so close to getting what you want, you're practically salivating. Just one flick of my pen, and you are the Forrester family hero again, aren't ya? Your two boys heading to the altar, and that pathetic husband of yours right behind his desk, where you like him. Stephanie, mother of the year. Well, you keep dreaming, toots, 'cause it ain't happenin'. It'll be one cold day in hell before I ever give you anything.",
        "Stephanie: That was a mistake. Remember this moment, when your world comes crashing down around you -- you and your mother. Because that day is coming sooner rather than later. Nobody gets the better of me, Nick -- nobody."
