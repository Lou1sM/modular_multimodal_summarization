        "Liam tells Steffy that he can't believe her grandfather told her to move out on Liam. They know there is more to it than that, so she can tell him she is not leaving. He cannot dictate her love life. Quinn limps home and Eric greets his lovely wife but says she is not herself, so what happened. Brooke kisses Ridge and feels that his hair is damp. He says he took a steam. She wonders if it was alone. He says it was a spur of the moment thing. She says he could have included her so do not forget that next time. Eric says they have not been married that long but he can read her pretty well. Something is not fine and he wonders if Ridge is giving her a hard time. Has he found a new way to get to her? Liam tells Steffy this is ridiculous considering the long list of scandals all the Forrester's have had. And this is not a scandal, just two people who love each other and want to be together. She is getting a divorce so it is not like she is cheating on Wyatt. Brooke notices that Ridge is using one of Quinn's necklaces with his drawing of one of his gowns. She thinks it will take more than that to get Quinn on his good side. He says he has other tricks up his sleeve too, nothing that he wants to share with her now. Whatever it takes he has to get her out of their lives. Quinn tells Eric that his son is putty or something like that in her hands. Eric says Wyatt is perfect for his granddaughter whereas Liam certainly isn't. He's unreliable while Wyatt is a stand up guy that does what he says he is going to do and that is the man he wants to support. Steffy says she has not made her decision yet but maybe this is the right thing to do temporarily. Liam laments that Quinn has already worked her hammering away on Eric and now she is working on Steffy, surely she sees that.",
        "Eric comments to Quinn that he told Steffy what to do and he will call to see if she is going to do that. He wants to put Liam on the speaker phone. Basically he tells Liam that he wants Steffy to move out right away and not disrespect her marriage. He hangs up and Liam goes ballistic that this is not right. Eric does not have that right, and it is not even him. It is all words that came from Quinn. Steffy says she has always had mixed feelings from the beginning. She is still married yet living with another man and it doesn't feel right. She kisses him and says she is sorry but she will be back before he knows it .and never doubt how much she loves him. He looks defeated so pretty sure he is not believing it. He calls Ridge right away and says Steffy moved out. Ridge tells him about Quinn being in the steam room and for the good of the company she has got to go. He calls Quinn at home. She takes the message and replies okay. Eric tells her that he will take a quick shower and be right back. She lies down in bed but panics when she suddenly remembers Ridge touching her leg in the steam room."

        "Liam: I can't believe your grandfather is interfering in our relationship like this.",
        "Steffy: He doesn't see it that way. And you shouldn't, either.",
        "Liam: Steffy, he told you to move out of here.",
        "Steffy: Until the divorce is over. He doesn't think it's appropriate, especially now that I'm C.E.O. of Forrester.",
        "Liam: You and I both know there's more to it than that.",
        "Steffy: Liam. I love you. I want a life with you.",
        "Liam: All right, okay. So s-stay, then. Tell me you're not leaving me.",
        "Ridge: You were hurt. I wanted to help you. I don't know why you think I'm up to something.",
        "Quinn: I don't want you to flirt with me. I'm married to your father.",
        "Eric: There's my lovely wife.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: I was just about to call you and see what was taking you so long.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Hmm. What?",
        "Eric: You're not yourself. What's wrong? Did something happen?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Brooke: R.J. is watching Lizzy, and he already read her two bedtime stories and she hasn't drifted off. So I texted him, \"sing her a song,\" and he texted back, \"I don't do lullabies.\"",
        "Ridge: Well, our son's very resourceful. I think he'll figure it out.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Takes after his daddy.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Brooke: Takes after his dad's good looks, too. Hmm. Your hair.",
        "Ridge: What about it?",
        "Brooke: It's damp.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I took a steam.",
        "Brooke: Alone, or with somebody I know?",
        "Ridge: It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.",
        "Brooke: All the more reason you should have asked me to join you. You know how I love things that are...spontaneous.",
        "Ridge: Is that what they're calling it these days?",
        "Brooke: Well, call it what you want. Just don't forget to include me next time.",
        "Ridge: I will not forget.",
        "Brooke: So how was it?",
        "Ridge: How was what?",
        "Brooke: The steam.",
        "Ridge: Oh, uh... it had its moments.",
        "Brooke: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: And now I'm behind, so...",
        "Brooke: Yeah, you do have a lot of work to do.",
        "Ridge: My daughter runs a tight ship around here. That's the thing.",
        "Brooke: Is Steffy still around? Is Quinn?",
        "Ridge: You're asking me if I've seen Quinn?",
        "Brooke: Have you?",
        "Quinn: Why would you think that?",
        "Eric: Well, you're my wife. And although we haven't been married that long -- I admit that -- I can still read you pretty well.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you can?",
        "Eric: Uh-huh.",
        "Quinn: Huh? All right. Well, what am I thinking now?",
        "Eric: After you tell me what happened in the office today. Now come on. You went in this morning, even though you should have stayed home and taken care of this sore ankle of yours.",
        "Quinn: My ankle is fine, sweetheart.",
        "Eric: Well, something else is not fine. What's going on? Ridge giving you a hard time?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I told you. He, uh --",
        "Eric: I know. I know. You told me. He took care of you and he iced your ankle and everything, but is he -- what is he doing? Is he back to his old ways? Or did he find a new way to get to you?",
        "Steffy: I hate putting you through this.",
        "Liam: It's not you. It's your grandfather and Quinn putting me through this. You know she's behind all this. I mean, she's hellbent on getting you back with Wyatt and she's using your grandfather to do it.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather doesn't feel like he's being used, and he's definitely not pressuring me.",
        "Liam: Well, but he is pressuring you.",
        "Steffy: He believes he's looking out for me. He wants what's best for me personally and my new role as C.E.O. He wants me to succeed.",
        "Liam: I-I want you to succeed, Steffy, but this isn't the 19th century! I mean, you're -- you're getting a divorce from Wyatt. You're not cheating on him. Nobody would stand in judgment of that.",
        "Steffy: That's -- that's not my grandfather's point. What he's concerned about is that --",
        "Liam: Is -- is appearance. I know. I know. And that is awfully strange considering the very long history of public scandals the Forrester family has gone through. Don't you think? And this is -- god, this isn't even a scandal! This is two people who love each other, who got ripped apart by a crazy, malicious woman who found their way back together finally, and who now stand a chance at getting ripped apart again by the same woman! We can't let her keep doing this to us.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: What do you think?",
        "Brooke: Ohhh. I like. Wait a minute. Is that one of Quinn's necklaces?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. It goes well with the dress, doesn't it?",
        "Brooke: You're actually complimenting Quinn?",
        "Ridge: I'm -- I'm just using a different tact, try to throw her off balance.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I think it's gonna take more than nice words to get her out of your father's life and out of this company.",
        "Ridge: I've got a few things up my sleeve.",
        "Brooke: Do I dare ask?",
        "Ridge: No, you don't want to know.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. You know, I've always believed in you, ridge. But your own daughter was appointed C.E.O. By Eric and Quinn, and I don't think -- in fact, I'm pretty sure -- they're not gonna reverse themselves.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's the thing about life, isn't it? Turn a corner, you never know what you're gonna find.",
        "Quinn: You have nothing to worry about. Your eldest son is putty in my hands.",
        "Eric: Putty, eh?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Maybe not putty, but it's gonna be okay.",
        "Eric: Good. You know what else is gonna be okay? Steffy and Wyatt's marriage, or at least I hope it is.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] So do I. Even though they're working together every day, she's still going home to Liam every night.",
        "Eric: I talked to her about that today. I told her how inappropriate I think it is that she's shacking up with her husband's brother even while she's still married to Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: You talked to Steffy about that?",
        "Eric: Yeah, I did. Look, Wyatt -- Wyatt is perfect for my granddaughter. He admires her, he respects who she is, her talent and her skill and her future. Liam says he does, but he doesn't. When I think of his history with her and the heartache that he's caused, he's unreliable. But Wyatt -- Wyatt's a stand- up guy.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Eric: He does what he says he's gonna do. That's the kind of man and marriage that I can support.",
        "Quinn: You are the dearest, dearest man. I don't deserve you.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: So you already decided, huh? Your grandfather really got to you.",
        "Steffy: [Blows air] I haven't decided anything. Look, I got to be honest, okay? I-I've been feeling guilty about this. I'm living in this house while I'm still married. It's why I didn't move in here initially.",
        "Liam: I know. You were -- you were trying to be sensitive to Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and that was right...at the time.",
        "Steffy: Well, maybe this is the right thing. Maybe my grandfather is right.",
        "Liam: None of this is right. Quinn is still pulling the strings. She knows she can't get through to you directly, so she's using your grandfather. And if you actually move out --",
        "Steffy: It's only temporary, Liam. Once the divorce is final, I'll be right --",
        "Liam: Once the divorce is final, what? Like we're gonna get our life back? You think things are really just gonna go back to exactly the way they were before you moved out? Why would you think that if Quinn is working overtime to break us up so you can be with Wyatt? She's already brainwashed your grandfather, and now she's trying to work her magic on you by -- by using the C.E.O. Position to drive a wedge between us.",
        "Steffy: I won't let that happen.",
        "Liam: It's happening. It's happening now. The fact that you're considering it, that means it's working, and Quinn is just gonna keep hammering and hammering away and poking and prodding until -- what? -- Until the divorce doesn't happen. I mean, you see that, right?",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Brooke: No one understands your frustration with Quinn better than I do. But last time you went up against her --",
        "Ridge: It didn't work out so well, did it?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Maybe you should just let her self-destruct. Oh, I know, I know. That'd probably take a long time.",
        "Ridge: Or not. Depending how it plays out.",
        "Brooke: What? What are you up to, ridge?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You know I'm gonna protect this company and this family, whatever it takes. I've got to do this, Brooke. Whatever it takes, I got to get her out of our lives.",
        "Quinn: I know Steffy respects you. And I know you respect her.",
        "Eric: She's grown into a wonderful woman, hasn't she? She's gracious, she's talented, she's loyal.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, she's loyal to the family and she's loyal to the company. But is she loyal to her marriage?",
        "Eric: I gave my granddaughter a lot to think about. I hope I got through to her. In fact, let's find out. [Dialing] Steffy, it's your granddad.",
        "Steffy: Hey, Granddad.",
        "Eric: I asked something of you, sweetheart.",
        "Liam: Is that Eric?",
        "Eric: I hear Liam. Put me on speakerphone.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Eric: Liam, Steffy, look, I know you're both good people, and I know you both understand that it's wrong that you're living together while you're still married to Wyatt, Steffy.",
        "Eric: Now, when this divorce is final, the two of you can do whatever you want. But until then, I want you to respect Wyatt and respect the institution of marriage. I want you to move out of there right away, Steffy. Do you understand? Do you understand, Liam?",
        "Liam: Eric, listen, Quinn is manipulating you, okay? Don't let her --",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Liam: Hello? Come on! Why does this -- why does this keep happening?! You and I -- [Sighs deeply] You and I love each other!",
        "Steffy: I know.",
        "Liam: All we want -- all we want is to live the life that Quinn stole from us, that she's still trying to steal from us! This is sick! And for your grandfather to go along with it, I'm sorry, I know -- I know. I know how important he is in your life, but he has no right to keep making demands like this. You're separated from my brother! This is not a casual fling! We're in love, we're committed, we're planning a future together! What more do you want?!",
        "Steffy: I know -- I know! I know! I hate this as much as you do! But I can't just ignore my granddad! I promised that I was always gonna respect and listen to his opinions.",
        "Liam: Listening is fine. Listening is fine. But it's not Eric doing the talking, Steffy. Every word out of his mouth, Quinn put that word in his mouth.",
        "Steffy: Okay, even if that's true -- even if that's true, it doesn't mean my grandfather doesn't have a point. Come on. I'm a married woman, and I'm living with a man who's not my husband, and that is something that I have had mixed feelings about from the very beginning. You know, the only thing that's really changed is that I'm not living here. And the moment the divorce is final, I'm gonna come right back to you, and we're gonna pick up right where we left off. Hey, hey, hey. That's my promise to you. Okay? That's my promise. [Sighs] I'll have someone get my things. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. Never doubt how much I love you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: [Sobs]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Liam, what's up?",
        "Liam: Hey, well, Steffy just moved out.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Liam: Yep. Quinn and your dad playing on her emotions, using her position as C.E.O.",
        "Ridge: How?",
        "Liam: They guilt-tripped her into staying elsewhere until the divorce is final. And then bless their hearts, she gets to come back afterwards. But this is -- this is all Quinn. I mean, we got to do something about this, like, now.",
        "Ridge: I'm already on it.",
        "Liam: Okay, what does that mean? The whole cat-and-mouse thing with Quinn?",
        "Ridge: I was in the steam room with her earlier.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Uh, and?",
        "Ridge: It's coming along.",
        "Liam: Well...okay. But do you think something is actually gonna happen or...?",
        "Ridge: Gonna make sure it does.",
        "Liam: Even if it means betraying your father?",
        "Ridge: If that's what it takes to finally open his eyes, yes.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, what happens if Quinn sees through what you're trying to do and the whole thing just backfires?",
        "Ridge: Can't. There's too much at stake.",
        "Liam: Yeah, all right, but Quinn is -- is determined to get Steffy back with Wyatt, and -- and she's using Eric as a mouthpiece.",
        "Ridge: When I'm done with Quinn, Eric's gonna want to have nothing to do with her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he might want nothing to do with you, either.",
        "Ridge: Well, I have to risk that. Do this for everyone. Do it for the company. That woman has to go. [Sighs]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Eric: Everything all right?",
        "Quinn: Everything is fine... now that you're here.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Eric: I'm gonna take a quick shower. Be right back. I'm a little tired.",
        "Quinn: Aww. Not too tired, I hope. [Chuckles] I don't want you to touch me. I don't want you to pretend to care about me. You don't get to play with my emotions."
