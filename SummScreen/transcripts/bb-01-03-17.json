{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7491 ~ Quinn struggles with remaining emotionally loyal to Eric as her feelings for Ridge intensify; Liam assures Wyatt that he will not let go of Steffy without a fight."], "Recap": ["Quinn tells Wyatt that Eric threw him a lifeline so accept it. He says she finally found a true good guy. She says he better not waste this chance if he wants to reconcile with Steffy. Liam grouses to Steffy that she does not have to do this. Eric is just listening to the whispering of Quinn in his ear. Steffy says she is not being manipulated and they will be together as soon as the divorce is final. Quinn thinks of Ridge in the steam room but Wyatt's words in her ears that she has finally found a good man. Steffy calls Carter and tells him to do what he has to do to speed up her divorce. She needs it done now. Liam barges in on Wyatt and tells him whatever he has planned it won't work. Wyatt tells him he seems pretty tense for someone who is supposedly so happy. Wyatt says Steffy made her choice because she knew it was wrong. His tattoo ring is fading but it has not gone away completely just like his marriage hasn't. He says excuse him he has some where to be while Liam keeps saying this is only temporary and that Steffy is staying with him. Ridge makes sure he is right by Quinn's side and wants to collaborate. She asks what he is doing and he replies that he only wants to help the company. She is suspicious but he says now is the time to change his mind that she can be good for the business. He takes her hand in his and runs it across a dress model. She reminds him that he texted they should keep their distance.", "Katie interrupts and says she is sorry. She had not heard any screaming in the hallway so thought he was alone. Ridge says they were working on some jewelry with his dresses but they are completely done. Wyatt follows Steffy to her new digs at Thomas's loft. He says he does not blame Liam for being upset even if it is only temporary. He tells her there is always his beach house. She could move back in with her husband. She tells him she needs him to understand this complicated situation and she believes she will stay here. He offers to help her unpack but she says she will do it by herself. He reminds her that he is here if she needs him. Liam charges in on Ridge and says they have to finish this. Steffy has moved back to the loft .at least it is not in with Wyatt. Ridge says he has not given up. He knows what he is doing and Quinn is falling for him. Katie tells Quinn that it is really inspiring that Eric loves her so much. She tells her she saw Eric the other night and she wanted that out and above board that Quinn has no reason to be jealous. And she thinks it is sweet that she is so committed to Eric. She says sometimes that is the way it is. You know someone and suddenly it just hits you that they are different than you expected. Eric has finally found that in her. Ridge tells Liam that nothing else has worked but not Quinn is playing with fire and she will get caught. Liam warns him that if Quinn gets caught so will he. Ridge says that is their best bet. He says he is not going to sleep with Quinn, but he will put her in a compromising position. His whole family thinks he is selfish and it is somewhat true as he will do anything for the company. He will do this; he will bring Quinn to her knees. Quinn keeps having these flashes of Ridge and his hands on her. She clutches her heart."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Wyatt: Mom, Eric did not have to put his foot down for me.", "Quinn: Steffy is still your wife.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but not for long.", "Quinn: What kind of an attitude is that? Eric threw you a lifeline. Until the divorce is final, he doesn't want Steffy living with Liam.", "Wyatt: And she agreed? She moved out?", "Quinn: Eric insisted.", "Wyatt: Wow. You know what this means, right? You finally did it. You finally found a truly good guy.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: You'd better not screw it up.", "Quinn: Well, you'd better not waste this chance. If you want to reconcile with Steffy, this is it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You don't have to do this. Eric can't tell you who you get to live with.", "Steffy: My granddad has a point, though.", "Liam: No, he -- no, he doesn't, Steffy. He's got Quinn whispering in his ear. That's what he has. That's what this is. It's another manipulation. She's just trying to get you to go back to Wyatt.", "Steffy: Liam... you know I had reservations about moving in with you. I'm not a free woman. [Sighs] I'm still married to Wyatt.", "Liam: Even though you said you belong with me?", "Steffy: Wait. I do. And we will once the divorce is final. Quinn's not coming between us. That's not what this is about. I'm not being manipulated by her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Ridge: Okay. I'll be positive. I positively hate you. But your designs aren't bad.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: You finally did it. You finally found a truly good guy. You'd better not screw it up.", "Ridge: That's an interesting look. Now, wouldn't it be funny... if we were thinking about exactly the same thing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: There has to be a way to speed this up, carter! Talk to a judge! I'll stipulate to whatever I have to. I just need the divorce to be done.", "[Knock on door]", "Steffy: [Sighs] Look, I have to go. Get back to me as soon as you can. Oh, God. [Sighs]", "Nicole: Hey.", "Steffy: Hey. Hey. Uh...come on in.", "Nicole: Need help unpacking?", "Steffy: Oh, no. It's -- it's just temporary. This is my grandfather's idea. He doesn't want me living with Liam while I'm still married to Wyatt, and, honestly, I can't disagree, so...", "Nicole: So... how's Liam taking it? I can't imagine he's happy about this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You're not getting away with this.", "Wyatt: Hey, there, bro.", "Liam: Listen. Listen to me. Whatever she has planned, whatever she has planned, it's not gonna work.", "Wyatt: I'm sorry. What are we talking about?", "Liam: What do you mean, what are we -- your mother is trying to hand Steffy to you on a silver platter again, and I'm just here to say it's not happening.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I seriously doubt you know what I'm thinking, Ridge.", "Ridge: You're not thinking about the design that you're holding in your hand.", "Quinn: Maybe I'm considering some changes.", "Ridge: Really?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm.", "Ridge: Good... 'cause I had them send up a sample to see if we mesh.", "Quinn: You want to collaborate?", "Ridge: We'll see if there's anything there.", "Quinn: What are you doing?", "Ridge: I'm your chief designer. I'm doing what's best for the company.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Oh, I get it. Steffy moved out, and you're angry, but you can't take it out on her grandfather, so what do you do? You come here and blow up at me.", "Liam: Wyatt, this is not Eric. He's just the messenger. This is what Quinn wants. She put this in his head. Quinn thinks that if Steffy moves in to her brother's loft, then, all of a sudden, you're gonna have a chance to get Steffy back.", "Wyatt: Hold on. Steffy's staying at the loft now?", "Liam: Until the divorce is final, yeah, and then she moves right back home with me.", "Wyatt: Are you so sure? 'Cause you seem pretty tense for a guy who's got nothing to worry about.", "Liam: Yeah, Wyatt. Yeah, I am tense, because your mom's up to her old tricks again.", "Wyatt: My mother is happy. She is more secure than I have ever seen her before. Her life is -- her life is perfect.", "Liam: Exactly! Her life is perfect, and she's still not satisfied. She's not gonna stop until your life is perfect, too.", "Wyatt: Excuse me. Steffy chose to move out on you because she knew what she was doing was wrong.", "Liam: Oh, my God, Wyatt. We had every right to pick up right where left off.", "Wyatt: And that didn't even bother you, did it -- living with her while she's still married to me?", "Liam: Not really, 'cause it's a technicality.", "Wyatt: Not to Eric and certainly not to me. Marriage vows actually mean something to him, just like family, loyalty, and I appreciate everything Eric has done for me.", "Liam: Oh, yeah, I bet you do.", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I'm not getting that from my own father, am I?! 'Cause everybody knows that you're the favorite child, okay? When am I gonna get a call from him, huh? Probably soon. \"Hey, you need to respect your brother's relationship with Steffy.\" All the while, she still has my wedding ring tattooed on her finger! And, yeah, it's faint. It's faint. I know that. But it is still there, just like my marriage is. And I know you -- you want to ignore that fact, but it has not completely disappeared yet.", "Liam: I am not the one ignoring reality, Wyatt. You are, because this is not going to work. Yeah, Quinn's gonna flex her muscle and Eric's gonna make his point, but Steffy is gonna stay loyal to me, and she's not gonna be manipulated by Quinn.", "Wyatt: I know you don't want to believe this, but my mother has much, much, much more important things to do, and, frankly, so do I, so if you'll excuse me, I got somewhere to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I'll come to the office as soon as I get settled.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Steffy, you have two Spencer men fighting over you. Nothing in your life is gonna be settled for a while.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: What do you think? What do you think?", "Quinn: You can't guess? I thought you were good at that.", "Ridge: Artist to artist. Be honest with me.", "Quinn: You really want to know?", "Ridge: Mm-hmm.", "Quinn: [Scoffs] You never respected my opinion before. You've always said I don't know anything about this business.", "Ridge: Well, here's your chance to change my mind. Come on. You know it works. Tell me why.", "Quinn: Well... it has a liquid quality -- the fall of the gown, the curve of the metal.", "Ridge: Come here. You got to touch the fabric. Feel that? It's soft, and it's warm. It's almost fluid. And your jewelry -- it's like water running down her neck.", "Quinn: It works. Mm-hmm.", "Ridge: No changes?", "Quinn: Mnh-mnh, no. No changes.", "Ridge: Good. That wasn't so hard, was it?", "Quinn: No, it wasn't. I always thought that we could work well together. It's just -- it's just too bad.", "Ridge: What's too bad?", "Quinn: The timing. I got your text last night. You want us to keep our distance.", "Ridge: You disagree?", "Quinn: No. You're right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Katie: Oh! Hi!", "Ridge: Hey, Katie.", "Katie: I didn't realize the two of you were in here. I didn't hear any yelling or screaming in the hall. What's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "[Knock on door]", "Wyatt: Heard you got a new pad.", "Steffy: Temporary. Don't buy me a housewarming gift. Come in.", "Wyatt: Darn it.", "Steffy: You did?", "Wyatt: Actually, yeah... like all this. No?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Quinn and I were, you know -- we were working.", "Katie: Together?", "Quinn: Uh, yeah. We were discussing a design and jewelry -- design with jewelry. What can I do for you, Katie? If you're looking for Brooke --", "Katie: No, no, no. Actually, I-I was looking for you, Quinn. If you're too busy, though, I can come back.", "Ridge: No. Quinn and I are done. We're completely done with each other. Okay. Thanks, Katie.", "Katie: Yeah. See you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I mean, I just -- I love what you've done with the place.", "Steffy: I just got here, and I don't plan on staying.", "Wyatt: Yeah, that's what Liam said.", "Steffy: You talked to him?", "Wyatt: He paid me a visit at work.", "Steffy: [Sighs] I'm sorry.", "Wyatt: I don't blame him for being upset that you moved out. I kind of know the feeling.", "Steffy: Believe me, I don't feel great about it, either. My grandfather insisted.", "Wyatt: Yeah, I heard that, too.", "Steffy: Liam isn't happy with him.", "Wyatt: Liam's not happy with anybody -- with my mother, with me. I mean, how could you ever leave a positive, upbeat guy like that?", "Steffy: I didn't leave him.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but you're not living together anymore.", "Steffy: Yeah, for the time being.", "Wyatt: Short-term, it's not a bad setup -- the art galleries everywhere and the coffeehouse down the street. But it's not your only option, you know. I mean...you know I'm living up at the estate, but I-I still have my beach house.", "Steffy: Are you offering me your beach house?", "Wyatt: Well, I'm just... suggesting maybe you... move back in with your husband.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: This has to stop.", "Ridge: What did Quinn do now?", "Liam: It's not even Quinn. It's Wyatt. He sees her moving out as an opportunity to get her back, which is exactly what Quinn wants.", "Ridge: I told you I'm on it.", "Liam: Yeah, I know, but in the meantime, Steffy's moving in to the loft.", "Ridge: But she's not moving in with Wyatt.", "Liam: No. She's not gonna do that no matter what Eric promises her.", "Ridge: Eric, huh? Never was a man more easily swayed.", "Liam: Well, he sure does everything Quinn says. She's got him brainwashed. Now she's using him to manipulate Steffy. We have to -- we got to do something, Ridge, 'cause she's not letting up.", "Ridge: I'm not letting up, either. I just saw her. She's on the hook.", "Liam: Is she still flirting?", "Ridge: I told her not to.", "Liam: What?", "Ridge: I sent her a text last night, saying we couldn't do this anymore.", "Liam: Why would you --", "Ridge: Hey, calm down. I know what I'm doing. She's falling for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Everything okay?", "Quinn: Fine. Why do you ask?", "Katie: Oh, yeah. I just felt like I kind of walked in on something. It was kind of tense in here.", "Quinn: Oh. No. Well, Ridge was actually being, uh, mildly charming. Don't ask me why.", "Katie: Ah. Well, maybe he's warming up to you.", "Quinn: Uh, yeah. You wanted to see me about something?", "Katie: Yes. Uh, Eric. I just wanted you to know that I went over to see him the other day, at his request, and I just want to be completely transparent about our friendship.", "Quinn: Thank you for telling me.", "Katie: Sure. You know, it's -- it's... really inspiring to see how much he loves you.", "Quinn: He's an extraordinary person.", "Katie: Yeah, he is. And he feels the same way about you. So there's no reason to feel jealous or insecure.", "Quinn: I'm not that kind of woman. All those feelings, all that chaos -- I don't want that in my life anymore. I have Eric.", "Katie: Good. Good. It's nice to see that you two bring out the best in each other. I mean, I can see how committed Eric is to you, and I can see how committed you are to him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I think I'll stay here, thanks.", "Wyatt: Right. You don't want Thomas' plants to get lonely.", "Steffy: I'm honoring my grandfather's wishes, as tough as it is.", "Wyatt: Yeah. He appreciates that, and so do I.", "Steffy: Wyatt, this situation is complicated enough. I need you to understand why I'm doing this. It's temporary. My relationship with Liam hasn't changed, so please don't read in to it.", "Wyatt: You're the one overanalyzing this, not me.", "Steffy: You knew I moved out, and you came here to see me.", "Wyatt: To give you a hand, to -- to make sure that you're all right.", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: I had this horrible image of you lugging these oversized, overstuffed pieces of luggage up to the loft, and I was worried for you.", "Steffy: I didn't -- I didn't bring that much stuff.", "Wyatt: That's it? Good! That's good. It's better for your back and for mine.", "Steffy: [Scoffs]", "Wyatt: So, what do you need me to do, huh? What do you need?", "Steffy: Uh, I just -- I think I should do this myself.", "Wyatt: All right. Uh... look, I know -- I know that you're under a lot of pressure... from your family and from \"lie-am.\" But I'm not here to make things worse. I'm just... I'm here.", "Steffy: Thank you.", "Wyatt: Yeah. My pleasure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: You are very lucky to have found a man like Eric.", "Quinn: Well, Eric doesn't agree. He thinks he's the lucky one.", "Katie: You two have something very special.", "Quinn: It's something neither one of us ever expected.", "Katie: Well, that's how it happens sometimes, right? I mean, when you least expect it, it just hits you. Someone you've known for so long -- you suddenly see them in a completely different light.", "Quinn: I-I never thought I had a chance with a man like Eric.", "Katie: And now you're his wife. You're the person that he can truly rely on. I mean, he is so open about how much he loves you and trusts you, and... loyalty's very important to Eric, and now he's finally found that with you.", "Quinn: He has.", "Katie: I hope so.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You really think this is the best plan?", "Ridge: Nothing else has worked. We've found her weakness.", "Liam: Just that Quinn is attracted to you.", "Ridge: Quinn likes playing with fire. The more dangerous, the better.", "Liam: And that's why -- that's why you're pulling back?", "Ridge: Pulling back and see if she follows. If dad sees that, the relationship is over.", "Liam: Okay, but, Ridge, if she gets caught, you get caught.", "Ridge: It's our best chance -- maybe our only chance.", "Liam: Okay, but --", "Ridge: My father put this menace into our lives, and it's up to me to get her out.", "Liam: No matter the cost? Listen. Listen, Ridge. I-I'm all for playing dirty. I mean, everything -- everything Quinn's done to Steffy and me -- she deserves whatever she gets. But the question is, how far -- how far are you really willing to take this? Quinn's into you. Okay, fine. What are you gon-- you're not gonna sleep with her.", "Ridge: No, I'm not gonna sleep with her. I'm gonna put her in a compromising position.", "Liam: Yeah, but --", "Ridge: And what do you think -- my dad's not gonna listen? No. You know what? Here's the thing -- I took Brooke away from him. If he sees me with his wife --", "Liam: Yeah, but he won't forgive you. You could lose him.", "Ridge: He's not mine to lose. He's hers. You know what's funny, Liam? Every member of my family -- every single member -- thinks that I'm selfish and power-hungry. That's why I want to be C.E.O. of this company. That's only partly true. I want to run this place because I care about it. I don't want to see it fall apart. And everything we've tried so far has failed. It's only made her stronger. It's a Hail Mary pass, man. Got to do it. Bring her to her knees.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I can see how committed Eric is to you, and I can see how committed you are to him."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJb_u7qdCI0"}
