        "[Brooke remembering]\r\n",
        "Nick: I picked that up on \r\nthe coast of Cameroon. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's pretty.\r\n",
        "Nick: To what do I owe?\r\n",
        "Brooke: I came here to ask \r\nyour advice. ",
        "Nick: Really? You sure you \r\nwant my advice? ",
        "Brooke: I'm just not sure \r\nwho to go to. Not about this. ",
        "Nick: Okay. I'm all ears.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I found something \r\nout about Taylor. ",
        "Nick: Taylor? ",
        "Brooke: Yes. And I'm not \r\nsure if I should go to Ridge with it. ",
        "Nick: Unless -- depends on \r\nwhat it is. ",
        "Brooke: On New Year\u2019s Eve, \r\nI walked in on Taylor kissing Hector. ",
        "",
        "Stephanie: Believe me, I \r\nknow how much you wanted him home with you for the holidays. ",
        "Taylor: Well, I didn't \r\nconsider it too much to ask. ",
        "Stephanie: He's on his way \r\nnow, though, isn't he? And you, as usual, have been so patient and faithful. How \r\nmany other wives would've been mad as hell, and wanted to have punished their \r\nhusbands? ",
        "Taylor: I was mad as hell.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: You have no \r\nidea what a relief it is to me, that he's married to someone as mature as you. \r\nSomeone that he can love and trust so completely. ",
        "Taylor: Stop it, \r\nStephanie. I don't deserve your praise. Not anymore. ",
        "",
        "Thorne: Megan's promotion \r\nwas well-deserved. But with the way things are going around here -- if I don't \r\nfill that position, I'm going to be in trouble. ",
        "Darla: Don't worry, honey, \r\nyou'll find someone. ",
        "Sally: Hello, troops. I \r\ngot your message to come by. Listen, if this is about me squatting at your house \r\n-- ",
        "Darla: Sally, don't you be \r\nsilly. We love having you there. No, I called you because we need your help. I'm \r\ngoing to see if the applicants are here. ",
        "Sally: Applicants? \r\n",
        "Thorne: Well, Megan has \r\nbeen promoted. And I'm about to interview the final candidates for the executive \r\nassistant position. And Sally, I need your help. ",
        "Sally: Well, \r\nunfortunately, my decision-making abilities have been far from sterling lately.\r\n",
        "Thorne: You're a pro. And \r\nyou know what to look for in a good assistant. And this is a very, very \r\nimportant position. I need someone who is business savvy. Someone with people \r\nskills. And someone who can cover my back when all the -- ",
        "Sally: Well, I will admit \r\nthat things have gotten a bit messy around here, what with queen Stephanie on \r\nthe warpath, and the drastic change of direction she has in mind for the \r\ncompany. ",
        "Thorne: So you'll help me?\r\n",
        "Sally: Why not? Why not? \r\nIt will brighten my day, seeing all of those precious wannabes left wanting.\r\n",
        "Thorne: Good, thank you, \r\nSally. Thank you. ",
        "Darla: Our first candidate \r\nis here. This is Miss Chrissy Sinclair. ",
        "Thorne: All right. Thank \r\nyou for coming. ",
        "Chrissy: Hello. \r\n",
        "Thorne: Hi. ",
        "Chrissy: I was under the \r\nimpression we'd be alone. ",
        "Thorne: This is Sally \r\nSpectra. You should feel privileged to be in the same room with her, actually. \r\nWhy don't we get started? ",
        "Chrissy: Sounds good to \r\nme. ",
        "Chrissy: I'm not at all \r\nafraid of long hours. I think work should be fun for everybody. And I promise, \r\nI'll work with you as closely as humanly possible. Just give me a chance, and \r\nI'll show you exactly what I'm willing to do for Forrester Creations. \r\n",
        "Thorne: Well, I think we \r\nmay have found something. ",
        "Sally: Yeah -- the \r\nHimalayas. Honey, I think we've heard enough, seen enough. So why don't you put \r\nyour jacket back on, and hit the door, hmm? ",
        "Thorne: Well, we'll let \r\nyou know. ",
        "Chrissy: Well, thank you \r\nfor your time, anyway. ",
        "Sally: You know something, \r\nThorne, I can read people, and that young woman says \"double trouble\" with a \r\ncouple of double D\u2019s. ",
        "Thorne: So it's a pass?\r\n",
        "Sally: It's a bomb. \r\n",
        "",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, I am \r\nnot a saint, and quite frankly, I am tired of being called that. I've made \r\nmistakes. I've been quick to judge. And this marriage of Ridge and I is not this \r\nperfect little picture of happiness that you've painted it out to be. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: What marriage \r\nis perfect, honey? The important thing is, you trust and respect one another, \r\nand there's great integrity in the relationship. ",
        "Taylor: I have something \r\nto tell you, Stephanie. I was angry. I was angry that Ridge couldn't be bothered \r\nto come home on the holidays to spend it with his wife and his children. He had \r\nthe company jet, he could've flown here, and then he could've turned around and \r\ngone right back. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, yes, he \r\ncould have, but honey, you know he missed you and the kids. ",
        "Taylor: No, but I told him \r\nthat I wanted to spend new year's eve with him. I told him that, but he wouldn't \r\nrespect that. I'm not a priority. ",
        "Stephanie: What are you \r\ngetting upset about now for? ",
        "Taylor: Because I am upset \r\nthat I am never his priority. ",
        "Stephanie: What's going on \r\nhere? ",
        "Taylor: I'm lonely. I'm \r\nlonely, Stephanie. Believe it or not, I need my husband with me. ",
        "Stephanie: And he will be.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Maybe it's too \r\nlate. ",
        "Stephanie: Too late?\r\n",
        "Taylor: On New Year\u2019s Eve, \r\nI didn't spend it alone. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: I saw Hector's \r\nbadge there, then it dawned on me why Taylor was acting so strange. ",
        "Nick: And that's when you \r\nwent back upstairs? ",
        "Brooke: That's when I saw \r\nthem kissing. ",
        "Nick: Can't say I saw that \r\ncoming. ",
        "Brooke: You should've seen \r\nthe look on her face. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, I can imagine.\r\n",
        "Brooke: She claimed it was \r\ninnocent, that hector was just comforting her. ",
        "Nick: Oh, come on, Brooke. \r\nShe let the guy in the house, she knew what he was there for. ",
        "Brooke: St. Taylor, \r\nturning down a man in need? I don't think so. ",
        "Nick: And stop with the \r\n\"saint.\" I never bought that. If she was really a saint, she would've respected \r\nyour marriage with Ridge. ",
        "Brooke: And now that I \r\nknow what she's capable of, it makes me wonder what she's done. Other things \r\nthat she's done that we haven't found out about, Nick. Other men she's been \r\nwith. For her whole life, she's been on a pedestal, and Stephanie hasn't missed \r\nan opportunity to point out all of my flaws, and compare me to her. Taylor, the \r\nwoman who can't do any wrong. ",
        "Nick: So you're \r\nvindicated. How's it feel? ",
        "Brooke: I don't know why I \r\ncare. I don't even know why I allowed the comparison, but I did. ",
        "Nick: Brooke, now, come \r\non. You know, we're people. Human beings. Things affect us, even though we wish \r\nthey didn't. ",
        "Brooke: Sometimes I \r\nquestion the things that I've done. The mistakes that I've made. Maybe I do \r\ndeserve -- ",
        "Nick: Stop it! Now just \r\nstop it right there. Now listen to me. You are the finest person I know. \r\n",
        "Brooke: I can't believe \r\nshe would do this to ridge. She always talking about trust and fidelity. Such \r\nhypocrisy. Well, now the tables have turned. I've waited all my life to be in \r\nthis position. ",
        "Nick: Okay, so you're in \r\nthis position. And you wonder, what you're going to do about it. ",
        "",
        "Thorne: That's seven \r\napplicants, seven bombs. ",
        "Darla: Who would've \r\nthought the job pool would be so shallow? ",
        "Sally: Honey, if it were \r\nany more shallow, there wouldn't be a pool at all. ",
        "Darla: I'll go get the \r\nnext applicant. ",
        "Thorne: Okay. I need \r\nsomeone with experience, not just a pretty face that can make coffee. I mean, \r\nthat person has to exist. ",
        "Sally: Now this possibly \r\nmight be the one, Thorne. Studied at the Polimola and the Instituto Marangoni.\r\n",
        "Thorne: Robert, thanks for \r\ncoming. This is Sally Spectra, and you've met Darla. Why don't you have a seat \r\nhere, please? Your resume is very impressive -- Italy, some time in France. We \r\nare looking for someone who is assertive. Someone who's not afraid to be heard \r\nor to let their ideas or their input be known. Think you're up for that? \r\n",
        "Robert: I'm your man.\r\n",
        "Sally: Excuse me? Are you \r\nall right? Do you want a glass of water? ",
        "[Mumbling] ",
        "Robert: I'm fine. \r\n",
        "Thorne: Why don't you tell \r\nus about yourself? ",
        "[Mumbling] ",
        "Robert: Fashion has always \r\nbeen a love of mine. Since I was a boy in Seattle, I've always dreamt of being \r\nin design. The trip to Italy was an incredible experience for me. The history. \r\nThe culture. But I'm glad to be back in the United States. And I'd love to have \r\nan opportunity to work for such a prestigious company as Forrester Creations.\r\n",
        "",
        "Brooke: Stephanie talking \r\nabout Taylor's refinement. Her dignity. Calling me trash from the gutter. Slut \r\nof the valley. Always saying that I should be ashamed, that Taylor would never \r\nneed a man to feel good about herself. ",
        "Nick: Well, we all know \r\nStephanie's pretty good at those putdowns. ",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, Taylor \r\nand Stephanie -- they destroyed my marriage. They took it away. They robbed the \r\nchildren, the children that I raised as my own. They robbed R.J. of a father. \r\nAnd I begged her to respect the family that I had with Ridge. But she didn't \r\ncare. She wanted her life back, regardless of the pain and suffering that it \r\nwould cause all of us. She got it. You would think that after destroying our \r\nmarriage, she would respect Ridge. But no, little miss perfect, miss St. Taylor \r\n-- the one who could never find herself in a bad situation -- is cheating on \r\nRidge. She's skated through life, Nick, the little angel, above all of us. But \r\none word to Ridge, and I could have her life crashing down around her. Isn't it \r\ntime that she's held accountable, like the rest of us? Isn't it? ",
        "",
        "Stephanie: Who did you \r\nspend New Year's Eve with? ",
        "Taylor: Hector. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: Oh. ",
        "Taylor: I didn't invite \r\nhim, he just showed up to wish me happy new year. He thought Ridge would be \r\nhere, too, and then when Ridge called and said that he wasn't going to make it \r\nback home, he heard that. ",
        "Stephanie: And he stayed?\r\n",
        "Taylor: Not for long.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: But longer than \r\nhe should have. ",
        "Taylor: Yes. ",
        "Stephanie: What happened?\r\n",
        "Taylor: Well, I knew it \r\nwas a bad idea for him to be here, so I asked him to leave, and I thought he \r\nhad. I went upstairs to go to bed, and I guess he decided that he didn't want to \r\nleave me here. He said that he didn't want to leave me feeling lonely. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: And? \r\n",
        "Taylor: Well, I went \r\nupstairs to bed, and I thought he had left. I was feeling very vulnerable. I \r\nkissed him, Stephanie. I know, you're very upset with me. I know how angry you \r\nare and disillusioned, I'm not perfect. If I were Brooke, you would've already \r\nslapped me, so go ahead, come on, let me have it. ",
        "",
        "Raymond: I believe in \r\ndignity, respectability, class -- words that have longed to be restored to the \r\nworld of high fashion. And I believe I can bring those words back to Forrester \r\nCreations. ",
        "Thorne: Thank you, \r\nRaymond. We'll be in touch. ",
        "Raymond: Well, I have some \r\nwonderful ideas for your spring line that would be ready just in time. I'll wait \r\nfor your call. ",
        "Thorne: Okay, thank you. \r\nHow hard can this be? Somebody, please, tell me. I don't need tattoos, I don't \r\nneed piercing, I don't need breasts in my face or whispers. I need somebody \r\ngood. I need somebody great. Somebody who knows this business inside and out -- \r\nsomebody that I can count on when the going gets tough. ",
        "Sally: You know, I never \r\nthought I'd hear myself say this, Thorne, but it is a distinct possibility that \r\nsuch a person does not exist. ",
        "Thorne: Oh, I think she \r\ndoes. ",
        "Sally: All right, where is \r\nshe? ",
        "Thorne: I'm looking at \r\nher. Sally, I could interview a thousand more applicants, and not one of them \r\ncould come close to your abilities. Sally, I need your help. ",
        "Sally: Thorne, I'm very \r\nflattered. I really am. But I had just about decided that my days in the rag \r\ntrade are over. I think what you are looking for is a nice, streamlined ship, \r\nand I'm nothing but a broken down old battle axe. Now you need someone that \r\nknows how to inspire. Somebody who's brimming with ideas, somebody with panache.\r\n",
        "Thorne: You're exactly \r\nright, Sally. And that's you. Sally, I need your brains, okay? I need your \r\ninstincts. I need your grit. I mean, with the way things are going around here, \r\nyou're going to be my greatest asset. Sally, please, take the job -- for me.\r\n",
        "",
        "Stephanie: Hector kissing \r\nyou doesn't mean a thing. You were angry, and upset, and vulnerable. Forget the \r\nwhole thing. ",
        "Taylor: We can't. Someone \r\nwalked in and saw us kissing. ",
        "Stephanie: Not one of the \r\nchildren? ",
        "Taylor: Brooke. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: Oh, she will \r\nhold it over your head. ",
        "Taylor: Don't worry about \r\nBrooke, because I am telling Ridge everything that happened. ",
        "Stephanie: You're right. \r\nYou're absolutely right. The fact that she saw you -- the only way to deal with \r\nthis is just to deal with it directly, head on. ",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, I've \r\nbeen up all night, thinking about my marriage to Ridge and how we've been in \r\ntrouble ever since I got back. And I keep asking myself, why? Why is this \r\nhappening? Why isn't this working? Why aren't we connecting? And then it hit me. \r\nIt's because a marriage cannot survive without total honesty. ",
        "Stephanie: Well -- \r\n",
        "Taylor: No, no. Ridge and \r\nI need to be completely honest. Stephanie, there's a secret that I've been \r\nkeeping. It's about an indiscretion from my past. And I wrote a letter about it \r\nonce to Ridge to tell him about it, but he didn't see the letter, and we never \r\ntalked about it. But it's time that he knows the truth. ",
        "Stephanie: No, I do not \r\nwant you to tell Ridge. Look, I know what this is about. I know you slept with \r\nJames. But this is so insignificant now, after all the years that have passed. I \r\ndo not want you to tell your husband. If you do, you'll lose him. I don't want \r\nthat to happen.",
        "",
        "Nick: Brooke, I agree that \r\nTaylor should be held accountable for what she's done. But I think the real \r\nquestion you should be asking yourself is, why do you care? Do you think \r\ninterfering with her marriage is going to change what happened to you? Do you \r\neven want it to? ",
        "Brooke: If I'd stayed \r\nmarried to Ridge, I never would've discovered the feelings that I had for you. \r\nBut you and I will never have a life together, Nick. And I would never give that \r\nup -- as brief as it was -- for anything. But you and I both decided that your \r\nfuture is with Bridget. And I have to think about my future, too. Because I have \r\na son with Ridge, and he thinks about his father every single day. ",
        "Nick: What the hell are \r\nyou talking about? What are you saying? That you want a life with Ridge again?\r\n"
