        "Thorne laments to Taylor that he hopes Nick sells them back the company soon. He knows Ridge and his mother are up to something and it's not going to be pretty. Nick is still coolish toward Jackie and just wants to concentrate on working. The headaches, she says, she can deal with, but it's the heartache. She begs that they need to talk. Taylor interrupts and wants to work in a family session before she goes out of town. She states that he turned out alright, it's time to put this behind them. It's the past, find a way to forgive his mother. Jackie did the best she could do at the time. When you put a person on a pedestal, the only place they have to go is down. With much hesitation, he tells his mother that she was like royalty to him. He can never forget what she did or condone it, but he realizes she did it for him. And that she is the woman she is now. He tells her that he loves her and has already forgiven her, they hug. George, a Marone board member, chastises Nick for mixing oil and high heels and warns him that he'd better make good on that fashion show tomorrow. Ridge and Stephanie greet Captain Kramer and fill him in on their plans, a tribute to Jackie and they feel his presence would be greatly appreciated. He's stunned that she would still be thinking of him and he starts spilling the beans. Stephanie beams that this connection could be monumental. Then Thorne finds out, but is shocked that his mother would use this information to her advantage. He reminds them what this could do to Taylor. Still Stephanie is adamant. Jackie was a whore and she is going to tell the world tomorrow. The Marone Board will be begging to sell. She knows Taylor is caught in the middle, but that's just the way it is. Tomorrow the fashion show and they will expose Jackie and hopefully get the company back for their dad."

        "Ridge: Jacqueline and Dominic Marone proudly announce the launch of Forrester Creations' cruise wear line -- I think I'm going to throw up.",
        "Stephanie: Read this bottom piece.",
        "Ridge: Forrester Creations is now a subsidiary of Marone Industries. That's supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Stephanie: No, but my point is this, Massimo ran a very well respected company. A very conservative company. And I'm betting, that board of directors is conservative. I mean, this is a high risk venture that nick's gotten them into. A big scandal -- I mean, that's not going to be in their business model.",
        "Ridge: Jackie's old friend, Captain Kramer. I'll bet he's scandal personified.",
        "Stephanie: Let's hope he's the one that can sink any idea of success for the two of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Hi. You can't bear to be in the same room with me. I know that. But I wouldn't be here if tomorrow wasn't the premiere of our first line.",
        "Nick: Let's just stick to the work, shall we?",
        "Jackie: What I did was wrong. And I know that it's had an incredible impact on your life, but Nicky, you've got to believe me, that whatever I did with those men, it never took away from my incredible, adoring love for you.",
        "Clarke: All right, here he is. Come on, ladies. Let's go meet the captain. Classy, elegant, refined, but alluring.",
        "Nick: Just what I'd hoped for.",
        "Clarke: Jackie, what do you think?",
        "Jackie: They're lovely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: How does next month sound?",
        "Taylor: Perfect.",
        "Thorne: Yeah? You know, it's usually busy this time of the year, but we don't need the pressure to put a line out.",
        "Taylor: That's really hard for you, huh?",
        "Thorne: I'm more worried about my dad, you know? You saw him New Year's Eve. You know, mother has this major breakthrough, and he's just --",
        "Taylor: He's slipping into a depression.",
        "Thorne: You see it, too?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I wish I hadn't.",
        "Thorne: You know, life's about forgiveness, Taylor. But what Nick did -- taking advantage of my dad's love for my mother? I mean, that's evil. And it was blackmail.",
        "Taylor: Sweetie, I think you need to understand that, in Nick's mind, he was defending his mother.",
        "Thorne: You don't buy that.",
        "Taylor: Listen, we need to let him deal with these issues and work through them, or nothing's going to change.",
        "Thorne: And if he does, he'll sell us back the company?",
        "Taylor: That's the logic behind it.",
        "Thorne: Well, he better do it soon, 'cause I'm telling you, we're all going crazy. Especially mom and Ridge. If we don't get that company back, they're going to do something. And it's not going to be pretty.",
        "Ridge: It's a risk using Jackie's past as a prostitute for leverage here.",
        "Stephanie: Well, Jackie knows all about leverage, doesn't she? I am concerned about the risk regarding Taylor, her career and my friendship with her.",
        "Ridge: Mother, we have to do this.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I know. I know. The moment they blackmailed us to get the company, as far as I'm concerned, all the rules went out the window. It's our time. We're going to show the world exactly what Jackie really is.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Stephanie: Hello?",
        "Captain Kramer: Stephanie Forrester?",
        "Stephanie: Yes.",
        "Captain Kramer: Hi, I'm Jerry Kramer.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please, come in. And thank you for coming all the way up. This is my son, Ridge Forrester. Captain Kramer.",
        "Ridge: Mr. Kramer.",
        "Captain Kramer: How do you do? How do you do? Is somebody going to tell me what this is all about?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, of course. Well, as I said to you on the phone yesterday, it's sort of a surprise party for your oldest and perhaps closest friend, Jacqueline Payne.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Let's face it, honey. You did your best. Everybody knows that. But nick has not lived up to his part of the bargain.",
        "Taylor: Listen, he's been dealing with some very difficult issues. It's a lot more difficult than any of us could have ever known. But the most important thing is, he's taking the first step. The rest of it takes time. It takes time to heal.",
        "Thorne: Well, all I know is that my father is suffering.",
        "Taylor: Unfortunately, the situation is still in nick's hands. You've got to trust me. Trust me.",
        "Thorne: Okay, I'll try.",
        "Taylor: And don't forget, I won't be home tonight. I'll be in Santa Barbara.",
        "Thorne: Oh, yeah, the conference.",
        "Taylor: And before I go, I'm going to stop by and see nick. And hopefully, he's had some time to deal with his past and he's ready to accept it and move on. That's our only chance of getting Forrester creations back, okay?",
        "Thorne: Okay.",
        "Taylor: Don't give up hope.",
        "Thorne: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Thank you, ladies. I appreciate your time. What do you think, George?",
        "George: It's a different world around here, I'll tell you that.",
        "Nick: Well, it's all a part of Marone industries now.",
        "George: It takes more than pretty women in fancy dresses to keep our stockholders happy.",
        "Jackie: You received the invitation for tomorrow's show?",
        "George: Yes, ma'am. Vijay and Suzanne will be coming, too. Other board members.",
        "Jackie: Well, we'll welcome their support.",
        "George: They're more open-minded than I am, nick. But they're skeptical about using Marone assets to acquire a fashion company.",
        "Jackie: Oh, no, they're going to love it.",
        "George: We have to be accountable to our shareholders, Ms. Marone. I'm not so sure that high heels and oil mix.",
        "Jackie: I think you'll find that high heels, if properly worn, mix with just about anything.",
        "George: A pending divorce to Brooke Logan, the vendetta against the Forresters, I gather that your reasons for acquiring this company were personal.",
        "Nick: Oh, come on, George. As volatile as the oil business is today, Forrester Creations offers us diversification. Profit.",
        "George: Even without the Forresters?",
        "Nick: Especially without the Forresters.",
        "George: You're the CEO. Whatever happens, good or bad, falls on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Captain Kramer: So, you're a friend of Jackie's?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, we have a long history.",
        "Captain Kramer: What exactly did she tell you?",
        "Stephanie: Just that the two of you were very close.",
        "Captain Kramer: It was a long time ago.",
        "Stephanie: But she hasn't forgotten. Have you?",
        "Captain Kramer: No.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't think so.",
        "Ridge: Captain, your name has come up a lot lately.",
        "Captain Kramer: Really?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I think the closeness that you and Jackie shared, is something that she cherishes. And I can understand why. I bet you were a very good looking young man. That's what she remembers.",
        "Captain Kramer: Well, how do I fit in here?",
        "Stephanie: Well, Jackie's had a significant, significant impact on my family this past year, and I want to repay her.",
        "Captain Kramer: How?",
        "Stephanie: A tribute. I'd like the world to see and understand, and come to know exactly the kind of person that Jackie is. And I think your presence would be greatly appreciated. Would you be willing to participate? Not been shown",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Nick, you put your mother on a pedestal. And that's a very precarious place to put someone, because the only place they can go is down. We're all fragile. We're all flawed. If you can't accept that, then, what happened in your mother's past will destroy your relationship. Don't let that happen.",
        "Nick: You are like royalty to me. Beautiful and sophisticated -- I'll never be able to accept the things that you did. But I realize now that you did them for me. As far as I'm concerned, that woman is gone forever. The woman who stands here now -- this is the woman I grew up loving. There was never a day that went by that there wasn't a hug for me, a word of encouragement. You made me believe in myself. You're my mother. Still beautiful, still elegant. I love you, and I always will.",
        "Jackie: Can you ever forgive me?",
        "Nick: I already have, Mother. I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Do you two even realize that you're using confidential information that Taylor obtained from a patient without her knowing it? She is never going to forgive you two. Not to mention that this could destroy her career.",
        "Stephanie: Wait a minute! She didn't officially act as his psychiatrist. She handled this more as a friend.",
        "Thorne: How can you say that?",
        "Ridge: Thorne, Taylor never met nick in her office. It was always at Forrester Creations or that stinky boat of his. You know, she didn't even bill the guy.",
        "Thorne: It was still therapy, Ridge!",
        "Stephanie: He didn't take it seriously as therapy.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'll tell you one thing. Taylor sure as hell won't see it that way --",
        "Stephanie: I'm doing this for your father.",
        "Thorne: I understand that, Mother, but what about Taylor?",
        "Stephanie: Well, she's going to be upset.",
        "Thorne: Upset?",
        "Stephanie: Okay, she's going to be as mad as hell. I know that! I'm doing this for your father. He built this company with his bare hands. And he needs this company to go on with his life! If we make a public scandal, I think it will embarrass the board of Marone industries and they'll be forced to sell it to us. Jackie was a whore! I'm going to tell the world that tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Mother, what happened in Seattle, with Kramer, these other men -- I don't want to speak of it again.",
        "Jackie: You have my word, Nicky. Our terrible secret. Never to be spoken of again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I know Taylor's caught in the middle. I wish she wasn't, but that's just the way it is. Thorne, please.",
        "Thorne: Look, I know dad needs his company back, Mother, as well as anyone. And Taylor knows that, too. But for heaven's sake --",
        "Stephanie: Listen, she will come to understand this.",
        "Thorne: That son of a bitch stole our company, didn't he? And he stole our dad's life.",
        "Ridge: That's right. So, are you with us?",
        "Thorne: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Are you sure?",
        "Thorne: Yeah, I'm positive.",
        "Stephanie: Good. Good. So, tomorrow, at the fashion show, we'll expose Jackie and hopefully, we'll get the company back for your father."
