        "Liam frantically calls 911 when he finds Ivy at the bottom of the stairs and looks up at Steffy who is calling her name. As the paramedics come, Liam turns to Steffy and says, \"again?\" Quinn tells Wyatt that no one expected him to be in work today. She says Ivy will hate herself when she realizes what she has thrown way. Quinn says she regrets that they have spent the last few years surrounded by people who do not commit themselves, all except Steffy. Wyatt says this whole sour grapes thing is not for him. He wanted to marry Ivy so he'd like Quinn to stop attacking her. Steffy begs Liam to listen to her. He says no, maybe it is cosmic coincidence but every time they are in the same room, this violence just follows her around. She cries that this is not her fault. He says sure, but he is done with all these situations she finds herself in when he told her she is not supposed to be near Ivy. Pam tells Wyatt that he is needed; Ivy is in the hospital again. Liam is allowed to stay in the room at the hospital when the Doctor checks Ivy out. He says she is very lucky. He does not see any fractures but she might have a mild concussion that will not show up on CAT scan so he'd like her to remain motionless and be careful.",
        "Ivy tells Liam that she really can't stay in L.A. now as it is lowering her life expectancy. Liam says Steffy said she did not push Ivy and he believes that but he doesn't know if that even matter any more. Liam asks Ivy why wasn't his brother enough for her. She says she can not explain Thomas, she still loves Liam. He tells her the two of them are not going to be a couple and he is not confused about that. Wyatt and Quinn walk in and want to know what happened. Ivy quickly says she had packed and was leaving and she fell down the stairs. Steffy was there, but it was an accident. Ivy thanks Wyatt for coming. Liam tries to explain that he did not believe Ivy when she said she loved him so he did not call Wyatt. He and Steffy are happy and he assumed Wyatt and Ivy were until she left. He tells Quinn that he does not believe it was attempted murder. Steffy admits it is not her job to defend Wyatt yet time after time there she is trying to do so. Quinn thinks that is great that Steffy is defending him. Steffy finally gets word that Ivy will be released today. Quinn laments that Wyatt and Steffy have a lot in common and maybe she needs a friend right now. Liam sounded pretty fed up with her. She probably feels misunderstood and Wyatt should go to her. Ivy will be just fine. She doesn't even deserve his concern, Steffy does. She stuck up for him. Maybe this is the way this whole thing was supposed to turn out. Steffy twists her engagement ring and the last thing she thinks about is Liam saying he is done."

        "Ivy: You want me gone, Steffy? I'm gone, okay? You don't have to worry about me anymore.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] Ivy! No! [Breathing heavily]",
        "Liam: Ivy! Can you hear me? Ivy? Uh, yeah. Hi. I need an ambulance. My name is Liam Spencer. A woman fell down a flight of stairs. 100 South Haragate. Um...uh...she's not conscious, but, uh, she's breathing. Don't touch her. No, not that I can see without moving her. No. I didn't see it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Nobody expects you to be at work today.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I wasn't gonna sit at home and stare at that ring all day.",
        "Quinn: Well, you want to go somewhere? Are you hungry? I could take you to eat.",
        "Wyatt: No. I mean, I thought I did everything the right way this time.",
        "Quinn: Nobody blames you for anything.",
        "Wyatt: No, but I didn't do the things I did with Hope. I didn't pressure her. I didn't try and outdo the competition, even though there was competition, apparently, that I didn't even know about.",
        "Quinn: You know, it's better that you find out now instead of after you married the girl.",
        "Wyatt: So, what are you saying -- that I should be grateful? Is that it?",
        "Quinn: No, but I could be.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, she stood there and lied to my face.",
        "Quinn: Yes. She did.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And now that I think about it, she probably did it a lot more, too.",
        "Quinn: You know... I'm not a big believer that virtue is always rewarded and evil is always punished. Ivy is going to feel this, and it's gonna hurt because it's a loss. I mean, she threw away something that she could never replace. Are you okay?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I just -- sometimes I get this idea that I'm not the main character in my own life.",
        "Quinn: I know you didn't feel that way when it was just the two of us.",
        "Wyatt: Well, no. As much as I complained about being your one and only focus, looking back on it, I think it's kind of a rare gift. Yeah. I don't regret finding out that I'm a Spencer. Trust me -- that's awesome. It's just finding out that I was the least magnetic Spencer --",
        "Quinn: Stop. Stop it, stop it, stop it! I can't stand hearing you talk badly about yourself. Stop.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not talking badly about myself. It's just this -- this list of things that you're deluded about in this world -- it's a very long list, and I'm not one of them. I think of myself as awesome as you think that I am -- maybe even more. It's just -- just my effect on other people is what I don't understand.",
        "Quinn: You want to know what I regret?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: That we have spent the last few years of our lives being surrounded by people who aren't committed to anything. \"I'm gonna be an editor. No, I'm gonna be a vice president. I'm gonna marry an Australian. No, I'm gonna get an annulment.\"",
        "Wyatt: They're not all like that, Mom.",
        "Quinn: Mmm. Mmm.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy's not like that.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] That...is true.",

        "EMT: BP back to 160/88. HR's 62. Contusions to the left shoulder, hip, and ribs. No visible fractures. Slow pupil response. Possible mild TBI. How long has she been unconscious?",
        "Liam: Since I called. 10 minutes?",
        "EMT: Sir, is this your wife?",
        "Liam: No, she's not.",
        "EMT: Unless you're family, you're gonna need to get your own ride.",
        "Liam: Oh. Okay. Where?",
        "EMT: University Hospital.",
        "Liam: Again, Steffy?",
        "[Siren wailing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Do you think she had, like, a mental breakdown or something? She's not the same sweet, dimwitted Ivy that she was when we first met her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Mom...",
        "Quinn: Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: ...This whole sour-grapes thing's not working for me, all right? I wanted to marry her. I thought we could both be happy together. So don't go telling me that you think she was a head case. That's what people said about you when you did something that they didn't like.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Now, I have done my share of regrettable badness, but I have never broken anyone's heart.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Can you just stop talking, please? Like, every time you attack her, I feel like I have to defend her. It's this sick reflex that I have.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well... maybe... it's not her fault that everything unraveled.",
        "Wyatt: How do you figure that?",
        "Quinn: Well, you know... culture shock. Yeah! She's so far away from home, and she was taught to be so ladylike.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. So, how ladylike is it of her to jump into a big, overheated flirtation with a guy she was raised to think of as her cousin?",
        "Quinn: There! That's it! That's the fire in your belly! You got to keep that right there. Just keep it! Don't let that go.",
        "Pam: Wyatt, Wyatt, um, Ivy needs you.",
        "Wyatt: No, Pam, she doesn't.",
        "Pam: No. She's in the hospital.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Again?!",
        "Pam: Yeah. They just called here looking for Eric, and so I asked if I could speak with her instead, and they said she's not conscious.",

        "Steffy: Hey, hey, I'm coming with you.",
        "Liam: No, you are not.",
        "Steffy: Liam, I --",
        "Liam: You are not supposed to go anywhere near her. How many times do you have to relearn that?",
        "Steffy: No, no! I-I didn't touch her! I didn't!",
        "Liam: I don't care! I don't care if it's a cosmic coincidence that every time you and Ivy are in the same room, she ends up in the hospital!",
        "Steffy: We weren't even close to each other!",
        "Liam: Oh, really? Why were you here in the first place? 'Cause we had a whole conversation about this, Steffy. You were supposed to stay away.",
        "Steffy: Oh, okay. It's so convenient for you just for me to stay away and tell her that you're in love with her, right?",
        "Liam: Oh, give me a break. She's moving to Australia. You couldn't rein it in for once in your life and actually let her?",
        "Steffy: [Crying] This wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault, Liam.",
        "Liam: You tell me -- you tell me why this violence just follows you around.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. I don't know. But this isn't my fault.",
        "Liam: It's not your fault? Of course, it's not your fault. It's never your fault. It's always somebody who made you do it. I am so done with your excuses.",
        "Steffy: I swear to you, Liam!",
        "Liam: Steffy, I'm done.",
        "Steffy: [Crying]",

        "Doctor: Now, I want you to follow my finger without moving your head. Now the other direction. Uh, we'll be finished here in a minute.",
        "Ivy: Oh, no, no. It's fine. He can come in.",
        "Doctor: All right. Now I want you to stare up at the ceiling and tell me when you feel something, okay?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. Now. Yep. Yep. Now.",
        "Doctor: Okay. Well, you are very lucky -- except you keep ending up in our emergency room.",
        "Ivy: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Doctor: Well, I don't see any fractures in your images, so... how's your head?",
        "Ivy: Thick.",
        "Doctor: [Chuckles softly] Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you have a mild concussion. Now, that won't show up on a CT scan, but I think we should do one anyway, just to make sure everything's looking good.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Liam: Um, uh, how long ago did she come to?",
        "Doctor: I wasn't here, but pretty soon after they brought her in. I'm gonna order an IV contrast. You get ahold of hospital transport and get her down to Radiology.",
        "Liam: Thank you. [Exhales sharply] How you feeling? Or is that a stupid question?",
        "Ivy: No. I just feel humiliated.",
        "Liam: Don't say that.",
        "Ivy: You know, I can't even stay in Los Angeles now, because it's actually lowering my life expectancy.",
        "Liam: I don't know what to say to that. I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: Are you really gonna marry her, Liam? I meant everything I said to you at Forrester. I love you. She's gonna break you down... just like she does everyone else. She's gonna beat you until you're just a version of yourself that you don't even recognize anymore. Or has she already done that? 'Cause, I mean, I remember navigating the canals of Amsterdam with somebody who looks like you, but... that guy was happy.",
        "Liam: [Clears throat] Steffy says that... she didn't push you.",
        "Ivy: Well, that would be her last words on my most recent brush with emergency medicine, wouldn't it? You don't believe her.",
        "Liam: I do. I just don't know if it matters whether I do or not.",
        "Ivy: See? That's right. Doesn't even matter if she tells the truth anymore. You won't trust her. And she did tell the truth this time. Look, I want to be able to wish you two a happy life together, Liam. I really do. But it's havoc that keeps you two together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Hi. Uh, it's -- it's me again. Um...all the ER would tell me about Ivy is that she's been moved. So, um, could you call me back and tell me what's going on? Because I know you're angry, but we don't -- we don't do this. We don't -- we don't shut each other out. I'm gonna be going home, okay? So, uh, I'll be waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, I'm glad you're okay. You don't seem much in the mood for visitors, so...",
        "Ivy: Pl-- Liam, please don't go. Well, I've really painted myself into a corner here in LA, haven't I?",
        "Liam: Why wasn't my brother enough?",
        "Ivy: I guess sometimes you just-- can't get over the ones you've lost. Even if you know it's not quite the right thing.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, that doesn't explain Thomas.",
        "Ivy: Look, if I could explain Thomas to myself, I probably could have stopped myself. Do you think Wyatt's ever gonna f--",
        "Liam: Forgive you? No, I [Sighs] wouldn't count on that. And I think you should probably just take some time for yourself. You and I are not gonna be a couple, Ivy. I don't want you to think that I'm doubtful or confused about that.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, thank God. You're -- they said you were unconscious.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, she was when she first got here.",
        "Ivy: Well, apparently, I'm unkillable.",
        "Quinn: Not unlike a cockroach.",
        "Wyatt: Mom.",
        "Quinn: Are we done here?",
        "Wyatt: Mom. You were with her when it happened?",
        "Liam: Right after.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. What exactly happened? Like, nobody has said anything.",
        "Ivy: I went back to Eric's house after everything at your house, and I was packing up my things to leave, and I fell down the front stairs.",
        "Wyatt: Was Eric there?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Wyatt: Were you alone?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Liam: Steffy -- Steffy was there. Don't ask why. It was -- it was an \"accident.\" I'm s-- no, I'm sure it was an accident.",
        "Doctor: I don't expect to see any trouble on this scan, but since we have a CT on record from a few weeks ago, it'd be good to check and see how the recovery from that episode is coming.",
        "Ivy: Thank you.",
        "Liam: [Exhales sharply] I'll wait.",
        "Ivy: Thanks. Wyatt, look, I-I-I know that... you probably don't care what happens to me from this point on, but I just wanted to say thanks for coming down.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Ivy: I really didn't deserve you.",
        "Wyatt: Just do us both a favor and please stop getting hospitalized, all right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Sorry. I-I would have called you. I just thought after everything that happened, you wouldn't even want to --",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I mean, even if you didn't tell me that my girlfriend was still in love with you, I mean, why would another unconscious episode prompt any kind of notifications?",
        "Liam: Hey!",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: I didn't tell you because I didn't believe her.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, just don't.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. Hold on a second. Let me -- let me say this. Let me say this. You understand that I felt like she was testing me? I mean, she and Steffy have been so competitive lately, it really seemed like she was just trying to get a response out of me.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but she did, didn't she? 'Cause you kept it a secret...",
        "Liam: [Groans softly]",
        "Wyatt: ...Giving your already broken-off relationship priority over your own brother. So, thanks for that.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, I am not the cause of your pain. Now, I don't know where Ivy's insecurity or restlessness or whatever the hell you want to call it came from, but I did nothing to invite it. Steffy and I are happy, and I assumed that you two were happy, as well.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, strangely enough, so did I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So, let me -- let me get this straight. Ivy fell down a flight of stairs that she had walked up and down over 100,000 times in her life?",
        "Liam: Yeah. I know. I'm having some trouble with that, too.",
        "Quinn: Were she and Steffy fighting?",
        "Liam: Do they have any other kind of conversation lately?",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, Liam, do you think maybe Steffy --",
        "Liam: No, Quinn. I don't think it was an attempt at murder. They both say that Steffy never even touched her. The problem is Steffy just shouldn't have been there in the first place. I mean, time and time again, we have a conversation about how she's supposed to keep her distance from Ivy, and she agrees, you know? She acknowledges that it's not her job to defend Wyatt, and yet still she hunts Ivy down. Every -- I'm sorry. I-I'm gonna -- I got to -- I'm gonna take a walk.",
        "PA: Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender.",
        "Quinn: Well... isn't that interesting?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Steffy... was defending... you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Uh, yes. Yes. I'm -- I'm a family member. Her father is my great- uncle. Okay. So, is she awake? All right. So, if the condition's good, then will she be discharged today? All right. Thank you. Uh, yeah. I'll check back. Thanks. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I'm the injured party here, remember? I mean, why shouldn't Steffy defend me?",
        "Quinn: Because it might make Liam unhappy.",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't play it that way. If she thinks something, she says it, and you better be able to deal with it, which... actually, I kind of get.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. 'Cause the two of you have that in common.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, even when things were bad, they were at their worst with Ivy and Steffy, she came to me as a friend and an intermediary, you know?",
        "Quinn: Maybe she needs a friend right now. Liam sounded pretty fed up.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And he told her over and over again what she should do, and then she did something else that was unacceptable.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. Maybe she's feeling... bailed on, you know? Misunderstood. Of course, that's how life with Liam rolls. You should go to her.",
        "Wyatt: No. [Sighs] Mom, I'm gonna wait and make sure that Ivy's head isn't broken.",
        "Quinn: Ha! Ivy! Ivy's head is fine! She is just fine. What Ivy doesn't deserve is your concern. But you know who does deserve your concern?",
        "Wyatt: Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Steffy. I mean, she stuck up for you, you know? So...maybe you should go to her, you know? I mean, listen -- maybe that's how this whole thing was supposed to turn out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Of course, it's not your fault. It's never your fault. It's always somebody who made you do it. I am so done with your excuses.",
        "Steffy: I swear to you, Liam.",
        "Liam: Steffy, I'm done."
