    "Recap": [
        "Steffy thinks over Ivy falling and what Liam says that she was supposed to stay away and every time Ivy and she are in the same room then Ivy ends up in hospital. Wyatt tells Quinn that Ivy could be seriously injured so he thinks he can rise above his own hurt feelings right now. Quinn says Steffy needs a friend right now. She is probably very upset and Liam says it is over. There is no need for Wyatt to be here, go get his life with Steffy, they belong together, so go get her. Liam walks in and wonders what he missed. He admits that Steffy was there at the accident again and should have just stayed away the way he asked her to, but she always has her face in someone else's business. But she doesn't care and she just goes off half-cocked and someone ends up in the hospital. It drives him nuts that she has to have the last word. This time he got upset and told her he was done. Quinn perks up at that. The doctor comes in and says Ivy is a very lucky woman. She suffered a mild concussion but they will not keep her. Just no strenuous activity, no working no driving and if she feels any nausea or dizziness to get back there immediately. She thanks Wyatt and asks if he will stay and talk. He says there is nothing more to say and perhaps it is Liam she needs to talk to. In leaving Quinn tells Ivy that her concern now for her and being here does not negate how much she hated her for hurting her son. Liam is ready to drive Ivy back to Eric's when she says no, she can not stay in L. A. one more day. She has to go on to Australia. He reminds her that she can not work or drive and needs more rest and should not even be flying until she has a clear head, but she insists. She explains to Eric who hugs her and says he will miss her. She is a Forrester and will always have a place here if she does not find what she wants out there.",
        "Steffy calls Wyatt and says she is just waiting if it takes all night to hear from Liam. He is being unresponsive. Quinn tells Wyatt that a little motherly advice never hurt anyone. She keeps telling Wyatt that don't waste time; go to Steffy. She reached out to him. He points out his track record with Ivy and Hope. He is not repeating that old pattern with Steffy going after Liam all the time. She says she can not understand why he is so underappreciated by people. She knows these women broke his heart but Ivy and Hope were not worthy of him, but he and Steffy are meant to be together and they could have a bright future. Steffy is all alone and has been left in the dust by Liam once again and she turned to Wyatt so go to her. Liam gets Ivy settled on the plane against his wishes. She is confused and thinks he is coming with her. Wyatt shows up and tells Steffy that he knows she is not expecting him but he will stay a while until Liam returns. He knows he will stay with Ivy until she is on her plane and well on her way. He just thought Steffy might need a friend. He laments that he believes her story that Ivy's accident was not her fault. Ivy tells Liam that she appreciates him and she will never forget. She has a dizzy spell so Liam grabs a towel and goes to the bathroom to dampen it with water. He slips and hits his head on the lavatory just as the plane is about to take off."

        "Liam: I don't care if it's a cosmic coincidence that every time you and Ivy are in the same room, she ends up in the hospital!",
        "Steffy: We weren't even close to each other!",
        "Liam: Oh, really? Why were you here in the first place? 'Cause we had a whole conversation about this, Steffy. You were supposed to stay away.",

        "Wyatt: I can't believe I'm in the hospital again, waiting to hear about Ivy's condition again.",
        "Quinn: Frankly, I can't believe it, either, considering what she just put you through.",
        "Wyatt: Mom. Ivy could be seriously injured, all right? I mean, I think I can rise above my own disappointment to make sure she's okay.",
        "Quinn: Oh, \"disappointment\"? That's putting it mildly. She threw you under the bus for Liam!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, can we not talk about this anymore, please? Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Fine. Let's talk about what we were talking about before. Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: You know? She must be feeling pretty awful, having seen Ivy fall down the stairs like that. I bet she could use a friend.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. You're not even trying to be subtle about this.",
        "Quinn: When have I ever been subtle? Besides, you heard Liam. I mean, he's never been so upset with her. He's -- he's -- he's done, he's finished. I mean, what more do you need? An engraved invitation?",
        "Wyatt: I just don't think it's a good idea right now.",
        "Quinn: Why?! Ivy's awake, she's alert, she's -- she's fine! There's no need for you to be here! Go get your life!",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Meaning my life with Steffy?",
        "Quinn: The woman that you deserve. You and Steffy belong together. So go and get her!",
        "Liam: Did I just walk in on something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Wait, Ivy fell? What do you mean? Where is she?",
        "Pam: Well, she's at University Hospital right now. I'm not sure how serious her condition is. Wyatt and Quinn are with her, and I think Liam is, too. But wait, Eric, there's more. It seems that somehow Steffy is involved.",

        "Quinn: Wyatt and I were just having a lovely mother/son moment.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Any news on Ivy? [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: Uh, they're running tests. That's all I know.",
        "Quinn: You look exhausted.",
        "Liam: I've felt better, yeah.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. I'll bet. Must have been really hard for you to see Ivy fall down the stairs like that.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Especially when she just got over getting shocked almost to death, you know? Wonder what Steffy was doing there.",
        "Liam: It doesn't -- it doesn't matter. She shouldn't have been there. She should have stayed away from Ivy, just like before the electric shock incident, and -- and she doesn't care. She just goes off half-cocked and somebody ends up in the hospital.",
        "Quinn: Or dead.",
        "Liam: Quinn!",
        "Quinn: Don't shoot the messenger! I'm just saying.",
        "Wyatt: You don't have to say everything that pops into your mind, okay, Madre?",
        "Quinn: So, how did you leave things with her?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I lost my cool, told her I was done.",

        "[Steffy's flashback]",
        "Liam: You tell me why this violence just follows you around.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. But this isn't my fault.",
        "Liam: Of course it's not your fault. It's never your fault. It's always somebody who made you do it. I am so done with your excuses.",
        "Steffy: I swear to you, Liam!",

        "Liam: [Sighs] Not really. I don't want to talk about it with you.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, but clearly you're upset.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm upset. Why -- why are we here right now, waiting for word on Ivy's condition again? It's because Steffy can't let things go, you know? She has to get in somebody's face. She has to have the last word. It drives me nuts.",
        "Quinn: Where is she now?",
        "Liam: I left her at Eric's.",
        "Ivy: You waited.",
        "Liam: How is she?",
        "Doctor: A very lucky woman, indeed. Uh, Ivy suffered a mild concussion. Nothing too serious, so we don't have to hold her for observation. She can go home tonight.",
        "Wyatt: That's good news.",
        "Doctor: Now, no strenuous activity, no working, no driving. You get a headache that won't go away, you feel ongoing nausea or dizziness, you get back here immediately, okay?",
        "Ivy: Thanks.",
        "Doctor: Now, these are pamphlets for signs to look for. There's enough for everybody around you.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Doctor: And, um, try not to visit us again for a while.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Yeah, well, I'll try my best.",

        "Ivy: Um, uh, Wyatt, can -- can you stay? Can we just talk for a little bit?",
        "Wyatt: There's nothing more to say. Maybe you and Liam should be having a conversation. I'm just glad you're okay.",
        "Quinn: [Clears throat] Um... my being here, concerned about whether you live or die, doesn't forgive you for how much you hurt my son.",
        "Ivy: All right.",

        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh. Another eventful day.",
        "Liam: Yeah. You ready to go?",

        "Ivy: Uh, no, actually, I really don't want to go there.",
        "Liam: Ivy, I don't think Wyatt's place is a good idea right now.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I have to go home. I have to go home to Australia. Today.",

        "Singer: Not a day goes by I don't think about you remember the good and remember the bad and I'll do anything not to live without you the harder I try, the sadder I am so I'll just let time fly I'll just let time fly I'll just let time fly fly.",

        "Liam: Going back to Australia today? You're not even discharged yet, Ivy. That's not a good idea. The doctor -- doctor said you shouldn't even be driving, let alone flying halfway --",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, economy's great. Great. Thank you so much for your help. Okay. Bye. All right, well, the next flight doesn't really give me much time.",
        "Liam: Okay, can you just hold on a second? I'm not done trying to talk you out of this yet. You should not be flying back to Australia right now. You know, rest, relax, heal, and then when you have a clear head, make a decision.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I do have a clear head.",
        "Liam: Tha--",
        "Ivy: I don't want to spend one more night in L.A. after everything that's happened. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Liam: I really wish you would wait a few days, take care of yourself.",

        "Wyatt: Yeah, mom and I just left the hospital.",
        "Steffy: And?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, mild concussion, but they say she'll be okay.",
        "Steffy: Oh, thank God. I've been so worried.",
        "Wyatt: Sorry, I didn't even think about calling you. [Clears throat] Where are you?",
        "Steffy: Uh, I'm at -- I'm at home. I've been trying to reach Liam, but he's not responding. He's, uh... he's upset with me.",
        "Wyatt: Are you okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah. I mean, sure. I... I just want Liam to talk to me. If you -- if you see him again, can you make sure he's getting my messages? I'm not sure if his phone has service or not, being at the hospital.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I don't know if I'm gonna see him, but if I do, I'll let him know, sure.",
        "Steffy: Thanks.",
        "Wyatt: You sound sad.",
        "Steffy: I am.",
        "Wyatt: Well, don't be, okay? Just hang in there.",

        "Eric: Australia? Are you sure?",
        "Ivy: I can't stay here.",
        "Eric: Not even for a couple of days to recover and to give me a chance to get used to the idea?",
        "Ivy: I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: No, no, you -- you don't say \"I'm sorry.\" I say I'm sorry. I need to apologize. I-I didn't want things to turn out this way when you came here.",
        "Ivy: Eric, this -- no. This has nothing to do with you, okay? It's not your fault. You've been incredible. You've been so warm and welcoming. You're the best. I'm really gonna miss you.",
        "Eric: I'll miss you, too. But you know what you have to do. I have to respect that.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Look at me, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Look at me. You're a Forrester. You're as much a Forrester as anybody else. There will always be a place for you here. If you don't find what you're looking for out there, you come right back, all right? And I'll welcome you right back.",
        "Ivy: I love you.",
        "Eric: I love you, sweetie.",
        "Liam: So, uh, we should go.",
        "Eric: \"We\"?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm gonna take Ivy to the airport and make sure she gets in her seat okay, since I can't change her mind about leaving.",
        "Ivy: It's for the best, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Don't hold out. What did Steffy say?",
        "Wyatt: Nothing!",
        "Quinn: Come on! She reached out to you, and that means something! Don't waste your time here! Go to her!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, first off, I don't need or particularly like your coaching advice on my personal life.",
        "Quinn: A little motherly encouragement has never hurt anybody.",
        "Wyatt: Second, all Steffy wanted to talk about was where's Liam. Apparently he's non-responsive.",
        "Quinn: Well, it's a typical passive-aggressive baby.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] The point is, Mom, look at my track record lately, all right? Ivy, Hope. I'm not doing that again, all right? I'm not -- I'm not letting history repeat itself. I'm not going after a woman who's going after Liam and trying to console her.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but you heard him yourself. Liam said he's done, he's finished.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, until he's not!",
        "Quinn: Okay, just listen to me, all right? I know why you're wary. Ivy and Hope -- they hurt you really badly, and I have to say, it makes me so angry when you go around --",
        "Wyatt: [talking over Quinn] Don't get angry. For everyone's sake, don't get angry.",
        "Quinn: [talking over Wyatt] Unappreciated by people but",
        "Quinn: Listen to me! No, no, no! This is what I'm trying to tell you. When you feel pain, my love, I feel your pain. It doesn't matter what kind of a good face you try and put on anything. I know these women broke your heart, but Ivy and Hope -- they -- they aren't worthy of you, so it doesn't even matter! The only reason that I am pushing this so hard is because I believe from the bottom of my heart that you and Steffy are meant to be together and you two are going to appreciate and respect each other into this bright future!",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Quinn: You are. It's all I've ever wanted for you!",
        "Wyatt: I know that, Mom.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, Steffy is all alone, left in the dust by Liam again, who says that he is finished with her. She turned to you as a friend. So just go to her as a friend, you know? I mean, who knows? Maybe -- maybe you'll come back as something so much more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Here.",
        "Ivy: Thanks.",
        "Liam: Yeah. All right.",
        "Ivy: Hey, you know, you really didn't have to do all this. These tickets aren't refundable once you board.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know, but it's under my name so I could get you on. But also you should have two seats so you can stretch out, lay down, sleep, you know.",
        "Ivy: That's very thoughtful. Thank you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, uh, excuse me, Miss? Hi, um, this is my friend, Ivy. She just suffered a mild concussion, which means she shouldn't be flying, in my opinion, although that doesn't seem to count for much.",
        "Ivy: He's my ex-boyfriend.",
        "Flight Attendant: Ah.",
        "Liam: Yes, if you could just --",
        "Flight Attendant: Absolutely.",
        "Liam: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Flight Attendant: Can I get you anything?",
        "Ivy: No, no, I'm fine. Thanks.",
        "Flight Attendant: Okay, well, hit the button if you need me.",
        "Liam: Thanks. Wow. [Sighs] Hard to believe you're really going back to Australia.",
        "Ivy: Yep. Well, it is home.",
        "Liam: Mmm, not for a while now.",
        "Ivy: But isn't home the place you go back to?",
        "Liam: No. Home is the place you live.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Liam: Hey, last chance. You can't take a few days, maybe listen to your doctor?",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. This is why I'm glad you're coming with me. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Uh...",
        "Ivy: Oh. Wait, you're not -- you're not coming with me.",
        "Liam: No. Are you okay?",

        "Wyatt: Sorry. Uh, I know you weren't expecting me.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, well...",
        "Wyatt: Um, so still nothing from Liam, huh?",
        "Steffy: No. How could you tell?",
        "Wyatt: That look on your face when you answered the door. You thought I was him.",
        "Steffy: Any idea if he's still at the hospital?",
        "Wyatt: That would be my guess. I mean, come on. You know Liam. He's not gonna leave her side until he knows she's released from the hospital. And even then, he's gonna escort her home and make sure she gets home safe.",
        "Steffy: Might even hold a vigil.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Monitor her breathing.",
        "Wyatt: That's my brother.",
        "Steffy: So, um, why did you come here?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. I mean, I know this has been a difficult time on you, too, and I just figured maybe you'd want a friend.",
        "Steffy: I'm just thinking about everything, why all these terrible things keep happening around me. I didn't push Ivy. She tripped and she fell down the stairs. I-I didn't...",
        "Wyatt: Hey. I believe you.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. That means a lot.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Uh, do you need anything?",
        "Steffy: I just need Liam to come home so we can work this out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey. You okay? I feel like we almost lost you there.",
        "Ivy: No, I'm fine. I'll be -- I'll be great by the time I get home. Hey, actually, while I have your attention, I just had to let you know how much I appreciate you.",
        "Liam: You'll always be very special to me.",
        "Ivy: You know, some of my happiest moments have been with you. I'll never forget. Hmm. Oh, God.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. What are you doing? What do you need? What do you need? Tell me. How about if I get you a cold towel?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Flight Attendant: Everything okay?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, actually, can I grab one of these? I want to run it under some cold water for her.",
        "Flight Attendant: Yeah, then you'll want to get back to your seat. We'll be taking off soon.",
        "Liam: Oh, actually, I'm not on the -- I'm not on the -- okay.",
        "Flight Attendant: Sir.",
        "Liam: Fine.",
