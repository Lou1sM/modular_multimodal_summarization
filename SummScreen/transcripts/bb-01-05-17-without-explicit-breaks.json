    "Recap": [
        "Eric tells Wyatt that he is really impressed with him. He reminds him of his younger self. He tells him that he is behind his marriage 100%. He hopes he and Steffy find their way back to the love that he has with Quinn. Steffy comes in and looks at her dad and Liam and says they have the Quinn look on their face so what is going on. Liam tells her that Eric has Quinn in his ear and he cannot see why she cannot see that. She will always be in their lives. Quinn laments to Ivy that she is being chilly to her and Ivy is wrong about her. Never doubt her feelings for Eric. She might have had a momentary lapse in letting the flirting get out of hand but it was Ridge who stood there while she was in the outdoor shower. Ridge stops by Eric's and tells him he it there to check on his health. Eric says he is getting stronger every day .and he does not believe that is why Ridge is there. Steffy tells Liam that he has been harping on Quinn for a long time but he needs to focus on her. She could not turn down the opportunity to be CEO just because Quinn was behind it. She is moving out now but she will come back to him. He says okay but Quinn is off his charts on the radar scale and he will be keeping his eyes on her. Ivy tells Quinn that she wants to believe her but there have been too many encounters with Ridge. Quinn says he is Eric's son so she has to be careful to bring them together and not tear them apart. She is completely committed to Eric. Ivy wants Quinn to look her in the eye and say she has no desire for Ridge. Eric tells Ridge that he is not punishing him but he likes things the way they are with Steffy so no need to talk about this; just move on. Ridge says he has been in love for five minutes and yet he has loved him all his life and now he cannot listen to him. Eric says he is happier than he has ever been in his life and if Ridge cares then that is all that should matter. Ridge begs his dad to not make him do this. He can prove that Quinn does not deserve his trust. Liam jumps in and takes issue with the way that Wyatt is trying to take pictures of Steffy in sexy poses. Wyatt asks if he just likes to suck the air out of the room or does that come naturally. Liam says it is demeaning to the CEO and the company and he is not okay with that.",
        "Quinn says she despises Ridge and would she like to get back at him, but she has to find a way to get along. She has no feelings but loathing for him. Eric wants to know just what Ridge knows that can prove Quinn is not trustworthy. Ridge goes on and on and finally Eric says he will call his bluff, so bring it on. She will never let him down. Ridge says this is not a game so if he needs proof then he will have to show him the naked truth. Wyatt tells Liam that he should not be in the middle of this. It is okay with Steffy so he has no right to hold her back. Liam says it is demeaning to see her all over the internet in her lingerie. Wyatt says oh it is the Fuller conspiracy. Steffy tells Liam that she sees his point of view but she can handle how she is presented. Quinn thinks lovingly of Eric but then her thoughts turn to Ridge and she is uncomfortable with that. Eric asks what is the naked truth. He and Quinn are married and both realize if someone does something out of bounds then it is over, but Quinn is not going to do that. Ridge hollers that Quinn wants Wyatt with Steffy and she will not stop until that happens. Eric tells Ridge that he wants him out of this house. Go get his naked proof and then come back. Until then he is just being insulting."

        "Liam: Hold on a second. Yesterday, you were adamant about getting rid of Quinn no matter what the consequences.",
        "Ridge: If we go through with this plan, destroy Quinn, I'm gonna lose my dad for good, and maybe I just want to hold on to whatever relationship we have left.",
        "Liam: Oh, so you're changing your mind?",
        "Ridge: No, no, no. I'm thinking things through. I don't know if I want to do this. I don't know if I want to do this to Quinn. To expose her like that. Maybe there's a way to do this honestly and peacefully.",
        "Steffy: You guys got that Quinn look on your face. What's going on?",
        "Quinn: It's chilly in here.",
        "Ivy: You can turn the heating up.",
        "Quinn: It's not about the temperature. You haven't said two words to me since you sat down.",
        "Ivy: I'm upset with you, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well, don't be, ivy! I came clean with you!",
        "Ivy: Which I actually do give you credit for, because honesty hasn't really been your default. But I thought that it was now. I believed in your devotion to my uncle.",
        "Quinn: Because it's real. I haven't betrayed Eric, and I never will!",
        "Ivy: Quinn, you were flirting with his son in the steam room. How could you do that?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Wyatt. I see a lot of myself in you.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I'm flattered. How so?",
        "Eric: I was always very excited to go to work.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, social media's the beast that never sleeps. I got to feed the monster, right?",
        "Eric: How's the campaign going?",
        "Wyatt: It's great. You wouldn't believe Steffy's numbers, and mom and I are actually working on something that's gonna make them skyrocket. We can't wait to show you.",
        "Eric: You're really committed to this project, aren't you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Only helps the company and it helps...Steffy.",
        "Eric: And that's what this is all about, isn't it? Your great love for my granddaughter. I'm behind your marriage, Wyatt. 100%.",
        "Wyatt: That means a lot, Eric. Thank you.",
        "Eric: I only want what's best for my granddaughter and for you. I hope the two of you find the same love and commitment that I've been blessed to find with Quinn.",
        "Steffy: What's going on? Has Quinn done something?",
        "Liam: Besides breathing perfectly good air?",
        "Steffy: You and my dad were just talking about her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you know, more of the same. \"Why is she here? What can we do to stop it?\" How'd you sleep?",
        "Steffy: Not great. It's hard being away from you.",
        "Liam: You know there is a fix for that.",
        "Steffy: I know. I want to come back home.",
        "Liam: So why don't you? There's no reason we should be apart.",
        "Steffy: Not according to my grandfather.",
        "Liam: Ah, yes. Has he done this before? Inserting himself into your personal life?",
        "Steffy: No. But I've never been married to one brother and living with another. I've never been so much in the public eye.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and he's never had Quinn whispering in his ear. I mean, this is my whole point. I just -- I just wish you would realize how much Quinn is behind all of this.",
        "Quinn: For Pete's sake, ivy, you act like I'm having an affair with ridge. I don't even like the guy.",
        "Ivy: You admitted to flirting with him.",
        "Quinn: It's just banter! I-I mean, it's better than him barking at me all the time. You know how rude he can be to me. I am his favorite dumping ground, so can you blame me for wanting to have a different way to communicate with him?",
        "Ivy: With your clothes off?",
        "Quinn: That was happenstance. I was showering in my outdoor shower. Ridge was the one who snuck up on me.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, who stands there and has a conversation completely stark naked?",
        "Quinn: You know what, ivy, I don't expect you to understand. You haven't had to prove yourself your entire life and never back down. But I have. Being with Eric has softened a lot of my rough edges, but not all of them. And when I'm challenged, sometimes my old defense mechanisms kick in, and maybe that's not the right response, but I am working on it. But all of my imperfections that you all love to point out to me, one thing about me is pure -- my feelings for Eric. Never doubt them.",
        "Eric: What can I do for you, son?",
        "Ridge: I'm just here to check on you, check on your health.",
        "Eric: Stronger every day.",
        "Ridge: Glad to hear that.",
        "Eric: Call me cynical, but something tells me that this unexpected visit has to do with something other than my health.",
        "Ridge: You're right. The family's been off-track ever since you got involved with Quinn, and I wanted to see if there was a chance to normalize things.",
        "Eric: \"Normalizing things\" means having you as C.E.O. And Steffy not.",
        "Ridge: No, that's not why I'm here.",
        "Steffy: I get it. You're frustrated. Quinn has been messing with you for a long time, and that's all you can see is her, but... Liam, you need to see me. And trust that I'm smart enough to handle myself.",
        "Liam: It's not a matter of intellect.",
        "Steffy: Okay, fine. Say you're right. Say that Quinn is behind everything -- the C.E.O. Position, which is an incredible opportunity. What, I should just turn it down because she arranged it? And Wyatt. He's always gonna be around. He's your brother, he's my soon-to-be ex-husband, he's my grandfather's stepson. It doesn't have to affect us if we won't allow it. I'm not gonna allow it. Yeah, I'm moving out, but once the divorce is final, I'm gonna come back to you.",
        "Liam: All right. I hear you. But my Quinn radar is off the charts, so I'm keeping watch. And I'm not gonna let her hurt you. Wyatt, either, for that matter.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: Oh! Should we come back later?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, let's go with \"no\" because, uh, you know, we were scheduled to work on your social media campaign today, so...",
        "Ivy: I want to believe you, Quinn, but I can't stop thinking about all of these questionable encounters with ridge.",
        "Quinn: What encounters? There were only two.",
        "Ivy: He saw you naked.",
        "Quinn: I wanted to get in his face, make him uncomfortable.",
        "Ivy: Well, that seemed to work because he then followed you into the steam room.",
        "Quinn: Exactly! He followed me, not the other way around.",
        "Ivy: But you just sat there and let him touch you?",
        "Quinn: Okay, look. [Scoffs] Ivy, this guy has been horrible to me. I mean, ridge has been completely out of line, but he's Eric's son, so I have to be careful. I-I can't vent, I-I can't express any outrage, and I'm trying to bring this family together, not tear it apart! Look, I was trying to have a little fun with him, but that was a mistake. But it has no bearing on my feelings for my husband. I am completely committed to Eric!",
        "Ivy: Quinn, I need to be certain. We're talking about the uncle I adore. Look me in the eyes and tell me that you have no desire for ridge.",
        "Eric: So this is not about Steffy?",
        "Ridge: No, it really isn't, dad. Steffy has great potential. She's gonna be a fantastic C.E.O. One day, but not now. She doesn't have the experience to helm this place.",
        "Eric: To guard against the vandals at the gate, like my wife and my son?",
        "Ridge: Kind of like that. And I know you think you don't need protection, but you do, and that's why I'm here.",
        "Eric: No, I'm okay. I'm okay with the way things are.",
        "Ridge: I get it. You're punishing me because I'm not playing nice with your wife.",
        "Eric: No, I'm not punishing you, ridge. I want all the same things you do. All of them. I want what's best for this company and for our family. I think Steffy can unify all of us. Unlike you, who's been nothing but divisive for the last few months.",
        "Ridge: I'm not divisive at all. I'm trying to save us, save you.",
        "Eric: All right, look, we're not gonna get anywhere talking about this, all right? Let's just move on.",
        "Ridge: Wow. How did this happen to us, huh? Moving on past things? You've been in love with this woman for five minutes. Loved you my whole life, and you can't listen to me? Hear this -- this woman's no good.",
        "Eric: How do you know this? You don't know Quinn. You don't know Quinn at all. You never spent any time with her. You've never observed how hard she's been trying to change, to better herself, and you've never observed the wonderful results.",
        "Eric: I'm happy now. I'm happier than I've ever been in my life. And if you care about me, that's all that should matter.",
        "Ridge: Of course I love you. I love you more than life. I love the way you look at things. You always -- you always see the best in people. You always think that people can better themselves, but... the past indicates the future, and this one here is as dangerous now as she ever was. Don't make me do this, Dad. [Sighs] What if I could prove to you that Quinn doesn't deserve your trust?",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I think we got it.",
        "Nicole: These pics are gonna be dope.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah, and I want them posted right away.",
        "Nicole: On it.",
        "Steffy: You have been amazing.",
        "Nicole: Are you kidding? Happy to be part of the team.",
        "Liam: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Bro. Bro! You're missing a piece of Steffy's life the world needs to see!",
        "Wyatt: What? What?",
        "Liam: She's hydrating!",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, bro. Thanks. Way to look out. You know, why -- why is it that you -- you just disagree with all of these photos? Why? It's just -- they're innocuous. It's a day in the life of her in the office.",
        "Liam: Sure, yeah, except for the fact that she's sitting on the desk, not at it, her legs are crossed a little high, and she's leaning forward ever-so- slightly so she can show that somethin'-somethin'?",
        "Wyatt: That's sexy! What are you --",
        "Liam: You don't have a problem with this? Really?",
        "Steffy: Okay, I get both of your views, but I don't think Wyatt's taking it too far.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Okay, I'm sorry. Let me rephrase. It doesn't scare you a little bit the fact that your every move is being documented for the whole world to see so people can \"follow\" you?",
        "Wyatt: Do you -- do you stay up late at night trying to figure out ways how to suck all the air out of the room, or are you just a natural at that?",
        "Liam: Well, I do stay up reading the comments section on your posts. And let me tell you something, there are creeps out there, and they're not fans.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, way to go, bro! Way to scare her into doing what you want her to do. Rude comments come with the territory, okay? And anyway, you can't be high-profile and invisible at the same time. It just doesn't happen. People have cell phones. Paparazzi are always standing outside your door, and if you -- getting in front of it lets you create your own perception.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, she's the C.E.O. This is the diminishing to both her and the company.",
        "Wyatt: You're wrong, bro. You're wrong.",
        "Liam: No, I'm not. No, I'm not! He's objectifying you. I'm sorry, I'm not cool with that.",
        "Ivy: Tell me you don't feel a pull towards ridge.",
        "Quinn: I despise ridge. Do I enjoy getting the upper hand with him after the miserable way he's treated me? Yes. I do. But it is nothing. It's certainly not a threat to my marriage. Eric is the only man I ever want to be with. Unfortunately, ridge comes with him, and I have to find a way to deal. But feelings for him, other than loathing him on a visceral level? Never.",
        "Eric: What did you just say? That you want to prove something? Prove what?",
        "Ridge: That the family was right all along. That you can't trust this creature.",
        "Eric: And how exactly do you propose to do that?",
        "Ridge: I don't want to do any of it, but -- you're so besotted with this woman, you don't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something.",
        "Eric: \"This woman?\" This woman is Quinn. This is her home. You call her by her name, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Okay! Quinn! Quinn is not trustworthy by any name!",
        "Eric: All right. How about this? I'll call your bluff. Bring it to me. You bring proof to me, and you put it on the table.",
        "Ridge: You think this is a game, dad?",
        "Eric: A game?",
        "Ridge: I'm telling you that the woman you married has no conscience, has no loyalty, and has no soul. It's only a matter of time before she betrays you, but you stay with her, and she gets her hooks in you, and when she rips them out, it's gonna just tear you open, and I want to end this nightmare.",
        "Eric: You'll never convince me that she's anything less than committed to our marriage.",
        "Ridge: When did you become so naive, dad?",
        "Eric: Ridge, if believing someone can change for the better is naive, then you're right. That's what I am. But that's what she's done, and in the most magnificent way.",
        "Ridge: And she's never gonna let you down. That's what you think.",
        "Eric: That's what I know.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Okay. Then I'm gonna have to show you the naked truth.",
        "Wyatt: You have no business being in the middle of this, Liam. Forrester creations is a fantastic brand! It just -- it just needs to be a little updated, and Steffy gives us that.",
        "Steffy: Profits are up with the younger demographic.",
        "Liam: Okay, why does it need to be Steffy? Why not Nicole or ivy or, heck, Thomas -- somebody who doesn't have a corporate image to protect?",
        "Wyatt: Because C.E.O. makes Steffy like a powerful role model!",
        "Liam: Her mind. Not her body, her mind. You want to inspire? Be strategic. You give them a little bit -- a little bit -- and then they want more.",
        "Wyatt: For how long? Two minutes? Attention spans are a thing of the past. Steffy disappears, numbers fall. Bottom lines are affected.",
        "Liam: Let's talk about that, then. What about her standing in the industry, because she is the C.E.O. of Forrester creations, and you've got her all over the internet in lingerie. It's demeaning, and Steffy, I'm sorry, but it's disrespectful to me, too. That's something only I should get to see, and the more you go down this road with him, the more you play into their whole plan.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, the fuller conspiracy theory again. There it is!",
        "Liam: It's not a theory, Wyatt! Everything you and Quinn do is designed to get Steffy for you.",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Steffy: Liam. Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Hey. We're together. Nothing changes. And I understand your concerns. But I can handle how I'm presented. I'm in control, okay?",
        "Liam: Okay, I just wish Quinn wasn't pulling all the strings.",
        "Eric: I will always be sure that you have my love and all my admiration. I will defend you, and I'm gonna be your sanctuary and your protection.",
        "Quinn: As your wife, I will be steadfast and faithful, my love.",
        "Ridge: ...Because you despise me as much as I despise you.",
        "Quinn: So, that's what this is all about -- this whate-- I don't even know what to call it.",
        "Ridge: Honey, I don't know what to call it, either. Maybe we're just toying with each other.",
        "Eric: What are you talking about, ridge? \"Naked truth\" -- what do you mean?",
        "Ridge: I'm trying to make you see the harsh reality of what you unleashed on all of us.",
        "Eric: Quinn and I are married to one another. Married people understand that if one person betrays the other, then the marriage is over. We understand that, but it's not gonna happen.",
        "Ridge: Dad, I love you, man. You're the strongest man I know, when did you turn into this little puppy that just wants his belly rubbed?",
        "Eric: Oh, do you know how insulting that is? Come on, ridge!",
        "Ridge: I don't want to insult you, dad! I'm here to tell you something! This woman manipulates everybody! You really think that she wanted Steffy to be C.E.O. because she thought she was the best choice? No! She wants Steffy to be with Wyatt.",
        "Eric: I don't object to that.",
        "Ridge: And why is that? 'Cause it was her idea?",
        "Eric: Because they're married.",
        "Ridge: She orchestrated it!",
        "Eric: All right, this is pointless! This is pointless. You and I are never gonna see eye-to-eye when it comes to Quinn. I'm very tired of you insulting my wife.",
        "Ridge: She's gonna let you down, dad.",
        "Eric: Quinn is loyal to me!",
        "Ridge: She's loyal?",
        "Eric: Yes, she is!",
        "Ridge: And completely devoted?",
        "Eric: That's absolutely right.",
        "Ridge: She is not, and I can prove it!",
        "Eric: Then do it! Get out of my house right now and get your proof together and come on back with it!",
        "Ridge: This woman is gonna be the downfall of this family and this company. The naked truth is that someone's gonna have to be sacrificed to stop her. You want that to be me?",
        "Eric: Go on. Get out."
