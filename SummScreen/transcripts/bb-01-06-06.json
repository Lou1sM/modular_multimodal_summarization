        "[Shower running] \r\n",
        "Taylor: Ridge, we have to \r\ntalk. Ridge, I have something to tell you. ",
        "[Phone ringing] Hello?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? \r\n",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, Ridge \r\nand I need some privacy right now. ",
        "Stephanie: You haven't \r\ntold him, have you? ",
        "Taylor: He's in the \r\nshower. I can't talk. ",
        "Stephanie: Then just \r\nlisten to me. Taylor, please. He will accept the idea that you kissed Hector. He \r\nwill never accept the idea that you slept with James and kept it from him all \r\nthese years. ",
        "Taylor: A half-truth is no \r\ntruth at all. ",
        "Stephanie: You're putting \r\nyour family in jeopardy. Brooke is just waiting. ",
        "Taylor: I've got to go. \r\nOkay, bye-bye. ",
        "",
        "Ridge: Ordering take-out?\r\n",
        "Taylor: Oh, no. Would you \r\nlike me to? ",
        "Ridge: Maybe we should. I \r\ndon't want to leave this bedroom for a week. I don't even want to leave the bed. \r\nI missed you so much. ",
        "Taylor: I missed you, too.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I wondered how \r\nlong it would take Taylor to call out the dogs. ",
        "Stephanie: I know what you \r\nsaw. ",
        "Brooke: I got an eyeful. \r\nIt was practically a peep show. ",
        "Stephanie: Don't make \r\njokes about it. ",
        "Brooke: What, Taylor \r\nstanding there in her underwear, kissing a man other than your precious Ridge? \r\nWhat would you call it? ",
        "Stephanie: Bad judgment.\r\n",
        "Brooke: She was cheating \r\non her husband, Stephanie. If that had been me, you would've kicked me out of \r\ntown. ",
        "Stephanie: I thought I \r\nhad. ",
        "Brooke: You know, Taylor's \r\nnot such a good person after all. But I'm sure you don't blame her. You must \r\nblame the big, bad fireman, saying he took advantage of her, right? And then you \r\ntold Taylor you would fix everything. You came over here to blame me and say it \r\nwas all my fault, when we both know damn well it's not. ",
        "Taylor: Ridge -- there's \r\nsomething I need to say. ",
        "Ridge: I know you're \r\nangry. I know you're angry and you have every right to be. Look -- sit down, sit \r\ndown. I got a lot accomplished when I was away, but that's no excuse for missing \r\nthe first holidays with you since you've been back. ",
        "Taylor: No, it's not.\r\n",
        "Ridge: I wished I moved \r\nheaven and earth to get back to you and the kids. ",
        "Taylor: I wish you had, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Ridge: But I'm here now \r\nand this is where I always wanted to be. It wasn't real great being in my hotel \r\nroom having Christmas by myself, when I knew I should've been here with you, \r\nshowing you how much I love you. How much I want to show you tonight. \r\n",
        "Taylor: I love you, too.\r\n",
        "",
        "Stephanie: What were you \r\ndoing over there anyway? I told you to leave Taylor alone. ",
        "Brooke: I didn't push \r\nTaylor into Hector's arms. I didn't force him to kiss her. And from what I saw, \r\nneither did Hector. ",
        "Stephanie: And don't you \r\ntry to judge Taylor. ",
        "Brooke: Get off your high \r\nhorse. I'm not the only one in this family who makes mistakes, and now I have \r\nproof! ",
        "Stephanie: And don't \r\ncompare your behavior with Taylor's. ",
        "Brooke: She's involved \r\nwith another man. ",
        "Stephanie: A kiss. \r\n",
        "Brooke: With another man.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Look, Ridge \r\nneglected Taylor, and she was upset and confused. ",
        "Brooke: Confused? \r\n",
        "Stephanie: Yes, confused. \r\nDon't you try to use this to undermine that marriage. I'm telling you, Taylor \r\nwill tell her husband what she wants to tell him. You keep your mouth shut and \r\nstay out of it. ",
        "",
        "Ridge: Oh, I have \r\nsomething for you. ",
        "Taylor: Oh. ",
        "Ridge: Merry Christmas.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Ridge, it's \r\nbeautiful. It's so extravagant, all those diamonds. ",
        "Ridge: It was the only \r\nthing I could find in Paris that was almost as luminous as you are. One diamond \r\nfor each of the years we've been together. One diamond for each of our kids. For \r\nall the happiness you've given me. For the happiness, hopefully, I will give \r\nyou. ",
        "Taylor: Thank you. \r\n",
        "Ridge: No, thank you. I \r\nknow I pushed you to the limit the last few weeks. I half expected all my stuff \r\nto be chucked out on the lawn when I got back. ",
        "Taylor: I don't want you \r\ngoing anywhere. ",
        "Ridge: I'm not going \r\nanywhere. Not for a long, long time. I learned something in Paris. Day after day \r\nbeing surrounded by gorgeous models, a lot of beautiful people, I realized that \r\nphysical beauty just didn't seem to inspire me the way it used to. I think you \r\nspoiled me. Your beauty seems to transcend the physical. It just kind of \r\nradiates from within you. Your passion for life, work, our family -- helping \r\npeople -- that's what inspires me, doc. That's what makes you so unique. \r\n",
        "Taylor: I'm not, not \r\nreally. ",
        "Ridge: Yes, you are. You \r\nare to me. ",
        "Taylor: That's sweet. I \r\nappreciate the flattery. ",
        "Ridge: It's true. Yes, \r\nyou're a beautiful woman, but I think it's more your kindness and your virtue \r\nthat makes you so extraordinary. ",
        "Taylor: Ridge. I have \r\nsomething to tell you. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: You're the one who \r\nshould stay out of this, not me. ",
        "Stephanie: I do not want \r\nyou disrupting that marriage. ",
        "Brooke: So what are you \r\ngoing to do now, Stephanie? Fake another heart attack? How many lies are you \r\ngoing to tell to keep this farce going? ",
        "Stephanie: Their marriage \r\nis not a farce. ",
        "Brooke: Well, then why was \r\nTaylor kissing another man? And why didn't ridge come home for the holidays?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Look, they've \r\nhad some problems. I do not want you to try to exploit that. ",
        "Brooke: The same way you \r\nexploited your son's uncertainty when you tricked him into renewing his vows \r\nwith Taylor? ",
        "Stephanie: He's has had \r\nmore than ample time to change his mind, but he hasn't, has he? ",
        "Brooke: He might, after I \r\ntell him what Taylor did. ",
        "Stephanie: This is exactly \r\nwhat you've been waiting for, isn't it? You've lost nick, so, what? Now all of a \r\nsudden Ridge is going to be your destiny again? ",
        "Brooke: My future with \r\nRidge isn't the issue here. ",
        "Stephanie: You don't have \r\na future with him. ",
        "Brooke: You wouldn't even \r\nbe here if you really believed that. But you are. So that means Ridge's and \r\nTaylor's marriage is in serious trouble. ",
        "",
        "Taylor: You're right, I \r\nwas upset with you when you didn't come home for the holidays. You have no idea \r\nwhat it did to me. I mean, Ridge, this was my first Christmas back home with the \r\nfamily, and you weren't here. ",
        "Ridge: You said you \r\nweren't angry. ",
        "Taylor: I was. I was hurt, \r\nI was confused. And then, when you called and said you weren't coming back for \r\nNew Year's after you said you would -- ",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I messed up, \r\nDoc. I messed up. I'm so sorry. ",
        "Taylor: So am I. \r\n",
        "Ridge: You have nothing to \r\nbe sorry about, Doc. ",
        "Taylor: Yes, I do. When \r\nyou called to tell me that you weren't coming back from Paris, Hector was here.\r\n",
        "Ridge: Hector? Didn't we \r\nagree you were gonna keep your distance from that guy? ",
        "Taylor: I wasn't expecting \r\nhim. I was expecting you. Ridge, I had this whole special evening planned for \r\nus. I had a special evening of candles and champagne, and then when you didn't \r\nshow up -- and then Hector stopped by to wish me a Happy New Year. Actually, he \r\nwas just leaving when you called. ",
        "Ridge: He was just \r\nleaving? Or he didn't? What? ",
        "Taylor: No. He saw how \r\nupset I was. Because I was so looking forward to having you back home again and \r\nseeing you. You know, Ridge, we have been through so much this last year. It's \r\nbeen really hard. I just wanted to start the New Year off right. Again, I was \r\nsecond priority. You left me here alone while you went away on business \r\noverseas. It just feels like this marriage has never been a priority to you.\r\n",
        "Ridge: That's not true.\r\n",
        "Taylor: I asked you to \r\ncome home and you didn't. ",
        "Ridge: I explained that.\r\n",
        "Taylor: I didn't want an \r\nexplanation, Ridge. I wanted you to need me. I wanted to feel appreciated by \r\nyou. ",
        "Ridge: Taylor, you know I \r\nappreciate you. ",
        "Taylor: Well, I didn't \r\nfeel that way on New Year's. At least, not from you. ",
        "Ridge: So hector realized \r\nwhat you were feeling and he took advantage? ",
        "Taylor: I was vulnerable. \r\nAnd we both knew that. And I asked him to leave, but he didn't. He followed me \r\nupstairs. ",
        "Ridge: Hector was up here \r\nin our bedroom, again? You kicked him out, right? ",
        "Taylor: I told you, I was \r\nhurt and I was confused. Ridge, I let him kiss me. ",
        "Ridge: He kissed you? \r\nRight here in our bedroom? ",
        "Taylor: I know, I \r\nshouldn't have let that happen. I know that, I know. ",
        "Ridge: Did you sleep with \r\nhim? ",
        "Taylor: No. It was just a \r\nkiss. ",
        "Ridge: It wasn't the \r\nfirst. ",
        "Taylor: It was the last. I \r\npromise, Ridge. I promise you, it will never happen again. It was one awful \r\nnight, I've got to tell you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Ridge. ",
        "Ridge: That SOB! I just \r\n-- why? ",
        "Taylor: It's not your \r\nfault, you know, I'm not blaming you. ",
        "Ridge: I'll deal with him \r\nin the morning. I'm not gonna do this. I'm not gonna do this. I don't want to \r\nspoil this wonderful evening by arguing over Hector Ramirez. ",
        "Taylor: No, Ridge, I want \r\nto face this. You need to know what happened. ",
        "Ridge: You said it was \r\njust a kiss, right? That's all it was. ",
        "Taylor: It was. \r\n",
        "Ridge: Okay, so, Hector \r\ntook advantage of you and that's all we need to talk about then. ",
        "Taylor: Well, no, it's \r\nnot. I haven't told you the rest. There's one more thing you need to know.\r\n",
        "",
        "Stephanie: See, there you \r\ngo again. Thinking somehow that my son's life involves you. ",
        "Brooke: You're terrified I \r\nwill tell Ridge the truth about Taylor. ",
        "Stephanie: No, there's no \r\nchance that'll happen. Because she's telling him everything as we speak. \r\n",
        "Brooke: Some sanitized \r\nversion that I'm sure you approved. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, she's \r\ndetermined to tell him far more than I would've liked. ",
        "Brooke: Well, it looks \r\nlike your perfect daughter-in-law isn't a saint after all. And what did you call \r\nher? Unimpeachable? Makes me think about all the things that she's done that we \r\ndon't know about. But then, I'm sure you know. Because you're her champion and \r\nher confidante. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I am. And \r\nbecause I am, I know the marriage will survive. She's determined that it will.\r\n",
        "Brooke: Then what are you \r\nso worried about? ",
        "Stephanie: Because I know \r\nhow you operate. Pretty soon you'll start parading around Forrester Creations in \r\nyour underwear, and then you'll lure him into a sauna or you'll accidentally get \r\ntrapped with him in an elevator. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, Stephanie, you \r\ngive me way too much credit. I'm not going to break up Ridge and Taylor's \r\nmarriage. If Taylor's telling Ridge the truth right now, that marriage is going \r\nto fall apart all on it's own. ",
        "",
        "Ridge: There's more?\r\n",
        "Taylor: Yes. ",
        "Ridge: You're not going to \r\ntell me you're attracted to Hector? You're interested in him? ",
        "Taylor: No. This is \r\nsomething else. Something that happened a long, long time ago. Something I've \r\nbeen keeping from you. ",
        "Ridge: You don't keep \r\nsecrets, you hate them. ",
        "Taylor: This one most of \r\nall. ",
        "Ridge: It's that bad?\r\n",
        "Taylor: It should have \r\ncome out a long time ago. I can't tell you how much I regret that I haven't said \r\nanything to you about it. You know honesty is so important to me, Ridge. \r\nEspecially now, especially in our marriage. Especially because we're trying to \r\nget everything back to the way it used to be. And I want that more than \r\nanything. And I hope you do, too. ",
        "Ridge: Well, I did. Now \r\nI'm not so sure. ",
        "Taylor: That's why I don't \r\nwant to hide this anymore, Ridge. I want to start over fresh. I want to be the \r\nwoman that you think I am. ",
        "Ridge: It sounds really \r\nserious. ",
        "Taylor: Yeah, it is.\r\n",
        "{Taylor remembering}",
        "Stephanie: Don't tell him \r\nabout James. It will destroy your marriage. I'm telling you, Ridge will leave \r\nyou. ",
        "Taylor: It was an \r\nincredible lapse in judgment. One I will regret for the rest of my life, I know. \r\nDo you remember the earthquake? When I was trapped in that cabin with James \r\nWarwick? ",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you almost \r\ndied. You both almost died. ",
        "Taylor: Yes, we thought we \r\nwere going to. We were terrified. We were clinging to each other for dear life. \r\nRidge, that night -- James and I -- James and I slept together. "
