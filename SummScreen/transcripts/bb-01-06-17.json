        "Steffy is off in some dream world and does not hear what Wyatt is asking he \u0096 when is their meeting with Eric. She says soon and he remarks that Liam was wrong. There is nothing wrong with their campaign and she does not have to be more private. The interaction she has right now on social media is skyrocketing. She says she knows and Liam is in pain and she is supposed to feel good about that. She tells Wyatt to go on to the meeting as she has a few things to finish up. Liam whines to Ridge again that he feels so disconnected. It used to be he could discuss things with Steffy, even argue about them but now it's all about Quinn. He says he can feel Steffy slipping away and there is not a damn thing he can do about it. But there is something Ridge can do if he is still up for it. Ridge says he has no choice, she has Eric all tied up. Liam agrees and more and more every day Steffy is accepting Quinn. Waiting for the meeting, Eric tells Quinn that it was horrible. He and Ridge have had their differences but this was the worst. She knows it was about her. He laments that he was hoping after the holidays they would get better but he thinks they never will now. When he doesn't want to talk about it she says they can talk about something positive. He says okay \u0096 something solid about them that he can smile about. She says they may have lost Ridge for the moment but he has Wyatt and Steffy in large part due to him. He says all he told Steffy was what he believed would be good for her. Quinn agrees, it would be so good if she were to move in here with them and Wyatt. She respects Eric and listens to him so give her a chance. She's living out of a suitcase now and could have her own suite. Wyatt comes in laden down with boxes ready for showtime.",
        "Steffy talks to Thomas on the phone and says she is fine but she has moved back to his loft until her divorce is final. Liam comments to Ridge that he sees it happening every day more and more that Quinn has Steffy brainwashed. They definitely have to get her out of there. Steffy is late and apologizes but wants to get right to the meeting. Eric says Wyatt has a presentation first and he realizes just how hard this is on Steffy to move out on Liam but it was best with her new position. Wyatt remarks about Steffy's beauty and intelligence and how far this will take them, but there is something more \u0096 the brand for FC. And that can be summed up in one word \u0096 sales. He turns on the laptop and shows them S for Steffy, a brand all her own. She smells it and likes the tiny smell of lilac. But shouldn't they go through R&D and he says he kinda already did ..even without telling her. She says she is surprised but she is blown away. Wyatt says it is her brand and people are inspired by her ..the confidence and the power, something every woman wants to be and every man wants to be around .and one in particular .her husband. Liam asks Ridge what if Quinn is toying with him. She taunts him but she never crosses the line. Ridge says yes this time she is going to cross that line. And her whole world will fall apart and Eric will never look at her the same way again. Eric tells Steffy that they need to stay close, be a team. She has already moved out on Liam so just move on in here. Wyatt says he knows this is sudden; he only heard about it before this meeting but he thinks it is a great idea. Eric says in time he has something to show her, her portrait will go over the mantle. Quinn says surely Steffy can see how good she and Eric are together. Eric adds that even Steffy can see the good things she had with Wyatt and can still have. Wyatt steps forward and says she changed his life and brought him some of the happiest days he has ever had. He goes on that he knows Steffy blames Quinn for manipulating them into getting married but she has changed from the past, just look at her. She and Eric are good together and she cannot deny that so he is asking her just to give it another try. Eric says again to give her marriage to Wyatt another go, there is nothing the four of them can not accomplish. Wyatt agrees there is nothing they cannot accomplish and that is all he wants. They will be with family and cannot fail so just come back to him. Liam thinks aloud \u0096 Steffy is being ganged up on by Quinn, Eric and Wyatt. With a conflicted look on her face, Wyatt tells Steffy to come home to him."

        "Wyatt: Have you seen these numbers? This is insane. I mean, I expected big, but not this big. I can't wait to tell Eric. This is...What time is the meeting? Steff?",
        "Steffy: Huh? What?",
        "Wyatt: What time is the meeting with Eric?",
        "Steffy: Uh, pretty soon. Uh, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You still thinking about what Liam said? \u0091Cause he's wrong you know.",
        "Steffy: What? That I should be more private with my life? I don't know. I'm starting to think it's not a bad idea.",
        "Wyatt: Have you seen the results? Like, your followers, it's insane, ok? The interaction you have on social media right now, it's skyrocketing. It's crazy.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I'm quite the influencer, and Liam's in pain. And I'm just supposed to feel good about it? Look, you go to the meeting. I got a few things I need to wrap up here, so",
        "Wyatt: Alright.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I just feel so disconnected, you know. It used to be Steffy and I could discuss things. We could even argue about things and now, no. Nope.",
        "Ridge: That's Quinn. Everyone's dancing to her tune.",
        "Liam: I can feel her slipping away. And there's not a damn thing I can do about it. Though there is something you could do, if you're still up for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: It was horrible. Ridge and I have had our battles before, but this time it -",
        "Quinn: It was about me, I assume.",
        "Eric: Look, after the holidays, I was hoping that things would get better, but I'm afraid they just...I think they never will now.",
        "Quinn: What was his complaint this time?",
        "Eric: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Ok. Fine. Then we won't talk about it. Let's talk about something positive.",
        "Eric: Something positive, yeah. You and me. Something solid I can smile about.",
        "Quinn: I can make you more than smile. You know, we're family, Eric, you and me. We may have lost Ridge at the moment, but we have Wyatt and Steffy.",
        "Eric: They may be on the verge of rediscovery.",
        "Quinn: In large part due to you.",
        "Eric: All I did was tell them what I believe about loyalty and commitment.",
        "Quinn: Well, it stuck. Steffy moved out of Liam's. Wouldn't it be so wonderful if she moved in here with us and Wyatt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Thank you Thomas. Yeah, I'm all set up at the loft. Yeah, right. Right, once the divorce is final. [Sighs] Yeah, no, I'm fine. I mean, I'm ok. All right, I have to go. I'll talk to you later, alright.",
        "Liam: I love you, Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Listen, I know you're having second thoughts about your plan to expose Quinn.",
        "Ridge: I'm having second thoughts about the plan to destroy my dad.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that to my dad, either.",
        "Ridge: But after the run-in I just had with him, it makes me realize he doesn't see Quinn the way we see her, and he is gonna get burned.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but maybe not for a while.",
        "Ridge: What does that mean? That's not a good thing. He believes her more every day.",
        "Liam: So, what? You're gonna go through with this?",
        "Ridge: I don't have a choice. She's got him all tied up. Just gonna do whatever she wants. God knows what that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Steffy needs to move in here, Eric.",
        "Eric: Well, it's gonna take a little more convincing.",
        "Quinn: I know, but she listens to you. She respects you.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, we run the risk of, uh, having her feel like she's being pressured too much.",
        "Quinn: I know, but very day that goes by is another day closer to that divorce being finalized. Her living at Thomas' is just burning time. You do want her to live here, right?",
        "Eric: I do. I'd love her to live here. But the last time I suggested it, she was -",
        "Quinn: I know, but just - I would ask her again. Cause you've already given her so much - the top position at Forrester over Ridge and Thorne and Rick. And this isn't too much more. She's living out of a suitcase. She could be living in her own suite.",
        "Eric: She'd be with her husband. She'd be at home.",
        "Quinn: And we would be saving a marriage.",
        "Eric: I agree. We're on the same page. I absolutely agree.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Eric: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, it's almost showtime, so I should start.",
        "Eric: Good timing. We were just talking about you.",
        "Quinn: And Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Well, she - she should be here any minute.",
        "Quinn: I know but we were thinking that if we all worked together, we could get Steffy to move back in here. And then you and she can move on with your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, it's kind of ironic. Steff walked out on Wyatt because of his mother, and then she walked out on me for the same reason.",
        "Ridge: She can't see that. She's blind like my dad is right now.",
        "Liam: I know. That's what scares me. I mean, I'll talk and she'll listen. She'll listen to me but is she hearing me? I don't know.",
        "Ridge: I would like to think that she can hear you. I would like to think that she knows what you're going through.",
        "Liam: Who cares what I'm going through? It's what she's going through that terrifies me every day - every day she gets closer to Quinn. We got to get her out of there before it's too late, before Quinn has her so brainwashed that she can't even see the truth anymore, \u0091cause it's happening, Ridge. I see it happening.",
        "Ridge: Well, then I will have to see that it doesn't happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Eric: Are you alright?",
        "Steffy: Uh, yeah, it's just one of those days. Ok, let's begin.",
        "Eric: I know that Wyatt wants to give a presentation, but first I want you to know something. I've very aware of how difficult this assignment was for you, to move out of Liam's. But I think very necessary for your position.",
        "Steffy: Granddad, my relationship with Liam isn't part of the agenda for this meeting, so let's start ok?",
        "Eric: Alright, Wyatt? The floor is yours.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. [Clears throat] So...Why are we doing this? Why am I working so hard on creating an online community that has already exceeded any of our expectations? Is it to simply make Steffy the face of Forrester with her intelligence and her beauty and her elegance? Yeah, it's part of it. But there's something more. The brand of Forrester creations. And as enchanting as that brand will be with Steffy in the forefront, it plays a function, and that very important function can be summed up with one word. Sales.",
        "[Music]",
        "Woman: Steffy Forrester. Like you, no ordinary woman.",
        "Man: Steffy Beverly Hills.",
        "Woman: Steffy. Like you, an individual with hopes and dreams.",
        "Man: Steffy Beverly Hills.",
        "Woman: And like you, they're all coming true. Steffy Beverly Hills.",
        "Wyatt: Reaction?",
        "Steffy: A new product line? Don't we go through R&D?",
        "Wyatt: Well I kind of already did.",
        "Steffy: Without telling the C.E.O.?",
        "Wyatt: I mean I wanted to. I just - I also wanted it to be a surprise, too.",
        "Steffy: Well it certainly is. I'm blown away. [chuckles] I am blown away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm worried about Steffy the same way you are. We got to get her out of this woman's orbit.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well she's getting sucked into it more and more. It started with the C.E.O. position, which by the way, I can't even believe she considered that after everything Quinn put us through.",
        "Ridge: Oh, come on. I get that. It was an opportunity for Steffy. And Quinn gets that, too.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Then she scored a job for her son, who made Steffy a star, so let's count here. Quinn's got fame, she's got power, she's got money, she got influence, and she has Eric cheering for her from the sidelines. I mean this is genius. It's terrifying. Steffy's changing, and it's gradual, but it's happening. More and more, she's beginning to accept Quinn into her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So Steffy, what do you think?",
        "Steffy: You did this all on your own?",
        "Wyatt: Well, Mom did help me with the fragrance samples.",
        "Eric: Wyatt and Quinn have been working on this behind the scenes for quite some time.",
        "Steffy: You knew about this?",
        "Eric: I know about everything. I know most especially how things are going with you and how you're feeling.",
        "Wyatt: The pitch. Um, we are creating a brand. Well, you are. Here.",
        "Steffy: Hmm. Has a little bit of lilac. I like this.",
        "Wyatt: The nose knows.",
        "Steffy: You didn't give me any hints about this.",
        "Wyatt: You're the C.E.O. You got a full plate on your hands. It's why you hire professionals like me to take care of things.",
        "Eric: Steffy, I've looked over the deal. It's very generous actually, and provides a lot of growth not only for you line, but for Forrester Creations, as well.",
        "Steffy: A million dollars?",
        "Wyatt: That's just to start.",
        "Steffy: My own brand.",
        "Wyatt: You are the brand, Steffy. You're the influencer. Which has made my job pretty easy, actually. People are inspired by you. They follow you because you're incredible. You radiate fun and love and confidence and power. That is everything that every woman wants to be, and that is what every man wants to be around. And I can think of one in particular. Your husband.",
        "Ridge: It's not over, Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, it sure is drifting in that direction, isn't it? I've never felt this way with Steffy before. She's loyal to me. She is. But she's still human, and I am losing her.",
        "Ridge: I'm working on that.",
        "Liam: What if Quinn's toying with you? That's what she does. And it could go on for a very long time. She's taunting and she's teasing, but she never crosses the line.",
        "Ridge: She will cross the line. And when she does, her whole world's gonna fall apart. And my dad is never gonna look at her the same way again.",
        "Eric: We're a team now, Steffy. That means we feed off of each other. It means we have to stay close.",
        "Steffy: Stay close?",
        "Eric: Again, Steffy... move in here. You've already moved out of Liam's.",
        "Steffy: The only thing that's really changed is that I'm not living here. And the moment the divorce is final, I'm gonna come right back to you and we're gonna pick up right where we left off. It's my promise to you.",
        "Eric: Look, this house -- this house has spawned so many wonderful chapters in the history of our company. This could be the best one ever.",
        "Quinn: If we all work together.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I-I know that it's a lot to absorb. Believe me, they just dropped it on me before the meeting. But then I thought about it, and... I think it's a great idea. Plus I-I get to live with my wife again.",
        "Liam: Every minute that I spent missing you was a minute closer to this moment. Marry me. That's the adventure. It never gets old with you. Despite every horrible thing that has happened, I am back and I am not giving up on you again. I can't picture my life without you.",
        "Eric: Steffy, there's something I want you to see. Steffy, look. This house... this home can be yours one day, and it will be if you do this with us now. And this portrait of you will go over this mantel.",
        "Quinn: Steffy, I-I know that you've been guarded, especially when it comes to me. But I hope you can see by now that I really do love your grandfather. We're good for each other, and we can be good for you, too.",
        "Eric: Think back, Steffy, to what was good about being married to Wyatt. You can remember that. Think about how good it would be to be married to him again.",
        "Wyatt: I remember how you changed my life. And they were some of the happiest days that I have ever had. And I-I always thought we'd be together, and I-I still do. I still think we can. I have always had this interesting relationship with my mother where I love her and I also want to strangle her at the same time. [Chuckles] I kind of felt that way when they sprung you moving in here today. I know that you think that my mother manipulated our marriage, and she did. And I understand why you feel the way you do about her and her actions in the past. But you didn't think she could change, but she has. Look at her. Look -- look at your grandfather. Look at how happy they are. They are good together. And my mother -- my mother's the one who came between us and nothing else. You and I are damn good together, too, and you cannot deny that. So I'm just -- I'm asking for another chance, just to give it another try.",
        "Eric: Steffy, we're the power of Forrester Creations. There is nothing the four of us cannot accomplish together. Give your marriage to Wyatt another go.",
        "Quinn: What do you say, Steffy?",
        "Eric: Move home. Come on.",
        "Quinn: Move back up here. You -- you belong here in this house up on the hill with your grandfather and your husband.",
        "Wyatt: God, I want to be with you. I want to support you in everything that you do in your life. I... there is nothing that you and I cannot accomplish together. Nothing. With family by our side, people who love you, you can do anything. We cannot fail. So just come -- come back to me. This is where you belong, my wife. Just give me another chance.",
        "Liam: Your dad, Quinn, Wyatt. It's like they're ganging up on me, tempting her, offering her the world. Don't fall for it, Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: This is your home. Come home to us, Steffy. Come home to me.",
