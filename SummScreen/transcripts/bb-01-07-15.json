        "With his voice breaking, Rick tells Caroline that he can not put this past him. Why did this have to be with Ridge? She says yes he can put this past him. They do not have to let this destroy them. They can go away to Paris or New York and put this behind them. He says no, he has a company to run. She counters that she is trying to save a marriage which is more important. Eric blames himself. He forced Rick's hand by making him go back to Caroline. He needed time not an ultimatum. Ivy tells Maya that she needs to slow down and wait for Eric to get home before making any big decisions. Maya retorts that the papers are signed and Rick is in command and she is the woman behind the man. And Ivy should be more careful with what she is saying. Maya says she knows she is excited but so would anyone else be. She has waited a long time just scraping by and now she gets to live with Rick in the mansion. She is living her dream and so can everybody else. Ivy tells her at least wait until Rick comes home. Maya reminds her they have waited a long time, been apart at the holidays, stealing moments at the apartment yearning for each other. Disgusted, Ivy says she is going to her room. Maya tells her wait up, she and Ivy will not be spending the night in their rooms. It is hers and Rick's first night in the main house and they want their privacy. Ivy is shocked even though Maya says it is only for one night and she will put them up in a really nice hotel. Ivy wants to wait until Rick comes home and hear it from him. Maya says perhaps it is a bit too fast for Ivy but the pace is just right for her and Rick. Eric tells Ridge that Rick needs to be brought to his senses. This thing with Maya is just a passing fancy. Ridge says good luck with that. She really loves Rick and he is convinced she is the only person he can trust. Eric says maybe so but his heart is still with Caroline and he believes in those two.",
        "With tears in his eyes, Rick says it's not that easy. He loved Caroline. He wanted it more than anything. He lay there with her night after night and wanted to touch her. He did not want to see her suffer but every time he thought of touching her, his mind went to Ridge. She broke her loyalty to him. Eric tells Ridge that he is supposed to be leaving for Europe to meet up with John. Ridge tells him go ahead. He will not mix it up with Rick, he promises. He does not know what will happen to Caroline. He is hoping Rick will wake up and realize what an incredible wife he has but he can not guarantee that. She's very talented and special, they work well together. They are able to create better than they can on their own. Rick muses to Caroline that trust, loyalty and commitment, that's what he needed from her and she let him down. She declares she can be all those things again but just don't throw this away over one little mistake. He reminds her it was a mistake with the wrong man and he never would have known it except for Maya telling him the truth. Caroline says Maya made it sound worse than it was. Rick says it was a betrayal pure and simple and he tried to let it slide. Caroline says Maya is just his fallback, he doesn't love her. She has been targeting him from the start. She begs him to forget Maya and they can still have children the way they planned. He says he did want children but he can not forget what she did. Their marriage is over. He takes off his wedding ring and lays it on the table. It is over. He could never trust her again. He says goodbye. She says it is not over for her but picks up the ring and leaves. Eric confronts Rick and asks him why. Rick says because Eric would not have signed the papers unless he did it this way. Eric had made it very clear that he had to have Caroline by his side, but she was too busy with Ridge. He could never run a company with someone he could not trust much less be married to her. He trusts Maya and is not using her. And she would never do to him what Caroline did. Ridge asks Caroline if she talked to Rick. She mumbles yes, it is officially over. He took off his ring. Ridge is sorry but she says it is not his fault. She created this and she is not sure he will get over Maya like Ridge thinks. He says Caroline is a tough one to pluck from one's mind. He also tells her that he is going to Paris and keep out of Rick's hair for him to think things through. Caroline admits she does not want him to leave. He says she does not need him; they can still design and communicate on the internet. Rick will come back. Ridge says he likes to hear her laugh; makes him happy. He'd love to tell her to leave the guy and come with him and they will find a place but he isn't. Her commitment to him is extraordinary. And she is extraordinary. She tells him that he is every woman's unattainable dream. He's so handsome and confident and it would be so easy for her to go with him. But she is not going to give up on her marriage and that is what got her in this mess in the first place. It's her fault and she knew at the time that Ridge was the one guy she could not cross the line with and she did. Yet she still believes she can have that future with Rick. Ridge says okay. Maya welcomes Rick home and he shares martinis with her. She says it is potent but if that is what they serve at the mansion on the hill she will learn to like them. Then she is shocked when Rick shows her the portrait over the fireplace, replacing Stephanie with one of Maya. He says he could not stand watching those disapproving eyes. He thinks this is a vast improvement. Maya isn't sure. She says she is a guest in this house, not an institution like that one. He says she will be one soon. She'd like him to take it down until then as she has not earned it. He says he would not be where he is now without her loyalty and support. This is her home now. Good things happen to good people and she has worked hard for this dream. He thinks it is damn time that dream came true."

        "Rick: I can't. [Voice breaking] I can't just put this behind me.",
        "Caroline: God, yes, you can, Rick. Yes, you can.",
        "Rick: Ridge! Why did it have to be Ridge?!",
        "Caroline: Would you just listen to me? Don't let this destroy us. We can -- we can go away. We can go -- we can go to paris or new York. We can put this all behind us.",
        "Rick: How? I'm running a company, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: And I'm trying to save a marriage. What's more important to you?",
        "Eric: I forced Rick's hand. Told him if he wanted to run the company, he'd have to patch up his marriage with Caroline. He needed time, not an ultimatum.",
        "Ridge: I know you're trying, dad, but what he did was indefensible.",
        "Eric: I agree. But I can see very clearly what he was thinking.",
        "Ridge: Oh, no. Me, too. He was thinking like an angry little boy. And now he has the company and control over every single one of us.",
        "Eric: Yeah. He and Maya.",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I-I -- this is so much. I got to wrap my head around all of this.",
        "Ivy: Okay, I don't think you need to be making any big decisions until Eric gets home.",
        "Maya: The papers are signed. Rick is in command, and I am the woman behind the man.",
        "Ivy: No doubt about that. I mean, you have been planning this for a while now, haven't you, so --",
        "Maya: I would be careful if I were you, Ivy",
        "Ivy: Maya, is this how it's gonna be from now on?",
        "Maya: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little excited. Wouldn't you be? I have spent my entire life scraping by, just trying to survive, and I finally get to live with Rick in this mansion. I am living my dream, Ivy, and you can be a part of it. Everyone can.",
        "Ivy: I just think you should give it some time.",
        "Maya: Yeah. You hope it's all gonna come crashing down, that Rick and Caroline are gonna walk through that door, arm in arm.",
        "Ivy: I think it would be prudent for you to wait until Rick gets home.",
        "Maya: Why?",
        "Ivy: To see how this washes out.",
        "Maya: Ivy, Rick and I have been waiting for this moment for a long time. We have been stealing moments away in that apartment, going through the holidays alone, yearning for each other.",
        "Ivy: Yes. While Rick was living a lie with Caroline.",
        "Maya: Don't even get me started on that. She made her bed.",
        "Ivy: Ugh. Okay. I-I-I'm gonna go to my room. Just call me whenever Rick gets home.",
        "Maya: Uh, Ivy -- Ivy, hold on. You and Aly won't be staying here tonight.",
        "Ivy: What?!",
        "Maya: It's our first night in the main house. Rick and I are gonna want some privacy.",

        "Ridge: Good luck with that.",
        "Eric: No, this -- this business with Maya is just a passing thing.",

        "Ridge: She loves Rick. And he's convinced that she is the only person he can trust.",
        "Eric: As much as she's been a help to him, and as much as he's been depending on her, his heart is still with Caroline. I believe in those two.",
        "Rick: It's not that easy, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Nothing is easy. But if you want it badly enough --",
        "Rick: Oh, come on! I wanted it more than anything! Because I loved you that much. Do you think it's easy for me, lying next to you every night? I wanted to reach out to you. I didn't like to see you suffer, I just -- every time I got close to you, I just -- I couldn't help but think about --",
        "Caroline: God, please, don't say it. Just don't say it.",
        "Rick: And I tried to put it behind me. I tried to think about our future. I tried to think -- I tried to think about our kids. I tried to think about holidays and vacations and sharing the company, running the company. That was -- that was my plans. That was -- that was our plans. And I thought that you shared that with me. No, I knew that you shared that with me, but you didn't. And the one thing that I needed from you most was loyalty. And you broke that pact. You broke it.",
        "Eric: I'm supposed to be leaving for Europe to meet up with john.",
        "Ridge: Well, then go. Go play with your brother. And don't worry. I'm not gonna mix it up with Rick. I-I promise you. Trust me.",
        "Eric: What's gonna happen with Caroline?",
        "Ridge: That, I don't know. I-I'm hoping that Rick wakes up and see what an incredible wife he has, but I can't guarantee that.",
        "Eric: She's very special.",
        "Ridge: She's talented.",
        "Eric: Yes, well, we need the both of you, Ridge. You two work really well together. I almost wish you didn't.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] That would make it easier, wouldn't it? But you're right. What we -- we create together is so much better than anything we can do on our own.",
        "Ivy: You're kicking us out of our own home? Aly and me?",
        "Maya: Just for one night so Rick and I can celebrate in private.",
        "Ivy: Where are we supposed to go?",
        "Maya: I'll arrange a really nice hotel for you.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my go-- Maya, you are moving so fast.",

        "Rick: Trust, loyalty, commitment -- that's what is needed from you. And you let me down.",
        "Caroline: I can be all of those things again. Please just don't throw everything away because of one mistake.",
        "Rick: A mistake with the wrong man, Caroline. A secret that you kept until Maya told me the truth.",
        "Caroline: No, because Maya made it seem worse than it was.",
        "Rick: It was a betrayal, plain and simple. I tried to let it slide. But then I wouldn't be the man that you loved and I wouldn't be the man that loved you the way that I did.",
        "Caroline: But do you love her? You don't. Because she's just a fallback. She's a rebound. She's someone who's been targeting you from the start, Rick. Did you tell her you loved her? You haven't, have you? Rick, please, please, don't do this to us, to our future children, because you wanted to have children with me. I-I know that you did.",
        "Rick: Yes, I did. I wanted -- I wanted a family with you. Do I still want it? Maybe. But I have to forget.",
        "Caroline: No, no. You don't. You don't have to forget.",
        "Rick: Yes, I do.",
        "Caroline: No. Please. It's not over for us.",
        "Rick: It is, Caroline. It's over.",
        "Caroline: No. Not for me, it isn't.",

        "Caroline: No. It's not over. [Sniffles]",
        "Eric: Why, Rick?",
        "Rick: Because you never would have signed it if I hadn't done it this way.",
        "Eric: By tricking me? Playing me for a fool? I'm your father.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: So am I. And...I'm very disappointed.",
        "Rick: Don't be. Don't be disappointed. Because I will make you proud.",
        "Eric: How? By deceiving me again?",
        "Rick: Look, you made it very clear I couldn't run this company without Caroline by my side, but she was too busy being at Ridge's.",
        "Eric: You forgave her for that.",
        "Rick: No, you forgave her for that. I could never run a company with someone I don't trust... let alone be married to her.",
        "Eric: You trust Maya?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I do, dad.",
        "Eric: Just how involved are you with her?",
        "Rick: Well, I'm not using her, if that's what you mean.",
        "Eric: That's not what I asked.",
        "Rick: I'll tell you this. She would never do to me what Caroline did.",
        "Maya: Rick should be home soon.",
        "Ivy: You are so certain of his commitment to you.",
        "Maya: Rick loves me. It's hard to believe, even for me. No one's really loved me before, not like Rick. [Chuckles] I-I better get changed, you know? Get ready for Rick, help him forget about Caroline. He loves me, Ivy. I know he does.",
        "Ridge: Did you talk to him?",
        "Caroline: He, um, [Sniffles] Officially ended things.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry.",
        "Caroline: You're not to blame.",
        "Ridge: I got you into this mess.",
        "Caroline: No, I got me into this mess.",
        "Ridge: He's behaving like a spoiled little kid.",
        "Caroline: He's -- he's hurting. [Sighs] I'm just -- I'm so ready for -- I don't know. I don't know what I'm ready for. I...",
        "Ridge: He's, uh -- he's gonna get over Maya. You know that.",
        "Caroline: I don't think that he is.",
        "Ridge: You... you're a tough one to -- to pluck from someone's mind.",
        "Caroline: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm gonna go to paris for a while, make this a Ridge-free zone so Rick can figure some stuff out.",
        "Caroline: I don't want you to leave.",
        "Ridge: You don't need me here. You need me to design, we'll -- we'll communicate on the, uh -- the thing -- the interweb.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I never wanted this for you.",
        "Rick: Maya? Maya, are you here? [Sighs] Well, there she is -- Ridge's greatest champion, the indomitable Forrester matriarch. If you could only see us now.",
        "Caroline: I tried to change his mind. And I thought that I got through to him.",
        "Ridge: He'll be back.",
        "Caroline: I don't think he will. He seemed really certain, 'cause he, um -- he took off his ring.",
        "Ridge: You'll get through this. You will. Maybe all you have to do is... pour yourself into your work for now, or try.",
        "Caroline: Will you help me?",
        "Ridge: You don't need my help.",
        "Caroline: I can't -- I can't draw without you, so...",
        "Ridge: No. I can't draw without you. Remember this, right? And I can't -- I'm even -- look.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] Stop it.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I love to see you laugh. Love that -- makes me so happy. And part of me just wants to tell you, \"leave this guy and come with me and we'll find a place and we'll just be happy.\" [Sighs] But I won't. I'm not gonna do that because... your commitment to him is extraordinary. And you're extraordinary. Where's my pencil? I got to go to work. I'll see you.",
        "Caroline: You are -- you are every woman's unattainable dream. You -- God, you are so handsome. And you're confident, and I... God, I could just so easily... but that's -- that's -- that's what got me into this whole mess anyway. I mean... I'm not giving up on my marriage. It all started with me and it's my fault and I-I knew it. I knew that you were the one man that I just couldn't cross the line with, and I-I did. My plans with Rick and our -- our future and our...children -- I-I believed that it was gonna happen. I... and maybe that makes me some romantic fool, but I-I still believe it.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Maya: You're home. [Chuckles] Exhausted?",
        "Rick: Oh, yes, yes. Well, I've been getting things ready upstairs.",
        "Rick: I poured us some martinis.",
        "Maya: Okay, if this is what we drink in the house on the hill.",
        "Rick: Well, yeah.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Cheers.",
        "Maya: Mmm. [Coughs] Potent. [Clears throat]",
        "Rick: I can fix you something else.",
        "Maya: No. No. I will get used to it. I'm starting to feel at home already.",
        "Rick: Nice.",
        "Maya: So... did you talk to Caroline? She tried to talk you out of it, right?",
        "Rick: Nothing's gonna change my mind. We're gonna run this company together.",
        "Maya: Now this feels like home.",
        "Rick: Speaking of home...",
        "Maya: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: [Clears throat]",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] Okay, where are we going?",
        "Rick: Ta-da!",
        "Rick: I couldn't handle Stephanie looking down at us with those disapproving eyes. I think it's a vast improvement.",
        "Maya: If you say so.",
        "Rick: You don't agree?",
        "Maya: I'm a guest in this house, Rick. I'm not an institution like that one.",
        "Rick: Well, not yet, but you will be soon.",
        "Maya: Okay, well...until then, why don't we just take it down?",
        "Rick: Why?",
        "Maya: It just doesn't feel right, like I haven't quite earned it.",
        "Rick: Your loyalty, your support -- I wouldn't be where I am without you. This is your home now. This is our home. Good things happen to good people, Maya. You've worked hard for this dream. I think it's about damn time that that dream starts to come true."
