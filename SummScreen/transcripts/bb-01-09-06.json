        "Ridge: You and James \r\nWarwick? You telling me you two had sex? ",
        "Taylor: That's all it was. \r\nThat's it. It was nothing more. It wasn't making love. There wasn't a \r\nrelationship -- it only happened the one time, when we were trapped in the cabin \r\ntogether. ",
        "Ridge: And how long ago \r\nwas that? So why am I just hearing about this now? ",
        "",
        "Bridget: Thank you. The \r\nsoup was so good. ",
        "Nick: Thanks. ",
        "Bridget: I just don't want \r\nyou waiting on me, hand and foot. ",
        "Nick: Yes you do. \r\n",
        "Bridget: Okay, maybe I do, \r\njust a little bit. ",
        "Nick: By the way, what are \r\nyou making there? ",
        "Bridget: Something pink \r\nand soft. ",
        "Nick: Perfect. ",
        "[Teapot whistling] I'll \r\nget the tea. ",
        "Bridget: Thanks. So, what \r\nelse did my mom say? ",
        "Nick: Nothing much more \r\nthan what I told you. I was in a hurry to get home. ",
        "Bridget: What does she \r\nthink Ridge is going to do? ",
        "Nick: You know what, \r\nBridget? His wife is his business. I don't really care. ",
        "Bridget: Honey, I'm not \r\ntrying to grill you. ",
        "Nick: I know, you can ask \r\nme anything you want. ",
        "Bridget: It's just that \r\nyou've been so attentive and completely loving and aware of what I need and what \r\nI feel. I want to be there for you, too. ",
        "Nick: You are. ",
        "Bridget: I'm really \r\ntrying. But I feel like there's part of your thoughts that you don't feel you \r\ncan share with me, without me freaking out. I just want you to know that you \r\ncan. Talk to me. You know, about my mother and what you guys talk about when you \r\nsee each other. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: There's something \r\nyou're not saying. ",
        "Stephanie: I think I got \r\nmy message over. ",
        "Brooke: So Taylor's with \r\nRidge right now. ",
        "Stephanie: At this hour? \r\nOf course. ",
        "Brooke: And she's telling \r\nhim everything. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, because \r\nthat's the kind of relationship they have. ",
        "Brooke: So I guess Taylor \r\nbeing dressed in underwear with a cute fireman -- I mean, that shouldn't do too \r\nmuch damage, right? ",
        "Stephanie: They're going \r\nto be fine. ",
        "Brooke: Well then, what \r\ndoes it matter what I do or don't do? Why do you come here and huff and puff and \r\nthreaten to blow the house down if I don't stay away? ",
        "Stephanie: Because you \r\nwill throw yourself at him, if you think that there's the slightest chance.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I don't need to \r\nsee Ridge. Only at work, or when he comes to see Hope and R.J. not even when \r\nTaylor threw him out of the house. And you know that. No, you're worried that \r\nRidge is going to throw himself at me. And not over one little kiss. What else \r\nhas our precious little Taylor been guilty of, huh? ",
        "",
        "Taylor: I want things back \r\nthe way they were. The way they used to be. Do you remember? ",
        "Ridge: I guess I never \r\nreally knew what we had, or didn't have. ",
        "Taylor: It was the most \r\nprecious thing in the world to me. You were my best friend, I could tell you \r\nanything. Anything in the world. You were the person that I would tell it to. \r\nWhat happened to that Ridge now? I just -- I don't know why, I just feel like \r\nI'm making the right impression for you all the time, or something. ",
        "Ridge: We all have our own \r\ninsecurities, don't we? ",
        "Taylor: Well, mine haven't \r\nbeen little. Brooke taking my place, and then raising my children. And then \r\nfeeling like the only reason we even got back together was out of a mistake, \r\nbecause of a heart attack that didn't even happen. Ridge, I feel like I've had \r\nto be the perfect wife, the perfect mother, every day, or else I'd lose you. I \r\nhave felt so alone in this marriage. I know I felt alone partly because of what \r\nI held back about James and me. Get angry! Blame me! Go ahead! I can stand it! I \r\ncan take whatever it takes to rebuild this marriage! Just tell me that's what \r\nyou want too, Ridge. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: You wouldn't be \r\nhere, if you weren't really worried -- about what? ",
        "Stephanie: About you, \r\nspreading vicious gossip. ",
        "Brooke: No, that is your \r\nstyle, not mine. All I care about is that Taylor come clean with Ridge. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: Which she's \r\ndoing, because she's that kind of woman. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, really? I'm \r\nnot so sure. You're Ridge's mother, for God's sakes. What are you helping her \r\nhide behind his back? My God, Taylor is having an affair with hector! \r\n",
        "Stephanie: No! No! \r\nHector's a perfectly lovely guy. She's not interested in him. ",
        "Brooke: Well then, who?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Look, you're \r\njust grasping at straws because you're hoping that Ridge will be yours for the \r\ntaking again. You asked me why I came over here. I came over here to tell you \r\nthat he isn't. ",
        "Brooke: It's up to Ridge \r\nto decide what he'll live with, and what he won't. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, it isn't \r\ngoing to be you, so don't get your hopes up. Taylor may have made a mistake, but \r\nshe's a better woman than you've ever been. You're not the real thing, honey, \r\nand you never will be. ",
        "",
        "Ridge: You had feelings \r\nfor James? ",
        "Taylor: No, no, he was a \r\nfriend. He was a colleague. He was someone I respected and I looked up to. What \r\nhappened would've never even happened any other way. Ridge, he was so badly \r\ninjured, you remember that. He thought he was going to die, and he started \r\ntelling me things. You can only imagine things that he was dreaming that he'd \r\nnever get to do, and he even told me that he had never been intimate with a \r\nwoman. I don't know, it was like -- a dying request or something. I don't know \r\nwhy I said yes. ",
        "Ridge: I remember arriving \r\nwith the rescue team, I remember how mangled his leg was. The whole thing looked \r\nso desperate. ",
        "Taylor: It was desperate. \r\nThat's exactly what it was. ",
        "Ridge: And yet, neither of \r\nyou gave any indication about this. ",
        "Taylor: I guess the \r\nprospect of dying and what it made us say and do -- it's like in a sense when, \r\nwe got our life back, it cancelled it out. ",
        "Ridge: Right. Right.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Okay, right, what? \r\nWhat? What, ask me anything, ask me. I'll tell you, I'll tell you everything.\r\n",
        "Ridge: I really don't need \r\nto hear anymore about James. ",
        "Taylor: Okay, then let's \r\njust talk. Let's talk about anything. I don't know, maybe there's something you \r\nwant to talk to me about? Something you haven't been able to? ",
        "Ridge: Like what, Taylor, \r\nhuh? Like what? All these stupid things that I've done have been right out there \r\nin the open. Every major stupid thing, you've been a witness to. ",
        "Taylor: I know, I don't \r\ncut you much slack, do I? All I can do is hope you'll be more forgiving than \r\nI've ever known how to be. ",
        "",
        "[Fire crackling] \r\n",
        "Nick: Bridget. If I had \r\nanything to say about your mother, I would say it. ",
        "Bridget: What I'm trying \r\n-- what I want you know, is that the things that you think you can't say, you \r\ncan. ",
        "Nick: Honey, I just don't \r\nknow what they'd be. ",
        "Bridget: Okay. Look, \r\nthere's just two things that I really want you to understand. ",
        "Nick: Okay. ",
        "Bridget: First of all, I \r\ndon't think you would ever do anything like cheat on me. I completely trust you. \r\nI know you would never do anything behind my back, or lie to me. It's just not \r\nin your nature. So I'll never make that accusation again. ",
        "Nick: Thank you. \r\n",
        "Bridget: And secondly, I \r\nknow this can't possibly be easy for you, because the feelings you had for my \r\nmom were real, and they just don't go away overnight. I guess I used to think \r\nthat the love you had for me had to replace all the feelings, and all the love \r\nthat you ever had for my mom, or anyone else that you ever loved. And I just \r\ndon't think that's the way that love works. I get that now. I think it comes \r\nmore individually wrapped, so that the love you give to someone, they get to \r\nkeep -- it's just theirs. I know that we're going to get to have a family in the \r\nfuture that we've planned. I know that with all my heart, and I love you. And I \r\nwant to share everything, even the hard things. ",
        "Nick: You know, Bridget, \r\nthis is a very strange situation. And your mother's always going to be a part of \r\nour lives. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well that's \r\ntrue. ",
        "Nick: And I don't think \r\nI'm ever going to be able to look at her as a mother-in-law. You know that, too.\r\n",
        "Bridget: I know. I don't \r\nexpect you to have to do that. ",
        "Nick: Okay. ",
        "[Knock at the door]\r\n",
        "Bridget: Come on it, mom.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I hope \r\nI'm not interrupting. ",
        "Bridget: No. No, no, no. \r\nWe ate, and we're fine, I mean -- what's wrong? Are you okay? ",
        "Brooke: Uh, yeah. Yeah, \r\njust -- Stephanie showed up at my house. ",
        "Bridget: Was it about \r\nTaylor? Nick told me what you walked in on. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: Yes. She warned me \r\nto stay away from Ridge. And she told me not to tell him anything about Hector. \r\nAt least, that's what I thought she meant. I mean, if all they did was just kiss \r\n-- ",
        "Bridget: \"All?\" \r\n",
        "Brooke: Well, I know. I \r\nknow. But I'm sure they will work through that -- if that's all they did. \r\n",
        "Bridget: But Taylor -- I \r\nmean, mom, do you honestly believe that she's just been -- ",
        "Brooke: Do I think that \r\nshe's been fooling around behind ridge's back? No. At least I didn't. But it \r\nseems like Stephanie thinks so. ",
        "Bridget: And she's said \r\nthat? ",
        "Brooke: No, but it's the \r\nonly thing that seems to make any sense. She believes that their marriage is \r\nfalling apart. So she doesn't want me anywhere near Ridge. ",
        "",
        "Taylor: You're not saying \r\nanything. ",
        "Ridge: You never answered \r\nmy question. Why am I just hearing about this now? ",
        "Taylor: Because I was \r\nafraid. ",
        "Ridge: Of what? \r\n",
        "Taylor: Of losing you.\r\n",
        "Ridge: Of losing me, or \r\nsomething else? ",
        "Taylor: I don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Ridge: Taylor, when I look \r\nback at our history, everything that I've ever done, it was all based on me \r\nseeing you as a certain kind of person. A certain kind of person that would just \r\nnot do what you did. ",
        "Taylor: I tried to tell \r\nyou. That was my first impulse, Ridge. I wrote you a letter. I left it out for \r\nyou, but Stephanie intercepted it. ",
        "Ridge: All these years, \r\nand mother knew too? ",
        "Taylor: I don't know. All \r\nI know is, maybe she was trying to protect our marriage. I'm not going to stand \r\nhere and make excuses for her. ",
        "Ridge: Why would she \r\nprotect you and not me? ",
        "Taylor: Ridge -- \r\n",
        "Ridge: Just making it okay \r\nfor you to have sex with another man? Is that protecting our relationship, our \r\nmarriage? ",
        "Taylor: Is that how you \r\nfeel, like I got away with something? ",
        "Ridge: Well, didn't you? \r\nWhen I told you I still had feelings for Brooke, you were outraged. You made it \r\nseem like a character flaw in me. Did it ever once occur to you that maybe what \r\nyou had done -- ",
        "Taylor: I know, to think \r\nthat what I had done, was worse. ",
        "Ridge: Taylor, I was never \r\nunfaithful, I -- did it occur to you? Did you think about it? ",
        "Taylor: I put it \r\ncompletely out of my mind. And then sometimes in the night, it would come back \r\nto me, Ridge. I can't tell you what I've been living with. And the shame of it \r\nwould just grip me like an electric shock or something and I just couldn't stand \r\nit, I thought I was going crazy, and I'd have to put it out of my mind! Just \r\nforget about it, pretend like it didn't even happen! I'm not proud of it! \r\n",
        "Ridge: Do you understand \r\nwhat you just told me? That you knew you've been condemning me all these years \r\nfor something that was not nearly so bad. And all you could do was just want to \r\nput it out of your mind. ",
        "",
        "Nick: You know what, if \r\nyou don't mind, I'm going to leave the gossiping to you two -- ",
        "Bridget: No honey, stay, \r\nstay. Look, when I think of all the names that Stephanie's called you over the \r\nyears, it just makes me so angry to think that she's covering up for Taylor.\r\n",
        "Brooke: Maybe I'm wrong. \r\nMaybe there is no big secret affair. She probably just needed a punching bag.\r\n",
        "Bridget: When I think \r\nabout it, that marriage has been in trouble from the very beginning. I have all \r\nsorts of respect for Taylor, but when she found out that Stephanie's heart \r\nattack was an act, she should have backed down from those deathbed wedding vows.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I certainly can't \r\nhold her responsible for Stephanie's lies. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, Mom, come on. \r\nI mean, look -- if someone robs a bank, and they give you the cash, and then you \r\nturn around and arrest them, or help arrest them for robbing the bank that you \r\nkeep the cash -- I don't think so. That doesn't make any sense, and that's \r\nexactly what Taylor did. You've been robbed. ",
        "Nick: So have your kids.\r\n",
        "Bridget: Yeah, and if they \r\ncan get their father back -- I mean, if things are as bad in that house as \r\nStephanie thinks they are, then there could be another chance for you and Ridge.\r\n",
        "",
        "Taylor: I'm not being \r\nfair. It was a fantasy to think that you would just stand there and listen \r\nquietly and then just forgive me. I know you need time. ",
        "Ridge: You've had years.\r\n",
        "Taylor: True. ",
        "Ridge: I don't need years. \r\nI don't even need a day. I don't really understand why you let Hector come back \r\nup into this room. You told me that would never happen again. ",
        "Taylor: I told you Ridge, \r\nI was feeling abandoned. It was the holidays, and you weren't here. ",
        "Ridge: Well, why not do \r\nwhat I do? Why don't you just yell at me? I may be thick, but I get it \r\neventually. You know, I'm not going to come unglued because you kissed some guy. \r\nEven if it's some guy I dislike as much as him . You and hector seem to have a \r\nlot in common, actually. ",
        "Taylor: He seems to think \r\nso. I don't see it. ",
        "Ridge: Maybe it's the \r\nhalo. I'm glad you didn't leave me a letter this time about James. I remember \r\nvery well what happened when we found you guys up there. You were half frozen, \r\nstarved. Black blood all down James' side. Whatever happened between you two \r\ndidn't seem like a beautiful sacrifice you were making for a good friend. It \r\nseemed repulsive. I don't know why you did what you did. You thought he was \r\ndying, well -- if he was dying, he wasn't going to get to experience a lot of \r\nthings, that's the definition of dying. But hey, it happened, I wasn't there, so \r\nif you want forgiveness for all that, then you got it. ",
        "Taylor: Thank you. Thank \r\nyou. You have no idea how hard it's been holding it in all these years. \r\n",
        "Ridge: You think I was \r\ngoing to end our relationship over something like this? ",
        "Taylor: I didn't know. All \r\nI knew was that I've never been unfaithful. I never felt unfaithful. Not \r\nunloved. That, I never betrayed. ",
        "Ridge: Never? Not in that \r\nhalf hour with James, maybe, but what about all the years in between? \r\n",
        "Taylor: I don't understand \r\nthe question. ",
        "Ridge: What about all the \r\nhypocrisy? What about \"Taylor the good?\" \"Taylor the virtuous?\" Holding all of \r\nus up to this standard of yours. What about the way you treated me? What about \r\nthe way you treated Brooke? The years of disdain, and condescension? That, I \r\ndon't understand, Taylor. That, I can never -- I can never forgive. "
