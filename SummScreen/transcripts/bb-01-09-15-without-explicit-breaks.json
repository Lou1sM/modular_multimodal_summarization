    "Recap": [
        "Rick starts to go get a dustpan and broom. He states that Maya likes to walk around barefooted sometimes and he doesn't want her to cut her tiny feet. Caroline can not believe he let her put that picture up. He says she didn't. That was his little housewarming gift. She shows scorn that this is the reason he invited her here so she would be sure to see the portrait. He reminds her that she called him and wanted to talk. She says yes because it is not too late for them if he would just allow her to sit and talk this through. Instead he is moving on with his life with Maya and even putting up her portrait. Rick says Ridge was always Stephanie's favorite son .the Marone bastard son she always tried to pass off as a Forrester. If his dad wants to look at her disapproving looks that is fine but he is not here now, he is. And he happens to like that picture as it reminds him there are still some honest people in this world. Caroline begs him not to do this. He does not love Maya. He invited her here just to see her suffer. He wanted her to see the portrait so Caroline could see the pedestal he put Maya on. So yes she is hurt and his plan worked but not the way he thought it would. Shutting her out now is not the way. He can not turn to Maya and expect all his feelings for Caroline to just go away overnight. He shouts that she betrayed him with the one man She says and now he has hurt her but they can get through this. All he has to do is break up with Maya, take that picture down and come home. She begs him but he walks out the door. Othello calls Maya to see how things are going. She tells him about the portrait and he says Rick has made some bad choices in the past but it looks like he is finally with the one who will stay committed and she deserves being the lady of the manor. Liam brings Ivy a latte. She thanks him but says she is more excited about the cute delivery boy. She asks him to give her a second as she has some backorders with more work since his brother went to Italy. Liam asks if Wyatt has been in touch as he has not heard from him. She says he responded to her e-mail only about work but she knows nothing concerning Hope if that is what Liam is asking about. He says he just hopes all is okay with them. She seems distracted then finally fills him in on what Rick is doing at home. She muses that Maya is just using Rick. She is only interested in getting that last name. He admits that Rick has done all kinds of wrong and is on the rebound and Maya is on a real power trip but they used to have genuine feelings for each other. Ivy and Caroline may be surprised that there is much more to that relationship. Maya comes downstairs and asks Caroline to what does she owe this honor. Rick goes to the office and asks Ivy if they can re-schedule their meeting for tomorrow then he says hello to Liam and asks how is it having Caroline stay with him. And if she needs more of her things he can have them sent over. He says he knows she was a little thrown by the portrait of Maya but it is a big house and he'd like them to all get along peacefully so whatever she can do to facilitate that he would appreciate. Ivy says okay but she sort of feels like kicking her and Aly out the very first night was not a good start. She adds he is moving on with Maya too quickly and adopting this \"Maya walks on water\" policy they have to accept at work tells her one thing that he still wants to be with Caroline. He says it tells him one thing too, that he is with Maya now and they all need to respect that. Maya tells Caroline that she is making too big a deal about the portrait. Rick wants it there. Caroline says Maya should think of Rick's reputation and what people will think of him hanging this monstrosity. Maya says no, she is not trying to replace Stephanie. It is just a picture and she should be glad it is not a tasteful nude, although she is not ruling that out for the bedroom. Caroline tells her that Rick only agreed to talk to her if she came here. He wanted her to see the picture, wanted her to be hurt and feel pain. But he will snap out of it soon and then where will Maya be. Rick tells Liam that why would he want to be with Caroline. She betrayed him. No his feelings have not disappeared overnight but they have evolved into something else like hate and anger and disappointment. Liam says he knows the pain Rick is going through. Rick lashes back really as he did not know Liam's wife ever cheated on him. Liam says again he knows how it feels when a relationship ends but Rick's has not. There is still a chance for him and Caroline. She still loves him and is trying to make the marriage work. Yes there were a few kisses with Ridge if he calls that cheating and she should not have done that. But she feels badly about it and regrets it and is willing to forgive Rick for much worse. That ought to count for something. Rick says he gets why Liam would support Caroline. She is his cousin. But he does not want to be with a woman who cheated on him and does not support him. He chooses to live his life with a woman who is supportive of his needs and he sees that every time he looks into Maya's eyes. She believes in him and that is exactly what he needs.",
        "Maya tells Caroline that she does not disagree with her. Caroline lied to him and betrayed him so yes Rick is rightfully upset. He wanted to hurt Caroline and that is part of the reason he hung the picture. But she suggests when that desire is gone she is not worried where she stands. His needs are simple \u0096 he wants support, appreciation and loyalty and Caroline failed on all of those. Maya is the woman he deserves. And Rick has earned the right to put up the picture of the one woman he trusts and gives him the respect he deserves. So maybe it is time that Caroline learned that life on this planet is not all just about her. And if this picture proves anything it is that she on track to being the next leader of this family. Caroline gushes back that the picture does not prove she is the next leader of this family, just that Rick is trying desperately to push his feeling for her away. Maya says her devotion to Rick will make her a good wife. Caroline is shocked to hear her use that word. Maya says yes she will be Rick's perfect partner. She will be successful where Caroline failed. So hear her good, she will be the next Forrester matriarch."

        "Maya: Is that... Caroline's car?",
        "Ivy: Hey!",
        "Liam: Hey. Did you get my text?",
        "Ivy: Uh...no, because I forgot to... turn my phone off silent. \"Are you interested in a latte?\"",
        "Liam: Latte.",
        "Ivy: Yes. Well, I am, but not nearly as interested as I am in the cute delivery boy.",
        "Liam: Aha.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Thank you.",
        "Ivy: Hey, can you just give me two seconds?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: I just need to make sure these orders went through. I've taken on quite a bit of extra work since your brother went to Italy.",
        "Liam: Hey, has he been in touch? 'Cause I have not heard anything.",
        "Ivy: No. I sent him an e-mail that he responded to about work stuff, but apart from that... he said nothing about the hope situation, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Liam: I wish I knew what was going on. I hope they're both okay.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I guess we will find out soon enough.",
        "Liam: Did I just upset you?",
        "Ivy: No, no.",
        "Liam: Okay. You seem a little preoccupied.",
        "Ivy: Well, I -- I am. I'm -- [Sighs] But it's not because of all of -- [Sighs] You know what? I don't think you're gonna believe this.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: Something Rick's done.",
        "Liam: Oh. As CEO?",
        "Ivy: No, at home. You know that portrait of Stephanie that hangs above the fireplace?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. It's gone.",
        "Liam: It's gone?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. There's a portrait of Maya there now instead.",
        "Maya: Why is Caroline here?",
        "Caroline: I thought I heard voices! [Laughs] Oh, Myrna! What a surprise? I didn't realize that we were hiring. How could she have possibly cleared the criminal background check? So, I'm dying to know... what was the turning point?",
        "Maya: When I realized I was in over my head. Fish out of water.",
        "Caroline: Wow, you really do get it, Maya. You know, you're incredibly perceptive for somebody from -- well...your environment. I mean, what do you even know about being a spokesmodel? Have you ever walked on a runway? And clearly you know nothing about fashion, because, no offense... your outfits are embarrassing. You're out of your league. You were his walk on the wild side. Fresh out of prison. But that is all that you were, Maya. And it is all that you will ever be.",
        "Caroline: This is why you wanted me to come here. You had to make sure that I saw the picture of Maya.",
        "Rick: You're the one that wanted to talk. You called me.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, because it's not too late for us. So if you could just stop and see what you were doing, I -- I realize that you are hurting and I understand that I am to blame, but forcing yourself to move on with Maya, putting up this ridiculous picture --",
        "Rick: Ridge was always Stephanie's favorite son. Her Marone bastard she always tried to pass off as a Forrester. Well, if dad wants to look at her disapproving eyes every day of his life, that's his business. But dad's not here. I am.",
        "Caroline: Fine! Then put up the Picasso, put up the van Gogh that's in the study!",
        "Rick: I happen to like that photo of Maya! It reminds me that there's actually some honest people in this world.",
        "Caroline: Okay, yeah. Because being honest is what got Maya into your bed. She would have lied for that, too. Don't do this. You don't love her.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Maya: Hello.",
        "Othello: Yes, can I speak to the lady of the house, please?",
        "Maya: Speaking. Actually, it's more of a manor, really.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles] True. So, how you doing, princess? You settle into the castle all right?",
        "Maya: Mm, so far, so good. Even if I am a little intimidated.",
        "Othello: Yeah, right. You? Intimidated?",
        "Maya: No, really, I am. It's just settling in, you know, that Rick and I are finally here, that we can share our feelings out in the open.",
        "Othello: Patience pays off.",
        "Maya: Listen to this. You know that huge picture over the fireplace of Stephanie?",
        "Othello: Yeah, the one where I swear the eyes are moving in it?",
        "Maya: That'd be the one. Guess what Rick did.",
        "Othello: Took it down, I hope. That thing is scary. I'd put it in storage until Eric gets back from Europe if I were you.",
        "Maya: Yeah, he took it down, and he went one step further. There's a huge picture of me replacing it.",
        "Othello: Are you kidding me?",
        "Maya: No, it's crazy. I feel like I'm living a dream I don't deserve.",
        "Othello: Yes, you do. Rick's made awful choices in women over the years, and now he's finally with one who will stay committed. Support him in the way that he needs to be supported. Look, you're the only one that's been honest with him. Trust me. You deserve every bit of it.",
        "Liam: So you think Maya's just using Rick.",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Liam: I don't know.",
        "Ivy: Oh, Liam! Come on! Look, all Maya cares about is becoming the next Mrs. Rick Forrester. It has nothing to do with Rick. It's just about getting that last name.",
        "Liam: Yes, but you weren't there when they first met.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Don't tell Caroline I said any of this. But I don't know. It was sweet. It seemed like they had a genuine connection. I'm not saying that what he's doing is right. I mean, he's still married to my cousin, and Maya swooping in and hanging all over Rick when he's in pain is not cool. And replacing Stephanie's picture the day she moves in is all kinds of wrong. So, yeah, Rick is on the rebound, and Maya's got some crazy power trip going on. But I think there may be more to their relationship than you realize, and, unfortunately, more than Caroline realizes.",
        "Caroline: I know what's going on here. You're just -- you're lashing out.",
        "Rick: No. I'm moving on. You like to believe that I'm throwing some sort of tantrum, but you can't face reality. You betrayed me and now you're suffering the consequences.",
        "Caroline: See, that's what this is really about. You want me to suffer.",
        "Rick: You act like I care about your feelings. I don't.",
        "Caroline: When I asked you if we could talk, you wanted me to come here so that I could see the pedestal that you're putting Maya on. Well, your plan worked. I'm hurt. But I don't think it's helped you the way that you hoped. You want to heal from this? Well, shutting me out isn't the way. You can't just turn to Maya and expect all your feelings for me to just go away overnight.",
        "Rick: You humiliated me! You betrayed me with the one man that I can't believe you --",
        "Caroline: Okay, and now you've hurt me! We're married. This does not have to be the end for us. Rick... we can get through this. All you have to do is break up with Maya, take that thing down, and just...come home. Please. Rick. Rick!",
        "Maya: Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God.",
        "Maya: To what do I owe the pleasure?",
        "Ivy: So, Caroline is at the house now.",
        "Liam: The girl is determined to make her marriage work.",
        "Ivy: Rick.",
        "Rick: Hey, I need to postpone our meeting. Same time tomorrow?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, sure.",
        "Rick: Hi, Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Rick: How was Caroline settling into your place?",
        "Liam: Uh, fine. Good.",
        "Rick: Yeah? All right, well, if I find anything else of hers, I'll send it right on over. [Sighs] You know, um... yeah, Ivy, I know you were a little bit thrown off by that picture of Maya.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I was a little.",
        "Rick: Look, it's a big house. Not that big, but -- look. I'd really like it if we all could just live together peacefully, in harmony. So whatever you can do to help facilitate that, I would appreciate it.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Yeah, okay. Um... you know what? I -- I kind of feel like kicking Aly and me out of the house on the first night wasn't a good place to start.",
        "Rick: It was one night.",
        "Ivy: Rick, can I -- can I say one thing?",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Everything you've been doing recently -- moving on so quickly with Maya, moving her into your father's home, hanging that portrait of her on the wall, this whole \"Maya walks on water\" policy that we now have to follow here at work -- it all just tells me something.",
        "Rick: It tells me something, too. Maya and I are together now. And that needs to be respected.",
        "Ivy: See, it just tells me that you still want to be with Caroline.",
        "Maya: Are you here to see Rick? I think he should be around here somewhere.",
        "Caroline: He left.",
        "Maya: Oh. Did something break?",
        "Caroline: My glass. I was startled.",
        "Maya: Oh. Yeah. You can imagine my surprise when I saw it.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maya: No, really. I'm flattered, of course, but... never in a million years did I think I'd see my picture hanging over the fireplace in the Forrester estate in Beverly hills.",
        "Caroline: If you were so embarrassed, then why didn't you ask Rick to just take it down?",
        "Maya: I did.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God. What about his reputation?",
        "Maya: Excuse me?",
        "Caroline: What will people think?",
        "Maya: Who cares?",
        "Caroline: Who cares? Rick is married. Yet, he hangs a giant picture of his mistress in the family home, replacing Stephanie Forrester.",
        "Maya: No one's replacing Stephanie. No, Rick is just adding his touch while we're living here. You don't have to make a big deal about it.",
        "Caroline: Do you think that any of this is at all normal? The day that you move in, he hangs up this monstrosity? Are you that blind?",
        "Maya: It's just a picture. You should be thankful it's not a tasteful nude, although I'm not ruling that out for the bedroom.",
        "Caroline: When I called Rick and asked him if we could talk, he agreed, but only if I met him here.",
        "Maya: So?",
        "Caroline: He wanted me to see that.",
        "Maya: Okay?",
        "Caroline: Okay, so that verifies everything I have been thinking, that this whole situation -- you moving in, putting up that picture, flaunting your relationship at the office -- it's all for effect. He's mad at me, and he thinks that if he hurts me enough, it'll help him get through the pain. And I know that you're so happy, because you get to be queen of the castle. All of your dreams are coming true. But when Rick snaps out of it and when he stops wanting to get back at me, he'll have no use for you. And then what do you think is gonna happen?",
        "Rick: Why would I want to be with Caroline? She betrayed me.",
        "Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. Rick, come on, man. You're still married. Your feelings just don't disappear overnight.",
        "Rick: Oh, no, they haven't disappeared. They just -- they've evolved into all sorts of different feelings, like hate and anger and disappointment.",
        "Liam: I know the pain you're going through.",
        "Rick: Really? Because I don't recall your wife ever cheating on you.",
        "Liam: I -- I know the pain of a relationship ending. Let me tell you something, man. Yours hasn't. Caroline is not lost to you yet. She loves you, and she is trying to make this marriage work. Listen to me. A couple of kisses with Ridge? Yeah, you can call that cheating if you want to, and, yeah, she shouldn't have done that, but she regrets it. She feels bad about it, and she seems willing to forgive a lot worse from you. I mean, does that not count for anything?",
        "Rick: Liam, I get why you support Caroline. I mean, hell, you guys are cousins. We only get one chance at life, as far as I know. So why would I want to spend that with a woman who I could never fully trust? A woman who's so clueless to my needs that she would turn to that man? No, I choose to live my life with somebody different, somebody who's honest and supportive of my needs. And calls it like it is. That's what Maya does for me. I never have to question her loyalty, because I see it every time she looks in my eyes. She believes in me. And after everything that Caroline has put me through, that's exactly what I need.",
        "Maya: I don't disagree with you. It's true. Rick is upset with you. Because you betrayed him, you lied to him, and you fooled around with a man he never trusted. His archrival. So, yeah. He wants to hurt you. And is that part of the reason that he hung up this picture? Maybe. But when Rick's desire to punish you goes away, I'm not worried about where I stand. Because I know that his needs are simple. He wants support, appreciation, and loyalty. You failed in that department. And I am more than making up for it. I am the woman Rick deserves. You think this picture ruins his reputation? That it shames him? [Scoffs] Eric Forrester, Jr. has proven that he is the heir worthy of this home, the company, and the family. He has earned the right to put up a picture of the one woman who has given him the respect that he deserves. I appreciate him. I see how hard he works. I see his loyalty, his kindness, his generosity. Did you? Did you appreciate all that he was doing for you, between posting selfies and kissing sessions with Ridge? You say that it's easy to see what this picture proves. That it's all about you. About Rick wanting a reaction from you. Well, maybe it's time you learned that life on this planet isn't all about Caroline Spencer. If this picture proves anything, it is that I am on track to being the next leader of this family.",
        "Caroline: If this picture proves anything, it's that Rick is desperately doing anything to push his feelings for me away. And that portrait does not make you the leader of this family!",
        "Maya: No, but my actions will. And my devotion to Rick will. Becoming a wife he can count on.",
        "Caroline: A wife?!",
        "Maya: Yes! I will be Rick's perfect partner. I will succeed where you fail. Hear me and believe me, Caroline. I will be the next Forrester matriarch."
