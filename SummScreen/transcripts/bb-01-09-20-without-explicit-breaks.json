Liam phones to tell Hope that he's at Steffy's, but he's coming home to talk. Hope agrees. Brooke urges Hope to go fight for Liam, so Hope decides to leave and go talk to Liam at Steffy's. Thomas walks up and listens in on their conversation, and then he leaves. Ridge arrives at Brooke's to praise Hope for what great work she's been doing with Thomas. Brooke fills him in on what's been going on. Brooke tells Ridge that she wants him back home. Meanwhile, Thomas phones Steffy and tells her that Liam and Hope are almost over and just need a little push. He tells her that Hope is on her way, so when he calls, she needs to kiss Liam. She's shocked to hear that he still wants Hope and hasn't moved on after all. When Thomas calls Steffy's phone, she's outside with Liam, telling him how grateful she is for all the time he spends with her and Kelly. She asks for a hug, so he hugs her. The phone rings, and then she gives him a kiss. Liam kisses her back. Hope is standing there, having seen the whole thing. She looks shocked and disappointed.

        "Hope: He was so adamant about his love for me and his commitment to our family that I was so ready to say yes. But he wanted more. Liam said that he couldn't marry me... that I'd have to stop co-parenting douglas and working with thomas.",
        "Liam: I can't be married to both you and thomas. Sorry.",

        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Steffy: It must have been one exciting movie. Knocked you right out.",
        "Liam: Uh, sorry. What time is it?",
        "Steffy: Uh, time for someone to hurry up and get ready for her play group. Isn't that right, baby? Mm-ah.",
        "Liam: Thank you for letting me crash here.",
        "Steffy: Oh. Yeah. Seemed like you needed a little daddy-daughter time. Did it help?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, it did.",
        "Steffy: Is everything okay? You don't have to say anything if you don't want to.",
        "Liam: I, uh, I proposed to hope last night.",
        "Steffy: You proposed to hope, and... then you spent the night here?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Um, you know, hope, she says she wants to marry me, but, um... as long as thomas is in the picture, that just can't happen.",
        "Zoe: Thomas. [ Chuckles ] Caught the artist at work.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I wish. My, uh, my mind's somewhere else right now.",
        "Zoe: Well, maybe you should, um, take a break.",
        "Ridge: Ahem.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: At least I don't have to ask what's going on with the two of you.",
        "Zoe: Well, I was just telling thomas how grateful I am to be here.",
        "Ridge: Your presence here is good for my son.",
        "Zoe: Well, it's mutual. Well, um, I'll let you two talk 'cause actually I have to get to a fitting.",
        "Thomas: Oh. Wow. Uh, I guess I should be thanking you, too.",
        "Ridge: Why? Steffy wanted zoe back here.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, well, you know, it's always been a big part of--of the changes I've been making, but none of it would have been possible without you. And you --you dropped everything you know. I, uh, I've been making some of the best designs I've ever made and building the family for douglas that he's always deserved.",
        "Ridge: It's all I wanted.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I just, uh, I wish it would have worked out for everyone.",
        "Ridge: Haven't given up yet.",
        "Thomas: Neither have I. And I hope steffy hasn't, either.",
        "Ridge: Steffy is resilient. She'll find her way.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, well, she shouldn't have to do it alone.",
        "Ridge: Where are you going?",
        "Thomas: I, uh, I got something to handle. It can't wait.",
        "Steffy: Thanks so much. Bye, kelly. I'll see you later. Okay. Kelly is off to her play group.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: So what's going on? You proposed to hope, she accepted, but you aren't engaged.",
        "Liam: Uh, well, I mean, we will be as soon as I can convince her to get your brother out of her life. It's just been--we just-- we don't have a future as long as thomas is in it.",
        "Steffy: Well, hope and thomas are co-parenting douglas.",
        "Liam: I know. We're gonna take care of douglas. We're gonna make sure that he's safe and secure, but, uh, what I'm asking is for her to cut legal ties to him.",
        "Steffy: Hope wouldn't do it?",
        "Liam: Hope said that we should just get married and then figure all that out after, but I--I... I couldn't accept that, and... I walked out.",
        "Brooke: Honey, you can't blame yourself.",
        "Hope: I know liam is just trying to protect me.",
        "Brooke: It's not liam's fault, either. This is thomas.",
        "Hope: No, it's not, though, not for me. This is about douglas.",
        "Brooke: I know you want to be there for douglas. I know how much you love him, and I want to protect him as much as you do. But look at what thomas is doing. He's ruing your relationship with liam. He destroyed my marriage to ridge. That is thomas. That is what he wants. He manipulated you into giving him a second chance, and now he's using it against all of us.",
        "Hope: But adopting douglas wasn't a mistake, though.",
        "Brooke: Honey, you've got to go to liam. You cannot let thomas interfere in your relationship with a man that you love.",
        "Hope: I know this hasn't been an easy adjustment and liam is uncomfortable with thomas being a part of our lives.",
        "Brooke: Of course not. He's worried about you, honey. And quite frankly, so am I. I thought douglas would be safe with you in his life, but now thomas is just using that connection to drive a wedge between you and liam.",
        "Hope: I know. I know, and liam feels the same way, too.",
        "Brooke: He loves you, honey. He loves you very much.",
        "Hope: I love him, too, mom.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey. When I think of all that you've gone through to be together and how devoted you are to each other, how much you love each other, your sweet little family-- you and liam and beth-- that is what matters.",
        "Hope: I know. And I want to marry liam more than anything. I never want him to doubt my commitment to him. But I made a commitment to douglas, too, and liam didn't want to hear that, and so he just took the ring, and he left, and he walked out the door.",
        "Brooke: Okay, look, you're gonna have to go to him, and you're gonna have to tell him that you want to fight for your family, that that is the future that you want, 'cause you can see what thomas is doing. He is like a virus in this family. He just corrupts everything that is good. I know you want to be there for douglas. I know that. I know you want to save your line. But really, honey, what does that all mean if you can't have the life that you want with the person that you love?",
        "Hope: You're right. I can't lose liam.",
        "Liam: You know, I was ready. I was--I was ready to put the ring right on hope's finger. I could--I could actually see our future in front of my eyes. And I know she cares about douglas. I know she--she doesn't want him to feel abandoned, but neither do I. And thomas is using that as leverage, and she just-- hope just doesn't see it. She will not see it. And so... so I-- I left.",
        "Steffy: You weren't getting through to her.",
        "Liam: What is even happening right now? I--I'm trying to give hope the life we've always dreamed about. I--I--I'm trying to do that for her, and she just doesn't-- s-she... hey, you okay? I'm a jerk. Wow. I'M...",
        "Steffy: No. You--",
        "Liam: I am such a jerk.",
        "Steffy: No, you're not. No, you're worried about hope.",
        "Liam: Yeah. And I'm taking advantage of your diplomacy right now. I-- I'm sorry.",
        "Steffy: I want to be supportive.",
        "Liam: You have been. Oh, my god. You have been amazing. Like, you've been perfect, and I don't want to hurt your feelings, and I don't want to take advantage of you. I just-- I just really wanted to vent, and... there's nobody else on the planet I'd rather talk to than you.",

        "Brooke: Uh, no. I was in the kitchen, and before that, I was talking to hope.",
        "Ridge: Hope, yes. I actually came to see her. I wanted to tell her how impressed I am with the work she's doing with thomas.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, she just left.",
        "Ridge: Everything okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I'm not sure if I should tell you, if hope would want me to say anything. But it does have to do with your children, so I think I should probably tell you. Liam proposed to hope last night.",
        "Ridge: Oh. So they'll be married soon.",
        "Brooke: No. I mean, they do love each other, and they want to be together. But... thomas is keeping them apart.",
