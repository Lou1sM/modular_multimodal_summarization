        "Brooke: I was looking for a quiet place to work. Taylor told you. ",
        "Ridge: She didn't tell me that you knew. ",
        "Brooke: Yes, well, I walked in on them. ",
        "Ridge: Well, she told a lot of things. That wasn't one of 'em. ",
        "Brooke: You slept here. I gather your talk with taylor didn't go so well. ",
        "Laurie: Look, there are voluntary programs which have already been successful \r\nin reducing pollution from boats and ships. These changes have prevented \r\npremature death, and reduced severe respiratory disease like asthma, all over \r\nthe world. ",
        "Massimo: Laurie, I am aware of these programs, all right? And the good that \r\nthey can do. But, you have to understand -- i am a business man. I have \r\nemployees to take care of, all right? I have stock holders that I have to answer \r\nto. ",
        "Laurie: Environmental thinking and free enterprise are not mutually \r\nexclusive. ",
        "Nick: Pop, you do realize that the savings associated with these programs, \r\nespecially in terms of health costs, is huge. ",
        "Massimo: Fine. But it doesn't show up on my bottom line. ",
        "Nick: Well, it's going to show up eventually. Our regulations are getting \r\ntougher. Our manufacturers want products that don't pollute. We're going to lose \r\ncustomers, we're going to wind up retrofitting. But think about it -- it's going \r\nto cost us a hell of a lot less in the long run. It's our environment, this is \r\nour world, our world we're handing off to our children -- our grandchildren. Now \r\nyou tell me how we measure that cost. ",
        "[Knock at the door] ",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? Taylor? Oh good, you're home. God, I've been so worried. \r\nDid you get my messages? ",
        "Taylor: No. It was good to have ridge home. Even better than I thought it \r\nwould be. He even apologized for staying away for so long. And we, made love --\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Then everything's all right. ",
        "Taylor: --For what I fear may be the last time, ever. I told him about james. \r\nHe walked out on me. And he's not ever coming back. ",
        "Brooke: It hurts, I know. But if it was just one kiss -- ",
        "Ridge: It's more of the hypocrisy of it, to me -- ",
        "Brooke: So, it went beyond a kiss? While you were gone? Oh my god, I was \r\nafraid of that. ",
        "Ridge: She kept it from me for years. ",
        "Brooke: Ridge, taylor hasn't known hector for years. ",
        "Ridge: I'm not talking about hector. ",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about? Taylor and somebody else? ",
        "Ridge: James. ",
        "Brooke: James? ",
        "Ridge: James warwick. ",
        "Brooke: Taylor and james warwick slept together? No! ",
        "Massimo: You're very passionate about this, dominick. ",
        "Laurie: Look, your son has a really good point. We all have a responsibility \r\nto keep our planet healthy. We do what we can as individuals, by choosing hybrid \r\ncars. Or we can reduce the amount of electricity we consume by unplugging our \r\nchargers from the wall, and using energy efficient appliances. It's not about \r\ndoing everything, it's about doing something. And you have an even greater \r\nopportunity to help reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are \r\ncausing global warming. ",
        "Massimo: How come, dominick, you never brought this up before? ",
        "Nick: Because I was never going to be a father before. I'd say you start \r\nthinking a little bit differently. It's my watch pop, and I don't want my kid \r\nasking me years from now why I didn't do something about global warming. I just \r\nwon't have it. And we talked about a lot of things. Things that I care about. \r\nFish, for god's sake -- do you know how much mercury is in certain types of \r\nfish? And I'm not going to feed my pregnant wife what I catch, because you know \r\nI love to fish. Now come on, think about this. We got to do what we can to turn \r\nthis thing around. ",
        "Massimo: You know, you environmentalists don't realize what it takes to keep \r\na business running. ",
        "Laurie: Look, we should all be environmentalists. I understand you have a \r\nbottom line, but the truth is, green means green. You'll save money by reducing \r\nyour carbon dioxide emissions, you'll help slow global warming, and then other \r\ncompanies will follow your lead. ",
        "Nick: There's a lot of different ideas we could implement. ",
        "Massimo: All right, if my son believes in you, then I'll do what I can. Send \r\nme a report. ",
        "Laurie: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. ",
        "Massimo: Don't thank me, laurie, thank dominick. Because he's going to have \r\nto answer for every penny. ",
        "Laurie: Hey, congratulations on your baby. And you are doing such a great \r\nthing here, for everyone. ",
        "Nick: Well, thank you for helping me see I'm doing the right thing. ",
        "Ridge: She left me no choice. ",
        "Brooke: Wait a minute -- taylor and james warwick, made love? ",
        "Ridge: After the earthquake up at big bear, apparently james was a virgin and \r\nhis dying wish was to make love with her. And being the saint, she couldn't deny \r\nhim -- at least that's the story she told me. ",
        "Brooke: Taylor, unfaithful. ",
        "Ridge: \"Not possible,\" huh? \"Not something taylor would do?\" She did. ",
        "Brooke: You know, I wondered at the time, I thought something was going on \r\nbetween the two of them, and I asked james about it, and he denied it. ",
        "Ridge: I think she just sort of got it in her head that it never actually \r\nhappened. ",
        "Brooke: Oh god, ridge. It's bad enough to have someone cheat on you, but to \r\nhave them lie about it, all these years. You should've been told. Oh, taylor, \r\n\"woman of decency.\" ",
        "Ridge: What do you think she learned from her mistake, huh? To be more \r\nunderstanding of others? Treat others with tolerance, and fairness? That's not \r\nhow she treated you, is it? ",
        "Brooke: I know how important honesty is to you. ",
        "Ridge: You've always known what I'm about, logan. What I needed in a wife.\r\n",
        "Brooke: You needed somebody to trust. ",
        "Ridge: When you and I were together, there were never any lies. Never any \r\nsecrets. We had this deep connection, because we always knew we could depend on \r\neach other. ",
        "Brooke: I thought you had that with taylor too. ",
        "Ridge: Yeah, so did I. She was perfection. ",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm sure that was reinforced by stephanie. \"Taylor, the perfect \r\nlittle angel.\" Just wait until she finds out that taylor's feet are made of \r\nclay, just like the rest of us. Oh, I would love to be there when she finds out \r\nthat news. ",
        "Ridge: She already knows. ",
        "Stephanie: Why? Why did you tell him? ",
        "Taylor: I was trying to be honest with my husband. That's what I was trying \r\nto accomplish. I'm trying to get my marriage back on track. I told him about \r\nhector first, and the kiss. And he forgave me. ",
        "Stephanie: And not james? ",
        "Taylor: No. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, you've got to make him understand. If he could just \r\nunderstand why. ",
        "Taylor: No, stephanie, he forgave me for james. ",
        "Stephanie: Well then, what's the problem? ",
        "Taylor: The one thing that he can't forgive is the hypocrisy, the years of \r\nthe lie I've been living. And he's right. ",
        "Stephanie: No he's not, that's ridiculous. ",
        "Taylor: Come on stephanie, I've been walking around here letting everybody \r\nthink that I'm without sin. And I wasn'T. ",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, we're talking about one mistake! In your whole lifetime.\r\n",
        "Taylor: I know! I know the difference between rit and wrong. Ridge depended \r\non that. He trusted me -- he loved me. And what did I do? I violated our \r\nmarriage. I destroyed everything he believed about me. I made a mistake, and \r\nthen I made it worse by covering it up. But worse than that, was how I treated \r\nbrooke, that's what he could never forgive. How harshly I've judged her. That \r\nmakes me no better than her. ",
        "Stephanie: Horses and pigs are both mammals, but that's all that they have in \r\ncommon. ",
        "Taylor: All the years I've railed against brooke, judging her, acting like \r\nI'm morally superior -- ",
        "Stephanie: You are. ",
        "Taylor: At least she admits her mistakes, and she tries to make it right! I \r\ndeserve for ridge to leave me. ",
        "Stephanie: Don't even go there. Now listen to me. What we have to do is act \r\nquickly. We've got to salvage this marriage. ",
        "Taylor: It isn't up to us, it's up to ridge. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I know it is. And that's why I'm going to go and talk to him. \r\nNow, you clean yourself up. When he comes home -- and he will -- I want him to \r\nremember all the reasons he has for forgiving you. ",
        "Taylor: He won't listen to you, stephanie. He knows that you knew about james \r\nand that you covered it up. ",
        "Stephanie: I'll take care of that. In the meantime, we're not going to let \r\nthis fester, because if we do, brooke will make a move, and then you'll never \r\nget her out of here. I'm not going to let her destroy everything that you love, \r\nand you deserve. ",
        "Massimo: You, my son, are going to be the death of marone industries. Do you \r\nrealize how much all of this is going to cost? ",
        "Nick: Oh come on, it's money well spent. ",
        "Massimo: How do you figure? ",
        "Nick: Because you are making the world a better place for your grandkids. ",
        "Massimo: Mmm. Speaking of which, how is bridget? ",
        "Nick: She's probably going a little crazy. You know, she's bedridden, but \r\nshe's happy, she's good, thanks. ",
        "Massimo: That's great to hear. You know, it's a rare thing, but both my sons \r\nare happy. Both their lives are on track -- all at the same time. Must mean \r\nsomething. ",
        "Nick: Yeah. Oh, my life certainly is in a good place. I don't know if I'd say \r\nthe same about ridge. ",
        "Massimo: What do you mean? ",
        "Nick: He didn't come home for the holidays. You know that. ",
        "Massimo: Well, hey, that's hard on the family, I know. And maybe it was the \r\nwrong decision. But you know, let me tell you something. I am a businessman, and \r\nI realize what has to be, okay? Sometimes business has to come first. Otherwise, \r\nwhere are you going to get all the money to throw away on flavor of the day \r\ncauses? ",
        "Nick: It's a little bit more than that, pop. ",
        "Massimo: What are you saying, what's happening? ",
        "Nick: It's not my place, really. ",
        "Massimo: No, no, no. Come on. Hey, dominick marone, I am your father. Tell \r\nme, tell me exactly what's going on. ",
        "Nick: You know, this shouldn't be coming from me. ",
        "Massimo: Well, who's it going to come from? You're the one that started this. \r\nWhat is this about? ",
        "Nick: Brooke took R.J. New year's eve ever over to the house. That's what \r\nridge wanted, but he wasn't there. Hector ramirez was there with taylor. ",
        "Massimo: Hector and taylor are friends. ",
        "Nick: Brooke caught them in the bedroom. They were kissing. ",
        "Brooke: That's why your mother was so nervous about me talking to you. \r\nBecause she knew about taylor and james. ",
        "Ridge: From the beginning. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, that witch! I can't believe this. She defended taylor, and she \r\nwas protecting her, attacking me at every turn. Now, I understand that we all \r\nmake mistakes -- ",
        "Ridge: Taylor made it seem like she was different. She was better. You know \r\nwhat hurts me the most, logan? Is the way she treated you. You know she just \r\nhounded me about my feelings for you, and almost made me feel guilty for even \r\nacknowledging them. ",
        "Brooke: I don't blame you for that, ridge. I understood why you chose taylor. \r\nI believed the same things about her that you did. But you two renewed your \r\nvows, in front of your mother who was faking a heart attack, and to a woman \r\nwho's been cheating on you, who's been lying to you. ",
        "Ridge: How do I forgive that? Tell me. How do I do that, logan? ",
        "Massimo: Taylor forrester -- is a woman of decency and virtue. ",
        "Nick: Great. She was kissing another man. ",
        "Massimo: Okay, all right, look. What is important here is that ridge and \r\ntaylor work it out, immediately. Because they have children -- they've got to \r\nprotect the family. ",
        "Nick: He's walked away from the marriage and children before. ",
        "Massimo: You mean hope and R.J.? ",
        "Nick: Between you and me? When the dust settles, I'd really like to see where \r\nbrooke's going to be in all this. ",
        "Ridge: I thought the ground beneath me was solid. Well, it shifted. It left \r\nme with nothing to hold onto at all. The one person whose love for me I thought \r\nI never doubted -- was just a mirage. I feel like all I have is nothing but air.\r\n",
        "Brooke: There is one other person ridge, who doesn't judge you, who doesn't \r\nkeep secrets from you -- who just wants to be with you, to love you. Our son, \r\nR.J. His love for you is very, very pure. ",
        "Ridge: I've missed him. ",
        "Brooke: Well then, go to him. Spend some time with him. It'll be good for \r\nR.J., And it wouldn't hurt you either. ",
        "Ridge: Oh, it'd do me a world of good, I'm sure. ",
        "Brooke: Well you know what, I'll just finish up here, and I'll meet you at my \r\nhouse later. ",
        "Ridge: Thank you. ",
        "Brooke: I'm here for you, ridge. You can count on that. ",
        "Stephanie: I told you to stay out of their marriage! ",
        "Brooke: Get out of here, stephanie. I have a lot of work to do. ",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, I can imagine the work that you have to do -- hovering over \r\nhim like some vulture, hoping the marriage breaks up so you can just swoop in \r\nand pick up the little pieces. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's a lovely image.\u00ed@ ",
        "Stephanie: They're going to make this relationship work. So you back off, and \r\nstay away. ",
        "Brooke: They don't have a marriage. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please. ",
        "Brooke: All they have is deception and betrayal, all orchestrated by you. At \r\nleast ridge knows the kind of person you are, stephanie. And he can make his \r\ndecision based on that. ",
        "Stephanie: The only decision he's going to make is to keep this marriage. He \r\nis not, not going back to you. So get that out of your empty head -- ",
        "Brooke: You know, I don't care what he does about his marriage, that is his \r\nbusiness. All I care about is that ridge and I finally know the truth. That you \r\nand taylor are the biggest hypocrites that this world has ever produced! ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, really? "
