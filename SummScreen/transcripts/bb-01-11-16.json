        "The old man on the plane is snoring, he did not hear Liam pore out his heart. Liam says things were not good when he left so that is why it is important that he get back home. Steffy sits up in bed and tells Wyatt that he should not be saying this. She knows Ivy hurt him badly but He says she knows it too, it should have been them. She says no, she is in love with his brother. Rick likes Zende's photos and says sometimes that is all it takes is impromptu. He likes the images as Sasha is fresh and sexy. She gives all the credit to the great photographer, Zende. She watches as Nicole kisses Zende and tells him how proud she is of him. Wyatt tells Steffy that he wants something easy, not a relationship where he gets nothing in return. She says they can get past this and that is what she wants from Liam. Wyatt says he hopes Liam knows how lucky he is. He will try his best to be hopeful for her. But he does not think things are gonna be different as that is the kind of fool Liam is and deep down he thinks she knows that.",
        "Howard accuses Liam of having his eye on two women at the same time; that will get him in trouble like he is flirting with the flight attendant. Liam says all he wants to do is get home and walk down that aisle and nothing can happen after that .at least he doesn't think it will. They depart the plane and Howard wishes him well and gives him his business card. He tells him to give him a call if Pam and her desserts become available. Steffy tells Wyatt that she just needs Liam to hold her. He does not have to jump off a bridge for her. Wyatt says he doesn't understand how she puts up with him. Liam is everyone's hero and Wyatt has to settle for second place. She says he does not have to feel that way. He reminds her they are both here now and he will always be there for her, whatever she wants. She whines that she just needs someone to lean on now and goes into his arms. Liam checks his messages, no Steffy. Steffy falls asleep in Wyatt's arms. Sasha tells Zende that he gets all the credit and now Rick and Maya know it, that is all that matters. He says maybe he won't be the only one advancing their career. She does not want him to feel obligated. And Nicole is really lucky to have him. Liam slips into the house and first he sees Wyatt's coat and two bottles of wine on the table. Slowly he goes into the bedroom and almost gags as he sees Wyatt and Steffy in bed asleep. He backs out and falls into a chair."

        "Steffy: I don't -- I don't think you should be saying this.",
        "Wyatt: Why not?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt... the way Ivy treated you, it was awful, but I just -- I... that doesn't mean that we can do this, okay?",
        "Wyatt: Well, maybe it does, Steffy. Like, maybe the woman I was meant to be with all this time was... was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Wow. Zende, these are great. You're definitely improving.",
        "Maya: I think someone's found their calling.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Something sure inspired you.",
        "Maya: So, can we see these on a bigger screen?",
        "Zende: Sure. I can pull them up on the laptop. Remember, guys -- these are still rough. This was all very impromptu, nothing really planned.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, we were just fooling around.",
        "Rick: Well, sometimes that's all it takes to get what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Howard: Hot.",
        "Liam: Uh, my fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Howard: That's your fianc\u00e9e? She's a babe. What? I'm old. I'm not blind.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] No, no. You're not. She -- she is hot. And a lot more.",
        "Howard: The whole package.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Howard: So, what are you messing things up for? You got to behave yourself.",
        "Liam: I -- I was. I am!",
        "Howard: No, you said you had an argument. Maybe I dreamed it. Maybe I dozed off when you were yammering on.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Not an argument, exactly, but... yeah, things -- things weren't good when I left. Which is why I need to get back home as soon as possible. You know, make sure she knows how I feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: When you first came back to town, there was a spark there. We both felt it. And I should've pursued it. I should've gone after it. But then, you went after Liam, and I knew you were just gonna end in heartbreak. And I just -- I went after Ivy thinking she actually cared about me. But it should've been you. It should've been us all along.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, we -- we shouldn't talk about --",
        "Wyatt: Why not? You felt it, too, Steffy -- the connection that we have.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I'm in love with your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Beautiful.",
        "Maya: Really interesting choices, Zende.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maya: Modeling can be challenging work, but Sasha looks like she's having the time of her life, and that's a testament to you.",
        "Sasha: Dude, seriously, where were you when I was getting my senior portraits taken? [Gasps] Oh, my God. Do you remember that guy who took our pictures?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Sasha: And he convinced me to hold that rose?",
        "Nicole: Hey, we got what we paid for.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Rick: You know, Zende, I know I've been critical or your work, calling it stiff and too controlled, but these images are nothing like that. You're using your creativity to bring out Sasha's spirit. And you're right, you can see it in her eyes -- she's having the time of her life.",
        "Maya: Mm.",
        "Rick: Sasha walked in here today not knowing she was gonna take any photos, and yet you were still able to capture these images, and they're fresh, and they're sexy.",
        "Zende: That's all thanks to Sasha. I mean, she's the one who really --",
        "Sasha: Who what? Goofed around? 'Cause that's all I did. I mean, I'm not a model at all -- like, far from it -- but the great thing about Zende is that... well, he makes anybody feel like they can be a model. And look -- these pictures prove it. I'd say that's the mark of a great photographer. Wouldn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, you're hurting, and -- and so am I, and I know this -- I know this could be easy for us, but I just --",
        "Wyatt: Easy. Easy -- that's exactly it. Easy is good. I am tired of difficult. I'm tired of giving it my all and not getting anything in return. I mean... I just -- I want -- I want a relationship to be easy for once. Don't you?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'm hoping my relationship with Liam will be... if we get past this.",
        "Wyatt: I hope he knows how lucky he is.",
        "Steffy: Uh, I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Steffy: I'm quite the handful. Kind of. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: A beautiful, smart, strong handful -- and sexy as hell, by the way, so thank you.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I know that you're hopeful that things are gonna change with Liam. And I -- I will try my best to be hopeful for you. But I have my doubts. I don't think things are gonna get easier with Liam. Because he's always gonna be the person jumping off bridges and catching flights to Sydney, because that's the type of fool that he is. And deep down... I think you know that.",

        "Flight Attendant: Excuse me. Sir, the captain has put the \"Fasten your seat belt\" sign on.",
        "Howard: Uh, why? Are we expecting turbulence?",
        "Flight Attendant: No, we're gonna be landing soon.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Finally.",
        "Flight Attendant: I have some other magazines in the back, if you want me to grab you some other options?",
        "Liam: Um -- ha! No, uh, thanks. I'm good with this. I'm actually the editor.",
        "Flight Attendant: Of Eye on Fashion?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. I know that my current state of dress wouldn't indicate that, but I promise, I have just flown to Australia and back. [Chuckles] Well, I've seen worse, believe me. Uh, let me know if you need anything else before we land.",
        "Howard: I wouldn't mind another one of those dessert bars, if you have any left over from dinner.",
        "Flight Attendant: I think I have a few. I'll bring you one.",
        "Liam: Oh, um, Margo, make it two.",
        "Flight Attendant: Okay.",
        "Liam: Thanks.",
        "Howard: I'm onto you now.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Howard: The trouble with your lady friend. Maybe it's 'cause you're such a big flirt.",
        "Liam: I am not.",
        "Howard: [Chuckles] You and the stewardess -- excuse me -- flight attendant.",
        "Liam: That's -- that -- I'm not flirt-- that wasn't flirting.",
        "Howard: Maybe you don't think you're flirting, but you're flirting. I know your type.",
        "Liam: What type? There's no type. I don't have a type.",
        "Howard: I was like you. I love the chase, the pursuit, not so much the settling down. Wasn't until I had a few ex-wives under my belt that I figured out what I was doing -- always with an eye on two women at the same time.",
        "Liam: Okay. That's -- how did you -- yeah, that's...a little familiar. But not -- not the settling-down part. I mean, Steffy's the one. I know that.",
        "Howard: Yeah, well, make sure she knows it. That way, you stay out of trouble.",
        "Flight Attendant: Here you go. Two dessert bars.",
        "Howard: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Ah. Thank you.",
        "Flight Attendant: Enjoy.",
        "Liam: Thanks.",
        "Howard: This gal of yours, can she cook?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, some things. Yeah. Why?",
        "Howard: If she can make goodies like this, she's a keeper.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] There's, uh -- there's this receptionist at my other job I should introduce you to. I think you'd get a kick out of her. She brings things like this into work all the time.",
        "Howard: She married?",
        "Liam: No, but she is... spoken for. Although she's very different. I don't think you want to add that to your ex-wife list.",
        "Howard: I like different. Different is good. Different can be great, especially if different knows how to bake.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but Pam, she's a whole other level of different. Like, I couldn't even imagine being married to her.",
        "Howard: Maybe you can't imagine being married at all.",
        "Liam: No, I... I want to be married. Not waiting any longer. As soon as I get back to LA, I'm gonna convince Steffy that we should walk down the aisle as soon as possible, and after that... nothing can stop us. I don't think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Well, that went really well.",
        "Zende: Yeah, Rick and Maya seem to really be on my side. I could actually be doing this. I could actually be a photographer here at Forrester.",
        "Sasha: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: I mean, do you think they'll talk to Ridge?",
        "Nicole: That's probably where they're going right now. And thank you for stepping in and helping Zende.",
        "Sasha: Oh, yeah, girl, it was no problem.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I think those are his best pictures yet.",
        "Sasha: [Chuckles] For shots of me? Doubtful. You're just saying that 'cause you're my friend.",
        "Nicole: No, no, I mean it. It's obvious that you two really clicked. I am so proud of you.",
        "Zende: Thank you.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bell dings]",
        "Liam: That's not good.",
        "Howard: She didn't call?",
        "Liam: Yeah. You don't have to say it. I -- I know, I know. She's not happy with me right now. But listen, I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna explain to her what happened, I'm gonna apologize, and then -- then we're gonna move on. We're gonna get married.",
        "Howard: Hey, Liam, here's my card. If that dessert lady ever becomes available...",
        "Liam: I'll let you know.",
        "Howard: Okay. Now you better hustle. Sweep Steffy off her feet. Hey, good luck.",
        "Liam: That's the plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I don't think Liam understands, and... maybe I'm not being clear enough. But I just... I need to be his first priority, and maybe that's selfish, I know, but --",
        "Wyatt: What? Not at all. What are you talking about? You should be his first priority. You're his fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Steffy: Right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: If he chooses to go to Australia without telling me, after what he said...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and after all the Ivy stuff...",
        "Steffy: He said he was done. He was done with the accidents that keep happening around me and the way Ivy keeps getting hurt and my excuses, but what I heard was so much more. And what I need from him, I... I just needed him to hold me and need me and be there for me. And I get Liam -- I get that he -- he'll jump off a bridge for someone. I get that. And I respect that. But I expect him to come home once it's done.",
        "Wyatt: I agree. I don't think that's too much to ask. I mean, after he's done walking the little old lady across the street or saving the five orphan kids from the burning building... he should come home to you. He should hold you, and he should let you know exactly how much you mean to him. That's what I would do. I just... I don't understand it. I don't understand how you put up with it. I don't know how anyone does. It's just -- it boggles my mind how I keep coming in second place. He's Ivy's hero, he's Hope's hero -- you know, he's everybody's hero, and then I'm the afterthought. I'm the one that everybody wants to \"settle for,\" so...",
        "Steffy: I wish you didn't feel that way.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well... I mean, it seems like we both kind of want the same thing, then, don't we? To be someone's number one? To come home at the end of the day and look your partner in the eye...and know immediately how much you mean to them.",
        "Steffy: I just... I want someone to be there for me. That's all. I just...",
        "Wyatt: Look, we're both here for each other right now. As much as I... maybe want us to be more than friends, I will... always be there for you. Whatever you want.",
        "Steffy: I just need someone to lean on right now.",
        "Wyatt: I can do that.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: Come here.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Figured you were still here. Do you need any help packing anything up?",
        "Zende: No, I'm good. Why did you do that?",
        "Sasha: Do what?",
        "Zende: Give me all the credit? I mean, you are the one who brought the shoot to life. I just took the pictures.",
        "Sasha: Well, I couldn't let you say that.",
        "Zende: It's the truth.",
        "Sasha: No, the truth is, you need to have more confidence in yourself. I mean, do you want to be a photographer here or not?",
        "Zende: Yes.",
        "Sasha: Okay. Then you can't go around telling the people who are in charge that the pictures you took you had nothing to do with.",
        "Zende: Okay. But it doesn't bother you at all that no one --",
        "Sasha: That -- no, no. Rick and Maya now know how talented you are. And so does Nicole. That's all that matters.",
        "Zende: Thank you.",
        "Sasha: You're welcome.",
        "Zende: But I'm still telling Rick how instrumental you were.",
        "Sasha: Zende...",
        "Zende: No, okay? I'm not gonna downplay my role. I promise. But it was a team effort. And maybe, you know, who knows? I'm not the only one who could be advancing in their career because of this. Maybe this is the start to your modeling career.",
        "Sasha: Okay. That would be awesome. But, seriously, I don't want you to feel obligated, okay? I didn't -- I didn't jump in the shoot for me.",
        "Zende: You hardly know me. Come on.",
        "Sasha: [Chuckles] Well, I know Nicole. That's all I need to know. She's always had great instincts. And, uh, she's really lucky to have you."
