    "Recap": [
        "Steffy smells breakfast tacos; sure enough right on cue Liam walks in. He says it could have been breakfast in bed but this is the best he could do. Bill tells Katie that he is glad she told him he could stop by. They both opine they are doing pretty well, her living next to Eric and despite his pining over Brooke. She does say she is not trying to give him a hard time and he says he is not giving up. RJ wants to get a wedding started but Brooke says that takes time and Ridge says it is just bad timing. He can't get away right now. Wyatt slips into the office and slams the door, but tells Liam that it slipped. Liam isn't buying that and makes a smart remark. He and Wyatt have words over what the new product line will mean and how important it is to women to hold such an important position. Wyatt sits and Steffy does tell Liam she told him that she had a meeting. Wyatt tells Liam on his way out to tell Pam they do not want to be disturbed. He tells Steffy that he does not want her to think he is trying to influence her to move into Eric's. He is just wanting her to realize all her potential. He knows she was with Liam last night and that grates at him but it is not his call.",
        "Liam wastes no time in going straight to Quinn and says she is still working her angles to get Wyatt and Steffy together. Steffy it not settling for just being CEO and nothing else but to be with Liam. Quinn differs; she could have much more with Wyatt. Liam says yes her dirty little fingerprints are all over this so she can hand Steffy to Wyatt, something she thinks her son deserves. Ridge comes in and puts himself between the two of them and Liam keeps going off on Quinn. Bill stops by and surprises Brooke. He says he heard she is going out of town and he could be ready in ten minutes if she let him. He thinks it is great that she is going to see Hope and he will be on the Stella Maris close by so just give him a call anytime. He tells her one last time that he loves her and he is not going to give up on that. Ridge is only devoted to Ridge and that is not her future. Liam tells Ridge with Brooke out of town now is the perfect time Ridge needs to make his move on Quinn."

        "Steffy: [Sniffs] Breakfast tacos?",
        "Liam: From your favorite taco truck.",
        "Steffy: And coffee?! Ohh!",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Well, we had such a good night, I figured you could use a good morning, as well.",
        "Steffy: Thank you!",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Mmm.",
        "Liam: Would have brought you breakfast in bed, but this will have to do.",
        "Steffy: Oh, it's amazing. Thank you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, it's a lot better than it could have been. You didn't wake up under the same roof as Wyatt and Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not giving up. I still think this campaign could be a huge success -- for us, for Steffy, Forrester, everything. It just -- I'm sorry. Am I boring you?",
        "Quinn: [Yawns] Oh, sorry. I'm just tired.",
        "Wyatt: Ahh. The tequila.",
        "Quinn: No, no. I'm not hung over. I told you I'm not a tequila drinker.",
        "Wyatt: You seemed to be enjoying it last night.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles sarcastically]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I had a few too many myself, but I needed it. [Groans]",
        "Quinn: I'm disappointed, too. I really thought Steffy would come back to you.",
        "Bill: Glad you let me know you were coming by so I could, uh, get this little spread out.",
        "Katie: Well, when will realized that he left Edward teddy here last night, he had a meltdown of epic proportions.",
        "Bill: Oh, I can only imagine.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: The good news is he's loving your new place.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he does. So do I.",
        "Bill: Even though you're living next door to Eric and Quinn?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: You know, I bumped in to that good-looking realtor of yours. Hope she got you a good deal on this place. Living next door to a lunatic -- I would think that's really terrific for property values.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm also living next door to Eric, and he is well worth the price of admission. Did you send him a thank-you for getting will into Westside prep?",
        "Bill: Yeah. I sent him a bottle of my best scotch. I'm sure he knows what it was for.",
        "Katie: Well, will seems to have filled you in on everything that's going on in my life. What about your life? Still pining over Brooke?",
        "R.J.: I think it's a great idea.",
        "Brooke: So, you don't mind that I'm going out of town?",
        "R.J.: Well, I'd rather have dad go to Italy with you.",
        "Ridge: Even if I were to go, you know you wouldn't have the house to yourself, right?",
        "R.J.: I didn't even think about that. I'm thinking about you. I mean, I'm sure hope could --",
        "Brooke: Honey, that's a sweet idea -- it is -- but I'm going alone.",
        "Ridge: And I got to put some things order so when we get back -- when you get back -- we'll get married.",
        "Katie: Don't give me that look. I'm not giving you a hard time. I'm just curious. So, you're not giving up?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Katie: Swallowing your pride, even though she hurt you. Anyway, you haven't mentioned it, so I'm assuming you don't know. Brooke is leaving town for a while.",
        "R.J.: Why wait? I mean, you guys can have the wedding in Italy. I can come, too.",
        "Brooke: Honey, weddings take time to plan.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, but you've had those weddings before. I mean, this one would be different.",
        "Ridge: Ahh. Listen, I want it to be memorable, too. Italy sounds great. I just can't get away right now. There's...a few things I got -- I got to take care of. It's --",
        "R.J.: Quinn. Yeah, I know.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, Quinn. I know you're frustrated. I'm frustrated, too. But we got to take care of this, for the company, for the family.",
        "Quinn: We were so close. I really thought we were getting through to Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, right up until Eric asked her to move in.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but you gave such an amazing pitch. The video, the fragrance, the cosmetics line -- such a good idea.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks. Steffy could be huge, you know? She just -- she's -- she's got to realize what she's capable of and just embrace her potential, you know?",
        "Quinn: Well, you can help her do that.",
        "Wyatt: I'm running out of time here, mom.",
        "Quinn: I know, but keep working on her. You need to be her champion. She's gonna realize that you're the man who really cares about her.",
        "Wyatt: That's quite the epiphany.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: And if she did sign on for this campaign, it could be a good start, but I don't know. Speaking of which, I got this meeting, so I should probably go.",
        "Quinn: Good luck. [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Now I'm ready to get back to work.",
        "Liam: You're kicking me out?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I have a meeting.",
        "Liam: You're C.E.O. Tell them to wait.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I'll see you later.",
        "Liam: Are you coming back to my place?",
        "Steffy: Oh-ho! Tempting.",
        "Liam: All right. Your grandfather said we can't live together. He did not say we can't be together anytime we want.",
        "Steffy: No, he did not say that.",
        "Wyatt: Slipped.",
        "Liam: Just wish I'd put a tie on the doorknob or something.",
        "Wyatt: Better yet, don't do that here.",
        "Katie: All I know is that Brooke is going to Italy to see hope and she leaves today.",
        "Bill: Any idea for how long?",
        "Katie: No. She didn't tell me, but you know Brooke. Could be for a while.",
        "Bill: Why did you want me to know, Katie?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm surprised that you didn't already know. But now you do. So, I will see myself out, and you...can tell my sister \"bon voyage\" for me.",
        "Liam: So, hear you tried to bribe Steffy into moving back in with you. Not cool.",
        "Wyatt: Also not what's happening, but okay.",
        "Liam: You literally offered her a check, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I offered her a chance to expand her horizons. But I don't expect you to understand that, since you're always trying to stifle her success and all.",
        "Liam: Oh, all right. Here it comes. Come on.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? You know what? You -- you didn't want her to have this C.E.O. job in the first place.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: You have been hating on her social-media campaign since day one. But I just want you to know those are the rungs on the ladder, my friend. She has a lot of potential, and you're just holding her back. That's what you're doing.",
        "Liam: I'm holding her back?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Can I just send you both to your corners?",
        "Both: No.",
        "Steffy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: I-I was just explaining to our friend here how important your success is... to me, which brings me to our new product line.",
        "Liam: Come on. She's an executive, not a spokesperson.",
        "Wyatt: Excuse me! She is a powerful woman that other women want to emulate. And this product line will allow us to do exactly that -- to grow and use her popularity and having Forrester directly benefit from that.",
        "Steffy: It's an interesting idea.",
        "Wyatt: Great! I have a million of them. Why don't we start brainstorming?",
        "Steffy: I told you I had that meeting.",
        "Liam: Yeah. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Hey, can you tell Pam that we don't want to be disturbed, Liam, on your way out? Thanks.",
        "Liam: I will see you later.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Let's get to work.",
        "Wyatt: You were with him last night, weren't you?",
        "Quinn: You're late.",
        "Ridge: All right. Calm down. You seem very anxious to see me.",
        "Quinn: You could have called and let me know that you were running behind.",
        "Ridge: I was at Brooke's [Sighs] Saying goodbye.",
        "Quinn: Goodbye? What happened?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brooke: Bill.",
        "Bill: Heard you were going out of town. I had to see you before you left.",
        "Quinn: Did you and Brooke have an argument?",
        "Ridge: No. She's going out of town. She's gonna go see hope in Italy. Why did you think we'd be arguing?",
        "Quinn: Because I -- [Groans] Never mind. Nothing. Just -- you know what? Don't mind me today. I'm not really feeling like myself. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: You're not feeling like yourself? You okay?",
        "Quinn: Uh, yeah, I am. I just -- Wyatt introduced me to tequila last night.",
        "Ridge: Was it your first time? How'd that go?",
        "Quinn: No, it wasn't my first time. I'm just not much of a tequila drinker.",
        "Ridge: Was it better than my dad's martinis?",
        "Quinn: A martini is good for winding down at the end of a long day. Tequila is either for having fun or drowning your sorrows.",
        "Ridge: Which one were you doing last night?",
        "Quinn: A little bit of both, which is probably why I am so tired today. Why don't we talk about you? What are you gonna do with yourself while Brooke is on her trip?",
        "Ridge: Well, I've had this idea bouncing around in my head. And now with Brooke gone, I can -- I can focus on it.",
        "Bill: You weren't trying to sneak away without saying goodbye, were you?",
        "Brooke: I'm not going away for very long.",
        "Bill: Katie said it might be a while.",
        "Brooke: My sister told you I was leaving?",
        "Bill: She thought I'd want to know.",
        "Brooke: I'm going to see hope.",
        "Bill: Anything that gets you away from the dressmaker is fine by me.",
        "Brooke: I'm spending time with my daughter. And then when I get home, Ridge and I can find some time to get away on our own.",
        "Bill: I'm ready to go right now. Say the word and I'll clear my calendar for the next month.",
        "Brooke: Bill...",
        "Bill: The Stella Maris is waiting for us, Brooke. And I'm still waiting for you.",
        "Steffy: Look, I don't want to talk about last night. I want to talk about the campaign. That's why you called this meeting, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: So [Sighs] Along with your products, you should think about doing some endorsements. Look, I don't want you to think that I was trying to buy your affection or bribe you into living at Eric's. It was just a show of support. So, you don't want to live at Eric's. That's fine. But everything else on the table stands.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I appreciate everything you're doing, but...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but my brother doesn't. You know, he and I see you very differently. I see -- I see how great you are. I see your potential and your power and how -- how big of a star you could become if you just -- if you tried. But I know that puts you in a tough position, because I know you were with Liam last night. And I can't pretend that doesn't upset me thoroughly. But how can I give up on you, on us... and just all the incredible things that we can accomplish together?",
        "Liam: Boy, you just don't know when to quit, do you? A cosmetics line, beauty products, her own portrait, and a million-dollar check -- that's a hell of a bribe, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Ohh. So, you heard. Wyatt gave a truly inspired presentation.",
        "Liam: Yes, yes. I'm sure he did, however ineffective.",
        "Quinn: You don't want Steffy to succeed, do you?",
        "Liam: Are you implying she hasn't?",
        "Quinn: You want her to settle for being C.E.O. and focus on making a life with you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, see, this is the thing -- Steffy's running one of the biggest fashion houses in the world, and you think that's settling.",
        "Quinn: Because she can do so much more. With Wyatt's help, she could influence opinion and wield power on a global stage. You think we were trying to bribe her? We were trying to advance her career because we believe in her -- all of us do -- a hell of a lot more than you do, because you're the one who's always trying to hold her back.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe it's crazy, holding out hope for some marriage that isn't over, but, you know, our divorce isn't final yet.",
        "Steffy: It will be soon.",
        "Wyatt: When we got married, when we said our vows, I believe we meant every word of them.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, we did.",
        "Wyatt: And seeing you last night, I just -- it brought everything back for me.",
        "Steffy: I can't live with you, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: You're not living with my brother, either.",
        "Steffy: At my grandfather's request.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you wouldn't have moved out if you didn't think it was the right thing to do.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I didn't --",
        "Wyatt: We are still married, and you are my wife. And that doesn't have to change. It's not too late, Steffy.",
        "Liam: I couldn't hold Steffy back if I tried, Quinn. There is no woman in the world more amazing than she is.",
        "Quinn: You just don't want her working with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: I don't want her near either one of you.",
        "Quinn: So, you think she can't protect herself, that she needs you to take care of her? What she needs is support and encouragement.",
        "Liam: Steffy knows how proud of her I am. Let's talk about what's been happening lately. This C.E.O. Position, her moving out, this new Steffy product line -- it's got your dirty little fingerprints all over it because you haven't changed, have you? You are still trying to push Steffy and Wyatt together. You know what this is? I'll tell you. This is mommy trying to give her son whatever she thinks he deserves.",
        "Quinn: Steffy is still my son's wife, and, yes, I'm fighting for their marriage.",
        "Liam: Yes, you are -- the one you tricked them into.",
        "Ridge: Okay. What's going on here?",
        "Quinn: Oh, Liam's just going off on me -- again.",
        "Liam: You think he's gonna help you? He feels the same way I do. You scammed him out of his job, and God knows how you got away with it, but you did. Well, that's not gonna continue forever. Sooner or later, you're gonna slip up and you're gonna expose yourself, and Eric's eyes are gonna be wide open, and he's gonna be done with you, just like Steffy and Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: Wait a second. Are you saying that Steffy is starting to accept me?",
        "Liam: Oh, my God! No! I am saying that, once and for all, you will be out -- out! -- Of our lives.",
        "Bill: I'll drive you to the airport.",
        "Brooke: I already have a car picking me up.",
        "Bill: Cancel it. If you want to go spend time with Hope, I think that's great. As soon as you're done, call me on the Stella Maris. Tell me the port, and I'll have her anchored there -- Portofino, Naples, Sardinia. Let's go! Let's get away from L.A. and all these, uh... distractions.",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Bill: I think it's a great freakin' idea -- one of the best ideas I have ever had! Hell of a lot better than my decision to postpone our wedding.",
        "Brooke: I am engaged to Ridge.",
        "Bill: Ridge didn't fight for you. Your son poured on the guilt, and Forrester took advantage of you and took advantage of it. I put my life on hold for you. I've never done that for anyone. You know that. But you're worth it. I love you. And if I gave up on us, I would regret it, and so would you. Brooke, you know that you have created this idealized scenario in your head to satisfy your familial guilt. But I am telling you -- I am telling you -- that Ridge is not your future. He will hurt you, just like he always does. I could set my watch by it. You need someone who is devoted to you, committed to you. Forrester is just an imposter who is only committed to himself. You can't count on him. He will do something selfish. He will do something to betray you.",
        "Liam: So, Brooke's -- Brooke's going out of town? All right. Then now's the time. We got to expose Quinn. I mean, do whatever it is you're planning on doing, but do it now. We've got to get rid of her.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is committed to me.",
        "Bill: Ridge is committed to Ridge. He has a history of breaking your heart, Brooke. But you don't have to go down that road if you would acknowledge the simple truth that the life you want is with me.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Brooke: My car is here.",
        "Bill: I'll walk you out. I love you. And I won't give up on that love or our future together. It will happen for us. You will be my wife."
