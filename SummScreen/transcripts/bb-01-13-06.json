        "Taylor: I didn't make you feel inferior.",
        "Brooke: Yes, Taylor, you did. But not anymore.",
        "Taylor: You say I judged you unfairly? Well, in my professional experience, most inferiority comes from people unfairly judging themselves.",
        "Brooke: You're putting this on me?",
        "Taylor: Well, you have to admit, you have done far more than I have to make yourself feel small.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: I don't know what to say.",
        "Bridget: Hey, if you don't want to do this right now, it's okay.",
        "Felicia: No. It's important. I want to leave a message to Dominick. Do you mind if I sit on the couch while we do this?",
        "Nick: Sure.",
        "Felicia: Hi, honey. It's mommy. Are you taping? You can hear me okay?",
        "Nick: You're doing great.",
        "Felicia: Okay. Dominick -- hi, sweetie. I don't know how old you'll be when you can watch this -- but right now, you're 5 1/2 months. So you don't really understand what's happening to mommy. I told you I'm sick. But if you're watching this tape, then that means what's going to happen -- has already happened. Sweetie, I wish we could have spent some more time together. You know, it really just -- it felt like we're just getting to know each other. Everything you do is new to me. Every smile. Every grunt. Every laugh. Never stop laughing, baby boy. 'Cause that is my favorite sound in the whole entire universe. I know this must be sad for you. I'm so sorry. Not being able see mommy, and touch me or feel me anymore -- but don't be sad for me, okay? Because I lived an incredible life. The most incredible part of it is the time that I spent with you. Dominick, you brought me more joy than anything or anyone ever has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You have to keep fighting for this.",
        "Ridge: For what? A marriage tainted by lies?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Ridge, she's made one misstep.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, it sure was a hell of a big one.",
        "Stephanie: But she admitted to it.",
        "Ridge: Yeah -- now.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, now. Before it was too late. Look, you still have a chance here.",
        "Ridge: Taylor had a million chances to tell me what happened with James.",
        "Stephanie: I think you'd better start being concerned about Thomas and the girls.",
        "Ridge: What about what hope and R.J.? Were you concerned about them when you faked your heart attack and started sending Taylor up to be the perfect wife and mother?",
        "Stephanie: I'll tell you one thing Taylor would never do -- she would never, never sleep with her daughter's husband.",
        "Ridge: Oh, that's it. That's it. I'm not listening to this anymore. You know, mother, you seem to think I'm still connected to you, like I can't get along without you. Well, you know what? I'm through letting you try and control my life. From now on, stay the hell out of it!",
        "Brooke: You can't get to me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I'm just saying you've made your share of mistakes.",
        "Brooke: Never denied it. Unlike you.",
        "Taylor: I never claimed to be a saint or an angel. I'm sorry you saw me that way. And I'm sorry I made you feel inferior. You know, my husband may be mad at me right now, but that's only right now. Because I know our marriage is going to survive this.",
        "Brooke: At least Ridge now has the information he needs to make an informed decision. He's through being lied to you by you and Stephanie. He now knows the person that you really are. Good luck, Taylor. I think you're going to need it. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM",
        "Felicia: My baby, Dominick, there are so many things that I want to say to you. I could fill up this entire tape with advice, but I'm sure you're going to get enough of that from your daddy and your mommy, Bridget. Bridget --",
        "Bridget: Oh, no, this is your tape, Felicia.",
        "Felicia: Come on, just for a minute. Dominick, there's something I want to say to you right now, and it's very important. So listen to me, okay? I gave birth to you. And I will always be your mommy. And I will always be up there, watching over you. And I will always love you. But this woman right here is the one that you're going to grow up calling mommy. Okay? You are going to love her with all your heart. And that's what I want. That's why I picked her. Because I know that she will love you and take care of you the way I wish I could.",
        "Bridget: I will.",
        "Felicia: It's because of her and your daddy that I'm not afraid of what I have to face right now. Because I'm not afraid for you. Your future is going to be amazing.",
        "Nick: You can count on that.",
        "Felicia: I'm sure that you are going to go places and do things that I cannot even imagine. Because, Dominick, you are filled with wanderlust. It's in your blood. You get it from me, and your daddy. I just hope you're not as silly as we were. I think we spent most of our lives traveling the world looking for security and love, only to realize that all the support and all the love that we could ever want or need was right back here, where we started. With our families. You remember that, okay? Anything you could ever want or need is right here, with your mommy and your daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, Ridge told Brooke everything.",
        "Stephanie: So she's confronted you, too?",
        "Taylor: She just left.",
        "Stephanie: You know where she's going, don't you?",
        "Taylor: Ridge and I are in the biggest trouble of our entire marriage, and he went to Brooke -- again! It all goes back to Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: That's why you can't let her anywhere near him.",
        "Taylor: Ridge has already forgiven me for James. He's not even angry about that. Stephanie, I just revealed the most painful secret of my life, and all Ridge can think about is how I've treated Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey, maybe next time I go to France, you can come with me. You want to do that? We can go ride the carousels in Paris. Then we can go to Monaco to see the grand prix. I think you'd like that. It's a lot of cool, fast cars racing all around the city. Vroom! Hey.",
        "Brooke: Hey. Don't let me interrupt.",
        "Ridge: You're home kind of late.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, I got all sidetracked at the office. So, how long have you been here?",
        "Ridge: Oh, not very long. Catherine's upstairs giving hope a bath.",
        "Brooke: I bet Hope was glad to see you.",
        "Ridge: I kind of told her I'd stick around and help tuck her in.",
        "Brooke: Well, now, this guy should be in bed already.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know. I'm sorry. I promised Catherine I'd get him ready, and then we started playing down here with the cars.",
        "Brooke: He loves the toys that you got him for Christmas.",
        "Ridge: I wasn't sure he'd still be into the cars. It was trains last time.",
        "Brooke: And next week it'll be something else.",
        "Ridge: I know, they change so fast. Unless you're around every single day, you miss so much. When he was born, I remember that -- [Ridge sighs] We made a lot of plans, when I think back to that time. We were so happy, Logan.",
        "Brooke: Yes, we were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Ridge is concerned about Brooke because she's making herself the victim here.",
        "Taylor: Well, I hate to admit it, but she may have a point.",
        "Stephanie: No. And don't listen to that nonsense.",
        "Taylor: Well, I can't deny that what she's saying is true -- that I did come back and I did disrupt her family. And maybe Ridge would have stayed with her if you hadn't faked the heart attack.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor -- you made the decision to tell your husband that you slept with James.",
        "Taylor: Is that you're way of telling me \"I told you so\"?",
        "Stephanie: Infidelity is no longer the problem with your marriage, honey. Brooke is. Ridge has taken all of your marital problems, and made them about Brooke. Suddenly, you're the hypocrite. If you want to save your marriage, keep her out of it. I'll do whatever I can to help you.",
        "Taylor: Are you saying that because you really believe Ridge and I belong together? Or would you do anything, including forgiving my infidelity, just to get Brooke out of this family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There you go. There you go. I don't spend enough time with them.",
        "Brooke: They know you love them.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, but just phone calls and sending gifts. It's not enough.",
        "Brooke: You do more than that.",
        "Ridge: Not lately.",
        "Brooke: You've had a lot going on.",
        "Ridge: So have you. All this stuff going on with Bridget, with business, raising a couple of kids by yourself.",
        "Brooke: Some days are more challenging than others. But with the love that I get from Hope and R.J., It sustains me. No amount of love is going to keep this guy awake one more minute.",
        "Ridge: No. I'm sure Hope's finished with her bath by now. Hey, could I come up and help tuck them in?",
        "Brooke: They'd love that. So would I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: So, Dominick, I guess the only thing I really need to say to you -- the only thing that really matters -- is that I love you. I love you with all my heart. And I always will. Always. [Sobbing] Oh, is that okay? I didn't sound too much like a blubbering idiot?",
        "Nick: You were great.",
        "Felicia: I didn't realize how much that was going to take out of me.",
        "Bridget: I can't imagine how hard it is to say good-bye.",
        "Felicia: I think actually, Dominick and I should say good-bye right now. It's late.",
        "Nick: I'll go put him in his car seat.",
        "Felicia: Thank you. Oh my gosh, that was hard. But you're right, I needed to do it, while I still had the chance.",
        "Bridget: You still have time.",
        "Felicia: Not as much as I'd like. But knowing that Dominick is going to be here with you, as his mommy, and with his daddy, that is the only thing that's keeping me going, Bridget. You need to love Dominick like he's your own son.",
        "Bridget: I will.",
        "Felicia: But you have own little girl on the way. That's your first child, and now my son is turning all your plans upside-down.",
        "Bridget: It's okay. Plans change.",
        "Felicia: I know, but your love for him cannot change. I need to hear you say it. I need to know you're going to love him as much as I do, for the rest of his life.",
        "Bridget: Felicia, I made a promise to you. I'm going to keep it. I'm not going to let you down, and I'm not going to let Dominick down. I will always love him like he's my own. Because he'll be my son. He is my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, I have always believed that you are the only woman for my son.",
        "Taylor: If you really believed that, you would've let Ridge choose on his own between me and Brooke. You wouldn't have forced his hand.",
        "Stephanie: Perhaps I should've had more patience.",
        "Taylor: But you couldn't take the chance that he wouldn't choose me.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that would've been the biggest mistake --",
        "Taylor: No -- that's why you didn't want me to tell him about James. This has nothing to do with Ridge and me. It has everything to do with your vendetta against Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: No.",
        "Taylor: Oh, come on, Stephanie. How many years have we known each other? You can be honest with me.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, I think at this moment, you had better be honest with yourself.",
        "Taylor: You're trying to tell me that Brooke isn't the reason for nearly everything you've done since she came into ridge's life?",
        "Stephanie: Well, she's responsible for nearly all the crises that this family's suffered through, yes.",
        "Taylor: But Brooke didn't cause this crisis, I did!",
        "Stephanie: Yes, but she can make it worse. You can't let that happen. She's never gotten Ridge -- look, she's only gotten Ridge by default. She's never taken him away from you. You can salvage this marriage. He understands that people make mistakes. He's not stupid. You've acknowledged it. You've accepted responsibility. Now you have to figure out a way to get him to take you back. Don't get sidetracked here. If you do, Brooke will derail the whole marriage, and -- you can't let that happen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Tucking the kids in is my favorite part of the day.",
        "Ridge: Mine, too. I miss tucking them in with you. I'd love to spend more time with you guys. I love you, Logan. All of you.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you're just upset with Taylor.",
        "Ridge: I never stopped caring about you.",
        "Brooke: Look, I don't want to get in the middle of this.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, Brooke -- listen -- listen.",
        "Brooke: No, Ridge -- you listen. There was a time when I thought that the bond that we shared could never be broken. Until you broke it. When you chose Taylor over me, something inside of me was just shattered. And it wasn't just my heart, it was my faith that I had in you -- the way I looked at the world, the way I lived my life.",
        "Ridge: And now, I know exactly how that feels. What Taylor and mother did, by keeping that secret from me -- maybe I'm overreacting, and it was one bizarre night with James. But it tainted everything. And that makes what they did to you inexcusable. I can't believe I just stood by and let it happen.",
        "Brooke: You were manipulated.",
        "Ridge: You were fighting that battle on your own, Brooke. But no more. You're not going to be their scapegoat anymore. I'm not going to let them abuse you ever again!",
        "Brooke: What are you saying?",
        "Ridge: I'm asking you to forgive me. And more than that, I'm asking that -- I'm asking you to --",
        "Brooke: What? What are you asking me, Ridge?"
